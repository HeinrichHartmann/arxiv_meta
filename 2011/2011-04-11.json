For the effective numerical solution of these systems, standard\nimplicit time-stepping methods are often not suitable anymore, and tailored\ntime-discretization methods are required.

They only differ by the interaction contributing to\nthe action. This allows to import tools developed for Feynman path integrals,\nin order to deal with superoperators instead of quantum mechanical commutators\nin real time evolution. Perturbation theory is derived. Besides applications in\nclassical statistical physics, the \"classical path integral\" and the parallel\nstudy of classical and quantum evolution indicate new aspects of (dynamically\nassisted) entanglement (generation).

In contrast to most materials that display PSD, the ordered\nphase of Gd2Sn2O7 is well characterized and both the nature and the magnitude\nof the interactions have been inferred from the magnetic structure and the\ntemperature dependence of the magnetic specific heat. Based on this\nunderstanding, the temperature dependence of the muon spin polarization\nrelaxation through the scattering of spin waves (magnons) is calculated.

This article presents a\ngeneral method for this problem based on a flexible parameterization device\ncalled \"anchors\", which captures local or global features of the fields. A\nclassification of all relevant data into two categories closely cooperates with\nthe anchor concept to enable systematic use of datasets of different sources\nand disciplinary natures. In particular, nonlinearity in the \"forward models\"\nis handled automatically. Treatment of measurement and model errors is\nsystematic and integral in the method; however the method is also suitable in\nthe usual setting where one does not have reliable information about these\nerrors. Compared to a state-space approach, the anchor parameterization renders\nthe task in a parameter space of radically reduced dimension; consequently,\neasier and more rigorous statistical inference, interpretation, and sampling\nare possible. A procedure for deriving the posterior distribution of model\nparameters is presented. Based on Monte Carlo sampling and normal mixture\napproximation to high-dimensional densities, the procedure has generality and\nefficiency features that provide a basis for practical implementations of this\ncomputationally demanding inverse procedure.

Many stars are members of binary systems. During early\nphases when the stars are surrounded by discs, the binary orbit and disc\nmidplane may be mutually inclined. The discs around T Tauri stars will become\nmildly warped and undergo solid body precession around the angular momentum\nvector of the binary system. It is unclear how planetesimals in such a disc\nwill evolve and affect planet formation. Aims. We investigate the dynamics of\nplanetesimals embedded in discs that are perturbed by a binary companion on a\ncircular, inclined orbit. We examine collisional velocities of the\nplanetesimals to determine when they can grow through accretion. We vary the\nbinary inclination, binary separation, D, disc mass, and planetesimal radius.\nOur standard model has D=60 AU, inclination=45 deg, and a disc mass equivalent\nto the MMSN. Methods. We use a 3D hydrodynamics code to model the disc.\nPlanetesimals are test particles which experience gas drag, the gravitational\nforce of the disc, the companion star gravity. Planetesimal orbit crossing\nevents are detected and used to estimate collisional velocities. Results. For\nbinary systems with modest inclination (25 deg), disc gravity prevents\nplanetesimal orbits from undergoing strong differential nodal precession (which\noccurs in absence of the disc), and forces planetesimals to precess with the\ndisc on average. For bodies of different size the orbit planes become modestly\nmutually inclined, leading to collisional velocities that inhibit growth. For\nlarger inclinations (45 degrees), the Kozai effect operates, leading to\ndestructively large relative velocities. Conclusions. Planet formation via\nplanetesimal accretion is difficult in an inclined binary system with\nparameters similar to those considered in this paper.

The\nprimary product of WMAP are the observations of CMB in 10 independent\ndifference assemblies (DA) distributed over 5 frequency bands that have\nuncorrelated noise. Our method utilizes maximum information available within\nWMAP data by linearly combining DA maps from different frequencies to remove\nforegrounds and estimating the power spectrum from the 24 cross power spectra\nof clean maps that have independent noise. An important merit of the method is\nthat the expected residual power from unresolved point sources is significantly\ntempered to a constant offset at large multipoles (in contrast to the ~l^2\ncontribution expected from a Poisson distribution) leading to a small\ncorrection at large multipoles.

The (angle-integrated)\ngeoneutrino flux places an integral constraint on the terrestrial radionuclide\ndistribution. In this paper, we calculate the angular distribution of\ngeoneutrinos, which opens a window on the differential radionuclide\ndistribution. We develop the general formalism for the neutrino angular\ndistribution, and we present the inverse transformation which recovers the\nterrestrial radioisotope distribution given a measurement of the neutrino\nangular distribution. Thus, geoneutrinos not only allow a means to image the\nEarth's interior, but offering a direct measure of the radioactive Earth, both\n(1) revealing the Earth's inner structure as probed by radionuclides, and (2)\nallowing for a complete determination of the radioactive heat generation as a\nfunction of radius.

In this\nmodel the neutrino generation is dominated by decays in the Earth's mantle and\ncrust; this leads to a very ``peripheral'' angular distribution, in which 2/3\nof the neutrinos come from angles > 60 degrees away from the downward vertical.\nWe note the possibility of that the Earth's core contains potassium; different\ngeophysical predictions lead to strongly varying, and hence distinguishable,\ncentral intensities (< 30 degrees from the downward vertical).
