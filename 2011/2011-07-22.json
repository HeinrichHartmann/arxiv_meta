We\npresent in detail a systematic expansion of the relevant magnetic RIXS cross\nsection by using the ultrashort core-hole lifetime (UCL) approximation. We\ncompute the scattering intensity and its momentum dependence in leading order\nof the UCL expansion. The scattering is due to two-magnon processes and is\ncalculated within a linear spin-wave expansion of the Heisenberg spin model for\nthis compound, including longer range and cyclic spin interactions. We observe\nthat the latter terms in the Hamiltonian enhance the first moment of the\nspectrum if they strengthen the antiferromagnetic ordering. The theoretical\nspectra agree very well with experimental data, including the observation that\nscattering intensity vanishes for the transferred momenta ${\\bf q} = (0,0)$ and\n${\\bf q} = (\\pi,\\pi)$. We show that at finite temperature there is an\nadditional single-magnon contribution to the scattering with a spectral weight\nproportional to $T^3$.
