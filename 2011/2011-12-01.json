A rich\nbifurcation behavior is found, which is presented in terms of bifurcation\ndiagrams. The energetically preferred stable configuration is deduced from a\nleast-energy principle both for prescribed volume and prescribed pressure. We\nfind that buckled shapes are energetically favorable already at smaller\nnegative pressures and larger critical volumes than predicted by the classical\nbuckling instability. By preventing self-intersection for strongly reduced\nvolume, we obtain a complete picture of the buckling process and can follow the\nshape from the initial undeformed state through the buckling instability into\nthe fully collapsed state. Interestingly, the sequences of bifurcations and\nstable capsule shapes differ for prescribed volume and prescribed pressure. In\nthe buckled state, we find a relation between curvatures at the indentation rim\nand the bending modulus, which can be used to determine elastic moduli from\nexperimental shape analysis.\n"]}]

The sample spans\na wide range in luminosity (0.02-4 L*) and extends from the cluster core to\nnear the virial radius. We find a clear distinction in the observed trends of\nthe giant and dwarf galaxies. The ages of red-sequence giants are primarily\ndetermined by galaxy mass, with only weak modulation by environment, in the\nsense that galaxies at larger cluster-centric distance are slightly younger.\nFor red-sequence dwarfs (with mass <10^10 Msun), the roles of mass and\nenvironment as predictors of age are reversed: there is little dependence on\nmass, but strong trends with projected cluster-centric radius are observed. The\naverage age of dwarfs at the 2.5 Mpc limit of our sample is approximately half\nthat of dwarfs near the cluster centre. The gradient in dwarf galaxy ages is a\nglobal cluster-centric trend, and is not driven by the ongoing merger of the\nNGC 4839 group to the south west of Coma. We interpret these results using\nenvironmental histories extracted from the Millennium Simulation for members of\nmassive clusters. Hierarchical cluster assembly naturally leads to trends in\nthe accretion times of galaxies as a function of projected cluster-centric\nradius. On average, simulated galaxies now located in cluster cores joined\nhalos above any given mass threshold earlier than those now located in the\noutskirts of clusters. We test environmental quenching models, in which star\nformation is halted in galaxies when they enter halos of a given mass, or\nbecome satellite galaxies.

On lowering the temperature, the formation of a magnetic dimer, with a\nlow-spin ground state due to antiferromagnetic interaction (J/kB = -25 K)\nbetween Ni2+ and Nd3+, is found in the case of [NiNd], while in [NiGd] a\nferromagnetic interaction (J/kB = 3.31 K) between the magnetic ions leads to a\nhigh-spin (S = 9/2) ground state. The temperature dependence of the proton\nnuclear spin lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 in [NiNd] is driven by the\nfluctuation of the hyperfine field at the nuclear site due to relaxation of the\nmagnetization. At high temperature the independent Ni2+ and Nd3+ spins\nfluctuate fast while at low temperature we observe a slowing down of the\nfluctuation of the total magnetization of the dimer because of the insurgence\nof antiferromagnetic spin correlations.

The second and third nodes are used in different communication phases\nas jammers in order to create intentional interference upon the eavesdropper\nnode. Firstly, we find that in a topology where the intermediate nodes are\nrandomly and sparsely distributed, the proposed schemes with cooperative\njamming outperform the conventional non-jamming schemes within a certain\ntransmitted power regime. We also find that, in the scenario in which the\nintermediate nodes gather as a close cluster, the jamming schemes may be less\neffective than their non-jamming counterparts.

The term Quantum Gravity itself is ambiguous as there are many\nproposals for its correct formulation and none of them have been verified\nexperimentally. In this thesis we consider a number of closely related\napproaches to two dimensional quantum gravity that share the property that they\nmay be formulated in terms of random graphs. In one such approach known as\nCausal Dynamical Triangulations, numerical computations suggest an interesting\nphenomenon in which the effective spacetime dimension is reduced in the UV. In\nthis thesis we first address whether such a dynamical reduction in the number\nof dimensions may be understood in a simplified model. We introduce a continuum\nlimit where this simplified model exhibits a reduction in the effective\ndimension of spacetime in the UV, in addition to having rich cross-over\nbehaviour.\n  In the second part of this thesis we consider an approach closely related to\ncausal dynamical triangulation; namely dynamical triangulation. Although this\ntheory is less well-behaved than causal dynamical triangulation, it is known\nhow to couple it to matter, therefore allowing for potentially multiple\nboundary states to appear in the theory. We address the conjecture of Seiberg\nand Shih which states that all these boundary states are degenerate and may be\nconstructed from a single principal boundary state. By use of the random graph\nformulation of the theory we compute the higher genus amplitudes with a single\nboundary and find that they violate the Seiberg-Shih conjecture. Finally we\ndiscuss whether this result prevents the replacement of boundary states by\nlocal operators as proposed by Seiberg.\n","Comment: 142 pages, 13 figures, PhD thesis, University of Oxford (2011)"]}]
