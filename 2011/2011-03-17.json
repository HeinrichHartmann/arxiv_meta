This catalog\nsummarizes 46 high-confidence pulsed detections using the first six months of\ndata taken by the Large Area Telescope (LAT), Fermi's main instrument. Sixteen\npreviously unknown pulsars were discovered by searching for pulsed signals at\nthe positions of bright gamma-ray sources seen with the LAT, or at the\npositions of objects suspected to be neutron stars based on observations at\nother wavelengths. Pulsed gamma-ray emission was discovered from twenty-four\nknown pulsars by using ephemerides (timing solutions) derived from monitoring\nradio pulsars. Eight of these new gamma-ray pulsars are millisecond pulsars.\nThe pulsed energy spectra can be described by a power law with an exponential\ncutoff, with cutoff energies in the range 1 to 5 GeV. The rotational energy\nloss rate (\\dot{E}) of these neutron stars spans 5 decades, from ~3x10^{33}\nerg/s to 5x10^{38} erg/s, and the apparent efficiencies for conversion to\ngamma-ray emission range from ~0.1% to unity, although distance uncertainties\ncomplicate efficiency estimates. The pulse shapes show substantial diversity,\nbut roughly 75% of the gamma-ray pulse profiles have two peaks, separated by\n>0.2 of rotational phase. For most of the pulsars, gamma-ray emission appears\nto come mainly from the outer magnetosphere, while polar-cap emission remains\nplausible for a remaining few.

We found that the time-resolved spectra of 14\nout of 17 GRBs are best modeled with the Band function over the entire Fermi\nspectral range, which may suggest a common origin for emissions detected by LAT\nand GBM.

They focused, in particular, on the problem of\nenergy transfer from large to small scales in decaying flare current sheet\n(CS). Their calculations suggest, that magnetic flux-ropes (plasmoids) are\nformed in full range of scales by a cascade of tearing and coalescence\nprocesses. Consequently, the initially thick current layer becomes highly\nfragmented. Thus, the tearing and coalescence cascade can cause an effective\nenergy transfer across the scales. In the current paper we investigate whether\nthis mechanism actually applies in solar flares. We extend the MHD simulation\nby deriving model-specific features that can be looked for in observations. The\nresults of the underlying MHD model showed that the plasmoid cascade creates a\nspecific hierarchical distribution of non-ideal/acceleration regions embedded\nin the CS. We therefore focus on the features associated with the fluxes of\nenergetic particles, in particular on the structure and dynamics of emission\nregions in flare ribbons. We assume that the structure and dynamics of\ndiffusion regions embedded in the CS imprint themselves into structure and\ndynamics of flare-ribbon kernels by means of magnetic-field mapping.

Both Alice-Bob and Alice-Eve channels are assumed to undergo slow\nfading, and perfect channel state information (CSI) is assumed to be known only\nat the receivers during the transmission. In each fading slot, Alice broadcasts\na continuum of coded layers and, hence, allows Bob to decode at the rate\ncorresponding to the fading state (unknown to Alice). The index of a reliably\ndecoded layer is sent back from Bob to Alice via a public and error-free\nchannel and used to generate a common secret key. In this paper, the achievable\nsecrecy key rate is first derived for a given power distribution over coded\nlayers. The optimal power distribution is then characterized.
