A diagram with the relative location of Fermi levels\nand gaps for several oxides is presented.

In the dense-lattice limit the plasma peak moves to higher frequency\nand its intensity rapidly decreases, in agreement with experiment and\nanalytical theory. Behavior of the loss function at low frequencies is well\ndescribed by the phenomenological theory of vortex oscillations. In the case of\nvery strong in-plane dissipation an additional peak in the loss function\nappears below the plasma frequency.

NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) contains an\nintramolecular chain of seven iron-sulphur (FeS) clusters, one of the longest\nchains of metal centres in biology and a test case for physical models of\nintramolecular ET. In biology, intramolecular ET is commonly described as a\ndiffusive hopping process, according to the semi-classical theories of Marcus\nand Hopfield. However, recent studies have raised the possibility that\nnon-trivial quantum mechanical effects play a functioning role in certain\nbiomolecular processes. Here, we extend the semi-classical model for biological\nET to incorporate both semi-classical and coherent quantum phenomena using a\nquantum master equation based on the Holstein Hamiltonian. We test our model on\nthe structurally-defined chain of FeS clusters in complex I. By exploring a\nwide range of realistic parameters we find that, when the energy profile for ET\nalong the chain is relatively flat, just a small coherent contribution can\nprovide a robust and significant increase in ET rate (above the semi-classical\ndiffusive-hopping rate), even at physiologically-relevant temperatures.\nConversely, when the on-site energies vary significantly along the chain the\ncoherent contribution is negligible. For complex I, a crucial respiratory\nenzyme that is linked to many neuromuscular and degenerative diseases, our\nresults suggest a new contribution towards ensuring that intramolecular ET does\nnot limit the rate of catalysis.

Here we introduce a new route to enhancing necessary conditions\nfor $N$-representability through rank restriction of the 2-RDM. Rather than\nadding computationally more expensive $N$-representability conditions, we\ndirectly enhance the accuracy of two-particle (2-positivity) conditions through\nrank restriction, which removes degrees of freedom in the 2-RDM that are not\nsufficiently constrained. We select the rank of the particle-hole 2-RDM by\nderiving the ranks associated with model wavefunctions including both\nmean-field and antisymmetrized geminal power (AGP) wave functions. Because the\n2-positivity conditions are exact for quantum systems with AGP ground states,\nthe rank of the particle-hole 2-RDM from the AGP ansatz provides a minimum for\nits value in variational 2-RDM calculations of general quantum systems. To\nimplement the rank-restricted conditions, we extend a first-order algorithm for\nlarge-scale semidefinite programming.

We briefly overview these activities, which\nare described fully in other articles in these conference proceedings (Putnam\net al., Do et al., and Harrington et al., respectively).\n  We devote attention to the unique challenges encountered in the design of\nthese activities, including the marriage of inquiry-like investigation\ntechniques with complex content and the need to tune depth to a graduate- and\nPhD-level audience. According to before-after surveys conducted in 2008, the\nvast majority of participants found that all activities were valuable to their\ncareers, although direct experience with integrated, functional AO systems was\nparticularly beneficial.\n","Comment: Published in ASP Conference Proceedings: Learning from Inquiry in\n  Practice, 436, 2010, L.

In this paper we discuss microscopic estimates of the values of\nthese parameters in semiconductor quantum wires that exploit their relationship\nto thermodynamic properties. Motivated by the recognized similarity between\ncorrelations in the ground state of a one-dimensional electron liquid and\ncorrelations in a Wigner crystal, we evaluate these thermodynamic quantities in\na self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. According to our calculations,\nthe Hartree-Fock approximation ground state is a Wigner crystal at all electron\ndensities and has antiferromagnetic order that gradually evolves from\nspin-density-wave to localized in character as the density is lowered. Our\nresults for $K_{\\rho}$ are in good agreement with weak-coupling perturbative\nestimates $K_{\\rho}^{pert}$ at high densities, but deviate strongly at low\ndensities, especially when the electron-electron interaction is screened at\nlong distances. $K_{\\rho}^{pert}\\sim n^{1/2}$ vanishes at small carrier density\n$n$ whereas we conjecture that $K_{\\rho}\\to 1/2$ when $n\\to 0$, implying that\n$K_{\\rho}$ should pass through a minimum at an intermediate density.\nObservation of such a non-monotonic dependence on particle density would allow\nto measure the range of the microscopic interaction. In the spin sector we find\nthat the spin velocity decreases with increasing interaction strength or\ndecreasing $n$. Strong correlation effects make it difficult to obtain fully\nconsistent estimates of $v_{\\sigma}$ from Hartree-Fock calculations.

The many-body dynamics of nuclear spin bath is solved with a\npair-correlation approximation.

In this paper instead we study the second integral form, say\nF'_q[GL(n)], i.e. that of all elements which are Z[q,q^{-1}]-valued over the\nunrestricted form of U_q(gl(n)). In particular we yield a presentation of it by\ngenerators and relations, and a PBW-like theorem: in short, it is an algebra of\n\"quantum divided powers\" and \"quantum binomial coefficients\". Moreover, we give\na direct proof that F'_q[GL(n)] is a Hopf subalgebra of F_q[GL(n)], and that\nits specialization at q=1 is the Z-hyperalgebra over gl(n)^*, the Lie bialgebra\ndual to gl(n). In addition, we describe explicitly the specializations of\nF'_q[GL(n)] at roots of 1, and the associated quantum Frobenius (epi)morphism.\nThe same analysis is done for F'_q[SL(n)] and (as a key step) F'_q[Mat(n)]: in\nfact, for the latter the strongest results are obtained.\n  This work extends to general n>2 the results for n=2, already treated in\nmath.QA/0411440.\n","Comment: AMS-TeX file, 34 pages.

For flows in the exterior of a\nsmooth, connected, bounded domain we prove a confinement estimate with exponent\n1/2 (i.e. we remove the $\\vare$) and in certain cases, depending on the\nharmonic part of the flow, we establish a logarithmic improvement over the\nexponent 1/2. The main new ingredients in our approach are: (1) a detailed\nasymptotic description of solutions to the exterior Poisson problem near\ninfinity, obtained by the use of Riemann mappings; (2) renormalized energy\nestimates and bounds on logarithmic moments of vorticity and (3) a new {\\it a\npriori} estimate on time derivatives of logarithmic perturbations of the moment\nof inertia.\n","Comment: Submitted for publication"]}]

The other, local statistical complexity filtering, calculates\nthe amount of information needed for optimal prediction of the system's\nbehavior in the vicinity of a given point.

An implementation\nincludes a specification with which probabilities the different measurement\nsettings are sampled, and hence the maximization is done over all such setting\ndistributions.\n  We analyze two versions of Bell's nonlocality proof (his original proof and\nan optimized version by Peres), and proofs by Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt,\nHardy, Mermin, and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger. We find that the GHZ proof is\nat least four and a half times stronger than all other proofs, while of the\ntwo-party proofs, the one of CHSH is the strongest.\n","Comment: 36 pages, no figures, v2: major changes in presentation, no changes\n  in results, conjectures added"]}]

This cipher also totally closes the gap\nbetween the key requirement of quantum ciphers and classical ciphers.\n","Comment: 12 pages"]}]

These schedules exhibit faster decrease of the excitation\nprobability than a linear schedule. To derive this conclusion, the asymptotic\nform of the excitation probability for quantum annealing is explicitly obtained\nin the limit of long annealing time. Its first-order term, which is inversely\nproportional to the square of the annealing time, is shown to be determined\nonly by the information at the initial and final times. Our annealing schedules\nmake it possible to drop this term, thus leading to a higher order (smaller)\nexcitation probability.
