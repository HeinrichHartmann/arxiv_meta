We first formulate a recipe which determines the Bloch\nstates of a one-dimensional (1D) ring from the Bloch states of an infinite 1D\ncrystal created by the periodic repetition of the ring. Using the recipe, we\nderive an expression for the persistent current in a 1D ring made of an\ninsulator with an arbitrary valence band E(k). To find an exact result for a\nspecific insulator, we consider a 1D ring represented by a periodic lattice of\nN identical sites with a single value of the on-site energy. If the Bloch\nstates in the ring are expanded over a complete set of N on-site Wannier\nfunctions, the discrete on-site energy splits into the energy band. At full\nfilling, the band emulates the valence band of the band insulator and the ring\nis insulating. It carries a persistent current equal to the product of N and\nthe derivative of the on-site energy with respect to the magnetic flux. This\ncurrent is not zero if one takes into account that the on-site Wannier function\nand consequently the on-site energy of each ring site depend on magnetic flux.\nTo derive the current analytically, we expand all N Wannier functions of the\nring over the infinite basis of Wannier functions of the constituting infinite\n1D crystal and eventually determine the crystal Wannier functions by a method\nof localized atomic orbitals. Finally, we estimate the persistent current at\nfull filling in rings made of real band insulators (GaAs, Ge, InAs).

In that\nphase, the inhomogeneous gluon condensate anti-screens the magnetic field due\nto the anomalous magnetic moment of these spin-1 particles. This paramagnetic\neffect can be of interest for astrophysics, since due to the gluon vortex\nantiscreening mechanism, compact stars with color superconducting cores could\nhave larger magnetic fields than neutron stars made up entirely of nuclear\nmatter. I will also discuss a second gluon condensation phenomenon connected to\nthe Meissner instability attained at moderate densities by two-flavor color\nsuperconductors. In this situation, an inhomogeneous condensate of charged\ngluons emerges to remove the chromomagnetic instability created by the pairing\nmismatch, and as a consequence, the charged gluonic currents induce a magnetic\nfield. Finally, I will point out a possible relation between glitches in\nneutron stars and the existence of the gluon vortices.\n","Comment: Talk given at XII Mexican Workshop on Particles & Fields.

We deduce\nthe k_T- and collinear factorizations for the DIS structure functions by\nconsecutive reductions of a more general theoretical construction. We begin by\nstudying the amplitude of the forward Compton scattering off a hadron target,\nrepresenting this amplitude as a set of convolutions of two blobs connected by\nthe simplest, two-parton intermediate states. Each blob in the convolutions can\ncontain both the perturbative and non-perturbative contributions. We formulate\nconditions for separating the perturbative and non-perturbative contributions\nand attributing them to the different blobs. After that the convolutions\ncorrespond to the QCD factorization. Then we reduce this totally unintegrated\n(basic) factorization first to the k_T- factorization and finally to the\ncollinear factorization. In order to yield a finite expression for the Compton\namplitude, the integration over the loop momentum in the basic factorization\nmust be free of both ultraviolet and infrared singularities. This obvious\nmathematical requirement leads to theoretical restrictions on the\nnon-perturbative contributions (parton distributions) to the Compton amplitude\nand the DIS structure functions related to the Compton amplitude through the\nOptical theorem. In particular, our analysis excludes the use of the singular\nfactors x^{-a} (with a > 0) in the fits for the quark and gluon distributions\nbecause such factors contradict to the integrability of the basic convolutions\nfor the Compton amplitude.

To address this, many\nresearchers have developed techniques that allow the agents to make decisions\nbased on estimates of the states and actions of other agents that are typically\nlearnt using some form of machine learning algorithm. Nevertheless, many of\nthese approaches fail to provide an actual means by which the necessary\ninformation is made available so that the estimates can be learnt.

The key technique behind this progress is the use of heuristic\nfunctions based on relaxing the planning task at hand, where the relaxation is\nto assume that all delete lists are empty. The unprecedented success of such\nmethods, in many commonly used benchmark examples, calls for an understanding\nof what classes of domains these methods are well suited for. In the\ninvestigation at hand, we derive a formal background to such an understanding.\nWe perform a case study covering a range of 30 commonly used STRIPS and ADL\nbenchmark domains, including all examples used in the first four international\nplanning competitions. We *prove* connections between domain structure and\nlocal search topology -- heuristic cost surface properties -- under an\nidealized version of the heuristic functions used in modern planners. The\nidealized heuristic function is called h^+, and differs from the practically\nused functions in that it returns the length of an *optimal* relaxed plan,\nwhich is NP-hard to compute. We identify several key characteristics of the\ntopology under h^+, concerning the existence/non-existence of unrecognized dead\nends, as well as the existence/non-existence of constant upper bounds on the\ndifficulty of escaping local minima and benches. These distinctions divide the\n(set of all) planning domains into a taxonomy of classes of varying h^+\ntopology.

This relationship is derived from first principles and is\nproven to be the only relationship having the properties that we intuitively\nexpect from a \"projection.\" In addition to the efficiency and optimality\ncharacteristics of H&B algorithms, the proposed framework has the desirable\nproperty of integrating information in the 2D image with information in the 3D\nprior to estimate the optimal reconstruction.

Due to these obstacles, there are few laboratory\nimplementations of theoretically designed DNA computers (like the Turing\nmachine and pushdown automaton), but there are many implementations of DNA\ncomputers for particular problems. The first practical laboratory\nimplementation of the general theoretical model of a machine performing\nDNA-based calculations was a simple two-symbol two-state finite automaton\nestablished by Benenson et al.(2001). In the present work, we propose a new\nattitude, extending the capability of DNA-based finite automaton, by employing\ntwo or potentially more restriction enzymes instead of one used in other works.\nThis creates an opportunity to implement in laboratories of more complex finite\nautomata and other theoretical models of computers: pushdown automata, Turing\nmachines.\n","Comment: 11.pages, submitted to Nature Nanotechnology"]}]

One such algorithm, the so-called D-bar method, is improved in this\nwork by introducing new computational steps that remove the so far necessary\nrequirement that the conductivity should be constant near the boundary. The\nnumerical experiments presented suggest two conclusions. First, for most\nconductivities arising in medical imaging, it seems the previous approach of\nusing a best possible constant near the boundary is sufficient. Second, for\nconductivities that have high contrast features at the boundary, the new\napproach produces reconstructions with smaller quantitative error and with\nbetter visual quality.\n"]}]

The balance\nequations for spatial averages such as density, linear momentum, and energy\nwere previously derived by a number of authors. These equations are not in\nclosed form because the stress and the heat flux cannot be evaluated without\nthe knowledge of particle positions and velocities. We propose a closure method\nfor approximating fluxes in terms of other meso-scale averages. The main idea\nis to rewrite the non-linear averages as linear convolutions that relate micro-\nand meso-scale dynamical functions. The convolutions can be approximately\ninverted using regularization methods developed for solving ill-posed problems.\nThis yields closed form constitutive equations that can be evaluated without\nsolving the underlying ODEs. We test the method numerically on Fermi-Pasta-Ulam\nchains with two different potentials: the classical Lennard-Jones, and the\npurely repulsive potential used in granular materials modeling. The initial\nconditions incorporate velocity fluctuations on scales that are smaller than\nthe size of the averaging window. The results show very good agreement between\nthe exact stress and its closed form approximation.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 16 figures"]}]
