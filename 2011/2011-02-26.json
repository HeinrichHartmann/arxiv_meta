Since the author has never visited any\nof these fields, this review is indeed a passer-by's impression. On the other\nhand, he happens to be a human (who occasionally is moving) and, as everybody\nelse, rates himself an expert in Applied Common Sense. Thus the author hopes\nthat this view from the {\\em outside} will be of some interest not only for the\nstrangers like himself, but for those who are {\\em inside} as well.\n  Two flaws of the text that follows are inevitable. First, some essential\nissues that are too familar to the specialists to discuss them may be missing.\nSecond, the author probably failed to provide the uniform \"level-of-detail\" for\nthis wide range of topics.\n","Comment: Appendix: \"The Animator's Eleven Commandments\""]}]
