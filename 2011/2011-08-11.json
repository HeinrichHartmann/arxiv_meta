However\nNEATM assumes zero thermal emission on the night side of an asteroid. We\ninvestigate how this assumption affects the best-fit beaming parameter,\noverestimates the effective diameter and underestimates the albedo at large\nphase angles, by testing NEATM on thermal IR fluxes generated from simulated\nasteroid surfaces with different thermal inertia. We compare NEATM to radar\ndiameters and find that NEATM overestimates the diameter when the beaming\nparameter is fitted to multi-wavelength observations and underestimates the\ndiameter when the default beaming parameter is used. The Night Emission\nSimulated Thermal Model (NESTM) is introduced. NESTM models the night side\ntemperature as an iso-latitudinal fraction (f) of the maximum day side\ntemperature (Maximum temperature calculated for NEATM with beaming parameter =\n1). A range of f is found for different thermal parameters, which depend on the\nthermal inertia. NESTM diameters are compared with NEATM and radar diameters,\nand it is shown that NESTM may reduce the systematic bias in overestimating\ndiameters. It is suggested that a version of the NESTM which assumes the\nthermal inertia = 200 S.I. units is adopted as a default model when the solar\nphase angle is greater than 45 degrees.\n","Comment: 48 pages, 10 Figures, 5 Tables"]}]

So\nfar, the standard approach of distributed cross-layer design is based on dual\ndecomposition and the subgradient algorithm, which is a first-order method that\nhas a slow convergence rate. In this paper, we focus on solving a joint\nmulti-path routing and flow control (MRFC) problem by designing a new\ndistributed Newton's method, which is a second-order method and enjoys a\nquadratic rate of convergence. The major challenges in developing a distributed\nNewton's method lie in decentralizing the computation of the Hessian matrix and\nits inverse for both the primal Newton direction and dual variable updates. By\nappropriately reformulating, rearranging, and exploiting the special problem\nstructures, we show that it is possible to decompose such computations into\nsource nodes and links in the network, thus eliminating the need for global\ninformation. Furthermore, we derive closed-form expressions for both the primal\nNewton direction and dual variable updates, thus significantly reducing the\ncomputational complexity. The most attractive feature of our proposed\ndistributed Newton's method is that it requires almost the same scale of\ninformation exchange as in first-order methods, while achieving a quadratic\nrate of convergence as in centralized Newton methods. We provide extensive\nnumerical results to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm.

However,\nintrinsic incentive problems reside in crowdsourcing applications as workers\nand requester are selfish and aim to strategically maximize their own benefit.\nIn this paper, we propose to provide incentives for workers to exert effort\nusing a novel game-theoretic model based on repeated games. As there is always\na gap in the social welfare between the non-cooperative equilibria emerging\nwhen workers pursue their self-interests and the desirable Pareto efficient\noutcome, we propose a novel class of incentive protocols based on social norms\nwhich integrates reputation mechanisms into the existing pricing schemes\ncurrently implemented on crowdsourcing websites, in order to improve the\nperformance of the non-cooperative equilibria emerging in such applications. We\nfirst formulate the exchanges on a crowdsourcing website as a two-sided market\nwhere requesters and workers are matched and play gift-giving games repeatedly.\nSubsequently, we study the protocol designer's problem of finding an optimal\nand sustainable (equilibrium) protocol which achieves the highest social\nwelfare for that website. We prove that the proposed incentives protocol can\nmake the website operate close to Pareto efficiency. Moreover, we also examine\nan alternative scenario, where the protocol designer aims at maximizing the\nrevenue of the website and evaluate the performance of the optimal protocol.\n"]}]

Lower third generation squark masses, in turn, diminish the\neffect of a large top quark Yukawa coupling in the running of the higgs mass\nparameter m_{H_u}^2, leading to a reduction in the magnitude of the\nsuperpotential mu parameter (relative to M_1 and M_2). A low | mu | parameter\ngives rise to mixed higgsino dark matter (MHDM), which can efficiently\nannihilate in the early universe to give a dark matter relic density in accord\nwith WMAP measurements. We explore the phenomenology of the low |M_3| scenario,\nand find for the case of MHDM increased rates for direct and indirect detection\nof neutralino dark matter relative to the mSUGRA model. The sparticle mass\nspectrum is characterized by relatively light gluinos, frequently with\nm(gl)<<m(sq).

Standard good results for nuclear saturation\nproperties are obtained, with a possible improvement in the computed nuclear\ncompressibility.
