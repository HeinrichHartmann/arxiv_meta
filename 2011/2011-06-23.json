The\nprincipal focus of the paper is to show that the existence of a finitely\ngenerated normal subgroup of infinite index in a profinite group $G$ of\nnon-negative deficiency gives rather strong consequences for the structure of\n$G$. To make this precise we introduce the notion of $p$-deficiency ($p$ a\nprime) for a profinite group $G$. This concept is more useful in the study of\nprofinite groups then the notion of deficiency. We prove that if the\n$p$-deficiency of $G$ is positive and $N$ is a finitely generated normal\nsubgroup such that the $p$-Sylow subgroup of $G/N$ is infinite and $p$ divides\nthe order of $N$ then we have $\\cd_p(G)=2$, $\\cd_p(N)=1$ and $\\vcd_p(G/N)=1$\nfor the cohomological $p$-dimensions; moreover either the $p$-Sylow subgroup of\n$G/N$ is virtually cyclic or the $p$-Sylow subgroup of $N$ is cyclic.

This procedure was known to be optimal for\ncoherent states and for squeezed states with the `overlap fidelity' as figure\nof merit. Here we prove its optimality with respect to the trace norm distance\nand supremum risk. For the second problem we consider n i.i.d. spin-1/2 systems\nin an arbitrary unknown state $\\rho$ and look for the measurement-preparation\npair $(M_{n},P_{n})$ for which the reconstructed state $\\omega_{n}:=P_{n}\\circ\nM_{n} (\\rho^{\\otimes n})$ is as close as possible to the input state, i.e.\n$\\|\\omega_{n}- \\rho^{\\otimes n}\\|_{1}$ is small. The figure of merit is based\non the trace norm distance between input and output states. We show that\nasymptotically with $n$ the this problem is equivalent to the first one. The\nproof and construction of $(M_{n},P_{n})$ uses the theory of local asymptotic\nnormality developed for state estimation which shows that i.i.d. quantum models\ncan be approximated in a strong sense by quantum Gaussian models. The\nmeasurement part is identical with `optimal estimation', showing that\n`benchmarking' and estimation are closely related problems in the asymptotic\nset-up.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 2 figures, published version"]}]

Recent work has shown\nthat a planetesimal swarm embedded in a fully turbulent disc is subject to\nstrong excitation of the velocity dispersion, leading to collisional\ndestruction of bodies with radii R_p < 100 km. Significant diffusion of\nplanetesimal semimajor axes also arises, leading to large-scale spreading of\nthe planetesimal population throughout the inner regions of the protoplanetary\ndisc, in apparent contradiction of constraints provided by the distribution of\nasteroids within the asteroid belt.

These stripes are most likely the result of\ncosmic-ray (CR) generated magnetic turbulence at the SNR blast wave. However,\nfor the amazingly regular pattern of these stripes to appear requires the\nsimultaneous action of a number of shock-plasma phenomena and is not predicted\nby most models of magnetic field amplification. A consistent explanation of\nthese stripes yields information on the complex nonlinear plasma processes\nconnecting efficient CR acceleration and magnetic field fluctuations in strong\ncollisionless shocks. The nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration (NL-DSA) model\ndescribed here, which includes magnetic field amplification from a cosmic-ray\ncurrent driven instability, does predict stripes consistent with the\nsynchrotron emission observations of Tycho's SNR. We argue that the local\nambient mean magnetic field geometry determines the orientation of the stripes\nand therefore it can be reconstructed with the high resolution X-ray imaging.\nThe estimated maximum energy of the CR protons responsible for the stripes is\n$\\sim 10^{15}$\\,eV. Furthermore, the model predicts that a specific X-ray\npolarization pattern, with a polarized fraction ~ 50%, accompanies the stripes,\nwhich can be tested with future X-ray polarimeter missions.\n","Comment: Astrophysical J.

A manifold is n-plectic if it is equipped with a closed,\nnondegenerate form of degree n+1. We show that higher structures arise on these\nmanifolds which can be understood as the categorified or homotopy analogues of\nimportant structures studied in symplectic geometry and geometric quantization.\nJust as a symplectic manifold gives a Poisson algebra of functions, we show\nthat any n-plectic manifold gives a Lie n-algebra containing certain\ndifferential forms which we call Hamiltonian. Lie n-algebras are examples of\nstrongly homotopy Lie algebras.

We then develop the machinery necessary to\ngeometrically quantize n-plectic manifolds.

A gerbe is a categorified sheaf, or stack, which generalizes\nthe notion of a principal bundle.

Out of equilibrium methods such as\nion implantation are expected to dope ZnO successfully provided that the\nnon-radiative defects introduced by implantation can be annealed out. In this\nstudy, ZnO substrates are implanted with nitrogen ions, and the extended\ndefects induced by implantation are studied by transmission electron microscopy\nand X-ray diffraction (XRD), before and after annealing at 900^{\\circ}C. Before\nannealing, these defects are identified to be dislocation loops lying either in\nbasal planes in high N concentration regions, or in prismatic planes in low N\nconcentration regions, together with linear dislocations. An uniaxial\ndeformation of 0.4% along the c axis, caused by the predominant basal loops, is\nmeasured by XRD in the implanted layer. After annealing, prismatic loops\ndisappear while the density of basal loops decreases and their diameter\nincreases. Moreover, dislocation loops disappear completely from the\nsub-surface region. XRD measurements show a residual deformation of only 0.05%\nin the implanted and annealed layer. The fact that basal loops are favoured\nagainst prismatic ones at high N concentration or high temperature is\nattributed to a lower stacking fault energy in these conditions. The\ncoalescence of loops and their disappearance in the sub-surface region are\nascribed to point defect diffusion. Finally, the electrical and optical\nproperties of nitrogen-implanted ZnO are correlated with the observed\nstructural features.\n","Comment: 8 pages"]}]

Doping of transition elements leads to clustering which\nreduces the gravimetric density of hydrogen, while doping of alkali and\nalkali-earth metals on the nanocage materials, such as carborides, boronitride,\nand boron cages, were stabilized by the charger transfer from the dopant to the\nnanocage.

We show that the strategy is optimal in a local minimax sense for the\ntrace norm distance as well as other locally quadratic figures of merit. Local\nminimax optimality means that given $n$ identical qubits, there exists no\nestimator which can perform better than the proposed estimator on a\nneighborhood of size $n^{-1/2}$ of an arbitrary state. In particular, it is\nasymptotically Bayesian optimal for a large class of prior distributions.\n  We present a physical implementation of the optimal estimation strategy based\non continuous time measurements in a field that couples with the qubits.\n  The crucial ingredient of the result is the concept of local asymptotic\nnormality (or LAN) for qubits. This means that, for large $n$, the statistical\nmodel described by $n$ identically prepared qubits is locally equivalent to a\nmodel with only a classical Gaussian distribution and a Gaussian state of a\nquantum harmonic oscillator.\n  The term `local' refers to a shrinking neighborhood around a fixed state\n$\\rho_{0}$. An essential result is that the neighborhood radius can be chosen\narbitrarily close to $n^{-1/4}$. This allows us to use a two steps procedure by\nwhich we first localize the state within a smaller neighborhood of radius\n$n^{-1/2+\\epsilon}$, and then use LAN to perform optimal estimation.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 3 figures, to appear in Commun.
