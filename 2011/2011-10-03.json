Recent work\nhas also shown how to compute the lineage of a non-answer to a query. However,\nthe cause of an answer or non-answer is a more subtle notion and consists, in\ngeneral, of only a fragment of the lineage. In this paper, we adapt Halpern,\nPearl, and Chockler's recent definitions of causality and responsibility to\ndefine the causes of answers and non-answers to queries, and their degree of\nresponsibility. Responsibility captures the notion of degree of causality and\nserves to rank potentially many causes by their relative contributions to the\neffect. Then, we study the complexity of computing causes and responsibilities\nfor conjunctive queries. It is known that computing causes is NP-complete in\ngeneral. Our first main result shows that all causes to conjunctive queries can\nbe computed by a relational query which may involve negation. Thus, causality\ncan be computed in PTIME, and very efficiently so. Next, we study computing\nresponsibility. Here, we prove that the complexity depends on the conjunctive\nquery and demonstrate a dichotomy between PTIME and NP-complete cases. For the\nPTIME cases, we give a non-trivial algorithm, consisting of a reduction to the\nmax-flow computation problem. Finally, we prove that, even when it is in PTIME,\nresponsibility is complete for LOGSPACE, implying that, unlike causality, it\ncannot be computed by a relational query.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 12 figures, PVLDB 2011"]}]

The detectability of\nthis energy shift is enhanced by the fact that it is a time varying shift whose\noscillation frequency is set by fundamental physics and is therefore\nindependent of the details of the experiment.

The core part of such a system is the semantic\nparser that maps questions to logical forms. Semantic parsers are typically\ntrained from examples of questions annotated with their target logical forms,\nbut this type of annotation is expensive.\n  Our goal is to learn a semantic parser from question-answer pairs instead,\nwhere the logical form is modeled as a latent variable. Motivated by this\nchallenging learning problem, we develop a new semantic formalism,\ndependency-based compositional semantics (DCS), which has favorable linguistic,\nstatistical, and computational properties. We define a log-linear distribution\nover DCS logical forms and estimate the parameters using a simple procedure\nthat alternates between beam search and numerical optimization. On two standard\nsemantic parsing benchmarks, our system outperforms all existing\nstate-of-the-art systems, despite using no annotated logical forms.\n"]}]

In this paper, we study influence maximization from a\nnovel data-based perspective. In particular, we introduce a new model, which we\ncall credit distribution, that directly leverages available propagation traces\nto learn how influence flows in the network and uses this to estimate expected\ninfluence spread. Our approach also learns the different levels of\ninfluenceability of users, and it is time-aware in the sense that it takes the\ntemporal nature of influence into account. We show that influence maximization\nunder the credit distribution model is NP-hard and that the function that\ndefines expected spread under our model is submodular. Based on these, we\ndevelop an approximation algorithm for solving the influence maximization\nproblem that at once enjoys high accuracy compared to the standard approach,\nwhile being several orders of magnitude faster and more scalable.\n","Comment: VLDB2012"]}]
