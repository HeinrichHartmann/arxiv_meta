The originality\nof our approach is that instead of using traditional bases of functions, it\nrelies on the basis of eigenmodes of the dissipation operator, which represents\nviscous and Joule dissipation. We apply this idea to the simple case of a\nperiodic domain in the three directions of space, with an homogeneous magnetic\nfield in the $\\mathbf e_z$ direction. The basis is then still as subset of the\nFourier space, but ordered by growing linear decay rate $|\\lambda|$ (\\emph{i.e}\naccording to the \\emph{least dissipative modes}). We show that because the\nlines of constant energy tend to follow those of constant $|\\lambda|$ in the\nFourier space, the scaling for the the smallest scales $|\\lambda^{\\rm max}|$ in\na forced flow can be expressed using this single parameter, as a function of\nthe Reynolds number as $\\sqrt{|\\lambda^{\\rm max}|}/(2\\pi k_f)\\simeq\n0.5\\Rey^{1/2}$, where $k_f$ is the forcing wavelength, or as a function of the\nGrashof number $\\Gr_f$, which gives a non-dimensional measure of the forcing,\nas $|\\lambda^{\\rm max}|^{1/2}/(2\\pi k_f)\\simeq 0.47\\Gr_f^{0.20}$.

Finally, we show that the set of\nleast dissipative modes gives a relevant prediction for the scale of the first\nthree-dimensional structure to appear in a forced, initially two-dimensional\nturbulent flow. This completes our numerical demonstration that the least\ndissipative modes can be used to simulate both two- and three-dimensional\nlow-Rm MHD flows.\n","Comment: 24 pages.

Using a system of\nmaster-Boltzmann equations describing both polariton modes and the THz mode, we\ncalculate the first and second order coherences and the spectral shape of THz\nemission. This analysis shows that THz lasing in microcavities is possible\nprovided that the system is embedded in a good THz cavity, that the optical\n(polariton) lasing condition is fulfilled and if the depletion of the upper\npolariton mode due to acoustic phonon assisted relaxation processes is reduced.\nThis latter condition is likely to be realised in pillar microcavities, which\nseem to be the most suitable candidates for realisation of a THz laser.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures"]}]

In this document, the\nObservation Data Model Core Components (ObsCoreDM) defines the core components\nof queryable metadata required for global discovery of observational data. It\nis meant to allow a single query to be posed to TAP services at multiple sites\nto perform global data discovery without having to understand the details of\nthe services present at each site. It defines a minimal set of basic metadata\nand thus allows for a reasonable cost of implementation by data providers. The\ncombination of the ObsCoreDM with TAP is referred to as an ObsTAP service.

The\nformation of the penumbra is intimately related to the inclined magnetic field.\nWithin 4.5 h observing time, the magnetic flux of the penumbra increases from\n9.7E+20 to 18.2E+20 Mx, while the magnetic flux of the umbra remains constant\nat about 3.8E+20 Mx.

The spot's flux increase\nrate of 4.2E+16 Mx/s corresponds to the merging of one SFP per minute. We also\nfind that during the formation of the spot penumbra: a) the maximum magnetic\nfield strength of the umbra does not change, b) the magnetic neutral line keeps\nthe same position relative to the umbra, c) the new flux arrives on the\nemergence side of the spot while the penumbra forms on the opposite side, d)\nthe average LRF inclination of the light bridges decreases from 50 to 37 deg,\nand e) as the penumbra develops, the mean magnetic field strength at the spot\nborder decreases from 1.0 to 0.8 kG. The SFPs associated with elongated\ngranules are the building blocks of structure formation in active regions.\nDuring the sunspot formation, their contribution is comparable to the\ncoalescence of pores.
