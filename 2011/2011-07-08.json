Earlier work has suggested that large-scale dynamos can reach and\nmaintain equipartition field strengths on a dynamical time scale only if\nmagnetic helicity of the fluctuating field can be shed from the domain through\nopen boundaries. Aims. Our aim is to test this scenario in convection-driven\ndynamos by comparing results for open and closed boundary conditions. Methods.\nThree-dimensional numerical simulations of turbulent compressible convection\nwith shear and rotation are used to study the effects of boundary conditions on\nthe excitation and saturation of large-scale dynamos. Open (vertical-field) and\nclosed (perfect-conductor) boundary conditions are used for the magnetic field.\nThe shear flow is such that the contours of shear are vertical, crossing the\nouter surface, and are thus ideally suited for driving a shear-induced magnetic\nhelicity flux. Results. We find that for given shear and rotation rate, the\ngrowth rate of the magnetic field is larger if open boundary conditions are\nused. The growth rate first increases for small magnetic Reynolds number, Rm,\nbut then levels off at an approximately constant value for intermediate values\nof Rm. For large enough Rm, a small-scale dynamo is excited and the growth rate\nof the field in this regime increases as Rm^(1/2). Regarding the nonlinear\nregime, the saturation level of the energy of the total magnetic field is\nindependent of Rm when open boundaries are used. In the case of perfect\nconductor boundaries, the saturation level first increases as a function of Rm,\nbut then decreases proportional to Rm^(-1) for Rm > 30, indicative of\ncatastrophic quenching. These results suggest that the shear-induced magnetic\nhelicity flux is efficient in alleviating catastrophic quenching when open\nboundaries are used. The horizontally averaged mean field is still weakly\ndecreasing as a function of Rm even for open boundaries.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 7 figures, published version"]}]

In particular, it provides an\ninteresting signature-based representation of the system reliability in terms\nof reliabilities of k-out-of-n systems. In the non-i.i.d. case, we show that,\nat any time, this representation still holds true for every coherent system if\nand only if the component states are exchangeable. We also discuss conditions\nfor obtaining an alternative representation of the system reliability in which\nthe signature is replaced by its non-i.i.d. extension.

Global simulations, however, continue to suffer from the age-old\nproblem of too low spatial resolution, leading to much lower Reynolds numbers\nand scale separation than in the Sun. Reproducing the internal rotation of the\nSun, which plays a crucual role in the dynamo process, has also turned out to\nbe a very difficult problem. In the present paper the current status of global\ndynamo simulations of the Sun is reviewed.

In this heuristic review, we describe why the apparent dichotomy between\nthose approaches has slowly faded away over the years. To support our\ndiscussion, we give an overview of different interpretations of a single\nequation, the diffusive Johnson-Segalman (dJS) equation, in the context of\nshear-banding. We restrict ourselves to dJS, but we show that the equation can\nbe written in various equivalent forms usually associated with opposite\napproaches.

Then we describe\nthe analogy between dJS and reaction-diffusion equations. In the case of\nanisotropic diffusion, we show how the dJS governing equations for steady shear\nflow are analogous to the equations of the dynamics of a particle in a quartic\npotential. Going beyond the existing literature, we then draw on the Lagrangian\nformalism to describe how the boundary conditions can have a key impact on the\nbanding state. Finally, we reinterpret the dJS equation again and we show that\na rigorous effective free energy can be constructed, in the spirit of early\nthermodynamic interpretations or in terms of more recent approaches exploiting\nthe language of irreversible thermodynamics.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 6 figures, tutorial review"]}]

The problem is really one of model-testing, and the relevant\nquantity is the Bayesian evidence (marginal likelihood) of the signal model.\nGiven a signal template and an ongoing data stream, we have developed an\nevidence-based filter that computes the Bayesian evidence that a signal is\npresent in the data. We demonstrate this algorithm by applying it to\nbrain-machine interface (BMI) data obtained by recording human brain electrical\nactivity, or electroencephalography (EEG).

The present model considers the confining\ncolor tube as the cylindrical quark gluon bag with non-zero surface tension. A\nclose inspection of the free energies of elongated cylindrical bag and the\nconfining color tube that connects the static quark-antiquark pair allows us to\nfind out the string tension in terms of the surface tension, thermal pressure\nand the bag radius. Using the derived relation it is possible to estimate the\nbag surface tension at zero temperature directly from the lattice QCD data and\nto estimate the (tri)critical endpoint temperature. In the present analysis the\ntopological free energy of the cylindrical bag is accounted for the first time.\nThe requirement of positive entropy density of such bags leads to negative\nvalues of the surface tension coefficient of quark gluon bags at the cross-over\nregion, i.e. at the continuous transition to deconfined quarks and gluons. We\nargue that the cross-over existence at supercritical temperatures in ordinary\nliquids is also provided by the negative surface tension coefficient values. It\nis shown that the confining tube model naturally accounts for an existence of a\nvery pronounced surprising maximum of the tube entropy observed in the lattice\nQCD simulations, which, as we argue, signals about the fractional surface\nformation of the confining tube. In addition, using the developed formalism we\nsuggest the gas of free tubes model and demonstrate that it contains two\nphases.\n","Comment: Plenary talk given at the International School-seminar NPQCD2011, 3-6\n  May 2011, Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine"]}]
