This makes it possible to test and compare\ndifferent analyses techniques. In this article, we propose a new fitting method\nbased on observations from one spacecraft, which we compare to the commonly\nused fitting method of Sheeley et al. (1999). We also compare the results from\nthese two fitting methods with those from two stereoscopic methods, focusing on\n12 CMEs observed simultaneously by the two STEREO spacecraft in 2008 and 2009.\nWe find evidence that the fitting method of Sheeley et al. (1999) can result in\nsignificant errors in the determination of the CME direction when the CME\npropagates outside of 60deg \\pm 20 deg from the Sun-spacecraft line. We expect\nour new fitting method to be better adapted to the analysis of halo or limb\nCMEs with respect to the observing spacecraft. We also find some evidence that\ndirect triangulation in the HI fields-of-view should only be applied to CMEs\npropagating approximatively towards Earth (\\pm 20deg from the Sun-Earth line).\nLast, we address one of the possible sources of errors of fitting methods: the\nassumption of radial propagation. Using stereoscopic methods, we find that at\nleast seven of the 12 studied CMEs had an heliospheric deflection of less than\n20deg as they propagated in the HI fields-of-view, which, we believe, validates\nthis approximation.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, accepted to Solar Physics"]}]

For all\nvalues of the temperature of the thermal reservoir, an initial separable\nGaussian state remains separable for all times.

Only for a zero temperature of the thermal bath the initial\nentangled state remains entangled for finite times. We analyze the time\nevolution of the Gaussian quantum discord, which is a measure of all quantum\ncorrelations in the bipartite state, including entanglement, and show that\nquantum discord decays asymptotically in time under the effect of the thermal\nbath. This is contrast with the sudden death of entanglement. Before the\nsuppression of the entanglement, the qualitative evolution of quantum discord\nis very similar to that of the entanglement.

The problem\nreduces to estimate a quadratic form (called \"localization function\") of a\ncertain projection matrix related to the source signal empirical covariance\nmatrix. Recently, a new subspace estimation method (called \"G-MUSIC\") has been\nproposed, in the context where the number of available samples $N$ is of the\nsame order of magnitude than the number of sensors $M$. In this context, the\ntraditional subspace methods tend to fail because the empirical covariance\nmatrix of the observations is a poor estimate of the source signal covariance\nmatrix. The G-MUSIC method is based on a new consistent estimator of the\nlocalization function in the regime where $M$ and $N$ tend to $+\\infty$ at the\nsame rate. However, the consistency of the angles estimator was not adressed.\nThe purpose of this paper is to prove the consistency of the angles of arrival\nestimator in the previous asymptotic regime.

We find that in water the inter-micellar\nexchange of these block copolymers is very slow so that the self-assembled\nstructures are in local but not global equilibrium (i.e., they are\nnon-ergodic). This opens up the possibility of controlling micelle morphology\nboth thermodynamically and kinetically. Specifically, when the two species are\nfirst dissolved in THF before mixing and self-assembly (`premixing') by\ndilution with water, the morphology is found to depend on the mixing ratio of\nthe two species, going gradually from vesicles via `bulbed' rods, rings,\nY-junctions and finally to spherical micelles as we increase the proportion of\nthe sphere-formers. On the other hand, if the two species are first partially\nself-assembled (by partial exchange of the solvent with water) before mixing\nand further self-assembly (`intermediate mixing'), novel metastable structures,\nincluding nanoscopic pouches, emerge. These experimental results are\ncorroborated by self-consistent field theory calculations (SCFT) which\nreproduce the sequence of morphologies seen in the pre-mixing experiments. SCFT\nalso reveals a clear coupling between polymer composition and aggregate\ncurvature, with regions of positive and negative curvature being stabilized by\nan enrichment and depletion of sphere formers respectively.

It is shown that\nthe intensification of tropical storm with the redistribution of wind\nvelocities, pressure and temperature can result from the reorganization of the\ndissipative structure which key parameters are the moist air lifting velocity\nand the temperature of surrounding atmosphere. This reorganization can lead to\nformation of hurricane eye and inner ring of convection. A transition of the\ndissipative structure in a new state can occur when the temperature lapse rate\nin a zone of air lifting reaches certain critical value. The accordance of\nobservational data with the proposed theoretical description is shown.\n","Comment: 15 pages,7 figures"]}]

One\noutstanding possibility is that there is a gravitational repulsion between\nmatter and antimatter (in short we call it antigravity). We argue that in the\ncase of antigravity the collapse of a black hole doesn't end with singularity\nand that deep inside the horizon, the gravitational field may be sufficiently\nstrong to create (from the vacuum) neutrino-antineutrino pairs of all flavours.\nThe created antineutrinos (neutrinos) should be violently ejected outside the\nhorizon of a black hole composed from matter (antimatter). Our rudimentary\ncalculations suggest that both, the supermassive black hole in the centre of\nour Galaxy and in the centre of the Andromeda Galaxy may produce a flux of\nantineutrinos measurable with the new generation of one cubic kilometre\nneutrino telescopes. In addition, we suggest two signatures of antigravity in\nthe case of microscopic black holes which may be eventually produced at CERN:\nthe decay products should exhibit a strong matter-antimatter asymmetry and the\nHawking radiation should not be the main mechanism for decay.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in \"Advanced Studies in Theoretical\n  Physics\", Vol. 5, 2011"]}]
