The model consists of a global spherical shell of differentially\nrotating fluid, which has a deformable top, thus allowing motions in radial\ndirections along with latitude and longitude directions. When the system is\nperturbed, in the course of its nonlinear evolution it can generate unstable\nlow-frequency shallow-water shear modes from the differential rotation,\nhigh-frequency gravity waves, and their interactions. Radiative and overshoot\ntachoclines are characterized in this model by high and low effective gravity\nvalues respectively. Building a semi-implicit spectral scheme containing very\nlow numerical diffusion, we perform nonlinear evolution of shallow-water modes.\nOur first results show that, (i) high latitude jets or polar spin-up occurs due\nto nonlinear evolution of unstable hydrodynamic shallow-water disturbances and\ndifferential rotation, (ii) Reynolds stresses in the disturbances together with\nchanging shell-thickness and meridional flow are responsible for the evolution\nof differential rotation, (iii) disturbance energy primarily remains\nconcentrated in the lowest longitudinal wavenumbers, (iv) an oscillation in\nenergy between perturbed and unperturbed states occurs due to evolution of\nthese modes in a nearly dissipation-free system, and (v) disturbances are\ngeostrophic, but occasional nonadjustment in geostrophic balance can occur,\nparticularly in the case of high effective gravity, leading to generation of\ngravity waves.

Moreover, the decrease in feature size has led to higher\nsusceptibility to process variations, leading to reliability issues and\nlowering yield.

A fundamental technique that can be used to generate\nsamples from virtually any target probability distribution is the so-called\nrejection sampling method, which generates candidate samples from a proposal\ndistribution and then accepts them or not by testing the ratio of the target\nand proposal densities. The class of adaptive rejection sampling (ARS)\nalgorithms is particularly interesting because they can achieve high acceptance\nrates. However, the standard ARS method can only be used with log-concave\ntarget densities. For this reason, many generalizations have been proposed.\n  In this work, we investigate two different adaptive schemes that can be used\nto draw exactly from a large family of univariate probability density functions\n(pdf's), not necessarily log-concave, possibly multimodal and with tails of\narbitrary concavity. These techniques are adaptive in the sense that every time\na candidate sample is rejected, the acceptance rate is improved. The two\nproposed algorithms can work properly when the target pdf is multimodal, with\nfirst and second derivatives analytically intractable, and when the tails are\nlog-convex in a infinite domain.

Our\ngoal is to study extreme particle acceleration and {\\gamma}-ray production\nabove 100 MeV during special spectral states of Cyg X- 3 usually characterized\nby a low hard X-ray flux and enhanced soft X-ray states. We observed Cyg X-3\nwith the AGILE satellite in extended time intervals from 2009 Jun.-Jul., and\n2009 Nov.-2010 Jul. We report here the results of the AGILE {\\gamma}-ray\nmonitoring of Cyg X-3 as well as the results from extensive multiwavelength\ncampaigns involving radio (RATAN-600, AMI-LA and Mets\\\"{a}hovi Radio\nObservatories) and X-ray monitoring data (XTE and Swift). We detect a series of\nrepeated {\\gamma}-ray flaring activity from Cyg X-3 that correlate with the\nsoft X-ray states and episodes of decreasing or non-detectable hard X-ray\nemission. Furthermore, we detect {\\gamma}-ray enhanced emission that tends to\nbe associated with radio flares greater than 1 Jy at 15 GHz, confirming a trend\nalready detected in previous observations. The source remained active above 100\nMeV for an extended period of time (almost 1.5 months in 2009 Jun.-Jul. and 1\nmonth in 2010 May). We study in detail the short timescale {\\gamma}-ray flares\nthat occurred before or near the radio peaks. Our results confirm the transient\nnature of the extreme particle acceleration from the microquasar Cyg X-3. A\nseries of repeated {\\gamma}-ray flares shows correlations with radio and X-ray\nemission confirming a well established trend of emission. We compare our\nresults with Fermi-LAT and MAGIC TeV observations of Cyg X-3.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables; A&A (2011)"]}]

We also describe\nalternative regression models in which informative prediction intervals can be\nfound before the number of observations exceeds the number of parameters. One\nof these models, which only assumes that the observations are independent and\nidentically distributed, is popular in machine learning but greatly underused\nin the statistical theory of regression.\n","Comment: 34 pages; 6 figures; 1 table. arXiv admin note: substantial text\n  overlap with arXiv:0906.3123"]}]
