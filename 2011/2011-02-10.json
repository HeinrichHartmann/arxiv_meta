About half of this\nbackground, called the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) is emitted in the\n8-1000 microns range, and peaks around 150 microns. It is due to the dust\nreemission from star formation processes and AGN emission. The CIB spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) constraints the models of star formation in the\nUniverse. It is also useful to compute the opacity of the Universe to the TeV\nphotons.\n  We present the different types of measurements of the CIB and discuss their\nstrengths and weaknesses.\n  1. The absolute SED was measured by COBE, and by other experiments. These\nmeasurements are limited by the accuracy of the component separation, i.e. the\nforeground subtraction.\n  2. Robust lower limits are determined from the extragalactic number counts of\ninfrared galaxies. These lower limits are very stringent up to 100 microns. At\nlarger wavelengths, the rather low angular resolution of the instruments limits\nstrongly the depth of the number counts. The \"stacking\" method determines the\nflux emitted at a given wavelength by a population detected at another\nwavelength, and provides stringent lower limits in the sub-mm range. It is\ncomplementary with other methods based on the statistical analysis of the map\nproperties like the P(D) analysis.\n  3. Finally, upper limits can be derived from the high energy spectra of\nextragalactic sources. These upper limits give currently good constraints in\nthe near- and mid-IR.\n  Progress have been amazing since the CIB discovery about 15 years ago: the\nSED is much better known, and most of it can be accounted for by galaxies\n(directly or indirectly).
