We have constructed the Killing potential, extension of the\npotential in the SO(2N)/U(N) coset space to that in the SO(2N+2)/U(N+1) coset\nspace. It is equivalent to the generalized density matrix whose diagonal-block\npart is related to a reduced scalar potential with a Fayet-Ilipoulos term.

We illustrate this on the basis of several examples: a small\nperturbation propagating down a steady string, a massless particle falling into\nAdS_5, and the decay of a time-like wave-packet. A similar observation was made\nin Phys. Rev. D81 (2010) 126001 for the case of a rotating string. In all these\ncases, the absence of broadening is related to the fact that the energy\nbackreaction on the boundary arises exclusively from the bulk perturbation at,\nor near, the boundary. This is so since bulk sources which propagate in AdS_5\nat the speed of light do not generate any energy on the boundary.

This gives a 4d\nconstruction of \"axion monodromy inflation\": the axion winds many times over\nthe course of inflation and draws energy from the 4-form. The classical theory\nis equivalent to chaotic inflation with a quadratic inflaton potential. Such\nmodels can produce \"high scale\" inflation driven by energy densities of the\norder of $(10^{16}\\ GeV)^4$, which produces primordial gravitational waves\npotentially accessible to CMB polarization experiments.

Bromination opens a small (86meV) band gap and strongly\ndopes the graphene.

Agents are connected on a network and can be in one of two states of the\nworld, 0 or 1. Initially, all are in state 0 and a small number of seeds are\nselected at random to switch to state1. A simple threshold rule specifies\nwhether other agents switch subsequently. The cascade size (the percolation) is\nthe proportion of all agents which eventually switches to state 1. We select\ninformation on the connectivity of the initial seeds, the connectivity of the\nagents to which they are connected, the thresholds of these latter agents, and\nthe thresholds of the agents to which these are connected. We obtain results\nfor random, small world and scale -free networks with different network\nparameters and numbers of initial seeds. The results are robust with respect to\nthese factors. We perform least squares regression of the logit transformation\nof the cascade size (Hosmer and Lemeshow 1989) on these potential explanatory\nvariables. We find considerable explanatory power for the ex ante prediction of\ncascade sizes. For the random networks, on average 32 per cent of the variance\nof the cascade sizes is explained, 40 per cent for the small world and 46 per\ncent for the scale-free. The connectivity variables are hardly ever significant\nin the regressions, whether relating to the seeds themselves or to the agents\nconnected to the seeds. In contrast, the information on the thresholds of\nagents contains much more explanatory power.
