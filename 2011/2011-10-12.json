Traditionally, all the CG iteration vectors could\nbe saved and recombined through the eigenvectors of the tridiagonal projection\nmatrix, which is equivalent theoretically to unrestarted Lanczos. Our algorithm\ncapitalizes on the iteration vectors produced by CG to update only a small\nwindow of vectors that approximate the eigenvectors. While this window is\nrestarted in a locally optimal way, the CG algorithm for the linear system is\nunaffected. Yet, in all our experiments, this small window converges to the\nrequired eigenvectors at a rate identical to unrestarted Lanczos. After the\nsolution of the linear system, eigenvectors that have not accurately converged\ncan be improved in an incremental fashion by solving additional linear systems.\nIn this case, eigenvectors identified in earlier systems can be used to\ndeflate, and thus accelerate, the convergence of subsequent systems. We have\nused this algorithm with excellent results in lattice QCD applications, where\nhundreds of right hand sides may be needed. Specifically, about 70 eigenvectors\nare obtained to full accuracy after solving 24 right hand sides. Deflating\nthese from the large number of subsequent right hand sides removes the dreaded\ncritical slowdown, where the conditioning of the matrix increases as the quark\nmass reaches a critical value. Our experiments show almost a constant number of\niterations for our method, regardless of quark mass, and speedups of 8 over\noriginal CG for light quark masses.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 26 eps figures"]}]

The phenomenology is complex and will\npresent a challenge for numerical simulations to reproduce. With new, multiband\nHST imaging, we identify 34 strongly-lensed images of 11 galaxies around the\nmassive Southern `core'. Combining this with weak lensing data from HST, VLT\nand Subaru, we produce the most detailed mass map of this cluster to date. We\nalso perform an independent analysis of archival Chandra X-ray imaging. Our\nanalyses support a recent claim that the Southern core and Northwestern\nsubstructure are post-merger and exhibit morphology similar to the Bullet\nCluster viewed from an angle. From the separation between X-ray emitting gas\nand lensing mass in the Southern core, we derive a new and independent\nconstraint on the self-interaction cross section of dark matter particles\nsigma/m <~ 3 \\pm 1 cm^2 g^-1. In the Northwestern substructure, the gas, dark\nmatter, and galaxy components have become separated by much larger distances.\nMost curiously, the `ghost' clump (primarily gas) leads the `dark' clump\n(primarily dark matter) by more than 150 kpc. We propose an enhanced\n`ram-pressure slingshot' scenario which may have yielded this reversal of\ncomponents with such a large separation, but needs further confirmation by\nfollow-up observations and numerical simulations. A secondary merger involves a\nsecond `bullet' clump in the North and an extremely `stripped' clump to the\nWest.

Previous conclusions regarding the energy, angular (pitch\nangle) and spatial distributions of energetic electrons in solar flares are\ncritically reviewed.

This unprecedented quality of data allows for the first\ntime inference of the angular distributions of the X-ray-emitting electrons\nusing albedo, improved model-independent inference of electron energy spectra\nand emission measures of thermal plasma. Moreover, imaging spectroscopy has\nrevealed hitherto unknown details of solar flare morphology and detailed\nspectroscopy of coronal, footpoint and extended sources in flaring regions.\nAdditional attempts to measure hard X-ray polarization were not sufficient to\nput constraints on the degree of anisotropy of electrons, but point to the\nimportance of obtaining good quality polarization data.\n","Comment: This is an article for a monograph on the physics of solar flares,\n  inspired by RHESSI observations.

A second stream of research\ninvestigated symbolic formalisms providing a set of algebraic operators to\ndefine granularities in a compact and compositional way. However, only very\nlimited manipulation algorithms have been proposed to operate directly on the\nalgebraic representation making it unsuitable to use the symbolic formalisms in\napplications that need manipulation of granularities.\n  This paper aims at filling the gap between the results from these two streams\nof research, by providing an efficient conversion from the algebraic\nrepresentation to the equivalent low-level representation based on the\nmathematical models. In addition, the conversion returns a minimal\nrepresentation in terms of period length.

The conductance modulation of\nthe SFET as a function of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling strength is\nnumerically examined for the number of channels ranging from a few to close to\n100. Even with the ideal spin injector and collector, the conductance\nmodulation ratio, defined as the ratio between the maximum and minimum\nconductances, decays rapidly and approaches one with the increase of the\nchannel number. It turns out that the decay is considerably faster when the\nRashba spin-orbit coupling is larger. Effects of the electronic coherence are\nalso examined in the multi-channel regime and it is found that the coherent\nFabry-Perot-like interference in the multi-channel regime gives rise to a\nnested peak structure. For a nonideal spin injector/collector structure, which\nconsists of a conventional metallic ferromagnet-thin insulator-2DEG\nheterostructure, the Rashba-coupling-induced conductance modulation is strongly\naffected by large resonance peaks that arise from the electron confinement\neffect of the insulators. Finally scattering effects are briefly addressed and\nit is found that in the weakly diffusive regime, the positions of the resonance\npeaks fluctuate, making the conductance modulation signal sample-dependent.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 15 figures"]}]
