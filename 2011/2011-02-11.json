In this\npaper, we study the properties of NGC 2770 and specifically the three SN sites\nto investigate whether this galaxy is in any way peculiar to cause a high\nfrequency of SNe Ib. We model the global SED of the galaxy from broadband data\nand derive a star-formation and SN rate comparable to the values of the Milky\nWay. We further study the galaxy using longslit spectroscopy covering the major\naxis and the three SN sites. From the spectroscopic study we find subsolar\nmetallicities for the SN sites, a high extinction and a moderate star-formation\nrate. In a high resolution spectrum, we also detect diffuse interstellar bands\nin the line-of-sight towards SN 2008. A comparison of NGC 2770 to the global\nproperties of a galaxy sample with high SN occurance (at least 3 SN in the last\n100 years) suggests that NGC 2770 is not particularly destined to produce such\nan enhancement of observed SNe observed. Its properties are also very different\nfrom gamma-ray burst host galaxies. Statistical considerations on SN Ib\ndetection rates give a probability of ~1.5% to find a galaxy with three Ib SNe\ndetected in 10 years. The high number of rare Ib SNe in this galaxy is\ntherefore likely to be a coincidence rather than special properties of the\ngalaxy itself.

To address this shortcoming we have\nadded a block-structured \"cubed-sphere\" grid option to the Cosmos++ GRMHD code,\nwhich will allow us to simultaneously resolve the disk and polar regions. Here\nwe present our implementation of this grid and the results of a small suite of\nvalidation tests intended to demonstrate that the new grid performs as\nexpected. The most important test in this work is a comparison of identical\ntilted disks, one evolved using our spherical-polar grid and the other with the\ncubed-sphere grid. We also demonstrate an interesting dependence of the\nearly-time evolution of our disks on their orientation with respect to the grid\nalignment. This dependence arises from the differing treatment of current\nsheets within the disks, especially whether they are aligned with symmetry\nplanes of the grid or not.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 11 figures, submitted to ApJ"]}]

Thus, krypton and xenon\nmay have been sequestrated in the form of XH3+ complexes in the solar nebula\ngas phase, causing the formation of noble gas-poor planetesimals ultimately\naccreted by Titan. Alternatively, krypton and xenon may have also been trapped\nefficiently in clathrates located on the satellite's surface or in its\natmospheric haze.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal"]}]

The polarization\nangle of the integrated emission is aligned with the apparent minor axis of the\ndisk for galaxies without a bar. In our axially symmetric models, the\npolarization angle of the integrated emission is independent of wavelength.\nSimulated distributions of fractional polarization for randomly oriented spiral\ngalaxies at 4.8 GHz and 1.4 GHz are presented. We conclude that polarization\nmeasurements, e.g. with the SKA, of unresolved spiral galaxies allow\nstatistical studies of the magnetic field in disk galaxies using large samples\nin the local universe and at high redshift. As these galaxies behave as\nidealized background sources without internal Faraday rotation, they can be\nused to detect large-scale magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 6 figures; Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical\n  Journal"]}]

The extremely\nbright prompt optical emission revealed features that are normally not\ndetectable. The optical and gamma-ray variability during the explosion are\ncorrelated, but the optical flux is much greater than can be reconciled with\nsingle emission mechanism and a flat gamma-ray spectrum. This extreme optical\nbehavior is best understood as synchrotron self-Compton model (SSC). After a\ngradual onset of the gamma-ray emission, there is an abrupt rise of the prompt\noptical flux suggesting that variable self-absorption dominates the early\noptical light curve. Our simultaneous multi-color optical light curves\nfollowing the flash show spectral evolution consistent with a rapidly decaying\nred component due to large angle emission and the emergence of a blue forward\nshock component from interaction with the surrounding environment.

Moreover, we screen disk parent bodies for dynamical\nstability over the system age of 100 Myr, and model them separately from their\ndust grain progeny; the latter's orbits are strongly affected by radiation\npressure and their lifetimes are limited to 0.1 Myr by destructive grain-grain\ncollisions.

We test the proposed method using model star clusters, which\nare constructed to be segregated on the basis of a Monte Carlo technique, and\non Hubble Space Telescope observations of mass-segregated star clusters in\norder to explore the limitations of the method in relation to actual data. We\nconclude that the method performs efficiently in the detection of stellar\nstratification and its results do not depend on the data, provided that\nincompleteness has been accurately measured and the contamination by the field\npopulation has been thoroughly removed. Our diagnosis method is also\nindependent of any model or theoretical prediction, in contrast to the\n`classical' methods used so far for the detection of mass segregation.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in the 2009/02 issue of ApJ. 13 pages\n  emulateapj.cls LaTeX style, 10 low-resolution greyscale figures"]}]

We find\nthat gas in this ridge has a similar temperature (~0.6 keV) and abundance (~0.3\nsolar) to the surrounding diffuse emission, and that a hard emission component\nis consistent with that expected from high-mass X-ray binaries associated with\nstar-formation in the ridge. The cooling rate of gas in the ridge is consistent\nwith the current star formation rate, suggesting that radiative cooling is\ndriving the observed star formation. The lack of a high-temperature gas\ncomponent is used to place constraints on the nature of the interaction and\nshock, and we find that an oblique shock heating a pre-existing filament of HI\nmay be the most likely explanation of the X-ray gas in the ridge. The mass of\nhot gas in the ridge is only ~2 per cent of the total mass of hot gas in the\ngroup, which is roughly equal to the deficit in observed HI mass compared to\npredictions. The hot gas component is too extended to have been heated by the\ncurrent interaction, strongly suggesting that it must have been heated during\nprevious dynamical encounters.\n","Comment: Revised in view of referee's comments, added section 2.1 and fig. 1.\n  Accepted for publication in ApJ, 9 pages, 4 colour and 3 grayscale figures"]}]

This mechanism is of particular interest for hot\nJupiters because it relies upon a rocky core, and because these bodies are\notherwise largely convective.

This theory has not been subject to rigorous\nnumerical testing because conventional MHD numerical models contain numerical\ndiffusion, which introduces uncontrolled numerical reconnection. We use a\nquasi-Lagrangian simulation technique to run the first controlled experiments\nof CME initiation in the complete lack of reconnection. We find that a flux\nrope confined by an arcade, when twisted beyond a critical amount, can escape\nto an open state, allowing some of the surrounding arcade to shrink and\nreleasing magnetic energy from the global field. This mechanism includes a true\nideal MHD instability. We conclude that reconnection is not a necessary trigger\nfor fast CME eruptions.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 5 figures"]}]

Many studies of the\nSFR at intermediate redshifts have been made as a function of the integrated\nstellar mass of galaxies but these did not use information on the internal\nstructural properties of the galaxies. In this paper we present a comparative\nstudy of the dependence of SFRs on the average surface mass densities (SigmaM)\nof galaxies of different morphological types up to z~1 using the zCOSMOS and\nSDSS surveys. The main findings about the evolution of these relatively massive\ngalaxies are: 1) There is evidence that, for both SDSS ans zCOSMOS galaxies,\nthe mean specific SFR within a given population (either disk-dominated or\nbulge-dominated) is independent of SigmaM; 2) The observed SSFR - SigmaM\nstep-function relation is due, at all investigated redshifts, to the changing\nmix of disk-dominated and bulge-dominated galaxies as surface density increases\nand the strong difference in the average SSFR between disks and bulges. We also\nfind a modest differential evolution in the size-mass relations of disk and\nspheroid galaxies; 3) The shape of the median SSFR - SigmaM relation is\nsimilar, but with median SSFR values that are about 5-6 times higher in zCOSMOS\ngalaxies than for SDSS, across the whole range of SigmaM, and in both spheroid\nand disk galaxies. This increase matches that of the global SFRD of the\nUniverse as a whole, emphasizing that galaxies of all types are contributing,\nproportionally, to the global increase in SFRD in the Universe back to these\nredshifts (abridged).\n","Comment: Published 2009 in ApJ, 694, 1099"]}]

The core of 3C\n433 is extended in hard X-rays, presumably due to X-ray emission from the\ninner-jet knot on the FR I side that is apparent in the radio map. It is\npossible that the X-ray emission from this inner-jet knot is absorbed by the\ndust known to be present in the host galaxy.

If these three starbursts\nare typical of starbursts in dwarf galaxies, then the short timescales (3 - 10\nMyr) associated with starbursts in previous studies are best understood as\n\"flickering\" events which are simply small components of the larger starburst.\nIn this sample of three nearby dwarfs, the bursts are not localized events. All\nthree systems show bursting levels of star formation in regions of both high\nand low stellar density. The enhanced star formation moves around the galaxy\nduring the bursts and covers a large fraction of the area of the galaxy. These\nmassive, long duration bursts can significantly affect the structure, dynamics,\nand chemical evolution of the host galaxy and can be the progenitors of\n\"superwinds\" that drive much of the recently chemically enriched material from\nthe galaxy into the intergalactic medium.\n","Comment: 41 pages, 14 figures, ApJ, Accepted"]}]

The second scaling is p/p ratios are almost constant, where the\nsecond $p$-nuclei are lighter than the first p-nucleus by two neutrons.

We have calculated the ratios by gamma-process based on\ncore-collapse supernova explosion models under various astrophysical conditions\nand found that the scalings hold for materials produced by individual\ngamma-processes independent of the astrophysical conditions assumed. The\nuniversality originates from three mechanisms: the shifts of the gamma-process\nlayers to keep their peak temperature, the weak s-process in pre-supernovae,\nand the independence of the s/p ratios of the nuclear reactions. The results\nfurther suggest an extended universality that the s/p ratios in the\ngamma-process layers are not only constant but also centered on a specific\nvalue of 3. With this specific value and the first scaling, we estimate that\nthe ratios of $s$-process abundance contributions from the AGB stars to the\nmassive stars are almost 6.7 for the $s$-nuclei of A > 90.

(2008) concerning\na noticeable hemispherical power asymmetry in the WMAP data on small angular\nscales, we revisit the dipole modulated signal model introduced by Gordon et\nal. (2005). This model assumes that the true CMB signal consists of a Gaussian\nisotropic random field modulated by a dipole, and is characterized by an\noverall modulation amplitude, A, and a preferred direction, p. Previous\nanalyses of this model has been restricted to very low resolution due to\ncomputational cost. In this paper, we double the angular resolution, and\ncompute the full corresponding posterior distribution for the 5-year WMAP data.\nThe results from our analysis are the following: The best-fit modulation\namplitude for l <= 64 and the ILC data with the WMAP KQ85 sky cut is A=0.072\n+/- 0.022, non-zero at 3.3sigma, and the preferred direction points toward\nGalactic coordinates (l,b) = (224 degree, -22 degree) +/- 24 degree. The\ncorresponding results for l <~ 40 from earlier analyses was A = 0.11 +/- 0.04\nand (l,b) = (225 degree,-27 degree). The statistical significance of a non-zero\namplitude thus increases from 2.8sigma to 3.3sigma when increasing l_max from\n40 to 64, and all results are consistent to within 1sigma. Similarly, the\nBayesian log-evidence difference with respect to the isotropic model increases\nfrom Delta ln E = 1.8 to Delta ln E = 2.6, ranking as \"strong evidence\" on the\nJeffreys' scale. The raw best-fit log-likelihood difference increases from\nDelta ln L = 6.1 to Delta ln L = 7.3. Similar, and often slightly stronger,\nresults are found for other data combinations.

To date a few polarization measurements have been reported, claiming of\na high degree of polarization in the prompt emission of GRBs but with low\nstatistical evidence.\n  We used the IBIS telescope on board the INTEGRAL satellite to measure the\npolarization of the prompt gamma-ray emission of the long and bright GRB\n041219A in the 200-800 keV energy band. We find a variable degree of\npolarization ranging from less than 4% over the first peak to 43+/-25% for the\nwhole second peak. Time resolved analysis of both peaks indicates a high degree\nof polarization, and the null average polarization in the first peak can be\nexplained by the rapid variations observed in the polarization angle and\ndegree.\n  Our results are consistent with different models for the prompt emission of\nGRBs at these energies, but they favor synchrotron radiation from a\nrelativistic outflow with a magnetic field which is coherent on an angular size\ncomparable with the angular size of the emitting region (~1/Gamma) . Indeed\nthis model has the best capabilities to maintain a high polarization level, and\nto produce the observed variability.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in the Astrophysical\n  Journal Letters"]}]

Our mid-infrared observations\nof these lensed images have revealed that the mid-infrared flux ratio for A2/A1\nof MG0414+0534 is nearly unity (0.90 +- 0.04).

We find that the effects of high ratios of impinging\nionizing radiation density to particle density (i.e. high ionization\nparameters, or U) can reproduce many ULIRG observational characteristics.\nPhysically, as U increases, the fraction of UV photons absorbed by dust\nincreases, corresponding to fewer photons available to photoionize and heat the\ngas, producing what is known as a \"dust-bounded\" nebula. We show that high U\neffects can explain the \"[C II] deficit\", the ~1 dex drop in the [C II] 158\nmicron /FIR ratio seen in ULIRGs when compared to starburst or normal galaxies.\nAdditionally, by increasing U through increasing the ionizing photon flux,\nwarmer dust and thus higher IRAS F(60)/F(100) ratios result. High U effects\nalso predict an increase in [O I]63 micron /[C II] 158 micron and a gradual\ndecline in [O III] 88 micron /FIR, similar to the magnitude of the trends\nobserved, and yield a reasonable fit to [Ne V]14 micron /FIR ratio AGN\nobservations.\n","Comment: 34 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in the Astrophysical\n  Journal"]}]

Within the corotation\nradius (Rcr), the disk J remains nearly constant, as long as Rcr stays within\nthe disk -- a sign that the lost J to the outer disk and the halo is being\ncompensated by an influx of fresh J due to the outward motion of Rcr. This is\nfeasible as long as the bar slowdown dominates the loss of J inside Rcr. We\nfind that in some models the bar pattern speed stalls for prolonged time\nperiods when Rcr is located outside the disk.

The model calculates the streamlines' forced orbit elements and surface\ndensity throughout the perturbed ring. The model is then applied to the outer\nedge of Saturn's B ring, which is maintained by an m=2 inner LR with the\nsatellite Mimas.

A comparison of models to\nthe observed outer B ring suggests that the ring's surface density there is\nbetween 10 and 280 gm/cm^2.

Nonetheless, the\nfollowing shows that a torque balance can still be achieved in a viscous B\nring, but only in an extreme case where the ratio of the ring's bulk/shear\nviscosities satisfy ~10^4.

The increase of the field intensity generates a\nlarger dead zone in the wind, i. e., the closed loops that inhibit matter to\nescape from latitudes lower than ~45 degrees extend farther away from the star.\nThe Lorentz force leads naturally to a latitude-dependent wind. We show that by\nincreasing the density and maintaining B0=20G, the system recover back to\nslower and cooler winds. For a fixed gamma, we show that the key parameter in\ndetermining the wind velocity profile is the beta-parameter at the coronal\nbase. Therefore, there is a group of magnetized flows that would present the\nsame terminal velocity despite of its thermal and magnetic energy densities, as\nlong as the plasma-beta parameter is the same. This degeneracy, however, can be\nremoved if we compare other physical parameters of the wind, such as the\nmass-loss rate. We analyze the influence of gamma in our results and we show\nthat it is also important in determining the wind structure.

The aim of this paper is to\nexplore to what extent this mechanism can account for the initiation of CMEs in\nthe global context. A simplified MHD model for the global coronal magnetic\nfield evolution in response to flux emergence and shearing by large-scale\nsurface motions is described and motivated. Using automated algorithms for\ndetecting flux ropes and ejections in the global magnetic model, the effects of\nkey simulation parameters on the formation of flux ropes and the number of\nejections are considered, over a 177-day period in 1999. These key parameters\ninclude the magnitude and sign of magnetic helicity emerging in active regions,\nand coronal diffusion. The number of flux ropes found in the simulation at any\none time fluctuates between about 28 and 48, sustained by the emergence of new\nbipolar regions, but with no systematic dependence on the helicity of these\nregions. However, the emerging helicity does affect the rate of flux rope\nejections, which doubles from 0.67 per day if the bipoles emerge untwisted to\n1.28 per day in the run with greatest emerging twist. The number of ejections\nin the simulation is also increased by 20%-30% by choosing the majority sign of\nemerging bipole helicity in each hemisphere, or by halving the turbulent\ndiffusivity in the corona. For reasonable parameter choices, the model produces\napproximately 50% of the observed CME rate.

In particular,\nwe focus on 1) the central black hole to stellar mass ratio of the host galaxy,\n2) the lifetime of the luminous quasar phase, 3) the mass of stars formed in\nthe host galaxy within the last Gyr, and 4) the X-ray luminosity of the hot\ndiffuse gas. As a result, we try to pin down the most successful range of\nmechanical feedback efficiencies. We find that while low feedback efficiencies\nresult in too much growth of the SMBH, high efficiencies totally blow out the\nhot interstellar gas, and the models are characterized by very low thermal\nX-ray luminosity well below the observed range. The net lifetime of the quasar\nphase is strongly coupled to the mass ratio between SMBH and its host galaxy,\nwhile the X-ray luminosity is generally correlated to the recent star formation\nwithin the last Gyr. When considering the popularly adopted model of the\nconstant feedback efficiency, the feedback energy deposited into the ambient\nmedium should be more than 0.01% of the SMBH accretion energy to be consistent\nwith the SMBH mass to stellar mass ratio in the local universe.

On\nphase-induced amplitude apodization (PIAA) type coronagraphs, it can\nunambiguously recover aberrations which originate from either side of the beam\nshaping introduced by the PIAA optics. We show that the proposed CLOWFS can\nmeasure sub-milliarcsecond telescope pointing errors several orders of\nmagnitude faster than would be possible in the coronagraphic science focal\nplane alone, and can also accurately calibrate residual coronagraphic leaks due\nto residual low order aberrations. We have demonstrated 1e-3 lambda/D pointing\nstability in a laboratory demonstration of the CLOWFS on a PIAA type\ncoronagraph.\n"]}]

The dynamics\nof a SDE are governed by the deterministic term (drift) and the stochastic term\n(noise).

Despite extensive studies, however, the optical light curve\nhas never been discussed and its redshift is unconstrained. Possible\ncorrelations between optical and X-ray data are analysed. Methods: Photometric\ndata from TNG in the R and I bands were used to compare the optical afterglow\nwith the X-ray light curve. The HyperZ package and a late time VLT host\nobservation were used to derive redshift estimates. Results: The I-band\nafterglow decay followed a power-law of index {\\alpha} = 2.1 $\\pm$ 0.6, after a\nlate break at ~ $1.3 \\times 10^5$ s. The R - I color is remarkably red and the\nbroadband spectral index {\\beta}_OX = $0.9 \\pm 0.1$ is consistent with the\nX-ray spectral slope {\\beta}_X. Although a photometric redshift of z > 4 is the\nmost conservative result to consider, a photometric redshift of z = 5.2 $\\pm$\n0.3 is suggested with no extinction in the host, based on which an isotropic\nenergy E_{\\gamma},iso = $(3.8 \\pm 0.7) \\times 10^52$ erg and a jet opening\nangle {\\theta} ~ $3.7^{\\circ}$ are subsequently derived.\n  Conclusions: The combined X-ray and optical data suggest an achromatic break,\nwhich we interpret as a jet break. The post jet break slope obeys roughly the\nclosure relation for the jet slow cooling model. Because of the afterglow's\nvery red color, in order for the redshift to be low (z < 1), extinction, if\npresent in the host, must be significantly high. Since the optical-to-X-ray\nindex is consistent with the X-ray spectrum, and there is no XRT evidence for\nexcess N_H, GRB 050502B was likely at high redshift.\n"]}]

Parameter perturbations on the right-hand side of the inequalities are\nrequired to be merely bounded, and thus the natural parameter space is\n$l_{\\infty}(J)$. Our basic strategy consists of linearizing the parameterized\nconvex system via splitting convex inequalities into linear ones by using the\nFenchel-Legendre conjugate. This approach yields that arbitrary bounded\nright-hand side perturbations of the convex system turn on constant-by-blocks\nperturbations in the linearized system. Based on advanced variational analysis,\nwe derive a precise formula for computing the exact Lipschitzian bound of the\nfeasible solution map of block-perturbed linear systems, which involves only\nthe system's data, and then show that this exact bound agrees with the\ncoderivative norm of the aforementioned mapping. In this way we extend to the\nconvex setting the results of [3] developed for arbitrary perturbations with no\nblock structure in the linear framework under the boundedness assumption on the\nsystem's coefficients. The latter boundedness assumption is removed in this\npaper when the decision space is reflexive. The last section provides the aimed\napplication to the convex case.\n"]}]

The results are also\nconsistent with observations of type I X-ray bursts. At accretion rates Mdot <\n0.1 Mdot_Edd, thermonuclear He burning via the well-known thin-shell thermal\ninstability triggers bursts. As Mdot increases, however, the trigger mechanism\nevolves from the fast thermal instability to a slowly growing overstability\ninvolving both H and He burning. The competition between nuclear heating via\nthe beta-limited CNO cycle and the triple-alpha process on the one hand, and\nradiative cooling via photon diffusion and emission on the other hand, drives\noscillations with a period approximately equal to the H-burning timescale. If\nthese oscillations grow, the gradually rising temperature at the base of the\nhelium layer eventually provokes a thin-shell thermal instability and hence a\ndelayed mixed burst.

A long-standing question regarding this mechanism is how to stop the\nmigration before planets plunge into their central stars. In this paper, we\npropose a new, simple mechanism to significantly slow down planet migration,\nand test the possibility by using a hybrid numerical integrator to simulate the\ndisk-planet interaction. The key component of the scenario is the role of low\nviscosity regions in protostellar disks known as dead zones, which affect\nplanetary migration in two ways. First of all, it allows a smaller-mass planet\nto open a gap, and hence switch the faster type I migration to the slower type\nII migration. Secondly, a low viscosity slows down type II migration itself,\nbecause type II migration is directly proportional to the viscosity. We present\nnumerical simulations of planetary migration by using a hybrid symplectic\nintegrator-gas dynamics code. Assuming that the disk viscosity parameter inside\nthe dead zone is (alpha=1e-4-1e-5), we find that, when a low-mass planet (e.g.\n1-10 Earth masses) migrates from outside the dead zone, its migration is\nstopped due to the mass accumulation inside the dead zone. When a low-mass\nplanet migrates from inside the dead zone, it opens a gap and slows down its\nmigration. A massive planet like Jupiter, on the other hand, opens a gap and\nslows down inside the dead zone, independent of its initial orbital radius. The\nfinal orbital radius of a Jupiter mass planet depends on the dead zone's\nviscosity. For the range of alpha's noted above, this can vary anywhere from 7\nAU, to an orbital radius of 0.1 AU that is characteristic of the hot Jupiters.\n","Comment: 38 pages, 14 figures, some changes in text and figures, accepted for\n  publication in ApJ"]}]

The radio emission occurs on three different spatial scales, from ~7.5\nkpc bubbles to ~1.5 kpc bubbles lying nearly orthogonal to them and a ~1 kpc\nradio jet lying orthogonal to the kpc-scale bubble. To explain the complex\nmorphology, we first consider a scenario in which the radio structures are the\nresult of superwinds ejected by a nuclear starburst. However, recent Spitzer\nobservations of Mrk 6 provide an upper limit to the star formation rate (SFR)\nof ~5.5 M_sun/yr, an estimate much lower than the SFR of ~33 M_sun/yr derived\nassuming that the bubbles are a result of starburst winds energized by\nsupernovae explosions. Thus, a starburst alone cannot meet the energy\nrequirements for the creation of the bubbles in Mrk 6.

The measurement of the\nfractal dimension (Df) of interstellar clouds is a simple way to characterize\nthis fractal structure, but several factors, both intrinsic to the clouds and\nto the observations, may contribute to affect the values obtained. In this work\nwe study the effects that opacity and noise have on the determination of Df. We\nfocus on two different fractal dimension estimators: the perimeter-area based\ndimension (Dper) and the mass-size dimension (Dm). We first use simulated\nfractal clouds to show that opacity does not affect the estimation of Dper.\nHowever, Dm tends to increase as opacity increases and this estimator fails\nwhen applied to optically thick regions. In addition, very noisy maps can\nseriously affect the estimation of both Dper and Dm, decreasing the final\nestimation of Df. We apply these methods to emission maps of Ophiuchus, Perseus\nand Orion molecular clouds in different molecular lines and we obtain that the\nfractal dimension is always in the range 2.6 < Df < 2.8 for these regions.\nThese results support the idea of a relatively high (> 2.3) average fractal\ndimension for the interstellar medium, as traced by different chemical species.\n","Comment: 17 pages including 6 figures and 1 table.

The tails have\na complex morphology, in particular when the cluster approaches its\napogalacticon, showing multiple ``arms'' in remarkable similarity to the\nstructures observed around NGC 288 and Willman 1. Actually, the tails are\ngenerally good tracers of the cluster path quite far from the cluster center\n(>7--8 tidal radii), while on the smaller scale they are mainly pointing in the\ndirection of the Galaxy center. In particular, the orientation of the inner\npart of the tails is highly correlated to the cluster orbital phase and to the\nlocal orbital angular acceleration. This implies that, in general, the orbital\npath cannot be estimated directly from the orientation of the tails, unless a\nsufficient large field around the cluster is available.\n","Comment: Latex file in the AASTEX standard; 15 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables.\n  Paper accepted on dec. 31 2006 for publication on ApJ, main journal"]}]

Here we\ndiscuss an evolutionary process that can very significantly limit the formation\nof close double black hole binaries: the vast majority of their potential\nprogenitors undergo a common envelope (CE) phase while the donor, one of the\nmassive binary components, is evolving through the Hertzsprung gap. Our latest\ntheoretical understanding of the CE process suggests that this will probably\nlead to a merger, inhibiting double black hole formation. Barring uncertainties\nin the physics of CE evolution, we use population synthesis calculations, and\nfind that the corresponding reduction in the merger rate of double black holes\nformed in galactic fields is so great (by ~500) that their contribution to\ninspiral detection rates for ground-based detectors could become relatively\nsmall (1 in 10) compared to double neutron star binaries. A similar process\nalso reduces the merger rates for double neutron stars, by factor of ~5,\neliminating most of the previously predicted ultracompact NS-NS systems. Our\npredicted detection rates for Advanced LIGO are now much lower for double black\nholes (~2/yr), but are still quite high for double neutron stars (~20/yr).

The photometry of BATC images\nfor S312 was taken with 9 intermediate-band filters covering 5000-10000\\AA.\nCombined with photometry in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) of {\\sl GALEX},\nbroad-band $UBVR$ and infrared $JHK_s$ of 2MASS, we obtained the accurate\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) of S312 from 2267-20000\\AA. A quantitative\ncomparison to simple stellar population models yields an age of\n$9.5_{-0.99}^{+1.15}$ Gyr, which is in very good agreement with the previous\ndetermination by main-sequence photometry. S312 has a mass of\n$9.8\\pm{1.85}\\times 10^5 \\rm M_\\odot$, and is a medium-mass globular cluster in\nM31. By analysis of errors of ages determined based on the SED fitting method\nof this paper, secure age constraints are derived with errors of $< 3$ Gyr for\nages younger than 9 Gyr. In fact, the theoretical SEDs are not sensitive to the\nvariation of age for ages greater than $\\sim 10$ Gyr. Therefore, for globular\nclusters as old as the majority of the Galactic GCs, our method do not\ndistinguish them accurately. We emphasize that our results show that even with\nmultiband photometry spanning NUV to $K_s$, our age constraints from SED\nfitting are distressingly uncertain, which has implications for age derivations\nin extragalactic globular cluster systems.\n","Comment: Accepted for Publication in ApJ, 9 pages, 5 figures"]}]

To investigate these\ncontradictory possibilities we have acquired Gemini/T-ReCS 11.7 micron and 18.3\nmicron images of the central few hundred parsecs of this galaxy at < 45 parsec\nangular resolution, in which the nucleus and spectacular, kiloparsec-scale\nstar-forming ring are detected in both bands. The small-scale mid-infrared\n(mid-IR) luminosity implies thermal emission from warm dust close to the\ncentral engine of this galaxy. Fitting of torus models shows that the observed\nmid-IR emission cannot be accounted for by dust heated by the central engine.\nRather, the principal source heating the dust in this object is the nuclear\nstar cluster itself, suggesting that the dust that we detect is not the torus\nof AGN unified schemes (although it is also possible that the dusty starburst\nitself could provide the obscuration invoked by the unified model). Comparison\nof Spitzer/IRS and Gemini/GNIRS spectra shows that, although polyaromatic\nhydrocarbon emission (PAH) bands are strong in the immediate circumnuclear\nregion of the galaxy, PAH emission is weak or absent in the central 19 parsecs.\nThe lack of PAH emission can probably be explained largely by\ndestruction/ionization of PAH molecules by hard photons from the nuclear star\ncluster. If NGC 1097 is typical, PAH emission bands may not be a useful tool\nwith which to find very compact nuclear starbursts even in low-luminosity AGN.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

(b) All eight relations are good when\nthe GRB redshifts are known, for example for calibration of the relations and\nfor GRB Hubble diagram purposes.

Although previously\nconjectured, this is the first time such bursting behavior has been actually\ndemonstrated in a theoretical model. For yet higher accretion rates, hydrogen\nburning is thermally stable and thus steadily generates a layer of helium that\nultimately ignites in a pure helium flash. We find that, for a narrow range of\naccretion rates between the mixed hydrogen and helium burst and weak hydrogen\nflash regimes, unstable hydrogen burning ignites helium only after a short\nseries of weak hydrogen flashes has generated a sufficiently deep layer of\nhelium. These bursts have fluences that are intermediate between those of\nnormal mixed hydrogen and helium bursts and energetic pure helium flashes.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 7 figures, accepted by ApJ"]}]

Such a homologous template light-curve is called a ``universal decline\nlaw.'' The timescale of the light curve depends strongly on the WD mass but\nweakly on the chemical composition, so we are able to roughly estimate the WD\nmass from the light-curve fitting. We have applied the universal decline law to\nthe old nova GK Persei 1901 and recent novae that outbursted in 2005. The\nestimated WD mass is 1.15 M_sun for GK Per, which is consistent with a central\nvalue of the WD mass determined from the orbital velocity variations.

We find that the weakening of the bar, reported in the literature,\nis not related to the J-exchange with the gas, but is caused by the vertical\nbuckling instability in the gas-poor disks and by a steep heating of a stellar\nvelocity dispersion by the central mass concentration (CMC) in the gas-rich\ndisks.

The former process leads to\nthe well-known formation of the peanut-shaped bulges, while the latter results\nin the formation of progressively more elliptical bulges, for larger f_gas. The\nsubsequent (secular) evolution of the bar differs -- the gas-poor models\nexhibit a growing bar while gas-rich models show a declining bar whose vertical\nswelling is driven by a secular resonance heating. The border line between the\ngas-poor and -rich models lies at f_gas ~ 3% in our models, but is\nmodel-dependent and will be affected by additional processes, like star\nformation and feedback from stellar evolution. The overall effect of the gas on\nthe evolution of the bar is not in a direct J transfer to the stars, but in the\nloss of J by the gas and its influx to the center that increases the CMC. The\nmore massive CMC damps the vertical buckling instability and depopulates orbits\nresponsible for the appearance of peanut-shaped bulges.

The\nmean fraction f_WIM of diffuse ionized gas in this sample is 0.59+/- 0.19,\nslightly higher than found in previous samples. Since lower surface-brightness\ngalaxies tend to have higher f_WIM, we believe that most of this difference is\ndue to selection effects favoring large, optically-bright, nearby galaxies with\nhigh star-formation rates. As found in previous studies, there is no\nappreciable correlation with Hubble type or total star-formation rate. However,\nwe find that starburst galaxies, defined here by an H-alpha surface brightness\n> 2.5x 10^39 erg s^-1 kpc^-2 within the H-alpha half-light radius, do show much\nlower fractions of diffuse H-alpha emission. The cause apparently is not\ndominated by a lower fraction of field OB stars. However, it is qualitatively\nconsistent with an expected escape of ionizing radiation above a threshold\nstar-formation rate, predicted from our model in which the ISM is shredded by\npressure-driven supernova feedback. The HI gas fractions in the starburst\ngalaxies are also lower, suggesting that the starbursts are consuming and\nionizing all the gas, and thus promoting regions of density-bounded ionization.\nIf true, these effects imply that some amount of Lyman continuum radiation is\nescaping from most starburst galaxies, and that WIM properties and outflows\nfrom mechanical feedback are likely to be pressure-driven. However, in view of\nprevious studies showing that the escape fraction of ionizing radiation is\ngenerally low, it is likely that other factors also drive the low fractions of\ndiffuse ionized gas in starbursts.\n","Comment: 16 pages plus separate 2-page PostScript table.

Therefore, ray tracing is generally not an accurate method of\nmodeling PSF ellipticity induced by atmospheric turbulence unless some\nadditional procedure is implemented to correctly account for the effects of\nhigh spatial frequency aberrations. The Fourier method, however, can be used\ndirectly to accurately model PSF ellipticity, which can give insights into\nerrors in the statistics of field galaxy shapes used in studies of weak\ngravitational lensing.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 5 color figures (some reduced in size).

Using explicit tidal\nintegrations, we show that although an oblique Cassini state can dissipate many\ntimes the rotational energy of the planet, the rate of dissipation must be much\nless than hypothesized. Dissipation causes the planetary spin to lie at an\nangle to the plane containing the orbital and total angular momenta.
