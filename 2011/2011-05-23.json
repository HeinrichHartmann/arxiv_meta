The main result\nsays that if a separable, simple, nonelementary, unital C*-algebra A with\nlocally finite nuclear dimension is (m,\\bar{m})-pure, then it absorbs the\nJiang-Su algebra Z tensorially. It follows that A is Z-stable if and only if it\nhas the Cuntz semigroup of a Z-stable C*-algebra.

This is undesirable from a clinical perspective, and thus there is\nan incentive to accelerate the solution of the underlying optimization problem.\nThe TV reconstruction can in principle be found by any optimization method, but\nin practice the large-scale systems arising in CT image reconstruction preclude\nthe use of memory-demanding methods such as Newton's method.

In both cases we find very high Ni56 velocities of\n17000 km/s shortly after shock-revival, and a complete fragmentation of the\nprogenitor's metal core within the first few minutes after core bounce, due to\nthe growth of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities at the Si/O and (C+O)/He\ncomposition interfaces.

So far, this\nconspicuous feature has been absent from any set of available isochrones, even\nthe few existing ones that include the TP-AGB evolution of low- and\nintermediate-mass stars.

Instead, as\nmentioned, the red tail of C-stars sets a major difficulty: we find that TP-AGB\nmodels with solar-scaled molecular opacities, the usual assumption of existing\nAGB calculations, do not succeed in reproducing this feature. Our tests\nindicate that the main reason for this failure should not be ascribed to\nempirical Teff - (J-K) transformations for C-type stars. Instead, the\ndiscrepancy is simply removed by adopting new evolutionary models that account\nfor the changes in molecular opacities as AGB stars get enriched in carbon via\nthe third dredge-up (Marigo 2002). In fact, simulations that adopt these models\nare able to reproduce, for the first time, the red tail of C-stars in\nnear-infrared CMDs.

In agreement with what expected\nfrom studies of field stars, most of the detected X-ray sources are binaries,\npreferably with short periods and eccentric orbits. In addition, several of the\nM 67 ROSAT sources have peculiar locations in the cluster colour-magnitude\ndiagram. This is most likely due to rather complex evolutionary histories,\ninvolving the presence of mass transfer or large mass losses. The X-ray\nluminosity of the sources does not scale with the stellar parameters in an\nobvious way. In particular, no relationship is found between coronal emission\nand stellar magnitude or binary period. The Ca II K chromospheric flux from\nmost of the counterparts is in excess to that of single stars in the cluster by\none order of magnitude. The X-ray luminosity of the sources in the old M 67 is\none order of magnitude lower than the most active active binaries in the field,\nbut comparable to that of the much younger binaries in the Hyades.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 6 figures.

An unambiguous method for\ncomputing asymmetry is developed, robust for both distant and nearby galaxies.\nBy degrading real galaxy images, we test the reliability of this asymmetry\nmeasure over a range of observational conditions, e.g. spatial resolution and\nsignal-to-noise (S/N). Compared to previous methods, this new algorithm avoids\nthe ambiguity associated with choosing a center by using a minimization method,\nand successfully corrects for variations in S/N. There is, however, a strong\nrelationship between the rotational asymmetry and physical resolution (distance\nat fixed spatial resolution); objects become more symmetric when less\nwell-resolved. We further investigate asymmetry as a function of galactic\nradius an rotation. We find the asymmetry index has a strong radial dependence\nthat differs vastly between Hubble types. As a result, a meaningful asymmetry\nindex must be specified within a well-defined radius representative of the\nphysical galaxy scale. We enumerate several viable alternatives, which excludes\nthe use of isophotes. Asymmetry as a function of angle (A[phi]) is also a\nuseful indicator of ellipticity and higher-order azimuthal structure. In\ngeneral, we show the power of asymmetry as a morphological parameter lies in\nthe strong correlation with (B-V) color for galaxies undergoing normal star\nformation, spanning all Hubble types from ellipticals to irregular galaxies.\nInteracting galaxies do not fall on this asymmetry-color ``fiducial sequence,''\nas these galaxies are too asymmetric for their color.

The scattering by an\nensemble of ultra-relativistic electrons obeys the law p=1-cos(alpha), where\nalpha is the scattering angle; hence photons are preferentially scattered\nbackwards. This contrasts the forward scattering behaviour in the Klein-Nishina\nregime. Analytical formulae describing first-order Klein-Nishina and\nfinite-electron-energy corrections to the simple relation above are given for\nvarious energy distributions of electrons: monoenergetic,\nrelativistic-Maxwellian, and power-law. A similar formula is also given for the\nmildly relativistic (with respect to the photon energy and electron\ntemperature) corrections to the Rayleigh angular function. One of\nmanifestations of the phenomenon under consideration is that hot plasma is more\nreflective with respect to external low-frequency radiation than cold one,\nwhich is important, in particular, for the photon exchange between cold\naccretion disks and hot atmospheres (coronae or ADAF flows) in the vicinity of\nrelativistic compact objects; and for compact radiosources.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 1 figure, submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics Letters"]}]

In the regime where this so-called ``back-reaction''\nterm is large and artificially terminates the asymmetry growth, their evolution\nequation ceases to be a faithful approximation to the Quantum Kinetic Equations\n(QKEs) simply because pure Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) transitions have\nbeen neglected. At low temperatures the MSW effect is the dominant asymmetry\namplifier. Neither the static nor the DHPS approach contains this important\nphysics. Therefore we conclude that the DHPS results have sufficient veracity\nat the onset of explosive asymmetry generation, but are invalid in the ensuing\nlow temperature epoch where MSW conversions are able to enhance the asymmetry\nto values of order $0.2 - 0.37$.
