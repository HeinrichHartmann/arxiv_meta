Interestingly, according to the\nrelativistic version of Bohmian mechanics using the Dirac equation, a massive\nparticle's speed is less than or equal to the speed of light, but not\nnecessarily less. That is, there are situations in which the particle actually\nreaches the speed of light---a very non-classical behavior. That leads us to\nthe question of whether such situations can be arranged experimentally. We\nprove a theorem, Theorem 5, implying that for generic initial wave functions\nthe probability that the particle ever reaches the speed of light, even if at\nonly one point in time, is zero. We conclude that the answer to the question is\nno. Since a trajectory reaches the speed of light whenever the quantum\nprobability current psi-bar gamma^mu psi is a lightlike 4-vector, our analysis\nconcerns the current vector field of a generic wave function and may thus be of\ninterest also independently of Bohmian mechanics. The fact that the current is\nnever spacelike has been used to argue against the possibility of\nfaster-than-light tunnelling through a barrier, a somewhat similar question.\nTheorem 5, as well as a more general version provided by Theorem 6, are also\ninteresting in their own right. They concern a certain property of a function\npsi: R^4 --> C^4 that is crucial to the question of reaching the speed of\nlight, namely being transverse to a certain submanifold of C^4 along a given\ncompact subset of space-time. While it follows from the known transversality\ntheorem of differential topology that this property is generic among smooth\nfunctions psi: R^4 --> C^4, Theorem 5 asserts that it is also generic among\nsmooth solutions of the Dirac equation.\n","Comment: 17 pages LaTeX, no figures; v4 minor additions and improvements"]}]

Because compression is done\nout-of-equilibrium in the absence of thermal fluctuations, jamming appears as a\nnew kind of a nonequilibrium phase transition. In this proceeding paper, we\nsuggest that tools from equilibrium statistical mechanics can in fact be used\nto describe many specific features of the jamming transition.

Usually QM is\nformulated based on the notion of time and space, both of which are thought a\npriori given quantities or notions. However, when we try to define the notion\nof velocity or momentum, we encounter a difficulty as we will see in chapter 1.\nThe problem is that if the notion of time is given a priori, the velocity is\ndefinitely determined when given a position, which contradicts the uncertainty\nprinciple of Heisenberg. We then set the basis of QM on the notion of position\nand momentum operators as in chapter 2. Time of a local system then is defined\napproximately as a ratio $|x|/|v|$ between the space coordinate $x$ and the\nvelocity $v$. In this formulation of QM, we can keep the uncertainty principle,\nand time is a quantity that does not have precise values unlike the usually\nsupposed notion of time has. The feature of local time is that it is a time\nproper to each local system, which is defined as a finite set of quantum\nmechanical particles. We now have an infinite number of local times that are\nunique and proper to each local system. Based on the notion of local time, the\nmotion inside a local system is described by the usual Schr\\\"odinger equation.\nWe investigate such motion in a given local system in part II.
