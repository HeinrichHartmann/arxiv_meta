We\nderive the equations governing the evolution of the scalar perturbations for a\nsystem consisting of a tachyon and a perfect fluid. Assuming the perfect fluid\nto be radiation, we solve the coupled equations for the system numerically and\nstudy the evolution of the perturbations from the sub-Hubble to the\nsuper-Hubble scales. In particular, we analyze the effects of the transition\nfrom tachyon driven inflation to the radiation dominated epoch on the evolution\nof the large scale curvature and non-adiabatic pressure perturbations. We\nconsider two different tachyonic potentials and study the effects of two\npossible types of decay of the tachyon into radiation. We plot the spectrum of\ncurvature perturbations at the end of inflation as well as at the early stages\nof the radiation dominated epoch. We find that reheating does not affect the\namplitude of the curvature perturbations in any of these cases. These results\ncorroborate similar conclusions that have been arrived at earlier based on the\nstudy of the evolution of the perturbations in the super-Hubble limit. We\nillustrate that, before the transition to the radiation dominated epoch, the\nrelative non-adiabatic pressure perturbation between the tachyon and radiation\ndecays in a fashion very similar to that of the intrinsic entropy perturbation\nassociated with the tachyon. Moreover, we show that, after the transition, the\nrelative non-adiabatic pressure perturbation dies down extremely rapidly during\nthe early stages of the radiation dominated epoch. These behavior ensure that\nthe amplitude of the curvature perturbations remain unaffected during\nreheating.

The basic ingredient is the\nepsilon-delta-surgery sequence recently proved by Pedersen, Quinn and Ranicki.\nSince one has to apply it not only in cases when the target is a manifold, but\na controlled Poincar\\'e complex, we explain this issue very roughly.\nSpecifically, it is applied in the inductive step to construct the desired\ncontrolled homotopy equivalence p_{i+1}: X_{i+1} --> X_i. Our main theorem\nrequires a sufficiently controlled Poincar\\'e structure on X_i (over X_{i-1}).\nOur construction shows that this can be achieved. In fact, the Poincar\\'e\nstructure of X_i depends upon a homotopy equivalence used to glue two manifold\npieces together (the rest is surgery theory leaving unaltered the Poincar\\'e\nstructure). It follows from the epsilon-delta-surgery sequence (more precisely\nfrom the Wall realization part) that this homotopy equivalence is sufficiently\nwell controlled.

As such they can at most provide us with two\nsubjective choices for the meaning of 'counterfactual statements' in quantum\nmechanics. We shall show that the word 'counterfactual' is in fact\ninappropriate here and should be replaced by the word 'hypothetical'. Mermin's\nchoice imposes a strictly contextual meaning based upon an interpretation of\ncounterfactuality which he used to refute, without proof as we shall see,\nStapp's logical proof [3] of non-locality in quantum theory. In linguistic\ntheory both authors' choices of meaning: counterfactual versus hypothetical are\nequally acceptable and therefore some of the issues they discussed lie outside\nthe domain of physics. The issues they discussed are further confused by the\nfact that in his reply Stapp [2] seems to have adopted Mermin's counterfactual\ninterpretation against his own original [3] hypothetical interpretation. In the\nrest of this paper we shall adopt the hypothetical sense of Stapp's original\nstatements but we modify his crucial statement LOC2 appropriately, then\nfollowing his argumentations, we shall show that there is no conflict between\nrelativity and quantum mechanics.
