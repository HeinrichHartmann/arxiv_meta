Hence, correct receiver feedback (in the form of TCP acknowledgements)\nis essential to the goal of sharing the scarce bandwidth resources fairly and\navoiding congestion collapse in the Internet. However, the assumption that a\nTCP receiver can always be trusted (to generate feedback correctly) no longer\nholds as there are plenty of incentives for a receiver to deviate from the\nprotocol. In fact, it has been shown that a misbehaving receiver (whose aim is\nto bring about congestion collapse) can easily generate acknowledgements to\nconceal packet loss, so as to drive a number of honest, innocent senders\narbitrarily fast to create a significant number of non-responsive packet flows,\nleading to denial of service to other Internet users.

It is only when coin flipping is supplemented with quantum\ncommunication that this problem can be alleviated, although partial bias\nremains. Unfortunately, practical systems are subject to loss of quantum data,\nwhich restores complete or nearly complete bias in previous protocols. We\nreport herein on the first implementation of a quantum coin-flipping protocol\nthat is impervious to loss.

A multiple-antenna base-station is\nassumed to serve multiple single-antenna users, who quantize and feed back\ntheir channel state information (CSI) through a shared rate-limited feedback\nchannel. The optimization problem is cast in the form of minimizing the average\ntransmission power at the base-station subject to users' target\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINR) and outage probability\nconstraints. The goal is to derive the feedback bit allocations among the users\nand the corresponding channel magnitude and direction quantization codebooks in\na high-resolution quantization regime. Toward this end, this paper develops an\noptimization framework using approximate analytical closed-form solutions, the\naccuracy of which is then verified by numerical results. The results show that,\nfor channels in the real space, the number of channel direction quantization\nbits should be $(M-1)$ times the number of channel magnitude quantization bits,\nwhere $M$ is the number of base-station antennas. Moreover, users with higher\nrequested quality-of-service (QoS), i.e. lower target outage probabilities, and\nhigher requested downlink rates, i.e. higher target SINR's, should use larger\nshares of the feedback rate. It is also shown that, for the target QoS\nparameters to be feasible, the total feedback bandwidth should scale\nlogarithmically with the geometric mean of the target SINR values and the\ngeometric mean of the inverse target outage probabilities. In particular, the\nminimum required feedback rate is shown to increase if the users' target\nparameters deviate from the corresponding geometric means. Finally, the paper\nshows that, as the total number of feedback bits $B$ increases, the performance\nof the limited-feedback system approaches the perfect-CSI system as\n${2^{-{B}/{M^2}}}$.\n","Comment: Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 2011"]}]

Numerical validations have been made for dipoles in vacuum\nand in an ideal planar microcavity. For dipoles located in photonic crystal\nnanocavity, it is found that the cooperative decay parameters and the\ndipole-dipole interaction potential strongly depend on the following four\nfactors: the atomic position, the atomic transition frequency, the resonance\nfrequency, and the cavity quality factor. Properly arranging the positions of\nthe two atoms, we can acquire equal value of the cooperative decay parameters\nand the local coupling strength. Large cooperative decay parameters can be\nachieved when transition frequency is equal to the resonance frequency.

An important open question in property testing is to determine for\nwhich functions f we can test f-isomorphism with a constant number of queries.\nDespite much recent attention to this question, essentially only two classes of\nfunctions were known to be efficiently isomorphism testable: symmetric\nfunctions and juntas.\n  We unify and extend these results by showing that all partially symmetric\nfunctions---functions invariant to the reordering of all but a constant number\nof their variables---are efficiently isomorphism-testable. This class of\nfunctions, first introduced by Shannon, includes symmetric functions, juntas,\nand many other functions as well. We conjecture that these functions are\nessentially the only functions efficiently isomorphism-testable.\n  To prove our main result, we also show that partial symmetry is efficiently\ntestable. In turn, to prove this result we had to revisit the junta testing\nproblem. We provide a new proof of correctness of the nearly-optimal junta\ntester. Our new proof replaces the Fourier machinery of the original proof with\na purely combinatorial argument that exploits the connection between sets of\nvariables with low influence and intersecting families.\n  Another important ingredient in our proofs is a new notion of symmetric\ninfluence. We use this measure of influence to prove that partial symmetry is\nefficiently testable and also to construct an efficient sample extractor for\npartially symmetric functions. We then combine the sample extractor with the\ntesting-by-implicit-learning approach to complete the proof that partially\nsymmetric functions are efficiently isomorphism-testable.\n","Comment: 22 pages"]}]

This plateau\nis evident in the data of all major GRB satellites, and provides a direct\nevidence supporting the Collapsar model. It also enables us to place limits on\nthe sizes and masses of LGRB progenitors; suggests the existence of a large\npopulation of choked (failed) GRBs; and indicates that the 2 s duration\ncommonly used to separate Collapsars and non-Collapsars holds for BATSE and\npossibly Fermi GBM GRBs, but it is inconsistent with the duration distributions\nof Swift GRBs.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 2 figures.

The\nnext challenge lies in semantically performing clustering based on the semantic\ncontents of the document. The problem of document clustering has two main\ncomponents: (1) to represent the document in such a form that inherently\ncaptures semantics of the text. This may also help to reduce dimensionality of\nthe document, and (2) to define a similarity measure based on the semantic\nrepresentation such that it assigns higher numerical values to document pairs\nwhich have higher semantic relationship. Feature space of the documents can be\nvery challenging for document clustering. A document may contain multiple\ntopics, it may contain a large set of class-independent general-words, and a\nhandful class-specific core-words. With these features in mind, traditional\nagglomerative clustering algorithms, which are based on either Document Vector\nmodel (DVM) or Suffix Tree model (STC), are less efficient in producing results\nwith high cluster quality. This paper introduces a new approach for document\nclustering based on the Topic Map representation of the documents. The document\nis being transformed into a compact form. A similarity measure is proposed\nbased upon the inferred information through topic maps data and structures. The\nsuggested method is implemented using agglomerative hierarchal clustering and\ntested on standard Information retrieval (IR) datasets.

All\nmechanisms published so far either study one-round sponsored search auctions or\nthe setting where every round has only one slot and all slots have the same\nclick-through rate, which is identical to a multi-item auction.\n  This paper contains the following three results: (1) We give the first\nmechanism for the multi-round sponsored search problem where different slots\nhave different click-through rates. Our mechanism is incentive compatible in\nexpectation, individually rational in expectation, Pareto optimal in\nexpectation, and also ex-post Pareto optimal for each realized outcome. (2)\nAdditionally we study the combinatorial setting, where each bidder is only\ninterested in a subset of the rounds. We give a deterministic, incentive\ncompatible, individually rational, and Pareto optimal mechanism for the setting\nwhere all slots have the same click-through rate. (3) We present an\nimpossibility result for auctions where bidders have diminishing marginal\nvaluations. Specifically, we show that even for the multi-unit (one slot per\nround) setting there is no incentive compatible, individually rational, and\nPareto optimal mechanism for private diminishing marginal valuations and public\nbudgets.\n","Comment: 28 pages"]}]

The\npurpose of the new generalized method is to improve the resolution power of\nburied geophysical targets, using probability as a suitable paradigm allowing\nall possible equivalent solution to be included into a unique 3D tomography\nimage. The new method is described by first assuming that any geophysical field\ndataset can be hypothesized to be caused by a discrete number of source poles\nand dipoles. Then, the theoretical derivation of the source pole occurrence\nprobability (SPOP) tomography, previously published in detail for single\ngeophysical methods, is symbolically restated in the most general way. Finally,\nthe theoretical derivation of the source dipole occurrence probability (SDOP)\ntomography is given following a formal development similar to that of the SPOP\ntomography. The discussion of a few examples allows us to demonstrate that the\ncombined application of the SPOP and SDOP tomographies can provide the best\ncore-and-boundary resolution of the most probable buried sources of the\nanomalies detected within a datum domain.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures"]}]
