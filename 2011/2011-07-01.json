It is\nfeared that the gas settles in a large scale disc, and that accretion would\nthen proceed too inefficiently to explain the masses of the observed SMBHs.\nHere we point out that, while the mean angular momentum in the bulge is very\nlikely to be large, the deviations from the mean can also be significant.\nIndeed, cosmological simulations show that velocity and angular momentum fields\nof gas flows onto galaxies are very complex. Furthermore, inside bulges the gas\nvelocity distribution can be further randomised by the velocity kicks due to\nfeedback from star formation. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of gaseous\nrotating shells infalling onto an SMBH, attempting to quantify the importance\nof velocity dispersion in the gas at relatively large distances from the black\nhole. We implement this dispersion by means of a supersonic turbulent velocity\nspectrum. We find that, while in the purely rotating case the circularisation\nprocess leads to efficient mixing of gas with different angular momentum,\nresulting in a low accretion rate, the inclusion of turbulence increases this\naccretion rate by up to several orders of magnitude. We show that this can be\nunderstood based on the notion of \"ballistic\" accretion, whereby dense\nfilaments, created by convergent turbulent flows, travel through the ambient\ngas largely unaffected by hydrodynamical drag. We derive a simple analytical\nformula that captures the numerical results to within a factor of a few.\nRescaling our results to astrophysical bulges, we argue that this \"ballistic\"\nmode of accretion could provide the SMBHs with a sufficient supply of fuel\nwithout the need to channel the gas via large-scale discs or bars, and\ntherefore that star formation in bulges can be a strong catalyst for SMBH\naccretion.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 21 figures.

These are\nprimarily affected by the topology of the network. We present in this paper, a\ngeneral framework for a topological analysis of a network, and develop\ndistributed algorithms in a generalized combinatorial setting in order to solve\ntwo seemingly unrelated problems, 1) Coverage hole detection and Localization\nand 2) Worm hole attack detection and Localization. We also note these\nsolutions remain coordinate free as no priori localization information of the\nnodes is assumed. For the coverage hole problem, we follow a \"divide and\nconquer approach\", by strategically dissecting the network so that the overall\ntopology is preserved, while efficiently pursuing the detection and\nlocalization of failures. The detection of holes, is enabled by first\nattributing a combinatorial object called a \"Rips Complex\" to each network\nsegment, and by subsequently checking the existence/non-existence of holes by\nway of triviality of the first homology class of this complex. Our estimate\nexponentially approaches the location of potential holes with each iteration,\nyielding a very fast convergence coupled with optimal usage of valuable\nresources such as power and memory. We then show a simple extension of the\nabove problem to address a well known problem in networks, namely the\nlocalization of a worm hole attack. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the\npresented algorithm with several substantiating examples.\n"]}]

Elimination-based\nconcurrent data-structures allow operations with reverse semantics (such as\npush and pop stack operations) to \"collide\" and exchange values without having\nto access a central location. Software combining, on the other hand, is\neffective when colliding operations have identical semantics: when a pair of\nthreads performing operations with identical semantics collide, the task of\nperforming the combined set of operations is delegated to one of the threads\nand the other thread waits for its operation(s) to be performed. Applying this\nmechanism iteratively can reduce memory contention and increase throughput. The\nmost highly scalable prior concurrent stack algorithm is the\nelimination-backoff stack. The elimination-backoff stack provides high\nparallelism for symmetric workloads in which the numbers of push and pop\noperations are roughly equal, but its performance deteriorates when workloads\nare asymmetric. We present DECS, a novel Dynamic Elimination-Combining Stack\nalgorithm, that scales well for all workload types. While maintaining the\nsimplicity and low-overhead of the elimination-bakcoff stack, DECS manages to\nbenefit from collisions of both identical- and reverse-semantics operations.\nOur empirical evaluation shows that DECS scales significantly better than both\nblocking and non-blocking best prior stack algorithms.\n"]}]

In this most general case, the diversity-multiplexing\ntradeoff is characterized as a solution to a simple, two-variable optimization\nproblem. This problem is then solved in closed form for special classes of\nchannels defined by certain restrictions on the numbers of antennas at the\nthree nodes. The key mathematical tool developed here that enables the explicit\ncharacterization of the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff is the joint eigenvalue\ndistribution of three mutually correlated random Wishart matrices. Previously,\nwithout actually characterizing the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff, the\noptimality in this tradeoff metric of the dynamic compress-and-forward (DCF)\nprotocol based on the classical compress-and-forward scheme of Cover and El\nGamal was shown by Yuksel and Erkip.
