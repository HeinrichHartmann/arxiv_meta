Therefore, there may be a corresponding Hawking\nradiation in a FRW universe. Indeed, there have been several clues showing that\nthere is a Hawking radiation from the apparent horizon of a FRW universe. In\nour paper, however, we find that the Hawking radiation may come from the\ncosmological horizon. Moreover, we also find that the Hawking radiation from\nthe apparent horizon of a FRW universe in some previous works can be a special\ncase in our result, and the condition is that the variation rate of\ncosmological horizon $\\overset{.}{r}_{H}$ is zero. Note that, this condition is\nalso consistent with the underlying integrable condition in these works from\nthe apparent horizon.\n","Comment: V3: 12 pages, no figure, typos corrected, new references added,\n  version shorted and accepted by PLB"]}]

During the rising\nperiod, the shape of the jet resembled a cylinder with helical structures on\nthe surface, while the mass of the jet was mainly distributed on the cylinder's\nshell. In the radial direction, the jet expanded successively at its western\nside. The radial expansion presented three distinct phases: the gradually\nexpanding phase, the fast expanding phase, and the steady phase. Each phase\nlasted for about 12 minutes. The angular speed of the unwinding jet and the\ntwist transferred into the outer corona during the eruption are estimated to be\n11.1 \\times 10{-3} rad/s (period = 564 s) and 1.17 to 2.55 turns (or 2.34 to\n5.1{\\pi}) respectively.

Usually the ambiguity in particle definitions is only\nas varied as the possible sets of observers on the spacetime. However, there is\na greater choice in coordinates on the phase space, especially for a field\nsystem with infinite degrees of freedom. Hence, for one set of coordinates on\nthe spacetime (one class of comoving observers) there are many different\ncoordinates to choose on the phase space. This demonstrates the true\nvacuousness of the concept of particles when defined as energy levels of the\nharmonic oscillator. In order to give a definition of particles we must specify\nthe apparatus that detects them.

Determining\nwhether and when such transfers-of-control should occur is arguably the\nfundamental research problem in adjustable autonomy. Previous work has\ninvestigated various approaches to addressing this problem but has often\nfocused on individual agent-human interactions. Unfortunately, domains\nrequiring collaboration between teams of agents and humans reveal two key\nshortcomings of these previous approaches. First, these approaches use rigid\none-shot transfers of control that can result in unacceptable coordination\nfailures in multiagent settings. Second, they ignore costs (e.g., in terms of\ntime delays or effects on actions) to an agent's team due to such\ntransfers-of-control. To remedy these problems, this article presents a novel\napproach to adjustable autonomy, based on the notion of a transfer-of-control\nstrategy. A transfer-of-control strategy consists of a conditional sequence of\ntwo types of actions: (i) actions to transfer decision-making control (e.g.,\nfrom an agent to a user or vice versa) and (ii) actions to change an agent's\npre-specified coordination constraints with team members, aimed at minimizing\nmiscoordination costs. The goal is for high-quality individual decisions to be\nmade with minimal disruption to the coordination of the team. We present a\nmathematical model of transfer-of-control strategies. The model guides and\ninforms the operationalization of the strategies using Markov Decision\nProcesses, which select an optimal strategy, given an uncertain environment and\ncosts to the individuals and teams. The approach has been carefully evaluated,\nincluding via its use in a real-world, deployed multi-agent system that assists\na research group in its daily activities.\n"]}]

The population is divided into a fixed large number\nof groups of fixed size. From generation to generation, new groups are formed\nthat descend from previous groups, through a two-level Fisher-Wright process,\nwith selection between groups and within groups and with migration between\ngroups at rate $m$. When $m=1$, the framework reduces to the often used\ntrait-group framework, so that our setting can be seen as an extension of that\napproach. Our framework allows the analysis of previously introduced models in\nwhich altruists and non-altruists compete, and provides new insights into these\nmodels. We focus on the situation in which initially there is a single\naltruistic allele in the population, and no further mutations occur. The main\nquestions are conditions for the viability of that altruistic allele to spread,\nand the fashion in which it spreads when it does. Because our results and\nmethods are rigorous, we see them as shedding light on various controversial\nissues in this field, including the role of Hamilton's rule, and of the Price\nequation, the relevance of linearity in fitness functions and the need to only\nconsider pairwise interactions, or weak selection. In this paper we analyze the\nearly stages of the evolution, during which the number of altruists is small\ncompared to the size of the population. We show that during this stage the\nevolution is well described by a multitype branching process. The driving\nmatrix for this process can be obtained, reducing the problem of determining\nwhen the altruistic gene is viable to a comparison between the leading\neigenvalue of that matrix, and the fitness of the non-altruists before the\naltruistic gene appeared.
