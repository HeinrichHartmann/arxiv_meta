In a $(J, J_a, R_a,\nM)$ MARN, $J$ sources, each equipped with $J_a$ antennas, communicate to one\n$M$-antenna destination through one $R_a$-antenna relay. A new protocol called\nIC-Relay-TDMA is proposed which takes two phases. During the first phase,\nsymbols of different sources are transmitted concurrently to the relay. At the\nrelay, interference cancellation (IC) techniques, previously proposed for\nsystems with direct transmission, are applied to decouple the information of\ndifferent sources without decoding. During the second phase, symbols of\ndifferent sources are forwarded to the destination in a time division\nmulti-access (TDMA) fashion. At the destination, the maximum-likelihood (ML)\ndecoding is performed source-by-source. The protocol of IC-Relay-TDMA requires\nthe number of relay antennas no less than the number of sources, i.e., $R_a\\ge\nJ$.

To achieve a high symbol rate, we first\npropose a scheme called DSTC-ICRec in which all sources' information streams\nare concurrently transmitted in both the source-relay link and the\nrelay-destination link. In this scheme, distributed space-time coding (DSTC) is\napplied at the relay, which satisfies the linear constraint. DSTC also allows\nthe destination to conduct the zero-forcing interference cancellation (IC)\nscheme originally proposed for multi-antenna systems to fully decouple signals\nfrom different sources. Our analysis shows that the symbol rate of DSTC-ICRec\nis $1/2$ symbols/source/channel use and the diversity gain of the scheme is\nupperbounded by $M-J+1$.

This is achieved by\ncontrolled room temperature dewetting under an optimal mixture of water,\nacetone and methyl-ethyl ketone (MEK).

Its popularity is mainly due to its fast convergence speed, which is\nconsidered to be optimal in practice. In this paper, RLS methods are used to\nsolve reinforcement learning problems, where two new reinforcement learning\nalgorithms using linear value function approximators are proposed and analyzed.\nThe two algorithms are called RLS-TD(lambda) and Fast-AHC (Fast Adaptive\nHeuristic Critic), respectively. RLS-TD(lambda) can be viewed as the extension\nof RLS-TD(0) from lambda=0 to general lambda within interval [0,1], so it is a\nmulti-step temporal-difference (TD) learning algorithm using RLS methods. The\nconvergence with probability one and the limit of convergence of RLS-TD(lambda)\nare proved for ergodic Markov chains.

The effectiveness of RLS-TD(lambda) is analyzed and\nverified by learning prediction experiments of Markov chains with a wide range\nof parameter settings.

The performance of Fast-AHC is also\ncompared with that of the AHC method using LS-TD(lambda). Furthermore, it is\ndemonstrated in the experiments that different initial values of the variance\nmatrix in RLS-TD(lambda) are required to get better performance not only in\nlearning prediction but also in learning control.
