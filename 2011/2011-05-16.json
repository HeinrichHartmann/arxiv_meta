The determined periods are\nassumed to be related to rotation periods of the investigated stars. Among them\n10 new variables with periods longer than 10 days were found, which brings the\ntotal number of slowly rotating M stars with known rotation periods to 12\nobjects.\n  X-ray activity and rotation evolution of M stars follows the trends observed\nin G-K type stars. Rapidly rotating stars are very active and activity\ndecreases with increasing rotation period but the period-activity relation is\nmass-dependent which suggests that the rotation period alone is not a proper\nmeasure of activity. The investigated stars were grouped according to their\nmass and the empirical turnover time was determined for each group. It\nincreases with decreasing mass more steeply than for K type stars for which a\nflat dependence had been found. The resulting Rossby number-activity relation\nshows an exponential decrease of activity with increasing Rossby number.\n  The analysis of space motions of 27 single stars showed that all rapidly\nrotating and a few slowly rotating stars belong to young disk (YD) whereas all\nold disk (OD) stars are slowly rotating. The median rotation period of YD stars\nis about 2 days and that of OD stars is equal to 47 days, i.e. nearly 25 times\nlonger. The average X-ray flux of OD stars is about 1.7 dex lower than YD stars\nin a good agreement with the derived Rossby number-activity formula\nsupplemented with rotation-age relation and in a fair agreement with recent\nobservations but in a disagreement with the Skumanich formula supplemented with\nthe activity-rotation relation.\n","Comment: 20 pages"]}]

This is analogous to an earlier finding that at small magnetic\nPrandtl numbers, most of the energy is dissipated resistively, lowering the\namount of kinetic energy dissipation, so simulations can then be performed at\nmuch larger fluid Reynolds numbers than otherwise. The decrease in magnetic\nenergy dissipation at large magnetic Prandtl numbers is discussed in the\ncontext of underluminous accretion found in some quasars.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures, published in Astron.Nachr"]}]

The rolling problem $(NS)$ corresponds to the situation\nwhere there is no relative spin (or twist) of one manifold with respect to the\nother one. As for the rolling problem $(R)$, there is no relative spin and also\nno relative slip. Since the manifolds are not assumed to be embedded into an\nEuclidean space, we provide an intrinsic description of the two constraints\n\"without spinning\" and \"without slipping\" in terms of the Levi-Civita\nconnections $\\nabla^{g}$ and $\\nabla^{\\hg}$. For that purpose, we recast the\ntwo rolling problems within the framework of geometric control and associate to\neach of them a distribution and a control system. We then investigate the\nrelationships between the two control systems and we address for both of them\nthe issue of complete controllability. For the rolling $(NS)$, the reachable\nset (from any point) can be described exactly in terms of the holonomy groups\nof $(M,g)$ and $(\\hM,\\hg)$ respectively, and thus we achieve a complete\nunderstanding of the controllability properties of the corresponding control\nsystem. As for the rolling $(R)$, the problem turns out to be more delicate. We\nfirst provide basic global properties for the reachable set and investigate the\nassociated Lie bracket structure. In particular, we point out the role played\nby a curvature tensor defined on the state space, that we call the\n\\emph{rolling curvature}. In the case where one of the manifolds is a space\nform (let say $(\\hM,\\hg)$), we show that it is enough to roll along loops of\n$(M,g)$ and the resulting orbits carry a structure of principal bundle which\npreserves the rolling $(R)$ distribution. In the zero curvature case, we deduce\nthat the rolling $(R)$ is completely controllable if and only if the holonomy\ngroup of $(M,g)$ is equal to SO(n). In the nonzero curvature case, we prove\nthat the structure group of the principal bundle can be realized as the\nholonomy group of a connection on $TM\\oplus \\R$, that we call the rolling\nconnection. We also show, in the case of positive (constant) curvature, that if\nthe rolling connection is reducible, then $(M,g)$ admits, as Riemannian\ncovering, the unit sphere with the metric induced from the Euclidean metric of\n$\\R^{n+1}$. When the two manifolds are three-dimensional, we provide a complete\nlocal characterization of the reachable sets when the two manifolds are\nthree-dimensional and, in particular, we identify necessary and sufficient\nconditions for the existence of a non open orbit. Besides the trivial case\nwhere the manifolds $(M,g)$ and $(\\hM,\\hg)$ are (locally) isometric, we show\nthat (local) non controllability occurs if and only if $(M,g)$ and $(\\hM,\\hg)$\nare either warped products or contact manifolds with additional restrictions\nthat we precisely describe.

We present a physically consistent reconstruction of the total solar\nirradiance for the Holocene. Methods. We extend the SATIRE models to estimate\nthe evolution of the total (and partly spectral) solar irradiance over the\nHolocene. The basic assumption is that the variations of the solar irradiance\nare due to the evolution of the dark and bright magnetic features on the solar\nsurface. The evolution of the decadally averaged magnetic flux is computed from\ndecadal values of cosmogenic isotope concentrations recorded in natural\narchives employing a series of physics-based models connecting the processes\nfrom the modulation of the cosmic ray flux in the heliosphere to their record\nin natural archives. We then compute the total solar irradiance (TSI) as a\nlinear combination of the jth and jth + 1 decadal values of the open magnetic\nflux. Results. Reconstructions of the TSI over the Holocene, each valid for a\ndi_erent paleomagnetic time series, are presented. Our analysis suggests that\nmajor sources of uncertainty in the TSI in this model are the heritage of the\nuncertainty of the TSI since 1610 reconstructed from sunspot data and the\nuncertainty of the evolution of the Earth's magnetic dipole moment. The\nanalysis of the distribution functions of the reconstructed irradiance for the\nlast 3000 years indicates that the estimates based on the virtual axial dipole\nmoment are significantly lower at earlier times than the reconstructions based\non the virtual dipole moment. Conclusions. We present the first physics-based\nreconstruction of the total solar irradiance over the Holocene, which will be\nof interest for studies of climate change over the last 11500 years.

The principle also suits the case of\nregular constraint. Coordinately, the generalized regular constraint is\nintroduced, and the critical point principle on generalized regular constraint\nis established. Let $f: U \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be a nonlinear functional.\nWhile the Lagrange multiplier $L$ in classical critical point principle is\nconsidered, and its expression is given by using generalized inverse\n${g'}^+(x)$ of $g'(x)$ as follows : if $x\\in S$ is a critical point of $f|_S,$\nthen $L=f'(x)\\circ {g'}^+(x) \\in F^*.$ Moreover, it is proved that if $S$ is a\nregular constraint, then the Lagrange multiplier $L$ is unique; otherwise, $L$\nis ill-posed. Hence, in case of the non regular constraint, it is very\ndifficult to solve Euler equations, however, it is often the case in\noptimization theory.

A\nstatistical analysis of the simulations is performed for all the most important\nastroclimatic parameters: the CN2-profiles, the seeing {\\epsilon}, the\nisoplanatic angle {\\theta}0 and the wavefront coherence time {\\tau}0. The model\nshows a general good ability in reconstructing the morphology of the optical\nturbulence (the shape of the vertical distribution of CN2) as well as the\nstrength of all the integrated astroclimatic parameters. The relative error\n(with respect to measurements) of the averaged seeing on the whole atmosphere\nfor the whole sample of 41 nights is within 9.0 %. The median value of the\nrelative error night by night is equal to 18.7 %, so that the model still\nmaintains very good performances. Comparable percentages are observed in\npartial vertical slabs (free atmosphere and boundary layer) and in different\nseasons (summer and winter). We prove that the most urgent problem, at present,\nis to increase the ability of the model in reconstructing very weak and very\nstrong turbulence conditions in the high atmosphere. This mainly affects the\nmodel's performances for the isoplanatic angle predictions, for which the\nmedian value of the relative error night by night is equal to 35.1 %. No major\nproblems are observed for the other astroclimatic parameters. A variant to the\nstandard calibration method is tested but we find that it does not provide\nbetter results, confirming the solid base of the standard method.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 12 figures.
