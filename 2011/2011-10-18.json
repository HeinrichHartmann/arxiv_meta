According to this\nanalysis, the stable stratification $N^2\\geq0$ has a destabilization mechanism,\nand the flow instability is due to the competition of the kinetic energy with\nthe potential energy, which is dominated by the total Froude number $Fr_t^2$.\nGlobally, $Fr_t^2 \\leq 1$ implies that the total kinetic energy is smaller than\nthe total potential energy. So the potential energy might transfer to the\nkinetic energy after being disturbed, and the flow becomes unstable.

We develop a\ntoolkit to treat detailed ionization, relaxation, and scattering dynamics for\nan atom within a consistent theoretical framework. The coherent x-ray\nscattering problem including radiation damage is investigated as a function of\nx-ray FEL parameters such as pulse length, fluence, and photon energy. We find\nthat the x-ray scattering intensity saturates at a fluence of ~10^7\nphotons/{\\AA}^2 per pulse, but can be maximized by using a pulse duration much\nshorter than the time scales involved in the relaxation of the inner-shell\nvacancy states created. Under these conditions, both inner-shell electrons in a\ncarbon atom are removed, and the resulting hollow atom gives rise to a\nscattering pattern with little loss of quality for a spatial resolution > 1\n{\\AA}. Our numerical results predict that in order to scatter from a carbon\natom 0.1 photons per x-ray pulse, within a spatial resolution of 1.7 {\\AA}, a\nfluence of 10^7 photons/{\\AA}^2 per pulse is required at a pulse length of 1 fs\nand a photon energy of 12 keV.

We find the QPI is sensitive\nto the value of the magnetic order which may vary from one compound to another.\nFor small value of the magnetic order, the pattern of oscillation in the local\ndensity of states (LDOS) induced by the QPI exhibits two-dimensional\ncharacteristics, consistent with the standing wave state observed in the 1111\ncompound. For larger value of the magnetic order, the main feature of the\nspatial modulation of the LDOS is the existence of one-dimensional stripe\nstructure which is in agreement with the nematic structure in the parent\ncompound of the 122 system. In both cases the system shows $C_2$ symmetry and\nonly in the larger magnetic order case, there exist in-gap bound states. The\ncorresponding QPI in $q$-space is also presented. The patterns of modulation in\nthe LDOS at nonzero energies are attributed to the interplay between the\nunderlying band structure and Fermi surfaces.\n","Comment: 9 pages,12 figures"]}]

This thesis extends upon the previously proposed discriminatory channel\nestimation (DCE) scheme that allows only the transmitter to send training\nsignals. The goal of DCE is to minimize the channel estimation error at LR\nwhile requiring the channel estimation error at UR to remain beyond a certain\nlevel. If the training signal is sent only by the transmitter, the performance\ndiscrimination between LR and UR will be limited since the training signals\nhelp both receivers perform estimates of their downlink channels. In this work,\nwe consider instead the two-way training methodology that allows both the\ntransmitter and LR to send training signals. In this case, the training signal\nsent by LR helps the transmitter obtain knowledge of the transmitter-to-LR\nchannel, but does not help UR estimate its downlink channel (i.e., the\ntransmitter-to-UR channel). With transmitter knowledge of the estimated\ntransmitter-to-LR channel, artificial noise (AN) can then be embedded in the\nnull space of the transmitter-to-LR channel to disrupt UR's channel estimation\nwithout severely degrading the channel estimation at LR. Based on these ideas,\ntwo-way DCE training schemes are developed for both reciprocal and\nnon-reciprocal channels. The optimal power allocation between training and AN\nsignals is devised under both average and individual power constraints.\nNumerical results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed\ntwo-way DCE training schemes.\n"]}]

End-to-End Delay (EED)\ncommunication is accomplished by the exchange of data among IP cores. Often,\nthe structure of particular messages is not adequate for the communication\npurposes. This leads to the concept of packet switching. In the context of\nNoCs, packets are composed by header, payload, and trailer. Packets are divided\ninto small pieces called Flits. It appears of importance, to meet the required\nperformance in NoC hardware resources. It should be specified in an earlier\nstep of the system design. The main attention should be given to the choice of\nsome network parameters such as the physical buffer size in the node. The EED\nand packet loss are some of the critical QoS metrics. Some real-time and\nmultimedia applications bound up these parameters and require specific hardware\nresources and particular management approaches in the NoC switch. A traffic\ncontract (SLA, Service Level Agreement) specifies the ability of a network or\nprotocol to give guaranteed performance, throughput or latency bounds based on\nmutually agreed measures, usually by prioritizing traffic. A defined Quality of\nService (QoS) may be required for some types of network real time traffic or\nmultimedia applications. The main goal of this paper is, using the Network on\nChip modeling architecture, to define a QoS metric. We focus on the network\ndelay bound and packet losses. This approach is based on the Network Calculus\ntheory, a mathematical model to represent the data flows behavior between IPs\ninterconnected over NoC.

The nematode is inserted at the conduit's wide end. Directed by the\nelectric field (through electrotaxis), the nematode swims deliberately upstream\ntoward the negative pole of the DC field. As the conduit narrows, the average\nfluid velocity and the drag force on the nematode increase. Eventually, the\nnematode arrives at an equilibrium position, at which its propulsive force\nbalances the viscous drag force induced by the adverse flow. The equilibrium\nposition of different animals, with similar body lengths, was measured as a\nfunction of the flow rate. The flow field around the nematode was obtained by\ndirect numerical simulations with the experimentally imaged gait and the\ntapered geometry of the conduit as boundary conditions. The flow field\ngenerated by a swimming worm is similar to the one induced by two pairs of\ncounter rotating rotors. Equilibrium positions under different flow rates were\nidentified by finding the positions at which the horizontal component of the\ntotal force exerted on the worm body vanishes. The theoretically predicted\nequilibrium positions were compared and favorably agreed with the experimental\ndata. The nematode's propulsive power was calculated by integrating the product\nof velocity and total stress over the worm's body surface. The device is useful\nto retain the nematodes at a nearly fixed position for prolonged observations\nof active animals under a microscope, to keep the nematode exercising, and to\nestimate the nematode's power consumption based on the conduit's width at the\nequilibrium position.\n","Comment: there are videos included"]}]
