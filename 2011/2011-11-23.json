This assertion supports strongly in theory that the unitary\nquantum dynamics is the fundamental and universal principle in nature. On the\nother hand, the symmetric structure of Hilbert space of a composite quantum\nsystem is the quantum-computing resource that is not owned by classical\ncomputation. A new quantum-computing speedup theory is set up on the basis of\nthe unitary quantum dynamics. Both the unitary quantum dynamics and the\nsymmetric structure and property of the Hilbert space of the quantum system are\nmainly responsible for an exponential quantum-computing speedup for a general\nefficient quantum algorithm. The inherent importance for the unitary quantum\ndynamics to speed up a quantum computation lies in the unique ability of the\nunitary quantum dynamics to build the effective interaction between the\nsymmetric structure of the Hilbert space of the quantum system and the\nmathematical symmetric structure of a problem to be solved on the quantum\nsystem.

Given the different dependence on bias of\nthe galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum, bispectrum measurements can close the\nloophole of galaxy bias hiding differences in the power spectrum.\nAlternatively, changes in the initial power spectrum can also hide differences.\nBy constructing LCDM models with very similar final non-linear power spectra,\nwe show that the differences in the bispectrum are reduced (<4%) and are\ncomparable with differences in the imperfectly matched power spectra. These\nresults indicate that the bispectrum depends mainly on the power spectrum and\nless sensitively on the gravitational signatures of the f(R) model.

At the upper and lower\nbounding surfaces, perfectly-conducting boundary conditions are adopted for the\nmagnetic field. Two different levels of thermal stratification are considered.\nIf the magnetic diffusivity is sufficiently small, the convection acts as a\nsmall-scale dynamo. Using a definition for the magnetic Reynolds number $R_M$\nthat is based upon the horizontal integral scale and the horizontally-averaged\nvelocity at the mid-layer of the domain, we find that rotation tends to reduce\nthe critical value of $R_M$ above which dynamo action is observed. Increasing\nthe level of thermal stratification within the layer does not significantly\nalter the critical value of $R_M$ in the rotating calculations, but it does\nlead to a reduction in this critical value in the non-rotating cases. At the\nhighest computationally-accessible values of the magnetic Reynolds number, the\nsaturation levels of the dynamo are similar in all cases, with the mean\nmagnetic energy density somewhere between 4 and 9% of the mean kinetic energy\ndensity. To gain further insights into the differences between rotating and\nnon-rotating convection, we quantify the stretching properties of each flow by\nmeasuring Lyapunov exponents. Away from the boundaries, the rate of stretching\ndue to the flow is much less dependent upon depth in the rotating cases than it\nis in the corresponding non-rotating calculations.

Current approaches do this by making use of\nadaptive media playout (AMP) to reduce the playout rate. However, this\nintroduces playout distortion to the viewers and increases the viewing latency.\nWe approach this by proposing a frame rate optimization framework that adjusts\nboth the encoder frame generation rate and the decoder playout frame rate.\nFirstly, we model this problem as the joint adjustment of the encoder frame\ngeneration interval and the decoder playout frame interval. This model is used\nwith a discontinuity penalty virtual buffer to track the accumulated difference\nbetween the receiving frame interval and the playout frame interval. We then\napply Lyapunov optimization to the model to systematically derive a pair of\ndecoupled optimization policies. We show that the occupancy of the\ndiscontinuity penalty virtual buffer is correlated to the video discontinuity\nand that this framework produces a very low playout distortion in addition to a\nsignificant reduction in the prebuffering requirements compared to existing\napproaches. Secondly, we introduced a delay constraint into the framework by\nusing a delay accumulator virtual buffer. Simulation results show that the the\ndelay constrained framework provides a superior tradeoff between the video\nquality and the delay introduced compared to the existing approach. Finally, we\nanalyzed the impact of delayed feedback between the receiver and the sender on\nthe optimization policies.

The aim of this thesis is to estimate the\ntime of measurement for which the current branching ratio limit of eta -> 4pi0\ndecay can be improved. In order to estimate the time of measurement Monte Carlo\nsimulations were performed. Kinematics of the pp -> ppeta -> pp4pi0 -> pp8gamma\nreactions were simulated using PLUTO program. Next, by means of the GEANT3\nprogram the response of the WASA-at-COSY detector was simulated for each\nparticle. Received signals were analysed in RootSorter software package based\non ROOT. Studies of the reaction with many gamma quanta in the exit channel\nrequired the investigation of WASA-at-COSY calorimeter functioning. Tests of a\ncluster building algorithm with emphasis on merging and splitting of detected\nsignals were done. The obtained result shows that only about 3% of eta -> 4p0\ndecays can be properly reconstructed. The identification of the eta -> 4pi0 ->\n8gamma decay was based on the invariant mass method for both pi0 and eta\nmesons. As a result, the resolution of the invariant mass determination of the\neta meson was established to sigma = 31 MeV/c2. The acceptance of the\nWASA-at-COSY detector for pp -> ppeta -> pp4pi0 -> pp8gamma reaction was\ndetermined to Aeta=(Neta detected) / (Neta produced) = 1.5%. The time of\nmeasurement for obtaining a statistical precision equal to the current\nbranching ratio limit for Tbeam = 1.3 GeV is about 13 hours.
