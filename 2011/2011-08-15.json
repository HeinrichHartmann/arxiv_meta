However, to move beyond current\nproof-of-principle experiments involving one or two conventional optical\ncavities to more complex scalable systems that employ N >> 1 microscopic\nresonators requires the localization of individual atoms on distance scales <\n100 nm from a resonator's surface. In this regime an atom can be strongly\ncoupled to a single intracavity photon while at the same time experiencing\nsignificant radiative interactions with the dielectric boundaries of the\nresonator. Here, we report an initial step into this new regime of cQED by way\nof real-time detection and high-bandwidth feedback to select and monitor single\nCesium atoms localized ~100 nm from the surface of a micro-toroidal optical\nresonator. We employ strong radiative interactions of atom and cavity field to\nprobe atomic motion through the evanescent field of the resonator.

Two major channels of MBH\nfeedback, radiative feedback (X-ray photons followed through full 3D adaptive\nray tracing) and mechanical feedback (bipolar jets resolved in high-resolution\nAMR), are employed. We investigate the coevolution of a 9.2e11 Msun galactic\nhalo and its 1e5 Msun embedded MBH at redshift 3 in a cosmological LCDM\nsimulation.
