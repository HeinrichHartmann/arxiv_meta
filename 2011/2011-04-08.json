The agencies used in the scheme are categorized as node\nand sink agency. Each agency employs a set of static and mobile agents to\nperform dedicated tasks. Node agency performs context sensing and context\ninterpretation based on the sensed image and sensing time. Node agency\ncomprises of node manager agent, context agent and node blackboard (NBB).\nContext agent gathers the context from the target and updates the NBB, Node\nmanager agent interprets the context and passes the context information to sink\nnode by using flooding mechanism. Sink agency mainly comprises of sink manager\nagent, fusing agent, and sink black board. A context at the sensor node\ntriggers the fusion process at the sink. Based on the context, sink manager\nagent triggers the fusing agent. Fusing agent roams around the network, visits\nactive sensor node, fuses the relevant images and sends the fused image to\nsink.
