This connects\nthe extensive literature on Bianchi models with the more commonly-adopted\nperturbation approach to general relativistic cosmological evolution.\nExpressions for the relevant metric perturbations in familiar coordinate\nsystems can be extracted straightforwardly. Amongst other possibilities, this\nallows for future analysis of anisotropic matter sources in a more general\ngeometry than usually attempted.\n  We discuss the geometric mechanisms by which maximal symmetry is broken in\nthe context of these models, shedding light on the origin of different Bianchi\ntypes. When all relevant length-scales are super-horizon, the simplest Bianchi\nI models emerge (in which anisotropic quantities appear parallel transported).\n  Finally we highlight the existence of arbitrarily long near-isotropic epochs\nin models of general Bianchi type (including those without an exact isotropic\nlimit).\n","Comment: 31 pages, 2 figures.

Since there are a large number of metastable de Sitter vacua\nin string landscape, tunneling transitions to lower metastable vacua through\nthe bubble nucleation occur quite naturally. Although the deviation of Omega_0\nfrom unity is small by the observational bound, we argue that the effect of\nthis small deviation on the large angle CMB anisotropies can be significant for\ntensor-type perturbation in open inflation scenario. We consider the situation\nin which there is a large hierarchy between the energy scale of the quantum\ntunneling and that of the slow-roll inflation in the nucleated bubble. If the\npotential just after tunneling is steep enough, a rapid-roll phase appears\nbefore the slow-roll inflation. In this case the power spectrum is basically\ndetermined by the Hubble rate during the slow-roll inflation. If such\nrapid-roll phase is absent, the power spectrum keeps the memory of the high\nenergy density there in the large angular components. The amplitude of large\nangular components can be enhanced due to the effects of the wall fluctuation\nmode if the bubble wall tension is small. Therefore, one can construct some\nmodels in which the deviation of Omega_0 from unity is large enough to produce\nmeasurable effects. We also consider a more general class of models, where the\nfalse vacuum decay may occur due to Hawking-Moss tunneling, as well as the\nmodels involving more than one scalar field.

An investigation into student and expert perspectives on the\n  physical interpretation of quantum mechanics, with implications for modern\n  physics instruction"],"description":["  A common learning goal for modern physics instructors is for students to\nrecognize a difference between the experimental uncertainty of classical\nphysics and the fundamental uncertainty of quantum mechanics. Our studies\nsuggest this notoriously difficult task may be frustrated by the intuitively\nrealist perspectives of introductory students, and a lack of ontological\nflexibility in their conceptions of light and matter. We have developed a\nframework for understanding and characterizing student perspectives on the\nphysical interpretation of quantum mechanics, and demonstrate the differential\nimpact on student thinking of the myriad ways instructors approach interpretive\nthemes in their introductory courses. Like expert physicists, students\ninterpret quantum phenomena differently, and these interpretations are\nsignificantly influenced by their overall stances on questions central to the\nso-called measurement problem: Is the wave function physically real, or simply\na mathematical tool? Is the collapse of the wave function an ad hoc rule, or a\nphysical transition not described by any equation? Does an electron, being a\nform of matter, exist as a localized particle at all times? These questions,\nwhich are of personal and academic interest to our students, are largely only\nsuperficially addressed in our introductory courses, often for fear of opening\na Pandora's Box of student questions, none of which have easy answers. We show\nhow a transformed modern physics curriculum (recently implemented at the\nUniversity of Colorado) may positively impact student perspectives on\nindeterminacy and wave-particle duality, by making questions of classical and\nquantum reality a central theme of our course, but also by making the beliefs\nof our students, and not just those of scientists, an explicit topic of\ndiscussion.\n","Comment: PhD dissertation, 6 Chapters (173 pages), 6 Appendices, 89\n  References.

The typical injury\nresponse often causes collateral damage, primarily an effect of inflammation,\nwhich results in the spread of lesions beyond the region where the initial\ninjury occurs. We present a minimal mathematical model based on known\nmechanisms to investigate the spread and abatement of such lesions. In\nparticular we represent the \"balancing act\" between pro-inflammatory and\nanti-inflammatory cytokines that is hypothesized to be a principal mechanism in\nthe expansion properties of cartilage damage during the typical injury\nresponse. We present preliminary results of in vitro studies that confirm the\nanti-inflammatory activities of the cytokine erythropoietin (EPO).

We present computational results\nusing the mathematical model showing that our representation is successful in\ncapturing much of the interesting spatial behaviour of injury associated lesion\ndevelopment and abatement in articular cartilage. Further, we discuss the use\nof this model to study the possibility of using EPO as a therapy for reducing\nthe amount of inflammation induced collateral damage to cartilage during the\ntypical injury response.

While the former describes the\nsurprising damping of linear plasma waves in a collisionless plasma, the latter\ndescribes exact undamped nonlinear solutions of the Vlasov equation. There does\nexist a relationship between the two: Landau damping can be described as the\nphase-mixing of undamped eigenmodes, the so-called Case-Van Kampen modes, which\ncan be viewed as BGK modes in the linear limit. While these concepts have been\naround for a long time, unexpected new results are still being discovered. For\nLandau damping, we show that the textbook picture of phase-mixing is altered\nprofoundly in the presence of collision. In particular, the continuous spectrum\nof Case-Van Kampen modes is eliminated and replaced by a discrete spectrum,\neven in the limit of zero collision. Furthermore, we show that these discrete\neigenmodes form a complete set of solutions. Landau-damped solutions are then\nrecovered as true eigenmodes (which they are not in the collisionless theory).\nFor BGK modes, our interest is motivated by recent discoveries of electrostatic\nsolitary waves in magnetospheric plasmas. While one-dimensional BGK theory is\nquite mature, there appear to be no exact three-dimensional solutions in the\nliterature (except for the limiting case when the magnetic field is\nsufficiently strong so that one can apply the guiding-center approximation). We\nshow, in fact, that two- and three-dimensional solutions that depend only on\nenergy do not exist.
