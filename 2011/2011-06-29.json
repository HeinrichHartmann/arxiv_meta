However, these coronae are more diffuse, and of a\nlower luminosity, than predicted by the analytic models of White & Frenk\nbecause of a substantial increase in entropy at z ~ 1-3. Both the removal of\nlow entropy gas by star formation and energy injection from supernovae\ncontribute to this increase in entropy, but the latter is dominant for halo\nmasses M_200 <~ 10^(12.5) Msun. Only a small fraction of the mass of the hot\ngas is outflowing as a wind but, because of its high density and metallicity,\nit contributes disproportionally to the X-ray emission. The bulk of the X-ray\nemission, however, comes from the diffuse quasi-hydrostatic corona which\nsupplies the fuel for ongoing star formation in discs today. Future deep X-ray\nobservations with high spectral resolution (e.g. with NeXT/ASTRO-H or IXO)\nshould be able to map the velocity structure of the hot gas and test this\nfundamental prediction of current galaxy formation theory.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 16 figures.

Intervening OVI\nabsorbers are believed to trace shock-heated gas in the Warm-Hot Intergalactic\nMedium (WHIM) and may thus play a key role in the search for the missing\nbaryons in the present-day Universe. When compared to observations, the\npredicted distributions of the different OVI line parameters (column density,\nDoppler parameter, rest equivalent width) from our simulations exhibit a lack\nof strong OVI absorbers. This suggests that physical processes on sub-grid\nscales (e.g. turbulence) may strongly influence the observed properties of OVI\nsystems. We find that the intervening OVI absorption arises mainly in highly\nmetal-enriched (0.1 << Z/Z_sun < 1) gas at typical overdensities of 1 <<\nrho/<rho> < 100. One third of the OVI absorbers in our simulation are found to\ntrace gas at temperatures T < 10^5 K, while the rest arises in gas at higher\ntemperatures around T =10^5.3 K. The OVI resides in a similar region of\n(rho,T)-space as much of the shock-heated baryonic matter, but the vast\nmajority of this gas has a lower metal content and does not give rise to\ndetectable OVI absorption As a consequence of the patchy metal distribution,\nOVI absorbers in our simulations trace only a very small fraction of the cosmic\nbaryons (<2 percent) and the cosmic metals. Instead, these systems presumably\ntrace previously shock-heated, metal-rich material from galactic winds that is\nnow cooling. The common approach of comparing OVI and HI column densities to\nestimate the physical conditions in intervening absorbers from QSO observations\nmay be misleading, as most of the HI (and most of the gas mass) is not\nphysically connected with the high-metallicity patches that give rise to the\nOVI absorption.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

It is also shown that dips\nappear at frequencies being the integer numbers of the applied terahertz field\nfrequency in the case of low Fermi energy, originating from the quasi-energy\ngaps at small momentums.

At high shear rates, when the\nsystem is strongly anisotropic, the fluctuation-dissipation ratio derived\neffective temperatures are approximately wave-vector independent, but the\ntemperatures along the gradient direction are somewhat higher than those along\nthe vorticity direction. The temperatures derived from the static linear\nresponse show the same dependence on the direction as those derived from the\nfluctuation-dissipation ratio.

While the available connectivity maps have been used in\nvarious computational studies, prominent features of the simulated activity\nsuch as the spontaneous firing rates do not match the experimental findings.\nHere, we show that the inconsistency arises from the incompleteness of the\nconnectivity maps.

Taking them\ninto account, we compile an integrated connectivity map and analyze the unified\nmap by simulations of a full scale model of the local layered cortical network.\nThe simulated spontaneous activity is asynchronous irregular and the cell-type\nspecific spontaneous firing rates are in agreement with in vivo recordings in\nawake animals, including the low rate of layer 2/3 excitatory cells. Similarly,\nthe activation patterns evoked by transient thalamic inputs reproduce recent in\nvivo measurements. The correspondence of simulation results and experiments\nrests on the consideration of specific target type selection and thereby on the\nintegration of a large body of the available connectivity data.

In large data sets, data storage and processing also lead to\ncomputational bottlenecks and numerical stability of the estimates and\npredicted values degrades with $n$. To address these problems, a rich variety\nof methods have been proposed, with recent options including predictive\nprocesses in spatial data analysis and subset of regressors in machine\nlearning. The underlying idea in these approaches is to use a subset of the\ndata, leading to questions of sensitivity to the subset and limitations in\nestimating fine scale structure in regions that are not well covered by the\nsubset. Motivated by the literature on compressive sensing, we propose an\nalternative random projection of all the data points onto a lower-dimensional\nsubspace.
