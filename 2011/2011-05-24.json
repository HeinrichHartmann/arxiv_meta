This model has a\nmajor interesting feature: despite of being matter-dominated and flat, it can\nexplain the present accelerate expansion of the universe. This is the first\nstudy of this class of models using high redshift GRBs. We have performed a\n$\\chi$-square statistical analysis of the GRBs calibrated with the Cardassian\nmodel, and also combined them with both the current Cosmic Microwave Background\nand Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation data. Our results show consistency between\nthe current observational data and the model predictions. In particular, the\nbest-fit parameters obtained from the $\\chi^2$-analysis are in agreement with\nthose obtained from the Concordance Cosmology ($\\Lambda$-CDM). We determine the\nredshift at which the universe would start to follow the Cardassian expansion,\ni. e., \\zc, and both the redshift at which the universe had started to\naccelerate, i. e., \\zac, and the age-redshift relation $H_0t_0$. Our results\nalso show that the universe, from the point of view of GRBs, had undergo a\ntransition to acceleration at a redshift $z \\approx 0.2-0.7$, which agrees with\nthe SNIa results. Hence, after confronting the Cardassian scenario with the\nGRBs HD and proving its consistency with it, we conclude that GRBs should\nindeed be considered a complementary tool to several other astronomical\nobservations for studies of high accuracy in cosmology.\n","Comment: Revtex4 format, 17 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables"]}]

Methods: Our dense photometric coverage of the\noverall light curve and a proper microlensing modelling allow us to derive\nmeasurements of the OGLE 2004-BLG-482 source star's linear limb-darkening\ncoefficients in three bands, including standard Johnson-Cousins I and R, as\nwell as in a broad clear filter.

Unfortunately, in the real world, sensing\nmatrices do not always come from random processes. It is therefore desirable to\nevaluate whether an arbitrary matrix, or frame, is suitable for sensing sparse\nsignals. To this end, the present paper investigates two parameters that\nmeasure the coherence of a frame: worst-case and average coherence. We first\nprovide several examples of frames that have small spectral norm, worst-case\ncoherence, and average coherence. Next, we present a new lower bound on\nworst-case coherence and compare it to the Welch bound. Later, we propose an\nalgorithm that decreases the average coherence of a frame without changing its\nspectral norm or worst-case coherence. Finally, we use worst-case and average\ncoherence, as opposed to the Restricted Isometry Property, to garner\nnear-optimal probabilistic guarantees on both sparse signal detection and\nreconstruction in the presence of noise. This contrasts with recent results\nthat only guarantee noiseless signal recovery from arbitrary frames, and which\nfurther assume independence across the nonzero entries of the signal---in a\nsense, requiring small average coherence replaces the need for such an\nassumption.\n"]}]

Driven by GR reaction, sparsely, the binary separation\nreduces, the WD overflows its Roche lobe and the mass transfer drives unstable\nthe accretion disk around the NS. As the binary circular orbital period is a\nmultiple integer number ($m$) of the period of the WD fundamental mode (Pons et\nal. 2002), the WD is since long pulsating at its fundamental mode; and most of\nits harmonics, due to the tidal interaction with its NS orbital companion.\nHence, when the powerful irradiation glows onto the WD; from the fireball\nejected as part of the disk matter slumps onto the NS, it is partially\nabsorbed. This huge energy excites other WD radial ($p$-mode) pulsations\n(Podsiadlowski 1991,1995). After each mass-transfer episode the binary\nseparation (and orbital period) is augmented significantly (Deloye & Bildsten\n2003; Al\\'ecyan & Morsink 2004) due to the binary's angular momentum\nredistribution. Thus a new adiabatic inspiral phase driven by GR reaction\nstarts which brings the binary close again, and the process repeats. This model\nallows to explain most of SGRs observational features: their recurrent\nactivity, energetics of giant superoutbursts and quiescent stages, and\nparticularly the intriguing subpulses discovered by BeppoSAX (Feroci et al.\n1999), which are suggested here to be {\\it overtones} of the WD radial\nfundamental mode (see the accompanying paper: Mosquera Cuesta 2004b).\n","Comment: This paper was submitted as a \"Letter to the Editor\" of MNRAS in July\n  17/2004.

Based on the\nultra-relativistic, ultracompact X-ray binary model introduced in the\naccompanying paper (Mosquera Cuesta 2004a), I present here a self-consistent\nexplanation for such an striking feature. I suggest that both the fundamental\nmode and the overtones observed in SGR1900+14 stem from pulsations of a massive\nwhite dwarf (WD). The fundamental mode (and likely some of its harmonics) is\nexcited because of the mutual gravitational interaction with its orbital\ncompanion (a NS, envisioned here as point mass object) whenever the binary\nKeplerian orbital frequency is a multiple integer number ($m$) of that mode\nfrequency (Pons et al. 2002). Besides, a large part of the powerful irradiation\nfrom the fireball-like explosion occurring on the NS (after partial accretion\nof disk material) is absorbed in different regions of the star driving the\nexcitation of other multipoles (Podsiadlowski 1991,1995), i.e., the overtones\n(fluid modes of higher frequency). Part of this energy is then reemitted into\nspace from the WD surface or atmosphere. This way, the WD lightcurve carries\nwith it the signature of these pulsations inasmuch the way as it happens with\nthe Sun pulsations in Helioseismology. It is shown that our theoretical\nprediction on the pulsation spectrum agrees quite well with the one found by\nBeppoSAX (Feroci et al. 1999).

At these higher energy scales, the transition at which gravity\nseparated from all other interactions; the so-called Planck era, more massive\nstrings called supermassive cosmic strings, could have been produced, with\nenergy of about 10^{19}GeV. The dynamics of strings formed with this energy\nscale cannot be described by means of the weak-field approximation, as in the\nstandard procedure for ordinary GUT cosmic strings. As suggested by string\ntheories, at this extreme energies, gravity may be transmitted by some kind of\nscalar field (usually called the {\\it dilaton}) in addition to the tensor field\nof Einstein's theory of gravity. It is then permissible to tackle the issue\nregarding the dynamics of supermassive cosmic strings within this framework.\nWith this aim we obtain the gravitational field of a supermassive screwed\ncosmic string in a scalar-tensor theory of gravity. We show that for the\nsupermassive configuration exact solutions of scalar-tensor screwed cosmic\nstrings can be found in connection with the Bogomol'nyi limit. We show that the\ngeneralization of Bogomol'nyi arguments to the Brans-Dicke theory is possible\nwhen torsion is present and we obtain an exact solution in this supermassive\nregime, with the dilaton solution obtained by consistency with internal\nconstraints.\n","Comment: 15 pages, Latex, 4 figures"]}]
