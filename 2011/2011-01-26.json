We also argue that\nthey can be especially useful as diagnostic measures to get preliminary\nknowledge about imperfections in an experimental setup. In particular we\nprovide quantum circuit which can be used to measure the superfidelity between\nquantum processes.\n  As the behavior of the superfidelity between quantum processes is crucial for\nthe properties of the introduced measures, we study its behavior for several\nfamilies of quantum channels. We calculate superfidelity between arbitrary\none-qubit channels using affine parametrization and superfidelity between\ngeneralized Pauli channels in arbitrary dimensions. Statistical behavior of the\nproposed quantities for the ensembles of quantum operations in low dimensions\nindicates that the proposed measures can be indeed used to distinguish quantum\nprocesses.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 4 figures"]}]

The R-C cloud is amongst the most well known of \\HI\\ self-absorbing\n(HISA) regions located at a distance of about 125 pc in the Galactic centre\ndirection. Taking the R-C cloud as an example, we demonstrate that the physical\nproperties of the HISA can be constrained by combining multi-frequency CRRL and\n\\HI\\ observations. The derived physical properties of the HISA cloud are used\nto determine the cooling and heating rates. The dominant cooling process is\nemission of the \\CII\\ 158 \\mum line whereas dominant heating process in the\ncloud interior is photoelectric emission. Constraints on the FUV flux (G0\n$\\sim$ 4 to 7) falling on the R-C cloud are obtained by assuming thermal\nbalance between the dominant heating and cooling processes.

This graph has several interesting mathematical\nproperties - for example, it is a median network and therefore an isometric\nsubgraph of a hypercube. It is commonly used as a tool in studies of DNA\nsequences gathered from populations. In this paper, we present some results\nconcerning the {\\em cut vertices} of $\\B(\\Sg)$, i.e., vertices whose removal\ndisconnect the graph, as well as its {\\em blocks} or 2-{\\em connected\ncomponents} - results that yield, in particular, an intriguing generalization\nof the well-known fact that $\\B(\\Sg)$ is a tree if and only if any two splits\nin $\\Sg$ are compatible.\n"]}]

Improves\nFried-Serre on deciding when sphere covers with odd-order branching lift to\nunramified Spin covers. We produce Hurwitz-Torelli automorphic functions on\nHurwitz spaces, and draw Inverse Galois conclusions. Example: Absolute spaces\nof 3-cycle covers with +1 (resp. -1) lift invariant carry canonical even (resp.\nodd) theta functions when r is even (resp. odd). For inner spaces the result is\nindependent of r. Another use appears in,\nhttp://www.math.uci.edu/~mfried/paplist-mt/twoorbit.html, \"Connectedness of\nfamilies of sphere covers of A_n-Type.\" This shows the M(odular) T(ower)s for\nthe prime p=2 lying over Hurwitz spaces first studied by,\nhttp://www.math.uci.edu/~mfried/othlist-cov/hurwitzLiu-Oss.pdf, Liu and\nOsserman have 2-cusps. That is sufficient to establish the Main Conjecture: (*)\nHigh tower levels are general-type varieties and have no rational points.For\ninfinitely many of those MTs, the tree of cusps contains a subtree -- a spire\n-- isomorphic to the tree of cusps on a modular curve tower. This makes\nplausible a version of Serre's O(pen) I(mage) T(heorem) on such MTs.\nEstablishing these modular curve-like properties opens, to MTs, modular\ncurve-like thinking where modular curves have never gone before.
