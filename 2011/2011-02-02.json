For each ring we\napply a linear filter with characteristic scale R, dividing the CMB signal in\ntwo parts: the filtered part, with characteristic scale above that of the\nfilter R, and the difference between the initial and filtered signal. Using the\nfilter scale as a variable, we can maximize the skewness and kurtosis of the\nsmoothed signal and minimize these statistics for the difference between\ninitial and filtered signal. We have discovered that the shape of the CS is\nformed primarily by the components of the CMB signal represented by multipoles\nbetween 10<=L<=20, with a corresponding angular scale about 5-10 degs. This\nsignal leads to modulation of the whole CMB sky, clearly seen at |b|>30deg in\nboth the ILC and WCM maps, rather than a single localized feature.

An important\nkind of source for ET will be the inspiral and merger of binary neutron stars\n(BNS) up to $z \\sim 2$. If BNS mergers are the progenitors of short-hard\n$\\gamma$-ray bursts, then some fraction of them will be seen both\nelectromagnetically and through GW, so that the luminosity distance and the\nredshift of the source can be determined separately. An important property of\nthese `standard sirens' is that they are \\emph{self-calibrating}: the\nluminosity distance can be inferred directly from the GW signal, with no need\nfor a cosmic distance ladder. Thus, standard sirens will provide a powerful\nindependent check of the $\\Lambda$CDM model. In previous work, estimates were\nmade of how well ET would be able to measure a subset of the cosmological\nparameters (such as the dark energy parameter $w_0$) it will have access to,\nassuming that the others had been determined to great accuracy by alternative\nmeans. Here we perform a more careful analysis by explicitly using the\npotential Planck CMB data as prior information for these other parameters. We\nfind that ET will be able to constrain $w_0$ and $w_a$ with accuracies $\\Delta\nw_0 = 0.099$ and $\\Delta w_a = 0.302$, respectively. These results are compared\nwith projected accuracies for the JDEM Baryon Acoustic Oscillations project and\nthe SNAP Type Ia supernovae observations.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables; Published Version"]}]

At time $0$, each agent is located at a random node of the\ngrid and one agent has a rumor. The spread of the rumor is governed by a\ndynamic communication graph process ${G_t(r) | t \\geq 0}$, where two agents are\nconnected by an edge in $G_t(r)$ iff their distance at time $t$ is within their\ntransmission radius $r$. Modeling the physical reality that the speed of radio\ntransmission is much faster than the motion of the agents, we assume that the\nrumor can travel throughout a connected component of $G_t$ before the graph is\naltered by the motion. We study the broadcast time $T_B$ of the system, which\nis the time it takes for all agents to know the rumor. We focus on the sparse\ncase (below the percolation point $r_c \\approx \\sqrt{n/k}$) where, with high\nprobability, no connected component in $G_t$ has more than a logarithmic number\nof agents and the broadcast time is dominated by the time it takes for many\nindependent random walks to meet each other.
