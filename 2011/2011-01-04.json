In less luminous objects, SiII \\lambda 5972 is stronger because of a\nrapidly increasing SiII/SiIII ratio. Thus, the correlation between R(SiII) and\nluminosity is the effect of ionisation balance.

As the\neffective Yang-Mills Lagrangian is completely determined by the quantum field\ntheory, there is no adjustable parameter in the model except the energy scale.\nIn this model, the equation-of-state (EOS) of the YMC dark energy, $w_y > -1$\nand $w_y < -1$, can both be naturally realized. By studying the evolution of\nvarious components in the model, we find that, in the early stage of the\nuniverse, dark energy tracked the evolution of the radiation, i.e. $w_y \\to\n1/3$. However, in the late stage, $w_y$ naturally runs to the critical state\nwith $w_y = -1$, and the universe transits from matter-dominated into dark\nenergy dominated stage only at recently $z \\sim 0.3$. These characters are\nindependent of the choice of the initial condition, and the cosmic coincidence\nproblem is avoided in the models. We also find that, if the possible\ninteraction between YMC and dust matter is considered, the late time attractor\nsolution may exist. In this case, the EOS of YMC must evolve from $w_y>0$ into\n$w_y < -1$, which is slightly suggested by the observations. At the same time,\nthe total EOS in the attractor solution is $w_{tot} = -1$, the universe being\nthe de Sitter expansion in the late stage, and the cosmic big rip is naturally\navoided. These features are all independent of the interacting forms.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 4 figures, invited for the book: Dark Energy: Theories,\n  Developments and Implications, accepted for publication"]}]

Predictions for geo-neutrinos at\n  KamLAND"],"description":["  Geo-neutrino detection can determine the amount of long-lived radioactive\nelements within our planet, thus providing a direct test of the Bulk Silicate\nEarth (BSE) model and fixing the radiogenic contribution to the terrestrial\nheat. We present a prediction for the geo-neutrino signal at KamLAND as a\nfunction of the Uranium mass in the Earth. The prediction is based on global\nmass balance, supplemented by a detailed geochemical and geophysical study of\nthe region near the detector. The prediction is weakly dependent on mantle\nmodeling. If BSE is correct, Uranium geo-neutrinos will produce between 25 and\n35 events per year and 10^32 protons at Kamioka.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 5 figures; minor changes in reply to referees' comments and\n  APS style requirements, version to appear in PRD.

That leads to the spectrum decay\n$\\sim \\omega^{-5}$, where $\\omega$ is the frequency of waves. There is a\ncontradiction between the numerous experimental data and this spectrum.\nExperiments frequently show decay $\\sim\\omega^{-4}$ (Toba, 1973),(Donelan et\nal, 1985), and (Hwang et al, 1999).

Although\nwe mostly concentrated on the very important case of Phillips model the\ndeveloped technique and general formula can be used for the analysis of other\nspectra.\n  For the particular case of Phillips spectra we got analytic asymptotics in\nthe vicinity of spectral maximum and for high frequencies.

Together with the analytic investigation we performed\nnumerical calculations in a wide range of frequencies. Both high and low\nfrequency asymptotics are in very good agreement with the numerical results.\n  It was shown that at least at low frequencies correction to the spectrum due\nto the Doppler shift is negligible.
