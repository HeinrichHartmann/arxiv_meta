The efficient development, testing and running in parallel\nSS software requires a convenient framework to develop software source code,\ndeploy and monitor batch jobs, merge and analyse results from multiple parallel\njobs, even before the production runs are terminated. Throughout the years of\ndevelopment of stochastic simulations for HEP, a sophisticated framework\nfeaturing all the above mentioned functionality has been implemented.

Penrose has proposed a\nconjecture, according to which there exists a cosmic censor who forbids the\noccurrence of naked singularities. Distinguishing between astrophysical black\nholes and naked singularities is a major challenge for present day\nobservational astronomy. A possibility of differentiating naked singularities\nfrom black holes is through the comparative study of thin accretion disks\nproperties around rotating naked singularities and Kerr-type black holes,\nrespectively. In the present paper, we consider accretion disks around rotating\nnaked singularities, obtained as solutions of the field equations in the\nEinstein-massless scalar field theory. A first major difference between\nrotating naked singularities and Kerr black holes is in the frame dragging\neffect, the angular velocity of a rotating naked singularity being inversely\nproportional to its spin parameter. Due to the differences in the exterior\ngeometry, the thermodynamic and electromagnetic properties of the disks are\ndifferent for these two classes of compact objects, consequently giving clear\nobservational signatures that could discriminate between black holes and naked\nsingularities. For specific values of the spin parameter and of the scalar\ncharge, the energy flux from the disk around a rotating naked singularity can\nexceed by several orders of magnitude the flux from the disk of a Kerr black\nhole. The conversion efficiency of the accreting mass into radiation by\nrotating naked singularities is always higher than the conversion efficiency\nfor black holes.

While the approximate\nmodules are fast in detection and involve less overhead, they have lower\ndetection accuracy.

The\nresponse of SSG devices to nuclear recoils has been explored irradiating SSG\ndetectors with a 70MeV neutron beam. The aim of the experiment was to test the\nsensitivity of Sn, Al and Zn SSG detectors to nuclear recoil energies down to a\nfew keV. The detector consisted of a hollow teflon cylinder (0.1cm$^3$ inner\nvolume) filled with tiny superconducting metastable granules embedded in a\ndielectric medium. The nuclear recoil energies deposited in the SSG were\ndetermined measuring the neutron scattering angles with a neutron hodoscope.\nCoincidences in time between the SSG and the hodoscope signals have been\nclearly established. In this paper the results of the neutron irradiation\nexperiments at different SSG intrinsic thresholds are discussed and compared to\nMonte Carlo simulations. The results show that SSG are sensitive to recoil\nenergies down to $\\sim$1keV. The limited angular resolution of the neutron\nhodoscope prevented us from measuring the SSG sensitivity to even lower recoil\nenergies.\n","Comment: 14 pages in pure LaTeX, 17 figures available on request from\n  schmiemann@lhep.unibe.ch, submitted to Phys.

Surface roughness versus lateral dimension was\nanalyzed for samples what were grown under different conditions. We find that\nall samples belong to the same growth class, in which the surface roughness\nscales linearly with lateral size at small scales and appears to saturate at\nlarge scales. For length scales ranging from 1 nm to 100 $\\mu$m, the scaling\nbehavior can be described by a linear continuum model consisting of a surface\ndiffusion term and a Laplacian term. However, in-depth analysis on\nnon-universal amplitudes indicates the breaking of up-down symmetry, suggesting\nthe presence of non-linear terms in the microscopic model. We argue that the\nleading non-linear term has the form of $\\lambda _1(\\nabla h)^2$, but its\neffect on scaling exponents will not be evident for length scales less than 1\nmm. Therefore, the growth dynamics of this system is described by the\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, consisting of the two linear terms plus $\\lambda\n_1(\\nabla h)^2$, driven by a Gaussian noise. We also discuss the negative\ncoefficient in the Laplacian term as an instability mechanism responsible for\nlarge scale film morphology on the final surface.\n","Comment: 25 pages, revtex, 6 figures available upon request, to appear in\n  Phys.
