In the case of a single experiment, we compare this method\nwith Pseudo-$C_\\ell$ methods. The performance of the needlet spectral\nestimators (NSE) compares very favorably to the best Pseudo--$C_\\ell$\nestimators, over the whole multipole range. On simulations with a simple model\n(CMB + uncorrelated noise with known variance per pixel + mask), they perform\nuniformly better. Their distinctive ability to aggregate many different\nexperiments, to control the propagation of errors and to produce a single\nwide-band error bars is highlighted.

In this paper, we aim to contribute towards a\nbetter understanding of the dynamical systems phenomena that cause seizures.\nBased on data analysis and modelling, seizure dynamics can be identified to\npossess multiple spatial scales and on each spatial scale also multiple time\nscales. At each scale, we reach several novel insights. On the smallest spatial\nscale we consider single model neurons and investigate early-warning signs of\nspiking.

The six first class constraints\ncorresponding to the local Lorentz transformation in Teleparallel gravity\nbecome second class constraints in $f(T)$ gravity, which leads to the\nappearance of three extra degrees of freedom and the violation of the local\nLorentz invariance in $f(T)$ gravity. In general, there are $D-1$ extra degrees\nof freedom for $f(T)$ gravity in $D$ dimensions, and this implies that the\nextra degrees of freedom correspond to one massive vector field or one massless\nvector field with one scalar field.\n","Comment: 18 pages, some references added, minor revision to appear in JHEP"]}]

In doing this we make\nessential use of the link between the asymptotics of the random matrix\npartition function and orthogonal polynomials with exponential weight equal to\nthe random matrix potential. Along the way we develop and analyze the continuum\nlimits of both the hierarchy of Toda lattice equations and the hierarchy of\ndifference string equations associated to these orthogonal polynomials. The\nformer are found to have the structure of a hierarchy of near-conservation laws\nuniversal in the potential; the latter are a novel semi-classical extension of\nthe traditional string equations. Our methods apply to regular maps of both\neven and odd valence, however we focus on the latter since that is the relevant\ncase for this paper.

From the field theory perspective this means that not every massless\nfield in flat space admits a deformation to $AdS_d$ with the same number of\ndegrees of freedom, because it is impossible to keep all of the flat space\ngauge symmetries unbroken in the AdS space. An equivalent statement is that,\ngeneric irreducible AdS massless fields reduce to certain reducible sets of\nmassless fields in the flat limit. A conjecture on the general pattern of the\nflat space limit of a general $AdS_d$ massless field is made. The example of\nthe three-cell ``hook'' Young diagram is discussed in detail.
