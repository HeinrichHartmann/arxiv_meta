We define rigorously this\nprocedure and then study extensively the Gaussian Tree of quite arbitrary size\nand shape, where individual risks are normal, and where the Gaussian copula is\nused. We derive exact analytical results for the diversification benefit of the\nGaussian tree as a function of its shape and of the dependency parameters.\n  Such a \"toy-model\" of an aggregation tree enables one to understand the basic\nphenomena's at play while aggregating risks in this way. In particular, it is\nshown that, for a fixed number of individual risks, \"thin\" trees diversify\nbetter than \"fat\" trees. Related to this, it is shown that hierarchical trees\nhave the natural tendency to lower the overall dependency with respect to the\ndependency parameter chosen at each step of the aggregation. We also show that\nthese results hold in more general cases outside the gaussian world, and apply\nnotably to more realistic portfolios (LogNormal trees). We believe that any\ninsurer or reinsurer using such a tool should be aware of these systematic\neffects, and that this awareness should strongly call for designing trees that\nadequately fit the business.\n  We finally address the issue of specifying the full joint distribution\nbetween the risks.

The correlation coefficient between the\nintensities the Earth and V1 during this time period, is 0.936, allowing for a\n~0.9 year delay due to the solar wind propagation time from the Earth to the\nouter heliosphere. To describe these intensity changes and to predict the\nabsolute intensities measured at all three locations we have used a simple\nspherically symmetric (no drift) two-zone heliospheric transport model with\nspecific values for the diffusion coefficient in both the inner and outer\nzones. The diffusion coefficient in the outer zone, from about 90 to 120 (130)\nAU, is determined to be ~5-10 times smaller than that in the inner zone out to\n90 AU. This means that the outer zone acts much like a diffusing barrier in\nthis model. The absolute magnitude of the intensities and the intensity changes\nat V1 and the Earth are described to within a few percent by a diffusion\ncoefficient that varies with time by a factor ~4 in the inner zone and only\n~1.8 (1.25) in the outer zone over the time period from 2004-2010. These\ndiffusion coefficients and their variations are essentially the same as those\nderived earlier from a similar study using He nuclei of the same energy. This\nmodel and the diffusion coefficients used provide a total modulation potential\nat the Earth ~250 MV in 2009. The difference ~10-20% between calculated and\nobserved intensities at V2 can be explained if the heliosphere is squashed by\n~10% in distance (non-spherical) so that the HTS is closer to the Sun in the\ndirection of V2 compared to V1.\n","Comment: 20 Pages, 7 figures"]}]

There have been\nextensive works that model communication systems with selfish users as one-shot\ngames and propose incentive schemes to achieve Pareto optimal action profiles\nas non-cooperative equilibria. However, in many communication systems, due to\nstrong negative externalities among users, the sets of feasible payoffs in\none-shot games are nonconvex. Thus, it is possible to expand the set of\nfeasible payoffs by having users choose convex combinations of different\npayoffs. In this paper, we propose a repeated game model generalized by\nintervention. First, we use repeated games to convexify the set of feasible\npayoffs in one-shot games. Second, we combine conventional repeated games with\nintervention, originally proposed for one-shot games, to achieve a larger set\nof equilibrium payoffs and loosen requirements for users' patience to achieve\nit. We study the problem of maximizing a welfare function defined on users'\nequilibrium payoffs, subject to minimum payoff guarantees. Given the optimal\nequilibrium payoff, we derive the minimum intervention capability required and\ndesign corresponding equilibrium strategies. The proposed generalized repeated\ngame model applies to various communication systems, such as power control and\nflow control.\n","Comment: 42 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables"]}]

In both cases, we use a tight-binding\napproximation, assuming a Drude dielectric function for the metallic component,\nbut without making the quasistatic approximation. The tight-binding modes are\nlinear combinations of the single-cavity transverse magnetic (TM) modes. For\nthe inverse-opal structures, the lowest modes are analogous to those\nconstructed from the three degenerate atomic p-states in fcc crystals.

We also find that systems containing more massive\nsecondaries have longer post-CE orbital periods, in contradiction to recent\npredictions.

As a consequence the\nquality of the discovered patterns is low. In this paper, we propose a novel\nframework integrating semantic information in the Web usage mining process.\nSequential Pattern Mining technique is applied over the semantic space to\ndiscover the frequent sequential patterns. The frequent navigational patterns\nare extracted in the form of Ontology instances instead of Web page views and\nthe resultant semantic patterns are used for generating Web page\nrecommendations to the user. Experimental results shown are promising and\nproved that incorporating semantic information into Web usage mining process\ncan provide us with more interesting patterns which consequently make the\nrecommendation system more functional, smarter and comprehensive.\n"]}]

We consider either finite or source-transitive graphs,\ni.e., graphs that are identical when viewed from a(ny) source. We assume\nstochastic, individual-based, density-independent reproduction and dispersal.\nBy studying the path of a single random disperser, we are able to display\nsimple criteria for persistence, either necessary and sufficient, or just\nsufficient. In case of persistence, we characterize the growth rate of the\npopulation as well as the asymptotic occupancy frequencies of the line of\nascent of a random survivor. Our method allows to decouple the roles of\nreproduction and dispersal. Finally, we extend our results to the case of\nperiodic or random environments, where some habitats can have variable growth\nrates, autocorrelated in space and possibly in time.
