For Ising-like\nsystems without quenched disorder, $P_L(m)$ becomes scale invariant at the\ncritical point, where it assumes a characteristic bimodal shape featuring two\noverlapping peaks. In particular, the ratio between the value of $P_L(m)$ at\nthe peaks ($P_{L, max}$) and the value at the minimum in-between ($P_{L, min}$)\nbecomes $L$-independent at criticality.

This\nreformulation is shown to allow for a straightforward generalization of the CPT\nto the general non-equilibrium case using contour-ordered Green's functions.\nSolving the resulting generalized CPT equation on the discretized\nKeldysh-Matsubara time contour, the transient dynamics of an essentially\narbitrary initial pure or mixed state can be traced.

The relationship between\nantiferromagnetism and superconductivity provides key information to understand\nbetter superconductivity in Fe chalcogenides. Furthermore the significant\npressure effect on Tc in the Fe-chalcogenide superconductors, which is likely\nto be correlated with the crystal structure and/or magnetism, is important in\nelucidating the mechanism of Fe-based superconductivity. Due to the simple\nstructure and composition, Fe-chalcogenide superconductor is one candidate for\napplications to such areas as superconducting wires and thin films.\n","Comment: A review article published in a special issue \"100 years of\n  superconductivity\" in Z.

The resulting Abrikosov lattice of dual\nvortices translates into the periodic modulation of the Bogoliubov-deGennes gap\nfunction and the electronic density. We compute detailed signatures of various\nAbrikosov-Hofstadter dual vortex arrays in the single-particle local tunneling\ndensity of states. A 4x4 checkerboard-type modulation pattern naturally arises\nas an energetically favored ground state at and near the x = 1/8 doping and\nproduces good agreement with experimental observations.\n","Comment: 43 pages, 14 figures.
