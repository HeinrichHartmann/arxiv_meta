We report on follow-up observations by the WEBT to\nstudy the multiwavelength emission in the post-outburst phase. XMM-Newton\nobservations on July and December 2006 added information on the X-ray and UV\nfluxes. The source was in a faint state. The radio flux at the higher\nfrequencies showed a fast decreasing trend, which represents the tail of the\nbig radio outburst. It was followed by a quiescent state, common at all radio\nfrequencies. In contrast, moderate activity characterized the NIR and optical\nlight curves, with a progressive increase of the variability amplitude with\nincreasing wavelength. We ascribe this redder-when-brighter behaviour to the\npresence of a \"little blue bump\" due to line emission from the broad line\nregion, which is clearly visible in the source SED during faint states.\nMoreover, the data from the XMM-Newton OM reveal a rise of the SED in the UV,\nsuggesting the existence of a \"big blue bump\" due to thermal emission from the\naccretion disc. The X-ray spectra are well fitted with a power-law model with\nphotoelectric absorption, possibly larger than the Galactic one. However, the\ncomparison with previous X-ray observations would imply that the amount of\nabsorbing matter is variable. Alternatively, the intrinsic X-ray spectrum\npresents a curvature, which may depend on the X-ray brightness.

We examine the\nclustering properties of these stellar mass selected samples as a function of\nredshift and stellar mass, and discuss the implications of measured clustering\nstrengths in terms of their likely halo masses. We find that galaxies with high\nstellar masses have a progressively higher clustering strength, and amplitude,\nthan galaxies with lower stellar masses. We also find that galaxies within a\nfixed stellar mass range have a higher clustering strength at higher redshifts.\nWe furthermore use our measured clustering strengths, combined with models from\nMo & White (2002), to determine the average total masses of the dark matter\nhaloes hosting these galaxies. We conclude that for all galaxies in our sample\nthe stellar-mass-to-total-mass ratio is always lower than the universal\nbaryonic mass fraction. Using our results, and a compilation from the\nliterature, we furthermore show that there is a strong correlation between\nstellar-mass-to-total-mass ratio and derived halo masses for central galaxies,\nsuch that more massive haloes contain a lower fraction of their mass in the\nform of stars over our entire redshift range. For central galaxies in haloes\nwith masses M(halo)>10^13M(sun) we find that this ratio is <0.02, much lower\nthan the universal baryonic mass fraction. We show that the remaining baryonic\nmass is included partially in stars within satellite galaxies in these haloes,\nand as diffuse hot and warm gas. We also find that, at a fixed stellar mass,\nthe stellar-to-total-mass ratio increases at lower redshifts. This suggests\nthat galaxies at a fixed stellar mass form later in lower mass dark matter\nhaloes, and earlier in massive haloes.

In concurrent\nphase, loads of all failure nodes as well as new job arrival are assigned\nequally to all available nodes by just finding the least loaded node among the\nseveral nodes by failure nodes job allocation algorithm. Sequential and\nconcurrent executions of algorithms improve the performance as well better\nresource utilization. Dynamic rank based algorithm for load redistribution\nworks as a sequential restoration algorithm and reassignment algorithm for\ndistribution of failure nodes to least loaded computing nodes works as a\nconcurrent recovery reassignment algorithm. Since load is evenly and uniformly\ndistributed among all available working nodes with less number of iterations,\nlow iterative time and communication overheads hence performance is improved.\nDynamic ranking algorithm is low overhead, high convergence algorithm for\nreassignment of tasks uniformly among all available nodes. Reassignments of\nfailure nodes are done by a low overhead efficient failure job allocation\nalgorithm. Test results to show effectiveness of the proposed scheme are\npresented.\n","Comment: Online at http://journalofcomputing.org"]}]
