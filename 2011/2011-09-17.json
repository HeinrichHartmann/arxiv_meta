The corresponding Hamiltonian equations admit a spectral\nrepresentation with important applications to the theory of integrable systems.\nParticular cases make a link to Moser's work relating the solutions of Kepler's\nproblem to the geodesics on spaces of constant curvature, Newmann's mechanical\nproblem on the sphere and related geodesic problem of Jacobi on an ellipsoid.\n"]}]
