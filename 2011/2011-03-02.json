In the\nfirst, we discuss the task of coin tossing, principally in order to highlight\nthe effect different physical theories have on security in a straightforward\nmanner, but, also, to introduce a new protocol for non-relativistic strong coin\ntossing. This protocol matches the security of the best protocol known to date\nwhile using a conceptually different approach to achieve the task.\n  In the second part variable bias coin tossing is introduced. This is a\nvariant of coin tossing in which one party secretly chooses one of two biased\ncoins to toss. It is shown that this can be achieved with unconditional\nsecurity for a specified range of biases, and with cheat-evident security for\nany bias. We also discuss two further protocols which are conjectured to be\nunconditionally secure for any bias.\n  The third section looks at other two-party secure computations for which,\nprior to our work, protocols and no-go theorems were unknown. We introduce a\ngeneral model for such computations, and show that, within this model, a wide\nrange of functions are impossible to compute securely. We give explicit\ncheating attacks for such functions.\n  In the final chapter we discuss the task of expanding a private random\nstring, while dropping the usual assumption that the protocol's user trusts her\ndevices. Instead we assume that all quantum devices are supplied by an\narbitrarily malicious adversary. We give two protocols that we conjecture\nsecurely perform this task. The first allows a private random string to be\nexpanded by a finite amount, while the second generates an arbitrarily large\nexpansion of such a string.\n","Comment: The idea of using Bell inequalities to generate secure private\n  randomness has recently seen some revived attention in the literature (see\n  arXiv:0911.3427).

This is particularly true in the case of exoplanets close to\ntheir stars, for which one has to account both for an (often intense)\nirradiation flux, and from an intrinsic flux responsible for the progressive\nloss of the inner planetary heat. The goals of the present work are to help\nunderstanding the coupling between radiative transfer and advection in\nexoplanetary atmospheres and to provide constraints on the temperatures of the\ndeep atmospheres. This is crucial in assessing whether modifying assumed\nopacity sources and/or heat transport may explain the inflated sizes of a\nsignificant number of giant exoplanets found so far. I use a simple analytical\napproach inspired by Eddington's approximation for stellar atmospheres to\nderive a relation between temperature and optical depth valid for\nplane-parallel static grey atmospheres which are both transporting an intrinsic\nheat flux and receiving an outer radiation flux. The model is parameterized as\na function of mean visible and thermal opacities, respectively. The model is\nshown to reproduce relatively well temperature profiles obtained from more\nsophisticated radiative transfer calculations of exoplanetary atmospheres. It\nnaturally explains why a temperature inversion (stratosphere) appears when the\nopacity in the optical becomes significant compared to that in the infrared. I\nfurther show that the mean equivalent flux (proportional to T^4) is conserved\nin the presence of horizontal advection on constant optical depth levels. This\nimplies with these hypotheses that the deep atmospheric temperature used as\nouter boundary for the evolution models should be calculated from models\npertaining to the entire planetary atmosphere, not from ones that are relevant\nto the day side or to the substellar point. In these conditions, present-day\nmodels yield deep temperatures that are ~1000K too cold to explain the present\nsize of planet HD 209458b. An tenfold increase in the infrared to visible\nopacity ratio would be required to slow the planetary cooling and contraction\nsufficiently to explain its size. However, the mean equivalent flux is not\nconserved anymore in the presence of opacity variations, or in the case of\nnon-radiative vertical transport of energy: The presence of clouds on the night\nside or a downward transport of kinetic energy and its dissipation at deep\nlevels would help making the deep atmosphere hotter and may explain the\ninflated sizes of giant exoplanets.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 10 figures"]}]

The model predicts a zero-mass pion for zero-mass quarks and a Regge\nspectrum of linear trajectories with the same slope in the leading orbital\nangular momentum $L$ of hadrons and the radial quantum number $N$. Light-Front\nHolography maps the amplitudes which are functions of the fifth dimension\nvariable $z$ of anti-de Sitter space to a corresponding hadron theory quantized\non the light front.

The result is a semi-classical frame-independent\nfirst approximation to the spectra and light-front wavefunctions of meson and\nbaryon light-quark bound states, which in turn predict the behavior of the pion\nand nucleon form factors. The effects of chiral symmetry breaking increase as\none goes toward large interquark separation, consistent with spectroscopic\ndata, and the hadron eigenstates generally have components with different\norbital angular momentum; e.g., the proton eigenstate in AdS/QCD with massless\nquarks has L=0 and L=1 light-front Fock components with equal probability.

Given\nits large mass, its large radius cannot be explained by standard evolution\nmodels. Interestingly, the planet's parent star is an active, rapidly rotating\nsolar-like star with a large fraction (7 to 20%) of spots. Aims: We want to\nprovide constraints on the properties of the star-planet system and understand\nwhether the planet's inferred large size may be due to a systematic error on\nthe inferred parameters, and if not, how it may be explained. Methods: We\ncombine stellar and planetary evolution codes based on all available\nspectroscopic and photometric data to obtain self-consistent constraints on the\nsystem parameters. Results: We find no systematic error in the stellar modeling\n(including spots and stellar activity) that would yield the required ~10%\nreduction in size for the star and thus the planet. Two classes of solutions\nare found: the usual main sequence solution for the star yields for the planet\na mass of 3.67+/-0.13 Mjup, a radius of 1.55+/-0.03 Rjup for an age that is at\nleast 130Ma, and should be less than 500Ma given the star's fast rotation and\nsignificant activity. We identify another class of solutions on the pre-main\nsequence, in which case the planet's mass is 3.45\\pm 0.27 Mjup, its radius is\n1.50+/-0.06 Rjup for an age between 30 and 40 Ma. These extremely young\nsolutions provide the simplest explanation for the planet's size which can then\nbe matched by a simple contraction from an initially hot, expanded state,\nprovided the atmospheric opacities are increased by a factor ~3 compared to\nusual assumptions for solar compositions atmospheres. Other solutions imply in\nany case that the present inflated radius of CoRoT-2b is transient and the\nresult of an event that occurred less than 20 Ma ago: a giant impact with\nanother Jupiter-mass planet, or interactions with another object in the system\nwhich caused a significant rise of the eccentricity followed by the rapid\ncircularization of its orbit. Conclusions: Additional observations of CoRoT-2\nthat could help understanding this system include searches for infrared excess\nand the presence of a debris disk and searches for additional companions. The\ndetermination of a complete infrared lightcurve including both the primary and\nsecondary transits would also be extremely valuable to constrain the planet's\natmospheric properties and to determine the planet-to-star radius ratio in a\nmanner less vulnerable to systematic errors due to stellar activity.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 15 figures, accepted for A&A"]}]

However, guaranteeing that the output from a candidate\nrandom source could not have been predicted by an outside party is a\nchallenging task, and many supposedly random sources used today provide no such\nguarantee. Quantum solutions to this problem exist, for example a device which\ninternally sends a photon through a beam-splitter and observes on which side it\nemerges, but, presently, such solutions require the user to trust the internal\nworkings of the device. Here we seek to go beyond this limitation by asking\nwhether randomness can be generated using untrusted devices---even ones created\nby an adversarial agent---while providing a guarantee that no outside party\n(including the agent) can predict it. Since this is easily seen to be\nimpossible unless the user has an initially private random string, the task we\ninvestigate here is private randomness expansion.\n  We introduce a protocol for private randomness expansion with untrusted\ndevices which is designed to take as input an initially private random string\nand produce as output a longer private random string. We point out that private\nrandomness expansion protocols are generally vulnerable to attacks that can\nrender the initial string partially insecure, even though that string is used\nonly inside a secure laboratory; our protocol is designed to remove this\npreviously unconsidered vulnerability by privacy amplification.

For slightly increased\nlevels of jitter ($\\sim 4.5\\,m\\,s^{-1}$) the eccentricity of the inner planet\ncan be in the range $0<e_{inner}<0.07$, the period and eccentricity of the\nouter planet can be $440<P_{outer}<470$ days and $0.55<e_{outer}<0.85$\nrespectively, while the relative pericenter alignment, $\\eta$, of the planets\ncan take essentially any value $-180^{\\circ}<\\eta<+180^{\\circ}$.

However, they do not establish that the entropy loss during the\nglass transition is accompanied by a concomitant entropy gain of the medium to\nmaintain the second law. They use a novel statistical formulation of entropy\nbased on several conjectures such as it being zero for a microstate, but do not\ncompare its behavior with the thermodynamic entropy. The formulation is\ndesigned to show the entropy loss. Its subsequent rise not only contradicts our\nresult but also implies that the glass during relaxation must have a negative\nabsolute temperature. To understand these puzzling results and the above\nconjecture, we have carried out a critical evaluation of their unconventional\napproach. We find that the inverse conjecture is neither supported by their\napproach nor by the second law. The zero-entropy microstate conjecture is only\nconsistent with S(T_0,t)\\equiv 0 at all temperatures, not just at absolute zero\nand is found to have no scientific merit. We show that the maximum entropy gain\nof the medium during the glass transition invalidates the entropy loss\nconjecture. After pointing out other misleading, confusing and highly\nexaggerated statements in their work, we finally conclude that their\nunconventional statistical approach and computational scheme are not\nappropriate for glasses.\n","Comment: 45 pages, 2 figures"]}]
