We study the relativistic particle velocities in details, and show\nthat there exist both subluminal and superluminal particle propagations. In\nparticular, the additional contributions to the particle velosity \\delta\nv\\equiv (v-c)/c from string theory is proportional to both the particle energy\nand the D3-brane number density, and is inversely proportional to the string\nscale. Thus, we can realize the background dependent Lorentz violation\nnaturally by varying the D3-brane number density in space time. To explain the\nsuperluminal neutrino propagations in the OPERA and MINOS experiments, the\nstring scale should be around 10^5 GeV. With very tiny D3-brane number density\non the interstellar scale, we can also explain the time delays for the high\nenergy photons compared to the low energy photons in the MAGIC, HESS, and FERMI\nexperiments simultaneously. Interestingly, we can automatically satisfy all the\nstringent constraints from the synchrotron radiation of the Crab Nebula, the\nSN1987a observations on neutrinos, and the cosmic ray experiments on charged\nleptons. We also address the possible phenomenological challenges to our models\nfrom the relevant experiments done on the Earth.\n","Comment: RevTex4, 14 pages, 1 figure, minor corrections, references added.\n  arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:0903.1303"]}]
