This\nlocality of interactions is inherited by a decay of correlation functions, but\nalso reflected by scaling laws of a quite profound quantity: The entanglement\nentropy of ground states. This entropy of the reduced state of a subregion\noften merely grows like the boundary area of the subregion, and not like its\nvolume, in sharp contrast with an expected extensive behavior. Such \"area laws\"\nfor the entanglement entropy and related quantities have received considerable\nattention in recent years. They emerge in several seemingly unrelated fields,\nin the context of black hole physics, quantum information science, and quantum\nmany-body physics where they have important implications on the numerical\nsimulation of lattice models. In this Colloquium we review the current status\nof area laws in these fields. Center stage is taken by rigorous results on\nlattice models in one and higher spatial dimensions. The differences and\nsimilarities between bosonic and fermionic models are stressed, area laws are\nrelated to the velocity of information propagation, and disordered systems,\nnon-equilibrium situations, classical correlation concepts, and topological\nentanglement entropies are discussed. A significant proportion of the article\nis devoted to the quantitative connection between the entanglement content of\nstates and the possibility of their efficient numerical simulation.

The formation of the magnetospheric\ncavity and its elongation is obtained with the classical structure of a\nmagnetosphere with parallel lobes. An impulsive disturbance is then applied to\nthe system by changing the bulk velocity of the solar wind to simulate a\ndecrease in the solar wind dynamic pressure followed by its recovery. In\nresponse to the imposed disturbance, a gap [abrupt depression] in the incoming\nsolar wind plasma appears moving toward the Earth. The gap's size is a ~15 RE\nand is comparable to the sizes previously obtained for both Bz<0 and Bz =0.\nDuring the initial phase of the disturbance, the dayside magnetopause (MP)\nexpands slower than the previous cases of IMF orientations as a result of the\ndepression. The size of the MP expands nonlinearly due to strengthening of its\nouter boundary by the northward IMF.

Both the O-C analysis and evolution of the\nsuperhumps light curve favour the model in which superhumps originate in a\nvariable source located in the vicinity of the hot spot. In addition, the\nevolution of the light curve suggests that the superhump light source\napproaches the disc plane as the superoutburst declines.

Using potential of mean force calculations, the\nintermediate is found to spontaneously accept a proton to form a carboxylate\nacid group at pH<9.0, and the subsequent cleavage of a C-OH bond to form CO is\nexothermic and associated with a small free energy barrier.
