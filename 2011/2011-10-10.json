The asymmetric potential can rectify the\nmotion of vortices and cause a net flow without any unbiased external drive,\nwhich is called ratchet effect. With an applied ac current, the potential can\nrectify the motion of vortices in the channel and induce a dc net flow. We show\nthat the net flow of vortices strongly depends on vortex density and frequency\nof the driving current. Depending on the density, we distinguish a\n\"single-vortex\" rectification regime (low density) determined by the\npotential-energy landscape inside each cell of the channel (i.e., \"hard\" and\n\"easy\" directions of motion) and \"multi-vortex\", or \"collective\", rectification\n(high density) when the interaction between vortices becomes important. The\nfrequency of the driving ac current determines a possible distance that a\nvortex could move during one period. For high frequency current, vortices only\noscillate in the triangular cell. For low frequency, the vortex angular\nvelocity $\\omega$ increases nearly linearly until the driving force reaches the\nmaximum friction force in the hard direction.

Orbital motion provides insight into the stability, and\npossible formation mechanisms of this planetary system. Dynamical studies can\nalso provide constraints on the planets' masses, which help calibrate\nevolutionary models.

Our analysis shows that peace does not depend on integrated\ncoexistence, but rather on well defined topographical and political boundaries\nseparating groups. Mountains and lakes are an important part of the boundaries\nbetween sharply defined linguistic areas. Political canton and circle\n(sub-canton) boundaries often separate religious groups.

In this research report, we focus on wireless\nsensor networks with grid topologies. How does a coloring algorithm take\nadvantage of the regularity of grid topology to provide an optimal periodic\ncoloring, that is a coloring with the minimum number of colors? We propose the\nVector-Based Coloring Method, denoted VCM, a new method that is able to provide\nan optimal periodic coloring for any radio transmission range and for any h-hop\ncoloring, h>=1. This method consists in determining at which grid nodes a color\ncan be reproduced without creating interferences between these nodes while\nminimizing the number of colors used. We compare the number of colors provided\nby VCM with the number of colors obtained by a distributed coloring algorithm\nwith line and column priority assignments. We also provide bounds on the number\nof colors of optimal general colorings of the infinite grid, and show that\nperiodic colorings (and thus VCM) are asymptotically optimal.

Patch or grid based AMR often employs ghost cells to decouple\nthe hyperbolic advances of each grid on a given refinement level. This\ndecoupling allows each grid to be advanced independently. In AstroBEAR we\nutilize this independence by threading the grid advances on each level with\npreference going to the finer level grids. This allows for global load\nbalancing instead of level by level load balancing and allows for greater\nparallelization across both physical space and AMR level. Threading of level\nadvances can also improve performance by interleaving communication with\ncomputation, especially in deep simulations with many levels of refinement.
