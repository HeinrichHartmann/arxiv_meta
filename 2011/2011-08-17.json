The existence of axions is first diagnosed by gaps in the mass vs\nspin plot of astrophysical black holes. For young black holes the allowed\nvalues of spin are quantized, giving rise to \"Regge trajectories\" inside the\ngap region. The axion cloud can also be observed directly either through\nprecision mapping of the near horizon geometry or through gravitational waves\ncoming from the Bosenova explosion, as well as axion transitions and\nannihilations in the gravitational atom. Our estimates suggest that these\nsignals are detectable in upcoming experiments, such as Advanced LIGO, AGIS,\nand LISA. Current black hole spin measurements imply an upper bound on the QCD\naxion decay constant of 2 x 10^17 GeV, while Advanced LIGO can detect signals\nfrom a QCD axion cloud with a decay constant as low as the GUT scale. We\nfinally discuss the possibility of observing the gamma-rays associated with the\nBosenova explosion and, perhaps, the radio waves from axion-to-photon\nconversion for the QCD axion.\n","Comment: 54 pages, 15 figures; v2: PRD version, small correction in eq. 48 and\n  53 as well as fig. 10, conclusions unchanged"]}]

In this model, the intra-dimer exchange coupling J>0 is\nantiferromagnetic, while the inter-dimer exchange couplings are ferromagnetic\nand take different values, J_x,J_y<0, in the two bond directions. Anticipating\nthat the highly frustrated character of this model may lead to a wide range of\nbehaviors in (CuCl)LaNb2O7 and related compounds, we theoretically investigate\nthe ground state phase diagram of this model in detail using the following\nthree approaches: a strong-coupling expansion for small J_x and J_y, exact\ndiagonalization for finite clusters, and a Schwinger boson mean field theory.\nWhen |J_x|, |J_y| <~ J, the system stays in a dimer singlet phase with a finite\nspin gap. This state is adiabatically connected to the decoupled-dimer limit\nJ_x=J_y=0. We show that the magnetization process of this phase depends\ncrucially on the spatial anisotropy of the inter-dimer couplings. The\nmagnetization shows a jump or a smooth increase for weak and strong anisotropy,\nrespectively, after the spin gap closes at a certain magnetic field. When |J_x|\nor |J_y| >~ J, quantum phase transitions to various magnetically ordered phases\n(ferromagnetic, collinear stripe, and spiral) occur.

We show that, in the finite dimensional case, exactness and\nlifting property are dual pairs, that is, an operator system $S$ is exact if\nand only if the dual operator system $S^d$ has the lifting property. Moreover,\nthe lifting property is preserved under quotients by null subspaces.

In modern\nhigh-dimensional applications, a common approach to finding sparse positive\ndefinite matrices is to threshold their small off-diagonal elements. This\nthresholding, sometimes referred to as hard-thresholding, sets small elements\nto zero. Thresholding has the attractive property that the resulting matrices\nare sparse, and are thus easier to interpret and work with. In many\napplications, it is often required, and thus implicitly assumed, that\nthresholded matrices retain positive definiteness. In this paper we formally\ninvestigate the algebraic properties of p.d. matrices which are thresholded.

In order to improve the\nsignal to noise ratio of the experiment, it is necessary to reject a\nsignificant fraction of hadronic showers. Traditional background rejection\nmethods based on image shape parameters have been extensively used for the data\nfrom imaging telescopes. However, non-imaging Cerenkov telescopes have to\ndevelop very different means of statistically identifying and removing cosmic\nray events. Some of the parameters which could be potentially important for\nnon-imaging arrays are the temporal and spectral differences, the lateral\ndistributions and density fluctuations of Cerenkov photons generated by gamma\nray and hadron primaries. Here we study the differences in fluctuations of\nCerenkov photon density in the light pool at the observation level from showers\ninitiated by photons and those initiated by protons or heavier nuclei. The\ndatabase of simulated events for the PACT array has been used to evaluate the\nefficiency of the new technique. Various types of density fluctuations like the\nshort range and medium range fluctuations as well as flatness parameter are\nstudied. The estimated quality factors reflect the efficiencies with which the\nhadrons can be rejected from the data. Since some of these parameters are\nindependent, the cuts may be applied in tandem and we demonstrate that the\nproton rejection efficiency of about 90% can be achieved.

Universality arguments show that a continuous (second-order)\ntransition must be related to a 3-D universality class characterized by a\ncomplex N_f X N_f matrix order parameter and by the symmetry-breaking pattern\n[SU(N_f)_L X SU(N_f)_R]/Z(N_f)_V -> SU(N_f)_V/Z(N_f)_V, or [U(N_f)_L X\nU(N_f)_R]/U(1)_V -> U(N_f)_V/U(1)_V if the U(1)_A symmetry is effectively\nrestored at T_c. The existence of any of these universality classes requires\nthe presence of a stable fixed point in the corresponding 3-D Phi^4 theory with\nthe expected symmetry-breaking pattern. Otherwise, the transition is of first\norder. In order to search for stable fixed points in these Phi^4 theories, we\nexploit a 3-D perturbative approach in which physical quantities are expanded\nin powers of appropriate renormalized quartic couplings. We compute the\ncorresponding Callan-Symanzik beta-functions to six loops. We also determine\nthe large-order behavior to further constrain the analysis. No stable fixed\npoint is found, except for N_f=2, corresponding to the symmetry-breaking\npattern [SU(2)_L X SU(2)_R]/Z(2)_V -> SU(2)_V/Z(2)_V equivalent to O(4) ->\nO(3). Our results confirm and put on a firmer ground earlier analyses performed\nclose to four dimensions, based on first-order calculations in the framework of\nthe epsilon=4-d expansion. These results indicate that the finite-temperature\nphase transition in QCD is of first order for N_f>2. A continuous transition is\nallowed only for N_f=2. But, since the theory with symmetry-breaking pattern\n[U(2)_L X U(2)_R]/U(1)_V -> U(2)_V/U(1)_V does not have stable fixed points,\nthe transition can be continuous only if the effective breaking of the U(1)_A\nsymmetry is sufficiently large.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 3 figs, minor corrections"]}]

The analysis of the SO(3) coadjoint orbits\ncontained in the N-body phase space implies the existence of a {\\it spin frame}\nfor the N-body system. Then, the existence of appropriate non-symmetry\nHamiltonian {\\it right actions} for non-rigid systems leads to the construction\nof a N-dependent discrete number of {\\it dynamical body frames} for the N-body\nsystem, hence to the associated notions of {\\it dynamical} and {\\it measurable}\norientation and shape variables, angular velocity, rotational and vibrational\nconfigurations. For N=3 the dynamical body frame turns out to be unique and our\napproach reproduces the {\\it xxzz gauge} of the gauge theory associated with\nthe {\\it orientation-shape} SO(3) principal bundle approach of Littlejohn and\nReinsch.
