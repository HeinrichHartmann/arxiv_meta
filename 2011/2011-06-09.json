In this work, we employ a phenomenological entropy form of\nideal gas, first proposed by White & Narayan, to revisit this issue. By\ncalculating the first-order variation of the entropy, subject to the mass- and\nenergy-conservation constraints, we obtain an entropy stationary equation.\nIncorporated with the Jeans equation, and by specifying some functional form\nfor the anisotropy parameter beta, we numerically solve the two equations, and\ndemonstrate that the velocity anisotropy parameter plays an important role to\nattain a density profile that is finite in mass, energy, and spatial extent. If\nincorporated again with some empirical density profile from simulations, our\ntheoretical predictions of the anisotropy parameter, and the radial\npseudo-phase-space density in the outer non-gravitationally degenerate region\nof the dark matter halo, agree rather well with the simulation data, and the\npredictions are also acceptable in the middle weak-degenerate region of the\ndark halo. The second-order variational calculus reveals the seemingly\nparadoxical but actually complementary consequence that the equilibrium state\nof self-gravitating systems is the global minimum entropy state for the whole\nsystem under long-range violent relaxation, but simultaneously the local\nmaximum entropy state for every and any small part of the system under\nshort-range two-body relaxation and Landau damping. This minimum-maximum\nentropy duality means that the standard second law of thermodynamics needs to\nbe re-expressed or generalized for self-gravitating systems. We believe that\nour findings, especially the complementary second law of thermodynamics, may\nprovide crucial clues to the development of the statistical physics of\nself-gravitating systems as well as other long-range interaction systems.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 6 eps figures, to be published in MNRAS, final version"]}]

The occurrence\nof repeated reflection, transmission and trapping regions for increasing\nstrengths of an optical lattice defect are shown to be due to impurity modes\ninside the defect potential with chemical potentials and numbers of atoms\nmatching corresponding quantities of an incoming gap-soliton. For gap-solitons\nwith chemical potentials very close to band edges, the number of resonances\nobserved in the scattering coincides with the number of bound states which can\nexist in the defect potential for the given defect strength. The dependence of\nthe positions and widths of the transmission resonant on the incoming\ngap-soliton velocities are investigated by means of a defect mode analysis and\neffective mass theory. The comparisons with direct integrations of the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation provide a very good agreement confirming the\ncorrectness of our interpretation.

Here, density\nrefers to the proportion of the number of edges present in that graph. When\ntopological metrics based on shortest paths are of interest, such\ndensity-integration usually necessitates the iterative application of\nDijkstra's algorithm in order to compute the shortest path matrix at each\ndensity level. In this short note, we describe a recursive shortest path\nalgorithm based on single edge updating, which replaces the need for the\niterative use of Dijkstra's algorithm. Our proposed procedure is based on pairs\nof breadth-first searches around each of the vertices incident to the edge\nadded at each recursion. An algorithmic analysis of the proposed technique is\nprovided. When the graph of interest is coded as an adjacency list, our\nalgorithm can be shown to be more efficient than an iterative use of Dijkstra's\nalgorithm.\n"]}]

The method of deriving photometric metallicities using red giant branch\nstars is applied to resolved stellar populations under the common assumption\nthat they mainly consist of single-age old stellar populations. We explore the\neffect of the presence of mixed-age stellar populations on deriving photometric\nmetallicities. Methods. We use photometric data sets for the five Galactic\ndwarf spheroidals Sculptor, Sextans, Carina, Fornax, and Leo II in order to\nderive their photometric metallicity distribution functions from their resolved\nred giant branches using isochrones of the Dartmouth Stellar Evolutionary\nDatabase. We compare the photometric metallicities with published spectroscopic\nmetallicities based on the analysis of the near-infrared Ca triplet (Ca T),\nboth on the metallicity scale of Carretta & Gratton and on the scale defined by\nthe Dartmouth isochrones. In addition, we compare the photometric metallicities\nwith published spectroscopic metallicities based on spectral synthesis and\nmedium-resolution spectroscopy, and on high resolution spectra where available.\nResults. The mean properties of the spectroscopic and photometric metallicity\nsamples are comparable within the intrinsic scatter of each method although the\nmean metallicities of dSphs with pronounced intermediate-age population\nfractions may be underestimated by the photometric method by up to a few tenths\nof dex in [Fe/H].

The galaxies in our sample have line fluxes with S/N>3 and\nwere separated using a standard diagnostic diagram into Star Forming Galaxies\n(SFGs; 36.0%), Transition type Objects (TOs; 28.4%) and Narrow-Line AGNs\n(NLAGNs; 35.6%). Having found a strong correlation between the bulge mass and\nthe NLAGN phenomenon, we have applied the same relation as for the Broad-Line\nAGNs to estimate their black hole (BH) masses. The BH in the NLAGNs are 2 to 3\norders lower in mass than the BHs found in BLAGNs, but are comparable to those\nobserved in Narrow-Line Seyfert~1, although none of our objects can be\nclassified as such. To determine the metallicities, [O/H], of the NLAGNs we\ncalibrated the standard diagnostic diagram [OIII]/Hb vs. [NII]/Ha using similar\nrelation as for the SFGs, which reproduce the values obtained with CLOUDY\nsimulations developed for Bennert et al. [3]. For some individual objects we\ncompared our line ratios with other CLOUDY similations by different authors.\nThis suggests we achieve a typical uncertainty of 0.2 dex on [O/H], increasing\nto 0.3-0.5 in the Seyfert~2 (S2). This calibration suggests the metallicities\nof the NLAGNs are subsolar, varying between 1 and 0.3 $Z_\\odot$. We find two\nstatistically significant positive correlations: for [O/H] with the BH mass and\nfor [O/H] with the luminosity at 5100\\AA, $\\lambda L(5100$\\AA$)$. No\ncorrelation is found between [O/H] and the accretion rate, L_bol/L_Edd.\nHowever, comparisons with the BLAGNs suggest the NLAGNs extend the\nmetallicity-accretion rate relationship [24] to the low metallicity regime.\nAlthough the NLS1 have similar BH masses as the NLAGNs they show higher\naccretion rates, which is consistent with their higher metallicities.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures, Proceeding of Science (NLS1) 065"]}]
