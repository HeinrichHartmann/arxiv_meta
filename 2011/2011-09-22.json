The origin of this\nmass term is the simultaneous existence of the constant non-zero $AdS_5$\ncurvature and the loss of general co-ordinate invariance via LIV in the 5-d\ntheory.

Fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range of\nbulge fractions as spiral galaxies. The slow rotators are rounder and are\ngenerally consistent with being genuine, namely spheroidal-like, elliptical\ngalaxies.

We study for the first time the\nkinematic morphology-density T-Sigma relation using fast and slow rotators to\nreplace lenticulars and ellipticals.

The existence of a smooth kinematic T-Sigma\nrelation in the field excludes processes related to the cluster environment as\nmain contributors to the apparent conversion of spirals into fast-rotators in\nlow-density environments.

In Section III,\nI first present an overview of the diversity of cellular motility mechanisms,\nwhich might at first glance be categorized into two different types of\nbehaviors, namely \"swimming\" and \"crawling\". Intracellular transport, mitosis -\nor cell division - as well as other extensions of cell motility that rely on\nthe same essential machinery are briefly sketched. In Section IV, I introduce\nthe molecular machinery that underlies cell motility - the cytoskeleton - as\nwell as its interactions with the external environment of the cell and its main\nregulatory pathways. Sections IV D to IV F are more detailed in their\nbiochemical presentations; readers primarily interested in the theoretical\nmodeling of cell motility might want to skip these sections in a first reading.\nI then describe the motility mechanisms that rely essentially on\npolymerization-depolymerization dynamics of cytoskeleton filaments in Section\nV, and the ones that rely essentially on the activity of motor proteins in\nSection VI. Finally, Section VII is devoted to the description of the\nintegrated approaches that have been developed recently to try to understand\nthe cooperative phenomena that underly self-organization of the cell\ncytoskeleton as a whole.\n","Comment: 31 pages, 16 figures, 295 references"]}]

We study a set of simple\nscenarios where the variability is produced by injection of relativistic\nelectrons as a `shock front' crosses the emission region. We consider emission\nfrom two components, with the second one either being pre-existing and\nco-spatial and participating in the evolution of the active region, or\nspatially separated and independent, only diluting the observed variability.\nTemporal and spectral results of the simulation are compared to the\nmultiwavelength observations of Mrk 421 in March 2001.

These\nfeatures are among those affected by the spatial extent and geometry of the\nsource. The difficulty of producing hard X-ray lags is exacerbated by a bias\ntowards soft lags caused by the combination of energy dependent radiative\ncooling time-scales and LCTE. About the second emission component, our results\nstrongly favor the scenario where it is co-spatial and it participates in the\nflare evolution, suggesting that different phases of activity may occur in the\nsame region.

Initial ternary-ordered models are constructed by placing all the atoms\nat the ideal honeycomb sites, leading to plausible space groups of P63/mcm for\n14H-type and C2/m, P3112 or P3212 for 18R-type. Characteristic ordered feature\nis well represented by the local Zn6RE8 clusters, which are embedded in the\nfcc-stacking layers in accordance with the L12-type short-range order.\nEnergy-favored structural relaxations of the initial model cause significant\ndisplacements of the Zn/RE positions, implying that strong Zn-RE interactions\nmay play a critical role for the phase stability. The LPSO phases seem to\ntolerate a considerable degree of disorder at the Zn and RE sites with\nstatistical co-occupations by Mg, extending the non-stoichiometry phase region\nbounded along the Zn/RE equi-atomic line from ~Mg94.0Zn2.0Y4.0 to\n~Mg83.3Zn8.3Y8.3.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 1 table, 9 figures, accepted for publication in Acta\n  Materialia"]}]

At higher\ntemperatures, the behaviour is still essentially unknown. Here we analyse\ncombined SUMER/SoHO and EIS/Hinode observations of the quiet Sun around disk\ncentre to determine, for the first time, the average Doppler shift of several\nspectral lines formed between 1 and 2 MK, where the largest part of the quiet\ncoronal emission is formed. The measurements are based on a novel technique\napplied to EIS spectra to measure the difference in Doppler shift between lines\nformed at different temperatures. Simultaneous wavelength-calibrated SUMER\nspectra allow establishing the absolute value at the reference temperature of 1\nMK. The average line shifts at 1 MK < T < 1.8 MK are modestly, but clearly\nbluer than those observed at 1 MK. By accepting an average blue shift of about\n(-1.8+/-0.6) km/s at 1 MK (as provided by SUMER measurements), this translates\ninto a maximum Doppler shift of (-4.4+/-2.2) km/s around 1.8 MK. The measured\nvalue appears to decrease to about (-1.3+/-2.6) km/s at the Fe XV formation\ntemperature of 2.1 MK. The measured average Doppler shift between 0.01 and 2.1\nMK, for which we provide a parametrisation, appears to be qualitatively and\nroughly quantitatively consistent with what foreseen by 3-D coronal models\nwhere heating is produced by dissipation of currents induced by photospheric\nmotions and by reconnection with emerging magnetic flux.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 10 figures.
