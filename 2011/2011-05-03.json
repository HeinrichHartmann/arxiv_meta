Rc^{it}(D) is a lower bound to the optimal performance theoretically\nattainable (OPTA) by any causal source code, namely Rc^{op}(D).

The RV signal imprinted by a few Earth-mass planet\naround a cool star is at the limit of the typical single measurement\nuncertainty obtained using state-of-the-art spectrographs. This requires\nrelying on statistics in order to unearth signals buried below noise. Artifacts\nintroduced by observing cadences can produce spurious signals or mask genuine\nplanets that should be easily detected otherwise. Here we discuss a\nparticularly confusing statistical degeneracy resulting from the yearly\naliasing of the first eccentric harmonic of an already-detected planet. This\nproblem came sharply into focus after the recent announcement of the detection\nof a 3.1 Earth mass planet candidate in the habitable zone of the nearby low\nmass star GJ 581. The orbital period of the new candidate planet (GJ 581g)\ncorresponds to an alias of the first eccentric harmonic of a previously\nreported planet, GJ 581d. Although the star is stable, the combination of the\nobserving cadence and the presence of multiple planets can cause period\nmisinterpretations.

We also discuss the implications of our\nanalysis for the recent Bayesian studies of the same data set, which failed to\nconfirm the existence of the new planet.

We also consider the consequences of late dissipation\nand a two-component (early and late) jet model for the high-energy (GeV-TeV)\nemission. We study not only synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission from the\nearly and late jets but also external inverse-Compton (EIC) emission, which is\nnaturally predicted in the late dissipation model. For the latter, we perform\nnumerical calculations taking into account the equal-arrival-time surface of\nEIC photons and show that the EIC component typically has a peak at ~1-100 GeV\nwhich may dominate over the SSC components. We demonstrate that very high\nenergy gamma rays from both these components are detectable for nearby and/or\nenergetic gamma-ray bursts, with current and future Cherenkov detectors such as\nMAGIC, VERITAS, CTA and HAWC, and possibly Fermi. Although the expected event\nrate would not be large, detections should be useful as a test of the model.\nMulti-wavelength observations using both the ground-based telescopes and the\nSwift and/or Fermi satellites are also important to constrain the models.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 16 figures, minor revisions; published in ApJ 04/19/2011;\n  accepted 03/03/2011"]}]

Since unlicensed users are temporary visitors to the\nlicensed spectrum, they are required to vacate the spectrum when a licensed\nuser reclaims it. Due to the randomness of the appearance of licensed users,\ndisruptions to both licensed and unlicensed communications are often difficult\nto prevent. In this chapter, a proactive spectrum handoff framework for CR ad\nhoc networks is proposed to address these concerns. In the proposed framework,\nchannel switching policies and a proactive spectrum handoff protocol are\nproposed to let unlicensed users vacate a channel before a licensed user\nutilizes it to avoid unwanted interference. Network coordination schemes for\nunlicensed users are also incorporated into the spectrum handoff protocol\ndesign to realize channel rendezvous. Moreover, a distributed channel selection\nscheme to eliminate collisions among unlicensed users is proposed. In our\nproposed framework, unlicensed users coordinate with each other without using a\ncommon control channel. We compare our proposed proactive spectrum handoff\nprotocol with a reactive spectrum handoff protocol, under which unlicensed\nusers switch channels after collisions with licensed transmissions occur.\nSimulation results show that our proactive spectrum handoff outperforms the\nreactive spectrum handoff approach in terms of higher throughput and fewer\ncollisions to licensed users. In addition, we propose a novel three dimensional\ndiscrete-time Markov chain to characterize the process of reactive spectrum\nhandoffs and analyze the performance of unlicensed users.

One of the main challenges in dynamic spectrum\naccess is to determine when the \\emph{secondary} (unlicensed) users can use the\nspectrum. In particular, when the secondary user is using the spectrum, if the\nprimary user becomes active to use the spectrum, it is usually hard for the\nsecondary user to detect the primary user instantaneously, thus causing\nunexpected interference and delay to primary users. The secondary user cannot\ndetect the presence of primary users instantaneously because the secondary user\nis unable to detect the spectrum at the same time while it is transmitting. To\nsolve this problem, we propose the full duplex wireless communications scheme\nfor CRNs. In particular, we employ the Antennas Cancellation (AC), the RF\nInterference Cancellation (RIC), and the Digital Interference Cancellation\n(DIC) techniques for secondary users so that the secondary user can scan for\nactive primary users while it is transmitting. Once detecting the presence of\nprimary users, the secondary user will release the spectrum instantaneously to\navoid the interference and delay to primary users. We analyze the packet loss\nrate of primary users in wireless full duplex CRNs, and compare them with the\npacket loss rate of primary users in wireless half duplex CRNs. Our analyses\nand simulations show that using our developped wireless full duplex CRNs, the\npacket loss rate of primary users can be significantly decreased as compared\nwith that of primary users by using the half duplex CRNs.\n"]}]

The most important secular parameters are the forced\neccentricity and secular frequency, which depend on the initial conditions of\nthe particles, as well as on the mass and orbital parameters of the secondary\nstar. We construct a second-order theory (with respect to the masses) for the\nplanar secular motion of small planetasimals and deduce new expressions for the\nforced eccentricity and secular frequency. We also reanalyze the radial\nvelocity data available for Gamma-Cephei and present a series of orbital\nsolutions leading to residuals compatible with the best fits. Finally, we\ndiscuss how different orbital configurations for Gamma-Cephei may affect the\ndynamics of small bodies in circunmstellar motion. For Gamma-Cephei, we find\nthat the classical first-order expressions for the secular frequency and forced\neccentricity lead to large inaccuracies around 50 % for semimajor axes larger\nthan one tenth the orbital separation between the stellar components. Low\neccentricities and/or masses reduce the importance of the second-order terms.\nThe dynamics of small planetesimals only show a weak dependence with the\norbital fits of the stellar components, and the same result is found including\nthe effects of a nonlinear gas drag. Thus, the possibility of planetary\nformation in this binary system largely appears insensitive to the orbital fits\nadopted for the stellar components, and any future alterations in the system\nparameters (due to new observations) should not change this picture. Finally,\nwe show that planetesimals migrating because of gas drag may be trapped in\nmean-motion resonances with the binary, even though the migration is divergent.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 9 figures"]}]

An effective approach for Green Wireless\nCommunications is On-Demand strategy, which scales power consumption with the\nvolume and location of user demand. Applying the On-Demand Communications\nmodel, we propose a novel scheme -- Wireless Resource Trading, which\ncharacterizes the trading relationship among different wireless resources for a\ngiven number of performance metrics. According to wireless resource trading\nrelationship, different wireless resources can be consumed for the same set of\nperformance metrics. Therefore, to minimize the energy consumption for given\nperformance metrics, we can trade the other type of wireless resources for the\nenergy resource under the demanded performance metrics. Based on the wireless\nresource trading relationship, we derive the optimal energy-bandwidth and\nenergy-time wireless resource trading relationship for green wireless\ncommunications. We also develop an adaptive trading strategy by using different\nbandwidths or different delays for different transmission distances with\navailable bandwidths and acceptable delay bounds in wireless networks. Our\nconducted simulations show that the energy consumption of wireless networks can\nbe significantly reduced with our proposed wireless resources trading scheme.\n"]}]

We show through numerical calculations that as the distance between the\nplate and central object decreases, there is an intermediate regime in which\nthe repulsive force increases dramatically. Beyond this, the force rapidly\nswitches over to attraction as the separation decreases further to zero, in\nline with the proximity force approximation. We demonstrate that this effect\ncan be understood as a competition between an increased repulsion due to a\nlarger polarizability of the central object interacting with increased fringing\nfields near the edge of the plate, and attractive forces due primarily to the\nnonzero thickness of the plate. In comparison with our previous work, we find\nthat using the same plate geometry but replacing the single cylinder with a\nring of cylinders, or more generally an extended uniaxial conductor, the\nrepulsive force can be enhanced by a factor of approximately $10^3$. We\nconclude that this enhancement, although quite dramatic, is still too small to\nyield detectable repulsive Casimir forces.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures"]}]

These variances can be weighted at various spatial\nscales, leading to a family of multi-scale mixing measures and efficiencies. We\nderive a priori estimates on these efficiencies from the advection--diffusion\npartial differential equation, focusing on a broad class of statistically\nhomogeneous and isotropic incompressible flows. The analysis produces bounds on\nthe mixing efficiencies in terms of the Peclet number, a measure the strength\nof the stirring relative to molecular diffusion. We show by example that the\nestimates are sharp for particular source, sink and flow combinations. In\ngeneral the high-Peclet number behavior of the bounds (scaling exponents as\nwell as prefactors) depends on the structure and smoothness properties of, and\nlength scales in, the scalar source and sink distribution. The fundamental\nmodel of the stirring of a monochromatic source/sink combination by the random\nsine flow is investigated in detail via direct numerical simulation and\nanalysis. The large-scale mixing efficiency follows the upper bound scaling\n(within a logarithm) at high Peclet number but the intermediate and small-scale\nefficiencies are qualitatively less than optimal.
