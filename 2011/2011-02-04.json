Computational\ngrids to provide a user to solve large scale problem by spreading a single\nlarge computation across multiple machines of physical location. QoS based User\nDriven scheduler for grid also provides reliability of the grid systems and\nincrease the performance of the grid to reducing the execution time of job by\napplying scheduling policies defined by the user. The main aim of this paper is\nto distribute the computational load among the available grid nodes and to\ndeveloped a QoS based scheduling algorithm for grid and making grid more\nreliable.Grid computing system is different from conventional distributed\ncomputing systems by its focus on large scale resource sharing, where\nprocessors and communication have significant inuence on Grid computing\nreliability. Reliability capabilities initiated by end users from within\napplications they submit to the grid for execution. Reliability of\ninfrastructure and management services that perform essential functions\nnecessary for grid systems to operate, such as resource allocation and\nscheduling.\n","Comment: 9 pages, ACIJ"]}]

Interpreting the\n$q$-Fock space as an algebra of \"random variables\" exhibiting a specific\ncommutativity structure, one can construct the so-called $q$-semicircular and\n$q$-circular operators acting as $q$-deformations of the classical Gaussian and\ncomplex Gaussian random variables, respectively. While the $q$-semicircular\noperator is generally well understood, many basic properties of the\n$q$-circular operator (in particular, a tractable expression for its norm)\nremain elusive. Inspired by the combinatorial approach to free probability, we\nrevist the combinatorial formulations of these operators. We point out that a\nfinite alternating-sum expression for $2n$-norm of the $q$-semicircular is\navailable via generating functions of chord-crossing diagrams developed by\nTouchard in the 1950s and distilled by Riordan in 1974. Extending these norms\nas a function in $q$ onto the complex unit ball and taking the $n\\to\\infty$\nlimit, we recover the familiar expression for the norm of the $q$-semicircular\nand show that the convergence is uniform on the compact subsets of the unit\nball. In contrast, the $2n$-norms of the $q$-circular are encoded by\nchord-crossing diagrams that are parity-reversing, which have not yet been\ncharacterized in the combinatorial literature. We derive certain combinatorial\nproperties of these objects, including closed-form expressions for the number\nof such diagrams of any size with up to eleven crossings. These properties\nenable us to conclude that the $2n$-norms of the $q$-circular operator are\nsignificantly less well behaved than those of the $q$-semicircular operator.\n"]}]
