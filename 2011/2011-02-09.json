Specifically, the two loop gap equation is evaluated and the Gribov mass\nis expressed in terms of the coupling constant. The one loop corrections to the\npropagators of all the fields are determined. It is shown that when the gap\nequation is satisfied the Faddeev-Popov ghost and both Bose and Grassmann\nlocalizing ghosts all enhance in the infrared limit at one loop. This verifies\nthat the Kugo-Ojima confinement criterion holds to this order and we also show\nthat both Grassmann ghosts are enhanced at two loops. For the Bose ghost we\ndetermine the full form of the propagator in the zero momentum limit for both\nthe transverse and longitudinal pieces and confirm Zwanziger's recent general\nanalysis for the low energy behaviour.

In this theory\nthe motion of an electron is considered to occur along a trajectory the\npresence of which is a reflection of the existence of a particle, as well as it\nis assumed that any motion is defined by a wave V(x,t). It is assumed that\nthere is an explicit relationship between the trajectory and wave equations of\nthe electron, which are established on the basis of the local variational\nprinciple. In this approach, an electron wave propagating in free space takes\nalong the electron trajectory. We used this theory to describe the electron\nmotion in a hydrogen-like atom and found its stationary states. The energies of\nthese states coincide with the known quantum mechanics solutions for the\nstationary energies of the hydrogen-like atom, however, in our approach the\nspatial trajectories of the electron have the form of the surfaces, which are\nformed in the region of nodes of the standing electron wave. These surfaces\nhave the form of spheres for the spherical symmetrical electron states and the\nradii of these spheres coincide with the radii of the Bohr orbits of these\nstates. Thus, in this approach the trajectory and wave measurements of the\nelectron get a consistent spatial description that is inherent to the picture\nof the corpuscular-wave monism. We discuss the considerable correspondence of\nthe proposed theory with the quantum mechanics results describing the\nstationary and non-stationary motions of the electron in the atom and their\ndifference.

Quantum information allows for bit commitment schemes in the\ninformation theoretic setting where no dishonest party can perfectly cheat. The\npreviously best-known quantum protocol by Ambainis achieved a cheating\nprobability of at most 3/4[Amb01]. On the other hand, Kitaev showed that no\nquantum protocol can have cheating probability less than 1/sqrt{2} [Kit03] (his\nlower bound on coin flipping can be easily extended to bit commitment). Closing\nthis gap has since been an important and open question.\n  In this paper, we provide the optimal bound for quantum bit commitment. We\nfirst show a lower bound of approximately 0.739, improving Kitaev's lower\nbound. We then present an optimal quantum bit commitment protocol which has\ncheating probability arbitrarily close to 0.739. More precisely, we show how to\nuse any weak coin flipping protocol with cheating probability 1/2 + eps in\norder to achieve a quantum bit commitment protocol with cheating probability\n0.739 + O(eps). We then use the optimal quantum weak coin flipping protocol\ndescribed by Mochon[Moc07]. To stress the fact that our protocol uses quantum\neffects beyond the weak coin flip, we show that any classical bit commitment\nprotocol with access to perfect weak (or strong) coin flipping has cheating\nprobability at least 3/4.\n","Comment: v1 20pages"]}]

Applications\nto physical processes so far unsuited for a standard chiral perturbative\napproach are presented. Results for the extension of these ideas to the meson\nbaryon sector are discussed, together with applications to kaons in a nuclear\nmedium and $K^-$ atoms.\n","Comment: Contribution to the KEK Tanashi Symposium on Physics of Hadrons and\n  Nuclei, Tokyo, December 1998, 10 pages, 3 postscript figures.

We have developed a microscopic model for the pion production,\nand then implemented the two pion final state interaction by using the results\nof a non-perturbative unitary coupled-channels method based in the standard\nchiral Lagrangians. The resulting model, describes well the reaction on the\nnucleon for all different isospin channels.\n  Finally, we have considered the reaction in nuclei.
