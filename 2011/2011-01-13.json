The basic idea\nis to decompose the requested global specification into subtasks for each\nindividual agent. It should be noted that the decomposition is not arbitrary.\nThe global specification should be decomposed in such a way that the fulfilment\nof these subtasks by each individual agent will imply the satisfaction of the\nglobal specification as a team. First, it is shown by a counterexample that not\nall specifications can be decomposed in this sense. Then, a natural follow-up\nquestion is what the necessary and sufficient condition should be for the\nproposed decomposability of a global specification. The main part of the paper\nis set to answer this question. The case of two cooperative agents is\ninvestigated first, and a necessary and sufficient condition is presented and\nproven. Later on, the result is generalized to the case of arbitrary finite\nnumber of agents, and a hierarchical algorithm is proposed, which is shown to\nbe a sufficient condition.

Two forms of monitoring information are considered,\nviz., locally unique transaction identifiers, and arrival and departure\ntimestamps of transactions at each processing queue. The timestamps are assumed\navailable at all the queues but in the absence of identifiers, only enable\nimprecise tracking since parallel processing can result in out-of-order\ndepartures. On the other hand, identifiers enable precise tracking but are not\navailable without proper instrumentation. Given an instrumentation budget, only\na subset of queues can be selected for production of identifiers, while the\nremaining queues have to resort to imprecise tracking using timestamps. The\ngoal is then to optimally allocate the instrumentation budget to maximize the\noverall tracking accuracy. The challenge is that the optimal allocation\nstrategy depends on accuracies of timestamp-based tracking at different queues,\nwhich has complex dependencies on the arrival and service processes, and the\nqueueing discipline. We propose two simple heuristics for allocation by\npredicting the order of timestamp-based tracking accuracies of different\nqueues.

New hard X-ray images of\nEta Car were studied close to periastron, and compared to previous observations\nfar from periastron.\n  Results: The INTEGRAL component, when represented by a power law (with a\nphoton index of 1.8), would produce more emission in the Chandra band than\nobserved from any point source in the ISGRI error circle apart from Eta Car, as\nlong as the hydrogen column density to the ISGRI source is lower than 1E24\ncm^{-2}.

To this purpose, we adopt casting manipulation and\nvisual-based feedback control. Casting manipulation is a technique to deploy a\nrobotic end-effector far from the robot's base, by throwing the end-effector\nand controlling its ballistic flight using forces transmitted through a light\ntether connected to the end-effector itself. The tether cable can then be used\nto retrieve the end- effector to exert forces on the robot's environment.

For generalized complex manifolds that arise from complex (resp.,\nsymplectic) manifolds, all three classes specialize to complex (resp.,\nsymplectic) submanifolds. In general, however, all three classes are distinct.\nWe discuss some interesting features of our theory of submanifolds, and\nillustrate them with a few nontrivial examples.\n  We then support our ``symplectic/Lagrangian viewpoint'' on the submanifolds\nintroduced by Gualtieri and Hitchin by defining the ``generalized complex\ncategory'', modelled on the constructions of Guillemin-Sternberg and Weinstein.\nWe argue that our approach may be useful for the quantization of generalized\ncomplex manifolds.\n","Comment: 31 pages, Latex (preliminary version).
