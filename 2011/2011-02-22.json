The main properties of the resulting high-quality filaments\n(which corresponds to $\\simeq33%$ of the detected filaments) are, i) their\nlengths cover a wide range of values of up to $150 $h$^{-1}$Mpc, but are mostly\nconcentrated below 50h$^{-1}$Mpc; ii) their distribution of thickness peaks at\n$d=3.0$h$^{-1}$Mpc and increases slightly with the filament length; iii) their\nnodes are connected on average to $1.87\\pm0.18$ filaments for $\\simeq\n10^{14.1}M_{\\odot}$ nodes; this number increases with the node mass to $\\simeq\n2.49\\pm0.28$ filaments for $\\simeq 10^{14.9}M_{\\odot}$ nodes.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 13 figures, MNRAS Accepted"]}]

Functional MRI (fMRI) data, that provide an indirect measure of\ntask-related or spontaneous neuronal activity, are classically analyzed in a\nmass-univariate procedure yielding statistical parametric maps. This analysis\nframework disregards some important principles of brain organization:\npopulation coding, distributed and overlapping representations. Multivariate\npattern analysis, i.e., the prediction of behavioural variables from brain\nactivation patterns better captures this structure. To cope with the high\ndimensionality of the data, the learning method has to be regularized. However,\nthe spatial structure of the image is not taken into account in standard\nregularization methods, so that the extracted features are often hard to\ninterpret. More informative and interpretable results can be obtained with the\nl_1 norm of the image gradient, a.k.a. its Total Variation (TV), as\nregularization. We apply for the first time this method to fMRI data, and show\nthat TV regularization is well suited to the purpose of brain mapping while\nbeing a powerful tool for brain decoding. Moreover, this article presents the\nfirst use of TV regularization for classification.\n"]}]

To date, most methods used to\ncompute such communities stem from the field of disjoint community detection by\neither extending the concept of modularity to an overlapping context or by\nattempting to decompose the whole set of nodes into several possibly\noverlapping subsets. In this report we take an orthogonal approach by\nintroducing a metric, the cohesion, rooted in sociological considerations. The\ncohesion quantifies the community-ness of one given set of nodes, based on the\nnotions of triangles - triplets of connected nodes - and weak ties, instead of\nthe classical view using only edge density. A set of nodes has a high cohesion\nif it features a high density of triangles and intersects few triangles with\nthe rest of the network. As such, we introduce a numerical characterization of\ncommunities: sets of nodes featuring a high cohesion. We then present a new\napproach to the problem of overlapping communities by introducing the concept\nof ego-munities, which are subjective communities centered around a given node,\nspecifically inside its neighborhood. We build upon the cohesion to construct a\nheuristic algorithm which outputs a node's ego-munities by attempting to\nmaximize their cohesion. We illustrate the pertinence of our method with a\ndetailed description of one person's ego-munities among Facebook friends.

The\nimpulsively excited seismic waves formed a compact wavepacket traveling through\nthe solar interior and appeared on the surface as expanding wave ripples.

The flare impact on the solar surface was observed in the\nform of compact and rapid variations of the HMI observables (Doppler velocity,\nline-of-sight magnetic field and continuum intensity). These variations, caused\nby the impact of high-energy particles in the photosphere, formed a typical\ntwo-ribbon flare structure. The sunquake can be easily seen in the raw\nDopplergram differences without any special data processing. The source of this\nquake was located near the outer boundary of a very complicated complicated\nsunspot region, NOAA 1158, in a sunspot penumbra and at the penumbra boundary.\nThis caused an interesting plasma dynamics in the impact region.

They are conceptually\nelegant and use the only mechanism of spontaneous breaking of a gauge symmetry\nthat is known to occur in nature. The simplest model, minimal technicolor with\nextended technicolor interactions, is appealing because one can calculate by\nscaling up from QCD. But it is ruled out on many counts: inappropriately low\nquark and lepton masses (or excessive FCNC), bad electroweak data fits, light\nscalar and vector states, etc. However, nature may not choose the minimal model\nand then we are stuck: except possibly through lattice simulations, we are\nunable to compute and test the models. In the LHC era it therefore makes sense\nto abandon specific models (of strong EW breaking) and concentrate on generic\nfeatures that may indicate discovery. The Technicolor Straw Man is not a model\nbut a parametrized search strategy inspired by a remarkable generic feature of\nwalking technicolor, that technivector mesons are light, narrow and decay\nreadily into electroweak vector mesons and photons. While walking technicolor\nis popular among practitioners, alternatives exist and the Straw Man may not\nlead to their discovery.\n","Comment: Talk given at the XXIInd Rencontres de Blois, Loire, France, 16-20\n  July 2010"]}]
