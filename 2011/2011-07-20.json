The main\nidea of the resolution is that even though the linear shear is linearly stable,\nslow orbits (also called quasi-steady states) in arbitrarily small\nneighborhoods of the linear shear can be linearly unstable. The key is that in\ninfinite dimensions, smallness in one norm does not mean smallness in all\nnorms. Our study here focuses upon a sequence of 2D oscillatory shears which\nare the Couette linear shear plus small amplitude and high frequency sinusoidal\nshear perturbations. In the fluid velocity variable, the sequence approaches\nthe Couette linear shear (e.g. in $L^2$ norm of velocity), thus it can be\nviewed as Couette linear shear plus small noises; while in the fluid vorticity\nvariable, the sequence does not approaches the Couette linear shear (e.g. in\n$H^1$ norm of velocity). Unlike the Couette linear shear, the sequence of\noscillatory shears has inviscid linear instability; furthermore, with the\nsequence of oscillatory shears as potentials, the Orr-Sommerfeld operator has\nunstable eigenvalues when the Reynolds number is large enough, this should lead\nto transient nonlinear growth which manifests as transient turbulence as\nobserved in experiments.

We consider a distributed\nchannel state information (CSI) configuration where each TX has its own local\nestimate of the channel and no communication is possible between the TXs. Based\non the distributed CSI configuration, we introduce a concept of distributed\nMIMO precoding. We focus on the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime such\nthat the two TXs aim at designing a precoding matrix to cancel the\ninterference. Building on the study of the multiple antenna broadcast channel,\nwe obtain the following key results: We derive the multiplexing gain (MG) as a\nfunction of the scaling in the SNR of the number of bits quantizing at each TX\nthe channel to a given RX. Particularly, we show that the conventional Zero\nForcing precoder is not MG maximizing, and we provide a precoding scheme\noptimal in terms of MG. Beyond the established MG optimality, simulations show\nthat the proposed precoding schemes achieve better performances at intermediate\nSNR than known linear precoders.\n"]}]

We first show numerically that due to a nonlinear distortion,\ntraditional methods require high-order harmonic components to represent\nnonlinear processes, except for the Hilbert-based method. This will lead to an\nartificial energy flux from the low-frequency (large scale) to the\nhigh-frequency (small scale) part. Thus the power law, if it exists, is\ncontaminated. We then compare the Hilbert method with structure functions (SF),\ndetrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), and wavelet leader (WL) by analyzing\nfractional Brownian motion and synthesized multifractal time series. For the\nformer simulation, we find that all methods provide comparable results. For the\nlatter simulation, we perform simulations with an intermittent parameter {\\mu}\n= 0.15.

However, both DFA\nand WL overestimate the scaling exponents when q > 5. It seems that Hilbert and\nDFA methods provide better singularity spectra than SF and WL.

We study\nstructural parameterizations of OCT with respect to their polynomial\nkernelizability, i.e., whether instances can be efficiently reduced to a size\npolynomial in the chosen parameter. It is a major open problem in parameterized\ncomplexity whether Odd Cycle Transversal admits a polynomial kernel when\nparameterized by l.

To address these challenges, the Markov modulated Poisson process\n(MMPP) and multi-valued logic are introduced into WSNs to perform\ncontext-capture multi-valued decision fusion.

It is inherently\ncentralized. However, with the increasing number of processors, the cost for\nmanaging a single centralized list becomes too prohibitive. A suitable approach\nto reduce the contention is to distribute the list among the computational\nunits: each processor has only a local view of the work to execute. Thus, the\nscheduler is no longer greedy and standard performance guarantees are lost.\n  The objective of this work is to study the extra cost that must be paid when\nthe list is distributed among the computational units. We first present a\ngeneral methodology for computing the expected makespan based on the analysis\nof an adequate potential function which represents the load unbalance between\nthe local lists. We obtain an equation on the evolution of the potential by\ncomputing its expected decrease in one step of the schedule. Our main theorem\nshows how to solve such equations to bound the makespan. Then, we apply this\nmethod to several scheduling problems, namely, for unit independent tasks, for\nweighted independent tasks and for tasks with precendence constraints. More\nprecisely, we prove that the time for scheduling a global workload W composed\nof independent unit tasks on m processors is equal to W/m plus an additional\nterm proportional to log_2 W. We provide a lower bound which shows that this is\noptimal up to a constant. This result is extended to the case of weighted\nindependent tasks. In the last setting, precedence task graphs, our analysis\nleads to an improvement on the bound of Arora et al. We finally provide some\nexperiments using a simulator. The distribution of the makespan is shown to fit\nexisting probability laws. The additive term is shown by simulation to be\naround 3 \\log_2 W confirming the tightness of our analysis.\n"]}]
