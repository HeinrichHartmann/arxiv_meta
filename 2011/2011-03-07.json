From the general properties of this form of dynamics, the\nstate vector can be further decomposed in well-defined Fock components.

For k=1, we first prove, as\na side result, the equivalence of two known path representations for the\nfinitized su(2)_1 states by displaying an explicit bijection. An immediate\noffshoot is the gain of a new and simple weighting for the (Kyoto) path\nrepresentation that generalizes to level k.

These are formal operators that map a path to another path, so\nthat any path can be obtained by successive applications of these operators on\na simple reference (ground-state) path. The nonlocal operator description is\nthe starting point for a direct and elementary derivation of the su(2)_1 spinon\ncharacter. The second part presents an extensive study of the su(2)_2 paths\nfrom their particle point of view, where the particles are defined as the path\nbuilding blocks.

However, our detailed knowledge of nuclear\nforces and the mechanisms governing the structure of nuclei, in particular far\nfrom stability, is still incomplete. In nuclei with equal neutron and proton\nnumbers ($N = Z$), the unique nature of the atomic nucleus as an object\ncomposed of two distinct types of fermions can be expressed as enhanced\ncorrelations arising between neutrons and protons occupying orbitals with the\nsame quantum numbers. Such correlations have been predicted to favor a new type\nof nuclear superfluidity; isoscalar neutron-proton pairing, in addition to\nnormal isovector pairing (see Fig. 1). Despite many experimental efforts these\npredictions have not been confirmed. Here, we report on the first observation\nof excited states in $N = Z = 46$ nucleus $^{92}$Pd.

We suggest that this coupling scheme\nreplaces normal superfluidity (characterized by seniority coupling) in the\nground and low-lying excited states of the heaviest N = Z nuclei.

New\nmeasurement methods can measure concentrations for all molecular species in a\npathway, which creates a new opportunity to decompose the optimization of rate\nparameters. Results: In contrast with conventional methods that minimize the\ndisagreement between simulated and observed concentrations, the BPPE method\nfits a spline curve through the observed concentration points, and then matches\nthe derivatives of the spline-curve to the production and consumption of each\nspecies. Whereas traditional methods follow the ODEs exactly and then attempt\nto match the data, BPPE follows the data exactly and then attempts to match the\nODEs. The new objective function is an extreme decomposition of the problem\nbecause each factor in the function is enforcing the equality of one ODE at one\ntimeslice. A \"loopy belief propagation\" algorithm solves this factorized\napproximation of the parameter estimation problem providing systematic coverage\nof the search space and unique asymptotic behavior; the run time is polynomial\nin the number of molecules and timepoints, but exponential in the degree of the\nbiochemical network. The implementation is a global-local hybrid optimization,\nand we compare with the performance of local, global, and hybrid methods.
