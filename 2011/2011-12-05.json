Applying a limit of rare mutations to this population while keeping\nthe population size finite leads to a jump process, the so-called `trait\nsubstitution sequence', where evolution proceeds by successive invasions and\nfixations of mutant types. The probability of fixation of a mutant is\ninterpreted as a fitness landscape that depends on the current state of the\npopulation. It was in adaptive dynamics that this kind of model was first\ninvented and studied, under the additional assumption of large population.\nAssuming also small mutation steps, adaptive dynamics' theory provides a\ndeterministic ODE approximating the evolutionary dynamics of the dominant trait\nof the population, called `canonical equation of adaptive dynamics'. In this\nwork, we want to include genetic drift in this models by keeping the population\nfinite. Rescaling mutation steps (weak selection) yields in this case a\ndiffusion on the trait space that we call `canonical diffusion of adaptive\ndynamics', in which genetic drift (diffusive term) is combined with directional\nselection (deterministic term) driven by the fitness gradient. Finally, in\norder to compute the coefficients of this diffusion, we seek explicit\nfirst-order formulae for the probability of fixation of a nearly neutral mutant\nappearing in a resident population. These formulae are expressed in terms of\n`invasibility coefficients' associated with fertility, defense, aggressiveness\nand isolation, which measure the robustness (stability w.r.t. selective\nstrengths) of the resident type. Some numerical results on the canonical\ndiffusion are also given.\n"]}]

The notion of cancer progression as an evolutionary process has been\nexperiencing increasing interest in recent years. Many efforts have been made\nto better understand and predict the progression to cancer using mathematical\nmodels; these mostly consider the evolution of a well-mixed cell population,\neven though pre-cancerous cells often evolve in highly structured epithelial\ntissues. We propose a novel model of cancer progression that considers a\nspatially structured cell population where clones expand via adaptive waves.\nThis model is used to asses two different paradigms of asexual evolution that\nhave been suggested to delineate the process of cancer progression. The\nstandard scenario of periodic selection assumes that driver mutations are\naccumulated strictly sequentially over time. However, when the mutation supply\nis sufficiently high, clones may arise simultaneously on distinct genetic\nbackgrounds, and clonal adaptation waves interfere with each other. We find\nthat in the presence of clonal interference, spatial structure increases the\nwaiting time for cancer, leads to a patchwork structure of non-uniformly sized\nclones, decreases the survival probability of virtually neutral (passenger)\nmutations, and that genetic distance begins to increase over a characteristic\nlength scale, determined here. These characteristic features of clonal\ninterference may help to predict the onset of cancers with pronounced spatial\nstructure and to interpret spatially-sampled genetic data obtained from\nbiopsies. Our estimates suggest that clonal interference likely occurs in the\nprogressing colon cancer, and possibly other cancers where spatial structure\nmatters.\n","Comment: 21 pages"]}]

In the\ndelivery system, heparin binds to a peptide which has been covalently\ncross-linked to a fibrin matrix. Growth factor in turn binds to the heparin,\nand growth factor release is governed by both binding and diffusion mechanisms,\nthe purpose of the binding being to slow growth factor release. The governing\nmathematical model, which in its original formulation consists of five partial\ndifferential equations, is reduced to a system of just two equations. We\nidentify the governing non-dimensional parameters that can be varied to tune\nthe growth factor release rate. In particular, we identify a parameter regime\nthat ensures slow passive release (usually desirable) of at least a fraction of\nthe growth factor. It is found that slow release is assured if the matrix is\nprepared with the concentration of cross-linked peptide greatly exceeding the\ndissociation constant of heparin from the peptide, and with the concentration\nof heparin greatly exceeding the dissociation constant of the growth factor\nfrom heparin. Also, for the first time, in vitro experimental release data is\ndirectly compared with theoretical release profiles generated by the model.

In the hadronic phase, these transitions still take place in\nthe infinite volume at zero temperature limit despite of the explicit breaking\nof the centre symmetry by the matter fields. This finding is supported by\nsimulations of the SU(2) Yang-Mills theory with Higgs matter. The\nphenomenological impact of the centre sector transitions for dense but confined\nmatter is explained: centre dressed quarks acquire Bose statistics and form a\nso-called Fermi-Einstein condensate. This mechanism is further illustrated in\nthe Schwinger model where it solves the Silver-Blaze problem.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures, Talk presented at the International Workshop on\n  QCD Green's Functions, Confinement and Phenomenology, 5-9 September 2011,\n  Trento, Italy"]}]

We study evolution of modulated beams in linear\nbeamlines and find that characteristic spectral parameters transform linearly.\nThe developed approach significantly simplifies analysis of various schemes\nproposed for seeding X-ray free electron lasers.

Interestingly, an exact\nanalytical solution for the time evolution of the state of atom-field system\ncan be found in this general regime in terms of the nonlinearity functions.\nFinally, the presented formalism has been applied to a few known physical\nsystems such as Gilmore-Perelomov and Barut-Girardello coherent states of\nSU(1,1) group, as well as a few special cases of interest.
