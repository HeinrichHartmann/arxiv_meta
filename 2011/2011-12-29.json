Assuming a weighting of their momentum\ndistributions with the average momentum $\\tilde Q_i$ of each state, a running\nof the coupling $\\alpha(Q)$ is obtained, which is in quantitative agreement\nwith $\\alpha_s(Q)$ from QCD. Also with a similar weighting the gluon propagator\nfrom lattice QCD simulations is well described. This indicates clearly that QCD\nand thus the Standard Model is not a unique description of fundamental\ninteractions.\n  Different from the Standard Model, the quanton model is simple and yields\nbound states with correct masses. This may indicate that this model yields a\nmore realistic description of fundamental forces.\n"]}]
