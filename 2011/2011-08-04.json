One solution (the \"Einstein\"\nvacuum) has a well defined limit as the Gauss-Bonnet coupling goes to zero,\nwhereas the other solution (the \"stringy\" vacuum) does not. There has been some\ndebate regarding the stability of these vacua, most recently from Deser and\nTekin who have argued that the corresponding black hole solutions have positive\nmass and as such both vacua are stable. Whilst the statement about the mass is\ncorrect, we argue that the stringy vacuum is still perturbatively unstable.\nSimply put, the stringy vacuum suffers from a ghost-like instability that is\nnot excited by the spherically symmetric black hole, but would be excited by\nany source likely to emit gravitational waves, such as a binary system. This\nresult is reliable except in the strongly coupled regime close to the\nChern-Simons limit, when the two vacua are almost degenerate. In this regime,\nwe study instanton transitions between branches via bubble nucleation, and\ncalculate the nucleation probability. This demonstrates that there is large\nmixing between the vacua, so that neither of them can accurately describe the\ntrue quantum vacuum.

Such measures have been\nfound to lead to paradoxical behavior, and recently Bousso, Freivogel,\nLeichenauer, and Rosenhaus have argued that, under reasonable assumptions, the\nonly consistent interpretation for such measures is that time must end at the\ncutoff. Here we argue that there is an alternative, consistent formulation of\nsuch measures, in which time extends to infinity. Our formulation begins with a\nmathematical model of the infinite multiverse, which can be constructed without\nthe use of a measure. Probabilities, which obey all the standard requirements\nfor a probability measure, can then be defined by mathematical limits. They\nhave a peculiar feature, however, which we call time-delay bias: if the outcome\nof an experiment is reported with a time delay that depends on the outcome,\nthen the observation of the reports will be biased in favor of the shorter time\ndelay.

For many of these systems, the exact nature of the evolutionary\nchannels by which they form remains uncertain. The canonical explanation calls\nfor the progenitor binary system to undergo two subsequent mass-transfer\nevents, both of which are unstable and lead to a common envelope (CE) phase.\nHowever, it has been shown that if both CE events obey the standard alpha\nprescription, it is not possible to reproduce all of the observed systems. As\nan alternative prescription, the gamma-formalism was proposed, which\nparametrizes the fraction of angular momentum carried away with mass loss, in\ncontrast to the alpha prescription, which parametrizes energy loss. We\ndemonstrate that the gamma-prescription is also inadequate in describing the\nevolution of an arbitrary DWD binary; clearly we require a deeper understanding\nof the physical mechanisms underlying their formation. We then present a\ndetailed model for the evolution of Red Giant -- Main Sequence binaries during\nthe first episode of mass transfer, and demonstrate that their evolution into\nDWDs need not arise through two phases of dynamical mass loss. Instead, the\nfirst episode of dramatic mass loss may be stable, non-conservative mass\ntransfer. The second phase is then well described by the alpha prescription.
