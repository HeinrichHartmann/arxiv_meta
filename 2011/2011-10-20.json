This\ntemplate family, which reparametrizes all the spin-dependent PN terms in terms\nof the leading-order (1.5PN) spin-orbit coupling term \\emph{in an approximate\nway}, has very high overlaps (fitting factor > 0.99) with non-precessing\nbinaries with arbitrary mass ratios and spins. We also show that this template\nfamily is \"effectual\" for the detection of a significant fraction of generic\nspinning binaries in the comparable-mass regime (m_2/m_1 <~ 10), providing an\nattractive and feasible way of searching for gravitational waves (GWs) from\nspinning low-mass binaries. We also show that the secular (non-oscillatory)\nspin-dependent effects in the phase evolution (which are taken into account by\nthe non-precessing templates) are more important than the oscillatory effects\nof precession in the comparable-mass (m_1 ~= m_2) regime. Hence the\neffectualness of non-spinning templates is particularly poor in this case, as\ncompared to non-precessing-spin templates. For the case of binary neutron stars\nobservable by Advanced LIGO, even moderate spins (L .

Considering\nthe overall quality-of-service of the network, we first specify our definition\nof optimal RS for multiple-user relay networks. Then an optimal RS (ORS)\nalgorithm is provided, which is a straightforward extension of an RS scheme in\nthe literature that maximizes the minimum end-to-end receive signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) of all users. The complexity of the ORS is quadratic in both the\nnumber of users and the number of relays.

Furthermore, diversity orders of both the\nORS and the proposed SRS are theoretically derived and compared with those of a\nnaive RS scheme and the single-user RS network. It is shown that the ORS\nachieves full diversity; while the diversity order of the SRS decreases with\nthe the number of users. For two-user networks, the outage probabilities and\narray gains corresponding to the minimum SNR of the RS schemes are derived in\nclosed forms.

A\nsubcube of $\\{0,1\\}^d$ is a subset of $2^k$ of its points formed by fixing $k$\ncoordinates and allowing the remaining $d-k$ to vary freely. The subcube\nstructure of the discrete cube is surprisingly complicated and there are many\nopen questions relating to it.\n  This paper is concerned with patterns of intersections among subcubes of the\ndiscrete cube. Two sample questions along these lines are as follows: given a\nfamily of subcubes in which no $r+1$ of them have non-empty intersection, how\nmany pairwise intersections can we have? How many subcubes can we have if among\nthem there are no $k$ which have non-empty intersection and no $l$ which are\npairwise disjoint? These questions are naturally expressed as Tur\\'an and\nRamsey type questions in intersection graphs of subcubes where the intersection\ngraph of a family of sets has one vertex for each set in the family with two\nvertices being adjacent if the corresponding subsets intersect.\n  Tur\\'an and Ramsey type problems are at the heart of extremal combinatorics\nand so these problems are mathematically natural. However, a second motivation\nis a connection with some questions in social choice theory arising from a\nsimple model of agreement in a society. Specifically, if we have to make a\nbinary choice on each of $n$ separate issues then it is reasonable to assume\nthat the set of choices which are acceptable to an individual will be\nrepresented by a subcube. Consequently, the pattern of intersections within a\nfamily of subcubes will have implications for the level of agreement within a\nsociety.\n  We pose a number of questions and conjectures relating directly to the\nTur\\'an and Ramsey problems as well as raising some further directions for\nstudy of subcube intersection graphs.\n","Comment: 18 pages"]}]
