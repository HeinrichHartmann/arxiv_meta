The former\neffect increases the survival probability of the dipoles, since color filtering\nin one nucleus makes the other one more transparent. The second effect acts in\nthe opposite direction and is stronger, it makes the colliding nuclei more\nopaque than in the case of pA collisions. As a result of parton saturation in\nnuclei the effective scale is shifted upwards, what leads to an increase of the\ngluon density at small x. This in turn leads to a stronger transverse momentum\nbroadening in AA compared with pA collisions, i.e. to an additional growth of\nthe saturation momentum. Such a mutual boosting leads to a system of\nreciprocity equations, which result in a saturation scale, a few times higher\nin AA than in pA collisions at the energies of LHC. Since the dipole cross\nsection is proportional to the saturation momentum squared, the nuclei become\nmuch more opaque for dipoles in AA than in pA collisions.

This\npaper is the first in a series that will carry out a detailed study of\nintermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) for ET. In the context of ET, an IMRI\nis the inspiral of a neutron star or stellar-mass black hole into an\nintermediate mass black hole (IMBH). In this paper we focus on the development\nof IMRI waveform models for circular and equatorial inspirals. We consider two\napproximations for the waveforms, which both incorporate the inspiral, merger\nand ringdown phases in a consistent way. One approximation, valid for IMBHs of\narbitrary spin, uses the transition model of Ori and Thorne [1] to describe the\nmerger, and this is then matched smoothly onto a ringdown waveform. The second\napproximation uses the Effective One Body (EOB) approach to model the merger\nphase of the waveform and is valid for non-spinning IMBHs. In this paper, we\nuse both waveform models to compute signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for IMRI\nsources detectable by ET. At a redshift of z=1, we find typical SNRs for IMRI\nsystems with masses 1.4+100 solar masses, 10+100 solar masses, 1.4+500 solar\nmasses and 10+500 solar masses of about 10-25, 40-80, 3-15 and 10-60,\nrespectively.

This process has some unusual properties. We work with the heat\nequation with a random potential: u_t=Delta u+kuF. Here k>0 is a small number,\nand x lies in d-dimensional Euclidean space with d>2. F is a Gaussian noise\nwhich is uncorrelated in time, and whose spatial covariance equals |x-y|^(-2).\nThe exponent 2 is critical in the following sense. For exponents less than 2,\nthe equation has function-valued solutions, and for exponents higher than 2, we\ndo not expect solutions to exist. This model is closely related to the\nparabolic Anderson model; we expect solutions to be small, except for a\ncollection of high peaks. This phenomenon is called intermittency, and is\nreflected in the singular nature of our process. Solutions exist as singular\nmeasures, under suitable assumptions on the initial conditions and for\nsufficiently small k. We investigate various properties of the solutions, such\nas dimension of the support and long-time behavior. As opposed to the\nsuper-Brownian motion, which satisfies a similar equation, our process does not\nhave compact support, nor does it die out in finite time.
