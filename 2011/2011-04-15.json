We test a self-organizing method in our model, showing\nthat it is close to theoretical optima and superior to a traditional method of\ntraffic light coordination.\n  Abstract: The elementary cellular automaton following rule 184 can mimic\nparticles flowing in one direction at a constant speed. This automaton can\ntherefore model highway traffic. In a recent paper, we have incorporated\nintersections regulated by traffic lights to this model using exclusively\nelementary cellular automata.

This extension shows first that our model can readily\nincorporate multiple-way intersections and hence simulate complex scenarios. In\naddition, the current extension allows us to study and evaluate the behavior of\ntwo different kinds of traffic light controller for a grid of six-way streets\nallowing for either two or three street intersections: a traffic light that\ntries to adapt to the amount of traffic (which results in self-organizing\ntraffic lights) and a system of synchronized traffic lights with coordinated\nrigid periods (sometimes called the \"green wave\" method). We observe a tradeoff\nbetween system capacity and topological complexity. The green wave method is\nunable to cope with the complexity of a higher-capacity scenario, while the\nself-organizing method is scalable, adapting to the complexity of a scenario\nand exploiting its maximum capacity. Additionally, in this paper we propose a\nbenchmark, independent of methods and models, to measure the performance of a\ntraffic light controller comparing it against a theoretical optimum.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 12 figures"]}]

After briefly sketching the history of multicanonical calculations\nand their range of application, a general introduction in the context of the\nstatistical physics of the d-dimensional generalized Potts models is given.\nMulticanonical simulations yield canonical expectation values for a range of\ntemperatures or any other parameter(s) for which appropriate weights can be\nconstructed. We shall address in some details the question how the\nmulticanonical weights are actually obtained. Subsequently miscellaneous topics\nrelated to the considered algorithms are reviewed. Then multicanonical studies\nof first order phase transitions are discussed and finally applications to\ncomplex systems such as spin glasses and proteins.\n","Comment: Review, 24 pages"]}]

The dynamics is modeled with a gauged linear sigma model. A novel\nquantum kinetic approach to the description of photoproduction far off\nequilibrium is developed.

The spectrum of photons produced throughout the\nphase transition is a non- equilibrium one. For thermal initial conditions at\nthe time of the quench it interpolates between a thermal distribution about 6%\nabove the initial temperature (at the time of the quench) for low energy $\\leq\n80$ MeV photons, and a high energy tail in thermal equilibrium at the initial\ntemperature, with a smooth crossover at 100 MeV.

In addition to the traditional mechanisms, like the\nneutrino mass, the admixture of right handed currents etc, it may occur due to\nthe R-parity violating supersymmetric (SUSY) interactions. From the nuclear\nphysics point of view it is challenging, because: 1) The relevant nuclei have\ncomplicated nuclear structure. 2) The energetically allowed transitions are\nexhaust a small part of all the strength. 3) One must cope with the short\ndistance behavior of the transition operators, especially when the intermediate\nparticles are heavy (eg in SUSY models).

The amplitudes of the interference maxima are\nchanged by a factor which depends upon a double line integral of the photon\ntwo-point function around the closed path of the electrons. The interference\npattern is sensitive to shifts in the vacuum fluctuations in regions from which\nthe electrons are excluded. Thus this effect combines aspects of both the\nCasimir and the Aharonov-Bohm effects. The coupling to the quantized\nelectromagnetic field tends to decrease the amplitude of the interference\noscillations, and hence is a form of decoherence. The contributions due to\nphoton emission and to vacuum fluctuations may be separately identified. It is\nto be expected that photon emission leads to decoherence, as it can reveal\nwhich path an electron takes. It is less obvious that vacuum fluctuations also\ncan cause decoherence. What is directly observable is a shift in the\nfluctuations due, for example, to the presence of a conducting plate. In the\ncase of electrons moving parallel to conducting boundaries, the dominant\ndecohering influence is that of the vacuum fluctuations.

We quantize the theory in covariant gauges, and construct a class of\nunitary transformations that enable us to embed the theory in a Fock space of\nstates that implement Gauss's law. We show that when electron (and positron)\ncreation and annihilation operators represent gauge-invariant charged particles\nthat are surrounded by the electric and magnetic fields required by Gauss's\nlaw, the unitarity of the theory is manifest, and charged particles interact\nwith photons and with each other through nonlocal potentials. These potentials\ninclude a Hopf-like interaction, and a planar analog of the Coulomb\ninteraction. The gauge-invariant charged particle excitations that implement\nGauss's law obey the identical anticommutation rules as do the original\ngauge-dependent ones. Rotational phases, commonly identified as planar `spin',\nare arbitrary, however.\n","Comment: 11 pages, RevTex; Contribution to Proceedings of \"Workshop on\n  Low-Dimensional Field Theory\", Telluride, CO, (August 1996)"]}]

An implied claim of computability logic is that it is CL5\nrather than affine logic that adequately materializes the resource philosophy\ntraditionally associated with the latter.

We\ndemonstrate that fast wave function oscillations can affect the performance of\nShor's quantum algorithm by destroying required quantum interference. We also\nshow that this destructive effect can be routinely avoided by using\nresonant-pulse techniques. We discuss the dynamics of resonant pulse\nimplementations of quantum logic gates in Ising spin systems. We also discuss\nthe influence of non-resonant excitations. We calculate the range of parameters\nwhere undesirable non-resonant effects can be minimized. Finally, we describe\nthe ``$2\\pi k$-method'' which avoids the detrimental deflection of non-resonant\nqubits.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 1 column, no figures"]}]
