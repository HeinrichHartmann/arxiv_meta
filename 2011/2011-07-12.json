Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out\nthat cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and\nX-ray data also depend on the helium abundance. This dependence can be used to\nmeasure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors). This shows that\ninteresting accuracy is within reach. We also briefly discuss how the SZ and\nX-ray cluster data can be combined to resolve the helium abundance dependence\nfor the d_a(z) cosmological test.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures; arXiv e-print only.

Performing an additive decomposition of the stress tensor based on\na harmonic approximation of the angular dependence of branch vectors, contact\nnormals and forces, we show that the increasing mobilization of friction force\nand the associated anisotropy are key effects of particle elongation. These\neffects are correlated with partial nematic ordering of the particles which\ntend to be oriented perpendicular to the major principal stress direction and\nform side-to-side contacts. However, the force transmission is found to be\nmainly guided by cap-to-side contacts, which represent the largest fraction of\ncontacts for the most elongated particles. Another interesting finding is that,\nin contrast to shear strength, the solid fraction first increases with particle\nelongation, but declines as the particles become more elongated.

A coordination mechanism aims to mitigate the impact of\nselfishness of jobs on the efficiency of schedules by defining a local\nscheduling policy on each machine. The scheduling policies induce a game among\nthe jobs and each job prefers to be scheduled on a machine so that its\ncompletion time is minimum given the assignments of the other jobs. We consider\nthe maximum completion time among all jobs as the measure of the efficiency of\nschedules. The approximation ratio of a coordination mechanism quantifies the\nefficiency of pure Nash equilibria (price of anarchy) of the induced game.\n  Our mechanisms are deterministic, local, and preemptive. Our first\ncoordination mechanism has approximation ratio $\\Theta(\\log m)$ and guarantees\nthat the induced game has pure Nash equilibria. This result improves a bound of\n$O(\\log^2 m)$ due to Azar, Jain, and Mirrokni and uses a global ordering of the\njobs according to their distinct IDs. Our second mechanism handles anonymous\njobs and has approximation ratio $O(\\frac{\\log m}{\\log \\log m})$ although the\ngame induced is not a potential game and, hence, the existence of pure Nash\nequilibria is not guaranteed by potential function arguments. However, it\nprovides evidence that the known lower bounds for non-preemptive coordination\nmechanisms could be beaten using preemptive scheduling policies. Our third\ncoordination mechanism also handles anonymous jobs and has a nice\ncost-revealing potential function. We use this potential function in order to\nprove the existence of equilibria and to upper-bound the price of anarchy of\nthe induced game by $O(\\log^2m)$. Our third coordination mechanism is the first\nthat handles anonymous jobs and simultaneously guarantees that the induced game\nis a potential game and has bounded price of anarchy.\n","Comment: 26 pages, preliminary version appeared in Proceedings of the 20th\n  Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA), pp. 815-824, 2009"]}]

Using the non-equilibrium Green function formalism (NEGF)\nanalysis of a small model QPC2, three ingredients were found to be essential to\ngenerate the strong spin polarization: an asymmetric lateral confinement, a\nLSOC induced by the lateral confining potential of the QPC, and a strong\nelectron-electron (e-e) interaction. In this paper, NEGF is used to study how\nthe spin polarization is affected by the presence of impurities in the central\nportion of the QPC. It is found that the number, location, and shape of the\nconductance anomalies, occurring below the first quantized conductance plateau\n(G0=2e2/h), are strongly dependent on the nature (attractive or repulsive) and\nthe locations of the impurities. We show that the maximum of the conductance\nspin polarization is affected by the presence of impurities. For QPCs with\nimpurities off-center, a conductance anomaly appears below the first integer\nstep even for the case of symmetric bias on the two side gates. These results\nare of practical importance if QPCs in series are to be used to fabricate\nall-electrical spin valves with large ON/OFF conductance ratio.\n"]}]

We utilize perturbation-response scanning (PRS) technique, coupled with\nmolecular dynamics simulations to analyze conformational preferences of\ncalcium-loaded CaM, initially in extended form. PRS is comprised of sequential\napplication of directed forces on residues followed by recording the resulting\ncoordinates. We show that manipulation of a single residue, E31 located in one\nof the EF hand motifs, reproduces structural changes to compact forms, and the\nflexible linker acts as a transducer of binding information to distant parts of\nthe protein. Independently, using four different pKa calculation strategies, we\nfind E31 to be the charged residue (out of 52), whose ionization state is most\nsensitive to subtle pH variations in the physiological range. It is proposed\nthat at relatively low pH, CaM structure is less flexible. By gaining charged\nstates at specific sites at a pH value around 7, local conformational changes\nin the protein will lead to shifts in the energy landscape, paving the way to\nother conformational states. These findings are in accordance with FRET\nmeasured shifts in conformational distributions towards more compact forms with\ndecreased pH. They also corroborate mutational studies and proteolysis results\nwhich point to the significant role of E31 in CaM dynamics.\n","Comment: 47 pages, 4 figures"]}]
