There has been a flurry of recent research studying Nash\nbargaining solutions (also called 'balanced outcomes') in bargaining networks,\nso that we now know when such solutions exist, and also that they can be\ncomputed efficiently, even by market agents behaving in a natural manner. In\nthis work we study a generalization of Nash bargaining, that models the\npossibility of unequal 'bargaining powers'. This generalization was introduced\nin [KB+10], where it was shown that the corresponding 'unequal division' (UD)\nsolutions exist if and only if Nash bargaining solutions exist, and also that a\ncertain local dynamics converges to UD solutions when they exist. However, the\nbound on convergence time obtained for that dynamics was exponential in network\nsize for the unequal division case. This bound is tight, in the sense that\nthere exists instances on which the dynamics of [KB+10] converges only after\nexponential time. Other approaches, such as the one of Kleinberg and Tardos, do\nnot generalize to the unsymmetrical case. Thus, the question of computational\ntractability of UD solutions has remained open. In this paper, we provide an\nFPTAS for the computation of UD solutions, when such solutions exist. On a\ngraph G=(V,E) with weights (i.e. pairwise profit opportunities) uniformly\nbounded above by 1, our FPTAS finds an \\eps-UD solution in time\npoly(|V|,1/\\eps).

Using a theory for\nnucleic acid secondary structures that accounts for the logarithmic entropy c\nln m for a loop of length m, we study homopolymeric single-stranded nucleic\nacid chains under external force and varying temperature. In the thermodynamic\nlimit of a long strand, the chain displays a phase transition between a low\ntemperature / low force compact (folded) structure and a high temperature /\nhigh force molten (unfolded) structure. The influence of c on phase diagrams,\ncritical exponents, melting, and force extension curves is derived\nanalytically. For vanishing pulling force, only for the limited range of loop\nexponents 2 < c < 2.479 a melting transition is possible; for c <= 2 the chain\nis always in the folded phase and for 2.479 < c always in the unfolded phase. A\nforce induced melting transition with singular behavior is possible for all\nloop exponents c < 2.479 and can be observed experimentally by single molecule\nforce spectroscopy.

This leads to a lower melting temperature of the duplex than predicted\nby the Poland-Scheraga model.

This method works reasonably well when the order of spherical\nharmonics is limited to be small relative to the resolution of the magnetogram,\nalthough some artifacts, such as ringing, can arise around sharp features. When\nthe number of spherical harmonics is increased, however, using the raw\nmagnetogram data given on a grid that is uniform in the sine of the latitude\ncoordinate can result in inaccurate and unreliable results, especially in the\npolar regions close to the Sun.\n  We discuss here two approaches that can mitigate or completely avoid these\nproblems: i) Remeshing the magnetogram onto a grid with uniform resolution in\nlatitude, and limiting the highest order of the spherical harmonics to the\nanti-alias limit; ii) Using an iterative finite difference algorithm to solve\nfor the potential field.
