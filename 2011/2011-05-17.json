The work has two aims: one is to develop a t-QCT itself based\non physically natural concept of time, and the other is to pursue the\npossibility of using t-QCT as a tool to estimate the complexity in conventional\ngate-optimal quantum computation theory (g-QCT). In particular, we investigate\nto what extent is true the statement: time complexity is polynomial in the\nnumber of qubits if and only if so is gate complexity. In the analysis, we\nrelate t-QCT and optimal control theory (OCT) through fidelity-optimal\ncomputation theory (f-QCT); f-QCT is equivalent to t-QCT in the limit of unit\noptimal fidelity, while it is formally similar to OCT. We then develop an\nefficient numerical scheme for f-QCT by modifying Krotov's method in OCT, which\nhas monotonic convergence property. We implemented the scheme and obtained\nsolutions of f-QCT and of t-QCT for the quantum Fourier transform and a unitary\noperator that does not have an apparent symmetry. The former has a polynomial\ngate complexity and the latter is expected to have exponential one because a\nseries of generic unitary operators has a exponential gate complexity. The time\ncomplexity for the former is found to be linear in the number of qubits, which\nis understood naturally by the existence of an upper bound. The time complexity\nfor the latter is exponential. Thus the both targets are examples satisfyng the\nstatement above.

In this paper, we use complex, near-identical kernels from\na Quantum Monte Carlo application to compare the performance of CUDA and\nOpenCL. We show that when using NVIDIA compiler tools, converting a CUDA kernel\nto an OpenCL kernel involves minimal modifications. Making such a kernel\ncompile with ATI's build tools involves more modifications.

Two dimensions on which similarity\nbetween scientists can be assessed are their research specialties and status\npositions. Second, focus constraint shapes collaboration when connections among\nscientists depend on opportunities for social contact. Constraint comes in two\nforms, depending on whether it originates in institutional or geographic space.\nInstitutional constraint refers to the tendency of scientists to select\ncollaborators within rather than across institutional boundaries. Geographic\nconstraint is the principle that, when collaborations span different\ninstitutions, they are more likely to involve scientists that are\ngeographically co-located than dispersed. To study homophily and focus\nconstraint, the paper will argue in favour of an idea of collaboration that\nmoves beyond formal co-authorship to include also other forms of informal\nintellectual exchange that do not translate into the publication of joint work.\nA community-detection algorithm is applied to the co-authorship network of the\nscientists that submitted in Business and Management in the 2001 UK RAE.

This network\ncontains all known interactions and functional modules (i.e. groups of\nproteins) coordinately responding to HCMV entry. The number of both genes and\nfunctional modules activated in this network dramatically declines shortly,\nwithin 25 min post-infection. While modules annotated as receptor system, ion\ntransport, and immune response are continuously activated during the entire\nprocess of HCMV entry, those for cell adhesion and skeletal movement are\nspecifically activated during viral early attachment, and those for immune\nresponse during virus entry. HCMV entry requires a complex receptor network\ninvolving different cellular components, comprising not only cell surface\nreceptors, but also pathway components in signal transduction, skeletal\ndevelopment, immune response, endocytosis, ion transport, macromolecule\nmetabolism and chromatin remodeling. Interestingly, genes that function in\nchromatin remodeling are the most abundant in this receptor system, suggesting\nthat global modulation of transcriptions is one of the most important events in\nHCMV entry.

Kol (IEEE INFOCOM, 1998). In the present work, a generalization of\nindex coding scheme, where transmitted symbols are subject to errors, is\nstudied. Error-correcting methods for such a scheme, and their parameters, are\ninvestigated. In particular, the following question is discussed: given the\nside information hypergraph of index coding scheme and the maximal number of\nerroneous symbols $\\delta$, what is the shortest length of a linear index code,\nsuch that every receiver is able to recover the required information? This\nquestion turns out to be a generalization of the problem of finding a\nshortest-length error-correcting code with a prescribed error-correcting\ncapability in the classical coding theory.\n  The Singleton bound and two other bounds, referred to as the $\\alpha$-bound\nand the $\\kappa$-bound, for the optimal length of a linear error-correcting\nindex code (ECIC) are established. For large alphabets, a construction based on\nconcatenation of an optimal index code with an MDS classical code, is shown to\nattain the Singleton bound. For smaller alphabets, however, this construction\nmay not be optimal. A random construction is also analyzed. It yields another\nimplicit bound on the length of an optimal linear ECIC.\n  Further, the problem of error-correcting decoding by a linear ECIC is\nstudied. It is shown that in order to decode correctly the desired symbol, the\ndecoder is required to find one of the vectors, belonging to an affine space\ncontaining the actual error vector. The syndrome decoding is shown to produce\nthe correct output if the weight of the error pattern is less or equal to the\nerror-correcting capability of the corresponding ECIC.\n  Finally, the notion of static ECIC, which is suitable for use with a family\nof instances of an index coding problem, is introduced.\n","Comment: 14 pages"]}]

The b-Si\nconsisting of high density and high aspect ratio sub-micron length whiskers or\npillars with tip diameters of well under 3 nm exhibits strong photoluminescence\n(PL) both in visible and infrared, which are interpreted in conjunction with\ndefects, confinement effects and near band-edge emission. Structural analysis\nindicate that the whiskers are all crystalline and encapsulated by a thin Si\noxide layer. Infrared vibrational spectrum of Si-O-Si bondings in terms of\ntransverse-optic (TO) and longitudinal-optic (LO) phonons indicates that\ndisorder induced LO-TO optical mode coupling can be an effective tool in\nassessing structural quality of the b-Si. The same phonons are likely coupled\nto electrons in visible region PL transitions. Field emission properties of\nthese nanoscopic features are demonstrated indicating the influence of the tip\nshape on the emission.
