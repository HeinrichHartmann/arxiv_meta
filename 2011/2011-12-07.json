Our numerical\nsimulations show that in both Hamiltonian and dissipative systems HLMs formerly\ndetected via OLVs survive if CLVs are used instead. Moreover the previous\nclassification of two universality classes works for CLVs as well, i.e. the\ndispersion relation is linear for Hamiltonian systems and quadratic for\ndissipative systems respectively. The significance of HLMs changes in different\nways for Hamiltonian and dissipative systems with the replacement of OLVs by\nCLVs. For general dissipative systems with nonhyperbolic dynamics the long wave\nlength structure in Lyapunov vectors corresponding to near-zero Lyapunov\nexponents is strongly reduced if CLVs are used instead, whereas for highly\nhyperbolic dissipative systems the significance of HLMs is nearly identical for\nCLVs and OLVs. In contrast the HLM significance of Hamiltonian systems is\nalways comparable for CLVs and OLVs irrespective of hyperbolicity.

Although optimized to detect upgoing\nneutrino-induced muons, neutrino telescopes nevertheless have a potential to\ndetect high-energy photons by detecting downgoing muons from the\nelectromagnetic cascade induced by the interaction of TeV photons with the\nEarth's atmosphere. The photon energy spectrum of a GRB is modeled by a simple\npower law and is normalized by simple energy considerations. Taking into\naccount the absorption of TeV photons by cosmic infrared backgrounds, an\noptical depth table calculated from a model by \\cite{fin10} is used and the\narriving number of photons on top of the Earth atmosphere is determined. Muon\nproduction in the atmosphere is determined by considering two main channels of\nmuon production: Pion photoproduction and direct muon pair production. The muon\nenergy loss during their traverse from the surface to the bottom of the sea is\ndetermined using the standard muon energy loss formula. Assuming different\ndetector sizes, the number of detectable muons from single GRB events located\nat different redshifts and zenith distances is determined. The background is\ncalculated assuming it consists primarily of cosmic ray-induced downgoing\nmuons. The detection significance is calculated and it can be concluded that to\nobtain at least $3\\sigma$ detection significance, a typical GRB has to be\nlocated at redshift $z \\lesssim 0.07$ if the detector's muon effective area is\n$A^{\\mu}_{\\rm eff} \\sim 10^{-2}\\;{\\rm km}^{2}$, or redshift $z \\lesssim 0.15$,\nif the muon effective area is $A^{\\mu}_{\\rm eff} \\sim 1\\;{\\rm km}^{2}$.\n","Comment: Thirteen pages, 14 figures.

It consists of three drag-free spacecraft in the most\nstable geocentric formation, the Earth-Moon L3, L4, and L5 Lagrange points.\nFixed antennas allow continuous contact with the Earth, solving the problem of\ncommunications bandwidth and latency. A 70 mm diameter AuPt sphere with a 35 mm\ngap to its enclosure serves as a single inertial reference per spacecraft,\nwhich is operated in \"true\" drag-free mode (no test mass forcing). This is the\ncore of the Modular Gravitational Reference Sensor whose other advantages are:\na simple caging design based on the DISCOS 1972 drag-free mission, an all\noptical read-out with pm fine and nm coarse sensors, and the extensive\ntechnology heritage from the Honeywell gyroscopes, and the DISCOS and Gravity\nProbe B drag-free sensors. An Interferometric Measurement System, designed with\nreflective optics and a highly stabilized frequency standard, performs the\ninter-test mass ranging and requires a single optical bench with one laser per\nspacecraft. Two 20 cm diameter telescopes per spacecraft, each with in-field\npointing, incorporate novel technology developed for advanced optical systems\nby Lockheed Martin, who also designed the spacecraft based on a multi-flight\nproven bus structure. Additional technological advancements include the\ndrag-free propulsion, thermal control, charge management systems, and\nmaterials. LAGRANGE sub-systems are designed to be scalable and modular, making\nthem interchangeable with those of LISA or other gravitational science\nmissions.

The cost of effectively and accurately computing\npairwise network distances can become prohibitive in large-scale networks such\nas the Internet and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks. To negotiate the rising need\nfor very efficient distance computation, approximation techniques for numerous\nvariants of this question have recently received significant attention in the\nliterature. The goal is to preprocess the graph and store a small amount of\ninformation such that whenever a query for any pairwise distance is issued, the\ndistance can be well approximated (i.e., with small stretch) very quickly in an\nonline fashion. Specifically, the pre-processing (usually) involves storing a\nsmall sketch with each node, such that at query time only the sketches of the\nconcerned nodes need to be looked up to compute the approximate distance. In\nthis paper, we present the first theoretical study of distance sketches derived\nfrom distance oracles in a distributed network. We first present a fast\ndistributed algorithm for computing approximate distance sketches, based on a\ndistributed implementation of the distance oracle scheme of [Thorup-Zwick, JACM\n2005]. We also show how to modify this basic construction to achieve different\ntradeoffs between the number of pairs for which the distance estimate is\naccurate and other parameters. These tradeoffs can then be combined to give an\nefficient construction of small sketches with provable average-case as well as\nworst-case performance.
