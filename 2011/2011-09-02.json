It was suggested that the effect may be\nput to practical use in a future spin transistor design. In the present article\nwe revisit the problem and present a detailed analysis of the underlying\nphysics. First, we explore how the build-up of charge density wave correlations\nin the quantum wire due to the periodic gate configuration that produces the\nRashba modulation influences the transition to the insulating state. The\ninterplay between the modulations of the charge density and that of the\nspin-orbit coupling turns out to be quite subtle: Depending on the relative\nphase between the two modulations, the joint action of the Rashba interaction\nand charge density wave correlations may either enhance or reduce the Rashba\ncurrent blockade effect. Secondly, we inquire about the role of the Dresselhaus\nspin-orbit coupling that is generically present in a quantum wire embedded in\nsemiconductor heterostructure. While the Dresselhaus coupling is found to work\nagainst the current blockade of the insulating state, the effect is small in\nmost materials. Using an effective field theory approach, we also carry out an\nanalysis of effects from electron- electron interactions, and show how the\nsingle-particle gap in the insulating state can be extracted from the more\neasily accessible collective charge and spin excitation thresholds. The\nsmallness of the single-particle gap together with the anti-phase relation\nbetween the Rashba and chemical potential modulations pose serious difficulties\nfor realizing a Rashba-controlled current switch in an InAs-based device.

These equations are, generally speaking, nonlinear, and very hard to\nsolve. One way to address the problem is to obtain conservation laws of lower\norder than those of the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations. While in\nPhysics and Economics the question of existence of conservation laws is treated\nin a rather natural way, because the application itself suggest the\nconservation laws (e.g., conservation of energy, income/health law), from a\nstrictly mathematical point of view, given a problem of the calculus of\nvariations, it is not obvious how one might derive a conservation law or, for\nthat matter, if it even has a conservation law. The question we address is thus\nto develop computational facilities, based on a systematic method, which\npermits to identify functionals that have conservation laws. The central result\nwe use is the celebrated Noether's theorem. This theorem links conservation\nlaws with the invariance properties of the problem (with symmetries), and\nprovides an algorithm for finding conservation laws. Thus the problem is\nreduced to the one of finding the variational symmetries. We show how a\nComputer Algebra System can help to find the symmetries and the conservation\nlaws in the calculus of variations. Several illustrative examples are given.\n","Comment: 20 pages, in Portuguese.
