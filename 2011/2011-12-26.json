We use mutual\ninformation to quantify the information leaked about a user's biometric\nidentity, in the scenario where one or multiple biometric enrollments of the\nuser are fully or partially compromised. We also quantify the probability of\nsuccessful attack ($P_{SA}$) based on the compromised information. Our analysis\nreveals that fuzzy commitment and secure sketch systems have identical $P_{FR},\nP_{FA}, P_{SA}$ and information leakage, but secure sketch systems have lower\nstorage requirements. We analyze both single-factor (keyless) and two-factor\n(key-based) variants of secure biometrics, and consider the most general\nscenarios in which a single user may provide noisy biometric enrollments at\nseveral access control devices, some of which may be subsequently compromised\nby an attacker. Our analysis highlights the revocability and reusability\nproperties of key-based systems and exposes a subtle design tradeoff between\nreducing information leakage from compromised systems and preventing successful\nattacks on systems whose data have not been compromised.\n","Comment: 15 pages"]}]
