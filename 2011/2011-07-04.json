In this paper we examine an alternate class of deflection\nmodels where the non-supersymmetric threshold is accompanied by a heavy,\ninstead of light, singlet. The low energy form of this model is the so-called\nextended anomaly mediation proposed by Nelson and Weiner, but with potential\nfor a much higher deflection threshold. The existence of this high deflection\nthreshold implies that the space of anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking\ndeflecting models is larger than previously thought.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 1 figure (version to appear in JHEP)"]}]

We compute its beta function\nand discuss possible implications. The sign of the beta function depends on\nwhether the Immirzi parameter is larger or smaller than one in absolute value,\nand the values plus or minus one are UV fixed-points (we work in Euclidean\nsignature).

As a result, it is harder to guarantee their\ncorrect behavior. One of the most successful methods for automated verification\nof finite-state systems is model checking. Most of the current model-checking\nsystems use binary decision diagrams (BDDs) for the representation of the\ntested model and in the verification process of its properties. Generally, BDDs\nallow a canonical compact representation of a boolean function (given an order\nof its variables). The more compact the BDD is, the better performance one gets\nfrom the verifier. However, finding an optimal order for a BDD is an\nNP-complete problem. Therefore, several heuristic methods based on expert\nknowledge have been developed for variable ordering. We propose an alternative\napproach in which the variable ordering algorithm gains 'ordering experience'\nfrom training models and uses the learned knowledge for finding good orders.\nOur methodology is based on offline learning of pair precedence classifiers\nfrom training models, that is, learning which variable pair permutation is more\nlikely to lead to a good order. For each training model, a number of training\nsequences are evaluated. Every training model variable pair permutation is then\ntagged based on its performance on the evaluated orders. The tagged\npermutations are then passed through a feature extractor and are given as\nexamples to a classifier creation algorithm. Given a model for which an order\nis requested, the ordering algorithm consults each precedence classifier and\nconstructs a pair precedence table which is used to create the order. Our\nalgorithm was integrated with SMV, which is one of the most widely used\nverification systems. Preliminary empirical evaluation of our methodology,\nusing real benchmark models, shows performance that is better than random\nordering and is competitive with existing algorithms that use expert knowledge.\nWe believe that in sub-domains of models (alu, caches, etc.) our system will\nprove even more valuable.

In the last\nevent the description language was extended from pure propositional planning to\ninclude numerical state variables, action durations, and plan quality objective\nfunctions. Plans were no longer sequences of actions but time-stamped\nschedules.

The extensions include critical\npath analysis of sequentially generated plans to generate corresponding optimal\nparallel plans. The linear time algorithm to compute the parallel plan bypasses\nknown NP hardness results for partial ordering by scheduling plans with respect\nto the set of actions and the imposed precedence relations. The efficiency of\nthis algorithm also allows us to improve the exploration guidance: for each\nencountered planning state the corresponding approximate sequential plan is\nscheduled. One major strength of MIPS is its static analysis phase that grounds\nand simplifies parameterized predicates, functions and operators, that infers\nknowledge to minimize the state description length, and that detects domain\nobject symmetries.

We argue that reinforcement learning can only be successfully applied\nto this case if strong assumptions are made on the characteristics of the\nenvironment in which the learning is performed, so that the relevant sensor\nreadings and motor commands can be readily identified. The introduction of such\nassumptions leads to strongly-biased learning systems that can eventually lose\nthe generality of traditional reinforcement-learning algorithms. In this line,\nwe observe that, in realistic situations, the reward received by the robot\ndepends only on a reduced subset of all the executed actions and that only a\nreduced subset of the sensor inputs (possibly different in each situation and\nfor each action) are relevant to predict the reward. We formalize this property\nin the so called 'categorizability assumption' and we present an algorithm that\ntakes advantage of the categorizability of the environment, allowing a decrease\nin the learning time with respect to existing reinforcement-learning\nalgorithms. Results of the application of the algorithm to a couple of\nsimulated realistic-robotic problems (landmark-based navigation and the\nsix-legged robot gait generation) are reported to validate our approach and to\ncompare it to existing flat and generalization-based reinforcement-learning\napproaches.\n"]}]

A challenge all these approaches\nhave to address is to allow for simulations at cell-biologically relevant\ntimescales without neither neglecting important spatial and biochemical\nproperties of the simulated system nor introducing ad-hoc assumptions not based\non physical principles. Here we describe a PSSA that permits large time steps\nwhile still retaining a high degree of accuracy. The approach addresses the\ntypical disadvantage of Brownian dynamics, namely the need to use small time\nsteps to resolve bimolecular encounters accurately, by estimating the number of\notherwise unnoticed encounters with the help of the Green's functions of the\ndiffusion equation incorporating molecular interactions. This method has\npreviously been proposed for purely absorbing boundary conditions and\nirreversible bimolecular reactions. Building on those ideas, we developed a\ngeneral-purpose PSSA that is applicable to a broad class of reaction-diffusion\nproblems by incorporating reflective and radiation boundary conditions and\nreversible reactions. We furthermore discuss how reaction-diffusion systems on\n2D membranes can be described and derive small time expansions of the Green's\nfunctions that substantially speed up key calculations, particularly in the\nproblematic case of molecules in close proximity. Finally, we point out the\nformal relationship between our and exact algorithms.
