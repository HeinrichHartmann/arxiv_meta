We attend\nto a scenario where some of the routers are anonymous, and propose two\nfundamental axioms that model two basic assumptions on the traceroute data: (1)\neach trace corresponds to a real path in the network, and (2) the routing paths\nare at most a factor 1/alpha off the shortest paths, for some parameter alpha\nin (0,1]. In contrast to existing literature that focuses on the cardinality of\nthe set of (often only minimal) inferrable topologies, we argue that a large\nnumber of possible topologies alone is often unproblematic, as long as the\nnetworks have a similar structure. We hence seek to characterize the set of\ntopologies inferred with our axioms. We introduce the notion of star graphs\nwhose colorings capture the differences among inferred topologies; it also\nallows us to construct inferred topologies explicitly. We find that in general,\ninferrable topologies can differ significantly in many important aspects, such\nas the nodes' distances or the number of triangles.

This flare,\nwell observed by RHESSI and TRACE, shows evidence of non-thermal electrons only\nfor a brief, early phase. Throughout the main period of energy release there is\na super-hot (T>30 MK) plasma emitting thermal bremsstrahlung atop the flare\nloops. Our model describes the heating and compression of such a source by\nlocalized, transient magnetic reconnection. It is a three-dimensional\ngeneralization of the Petschek model whereby Alfven-speed retraction following\nreconnection drives supersonic inflows parallel to the field lines, which form\nshocks heating, compressing, and confining a loop-top plasma plug. The\nconfining inflows provide longer life than a freely-expanding or\nconductively-cooling plasma of similar size and temperature. Superposition of\nsuccessive transient episodes of localized reconnection across a current sheet\nproduces an apparently persistent, localized source of high-temperature\nemission. The temperature of the source decreases smoothly on a time scale\nconsistent with observations, far longer than the cooling time of a single\nplug. Built from a disordered collection of small plugs, the source need not\nhave the coherent jet-like structure predicted by steady-state reconnection\nmodels. This new model predicts temperatures and emission measure consistent\nwith the observations of 26 Feb 2004. Furthermore, the total energy released by\nthe flare is found to be roughly consistent with that predicted by the model.\nOnly a small fraction of the energy released appears in the super-hot source at\nany one time, but roughly a quarter of the flare energy is thermalized by the\nreconnection shocks over the course of the flare. All energy is presumed to\nultimately appear in the lower-temperature T<20 MK, post-flare loops.\n"]}]

Creativity presents a formidable\nchallenge for neuroscience. Neuroscience generally involves studying what\nhappens in the brain when someone engages in a task that involves responding to\na stimulus, or retrieving information from memory and using it the right way,\nor at the right time. If the relevant information is not already encoded in\nmemory, the task generally requires that the individual make systematic use of\ninformation that is encoded in memory. But creativity is different. It\nparadoxically involves studying how someone pulls out of their brain something\nthat was never put into it! Moreover, it must be something both new and useful,\nor appropriate to the task at hand. The ability to pull out of memory something\nnew and appropriate that was never stored there in the first place is what we\nrefer to as the magic of creativity. Even if we are so fortunate as to\ndetermine which areas of the brain are active and how these areas interact\nduring creative thought, we will not have an answer to the question of how the\nbrain comes up with solutions and artworks that are new and appropriate. On the\nother hand, since the representational capacity of neurons emerges at a level\nthat is higher than that of the individual neurons themselves, the inner\nworkings of neurons is too low a level to explain the magic of creativity. Thus\nwe look to a level that is midway between gross brain regions and neurons.\nSince creativity generally involves combining concepts from different domains,\nor seeing old ideas from new perspectives, we focus our efforts on the neural\nmechanisms underlying the representation of concepts and ideas. Thus we ask\nquestions about the brain at the level that accounts for its representational\ncapacity, i.e. at the level of distributed aggregates of neurons.\n","Comment: in press; 17 pages; 2 figures"]}]

In this paper, we consider a more general\nscenario defined as the generalized high-SNR regime, where the relays at layer\n$l$ in a layered relay network with $L$ layers do not satisfy the high-SNR\nconditions, and then determine an ANC relay scheme in such network. By relating\nthe received SNR at the nodes with the propagated noise, we derive the rate\nachievable by the ANC scheme proposed in this paper. The result shows that the\nachievable ANC rate approaches the upper bound of the ANC capacity as the\nreceived powers at relays in high SNR increase. A comparison of the two ANC\nschemes implies that the scheme proposed in [4] may not always be the optimal\none in the generalized high-SNR regime. The result also demonstrates that the\nupper and lower bounds of the ANC rate coincide in the limit as the number of\nrelays at layer L-1 dissatisfying the high-SNR conditions tends to infinity,\nyielding an asymptotic capacity result.\n"]}]

The design described here optimizes\nenergy resolution thanks to the use of proportional electroluminescent\namplification (EL); it is compact, as the Xe gas is under high pressure; and it\nallows the measurement of the topological signature of the event to further\nreduce the background contamination.

We propose the use of SiPMs (MPPCs) coated with a\nsuitable wavelength shifter for the tracking, and the use of radiopure\nphotomultipliers for the measurement of the energy and the primary\nscintillation needed to estimate the t0. This design provides the best possible\nenergy resolution compared with other NEXT designs based on avalanche gain\ndevices.

A near critical\ndensity of compact bodies implies that most lines of sight will be\ngravitationally microlensed, and the paper focuses on looking for the predicted\neffects on quasar brightness and spectral variations. These signatures of\nmicrolensing include the shape of the Fourier power spectrum of the light\ncurves, near achromatic and statistically symmetric variations, and the absence\nof time dilation in the timescale of variability. For spectral changes, as the\ncontinuum varies there should be little corresponding change in the strength of\nthe broad lines. In all these cases, the observations are found to be\nconsistent with the predictions for microlensing by a population of stellar\nmass compact bodies. For multiply lensed quasars where the images vary\nindependently it is shown that stellar populations are too small to produce the\nobserved microlensing effects, implying a population of compact dark matter\nbodies of around a stellar mass along the line of sight. The most serious\nobjection to dark matter in the form of compact bodies has come from\nobservations of microlensing of stars in the Magellanic Clouds. In this paper\nthe expected event rate is re-analysed using more recent values for the\nstructure and dynamics of the Galactic halo, and it is shown that there is then\nno conflict with the observations. Finally, the possible identity of a near\ncritical density of dark matter in the form of stellar mass compact bodies is\nreviewed, with the conclusion that by far the most plausible candidates are\nprimordial black holes formed during the QCD epoch.

This suggests\nthat the distribution of stellar birth masses (IMF) is the direct product of\nthe dense core mass function and a uniform star formation efficiency of\n30%+/-10%, and that the stellar IMF may already be fixed during or before the\nearliest stages of core evolution. These results are consistent with previous\ndust continuum studies which suggested that the IMF directly originates from\nthe core mass function.

In a separate paper we will examine the\nimplications of these results for the thermal structure of the interstellar\nmedium. Finally, we investigate the potential importance of photoelectric\nheating in H II regions, including the warm ionized medium. We find that\nphotoelectric heating could be comparable to or exceed heating due to\nphotoionization of H for high ratios of the radiation intensity to the gas\ndensity. We also find that photoelectric heating by dust can account for the\nobserved variation of temperature with distance from the galactic midplane in\nthe warm ionized medium.\n","Comment: 50 pages, including 18 figures; corrected title and abstract fields"]}]
