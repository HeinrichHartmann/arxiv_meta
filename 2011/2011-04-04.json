We propose a model of gamma-ray burst (GRB)\nprompt emission in the Poynting-flux-dominated regime, namely, the\nInternal-Collision-induced MAgnetic Reconnection and Turbulence (ICMART) model.\nIt is envisaged that the GRB central engine launches an intermittent,\nmagnetically-dominated wind, and that in the GRB emission region, the ejecta is\nstill moderately magnetized. Similar to the internal shock (IS) model, the\nmini-shells interact internally at the traditional internal shock radius. Most\nof these early collision have little energy dissipation, but serve to distort\nthe ordered magnetic field lines. At a certain point, the distortion of\nmagnetic field configuration reaches the critical condition to allow fast\nreconnection seeds to occur, which induce relativistic MHD turbulence in the\ninteraction regions. The turbulence further distorts field lines easing\nadditional magnetic reconnections, resulting in a runway release of the stored\nmagnetic field energy (an ICMART event). Particles accelerated in the ICMART\nregion radiate synchrotron photons that power the observed gamma-rays. Each\nICMART event corresponds to a broad pulse in the GRB lightcurve, and a GRB is\ncomposed of multiple ICMART events. This model retains the merits of the IS and\nother models, but may overcome several difficulties/issues faced by the IS\nmodel (e.g. low efficiency, fast cooling, electron number excess,\nAmati/Yonetoku relation inconsistency, and missing bright photosphere). It\npredicts two-component variability time scales, and a decreasing Ep and\npolarization degree during each ICMART event.

X-ray variability studies have revealed complex variability in\nthe accretion flow onto stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars, on\ntimescales as short as milliseconds. The detection of correlated broad-band\nrapid time variability in the jet emission would provide valuable information\non how the variability is transferred along the jet and on the timescales of\nphysical processes operating in these jets, ultimately helping to constrain\ninternal jet physics, probe disk-jet coupling and infer accretion geometry.

The asymptotic analysis\npredicts the fraction of unverified signal elements at each iteration $\\ell$ in\nthe asymptotic regime where $n \\rightarrow \\infty$.
