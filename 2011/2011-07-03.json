We show that in a class of two Higgs doublet model, where one Higgs\ndoublet generates masses of quarks and charged leptons whereas the other Higgs\ndoublet with a tiny vacuum expectation value generates neutrino Dirac masses,\nlarge Yukawa couplings lead to a large enough CP asymmetry of the right-handed\nneutrino decay. Thermal leptogenesis suitably works at low energy scale as\nkeeping no enhancement of lepton number violating wash out effects. We will\nalso point out that thermal leptogenesis works well without confronting\ngravitino problem in a supersymmetric neutrinophilic Higgs doublet model with\ngravity mediated supersymmetry breaking. Neutralino dark matter and baryon\nasymmetry generation by thermal leptogenesis are easily compatible in our\nsetup.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 2 figures"]}]
