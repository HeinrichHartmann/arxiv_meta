Remarkably, its numerical value mu_{0 D} = 140\nM_{sun}/pc^2 = (18.6 Mev)^3 is approximately the same (up to a factor of two)\nin all these systems. First, we present the physical consequences of the\nindependence of mu_{0 D} on r_0: the energy scales as the volume sim r_0^3\nwhile the mass and the entropy scale as the surface ~ r_0^2 and the surface\ntimes log r_0, respectively. Namely, the entropy scales similarly to the\nblack-hole entropy but with a much smaller coefficient. Second, we compute the\nsurface gravity and the density profile for small scales from first principles\nand the evolution of primordial density fluctuations since the end of inflation\ntill today using the linearized Boltzmann-Vlasov equation. The density profile\nrho_{lin}(r) obtained in this way decreases as r^{-1-n_s/2} for intermediate\nscales where n_s = 0.964 is the primordial spectral index. This scaling is in\nremarkable agreement with the empirical behaviour found observationally and in\nN-body simulations: r^{-1.6\\pm 0.4}. The observed value of mu_{0 D} indicates\nthat the DM particle mass m is in the keV scale.

Deterministic finite automata are the simplest\ndevices to recognise regular languages, and deterministic Buchi, Co-Buchi, and\nparity automata play a similar role in the recognition of \\omega-regular\nlanguages. While it is well known that the minimisation of deterministic finite\nand weak automata is cheap, the complexity of minimising deterministic Buchi\nand parity automata has remained an open challenge. We establish the\nNP-completeness of these problems. A second contribution of this report is the\nintroduction of relaxed minimisation of deterministic finite automata. Like\nhyper-minimisation, relaxed minimisation allows for some changes in the\nlanguage of the automaton: We seek a smallest automaton that, when used as a\nmonitor, provides a wrong answer only a bounded number of times in any run of a\nsystem. We argue that minimisation of finite automata, hyper-minimisation,\nrelaxed minimisation, and the minimisation of deterministic Buchi (or Co-Buchi)\nautomata are operations of increasing reduction power, as the respective\nequivalence relations on automata become coarser from left to right. When we\nallow for minor changes in the language, relaxed minimisation can therefore be\nconsidered as a more powerful minimisation technique than hyper-minimisation\nfrom the perspective of finite automata.

Due to the fact that the matter\nand energy content participating in these global phase transitions is a\ncontinuum, there are in effect infinite degrees-of-freedom in the substratum,\nwhich invalidate the usual deterministic laws of the mechanical evolution, and\nallow chance factors to appear in the emergent properties of resonantly-formed\nquantum particles, especially in the acquired phases of their wavefunctions.\nSuch chance factors, though occurring mostly randomly during the early cosmic\nevolution phase, can be harnessed more \"purposefully\" by the biological\nentities co-evolving with the physical universe, due in part to the\nglobally-entangled nature of quantum interactions.
