Surrounding this\ndynamically-cool stellar system, there is a population of stars with a similar\nage and much larger eccentricities and inclinations relative to the disk. We\npropose a hypothesis for the origin of this dynamical dichotomy. Without\nspecifying any specific mechanism, we consider the possibility that both\nstellar populations were formed within a disk some 6 Myr ago. But this orderly\nstructure was dynamically perturbed outside-in by an intruding object with a\nmass ~10^4 Msun, which may be an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) or a dark\nstellar cluster hosting an IMBH. We suggest that the perturber migrated inward\nto ~0.15-0.3pc from the GC under the action of dynamical friction. Along the\nway, it captured many stars in the outer disk region into its mean-motion\nresonance, forced them to migrate with it, closely encountered with them, and\ninduced the growth of their eccentricity and inclination. But stars in the\ninner regions of the disk retain their initial coplanar structure. We predict\nthat some of the inclined and eccentric stars surrounding the disk may have\nsimilar Galactocentric semimajor axis. Future precision determination of their\nkinematic distribution of these stars will not only provide a test for this\nhypothesis but also evidences for the presence of an IMBH or a dark cluster at\nthe immediate proximity of the massive black hole at the GC.

It is shown that it can be drastically reduced in the Yukawa sector\nif the effective Yukawa couplings involving colored triplet Higgs bosons are\ntuned to suppress the decay rate of the proton. In the supersymmetry-breaking\nsector, the usual requirement of independence of flavour and field type for the\nmechanism of mediation of supersymmetry breaking is not sufficient to forbid\narbitrary flavour and CP violations at the tree level. Special conditions to be\nadded to this requirement, under which such violations can be avoided, are\nidentified. Depending on how and whether these conditions are implemented,\ndifferent phenomenological scenarios emerge. Flavour and CP violations of soft\nmassive parameters induced by neutrino-seesaw couplings are discussed\nexplicitly for the simplest scenario, in which no such violations are present\nat the tree level. Guidelines for studying them in other, less simple scenarios\nare given. Lists of all renormalization group equations needed for their\ncalculations are provided for each of the three types of seesaw mechanism, at\nall energies between the TeV scale and Planck scale.\n","Comment: 108 pages, 4 figs. v4: Minor improvements.

While there are many works studying how this can be done\nwith future observations, in this paper a constraint on the quadrupole moment\nof these objects is obtained by using the current estimate of the mean\nradiative efficiency of AGN. In terms of the anomalous quadrupole moment $q$,\nthe bound is $-2.01 < q < 0.14$.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures. v2: refereed version"]}]

High-level context information is typically obtained from context\nservices that aggregate raw context information sensed by various sensors and\nmobile devices. Given the massive amount of sensed data, traditional context\nservices are lacking the necessary resources to store and process these data,\nas well as to disseminate high-level context information to a variety of\npotential context consumers. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for\ncontext information provisioning, which relies on deploying context services on\nthe cloud and using context brokers to mediate between context consumers and\ncontext services using a publish/subscribe model. Moreover, we describe a\nmulti-attributes decision algorithm for the selection of potential context\nservices that can fulfill context consumers' requests for context information.\nThe algorithm calculates the score of each context service, per context\ninformation type, based on the quality-of-service (QoS) and quality-of-context\ninformation (QoC) requirements expressed by the context consumer. One of the\nbenefits of the approach is that context providers can scale up and down, in\nterms of cloud resources they use, depending on current demand for context\ninformation. Besides, the selection algorithm allows ranking context services\nby matching their QoS and QoC offers against the QoS and QoC requirements of\nthe context consumer.\n","Comment: 8 Pages"]}]

The continuum emission was studied through the EPIC spectra by\ntaking advantage of the spectral range of these cameras. The high-resolution\nRGS spectra were analyzed to characterize the absorbing and emission line\nfeatures that arise in the spectra of the sources. All these data, complemented\nby information in the UV, are analyzed jointly in order to achieve a consistent\ncharacterization of the observed features in each object.\n  Results. The continuum emission of the sources can be characterized either by\na combination of a power law and a black body for the weakest objects or by two\npower law components for the brightest ones. The continuum is not absorbed by\nneutral or ionized material in the line of sight to any of these sources. In\nall of them we have identified a narrow Fe-Kalpha line at 6.4 keV. In ESO\n559-G19 we also find an FeXXVI line at about 7 keV. In the soft X-rays band, we\nidentify only one OVII line in the spectra of HE 1143-1810 and CTS A08.12, and\ntwo OVII-He alpha triplets and a narrow OVIII-Ly alpha emission line in Mrk\n110.\n  Conclusions. Not detecting warm material in the line of sight to the low\nstate objects is due to intrinsically weaker or absent absorption in the line\nof sight and not to a low signal-to-noise ratio in the data. Besides this, the\nabsence of clear emission lines cannot be fully attributed to dilution of those\nlines by a strong continuum.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 7 figures, 9 tables, accepted by A&A"]}]

At low <N>, the mean pair and triple\ncounts are well below Poisson expectations, with important consequences for\nsmall scale behavior of 2- and 3-point correlation functions. The HOD depends\nstrongly on galaxy age, with high mass halos populated mainly by old galaxies\nand low mass halos by young galaxies. The SPH simulation supports several\nsimplifying assumptions about HOD bias: the most massive galaxy in a halo\nusually lies close to the center and moves near the halo's mean velocity;\nsatellite galaxies have the same radial profile and velocity dispersion as the\ndark matter; and the mean occupation at fixed halo mass is independent of the\nhalo's larger scale environment.

The simulations incorporate the main\nphysical processes critical to various aspects of galaxy formation and have a\ndynamic range high enough to identify individual star forming regions. The\nresults indicate that the global Schmidt law is a manifestation of the overall\ndensity distribution of the interstellar medium (ISM). In particular, the\ndensity probability distribution function (PDF) in the simulated disks is\nsimilar to that observed in recent state-of-the-art modeling of the turbulent\nISM and has a well-defined generic shape. The shape of the PDF in a given\nregion of the disk depends on the local average surface density Sigma_g. The\ndependence is such that the fraction of gas mass in the high-density tail of\nthe distribution scales as Sigma_g^{n-1} with n~1.4, which gives rise to the\nSchmidt-like correlation. The high-density tail of the PDF is remarkably\ninsensitive to the inclusion of feedback and details of the cooling and heating\nprocesses.

We begin by reviewing the instabilities that are\nexpected to form extensive structure near Ledd. We investigate how this\n\"porosity\" can reduce the effective coupling between the matter and radiation.\nIntroducing a new \"porosity-length'' formalism, we derive a simple scaling for\nthe reduced effective opacity, and use this to derive an associated scaling for\nthe porosity-moderated, continuum-driven mass loss rate from stars that\nformally exceed Ledd. For a simple super-Eddington model with a single porosity\nlength that is assumed to be on the order of the gravitational scale height,\nthe overall mass loss is similar to that derived in previous porosity work.\nThis is much higher than is typical of line-driven winds, but is still only a\nfew percent of the photon tiring limit--for which the luminosity becomes\ninsufficient to carry the flow out of the gravitational potential. To obtain\nstill stronger mass loss that approaches observationally inferred values near\nthis limit, we introduce a power-law-porosity model in which the associated\nstructure has a broad range of scales. We show that the mass loss rate can be\nenhanced by a factor that increases with the Eddington parameter Gamma, such\nthat for moderately large Gamma (> 3-4), mass loss rates could approach the\nphoton tiring limit.

Such behaviour is traced to the shortening of mode periods\nunder the action of the Coriolis force.

In the linear regime,\ndensity perturbations exhibit scale dependent runaway growth at late times and,\nin particular, a mode of a given wavenumber goes nonlinear at a higher redshift\nthan in the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model. We discuss the implications of this\nbehavior and why there are reasons to expect that the growth will be cut off in\nthe nonlinear regime. Assuming that this holds in a full nonlinear analysis, we\nbriefly describe how upcoming measurements may probe the differences between\nthe modified theory and the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 6 figures, uses iopart style"]}]

This approach\ninserts the inflationary slow roll parameters directly into a Monte Carlo\nMarkov chain estimate of the cosmological parameters, and uses the inflationary\nflow hierarchy to compute the parameters' scale-dependence. We work with the\nfirst three parameters (epsilon, eta and xi) and pay close attention to the\npossibility that the 3 year WMAP dataset contains evidence for a ``running''\nspectral index, which is dominated by the xi term. Mirroring the WMAP team's\nanalysis we find that the permitted distribution of xi is broad, and centered\naway from zero. However, when we require that inflationary parameters yield at\nleast 30 additional e-folds of inflation after the largest observable scales\nleave the horizon, the bounds on xi tighten dramatically. We make use of the\nabsence of an explicit pivot scale in the slow roll reconstruction formalism to\ndetermine the dependence of the computed parameter distributions on the pivot.\nWe show that the choice of pivot has a significant effect on the inferred\nconstraints on the inflationary variables, and the spectral index and running\nderived from them.

On the assumption that the observed gamma-rays are produced by\naccelerated particles in the remnants (rather than, for example, from a central\ncompact object) we model the contributions due to pion production,\nbremsstrahlung, and inverse Compton scattering on the cosmic microwave, diffuse\ngalactic radiation, and locally produced radiation fields. In the case of the\nsame spectral index for both electrons and nuclei, and a cut-off at 80 TeV, we\nfind that a spectral index of accelerated particles close to 2.4, and a ratio\nof electrons to protons in the range 0.2 to 0.3, gives a good fit to the\nobserved spectra. For lower cut-off energies flatter spectra are possible. We\nalso investigate the case where the electron spectrum is steeper than that of\nnuclei. We discuss the implications of our results for observations at air\nshower energies, and for the propagation of cosmic rays.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 8 figures, major revisions, accepted for publication in\n  Astrophysical Journal"]}]
