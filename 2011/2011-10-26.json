The orbital\ninclination is known from spectroscopic observations of moving lines; the\ndistance is derived from radio interferometry of relativistic jets; the mass\nratio of its components is determined from X-ray observations of jets'\neclipses.

The\ndetermination of general parameters of SS 433 leads to fairly accurate\nestimates of luminosity, radius, and mass of the A star in the system, and\nconsequently leads to an accurate estimate of the mass of the compact\ncomponent, the source of jets.

Computation, 46 (5), 2011. We\npresent a new fraction-free algorithm for the computation of a diagonal form of\na matrix over a certain non-commutative Euclidean domain over a computable\nfield with the help of Gr\\\"obner bases. This algorithm is formulated in a\ngeneral constructive framework of non-commutative Ore localizations of\n$G$-algebras (OLGAs). We split the computation of a normal form of a matrix\ninto the diagonalization and the normalization processes. Both of them can be\nmade fraction-free. For a matrix $M$ over an OLGA we provide a diagonalization\nalgorithm to compute $U,V$ and $D$ with fraction-free entries such that $UMV=D$\nholds and $D$ is diagonal. The fraction-free approach gives us more information\non the system of linear functional equations and its solutions, than the\nclassical setup of an operator algebra with rational functions coefficients. In\nparticular, one can handle distributional solutions together with, say,\nmeromorphic ones. We investigate Ore localizations of common operator algebras\nover $K[x]$ and use them in the unimodularity analysis of transformation\nmatrices $U,V$. In turn, this allows to lift the isomorphism of modules over an\nOLGA Euclidean domain to a polynomial subring of it. We discuss the relation of\nthis lifting with the solutions of the original system of equations. Moreover,\nwe prove some new results concerning normal forms of matrices over non-simple\ndomains. Our implementation in the computer algebra system {\\sc\nSingular:Plural} follows the fraction-free strategy and shows impressive\nperformance, compared with methods which directly use fractions. Since we\nexperience moderate swell of coefficients and obtain simple transformation\nmatrices, the method we propose is well suited for solving nontrivial practical\nproblems.\n","Comment: 25 pages, to appear in Journal of Symbolic Computation"]}]
