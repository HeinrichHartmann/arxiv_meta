A classical simple fluid with a locally\nintroduced field imitating a permeable solid is considered. The cases of micro-\nand macroscopically smooth boundary are examined and the analysis of static\nmembranes is performed. Henry constant of adsorption and its connection with\nHenry constant of absorption, specific surface grand potential (gamma) and the\nsurface number density are determined. High-temperature expansions and\nlow-temperature limit for basic values are obtained. \"The surface tension\ncoefficient\" decomposes into a value proportional to Henry constant of\nadsorption depending on the position of the separating surface, and a universal\nnonlinear surface coefficient. Two approaches to this problem are analyzed:\nthrough the surface cluster expansion and through the pressure tensor. Within\nthe first approach, the series in powers of activity is obtained for gamma.\nThis expression is similar to the cluster expansion for pressure but in\ncontrast to this case the integrals of Ursell factors contain the multipliers\ndepending on the potential of particles interaction with the external field.\nWithin the second approach, Kirkwood-Buff formula for gamma is extended for the\ncase of the field of finite value.

This system can be realized, as a\nspatial-domain one, in optics, and also in Bose-Einstein condensates of\nquasi-particles in solid-state settings. Recently, exact solutions were found\nfor localized modes pinned to the single HS represented by the delta-function.\nThe present paper reports analytical and numerical solutions for coexisting\ntwo- and multi-peak modes, which may be symmetric or antisymmetric with respect\nto the underlying HS pair. Stability of the modes is explored through\nsimulations of their perturbed evolution. The sign of the cubic nonlinearity\nplays a crucial role: in the case of the self-focusing, only the fundamental\nsymmetric and antisymmetric modes, with two local peaks tacked to the HSs, and\nno additional peaks between them, may be stable. In this case, all the\nhigher-order multi-peak modes, being unstable, evolve into the fundamental\nones. Stability regions for the fundamental modes are reported. A more\ninteresting situation is found in the case of the self-defocusing cubic\nnonlinearity, with the HS pair giving rise to a multi-stability, with up to\neight coexisting stable multi-peak patterns, symmetric and antisymmetric ones.\nThe system without the self-interaction, the nonlinearity 2 being represented\nonly by the local cubic loss, is investigated too. This case is similar to\nthose with the self-focusing or defocusing nonlinearity, if the linear\npotential of the HS is, respectively, attractive or repulsive. An additional\nfeature of the former setting is the coexistence of the stable fundamental\nmodes with robust breathers.\n","Comment: Phys. Rev. E, in press"]}]

We summarize\na scalar theory of gravity with a such \"ether\", which starts from a tentative\ninterpretation of gravity as a pressure force. The theory also admits that our\nphysical standards of space and time are affected by gravitation similarly as\nthey are affected by a uniform motion. General motion is governed by an\nextension of Newton's second law to the curved space-time which is thus\nobtained. Together with the scalar field equation of the theory, this leads to\na true conservation equation for the total energy. The law of motion also leads\nto an alternative 4-component equation governing the dynamics of a continuum in\nterms of its energy-momentum tensor. That new equation implies that mass\nconservation is obtained as a limiting behaviour for a weak and slowly varying\ngravitational field and/or at a low pressure. In the presence of the Lorentz\nforce field, the new dynamical equation gives the second group of the\ngravitationally-modified Maxwell equations in the investigated theory. This is\nconsistent with the geometrical optics of the theory as governed by the\nproposed extension of Newton's second law. The theory has the correct Newtonian\nlimit; it predicts Schwarzschild's exterior metric of general relativity and\ngeodesic motion in the static situation with spherical symmetry. A\npost-Newtonian approximation of this theory shows that no preferred-frame\neffect occurs for photons at the (first) post-Newtonian approximation.

Through the lateral surface of\nthose cylinders we allow for a selective flux of species. The inward or outward\nflux obeys a complex dynamics regulated by the competition between the\ndiffusion kinetics and the chemical kinetics that answer for the reduction of\nspecies at a reactive surface located at the bottom of the cylindrical\ncavities. The analytical expression for the current transient is complemented\nby a random prescription for the influx or outflux of matter through the\nlateral surface plus a modulation in its intensity that follows the surface\ncorrugation.
