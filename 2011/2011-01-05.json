We also construct a bivariant (in\nthe sense of Fulton and MacPherson) theory for topological stacks: it gives us\na flexible theory of Gysin maps which are automatically compatible with\npullback, pushforward and products. Further we prove an excess formula in this\ncontext. We introduce oriented stacks, generalizing oriented manifolds, which\nare stacks on which we can do string topology. We prove that the homology of\nthe free loop stack of an oriented stack and the homology of hidden loops\n(sometimes called ghost loops) are a Frobenius algebra which are related by a\nnatural morphism of Frobenius algebras. We also prove that the homology of free\nloop stack has a natural structure of a BV-algebra, which together with the\nFrobenius structure fits into an homological conformal field theories with\nclosed positive boundaries.

A LABOCA census of starless\n  and protostellar cores"],"description":["  Chamaeleon I is the most active region in terms of star formation in the\nChamaeleon molecular cloud complex. Its population of prestellar and\nprotostellar cores is not known and a controversy exists concerning its history\nof star formation. Our goal is to characterize the earliest stages of star\nformation in this cloud. We used the bolometer array LABOCA at APEX to map the\ncloud in dust continuum emission at 870 micron. The detected sources are\nanalysed by carefully taking into account the spatial filtering inherent in the\ndata reduction process. A search for associations with YSOs is performed using\nSpitzer data and the SIMBAD database. Most of the detected 870 micron emission\nis distributed in 5 filaments. We identify 59 starless cores, one candidate\nfirst hydrostatic core, and 21 sources associated with more evolved YSOs. The\nstarless cores are only found above a visual extinction threshold of 5 mag.\nThey are less dense than those detected in other nearby molecular clouds by a\nfactor of a few on average. The core mass distribution is consistent with the\nIMF at the high-mass end but is overpopulated at the low-mass end. In addition,\nat most 17% of the cores have a mass larger than the critical Bonnor-Ebert\nmass. Both results suggest that a large fraction of the starless cores may not\nbe prestellar. Based on the census of prestellar cores, Class 0 protostars, and\nmore evolved YSOs, we conclude that the star formation rate has decreased with\ntime in this cloud. The low fraction of candidate prestellar cores among the\npopulation of starless cores, the small number of Class 0 protostars, the high\nglobal star formation efficiency, the decrease of the star formation rate with\ntime, and the low mass per unit length of the detected filaments all suggest\nthat we may be witnessing the end of the star formation process in Cha I\n{abridged}.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A. 35 pages, 17 figures, 13 tables.
