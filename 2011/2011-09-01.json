Wang, Y.-C. Lai, J. Ren, B. Li & C. Grebogi\n[arXiv:1107.2177v1] proposed a method for the control of complex networks with\nnonlinear dynamics based on linearizing the system around a finite number of\nlocal desired states. The authors purport that any bidirectional network with\none-dimensional intrinsic node dynamics can be fully controlled by a single\ndriver node, which can be any node in the network, regardless of the network\ntopology. According to this result, a network with an arbitrarily large number\nof nodes (a million, a billion, or even more) could be controlled by a single\nnode. Here we show, however, that this result is specious and that it does not\nhold true even for networks with only two nodes. We demonstrate that the\nerroneous results are a consequence of a fundamental flaw in the proposed\nmethod, namely, that reaching a local desired state using the proposed\nlinearization procedure generally requires a nonlocal trajectory, which grossly\nviolates the linear approximation. Their further conclusion that network\nsystems with nonlinear dynamics are more controllable than those with linear\ndynamics is a known fact presented as novel based on a flawed argument. A\ncentral problem underlying the authors' argument is that their formulation is\nentirely based on the number of driver nodes required to reach a desired\nstate---even when this number is one, keeping the system at that desired state\ngenerally requires directly controlling all nodes in the network. When this is\ntaken into account, the conclusion that nonlinear dynamics can facilitate\nnetwork control was already anticipated in S.P. Cornelius, W.L.

Security is then defined by\nrequiring that as long as the queries satisfy some constraint, there is some\nproblem the adversary cannot solve, such as compute a certain piece of\ninformation. In this paper, we introduce a fundamentally new model of quantum\nattacks on classical cryptographic protocols, where the adversary is allowed to\nask several classical queries in quantum superposition. This is a strictly\nstronger attack than the standard one, and we consider the security of several\nprimitives in this model. We show that a secret-sharing scheme that is secure\nwith threshold $t$ in the standard model is secure against superposition\nattacks if and only if the threshold is lowered to $t/2$. We use this result to\ngive zero-knowledge proofs for all of NP in the common reference string model.\nWhile our protocol is classical, it is sound against a cheating unbounded\nquantum prover and computational zero-knowledge even if the verifier is allowed\na superposition attack. Finally, we consider multiparty computation and show\nthat for the most general type of attack, simulation based security is not\npossible. However, putting a natural constraint on the adversary, we show a\nnon-trivial example of a protocol that can indeed be simulated.\n","Comment: 29 pages"]}]
