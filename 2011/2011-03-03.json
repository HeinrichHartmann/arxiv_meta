These have been used to inform a complete end-to-end Monte\nCarlo simulation that has then been used to calculate the expected performance\nof the new instrument, both operating alone and as an anti-coincidence detector\nfor ZEPLIN-III. The veto device will be capable of rejecting over 65% of\ncoincident nuclear recoil events from neutron background in the energy range of\ninterest in ZEPLIN-III. This will reduce the background in ZEPLIN-III from ~0.4\nto ~0.14 events per year in the WIMP acceptance region, a significant factor in\nthe event of a non-zero observation. Furthermore, in addition to providing\nvaluable diagnostic capabilities, the veto is capable of tagging over 15% for\ngamma-ray rejection, all whilst contributing no significant additional\nbackground. In conjunction with the replacement of the internal ZEPLIN-III\nphotomultiplier array, the new veto is expected to improve significantly the\nsensitivity of the ZEPLIN-III instrument to dark matter, allowing spin\nindependent WIMP-nucleon cross sections below 1E-8 pb to be probed.\n"]}]

We\nfurther analyse the CP-conserving observables, $A_{T}^{(2)}$, $A_{T}^{(3)}$ and\n$A_{T}^{(4)}$. They are practically free of theoretical uncertainties due to\nthe soft form factors for the full range of dilepton masses rather than just at\na single point as for $A_{FB}$. They also have a higher sensitivity to specific\nnew physics scenarios compared to observables such as $A_{FB}$.

The\nlaw of the channel is presumed to be known to the receiver. In addition, we\nassume the power spectral density (PSD) of the fading process to be compactly\nsupported. For i.i.d. zero-mean proper Gaussian input distributions, we\ninvestigate the achievable rate. One of the main contributions is the\nderivation of two new upper bounds on the achievable rate with zero-mean proper\nGaussian input symbols. The first one holds only for the special case of a\nrectangular PSD and depends on the SNR and the spread of the PSD. Together with\na lower bound on the achievable rate, which is achievable with i.i.d. zero-mean\nproper Gaussian input symbols, we have found a set of bounds which is tight in\nthe sense that their difference is bounded. Furthermore, we show that the high\nSNR slope is characterized by a pre-log of 1-2f_d, where f_d is the normalized\nmaximum Doppler frequency. This pre-log is equal to the high SNR pre-log of the\npeak power constrained capacity. Furthermore, we derive an alternative upper\nbound on the achievable rate with i.i.d. input symbols which is based on the\none-step channel prediction error variance. The novelty lies in the fact that\nthis bound is not restricted to peak power constrained input symbols like known\nbounds, e.g. in [1]. Therefore, the derived upper bound can also be used to\nevaluate the achievable rate with i.i.d. proper Gaussian input symbols. We\ncompare the derived bounds on the achievable rate with i.i.d. zero-mean proper\nGaussian input symbols with bounds on the peak power constrained capacity given\nin [1-3]. Finally, we compare the achievable rate with i.i.d. zero-mean proper\nGaussian input symbols with the achievable rate using synchronized detection in\ncombination with a solely pilot based channel estimation.\n","Comment: submitted to the Transactions on Information Theory"]}]

The latter\nvariations testify in favor of that there were cavities at the place of DI\nejection. The beginning of the increase of the main outburst at 8 s after the\nDI impact could be caused by excavation of a relatively large cavity that\ncontained dust and gas under pressure. The upper boarder of the cavity could be\nlocated at about 5-10 meters below the surface of the comet. This cavity could\nbe deep because the excavation from the cavity could last for at least a few\ntens of seconds. With the increase of the crater, more cavities could be\nexcavated. The outburst decreased at ~60 s after the impact.

This model can be used to analyze and remove the\ncontribution of aerosols in remote sensing observations. We have developed a\nmethod to quantify the contribution of atmospheric dust in near-IR spectra of\nthe Martian surface obtained by the OMEGA imaging spectrometer on board Mars\nExpress.

Martian airborne dust properties are discussed and\nconstrained from previous studies and OMEGA data. We have tested our method on\na region at 90{\\deg}E and 77{\\deg}N extensively covered by OMEGA, where\nsignificant variations of the albedo of ice patches in the visible have been\nreported. The consistency between reflectance spectra of ice-covered and\nice-free regions recovered at different incidence angles validates our\napproach. The optical depth of aerosols varies by a factor 3 in this region\nduring the summer of Martian year 27. The observed brightening of ice patches\ndoes not result from frost deposition but from a decrease in the dust\ncontamination of surface ice and (to a lower extent) from a decrease in the\noptical thickness of atmospheric dust.

In \\cite{R3} (math.KT/0405211) we showed that\nthe FIC (Fibered Isomorphism Conjecture for pseudoisotopy functor) for a\nparticular class of 3-manifolds (we denoted this class by \\cal C) is the key to\nprove the FIC for 3-manifold groups in general. And we proved the FIC for the\nfundamental groups of members of a subclass of \\cal C. This result was obtained\nby showing that the double of any member of this subclass is either Seifert\nfibered or supports a nonpositively curved metric. In this article we prove\nthat for any M in {\\cal C} there is a closed 3-manifold P such that either P is\nSeifert fibered or is a nonpositively curved 3-manifold and \\pi_1(M) is a\nsubgroup of \\pi_1(P). As a consequence this proves that the FIC is true for any\nB-group (see definition 3.2 in \\cite{R3}). Therefore, the FIC is true for any\nHaken 3-manifold group and hence for any 3-manifold group (using the reduction\ntheorem of \\cite{R3}) provided we assume the Geometrization conjecture. The\nabove result also proves the FIC for a class of 4-manifold groups (see\n\\cite{R2}(math.GT/0209119)).\n  The second aspect of this article is to relax a condition in the definition\nof strongly poly-surface group (\\cite{R1} (math.GT/0209118)) and define a new\nclass of groups (we call them {\\it weak strongly poly-surface} groups).
