This enables us to introduce the notion of\nquantum object. 2) Classical systems are defined as macroscopic quantum objects\nin states close to maximum entropy. For classical mechanics, new states of such\nkind are introduced, the so-called maximum-entropy packets, and shown to\napproximate classical dynamics better than Gaussian wave packets. 3) A new\nsolution of quantum measurement problem is proposed for measurements that are\nperformed on microsystems. First, it is assumed that readings of registration\napparatuses are always signals from detectors. This implies restrictions on\nwhat is observable. Second, an application of the cluster separability\nprinciple leads to the key notion of the paper: the separation status of\nmicrosystems. The processes of preparation and registration include changes of\nseparation status. A crucial observation is that standard quantum mechanics\ndoes not prescribe the evolution during such changes.

Without a sound model of the centre's electronic\nstructure, the understanding of the system's unique dynamical properties can\nnot effectively progress. In this work, the molecular model of the defect\ncentre is fully developed to provide a self consistent model of the complete\nelectronic structure of the centre. The application of the model to describe\nthe effects of electric, magnetic and strain interactions, as well as the\nvariation of the centre's fine structure with temperature, provides an\ninvaluable tool to those studying the centre and a means to design future\nempirical and ab initio studies of this important defect.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 6 figures, 10 tables"]}]
