In general,\nthere is no reason why only one of these - the one corresponding to weak\nhypercharge - should be massless. Observations require that standard model\nparticles must be neutral (or have an extremely small charge) under additional\nmassless U(1)s, i.e. the latter have to belong to a so called hidden sector.\nThe exchange of heavy messengers, however, can lead to a kinetic mixing between\nthe hypercharge and the hidden-sector U(1)s, that is testable with near future\nexperiments. This provides a powerful probe of the hidden sectors and, as a\nconsequence, of the string theory realisation itself. In the present paper, we\nshow, using a variety of methods, how the kinetic mixing can be derived from\nthe underlying type II string compactification, involving supersymmetric and\nnonsupersymmetric configurations of D-branes, both in large volumes and in\nwarped backgrounds with fluxes. We first demonstrate by explicit example that\nkinetic mixing occurs in a completely supersymmetric set-up where we can use\nconformal field theory techniques. We then develop a supergravity approach\nwhich allows us to examine the phenomenon in more general backgrounds, where we\nfind that kinetic mixing is natural in the context of flux compactifications.\nWe discuss the phenomenological consequences for experiments at the low-energy\nfrontier, searching for signatures of light, sub-electronvolt or even massless\nhidden-sector U(1) gauge bosons and minicharged particles.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 5 figures"]}]

The term is generated when the theory contains a\nscale explicitly, when it is asymptotically free and in particular also when\nthe scale invariance is spontaneously broken. The terms are not generated when\nthe scale invariance is maintained. Examples studied include the large $N$\nlimit of the $CP^{N-1}$ model in $(2+\\epsilon)$ dimensions, a 3D gauged\n$\\phi^6$ vector model and its supersymmetric extension.

Such\noutflows are potentially more important than galactic winds, which appear\ninsufficient to produce the level of preheating inferred from X-ray\nobservations of galaxy clusters. Using a simple analytical model for the\ndistribution of quasars with redshift, coupled with a one-dimensional\nSedov-Taylor model for outflows, we are able to make robust statements about\ntheir impact of on structure formation. As large regions of the IGM are heated\nabove a critical entropy of approximately 100 keV cm^2, cooling become\nimpossible within them, regardless of changes in density. On quasar scales,\nthis has the effect of inhibiting further formation, resulting in the observed\nfall-off in their number densities below z = 2. On galaxy scales, quasar\nfeedback fixes the turn-over scale in the galaxy luminosity function (L_*) as\nthe nonlinear scale at the redshift of strong feedback. The galaxy luminosity\nfunction then remains largely fixed after this epoch, consistent with recent\nobservations and in contrast to the strong evolution predicted in more standard\ngalaxy-formation models. Finally, strong quasar feedback explains why the\nintracluster medium is observed to have been pre-heated to entropy levels just\nabove S_crit, the minimum excess that would not have been erased by cooling.\nThe presence of such outflows is completely consistent with the observed\nproperties of the Lyman-alpha forest at z ~ 2, but is expected to have a\nsubstantial and detectable impact on Compton distortions observed in the\nmicrowave background and the multiphase properties of the \"warm-hot\" (z=0)\ncircumgalactic medium.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 11 figures, ApJ, accepted (minor changes made, two plots\n  updated)"]}]

However, a massive star origin for GRBs implies a\nstellar wind environment, probably a Wolf-Rayet star, and we have previously\nsuggested wind interaction models for the afterglows of GRBs 980326, 980519,\nand 980425/SN 1998bw. Here, we extend the theory of afterglows in winds,\nconsidering strong cooling phases, the transition to nonrelativistic motion,\njets, and prompt, reverse shock emission. We find that, compared to the\ninterstellar case, the optical prompt emission in the wind case could have a\ncomparable magnitude, but would die off faster. We examine the afterglows of\nother well-observed GRBs in the context of wind interaction models, and find\nthat GRBs 970228 and 970508 are likely wind interactors. The revision in the\nnonthermal afterglow emission from GRB 970228 caused by the recognition of late\nsupernova emission favors wind interaction. The radio evolution of GRB 970508\nprovides especially strong evidence for wind interaction. For GRB 970508, the\nobservations suggest a density that is compatible with that expected in a\nWolf-Rayet star wind. Finally, observations of the afterglow evolution of GRBs\n990123 and 990510 and the prompt optical emission from GRB 990123 favor\ninterstellar interaction models, which would suggest compact star merger\nprogenitors for these objects.\n","Comment: 40 pages, 3 figures, with expanded discussion of afterglow light\n  curves, prompt emission, and GRB 970508.

The nucleon-nucleon force is described\nin terms of one- and two-pion exchange and local short distance operators,\nwhich depend explicitly and implicitly on the quark masses. The pion propagator\nbecomes Coulomb-like in the chiral limit and thus one has significant\nscattering in all partial waves. The pion-nucleon coupling depends implicitly\non the quark masses and we find that it becomes stronger in the chiral limit.\nThere is a further quark mass dependence in the S-wave four--nucleon couplings,\nwhich can be estimated by means of dimensional analysis. We find that nuclear\nphysics in the chiral limit becomes natural. There are no new bound states, the\ndeuteron binding energy is B_D^{CL} = 9.6 +/- 1.9^+1.8_-1.0 MeV, and the S-wave\nscattering lengths take values of a few fm, a_{CL} (^1S_0) = -4.1 +/-\n1.6^+0.0_-0.4 fm and a_{CL} (^3S_1) = 1.5 +/- 0.4^+0.2_-0.3 fm. We also discuss\nthe extrapolation to larger pion masses pertinent for the extraction of these\nquantities from lattice simulations.\n","Comment: 35 pp, LaTeX2e, 13 figures"]}]

A considerable amount of power is required in order to generate\nintense beams of rare isotopes for subsequent acceleration.

To overcome this limit, we have studied the possibility of\naccelerating multiple-charge-state (multi-Q) beams through a linac. We show\nthat such operation is made feasible by the large transverse and longitudinal\nacceptance which can be obtained in a linac using superconducting cavities.\nMulti-Q operation provides not only a substantial increase in beam current, but\nalso enables the use of two strippers, thus reducing the size of linac\nrequired. Since the superconducting (SC) linac operates in CW mode, space\ncharge effects are essentially eliminated except in the ECR/RFQ region.\nTherefore an effective emittance growth due to the multi-charge beam\nacceleration can be minimized.\n","Comment: LINAC2000, FR101"]}]
