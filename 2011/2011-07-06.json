This process has an infinitesimal generator of\nthe form $mI-(m^{2/\\alpha}I-\\Delta)^{\\alpha/2},$ where $0<\\alpha<2$, $m>0$, and\nreduces to the isotropic $\\alpha$-stable process for $m=0$. Its potential\ntheory for open bounded sets has been well developed throughout the recent\nyears however almost nothing was known about the behaviour of the process on\nunbounded sets. The present paper is intended to fill this gap and we provide\ntwo-sided sharp estimates for the Green function for a half-space. As a\nbyproduct we obtain some improvements of the estimates known for bounded sets\nspecially for balls. The advantage of these estimates is a clarification of the\nrelationship between the diameter of the ball and the parameter $m$ of the\nprocess.\n  The main result states that the Green function is comparable with the Green\nfunction for the Brownian motion if the points are away from the boundary of a\nhalf-space and their distance is greater than one. On the other hand for the\nremaining points the Green function is somehow related the Green function for\nthe isotropic $\\alpha$-stable process.

However, recent practical and theoretical developments,\nsuch as phased array feeds (PAFs), aperture arrays (AAs) and wide-field\npolarimetry, are exposing limitations of the formalism. This paper aims to\ndevelop a more general formalism that can be used to both clearly define the\nlimitations of the matrix RIME, and to describe observational scenarios that\nlie outside these limitations. Some assumptions underlying the matrix RIME are\nexplicated and analysed in detail. To this purpose, an array correlation matrix\n(ACM) formalism is explored. This proves of limited use; it is shown that\nmatrix algebra is simply not a sufficiently flexible tool for the job. To\novercome these limitations, a more general formalism based on tensors and the\nEinstein notation is proposed and explored both theoretically, and with a view\nto practical implementations. The tensor formalism elegantly yields generalized\nRIMEs describing beamforming, mutual coupling, and wide-field polarimetry in\none equation. It is shown that under the explicated assumptions, tensor\nequations reduce to the 2x2 RIME. From a practical point of view, some methods\nfor implementing tensor equations in an optimal way are proposed and analysed.\nThe tensor RIME is a powerful means of describing observational scenarios not\namenable to the matrix RIME. Even in cases where the latter remains applicable,\nthe tensor formalism can be a valuable tool for understanding the limits of\nsuch applicability.\n","Comment: 16 pages, no figures, accepted by A&A"]}]

In particular, it can be used to derive\nconstraints for stellar spin-orbit misalignment, capture in Cassini states,\ntidal-Kozai migration, or damping of the mutual inclination. Because our model\nis valid for the non-restricted problem, it can be used to study systems of\nidentical mass or for the outer restricted problem, such as the evolution of a\nplanet around a binary of stars. Here, we apply our model to three distinct\nsituations: 1) the HD80606 planetary system, for which we obtain the\nprobability density function distribution for the misalignment angle, with two\npronounced peaks of higher probability around 53 and 109 degrees; 2) the\nHD98800 binary system, for which we show that initial prograde orbits inside\nthe observed disc may become retrograde and vice-versa, only because of tidal\nmigration within the binary stars; 3) the HD11964 planetary system, for which\nwe show that tidal dissipation combined with gravitational perturbations may\nlead to a decrease in the mutual inclination, and a fast circularization of the\ninner orbit.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables, in press"]}]

If the oscillators have\ndistributed natural frequencies and common shear (or nonisochronicity), the\ntransition from incoherence to collective synchronization is known to occur at\nlarge enough values of the coupling strength. However, here we demonstrate that\nshear diversity cannot be counterbalanced by diffusive coupling leading to\nsynchronization. We present the first analytical results for the Kuramoto model\nwith distributed shear, and show that the onset of collective synchronization\nis impossible if the width of the shear distribution exceeds a precise\nthreshold.\n"]}]
