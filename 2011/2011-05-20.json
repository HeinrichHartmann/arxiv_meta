Results show how the\nstationarity of statistical distributions coexists with a strong and\nnon-trivial evolutionary dynamics at the node and link levels, on all\ntimescales. Traditional static views of the displacement network hide important\npatterns of structural changes affecting nodes' centrality and farms' spreading\npotential, thus limiting the efficiency of interventions based on partial\nlongitudinal information. By fully taking into account the longitudinal\ndimension, we propose a novel definition of dynamical motifs that is able to\nuncover the presence of a temporal arrow describing the evolution of the system\nand the causality patterns of its displacements, shedding light on mechanisms\nthat may play a crucial role in the definition of preventive actions.\n"]}]
