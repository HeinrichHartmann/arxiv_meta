Analysing RV data to determine the\nparameters of the extrasolar planets is a significant statistical challenge\nowing to the presence of multiple planets and various degeneracies between\norbital parameters. Determining the number of planets favoured by the observed\ndata is an even more difficult task. Bayesian model selection provides a\nmathematically rigorous solution to this problem by calculating marginal\nposterior probabilities of models with different number of planets, but the use\nof this method in extrasolar planetary searches has been hampered by the\ncomputational cost of the evaluating Bayesian evidence. Nonetheless, Bayesian\nmodel selection has the potential to improve the interpretation of existing\nobservational data and possibly detect yet undiscovered planets. We present a\nnew and efficient Bayesian method for determining the number of extrasolar\nplanets, as well as for inferring their orbital parameters, without having to\ncalculate directly the Bayesian evidence for models containing a large number\nof planets. Instead, we work iteratively and at each iteration obtain a\nconservative lower limit on the odds ratio for the inclusion of an additional\nplanet into the model. We apply this method to simulated data-sets containing\none and two planets and successfully recover the correct number of planets and\nreliable constraints on the orbital parameters. We also apply our method to RV\nmeasurements of HD 37124, 47 Ursae Majoris and HD 10180. For HD 37124, we\nconfirm that the current data strongly favour a three-planet system. We find\nstrong evidence for the presence of a fourth planet in 47 Ursae Majoris, but\nits orbital period is suspiciously close to one year, casting doubt on its\nvalidity.

This optical flash appears to be distinct from the subsequent emerging\nafterglow emission, for which we present comprehensive broadband radio to X-ray\nlight curves to 13 days post-burst and rigorously test the standard fireball\nmodel. The intrinsic extinction toward GRB 080603A is high (A_V,z = 0.8 mag),\nand the well-sampled X-ray-to-near-infrared spectral energy distribution is\ninteresting in requiring an LMC2 extinction profile, in contrast to the\nmajority of GRBs. Comparison of the gamma-ray and extinction-corrected optical\nflux densities of the flash rules out an inverse-Compton origin for the prompt\ngamma-rays; instead, we suggest that the optical flash could originate from the\ninhomogeneity of the relativistic flow. In this scenario, a large velocity\nirregularity in the flow produces the prompt gamma-rays, followed by a milder\ninternal shock at a larger radius that would cause the optical flash. Flat\ngamma-ray spectra, roughly F propto nu^-0.1, are observed in many GRBs. If the\nflat spectrum extends down to the optical band in GRB 080603A, the optical\nflare could be explained as the low-energy tail of the gamma-ray emission.

In the right context, this information enables the software\nartifacts we produce, the objects and methods, to exhibit much greater\nmalleability. For declaratively typed languages, we can obtain greater software\nmalleability by extending the model of method call so that assurance of a\nmethod's availability can be provided by any non-nullable parameter, not simply\nthe target parameter, and by allowing the method's implementation to reside in\nclasses or objects other than the target..\n  This paper examines the question of whether this hypothetical improvement in\nsoftware malleability is consistent with existing programming practice by\nexamining the question of the extent to which methods in existing software have\nmultiplicities of non-nullable parameters.

StackMC is based on the supervised\nlearning techniques of fitting functions and cross validation. It should reduce\nthe variance of any type of Monte Carlo integral estimate (simple sampling,\nimportance sampling, quasi-Monte Carlo, MCMC, etc.) without adding bias. We\nreport on an extensive set of experiments confirming that the StackMC estimate\nof an integral is more accurate than both the associated unprocessed Monte\nCarlo estimate and an estimate based on a functional fit to the MC samples.\nThese experiments run over a wide variety of integration spaces, numbers of\nsample points, dimensions, and fitting functions. In particular, we apply\nStackMC in estimating the expected value of the fuel burn metric of future\ncommercial aircraft and in estimating sonic boom loudness measures.
