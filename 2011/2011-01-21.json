The first step to reveal its nature is to detect the evolution of\ndark energy or to prove beyond doubt that the cosmological constant is indeed\nconstant. However, in the standard approach to cosmology, the Universe is\ndescribed by the homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann models. Here we show that\nin the perturbed universe (even if perturbations vanish if averaged over\nsufficiently large scales) the distance-redshift relation is not the same as in\nthe unperturbed universe. This has a serious consequence when studying the\nnature of dark energy and, as shown here, can impair the analysis and studies\nof dark energy.

The comparison between linear and non-linear methods shows that\nnon-linear corrections are not negligible. When inhomogeneities are present the\ndistance changes by several percent. To show how this change influences the\nmeasurements of dark energy, ten future observations with 2% uncertainties are\ngenerated. It is shown the using the standard methods (i.e. under the\nassumption of homogeneity) the systematics due to inhomogeneities can distort\nour analysis, and may lead to a conclusion that dark energy evolves when in\nfact it is constant (or vice versa). Therefore, if future observations are\nanalysed only within the homogeneous framework then the impact of\ninhomogeneities (such as voids and superclusters) can be mistaken for evolving\ndark energy.

When a node (referred to as\nthe source) gets a packet to forward, either by detecting an event or from an\nupstream node, it has to wait for its neighbors in a forwarding set (referred\nto as relays) to wake-up. Each of the relays is associated with a random reward\n(e.g., the progress made towards the sink) that is iid. To begin with, the\nsource is uncertain about the number of relays, their wake-up times and the\nreward values, but knows their distributions. At each relay wake-up instant,\nwhen a relay reveals its reward value, the source's problem is to forward the\npacket or to wait for further relays to wake-up. In this setting, we seek to\nminimize the expected waiting time at the source subject to a lower bound on\nthe average reward. In terms of the operations research literature, our work\ncan be considered as a variant of the asset selling problem. We formulate the\nrelay selection problem as a partially observable Markov decision process\n(POMDP), where the unknown state is the number of relays. We begin by\nconsidering the case where the source knows the number of relays. For the\ngeneral case, where the source only knows a pmf on the number of relays, it has\nto maintain a posterior pmf on the number of relays and forward the packet iff\nthe pmf is in an optimum stopping set. We show that the optimum stopping set is\nconvex and obtain inner and outer bounds to this set.
