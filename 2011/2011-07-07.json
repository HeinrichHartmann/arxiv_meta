Turbulent fluxes of angular momentum and heat due to\nrotationally affected convection play a key role in determining differential\nrotation of stars. Here we perform a systematic comparison between Cartesian\nand spherical geometries as a function of the rotation rate. Aims. We extend\nthe earlier studies by using spherical wedges to obtain turbulent angular\nmomentum and heat transport as functions of the rotation rate from stratified\nconvection. We compare results from spherical and Cartesian models in the same\nparameter regime. In particular, we want to clarify whether the sharp\nequatorial profile of the horizontal Reynolds stress found in earlier Cartesian\nmodels is reproduced in spherical models. Methods. We employ direct numerical\nsimulations of turbulent convection. In order to reach as high spatial\nresolution as possible in the spherical runs, we model only parts of the\nlatitude and longitude. The rotational influence, measured by the Coriolis\nnumber, is varied from zero to roughly seven, which is the regime that is\nlikely to be realised in the solar convection zone. Cartesian simulations are\nperformed in overlapping parameter regimes. Results. For slow rotation we find\nthat the radial and latitudinal turbulent angular momentum fluxes are directed\ninward and equatorward, respectively. In the rapid rotation regime the radial\nflux changes sign in contradiction with theory. The latitudinal flux remains\nmostly equatorward and develops a maximum close to the equator. In Cartesian\nsimulations this peak can be explained by the strong `banana cells'. The\nlatitudinal heat flux is mostly equatorward for slow rotation but changes sign\nfor rapid rotation. The rotation profiles vary from anti-solar (slow equator)\nfor slow and intermediate rotation to solar-like (fast equator) for rapid\nrotation.
