Depending on the choice of the values of the model\nguiding parameters,the Universe's expansion is shown to be perpetually\naccelerated, periodic or quasiperiodic with finite number of\ndeceleration/acceleration epochs. We distinguished the models, which can be\ndefinitely characterized by the inflation in the early Universe, by the\nlate-time accelerated expansion and nonsingular behavior in intermediate\nepochs, and classified them with respect to a number of transition points.\nTransition points appear, when the acceleration parameter changes the sign,\nproviding the natural partition of the Universe's history into epochs of\naccelerated and decelerated expansion. The strategy and results of numerical\ncalculations are advocated by the qualitative analysis of the instantaneous\nphase portraits of the dynamic system associated with the key equation for the\ndark energy pressure evolution.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 12 figures, Part II, typos corrected, Fig.4 replaced,\n  references corrected"]}]

Numerical\nsimulations are used to test for the presence and quantitative effect of the\nradiative-dynamic WEIRD feedback mechanism under more realistic conditions.\nComparisons between cases where lifted dust is radiatively active and\nradiatively passive elucidate the importance of the dust radiative forcing on\nthe thermodynamic and kinematic structure of the atmosphere. The WEIRD feedback\nmechanism does operate under realistic conditions, although it can be masked\nand diminished by a variety of other forcing mechanisms. Globally increased\ndust loading is found to accelerate the local winds while simultaneously\ndiminishing the impact of local physiographical forcing. Local enhancements of\ndust produce a thermal and dynamical response that resembles many of the\nessential features seen in the idealized experiments. The development of a warm\ncore low, rotational wind tendencies and convergence boundaries intersecting at\nthe center of the strongest dust storms are consistent with WEIRD. Local and\nregional storms are effective at producing elevated dust layers above the\nboundary layer aided by the radiative forcing of the dust. Ubiquitous and\npersistent thermal circulations associated with topography can also inject dust\ninto the free atmosphere above the planetary boundary layer, but they are less\nefficient than the dust storms. High concentrations of dust in the lowest\nlevels of the atmosphere produce a significant and dramatic heating of the\nground and the near-surface air despite greatly reduced insolation at the\nsurface.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 13 figures"]}]

The\ntechnique uses sequences of magnetograms directly as lower boundary conditions\nto drive the evolution of coronal magnetic fields between successive force-free\nequilibria over long periods of time. It is illustrated by applying it to MDI\nobservations of a decaying active region, NOAA AR 8005. The active region is\nmodeled during a 4 day period around its central meridian passage. Over this\ntime, the dispersal of the active region is dominated by random motions due to\nsmall scale convective cells. Through studying the build up of magnetic energy\nin the model, it is found that such small scale motions may inject anywhere\nfrom $2.5-3 \\times 10^{25}$ erg s$^{-1}$ of free magnetic energy into the\ncoronal field. Most of this energy is stored within the center of the active\nregion in the low corona, below 30 Mm. After 4 days the build-up of free energy\nis 10% that of the corresponding potential field. This energy buildup, is\nsufficient to explain the radiative losses at coronal temperatures within the\nactive region. Small scale convective motions therefore play an integral part\nin the energy balance of the corona.
