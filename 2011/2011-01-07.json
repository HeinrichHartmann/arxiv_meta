In this work, we investigate the structure of the wind of V374Peg\nby means of 3D magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) numerical simulations. For the first\ntime, an observationally derived surface magnetic field map is implemented in\nMHD models of stellar winds for a low mass star. We show that the wind of\nV374Peg deviates greatly from a low-velocity, low-mass-loss rate solar-type\nwind. We find general scaling relations for the terminal velocities, mass-loss\nrates, and spin-down times of highly magnetized M dwarfs. In particular, for\nV374Peg, our models show that terminal velocities across a range of stellar\nlatitudes reach ~(1500-2300) n_{12}^{-1/2} km/s, where n_{12} is the coronal\nwind base density in units of 10^{12} cm^{-3}, while the mass-loss rates are\nabout 4 x 10^{-10} n_{12}^{1/2} Msun/yr. We also evaluate the angular-momentum\nloss of V374Peg, which presents a rotational braking timescale ~28\nn_{12}^{-1/2} Myr. Compared to observationally derived values from period\ndistributions of stars in open clusters, this suggests that V374Peg may have\nlow coronal base densities (< 10^{11} cm^{-3}). We show that the wind ram\npressure of V374Peg is about 5 orders of magnitude larger than for the solar\nwind. Nevertheless, a small planetary magnetic field intensity (~ 0.1G) is able\nto shield a planet orbiting at 1 AU against the erosive effects of the stellar\nwind. However, planets orbiting inside the habitable zone of V374Peg, where the\nwind ram pressure is higher, might be facing a more significant atmospheric\nerosion. In that case, higher planetary magnetic fields of, at least, about\nhalf the magnetic field intensity of Jupiter, are required to protect the\nplanet's atmosphere.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 5 figures, 1 table.

While the social cost is the maximal load over all machines (makespan), the\ncost (disutility) of each player is the completion time of its own job. In the\ngame, players may follow selfish strategies to optimize their cost and\ntherefore their behaviors do not necessarily lead the game to an equilibrium.\nEven in the case there is an equilibrium, its makespan might be much larger\nthan the social optimum, and this inefficiency is measured by the price of\nanarchy -- the worst ratio between the makespan of an equilibrium and the\noptimum. Coordination mechanisms aim to reduce the price of anarchy by\ndesigning scheduling policies that specify how jobs assigned to a same machine\nare to be scheduled. Typically these policies define the schedule according to\nthe processing times as announced by the jobs. One could wonder if there are\npolicies that do not require this knowledge, and still provide a good price of\nanarchy. This would make the processing times be private information and avoid\nthe problem of truthfulness. In this paper we study these so-called\nnon-clairvoyant policies. In particular, we study the RANDOM policy that\nschedules the jobs in a random order without preemption, and the EQUI policy\nthat schedules the jobs in parallel using time-multiplexing, assigning each job\nan equal fraction of CPU time.\n"]}]
