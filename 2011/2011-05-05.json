We observe a comparably strong correlation of\nthe SFR surface density with the molecular gas surface density, but no\nsignificant correlation with the surface density of atomic gas. The\nbest-fitting slope of the Schmidt law varies from N = 1.37 to 1.56, with\nzeropoint and slope that change systematically with the spatial sampling scale.\nWe tentatively attribute these variations to the effects of areal sampling and\naveraging of a nonlinear intrinsic star formation law.

The energy input from an active central\nmassive black hole is invoked to suppress star formation in early-type galaxies\nat later epochs. A major problem is that this process is poorly understood, and\ncompelling observational evidence for its mere existence is still missing. In\nsearch for signatures of AGN feedback, we have compiled a sample of 16,000\nearly-type galaxies in the redshift range 0.05<z<0.1 from the SDSS database.\nKey in our approach is the use of a purely morphological selection criterion\nthrough visual inspection which produces a sample that is not biased against\nrecent star formation and nuclear activity. The objects with emission (~20 per\ncent) are offset from the red sequence and form a well-defined pattern in the\ncolour-mass diagram. Star forming early-types inhabit the blue cloud, while\nearly-types with AGN are located considerably closer to and almost on the red\nsequence. Star formation-AGN composites are found right between these two\nextremes. We further derive galaxy star formation histories using a novel\nmethod that combines multiwavelength photometry from near-UV to near-IR and\nstellar absorption indices. We find that in those objects deviating from the\nred sequence star formation occurred several 100 Myr in the past involving 1-10\nper cent of the total stellar mass. We identify an evolutionary sequence from\nstar formation via nuclear activity to quiescence. This transition process\nlasts about 1 Gyr, and the peak AGN phase occurs roughly half a Gyr after the\nstarburst. The most likely interpretation is that star formation is suppressed\nby nuclear activity in these objects before they settle on the red sequence.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS. 18 pages, 12 figures.

A qubit induces an effective coupling between two externally\npumped cavity modes. Without cavity losses and in the dispersive regime,\nintrinsic Josephson oscillations of photons between the two modes occurs. In\nthis case, contrary to regular Markovian decoherence, the qubit purity shows a\nGaussian decay and recurrence of its coherence. Due to intrinsic\nnon-linearities, both the Josephson oscillations as well as the qubit\nproperties display a rich collapse-revival structure, where, however, the\ncomplexity of the qubit evolution is in some sense stronger. The qubit as a\nmeter of the photon dynamics is considered, and it is shown that qubit\ndephasing, originating for example from non-demolition measurements, results in\nan exponential destruction of the oscillations which manifests the\ncollectiveness of the Josephson effect. Non-selective qubit measurements, on\nthe other hand, render a Zeno effect seen in a slowing down of the Josephson\noscillations. Contrary to dephasing, cavity dissipation results in a Gaussian\ndecay of the scaled Josephson oscillations. Finally, following Ponomarev et al.\n[Phys. Rev.

In such a heterogeneous environment, the role of\ninterference management (IM) becomes of more importance, but technical\nchallenges also increase, since the number of cell-edge users, suffering from\nsevere interference from the neighboring cells, will naturally grow. In order\nto overcome low performance and/or high complexity of existing static and other\ndynamic IM algorithms, we propose a novel low-complex and fully distributed IM\nscheme, called REFIM, in the downlink of heterogeneous multi-cell networks. We\nfirst formulate a general optimization problem that turns out to require\nintractable computation complexity for global optimality. To have a practical\nsolution with low computational and signaling overhead, which is crucial for\nlow-cost small-cell solutions, e.g., femto cells, in REFIM, we decompose it\ninto per-BS problems based on the notion of reference user and reduce feedback\noverhead over backhauls both temporally and spatially.

System noise caused by operational and probe\nperformance variability complicates the interpretation of these data. To\nminimize the distortion of genetic signal by system noise, we have explored the\nlatter in an archive of hybridizations in which no genetic signal is expected.\nThis archive is obtained by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) of a sample\nin one channel to the same sample in the other channel, or 'self-self' data.\nThese self-self hybridizations trap a variety of system noise inherent in\nsample-reference (test) data.

Using this method, 90% of hybridizations\ndisplayed improved signal-to-noise ratios with an average increase of 7.0%, due\nmainly to a reduced median average deviation (MAD).

Despite the wealth of\nwork on modeling the AGN FeII emission and the need to account for it in\nobserved AGN spectra, there is no UV template electronically available to aid\nthis process. The iron template we present is based on HST spectra of the\nNarrow Line Seyfert 1, IZw1. Its intrinsic narrow lines (~900 km/s) and rich\niron spectrum make the template particularly suitable for use with most AGN\nspectra. The iron emission spectrum and the line identifications and\nmeasurements are presented and compared with the work of Laor et al. We\nillustrate the application of the derived FeII and FeIII templates by fitting\nand subtracting the iron emission from UV spectra of four high-z quasars and of\nthe nearby quasar, 3C273. We briefly discuss the small discrepancies between\nthis observed iron emission and the UV template, and compare the template with\npreviously published ones. We discuss the advantages and limitations of the\ntemplates and of the template fitting method. We conclude that the templates\nwork sufficiently well to be a valuable and important tool for eliminating and\nstudying the iron emission in AGNs, at least until accurate theoretical iron\nemission models are developed.

The results\nthus obtained are shown to be more reliable than those of standard techniques\neven when the latter include near-IR colors. The Bayesian formalism developed\nhere can be generalized to deal with a wide range of problems which make use of\nphotometric redshifts. Several applications are outlined, e.g. the estimation\nof individual galaxy characteristics as the metallicity, dust content, etc., or\nthe study of galaxy evolution and the cosmological parameters from large\nmulticolor surveys.

Both strong and\nelectromagnetic correlations are considered.The propagation of particle-hole\ninteractions in the medium plays an important role in determining the neutrino\nmean free paths. The effects due to Pauli-Blocking and density, spin, and\nisospin correlations in the medium significantly reduce the neutrino cross\nsections. Due to the lack of experimental information at high density, these\ncorrelations are necessarily model dependent. For example, spin correlations in\nnonrelativistic models are found to lead to larger suppressions of neutrino\ncross sections compared to those of relativistic models. This is due to the\ntendency of the nonrelativistic models to develop spin instabilities.\nNotwithstanding the above caveats, and the differences between nonrelativistic\nand relativistic approaches such as the spin- and isospin-dependent\ninteractions and the nucleon effective masses, suppressions of order 2--3,\nrelative to the case in which correlations are ignored, are obtained. Neutrino\ninteractions in dense matter are especially important for supernova and early\nneutron star evolution calculations. The effects of correlations for\nprotoneutron star evolution are calculated. Large effects on the internal\nthermodynamic properties of protoneutron stars, such as the temperature, are\nfound. These translate into significant early enhancements in the emitted\nneutrino energies and fluxes, especially after a few seconds.

We\nprovide very accurate fitting formulas for the QNM's, which are valid for black\nholes of any size and charge $Q<Q_{ext}/3$.\n  Electromagnetic and axial perturbations of large black holes are\ncharacterized by the existence of pure-imaginary (purely damped) modes. The\ndamping of these modes tends to infinity as the black hole charge approaches\nthe extremal value; if the corresponding mode amplitude does not tend to zero\nin the same limit, this implies that {\\it extremally charged RN-AdS black holes\nare marginally unstable}. This result is relevant in view of the AdS/CFT\nconjecture, since, according to it, the AdS QNM's give the timescales for\napproach to equilibrium in the corresponding conformal field theory.\n","Comment: 13 papges, 5 figures, Phys.

This has led to several very successful proposals describing particle\nyields over a very wide range of beam energies, reaching from 1 A GeV up to 200\nA GeV, using only one or two parameters. A systematic comparison of these\nproposals is presented here. The conditions of fixed energy per particle,\nbaryon+anti-baryon density, normalized entropy density as well as percolation\nmodel are investigated.

Such locally covariant quantum field theories will be\ndescribed mathematically in terms of covariant functors between the categories,\non one side, of globally hyperbolic spacetimes with isometric embeddings as\nmorphisms and, on the other side, of *-algebras with unital injective\n*-endomorphisms as morphisms. Moreover, locally covariant quantum fields can be\ndescribed in this framework as natural transformations between certain\nfunctors. The usual Haag-Kastler framework of nets of operator-algebras over a\nfixed spacetime background-manifold, together with covariant automorphic\nactions of the isometry-group of the background spacetime, can be re-gained\nfrom this new approach as a special case. Examples of this new approach are\nalso outlined. In case that a locally covariant quantum field theory obeys the\ntime-slice axiom, one can naturally associate to it certain automorphic\nactions, called ``relative Cauchy-evolutions'', which describe the dynamical\nreaction of the quantum field theory to a local change of spacetime background\nmetrics.

The ideal hadron gas model fails to give\na reasonable explanation to the Pb+Pb data sets. We study the possible effects\nof pion enhancement due to different hard-core repulsion for pions and other\nhadrons and strangeness suppression because of incomplete chemical equilibrium.\nEach of these two modifications improves the results. The combined effect of\nthese two mechanisms leads to an extremely good agreement with the data. An\ninterpretation of the obtained results in terms of the possible quark-gluon\nplasma formation at the early stage of the collision is also discussed.\n","Comment: RevTeX 3.1, 12 pages"]}]

This manifests itself in the non-linear dependence of K+ and\nK- yields in $AA$ collisions at 1 -- 2 A.GeV on the number of participants. It\nis shown that this dependence can be quantitatively well described in terms of\na thermal model with a canonical strangeness conservation. The measured\nparticle multiplicity ratios (pi+/p, pi-/pi+, d/p, K+/pi+ and K+/K- but not\neta/pi0) in central Au-Au and Ni-Ni collisions at 0.8 -- 2.0 A.GeV are also\nexplained in the context of a thermal model with a common freeze-out\ntemperature and chemical potential. Including the concept of collective flow a\nconsistent picture of particle energy distributions is derived with the flow\nvelocity being strongly impact-parameter dependent.\n","Comment: revtex, 20 figures"]}]

At next-to-leading\norder, this potential is the sum of renormalized one-pion and two-pion exchange\nand contact interactions. At next-to-next-to-leading order, we have additional\nchiral two-pion exchange with low-energy constants determined from pion-nucleon\nscattering. Alternatively, we consider the \\Delta(1232) as an explicit degree\nof freedom in the effective field theory. The nine parameters related to the\ncontact interactions can be determined by a fit to the np S- and P-waves and\nthe mixing parameter \\epsilon_1 for laboratory energies below 100 MeV. The\npredicted phase shifts and mixing parameters for higher energies and higher\nangular momenta are mostly well described for energies below 300 MeV.

These spin triplet channels\nhave large corrections from graphs with two potential pion exchange which do\nnot vanish in the chiral limit. We compare our results to calculations within\nthe Weinberg approach, and find that in some spin triplet channels the\nsummation of potential pion diagrams seems to be necessary to reproduce the\nobserved phase shifts.
