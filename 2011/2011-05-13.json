Even better,\nTPILU(k) preconditioning produces an answer that is bit-compatible with the\nsequential ILU(k) preconditioning. In terms of performance, the TPILU(k)\npreconditioning is shown to run faster whenever more cores are made available\nto it --- while continuing to be as stable as sequential ILU(k). This is in\ncontrast to some competing methods that may become unstable if the degree of\nthread parallelism is raised too far. Where Block Jacobi ILU(k) fails in an\napplication, it can be replaced by TPILU(k) in order to maintain good\nperformance, while also achieving full stability. As a further optimization,\nTPILU(k) offers an optional level-based incomplete inverse method as a fast\napproximation for the original ILU(k) preconditioned matrix.

Our parameter study explores how the emergent luminosity depends on a\nrange of circumstellar shell masses, velocities, geometries, and wind mass-loss\nrates, as well as variations in the SN mass and energy. We find that the shell\nmass is the most important parameter, in the sense that higher shell masses (or\nhigher ratios of M_shell/M_SN) lead to higher peak luminosities and higher\nefficiencies in converting shock energy into visual light. Lower mass shells\ncan also cause high peak luminosities if the shell is slow or if the SN ejecta\nare very fast, but only for a short time. Sustaining a high luminosity for\ndurations of more than 100 days requires massive circumstellar shells of order\n10 M_sun or more.

Here the benthic lifestyle of the upside down jellyfish (Cassiopea\nspp.) is capitalized upon to explore the fluids dynamics of feeding uncoupled\nfrom swimming. A mathematical model is developed to capture the fundamental\ncharacteristics of the motion of the unique concave bell shape. Given the\nprominence of the oral arms, this structure is included and modeled as a porous\nlayer that perturbs the flow generated by bell contractions. The immersed\nboundary method is used to solve the fluid-structure interaction problem.\nVelocity fields obtained from live organisms using digital particle image\nvelocimetry were used to validate the numerical simulations. Parameter sweeps\nwere used to numerically explore the effects of changes in pulse dynamics and\nthe properties of the oral arms independently. Numerical experiments allow the\nopportunity to examine physical effects and limits within and beyond the\nbiologically relevant range to develop a better understanding of the system.\nThe presence of the prominent oral arm structure in the field of flow increased\nthe flux of new fluid from along the substrate to the bell.

Tight constraints on the main cosmological\nparameters of the MGCDM model are derived by performing a joint likelihood\nanalysis involving the recent supernovae type Ia data, the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) shift parameter and the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs)\nas traced by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) red luminous galaxies.

The intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway of\napoptosis is governed up-stream of mitochondria, by the family of Bcl-2\nproteins, and down-stream of mitochondria, by low-probability events, such as\napoptosome formation, and by feedback circuits involving caspases and inhibitor\nof apoptosis proteins (IAPs), such as XIAP. All these regulatory mechanisms\nensure that cells only commit to death once a threshold of damage has been\nreached and the anti-apoptotic reserve of the cell is overcome. As cancer cells\nare invariably exposed to strong intracellular and extracellular stress\nstimuli, they are particularly reliant on the expression of anti-apoptotic\nproteins. Hence, many cancer cells undergo apoptosis when exposed to agents\nthat inhibit anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 molecules, such as BH3 mimetics, while normal\ncells remain relatively insensitive to single agent treatments with the same\nclass of molecules. Targeting different proteins within the apoptotic network\nwith combinatorial treatment approaches often achieves even greater\nspecificity.

In this paper, we present a quantum scattering circuit that implements\nsuch a measurement for maximally mixed states. The operation of the circuit is\ndemonstrated using liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in chloroform,\nin which the time correlations of a qubit are measured on a probe (ancillary)\nqubit state. The results clearly show a violation region and are in excellent\nagreement with the predictions of quantum mechanics.\n"]}]
