In compressed sensing we are interested in finding the\nsparsest solution to the system of equations A x = y for a given y. In general,\nwhenever the sparsity of x is smaller than half the dimension of y then with\noverwhelming probability over A the sparsest solution is unique and can be\nfound by an exhaustive search over x with an exponential time complexity for\nany y. The recent work of Cand\\'es, Donoho, and Tao shows that minimization of\nthe L_1 norm of x subject to A x = y results in the sparsest solution provided\nthe sparsity of x, say K, is smaller than a certain threshold for a given\nnumber of measurements. Specifically, if the dimension of y approaches the\ndimension of x, the sparsity of x should be K < 0.239 N. Here, we consider the\ncase where x is d-block sparse, i.e., x consists of n = N / d blocks where each\nblock is either a zero vector or a nonzero vector. Instead of L_1-norm\nrelaxation, we consider the following relaxation min x \\| X_1 \\|_2 + \\| X_2\n\\|_2 + ... + \\| X_n \\|_2, subject to A x = y where X_i = (x_{(i-1)d+1},\nx_{(i-1)d+2}, ..., x_{i d}) for i = 1,2, ..., N.

We find that from ultra-faint dwarf spheroidals to giant cluster\nspheroids, dispersion-supported galaxies scatter about a one-dimensional\n\"fundamental curve\" through this MRL space. The weakness of the M1/2-L1/2 slope\non the faint end may imply that potential well depth limits galaxy formation in\nsmall galaxies, while the stronger dependence on L1/2 on the bright end\nsuggests that baryonic physics limits galaxy formation in massive galaxies. The\nmass-radius projection of this curve can be compared to median dark matter halo\nmass profiles of LCDM halos in order to construct a virial mass-luminosity\nrelationship (Mvir-L) for galaxies that spans seven orders of magnitude in\nMvir. Independent of any global abundance or clustering information, we find\nthat (spheroidal) galaxy formation needs to be most efficient in halos of Mvir\n~ 10^12 Msun and to become inefficient above and below this scale.

The beta-divergence is a family of cost\nfunctions parametrized by a single shape parameter beta that takes the\nEuclidean distance, the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Itakura-Saito\ndivergence as special cases (beta = 2,1,0, respectively). The proposed\nalgorithms are based on a surrogate auxiliary function (a local majorization of\nthe criterion function). We first describe a majorization-minimization (MM)\nalgorithm that leads to multiplicative updates, which differ from standard\nheuristic multiplicative updates by a beta-dependent power exponent. The\nmonotonicity of the heuristic algorithm can however be proven for beta in (0,1)\nusing the proposed auxiliary function. Then we introduce the concept of\nmajorization-equalization (ME) algorithm which produces updates that move along\nconstant level sets of the auxiliary function and lead to larger steps than MM.\nSimulations on synthetic and real data illustrate the faster convergence of the\nME approach.

The model qualitatively\nreproduces commonly observed morphologies for primary tumors, and the simulated\npatterns are characterized by its gyration radius, total number of cancer\ncells, and number of cells on tumor periphery. These very distinct\nmorphological patterns follow Gompertz growth curves, but exhibit different\nscaling laws for their surfaces. Also, the simulated tumors incorporate a\nspatial structure composed of a central necrotic core, an inner rim of\nquiescent cells and a narrow outer shell of proliferating cells in agreement\nwith biological data. Finally, our results indicate that the competition for\nnutrients among normal and cancer cells may be a determinant factor in\ngenerating papillary tumor morphology.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures, to appear in PRE"]}]

This is reflected on the linear growth\nwith time of the interface width ($w\\sim t$), in contrast with the KPZ\nuniversality class ($w\\sim t^{1/3}$) observed when the Eden model is grown on\nflat substrates. We propose an extended Eden model, in which the growth\nprobability has a power law dependence with the number of occupied nearest\nneighbors. Large scale simulations ($N\\gtrsim 4\\times 10^9$ particles) were\nused to determine the time evolution of $w$. We found that a suitable choice of\nthe power exponent removes the lattice-induced cluster anisotropy and provides\na growth exponent in very good agreement with the KPZ universality class.

Two types of quark level subprocesses are considered. The\nfirst one goes through the production of virtual photon which converts into\nlepton pair (q qbar --> gamma* --> l+l-) having a continuous energy spectrum of\nthe final lepton pair invariant mass. The other subprocess proceeds through the\nJ/Psi resonance production (p pbar --> J/Psi + X --> l+l- + X) with the\nfollowing decay of J/Psi into a pair of leptons. The distributions of different\nkinematical variables which may be useful for the design of the muon system and\nthe electromagnetic calorimeter of the detector of PANDA experiment at FAIR are\npresented. The analysis of these distribution shows the possibility to measure\nthe proton structure function in a new kinematical region defined by the\ntime-like values of the square of the momentum transferred 1 < Q^2 < 6.25 GeV^2\nand withing a rather wide interval 0.05 < x < 0.7 of Bjorken x-variable. The\nproblems due to the presence of fake leptons that appear from meson decays, as\nwell as due to the background caused by minimum bias events and other QCD\nprocesses, are also discussed. The set of cuts which allows one to separate the\nsignal events with lepton pairs from this kind of background events is\nproposed.\n","Comment: 43 pages, 24 figures, 8 tables.
