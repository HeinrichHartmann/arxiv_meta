They introduced the concept of stability and optimality; and\nproposed the deferred acceptance (DA) algorithm that is proven to lead to a\nstable and optimal solution. This algorithm is simple and computationally\nefficient. Furthermore, in subsequent studies it is shown that the DA algorithm\nis also strategy-proof, which means, when the algorithm is played out as a\nmechanism for matching two sides (e.g. colleges and students), the parties\n(colleges or students) have no incentives to act other than according to their\ntrue preferences. Yet, in practical college admission systems, the DA algorithm\nis often not adopted. Instead, an algorithm known as the Boston Mechanism (BM)\nor its variants are widely adopted. In BM, colleges accept students without\ndeferral (considering other colleges' decisions), which is exactly the opposite\nof Gale-Shapley's DA algorithm. To explain and rationalize this reality, we\nintroduce the notion of reciprocating preference to capture the influence of a\nstudent's interest on a college's decision. This model is inspired by the\nactual mechanism used to match students to universities in Hong Kong. The\nnotion of reciprocating preference defines a class of matching algorithms,\nallowing different degrees of reciprocating preferences by the students and\ncolleges. DA and BM are but two extreme cases (with zero and a hundred percent\nreciprocation) of this set. This model extends the notion of stability and\noptimality as well.

Their reality can be interpreted as\nevidence of supermassive black-hole encounters in a previous aeon, as predicted\nby conformal cyclic cosmology (CCC) [2]. Counter arguments [4-6] pointed out\nthat such circles arise, at similar frequency, also in simulated data using\nWMAP's CMB power spectrum, plus random input. We responded [7] that if such\ncircles contribute to CMB, this influences the power spectrum, enhancing such\ncircles in simulations. We confirm this here, but show that if the theoretical\nLCDM power spectrum is used instead, then the low-variance circles disappear.\nThis is evidence that the LCDM model gives an incomplete explanation of the\nCMB, missing crucial information, which is provided by incorporating\nlow-variance circles of CCC. The excellent agreement between theoretical LCDM\nand observed power spectrum, even for fairly large l-values, does not reveal\nthis discrepancy, of relevance only at larger l-values where agreement is weak.\nWe point out various non-random aspects of the circles, seen both in the true\ndata and in simulations with WMAP power spectrum, but not with the theoretical\nLCDM spectrum. We also show the spatial distribution of concentric circle sets\nto be very non-random in the true WMAP data (perhaps owing to large-scale mass\ninhomogeneities distorting CCC's circle shapes), in complete contrast with\nsimulations with WMAP power spectrum, where such circle sets are much sparser\nand closer to average temperature.

The distribution of fitness effects (DFE) among\nrandom mutations is an essential component of every evolutionary model and a\nmathematical portrait of robustness. Recent experiments on five viral species\nall revealed a characteristic bimodal shaped DFE, featuring peaks at neutrality\nand lethality. However, the phenotypic causes underlying observed fitness\neffects are still unknown, and presumably thought to vary unpredictably from\none mutation to another. By combining population genetics simulations with a\nsimple biophysical protein folding model, we show that protein thermodynamic\nstability accounts for a large fraction of observed mutational effects.

Contrary to neutral network theory, we find that, in\nmutation/selection/drift steady-state, high mutation rates (m) lead to less\nstable proteins and a more dispersed DFE, i.e. less mutational robustness.\nSmall population size (N) also decreases stability and robustness. In our\nmodel, a continuum of non-lethal mutations reduces fitness by \\approx2% on\naverage, while \\approx10-35% of mutations are lethal, depending on N and m.\nCompensatory mutations are common in small populations with high mutation\nrates.

The\nobtained closed-form expression displays that in large networks the PMFPT grows\nwith network order as $N \\ln N$, which is larger than the linear scaling of\nSMFPT to the hub from other nodes. On the other hand, we also address the case\nwith the information sender distributed uniformly among the Koch networks, and\nderive analytically the entire mean first-passage time (EMFPT), namely, the\naverage of MFPTs between all couples of nodes, the leading scaling of which is\nidentical to that of PMFPT. From the obtained results, we present that although\nhub nodes are more efficient for receiving information than other nodes, they\ndisplay a qualitatively similar speed for sending information as non-hub nodes.\nMoreover, we show that the location of information sender has little effect on\nthe transmission efficiency.

Moreover, the minimal norms of the\ninterpolating operators form a sequence whose rate of growth is determined by\nthe transfinite diameter of $K$.\n  In case of the Laplace transforms of measures on $K$, we show that the\ncoefficients of interpolating polynomials stay bounded provided that the\nfrequencies are Fekete points. Finally, we give a sufficient condition for\nmeasures on the unit circle which ensures that the sums of the absolute values\nof the coefficients of interpolating polynomials stay bounded.\n","Comment: 16 pages"]}]

The LOFAR radio telescope is different, and uses tens of thousands of\nfixed, non-movable antennas instead, a novel design that promises\nground-breaking research in astronomy. The antennas observe omnidirectionally,\nand sky sources are observed by signal-processing techniques that combine the\ndata from all antennas.\n  Another new feature of LOFAR is the elaborate use of software to do signal\nprocessing in real time, where traditional telescopes use custom-built\nhardware. The use of software leads to an instrument that is inherently more\nflexible. However, the enormous data rate (198 Gb/s of input data) and\nprocessing requirements compel the use of a supercomputer: we use an IBM Blue\nGene/P.\n  This paper presents a collection of new processing pipelines, collectively\ncalled the beam-forming pipelines, that greatly enhance the functionality of\nthe telescope. Where our first pipeline could only correlate data to create sky\nimages, the new pipelines allow the discovery of unknown pulsars, observations\nof known pulsars, and (in the future), to observe cosmic rays and study\ntransient events. Unlike traditional telescopes, we can observe in hundreds of\ndirections simultaneously. This is useful, for example, to search the sky for\nnew pulsars. The use of software allows us to quickly add new functionality and\nto adapt to new insights that fully exploit the novel features and the power of\nour unique instrument. We also describe our optimisations to use the Blue\nGene/P at very high efficiencies, maximising the effectiveness of the entire\ntelescope. A thorough performance study identifies the limits of our system.\n"]}]

Almost all of this space (the solar wind) can be traversed by fast\nelectrons producing radio emissions at frequencies lower than the terrestrial\nionospheric cutoff, which prevents observation from the ground. To date, radio\nastronomy-capable space missions consist of one or a few satellites, typically\nfar from each other, which measure total power from the radio sources, but\ncannot produce images with useful angular resolution. To produce such images,\nwe require arrays of antennas distributed over many wavelengths (hundreds of\nmeters to kilometers) to permit aperture synthesis imaging. Such arrays could\nbe free-flying arrays of microsatellites or antennas laid out on the lunar\nsurface. In this white paper, we present the lunar option. If such an array\nwere in place by 2020, it would provide context for observations during Solar\nProbe Plus perihelion passes. Studies of the lunar ionosphere's density and\ntime variability are also important goals.
