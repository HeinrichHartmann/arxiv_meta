The first measurement of\na metal abundance in the IGM at a redshift approaching the epoch of\nreionization already offers intriguing hints. Between z=5.8 and 4.7 (a 0.3 Gyr\ninterval only 1 Gyr after the big bang), the measured density of CIV absorbers\nin the IGM increased by a factor of ~ 3.5 (Ryan-Weber et al. 2009; Becker,\nRauch & Sargent 2009). If these values prove to be accurate, they pose two\npuzzles: (1) The total amount of CIV at z=5.8 implies too little star formation\nto reionize the IGM by z=6 or to match the WMAP electron scattering optical\ndepth (tau). (2) The rapid growth from z = 6-5 is faster than the buildup of\nstellar mass or the increase in the star formation rate density over the same\ninterval. We show that a delay of ~ 0.4-0.7 Gyr between the instantaneous\nproduction of ionizing photons and the later production of metal absorption\nfeatures (added to the delay due to stellar lifetimes) can provide the full\nexplanation for both puzzles.

Although intensely\nstudied for decades the interplay of many length scales has prevented a\ncomplete resolution of some of the basic questions such as how the\nelectrostatic persistence length ($l_e$) varies with ionic strength ($I$). In\nthis review we describe certain characteristics of polyelectrolytes (PAs) and\npolyampholytes (PAs), which are polymers whose monomers have a random\ndistribution of opposite charges. After reviewing the current theoretical\nunderstanding of the dependence of $l_e$ on $I$ we present experimental data\nthat conform to two distinct behavior.

A scaling type theory, which delineates charge correlation and\npure polyelectrolyte effects for the shape of PAs that is valid over a wide\nrange of salt concentration is described. We also use theory and simulations to\nargue that the distinct stages in the kinetics of collapse of PAs (with a net\ncharge that is small enough to induce globule formation) and PEs (relevant for\nRNA folding) are similar. In both cases the major initial conformation change\ninvolves formation of metastable pearl-necklace structures. In the coarsening\nprocess large clusters (pearls) grow at the expense of smaller ones by a\nprocess that is reminiscent of Lifshitz-Slyozov mechanism.

Typically, the\nspatial signals are sparse but clustered. This paper provides empirical\nevidence that for a range of commonly used control levels, the conventional\n$\\operatorname {FDR}$ procedure can lack the ability to detect statistical\nsignificance, even if the $p$-values under the true null hypotheses are\nindependent and uniformly distributed; more generally, ignoring the neighboring\ninformation of spatially structured data will tend to diminish the detection\neffectiveness of the $\\operatorname {FDR}$ procedure. This paper first\nintroduces a scalar quantity to characterize the extent to which the \"lack of\nidentification phenomenon\" ($\\operatorname {LIP}$) of the $\\operatorname {FDR}$\nprocedure occurs. Second, we propose a new multiple comparison procedure,\ncalled $\\operatorname {FDR}_L$, to accommodate the spatial information of\nneighboring $p$-values, via a local aggregation of $p$-values. Theoretical\nproperties of the $\\operatorname {FDR}_L$ procedure are investigated under weak\ndependence of $p$-values. It is shown that the $\\operatorname {FDR}_L$\nprocedure alleviates the $\\operatorname {LIP}$ of the $\\operatorname {FDR}$\nprocedure, thus substantially facilitating the selection of more stringent\ncontrol levels.
