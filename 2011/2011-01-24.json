Driven by three\nlasers on TEM00, TEM01, and TEM10 modes, a single cavity can cool a trapped\nnanosphere to the quantum ground states in all three dimensions under the\nresolved-sideband condition. Our scheme can also detect an individual collision\nbetween a single molecule and a cooled nanosphere efficiently. Such ability can\nbe used to measure the mass of molecules and the surface temperature of the\nnanosphere.

In a favorable case, the light of a background star can\nbe subject to stochastic fluctuations on the order of a few percent at a\ncharacteristic time scale of a few minutes. Our ultimate aim is to discover or\nexclude these scintillation effects to estimate the contribution of molecular\nhydrogen to the Galactic baryonic hidden mass. This feasibility study is a\npathfinder toward an observational strategy to search for scintillation,\nprobing the sensitivity of future surveys and estimating the background level.\nMethods: We searched for scintillation induced by molecular gas in visible dark\nnebulae as well as by hypothetical halo clumpuscules of cool molecular hydrogen\n($\\mathrm{H_2-He}$) during two nights. We took long series of 10s infrared\nexposures with the ESO-NTT telescope toward stellar populations located behind\nvisible nebulae and toward the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC).

In\ncontrast, biological systems operate in a highly flexible manner; learn quickly\nadequate responses to novel conditions, and evolve new routines/traits to\nremain competitive under persistent environmental change. A recent theory on\nthe origins of biological flexibility has proposed that degeneracy - the\nexistence of multi-functional components with partially overlapping functions -\nis a primary determinant of the robustness and adaptability found in evolved\nsystems. While degeneracy's contribution to biological flexibility is well\ndocumented, there has been little investigation of degeneracy design principles\nfor achieving flexibility in systems engineering. Actually, the conditions that\ncan lead to degeneracy are routinely eliminated in engineering design.\n  With the planning of transportation vehicle fleets taken as a case study,\nthis paper reports evidence that degeneracy improves robustness and\nadaptability of a simulated fleet without incurring costs to efficiency. We\nfind degeneracy dramatically increases robustness of a fleet to unpredicted\nchanges in the environment while it also facilitates robustness to anticipated\nvariations. When we allow a fleet's architecture to be adapted in response to\nenvironmental change, we find degeneracy can be selectively acquired, leading\nto faster rates of design adaptation and ultimately to better designs.

In this article, a connection between multiple\nchange point detection and variable selection through a proper segmentation of\ndata sequence is established, and a novel approach is proposed to tackle\nmultiple change point detection problem via the following two key steps: (1)\napply the recent advances in consistent variable selection methods such as\nSCAD, adaptive LASSO and MCP to detect change points; (2) employ a refine\nprocedure to improve the accuracy of change point estimation. Five algorithms\nare hence proposed, which can detect change points with much less time and more\naccuracy compared to those in literature. In addition, an optimal segmentation\nalgorithm based on residual sum of squares is given.
