Such a term is related to a\nbackground closed 3-form H on the target space. More exactly, the sigma-model\nFeynman amplitudes of classical fields are associated to a bundle gerbe with\nconnection of curvature H over the target space. Under conditions that were\nunraveled more than twenty years ago, the classical amplitudes may be coupled\nto the topologically trivial gauge fields of the symmetry group in a way which\nassures infinitesimal gauge invariance. We show that the resulting gauged\nWess-Zumino amplitudes may, nevertheless, exhibit global gauge anomalies that\nwe fully classify. The general results are illustrated on the example of the\nWZW and the coset models of conformal field theory. The latter are shown to be\ninconsistent in the presence of global anomalies. We introduce a notion of\nequivariant gerbes that allow an anomaly-free coupling of the Wess-Zumino\namplitudes to all gauge fields, including the ones in non-trivial principal\nbundles. The obstructions to the existence of equivariant gerbes and their\nclassification are discussed. The choice of different equivariant structures on\nthe same bundle gerbe gives rise to a new type of discrete-torsion ambiguities\nin the gauged amplitudes. An explicit construction of gerbes equivariant with\nrespect to the adjoint symmetries over compact simply connected simple Lie\ngroups is given.\n","Comment: 50 pages, 1 figure"]}]

Our measurements indicate that the axisymmetric flows vary\nsystematically over the solar cycle. The differential rotation is weaker at\nmaximum than at minimum. The meridional flow is faster at minimum and slower at\nmaximum. The meridional flow speed on the approach to the Cycle 23/24 minimum\nwas substantially faster than it was at the Cycle 22/23 minimum. The average\nlatitudinal profile is largely a simple sinusoid that extends to the poles and\npeaks at about $35\\degr$ latitude. As the cycle progresses a pattern of\nin-flows toward the sunspot zones develops and moves equatorward in step with\nthe sunspot zones. These in-flows are accompanied by the torsional\noscillations. This association is consistent with the effects of the Coriolis\nforce acting on the in-flows. The equatorward motions associated with these\nin-flows are identified as the source of the decrease in net poleward flow at\ncycle maxima. We also find polar counter-cells (equatorward flow at high\nlatitudes) in the south from 1996 to 2000 and in the north from 2002 to 2010.\nWe show that these measurements of the flows are not affected by the\nnon-axisymmetric diffusive motions produced by supergranulation.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 11 figures"]}]

Launched by blogger Beppe Grillo, and\npromoted via a word of mouth mobilization on the Italian blogosphere, V-day\nbrought close to one million Italians in the streets on a single day, but was\nmostly ignored by mainstream media. This article is divided into two parts. In\nthe first part, we analyze the volume and content of online articles published\nby both bloggers and mainstream news sources from June 14 (the day V-day was\nannounced) until September 15, 2007 (one week after it took place) . We find\nthat the success of V-day can be attributed to the coverage of bloggers and\nsmall-scale local news outlets only, suggesting a strong grassroots component\nin the organization of the rally. We also find a dissonant thematic\nrelationship between content published by blogs and mainstream media: while the\nmajority of blogs analyzed promote V-day, major mainstream media sources\ncritique the methods of information production and dissemination employed by\nGrillo. Based on this finding, in the second part of the study, we explore the\nrole of Grillo in the organization of the rally from a network analysis\nperspective. We study the interlinking structure of the V-day blogosphere\nnetwork, to determine its structure, its levels of heterogeneity, and\nresilience. Our analysis contradicts the hypothesis that Grillo served as a\ntop-down, broadcast-like source of information. Rather, we find that\ninformation about V-day was transferred across heterogeneous nodes in a\nmoderately robust and resilient core network of blogs.

Although\nexpensive, numerical methods can be exploited to obtain the eddy diffusivity,\nfor any desirable non-perturbative limit (e.g. arbitrary Stokes and Froude\nnumbers).

Both asymptotics lead to a greatly simplified\nauxiliary differential problem, now involving only space coordinates and thus\neasy to be tackled by standard numerical techniques. Explicit, exact\nexpressions for the eddy diffusivities have been calculated, for both\nasymptotics, for the class of parallel flows, both static and time-dependent.\nThis allows us to investigate analytically the role of gravity and inertia on\nthe diffusion process by varying relevant features of the carrier flow, as e.g.\nthe form of its temporal correlation function.

Proximity of a limit cycle to one or more saddle equilibria can have a\nprofound effect on the timing of trajectory components and response to both\nfast and slow perturbations, providing a possible mechanism for adaptive\ncontrol of rhythmic motions. Reyn showed that for a planar dynamical system\nwith a stable heteroclinic cycle (or separatrix polygon), small perturbations\nsatisfying a net inflow condition will generically give rise to a stable limit\ncycle (Reyn, 1980; Guckenheimer and Holmes, 1983).

For system (ii), we obtain exact expressions for the limit cycle\nand the iPRC as a function of a parameter, mu>0, representing the distance from\na heteroclinic bifurcation point.
