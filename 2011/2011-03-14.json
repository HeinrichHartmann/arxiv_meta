Here\nwe show how these quantities can be calculated via an extension of Wilson's\nnumerical renormalization group method. Accurate results are obtained in all\nparameter regimes and for the full range of temperatures of interest ranging\nfrom the high temperature perturbative regime $T>>T_{K}$, through the\ncross--over region $T\\approx T_{K}$, and into the low temperature strong\ncoupling regime $T<<T_{K}$. The Fermi liquid relations for the $T^2$\ncoefficient of the resistivity and the linear coefficient of the thermopower\nare satisfied to a high degree of accuracy. The techniques used here provide a\nnew highly accurate approach to strongly correlated electrons in high\ndimensions.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 5 figures.

I will furthermore introduce relevant facts that tend\nnot to receive adequate attention in much of the current Consciousness\ndiscourse. As a new approach to conceptualizing Consciousness, I propose\nconsidering it as a collective achievement of the brain' s complex neural\ndynamics that is amenable to study in the framework of state space dynamics and\ncriticality. In Physics, concepts of phase space transitions and the\nRenormalization Group are powerful tools for interpreting phenomena involving\nmany scales of length and time in complex systems. The significance of these\nconcepts lies in their accounting for the emergence of different levels of new\ncollective behaviors in complex systems, each level with its distinct ontology,\norganization and laws, as a new pattern of reality. The presumption of this\nproposal is that the subjectivity of Consciousness is the epistemic\ninterpretation of a level of reality that originates in phase transitions of\nthe brain-body-environment system.\n"]}]

After incorporating the inverse volume\nmodifications both in the gravitational and matter part in the improved\nframework of LQC, we find that the inverse volume modification can decrease the\nbouncing energy scale, and the presence of nonsingular bounce is generic. For\nthe backward evolution in the expanding branch, in terms of different initial\nstates the evolution trajectories classify into two classes. One class with\nlarger initial energy density leads to the occurrence of bounce in the region\n$a>a_{ch}$ where $a_{ch}$ marks the different inverse volume modification\nregion. The other class with smaller initial energy density evolves back into\nthe region $a<a_{ch}$. In this region, both the energy density for the scalar\nfield and the bouncing energy scale decrease with the backward evolution.\nHowever, in the deep modification region, because of the inverse volume\nmodification the scalar field is frozen, such that the bounce is present when\nthe bouncing energy scale decreases to be equal to the energy density of the\nscalar field. Using numerical method, we show the evolution picture for the\nsecond class bounce.\n","Comment: revised version"]}]
