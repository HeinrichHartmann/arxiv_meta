The\nverification of such properties helps to substantiate the validity of the\nmodel.

For a non-malleable extractor nmExt, the output nmExt(x,y) should appear\nuniform given y as well as nmExt(x,A(y)), where A is an arbitrary function with\nA(y) not equal to y.\n  We show that an extractor introduced by Chor and Goldreich is non-malleable\nwhen the entropy rate is above half. It outputs a linear number of bits when\nthe entropy rate is 1/2 + alpha, for any alpha>0. Previously, no nontrivial\nparameters were known for any non-malleable extractor. To achieve a polynomial\nrunning time when outputting many bits, we rely on a widely-believed conjecture\nabout the distribution of prime numbers in arithmetic progressions. Our\nanalysis involves a character sum estimate, which may be of independent\ninterest.\n  Using our non-malleable extractor, we obtain protocols for \"privacy\namplification\": key agreement between two parties who share a weakly-random\nsecret. Our protocols work in the presence of an active adversary with\nunlimited computational power, and have asymptotically optimal entropy loss.\nWhen the secret has entropy rate greater than 1/2, the protocol follows from a\nresult of Dodis and Wichs, and takes two rounds. When the secret has entropy\nrate delta for any constant delta>0, our new protocol takes a constant\n(polynomial in 1/delta) number of rounds. Our protocols run in polynomial time\nunder the above well-known conjecture about primes.\n","Comment: 32 pages, full version of the same paper in FOCS 2011"]}]

A\ncontroller compares the signal measured by a sensor with the target value. It\nadjusts then an actuator in order to stabilize the signal towards its target.\nGeneralizing this scheme to stabilize a micro-system's quantum state relies on\nquantum feedback, which must overcome a fundamental difficulty: the\nmeasurements by the sensor have a random back-action on the system. An optimal\ncompromise employs weak measurements providing partial information with minimal\nperturbation. The controller should include the effect of this perturbation in\nthe computation of the actuator's unitary operation bringing the incrementally\nperturbed state closer to the target. While some aspects of this scenario have\nbeen experimentally demonstrated for the control of quantum or classical\nmicro-system variables, continuous feedback loop operations permanently\nstabilizing quantum systems around a target state have not yet been realized.\nWe have implemented such a real-time stabilizing quantum feedback scheme. It\nprepares on demand photon number states (Fock states) of a microwave field in a\nsuperconducting cavity and subsequently reverses the effects of\ndecoherence-induced field quantum jumps. The sensor is a beam of atoms crossing\nthe cavity which repeatedly performs weak quantum non-demolition measurements\nof the photon number. The controller is implemented in a real-time computer\ncommanding the injection, between measurements, of adjusted small classical\nfields in the cavity. The microwave field is a quantum oscillator usable as a\nquantum memory or as a quantum bus swapping information between atoms.

These sources are known to show extended radio structure at\nscales of milliarcseconds (mas). Aims. We present the expected extended radio\nemission on mas scales from HESS J0632+057. Methods. We observed HESS J0632+057\nwith the European VLBI Network (EVN) at 1.6 GHz in two epochs: during the\nJanuary/February 2011 X-ray outburst and 30 days later. Results. The VLBI image\nobtained during the outburst shows a compact ~0.4 mJy radio source, whereas 30\ndays later the source has faded and appears extended, with a projected size of\n~75 AU. The peak of the emission is displaced between runs 21+/-5 AU, which is\nbigger than the orbit size. The position of the radio source is compatible with\nthe Be star MWC 148, which sets the proper motion of the binary system below 3\nmas yr^-1 in each coordinate. The brightness temperature of the source is above\n2 \\times 10^6 K. We compare the multiwavelength properties of HESS J0632+057\nwith those of the previously known gamma-ray binaries. Conclusions. HESS\nJ0632+057 displays extended and variable non-thermal radio emission. Its\nmorphology, size, and displacement at AU scales are similar to those found in\nthe other gamma-ray binaries, PSR B1259-63, LS 5039 and LS I +61 303,\nsupporting a similar nature for HESS J0632+057.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 2 figures.

This equation admits two families of gap solitons that bifurcate from\nthe edges of Bloch bands in the linear wave spectrum. These fundamental\nsolitons may be positioned only at specific locations relative to the\npotential; otherwise, they become nonlocal owing to the presence of growing\ntails of exponentially-small amplitude with respect to the wave peak amplitude.\nHere, by matching the tails of such nonlocal solitary waves, higher-order\nlocally confined gap solitons, or bound states, are constructed. Details are\nworked out for bound states comprising two nonlocal solitary waves in the\npresence of a sinusoidal potential. A countable set of bound-state families,\ncharacterized by the separation distance of the two solitary waves, is found,\nand each family features three distinct solution branches that bifurcate near\nBloch-band edges at small, but finite, amplitude. Power curves associated with\nthese solution branches are computed asymptotically for large solitary-wave\nseparation, and the theoretical predictions are consistent with numerical\nresults.\n","Comment: To appear in Proc.
