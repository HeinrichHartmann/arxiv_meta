A widely accepted method to circumvent\nthis problem consists in replacing cpu time expensive computer models by cpu\ninexpensive mathematical functions, called metamodels. In this paper, we focus\non the Gaussian process metamodel and two essential steps of its definition\nphase. First, the initial design of the computer code input variables (which\nallows to fit the metamodel) has to honor adequate space filling properties. We\nadopt a numerical approach to compare the performance of different types of\nspace filling designs, in the class of the optimal Latin hypercube samples, in\nterms of the predictivity of the subsequent fitted metamodel. We conclude that\nsuch samples with minimal wrap-around discrepancy are particularly well-suited\nfor the Gaussian process metamodel fitting. Second, the metamodel validation\nprocess consists in evaluating the metamodel predictivity with respect to the\ninitial computer code. We propose and test an algorithm which optimizes the\ndistance between the validation points and the metamodel learning points in\norder to estimate the true metamodel predictivity with a minimum number of\nvalidation points.

It uses the instantaneous value of the square of the error signal\nas an estimate of the mean-square error (MSE). The LMS algorithm changes\n(adapts) the filter tap weights so that the error signal is minimized in the\nmean square sense. In Trigonometric LMS (TLMS) and Hyperbolic LMS (HLMS), two\nnew versions of LMS algorithms, same formulations are performed as in the LMS\nalgorithm with the exception that filter tap weights are now expressed using\ntrigonometric and hyperbolic formulations, in cases for TLMS and HLMS\nrespectively. Hence appears the CORDIC algorithm as it can efficiently perform\ntrigonometric, hyperbolic, linear and logarithmic functions. While\nhardware-efficient algorithms often exist, the dominance of the software\nsystems has kept those algorithms out of the spotlight. Among these hardware-\nefficient algorithms, CORDIC is an iterative solution for trigonometric and\nother transcendental functions. Former researches worked on CORDIC algorithm to\nobserve the convergence behavior of Trigonometric LMS (TLMS) algorithm and\nobtained a satisfactory result in the context of convergence performance of\nTLMS algorithm. But revious researches directly used the CORDIC block output in\ntheir simulation ignoring the internal step-by-step rotations of the CORDIC\nprocessor. This gives rise to a need for verification of the convergence\nperformance of the TLMS algorithm to investigate if it actually performs\nsatisfactorily if implemented with step-by-step CORDIC rotation. This research\nwork has done this job. It focuses on the internal operations of the CORDIC\nhardware, implements the Trigonometric LMS (TLMS) and Hyperbolic LMS (HLMS)\nalgorithms using actual CORDIC rotations. The obtained simulation results are\nhighly satisfactory and also it shows that convergence behavior of HLMS is much\nbetter than TLMS.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 5 figures, 1 table.

Here we report on a basic theoretical\ninvestigation of the linear polarization produced by scattering processes and\nthe Hanle effect in Ly-a, Ly-b and H-a taking into account multilevel radiative\ntransfer effects in an isothermal stellar atmosphere model, the fine-structure\nof the hydrogen levels, as well as the impact of collisions with electrons and\nprotons. The main aim of this first paper is to elucidate the physical\nmechanisms that control the linear polarization in the three lines, as well as\nits sensitivity to the perturbers density and to the strength and structure of\nmicro-structured and deterministic magnetic fields. To this end, we apply an\nefficient radiative transfer code we have developed for performing numerical\nsimulations of the Hanle effect in multilevel systems with overlapping line\ntransitions. For low density plasmas such as that of the upper solar\nchromosphere collisional depolarization is caused mainly by collisional\ntransitions between the fine-structure levels of n=3, so that it is virtually\ninsignificant for Ly-a but important for Ly-b and H-a. We show the impact of\nthe Hanle effect on the three lines taking into account the radiative transfer\ncoupling between the different hydrogen line transitions. For example, we\ndemonstrate that the linear polarization profile of the H-a line is sensitive\nto the presence of magnetic field gradients in the line core formation region\nand that in solar-like chromospheres selective absorption of polarization\ncomponents does not play any significant role on the emergent scattering\npolarization.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 16 figures, 2 tables, accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]
