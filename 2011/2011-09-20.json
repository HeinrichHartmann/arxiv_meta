This paper explores\nthe class of two-dimensional convolutional codes (2D CCs) and 2D tail-biting\nconvolutional codes (2D TBCCs), in particular, from several aspects. First, we\nderive several basic algebraic properties of these codes, applying algebraic\nmethods in order to find bijective encoders, create parity check matrices and\nto inverse encoders. Next, we discuss the minimum distance and weight\ndistribution properties of these codes. Extending an existing tree-search\nalgorithm to two dimensions, we apply it to find codes with high minimum\ndistance. Word-error probability asymptotes for sample codes are given and\ncompared with other codes. The results of this approach suggest that 2D TBCCs\ncan perform better than comparable 1D TBCCs or other codes. We then present\nseveral novel iterative suboptimal algorithms for soft decoding 2D CCs, which\nare based on belief propagation. Two main approaches to decoding are\nconsidered. We first focus on a decoder which extends the concept of trellis\ndecoding to two dimensions. Second, we investigate algorithms which use the\ncode's parity check matrices. We apply conventional BP in the parity domain,\nbut improve it with a novel modification. Next, we test the generalized belief\npropagation (GBP) algorithm. Performance results are presented and compared\nwith optimum decoding techniques and bounds. The results show that our\nsuboptimal algorithms achieve respectable results, in some cases coming as\nclose as 0.2dB from optimal (maximum-likelihood) decoding. However for some of\nthe codes there is still a large gap from the optimal decoder.\n"]}]

The main objective\nof clustering is to identify suitable node representatives, i.e. cluster heads\n(CHs), to store routing and topology information and maximize clusters\nstability. Traditional clustering algorithms suggest CH election exclusively\nbased on node IDs or location information and involve frequent broadcasting of\ncontrol packets, even when network topology remains unchanged. More recent\nworks take into account additional metrics (such as energy and mobility) and\noptimize initial clustering. However, in many situations (e.g. in relatively\nstatic topologies) re-clustering procedure is hardly ever invoked; hence\ninitially elected CHs soon reach battery exhaustion.

We construct networks consisting of three stages of nodes.\nThe nodes in the first stage are the entry points that act as sources for the\nlive streams. Each source forwards each of its streams to one or more nodes in\nthe second stage that are called reflectors. A reflector can split an incoming\nstream into multiple identical outgoing streams, which are then sent on to\nnodes in the third and final stage that act as sinks and are located in edge\nnetworks near end-users. As the packets in a stream travel from one stage to\nthe next, some of them may be lost. A sink combines the packets from multiple\ninstances of the same stream (by reordering packets and discarding duplicates)\nto form a single instance of the stream with minimal loss. Our primary\ncontribution is an algorithm that constructs an overlay network that provably\nsatisfies capacity and reliability constraints to within a constant factor of\noptimal, and minimizes cost to within a logarithmic factor of optimal. Further\nin the common case where only the transmission costs are minimized, we show\nthat our algorithm produces a solution that has cost within a factor of 2 of\noptimal.
