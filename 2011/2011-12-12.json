While the task in Cluster Vertex Deletion is to delete vertices\nfrom a graph so that its connected components become cliques, the task in\ns-Plex Cluster Vertex Deletion is to delete vertices from a graph so that its\nconnected components become s-plexes. An s-plex is a graph in which every\nvertex is nonadjacent to at most s-1 other vertices; a clique is an 1-plex. In\ncontrast to Cluster Vertex Deletion, s-Plex Cluster Vertex Deletion allows to\nbalance the number of vertex deletions against the sizes and the density of the\nresulting clusters, which are s-plexes instead of cliques. The focus of this\nwork is the development of provably efficient and effective data reduction\nrules for s-Plex Cluster Vertex Deletion. In terms of fixed-parameter\nalgorithmics, these yield a so-called problem kernel. A similar problem, s-Plex\nEditing, where the task is the insertion or the deletion of edges so that the\nconnected components of a graph become s-plexes, has also been studied in terms\nof fixed-parameter algorithmics. Using the number of allowed graph\nmodifications as parameter, we expect typical parameter values for s-Plex\nCluster Vertex Deletion to be significantly lower than for s-Plex Editing,\nbecause one vertex deletion can lead to a high number of edge deletions.

The definition of Hybrid MKNF is parametric on the description\nlogic (DL) underlying the ontology language, in the sense that non-monotonic\nrules can extend any decidable DL language. Two related semantics have been\ndefined for Hybrid MKNF: one that is based on the Stable Model Semantics for\nlogic programs and one on the Well-Founded Semantics (WFS). Under WFS, the\ndefinition of Hybrid MKNF relies on a bottom-up computation that has polynomial\ndata complexity whenever the DL language is tractable. Here we define a general\nquery-driven procedure for Hybrid MKNF that is sound with respect to the stable\nmodel-based semantics, and sound and complete with respect to its WFS variant.\nThis procedure is able to answer a slightly restricted form of conjunctive\nqueries, and is based on tabled rule evaluation extended with an external\noracle that captures reasoning within the ontology. Such an (abstract) oracle\nreceives as input a query along with knowledge already derived, and replies\nwith a (possibly empty) set of atoms, defined in the rules, whose truth would\nsuffice to prove the initial query. With appropriate assumptions on the\ncomplexity of the abstract oracle, the general procedure maintains the data\ncomplexity of the WFS for Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases.\n  To illustrate this approach, we provide a concrete oracle for EL+, a fragment\nof the light-weight DL EL++. Such an oracle has practical use, as EL++ is the\nlanguage underlying OWL 2 EL, which is part of the W3C recommendations for the\nSemantic Web, and is tractable for reasoning tasks such as subsumption.

An essay on the close relationship between\n  speciation, inbreeding and recessive mutations"],"description":["  Background: Speciation corresponds to the progressive establishment of\nreproductive barriers between groups of individuals derived from an ancestral\nstock. Since Darwin did not believe that reproductive barriers could be\nselected for, he proposed that most events of speciation would occur through a\nprocess of separation and divergence, and this point of view is still shared by\nmost evolutionary biologists today. Results: I do, however, contend that, if so\nmuch speciation occurs, the most likely explanation is that there must be\nconditions where reproductive barriers can be directly selected for. In other\nwords, situations where it is advantageous for individuals to reproduce\npreferentially within a small group and reduce their breeding with the rest of\nthe ancestral population. This leads me to propose a model whereby new species\narise not by populations splitting into separate branches, but by small\ninbreeding groups \"budding\" from an ancestral stock. This would be driven by\nseveral advantages of inbreeding, and mainly by advantageous recessive\nphenotypes, which could only be retained in the context of inbreeding.\nReproductive barriers would thus not arise as secondary consequences of\ndivergent evolution in populations isolated from one another, but under the\ndirect selective pressure of ancestral stocks. Many documented cases of\nspeciation in natural populations appear to fit the model proposed, with more\nspeciation occurring in populations with high inbreeding coefficients, and many\nrecessive characters identified as central to the phenomenon of speciation,\nwith these recessive mutations expected to be surrounded by patterns of limited\ngenomic diversity. Conclusions: Whilst adaptive evolution would correspond to\ngains of function that would, most of the time, be dominant, this type of\nspeciation by budding would thus be driven by mutations resulting in the\nadvantageous loss of certain functions since recessive mutations very often\ncorrespond to the inactivation of a gene. A very important further advantage of\ninbreeding is that it reduces the accumulation of recessive mutations in\ngenomes. A consequence of the model proposed is that the existence of species\nwould correspond to a metastable equilibrium between inbreeding and\noutbreeding, with excessive inbreeding promoting speciation, and excessive\noutbreeding resulting in irreversible accumulation of recessive mutations that\ncould ultimately only lead to extinction.\n","Comment: 52 pages"]}]

For finite values of the angle of rotation or the\nboost's velocity, collectively denoted by V, the existence of an exponential\nexpansion for the coordinate transformation's matrix, M (in terms of GV where G\nis the generator) requires that the matrix's derivative with respect to V, be\nequal to GM.

This is a factor of about 4 higher than the same\nratio measured towards the central regions of non-active Galaxies in the\nSpitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS). Thus the environment of these\ntranslucent clouds is more efficient at producing rotationally excited H2 per\nPAH-exciting photon than the disks of entire galaxies. Excitation analysis\nfinds that the S(1) and S(2) emitting regions are warm (T >300K), but comprise\nno more than 2% of the gas mass. We find that UV photons cannot be the sole\nsource of excitation in these regions and suggest mechanical heating via shocks\nor turbulent dissipation as the dominant cause of the emission. The clouds are\nlocated on the outskirts of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association and may be\ndissipating recent bursts of mechanical energy input from supernova explosions.\nWe suggest that pockets of warm gas in diffuse or translucent clouds,\nintegrated over the disks of galaxies, may represent a major source of all\nnon-active galaxy H2 emission.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 5 figures.

If temperature, density and pressure of such undisturbed\natmosphere do not depend on latitude and longitude then the internal waves are\nharmonic with apriori unknown eigenfrequencies, the problem permits separation\nof variables and reduces to the system of two ODE's. The first ODE (the\nLaplace's tidal equation) is analyzed by author earlier. The second ODE\ndetermines the vertical structure of the waves to be considered and has\nanalytical solution for polytropic atmospheres. There are 6 dimensionless\nnumbers, 2 for the Laplace's tidal equation and 4 for the vertical structure\nequation. The solution is a countable set of the eigenfrequencies and\neigenfunctions of the vertical structure equation; every\neigenfrequency/eigenfunction corresponds to its own countable set of the\neigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the Laplace's tidal equation. Parametric\nanalysis of the problem has been done. It shows that there exists the solution\nweakly depending on altitude-temperature variations and the atmosphere's height\nfor parameters modelling the Earth's troposphere (with the \"rigid lid\" between\nthe troposphere and the tropopause).

However, when it comes to the composition of the observed\nplanets the data are compatible with several interior structure models. Thus, a\nplanetary parameter sensitive to the planet's density distribution could help\nconstrain this large number of possible models even further. We aim to\ninvestigate to what extent an exoplanet's interior can be constrained in terms\nof core mass and envelope metallicity by taking the tidal Love number k_2 into\naccount as an additional possibly observable parameter. Because it is the only\nplanet with an observationally determined k_2, we constructed interior models\nfor the Hot Jupiter exoplanet HAT-P-13b by solving the equations of hydrostatic\nequilibrium and mass conservation for different boundary conditions. In\nparticular, we varied the surface temperature and the outer temperature\nprofile, as well as the envelope metallicity within the widest possible\nparameter range. We also considered atmospheric conditions that are consistent\nwith nongray atmosphere models. For all these models we calculated the Love\nnumber k_2 and compared it to the allowed range of k_2 values that could be\nobtained from eccentricity measurements of HAT-P-13b. We use the example of\nHAT-P-13b to show the general relationships between the quantities temperature,\nenvelope metallicity, core mass, and Love number of a planet. For any given k_2\nvalue a maximum possible core mass can be determined. For HAT-P-13b we find\nMcore < 27 ME, based on the latest eccentricity measurement. We are able to\nconstrain both the envelope and bulk metallicity of HAT-P-13b to 1 -- 11 times\nstellar metallicity and the extension of the isothermal layer in the planet's\natmosphere to 3 -- 44 bar. Assuming equilibrium tidal theory, we find lower\nlimits on the tidal Q consistent with 10^3 - 10^5.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures A&A, accepted"]}]

Findings: Numerical results comparing the convergence and the\neffectivity index of both techniques with those obtained without the enrichment\nenhancement clearly show the need for the use of extended recovery techniques\nin Zienkiewicz-Zhu type error estimators for this class of problems.

When the number of interacting agents is in the\norder of the system itself, it is possible to decouple the model. We provide\nsome exact results on the distributions.
