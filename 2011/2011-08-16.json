This\narticle presents a general mathematical framework to efficiently allocate the\navailable computational resources to process the parts of the input that are\nrelevant to solve a given perceptual problem. By this we mean to find the\nhypothesis H (i.e., the state of the world) that maximizes a function L(H),\nrepresenting how well each hypothesis \"explains\" the input. Given the large\nbandwidth of the sensory input, fully evaluating L(H) for each hypothesis H is\ncomputationally infeasible (e.g., because it would imply checking a large\nnumber of pixels). To address this problem we propose a mathematical framework\nwith two key ingredients. The first one is a Bounding Mechanism (BM) to compute\nlower and upper bounds of L(H), for a given computational budget. These bounds\nare much cheaper to compute than L(H) itself, can be refined at any time by\nincreasing the budget allocated to a hypothesis, and are frequently enough to\ndiscard a hypothesis. To compute these bounds, we develop a novel theory of\nshapes and shape priors. The second ingredient is a Focus of Attention\nMechanism (FoAM) to select which hypothesis' bounds should be refined next,\nwith the goal of discarding non-optimal hypotheses with the least amount of\ncomputation. The proposed framework: 1) is very efficient since most hypotheses\nare discarded with minimal computation; 2) is parallelizable; 3) is guaranteed\nto find the globally optimal hypothesis; and 4) its running time depends on the\nproblem at hand, not on the bandwidth of the input.

The output is a set of multigrams (substrings) which\ncan be used as keys to records which satisfy the query workload.

TiO2(B) was included due to experimental\nresults where it appears as a metastable phase during thermal annealing of low\ncontent sodium layered titanate nanostructures obtained via hydrothermal\nsynthesis. Band gaps and surface energies are discussed confronting results\nobtained by Plane Waves (PW) and Localized Basis Set methods (LCNAO), observing\nan excellent agreement between both methodologies when considering floating\nbasis to calculate surfaces energies using LCAO. The computed formation energy\nfor the TiO2(B) (001) slab, as has been previously reported by Vittadini A. et\nal., J. Phys. Chem. C 2009, 113 (44), 18973-18977, is in the order of the one\ncalculated for anatasa (101) which represents one of the most stable TiO2\nsurfaces. The adsorption of formic acid on (001) and (100) - less stable -\nTiO2(B) dry facets was investigated as the first step for further evaluation of\nTiO2(B) nanostructures for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC) applications. The\nresults show that the bidentate dissociated configuration is the most stable\nfor both surfaces being the computed adsorption energy 0.76 eV and 1.35 eV for\n(001) and (100) respectively. These results differ from what was previously\nfound for dry anatasa (101) where monodentate coordination prevails.

The results confirm our prior work that, compared with the VW hashing\nalgorithm (which has the same variance as random projections), b-bit minwise\nhashing is substantially more accurate at the same storage. For example, with\nmerely 30 hashed values per data point, b-bit minwise hashing can achieve\nsimilar accuracies as VW with 2^14 hashed values per data point.\n  We demonstrate that the preprocessing cost of b-bit minwise hashing is\nroughly on the same order of magnitude as the data loading time.

One reason for its popularity is that one can efficiently simulate\npermutations by (e.g.,) universal hashing. In other words, there is no need to\nstore the permutation matrix.
