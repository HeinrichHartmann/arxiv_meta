The first two topics are dynamical\nthreshold enhancements in Drell-Yan and resummation of higgs production at the\nLHC. Both topics center on the resummation of large Sudakov logarithms,\nhowever, for each there is a twist. In the case of threshold enhancements in\nDrell-Yan, it is partonic, not hadronic logarithms that are summed. In the case\nof higgs production at the LHC, the twist is that the logarithms are of a\ntime-like scale. The third topic highlighted is electroweak corrections at high\nenergy. In particular the electroweak Sudakov form factor.

A\nprominent example observed in atomic three-level-systems is the phenomenon of\nelectromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), in which a control laser\ninduces a narrow spectral transparency window for a weak probe laser beam. The\nconcomitant rapid variation of the refractive index in this spectral window can\ngive rise to dramatic reduction of the group velocity of a propagating pulse of\nprobe light. Dynamic control of EIT via the control laser enables even a\ncomplete stop, that is, storage, of probe light pulses in the atomic medium.\nHere, we demonstrate optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT)--formally\nequivalent to EIT--in a cavity optomechanical system operating in the resolved\nsideband regime. A control laser tuned to the lower motional sideband of the\ncavity resonance induces a dipole-like interaction of optical and mechanical\ndegrees of freedom. Under these conditions, the destructive interference of\nexcitation pathways for an intracavity probe field gives rise to a window of\ntransparency when a two-photon resonance condition is met.

We present that this difficulty originates in the difference between the\nrotational response of a nucleon system and that of the corresponding boson\nsystem, and could arise even if the PESs of the two systems were identical.

In this\npaper, we study the performance guarantee of one such scheduling algorithm, the\nLongest-Queue-First (LQF) algorithm. It is known that the LQF algorithm\nachieves the full capacity region, $\\Lambda$, when the interference graph\nsatisfies the so-called local pooling condition. For a general graph $G$, LQF\nachieves (i.e., stabilizes) a part of the capacity region, $\\sigma^*(G)\n\\Lambda$, where $\\sigma^*(G)$ is the overall local pooling factor of the\ninterference graph $G$ and $\\sigma^*(G) \\leq 1$.

The contribution of this paper is to describe three new\nachievable rate regions, which are larger than the previously-known regions. In\nparticular, the new regions include all the extreme points of the capacity\nregion and are not convex in general.

We apply\noptical, charge carrier extraction, morphology, and spin-sensitive techniques.\nIn blends containing Lu3N@C80-PCBEH, we found 2 times weaker photoluminescence\nquenching, remainders of interchain excitons, and, most remarkably, triplet\nexcitons formed on the polymer chain, which were absent in the reference\nP3HT:PC61BM blends.

The cos(\\theta_GC)\ndistribution expected from the Dark Matter Halo model fits the data as well as\nan isotropic distribution above 2 x 10^19eV and 4 x 10^19eV, but is a poorer\nfit than isotropy above 10^19eV.

In other words, all test particles travel on five-dimensional geodesics\nbut observers, who are bounded to spacetime, have access only to the 4D part of\nthe trajectory. Conventionally, the dynamics of test particles as observed in\n4D is discussed on the basis of the splitting of the geodesic equation in 5D.\nHowever, this procedure is {\\em not} unique and therefore leads to some\nproblems. The most serious one is the ambiguity in the definition of rest mass\nin 4D, which is crucial for the discussion of the dynamics. We propose the\nHamilton-Jacobi formalism, instead of the geodesic one, to study the dynamics\nin 4D. On the basis of this formalism we provide an unambiguous expression for\nthe rest mass and its variation along the motion as observed in 4D. It is\nindependent of the coordinates and any parameterization used along the motion.\nAlso, we are able to show a comprehensive picture of the various physical\nscenarios allowed in 4D, without having to deal with the subtle details of the\nsplitting formalism. Moreover we study the extra non-gravitational forces\nperceived by an observer in 4D who describes the geodesic motion of a bulk test\nparticle in 5D. Firstly, we show that the so-called fifth force fails to\naccount for the variation of rest mass along the particle's worldline.\nSecondly, we offer here a new definition that correctly takes into account the\nchange of mass observed in 4D.\n","Comment: The same article, just references updated.

We conclude that, independent of the details of the\nscalar-field theory describing the varying `constant', the condition for its\ncosmological variations to be measured locally is almost always satisfied in\nphysically realistic situations. The very small differences expected to be\nobserved between different scales are quantified. This strengthens the proof\ngiven in our previous paper that local experiments see global variations by\ndropping the requirement of exact spherical symmetry. It provides a rigorous\njustification for using terrestrial experiments and solar system observations\nto constraint or detect any cosmological time variations in the traditional\n`constants' of Nature in the case where non-spherical inhomogeneities exist.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 1 figure"]}]

The\ndefinition gives a systematized picture of hierarchy in the asymptotic\nstructure, which was not clear in the previous works. It is found that if the\nenergy-momentum tensor falls off at a rate faster than $\\sim t^{-2}$, the\nspacetime is asymptotically flat and asymptotically stationary in the sense\nthat the Lie derivative of the metric with respect to $\\ppp_t$ falls off at the\nrate $\\sim t^{-2}$. It also admits an asymptotic symmetry group similar to the\nPoincar\\'e group. If the energy-momentum tensor falls off at a rate faster than\n$\\sim t^{-3}$, the four-momentum of a spacetime may be defined. On the other\nhand, angular momentum is defined only for spacetimes in which the\nenergy-momentum tensor falls off at a rate faster than $\\sim t^{-4}$.\n","Comment: 19 pages, LaTex, the final version to appear in J.

Thus, for g^2 larger than this critical value, the Hamiltonian of the\nLee model becomes non-Hermitian.

It has always been assumed that in this ghost regime the\nLee model is an unacceptable quantum theory because unitarity appears to be\nviolated. However, in this regime while the Hamiltonian is not Hermitian, it\ndoes possess PT symmetry. It has recently been discovered that a non-Hermitian\nHamiltonian having PT symmetry may define a quantum theory that is unitary. The\nproof of unitarity requires the construction of a new time-independent operator\ncalled C.

The noncommutative algebras $\\Ac=C^{\\ify}\n(S^{4}_{\\theta})$ of functions on NC-spheres are solutions to the vanishing, $\n{\\rm ch}_j (e) = 0, j < 2 $, of the Chern character in the cyclic homology of\n$\\Ac$ of an idempotent $e \\in M_4 (\\Ac), e^2 = e, e = e^*$. The universal\nnoncommutative space defined by this equation is a noncommutative Grassmanian\ndefined by very non trivial cubic relations. This space ${\\rm Gr}$ contains the\nsuspension of a NC-3-sphere intimately related to quantum group deformations\n${\\rm SU}_q (2)$ of ${\\rm SU} (2)$ but for unusual values (complex values of\nmodulus one) of the parameter $q$ of $q$-analogues, $q=\\exp (2\\pi i \\t)$. We\nthen construct the noncommutative geometry of $S_{\\t}^4$ as given by a spectral\ntriple $(\\Ac, \\Hc, D)$ and check all axioms of noncommutative manifolds. The\nDirac operator $D$ on the noncommutative 4-spheres $S_{\\t}^4$ gives a solution\nto the basic quartic equation defining the `volume form' $ < (e - {1/2})\n[D,e]^4 > = \\g_5$, where $<$ is the projection on the commutant of $4 \\ts 4$\nmatrices.

The incident momenta varied from 5.9 to 14.4 GeV/c,\ncorresponding to 4.8 < Q^2 < 12.7 (GeV/c)^2. First, we describe the\nmeasurements with the newer experiment, E850, which had more complete kinematic\ndefinition of quasielastic events. In E850 the angular dependence of the\nnuclear transparency near 90 Deg. c.m., and the nuclear transparency for\ndeuterons was studied. Second, we review the techniques used in an earlier\nexperiment, E834, and show that the two experiments are consistent for the\nCarbon data. E834 also determines the nuclear transparencies for Li, Al, Cu,\nand Pb nuclei as well as for C. We find for both E850 and E834 that the A(p,2p)\nnuclear transparency, unlike that for A(e,e'p) nuclear transparency, is\nincompatible with a constant value versus energy as predicted by Glauber\ncalculations. The A(p,2p) nuclear transparency for C and Al increases by a\nfactor of two between 5.9 and 9.5 GeV/c incident proton momentum. At its peak\nthe A(p,2p) nuclear transparency is about 80% of the constant A(e,e'p) nuclear\ntransparency. Then the nuclear transparency falls back to the Glauber level\nagain. This oscillating behavior is generally interpreted as an interplay\nbetween two components of the pN scattering amplitude; one short ranged and\nperturbative, and the other long ranged and strongly absorbed in the nuclear\nmedium.

These two well-known effects\narise from the interaction between a moving atom or detector with a quantum\nfield under some boundary conditions introduced by a conducting mirror/cavity\nor dielectric wall. The Casimir-Polder force is a retardation force on the atom\ndue to the dressing of the atomic ground state by the vacuum electromagnetic\nfield in the presence of a conducting mirror or dielectric wall. We have\nrecently provided an improved calculation by treating the mutual influence of\nthe atom and the (constrained) field in a self-consistent way.

The spectrum of the conditional operator characterizing a\nquantum bipartite system is invariant under local unitary transformations and\nreflects its inseparability. More specifically, it is shown that the\nconditional amplitude operator of a separable state cannot have an eigenvalue\nexceeding 1, which results in a necessary condition for separability. This\nleads us to consider a related separability criterion based on the positive map\n$\\Gamma:\\rho \\to (Tr \\rho) - \\rho$, where $\\rho$ is an Hermitian operator. Any\nseparable state is mapped by the tensor product of this map and the identity\ninto a non-negative operator, which provides a simple necessary condition for\nseparability.
