The purpose of this\npaper is to formalize this derived functor analogy. We show that the\nlocalization ${Def}^{-1}\\Cal{PA}$ of the category $\\Cal{PA}$ of countable\npro-algebras at the class of (infinitesimal) deformations exists (in any\ncharacteristic) (Theorem 3.2) and that, in characteristic zero, periodic cyclic\nhomology is the derived functor of de Rham cohomology with respect to this\nlocalization (Corollary 5.4). We also compute the derived functor of rational\n$K$-theory for algebras over $\\Bbb Q$, which we show is essentially the fiber\nof the Chern character to negative cyclic homology (Theorem 6.2).\n","Comment: 22 pages, AmsTex, uses xy.tex for commutative diagrams"]}]

The latter are noncommutative nilpotent\nthickenings of commutative schemes. We consider also the parallel theory of\nnil-Poisson or $NP$-schemes, which are nilpotent thickenings of commutative\nschemes in the category of Poisson schemes. We study several variants of de\nRham cohomology for $NC$- and $NP$-schemes. The variants include nilcommutative\nand nil-Poisson versions of the de Rham complex as well as of the cohomology of\nthe infinitesimal site introduced by Grothendieck. It turns out that each of\nthese noncommutative variants admits a kind of Hodge decomposition which allows\none to express the cohomology groups of a noncommutative scheme $Y$ as a sum of\ncopies of the usual (de Rham, infinitesimal) cohomology groups of the\nunderlying commutative scheme $X$ (Theorems 6.2, 6.5, 6.8). As a byproduct we\nobtain new proofs for classical results of Grothendieck (Corollary 6.3) and of\nFeigin-Tsygan (Corollary 6.9) on the relation between de Rham and infinitesimal\ncohomology and between the latter and periodic cyclic homology.\n","Comment: 38 pages, uses xy.tex for diagrams"]}]
