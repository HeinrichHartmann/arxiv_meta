The spectra of three stars are fitted with a radiative transfer\nmodel. We find that mass-loss rates of these three stars are 4-7x10^-6 Msun\nyr-1. The other two stars have mass-loss rates below 1.3x10^-6 Msun yr-1. We\nfind no evidence that these rates depend on metallicity, although we do suggest\nthat the gas-to-dust ratio could be higher than at solar metallicity, in the\nrange 240 to 800. The C2H2 bands are stronger at lower metallicity because of\nthe higher C/O ratio. In contrast, the SiC fraction is reduced at low\nmetallicity, due to low silicon abundance. The total mass-loss rate from all\nknown carbon-rich AGB stars into the interstellar medium of this galaxy is of\nthe order of 2x10^-5 Msun yr-1. This is much lower than that of the dwarf\nirregular galaxy WLM, which has a similar visual luminosity and metallicity.\nThe difference is attributed to the younger stellar population of WLM.

Through\nEMMI/NTT multi-object spectroscopy we verify the initial shear-selected cluster\ncandidates. Using weak lensing we obtain mass estimates for the supercluster\ncentre and the filaments.\n  Results: We identified the centre of the SCL2243-0935 supercluster, MACS\nJ2243-0935, which was found independently by Ebeling et al. (2010). 13 more\nclusters or overdensities are embedded in a filamentary network, half of them\nare already spectroscopically confirmed. Three (5-15) Mpc filaments are\ndetected, and we estimate the global size of SCL2243 to 45x15x50 Mpc, making it\none of the largest superclusters known at intermediate redshifts. Weak lensing\nyields r_200=(2.06+/-0.13) Mpc and M_200=(1.54+/-0.29)x10^15 M_sun for MACS\nJ2243 with M/L=428+/-82, very similar to results from size-richness cluster\nscaling relations. Integrating the weak lensing surface mass density over the\nsupercluster network (defined by increased i-band luminosity or g-i colours),\nwe find (1.53+/-1.01)x10^15 M_sun and M/L=305+/-201 for the three main\nfilaments, consistant with theoretical predictions.

Lower energy\nextra-galactic cosmic rays (~10^18-10^19 eV) can only travel a linear distance\nsmaller than ~Gpc in a Hubble time due to the diffusion if the extra-galactic\nmagnetic fields are as strong as nano Gauss. These prevent us from directly\nobserving most of the UHECRs in the universe, and thus the observed UHECR\nintensity reflects only the emissivity in the nearby universe within hundreds\nof Mpc.

This secondary\ncascade radiation forms part of the extragalactic diffuse GeV-TeV gamma-ray\nradiation and, unlike the original UHECRs, is observable. Motivated by new\nmeasurements of extragalactic diffuse gamma-ray background radiation by\nFermi/LAT, we obtained upper limits placed on the UHECR emissivity in the\ndistant universe by requiring that the cascade radiation they produce not\nexceed the observed levels.

Intuitively, games that are \"close\" to a\npotential game should share similar properties. In this paper, we formalize and\ndevelop this idea by quantifying to what extent the dynamic features of\npotential games extend to \"near-potential\" games. We study convergence of three\ncommonly studied classes of adaptive dynamics: discrete-time better/best\nresponse, logit response, and discrete-time fictitious play dynamics. For\nbetter/best response dynamics, we focus on the evolution of the sequence of\npure strategy profiles and show that this sequence converges to a (pure)\napproximate equilibrium set, whose size is a function of the \"distance\" from a\nclose potential game. We then study logit response dynamics and provide a\ncharacterization of the stationary distribution of this update rule in terms of\nthe distance of the game from a close potential game and the corresponding\npotential function. We further show that the stochastically stable strategy\nprofiles are pure approximate equilibria. Finally, we turn attention to\nfictitious play, and establish that the sequence of empirical frequencies of\nplayer actions converges to a neighborhood of (mixed) equilibria of the game,\nwhere the size of the neighborhood increases with distance of the game to a\npotential game. Thus, our results suggest that games that are close to a\npotential game inherit the dynamical properties of potential games. Since a\nclose potential game to a given game can be found by solving a convex\noptimization problem, our approach also provides a systematic framework for\nstudying convergence behavior of adaptive learning dynamics in arbitrary finite\nstrategic form games.\n","Comment: 42 pages, 8 figures"]}]

Furthermore, there are different and contradictionary reports on the\nefficacy of symmetry breaking. By using a novel viewpoint, we offer a possible\nexplanation for this issue. As a result, we show that a strategy which is\ninvariant to the global optimum can only be successfull on certain problems,\nwhereas it must fail to improve the global convergence on others. We introduce\nthe \\emph{Minimum Global Optimum Proximity} principle as a generalized and\nadaptive strategy to symmetry breaking, which depends on the location of the\nglobal optimum. We apply the proposed principle to Differential Evolution (DE)\nand Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategies (CMA-ES), which are two\npopular and conceptually different global optimization methods.
