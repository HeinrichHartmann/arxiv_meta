However,\nmeasurement of the linear resistance of these nanowires have been inconclusive\nin determining the low-temperature behavior of phase-slip fluctuations, both\nquantal and thermal. Thus, we are motivated to study the nonlinear\ncurrent-voltage characteristics in current-biased nanowires and the stochastic\ndynamics of superconductive-resistive switching, as a way of probing phase-slip\nevents. In particular, we address the question: Can a single phase-slip event\noccurring somewhere along the wire--during which the order-parameter fluctuates\nto zero--induce switching, via the local heating it causes? We explore this and\nrelated issues by constructing a stochastic model for the time-evolution of the\ntemperature in a nanowire whose ends are maintained at a fixed temperature. We\nderive the corresponding master equation as tool for evaluating and analyzing\nthe mean switching time at a given value of current.

We carry out a detailed\ncomparison of the results of the model with experimental measurements of the\ndistribution of switching currents, and provide an explanation for the\ncounter-intuitive broadening of the distribution width that is observed upon\nlowering the temperature.

Although\nintroducing brane-localized mass terms in addition to the bulk masses is\nnecessary to realize flavor mixing, if the bulk masses were universal among\ngenerations, the flavor mixing and flavor changing neutral current processes\nare known to disappear. We also discuss whether natural flavor conservation is\nrealized in the scenario.

The eleven year solar cycle, which is well known from a variety of\nobserved quantities, strongly supports the idea of a large-scale solar dynamo.\nCurrent theoretical ideas on the location and mechanism of this dynamo are\npresented.\n  The solar cycle influences the behaviour of the global coronal magnetic field\nand it is the eruptions of this field that can impact on the Earth's\nenvironment. These global coronal variations can be modelled to a surprising\ndegree of accuracy. Recent high resolution observations of the Sun's magnetic\nfield in quiet regions, away from sunspots, show that there is a continual\nevolution of a small-scale magnetic field, presumably produced by small-scale\ndynamo action in the solar interior.\n  Sunspots, a natural consequence of the large-scale dynamo, emerge, evolve and\ndisperse over a period of several days. Numerical simulations can help to\ndetermine the physical processes governing the emergence of sunspots. We\ndiscuss the interaction of these emerging fields with the pre-existing coronal\nfield, resulting in a variety of dynamic phenomena.\n","Comment: 44 pages, 8 figures.

Such a priori\nknowledge is common in wireless relay networks. For example, a transmitting\nrelay could be relaying data that was previously transmitted by a node, in\nwhich case the interference received by the node now is actually self\ninformation. Besides the case of self information, the node could also have\noverheard or received the interference data in a prior transmission by another\nnode. Directly removing the known interference requires accurate estimate of\nthe interference channel, which may be difficult in many situations. In this\npaper, we propose a novel scheme, Blind Known Interference Cancellation (BKIC),\nto cancel known interference without interference channel information. BKIC\nconsists of two steps. The first step combines adjacent symbols to cancel the\ninterference, exploiting the fact that the channel coefficients are almost the\nsame between successive symbols. After such interference cancellation, however,\nthe signal of interest is also distorted. The second step recovers the signal\nof interest amidst the distortion. We propose two algorithms for the critical\nsecond steps. The first algorithm (BKIC-S) is based on the principle of\nsmoothing. It is simple and has near optimal performance in the slow fading\nscenario. The second algorithm (BKIC-RBP) is based on the principle of\nreal-valued belief propagation. It can achieve MAP-optimal performance with\nfast convergence, and has near optimal performance even in the fast fading\nscenario.

Due to the so called\nspin-charge separation, it is argued that the electron-phonon interaction in\nthe strongly interacting systems is fundamentally different from the weakly\ninteracting counterparts. Both spinons and holons are shown to carry electric\ncharge and couple to the electromagnetic field and consequently to phonons. A\nsystematic approach to calculate the dynamical charge of spinons and holons is\npresented, followed by a discussion of implications of this model for the high\ntemperature superconductors. It is demonstrated that the unusual oxygen isotope\neffect in high Tc materials can be easily understood within this framework.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 1 figure. Comments are welcome"]}]

While current hardware\ndevelopments allow to acquire, process and store 100s of terabytes of data at\nthe cost of a modern sports car, the software systems to handle these data are\nlagging behind. This general problem is recognized and addressed by various\nscientific communities, e.g., DATAGRID/EGEE federates compute and storage power\nover the high-energy physical community, while the astronomical community is\nbuilding an Internet geared Virtual Observatory, connecting archival data.\nThese large projects either focus on a specific distribution aspect or aim to\nconnect many sub-communities and have a relatively long trajectory for setting\nstandards and a common layer. Here, we report \"first light\" of a very different\nsolution to the problem initiated by a smaller astronomical IT community. It\nprovides the abstract \"scientific information layer\" which integrates\ndistributed scientific analysis with distributed processing and federated\narchiving and publishing. By designing new abstractions and mixing in old ones,\na Science Information System with fully scalable cornerstones has been\nachieved, transforming data systems into knowledge systems. This break-through\nis facilitated by the full end-to-end linking of all dependent data items,\nwhich allows full backward chaining from the observer/researcher to the\nexperiment. Key is the notion that information is intrinsic in nature and thus\nis the data acquired by a scientific experiment. The new abstraction is that\nsoftware systems guide the user to that intrinsic information by forcing full\nbackward and forward chaining in the data modelling.\n","Comment: To be published in ADASS XVI ASP Conference Series, 2006, R.
