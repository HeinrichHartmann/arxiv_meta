In this paper, the application\nof a particular class of de-noising algorithms - known as non-local mean (NLM)\nfilters - is investigated. Such filters have been recently applied for MRI data\nenhancement and they have been shown to provide more accurate results as\ncompared to many alternative de-noising algorithms. Unfortunately, virtually\nall existing methods for NLM filtering have been derived under the assumption\nof additive white Gaussian (AWG) noise contamination. Since this assumption is\nknown to fail at low values of SNR, an alternative formulation of NLM filtering\nis required, which would take into consideration the correct Rician statistics\nof MRI noise. Accordingly, the contribution of the present paper is two-fold.\nFirst, it points out some principal disadvantages of the earlier methods of NLM\nfiltering of MRI images and suggests means to rectify them. Second, the paper\nintroduces a new similarity measure for NLM filtering of MRI Images, which is\nderived under bona fide statistical assumptions and results in more accurate\nreconstruction of MR scans as compared to alternative NLM approaches. Finally,\nthe utility and viability of the proposed method is demonstrated through a\nseries of numerical experiments using both in silico and in vivo MRI data.\n"]}]

On the radial null geodesic method side, we study the modifications to\nthe tunneling rate, Hawking temperature and the Bekenstein- Hawking area law by\nincluding the back reaction as well as non-commutative effects in the\nspace-time. A reformulation of the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) method is first\nintroduced. Based on this, a close connection between the quantum tunneling and\nthe gravitational anomaly mechanisms to discuss Hawking effect, is put\nforwarded. An interesting advantage of this reformulated HJ method is that one\ncan get directly the emission spectrum from the event horizon of the black\nhole, which was missing in the earlier literature. Also, the quantization of\nthe entropy and area of a black hole is discussed in this method. Another part\nof the thesis is the introduction of a new type of global embedding of curved\nspace-time to higher dimensional Minkowskian space-time (GEMS). Using this a\nunified description of the Hawking and Unruh effects is given. Advantage of\nthis approach is, it simplifies as well as generalises the conventional\nembedding. In addition to the spherically symmetric space-times, the\nKerr-Newman black hole is exemplified.

The Ca0.1-doped crystal\nexhibits a long-range antiferromagnetically ordered ground state. In contrast,\nthe Sr0.15-doped crystal exhibits short-range antiferromagnetic order as well\nas weak superconductivity. In both crystals antiferromagnetic correlations are\ncommensurate; however, some results on the Ca0.1-doped crystal resemble those\non the spin-glass phase of La2-xSrxCuO4, where magnetic correlations became\nincommensurate. In addition, both crystals show a structural transition from\ntetragonal to orthorhombic symmetry. Quite remarkably, the temperature\ndependence and correlation length of the magnetic order is very similar to that\nof the orthorhombic distortion. We attribute this behavior to an orthorhombic\nstrain-induced inter-bilayer magnetic coupling, which triggers the\nantiferromagnetic order. The large size of the crystals made it also possible\nto study the magnetic diffuse scattering along rods perpendicular to the CuO2\nplanes in more detail. For comparison we show X-ray diffraction and\nmagnetization data. In particular, for the Ca0.1-doped crystal these\nmeasurements reveal valuable information on the spin-glass transition as well\nas a second anomaly associated with the Neel transition.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 12 figures"]}]
