In CS theory, we find topological, non-topological and semi-local\n(non-)topological vortices of non-Abelian kinds in unbroken, broken and\npartially broken vacua. We calculate the number of zero-modes using an index\ntheorem and then we apply the moduli matrix formalism to realize the moduli\nparameters. For the topological solitons we exhaust all the moduli while we\nstudy several examples of the non-topological and semi-local solitons. We find\nthat the zero-modes of the topological solitons are governed by the moduli\nmatrix H_0 only and those of the non-topological solitons are governed by both\nH_0 and the gauge invariant field \\Omega. We prove local uniqueness of the\nmaster equation in the YM case and finally, compare all results between the CS\nand YM theories.\n","Comment: 54 pages, 1 figure"]}]

A fundamental question in Statistics, Data Analysis and\nClassification, is the prediction of the number of clusters in a dataset,\nusually established via internal validation measures. Despite the wealth of\ninternal measures available in the literature, new ones have been recently\nproposed, some of them specifically for microarray data. In this dissertation,\na study of internal validation measures is given, paying particular attention\nto the stability based ones. Indeed, this class of measures is particularly\nprominent and promising in order to have a reliable estimate the number of\nclusters in a dataset. For those measures, a new general algorithmic paradigm\nis proposed here that highlights the richness of measures in this class and\naccounts for the ones already available in the literature. Moreover, some of\nthe most representative validation measures are also considered. Experiments on\n12 benchmark datasets are performed in order to assess both the intrinsic\nability of a measure to predict the correct number of clusters in a dataset and\nits merit relative to the other measures. The main result is a hierarchy of\ninternal validation measures in terms of precision and speed, highlighting some\nof their merits and limitations not reported before in the literature. This\nhierarchy shows that the faster the measure, the less accurate it is. In order\nto reduce the time performance gap between the fastest and the most precise\nmeasures, the technique of designing fast approximation algorithms is\nsystematically applied. The end result is a speed-up of many of the measures\nstudied here that brings the gap between the fastest and the most precise\nwithin one order of magnitude in time, with no degradation in their prediction\npower.

Earlier observations show omni-presence of\nquasi-periodic disturbances, travelling outward, which is believed to be caused\nby the ubiquitous presence of outward propagating waves. These waves, mostly of\ncompressional type, might provide the additional momentum and heat required for\nthe fast solar wind acceleration. It has been conjectured that these\ndisturbances are not due to waves but high speed plasma outflows, which are\ndifficult to distinguish using the current available techniques. With the\nunprecedented high spatial and temporal resolution of AIA, we search for these\nquasi-periodic disturbances in both plume and interplume regions of the polar\ncorona. We investigate their nature of propagation and search for a plausible\ninterpretation. We also aim to study their multi-thermal nature by using three\ndifferent coronal passbands of AIA. In almost all the locations chosen, in both\nplume and interplume regions we find the presence of propagating quasi-periodic\ndisturbances, of periodicities ranging from 10-30 min. These are clearly seen\nin two channels and in a few cases out to very large distances (~250 arcsec)\noff-limb, almost to the edge of the AIA field of view. The propagation speeds\nare in the range of 100-170 km/s. The average speeds are different for\ndifferent passbands and higher in interplume regions. Observed disturbances are\ninsensitive to changes in slit width. This indicates that a coherent mechanism\nis involved. In addition, the observed propagation speed varies between the\ndifferent passpands, implying that these quasi-periodic intensity disturbances\nare possibly due to magneto-acoustic waves. The propagation speeds in\ninterplume region are higher than in the plume region.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in A & A Letters"]}]

In spite of a common\npresumption that cosmology is a natural science, the specificity of its alleged\nsubject matter, that is the universe as a whole, makes cosmology fundamentally\ndifferent from other natural sciences. The reason is that in cosmology the\nsubject of cosmological research and its \"object\" are in a certain sense\ninseparable. Any study of the universe involves two opposite perspectives which\ncan be described as \"a-cosmic\" and \"cosmic\", egocentric and non-egocentric.\nCosmology involves two languages, namely that of physical causality (pertaining\nto the natural sciences) and that of intentionality (pertaining to the human\nsciences). On the one hand the universe can be seen as a product of discursive\nreason, that is as an abstract \"physical\" entity unfolding in space and time.\nOn the other hand the universe can be experienced through our participation in,\nor communion with the world understood as the natural context of living beings.\nThis dichotomy between reason and experience, abstract construction and\nconcrete participation, originates in the essence of human persons understood\nas unities of the corporeal and spiritual. On account of this dichotomy it is\nhard to set up a strict line of demarcation between the elements of the human\nand the natural sciences in cosmology. This confirms the intuition that any\nrealistic world view is incomplete without a knowledge of what it means to\nexist as a human being.
