An asymptotic\nsolution is obtained showing that the magnetic field does not affect the shape\neigenmodes, which remain the spherical harmonics as in the non-magnetic case.\nStrong magnetic field, however, constrains the liquid flow associated with the\noscillations and, thus, reduces the oscillation frequencies by increasing\neffective inertia of the liquid. In such a field, liquid oscillates in a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) way as solid columns aligned with the field. Two types of\noscillations are possible: longitudinal and transversal to the field. Such\noscillations are weakly damped by a strong magnetic field - the stronger the\nfield, the weaker the damping, except for the axisymmetric transversal and\ninherently 2D modes. The former are overdamped because of being incompatible\nwith the incompressibility constraint, whereas the latter are not affected at\nall because of being naturally invariant along the field. Since the magnetic\ndamping for all other modes decreases inversely with the square of the field\nstrength, viscous damping may become important in a sufficiently strong\nmagnetic field. The viscous damping is found analytically by a simple energy\ndissipation approach which is shown for the longitudinal modes to be equivalent\nto a much more complicated eigenvalue perturbation technique.

In\nthe continuum it is related to the standard SF by a non-singlet chiral field\nrotation and therefore referred to as the chirally rotated SF ($\\chi$SF). On\nthe lattice with Wilson fermions the relation is not exact, suggesting some\ninteresting tests of universality. The main advantage of the $\\chi$SF consists\nin its compatibility with the mechanism of automatic O($a$) improvement. In\nthis paper the basic set-up is introduced and discussed. Chirally rotated SF\nboundary conditions are implemented on the lattice using an orbifold\nconstruction. The lattice symmetries imply a list of counterterms, which\ndetermine how the action and the basic fermionic two-point functions are\nrenormalised and O($a$) improved. As with the standard SF, a logarithmically\ndivergent boundary counterterm leads to a multiplicative renormalisation of the\nfermionic boundary fields. In addition, a finite dimension 3 boundary\ncounterterm must be tuned in order to preserve the chirally rotated boundary\nconditions in the interacting theory. Once this is achieved, O($a$) effects\noriginating from the bulk action or from insertions of composite operators in\nthe bulk can be avoided by the mechanism of automatic O($a$) improvement. The\nremaining O($a$) effects arise from the boundaries and can be cancelled by\ntuning a couple of O($a$) boundary counterterms.

The Tevatron result is more than a $2\\sigma$ deviation from the\nstandard model prediction and motivates the application of alternative models\nintroducing new states.\n  However, as the standard model predictions for the total cross section\n$\\sigma_{tt}$ and invariant mass distribution $M_{tt}$ for this process are in\ngood agreement with experiments, any alternative model must reproduce these\npredictions. These models can be placed into two categories: One introduces the\ns-channel exchange of new vector bosons with chiral couplings to the light\nquarks and to the top quark and another relies on the t-channel exchange of\nparticles with large flavor-violating couplings in the quark sector. In this\nwork we employ a model which introduces both s- and t-channel nonstandard\ncontributions for the top quark pair production in proton antiproton\ncollisions. We use the minimal version of the $SU(3)_C \\otimes SU(3)_L \\otimes\nU (1)_X$ model (3-3-1 model) that predicts the existence of a new neutral gauge\nboson, called $Z^\\prime$. This gauge boson has both flavor-changing couplings\nto up and top quarks and chiral coupling to the light quarks and to the top\nquark. This very peculiar model coupling can correct the $A_{FB}$ for top quark\npair production for two ranges of $Z^\\prime$ mass while leading to cross\nsection and invariant mass distribution quite similar to the standard model\nones. This result reinforces the role of the 3-3-1 model for any new physics\neffect.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables"]}]

The conventional\ndynamic formalism, obtained for the space-time, where the motion of free\nparticles is primordially deterministic, seems to be unsuitable. The\nstatistical ensemble of stochastic (or deterministic) systems is considered to\nbe the main object of dynamics. At such a logical reloading the statistical\ndescription becomes a component of dynamics, and capacities of dynamics\nincrease. At such an approach one can describe deterministic, stochastic and\nquantum particles by means of the uniform technique. The quantum particle is\ndescribed as a stochastic particle, i.e. without a reference to the quantum\nprinciples. Besides, by means of this technique one can describe classical\ninviscid fluid. There are four different versions of the formalism: (1)\ndescription in Euler dynamic variables, (2) description in Lagrange dynamic\nvariables, (3) description in terms of the generalized stream function, (4)\ndescription in terms of the wave function. The uniform formalism is purely\ndynamic. Even describing stochastic systems, it does not refer to probability\nand probabilistic structures. In relativistic case the uniform formalism can\ndescribe pair production and pair annihilation.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 0 figure, Transformation to format of AMTP for submission\n  to Advances in Mathematical and Theoretical Physics"]}]
