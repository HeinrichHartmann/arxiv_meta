We try to reproduce\nthese two distributions theoretically using a liberal scenario in which the\ngainer star can lose mass into interstellar space as a consequence of its rapid\nrotation and the energy of a hot spot. In a recent paper (Van Rensbergen et al.\n2010, A&A) we calculated the liberal evolution of binaries with a B-type\nprimary at birth where mass transfer starts during core hydrogen burning of the\ndonor. In this paper we include the cases where mass transfer starts during\nhydrogen shell burning and it is our aim to reproduce the observed\ndistributions of the system parameters of Algol-type semi-detached systems. Our\ncalculations reveal the amount of time that an Algol binary lives with a well\ndefined value of mass ratio and orbital period. We use these data to simulate\nthe distribution of mass ratios and orbital periods of Algols. Binaries with a\nlate B-type initial primary hardly lose any mass whereas those with an early B\nprimary evolve in a non-conservative way.

I argue that the standard\ninterpretations of the Wright-Fisher controversy do not accurately represent\nthe ideas and arguments of these two key historical figures. The usual account\ncontrasts the major slogans attached to each name: Wright's adaptive landscape\nand shifting balance theory of evolution versus Fisher's fundamental theorem of\nnatural selection. These alternative theories are in fact incommensurable.\nWright's theory is a detailed dynamical model of evolutionary change in actual\npopulations. Fisher's theory is an abstract invariance and conservation law\nthat, like all physical laws, captures essential features of a system but does\nnot account for all aspects of dynamics in real examples. This key contrast\nbetween embodied theories of real cases and abstract laws is missing from prior\nanalyses of Wright versus Fisher. They never argued about this contrast.\nInstead, the issue at stake in their arguments concerned the actual dynamics of\nreal populations. Both agreed that fluctuations of nonadditive (epistatic) gene\ncombinations play a central role in evolution. Wright emphasized stochastic\nfluctuations of gene combinations in small, isolated populations. By contrast,\nFisher believed that fluctuating selection in large populations was the main\ncause of fluctuation in nonadditive gene combinations. Close reading shows that\nwidely cited views attributed to Fisher mostly come from what Wright said about\nFisher, whereas Fisher's own writings clearly do not support such views.\n","Comment: To be published as a chapter in The Adaptive Landscape in\n  Evolutionary Biology, E.

Various\nevolutionary dynamics have been studied in this setting for different games.\nDue to the complexity of the analysis, however, most of the work in this area\nis experimental. This paper aims to contribute to a more complete\nunderstanding, by providing rigorous analysis. We study the imitation dynamics\non two classes of graph: cycles and complete graphs. We focus on three well\nknown social dilemmas, namely the Prisoner's Dilemma, the Stag Hunt and the\nSnowdrift Game. We also consider, for completeness, the so-called Harmony Game.\nOur analysis shows that, on the cycle, all four games converge fast, either to\ntotal cooperation or total defection. On the complete graph, all but the\nSnowdrift game converge fast, either to cooperation or defection. The Snowdrift\ngame reaches a metastable state fast, where cooperators and defectors coexist.\nIt will converge to cooperation or defection only after spending time in this\nstate which is exponential in the size, n, of the graph.

We show a lower bound\nof $n(m -2) + 1$ on the sparsity of polynomials of any degree representing\nparity over $\\{0,..., m-1\\}^n$. We prove exact bounds on the sparsity of such\npolynomials for any two element subset $A$. The main tool used is Descartes'\nRule of Signs, a classical result in algebra, relating the sparsity of a\npolynomial to its number of real roots. As an application, we use bounds on\nsparsity to derive circuit lower bounds for depth-two AND-OR-NOT circuits with\na Threshold Gate at the top. We use this to give a simple proof that such\ncircuits need size $1.5^n$ to compute parity, which improves the previous bound\nof ${4/3}^{n/2}$ due to Goldmann (1997). We show a tight lower bound of $2^n$\nfor the inner product function over $\\{0,1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n$.\n","Comment: To appear in Computational Complexity"]}]
