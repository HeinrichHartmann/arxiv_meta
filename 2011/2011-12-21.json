Among other things, it was proposed as a potentially viable\nexplanation of a part of the Pioneer anomaly.

By taking a\ntypical comet moving along a highly eccentric and inclined orbit throughout the\nexpected entire extension of the Oort cloud (0.02 pc-1 pc), it turns out that\nthe addition of an outward Rindler-like acceleration, i.e. for A_Rin > 0, does\nnot allow bound orbits. Instead, if A_Rin < 0, the resulting numerically\nintegrated trajectory is limited in space, but it radically differs from the\nstandard Keplerian ellipse. In particular, the heliocentric distance of the\ncomet gets markedly reduced and experiences high frequency oscillations, its\nspeed is increased, and the overall pattern of the trajectory is quite\nisotropic. As a consequence, the standard picture of the Oort cloud is\nradically altered since its modified orbits are much less sensitive to the\ndisturbing actions of the Galactic tide and nearby passing stars whose effects,\nin the standard scenario, are responsible for the phenomenology on which our\nconfidence in the existence of the cloud itself is based.

That is, there are few differences between the elements of the\ncollection. This fact makes the compressibility of the collection extremely\nhigh. For example, a collection with all different versions of a Wikipedia\narticle can be compressed up to the 0.1% of its original space, using the\nLempel-Ziv 1977 (LZ77) compression scheme.\n  Many of these repetitive collections handle huge amounts of text data. For\nthat reason, we require a method to store them efficiently, while providing the\nability to operate on them. The most common operations are the extraction of\nrandom portions of the collection and the search for all the occurrences of a\ngiven pattern inside the whole collection.\n  A self-index is a data structure that stores a text in compressed form and\nallows to find the occurrences of a pattern efficiently. On the other hand,\nself-indexes can extract any substring of the collection, hence they are able\nto replace the original text. One of the main goals when using these indexes is\nto store them within main memory.\n  In this thesis we present a scheme for random text extraction from text\ncompressed with a Lempel-Ziv parsing. Additionally, we present a variant of\nLZ77, called LZ-End, that efficiently extracts text using space close to that\nof LZ77.\n  The main contribution of this thesis is the first self-index based on\nLZ77/LZ-End and oriented to repetitive texts, which outperforms the state of\nthe art (the RLCSA self-index) in many aspects. Finally, we present a corpus of\nrepetitive texts, coming from several application domains.

We find that the radio emission is severely\nunderpredicted by ADAF models and is explained by the relativistic jet.

They shine furiously for a few million\nyears, during which time they synthesize most of the heavy elements in the\nuniverse in their cores. They end by blowing themselves up in a powerful\nexplosion known as a supernova. During this process, the core collapses to a\nneutron star or a black hole, while the outer layers are expelled with\nvelocities of thousands of kilometers per second. The resulting fireworks often\noutshine the entire host galaxy for many weeks.\n  The explosion energy is eventually radiated away, but powering of the newborn\nnebula continues by radioactive isotopes synthesized in the explosion. The\nejecta are now quite transparent, and we can see the material produced in the\ndeep interiors of the star. To interpret the observations, detailed spectral\nmodeling is needed. This thesis aims to develop and apply state-of-the-art\ncomputational tools for interpreting and modeling supernova observations in the\nnebular phase. This requires calculation of the physical conditions throughout\nthe nebula, including non-thermal processes from the radioactivity, thermal and\nstatistical equilibrium, as well as radiative transport. The inclusion of\nmulti-line radiative transfer, which we compute with a Monte Carlo technique,\nrepresents one of the major advancements presented in this thesis.\n","Comment: PhD thesis. 84 pages"]}]
