Our\napproach is an adaptation of Burnett's formulation of the \"shortwave\napproximation\", which we generalize to analyze the effects of matter\ninhomogeneities as well as gravitational radiation. Our framework requires the\nmetric to be close to a \"background metric\", but allows arbitrarily large\nstress-energy fluctuations on small scales. We prove that, within our\nframework, if the matter stress-energy tensor satisfies the weak energy\ncondition (i.e., positivity of energy density in all frames), then the only\neffect that small scale inhomogeneities can have on the dynamics of the\nbackground metric is to provide an \"effective stress-energy tensor\" that is\ntraceless and has positive energy density---corresponding to the presence of\ngravitational radiation. In particular, nonlinear effects produced by small\nscale inhomogeneities cannot mimic the effects of dark energy. We also develop\n\"perturbation theory\" off of the background metric. We derive an equation for\nthe \"long-wavelength part\" of the leading order deviation of the metric from\nthe background metric, which contains the usual terms occurring in linearized\nperturbation theory plus additional contributions from the small-scale\ninhomogeneities. Under various assumptions concerning the absence of\ngravitational radiation and the non-relativistic behavior of the matter, we\nargue that the \"short wavelength\" deviations of the metric from the background\nmetric near a point $x$ should be accurately described by Newtonian gravity,\ntaking into account only the matter lying within a \"homogeneity lengthscale\" of\n$x$.

(AAAI'08) showed that several intractable global constraints\ncan be efficiently propagated when certain natural problem parameters are\nsmall. In particular, the complete propagation of a global constraint is\nfixed-parameter tractable in k - the number of holes in domains - whenever\nbound consistency can be enforced in polynomial time; this applies to the\nglobal constraints AtMost-NValue and Extended Global Cardinality (EGC).\n  In this paper we extend this line of research and introduce the concept of\nreduction to a problem kernel, a key concept of parameterized complexity, to\nthe field of global constraints. In particular, we show that the consistency\nproblem for AtMost-NValue constraints admits a linear time reduction to an\nequivalent instance on O(k^2) variables and domain values. This small kernel\ncan be used to speed up the complete propagation of NValue constraints. We\ncontrast this result by showing that the consistency problem for EGC\nconstraints does not admit a reduction to a polynomial problem kernel unless\nthe polynomial hierarchy collapses.\n"]}]

We show that these\n``51Peg b-like'' planets are rapidly synchronized by tidal interactions, but\nthat small departures from synchronous rotation can occur because of\nfluid-dynamical torques within these planets. Previous radiative-transfer and\nevolution models of such planets assume a homogeneous atmosphere. Nevertheless,\nwe show using simple arguments that, at the photosphere, the day-night\ntemperature difference and characteristic wind speeds may reach ~500 K and ~2\nkm/s, respectively. Substantial departures from chemical equilibrium are\nexpected. The cloud coverage depends sensitively on the dynamics; clouds could\nexist predominantly either on the dayside or nightside, depending on the\ncirculation regime. Radiative-transfer models that assume homogeneous\nconditions are therefore inadequate in describing the atmospheric properties of\n51Peg b-like planets. We present preliminary three-dimensional, nonlinear\nsimulations of the atmospheric circulation of HD209458b that indicate plausible\npatterns for the circulation and generally agree with our simpler estimates.\nFurthermore, we show that kinetic energy production in the atmosphere can lead\nto the deposition of substantial energy in the interior, with crucial\nconsequences for the evolution of these planets.
