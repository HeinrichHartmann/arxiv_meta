In the same period a radio-to-optical\nmonitoring of the source was provided by the GASP-WEBT and REM. Moreover,\nseveral Swift ToO observations were triggered, adding important information on\nthe source behaviour from optical/UV to hard X-rays. We paid particular\nattention to the calibration of the Swift/UVOT data to make it suitable to the\nblazars spectra. Simultaneous observations from radio to gamma rays allowed us\nto study in detail the correlation among the emission variability at different\nfrequencies and to investigate the mechanisms at work. In the period 9-30 March\n2009, AGILE detected an average gamma-ray flux of (311+/-21)x10^-8 ph cm^-2\ns^-1 for E>100 MeV, and a peak level of (702+/-131)x10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 on\ndaily integration. The gamma-ray activity occurred during a period of\nincreasing activity from near-IR to UV, with a flaring episode detected on\n26-27 March 2009, suggesting that a single mechanism is responsible for the\nflux enhancement observed from near-IR to UV. By contrast, Swift/XRT\nobservations seem to show no clear correlation of the X-ray fluxes with the\noptical and gamma-ray ones. However, the X-ray observations show a harder\nphoton index (1.3-1.6) with respect to most FSRQs and a hint of\nharder-when-brighter behaviour, indicating the possible presence of a second\nemission component at soft X-ray energies. Moreover, the broad band spectrum\nfrom radio-to-UV confirmed the evidence of thermal features in the optical/UV\nspectrum of PKS 1510-089 also during high gamma-ray state. On the other hand,\nduring 25-26 March 2009 a flat spectrum in the optical/UV energy band was\nobserved, suggesting an important contribution of the synchrotron emission in\nthis part of the spectrum during the brightest gamma-ray flare, therefore a\nsignificant shift of the synchrotron peak.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables.

We address the question of the lowest\nallowed flavor symmetry scale consistent with data. Because of the mechanism\nrecently pointed out by Grinstein et al. tree-level flavor changing neutral\ncurrents turn out to play a very weak constraining role. The same occurs, in\nour model, for electroweak precision observables. The main constraint turns out\nto come from WR-mediated flavor changing neutral current box diagrams,\nprimarily K - Kbar mixing. In the case where discrete parity symmetry is\npresent at the TeV scale, this constraint implies lower bounds on the mass of\nvectorlike fermions and flavor bosons of 5 and 10 TeV respectively. However,\nthese limits are weakened under the condition that only SU(2)_R x U(1)_{B-L} is\nrestored at the TeV scale, but not parity. For example, assuming the SU(2)\ngauge couplings in the ratio gR/gL approx 0.7 allows the above limits to go\ndown by half for both vectorlike fermions and flavor bosons. Our model provides\na framework for accommodating neutrino masses and, in the parity symmetric\ncase, provides a solution to the strong CP problem. The bound on the lepton\nflavor gauging scale is somewhat stronger, because of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis\nconstraints.

Three mechanisms contribute to the high-energy\nemission from CTTS: 1) CTTS have active coronae similar to main-sequence stars,\n2) the accreted material passes through an accretion shock at the stellar\nsurface, which heats it to a few MK, and 3) some CTTS drive powerful outflows.\nShocks within these jets can heat the plasma to X-ray emitting temperatures.\nCoronae are already well characterized in the literature; for the latter two\nscenarios models are shown. The magnetic field suppresses motion perpendicular\nto the field lines in the accretion shock, thus justifying a 1D geometry. The\nradiative loss is calculated as optically thin emission. A mixture of shocked\nand coronal gas is fitted to X-ray observations of accreting CTTS.\nSpecifically, the model explains the peculiar line-ratios in the He-like\ntriplets of Ne IX and O VII. All stars require only small mass accretion rates\nto power the X-ray emission.

The first one is the energy-kick (EK) method. To\napply this method, one adds an external energy kick to a particle in the\nlattice, and tracks its evolution by evolving the kicked system. The second one\nis the fluctuation-correlation (FC) method. The formula for calculating the\nprobability density function (PDF) using the canonical ensemble is slightly\nrevised and extended to the microcanonical ensemble. We show that the FC method\nhas advantages over the EK method theoretically and technically. Theoretically,\nthe PDF obtained by the FC method reveals the diffusion processes of the inner\nenergy while the PDF obtained by the EK method represents that of the kick\nenergy. The diffusion processes of the inner energy and the external energy\nadded to the system, i.e., the kick energy, may be different quantitatively and\neven qualitatively depending on models. To show these facts, we study not only\nthe equilibrium systems but also the stationary nonequilibrium systems.\nExamples showing that the inner energy and the kick energy may have different\ndiffusion behavior are reported in both cases. The technical advantage enables\nus to study the long-time diffusion processes and thus avoids the finite-time\neffect.\n","Comment: 10 pages;7figure"]}]

If these conditions are\nrelaxed, a natural CP-violating kinematic structure emerges. Having established\na CP-violating kinematic structure, we then discuss how Planck scale physics\nnecessarily invokes non-commutative space-time and that such changes in the\nstructure of space-time will force upon us additional violations/deformations\nof the CPT structure of space-time, and a violation of the principle of\nequivalence via a violation of the Lorentz symmetries.

It is based upon a complete\nset of dual-helicity eigenspinors of the charge conjugation operator. Due to\nits unusual properties with respect to charge conjugation and parity, it\nbelongs to a non-standard Wigner class. Consequently, the theory exhibits\nnon-locality with (CPT)^2 = - I. We briefly discuss its relevance to the\ncosmological `horizon problem'. Because the introduced fermionic field is\nendowed with mass dimension one, it can carry a quartic self-interaction. Its\ndominant interaction with known forms of matter is via Higgs, and with gravity.\nThis aspect leads us to contemplate the new fermion as a prime dark matter\ncandidate. Taking this suggestion seriously we study a supernova-like explosion\nof a galactic-mass dark matter cloud to set limits on the mass of the new\nparticle and present a calculation on relic abundance to constrain the relevant\ncross-section. The analysis favours light mass (roughly 20 MeV) and relevant\ncross-section of about 2 pb. Similarities and differences with the WIMP and\nmirror matter proposals for dark matter are enumerated.
