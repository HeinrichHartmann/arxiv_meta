We consider two\nsettings: output noise models where the noise enters after the projection and\ninput noise models where the noise enters before the projection. We consider\ntwo types of distortion for reconstruction: support errors and mean-squared\nerrors. Our goal is to relate the number of measurements, $m$, and $\\snr$, to\nsignal sparsity, $k$, distortion level, $d$, and signal dimension, $n$. We\nconsider support errors in a worst-case setting. We employ different variations\nof Fano's inequality to derive necessary conditions on the number of\nmeasurements and $\\snr$ required for exact reconstruction. To derive sufficient\nconditions we develop new insights on max-likelihood analysis based on a novel\nsuperposition property. In particular this property implies that small support\nerrors are the dominant error events. Consequently, our ML analysis does not\nsuffer the conservatism of the union bound and leads to a tighter analysis of\nmax-likelihood. These results provide order-wise tight bounds. For output noise\nmodels we show that asymptotically an $\\snr$ of $\\Theta(\\log(n))$ together with\n$\\Theta(k \\log(n/k))$ measurements is necessary and sufficient for exact\nsupport recovery. Furthermore, if a small fraction of support errors can be\ntolerated, a constant $\\snr$ turns out to be sufficient in the linear sparsity\nregime. In contrast for input noise models we show that support recovery fails\nif the number of measurements scales as $o(n\\log(n)/SNR)$ implying poor\ncompression performance for such cases.

It is also well-known how to perform both mesh\ngeneration and simplex subdivision, in arbitrary space dimension, so as to\nguarantee the entire hierarchy of nested simplex meshes produced through\nsubdivision continue to satisfy shape regularity. However, much more\nrestrictive angle conditions are needed for basic a priori quasi-optimal error\nestimates, as well as for a priori pointwise estimates.

It\nwas found that the model demonstrates a counter-example to the cosmic no-hair\ntheorem since there exists a stable anisotropically inflationary fix-point. One\nof the great triumphs of inflation, however, is that it explains the observed\nflatness and isotropy of the universe today without requiring special initial\nconditions. Any acceptable model for inflation should thus explain these\nobservations in a satisfactory way. To check whether the model meets this\nrequirement, we introduce curvature to the background geometry and consider\naxisymmetric spacetimes of Bianchi type II,III and the Kantowski-Sachs metric.\nWe show that the anisotropic Bianchi type I fix-point is an attractor for the\nentire family of such spacetimes. The model is predictive in the sense that the\nuniverse gets close to this fix-point after a few e-folds for a wide range of\ninitial conditions. If inflation lasts for N e-folds, the curvature at the end\nof inflation is typically of order exp(-2N). The anisotropy in the expansion\nrate at the end of inflation, on the other hand, while being small on the\none-percent level, is highly significant. We show that after the end of\ninflation there will be a period of isotropization lasting for about 2N/3\ne-folds. After that the shear scales as the curvature and becomes dominant\naround N e-folds after the end of inflation. For plausible bounds on the reheat\ntemperature the minimum number of e-folds during inflation, required for\nconsistency with the isotropy of the supernova Ia data, lays in the interval\n(21,48).

In particular we\nfind that all networks exhibit a second order transition in their RG flow. This\nphase transition is associated with the emergence of a giant hub and can be\nviewed as a new variant of percolation, called agglomerative percolation. We\nclaim that this transition exists also in previous graph renormalization\nschemes and explains some of the scaling laws seen there. For critical trees it\nhappens as N/N0 -> 0 in the limit of large systems (where N0 is the initial\nsize of the graph and N its size at a given RSR step). In contrast, it happens\nat finite N/N0 in sparse ER graphs and in the annealed model, while it happens\nfor N/N0 -> 1 on scale-free networks. Critical exponents seem to depend on the\ntype of the graph but not on the average degree and obey usual scaling\nrelations for percolation phenomena. For the annealed model they agree with the\nexponents obtained from a mean-field theory. At late times, the networks\nexhibit a star-like structure in agreement with the results of Radicchi et. al.\nWhile degree distributions are of main interest when regarding the scheme as\nnetwork renormalization, mass distributions (which are more relevant when\nconsidering 'supernodes' as clusters) are much easier to study using the fast\nNewman-Ziff algorithm for percolation, allowing us to obtain very high\nstatistics.\n"]}]

Quest-V uses virtualization techniques to isolate kernels and prevent\nlocal faults from affecting remote kernels. This leads to a high-confidence\nmultikernel approach, where failures of system subcomponents do not render the\nentire system inoperable. A virtual machine monitor for each kernel keeps track\nof shadow page table mappings that control immutable memory access\ncapabilities. This ensures a level of security and fault tolerance in\nsituations where a service in one kernel fails, or is corrupted by a malicious\nattack. Communication is supported between kernels using shared memory regions\nfor message passing. Similarly, device driver data structures are shareable\nbetween kernels to avoid the need for complex I/O virtualization, or\ncommunication with a dedicated kernel responsible for I/O. In Quest-V, device\ninterrupts are delivered directly to a kernel, rather than via a monitor that\ndetermines the destination. Apart from bootstrapping each kernel, handling\nfaults and managing shadow page tables, the monitors are not needed. This\ndiffers from conventional virtual machine systems in which a central monitor,\nor hypervisor, is responsible for scheduling and management of host resources\namongst a set of guest kernels. In this paper we show how Quest-V can implement\nnovel fault isolation and recovery techniques that are not possible with\nconventional systems. We also show how the costs of using virtualization for\nisolation of system services does not add undue overheads to the overall system\nperformance.\n"]}]
