Their method is essentially a\nprobabilistic generalization of the classical Floyd inductive assertion method.\nIn this paper, we consider quantum programs modeled by quantum Markov chains\nwhich are defined by super-operators. It is shown that the Sharir-Pnueli-Hart\nmethod can be elegantly generalized to quantum programs by exploiting the\nSchr\\\"odinger-Heisenberg duality between quantum states and observables.

Recently this lack has\nbeen partially addressed with the development of femtosecond laser\nmicromachining. Another similar although apparently unconnected field (B) deals\nwith the channelling of high power laser beam in filaments after passage\nthrough long distances in air. This has been largely driven by the construction\nof a mobile terawatt laser beam (Teramobile) for atmospheric studies. The laser\nbeams in these two cases (A and B) have very different pulse energies (mJ\nagainst J) although the filaments in (B) have similar energies to (A) and are\nclamped at intensities less than 1014 Wcm-2. This paper has been written to\ncompare the production of hard X-rays in these two cases. The conclusion is\ninteresting that a focused sub TW laser pulse in air reaches intensities\nsufficiently high that characteristic K and L X-rays are generated from a\nnumber of metal and non metal targets as well as a continuous bremsstrahlung\nspectrum.
