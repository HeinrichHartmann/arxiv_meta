SN 2008iy showed an unprecedentedly long rise time of\n~400 days, making it the first SN to take significantly longer than 100 days to\nreach peak optical luminosity. The peak absolute magnitude of SN 2008iy was M_r\n~ -19.1 mag, and the total radiated energy over the first ~700 days was ~2 x\n10^50 erg. Spectroscopically, SN 2008iy is very similar to the Type IIn SN\n1988Z at late times, and, like SN 1988Z, it is a luminous X-ray source (both\nsupernovae had an X-ray luminosity L_ X > 10^41 erg/s). The Halpha emission\nprofile of SN 2008iy shows a narrow P Cygni absorption component, implying a\npre-SN wind speed of ~100 km/s. We argue that the luminosity of SN 2008iy is\npowered via the interaction of the SN ejecta with a dense, clumpy circumstellar\nmedium. The ~400 day rise time can be understood if the number density of\nclumps increases with distance over a radius ~1.7 x 10^16 cm from the\nprogenitor. This scenario is possible if the progenitor experienced an episodic\nphase of enhanced mass-loss < 1 century prior to explosion or the progenitor\nwind speed increased during the decades before core collapse. We favour the\nformer scenario, which is reminiscent of the eruptive mass-loss episodes\nobserved for luminous blue variable (LBV) stars. The progenitor wind speed and\nincreased mass-loss rates serve as further evidence that at least some, and\nperhaps all, Type IIn supernovae experience LBV-like eruptions shortly before\ncore collapse. We also discuss the host galaxy of SN 2008iy, a subluminous\ndwarf galaxy, and offer a few reasons why the recent suggestion that unusual,\nluminous supernovae preferentially occur in dwarf galaxies may be the result of\nobservational biases.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 5 figures, MNRAS accepted"]}]

By\nconsidering this angular momentum as a collection of entangled spins, we\ncompute the bipartite entanglement dynamics as a function of the dynamics of\nthe classical counterpart. Our numerical results indicate that the entanglement\nof the quantum top depends on the specific details of the dynamics of the\nclassical top rather than depending universally on the global properties of the\nclassical regime. These results are grounded on linking the entanglement rate\nto averages involving the classical angular momentum, thereby explaining why\nregular dynamics can entangle as efficiently as the classically chaotic regime.\nThe findings are in line with previous results obtained with a 2-particle top\nmodel, and we show here that the standard kicked top can be obtained as a\nlimiting case of the 2-particle top.\n"]}]

Existing information-theoretic exploration strategies for\nlearning GP-based environmental field maps adopt the non-Markovian problem\nstructure and consequently scale poorly with the length of history of\nobservations. Hence, it becomes computationally impractical to use these\nstrategies for in situ, real-time active sampling. To ease this computational\nburden, this paper presents a Markov-based approach to efficient\ninformation-theoretic path planning for active sampling of GP-based fields. We\nanalyze the time complexity of solving the Markov-based path planning problem,\nand demonstrate analytically that it scales better than that of deriving the\nnon-Markovian strategies with increasing length of planning horizon. For a\nclass of exploration tasks called the transect sampling task, we provide\ntheoretical guarantees on the active sampling performance of our Markov-based\npolicy, from which ideal environmental field conditions and sampling task\nsettings can be established to limit its performance degradation due to\nviolation of the Markov assumption.

Axial rotation and mass loss have a\ngreat influence on massive star evolution in general and more specifically on\nthe durations of these different phases. Moderate rotation and mass loss,\nduring the MS phase, favor the evolution towards the RSG stage. Fast rotation\nand strong mass loss during the MS phase, in contrast, prevent the star from\nbecoming a RSG and allow the star to pass directly from the OB star phase into\nthe WR phase. Mass loss during the RSG stage may make the star evolve back in\nthe blue part of the HR diagram. We argue that such an evolution may be more\ncommon than presently accounted for in stellar models. This might be the reason\nfor the lack of type IIP SNe with RSG progenitors having initial masses between\n18 and 30 M$_\\odot$. The LBVs do appear as a possible transition phase between\nO and WR stars or between WNL and WNE stars.
