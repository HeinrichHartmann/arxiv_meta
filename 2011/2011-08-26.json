Addressing these\nissues of social networks has recently become possible through large scale data\nanalysis of e.g. mobile phone call records, which has revealed the existence of\nmodular or community structure with many links between nodes of the same\ncommunity and relatively few links between nodes of different communities. The\nweights of links, e.g. the number of calls between two users, and the network\ntopology are found correlated such that intra-community links are stronger\ncompared to the weak inter-community links. This is known as Granovetter's \"The\nstrength of weak ties\" hypothesis. In addition to this inhomogeneous community\nstructure, the temporal patterns of human dynamics turn out to be inhomogeneous\nor bursty, characterized by the heavy tailed distribution of inter-event time\nbetween two consecutive events. In this paper, we study how the community\nstructure and the bursty dynamics emerge together in an evolving weighted\nnetwork model. The principal mechanisms behind these patterns are social\ninteraction by cyclic closure, i.e. links to friends of friends and the focal\nclosure, i.e. links to individuals sharing similar attributes or interests, and\nhuman dynamics by task handling process. These three mechanisms have been\nimplemented as a network model with local attachment, global attachment, and\npriority-based queuing processes. By comprehensive numerical simulations we\nshow that the interplay of these mechanisms leads to the emergence of heavy\ntailed inter-event time distribution and the evolution of Granovetter-type\ncommunity structure. Moreover, the numerical results are found to be in\nqualitative agreement with empirical results from mobile phone call dataset.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures"]}]

Through these processes, this work\nexplored the constituent structure of baryons and the mechanisms through which\nthe interactions between these constituents ultimately control the selected\nreactions. First, hard nucleon-nucleon elastic scattering was studied\nconsidering the quark exchange (QE) between the nucleons to be the dominant\nmechanism of interaction in the constituent picture. It was found that an\nangular asymmetry exhibited by proton-neutron (pn) elastic scattering data is\nexplained within this framework if a quark-diquark picture dominates the\nnucleon's structure instead of a more traditional SU(6) model. The latter\nyields an asymmetry around 90 deg center of mass scattering with a sign\nopposite to what is experimentally observed. The second process is the hard\nbreakup by a photon of a nucleon-nucleon system in light nuclei. Proton-proton\n(pp) and pn breakup in 3He, and double Delta-isobars production in deuteron\nbreakup were analyzed in the hard rescattering model (HRM), which in\nconjunction with the QE mechanism provides a QCD description of the reaction.\nCross sections for both channels in 3He photodisintegration were computed\nwithout the need of a fitting parameter. The results presented here for pp\nbreakup show excellent agreement with recent experimental data. In double\nDelta-isobars production in deuteron breakup, HRM angular distributions for the\ntwo double Delta channels were compared to the pn channel and to each other. An\nimportant prediction from this study is that the Delta++ Delta- channel\nconsistently dominates Delta+Delta0, which is in contrast with models that\nunlike the HRM consider a double Delta system in the initial state of the\ninteraction. For such models both channels should have the same strength.\n","Comment: http://digitalcommons.fiu.edu/etd/447"]}]

The abelian category is the\nquotient of the category of graded vector space representations of the quiver\nobtained by making the graded representations that are the sum of their finite\ndimensional submodules isomorphic to zero.\n  Actually, the main result in this paper is that the abelian categories are\nequivalent if the incidence matrices are strong shift equivalent. That result\nis combined with an earlier result of the author to prove that if the incidence\nmatrices are shift equivalent, then the associated abelian categories are\nequivalent.\n  Given William's Theorem that subshifts of finite type associated to two\ndirected graphs are conjugate if and only if the graphs are strong shift\nequivalent, our main result can be reformulated as follows: if the subshifts\nassociated to two directed graphs are conjugate, then the categories associated\nto those graphs are equivalent.\n"]}]

First, we study the hypothesis\nof a pure luminosity evolution scenario, in which galaxies are supposed to form\nall at the same redshift and then evolve only in luminosity without any merging\nor interaction.

With quantum\neffects a motion of a particle through a barrier is allowed due to quantum\ntunneling. According to usual theories of tunneling, the particle density\ndecays inside a classical barrier resulting in an extremely slow pentration\nprocess. However, there are no general laws forbidding fast motion through\nclassical barriers. The problem addressed is investigation of unusual features\no quantum tunneling through a classic static barrier which is at least\ntwo-dimensional. Here we show that penetration through such barrier can be not\nslow. When the barrier satisfies the certain conditions, a regime of quantum\nlens is possible with formation of caustics. De Broglie waves are reflected\nfrom the caustics, interfere, and result in a not small flux from under the\nbarrier.

We establish the first sparticle\nexclusion boundaries on these models, finding that the LSP mass should be at\nleast about 92 GeV, with a corresponding boundary gaugino mass M_1/2 above\nabout 485 GeV. In contrast to the higher mass constraints established for the\nCMSSM, we find the minimum exclusion boundary on the FSU5 gluino and heavy\nsquark masses resides in the range of 658-674 GeV and 854-1088 GeV,\nrespectively, with a minimum light stop squark mass of about 520 GeV. Moreover,\nwe show that elements of the surviving parameter space not only escape the\nonslaught of LHC data which is currently decimating the standard mSUGRA/CMSSM\nbenchmarks, but are further able to efficiently explain certain tantalizing\nproduction excesses over the SM background which have been reported by the CMS\ncollaboration. We also extend this study comparatively to five distinct\ncollider energies and four specific cut methodologies, including a proposed set\nof selection cuts designed to reveal the natural ultra-high jet multiplicity\nsignal associated with the stable mass hierarchy m_t < m_g < m_q of the FSU5\nmodels. By so doing, we demonstrate that a rather stable enhancement in model\nvisibility, conservatively of order ten, may be attained by adoption of these\ncuts, which is sufficient for an immediate and definitive testing of a majority\nof the model space using only the existing LHC data set. We stress the point\nthat habits established in lower jet multiplicity searches do not necessarily\ncarry over into the ultra-high jet multiplicity search regime.\n","Comment: 21 Pages, 6 Figures, 4 Tables"]}]

We concentrate on the influence of the field\nstrength $E$, length of the chain $N$, and length of the pore $L$ on forced\ntranslocation. As our main result, we find a crossover scaling for the\ntranslocation time $\\tau $ with the chain length from $\\tau \\sim N^{2\\nu}$ for\nrelatively short polymers to $\\tau \\sim N^{1 + \\nu}$ for longer chains, where\n$\\nu $ is the Flory exponent. We demonstrate that this crossover is due to the\nchange in the dependence of the translocation velocity v on the chain length.\nFor relatively short chains $v \\sim N^{- \\nu}$, which crosses over to $v \\sim\nN^{- 1}$ for long polymers. The reason for this is that with increasing $N$\nthere is a high density of segments near the exit of the pore, which slows down\nthe translocation process due to slow relaxation of the chain. For the case of\na long nanopore for which $R_\\parallel $, the radius of gyration $R_{g}$ along\nthe pore, is smaller than the pore length, we find no clear scaling of the\ntranslocation time with the chain length. For large $N$, however, the\nasymptotic scaling $\\tau \\sim N^{1 + \\nu}$ is recovered. In this regime, $\\tau\n$ is almost independent of $L$. We have previously found that for a polymer,\nwhich is initially placed in the middle of the pore, there is a minimum in the\nescape time for $R_\\parallel \\approx L$. We show here that this minimum\npersists for a weak fields $E$ such that $EL$ is less than some critical value,\nbut vanishes for large values of $EL$.\n","Comment: 25 Pages, 10 figures.
