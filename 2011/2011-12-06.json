In the context of simple benchmark\nmodels for estimating the e+e- output, we consider all known pulsars, as listed\nin the most complete available catalogue. We find that it is unlikely that a\nsingle pulsar be responsible for both the PAMELA e+ fraction anomaly and for\nthe ATIC excess, although two single sources are in principle enough to explain\nboth experimental results. The PAMELA excess e+ likely come from a set of\nmature pulsars (age ~ 10^6 yr), with a distance of 0.8-1 kpc, or from a single,\nyounger and closer source like Geminga. The ATIC data require a larger (and\nless plausible) energy output, and favor an origin associated to powerful, more\ndistant (1-2 kpc) and younger (age ~ 10^5$ yr) pulsars. We list several\ncandidate pulsars that can individually or coherently contribute to explain the\nPAMELA and ATIC data. Although generally suppressed, we find that the\ncontribution of pulsars more distant than 1-2 kpc could contribute for the ATIC\nexcess. Finally, we stress the multi-faceted and decisive role that Fermi-LAT\nwill play in the very near future by (1) providing an exquisite measurement of\nthe e+e- flux, (2) unveiling the existence of as yet undetected pulsars, and\n(3) searching for anisotropies in the arrival direction of high-energy e+e-.\n","Comment: revised version, references and new figures added, changes in the\n  discussion and figures"]}]

A\npower-law distribution of the waiting times, $\\psi(\\tau) \\tau^{-(1+\\alpha)}$,\nleads to sub-diffusion ($<x^2>~t^{\\alpha}$) for 0<\\alpha<1. In closed systems,\nthe long stagnation periods cause time-averages to divert from the\ncorresponding ensemble averages, which is a manifestation of weak ergodicity\nbreaking. The time-average of a general observable $\\bar{U} = \\int_0^t\nU[x(\\tau)]d\\tau / t$ is a functional of the path and is described by the well\nknown Feynman-Kac equation if the motion is Brownian. Here, we derive forward\nand backward fractional Feynman-Kac equations for functionals of CTRW in a\nbinding potential. We use our equations to study two specific time-averages:\nthe fraction of time spent by a particle in half box, and the time-average of\nthe particle's position in a harmonic field. In both cases, we obtain the\nprobability density function of the time-averages for $t \\rightarrow \\infty$\nand the first two moments. Our results show that both the occupation fraction\nand the time-averaged position are random variables even for long-times, except\nfor \\alpha=1 when they are identical to their ensemble averages. Using the\nfractional Feynman-Kac equation, we also study the dynamics leading to weak\nergodicity breaking, namely the convergence of the fluctuations to their\nasymptotic values.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Depending on the expressed presynaptic signaling pathways, astrocytes\nmay globally inhibit or potentiate the synapse: the amount of released\nneurotransmitter in the presence of the astrocyte is transiently smaller or\nlarger than in its absence.

In the study of efficient reasoning over\nmassive graphs, the notion of node bisimilarity plays a central role. For\nexample, grouping together bisimilar nodes in an XML data set is the first step\nin many sophisticated approaches to building indexing data structures for\nefficient XPath query evaluation. To date, however, only internal-memory\nbisimulation algorithms have been investigated. As the size of real-world DAG\ndata sets often exceeds available main memory, storage in external memory\nbecomes necessary. Hence, there is a practical need for an efficient approach\nto computing bisimulation in external memory.\n  Our general algorithm has a worst-case IO-complexity of O(Sort(|N| + |E|)),\nwhere |N| and |E| are the numbers of nodes and edges, resp., in the data graph\nand Sort(n) is the number of accesses to external memory needed to sort an\ninput of size n.

We empirically\nverify efficient performance of the algorithms on graphs and XML documents\nhaving billions of nodes and edges, and find that the algorithms can process\nsuch graphs efficiently even when very limited internal memory is available.\nThe proposed algorithms are simple enough for practical implementation and use,\nand open the door for further study of external-memory bisimulation algorithms.\nTo this end, the full open-source C++ implementation has been made freely\navailable.\n"]}]

From one side,\ndue to the viscosity term, smooth data seem to produce solutions with an\neverlasting regular behavior. On the other hand, the lack of a convincing\ntheoretical analysis suggests the existence of possible counterexamples. In\nparticular, one cannot exclude the blowing up of solutions in finite time even\nin presence of smooth data. Here we give examples of explicit solutions of the\nnon-homogeneous equations. These are defined on a Hill's type vortex where the\nflow is rotating and swirling at the same time, inducing the flux to spiraling\nat a central node. Despite the appearance, the solution still remains very\nregular at the agglomeration point. The analysis may lead to a better\nunderstanding of the subtle problem of characterizing the solution space of the\n3D Navier-Stokes equations. For instance, this result makes more narrow the\npath to the search of counterexamples built on the stretching and twisting of\nvortex tubes.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 3 figures"]}]

Counterterms are\nconstructed in details in the NLO of the large-N expansion. The\nrenormalizability is demonstrated at the same level of the approximation also\nwith eliminating the auxiliary field.\n  In the one component \\phi^4 model (at T=0) a method using renormalization\nconditions is developed, which gives directly finite equations for the 1- and\n2-point functions. This solves the problems of numerical precision of the\ncounterterm formulated renormalization. In the two-loop 2PI approximation the\nequivalence of the new method and the procedure formulated with counterterms is\nshown, both analytically and numerically. For the counterterm method also a new\nalgorithm is developed, which accelerates the numerical convergence.\n  In the U(N)xU(N) model, an approximate solution of the field equations in the\nlarge-N limit is found in the broken phase, for a condensate proportional to\nthe unit matrix. The approximation assumes the presence of a mass-hierarchy\nbetween the scalar and pseudoscalar fields. The validity of the latter\nassumption is investigated in the whole parameter space numerically. The\nstability of the solution against a more general condensate is checked. It is\nshown that, there exists a region of the parameter space, where the condensate\ncorresponding to the \"8\" direction of the SU(3) classification can arise\nspontaneously.
