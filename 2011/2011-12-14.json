More than ten years ago,\nwe proposed a new fundamental equation of nonequilibrium statistical physics in\nplace of the present Liouville equation. That is the stochastic velocity type's\nLangevin equation in 6N dimensional phase space or its equivalent Liouville\ndiffusion equation. This equation is time-reversed asymmetrical. It shows that\nthe form of motion of particles in statistical thermodynamic systems has the\ndrift-diffusion duality, and the law of motion of statistical thermodynamics is\nexpressed by a superposition of both the law of dynamics and stochastic\nvelocity and possesses both determinism and probability. Hence it is different\nwith the law of motion of particles in dynamical systems. Starting from this\nfundamental equation the BBGKY diffusion equation hierarchy, the Boltzmann\ncollision diffusion equation, the hydrodynamic equations such as the mass\ndrift-diffusion equation, the Navier-Stokes equation and the thermal\nconductivity equation have been derived and presented here. What is more\nimportant, we first constructed a nonlinear evolution equation of\nnonequilibrium entropy density in 6N, 6 and 3 dimensional phase space,\npredicted the existence of entropy diffusion. This evolution equation reveals\nthat the time rate of change of nonequilibrium entropy density originates\ntogether from its drift, diffusion and production in space. Furthermore, we\npresented a formula for entropy production rate (i.e. the law of entropy\nincrease), proved that internal attractive force in nonequilibrium system can\nresult in entropy decrease while internal repulsive force leads to another\nentropy increase, obtained an unified theoretical expression for thermodynamic\ndegradation and self-organizing evolution, and revealed that the entropy\ndiffusion mechanism caused the system to approach to equilibrium.\n","Comment: 37 pages, 1 figure. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:0804.1601"]}]

Organisms use a variety of mechanisms to protect themselves\nagainst perturbations. For example, repair mechanisms fix damage, feedback\nloops keep homeostatic systems at their setpoints, and biochemical filters\ndistinguish signal from noise. Such buffering mechanisms are often discussed in\nterms of robustness, which may be measured by reduced sensitivity of\nperformance to perturbations. Methodology/Principal Findings. I use a\nmathematical model to analyze the evolutionary dynamics of robustness in order\nto understand aspects of organismal design by natural selection. I focus on two\ncharacters: one character performs an adaptive task; the other character\nbuffers the performance of the first character against perturbations. Increased\nperturbations favor enhanced buffering and robustness, which in turn decreases\nsensitivity and reduces the intensity of natural selection on the adaptive\ncharacter. Reduced selective pressure on the adaptive character often leads to\na less costly, lower performance trait. Conclusions/Significance. The paradox\nof robustness arises from evolutionary dynamics: enhanced robustness causes an\nevolutionary reduction in the adaptive performance of the target character,\nleading to a degree of maladaptation compared to what could be achieved by\nnatural selection in the absence of robustness mechanisms. Over evolutionary\ntime, buffering traits may become layered on top of each other, while the\nunderlying adaptive traits become replaced by cheaper, lower performance\ncomponents. The paradox of robustness has widespread implications for\nunderstanding organismal design.\n"]}]

In the massless limit,\nthe classical DVG theory can be exactly solved for a rather general coupling\ndepending only on the field tensor and the dilaton. We show that the vecton\nfield can be consistently replaced by a new effectively massive scalar field\n(scalaron) with an unusual coupling to dilaton gravity (DSG).

Our methods also yield an efficient method for machine computation of the\ncohomology of sheaves.\n  Along the way we study minimal free resolutions over an exterior algebra. For\nexample, we show that such resolutions are eventually dominated by their\n\"linear parts\" in the sense that erasing all terms of degree $>1$ in the\ncomplex yields a new complex which is eventually exact.\n  This paper is a joint, extended version of papers previously written by\nEisenbud-Schreyer and by Fl{\\o}ystad seperately.\n","Comment: 36 pages, new improved version of last Section 8 on free monads"]}]
