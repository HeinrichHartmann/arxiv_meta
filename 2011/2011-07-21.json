Using our\ndetailed radiation hydrodynamical models that include dust formation, we\nillustrate the effects of pulsation energy on wind properties. We find that the\nmass-loss rate scales with the kinetic energy input by pulsations as long as a\ndust-saturated wind does not occur, and all other stellar parameters are kept\nconstant. This includes the absolute abundance of condensible carbon (not bound\nin CO), which is more relevant than keeping the C/O-ratio constant when\ncomparing stars of different metallicity. The pressure and temperature\ngradients in the atmospheres of stars, become steeper and flatter,\nrespectively, when the metallicity is reduced, while the radius where the\natmosphere becomes opaque is typically associated with a higher gas pressure.\nThis effect can be compensated for by adjusting the velocity amplitude of the\nvariable inner boundary (piston), which is used to simulate the effects of\npulsation, to obtain models with comparable kinetic-energy input. Hence, it is\nmore relevant to compare models with similar energy-injections than of similar\nvelocity amplitude. Since there is no evidence for weaker pulsations in\nlow-metallicity AGB stars, we conclude that it is unlikely that low-metallicity\nC-stars have a lower mass-loss rate, than their more metal-rich counterparts\nwith similar stellar parameters, as long as they have a comparable amount of\ncondensible carbon.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures.

For a scalar, linear diffusion process, we study the problem of\nchoosing the causal sampling times that will give the lowest aggregate squared\nerror distortion. We stick to finite-horizons and impose a hard upper bound on\nthe number of allowed samples. We cast the design as a problem of choosing an\noptimal sequence of stopping times.

Under an unproven but\nnatural assumption about the least-square estimate at the supervisor, each of\nthese single stopping problems are of standard form. The optimal stopping times\nare random times when the estimation error exceeds designed envelopes. For the\ncase where the state is a Brownian motion, we give analytically: the shape of\nthe optimal sampling envelopes, the shape of the envelopes under optimal Delta\nsampling, and their performances.

A key objective for the analysis and\nverification of these games is the termination objective, where the players aim\nto maximize (minimize, respectively) the probability of hitting counter value\n0, starting at a given control state and given counter value. Recently, we\nstudied qualitative decision problems (\"is the optimal termination value = 1?\")\nfor OC-MDPs (and OC-SSGs) and showed them to be decidable in P-time (in NP and\ncoNP, respectively). However, quantitative decision and approximation problems\n(\"is the optimal termination value ? p\", or \"approximate the termination value\nwithin epsilon\") are far more challenging. This is so in part because optimal\nstrategies may not exist, and because even when they do exist they can have a\nhighly non-trivial structure. It thus remained open even whether any of these\nquantitative termination problems are computable. In this paper we show that\nall quantitative approximation problems for the termination value for OC-MDPs\nand OC-SSGs are computable. Specifically, given a OC-SSG, and given epsilon >\n0, we can compute a value v that approximates the value of the OC-SSG\ntermination game within additive error epsilon, and furthermore we can compute\nepsilon-optimal strategies for both players in the game. A key ingredient in\nour proofs is a subtle martingale, derived from solving certain LPs that we can\nassociate with a maximizing OC-MDP. An application of Azuma's inequality on\nthese martingales yields a computable bound for the \"wealth\" at which a \"rich\nperson's strategy\" becomes epsilon-optimal for OC-MDPs.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 1 figure, full version of a paper presented at ICALP 2011,\n  invited for submission to Information and Computation"]}]

The only hard X-ray feature is the prominent Fe K\nalpha fluorescence line, with equivalent width greater than 1 keV in all\nsources. The Fe line luminosity provides the best X-ray indicator of the unseen\nintrinsic AGN luminosity. In detail, the morphologies of the extended soft\nX-ray emission and optical line emission are similar, and line emission\ndominates the soft X-ray spectra. Thus, we attribute the soft X-ray emission to\nmaterial that the central engines photoionize.

The interaction is described by scalar and vector mesons, with\ncoupling strengths adjusted to the nuclear matter. No explicit density depe\nndence is assumed. The hamiltonian is applied in a QMD calculation to determine\nthe fragment distribution in O + Br collision at different energies (50 -- 200\nMeV/u) to test the applicability of the model at low energies.
