Their dynamical behavior is explored by pulsing\nthe microwave excitation over a range of times comparable to the phase\ncoherence time and the lifetime of the electron in the trap. Trap occupancy is\nlimited to a single electron, which can be manipulated by resonant microwave\nexcitation and the resulting change in trap occupancy is detected by the change\nin the channel current of the transistor. The trap behavior is described by a\nclassical damped driven simple harmonic oscillator model, with the phase\ncoherence, lifetime and coupling strength parameters derived from a continuous\nwave (CW) measurement only. For pulse times shorter than the phase coherence\ntime, the energy exchange between traps, due to the coupling, strongly\nmodulates the observed drain current change.

It\nrelies on the method developed by Ren\\'e Garnier and published in 1928 in a\npaper which seems today to be totally forgotten. Garnier's approach is more\ngeometrical and constructive than the variational one, and it provides minimal\ndisks without branch point. However, it is sometimes really complicated, and\neven obscure or incomplete. Following Garnier's initial ideas, we propose a new\nproof, which intends not only to be complete, but also simpler and moderner\nthan his one. This work mainly relies on a systematic use of Fuchsian systems\nand on the relation that we establish between the reality of such systems and\ntheir monodromy. Garnier's method is based on the following fact: using the\nspinor Weierstrass representation for minimal surfaces, we can associate a real\nFuchsian second-order equation, defined on the Riemann sphere, with each\nminimal disk with a polygonal boundary curve. The monodromy of the equation is\ndetermined by the oriented directions of the edges of the boundary. To solve\nthe Plateau problem, we are thus led to solve a Riemann-Hilbert problem. We\nthen proceed in two steps: first, by means of isomonodromic deformations, we\nconstruct and describe the family of all minimal disks with a polygonal\nboundary curve of given oriented directions. Then we use this description to\nstudy the edges's lengths of their boundary curves, and we show that every\npolygon is the boundary of a minimal disk.\n","Comment: French, 106 pages"]}]

We here investigate such spatially\nintermittent flows in a pipe experiment showing that turbulent puffs have a\nwell defined interaction distance, which sets the minimum spacing of puffs as\nwell as the maximum observable turbulent fraction. Two methodologies are\nemployed here. Starting from a laminar flow puffs can be created by locally\ninjecting a jet of fluid through the pipe wall. When the perturbation is\napplied periodically at low frequencies, as expected, a regular sequence of\npuffs is observed where the puff spacing is given by the ratio of the mean flow\nspeed to the perturbation frequency. On the other hand, at large frequencies\npuffs are found to interact and annihilate each other. Varying the perturbation\nfrequency an interaction distance can be determined. In the second set of\nexperiments, the Reynolds number is reduced suddenly from fully developed\nturbulence to the intermittent regime.The resulting flow reorganizes itself to\na sequence of constant size puffs which, unlike in Couette and Taylor Couette\nflow are randomly spaced. The minimum distance between the turbulent patches is\nidentical to the puff interaction length.

These critical wavelengths are essential for\nunderstanding the effects of MHD waves (or turbulence) on the structure and\nevolution of molecular clouds.
