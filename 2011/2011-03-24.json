RSR is a graph renormalization procedure that locally\naggregates nodes to produce a coarse grained network. It is analogous to the\n(quasi-)parallel renormalization schemes introduced by C.

In this first paper we apply RSR to critical trees and derive\nanalytical results consistent with numerical simulations. Critical trees\nexhibit three regimes in their evolution under RSR: (i) An initial regime\n$N_0^{\\nu}\\lesssim N<N_0$, where $N$ is the number of nodes at some step in the\nrenormalization and $N_0$ is the initial size. RSR in this regime is described\nby a mean field theory and fluctuations from one realization to another are\nsmall. The exponent $\\nu=1/2$ is derived using random walk arguments. The\ndegree distribution becomes broader under successive renormalization --\nreaching a power law, $p_k\\sim 1/k^{\\gamma}$ with $\\gamma=2$ and a variance\nthat diverges as $N_0^{1/2}$ at the end of this regime. Both of these results\nare derived based on a scaling theory. (ii) An intermediate regime for\n$N_0^{1/4}\\lesssim N \\lesssim N_0^{1/2}$, in which hubs develop, and\nfluctuations between different realizations of the RSR are large.

(iii)\nThe last regime, for $1 \\ll N\\lesssim N_0^{1/4}$, is characterized by the\nappearance of star configurations with a central hub surrounded by many leaves.\nThe distribution of sizes where stars first form is found numerically to be a\npower law up to a cutoff that scales as $N_0^{\\nu_{star}}$ with\n$\\nu_{star}\\approx 1/4$.\n"]}]

Dynamical\ndecoupling (DD) is an effective method for reducing decoherence with a low\ncontrol overhead. It also plays an important role in quantum metrology, where\nfor instance it is employed in multiparameter estimation. While a sequence of\nequidistant control pulses (CPMG) has been ubiquitously used for decoupling,\nUhrig recently proposed that a non-equidistant pulse sequence (UDD) may enhance\nDD performance, especially for systems where the spectral density of the\nenvironment has a sharp frequency cutoff.

Dynamic ac susceptibility measurements showed a thermally\nactivated N\\'eel-Brown dependence of the blocking temperature with applied\nfrequency. Our results show that dipolar interactions are small, but\nnon-negligible, as compared to the single-particle energy barriers from\nmagnetic anisotropy. From the fit of ac susceptibility we calculated the\neffective magnetic anisotropy constant K_{eff} for 2.5 nm maghemite particles.\nAlthough interparticle interactions present in highly diluted samples do not\nappreciably modify the dynamic magnetic behavior of isolated particles, the\ncalculated magnetic anisotropy were abut one order of magnitude larger that the\nbulk materials, suggesting the existence of large surface anisotropy. Using the\nthermally activated model to fit the dynamic data yielded effective energy\nbarriers Ea = 3.5x10^{-21} J. From these data, we obtained K_{eff} = 422 kJ/m^3\nfor the single-particle effective magnetic anisotropy.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Thus it is interesting\nto ask whether the dependency on d can be moderated.\n  We answer this question negatively by proving that the canonical decision\nproblems are W[1]-hard with respect to the dimension. This is done via a\nparameterized reduction from the Clique problem. As the parameter stays linear\nin the input parameter, the results moreover imply that these problems require\n{n^\\Omega(d)} time, unless 3-Sat can be solved in {2^o(n)} time.\n  Further, we derive that testing whether a given set is an {\\epsilon}-net with\nrespect to half-spaces takes {n^\\Omega(d)} time under the same assumption.

The EBL uncertainties in our modelling based directly on the data\nare quantified, and their consequences for attenuation of very-high-energy\ngamma-rays due to pair production on the EBL are discussed. It is concluded\nthat the EBL seems well constrained from the UV to the mid-IR at an intensity\nlevel roughly matching galaxy count data. Independent efforts from IR and\ngamma-ray astronomy are needed in order to reduce the uncertainties in the\nfar-IR.\n","Comment: Contributed talk to the 25th Texas Symposium on Relativistic\n  Astrophysics, Heidelberg December 6-10, 2010; 8 pages, 3 figures.
