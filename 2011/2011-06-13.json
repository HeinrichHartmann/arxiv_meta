Despite the starkly different physical mechanism for\ngenerating fluctuations, the two-point function is identical to inflation. In\nthis paper, we further explore this concept, focusing in particular on issues\nof non-gaussianity and quantum corrections. We find that the degeneracy with\ninflation is broken at three-point level: for the simplest case of an\nexponential potential, the three-point amplitude is strongly scale dependent,\nresulting in a breakdown of perturbation theory on small scales. However, we\nshow that the perturbative breakdown can be circumvented -- and all issues\nraised in Linde et al. (arXiv:0912.0944) can be addressed -- by altering the\npotential such that power is suppressed on small scales. The resulting range of\nnearly scale invariant, gaussian modes can be as much as twelve e-folds, enough\nto span the scales probed by microwave background and large scale structure\nobservations. On smaller scales, the spectrum is not scale invariant but is\nobservationally acceptable.\n","Comment: 42 pages, 1 figure"]}]

In the radiation and dark matter\ndominated stages, the expansion of the Universe decelerates while the inflation\nand dark energy eras are accelerating regimes. So far there is no clear cut\nconnection between these accelerating periods. More intriguing, the substance\ndriving the present accelerating stage remains a mystery, and the best\navailable candidate (vacuum energy density) is plagued with the coincidence and\ncosmological constant problems. In this paper we overcome such problems through\nan alternative cosmic scenario based on gravitationally-induced particle\nproduction. The model proposed here is non-singular with the space-time\nemerging from a pure initial de Sitter stage thereby providing a natural\nsolution to the horizon problem. Subsequently, due to an instability provoked\nby the production of massless particles, the Universe evolves smoothly to the\nstandard radiation dominated era thereby ending the production of radiation as\nrequired by the conformal invariance (Parker's theorem). Next, the radiation\nbecomes subdominant with the Universe entering in the cold dark matter\ndominated era. Finally, the negative pressure associated with the creation of\ncold dark matter particles accelerates the expansion and drives the Universe to\na final de Sitter stage. The late time cosmic expansion history is exactly like\nin the standard LCDM model, however, there is no dark energy. The model evolves\nbetween two limiting (early and late time) de Sitter regimes.

We report on\na study of the kinetics of a triple-branch DNA molecule with four\nconformational states by pulling experiments with optical tweezers and\ntheoretical modelling. Three distinct force rips associated with different\ntransitions between the conformational states are observed in the folding and\nunfolding trajectories. By applying transition rate theory to a free energy\nmodel of the molecule, probability distributions for the first rupture forces\nof the different transitions are calculated. Good agreement of the theoretical\npredictions with the experimental findings is achieved. Furthermore, due to our\nspecific design of the molecule, we found a useful method to identify\npermanently frayed molecules by estimating the number of opened basepairs from\nthe measured force jump values.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 12 figures"]}]
