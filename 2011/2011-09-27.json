Our arguments involve a blend of Bayesian and frequentist reasoning,\nand are intended to complement the original case made by Gelman (2006) in\nsupport of the folded-t family of priors. First, we generalize the half-Cauchy\nprior to the wider class of hypergeometric inverted-beta priors. We derive\nexpressions for posterior moments and marginal densities when these priors are\nused for a top-level normal variance in a Bayesian hierarchical model. We go on\nto prove a proposition that, together with the results for moments and\nmarginals, allows us to characterize the frequentist risk of the Bayes\nestimators under all global-shrinkage priors in the class. These theoretical\nresults, in turn, allow us to study the frequentist properties of the\nhalf-Cauchy prior versus a wide class of alternatives. The half-Cauchy occupies\na sensible 'middle ground' within this class: it performs very well near the\norigin, but does not lead to drastic compromises in other parts of the\nparameter space. This provides an alternative, classical justification for the\nrepeated, routine use of this prior.
