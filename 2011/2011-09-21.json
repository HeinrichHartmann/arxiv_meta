Previous fast RBF methods, --,achieving at most\nO(NlogN) complexity,--, were developed using multiquadric and polyharmonic\nbasis functions. In contrast, the present method uses Gaussians with a small\nvariance (a common choice in particle methods for fluid simulation, our main\ntarget application). The fast decay of the Gaussian basis function allows rapid\nconvergence of the iterative solver even when the subdomains in the RASM are\nvery small. The present method was implemented in parallel using the PETSc\nlibrary (developer version). Numerical experiments demonstrate its capability\nin problems of RBF interpolation with more than 50 million data points, timing\nat 106 seconds (19 iterations for an error tolerance of 10^-15 on 1024\nprocessors of a Blue Gene/L (700 MHz PowerPC processors). The parallel code is\nfreely available in the open-source model.\n","Comment: Submitted to Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering"]}]

The model predicts that the sudden acceleration of\nthe nearby ring causes a slight increase in the inertial mass of the gyroscope,\nand, to conserve momentum in the reference frame of the spinning Earth, the\ngyroscope rotates clockwise with an acceleration ratio of 1.8+/-0.25x10^-8 in\nagreement with the observed ratio.

We find that because of competing cubic material\nnonlinearities compression can only occur in the nonstationary regime, where\ngroup-velocity mismatch induced Raman-like nonlocal effects prevent compression\nto below 100 fs. However, the strong group velocity dispersion implies that the\npulses can achieve moderate compression to sub-130 fs duration in available\ncrystal lengths. Most of the pulse energy is conserved because the compression\nis moderate. The effects of diffraction and spatial walk-off is addressed, and\nin particular the latter could become an issue when compressing in such long\ncrystals (around 10 cm long).

For those neutrinos which are massless at the tree level after this\naddition, this implies a small mass generated at the two-loop level via\n$W^{\\pm}$ exchange. We calculate these mass corrections exactly by obtaining an\nanalytic form for the general case of $n$ doublets and $m$ singlets. As a\nphenomenological application, we consider the $m=1$ case and examine the masses\nand mixings of the doublet neutrinos which arise as a result of the two-loop\ncorrection in the light of experimental data from two sources which may shed\nlight on the question of neutrino masses. These are(a) the neutrino detectors\nreporting a solar neutrino deficit (and its resolution via\nMikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein matter oscillations), and\n  (b) the COBE satellite data on the non-zero angular variations of the cosmic\nmicrowave background temperature (and its possible implications for hot dark\nmatter). Within the framework of the extension considered here, which leaves\nthe gauge group structure of the Standard Model intact, we show that it is\npossible for neutrinos to acquire small masses naturally, with values which are\ncompatible with current theoretical bias and experimental data.\n","Comment: 24 pages, Two figures, attached as postscript files at the end,\n  Latex, CTP-TAMU-76/93, MRI-PHY-12/93, LTH-326"]}]
