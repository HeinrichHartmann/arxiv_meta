One\ndifficulty introduced by such systems is the lack of an invariant measure,\nneeded to define a statistical distribution. Based on a recent discovery that a\nnon-Hamiltonian system defined by a set of stochastic differential equations\ncan be mapped to a Hamiltonian system, we develop such general projection\nformalism. In the resulting generalized Langevin equations, a set of\ngeneralized fluctuation-dissipation relations connect the memory kernel and the\nrandom noise terms, analogous to Hamiltonian systems obeying detailed balance.\nLacking of these relations restricts previous application of the generalized\nLangevin formalism. Result of this work may serve as the theoretical basis for\nfurther technical developments on model reconstruction with reduced degrees of\nfreedom.

The\napproach is general and can be applied to any density of a single random\nvariable.

The technique is an extension of the Berg-Harris method [B.A. Berg and\nR.C. Harris, Comp. Phys.

It is shown that the issues of poor sampling\ndue to a Jacobian factor can be resolved using a biased resampling scheme,\nwhile the requirement of a large number of Fourier modes is mitigated through\nan automated piecewise construction approach. The method is demonstrated by\nanalyzing the radial distribution functions in an energy-discretized water\nmodel.

The\ncore challenge for homecare design is to perceive the environment and assess\noccurring situations, thus allowing systems to behave intelligently according\nto the user's intent.

Unlike traditional Wi-Fi networks, with each access point\n(AP) connected to the wired network, in WMNs only a subset of the APs are\nrequired to be connected to the wired network. The APs that are connected to\nthe wired network are called the Internet gateways (IGWs), while the APs that\ndo not have wired connections are called the mesh routers (MRs). The MRs are\nconnected to the IGWs using multi-hop communication. The IGWs provide access to\nconventional clients and interconnect ad hoc, sensor, cellular, and other\nnetworks to the Internet. However, most of the existing routing protocols for\nWMNs are extensions of protocols originally designed for mobile ad hoc networks\n(MANETs) and thus they perform sub-optimally. Moreover, most routing protocols\nfor WMNs are designed without security issues in mind, where the nodes are all\nassumed to be honest. In practical deployment scenarios, this assumption does\nnot hold. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of security issues in\nWMNs and then particularly focuses on secure routing in these networks.
