In conventional superconductors where the chemical potential\nis of the order of the Fermi energy of a non-interacting Fermi gas, there is a\nlarge number of subgap states and the mini-gap towards the lowest of these\nstates is a small fraction of the Fermi energy. It is therefore difficult to\ncool the system to below the mini-gap and at experimentally available\ntemperatures, transitions between the subgap states, including the zero modes,\nwill occur and can alter the quantum states of the zero-modes.

The nature of the burning depends on the turbulent Damkohler\nnumber (Da), which steadily declines from much greater than one to less that\none as the density decreases to a few 10^6 g/cc. Scaling arguments predict that\nthe turbulent flame speed s, normalized by the turbulent intensity u, follows\ns/u=Da^1/2 for Da<1. The flame in this regime is a single turbulently-broadened\nstructure that moves at a steady speed, and has a width larger than the\nintegral scale of the turbulence. The scaling is predicted to break down at\nDa=1, and the flame burns as a turbulently-broadened effective unity Lewis\nnumber flame. We refer to this kind of flame as a lambda-flame. The burning\nbecomes a collection of lambda-flames spread over a region approximately the\nsize of the integral scale. While the total burning rate continues to have a\nwell-defined average, s_{T} ~ u, the burning is unsteady. We present a\ntheoretical framework, supported by both 1D and 3D numerical simulations, for\nthe burning in these two regimes. Our results indicate that the average value\nof s can actually be roughly twice u for Da>1, and that localized excursions to\nas much as five times u can occur. The lambda-flame speed and width can be\npredicted based on the turbulence in the star and the turbulent nuclear burning\ntime scale of the fuel. We propose a practical method for measuring these based\non the scaling relations and small-scale computationally-inexpensive\nsimulations.

Among the\ncompartmental models used to describe epidemics, the\nSusceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model has been widely used. In the SIS\nmodel, each node can be susceptible, become infected with a given infection\nrate, and become again susceptible with a given curing rate. In this paper, we\nadd a new compartment to the classic SIS model to account for human response to\nepidemic spread. Each individual can be infected, susceptible, or alert.\nSusceptible individuals can become alert with an alerting rate if infected\nindividuals exist in their neighborhood. An individual in the alert state is\nless probable to become infected than an individual in the susceptible state;\ndue to a newly adopted cautious behavior.

We\nanalytically show that our model exhibits two distinct thresholds in the\ndynamics of epidemic spread. Below the first threshold, infection dies out\nexponentially. Beyond the second threshold, infection persists in the steady\nstate. Between the two thresholds, the infection spreads at the first stage but\nthen dies out asymptotically as the result of increased alertness in the\nnetwork.

Deconvolution of equilibrium\ndistributions, filtering out the influence of the linkers, is a straightforward\nand common practice.

Our\nmethod determines the intrinsic linear response functions of a given molecule\nin the network, describing the power spectrum of conformational fluctuations.\nThe practicality of our approach is demonstrated for the particular case of a\nprotein linked via DNA handles to two optically trapped beads at constant\nstretching force, which we mimic through Brownian dynamics simulations. Each\nwell in the protein free energy landscape (corresponding to folded, unfolded,\nor possibly intermediate states) will have its own characteristic equilibrium\nfluctuations. The associated linear response function is rich in physical\ncontent, since it depends both on the shape of the well and its diffusivity---a\nmeasure of the internal friction arising from such processes like the transient\nbreaking and reformation of bonds in the protein structure. Starting from the\nautocorrelation functions of the equilibrium bead fluctuations measured in this\nforce clamp setup, we show how an experimentalist can accurately extract the\nstate-dependent protein diffusivity using a straightforward two-step procedure.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 3 figures + supplementary material 14 pages, 4 figures"]}]

We also analyze both the harmonic map heatflow and Schrodinger\nmap flow limit cases. All asymptotic results are verified by detailed numerical\nexperiments, as well as a robust topological argument. The key result of this\npaper is that blowup solutions to these problems are co-dimension one and hence\nboth unstable and non-generic. Solutions permitted to deviate from radial\nsymmetry remain global for all time but may, for suitable initial data,\napproach arbitrarily close to blowup. A careful asymptotic analysis of\nsolutions near blowup shows that finite-time blowup corresponds to a saddle\nfixed point in a low dimensional dynamical system. Radial symmetry precludes\nmotion anywhere but on the stable manifold towards blowup. A similar scenario\nemerges in the equivariant setting: blowup is unstable. To be more precise,\nblowup is co-dimension one both within the equivariant symmetry class and in\nthe unrestricted class of initial data. The value of the parameter in the\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation plays a very subdued role in the analysis of\nequivariant blowup, leading to identical blowup rates and spatial scales for\nall parameter values. One notable exception is the angle between solution in\ninner scale (which bubbles off) and outer scale (which remains), which does\ndepend on parameter values. Analyzing near-blowup solutions, we find that in\nthe inner scale these solution quickly rotate over an angle {\\pi}. As a\nconsequence, for the blowup solution it is natural to consider a continuation\nscenario after blowup where one immediately re-attaches a sphere (thus\nrestoring the energy lost in blowup), yet rotated over an angle {\\pi}. This\ncontinuation is natural since it leads to continuous dependence on initial\ndata.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 13 figures"]}]
