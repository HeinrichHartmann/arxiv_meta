We formulate a\nsystematic theoretical framework of entropy-based statistical mechanics for\nspherically symmetric collisionless self-gravitating systems. We use an\napproach that is very different from that of the conventional statistical\nmechanics of short-range interaction systems. We demonstrate that the\nequilibrium states of self-gravitating systems consist of both mechanical and\nstatistical equilibria, with the former characterized by a series of\nvelocity-moment equations and the latter by statistical equilibrium equations,\nwhich should be derived from the entropy principle. The velocity-moment\nequations of all orders are derived from the steady-state collisionless\nBoltzmann equation. We point out that the ergodicity is invalid for the whole\nself-gravitating systems, but it can be re-established locally. Based on the\nlocal ergodicity, using Fermi-Dirac-like statistics, with the nondegenerate\ncondition and the spatial independence of the local microstates, we rederive\nthe Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy. This is consistent with the validity of the\ncollisionless Boltzmann equation, and should be the correct entropy form for\ncollisionless self-gravitating systems. Apart from the usual constraints of\nmass and energy conservation, we demonstrate that the series of moment or\nvirialization equations must be included as additional constraints on the\nentropy functional when performing the variational calculus; this is an\nextension to the original prescription by White & Narayan. Any possible\nvelocity distribution can be produced by the statistical-mechanical approach\nthat we have developed with the extended Boltzmann-Gibbs/White-Narayan\nstatistics.

A single gene with negative transcriptional\nfeedback needs a time delay and sufficiently strong nonlinearity in the\ntransmission of the feedback signal in order to produce biochemical rhythms. A\nsingle gene with only positive transcriptional feedback does not produce\noscillations. Here, we demonstrate that this single-gene network in conjunction\nwith a simple negative interaction can also easily produce rhythms. We examine\na model comprised of two well-differentiated parts. The first is a positive\nfeedback created by a protein that binds to the promoter of its own gene and\nactivates the transcription. The second is a negative interaction in which a\nrepressor molecule prevents this protein from binding to its promoter. A\nstochastic study shows that the system is robust to noise. A deterministic\nstudy identifies that the dynamics of the oscillator are mainly driven by two\ntypes of biomolecules: the protein, and the complex formed by the repressor and\nthis protein. The main conclusion of this paper is that a simple and usual\nnegative interaction, such as degradation, sequestration or inhibition, acting\non the positive transcriptional feedback of a single gene is a sufficient\ncondition to produce reliable oscillations. One gene is enough and the positive\ntranscriptional feedback signal does not need to activate a second repressor\ngene. This means that at the genetic level an explicit negative feedback loop\nis not necessary. The model needs neither cooperative binding reactions nor the\nformation of protein multimers.

In our presentation we will start with a basic case of\na simple spectral data collection. Then we will describe several examples of\nsmall\" technologically advanced VO resources built in CDS and VO-Paris and will\nshow that many standards are hidden from managers' eyes at the initial stage of\nthe project development. The projects will be: (1) the GalMer database\nproviding access to the results of numerical simulations of galaxy\ninteractions; (2) the full spectrum fitting service that allows one to extract\ninternal kinematics and stellar populations from spectra of galaxies available\nin the VO. We conclude that: (a) with the existing set of IVOA standards one\ncan already build very advanced VO-enabled archives and tools useful for\nscientists; (b) managers have to be very careful when estimating the project\ndevelopment timelines for VO-enabled resources.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures, to appear in the proceedings of ADASS-XXI\n  (Astronomical Data Analysis Software and Systems)"]}]
