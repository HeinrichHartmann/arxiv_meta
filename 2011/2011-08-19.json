The model is compared with\nhigh-resolution three-dimensional numerical simulations, both in a uniform\nenvironment, and in a full-star setting. The simulations in a uniform\nenvironment present compelling agreement with the predicted power-laws and\nprovide model constants for the full-star model, which then provides excellent\nagreement with the full-star simulation. The importance of the different\ncomponents in the model are compared, and are all shown to be relevant. An\nexamination of the effect of initial conditions was then conducted using the\none-dimensional model, which would have been infeasible in three dimensions.\nMore mass was burned when the ignition kernel was larger and closer to the\ncenter of the star. The turbulent flame speed was found to be important during\nthe early-time evolution of the thermal, but played a diminished role at later\ntimes when the evolution is dominated by the large-scale hydrodynamics\nresponsible for entrainment. However, a higher flame speed effectively gave a\nlarger initial ignition kernel and so resulted in more mass burned. This\nsuggests that future studies should focus on the early-time behavior of these\nthermals (in particular, the transition to turbulence), and that the choice of\nturbulent flame speed does not play a significant role in the dynamics once the\nthermal has become established.\n"]}]

Our approach includes radiative heating\nand cooling, the growth of cold clouds embedded in an ambient hot medium, star\nformation in these clouds, feedback from supernovae in the form of thermal\nheating and cloud evaporation, galactic winds and outflows, and metal\nenrichment. Implemented using SPH, our scheme is a significantly modified and\nextended version of the grid-based method of Yepes et al.

We\ndiscuss properties of the feedback model in detail and show that it predicts a\nself-regulated, quiescent mode of star formation, which, in particular,\nstabilises the star forming gaseous layers of disk galaxies. The\nparameterisation of this mode can be reduced to a single free quantity which\ndetermines the overall timescale for star formation. We fix this parameter to\nmatch the observed rates of star formation in local disk galaxies. When\nnormalised in this manner, cosmological simulations nevertheless overproduce\nthe observed cosmic abundance of stellar material. We are thus motivated to\nextend our feedback model to include galactic winds associated with star\nformation. Using small-scale simulations of individual star-forming disk\ngalaxies, we show that these winds produce either galactic fountains or\noutflows, depending on the depth of the gravitational potential.

With this theorem in mind, we\ninvestigate commutative diassociative loops satisfying the additional condition\n(trivially satisfied in the abelian group case) that all $n$th powers are\ncentral, for a fixed $n$. For $n=2$, we get precisely commutative $C$ loops.\nFor $n=3$, a prominent variety is that of commutative Moufang loops.\n  Many analogies between commutative C and Moufang loops have been noted in the\nliterature, often obtained by interchanging the role of the primes 2 and 3. We\nshow that the correct encompassing variety for these two classes of loops is\nthe variety of commutative RIF loops. In particular, when $Q$ is a commutative\nRIF loop: all squares in $Q$ are Moufang elements, all cubes are $C$ elements,\nMoufang elements of $Q$ form a normal subloop $M_0(Q)$ such that $Q/M_0(Q)$ is\na C loop of exponent 2 (a Steiner loop), C elements of $L$ form a normal\nsubloop $C_0(Q)$ such that $Q/C_0(Q)$ is a Moufang loop of exponent 3. Since\nsquares (resp. cubes) are central in commutative C (resp. Moufang) loops, it\nfollows that $Q$ modulo its center is of exponent 6. Returning to the\ndecomposition theorem, we find that every torsion, commutative RIF loop is a\ndirect product of a C 2-loop, a Moufang 3-loop, and an abelian group with each\nelement of order prime to 6.\n  We also discuss Moufang elements, and a class of quasigroups associated with\ncommutative RIF loops.\n","Comment: 13 pages, amsart"]}]
