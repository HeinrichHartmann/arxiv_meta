Such a trend, called the 'SSFR downsizing' (SSFR-DS) phenomenon, is seen\nfor local and high-z (back to z~1-2) galaxy samples. We use observational data\nrelated only to disc galaxies and explore the average SSFR change with z for\ndifferent masses. For Ms in the range ~10^9.5-10^10.5 Msun, the SSFR increases\nwith (1+z) to a power that barely depends on Ms, and at all z's smaller\ngalaxies have ever higher SSFRs. The latter strongly disagree with the LCDM\nhierarchical mass accretion rates. By means of self-consistent models of disc\ngalaxy evolution inside growing LCDM halos, the effects that disc\nfeedback-driven outflows and gas re-accretion have on the galaxy SSFR histories\nare explored. The parameters of the outflow and re-accretion schemes are tuned\nto reproduce the z~0 Mh-Ms relation inferred from observations. In the case of\noutflows only, the SSFR of individual model galaxies is roughly proportional to\n(1+z)^2.2 for all the masses with a normalization factor that depends on mass\nas Ms^0.1, i.e more massive galaxies have slightly larger SSFRs, contrary to\nthe observed strong SSFR-DS trend. For the re-accretion cases, the dependence\non z remains approximately the same as without re-infall, but the correlation\non Ms even increases for most of the reasonable values of the model parameters.\nThe comparison of models and observations in the SSFR-Ms plane at z~0 shows the\ndivergent trend in SSFR as lower are the masses (upsizing vs downsizing). We\nexplain why the models show the reported trends, and conclude that the SSFR-DS\nfor low-mass galaxies poses a challenge for LCDM-based disc galaxy evolution\nmodels.

Since 1998, only half a dozen spectroscopically confirmed associations\nhave been discovered and XRF 100316D associated with the type-Ic SN 2010bh at z\n= 0.059 is among the latest. We began observations with GROND 12 hours after\nthe GRB trigger and continued until 80 days after the burst. GROND provided\nexcellent photometric data in six filter bands covering a wavelength range from\napprox. 350 to 1800 nm, significantly expanding the pre-existing data set for\nthis event. Combining GROND and Swift data, the early broad-band SED is\nmodelled with a blackbody and afterglow component attenuated by dust and gas\nabsorption. The best-fit SED models imply moderate reddening along the line of\nsight through the host galaxy (A_V = 1.2 \\pm 0.1 mag).

One possibility is to balance decay modes of\nmembranes and synapses with recurrent excitation. To allow integration over\nlong timescales, however, this balance must be precise; this is known as the\nfine tuning problem. The need for fine tuning can be overcome via a\nratchet-like mechanism, in which momentary inputs must be above a preset limit\nto be registered by the circuit. The degree of this ratcheting embodies a\ntradeoff between sensitivity to the input stream and robustness against\nparameter mistuning.\n  The goal of our study is to analyze the consequences of this tradeoff for\ndecision making performance. For concreteness, we focus on the well-studied\nrandom dot motion discrimination task. For stimulus parameters constrained by\nexperimental data, we find that loss of sensitivity to inputs has surprisingly\nlittle cost for decision performance. This leads robust integrators to\nperformance gains when feedback becomes mistuned. Moreover, we find that\nsubstantially robust and mistuned integrator models remain consistent with\nchronometric and accuracy functions found in experiments. We explain our\nfindings via sequential analysis of the momentary and integrated signals, and\ndiscuss their implication: robust integrators may be surprisingly well-suited\nto subserve the basic function of evidence integration in many cognitive tasks.\n"]}]

Assuming that S drifts to -infinity and that its\nincrements (jumps) are heavy-tailed (in a sense made precise in the paper), we\nexhibit natural conditions under which the asymptotics of the tail distribution\nof the overall maximum of S can be computed. We present results in discrete and\nin continuous time. In particular, in the absence of modulation, the process S\nin continuous time reduces to a Levy process with heavy-tailed Levy measure. A\ncentral point of the paper is that we make full use of the so-called\n``principle of a single big jump'' in order to obtain both upper and lower\nbounds. Thus, the proofs are entirely probabilistic. The paper is motivated by\nqueueing and Levy stochastic networks.\n","Comment: 29 pages"]}]

More specifically, the\npaths being considered have fixed start and end points on respectively the\nlower and right boundaries of a rectangle in the square lattice, each path can\ntake only unit steps rightwards or upwards, and two different paths are\npermitted to share lattice points, but not to cross or share lattice edges.\nSuch paths correspond to configurations of the six-vertex model of statistical\nmechanics with appropriate boundary conditions, and they include cases which\ncorrespond to alternating sign matrices and various subclasses thereof.\nReferring to points of the rectangle through which no or two paths pass as\nvacancies or osculations respectively, the case of primary interest is tuples\nof paths with a fixed number $l$ of vacancies and osculations. It is then shown\nthat there exist natural bijections which map each such path tuple $P$ to a\npair $(t,\\eta)$, where $\\eta$ is an oscillating tableau of length $l$ (i.e., a\nsequence of $l+1$ partitions, starting with the empty partition, in which the\nYoung diagrams of successive partitions differ by a single square), and $t$ is\na certain, compatible sequence of $l$ weakly increasing positive integers.\nFurthermore, each vacancy or osculation of $P$ corresponds to a partition in\n$\\eta$ whose Young diagram is obtained from that of its predecessor by\nrespectively the addition or deletion of a square.
