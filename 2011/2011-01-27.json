The unified\nsequence of blazar spectral energy distribution (SED) is taken into account to\nmake a non-trivial prediction for the EGRB spectrum and more realistic\ncomparison with the data than previous studies. We then try to explain the EGRB\ndata by the two AGN populations: one is blazars, and the other is non-blazar\nAGNs that are responsible for the EGRB in the MeV band. We find that ~80% of\nthe EGRB photon flux at > 100 MeV can be explained by the sum of the two\npopulations, while ~45% can be accounted for only by blazars. The predicted\nEGRB spectrum is in agreement with a wide range of the observed data from X-ray\nto GeV, within the systematic uncertainties in the EGRB determination by EGRET.\nThese results indicate that AGNs including blazars are the primary source of\nEGRB. Blazars are dominant in EGRB at higher energy bands of >100 MeV, while\nnon-blazar AGNs dominate at <100 MeV. Almost all of the EGRB flux from blazars\nwill be resolved into discrete sources by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope,\nwhile that from non-blazar AGNs will largely remain unresolved. Therefore,\ncomparison between the integrated source counts and diffuse EGRB flux as a\nfunction of photon energy will give a simple and clear test of our model.\nVarious quantitative predictions for Fermi observations are also made.\nEspecially, our model predicts 600-1200 blazars in all sky down to 2e-9\nphotons/cm^-2/s (>100 MeV), which is considerably smaller than most of previous\nstudies.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 10 figures, revised version, accepted for publication in\n  ApJ"]}]

In this paper we present\ntime-dependent hydrodynamic calculations of nucleosynthesis in the NDW which\ninclude accurate weak interaction physics coupled to a full nuclear reaction\nnetwork. Using two published models of PNS neutrino luminosities, we predict\nthe contribution of the NDW to the integrated nucleosynthetic yield of the\nentire supernova. For the neutrino luminosity histories considered, no true\nr-process occurs in the most basic scenario. The wind driven from an older $1.4\nM_\\odot$ model for a PNS is moderately neutron-rich at late times however, and\nproduces $^{87}$Rb, $^{88}$Sr, $^{89}$Y, and $^{90}$Zr in near solar\nproportions relative to oxygen. The wind from a more recently studied $1.27\nM_\\odot$ PNS is proton-rich throughout its entire evolution and does not\ncontribute significantly to the abundance of any element. It thus seems very\nunlikely that the simplest model of the NDW can produce the r-process. At most,\nit contributes to the production of the N = 50 closed shell elements and some\nlight p-nuclei.

We\nsimulate lattice QCD with 2 and 3 flavours of colour-sextet staggered quarks at\nfinite temperatures to determine the scales of confinement and chiral-symmetry\nbreaking from the positions of the deconfinement and chiral-symmetry\nrestoration transitions.

However, for the chiral transition, the increase in beta between\nTa=1/4 and Ta=1/6 is much larger than the increase between Ta=1/6 and Ta=1/8.\nThis suggests that between Ta=1/4 and Ta=1/6 we are at strong coupling where\nthe theory is effectively quenched, while between Ta=1/6 and Ta=1/8 we are\nemerging into the weak coupling regime. It will require even smaller Ta values\nto determine whether the running of the chiral-transition coupling is\ncontrolled by asymptotic freedom and the theory walks, or if it reaches a\nnon-zero limit when the transition becomes a bulk transition and the theory is\nconformal. The 3 flavour case at Ta=1/4 and Ta=1/6 behaves similarly to the 2\nflavour case.

Here, we consider the\npossibility that spacetime could be simultaneously continuous and discrete, in\nthe same mathematical way that information can be simultaneously continuous and\ndiscrete. The equivalence of continuous and discrete information, which is of\nkey importance in information theory, is established by Shannon sampling\ntheory: of any bandlimited signal it suffices to record discrete samples to be\nable to perfectly reconstruct it everywhere, if the samples are taken at a rate\nof at least twice the bandlimit. It is known that physical fields on generic\ncurved spaces obey a sampling theorem if they possess an ultraviolet cutoff.\nMost recently, methods of spectral geometry have been employed to show that\nalso the very shape of a curved space (i.e., of a Riemannian manifold) can be\ndiscretely sampled and then reconstructed up to the cutoff scale. Here, we\ndevelop these results further, and we here also consider the generalization to\ncurved spacetimes, i.e., to Lorentzian manifolds.\n"]}]

The\nneighbourhood function provides a wealth of information about the graph (e.g.,\nit easily allows one to compute its diameter), but it is very expensive to\ncompute it exactly. Recently, the ANF algorithm (approximate neighbourhood\nfunction) has been proposed with the purpose of approximating NG(t) on large\ngraphs. We describe a breakthrough improvement over ANF in terms of speed and\nscalability. Our algorithm, called HyperANF, uses the new HyperLogLog counters\nand combines them efficiently through broadword programming; our implementation\nuses overdecomposition to exploit multi-core parallelism. With HyperANF, for\nthe first time we can compute in a few hours the neighbourhood function of\ngraphs with billions of nodes with a small error and good confidence using a\nstandard workstation. Then, we turn to the study of the distribution of the\nshortest paths between reachable nodes (that can be efficiently approximated by\nmeans of HyperANF), and discover the surprising fact that its index of\ndispersion provides a clear-cut characterisation of proper social networks vs.\nweb graphs. We thus propose the spid (Shortest-Paths Index of Dispersion) of a\ngraph as a new, informative statistics that is able to discriminate between the\nabove two types of graphs. We believe this is the first proposal of a\nsignificant new non-local structural index for complex networks whose\ncomputation is highly scalable.\n"]}]

Elastic scattering is viewed as due to two processes: a) diffraction\nscattering originating from cloud-cloud interaction; b) a hard or large |t|\nscattering originating from one nucleon core scattering off the other via\nvector meson omega exchange, while their outer clouds interact independently.\nThe omega-exchange amplitude shows that omega behaves like an elementary vector\nmeson at high energy, contrary to a regge pole behavior. This behavior,\nhowever, can be understood in the nonlinear sigma-model where omega couples to\na topological baryonic current like a gauge boson, and the nucleon is described\nas a topological soliton. Further investigation shows that the underlying\neffective field theory model is a gauged linear sigma-model that has not only\nthe pion sector and the Wess-Zumino-Witten action of the nonlinear sigma-model,\nbut also a quark-scalar sector. The nucleon structure that emerges is that the\nnucleon has an outer cloud of quark-antiquark condensed ground state, an inner\ncore of topological baryonic charge probed by omega, and a still smaller\nquark-bag containing massless valence quarks.

(The theory is constructive in that, operators\nacting at different times, actually commute.) We first develop an operator\nversion of the Henstock-Kurzweil integral, and a new Hilbert space that allows\nus to construct the elementary path integral in the manner originally\nenvisioned by Feynman. After developing our time-ordered operator theory we\nextend a few of the important theorems of semigroup theory, including the\nHille-Yosida theorem. As an application, we unify and extend the theory of\ntime-dependent parabolic and hyperbolic evolution equations. We then develop a\ngeneral perturbation theory and use it to prove that all theories generated by\nsemigroups are asympotic in the operator-valued sense of Poincare. This allows\nus to provide a general theory for the interaction representation of\nrelativistic quantum theory. We then show that our theory can be reformulated\nas a physically motivated sum over paths, and use this version to extend the\nFeynman path integral to include more general interactions. Our approach is\nindependent of the space of continuous functions and thus makes the question of\nthe existence of a measure more of a natural expectation than a death blow to\nthe foundations for the Feynman integral.\n","Comment: Corrected version, accepted for publication in Expositiones\n  Mathematicae"]}]
