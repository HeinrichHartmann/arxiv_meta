The\ncoefficients of the large N expansion of the logarithm of this partition\nfunction,also known as the genus expansion, (and its derivatives) are\ngenerating functions for a variety of graphical enumeration problems. The main\nresults are to prove that these generating functions are in fact specific\nrational functions of a distinguished irrational (algebraic) function of the\ngenerating function parameters. This distinguished function is itself the\ngenerating function for the Catalan numbers (or generalized Catalan numbers,\ndepending on the choice of parameter). It is also a solution of the inviscid\nBurgers equation for certain initial data. The shock formation, or caustic, of\nthe Burgers characteristic solution is directly related to the poles of the\nrational forms of the generating functions.\n  These results in turn provide new information about the asymptotics of\nrecurrence coefficients for orthogonal polynomials with respect to exponential\nweights. One gains new insights into the relation between certain derivatives\nof the genus expansion and the asymptotic expansion of the first Painleve\ntranscendent, related to the double-scaling limit. This work provides a precise\nexpression of the Painleve asymptotic coefficients directly in terms of the\ncoefficients of the partial fractions expansion of the rational form of the\ngenerating functions established here. Moreover, these insights point toward a\nmore general program relating the first Painleve hierarchy and the higher order\nstructure of the double-scaling limit to the specific rational structure of\ngenerating functions.\n","Comment: version 2 has expanded introduction and added appendices"]}]

The observed temperature\ndependences of resistivity were typical for metallic transport of electrons\nexcept temperature dependence of resistivity of the In$_2$O$_3$:Sn film\ndeposited in the oxygen deficient atmosphere. The electron concentration and\nmobility for the film deposited at 230$^\\circ$C was larger than that for the\nfilm deposited nominally at room temperature. Short (5 minutes) treatment of\nthe films in hydrogen plasma leads to the enhancement of electrical\nconductivity while longer (30 minute) treatment has the opposite effect. The\nelectrical measurements were accompanied by AFM and SEM studies of structural\nproperties, as well as by XPS analysis. Basic on structural and electrical\nmeasurements we conclude the reduction process initiated by the hydrogen plasma\nprovides essential modification of the ITO films surface. At the same time,\nelectrical properties of the remaining (located beneath the surface layer)\nparts of the ITO films remain mostly unchangeable. XPS analysis shows that\ngrown in situ oxygen deficient ITO films have enhanced DOS between the Fermi\nlevel and the valence band edge. The extra localized states behave as acceptors\nleading to a compensation of $n$-type ITO. That can explain lower $n$-type\nconductivity in this material crossing over to a Mott-type hopping.\n","Comment: Submitted to the Journal of Applied Physics"]}]

In this paper we prove Chapoton's\nconjecture on the duality formula: Q_n(x,y,z,t)=Q_n(x+nz+nt,y,-t,-z), and\nanswer his question about the combinatorial interpretation of Q_n. Actually we\ngive combinatorial interpretations of these polynomials in terms of plane\ntrees, half-mobile trees, and forests of plane trees. Our approach also leads\nto a general formula that unifies several known results for enumerating trees\nand plane trees.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 2 tables, 8 figures, see also\n  http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~guo"]}]
