Dimensionality reduction is thus needed, but it is often\nperformed using a univariate feature selection procedure, that handles neither\nthe spatial structure of the images, nor the multivariate nature of the signal.\nBy introducing a hierarchical clustering of the brain volume that incorporates\nconnectivity constraints, we reduce the span of the possible spatial\nconfigurations to a single tree of nested regions tailored to the signal. We\nthen prune the tree in a supervised setting, hence the name supervised\nclustering, in order to extract a parcellation (division of the volume) such\nthat parcel-based signal averages best predict the target information.\nDimensionality reduction is thus achieved by feature agglomeration, and the\nconstructed features now provide a multi-scale representation of the signal.\nComparisons with reference methods on both simulated and real data show that\nour approach yields higher prediction accuracy than standard voxel-based\napproaches.

In this view a theory is scientific if\nit can be used to build a data compression program, and it is valuable if it\ncan compress a standard benchmark database to a small size, taking into account\nthe length of the compressor itself. This methodology therefore includes an\nOccam principle as well as a solution to the problem of demarcation. Because of\nthe fundamental difficulty of lossless compression, this type of research must\nbe empirical in nature: compression can only be achieved by discovering and\ncharacterizing empirical regularities in the data. Because of this, the\nphilosophy provides a way to reformulate fields such as computer vision and\ncomputational linguistics as empirical sciences: the former by attempting to\ncompress databases of natural images, the latter by attempting to compress\nlarge text databases. The book argues that the rigor and objectivity of the\ncompression principle should set the stage for systematic progress in these\nfields. The argument is especially strong in the context of computer vision,\nwhich is plagued by chronic problems of evaluation.\n  The book also considers the field of machine learning. Here the traditional\napproach requires that the models proposed to solve learning problems be\nextremely simple, in order to avoid overfitting. However, the world may contain\nintrinsically complex phenomena, which would require complex models to\nunderstand. The compression philosophy can justify complex models because of\nthe large quantity of data being modeled (if the target database is 100 Gb, it\nis easy to justify a 10 Mb model). The complex models and abstractions learned\non the basis of the raw data (images, language, etc) can then be reused to\nsolve any specific learning problem, such as face recognition or machine\ntranslation.\n","Comment: Draft Version"]}]

We aim to measure\nthe evolution of the merger rate for both luminosity/mass selected galaxy\nsamples and investigate its dependence with the local environment. We use a\nsample of 10644 spectroscopically observed galaxies from the zCOSMOS redshift\nsurvey to identify pairs of galaxies destined to merge, using only pairs for\nwhich the velocity difference and projected separation of both components with\na confirmed spectroscopic redshift indicate a high probability of merging. We\nhave identified 263 spectroscopically confirmed pairs with r_p^{max} = 100\nh^{-1} kpc. We find that the density of mergers depends on luminosity/mass,\nbeing higher for fainter/less massive galaxies, while the number of mergers a\ngalaxy will experience does not depends significantly on its intrinsic\nluminosity but rather on its stellar mass. We find that the pair fraction and\nmerger rate increase with local galaxy density, a property observed up to\nredshift z=1. We find that the dependence of the merger rate on the luminosity\nor mass of galaxies is already present up to redshifts z=1, and that the\nevolution of the volumetric merger rate of bright (massive) galaxies is\nrelatively flat with redshift with a mean value of 3*10^{-4} (8*10^{-5}\nrespectively) mergers h^3 Mpc^{-3} Gyr^{-1}. The dependence of the merger rate\nwith environment indicates that dense environments favors major merger events\nas can be expected from the hierarchical scenario.
