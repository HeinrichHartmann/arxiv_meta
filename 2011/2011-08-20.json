In particular, the Power-law\ndegree distribution has long been used to model the structure of online social\nnetworks, and is the basis for algorithms and heuristics in graph applications\nsuch as influence maximization and social search. Along with recent measurement\nresults, our interest in this topic was sparked by our own experimental results\non social graphs that deviated significantly from those predicted by a\nPower-law model. In this work, we seek a deeper understanding of these\ndeviations, and propose an alternative model with significant implications on\ngraph algorithms and applications. We start by quantifying this artifact using\na variety of real social graphs, and show that their structures cannot be\naccurately modeled using elementary distributions including the Power-law.\nInstead, we propose the Pareto-Lognormal (PLN) model, verify its\ngoodness-of-fit using graphical and statistical methods, and present an\nanalytical study of its asymptotical differences with the Power-law. To\ndemonstrate the quantitative benefits of the PLN model, we compare the results\nof three wide-ranging graph applications on real social graphs against those on\nsynthetic graphs generated using the PLN and Power-law models. We show that\nsynthetic graphs generated using PLN are much better predictors of degree\ndistributions in real graphs, and produce experimental results with errors that\nare orders-of-magnitude smaller than those produced by the Power-law model.\n"]}]

Many prior work have carried out empirical studies and proposed\ndiffusion models to understand the information diffusion process in online\nsocial networks. However, most of these studies focus on the information\ndiffusion in temporal dimension, that is, how the information propagates over\ntime. Little attempt has been given on understanding information diffusion over\nboth temporal and spatial dimensions. In this paper, we propose a Partial\nDifferential Equation (PDE), specifically, a Diffusive Logistic (DL) equation\nto model the temporal and spatial characteristics of information diffusion in\nonline social networks. To be more specific, we develop a PDE-based theoretical\nframework to measure and predict the density of influenced users at a given\ndistance from the original information source after a time period. The density\nof influenced users over time and distance provides valuable insight on the\nactual information diffusion process. We present the temporal and spatial\npatterns in a real dataset collected from Digg social news site, and validate\nthe proposed DL equation in terms of predicting the information diffusion\nprocess. Our experiment results show that the DL model is indeed able to\ncharacterize and predict the process of information propagation in online\nsocial networks. For example, for the most popular news with 24,099 votes in\nDigg, the average prediction accuracy of DL model over all distances during the\nfirst 6 hours is 92.08%.
