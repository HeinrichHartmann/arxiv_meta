Based on this model and the new relativity theory an\nensemble distribution of all the dimensions of quantum spacetime is derived\nwith the help of Fermat grand theorem. The calculated average dimension is very\nclose to the value of $4+\\phi^3 $ (where $\\phi$ is the golden mean) obtained by\nEl Naschie on the basis of a different approach. It is shown that within the\nframework of the new relativity the cosmological constant problem is\nnonexistent, since the Universe self-organizes and self-tunes according to the\nrenormalization group (RG) flow with respect to a local scaling microscopic\narrow of time. This implies that the world emerged as a result of a\nnon-equilibrium process of self-organized critical phenomena launched by vacuum\nfluctuations in Cantorian fractal spacetime $\\cal E^{\\infty}$. It is shown that\nwe are living in a metastable vacuum and are moving towards a fixed point ($ D$\n= 4+$\\phi^3$) of the RG. After reaching this point, a new phase transition will\ndrive the universe to a quasi-crystal phase of the lower average dimension of\n$\\phi^3$.\n","Comment: Revised (tex,latex) file.
