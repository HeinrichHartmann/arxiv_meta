In some sources the SSC component dominates the synchrotron peak by\none or more orders of magnitude implying that the electrons mainly cool by\ninverse Compton collisions with their self-made synchrotron photons. Therefore,\nthe linear synchrotron loss of electrons, which is normally invoked in emission\nmodels, has to be replaced by a nonlinear loss rate depending on an energy\nintegral of the electron distribution. This modified electron cooling changes\nsignificantly the emerging radiation spectra. It is the purpose of this work to\napply this new cooling scenario to relativistic power-law distributed\nelectrons, which are injected instantaneously into the jet. We will first solve\nthe differential equation of the volume-averaged differential number density of\nthe electrons, and then discuss their temporal evolution.

Objects that are somewhat in between globular clusters and\nlow-mass galaxies, such as ultra-compact dwarf galaxies, have a mass-radius\nrelation consistent with the extension of the relation for bright ellipticals.\nHere we show that at an age of 10 Gyr a break in the mass-radius relation at\n~10^6 Msun is established because objects below this mass, i.e. globular\nclusters, have undergone expansion driven by stellar evolution and hard\nbinaries. From numerical simulations we find that the combined energy\nproduction of these two effects in the core comes into balance with the flux of\nenergy that is conducted across the half-mass radius by relaxation. An\nimportant property of this `balanced' evolution is that the cluster half-mass\nradius is independent of its initial value and is a function of the number of\nbound stars and the age only. It is therefore not possible to infer the initial\nmass-radius relation of globular clusters and we can only conclude that the\npresent day properties are consistent with the hypothesis that all hot stellar\nsystems formed with the same mass-radius relation and that globular clusters\nhave moved away from this relation because of a Hubble time of stellar and\ndynamical evolution.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures, MNRAS Letters (accepted)"]}]

The cascade photons arrive at the earth with angular and\ntemporal distributions correlated with the extragalactic magnetic field (EGMF).\nWe have developed a new semi-analytical model of the cascade properties which\nis more accurate than previous analytic approaches and faster than full Monte\nCarlo simulations. Within its range of applicability, our model can quickly\ngenerate cascade spectra for a variety of source emission models, EGMF\nstrengths, and assumptions about the source livetime. In this Letter, we\ndescribe the properties of the model and demonstrate its utility by exploring\nthe gamma-ray emission from the blazar RGB J0710+591. In particular, we\npredict, under various scenarios, the VHE and high-energy (HE, 100 MeV \\lesssim\nE \\lesssim 300 GeV) fluxes detectable with the VERITAS and Fermi Large Area\nTelescope (LAT) observatories. We then develop a systematic framework for\ncomparing the predictions to published results, obtaining constraints on the\nEGMF strength. At a confidence level of 95%, we find the lower limit on the\nEGMF strength to be ~ 2 \\times 10^{-16} Gauss if no limit is placed on the\nlivetime of the source or ~ 3 \\times 10^{-18} Gauss if the source livetime is\nlimited to the past ~ 3 years during which Fermi observations have taken place.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in Astrophysical Journal\n  Letters"]}]

The key issue in cooperative control of multi-agent systems is the\nsynthesis of local control and interaction rules among the agents such that the\nentire controlled system achieves a desired global behavior. For this purpose,\nthree fundamental problems have to be addressed: (1) task decomposition for\ntop-down design, such that the fulfillment of local tasks guarantees the\nsatisfaction of the global task, by the team; (2) fault-tolerant top-down\ndesign, such that the global task remains decomposable and achievable, in spite\nof some failures, and (3) design of interactions among agents to make an\nundecomposable task decomposable and achievable in a top-down framework.

A key application where this\nproblem occurs is in video surveillance where the goal is to separate a slowly\nchanging background from moving foreground objects on-the-fly. The background\nsequence is well modeled as lying in a low dimensional subspace, that can\ngradually change over time, while the moving foreground objects constitute the\ncorrelated sparse outliers. In this and many other applications, the foreground\nis an outlier for PCA but is actually the \"signal of interest\" for the\napplication; where as the background is the corruption or noise. Thus our\nproblem can also be interpreted as one of recursively recovering a time\nsequence of sparse signals in the presence of large but spatially correlated\nnoise.\n  This work has two key contributions. First, we provide a new way of looking\nat this problem and show how a key part of our solution strategy involves\nsolving a noisy compressive sensing (CS) problem. Second, we show how we can\nutilize the correlation of the outliers to our advantage in order to even deal\nwith very large support sized outliers. The main idea is as follows. The\ncorrelation model applied to the previous support estimate helps predict the\ncurrent support. This prediction serves as \"partial support knowledge\" for\nsolving the modified-CS problem instead of CS. The support estimate of the\nmodified-CS reconstruction is, in turn, used to update the correlation model\nparameters using a Kalman filter (or any adaptive filter). We call the\nresulting approach \"support-predicted modified-CS\".\n"]}]

The evolution of the\ninteracting particles is described through a time inhomogeneous transition\nprobability kernel that depends on the 'gradient' of the potential field. The\nparticles, in turn, dynamically modify the potential field through their\ncumulative input. Interacting Markov processes of the above form have been\nsuggested as models for active biological transport in response to external\nstimulus such as a chemical gradient. One of the basic mathematical challenges\nis to develop a general theory of stability for such interacting Markovian\nsystems and for the corresponding nonlinear Markov processes that arise in the\nlarge agent limit. Such a theory would be key to a mathematical understanding\nof the interactive structure formation that results from the complex feedback\nbetween the agents and the potential field. It will also be a crucial\ningredient in developing simulation schemes that are faithful to the underlying\nmodel over long periods of time. The goal of this work is to study qualitative\nproperties of the above stochastic system as the number of particles (N) and\nthe time parameter (n) approach infinity. In this regard asymptotic properties\nof a deterministic nonlinear dynamical system, that arises in the propagation\nof chaos limit of the stochastic model, play a key role. We show that under\nsuitable conditions this dynamical system has a unique fixed point. This result\nallows us to study stability properties of the underlying stochastic model. We\nshow that as N \\rightarrow \\infty, the stochastic system is well approximated\nby the dynamical system, uniformly over time. As a consequence, for an\narbitrarily initialized system, as N\\rightarrow \\infty and n \\rightarrow\n\\infty, the potential field and the empirical measure of the interacting\nparticles are shown to converge to the unique fixed point of the dynamical\nsystem. In general, simulation of such interacting Markovian systems is a\ncomputationally daunting task. We propose a particle based approximation for\nthe dynamic potential field which allows for a numerically tractable simulation\nscheme. It is shown that this simulation scheme well approximates the true\nphysical system, uniformly over an infinite time horizon.\n","Comment: 21 pages"]}]
