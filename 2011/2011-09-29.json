First, using\nsimplified smoothly-growing halo models, we demonstrate that the different\nalgorithms predict cooling rates and final cold gas masses that differ by a\nfactor of ~5 for massive haloes (>10^{12}Msun). The algorithms are in better\nagreement for less massive haloes because they cool efficiently and, therefore,\ntheir cooling rates are largely limited by the halo accretion rate. However,\nfor less massive haloes, all the SAMs predict less cooling than corresponding\n1D hydrodynamic models. Second, we study the gas accretion history of the\ncentral galaxies of dark matter haloes using merger trees. The inclusion of\nmergers alters the cooling history of haloes by locking up gas in galaxies\nwithin small haloes at early times. For realistic halo models, the dispersion\nin the cold gas mass predicted by the algorithms is 0.5 dex for high mass\nhaloes and 0.1 dex for low mass haloes, while the dispersion in the accretion\nrate is about two times larger. Comparing to cosmological SPH simulations, we\nfind that most SAMs systematically under-predict the gas accretion rates for\nlow-mass haloes but over-predict the gas accretion rates for massive haloes.\nAlthough the models all include both \"rapid\" and \"slow\" mode accretion, the\ntransition between the two accretion modes varies between models and also\ndiffers from the simulations.

The nonlinear behavior of the plasma\nat small scale is described by using a MHD shell model for velocity field and\nmagnetic field fluctuations.The shell model allow to study this problem in a\nlarge parameter regime which characterizes the dynamo phenomenon in many\nnatural systems and which is beyond the power of supercomputers at today. Under\nspecific conditions of the plasma turbulent state, the field fluctuations at\nsmall scales are able to trigger the dynamo instability. We study this\ntransition considering the stability curve which shows a strong decrease in the\ncritical magnetic Reynolds number for increasing inverse magnetic Prandlt\nnumber $\\textrm{Pm}^{-1}$ in the range $[10^{-6},1]$ and slows an increase in\nthe range $[1,10^{8}]$. We also obtain hysteretic behavior across the dynamo\nboundary reveling the subcritical nature of this transition. The system,\nundergoing this transition, can reach different dynamo regimes, depending on\nReynolds numbers of the plasma flow. This shows the critical role that the\nturbulence plays in the dynamo phenomenon. In particular the model is able to\nreproduce the dynamical situation in which the large-scale magnetic field jumps\nbetween two states which represent the opposite polarities of the magnetic\nfield, reproducing the magnetic reversals as observed in geomagnetic dynamo and\nin the VKS experiments.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Although it is NP-hard to find an optimal solution for an arbitrary\nnumber of sequences, due to the importance of this problem researchers are\ntrying to push the limits of exact algorithms further. Since MSA can be cast as\na classical path finding problem, it is attracting a growing number of AI\nresearchers interested in heuristic search algorithms as a challenge with\nactual practical relevance. In this paper, we first review two previous,\ncomplementary lines of research. Based on Hirschbergs algorithm, Dynamic\nProgramming needs O(kN^(k-1)) space to store both the search frontier and the\nnodes needed to reconstruct the solution path, for k sequences of length N.\nBest first search, on the other hand, has the advantage of bounding the search\nspace that has to be explored using a heuristic. However, it is necessary to\nmaintain all explored nodes up to the final solution in order to prevent the\nsearch from re-expanding them at higher cost. Earlier approaches to reduce the\nClosed list are either incompatible with pruning methods for the Open list, or\nmust retain at least the boundary of the Closed list. In this article, we\npresent an algorithm that attempts at combining the respective advantages; like\nA* it uses a heuristic for pruning the search space, but reduces both the\nmaximum Open and Closed size to O(kN^(k-1)), as in Dynamic Programming. The\nunderlying idea is to conduct a series of searches with successively increasing\nupper bounds, but using the DP ordering as the key for the Open priority queue.\nWith a suitable choice of thresholds, in practice, a running time below four\ntimes that of A* can be expected. In our experiments we show that our algorithm\noutperforms one of the currently most successful algorithms for optimal\nmultiple sequence alignments, Partial Expansion A*, both in time and memory.\nMoreover, we apply a refined heuristic based on optimal alignments not only of\npairs of sequences, but of larger subsets. This idea is not new; however, to\nmake it practically relevant we show that it is equally important to bound the\nheuristic computation appropriately, or the overhead can obliterate any\npossible gain. Furthermore, we discuss a number of improvements in time and\nspace efficiency with regard to practical implementations. Our algorithm, used\nin conjunction with higher-dimensional heuristics, is able to calculate for the\nfirst time the optimal alignment for almost all of the problems in Reference 1\nof the benchmark database BAliBASE.\n"]}]

However,\nunlike other PDDL planning systems, Fast Downward does not use the\npropositional PDDL representation of a planning task directly. Instead, the\ninput is first translated into an alternative representation called\nmulti-valued planning tasks, which makes many of the implicit constraints of a\npropositional planning task explicit.

The second \"Local\" refers\nto the cyclic homology localised to a certain separable subring of the ground\nalgebra, while the last one refers to Alexander-Spanier type cyclic homology.\nThe Connes-Moscovici work is based on the operator $R(A) = \\mathbf{P} -\n\\mathbf{e}$ associated to the elliptic pseudo-differential operator $A$ on the\nsmooth manifold $M$, where $\\mathbf{P}$, $\\mathbf{e}$ are idempotents, see\n\\cite{Connes-Moscovici1}, Pg. 353. The operator $R(A)$ has two main merits: it\nis a smoothing operator and its distributional kernel is situated in an\narbitrarily small neighbourhood of the diagonal in $M \\times M$. The operator\n$R(A)$ has also two setbacks: -i) it is not an idempotent (and therefore it\ndoes not have a genuine Connes-Chern character); -ii) even if it were an\nidempotent, its Connes-Chern character would belong to the cyclic homology of\nthe algebra of smoothing operators (with \\emph{arbitrary} supports, which is\n\\emph{trivial}.

As a corollary of this theorem,\nwe show that the \\emph{local} cyclic homology of the algebra of smoothing\noperators is at least as big as the Alexander-Spanier homology of the base\nmanifold.

D_+^{m_n} F which are common to all gauge theories. We argue that, when\nall m_i are equal and large, they have a dual description as strings with\ncusps, or spikes, one for each field F. In the case of N=4 SYM, we compute the\nenergy as a function of angular momentum by finding the corresponding solutions\nin AdS_5 and compare with a 1-loop calculation of the anomalous dimension. As\nin the case of two spikes (twist two operators), there is agreement in the\nfunctional form but not in the coupling constant dependence. After that, we\nanalyze the system in more detail and find an effective classical mechanics\ndescribing the motion of the spikes. In the appropriate limit, it is the same\n(up to the coupling constant dependence) as the coherent state description of\nlinear combinations of the operators O_{m_1 ... m_n} such that all m_i are\nequal on average. This agreement provides a map between the operators in the\nboundary and the position of the spikes in the bulk. We further suggest that\nmoving the spikes in other directions should describe operators with\nderivatives other than D_+ indicating that these ideas are quite generic and\nshould help in unraveling the string description of the large-N limit of gauge\ntheories.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 5 figures. v2: References and comments added"]}]

Finally, whereas reports on gravest earthquakes (of\naround M9.5) put the maximum coseismic displacement at around 10 m, the same\nequations predict the maximum displacement as 9.8 m, too. Hence, the same\nmechanism that causes bridges to collapse under the soldiers step marching\ncould be making the lithosphere fail under the springtide induced magnification\nof mantle resonance resulting in strong earthquakes of unspecified type.
