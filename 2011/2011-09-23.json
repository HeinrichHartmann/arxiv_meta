The Kramers polarization generates a new type of effective field\nthat affects only the time-reversal electronic states.

Importantly, we predict that the\nexistence of Kramers polarization can be experimentally detected by performing\nnonlinear differential conductance measurements.

That is, as the peak\nflux of the pulsar approaches that of the system equivalent flux density,\nneither greater antenna gain nor increased instrumental bandwidth will improve\ntiming precision. These conclusions proceed from an analysis of the covariance\nmatrix used to characterise residual pulse profile fluctuations following the\ntemplate matching procedure for arrival time estimation. We perform such an\nanalysis on 25 hours of high-precision timing observations of the closest and\nbrightest millisecond pulsar, PSR J0437-4715. In these data, the standard\ndeviation of the post-fit arrival time residuals is approximately four times\ngreater than that predicted by considering the system equivalent flux density,\nmean pulsar flux and the effective width of the pulsed emission. We develop a\ntechnique based on principal component analysis to mitigate the effects of\nshape variations on arrival time estimation and demonstrate its validity using\na number of illustrative simulations. When applied to our observations, the\nmethod reduces arrival time residual noise by approximately 20%. We conclude\nthat, owing primarily to the intrinsic variability of the radio emission from\nPSR J0437-4715 at 20 cm, timing precision in this observing band better than 30\n- 40 ns in one hour is highly unlikely, regardless of future improvements in\nantenna gain or instrumental bandwidth.

We offer research experiences for secondary\nschool teachers and high school students. We collaborate with educators to\ndesign and run programs that meet their needs and interests. Popular school\nprograms include classroom presentations, experience-based field trips, and\nhigh school tours. Through our work in QuarkNet and I2U2, we make real particle\nphysics data available to high school students in datadriven activities as well\nas masterclasses and e-Labs. Our professional development activities include a\nTeacher Resource Center and workshops where teachers participate in authentic\nlearning experiences as their students would.

Full quivers of representations apply especially well to \\Zcd\\\nalgebras, which have properties very like those of finite dimensional algebras\nover fields. By choosing the representation appropriately, one can restrict the\ngluing to two main types: {\\it Frobenius} (along the diagonal) and, more\ngenerally {\\it proportional} Frobenius gluing (above the diagonal), and our\nmain result is that any representable algebra has a faithful representation\ndescribed completely by such a full quiver. Further reductions are considered,\nwhich bear on the polynomial identities.\n","Comment: 44 pp"]}]

TALM (TALM is an Architecture and Language for\nMulti-threading) introduces a user-defined coarse-grained parallel data-flow\nmodel, where programmers identify code blocks, called super-instructions, to be\nrun in parallel and connect them in a data-flow graph. TALM has been\nimplemented as a hybrid Von Neumann/data-flow execution system: the\n\\emph{Trebuchet}. We have observed that TALM's usefulness largely depends on\nhow programmers specify and connect super-instructions. Thus, we present\n\\emph{Couillard}, a full compiler that creates, based on an annotated\nC-program, a data-flow graph and C-code corresponding to each\nsuper-instruction. We show that our toolchain allows one to benefit from\ndata-flow execution and explore sophisticated parallel programming techniques,\nwith small effort. To evaluate our system we have executed a set of real\napplications on a large multi-core machine.
