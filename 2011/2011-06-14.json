As\na result, consumers will be able to control their electricity consumption in an\nautomated fashion, where one possible scheme is to have each individual\nmaximize its own utility as a noncooperative game. In this paper,\nnoncooperative games are formulated among the electricity consumers in Smart\nGrid with two real-time pricing schemes, where the Nash equilibrium operation\npoints are investigated for their uniqueness and load balancing properties. The\nfirst pricing scheme charges a price according to the average cost of\nelectricity borne by the retailer and the second one charges according to a\ntime-variant increasing-block price, where for each scheme, a zero-revenue\nmodel and a constant-rate revenue model are considered.

The Nash\nequilibrium is shown to exist for four different combined cases corresponding\nto the two pricing schemes and the two revenue models, and is unique for three\nof the cases under certain conditions. It is further shown that both pricing\nschemes lead to similar electricity loading patterns when consumers are only\ninterested in minimizing the electricity costs without any other profit\nconsiderations. Finally, the conditions under which the increasing-block\npricing scheme is preferred over the average-cost based pricing scheme are\ndiscussed.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 4 figures"]}]

The objective is to allocate facilities from sites to satisfy\n$\\mathcal{R}$ at a minimum total cost. Next, we introduce the Constrained\nFault-Tolerant Resource Allocation (CFTRA) problem. It differs from UFTRA in\nthat the number of resources available at each site $i$ is limited by $R_{i}$.\nBoth problems are practical extensions of the classical Fault-Tolerant Facility\nLocation (FTFL) problem \\cite{Jain00FTFL}.

We study a more realistic setting in which (a) the principal is a\ndecision maker and will take a decision based on the expert's prediction; and\n(b) the expert has an inherent interest in the decision. For example, in a\ncorporate decision market, the expert may derive different levels of utility\nfrom the actions taken by her manager. As a consequence the expert will usually\nhave an incentive to misreport her forecast to influence the choice of the\ndecision maker if typical scoring rules are used.

Assuming\nfull knowledge of expert utility, we provide a complete characterization of all\n(strictly) proper compensation rules.

We show\nbounds on: (a) expert incentive to misreport; (b) the degree to which an expert\nwill misreport; and (c) decision maker loss in utility due to such uncertainty.\nThese bounds depend in natural ways on the degree of uncertainty, the local\ndegree of convexity of net scoring function, and natural properties of the\ndecision maker's utility function.
