In that case each individual mass\neigenstate can be either Dirac or Majorana, so that the flavor eigenstates are\n\"large\" admixtures of both.

Data are compared with pythia Tune A and to resummed parton level\npredictions that were matched to fixed order results at NLO accuracy (NLO+NLL).\nPredictions from pythia Tune A agree fairly well with the data. However, the\nunderlying event contributes significantly to these observables, making it\ndifficult to make direct comparisons to the NLO+NLL predictions, which do not\naccount for the underlying event. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a\nnew observable, a weighted difference of the mean values of the thrust and\nthrust minor, which is less sensitive to the underlying event, allowing for a\ncomparison with NLO+NLL. Both pythia Tune A and the NLO+NLL calculations agree\nwell within the 20% theoretical uncertainty with the data for this observable,\nindicating that perturbative QCD successfully describes shapes of the hadronic\nfinal states.\n"]}]

In this limit, the allowed positions of\nsolitary waves relative to the lattice, as well as their linear stability\nproperties, hinge upon a certain recurrence relation which contains information\nbeyond all orders of the usual two-scale perturbation expansion. It follows\nthat only two such positions are permissible, and of those two solitary waves,\none is linearly stable and the other unstable. For a cosine lattice, in\nparticular, the two possible solitary waves are centered at a maximum or\nminimum of the lattice, with the former being stable, and the analytical\npredictions for the associated linear stability eigenvalues are in excellent\nagreement with numerical results. Furthermore, a countable set of\nmulti-solitary-wave bound states are constructed analytically. In spite of\nrather different physical settings, the exponential asymptotics approach\nfollowed here is strikingly similar to that taken in earlier studies of\nsolitary wavepackets involving a periodic carrier and a slowly-varying\nenvelope, which underscores the general value of this procedure for treating\nmulti-scale solitary-wave problems.\n","Comment: To appear in Stud.

A clear evidence of intrinsic\nphase separation at 520 K between two competing phases, (i) a first majority\nmagnetic phase with a ThCr2Si2-type tetragonal lattice modulated by the iron\nvacancy ordering and (ii) a minority non-magnetic phase having an in-plane\ncompressed lattice volume and a weak superstructure, is reported. The XRD peaks\ndue to the Fe vacancy ordering in the majority phase disappear by increasing\nthe temperature at 580 K, well above phase separation temperature confirming\nthe order-disorder phase transition. The intrinsic phase separation at 520K\nbetween a competing first magnetic phase and a second non-magnetic phase in the\nnormal phase both having lattice superstructures (that imply different Fermi\nsurface topology reconstruction and charge density) is assigned to a\nlattice-electronic instability of the K0.8Fe1.6Se2 system typical of a system\ntuned at a Lifshitz critical point of an electronic topological transition that\ngives a multi-gaps superconductor tuned a shape resonance.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Towards these later regions, it is\nbelieved that OH masers are associated with the circumstellar disk (e.g. Edris\net al. 2005; Gray et al. 2003). These disks should be hosting dense dust\ngrains. The presence of the hot dust could be traced via the millimeter\ncontinuum emission as well as IR emission.\n  Aims: studying the association between millimeter (mm) continuum, the OH\nmasers emission, and IRAS sources.\n  Methods: A sample of 27 High Mass Star Forming Regions (HMSFRs) chosen from\nIRAS catalog and show OH maser emission (Edris et. al. 2007) have been studied\nat 1.1 millimeter (mm) continuum emission of the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey\n(BGPS).\n  Results: The 1.1-mm continuum emission have been found within ~ 30' towards\n23 sources of the OH maser sample. These sources were divided into three groups\ndepends on the offset of the closest mm peak from the OH maser position. The\nassociation between the OH, mm and IR emissions types have been confirmed for\ntwo sources. Generally the IRAS position is more consistent with the mm peaks\nthan the OH maser emission and towards 10 sources the IRAS and OH masers are\nnot consistent with the same mm peak.\n  Conclusion: The relatively large positional uncertainty do not allow to firm\nconclusions but it seems that the IR peak is closer to the mm emission than the\nOH maser.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 26 figures and one table"]}]

As a\nby-product, we derive some interesting new distributional properties enjoyed by\na large class of this random variable, such as the absolute continuity of its\ndistribution and the smoothness, boundedness or complete monotonicity of its\ndensity. This type of results is then used to derive similar properties for the\nlaw of maxima and first passage time of some stable L\\'evy processes. Thus, for\nexample, we show that for a large class of stable processes the first passage\ntime has a bounded and non-increasing density on the positive half-line.
