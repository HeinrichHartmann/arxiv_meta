The system is described by a\nnon-standard Bose-Hubbard model with both occupation-dependent tunneling and\non-site interaction. We find that for sufficiently strong coupling the system\nfeatures a phase-transition from a Mott insulator with one particle per site to\na superfluid of spatially extended particle pairs living on top of the Mott\nbackground -- instead of the usual transition to a superfluid of single\nparticles/holes. Increasing the interaction further, a superfluid of particle\npairs localized on a single site (rather than being extended) on top of the\nMott background appears. This happens at the same interaction strength where\nthe Mott-insulator phase with 2 particles per site is destroyed completely by\nparticle-hole fluctuations for arbitrarily small tunneling. In another regime,\ncharacterized by weak interaction, but high occupation numbers, we observe a\ndynamical instability in the superfluid excitation spectrum.

We represent an image template by an active basis model,\nwhich is a linear composition of a selected set of localized, elongated and\noriented wavelet elements that are allowed to slightly perturb their locations\nand orientations to account for the deformations of object shapes. The model\ncan be easily learned when the objects in the training images are of the same\npose, and appear at the same location and scale. This is often called\nsupervised learning. In the situation where the objects may appear at different\nunknown locations, orientations and scales in the training images, we have to\nincorporate the unknown locations, orientations and scales as latent variables\ninto the image generation process, and learn the template by EM-type\nalgorithms. The E-step imputes the unknown locations, orientations and scales\nbased on the currently learned template. This step can be considered\nself-supervision, which involves using the current template to recognize the\nobjects in the training images. The M-step then relearns the template based on\nthe imputed locations, orientations and scales, and this is essentially the\nsame as supervised learning.

Researchers have long investigated how to take\nadvantage of dataflow constraints by embedding them into procedural languages.\nPrevious mixed imperative/dataflow systems, however, require syntactic\nextensions or libraries of ad hoc data types for binding the imperative program\nto the dataflow solver. In this paper we propose a novel approach that smoothly\ncombines the two paradigms without placing undue burden on the programmer. In\nour framework, programmers can define ordinary commands of the host imperative\nlanguage that enforce constraints between objects stored in \"reactive\" memory\nlocations. Reactive objects can be of any legal type in the host language,\nincluding primitive data types, pointers, arrays, and structures. Constraints\nare automatically re-executed every time their input memory locations change,\nletting a program behave like a spreadsheet where the values of some variables\ndepend upon the values of other variables. The constraint solving mechanism is\nhandled transparently by altering the semantics of elementary operations of the\nhost language for reading and modifying objects. We provide a formal semantics\nand describe a concrete embodiment of our technique into C/C++, showing how to\nimplement it efficiently in conventional platforms using off-the-shelf\ncompilers. We discuss relevant applications to reactive scenarios, including\nincremental computation, observer design pattern, and data structure repair.\nThe performance of our implementation is compared to ad hoc problem-specific\nchange propagation algorithms and to language-centric approaches such as\nself-adjusting computation and subject/observer communication mechanisms,\nshowing that the proposed approach is efficient in practice.\n"]}]

This detection challenged the current\nunderstanding of chemistry in old stars, since water vapour was predicted to be\nabsent in carbon-rich stars. Several explanations for the occurrence of water\nvapour were postulated, including the vaporization of icy bodies (comets or\ndwarf planets) in orbit around the star, grain surface reactions, and\nphotochemistry in the outer circumstellar envelope. However, the only water\nline detected so far from one carbon-rich evolved star can not discriminate, by\nitself, between the different mechanisms proposed. Here we report on the\ndetection by the Herschel satellite of dozens of water vapour lines in the\nfar-infrared and sub-millimetre spectrum of IRC+10216, including some\nhigh-excitation lines with energies corresponding to ~1000 K. The emission of\nthese high-excitation water lines can only be explained if water vapour is\npresent in the warm inner region of the envelope. A plausible explanation for\nthe formation of warm water vapour appears to be the penetration of ultraviolet\n(UV) photons deep into a clumpy circumstellar envelope.
