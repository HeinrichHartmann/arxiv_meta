We show that the statistical equilibrium states of\nself-gravitating systems are neither maximum nor minimum, but complex\nsaddle-point entropy states, and hence differ greatly from the case of ideal\ngas. Violent relaxation should be divided into two phases. The first phase is\nthe entropy-production phase, while the second phase is the entropy-decreasing\nphase. We speculate that the second-phase violent relaxation may just be the\nlong-wave Landau damping, which would work together with short-range\nrelaxations to keep the system equilibrated around the saddle-point entropy\nstates.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 1 figure, MNRAS Letter, in the press"]}]

Finding an answer to this difficult question is of\nimportance to model time-series showing trend-like behavior, such as river\nrun-off in hydrology, historical temperatures in the study of climates changes,\nor packet counts in network traffic engineering. The main goal of this paper is\nto develop a test procedure to detect the presence of non-stationarity for a\nclass of processes whose $K$-th order difference is stationary. Contrary to\nmost of the proposed methods, the test procedure has the same distribution for\nshort-range and long-range dependence covariance stationary processes, which\nmeans that this test is able to detect the presence of non-stationarity for\nprocesses showing long-range dependence or which are unit root. The proposed\ntest is formulated in the wavelet domain, where a change in the generalized\nspectral density results in a change in the variance of wavelet coefficients at\none or several scales. Such tests have been already proposed in\n\\cite{whitcher:2001}, but these authors do not have taken into account the\ndependence of the wavelet coefficients within scales and between scales.\nTherefore, the asymptotic distribution of the test they have proposed was\nerroneous; as a consequence, the level of the test under the null hypothesis of\nstationarity was wrong. In this contribution, we introduce two test procedures,\nboth using an estimator of the variance of the scalogram at one or several\nscales. The asymptotic distribution of the test under the null is rigorously\njustified. The pointwise consistency of the test in the presence of a single\njump in the general spectral density is also be presented.

Methodology/Principal Findings: By\nsearching the published literature for AMH concentrations in healthy\npre-menopausal females, and using our own data (combined n = 3,260) we have\ngenerated and robustly validated the first model of AMH concentration from\nconception to menopause. This model shows that 34% of the variation in AMH is\ndue to age alone. We have shown that AMH peaks at age 24.5 years, followed by a\ndecline to the menopause. We have also shown that there is a neonatal peak and\na potential pre-pubertal peak. Our model allows us to generate normative data\nat all ages. Conclusions/Significance: These data highlight key inflection\npoints in ovarian follicle dynamics. This first validated model of circulating\nAMH in healthy females describes a transition period in early adulthood, after\nwhich AMH reflects the progressive loss of the NGF pool. The existence of a\nneonatal increase in gonadal activity is confirmed for females.

Motivated by data\nwhich suggests that the strong coupling \\alpha_s(Q) freezes at low Q, and by\nsimilarities between the spectra of hadrons and atoms, I discuss if and how QCD\nbound states may be treated perturbatively. I recall the basic principles of\nperturbative gauge theory bound states at lowest order in the \\hbar expansion.\nBorn level amplitudes are insensitive to the i\\epsilon prescription of\npropagators, which allows to eliminate the Z-diagrams of relativistic,\ntime-ordered Coulomb interactions. The Dirac wave function thus describes a\nsingle electron which propagates forward in time only, even though the bound\nstate has any number of pair constituents when Feynman propagators are used. In\nthe absence of an external potential, states that are bound by the Coulomb\nattraction of their constituents can be analogously described using only their\nvalence degrees of freedom. The instantaneous A^0 field is determined by Gauss'\nlaw for each wave function component, i.e., for each position of the valence\nconstituents. Solutions for A^0 obtained with a boundary condition that imposes\nan asymptotically constant energy density give rise to a linear potential for\ncolor singlet q\\bar q and qqq states. The strength of the linear potential is\ndetermined by the boundary condition and is of lower order in \\alpha_s than the\ngluon exchange interaction, which may then be treated as a higher order\nperturbative correction. Bound states evaluated to a given order in \\alpha_s\nand \\hbar must have the full symmetry of the exact theory, including the\ndynamic boost invariance of states quantized at equal time. The wave functions\nare indeed found to have such a hidden invariance, which ensures the correct\ndependence of the energy eigenvalues on the center of mass momentum. Thus\nrelativistic bound states can be studied using perturbative methods.\n","Comment: Based on lectures at the International Summer School and Conference\n  on High Energy Physics: Standard Model and Beyond (ISSCSMB '10), at Mugla,\n  Akyaka in Turkey on 27 August -- 4 September 2010. 24 pages, 4 figures"]}]
