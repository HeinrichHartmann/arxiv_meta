One of the conditions for the SOC is the slow driving noise, which\nunambiguously suggests Stratonovich interpretation of the corresponding\nstochastic differential equation (SDE). This, in turn, necessitates the use of\nParisi-Sourlas-Wu stochastic quantization procedure, which straightforwardly\nleads to a model with BRST-exact action, i.e., to a W-TFT. In the parameter\nspace of the SDE, there must exist full-dimensional regions where the\nBRST-symmetry is spontaneously broken by instantons, which in the context of\nSOC are essentially avalanches. In these regions, the avalanche-type SOC\ndynamics is liberated from overwise a rightful dynamics-less W-TFT, and a\nGoldstone mode of Fadeev-Popov ghosts exists. Goldstinos represent modulii of\ninstantons (avalanches) and being gapless are responsible for the critical\navalanche distribution in the low-energy, long-wavelength limit. The above\narguments are robust against moderate variations of the SDE's parameters and\nthe criticality is \"self-tuned\". The proposition of this paper suggests that\nthe machinery of W-TFTs may find its applications in many different areas of\nmodern science studying various physical realizations of SOC.

The interaction\nbetween such plates can be considered as an example of a hydrophilic\ninteraction. In the present work we modify our previous model by removing the\ncharge from the zwitterionic headgroups. As a result of this procedure, the\nplate character changes; it becomes hydrophobic. By separating the total\ninteraction (or potential of mean force, PMF) between plates into the direct\nand the water-mediated interactions we observe that the latter changes from\nrepulsive to attractive, clearly emphasizing the important role of water as a\nmedium. We also investigate the effect of roughness and flexibility of the\nheadgroups on the interaction between plates and observe that roughness\nenhances the character of the hydrophobic interaction. The presence of a\ndewetting transition in a confined space between charge-removed plates confirms\nthat the interaction between plates is strongly hydrophobic. In addition, we\nnotice that there is a shallow local minimum in the PMF in case of\ncharge-removed plates. We find that this minimum is associated with the\nconfigurational changes that flexible headgroups undergo, as the two plates are\nbrought together.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 9 figures"]}]
