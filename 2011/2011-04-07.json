Generically,\nwe find that SF is limited by the build-up of dark matter haloes at high\nredshift, reaches a broad maximum at intermediate redshift, then decreases as\nit is quenched by lower cooling rates in hotter and lower density gas, gas\nexhaustion, and self-regulated feedback from stars and black holes. The higher\nredshift SF is therefore mostly determined by the cosmological parameters and\nto a lesser extent by photo-heating from reionization. The location and height\nof the peak in the SF history, and the steepness of the decline towards the\npresent, depend on the physics and implementation of stellar and black hole\nfeedback. Mass loss from intermediate-mass stars and metal-line cooling both\nboost the SF rate at late times. Galaxies form stars in a self-regulated\nfashion at a rate controlled by the balance between, on the one hand, feedback\nfrom massive stars and black holes and, on the other hand, gas cooling and\naccretion. Paradoxically, the SF rate is highly insensitive to the assumed SF\nlaw. This can be understood in terms of self-regulation: if the SF efficiency\nis changed, then galaxies adjust their gas fractions so as to achieve the same\nrate of production of massive stars. Self-regulated feedback from accreting\nblack holes is required to match the steep decline in the observed SF rate\nbelow redshift two, although more extreme feedback from SF, for example in the\nform of a top-heavy IMF at high gas pressures, can help.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS, 27 pages and 18 figures.

In\norder to interpret this result we analyse control samples constructed using\ngalaxies with no detected AGN activity with matching distributions of\nredshifts, stellar masses, r-band luminosities, g-r colours, concentrations,\nlocal densities, host group luminosities, and fractions of central and\nsatellite galaxies. The control samples also show a similar small dependence on\nthe local density indicating an influence from the AGN selection, but their\ncolours are slightly bluer compared to the AGN hosts regardless of local\ndensity. Furthermore, even when the local density is held fixed at intermediate\nor high values, and the distance to the closest cluster of galaxies is allowed\nto vary, AGN control galaxies away from clusters tend to be bluer than the AGN\nhosts.

The La luminosity in our simulations is\npowered by the release of gravitational energy as gas flows from the\nintergalactic medium into the halo potential wells. The UV background\ncontributes only <20% to the gas heating. The La emissivity is due primarily to\nelectron-impact excitation cooling radiation in gas ~2x10^4K. We calculate the\nLa emissivities assuming collisional ionisation equilibrium (CIE) at all gas\ntemperatures. The simulated streams are self-shielded against the UV\nbackground, so photoionisation and recombination contribute negligibly to the\nLa line formation. We produce theoretical maps of the La surface brightnesses,\nassuming that ~85% of the La photons are directly observable. We find that\ntypical haloes of mass Mv~10^12-13 Msun at z~3 emit as La blobs (LABs) with\nluminosities 10^43-44 erg/s. Most of the La comes from the extended narrow,\npartly clumpy, inflowing, cold streams that feed the growing galaxies. The\npredicted LAB morphology is therefore irregular, with dense clumps and\nelongated extensions. The linewidth is expected to range from 10^2 to more than\n10^3 km/s with a large variance. The typical La surface brightness profile is\nproportional to r^-1.2 where r is the distance from the halo centre. Our\nsimulated LABs are similar in luminosity, morphology and extent to the observed\nLABs, with distinct kinematic features. The predicted La luminosity function is\nconsistent with observations, and the predicted areas and linewidths roughly\nrecover the observed scaling relations. This mechanism for producing LABs\nappears inevitable in many high-z galaxies. Some of the LABs may thus be\nregarded as direct detections of the cold streams that drove galaxy evolution\nat high z.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 20 figures, final version accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

Both theoretical and observational\nstudies support the hypothesis that such bodies emit significant amounts of\nflux relative to the host star, increasing towards infrared wavelengths. For\nthe dayside of the exoplanet, this phenomenon typically permits detectable\nsecondary eclipses at such wavelengths, which may be used to infer atmospheric\ncomposition. In this paper, we explore the effects of emission from the\nnightside of the exoplanet on the primary transit lightcurve, which is\nessentially a self-blend. Allowing for nightside emission, an exoplanet's\ntransit depth is no longer exclusively a function of the ratio-of-radii. The\nnightside of an exoplanet is emitting flux and the contrast to the star's\nemission is of the order of ~10^(-3) for hot-Jupiters. Consequently, we show\nthat the transit depth in the mid-infrared will be attenuated due to flux\ncontribution from the nightside emission by ~10^(-4). We show how this effect\ncan be compensated for in the case where exoplanet phase curves have been\nmeasured, in particular for HD 189733b.

The absorption can be explained by two\nC III clouds, offset by 35 km/s in velocity, with metallicities of ~one-tenth\nthe solar value. One cloud has a density of order n_H = 1.2 +0.9 -0.5 * 10^-3\ncm^-3 (thickness 0.4 +0.3 -0.2 kpc) and produces the observed C II and Si III\nabsorption, while the other has a density of order n_H = 1.2 +0.9 -0.5 * 10^-5\ncm^-3 (thickness 80 +70 -40 kpc) and gives rise to the observed weak C IV\nabsorption. Cloud temperatures are ~14,000 +3000 -2000 K and ~34,000 -4000\n+2000 K for photoionized models. Although collisionally ionized clouds with T ~\n70,000 K are possible, they are less likely because of the short cooling\ntime-scales involved. Previous studies revealed no luminous galaxy at the\nabsorber's redshift, so it is probably related to tidal debris, ejected\nmaterial, a dwarf galaxy, or other halo material in a galaxy group. Our models\nalso indicate that one of the two clouds would produce detectable weak Mg II\nabsorption if spectral coverage of that transition existed. We predict what the\nsystem would look like at z ~ 1 when the ionizing background radiation was more\nintense. We find that at z ~ 1 the denser component resembles a C IV absorber.\nThe second C III cloud in this z = 0.0777 absorber may be analogous to a subset\nof the more diffuse O VI absorbers at higher redshift.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 6 figures, accepted by MNRAS"]}]

This can increase the chance of an undesirable\nthread-interleaving, thus allowing an otherwise-unlikely concurrency bug to\nmanifest.

PEG added to the homogeneous\nnematic (N) phase causes separation into the coexisting N and I domains; the\nSSY concentration in the N domains is higher than the original concentration of\nPEG-free N phase. Finally, addition of PEG to the highly concentrated\nhomogeneous N phase causes separation into the coexisting columnar hexagonal\n(C) phase and I phase. This behavior can be qualitatively explained by the\ndepletion (excluded volume) effects that act at two different levels: at the\nlevel of aggregate assembly from monomers and short aggregates and at the level\nof inter-aggregate packing. We also show a strong effect of a monovalent salt\nNaCl on phase diagrams that is different for high and low concentrations of\nSSY. Upon the addition of salt, dilute I solutions of SSY show appearance of\nthe condensed N domains, but the highly concentrated C phase transforms into a\ncoexisting I and N domains. We suggest that the salt-induced screening of\nelectric charges at the surface of chromonic aggregates leads to two different\neffects: (a) increase of the scission energy and the contour length of\naggregates, and (b) decrease of the persistence length of SSY aggregates.\n","Comment: 42 pages, 12 figures"]}]
