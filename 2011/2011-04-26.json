Protein folding is a stochastic\nprocess by which a polypeptide folds into its characteristic and functional 3D\nstructure from random coil. The process involves an intricate interplay between\nglobal geometry and local structure, and each protein seems to present special\nproblems. We introduce CSAW (conditioned self-avoiding walk), a model of\nprotein folding that combines the features of self-avoiding walk (SAW) and the\nMonte Carlo method. In this model, the unfolded protein chain is treated as a\nrandom coil described by SAW. Folding is induced by hydrophobic forces and\nother interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, which can be taken into account\nby imposing conditions on SAW. Conceptually, the mathematical basis is a\ngeneralized Langevin equation. To illustrate the flexibility and capabilities\nof the model, we consider several examples, including helix formation, elastic\nproperties, and the transition in the folding of myoglobin. From the CSAW\nsimulation and physical arguments, we find a universal elastic energy for\nproteins, which depends only on the radius of gyration $R_{g}$ and the residue\nnumber $N$. The elastic energy gives rise to scaling laws $R_{g}\\sim N^{\\nu}$\nin different regions with exponents $\\nu =3/5,3/7,2/5$, consistent with the\nobserved unfolded stage, pre-globule, and molten globule, respectively.

Both biotic interactions and\nenvironmental fluctuations are key factors that can facilitate or disrupt\ncoexistence. To better understand this interplay between these deterministic\nand stochastic forces, we develop a mathematical theory extending the nonlinear\ntheory of permanence for deterministic systems to stochastic difference and\ndifferential equations. Our condition for coexistence requires that there is a\nfixed set of weights associated with the interacting populations and this\nweighted combination of populations' invasion rates is positive for any\n(ergodic) stationary distribution associated with a subcollection of\npopulations. Here, an invasion rate corresponds to an average per-capita growth\nrate along a stationary distribution. When this condition holds and there is\nsufficient noise in the system, we show that the populations approach a unique\npositive stationary distribution. Moreover, we show that our coexistence\ncriterion is robust to small perturbations of the model functions. Using this\ntheory, we illustrate that (i) environmental noise enhances or inhibits\ncoexistence in communities with rock-paper-scissor dynamics depending on\ncorrelations between interspecific demographic rates, (ii) stochastic variation\nin mortality rates has no effect on the coexistence criteria for discrete-time\nLotka-Volterra communities, and (iii) random forcing can promote genetic\ndiversity in the presence of exploitative interactions.\n","Comment: 25 pages"]}]

Using this method, we obtain simple data-stream\nalgorithms that maintain a randomized sketch of an input vector\n$x=(x_1,...x_n)$, which is useful for the following applications. 1) Estimating\nthe $F_k$-moment of $x$, for $k>2$. 2) Estimating the $\\ell_p$-norm of $x$, for\n$p\\in[1,2]$, with small update time. 3) Estimating cascaded norms\n$\\ell_p(\\ell_q)$ for all $p,q>0$. 4) $\\ell_1$ sampling, where the goal is to\nproduce an element $i$ with probability (approximately) $|x_i|/\\|x\\|_1$.

Therefore, the design\nof an optimal multiple gravity assist (MGA) trajectory is a NP-hard mixed\ncombinatorial-continuous problem. Its automated solution would greatly improve\nthe design of future space missions, allowing the assessment of a large number\nof alternative mission options in a short time.

The trajectory model consists of a sequence of\ncelestial bodies connected by twodimensional transfer arcs containing one DSM.\nFor each transfer arc, the position of the planet and the spacecraft, at the\ntime of arrival, are matched by varying the pericentre of the preceding\nswing-by, or the magnitude of the launch excess velocity, for the first arc.\nFor each departure date, this model generates a full tree of possible transfers\nfrom the departure to the destination planet. Each leaf of the tree represents\na planetary encounter and a possible way to reach that planet. An algorithm\ninspired by Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is devised to explore the space of\npossible plans. The ants explore the tree from departure to destination adding\none node at the time: every time an ant is at a node, a probability function is\nused to select a feasible direction.

We compute the rational homotopy groups of that\nspace when the 4-manifold has the form $M_{\\lambda}= (S^2 \\times S^2, \\mu\n\\omega_0 \\oplus \\omega_0)$ where $\\omega_0$ is the area form on the sphere with\ntotal area 1 and $\\mu$ belongs to the interval $[1,2]$. We show that, when\n$\\mu$ is 1, this space retracts to the space of symplectic frames, for any\nvalue of $c$. However, for any given $1 < \\mu < 2$, the rational homotopy type\nof that space changes as $c$ crosses the critical parameter $c_{crit} = \\mu -\n1$, which is the difference of areas between the two $S^2$ factors. We prove\nmoreover that the full homotopy type of that space changes only at that value,\ni.e the restriction map between these spaces is a homotopy equivalence as long\nas these values of $c$ remain either below or above that critical value.\n","Comment: Typos corrected, 2 minor corrections in the text.
