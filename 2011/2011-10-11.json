We find the likelihood of a given planetesimal from this region being\ncaptured onto an orbit within Jupiter's Trojan cloud lies between several times\n10^-6 and 10^-5.

Our results suggest that all four giant\nplanets are able to capture and retain a significant population of Trojan\nobjects from the disk by the end of planetary migration. As a result of\nencounters with the giant planets prior to Trojan capture, these objects tend\nto be captured on orbits that are spread over a wide range of orbital\neccentricities and inclinations. The bulk of captured objects are to some\nextent dynamically unstable, and therefore the populations of these objects\ntend to decay over the age of the Solar System, providing an important ongoing\nsource of new objects moving on dynamically unstable orbits among the giant\nplanets. Given that a huge population of objects would be displaced by\nNeptune's outward migration (with a potential cumulative mass a number of times\nthat of the Earth), we conclude that the surviving remnant of the Trojans\ncaptured during the migration of the outer planets might be sufficient to\nexplain the currently known Trojan populations in the outer Solar system.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 4 figures, MNRAS (in press)"]}]

The highest fractional polarization occurs for the post-AGB+PN\nand the Mira+SR classes at 1612 and 1667 MHz, respectively.

For instance, independent component\nanalysis (ICA) is used to separate statistically independent (orthogonal)\nsource signals. However, signal orthogonality is not guaranteed in many\nreal-world problems. This new BSS method developed here deals with\nnonorthogonal signals. The independence assumption is replaced by a condition\nwhich requires dominant interval(s) (DI) from each of source signals over\nothers. Additionally, the mixing matrix is assumed to be nearly singular. The\nmethod first estimates the mixing matrix by exploiting geometry in data\nclustering. Due to the degeneracy of the data, a small deviation in the\nestimation may introduce errors (spurious peaks of negative values in most\ncases) in the output. To resolve this challenging problem and improve\nrobustness of the separation, methods are developed in two aspects. One\ntechnique is to find a better estimation of the mixing matrix by allowing a\nconstrained perturbation to the clustering output, and it can be achieved by a\nquadratic programming. The other is to seek sparse source signals by exploiting\nthe DI condition, and it solves an $\\ell_1$ optimization. We present numerical\nresults of NMR data to show the performance and reliability of the method in\nthe applications arising in NMR spectroscopy.\n","Comment: submitted to Comm Math Sciences"]}]

As a\nconsequence, these trapped electrons block consecutive electron transfer from\nan exciton on a CP to the PCBM domain, resulting in a relatively low\nconcentration charge carriers in the annealed blend. Analysis of the transient\nESR data allows us to conclude that in annealed samples diamagnetic\nbi-polaronic states on the CPs are generated at low temperature.

The small parameter of the theory is nd. The lowest\norder of the theory generates the single particle propagators of the hybridized\npdp- and dpd-fermions with the exact three band structure. The leading\nmany-body effect is band narrowing, obtained without mean-field slave particle\napproximations. Damping found in the single particle propagation is related to\nincoherent Cu-O2 intracell \"mixed valence\" fluctuations. The corresponding\ncontinuum falls below the Fermi level.

We compute the Hayashi spectra of\nthe 500hPa geopotential height fields and introduce an integral measure of the\nvariability observed in the NH on different spectral sub-domains. Only two\nhigh-resolution GCMs have a good agreement with reanalyses. Large biases, in\nmost cases larger than 20%, are found between the wave climatologies of most\nGCMs and the reanalyses, with a relative span of around 50%. The travelling\nbaroclinic waves are usually overestimated, while the planetary waves are\nusually underestimated, in agreement with previous studies performed on global\nweather forecasting models. When comparing the results of various versions of\nsimilar GCMs, it is clear that in some cases the vertical resolution of the\natmosphere and, somewhat unexpectedly, of the adopted ocean model seem to be\ncritical in determining the agreement with the reanalyses. The GCMs ensemble is\nbiased with respect to the reanalyses but is comparable to the best 5 GCMs.\nThis study suggests serious caveats with respect to the ability of most of the\npresently available GCMs in representing the statistics of the global scale\natmospheric dynamics of the present climate and, a fortiori, in the perspective\nof modelling climate change.\n","Comment: 39 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables"]}]

Versions of reality given by various regional\n  climate models and climatological datasets"],"description":["  We present an intercomparison and verification analysis of several regional\nclimate models (RCMs) nested into the same run of the same Atmospheric Global\nCirculation Model (AGCM) regarding their representation of the statistical\nproperties of the hydrological balance of the Danube river basin for 1961-1990.\nWe also consider the datasets produced by the driving AGCM, from the ECMWF and\nNCEP-NCAR reanalyses. The hydrological balance is computed by integrating the\nprecipitation and evaporation fields over the area of interest. Large\ndiscrepancies exist among RCMs for the monthly climatology as well as for the\nmean and variability of the annual balances, and only few datasets are\nconsistent with the observed discharge values of the Danube at its Delta, even\nif the driving AGCM provides itself an excellent estimate. Since the considered\napproach relies on the mass conservation principle and bypasses the details of\nthe air-land interface modeling, we propose that the atmospheric components of\nRCMs still face difficulties in representing the water balance even on a\nrelatively large scale. Their reliability on smaller river basins may be even\nmore problematic. Moreover, since for some models the hydrological balance\nestimates obtained with the runoff fields do not agree with those obtained via\nprecipitation and evaporation, some deficiencies of the land models are also\napparent. NCEP-NCAR and ERA-40 reanalyses result to be largely inadequate for\nrepresenting the hydrology of the Danube river basin, both for the\nreconstruction of the long-term averages and of the seasonal cycle, and cannot\nin any sense be used as verification. We suggest that these results should be\ncarefully considered in the perspective of auditing climate models and\nassessing their ability to simulate future climate changes.\n","Comment: 25 pages 8 figures, 5 tables"]}]
