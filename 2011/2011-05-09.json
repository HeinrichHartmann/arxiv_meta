We explore\nsensitivity to this assumption using the spectrum of masses arising within the\nspecific framework of large-volume string compactifications, for which the\nultraviolet completion at the gravity scale is explicitly known to be a Type\nIIB string theory. In such models the separation between M_g and M_p is\nparameterized by the (large) size of the extra dimensional volume, V (in string\nunits), according to M_p: M_g: M_KK: M_3/2 = 1: V^{-1/2}: V^{-2/3}: V^{-1}. We\nfind that the generic size of quantum corrections to masses is of the order of\nM_KK M_3/2 / M_p ~ M_p / V^{5/3}. The mass of the lighest modulus\n(corresponding to the extra-dimensional volume) which at the classical level is\nM_V ~ M_p/V^{3/2} << M_3/2 << M_KK is thus stable against quantum corrections.\nThis is possible because the couplings of this modulus to other forms of matter\nin the low-energy theory are generically weaker than gravitational strength\n(something that is also usually thought not to occur according to standard\nlore).

At roughly\nthis stage, the donors becomes degenerate, expand in size, and the systems move\ntowards longer Porb. Theory predicts that 70% of all CVs should have passed\ntheir minimum period and have sub-stellar donors, but until recently, no such\nsystems were known. I present one CV showing evidence of harbouring a sub-dwarf\ndonor, SDSS J1507+52. Due to the system's unusually short Porb of about 65 min,\nand very high space velocity, two origins for SDSS J1507+52 have been proposed;\neither the system was formed from a young WD/brown-dwarf binary, or the system\nis a halo CV. In order to distinguish between these two theories, I present UV\nspectroscopy and find a metallicity consistent with halo origin. Systems close\nto Pmin are expected to have low accretion rates. Some of these CVs show\nabsorption in their spectra, implying that the underlying WD is exposed. This\nyields a rare opportunity to study the WD in a CV. I introduce two new systems\nshowing WD signatures in their light curves and spectra, SDSS J1457+51 and BW\nScl.

The zero and low temperature\nproperties of the model are studied using rigorous renormalization group\nmethods and lattice Ward identities. In particular, it is shown that, at all\norders in renormalized perturbation theory, the Schwinger functions and the\nresponse functions decay with interaction dependent anomalous exponents.\nRegarding the 2-point Schwinger function, the wave function renormalization\ndiverges in the infrared limit, while the effective Fermi velocity flows to the\nspeed of light. Concerning the response functions, those associated to a\nKekul\\'e distortion of the honeycomb lattice and to a charge density wave\ninstability are enhanced by the electromagnetic electron-electron interactions\n(their scaling in real space is depressed), while the lowest order correction\nto the scaling exponent of the density-density response function is vanishing.\nThen, the model in presence of a fixed Kekul\\'e distortion is studied, and it\nis shown that the interaction strongly renormalizes the effective amplitude of\nthe lattice distortion. Finally, the effect of the electronic repulsion on the\nPeierls-Kekul\\'e instability is discussed by deriving a non-BCS gap equation,\nfrom which we find evidence that strong electromagnetic interactions facilitate\nthe spontaneous distortion of the lattice and the opening of a gap.

(1999) reported an upper limit on the degree of linear\npolarization of the optical afterglow for this burst (P <2.3%). One of the\ninterprtations for this small value of P was that the emission was probably due\na relativistic jet with ordered magnetic field, and the viewing angle in the\nlab frame theta' <= Gamma^{-1}, where Gamma is the bulk Lorentz factor of the\njet at the time of the optical emission. We point out that this conclusion\nresulted from a confusion between the angles measured in the lab frame and in\nthe plasma rest frame. For ordered magnetic field, one would actually obtain a\nlarge value of P because the above mentioned angle would correspond to a very\nlarge angle, theta <= \\pi/2, in the plasma rest frame. And this is probably the\ncase with the blazars. On the other hand, it is indeed possible to have P ~ 0\nif the magnetic field of GRB 990123 was completely chaotic and the viewing\nangle was considerably smaller than the semi-angle of the jet.\n","Comment: A ref. by Dai & Lu added.

For\nreasonably large values of \\Omega, as is probably suggested by the radio\nobservations, the value of Q_{FB} ~ 5.10^{51}~t_m^3~n_1 erg, for GRB970508;\nhere t_m is the epoch in months when the associated radio-blastwave degrades to\nbecome mildly relativistic. We discuss that it is unlikely that this energy,\nQ_{FB}~sim 10^{53}erg was liberated by the central engine by a direct\nelectromagnetic mode. On the other hand, as conceived by several previous\nauthors and as is suggested by supernova theories, their FB driving the blast\nwave is likely to be preceded by a much stronger neutrino burst: \\nu + anti\n\\nu- e^+ +e^-. Although, the efficiency for pair production by this latter\nroute is usually found to be as low as ~.001, we point out that for very high\nvalues of neutrino energy release Q_\\nu >Q_{FB}, it is possible that, its value\nincreses substantially. By considering that, the value of $Q_{FB}$ for such\nGRBs is indeed ~sim 10^{53} erg, we envisage that the energy of the actual\nneutrino burst/wind could be as high as ~ 10^{54-55} erg. This energy might be\nhad from general relativistic collapse of a massive stellar core having INITIAL\ngravitational mass, say, M_i~ few~M_sun to a stage having a potential well much\ndeeper than what is present on a canonican neutron star surface. Accordingly,\nwe predict that the new generation large nu elescopes may detect neutrino burst\nof energy ~10^{54-55} ergs, with neutrino energies touching ~ 1 GeV, in\ncoincidence with GRBs.\n","Comment: Many typos removed, several arguments reinforced, accepted in\n  Astronomy Astrophysics (amitra@apsara.barc.ernet.in)"]}]
