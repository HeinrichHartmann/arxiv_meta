With a 3-D shape model for the dwarf planet Haumea, we\ndemonstrate that when photometric light curve, visibility light curve, and\nvisibility phase center displacement are combined, the rotational period and\nsense of rotation can all be derived, and the rotational pole can be estimated.\nBecause of its elongated shape and the dark red spot, the rotation of Haumea\ncauses its optical photocenter to move in a loop on the sky, extending of ~80\n\\muas without the dark red spot, and ~200 \\muas with it. Such movements are\neasily detectable by space-based astrometric interferometer designed e.g. for\nplanet detection. As an example, we consider the possible contributions to the\nstudy of small bodies in the solar system by the Space Interferometry Mission.\nWe show that such a mission could make substantial contributions in\ncharacterizing the fundamental physical properties of the brightest Kuiper Belt\nObjects and Centaurs as well as a large number of main belt asteroids. We\ncompile a list of Kuiper Belt Objects and Centaurs that are potentially\nscientifically interesting and observable by such missions.\n","Comment: 44 pages, 8 figures, 1 table"]}]

Equal Mass Planetesimals"],"description":["  As to April 2010, 48 TNO (trans-Neptunian Object) binaries have been found.\nThis is about 6% of known TNOs. However, in previous theoretical studies of\nplanetary formation in the TNO region, the effect of binary formation has been\nneglected. TNO binaries can be formed through a variety of mechanisms, such as\nthree-body process, dynamical friction on two massive bodies, inelastic\ncollisions between two bodies etc. Most of these mechanisms become more\neffective as the distance from the Sun increases. In this paper, we studied\nthree-body process using direct N-body simulations. We systematically changed\nthe distance from the Sun, the number density of planetesimals, and the radius\nof the planetesimals and studied the effect of the binaries on the collision\nrate of planetesimals. In the TNO region, binaries are involved in 1/3 - 1/2 of\ncollisions, and the collision rate is increased by about a factor of a few\ncompared to the theoretical estimate for the direct two-body collisions. Thus,\nit is possible that the binaries formed through three-body process\nsignificantly enhance the collision rate and reduce the growth time scale. In\nthe terrestrial planet region, binaries are less important, because the ratio\nbetween the Hill radius and physical size of the planetesimals is relatively\nsmall. Although the time scale of our simulations is short, they clearly\ndemonstrated that the accretion process in the TNO region is quite different\nfrom that in the terrestrial planet region. Simulations which cover longer time\nscale are required to obtain more accurate estimate for the accretion\nenhancement.\n"]}]

This data\nset is accomplished with data from SOHO/MDI which offers an entire time\ncoverage. Moreover, the evolution of AR 11024 is compared with a particular\nevent of penumbra formation in AR 11124 around November 13, 2010, using\nintensity images from SDO/HMI. We conclude that two processes contribute to the\nincrease of the magnetic flux of a sunspot: (1) merging pores, and (2) emerging\nbipoles of which the spot polarity migrates towards and merges with the spot.\nAs the penumbra forms the area, magnetic flux, and maximum field strength in\nthe umbra stay constant or increase slightly, i.e. the formation of the\npenumbra is associated with flux emergence and an flux increase of the\nproto-spot. If two pores merge or if a pore merges with a proto-spot a light\nbridge is created. This initial light bridge dissolves in the further\nevolution.\n","Comment: submitted to proceedings of 'Hinode-4: unsolved problems and recent\n  insights', 11 pages, 6 figures"]}]

This corresponds to a ratio of measured\nto predicted neutrino flux of R_e^{Solar} = 0.55, in good agreement with the\nexperimental results. We achieve this result within the framework of a minimal,\nthree-generations neutrino mixing, with mass squared differences of dM^2 = 0.45\neV^2 and dm^2 = O(10^-3) eV^2. The mixing matrix derived here is characterized\nby the mixing angles theta = 35.1, beta = 5.5, and psi = 23.3, and a vanishing\nCP-violating phase, delta = 0.\n","Comment: LaTeX, 12 pages with 4 figures (EPS)"]}]
