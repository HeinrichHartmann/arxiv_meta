The dependence of the average heat\ntransferred to the bath on the initial state of the system can then be found\nfrom the expectation value of a hermitian operator, which is named as the heat\ntransfer operator (HTO). The purpose of this article is the investigation of\nthe relation between the HTOs and the associated quantum operations. Since, any\ngiven quantum operation on a system can be realized by different baths and\nunitaries, many different HTOs are possible for each quantum operation. On the\nother hand, there are also strong restrictions on the HTOs which arise from the\nunitarity of the transformations. The most important of these is the Landauer\nerasure principle. This article is concerned with the question of finding a\ncomplete set of restrictions on the HTOs that are associated with a given\nquantum operation. An answer to this question has been found only for a subset\nof quantum operations. For erasure operations, these characterizations are\nequivalent to the generalized Landauer erasure principle.

Two such systems have been proposed: (a) s-wave\nsuperconductor pair potential is proximity induced on a semiconductor, and (b)\npair potential naturally arises from an intrinsic s-wave pairing interaction.\nAs is now well known, such systems in the form of a 2D film or 1D nano-wires in\na wire-network can be used for topological quantum computation. When the\nexternal Zeeman splitting $\\Gamma$ crosses a critical value $\\Gamma_c$, the\nsystem passes from a regular superconducting phase to a non-Abelian topological\nsuperconducting phase. In both cases (a) and (b) we consider in this paper the\npair potential $\\Delta$ is strictly s-wave in both the ordinary and the\ntopological superconducting phases, which are separated by a topological\nquantum critical point at $\\Gamma_c = \\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + \\mu^2}$, where $\\mu (>>\n\\Delta)$ is the chemical potential. On the other hand, since $\\Gamma_c >>\n\\Delta$, the Zeeman splitting required for the topological phase ($\\Gamma >\n\\Gamma_c$) far exceeds the value ($\\Gamma \\sim \\Delta$) above which an s-wave\npair potential is expected to vanish (and the system to become\nnon-superconducting) in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. We are thus led to\na situation that the topological superconducting phase appears to set in a\nparameter regime at which the system actually is non-superconducting in the\nabsence of spin-orbit coupling. In this paper we address the question of how a\npure s-wave pair potential can survive a strong Zeeman field to give rise to a\ntopological superconducting phase.

To celebrate his 75th birthday, this paper reports a more\ngeneral framework of Markovian supermarket models, including a system of\ndifferential equations for the fraction measure and a system of nonlinear\nequations for the fixed point. To understand this framework heuristically, this\npaper gives a detailed analysis for three important supermarket examples: M/G/1\ntype, GI/M/1 type and multiple choices, explains how to derive the system of\ndifferential equations by means of density-dependent jump Markov processes, and\nshows that the fixed point may be simply super-exponential through solving the\nsystem of nonlinear equations. Note that supermarket models are a class of\ncomplicated queueing systems and their analysis can not apply popular queueing\ntheory, it is necessary in the study of supermarket models to summarize such a\nmore general framework which enables us to focus on important research issues.\nOn this line, this paper develops matrix-analytical methods of Markovian\nsupermarket models. We hope this will be able to open a new avenue in\nperformance evaluation of supermarket models by means of matrix-analytical\nmethods.\n","Comment: Randomized load balancing, supermarket model, matrix-analytic method,\n  super-exponential solution, density-dependent jump Markov process, Batch\n  Markovian Arrival Process (BMAP), phase-type (PH) distribution, fixed point"]}]

The method\nitself has two parts. In the first part, one chooses eigensteps---a sequence of\ninterlacing spectra---that transform the trivial spectrum into the desired one.\nThe second part is to explicitly compute the frame vectors in terms of these\neigensteps; though nontrivial, this process is nevertheless straightforward\nenough to be implemented by hand, involving only arithmetic, square roots and\nmatrix multiplication.\n"]}]
