That theory\npromised a \"general\" and \"homogeneous\" treatment of numerous questions arising\nin various 19th-century theoretical contexts, and it hinged on two theorems,\nstated independently by Jordan and Weierstrass, that would today be considered\nequivalent. It was, however, the perceived difference between those two\ntheorems that sparked the 1874 controversy. Focusing on this quarrel allows us\nto explore the algebraic identity of the polynomial practices of the\nmanipulations of forms in use before the advent of structural approaches to\nlinear algebra. The latter approaches identified these practices with methods\nfor the classification of similar matrices. We show that the prac- tices --\nJordan's canonical reduction and Kronecker's invariant computation -- reflect\nidentities inseparable from the social context of the time. Moreover, these\npractices reveal not only tacit knowledge, local ways of thinking, but also --\nin light of a long history tracing back to the work of Lagrange, Laplace, Cau-\nchy, and Hermite -- two internal philosophies regarding the significance of\ngenerality which are inseparable from two disciplinary ideals opposing algebra\nand arithmetic. By interrogating the cultural identities of such practices,\nthis study aims at a deeper understanding of the history of linear algebra\nwithout focusing on issues related to the origins of theories or structures.\n","Comment: 65 pages.

Since quantum\ngates that do not preserve the computational basis are necessary for achieving\nquantum speedups, it appears natural to define the quantumness of a quantum\ncircuit using the number of such gates. Intuitively, a reduction in the\nquantumness requires an increase in the amount of classical computation, hence\ngiving a ``quantum and classical tradeoff''.\n  In this paper we present two results on this direction. The first gives an\nasymptotic answer to the question: ``what is the minimum number of\nnon-basis-preserving gates required to generate a good approximation to a given\nstate''. This question is the quantum analogy of the following classical\nquestion, ``how many fair coins are needed to generate a given probability\ndistribution'', which was studied and resolved by Knuth and Yao in 1976. Our\nsecond result shows that any quantum algorithm that solves Grover's Problem of\nsize n using k queries and l levels of non-basis-preserving gates must have\nk*l=\\Omega(n).\n"]}]
