The mean exponent averaged over the\nentire phase space behaves quite differently from all the other cumulants.\nWhereas the mean carries information about the strength of the interaction, and\nonly indirect information about dynamical correlations, the higher cumulants\ncarry information about dynamical correlations and essentially no information\nabout the interaction strength. In particular, the variance and higher\ncumulants of the exponent are very sensitive to dynamical correlations and\neasily detect the presence of very small islands of regular motion via their\nanomalous time-scalings. The average of the stability matrix' inverse trace is\neven more sensitive to the presence of small islands and has a seemingly\nfractal behavior in the standard map parameter. The usual accelerator modes and\nthe small islands created through double saddle node bifurcations, which come\nhalfway between the positions in interaction strength of the usual accelerator\nmodes, are clearly visible in the variance, whose time scaling is capable of\ndetecting the presence of islands as small as 0.01% of the phase space.

On the other hand, the\nchanging points between traditional versus smart grid networking trend and the\ninformation security importance on the communication field reflects the\ncriticality of grid information security functional requirement identification.\nThe goal of this paper is to identify the functional requirement and relate its\nsignificance addresses to the consumer requirement of an information security\nof a smart grid. Vulnerabilities may bring forth possibility for an attacker to\npenetrate a network, make headway admission to control software, alter it to\nload conditions that destabilize the grid in unpredictable ways.

As a performance metric we use the delay stability of traffic\nflows: a traffic flow is delay stable if its expected steady-state delay is\nfinite, and delay unstable otherwise. First, we show that a heavy-tailed\ntraffic flow is delay unstable under any scheduling policy. Then, we focus on\nthe celebrated Max-Weight scheduling policy, and show that a light-tailed flow\nthat conflicts with a heavy-tailed flow is also delay unstable. This is true\nirrespective of the rate or the tail distribution of the light-tailed flow, or\nother scheduling constraints in the network.

They contain as special cases many examples of\nnatural problems apparantly occupying intermediate stages in the P-NP\nhierarchy, i.e. problems neither known to be polynomial time or NP-complete.\nLet L(F) denote the length of the binary encoding of the coefficients of a\nbinary quadratic diophantine equation F(x_1, x_2)=0. This paper shows there is\na certificate of length polynomial in L(F) that such an equation has an integer\nsolution (resp. positive integer solution) when one exists. This is interesting\nbecause it is known there exist such equations whose minimal nonnegative\ninteger solution is so large that it requires space exponential in L(F) to\nwrite it down in binary representation. The certificates are based on the ideas\nof D. Shank's \"infrastructure\".\n","Comment: 52 pages; long version of 1979 FOCS conference paper; v2 added\n  material to introduction, 62 pages"]}]

When\nthe wavenumber of perturbation is larger than the critical value, the flow is\nalways neutrally stable. First, we obtain a new upper bound for the neutral\nwavenumber $k_1\\leq (p^2-1)\\mu_1$, where $p>1$ and $\\mu_1$ is the smallest\neigenvalue of Poincar\\'{e}'s problem. Second, we find a new upper bound for the\nimaginary part of the complex phase velocity $c_i \\leq k_1 \\Delta\nU/\\sqrt{\\mu_1}$, where $\\Delta U$ is the variance of the velocity. The new\nbound is finite for all $k>0$ similar to the Howard's semicircle theorem, while\nthe previous ones by Craik and Banerjee et al would be infinity as\n$k\\rightarrow 0$. Third, we find a new upper bound of growth rate $\\omega_i\n\\leq (p-1) \\sqrt{\\mu_1} \\Delta U$. All the new bounds are much more strict than\nthe previous ones by H{\\o}iland, Howard, Craik and Banerjee et al. Our results\nalso extend the inverse energy cascade theory by Kraichnan. As shear\ninstability is due to long-wave instability, it implies that the truncation of\nlong-waves may change the instability of shear flows.\n","Comment: RevTex443 pages, no figures, continues to arXiv:physics/0512208,\n  arXiv:physics/0601043, physics/0702037, arXiv:0905.3317, arXiv:1004.3457,\n  arXiv:1101.5693"]}]
