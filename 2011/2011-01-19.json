We investigate\nthe spatial and spectral distribution of Lyalpha emission due to star-formation\nat the centre of DLAs, and its dependence on the spatial and velocity structure\nof the gas. Our model simultaneously reproduces the observed properties of DLAs\nand the faint Lyalpha emitters, including the velocity width and column density\ndistribution of DLAs and the large spatial extent of the emission of the faint\nemitters. Our modelling confirms previous suggestions that DLAs are\npredominately hosted by Dark Matter (DM) halos in the mass range\n10^{9.5}-10^{12} M_sun, and are thus of significantly lower mass than those\ninferred for L_* Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). Our modelling suggests that DM\nhalos hosting DLAs retain up to 20% of the cosmic baryon fraction in the form\nof neutral hydrogen, and that star formation at the centre of the halos is\nresponsible for the faint Lyalpha emission. The scattering of a significant\nfraction of the Lyalpha emission to the observed radii, which can be as large\nas 50 kpc or more, requires the amplitude of the bulk motions of the gas at the\ncentre of the halos to be moderate. The observed space density and size\ndistribution of the emitters together with the incidence rate of DLAs suggests\nthat the Lyalpha emission due to star formation has a duty cycle of ~ 25%.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 13 figures, Accepted for publication in Monthly Notices of\n  the Royal Astronomical Society"]}]

A\npotential solution is to search for combinations of genes that are highly\ndifferentiating even when individual genes are not. Although such techniques\nhave been developed, these approaches have not been used with GSEA to any\nsignificant degree because of the large number of potential gene combinations\nand the heterogeneity of measures that assess the differentiation provided by\ngene groups of different sizes.\n  To integrate the search for differentiating gene combinations and GSEA, we\npropose a general framework with two key components: (A) a procedure that\nreduces the number of scores to be handled by GSEA to the number of genes by\nsummarizing the scores of the gene combinations involving a particular gene in\na single score, and (B) a procedure to integrate the heterogeneous scores from\ncombinations of different sizes and from different gene combination measures by\nmapping the scores to p-values. Experiments on four gene expression data sets\ndemonstrate that the integration of GSEA and gene combination search can\nenhance the power of traditional GSEA by discovering gene sets that include\ngenes with weak individual differentiation but strong joint discriminative\npower.

This problem has recently been recognized as an important query primitive\nin XML databases. Kilpel\\\"ainen and Mannila [\\emph{SIAM J. Comput. 1995}]\npresented the first polynomial time algorithm using quadratic time and space.\nSince then several improved results have been obtained for special cases when\n$P$ and $T$ have a small number of leaves or small depth. However, in the worst\ncase these algorithms still use quadratic time and space. Let $n_S$, $l_S$, and\n$d_S$ denote the number of nodes, the number of leaves, and the %maximum depth\nof a tree $S \\in \\{P, T\\}$. In this paper we show that the tree inclusion\nproblem can be solved in space $O(n_T)$ and time: O(\\min(l_Pn_T, l_Pl_T\\log\n\\log n_T + n_T, \\frac{n_Pn_T}{\\log n_T} + n_{T}\\log n_{T})). This improves or\nmatches the best known time complexities while using only linear space instead\nof quadratic. This is particularly important in practical applications, such as\nXML databases, where the space is likely to be a bottleneck.\n","Comment: Minor updates from last time"]}]
