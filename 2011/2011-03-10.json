Batch least-squares differential\ncorrection is applied to the publicly available two-line element (TLE) catalog\nof space objects.

These resonances\nare usually believed to have multi-TeV mass due to electroweak precision\nconstraints, placing them on the edge of LHC discovery reach. Searching for\nthem is made particularly challenging because hadronically decaying electroweak\nbosons produced at such high energy will appear very similar to QCD jets. In\nthis work we revisit the possibility of discovering these resonances at the\nLHC, taking advantage of recently developed jet substructure techniques. We\nmake a systematic investigation of substructure performance for the\nidentification of highly Lorentz-boosted electroweak bosons, which should also\nbe applicable to more general new physics searches. We then estimate the\nmodel-independent Z' discovery reach for the most promising final-state\nchannels, and find significant improvements compared to previous analyses. For\nmodes involving the Higgs, we focus on a light Higgs decaying to b quarks. We\nfurther highlight several other novelties of these searches. In the case that\nvertex-based b-tagging becomes inefficient at high p_T, we explore the utility\nof a muon-based b-tag, or no b-tag at all.

We present a new algorithm\nfor error cause localization based on a reduction to the maximal satisfiability\nproblem (MAX-SAT), which asks what is the maximum number of clauses of a\nBoolean formula that can be simultaneously satisfied by an assignment. At an\nintuitive level, our algorithm takes as input a program and a failing test, and\ncomprises the following three steps. First, using symbolic execution, we encode\na trace of a program as a Boolean trace formula which is satisfiable iff the\ntrace is feasible. Second, for a failing program execution (e.g., one that\nviolates an assertion or a post-condition), we construct an unsatisfiable\nformula by taking the trace formula and additionally asserting that the input\nis the failing test and that the assertion condition does hold at the end.\nThird, using MAX-SAT, we find a maximal set of clauses in this formula that can\nbe satisfied together, and output the complement set as a potential cause of\nthe error. We have implemented our algorithm in a tool called bug-assist for C\nprograms.

Given a set of clusters, a network is said to represent\nthese clusters in the \"softwired\" sense if, for each cluster in the input set,\nat least one tree embedded in the network contains that cluster. Motivated by\nparsimony we might wish to construct such a network using as few reticulations\nas possible, or minimizing the \"level\" of the network, i.e. the maximum number\nof reticulations used in any \"tangled\" region of the network. Although these\nare NP-hard problems, here we prove that, for every fixed k >= 0, it is\npolynomial-time solvable to construct a phylogenetic network with level equal\nto k representing a cluster set, or to determine that no such network exists.\nHowever, this algorithm does not lend itself to a practical implementation. We\nalso prove that the comparatively efficient Cass algorithm correctly solves\nthis problem (and also minimizes the reticulation number) when input clusters\nare obtained from two not necessarily binary gene trees on the same set of taxa\nbut does not always minimize level for general cluster sets. Finally, we\ndescribe a new algorithm which generates in polynomial-time all binary\nphylogenetic networks with exactly r reticulations representing a set of input\nclusters (for every fixed r >= 0).\n","Comment: Submitted"]}]

Long space-time dynamics\nis derived using a perturbation expansion in the ratio of the nearest-neighbor\ndistance to a nanometer-scale characteristic length, and a theorem on the\nequivalence of long-time averages and expectation values. This dynamics is\nshown to satisfy a coarse-grained wave equation (CGWE) which takes a\nSchr\\\"odinger-like form with modified masses and interactions. The scaling of\nspace and time is determined by the orders of magnitude of various\ncontributions to the N-body potential.

The balance of these two extremes\nremoves arbitrariness in the choice of the scaling of space-time. Since the\nlong-scale dynamics of each fermion involves its interaction with many others,\nwe hypothesize that the solutions of the CGWE have mean-field character to good\napproximation, i.e., can be factorized into single-particle functions.

This method is novel in that unlike previous studies it is not\nan estimator based on total luminosity density. The cosmic spectrum is fitted\nwith models of population synthesis, tracing the history of star formation\nprior to the epoch of the observed galaxies, using a method we have developed\nwhich decouples continuum and spectral-line variations and is robust against\nspectrophotometric uncertainties. The cosmic spectrum can only be fitted with\nmodels incorporating chemical evolution and indicates there was a peak of\nstar-formation rate in the past of at least three times the current value and\nthat the increase back to z=1, assuming it scales as (1+z)^beta, has a strong\nupper limit of beta<5. We find in the general case there is some model\ndegeneracy between star formation at low and high redshift. However, if we\nincorporate previous work on star formation at z<1 we can put strong upper\nlimits on the SFR at z>1: e.g., if beta>2 then the SFR for 1<z<5 scales as\n(1+z)^alpha with alpha<2. This is equivalent to stating that no more than 80%\nof stars in the Universe formed at z>1. Our results are consistent with the\nbest-fit results from compilations of cosmic SFR estimates based on UV\nluminosity density, which give 1.8<beta<2.9 and -1.0<alpha<0.7, and are also\nconsistent with estimates of Omega_stars based on the K-band luminosity\ndensity.\n","Comment: 15 pages, accepted by ApJ; v2, mainly changes to Sections 5 and 6,\n  new figure; for the color of the universe, see also\n  http://www.pha.jhu.edu/~kgb/cosspec/"]}]

Here we employ an ultra-relativistic blast-wave\nmodel of the source, with no intrinsic variations, to study the effects of\nnanolensing on GRBs. Taken in isolation the light-curves of the caustic\ncrossings are predictable, and we find that a subset of the predicted\nlight-curves (the image-annihilating fold crossings) resemble the ``pulses''\nwhich are commonly seen in long GRBs. Furthermore, for sources at high redshift\nthe expected time between caustic crossings is of order seconds, comparable to\nthe observed time between pulses. These points suggest that it might be\npossible to model some of the observed variations of GRBs in terms of\nnanolensing; however, our simulated light-curves exhibit a small depth of\nmodulation compared to what is observed. This means that the GRB data do not\nsignificantly constrain the quasar nanolensing model; it also means that the\nsimplest nanolensing model cannot explain the observed GRB ``pulses''. Viable\nnanolensing models for pulses probably require a large external beam shear.

Assuming that the\ngas is moving in Keplerian orbits and that the radius of the broad line region\nis related to the QSO continuum luminosity, we use the velocity widths of the\nbroad lines to derive average black hole masses for the QSOs contributing to\nthe composite spectra. The resultant QSO mass-luminosity relationship is\nconsistent with M ~ L^0.97+-0.16. We find that the correlation between line\nwidth and redshift, if present, must be weak, and only CIV shows significant\nevidence of evolution. This enables us to constrain the redshift evolution of\nthe black hole mass-luminosity ratio to be ~(1+z)^beta with beta ~< 1, much\nless than the ~(1+z)^3 evolution seen in QSO luminosity evolution. Assuming\nthat the motion of the broad line region gas is Keplerian and that its radius\ndepends on the QSO luminosity, our models indicate that the observed weak\nredshift dependence is too small for the observed QSO luminosity function to be\ndue to the evolution of a single long-lived population of sources.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

This paper describes in detail the completeness and reliability of HICAT,\nwhich are calculated from the recovery rate of synthetic sources and follow-up\nobservations, respectively. HICAT is found to be 99 per cent complete at a peak\nflux of 84 mJy and an integrated flux of 9.4 Jy km/s. The overall reliability\nis 95 per cent, but rises to 99 per cent for sources with peak fluxes >58 mJy\nor integrated flux > 8.2 Jy km/s. Expressions are derived for the uncertainties\non the most important HICAT parameters: peak flux, integrated flux, velocity\nwidth, and recessional velocity. The errors on HICAT parameters are dominated\nby the noise in the HIPASS data, rather than by the parametrization procedure.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS. 12 pages, 11 figures.
