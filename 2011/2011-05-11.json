While the more massive MBH accretes in most cases as if the\ngalaxy were in isolation, the satellite MBH may undergo distinct episodes of\nenhanced accretion, owing to strong tidal torques acting on its host galaxy and\nto orbital circularization inside the disk of the primary galaxy. As a\nconsequence, the initial 1:10 mass ratio of the MBHs changes by the time the\nsatellite is disrupted. Depending on the initial fraction of cold gas in the\ngalactic disks and the geometry of the encounter, the mass ratios of the MBH\npairs at the time of satellite disruption can stay unchanged or become as large\nas 1:2. Remarkably, the efficiency of MBH orbital decay correlates with the\nfinal mass ratio of the pair itself: MBH pairs that increase significantly\ntheir mass ratio are also expected to inspiral more promptly down to\nnuclear-scale separations.

Local spin density at a radical carbon shows\ntwice a large up-spin cloud which comes from two orbital with tetrahedral\nconfiguration occupied by up-up spins.

The underlying \"boost factor\" is also\nuseful to discover scientific breakthroughs and talents much earlier than\nthrough classical citation analysis, which by now has become a widespread\nmethod to measure scientific excellence, influencing scientific careers and the\ndistribution of research funds. Our findings reveal patterns of collective\nsocial behavior, which are also interesting from an attention economics\nperspective.
