According to the so called Mermin-Wagner\ntheorem, long wavelength fluctuations destroy the long-range order for 2D\ncrystals. Similarly, 2D membranes embedded in a 3D space have a tendency to be\ncrumpled. These dangerous fluctuations can, however, be suppressed by\nanharmonic coupling between bending and stretching modes making that a\ntwo-dimensional membrane can exist but should present strong height\nfluctuations. The discovery of graphene, the first truly 2D crystal and the\nrecent experimental observation of ripples in freely hanging graphene makes\nthese issues especially important. Beside the academic interest, understanding\nthe mechanisms of stability of graphene is crucial for understanding electronic\ntransport in this material that is attracting so much interest for its unusual\nDirac spectrum and electronic properties. Here we address the nature of these\nheight fluctuations by means of straightforward atomistic Monte Carlo\nsimulations based on a very accurate many-body interatomic potential for\ncarbon. We find that ripples spontaneously appear due to thermal fluctuations\nwith a size distribution peaked around 70 \\AA which is compatible with\nexperimental findings (50-100 \\AA) but not with the current understanding of\nstability of flexible membranes. This unexpected result seems to be due to the\nmultiplicity of chemical bonding in carbon.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 6 figures"]}]

This\ncan provide a novel explanation for DAMA while avoiding many direct detection\nconstraints. The dark matter state is taken nearly degenerate with another\nstate. These states are naturally connected by a dipole moment operator, which\ncan give both the dominant scattering and decay modes between the two states.\nThe signal at DAMA then arises from dark matter scattering in the Earth into\nthe excited state and decaying back to the ground state through emission of a\nsingle photon in the detector. This model has unique signatures in direct\ndetection experiments. The density and chemical composition of the detector is\nirrelevant, only the total volume affects the event rate. In addition, the\nspectrum is a monoenergetic line, which can fit the DAMA signal well. This\nmodel is readily testable at experiments such as CDMS and XENON100 if they\nanalyze their low-energy, electronic recoil events.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 3 figures, journal version, added discussion of daily\n  modulation, changed axes label of figure 2"]}]

In particular, it allows for confining light in dimensions smaller than\nthe wavelength of photons in free space, and makes it possible to match the\ndifferent length scales associated with photonics and electronics in a single\nnanoscale device. Broad applications of plasmonics have been realized including\nbiological sensing, sub-diffraction-limit imaging, focusing and lithography,\nand nano optical circuitry. Plasmonics-based optical elements such as\nwaveguides, lenses, beam splitters and reflectors have been implemented by\nstructuring metal surfaces or placing dielectric structures on metals, aiming\nto manipulate the two-dimensional surface plasmon waves.

We start\nconsidering the behavior of a single particle and apply a random walk to\ndescribe advection/dispersion plus a Markov chain to describe kinetic sorption.\nWe show in a rigorous way that this model leads to a set of differential\nequations. For this combination of stochastic processes such a derivation is\nnew. Then, to illustrate the mechanism that leads to non-Gaussian spreading we\nanalyze this set of equations at first leaving out the Gaussian dispersion term\n(microdispersion). The set of equations now transforms to the telegrapher's\nequation. Characteristic for this system is a longitudinal spreading, that\nbecomes Gaussian only in the long-time limit. We refer to this as kinetics\ninduced spreading. When the microdispersion process is included back again, the\ncharacteristics of the telegraph equations are still present. Now two spreading\nphenomena are active, the Gaussian microdispersive spreading plus the kinetics\ninduced non-Gaussian spreading. In the long run the latter becomes Gaussian as\nwell. Another non-Gaussian feature shows itself in the 2D situation. Here, the\nlateral spread and the longitudinal displacement are no longer independent, as\nshould be the case for a 2D Gaussian spreading process. In a displacing plume\nthis interdependence is displayed as a `tailing' effect. We also analyze\nmarginal and conditional moments, which confirm this result. With respect to\neffective properties (velocity and dispersion) we conclude that effective\nparameters can be defined properly only for large times (asymptotic times). In\nthe two-dimensional case it appears that the transverse spreading depends on\nthe longitudinal coordinate. This results in `cigar-shaped' contours.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 8 figures"]}]

Re-examination of occurrence condition of optically thick\nwinds clarifies that hydrostatic evolutions, in which optically thick winds are\nsuppressed, are realized during nova outbursts on low mass white dwarfs (WDs)\n(less than about 0.7 Mo). In such a case, a nova outburst evolves very slowly,\nbecause of no strong mass-ejection, and stays at low temperature stage a long\ntime, which results in a long-lasted flat optical peak. This explains outburst\nnature of symbiotic nova PU Vul, that shows flat optical maximum lasted as long\nas eight years with no spectral indication of wind mass-loss. On the other\nhand, in ordinary nova outbursts, strong optically thick winds inevitably occur\nthat carry out most of the envelope matter very quickly.

For\nexample, a Chiral Lagrangian of Nambu-Goldstone bosons (pions), with or without\nthe Higgs (QCD) UV-completion looks the same in zero momentum limit, but the\nlatter classicalizes in high energy scattering, whereas the former does not.\nThus, theory must make a definite choice, either accept a weakly-coupled\nUV-completion or be classicalized. The UV-awareness that determines the choice\nis encoded in sub-leading structure of effective low-energy action. This\npeculiarity has to do with the fundamental fact that in classicalizing theories\nhigh energies correspond to large distances, due to existence of the extended\nclassical configurations sourced by energy. UV-fate of the theory can be\nparameterized by introducing a concept of a new quantum length-scale,\nde-classicalization radius. Classicalization is abolished when this radius is a\ndominant length. We then observe a possibility of a qualitatively new regime,\nin which a theory classicalizes only within a finite window of energies. We\nsuggest that one possible interpretation of physics above the classicality\nwindow is in terms of a quantum theory of unstable extended objects, analogous,\nfor example, to unstable QCD-type flux tubes.
