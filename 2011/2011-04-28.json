To obtain the wedge geometry we consider\nthe three-point bending of a bar, which is modelled as two rigid blocks glued\ntogether by a thin elastic interface.

Analyzing the progressive damage of the system we show that the strain\ngradient results in a rich spectrum of novel behavior of fiber bundles. We find\nthat for weak disorder an interface crack is formed as a continuous region of\nfailed fibers. Ahead the crack a process zone develops which proved to shrink\nwith increasing deformation making the crack tip sharper as the crack advances.\nFor strong disorder, failure of the system occurs as a spatially random\nsequence of breakings. Damage of the fiber bundle proceeds in bursts whose size\ndistribution shows a power law behavior with a crossover from an exponent 2.5\nto 2.0 as the disorder is weakened. The size of the largest burst increases as\na power law of the strength of disorder with an exponent 2/3 and saturates for\nstrongly disordered bundles.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 7 figures, accepted by PRE"]}]

In general, the presence of a ghost particle, which\nhas negative energy, drives the vacuum to be unstable through pair production\nof ghost particles and ordinary particles.

In such cases one can immediately conclude that the model is not\nviable. However, in the massive gravity theory we cannot construct a vacuum\nstate which respects the de Sitter invariance. Therefore the presence of a\nghost does not immediately mean the breakdown of the model. Explicitly\nestimating the number density and the energy density of particles created by\nthe pair production of two conformal scalar particles and one helicity-0 ghost\ngraviton, we find that these densities both diverge.

Furthermore, observations\nindicate that the scatter in the Sigma_SFR-Sigma_H2 relation increases rapidly\nwith decreasing averaging scale. How the scale-dependent scatter is generated\nand how one recovers a tight ~ kpc scale Sigma_SFR-Sigma_H2 relation in the\nfirst place is still largely debated.

For each measured temperature the expected dipole\ncomponent has to be calculated separately and then subtracted from the data. A\nsmall error in dipole direction, antenna pointing direction, sidelobe pickup\ncontamination, and/or timing synchronism, can raise significant deviation in\nthe dipole cleaned CMB temperature. After a full-sky observational scan, the\naccumulated deviations will be structured with a pattern closely correlated to\nthe observation pattern with artificial anisotropies on large scales, including\nartificial quadrupole, octopole etc in the final CMB map. Such scan-induced\nanisotropies on large scales can be predicted by the true dipole moment and\nobservational scan scheme. Indeed, the expected scan-induced quadrupole pattern\nof the WMAP mission is perfectly in agreement with the published WMAP\nquadrupole. With the scan strategy of the Planck mission, we predict that\nscan-induced anisotropies will also produce an artificially aligned quadrupole.\nThe scan-induced anisotropy is a common problem for all sweep missions and,\nlike the foreground emissions, has to be removed from observed maps. Without\ndoing so, CMB maps from COBE, WMAP, and Planck as well, are not reliable for\nstudying the CMB anisotropy.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

Numerical tests\ndemonstrate that the theoretical stability properties are valid in practice\nwith negligible compromises to accuracy. The result is a highly robust scheme\nwith state-of-the-art efficiency. The scheme's robustness is due to entropy\nstability, positivity and properly discretised Powell terms.

Results show comparable accuracy to standard\nFLASH with the Roe solver, but highly improved efficiency and stability,\nparticularly for high Mach number flows and low plasma beta. The tests include\n1D shock tubes, 2D instabilities and highly supersonic, 3D turbulence. We\nconsider turbulent flows with RMS sonic Mach numbers up to 10, typical of gas\nflows in the interstellar medium. We investigate both strong initial magnetic\nfields and magnetic field amplification by the turbulent dynamo from extremely\nhigh plasma beta. The energy spectra show a reasonable decrease in dissipation\nwith grid refinement, and at a resolution of 512^3 grid cells we identify a\nnarrow inertial range with the expected power-law scaling. The turbulent dynamo\nexhibits exponential growth of magnetic pressure, with the growth rate twice as\nhigh from solenoidal forcing than from compressive forcing. Two versions of the\nnew scheme are presented, using relaxation-based 3-wave and 5-wave approximate\nRiemann solvers, respectively.

While the theoretical estimates of the neutrino fluxes contain large\nuncertainties, we can formulate the conditions for the detectability of certain\nneutrino sources phenomenologically. In fact, since most galactic neutrino\nsources are transparent for TeV gamma-rays, their detectability implies a\nminimum flux of the accompanying gamma-rays. For a typical energy-dependence of\ndetection areas of km**3 volume neutrino detectors, we obtain the quantitative\ncondition I_gamma(20 TeV)>2*10^-15 ph/(cm**2 s), that thanks to the\nnormalization of the gamma-ray spectrum at 20 TeV appears to be quite robust,\ni.e. almost independent of the shape of energy spectrum of neutrinos.

This can be done by\nconsidering two decoupled harmonic oscillators on the noncommutative plane and\nevaluating the spin Hall conductivity. Focusing on the high frequency regime,\nwe obtain a diagonalized Hamiltonian. After getting the corresponding spectrum,\nwe show that there is a Hall conductivity without an external magnetic field,\nwhich is noncommutativity parameter \\theta-dependent. This allows us to make\ncontact with the spin Hall effect and also give different interpretations.\nFixing \\theta, one can recover three different approaches dealing with the\nphenomenon.\n","Comment: 17 pages"]}]
