Those applications need reliability and respect of time constraints.\nThe underlying mechanisms such as MAC and routing must handle such\nrequirements. Our approach to the time constraint problem is to bound the\nhop-count between a node and the sink and the time it takes to do a hop so the\nend-to-end delay can be bounded and the communications are thus real-time. For\nreliability purpose we propose to select forwarder nodes depending on how they\nare connected in the direction of the sink. In order to be able to do so we\nneed a coordinate (or a metric) that gives information on hop-count, that\nallows to strongly differentiate nodes and gives information on the\nconnectivity of each node keeping in mind the intrinsic constraints of WSWs\nsuch as energy consumption, autonomy, etc. Due to the efficiency and\nscalability of greedy routing in WSNs and the financial cost of GPS chips,\nVirtual Coordinate Systems (VCSs) for WSNs have been proposed. A category of\nVCSs is based on the hop-count from the sink, this scheme leads to many nodes\nhaving the same coordinate. The main advantage of this system is that the hops\nnumber of a packet from a source to the sink is known. Nevertheless, it does\nnot allow to differentiate the nodes with the same hop-count. In this report we\npropose a novel hop-count-based VCS which aims at classifying the nodes having\nthe same hop-count depending on their connectivity and at differentiating nodes\nin a 2-hop neighborhood.

The mathematical analysis\nunderlying their computation assumes that occurrences of words under interest\ndo not overlap.

The outcome is quite different when considering highly autocorrelated\nk-mers; in this case, the autocorrelation pushes down the probability of\noccurrence of these k-mers at generation 1 and, consequently, increases the\nwaiting time for apparition of these k-mers up to 40%. An analysis of existing\nTF binding sites unveils a significant proportion of k-mers exhibiting\nautocorrelation. Thus, our computations based on automata greatly improve the\naccuracy of predicting waiting times for the emergence of TF binding sites to\nappear during DNA evolution.

Though his early life was difficult,\nand his pursuit of astronomy as a career was opposed by his father, he took a\nposition at Yerkes Observatory in 1926 and remained there for the rest of his\nworking life. Thematically, his work was also a unified whole. Beginning with\nspectroscopic studies under Otto Struve at Yerkes Observatory, by the late\n1930s he concentrated particularly on the young O and B stars. His work on\nstellar classification led to the Morgan-Keenan- Kellman [MKK] system of\nclassification of stars, and later - as he grappled with the question of the\nintrinsic color and brightness of stars at great distances - to the\nJohnson-Morgan UBV system for measuring stellar colors. Eventually these\nconcerns with classification and method led to his greatest single achievement\n- the recognition of the nearby spiral arms of our Galaxy by tracing the OB\nassociations and HII regions that outline them. After years of intensive work\non the problem of galactic structure, the discovery came in a blinding flash of\nArchimedean insight as he walked under the night sky between his office and his\nhouse in the autumn of 1951. His optical discovery of the spiral arms preceded\nthe radio-mapping of the spiral arms by more than a year. Morgan suffered a\nnervous breakdown soon after he announced his discovery, however, and so was\nprevented from publishing a complete account of his work. As a result of that,\nand the announcement soon afterward of the first radio maps of the spiral arms,\nthe uniqueness of his achievement was not fully appreciated at the time.\n","Comment: 21 pages in Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage"]}]

Simultaneous PQ-Ordering asks whether orders of the leaves of\neach of the trees can be chosen simultaneously, that is, for every child-parent\nrelation the order chosen for the parent is an extension of the order chosen\nfor the child. We show that Simultaneous PQ-Ordering is NP-complete in general\nand that it is efficiently solvable for a special subset of instances, the\n2-fixed instances.

Modern\nnonlinear methods, such as Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA),\ndemonstrate the ability to reveal the regularities of the system behavior.\nThus, they can be useful for the analysis of the market state in real time. In\npresent paper we did an effort to apply the RQA for the purpose of economic\ntime series monitoring. 12 stock indexes, 6 currency pairs and 4 commodities\nwere taken for the study.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 14 figures"]}]
