We\nfirst briefly summarise the main results of the full theoretical description we\nhave given elsewhere, presenting them in a more physical way, aimed to an\nunderstanding without the requirement of extended knowledge of dynamical\nsystems or of orbital structure. We introduce in this manner the notion of\nmanifolds, which can be thought of as tubes guiding the orbits. The dynamics of\nthese manifolds can govern the properties of spirals and of inner and outer\nrings in barred galaxies. We find that the bar strength affects how unstable\nthe L1 and L2 Lagrangian points are, the motion within the 5A5A5Amanifold tubes\nand the time necessary for particles in a manifold to make a complete turn\naround the galactic centre. We also show that the strength of the bar, or, to\nbe more precise, of the non-axisymmetric forcing at and somewhat beyond the\ncorotation region, determines the resulting morphology. Thus, less strong bars\ngive rise to R1 rings or pseudorings, while stronger bars drive R2, R1R2 and\nspiral morphologies. We examine the morphology as a function of the main\nparameters of the bar and present descriptive two dimensional plots to that\navail. We also derive how the manifold morphologies and properties are modified\nif the L1 and L2 Lagrangian points become stable. Finally, we discuss how\ndissipation affects the manifold properties and compare the manifolds in\ngas-like and in stellar cases.

Previous attempts to\nmeasure fesc have found a wide range of values, varying from less than 0.01 to\nnearly 1. Rather than finding a single value of fesc, we clarify through\nmodeling how internal properties of galaxies affect fesc through the density\nand distribution of neutral hydrogen within the galaxy, along with the rate of\nionizing photons production. We find that the escape fraction depends\nsensitively on the covering factor of clumps, along with the density of the\nclumped and interclump medium. One must therefore be cautious when dealing with\nan inhomogeneous medium. Fewer, high-density clumps lead to a greater escape\nfraction than more numerous low-density clumps. When more ionizing photons are\nproduced in a starburst, fesc increases, as photons escape more readily from\nthe gas layers. Large variations in the predicted escape fraction, caused by\ndifferences in the hydrogen distribution, may explain the large observed\ndifferences in fesc among galaxies. Values of fesc must also be consistent with\nthe reionization history. High-mass galaxies alone are unable to reionize the\nuniverse, because fesc > 1 would be required. Small galaxies are needed to\nachieve reionization, with greater mean escape fraction in the past.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 8 figures.

We\ntreat di-neutron clustering by solving the two neutron relative wave function\nprecisely by using the bare nucleon-nucleon interaction so that the spatial\nclustering structure is obtained quantitatively within the whole 11Li nucleus.\nThis di-neutron clustering is an essential dynamics to form the halo structure\nby making a compact di-neutron cluster, which distributes loosely around the\n9Li core. The di-neutron clustering is a new concept and is a general\nphenomenon in neutron skin and neutron halo nuclei. This quantitative\ndescription of di-neutron clustering has made it necessary to consider another\nimportant deuteron-like tensor correlation, which is caused by strong tensor\ninteraction in the nucleon-nucleon interaction. The tensor interaction\noriginates from pion exchange and known to provide large attraction to form the\n4He nucleus. The unique feature of the tensor correlation is to make highly\ncorrelated deuteron-like excitation, which interferes with shell model like\nstructure in a unique way. This dynamical effect removes the magic number\neffect and makes easy the participation of the s-wave neutrons. Hence, there\nare pairing and deuteron-like tensor correlations in addition to the mean field\nstructure in 9Li.

The concentration power of an optical\nmodule, which determines primarily the telescope's sensitivity, is in general\nexpressed by its on-axis effective area as a function of the X-ray energy.\nNevertheless, the effective area of X-ray mirrors in general decreases as the\nsource moves off-axis, with a consequent loss of sensitivity. To make matters\nworse, the dense nesting of mirror shells in an optical module results in a\nmutual obstruction of their aperture when an astronomical source is off-axis,\nwith a further effective area reduction. [...] While the effective area of an\nX-ray mirror is easy to predict on-axis, the same task becomes more difficult\nfor a source off-axis. It is therefore important to develop an appropriate\nformalism to reliably compute the off-axis effective area of a Wolter-I mirror,\nincluding the effect of obstructions. Most of collecting area simulation for\nX-ray optical modules has been so far performed along with numerical codes,\ninvolving ray-tracing routines, very effective but in general complex,\ndifficult to handle, time consuming and affected by statistical errors.

We give an explicit construction of these projectors by reducing\nit to the simple problem of addition of angular momentum in ordinary\nnon-relativistic quantum mechanics. The diagonalizationof the dilatation\noperator reduces to solving three term recursion relations. The fact that the\nrecursion relations have only three terms is a direct consequence of the weak\nmixing at one loop of the restricted Schur polynomials. The recursion relations\ncan be solved exactly in terms of symmetric Kravchuk polynomials or in terms of\nClebsch-Gordan coefficients. This proves that the dilatation operator reduces\nto a decoupled set of harmonic oscillators and therefore it is integrable.\n","Comment: 1+51 pages, 3 figures, v2: typos fixed"]}]

Firstly, the Anderson transition is studied\nfor the BCC and FCC lattices. We obtain high precision results for the critical\ndisorder at the band centre and the critical exponent. Comparing the critical\ndisorder between the SC, BCC and FCC lattices, an increase is observed as a\nfunction of the coordination number of the lattice. The critical exponent is\nfound to be approximately 1.5 in agreement with the value for the SC lattice.\nEnergy-disorder phase diagrams are plotted for both lattice types. Next, we\nconsider the Aharonov-Bohm effect for an exciton in a 1D ring. The aim is to\ndetermine how the addition of a constant electric field in the plane of the\nring affects the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations. We observe an inversion of the\noscillations in the oscillator strength at a critical electric field, with the\noscillation minimum reaching zero at half a magnetic flux quantum. This\nsuggests a possible process for controlling the formation and recombination of\nexcitons through tuning the applied fields. The final section is concerned with\ncollective excitations of graphene in a strong perpendicular magnetic field.\nThe oscillator strengths and energies of collective excitations are calculated\nand the good quantum numbers identified. In particular, we study those arising\nfrom the SU(4) symmetry, which is due to two spin and two valley pseudospin\nprojections. This enables us to determine the multiplet structure of the\nstates. In addition to neutral collective excitations or excitons, we\ninvestigate the possible formation of charged collective excitations or trions\nfrom nearly full or nearly empty Landau levels.

The\nproposed setup is extremely simple, and composed of as few as two simple\nelements. These are the gas cell, to be filled with noble gas, and a short\nmagnetic chicane. The installation of the magnetic chicane does not perturb the\nundulator focusing system and does not interfere with the baseline mode of\noperation. In this paper we assess the features of gas monochromator based on\nthe use of He and Ne. We analyze the processes in the monochromator gas cell\nand outside it, touching upon the performance of the differential pumping\nsystem as well. We study the feasibility of using the proposed self-seeding\ntechnique to generate narrow bandwidth soft X-ray radiation in the LCLS-II soft\nX-ray beam line. We present conceptual design, technical implementation and\nexpected performances of the gas monochromator self-seeding scheme.\n"]}]

The property of the\nparticles to be free means as usual that the representation describing a\nmany-particle system is the tensor product of the corresponding single-particle\nrepresentations (i.e. no interaction is introduced). It is shown that the mass\noperator contains only continuous spectrum in the interval $(-\\infty,\\infty)$\nand such representations are unitarily equivalent to ones describing\ninteractions (gravitational, electromagnetic etc.). This means that there are\nno bound states in the theory and the Hilbert space of the many-particle system\ncontains a subspace of states with the following property: the action of free\nrepresentation operators on these states is manifested in the form of different\ninteractions. Possible consequences of the results are discussed.\n","Comment: 35 pages, Latex"]}]
