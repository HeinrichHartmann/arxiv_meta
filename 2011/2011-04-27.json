The standard method for modeling fluctuations in the states of ion\nchannels uses continuous-time Markov chains nonlinearly coupled to a\ndifferential equation for voltage. Beginning with the work of Fox and Lu, there\nhave been attempts to generate simpler models that use stochastic differential\nequation (SDEs) to approximate the stochastic spiking activity produced by\nMarkov chain models. Recent numerical investigations, however, have raised\ndoubts that SDE models can preserve the stochastic dynamics of Markov chain\nmodels.\n  We analyze three SDE models that have been proposed as approximations to the\nMarkov chain model: one that describes the states of the ion channels and two\nthat describe the states of the ion channel subunits. We show that the former\nchannel-based approach can capture the distribution of channel noise and its\neffect on spiking in a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model to a degree not previously\ndemonstrated, but the latter two subunit-based approaches cannot. Our analysis\nprovides intuitive and mathematical explanations for why this is the case: the\ntemporal correlation in the channel noise is determined by the combinatorics of\nbundling subunits into channels, and the subunit-based approaches do not\ncorrectly account for this structure. Our study therefore confirms and\nelucidates the findings of previous numerical investigations of subunit-based\nSDE models. Moreover, it presents the first evidence that Markov chain models\nof the nonlinear, stochastic dynamics of neural membranes can be accurately\napproximated by SDEs.

In our paper we explain this phenomenon based on high-precision\nscans of pebbles which exhibit similar behavior. We construct their convex hull\nand the heteroclinic graph carrying their equilibrium points. By systematic\nsimplification of the arising Morse-Smale complex in a one-parameter process we\nshow that equilibria occur typically in highly localized groups (flocks), the\nnumber of the latter can be reliably observed and determined by hand\nexperiments. Both local and global (micro and macro) equilibria can be either\nstable or unstable. Most commonly, rocks and pebbles are balanced on stable\nlocal equilibria belonging to stable flocks. However, it is possible to balance\na convex body on a stable local equilibrium belonging to an unstable flock and\nthis is the intriguing mechanical scenario corresponding to rocking stones.\nSince outside observers can only reliably perceive flocks, the last described\nsituation will appear counter-intuitive. Comparison of computer experiments to\nhand experiments reveals that the latter are consistent, i.e. the flocks can be\nreliably counted and the pebble classification system proposed in our previous\nwork (Domokos et al 2010) is robustly applicable. We also find an interesting\nlogarithmic relationship between the Zingg parameters and the average number of\nglobal equilibrium points, indicating a close relationship between the two\nsystems.\n"]}]

In two\ndecades, phenomena as diverse as earthquakes, granular piles, snow avalanches,\nsolar flares, superconducting vortices, sub-critical fracture, evolution, and\neven stock market crashes have been reported to evolve through scale invariant\navalanches. The theory, based on the key axiom that a critical state is an\nattractor of the dynamics, presented an exponent close to -1 (in two\ndimensions) for the power-law distribution of avalanche sizes. However, the\nmajority of real phenomena classified as SOC present smaller exponents, i.e.,\nlarger absolute values of negative exponents, a situation that has provoked a\nlot of confusion in the field of scale invariant avalanches. The main goal of\nthis chapter is to shed light on this issue. The essential role of the exponent\nvalue of the power-law distribution of avalanche sizes is discussed. The\nexponent value controls the ratio of small and large events, the energy balance\n--required for stationary systems-- and the critical properties of the\ndynamics. A condition of criticality is introduced. As the exponent value\ndecreases, there is a decrease of the critical properties, and consequently the\nsystem becomes, in principle, predictable. Prediction of scale invariant\navalanches in both experiments and simulations are presented.
