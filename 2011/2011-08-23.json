In order to be complete, they should also fulfil the minimal\ncondition of macroscopic realism. Under the assumption of outcome determinism\nand for Hilbert space dimension greater than two, they were all proved to be\ncontextual for projective measurements. In the recent years a generalized\nconcept of non-contextuality was introduced that applies also to the case of\noutcome indeterminism and unsharp measurements. It was pointed out that the\nBeltrametti-Bugajski model is an example of measurement non-contextual\nindeterminist theory. Here we provide a simple proof that this model is the\nonly one with such a feature for projective measurements and Hilbert space\ndimension greater than two. As a corollary, von Neumann measurement\nnon-contextuality implies non-contextuality for unsharp measurements. By noting\nthat the Beltrametti-Bugajski model does not satisfy the condition of\nmacroscopic realism, we arrive at the conclusion that the only way to solve the\nmeasurement problem in the framework of an ontological theory is relaxing the\nhypothesis of non-contextuality in its generalized sense.\n"]}]

Heat shock is a\nwell-characterized model of cellular dynamics. S. cerevisiae is an appropriate\nmodel organism, since both its protein-protein interaction network\n(interactome) and stress response at the gene expression level have been well\ncharacterized. However, the analysis of the reorganization of the yeast\ninteractome during stress has not been investigated yet. We calculated the\nchanges of the interaction-weights of the yeast interactome from the changes of\nmRNA expression levels upon heat shock. The major finding of our study is that\nheat shock induced a significant decrease in both the overlaps and connections\nof yeast interactome modules. In agreement with this the weighted diameter of\nthe yeast interactome had a 4.9-fold increase in heat shock. Several key\nproteins of the heat shock response became centers of heat shock-induced local\ncommunities, as well as bridges providing a residual connection of modules\nafter heat shock. The observed changes resemble to a \"stratus-cumulus\" type\ntransition of the interactome structure, since the unstressed yeast interactome\nhad a globally connected organization, similar to that of stratus clouds,\nwhereas the heat shocked interactome had a multifocal organization, similar to\nthat of cumulus clouds. Our results showed that heat shock induces a partial\ndisintegration of the global organization of the yeast interactome. This change\nmay be rather general occurring in many types of stresses. Moreover, other\ncomplex systems, such as single proteins, social networks and ecosystems may\nalso decrease their inter-modular links, thus develop more compact modules, and\ndisplay a partial disintegration of their global structure in the initial phase\nof crisis. Thus, our work may provide a model of a general, system-level\nadaptation mechanism to environmental changes.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, 70 references + 22 pages 8 figures, 4\n  tables and 8 references in the enclosed Supplement"]}]

The\none-parameter linear bias model is almost certainly oversimplified, which leads\nto the obvious question: What is the quantity beta that is actually measured by\ndifferent techniques? To address this question, we estimate beta from galaxy\ndistributions that are constructed by applying a variety of locally biased\ngalaxy formation models to cosmological N-body simulations. We compare the\nvalues of beta estimated using three different techniques: a density-density\ncomparison similar to the POTENT analysis, a velocity-velocity comparison\nsimilar to the VELMOD analysis, and an anisotropy analysis of the\nredshift-space power spectrum.

We measure the abundance variations of numerous elements in\nthese low mass stars with a range of ages (1-15Gyr old). This means that we can\neffectively measure the chemical evolution of these galaxies WITH TIME. Our\nresults show a significant spread in metallicity with age, but an overall trend\nconsistent with what might be expected from a closed (or perhaps leaky) box\nchemical evolution scenario over the last 10-15Gyr. We notice that each of\nthese galaxies show broadly similar abundance patterns for all elements\nmeasured. This suggests a fairly uniform progression of chemical evolution with\ntime, despite quite a large range of star formation histories. It seems likely\nthat these galaxies had similar initial conditions, and evolve in a similar\nmanner with star formation occurring at a uniformly low rate, even if at\ndifferent times. With our accurate measurements we find evidence for small\nvariations in abundances which are correlated to variations in star formation\nhistories. The alpha-elements suggest that dSph chemical evolution has not been\naffected by very high mass stars (>15-20 Msun). The abundance patterns we\nmeasure for stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies are significantly different from\nthose typically observed in the disk, bulge and inner-halo of our Galaxy. This\nsuggests that it is NOT possible to construct a significant fraction of our\nGalaxy from STARS formed in these dwarf spheroidal galaxies which subsequently\nmerged into our own. Any merger scenario involving dSph has to occur in the\nvery early Universe whilst they are still gas rich, so the majority of mass\ntransfer is gas, and few stars.\n","Comment: 36 pages, 5 tables, 21 figures, accepted by AJ for Feb 2003"]}]

We\nfind a well--defined, narrow region of parameter space which provides the\nobserved relic density of dark matter, in a domain selected to fit precision\nelectroweak data, including top, bottom and tau masses. The model is highly\nconstrained which allows us to make several predictions. We find the light\nHiggs mass $m_h \\leq 121 \\pm 3$ GeV and also upper bounds on the mass of the\ngluino $\\mgluino\\lsim3.1$ TeV and lightest neutralino $\\mchi\\lsim450$ GeV. As\nthe CP odd Higgs mass $m_A$ increases, the region of parameter space consistent\nwith WMAP data is forced to larger values of $M_{1/2}$ and smaller values of\n$m_h$. Hence, we find an upper bound $m_A \\lsim 1.3$ TeV. This in turn leads to\nlower bounds on ${\\rm BR}(B_s\\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-) > 10^{-8}$ (assuming minimal\nflavor violation) and on the dark matter spin independent detection cross\nsection $\\sigsip > 10^{-9}$ pb.
