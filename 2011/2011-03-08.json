When expressed in terms of the pure Goldstone modes, this\ntheory looks essentially nonlinear and contains a variety of Lorentz and CPT\nviolating couplings. Nonetheless, all SLIV effects turn out to be strictly\ncancelled in all the lowest order processes considered, provided that the\ntensor field gravity theory is properly extended to general relativity (GR).\nSo, as we generally argue, the measurable effects of SLIV, induced by\nelementary vector or tensor fields, are related to the accompanying gauge\nsymmetry breaking rather than to spontaneous Lorentz violation. The latter\nappears by itself to be physically unobservable, only resulting in a\nnon-covariant gauge choice in an otherwise gauge invariant and Lorentz\ninvariant theory. However, while Goldstonic vector and tensor field theories\nwith exact local invariance are physically indistinguishable from conventional\ngauge theories, there might appear some principal distinctions if this local\nsymmetry were slightly broken at very small distances controlled by quantum\ngravity in an explicit, rather than spontaneous, way that could eventually\nallow one to differentiate between them observationally.\n","Comment: 15 pages, some minor additions made"]}]

With increasing electron-phonon\ncoupling, the dynamic charge structure factor reveals the emergence of a charge\ngap, and a clear signature of phonon softening at the zone boundary. The\nsingle-particle spectral function evolves continuously across the transition.\nHybridization of the charge and phonon modes of the Luttinger liquid\ndescription leads to two modes, one of which corresponds to the coherent\npolaron band. This band acquires a gap upon entering the Peierls phase, whereas\nthe other mode constitutes the incoherent, high-energy spectrum with backfolded\nshadow bands. Coherent polaronic motion is a direct consequence of quantum\nlattice fluctuations. In the strong-coupling regime, the spectrum is described\nby the static, mean-field limit. Importantly, whereas finite electron density\nin general leads to screening of polaron effects, the latter reappear at half\nfilling due to charge ordering and lattice dimerization.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 7 figures, final version"]}]

The 12CO molecule (J=1-0 transition =\n115.27 GHz) is the best proxy for extragalactic H2, which is the gas reservoir\nfrom which star formation occurs, and has been detected out to z~6. Typically,\nredshifted high-J lines are observed at mm-wavelengths, the most commonly\ntargeted systems exhibiting high SFRs (e.g. submm galaxies), and far-IR-bright\nQSOs. While the most luminous objects are the most readily observed, detections\nof more typical galaxies with modest SFRs are essential for completing the\npicture.

The required\nhigh xenon purity is usually achieved by continuous recirculation of xenon gas\nthrough a high-temperature getter. This challenges the traditional way of\ncooling these large detectors, since in a thermally well insulated detector,\nmost of the cooling power is spent to compensate losses from recirculation. The\nphase change during recondensing requires five times more cooling power than\ncooling the gas from ambient temperature to -100C (173 K). Thus, to reduce the\ncooling power requirements for large detectors, we propose to use the heat from\nthe purified incoming gas to evaporate the outgoing xenon gas, by means of a\nheat exchanger. Generally, a heat exchanger would appear to be only of very\nlimited use, since evaporation and liquefaction occur at zero temperature\ndifference. However, the use of a recirculation pump reduces the pressure of\nthe extracted liquid, forces it to evaporate, and thus cools it down. We show\nthat this temperature difference can be used for an efficient heat exchange\nprocess. We investigate the use of a commercial parallel plate heat exchanger\nwith a small liquid xenon detector. Although we expected to be limited by the\navailable cooling power to flow rates of about 2 SLPM, rates in excess of 12\nSLPM can easily be sustained, limited only by the pump speed and the impedance\nof the flow loop. The heat exchanger operates with an efficiency of (96.8 +/-\n0.5)%. This opens the possibility for fast xenon gas recirculation in\nlarge-scale experiments, while minimizing thermal losses.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures"]}]

In this approach, the similar aperture profile along the fluid flow\ndirection is mapped in to a network space. The modeled permeability using the\nLBM shows good correlation with the experimental measured values. Furthermore,\nthe two main characters of the obtained networks, i.e., characteristic length\nand number of edges show the same evolutionary trend with the modeled\npermeability values. Analysis of motifs through the obtained networks showed\nthe most transient sub-graphs are much more frequent in residual stages.

In this algebraic framework we define an uniquely\ndetermined axiom system, by extending the classic 2-valued distributive lattice\nlogic (DLL) by a new set of sequent axioms for many-valued logic connectives.\nDually, in an autoreferential Kripke-style framework we obtain a uniquely\ndetermined frame, where each possible world is an equivalence class of\nLindenbaum algebra for a many-valued logic as well, represented by a truth\nvalue.\n","Comment: 21 pages"]}]
