The first experimental evidence of\nthe two-dimensional nature of graphene came from the observation of a sequence\nof plateaus in measurements of its transport properties in the presence of an\napplied magnetic field. These are signatures of the so-called integer quantum\nHall effect. However, as a consequence of the relativistic character of the\ncharge carriers, the integer quantum Hall effect observed in graphene is\nqualitatively different from its semiconductor analogue. As a third\ndistinguishing feature of graphene, it has been conjectured that interactions\nand correlations should be important in this material, but surprisingly,\nevidence of collective behaviour in graphene is lacking. In particular, the\nquintessential collective quantum behaviour in two dimensions, the fractional\nquantum Hall effect (FQHE), has so far resisted observation in graphene despite\nintense efforts and theoretical predictions of its existence. Here we report\nthe observation of the FQHE in graphene. Our observations are made possible by\nusing suspended graphene devices probed by two-terminal charge transport\nmeasurements. This allows us to isolate the sample from substrate-induced\nperturbations that usually obscure the effects of interactions in this system\nand to avoid effects of finite geometry. At low carrier density, we find a\nfield-induced transition to an insulator that competes with the FQHE, allowing\nits observation only in the highest quality samples.

We consider two natural\nmeasures of social welfare: the ordinal welfare factor which measures the\nnumber of agents that are at least as happy as in some unknown, arbitrary\nbenchmark allocation, and the linear welfare factor which assumes an agent's\nutility linearly decreases down his preference lists, and measures the total\nutility to that achieved by an optimal allocation. We analyze two matching\nmechanisms which have been extensively studied by economists. The first\nmechanism is the random serial dictatorship (RSD) where agents are ordered in\naccordance with a randomly chosen permutation, and are successively allocated\ntheir best choice among the unallocated items. The second mechanism is the\nprobabilistic serial (PS) mechanism of Bogomolnaia and Moulin [8], which\ncomputes a fractional allocation that can be expressed as a convex combination\nof integral allocations. The welfare factor of a mechanism is the infimum over\nall instances. For RSD, we show that the ordinal welfare factor is\nasymptotically 1/2, while the linear welfare factor lies in the interval [.526,\n2/3].

Numbers are almost universally represented\nusing position based notations based on exponential powers of a base number -\nusually 10. This representations is computationally efficient for the standard\narithmetic operations, but it is not efficient for factorisation. This has led\nto a common confusion that factorisation is inherently computationally hard. We\npropose a new representation of the natural numbers based on bags and using the\nprime successor function as a primitive - prime bags (PBs). This data structure\nis more efficient for most arithmetic operations, and enables numbers can be\nefficiently factored. However, it also has the interesting feature that\naddition appears to be computationally hard. PBs have an interesting\nalternative interpretation as partitions of numbers represented in the standard\nway, and this reveals a novel relationship between prime numbers and the\npartition function. The PB representation can be extended to rational and\nirrational numbers, and this provides the most direct proof of the\nirrationality of the square root of 2.

The interaction\nof tokens makes the dynamics of the protocol very difficult to analyze. In this\npaper we study the expected time to stabilization in terms of the initial\nconfiguration. It is straightforward that the algorithm achieves stabilization\nalmost surely from any initial configuration, and it is known that the\nworst-case expected time to stabilization (with respect to the initial\nconfiguration) is Theta(N^2). Our first contribution is to give an upper bound\nof 0.64 N^2 on the expected stabilization time, improving on previous upper\nbounds and reducing the gap with the best existing lower bound. We also\nintroduce an asynchronous version of the protocol, showing a similar O(N^2)\nconvergence bound in this case. Assuming that errors arise from the corruption\nof some number k of bits, where k is fixed independently of the size of the\nring, we show that the expected time to stabilization is O(N). This reveals a\nhitherto unknown and highly desirable property of Herman's algorithm: it\nrecovers quickly from bounded errors.
