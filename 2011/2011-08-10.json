In this note,\nwe propose high-dimensional survival analysis through a new application of\nboosting, a powerful tool in machine learning. Our approach is based on an\naccelerated lifetime model and minimizing the sum of pairwise differences in\nresiduals. We apply our method to a recent microarray study of lung\nadenocarcinoma and find that our ensemble is composed of 19 genes, while a\nproportional hazards (PH) ensemble is composed of nine genes, a proper subset\nof the 19-gene panel. In one of our simulation scenarios, we demonstrate that\nPH boosting in a misspecified model tends to underfit and ignore\nmoderately-sized covariate effects, on average. Diagnostic analyses suggest\nthat the PH assumption is not satisfied in the microarray data and may explain,\nin part, the discrepancy in the sets of active coefficients. Our simulation\nstudies and comparative data analyses demonstrate how statistical learning by\nPH models alone is insufficient.\n","Comment: Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/10-AOAS426 the Annals of\n  Applied Statistics (http://www.imstat.org/aoas/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)"]}]
