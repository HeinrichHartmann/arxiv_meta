Over the past century, specific attention has been directed\nto the role played by dispersal in shaping plant communities, or on the\ndynamics of marine open-ocean and intertidal systems, or on biological\ninvasions, or on the spread of disease, to name a few. Mathematicians and\ntheoreticians, starting with the efforts of researchers that include Aronson,\nFisher, Kolmogorov, Levin, Okubo, Skellam, Slobodkin, Weinberger and many\nothers, set the foundation of a fertile area of research at the interface of\necology, mathematics, population biology and evolutionary biology.\nIntegrodifference systems, the subject of this manuscript, arise naturally in\nthe study of the spatial dispersal of organisms whose local population dynamics\nare prescribed by models with discrete generations. The brunt of the\nmathematical research has focused on the the study of existence traveling wave\nsolutions and characterizations of the spreading speed particularly, in the\ncontext of cooperative systems. In this paper, we characterize the spreading\nspeed for a large class of non cooperative systems, all formulated in terms of\nintegrodifference equations, by the convergence of initial data to wave\nsolutions. In this setting, the spreading speed is characterized as the slowest\nspeed of a family of non-constant traveling wave solutions. Our results are\napplied to a specific non-cooperative competition system in detail.\n","Comment: A number of changes have been made to improve the presentation, in\n  particular, in Section 5"]}]

The aim is to jointly optimize end-to-end transport layer\nrates, network code design variables, broadcast link flows, link capacities,\naverage power consumption, and short-term power allocation policies. As in the\nrouting paradigm where nodes simply forward packets, the cross-layer\noptimization problem with network coding is non-convex in general. It is proved\nhowever, that with network coding, dual decomposition for multicast is optimal\nso long as the fading at each wireless link is a continuous random variable.\nThis lends itself to provably convergent subgradient algorithms, which not only\nadmit a layered-architecture interpretation but also optimally integrate\nnetwork coding in the protocol stack. The dual algorithm is also paired with a\nscheme that yields near-optimal network design variables, namely multicast\nend-to-end rates, network code design quantities, flows over the broadcast\nlinks, link capacities, and average power consumption. Finally, an asynchronous\nsubgradient method is developed, whereby the dual updates at the physical layer\ncan be affordably performed with a certain delay with respect to the resource\nallocation tasks in upper layers.

As for H2O, the main processes after UV photodissociation are\ntrapping and desorption. There are three desorption processes: D atom, OD\nradical, and D2O molecule photodesorption. D2O desorption takes places either\nby direct desorption of a recombined D2O molecule, or when an energetic D atom\nproduced by photodissociation kicks a surrounding D2O molecule out of the\nsurface by transferring part of its momentum. Desorption probabilities are\ncompared quantitatively with those for H2O obtained from previous MD\nsimulations of UV photodissociation of amorphous water ice. The main\nconclusions are the same, but the average D atom photodesorption probability is\nsmaller than that of the H atom (by about a factor of 0.9) because D has lower\nkinetic energy than H, whereas the average OD radical photodesorption\nprobability is larger than that of OH (by about a factor of 2.5-2.9 depending\non Tice) because OD has higher translational energy than OH for every Tice\nstudied. The average D2O photodesorption probability is larger than that of H2O\n(by about a factor of 1.4-2.3 depending on Tice), and this is entirely due to a\nlarger contribution of the D2O kick-out mechanism. This is an isotope effect:\nthe kick-out mechanism is more efficient for D2O ice, because the D atom formed\nafter D2O photodissociation has a larger momentum than photogenerated H atoms\nfrom H2O, and D transfers momentum more easily to D2O than H to H2O. The total\nyield has been compared with experiments and the total yield from previous\nsimulations.

In this paper, given a cycle structure of a\nLatin square autotopism, it is studied the regularity of the incidence\nstructure formed by the set of autotopisms having this cycle structure and the\nset of Latin squares remaining stable by at least one of the previous\nautotopisms. Moreover, it is proven that every substructure given by the\nisotopism class of a Latin square is a 1-$(v,k,r)$ design. Since the\ncorresponding parameter $k$ is known for Latin squares of order up to 7, we\nobtain the rest of the parameters of all these substructures and, consequently,\na classification of all possible symmetries is reached for these orders.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 6 tables"]}]

We give a reformulation of the Euler equations\nas a differential inclusion, and in this way we obtain transparent proofs of\nseveral celebrated results of V. Scheffer and A. Shnirelman concerning the\nnon-uniqueness of weak solutions and the existence of energy--decreasing\nsolutions. Our results are stronger because they work in any dimension and\nyield bounded velocity and pressure.\n","Comment: 16 pages; v2: corrected typos, simplified some proofs; v3: 20 pages,\n  added a second (more direct) proof"]}]
