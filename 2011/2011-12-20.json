In\nagreement with previous results in the literature, our results show that the\nonset of runaway collapse (formation of the first star) in subcritical clouds\nis significantly accelerated by nonlinear flows in which a large-scale wave\nmode dominates the power spectrum. In addition, we find that a power spectrum\nwith equal energy on all scales also accelerates collapse, but by a lesser\namount. For a highly super-Alfvenic initial velocity field with most power on\nthe largest scales, the collapse occurs promptly during the initial compression\nwave. However, for trans-Alfvenic perturbations, a subcritical magnetic field\ncauses a rebound from the initial compression, and the system undergoes several\noscillations before runaway collapse occurs. Models that undergo prompt\ncollapse have highly supersonic infall motions at the core boundaries. Cores in\nmagnetically subcritical models with trans-Alfvenic initial perturbations also\npick up significant systematic speeds by inheriting motions associated with\nmagnetically-driven oscillations. Core mass distributions are much broader than\nin models with small-amplitude initial perturbations, although the disturbed\nstructure of cores that form due to nonlinear flows does not guarantee\nsubsequent monolithic collapse.

A merit of\nthis approach is its flexibility: for example, all compressed sensing problems\ncan be solved via this approach. These include models with objective\nfunctionals such as the total-variation norm, ||Wx||_1 where W is arbitrary, or\na combination thereof. In addition, the paper also introduces a number of\ntechnical contributions such as a novel continuation scheme, a novel approach\nfor controlling the step size, and some new results showing that the smooth and\nunsmoothed problems are sometimes formally equivalent.

This can be characterized in the form of preferences. Players\nwould prefer to get the secret than to not get it and secondly with lesser\npreference, they would like as few other players to get the secret as possible.\nSeveral positive results have already been published to efficiently solve the\nproblem of rational secret sharing but only a handful of papers have touched\nupon the use of an asynchronous broadcast channel. [2] used cryptographic\nprimitives, [3] used an interactive dealer, and [4] used an honest minority of\nplayers in order to handle an asynchronous broadcast channel.\n  In our paper, we propose an m-out-of-n rational secret sharing scheme which\ncan function over an asynchronous broadcast channel without the use of\ncryptographic primitives and with a non-interactive dealer.

A key component of the data processing for Gaia is\nthe astrometric core solution, which must implement an efficient and accurate\nnumerical algorithm to solve the resulting, extremely large least-squares\nproblem. The Astrometric Global Iterative Solution (AGIS) is a framework that\nallows to implement a range of different iterative solution schemes suitable\nfor a scanning astrometric satellite. In order to find a computationally\nefficient and numerically accurate iteration scheme for the astrometric\nsolution, compatible with the AGIS framework, we study an adaptation of the\nclassical conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm, and compare it to the so-called\nsimple iteration (SI) scheme that was previously known to converge for this\nproblem, although very slowly. The different schemes are implemented within a\nsoftware test bed for AGIS known as AGISLab, which allows to define, simulate\nand study scaled astrometric core solutions. After successful testing in\nAGISLab, the CG scheme has been implemented also in AGIS. The two algorithms CG\nand SI eventually converge to identical solutions, to within the numerical\nnoise (of the order of 0.00001 micro-arcsec). These solutions are independent\nof the starting values (initial star catalogue), and we conclude that they are\nequivalent to a rigorous least-squares estimation of the astrometric\nparameters.

We present\ntwo specific applications: First, we consider a multi-hop amplify-and-forward\n(AF) MIMO relay channel with noise at each stage and derive deterministic\napproximations of the mutual information after the Kth hop. Second, we study a\nMIMO multiple access channel (MAC) where the channel between each transmitter\nand the receiver is represented by the double-scattering channel model. We\nprovide deterministic approximations of the mutual information, the\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and sum-rate with\nminimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) detection and derive the asymptotically\noptimal precoding matrices. In both scenarios, the approximations can be\ncomputed by simple and provably converging fixed-point algorithms and are shown\nto be almost surely tight in the limit when the number of antennas at each node\ngrows infinitely large. Simulations suggest that the approximations are\naccurate for realistic system dimensions.

Informally, there are $n$ players sitting\non the network nodes, which attempt to establish a reciprocal communication by\nactivating, incurring a certain cost, any of their incident links. The goal of\neach player is to have all the other nodes as close as possible in the\nresulting network, while buying as few links as possible. According to this\nintuition, any model of the game must then appropriately address a balance\nbetween these two conflicting objectives. Motivated by the fact that a player\nmight have a strong requirement about its centrality in the network, in this\npaper we introduce a new setting in which if a player maintains its (either\nmaximum or average) distance to the other nodes within a given associated\nbound, then its cost is simply equal to the number of activated edges,\notherwise its cost is unbounded. We study the problem of understanding the\nstructure of associated pure Nash equilibria of the resulting games, that we\ncall MaxBD and SumBD, respectively. For both games, we show that computing the\nbest response of a player is an NP-hard problem. Next, we show that when\ndistance bounds associated with players are non-uniform, then equilibria can be\narbitrarily bad. On the other hand, for MaxBD, we show that when nodes have a\nuniform bound $R$ on the maximum distance, then the Price of Anarchy (PoA) is\nlower and upper bounded by 2 and $O(n^{\\frac{1}{\\lfloor\\log_3 R\\rfloor+1}})$\nfor $R \\geq 3$, while for the interesting case R=2, we are able to prove that\nthe PoA is $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ and $O(\\sqrt{n \\log n})$.

In\n1978, an analysis of communication in asynchronous systems was suggested by\nLeslie Lamport. Lamport's analysis determines a notion of temporal precedence,\na sort of weak notion of time, which is otherwise missing in asynchronous\nsystems. This notion has been extensively utilized in various applications.\n  Yet the analysis is limited to systems that are asynchronous. In this thesis\nwe go beyond by investigating causality in synchronous systems. In such\nsystems, the boundaries of causal influence are not charted out exclusively by\nmessage passing. Here time itself, passing at a uniform (or almost uniform)\nrate for all processes, is also a medium by which causal influence may fan out.\nThis thesis studies, and characterizes, the combinations of time and message\npassing that govern causal influence in synchronous systems.\n  It turns out that knowledge based analysis [FHMV] provides a well tailored\nformal framework within which causal notions can be studied. As we show, the\nformal notion of knowledge is highly appropriate for characterizing causal\ninfluence in terms of information flow, broadening the analysis of Chandy and\nMisra in [ChM].\n  We define several generic classes of coordination problems that pose various\ntemporal ordering requirements on the participating processes. These\ncoordination problems provide natural generalizations of real life\nrequirements. We then analyze the causal conditions that underlie suitable\nsolutions to these problems.

Compared to\ngeneral (non-mutual) insurance models, which involve one-sided impulse control\n(i.e., either downside or upside impulse) of the underlying insurance reserve\nprocess that is required to be positive, a mutual insurance differs in allowing\ntwo-sided impulse control (i.e., both downside and upside impulse), coupled\nwith the classical proportional control of reinsurance. We prove that a special\nband-type impulse control $(a,A,B,b)$ with $a=0$ and $a<A<B<b$, coupled with a\nproportional reinsurance policy (classical control), is optimal when the\nobjective is to minimize the total maintenance cost. That is, when the reserve\nposition reaches a lower boundary of $a=0$, the reserve should immediately be\nraised to level $A$; when the reserve reaches an upper boundary of $b$, it\nshould immediately be reduced to a level $B$. An interesting finding produced\nby the study reported in this paper is that there exists a situation such that\nif the upside fixed cost is relatively large in comparison to a finite\nthreshold, then the optimal band control is reduced to a downside only (i.e.,\ndividend payment only) control in the form of $(0,0;B,b)$ with $a=A=0$. In this\ncase, it is optimal for the mutual insurance firm to go bankrupt as soon as its\nreserve level reaches zero, rather than to jump restart by calling for\nadditional contingent funds.
