Intensity reductions in the\nlightcurve produce a branch in colour -colour diagrams similar to that of real\nflares in the Sco X-1 like group, and the nature of this branch was not clear.\nHowever, based on observations of Cygnus X-2 in which this dipping/flaring\noccurred it was proposed that the mass accretion rate in Z-track sources in\ngeneral increases monotonically along the Z-track towards the Flaring Branch, a\nstandard assumption widely held. It was also suggested that the Cygnus X-2\ngroup have high inclination. Based on recent multi-wavelength observations of\nCygnus X-2 we resolve these issues, showing by spectral analysis that the\nDipping Branch consists of absorption events in the outer disk, unrelated to\nthe occasional real flaring in the source. Thus motivation for Mdot increasing\nalong the Z from Horizontal - Normal to Flaring Branch is removed, as is the\nidea that high inclination distinguishes the Cygnus X-2 group. Finally, the\nobservations provide further evidence for the extended nature of the Accretion\nDisk Corona (ADC), and the correct modelling of the ADC Comptonized emission is\ncrucial to the interpretation of low mass X-ray binary data.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 15 figures; review paper presented at the Frascati Workshop\n  2011 \"Multifrequency behaviour of high energy cosmic sources\"; Mem.

The\ndefinition is motivated by a vision of players in game $\\G$ communicating via\nquantum technology according to a certain standard protocol originally\nintroduced by Eisert and Wilkins [EW].\n  In the game $\\G^Q$, each players' strategy set consists of the set of all\nprobability distributions on the 3-sphere $S^3$. Nash equilibria in this game\ncan be difficult to compute.\n  Our main theorems classify all possible equilibria in $\\G^Q$ for a\nZariski-dense set of games $\\G$ that we call {\\it generic games}. First, we\nshow that up to a suitable definition of equivalence, any strategy that arises\nin equilibrium is supported on at most four points; then we show that those\nfour points must lie in one of a small number of geometric configurations. One\neasy consequence is that for zero-sum games, the payoff to either player in a\nmixed strategy quantum equilibrium must equal the average of that player's four\npossible payoffs.\n"]}]

There is a significant gap between known upper and lower bounds for\nDkS: the current best algorithm gives an ~ O(n^{1/4}) approximation, while even\nshowing a small constant factor hardness requires significantly stronger\nassumptions than P != NP. In addition to interest in designing better\nalgorithms, a number of recent results have exploited the conjectured hardness\nof densest k-subgraph and its variants. Thus, understanding the approximability\nof DkS is an important challenge.\n  In this work, we give evidence for the hardness of approximating DkS within\npolynomial factors. Specifically, we expose the limitations of strong\nsemidefinite programs from SDP hierarchies in solving densest k-subgraph. Our\nresults include:\n  * A lower bound of Omega(n^{1/4}/log^3 n) on the integrality gap for\nOmega(log n/log log n) rounds of the Sherali-Adams relaxation for DkS. This\nalso holds for the relaxation obtained from Sherali-Adams with an added SDP\nconstraint.

Our construction proceeds via a\nreduction from random instances of a certain Max-CSP over large domains.\n  In the absence of inapproximability results for DkS, our results show that\neven the most powerful SDPs are unable to beat a factor of n^{Omega(1)}, and in\nfact even improving the best known n^{1/4} factor is a barrier for current\ntechniques.\n","Comment: 26 ages, 1 figure.

It is an axiom of quantum mechanics that H be Hermitian because\nHermiticity guarantees that the energy spectrum is real and that the time\nevolution is unitary (probability preserving). This paper investigates an\nalternative way to construct quantum theories in which the conventional\nrequirement of Hermiticity (combined transpose and complex conjugate) is\nreplaced by the more physically transparent condition of space-time reflection\n(PT) symmetry. It is shown that if the PT symmetry of a Hamiltonian H is not\nbroken, then the spectrum of H is real. Examples of PT-symmetric non-Hermitian\nquantum-mechanical Hamiltonians are H=p^2+ix^3 and H=p^2-x^4. The crucial\nquestion is whether PT-symmetric Hamiltonians specify physically acceptable\nquantum theories in which the norms of states are positive and the time\nevolution is unitary. The answer is that a Hamiltonian that has an unbroken PT\nsymmetry also possesses a physical symmetry represented by a linear operator\ncalled C. Using C it is shown how to construct an inner product whose\nassociated norm is positive definite. The result is a new class of fully\nconsistent complex quantum theories. Observables are defined, probabilities are\npositive, and the dynamics is governed by unitary time evolution.
