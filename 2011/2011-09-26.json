While the average values of the coalescence time of the\ndrops can be justified by the mechanism of film thinning, the scattering of the\nexperimental data of large drops cannot be rationalized using the methodology\npreviously described.

The\nresults are in agreement with scaling. The scaling function is shown to be\nuniversal. The direction-dependent long-range correlations may change from\nferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic behaviour and back as the dimension is\nvaried. The form of the scaling function is compared to predictions following\nfrom local scale invariance for strongly anisotropic critical systems.\n","Comment: Latex 23 pages, (2 figures not included) -- a Latex bug was fixed for\n  v2"]}]

In the case of mass determination of short-lived\nnuclides with a Penning trap, major causes of instabilities are temperature\nfluctuations in the vicinity of the trap and pressure fluctuations in the\nliquid helium cryostat of the superconducting magnet. Thus systems for the\ntemperature and pressure stabilization of the Penning trap mass spectrometer\nISOLTRAP at the ISOLDE facility at CERN have been installed. A reduction of the\nfluctuations by at least one order of magnitude downto dT=+/-5mK and\ndp=+/-50mtorr has been achieved, which corresponds to a relative frequency\nchange of 2.7x10^{-9} and 1.5x10^{-10}, respectively. With this stabilization\nthe frequency determination with the Penning trap only shows a linear temporal\ndrift over several hours on the 10 ppb level due to the finite resistance of\nthe superconducting magnet coils.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 13 figures"]}]
