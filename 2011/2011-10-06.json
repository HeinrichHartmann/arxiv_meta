The physics of vacua in which these\nsymmetries are spontaneously broken precisely matches a dual gravity analysis\ninvolving resolutions of the singularity, where we are able to match\ncondensates, Goldstone bosons and global strings. We then study the\nimplications of turning on a torsion 4-form flux. This flux non-trivially\naffects the supergravity dual of Higgsing, and we show that the supergravity\nand field theory analyses precisely match in an example based on Y^12(CP^2). We\nthen explain how the choice of M-theory circle can result in exotic\nrenormalization group flows. We also argue that theories where the resolutions\nhave 6-cycles are expected to receive non-perturbative corrections from M5\ninstantons. We give a general formula relating the instanton action to\nnormalizable harmonic 2-forms.\n  In the second part of this thesis we study the breaking of baryonic\nsymmetries in the AdS_5/CFT_4 correspondence. This leads, for particular vacuum\nexpectation values, to the emergence of baryonic symmetries during the\nrenormalization group flow. We identify these vacuum expectation values with\ncritical values of the B-field moduli in the dual supergravity backgrounds. We\nstudy in detail the C^3/Z_3 orbifold theory and the dual supergravity\nbackgrounds that correspond to the breaking of the emerging baryonic\nsymmetries, and identify the expected Goldstone bosons and global strings in\nthe IR.\n","Comment: PhD thesis, University of Oxford, September 2011"]}]

This will affect the subsequent evolution\nof the galaxy, by reducing or eliminating star formation, and quenching the\naccretion of matter onto the central AGN. Galactic outflows is the main process\nby which energy and processed interstellar matter is transported into the IGM.\nThis affects the subsequent formation of other galaxies. The energy carried by\noutflows can strip protogalactic halos of their gas, preventing galaxies from\nforming. Conversely, the metals carried by outflows can modify the composition\nand cooling rates of the gas in protogalactic halos, favoring the formation of\ngalaxies.

For example, \\maxcut\nis a boolean CSP where the input is a graph $G = (V,E)$ and the goal is to find\na cut $S \\cup \\bar S = V$ that maximizes the numberof crossing edges,\n$|E(S,\\bar S)|$. The \\maxbisection problem is a variant of \\maxcut with an\nadditional global constraint that each side of the cut has exactly half the\nvertices, i.e., $|S| = |V|/2$. Several other natural optimization problems like\n\\minbisection and approximating Graph Expansion can be formulated as CSPs with\nglobal constraints.\n  In this work, we formulate a general approach towards approximating CSPs with\nglobal constraints using SDP hierarchies. To demonstrate the approach we\npresent the following results:\n  Using the Lasserre hierarchy, we present an algorithm that runs in time\n$O(n^{poly(1/\\epsilon)})$ that given an instance of \\maxbisection with value\n$1-\\epsilon$, finds a bisection with value $1-O(\\sqrt{\\epsilon})$. This\napproximation is near-optimal (up to constant factors in $O()$) under the\nUnique Games Conjecture.\n  By a computer-assisted proof, we show that the same algorithm also achieves a\n0.85-approximation for \\maxbisection, improving on the previous bound of 0.70\n(note that it is \\uniquegames hard to approximate better than a 0.878 factor).\nThe same algorithm also yields a 0.92-approximation for \\maxtwosat with\ncardinality constraints.\n  For every CSP with a global cardinality constraints, we present a generic\nconversion from integrality gap instances for the Lasserre hierarchy to a {\\it\ndictatorship test} whose soundness is at most integrality gap. Dictatorship\ntesting gadgets are central to hardness results for CSPs, and a generic\nconversion of the above nature lies at the core of the tight Unique Games based\nhardness result for CSPs. \\cite{Raghavendra08}\n"]}]
