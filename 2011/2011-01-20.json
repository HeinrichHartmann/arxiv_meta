Recent Swift observations suggest that these GRBs may\nbe related to catastrophic explosions in degenerate compact stars, denoted as\n\"Type I\" GRBs. The most popular models include the merger of two compact\nstellar objects (NS-NS or NS-BH). We utilize a Monte Carlo approach to\ndetermine whether a merger progenitor model can self-consistently account for\nall the observations of short-hard GRBs, including a sample with redshift\nmeasurements in the Swift era (z-known sample) and the CGRO/BATSE sample. We\napply various merger time delay distributions invoked in compact star merger\nmodels to derive the redshift distributions of these Type I GRBs, and then\nconstrain the unknown luminosity function of Type I GRBs using the observed\nluminosity-redshift (L - z) distributions of the z-known sample. The best\nluminosity function model, together with the adopted merger delay model, are\nthen applied to confront the peak flux distribution (log N - log P\ndistribution) of the BATSE and Swift samples. We find that for all the merger\nmodels invoking a range of merger delay time scales (including those invoking a\nlarge fraction of \"prompt mergers\"), it is difficult to reconcile the models\nwith all the data. The data are instead statistically consistent with the\nfollowing two possible scenarios. First, that short/hard GRBs are a\nsuperposition of compact-star-merger origin (Type I) GRBs and a population of\nGRBs that track the star formation history, which are probably related to the\ndeaths of massive stars (Type II GRBs). Sec- ond, the entire short/hard GRB\npopulation is consistent with a typical delay of 2 Gyr with respect to the star\nformation history with modest scatter.

We focus our attention on the\nbehaviour of the Carter constant (Q) for near-polar orbits; and develop an\nanalysis that is independent of and complements radiation reaction models. For\na Schwarzschild black hole, the polar orbits represent the abutment between the\nprograde and retrograde orbits at which Q is at its maximum value for given\nvalues of latus rectum (l) and eccentricity (e). The introduction of spin (S =\n|J|/M2) to the massive black hole causes this boundary, or abutment, to be\nmoved towards greater orbital inclination; thus it no longer cleanly separates\nprograde and retrograde orbits. To characterise the abutment of a Kerr black\nhole (KBH), we first investigated the last stable orbit (LSO) of a\ntest-particle about a KBH, and then extended this work to general orbits. To\ndevelop a better understanding of the evolution of Q we developed analytical\nformulae for Q in terms of l, e, and S to describe elliptical orbits at the\nabutment, polar orbits, and last stable orbits (LSO). By knowing the analytical\nform of dQ/dl at the abutment, we were able to test a 2PN flux equation for Q.\nWe also used these formulae to numerically calculate the di/dl of hypothetical\ncircular orbits that evolve along the abutment.

Assuming that the\nmost important reaction mechanism is the sudden direct removal of a pair of\nnucleons from a set of relatively simple, active shell-model orbital\nconfigurations, such distributions were predicted to depend strongly on the\ntotal angular momentum I carried by the two nucleons - the final state spin for\nspin 0+ projectiles. The sensitivity of these now-accessible observables to\nspecific details of the (correlated) two-nucleon wave functions is of\nimportance. We clarify that it is the total orbital angular momentum L of the\ntwo nucleons that is the primary factor in determining the shapes and widths of\nthe calculated momentum distributions. It follows that, with accurate\nmeasurements, this dependence upon the L make-up of the two-nucleon wave\nfunctions could be used to assess the accuracy of (shell- or many-body) model\npredictions of these two-nucleon configurations.

This expression is based on the physics of the scale-invariant\nfragmentation of brittle materials, which is shown to be applicable to dust\nemission. Because clay aerosols produce a strong radiative cooling, the\noverestimation of the clay fraction causes GCMs to also overestimate the\nradiative cooling of a given quantity of emitted dust. On local and regional\nscales, this affects the magnitude and possibly the sign of the dust radiative\nforcing, with implications for numerical weather forecasting and regional\nclimate predictions in dusty regions. On a global scale, the dust cycle in most\nGCMs is tuned to match radiative measurements, such that the overestimation of\nthe radiative cooling of a given quantity of emitted dust has likely caused\nGCMs to underestimate the global dust emission rate.

Formation control is\nconcerned with problems in which agents are required to stabilize at a given\ndistance from other agents. In this context, the graph of a formation encodes\nboth the information flow and the distance constraints, by fixing the lengths\nof the edges. A formation is said to be rigid if it cannot be continuously\ndeformed with the distance constraints satisfied; a formation is minimally\nrigid if no distance constraint can be omitted without the formation losing its\nrigidity. Hence, the graph underlying minimally rigid formation provides just\nenough constraints to yield a rigid formation. An open question we will settle\nis whether the information flow afforded by a minimally rigid graph is\nsufficient to insure global stability.

The\nclassical result in this field, such as Banach -- Caccioppoli principle\ntogether with some its modification and generalisations, is applicable to\noperators satisfying Lipschitz condition with a small coefficient or, in other\nwords, to operators with the compression property. However, the successive\napproximations method works well for other classes of operators that are not\ncompressions. In particular, the well known Kantorovich fixed point principle\nfor differentiable operators deals with operators that, in general, are not\ncompression; moreover, this principle covers some cases when Banach --\nCaccioppoli principle is nonapplicable. In the article it is presented some\nmodification of Kantorovich fixed point principle that covers nondifferentiable\noperators. We describe the exact (unimprovable) estimates of the internal and\nexternal radius of the domain of existence of a unique fixed point of the\noperator under consideration and, in addition, we present new apriori and\naposteriori error estimates for successive approximations to the corresponding\nfixed point. Some applications of the new fixed point principle to nonlinear\nintegral operators of different types are given as well.\n","Comment: 17 pages"]}]

We relate the leading terms of the expansions\nto the structure of the cut locus, especially to conjugacy, and we provide a\nprobabilistic interpretation in terms of the Brownian bridge. In particular, we\nshow that the cut locus is the set of points where the Hessian blows up faster\nthan 1/t.

Theoretical analyses of nucleon coincidence\ndata have been performed in a finite nucleus framework. They led to the\nextraction of G_n/G_p values in agreement with pure theoretical estimates, thus\nproviding an evidence for the solution of a longstanding puzzle. Here we\npresent an alternative approach to the problem, based on a nuclear matter\nformalism extended to finite nuclei via the local density approximation. The\nwork is motivated by the exigence to make the determination of G_n/G_p from\ndata less model dependent. One-meson-exchange potentials are used for\ndescribing both the one- and two-nucleon induced decays, Lambda N -> n N and\nLambda N N -> n N N. For the latter, treated within a microscopic approach, the\nchannels Lambda n n -> n n n and Lambda p p -> n p p are included in addition\nto the mode Lambda n p -> n n p already considered, in a phenomenological way,\nin previous studies. The propagation of the final nucleons in the residual\nnucleus is simulated by an intranuclear cascade code. We evaluate single and\ndouble coincidence nucleon spectra for the non-mesonic decay of C-12-Lambda.\nThrough the comparison of our predictions with KEK coincidence data we\ndetermine G_n/G_p=0.43 \\pm 0.10 for this hypernucleus, confirming previous\nfinite nucleus analyses.\n","Comment: 34 pages, 17 figures"]}]
