However, accretion tori produced in various astrophysical situations\n(e.g., collapsars and neutron star binary mergers) are likely to be highly\nmagnetized. We study the effect of magnetic fields on the PP instability in\nincompressible tori with various magnetic strengths and structures. In general,\ntoroidal magnetic fields have significant effects on the PP instability: For\nthin tori (with the fractional width relative to the outer torus radius much\nless than unity), the instability is suppressed at large field strengths with\nthe corresponding toroidal Alfven speed $v_{A\\phi}\\go 0.2r\\Omega$ (where\n$\\Omega$ is the flow rotation rate). For thicker tori (with the fractional\nwidth of order 0.4 or larger), which are hydrodynamically stable, the\ninstability sets in for sufficiently strong magnetic fields (with $v_{A\\phi}\\go\n0.2 r\\Omega$). Our results suggest that highly magnetized accretion tori may be\nsubjected to global instability even when it is stable against the usual\nmagneto-rotational instability.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 10 figures, MNRAS accepted"]}]

We explore the\ntemporal and spatial dynamics of histone acetylation data and its correlation\nwith gene expression using supervised and unsupervised statistical models. On a\ngenome-wide scale, changes in acetylation are significantly correlated to\nchanges in mRNA expression and, surprisingly, this coherence increases over\ntime.

We\ninvestigate the patterns and timescales of temporal line profile variability in\norder to explore the dynamical circumstellar environment of the PMS Herbig Ae\nstar V351 Ori. Methods.We obtained 45 high-resolution (R~28,000) spectra of\nV351 Ori at timescales of hours, days, and months.We analysed the H\\alpha line\nprofiles and also examined the H\\beta, NaD1 and NaD2 line profiles to explore\nthe nature of the spectroscopic variability. Results. The H\\alpha line profiles\nshowed strong variations over all timescales. The shape of the profiles changed\nover timescales of a day. Single as well as simultaneous event(s) of\nblue-shifted and red-shifted transient absorption components (TACs), i.e.\nsignatures of outflow and infall, were also observed in the H\\alpha line\nprofiles. The shortest period of variation in the TACs was < 1 hour. All\ntransient absorption events were found to decelerate with a rate of a few to\nfractions of m s-2. The depth and width of the TACs were also changing with\ntime. The presence of elongated red-shifted components at some epochs supports\nthe episodic nature of accretion. Conclusions. Variable emission and absorption\ncomponents detected in H\\alpha line profiles show the dynamic nature of\ninteraction between V351 Ori and its circumstellar environment. The H\\alpha\nnon-photospheric profiles of the star most probably originate in the disk wind.\nEpisodic accretion of gaseous material at a slow rate and outflow of clumpy\ngaseous material are still occurring in V351 Ori at an age of ~6.5 Myr.

It was found that: (1)\nthe dual-task coordination is available in children and adolescents with ADHD\nin general and in its subtypes and not significantly different from performance\nof age and years of education matched healthy controls; (2) Increase of the\ntask difficulty in dual-task paradigm don't affect disproportionately children\nand adolescents with ADHD in comparison to age and years of education matched\nhealthy controls; (3) The paper and pencil version of the dual-task method is\ngiving the same results in ADHD and healthy controls as computerised version;\n(4) The dual-task functioning in ADHD in general and in its subtypes is not\ndefined by the general motor functioning while in healthy controls dual task\nperformance is associated with the general motor functioning level; (5) The\ndual-task functioning in ADHD in general and in its subtypes is not defined by\nthe comorbidity factors.\n","Comment: 31 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables"]}]

Our approach is based on the orthodox theory for a\ndouble-dot case and is capable of simulating I-V characteristics of systems\nwith any resistance and capacitance values and for temperatures corresponding\nto thermal energies larger than the dot level spacing. We compare I-V\ncharacteristics of single-dot and double-dot systems and show that for a given\nmeasured I-V curve considering the possibility of a second dot is equivalent to\ndecreasing the fit temperature.
