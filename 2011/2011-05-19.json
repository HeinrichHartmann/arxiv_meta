The multi-frequency angular power spectrum C_l(Delta\nnu) is used to characterize the statistical properties of the background\nradiation across angular scales ~20\" to 10', and a frequency bandwidth of 7.5\nMHz with resolution 125 kHz. The measured C_l(Delta nu) which ranges from 7\nmK^2 to 18 mK^2 is dominated by foregrounds, the expected HI signal\nC_l^HI(Delta nu) ~10^{-6}- 10^{-7} mK^2 is several orders of magnitude smaller.\nThe foregrounds, believed to originate from continuum sources, is expected to\nvary smoothly with Delta nu whereas the HI signal decorrelates within ~0.5 MHz\nand this holds the promise of separating the two. For each l, we use the\ninterval 0.5 < Delta nu < 7.5 MHz to fit a fourth order polynomial which is\nsubtracted from the measured C_l(Delta nu) to remove any smoothly varying\ncomponent across the entire bandwidth Delta nu < 7.5 MHz. The residual\nC_l(Delta nu), we find, has an oscillatory pattern with amplitude and period\nrespectively ~0.1 mK^2 and Delta nu = 3 MHz at the smallest l value of 1476,\nand the amplitude and period decreasing with increasing l. Applying a suitably\nchosen high pass filter, we are able to remove the residual oscillatory pattern\nfor l=1476 where the residual C_l(Delta nu) is now consistent with zero at the\n3-sigma noise level.

Such\ntechniques have proven quite fragile in time-varying channels because the CSIT\nis inherently imperfect due to estimation and feedback delay, as well\nquantization noise. An alternative approach recently proposed by Maddah-Ali and\nTse (MAT) allows for significant multiplexing gain in the multi-input\nsingle-output (MISO) broadcast channel (BC) even with transmit CSIT that is\ncompletely stale, i.e. uncorrelated with the current channel state. With $K$\nusers, their scheme claims to lose only a $\\log(K)$ factor relative to the full\n$K$ degrees of freedom (DoF) attainable in the MISO BC with perfect CSIT for\nlarge $K$. However, their result does not consider the cost of the feedback,\nwhich is potentially very large in high mobility (short channel coherence\ntime). In this paper, we more closely examine the MAT scheme and compare its\nDoF gain to single user transmission (which always achieves 1 DoF) and partial\nCSIT linear precoding (which achieves up to $K$). In particular, assuming the\nchannel coherence time is $N$ symbol periods and the feedback delay is $N_{\\rm\nfd}$ we show that when $N < (1+o(1)) K \\log K$ (short coherence time), single\nuser transmission performs best, whereas for $N> (1+o(1)) (N_{\\rm fd}+ K / \\log\nK)(1-\\log^{-1}K)^{-1}$ (long coherence time), zero-forcing precoding\noutperforms the other two.

We give a solution to the\nlatter question using elementary techniques which rely purely on the\ndescription of F as the group of piecewise linear orientation-preserving\nhomeomorphisms of the unit interval. The techniques we develop extend the ones\nused by Brin and Squier allowing us to compute roots and centralizers as well.\nMoreover, these techniques can be generalized to solve the same question in\nlarger groups of piecewise-linear homeomorphisms.\n","Comment: 33 pages, 7 figures; final version; to appear in \"Groups, Geometry\n  and Dynamics\""]}]

What is called a\n\"Telescope-Interferometer\" (T-I) is indeed a novel, recently proposed Wavefront\nError (WFE) sensing technique, whose basic idea consists in combining the main\npupil of a telescope with a second, off-axis reference arm. Then a weak\nmodulation of the Point Spread Function (PSF) is generated at the focal plane,\nallowing for direct phase measurements. We propose a notable improvement of the\nmethod, inspired from classical principles of phase shifting interferometry.\nHerein are presented the alternative principle and its achievable measurement\naccuracy. The technique shows high performance excepted on narrow areas located\nnear the pupil boundary. It is applicable to both ground or space telescopes\nand is suitable for the co-phasing of segmented mirrors, which is of prime\nimportance in view of future giant telescope projects.\n","Comment: 17 pages and 5 figures"]}]
