By using the thin-shell approximation (which means\nthat the Israel-Darmois continuity conditions are not fulfilled between the\nshells) we construct a model of evolving cosmic structures, containing several\nelongated supercluster-like structures with underdense regions between them,\nwhich altogether provides a reasonable coarse-grained description of cosmic\nstructures. While this configuration is not spherically symmetric, its proper\nvolume average yields a spherical void profile of 250 Mpc that roughly agrees\nwith observations.

We concentrate on structures in atoms due to interference of\ndifferent angular momentum channels during recombination. We use the Cooper\nminimum (CM) in argon at 47 eV as a marker in the harmonic spectrum. We measure\n2d harmonic spectra in argon as a function of wavelength and angular\ndivergence. While we identify a clear CM in the spectrum when the target gas\njet is placed after the laser focus, we find that the appearance of the CM\nvaries with angular divergence and can even be completely washed out when the\ngas jet is placed closer to the focus. We also show that the argon CM appears\nat different wavelengths in harmonic and photo-absorption spectra measured\nunder conditions independent of any wavelength calibration. We model the\nexperiment with a simulation based on coupled solutions of the time-dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation and the Maxwell wave equation, including both the single\natom response and macroscopic effects of propagation. The single atom\ncalculations confirm that the ground state of argon can be represented by its\nfield free $p$ symmetry, despite the strong laser field used in high harmonic\ngeneration. Because of this, the CM structure in the harmonic spectrum can be\ndescribed as the interference of continuum $s$ and $d$ channels, whose relative\nphase jumps by $\\pi$ at the CM energy, resulting in a minimum shifted from the\nphotoionization result. We also show that the full calculations reproduce the\ndependence of the CM on the macroscopic conditions. We calculate simple phase\nmatching factors as a function of harmonic order and explain our experimental\nand theoretical observation in terms of the effect of phase matching on the\nshape of the harmonic spectrum. Phase matching must be taken into account to\nfully understand spectral features related to HHG spectroscopy.\n"]}]

Clues from a LCDM cosmology"],"description":["  We present a new proxy for the overdensity peak height for which the\nlarge-scale clustering of haloes of a given mass does not vary significantly\nwith the assembly history. The peak height, usually taken to be well\nrepresented by the virial mass, can instead be approximated by the mass inside\nspheres of different radii, which in some cases can be larger than the virial\nradius and therefore include mass outside the individual host halo. The sphere\nradii are defined as r = $a$ delta_t + $b$ log_10(M_vir/M_nl), where delta_t is\nthe age relative to the typical age of galaxies hosted by haloes with virial\nmass M_vir, M_nl is the non-linear mass, and $a$=0.2 and $b$=-0.02 are the free\nparameters adjusted to trace the assembly bias effect. Note that $r$ depends on\nboth halo mass and age. In this new approach, some of the objects which were\ninitially considered low-mass peaks belong to regions with higher\noverdensities. At large scales, i.e. in the two-halo regime, this model\nproperly recovers the simple prescription where the bias responds to the height\nof the mass peak alone, in contrast to the usual definition (virial mass) that\nshows a strong dependence on additional halo properties such as formation time.\nThe dependence on the age in the one-halo term is also remarkably reduced. The\npopulation of galaxies whose \"peak height\" changes with this new definition\nconsists mainly of old stellar populations and are preferentially hosted by\nlow-mass haloes located near more massive objects. The latter is in agreement\nwith recent results which indicate that old, low-mass haloes would suffer\ntruncation of mass accretion by nearby larger haloes or simply due to the high\ndensity of their surroundings, thus showing an assembly bias effect. The change\nin mass is small enough that the Sheth et al.

Furthermore, the language is designed to be\nextensible in a simple and modular way. Another important aspect of Ciao is its\nprogramming environment, which provides a powerful preprocessor (with an\nassociated assertion language) capable of statically finding non-trivial bugs,\nverifying that programs comply with specifications, and performing many types\nof optimizations (including automatic parallelization). Such optimizations\nproduce code that is highly competitive with other dynamic languages or, with\nthe (experimental) optimizing compiler, even that of static languages, all\nwhile retaining the flexibility and interactive development of a dynamic\nlanguage. This compilation architecture supports modularity and separate\ncompilation throughout. The environment also includes a powerful\nauto-documenter and a unit testing framework, both closely integrated with the\nassertion system.

Super-resolution\nis the process of combining multiple aliased low-quality images to produce a\nhigh resolution, high-quality image.

The low resolution images are\ncompressed using 8 by 8 blocks DCT and noise is filtered using our proposed\nnovel zonal filter. Multiframe fusion is performed in order to obtain a single\nnoise free image. At the decoder the image is reconstructed progressively by\ntransmitting the coarser image first followed by the detail image. And finally\na super resolution image is reconstructed by applying our proposed novel\nadaptive interpolation technique.

The polarization well in the model is deep enough for only one\nlocalized level. In dielectric materials with a sufficiently large dielectric\nconstant, two charged identical particles can be localized in one polarization\npotential well, forming a bipolaron. Although several localized levels can be\nfound in more realistic self-consistent models of this type, the more realistic\ntheories require a high level of knowledge of mathematics.

When a Dirac-Wilson line forms a Dirac-Wilson\nloop, it is a photon. This loop model of photon is exactly solvable. From the\nwinding numbers of this loop-form of photon, we derive the quantization\nproperties of energy and electric charge. A new QED theory is presented that is\nfree of ultraviolet divergences. The Dirac-Wilson line is as the quantum photon\npropagator of the new QED theory from which we can derive known QED effects\nsuch as the anomalous magnetic moment and the Lamb shift. The one-loop\ncomputation of these effects is simpler and is more accurate than that in the\nconventional QED theory. Furthermore, from the new QED theory, we have derived\na new QED effect. A new formulation of the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation solves\nthe difficulties of the BS equation and gives a modified ground state of the\npositronium. By the mentioned new QED effect and by the new formulation of the\nBS equation, a term in the orthopositronium decay rate that is missing in the\nconventional QED is found, resolving the orthopositronium lifetime puzzle\ncompletely. It is also shown that the graviton can be constructed from the\nphoton, yielding a theory of quantum gravity that unifies gravitation and\nelectromagnetism.\n","Comment: 53 pages"]}]
