(2009) represents a new testbed to improve the current\nunderstanding of Semi-analytic Models of Galaxy formation. In particular, we\nhere show that a detailed hierarchical model of structure formation can broadly\nreproduce the correct peak in the size distribution of local early-type\ngalaxies, although it significantly overpredicts the number of very compact and\nvery large galaxies. This in turn is reflected in the predicted size-mass\nrelation, much flatter than the observed one, due to too large (~3 kpc)\nlow-mass galaxies (<10^11 \\msun), and to a non-negligible fraction of compact\n(< 0.5-1 kpc) and massive galaxies (> 10^11 \\msun). We also find that the\nlatter discrepancy is smaller than previously claimed, and limited to only\nultracompact (Re < 0.5 kpc) galaxies when considering elliptical-dominated\nsamples. We explore several causes behind these effects. We conclude that the\nformer problem might be linked to the initial conditions, given that large and\nlow-mass galaxies are present at all epochs in the model. The survival of\ncompact and massive galaxies might instead be linked to their very old ages and\npeculiar merger histories. Overall, knowledge of the galactic stellar mass {\\em\nand} size distributions allows a better understanding of where and how to\nimprove models.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 10 Figures.

Eventually, these\ndroplets detach, i.e. overcome the surface tension, because of their increasing\nmass. We show that this spontaneous dripping is deterministically chaotic by\nmeans of a positive largest Lyapunov exponent and a negative divergence. In the\npresence of the detachment pulse, however, the generation of droplets is\nfastened depending on the pulse power. At high powers, the spontaneity of\ndripping is completely overshadowed by the impact of the detachment pulse.\nStill, amplitude chaos can be detected, which similarly as the spontaneous\ndripping, is characterized by a positive largest Lyapunov exponent and a\nnegative divergence, thus indicating that the observed dynamics is\ndeterministically chaotic with an attractor as solution in the phase space. In\nthe intermediate regime, i.e. for low and medium detachment pulse powers, the\ntwo chaotic states compete for supremacy, yielding an intermittent\nperiod-doubling to amplitude chaos transition, which we characterize by means\nof recurrence plots and their properties. Altogether, the transition from\nspontaneous to triggered laser droplet generation is characterized by a\nchaos-to-chaos transition with an intermediate dynamically nonstationary phase\nin-between.

In this paper we\nstudy the assumptions made by this methodology using a semi-analytical model\n(SAM). To this end, we randomly swap between the locations of model galaxies\nwithin a narrow range of subhalo mass (M_infall). We find that shuffled samples\nof galaxies have different auto-correlation functions in comparison with the\noriginal model galaxies. This difference is significant even if central and\nsatellite galaxies are allowed to follow a different relation between M_infall\nand stellar mass, and can reach a factor of 2 for massive galaxies at redshift\nzero. We analyze three features within SAMs that contribute to this effect: a)\nThe relation between stellar mass and subhalo mass evolves with redshift for\ncentral galaxies, affecting satellite galaxies at the time of infall. b) The\nstellar mass of galaxies falling into groups and clusters at high redshift is\ndifferent from the mass of central galaxies at the same time. c) The stellar\nmass growth for satellite galaxies after infall can be significant and depends\non the infall redshift and the group mass. We show that the above is true for\ndiffering SAMs, and that the effect is sensitive to the treatment of dynamical\nfriction and stripping of gas in satellite galaxies. We find that by using the\nFoF group mass at redshift zero in addition to M_infall, an empirical model is\nable to accurately reproduce the clustering properties of galaxies. On the\nother hand, using the infall redshift as a second parameter does not yield as\ngood results because it is less correlated with stellar mass.

These neutron stars\nare thought to be created in supernova explosions involving massive stars,\nwhich give rise to expanding supernova remnants (SNRs). With over 220 Galactic\nSNRs known (Green 1998) and over 1200 radio pulsars detected (Camilo et al.\n2000), it is quite surprising that few associations between the two populations\nhave been identified with any certainty. Here we report the discovery of a\nremarkable 0.3 sec X-ray pulsar, PSR J1846-0258, associated with the supernova\nremnant Kes 75. With a characteristic age of only 723 yr, consistent with the\nage of Kes 75, PSR J1846-0258 is the youngest pulsar yet discovered and is\nbeing rapidly spun down by torques from a large magnetic dipole of strength ~\n5E13 G, just above the so-called quantum critical field. PSR J1846-0258 resides\nin this transitional regime where the magnetic field is hypothesized to\nseparate the regular pulsars from the so-called magnetars. PSR J1846-0258 is\nevidently a Crab-like pulsar, however, its period, spin-down rate, spin-down\nconversion efficiency, are each an order-of-magnitude greater, likely the\nresult of its extreme magnetic field.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures, LaTex, emulateapj.sty.

A simple way to model the diffusion of ideas,\ninnovative behavior, or ``word-of-mouth'' effects on such a graph is to\nconsider an increasing process of ``infected'' (or active) nodes: each node\nbecomes infected once an activation function of the set of its infected\nneighbors crosses a certain threshold value. Such a model was introduced by KKT\nin \\cite{KeKlTa:03,KeKlTa:05} where the authors also impose several natural\nassumptions: the threshold values are (uniformly) random; and the activation\nfunctions are monotone and submodular. For an initial set of active nodes $S$,\nlet $\\sigma(S)$ denote the expected number of active nodes at termination.
