Cold-flow streams and\ngas-rich mergers produce a circum-galactic component of cool gas that generally\norbits with high angular momentum about the galaxy halo before falling in to\nbuild the disk. This signature of cosmological accretion should be observable\nusing background-object absorption line studies as features that are offset\nfrom the galaxy's systemic velocity by ~100 km/s. Accreted gas typically\nco-rotates with the central disk in the form of a warped, extended cold flow\ndisk, such that the observed velocity offset is in the same direction as galaxy\nrotation, appearing in sight lines that avoid the galactic poles. This\nprediction provides a means to observationally distinguish accreted gas from\noutflow gas: the accreted gas will show large one-sided velocity offsets in\nabsorption line studies while radial/bi-conical outflows will not (except\npossibly in special polar projections). This rotation signature has already\nbeen seen in studies of intermediate redshift galaxy-absorber pairs; we suggest\nthat these observations may be among the first to provide indirect\nobservational evidence for cold accretion onto galactic halos.

The results show that the nature of adhesion between\ngraphene and its substrate is qualitatively dependent on the surface defect\ntype. In particular, the interaction between graphene and silicon-terminated\nSiO$_2$ originates exclusively from the vdW interaction, whereas the\noxygen-terminated surface provides additional ionic contribution to the binding\narising from interfacial charge transfer ($p$-type doping of graphene). Strong\ndoping contrast for the different surface terminations provides a mechanism for\nthe charge inhomogeneity of graphene on amorphous SiO$_2$ observed in\nexperiments. We found that independent of the considered surface morphologies,\nthe typical electronic structure of graphene in the vicinity of the Dirac point\nremains unaltered in contact with the SiO$_2$ substrate, which points to the\nabsence of the covalent interactions between graphene and amorphous silica. The\ncase of hydrogen-passivated SiO$_2$ surfaces is also examined.

Unlike conventional\ndensity functionals, these functionals are not invariant under unitary\ntransformations of occupied electronic states, which leave the total charge\ndensity intact, and this added complexity has greatly inhibited both their\ndevelopment and their practical applicability. Here, we first recast the\nminimization problem for non-unitary invariant energy functionals into the\nlanguage of ensemble density-functional theory, decoupling the variational\nsearch into an inner loop of unitary transformations that minimize the energy\nat fixed orbital subspace, and an outer-loop evolution of the orbitals in the\nspace orthogonal to the occupied manifold. Then, we show that the potential\nenergy surface in the inner loop is far from convex parabolic in the early\nstages of the minimization and hence minimization schemes based on these\nassumptions are unstable, and present an approach to overcome such difficulty.\nThe overall formulation allows for a stable, robust, and efficient variational\nminimization of non-unitary-invariant functionals, essential to study complex\nmaterials and molecules, and to investigate the bulk thermodynamic limit, where\norbitals converge typically to localized Wannier functions. In particular,\nusing maximally localized Wannier functions as an initial guess can greatly\nreduce the computational costs needed to reach the energy minimum while not\naffecting or improving the convergence efficiency.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 6 figures"]}]
