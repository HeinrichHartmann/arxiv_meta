As usual, our study is\nunder the supergravity approximation and the limit of large color number.\nAlthough the Sakai-Sugimoto model is non-conformal, which makes the\ncalculations more involved than the well-studied $\\mathcal {N}$=4 SYM case, the\nresult seems to indicate that the non-conformality has little essential effect\non the physical picture of the internal structure of holographic plasma, which\nis consistent with the intuition from the asymptotic freedom of QCD at high\nenergy. While the physical picture underlying our investigation is same as the\nDIS off the $\\mathcal {N}$=4 SYM plasma with(out) flavor, the plasma structure\nfunctions are quantitatively different, especially their scaling dependence on\nthe temperature, which can be recognized as model-dependent. As a comparison,\nwe also do the same analysis for the non-critical version of the Sakai-Sugimoto\nmodel which is conformal in the sense that it has a constant dilaton vacuum.\nThe result for this non-critical model is much similar to the conformal\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM plasma. We therefore attribute the above difference to the\neffect of non-conformality of the Sakai-Sugimoto model.\n","Comment: 22 pages, no figure, Version accepted by Physical Review D"]}]

This fractured\nconceptual framework often causes particular applications to be incomplete or\nimproperly analyzed. In this paper, I present a concise introduction to the two\nkey aspects of the theory. First, all measures of fitness ultimately arise from\nthe relative comparison of the reproductive success of individuals or genotypes\nwith the average reproductive success in the population. That relative measure\ncreates a diminishing relation between reproductive success and fitness.\nDiminishing returns reduce fitness in proportion to variability in reproductive\nsuccess. The relative measurement of success also induces a frequency\ndependence that favors rare types. Second, variability in populations has a\nhierarchical structure. Variable success in different traits of an individual\naffects that individual's variation in reproduction. Correlation between\ndifferent individuals' reproduction affects variation in the aggregate success\nof particular alleles across the population. One must consider the hierarchical\nstructure of variability in relation to different consequences of temporal,\nspatial, and developmental variability. Although a complete analysis of\nvariability has many separate parts, this simple framework allows one to see\nthe structure of the whole and to place particular problems in their proper\nrelation to the general theory. The biological understanding of relative\nsuccess and the hierarchical structure of variability in populations may also\ncontribute to a deeper economic theory of returns under uncertainty.\n"]}]

In this paper, I show how developmental\nvariability alters evolutionary dynamics by smoothing the landscape that\nrelates genotype to fitness. In a fitness landscape with multiple peaks and\nvalleys, developmental variability can smooth the landscape to provide a\ndirectly increasing path of fitness to the highest peak. Developmental\nvariability also allows initial survival of a genotype in response to novel or\nextreme environmental challenge, providing an opportunity for subsequent\nadaptation. This initial survival advantage arises from the way in which\ndevelopmental variability smooths and broadens the fitness landscape.\nUltimately, the synergism between developmental processes and genetic variation\nsets evolutionary rate.\n"]}]

At X-ray\nluminosities <4 10^{36} erg/s, a hot convective shell is formed around the\nneutron star magnetosphere, and subsonic settling accretion regime sets in. In\nthis regime, accretion rate onto neutron star is determined by the ability of\nplasma to enter magnetosphere via Rayleigh-Taylor instability. A gas-dynamic\ntheory of settling accretion is constructed taking into account anisotropic\nturbulence.

Echo-Enabled Harmonic Generation\n(EEHG) is a promising, recent technique for harmonic generation with an\nexcellent up-conversion to very high harmonics, from the standpoint of electron\nbeam physics. This paper explores the constraints on seed laser performance for\nreaching wavelengths of 1 nm. We show that the main challenge in implementing\nthe EEHG scheme at extreme harmonic factors is the requirement for accurate\ncontrol of temporal and spatial quality of the seed laser pulse. For example,\nif the phase of the laser pulse is chirped before conversion to an UV seed\npulse, the chirp in the electron beam microbunch turns out to be roughly\nmultiplied by the harmonic factor. In the case of a Ti:Sa seed laser, such\nfactor is about 800. For such large harmonic numbers, generation of nearly\ntransform-limited soft X-ray pulses results in challenging constraints on the\nTi:Sa laser. In fact, the relative discrepancy of the time-bandwidth product of\nthe seed-laser pulse from the ideal transform-limited performance should be no\nmore than one in a million. The generated electron beam microbunching is also\nvery sensitive to distortions of the seed laser wavefront, which are also\nmultiplied by the harmonic factor. In order to have minimal reduction of the\nFEL input coupling factor, it is desirable that the size-angular bandwidth\nproduct of the UV seed laser beam be very close to the ideal i.e.\ndiffraction-limited performance in the waist plane at the middle of the\nmodulator undulator.\n","Comment: 24 pages, no figures"]}]

In Long Term\nEvolution (LTE), MIMO technologies have been broadly used to get better\ndownlink peak rate, cell coverage, as well as average cell throughput. In the\npresent paper a 2x2 MIMO is taken as baseline configuration for a LTE downlink\nunder a Microcellular propagation scenario considering a non physical\ncorrelation based channel with Poor and rich scattering environment. The\nthroughput capacity of the downlink is obtained for poor and rich scattering\nenvironments. Besides, two vital aspects of MIMO technique viz Spatial\nMultiplexing (SM) and Transmit Diversity (TD) are investigated in order to see\ntheir effect on throughput of the system. The effect of parameters like Speed\nof mobile station, number of Multipath, Rician factor (K) on throughput of such\nsystems is reported and discussed. The investigations reported in this paper\nhelps in estimating the throughput capacity of LTE downlink under SM and TD\nmode.\n","Comment: 11"]}]

As LTE is a MIMO-OFDM based\nsystem, a cyclic prefix is inserted at the beginning of each transmitted OFDM\nsymbol in order to completely suppress both inter-carrier interference (ICI)\nand inter-symbol interference (ISI). Usually, the cyclic prefix is equal to or\nlonger than the channel length but in some cases and because of some unforeseen\nchannel behaviour, the cyclic prefix can be shorter. Therefore, we propose to\nstudy the performance of the two linear estimators under the effect of the\nchannel length. Computer simulations show that, in the case where the cyclic\nprefix is equal to or longer than the channel length,LMMSE performs better than\nLSE but at the cost of computational complexity.In the other case, LMMSE\ncontinue to improve its performance only for low SNR values but it degrades for\nhigh SNR values in which LS shows better performance for LTE Downlink systems.\nMATLAB Monte-Carlo simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the\nstudied estimators in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE) and Bit Error Rate (BER)\nfor 2x2 LTE Downlink systems.\n","Comment: 9 pages,8 figures"]}]
