It allows us to estimate the state of a quantum system by measuring\ndifferent observables on many identically prepared copies of the system. This\nis, in general, a very time-consuming task that requires a large number of\nmeasurements. There are, however, systems in which the data acquisition can be\ndone more efficiently. In fact, an ensemble of quantum systems can be prepared\nand manipulated by external fields while being continuously and collectively\nprobed, producing enough information to estimate its state. This provides a\nbasis for continuous measurement quantum tomography. In this protocol, an\nensemble of identically prepared systems is collectively probed and controlled\nin a time-dependent manner to create an informationally complete continuous\nmeasurement record. The measurement history is then inverted to determine the\nstate at the initial time. We use two different estimation methods: maximum\nlikelihood and compressed sensing. The general formalism is applied to the case\nof reconstruction of the quantum state encoded in the magnetic sub-levels of a\nlarge-spin alkali atom, ${}^{133}$Cs. We apply this protocol to the case of\nreconstruction of states in the full 16-dimensional electronic-ground subspace\n($F=3 \\oplus F=4$), controlled by microwaves and radio-frequency magnetic\nfields. We present an experimental demonstration of continuous measurement\nquantum tomography in an ensemble of cold cesium atoms with full control of its\n16-dimensional Hilbert space. We show the exquisite level of control achieved\nin the lab and the excellent agreement between the theory discussed in this\ndissertation and the experimental results. This allows us to achieve fidelities\n>95% for low complexity quantum states, and >92% for arbitrary random states,\nwhich is a formidable accomplishment for a space of this size.\n","Comment: Ph.D. Dissertation"]}]

In applications only a discrete set of values of Rf is given, thus,\none can only obtain an approximation of f. Another class of methods, called\nART, can be used to solve the reconstruction problem.

The first case is when the time\ndata is modeled as a sequence of independent and normal distributed random\nvariables with unknown, possibly changing, mean value but fixed variance. The\nmain assumption is that the mean value is piecewise constant in time, and the\ntask is to estimate the change times and the mean values within the segments.\nThe second case is when the mean value is constant, but the variance can\nchange. The assumption is that the variance is piecewise constant in time, and\nwe want to estimate change times and the variance values within the segments.\nTo find solutions to these problems, we will study an l_1 regularized maximum\nlikelihood method, related to the fused lasso method and l_1 trend filtering,\nwhere the parameters to be estimated are free to vary at each sample. To\npenalize variations in the estimated parameters, the l_1-norm of the time\ndifference of the parameters is used as a regularization term.
