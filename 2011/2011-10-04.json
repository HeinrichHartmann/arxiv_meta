A relation between the Holevo information\nand the entropy of an auxiliary matrix consisting of square root fidelities\nbetween the elements of the ensemble is proved in some special cases.

The difficulty of determining the correct value is\nevidenced by the fact that Singer's result has withstood the test of time. In\nthis paper we use a purely combinatorial argument to show that the rectilinear\ncrossing number of K_10 is 62. Moreover, using this result, we improve an\nasymptotic lower bound for a related problem. Finally, we close with some new\nand old open questions that were provoked, in part, by the results of this\npaper, and by the tangled history of the problem itself.\n","Comment: 17 Pages, colour figures"]}]

A rectilinear drawing of K_n is an arrangement of n\nvertices in the plane, every pair of which is connected by an edge that is a\nline segment. We assume that no three vertices are collinear, and that no three\nedges intersect in a point unless that point is an endpoint of all three. The\nrectilinear crossing number of K_n is the fewest number of edge crossings\nattainable over all rectilinear drawings of K_n.\n  For each n we construct a rectilinear drawing of K_n that has the fewest\nnumber of edge crossings and the best asymptotics known to date. Moreover, we\ngive some alternative infinite families of drawings of K_n with good\nasymptotics. Finally, we mention some old and new open problems.\n","Comment: 13 Pages"]}]

We will show that in this limit QCD is subject to instabilities\nwhich are analogous to the Weibel instability in QED. The presence of such\ninstabilities dominates the early time evolution of a highly anisotropic\nplasma; however, at longer times it is expected that these instabilities will\nsaturate (condense). I will discuss how the presence of non-linear interactions\nbetween the gluons complicates the determination of the saturated state. In\norder to discuss this I present the generalization of the Braaten-Pisarski\nisotropic hard-thermal-loop effective action to a system with a temperature\nanisotropy in the parton distribution functions. The resulting hard-loop\neffective action can be used to determine the time and energy scales associated\nwith the possible saturation (condensation) of the gluonic modes. We will also\ndiscuss the effects of anisotropies on observables, in particular on the heavy\nquark energy loss.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 2 figures; Combined contribution to proceedings of Strong\n  and Electroweak Matter 2004 (SEWM 2004), Helsinki, Finland, 16-19 June 2004;\n  v2: typos corrected; ISBN 981-256-135-8"]}]
