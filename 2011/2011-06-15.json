However, constructing practical codes for the case of non-binary\nsources with arbitrary correlation remains by and large open. From a practical\nperspective it is also interesting to consider coding schemes whose performance\nremains robust to uncertainties in the joint distribution of the sources.\n  In this work we propose the usage of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes for the\nasymmetric version of this problem. We show that algebraic soft-decision\ndecoding of RS codes can be used effectively under certain correlation\nstructures. In addition, RS codes offer natural rate adaptivity and performance\nthat remains constant across a family of correlation structures with the same\nconditional entropy. The performance of RS codes is compared with dedicated and\nrate adaptive multistage LDPC codes (Varodayan et al. '06), where each LDPC\ncode is used to compress the individual bit planes. Our simulations show that\nin classical Slepian-Wolf scenario, RS codes outperform both dedicated and\nrate-adaptive LDPC codes under $q$-ary symmetric correlation, and are better\nthan rate-adaptive LDPC codes in the case of sparse correlation models, where\nthe conditional distribution of the sources has only a few dominant entries. In\na feedback scenario, the performance of RS codes is comparable with both\ndesigns of LDPC codes.

These\ntheories contain two fundamental scales -- the speed of light and an energy\nusually taken to be Ep. The symmetry group is still the Lorentz group, but in\nboth cases acting nonlinearly on the energy-momentum sector. Accordingly, since\nenergy and momentum are no longer additive quantities, finding their values for\ncomposite systems (and hence finding the correct conservation laws) is a\nnontrivial matter. Ultimately it is these possible deviations from simple\nlinearly realized relativistic kinematics that provide the most promising\nobservational signal for empirically testing these models. Various\ninvestigations have narrowed the conservation laws down to two possibilities\nper DSR theory. We derive unique exact results for the energy-momentum of\ncomposite systems in both DSR1 and DSR2, and indicate the general strategy for\narbitrary nonlinear realizations of the Lorentz group.\n","Comment: V2: Extensive revisions: merged with gr-qc/0205093, new author added,\n  references added, discussion amplified. 4 pages, revtex4; V3: Revised in\n  response to referee comments; no physics changes; version to appear in\n  Physical Review D"]}]

It uses the parton-shower\napproach for initial- and final-state QCD radiation, including colour coherence\neffects and azimuthal correlations both within and between jets. This article\nupdates the description of HERWIG published in 1992, emphasising the new\nfeatures incorporated since then. These include, in particular, the matching of\nfirst-order matrix elements with parton showers, a more correct treatment of\nheavy quark decays, and a wide range of new processes, including many predicted\nby the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, with the option of R-parity\nviolation. At the same time we offer a brief review of the physics underlying\nHERWIG together with details of the input and control parameters and the output\ndata, to provide a self-contained guide for prospective users of the program.\nThis version of the manual (version 3) is updated to HERWIG version 6.5, which\nis expected to be the last major release of Fortran HERWIG.
