The hemispheric asymmetry is maximal toward a direction close to\nthe equatorial poles. The discrepancy between the equatorial North and South\nhemispheres shows up in the SN calibration. For the LambdaCDM model fitted to\nall available SNe, we find the same asymmetry.

In this paper we use the path\nintegral formulation of the excursion set theory developed recently to\nanalytically solve the first-passage time problem in the presence of a generic\nmoving barrier, in particular the barrier corresponding to ellipsoidal\ncollapse. We perform the computation for both Gaussian and non-Gaussian initial\nconditions. The expression of the halo mass function for the ellipsoidal\ncollapse barrier and with non-Gaussianity is therefore obtained in a fully\nconsistent way and it does not require the introduction of any form factor\nartificially derived from the Press-Schechter formalism based on the spherical\ncollapse and usually adopted in the literature.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 7 figures.

Searching for extrasolar planets through radial velocity\nmeasurements relies on the stability of stellar photospheres. Aims. We aim at\ncharacterizing the statistical properties of magnetic activity cycles, and\nstudying their impact on spectroscopic measurements such as radial velocities,\nline bisectors and line shapes. Methods. We use data from the HARPS\nhigh-precision planet-search sample comprising 304 FGK stars followed over\nabout 7 years. We obtain high-precision Ca II H&K chromospheric activity\nmeasurements and convert them to R'HK indices using an updated calibration\ntaking into account stellar metallicity. We study R'HK variability as a\nfunction of time and search for possible correlations with radial velocities\nand line shape parameters. Results. We classify stars according to the\nmagnitude and timescale of the Ca II H&K variability, and identify activity\ncycles whenever possible. We find that 39+/-8% of old solar-type stars in the\nsolar neighborhood do not show any activity cycles (or only very weak ones),\nwhile 61+/-8% do have one. Non-cycling stars are almost only found among G\ndwarfs and at mean activity levels log R'HK < -4.95. Magnetic cycle amplitude\ngenerally decreases with decreasing activity level. A significant fraction of\nstars exhibit small variations in radial velocities and line shape parameters\nthat are correlated with activity cycles. The sensitivity of radial velocities\nto magnetic cycles increases towards hotter stars, while late K dwarfs are\nalmost insensitive. Conclusions. Activity cycles do induce long-period,\nlow-amplitude radial velocity variations, at levels up to ~25 m/s. Caution is\ntherefore mandatory when searching for long-period exoplanets.

We have\ndeveloped an online service, AKARI Catalogue Archive Server (AKARI-CAS), for\nastronomers. The service includes useful and attractive search tools and visual\ntools.\n  One of the new features of AKARI-CAS is cached SIMBAD/NED entries, which can\nmatch AKARI catalogs with other catalogs stored in SIMBAD or NED. To allow\nadvanced queries to the databases, direct input of SQL is also supported. In\nthose queries, fast dynamic cross-identification between registered catalogs is\na remarkable feature. In addition, multiwavelength quick-look images are\ndisplayed in the visualization tools, which will increase the value of the\nservice.\n  In the construction of our service, we considered a wide variety of\nastronomers' requirements. As a result of our discussion, we concluded that\nsupporting users' SQL submissions is the best solution for the requirements.\nTherefore, we implemented an RDBMS layer so that it covered important\nfacilities including the whole processing of tables. We found that PostgreSQL\nis the best open-source RDBMS products for such purpose, and we wrote codes for\nboth simple and advanced searches into the SQL stored functions. To implement\nsuch stored functions for fast radial search and cross-identification with\nminimum cost, we applied a simple technique that is not based on dividing\ncelestial sphere such as HTM or HEALPix. In contrast, the Web application layer\nbecame compact, and was written in simple procedural PHP codes. In total, our\nsystem realizes cost-effective maintenance and enhancements.\n","Comment: Yamauchi, C. et al. 2011, PASP..123..852Y"]}]

We propose instead to redesign Prolog around structured\nalternatives to the cut and clauses, keeping the expressive power and\ncomputation model but with a compositional denotational semantics over much\nsimpler states-just variable bindings. This considerably eases reasoning about\nprograms, by programmers and tools such as a partial evaluator, with safe\nunfolding of calls through predicate definitions.

Now, for the\nfirst time this fundamental sum rule is verified by the GDH-Collaboration with\ncircularly polarized real photons and longitudinally polarized nucleons at the\ntwo accelerators ELSA and MAMI. The integral (sum) of the GDH Sum Rule can be\ngeneralized to the case of virtual photons. This allows to establish a Q^2\ndependency and to study the transition to the perturbative regime of QCD.\nUltimately, the GDH Sum Rule can be related to the Bjorken and the Ellis-Jaffe\nSum Rule. This contribution covers the status of theory concerning the GDH Sum\nRule as well as the experimental approaches and their results for the\nabsorption of real and virtual photons. We point out that the so-called\nNo-Subtraction hypothesis, often considered the weakest part of the derivation\nof the GDH Sum Rule, in fact follows from unitarity and does not impair the\nfundamental character of the GDH Sum Rule.
