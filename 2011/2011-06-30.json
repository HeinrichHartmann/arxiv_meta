However, previous derivations of these equations have\nmade a number of ad hoc assumptions and/or contain a number of unsatisfactory\nfeatures. For example, all previous derivations have invoked, without proper\njustification, the step of \"Lorenz gauge relaxation\", wherein the linearized\nEinstein equation is written down in the form appropriate to the Lorenz gauge,\nbut the Lorenz gauge condition is then not imposed--thereby making the\nresulting equations for the metric perturbation inequivalent to the linearized\nEinstein equations. In this paper, we analyze the issue of \"particle motion\" in\ngeneral relativity in a systematic and rigorous way by considering a\none-parameter family of metrics, $g_{ab} (\\lambda)$, corresponding to having a\nbody (or black hole) that is \"scaled down\" to zero size and mass in an\nappropriate manner. We prove that the limiting worldline of such a\none-parameter family must be a geodesic of the background metric, $g_{ab}\n(\\lambda=0)$. Gravitational self-force--as well as the force due to coupling of\nthe spin of the body to curvature--then arises as a first-order perturbative\ncorrection in $\\lambda$ to this worldline. No assumptions are made in our\nanalysis apart from the smoothness and limit properties of the one-parameter\nfamily of metrics. Our approach should provide a framework for systematically\ncalculating higher order corrections to gravitational self-force, including\nhigher multipole effects, although we do not attempt to go beyond first order\ncalculations here.

While this has been proved for many\nthin patterned ensembles sitting inside all real symmetric matrices, frequently\nthere is no nice closed form expression for the limiting measure. Further,\ncurrent theorems provide few pictures of transitions between ensembles. We\nconsider the ensemble of symmetric m-block circulant matrices with entries\ni.i.d.r.v. These matrices have toroidal diagonals periodic of period m. We view\nm as a \"dial\" we can \"turn\" from the thin ensemble of symmetric circulant\nmatrices, whose limiting eigenvalue density is a Gaussian, to all real\nsymmetric matrices, whose limiting eigenvalue density is a semi-circle. The\nlimiting eigenvalue densities f_m show a visually stunning convergence to the\nsemi-circle as m tends to infinity, which we prove. In contrast to most studies\nof patterned matrix ensembles, our paper gives explicit closed form expressions\nfor the densities. We prove that f_m is the product of a Gaussian and a degree\n2m-2 polynomial; the formula equals that of the m x m Gaussian Unitary Ensemble\n(GUE). The proof is by the moments. The new feature, which allows us to obtain\nclosed form expressions, is converting the central combinatorial problem in the\nmoment calculation into an equivalent counting problem in algebraic topology.\nWe end with a generalization of the m-block circulant pattern, dropping the\nassumption that the m random variables be distinct. We prove that the limiting\nspectral distribution exists and is determined by the pattern of the\nindependent elements within an m-period, depending on not only the frequency at\nwhich each element appears, but also the way the elements are arranged.\n","Comment: 39 pages, 10 figures; version 3.1 (includes a new appendix on\n  generalized m-block circulant ensembles)"]}]

The\nfluctuation and dissipation from motion of caged molecules when observed by\nelastic incoherent neutron scattering exhibit a change in temperature\ndependence of the mean square displacement (MSD) at the glass transition\ntemperature Tg. This is a general and fundamental property of caged dynamics in\nglassformers, which is observed always near Tg independent of the energy\nresolution of the spectrometer.

In these\nsolvated proteins, all having Tg and Td higher than the proteins hydrated by\nwater alone, the observation of the change of T-dependence of the MSD at Tg is\nunobstructed by the methyl-group rotation contribution at lower temperatures.\nOn the other hand, proteins hydrated by water alone have lower Tg and Td, and\nhence unambiguous evidence of the transition of MSD at Tg is hard to find.\nNotwithstanding, evidence on the break of the MSD at Tg can be found by\ndeuterating the protein to suppress the methyl-group contribution. An\nalternative strategy is the use of a spectrometer that senses motions faster\nthan 15 ps, which confers the benefit of shifting both the onset of\nmethyl-group rotation contribution as well as the dynamic transition to higher\ntemperatures, and again the change of MSD at Tg becomes evident.
