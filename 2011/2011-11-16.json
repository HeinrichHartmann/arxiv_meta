The corrections to the neutralino and chargino\nmasses, due to these operators, are computed analytically in function of the\nMSSM corresponding values. For individual operators, the corrections are small,\nof few GeV for the constrained MSSM (CMSSM) viable parameter space. We\ninvestigate the correction to the lightest Higgs mass, which receives, from\nindividual operators, a supersymmetric correction of up to 4 (6) GeV above the\n2-loop leading-log CMSSM value, from those CMSSM phase space points with: EW\nfine tuning Delta<200, consistent with WMAP relic density (3$\\sigma$), and for\na scale of the operators of M=10 (8) TeV, respectively.

If each item is hashed to two buckets of capacity two, the page size is\n8, and each bucket is fully contained in a single page, the memory utilization\nequals 89.71% in the classical contiguous disjoint bucket variant, 93.78% in\nthe contiguous overlapping bucket variant, and increases to 97.46% in our new\nnon-contiguous bucket variant.

An emphasis will be placed on a few simple core\nideas that underlie not only recent theoretical advances but also the\nusefulness of these tools in large-scale data applications. Crucial in this\ncontext is the connection with the concept of statistical leverage. This\nconcept has long been used in statistical regression diagnostics to identify\noutliers; and it has recently proved crucial in the development of improved\nworst-case matrix algorithms that are also amenable to high-quality numerical\nimplementation and that are useful to domain scientists. Randomized methods\nsolve problems such as the linear least-squares problem and the low-rank matrix\napproximation problem by constructing and operating on a randomized sketch of\nthe input matrix. Depending on the specifics of the situation, when compared\nwith the best previously-existing deterministic algorithms, the resulting\nrandomized algorithms have worst-case running time that is asymptotically\nfaster; their numerical implementations are faster in terms of clock-time; or\nthey can be implemented in parallel computing environments where existing\nnumerical algorithms fail to run at all.

Therefore, improving quantum wavepacket dynamics and incorporating\nnonadiabatic transitions and quantum effects into classical and semi-classical\nmolecular dynamics is critical as well as challenging.

The new quantum EOM is tested on a one-state one-dimensional and a\ntwo-state two-dimensional model nonadiabatic systems. The global quantum force\nexperienced by each trajectory promotes energy redistribution among the bundle\nof trajectories, and thus helps the individual trajectory tunnel through the\npotential barrier higher than the energy of the trajectory itself.

For each value of the galactic latitude z we look for the models which\nsimultaneously fit the observed values of the [OIII]/Hb, [OII]/Hb, and [NII]/Ha\nratios. For each value of z we find a range of solutions which depends on the\nvalue of the oxygen abundance. The models which fit the observations indicate a\nsystematic decrease of the electron density with increasing z. They become\ndominated by the HOLMES with increasing z only when restricting to solar oxygen\nabundance models, which argues that the metallicity above the galactic plane\nshould be close to solar. They also indicate that N/O increases with increasing\nz.\n","Comment: 3 pages, 4 figures, Proceedings IAU Symposium No. 284 \"The Spectral\n  Energy Distribution of Galaxies\""]}]

In particular\nwe can construct complete families of solutions to the inverse problem from any\ngiven pure point measure that is chosen to be the diffraction. In this case\nthese processes can be classified by the dual of the group of relators based on\nthe set of Bragg peaks, and this gives a solution to the homometry problem for\npure point diffraction.\n  An ergodic spatial stationary process consists of a measure theoretical\ndynamical system and a mapping linking it with the ambient space in which\ndiffracting density is supposed to exist. After introducing these processes we\nstudy their general properties and link pure point diffraction to almost\nperiodicity.\n  Given a pure point measure we show how to construct from it and a given set\nof phases a corresponding ergodic spatial stationary process. In fact we do\nthis in two separate ways, each of which sheds its own light on the nature of\nthe problem. The first construction can be seen as an elaboration of the\nHalmos--von Neumann theorem, lifted from the domain of dynamical systems to\nthat of stationary processes. The second is a Gelfand construction obtained by\ndefining a suitable Banach algebra out of the putative eigenfunctions of the\ndesired dynamics.\n","Comment: 56 pages, 1 figure"]}]

The Universe starts off hot and trapped in a\nfalse vacuum. The Universe supercools and inflates solving the horizon and\nflatness problems. The inflaton couples to a set of QCD like fermions. When the\nfermions' non-Abelian gauge group freezes, the Yukawa terms generate a tadpole\nfor the inflaton, which removes the barrier. Inflation ends, and the Universe\nrapidly reheats. The thermal effect is technically natural in the same way that\nthe QCD scale is technically natural. In fact, Witten used a similar mechanism\nto drive the Electro-Weak (EW) phase transition; critically, no scalar field\ndrives inflation, which allows SCI to avoid eternal inflation and the measure\nproblem. SCI also works at scales, which can be probed in the lab, and could be\nconnected to EW symmetry breaking. Finally, we introduce a light spectator\nfield to generate density perturbations, which match the CMB. The light field\ndoes not affect the inflationary dynamics and can potentially generate\nnon-Gaussianities and isocurvature perturbations observable with Planck.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 6 figures"]}]
