Each pool is then tested and defective items are\nidentified. A fundamental question involves minimizing the number of pools\nrequired to identify at most $d$ defective items. Motivated by applications in\nnetwork tomography, sensor networks and infection propagation, a variation of\ngroup testing problems on graphs is formulated. Unlike conventional group\ntesting problems, each group here must conform to the constraints imposed by a\ngraph. For instance, items can be associated with vertices and each pool is any\nset of nodes that must be path connected. In this paper, a test is associated\nwith a random walk. In this context, conventional group testing corresponds to\nthe special case of a complete graph on $n$ vertices.\n  For interesting classes of graphs a rather surprising result is obtained,\nnamely, that the number of tests required to identify $d$ defective items is\nsubstantially similar to what is required in conventional group testing\nproblems, where no such constraints on pooling is imposed. Specifically, if\nT(n) corresponds to the mixing time of the graph $G$, it is shown that with\n$m=O(d^2T^2(n)\\log(n/d))$ non-adaptive tests, one can identify the defective\nitems. Consequently, for the Erdos-Renyi random graph $G(n,p)$, as well as\nexpander graphs with constant spectral gap, it follows that $m=O(d^2\\log^3n)$\nnon-adaptive tests are sufficient to identify $d$ defective items. Next, a\nspecific scenario is considered that arises in network tomography, for which it\nis shown that $m=O(d^3\\log^3n)$ non-adaptive tests are sufficient to identify\n$d$ defective items. Noisy counterparts of the graph constrained group testing\nproblem are considered, for which parallel results are developed.

Coherent periodic fluctuation in origination/extinction of marine\ngenera that survive <45 million years is the source of an observed ~62 million\nyear periodicity analyzed in Paper I. We also show that the evolutionary\ndynamics of \"long-lived\" genera (those that survive >45 million years) do not\nparticipate in the periodic fluctuation in diversity and differ from those of\n\"short-lived\" genera. The difference between the evolutionary dynamics of these\n2 genera classes indicates that the periodic pattern is not an artifact of\nvariation in quality of the geologic record. The interplay of these two\npreviously undifferentiated systems, together with the secular increase in\nabundance of \"long-lived\" genera, is probably the source of heretofore\nunexplained differences in evolutionary dynamics between the Paleozoic and\npost-Paleozoic as reported by others. Testing for cycles similar to the 62 Myr\ncycle in fossil biodiversity superimposed on the long-term trends of the\nPhanerozoic as described in Paper I, we find a significant (but weaker) signal\nin sedimentary rock packages, particularly carbonates, which suggests a\nconnection. The presence of a periodic pattern in evolutionary dynamics of the\nvulnerable \"short-lived\" component of marine fauna demonstrates that a\nlong-term periodic fluctuation in environmental conditions capable of affecting\nevolution in the marine realm characterizes our planet. Coincidence in timing\nis more consistent with a common cause than sampling bias. A previously\nidentified set of mass extinctions preferentially occur during the declining\nphase of the 62 Myr periodicity, supporting the idea that the periodicity\nrelates to variation in biotically important stresses.

We consider some of the most common\ninformation transmission tasks - the Bayes cost problem (of which minimal error\ndiscrimination is a special case), unambiguous message discrimination, and the\nmaximal mutual information. We provide general solutions to the Bayesian and\nunambiguous discrimination problems. We also show that the maximal mutual\ninformation has an interpretation of a capacity of the measurement, and derive\nvarious properties that it satisfies, including its relation to the accessible\ninformation of an ensemble of states, and its form in the case of a\ngroup-covariant measurement.

Two steepest descent preconditioning\nvariants are proposed. The first employs a line search, while the second\nemploys a predefined small step. A simple global convergence proof is provided\nfor the N-GMRES optimization algorithm with the first steepest descent\npreconditioner (with line search), under mild standard conditions on the\nobjective function and the line search processes. Steepest descent\npreconditioning for N-GMRES optimization is also motivated by relating it to\nstandard non-preconditioned GMRES for linear systems in the case of a quadratic\noptimization problem with symmetric positive definite operator. Numerical tests\non a variety of model problems show that the N-GMRES optimization algorithm is\nable to very significantly accelerate convergence of stand-alone steepest\ndescent optimization. Moreover, performance of steepest-descent preconditioned\nN-GMRES is shown to be competitive with standard nonlinear conjugate gradient\nand limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno methods for the model\nproblems considered. These results serve to theoretically and numerically\nestablish steepest-descent preconditioned N-GMRES as a general optimization\nmethod for unconstrained nonlinear optimization, with performance that appears\npromising compared to established techniques.

Simulations show\nthat the formation of aggregation-prone structures (N$^*$) similar to the\nstructure in the fibril requires overcoming high desolvation barrier. The\nmechanism of protofilament formation in a polar Sup35 peptide fragment\nillustrates that water dramatically slows down self-assembly.

Multiple N$^*$ structures with varying water content results in a number\nof distinct water-laden polymorphic structures. In predominantly hydrophobic\nsequences, water accelerates fibril formation.

In contrast, rate equation\nmodels are based on the implicit assumption of infinitely large numbers of\ninteracting molecules, or equivalently, that reactions occur in infinite\nvolumes at constant macroscopic concentrations. In this article we compute the\nfinite-volume corrections (or equivalently the finite copy number corrections)\nto the solutions of the rate equations for chemical reaction networks composed\nof arbitrarily large numbers of enzyme-catalyzed reactions which are confined\ninside a small sub-cellular compartment.

While relatively mature, DFT has never\nbeen implemented in its full power, as it relies on a very large number (~\n10^9-10^12) of expensive calculations (~ day). The advent of leadership-class\ncomputers, as well as dedicated large-scale collaborative efforts such as the\nSciDAC 2 UNEDF project, have dramatically changed the field.

Unlike the toy-models previously studied in the literature,\nour toy-model allows for an observer to have a full knowledge of a system's\nreal (ontic) state. This is achieved by introducing domains of disjointness,\nthat is by allowing ontic states to be \"non-orthogonal\". The observer can\nperform tests which allow her to distinguish between the states in a single\ndomain of disjointness, but not between all ontic states at once. The\nconsequence of this assumption is that the ontic picture is extended to include\njoint states of two or more systems. This effectively amounts to emergence of\nentanglement in the model. We argue that these features, albeit being a\n\"non-classical\" element in the theory, support the view that quantum-mechanical\nstates are ontic states.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 2 figures"]}]
