We propose a\nstrategy to enhance the sampling of MCMC in this context, using a biasing\nprocedure which originates from computational Statistical Physics. The\nprinciple is first to choose a \"reaction coordinate\", that is, a \"direction\" in\nwhich the target distribution is multimodal. In a second step, the marginal\nlog-density of the reaction coordinate with respect to the posterior\ndistribution is estimated; minus this quantity is called \"free energy\" in the\ncomputational Statistical Physics literature. To this end, we use adaptive\nbiasing Markov chain algorithms which adapt their targeted invariant\ndistribution on the fly, in order to overcome sampling barriers along the\nchosen reaction coordinate. Finally, we perform an importance sampling step in\norder to remove the bias and recover the true posterior. The efficiency factor\nof the importance sampling step can easily be estimated \\emph{a priori} once\nthe bias is known, and appears to be rather large for the test cases we\nconsidered. A crucial point is the choice of the reaction coordinate. One\nstandard choice (used for example in the classical Wang-Landau algorithm) is\nminus the log-posterior density. We discuss other choices. We show in\nparticular that the hyper-parameter that determines the order of magnitude of\nthe variance of each component is both a convenient and an efficient reaction\ncoordinate. We also show how to adapt the method to compute the evidence\n(marginal likelihood) of a mixture model. We illustrate our approach by\nanalyzing two real data sets.\n"]}]

Within the fireshell model, the canonical GRB\nlight curve presents two different components: the proper-GRB (P-GRB) and the\nextended afterglow. [...] In particular, the traditionally called short GRBs\ncan be either \"genuine\" short GRBs [...] or \"disguised\" short GRBs [...]. AIMS:\nWe verify whether GRB 050509b can be classified as a \"genuine\" short or a\n\"disguised\" short GRB, in the fireshell model. Methods: We investigate two\nalternative scenarios. In the first, we start from the assumption that this GRB\nis a \"genuine\" short burst. In the second attempt, we assume that this GRB is a\n\"disguised\" burst. Results: If GRB 050509b were a genuine short GRB, there\nshould initially be very hard emission which is ruled out by the observations.\nThe analysis that assumes that this is a disguised short GRB is compatible with\nthe observations. The theoretical model predicts a value of the extended\nafterglow energy peak that is consistent with the Amati relation. Conclusions:\nGRB 050509b cannot be classified as a \"genuine\" short GRB. The observational\ndata are consistent with a \"disguised\" short GRB classification, i.e., a long\nburst with a weak extended afterglow \"deflated\" by the low density of the CBM.\nWe expect that all short GRBs with measured redshifts are disguised short GRBs\nbecause of a selection effect: if there is enough energy in the afterglow to\nmeasure the redshift, then the proper GRB must be less energetic than the\nafterglow. The Amati relation is found to be fulfilled only by the extended\nafterglow excluding the P-GRB.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 6 figures, to appear in A&A.

We give a combinatorial description for some weighted sums of their\ncharacters, i.e., we introduce combinatorial objects called\n$(\\rho,\\Ll)$-tabloids and rewrite weighted sums of characters as the numbers of\nthese combinatorial objects. We also consider the meaning of these\ncombinatorial objects, i.e., we construct a correspondence between\n$(\\rho,\\Ll)$-tabloids and tabloids whose images are eigenvectors of the action\nof an element of cycle type $\\rho$ in quotient modules.\n"]}]
