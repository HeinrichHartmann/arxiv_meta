Our analysis probes SFRs over 5 orders\nof magnitude, down to ultra-low activities on the order of ~0.0001 M_sun/yr.\nThe data are drawn from the 11 Mpc H-alpha and Ultraviolet Galaxy Survey\n(11HUGS), which has obtained H-alpha fluxes from ground-based narrowband\nimaging, and UV fluxes from imaging with GALEX. For normal spiral galaxies\n(SFR~1 M_sun/yr), our results are consistent with previous work which has shown\nthat FUV SFRs tend to be lower than H-alpha SFRs before accounting for internal\ndust attenuation, but that there is relative consistency between the two\ntracers after proper corrections are applied. However, a puzzle is encountered\nat the faint end of the luminosity function. As lower luminosity dwarf\ngalaxies, roughly less active than the Small Magellanic Cloud, are examined,\nH-alpha tends to increasingly under-predict the SFR relative to the FUV.\nAlthough past studies have suggested similar trends, this is the first time\nthis effect is probed with a statistical sample for galaxies with SFR~<0.1\nM_sun/yr. A range of standard explanations does not appear to be able to\naccount for the magnitude of the systematic. Some recent work has argued for an\nIMF which is deficient in high mass stars in dwarf and low surface brightness\ngalaxies, and we also consider this scenario.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables, accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

The asymptotic analysis\npredicts the fraction of unverified signal elements at each iteration $\\ell$ in\nthe asymptotic regime where $n \\rightarrow \\infty$. The analysis is similar in\nnature to the well-known density evolution technique commonly used to analyze\niterative decoding algorithms.

Both orderings are defined for\nsimple STRIPS operators as well as for more complex ADL operators supporting\nnegation and conditional effects. The complexity of these orderings is\ninvestigated and their practical relevance is discussed. Secondly, two\ndifferent methods to compute reasonable goal orderings are developed.

Agents have finite-state automaton\nplans, which are adapted online via evolutionary learning (perturbation)\noperators.

Analysis indicates that\nthe performance of the Boosting methods is dependent on the characteristics of\nthe data set being examined. In fact, further results show that Boosting\nensembles may overfit noisy data sets, thus decreasing its performance.\nFinally, consistent with previous studies, our work suggests that most of the\ngain in an ensemble's performance comes in the first few classifiers combined;\nhowever, relatively large gains can be seen up to 25 classifiers when Boosting\ndecision trees.\n"]}]
