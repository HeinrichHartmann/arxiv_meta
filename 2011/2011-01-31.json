For example, in the case\nof the VEC family, the number of parameters involved in the model grows as a\npolynomial of order four on the dimensionality of the problem. Moreover, these\nparameters are subjected to convoluted nonlinear constraints necessary to\nensure, for instance, the existence of stationary solutions and the positive\nsemidefinite character of the conditional covariance matrices used in the model\ndesign. So far, this problem has been addressed in the literature only in low\ndimensional cases with strong parsimony constraints. In this paper we propose a\ngeneral formulation of the estimation problem in any dimension and develop a\nBregman-proximal trust-region method for its solution. The Bregman-proximal\napproach allows us to handle the constraints in a very efficient and natural\nway by staying in the primal space and the Trust-Region mechanism stabilizes\nand speeds up the scheme. Preliminary computational experiments are presented\nand confirm the very good performances of the proposed approach.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 5 figures"]}]

As for the first one it is known that ERPs\nespecially of those with later response reflect the process of mental\neffortfullness to select the appropriate behavior and accomplish decision\nmaking during the action of target stimulus. Thus selection of action as well\nas decision making is the most important points affected in ADHD children.\nBesides in recent years EEG biofeedback (Neurofeedback) have become the\nevidence-based in the treatment of ADHD. Unfortunately the effectiveness of\nthis approach on ERPs parameters is still unknown. Thus we aimed to study the\nchanges of ERPs after neurofeedback therapy.

Several different approaches exist to solve such class of problems,\ne.g., Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) based\non Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm (SSS). Such techniques are complete from a\ncomputation-theoretic perspective: given a set of private inputs, it is\npossible to perform arbitrary computation tasks without revealing any of the\nintermediate results. In fact, HE and SSS can operate also on secret inputs\nand/or provide secret outputs.

We take into account saturated electron\nthermal conductivity and Bremsstrahlung energy losses of two temperature plasma\nfor density and temperature near the Bondi radius similar to those observed in\nM87 galaxy. Joint action of electron thermal conductivity and free-free\nradiation leads to the effective cooling of accreting plasma and formation of\nthe subsonic settling of accreting gas above the zone of a centrifugal barrier.\nA toroidal condensation and a hollow funnel that separates the torus from the\nblack hole emerge near the barrier.

A key\nfeature of our model is that consumers experience a (positive) local network\neffect. In particular, each consumer's usage level depends directly on the\nusage of her neighbors in the social network structure. Thus, the monopolist's\noptimal pricing strategy may involve offering discounts to certain agents, who\nhave a central position in the underlying network.\n  First, we consider a setting where the monopolist can offer individualized\nprices and derive an explicit characterization of the optimal price for each\nconsumer as a function of her network position. In particular, we show that it\nis optimal for the monopolist to charge each agent a price that is proportional\nto her Bonacich centrality in the social network. In the second part of the\npaper, we discuss the optimal strategy of a monopolist that can only choose a\nsingle uniform price for the good and derive an algorithm polynomial in the\nnumber of agents to compute such a price. Thirdly, we assume that the\nmonopolist can offer the good in two prices, full and discounted, and study the\nproblem of determining which set of consumers should be given the discount. We\nshow that the problem is NP-hard, however we provide an explicit\ncharacterization of the set of agents that should be offered the discounted\nprice. Next, we describe an approximation algorithm for finding the optimal set\nof agents. We show that if the profit is nonnegative under any feasible price\nallocation, the algorithm guarantees at least 88% of the optimal profit.\nFinally, we highlight the value of network information by comparing the profits\nof a monopolist that does not take into account the network effects when\nchoosing her pricing policy to those of a monopolist that uses this information\noptimally.\n","Comment: 29 pages"]}]

We introduce a new, publicly available Monte\nCarlo radiative transfer code, Stokes, which models polarization induced by\nscattering off free electrons and dust grains. We find that the shape of the\nfunnel of the dusty torus has a significant impact on the polarization\nefficiency. A compact torus with a steep inner surface scatters more light\ntoward type-2 viewing angles than a large torus of the same half-opening angle,\ntheta0. For theta0 < 53 deg, the scattered light is polarized perpendicularly\nto the symmetry axis, whilst for theta0 > 60 deg it is polarized parallel to\nthe symmetry axis. In between these intervals the orientation of the\npolarization depends on the viewing angle. The degree of polarization ranges\nbetween 0% and 20% and is wavelength-independent for a large range of theta0.\nObserved wavelength-independent optical and near-UV polarization thus does not\nnecessarily imply electron scattering. For polar dust, scattering spectra are\nreddened for type-1 viewing angles, and made bluer for type-2 viewing angles.\nPolar electron-scattering cones are very efficient polarizers at type-2 viewing\nangles, whilst the polarized flux of the torus is weak. We predict that the net\npolarization of Seyfert-2 galaxies decreases with luminosity, and conclude that\nthe degree of polarization should be correlated with the relative strength of\nthe thermal IR flux.

Performing an up-to-date global analysis of solar, atmospheric,\nreactor and long baseline neutrino data in the context of three-neutrino\noscillations, we determine the presently allowed ranges of masses and mixing\nand we consistently derive the allowed magnitude of the elements of the\nleptonic mixing matrix.

The purpose of this paper is to review and\ncompare different methods for the estimate of the total gravitational energy\nemitted in this process. To date, black hole formation has mainly been studied\nusing an apparent horizon search technique. This approach yields only an upper\nbound on the gravitational energy emitted during black hole formation.\nAlternative calculations based on instantaneous collisions of point particles\nand black hole perturbation theory suggest that the emitted gravitational\nenergy may be smaller.
