First, agents\nmaintain individual lists of bookmarks (a non-Markovian memory mechanism) that\nare used as teleportation targets.

The results of this manuscript has been merged and published with\nanother paper of the same authors: A new approach to nonrepetitve sequences.)\n  A repetition of size $h$ ($h\\geqslant1$) in a given sequence is a subsequence\nof consecutive terms of the form: $xx=x_1... x_hx_1... x_h$. A sequence is\nnonrepetitive if it does not contain a repetition of any size. The remarkable\nconstruction of Thue asserts that 3 different symbols are enough to build an\narbitrarily long nonrepetitive sequence. We consider game-theoretic versions of\nresults on nonrepetitive sequences. A nonrepetitive game is played by two\nplayers who pick, one by one, consecutive terms of a sequence over a given set\nof symbols. The first player tries to avoid repetitions, while the second\nplayer, in contrast, wants to create them. Of course, by simple imitation, the\nsecond player can force lots of repetitions of size 1. However, as proved by\nPegden, there is a strategy for the first player to build an arbitrarily long\nsequence over 37 symbols with no repetitions of size $>1$. Our techniques allow\nto reduce 37 to 6. Another game we consider is an erase-repetition game. Here,\nwhenever a repetition occurs, the repeated block is immediately erased and the\nnext player to move continues the play. We prove that there is a strategy for\nthe first player to build an arbitrarily long nonrepetitive sequence over 8\nsymbols. Our approach is inspired by a new algorithmic proof of the Lov\\'asz\nLocal Lemma due to Moser and Tardos and previous work of Moser (his so called\nentropy compression argument).\n","Comment: 8 pages, no figures"]}]

The tree is built in a \"top-down\"\nfashion by \"recursive coordinate bisection\" where on each tree level we split\nthe longest side of a cell through its centre of mass. This procedure continues\nuntil the average number of particles in the lowest tree level has dropped\nbelow a prescribed value. To calculate the forces on the particles in each\nlowest-level cell we split the gravitational interaction into a near- and a\nfar-field. Since our main intended applications are SPH simulations, we\ncalculate the near-field by a direct, kernel-smoothed summation, while the far\nfield is evaluated via a Cartesian Taylor expansion up to quadrupole order.\nInstead of applying the far-field approach for each particle separately, we use\nanother Taylor expansion around the centre of mass of each lowest-level cell to\ndetermine the forces at the particle positions. Due to this \"cell-cell\ninteraction\" the code performance is close to O(N) where N is the number of\nused particles. We describe in detail various technicalities that ensure a low\nmemory footprint and an efficient cache use.\n  In a set of benchmark tests we scrutinize our new tree and compare it to the\n\"Press tree\" that we have previously made ample use of. At a slightly higher\nforce accuracy than the Press tree, our tree turns out to be substantially\nfaster and increasingly more so for larger particle numbers. For four million\nparticles our tree build is faster by a factor of 25 and the time for neighbour\nsearch and gravity is reduced by more than a factor of 6. In single processor\ntests with up to 10^8 particles we confirm experimentally that the scaling\nbehaviour is close to O(N).

In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, called AN, based on a new\napproach called dynamic-time-quantum; the idea of this approach is to make the\noperating systems adjusts the time quantum according to the burst time of the\nset of waiting processes in the ready queue. Based on the simulations and\nexperiments, we show that the new proposed algorithm solves the fixed time\nquantum problem and increases the performance of Round Robin.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures"]}]

We introduce an efficient\nmethod that generates for every node and every edge its betweenness centrality\nbased on shortest paths of lengths not longer than $\\ell = 1,...,L$ in case of\nnon-weighted networks, and for weighted networks the corresponding quantities\nbased on minimum weight paths with path weights not larger than $w_{\\ell}=\\ell\n\\Delta$, $\\ell=1,2...,L=R/\\Delta$. These measures provide a systematic\ndescription on the positioning importance of a node (edge) with respect to its\nnetwork neighborhoods 1-step out, 2-steps out, etc. up to including the whole\nnetwork. We show that range-limited centralities obey universal scaling laws\nfor large non-weighted networks. As the computation of traditional centrality\nmeasures is costly, this scaling behavior can be exploited to efficiently\nestimate centralities of nodes and edges for all ranges, including the\ntraditional ones. The scaling behavior can also be exploited to show that the\nranking top-list of nodes (edges) based on their range-limited centralities\nquickly freezes as function of the range, and hence the diameter-range top-list\ncan be efficiently predicted. We also show how to estimate the typical largest\nnode-to-node distance for a network of $N$ nodes, exploiting the aforementioned\nscaling behavior. These observations are illustrated on model networks and on a\nlarge social network inferred from cell-phone trace logs ($\\sim 5.5\\times 10^6$\nnodes and $\\sim 2.7\\times 10^7$ edges).
