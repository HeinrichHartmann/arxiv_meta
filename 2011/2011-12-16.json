Here, I develop two general aspects of the public\ngoods problem that have received relatively little attention. First, variation\nin individual resources favors selfish individuals to vary their allocation to\npublic goods. Those individuals better endowed contribute their excess\nresources to public benefit, whereas those individuals with fewer resources\ncontribute less to the public good. Thus, purely selfish behavior causes\nindividuals to stratify into upper classes that contribute greatly to public\nbenefit and social cohesion and to lower classes that contribute little to the\npublic good. Second, if group success absolutely requires production of the\npublic good, then the pressure favoring production is relatively high. By\ncontrast, if group success depends weakly on the public good, then the pressure\nfavoring production is relatively weak. Stated in this way, it is obvious that\nthe role of baseline success is important. However, discussions of public goods\nproblems sometimes fail to emphasize this point sufficiently. The models here\nsuggest simple tests for the roles of resource variation and baseline success.\nGiven the widespread importance of public goods, better models and tests would\ngreatly deepen our understanding of many processes in biology and sociality.\n"]}]

First,\nan individual gains by outcompeting its neighbors for local resources. Second,\nan individual's share of group success must be weighted by the total\nproductivity of the group. The essence of sociality arises from the tension\nbetween selfish gains against neighbors and the associated loss that\nselfishness imposes by degrading the efficiency of the group. Without some\nforce to modulate selfishness, the natural tendencies of self interest\ntypically degrade group performance to the detriment of all. This is the\ntragedy of the commons. Kin selection provides the most widely discussed way in\nwhich the tragedy is overcome in biology. Kin selection arises from behavioral\nassociations within groups caused either by genetical kinship or by other\nprocesses that correlate the behaviors of group members. Here, I emphasize\ndemography as a second factor that may also modulate the tragedy of the commons\nand favor cooperative integration of groups. Each act of selfishness or\ncooperation in a group often influences group survival and fecundity over many\nsubsequent generations. For example, a cooperative act early in the growth\ncycle of a colony may enhance the future size and survival of the colony. This\ntime-dependent benefit can greatly increase the degree of cooperation favored\nby natural selection, providing another way in which to overcome the tragedy of\nthe commons and enhance the integration of group behavior.

Despite its fundamental role, it is\ntypically introduced as an abstract element of the theory with no explicit\ndefinition. Rather, physicists come to a working understanding of the\nwavefunction through its use to calculate measurement outcome probabilities via\nthe Born Rule. Presently, scientists determine the wavefunction through\ntomographic methods, which estimate the wavefunction that is most consistent\nwith a diverse collection of measurements. The indirectness of these methods\ncompounds the problem of defining the wavefunction.
