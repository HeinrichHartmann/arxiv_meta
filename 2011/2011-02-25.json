We introduce a discrete-time\nquantum walk model in which the interference effect is modified to diffuse or\nstrongly localize the probability distribution of the particle by assigning a\ndifferent set of coin parameters picked randomly for each step of the walk,\nrespectively. Spatial localization of the particle/state is explained by\ncomparing the variance of the probability distribution of the quantum walk in\nposition space using disordered coin operation to that of the walk using an\nidentical coin operation for each step. Due to the high degree of control over\nquantum coin operation and most of the system parameters, ultracold atoms in an\noptical lattice offer opportunities to implement a disordered quantum walk that\nis unitary and induces localization. Here we present a scheme to use a\nBose-Einstein condensate that can be evolved to the superposition of its\ninternal states in an optical lattice and control the dynamics of atoms to\nobserve localization. This approach can be adopted to any other physical system\nin which controlled disordered quantum walk can be implemented.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures, published version"]}]

Each nontrivial scaling turns out into a different dynamics\nand, in general, into an inequivalent quantum field theory. In this work we\nanalyze this freedom at the quantum level for a scalar field in a\nnonstationary, homogeneous spacetime whose spatial sections have $S^3$\ntopology. A scaling of the configuration variable is introduced as part of a\nlinear, time dependent canonical transformation in phase space.

This complements another previous uniqueness\nresult for scalar fields with a time varying mass on $S^3$, which selects a\nspecific equivalence class of Fock representations of the canonical commutation\nrelations under the conditions of a unitary evolution and the invariance of the\nvacuum under the background symmetries.

We\nrealise that in the case of flat knots all parities originate from homology\ngroups of underlying surfaces and, at the same time, allow one to \"localise\"\nthe global homological information about the ambient space at crossings.\n  We prove that there is only one non-trivial parity for free knots, the\nGaussian parity.
