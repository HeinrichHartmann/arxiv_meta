Binary\ninspiral typically involves spatial scales (the spatial resolution required by\na small or rapidly spinning hole) which are orders of magnitude smaller than\nthe relevant (orbital, precession, and radiation-reaction) timescales\ncharacterizing the inspiral. Therefore, in explicit evolutions of binary black\nholes, the timestep size is typically orders of magnitude smaller than the\nrelevant physical timescales.

For applications which need to consider\nboth chromospheric and coronal models, the chromosphere-corona boundary, where\nthese functions have different values as well as gradients, can lead to\nnumerical problems. We encountered this problem in context of ray tracing\nthrough the corona at low radio frequencies, as a part of effort to prepare for\nthe analysis of solar images from new generation radio arrays like the\nMurchison Widefield Array (MWA), Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and Long\nWavelength Array (LWA).

This may be compared to monstrous moonshine, in\nwhich modular functions are attached to elements of the Monster group. One of\nthe most remarkable aspects of monstrous moonshine is the following genus zero\nproperty: the modular functions turn out to be the generators for the function\nfields of their invariance groups. In particular, these invariance groups\ndefine genus zero quotients of the upper half plane. It is therefore natural to\nask if there is an analogue of this property in the Mathieu case, and at first\nglance the answer appears to be negative since not all the discrete groups\narising there have genus zero. On the other hand, in this article we prove that\neach (mock) modular form appearing in the Mathieu correspondence coincides with\nthe Rademacher sum constructed from its polar part. This property, inspired by\nthe AdS/CFT correspondence in physics, was shown previously to be equivalent to\nthe genus zero property of monstrous moonshine. Hence we conclude that this\n\"Rademacher summability\" property serves as the natural analogue of the genus\nzero property in the Mathieu case.

Several (existing) quality\nmeasures can be (re)formulated based on the so-called co-ranking matrix, which\nsubsumes all rank errors (i.e. differences between the ranking of distances\nfrom every point to all others, comparing the low-dimensional representation to\nthe original data). The measures are often based on the partioning of the\nco-ranking matrix into 4 submatrices, divided at the K-th row and column,\ncalculating a weighted combination of the sums of each submatrix. Hence, the\nevaluation process typically involves plotting a graph over several (or even\nall possible) settings of the parameter K. Considering simple artificial\nexamples, we argue that this parameter controls two notions at once, that need\nnot necessarily be combined, and that the rectangular shape of submatrices is\ndisadvantageous for an intuitive interpretation of the parameter. We debate\nthat quality measures, as general and flexible evaluation tools, should have\nparameters with a direct and intuitive interpretation as to which specific\nerror types are tolerated or penalized. Therefore, we propose to replace K with\ntwo parameters to control these notions separately, and introduce a differently\nshaped weighting on the co-ranking matrix. The two new parameters can then\ndirectly be interpreted as a threshold up to which rank errors are tolerated,\nand a threshold up to which the rank-distances are significant for the\nevaluation. Moreover, we propose a color representation of local quality to\nvisually support the evaluation process for a given mapping, where every point\nin the mapping is colored according to its local contribution to the overall\nquality.\n","Comment: This is an article for the Dagstuhl Preprint Archive, belonging to\n  Dagstuhl Seminar No. 11341 \"Learning in the context of very high dimensional\n  data\""]}]

One of the three\nunclassified variables may be a non-member on account of its large angular\ndistance from the center of the cluster. Four of the six faintest variable\nstars, which include two eclipsing binaries and two very red stars showing\nyear-to-year variations, are certain non-members. One of the remaining two\nfaintest variable stars, an EA-type eclipsing binary may be a member, while the\nfaintest one, a W Ursae Majoris-type variable, is probably a non-member. For\n6937 stars we provide the V magnitudes and (V-I)_C color indices on the\nstandard system. Because of nonuniform reddening over the cluster's face, a\ndirect comparison of these data with theoretical isochrones is not possible.
