In the adaptive case, favorable drift occurs\ntogether with favorable accumulation. We derive our results from detailed\nsimulations and a variety of analytical arguments.

Numerical results indicate that when the standard deviation\n{\\sigma}_{JS} (or {\\sigma}_{BS}) of the exchange couplings J_{i} (or the random\ntransverse fields B_{i}) is small, no long-time tail appears in the SAF. The\nspin system undergoes a crossover from a central-peak behavior to a\ncollective-mode behavior, which is the dynamical characteristics of RTIM with\nthe bimodal disorder. However, when the standard deviation is large enough, the\nsystem exhibits similar dynamics behaviors to those of the RTIM with the\nGaussian disorder, i.e., the system exhibits an enhanced central-peak behavior\nfor large {\\sigma}_{JS} or a disordered behavior for large {\\sigma}_{BS}. In\nthis instance, the long-time tails in the SAFs appear, i.e., C(t)\\simt^{-2}.\nSimilar properties are obtained when the random variables (J_{i} or B_{i})\nsatisfy other distributions such as the double-exponential distribution and the\ndouble-uniform distribution.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 5 figures"]}]
