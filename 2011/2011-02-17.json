While separation/cut\ndetection may be performed by passing messages between a node and the base in\nstatic networks, such a solution is impractical for networks with high\nmobility, since routes are constantly changing. We propose a distributed\nalgorithm to detect separation from the base station. The algorithm consists of\nan averaging scheme in which every node updates a scalar state by communicating\nwith its current neighbors. We prove that if a node is permanently disconnected\nfrom the base station, its state converges to $0$. If a node is connected to\nthe base station in an average sense, even if not connected in any instant,\nthen we show that the expected value of its state converges to a positive\nnumber. Therefore, a node can detect if it has been separated from the base\nstation by monitoring its state. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is\ndemonstrated through simulations, a real system implementation and experiments\ninvolving both static as well as mobile networks.\n"]}]

The system\ncan be modelled by a sine-Gordon equation with a piecewise-constant function to\nrepresent the varying Josephson tunneling critical current. The existence of\npinned fluxons depends on the length of the inhomogeneity, the variation in the\nJosephson tunneling critical current and the applied bias current. We establish\nthat a system may either not be able to sustain a pinned fluxon, or - for\ninstance by varying the length of the inhomogeneity - may exhibit various\ndifferent types of pinned fluxons. Our stability analysis shows that changes of\nstability can only occur at critical points of the length of the inhomogeneity\nas a function of the (Hamiltonian) energy density inside the inhomogeneity - a\nrelation we determine explicitly. In combination with continuation arguments\nand Sturm-Liouville theory, we determine the stability of all constructed\npinned fluxons. It follows that if a given system is able to sustain at least\none pinned fluxon, there is exactly one stable pinned fluxon, i.e. the system\nselects one unique stable pinned configuration. Moreover, it is shown that both\nfor microresistors and microresonators this stable pinned configuration may be\nnon-monotonic - something which is not possible in the homogeneous case.\nFinally, it is shown that results in the literature on localised\ninhomogeneities can be recovered as limits of our results on microresonators.\n"]}]

The stationary conditions arise from\nthe competition between two stochastic and biased processes of breaking and\nrecovery of the elementary resistors. The fluctuations of the network\nresistance are calculated by Monte Carlo simulations which are performed for\ndifferent values of the applied current, for networks of different size and\nshape and by considering different levels of intrinsic disorder. The\ndistribution of the resistance fluctuations generally exhibits relevant\ndeviations from Gaussianity, in particular when the current approaches the\nthreshold of electrical breakdown. For two-dimensional systems we have shown\nthat this non-Gaussianity is in general related to finite size effects, thus it\nvanishes in the thermodynamic limit, with the remarkable exception of highly\ndisordered networks. For these systems, close to the critical point of the\nconductor-insulator transition, non-Gaussianity persists in the large size\nlimit and it is well described by the universal Bramwell-Holdsworth-Pinton\ndistribution. In particular, here we analyze the role of the shape of the\nnetwork on the distribution of the resistance fluctuations. Precisely, we\nconsider quasi-one-dimensional networks elongated along the direction of the\napplied current or trasversal to it.
