The range\nof partition- ing of specific angular momentum in these systems is found to be\nlarge, spanning several orders of magnitude. The analysis shows that\nmulti-planet systems tend to have the highest values of specific angular\nmomentum normalized against the planetary masses. This suggests that in high\nangular momentum systems, the dominant contributors have already been\ndiscovered, and that single-planet sys- tems with low observed angular momentum\nmay be the most likely candidates for additional undiscovered companions\ncompared to their high angular momentum, single-planet counterparts. The\nmulti-planet system, GJ 581, is considered as a historical case study to\ndemonstrate the concept, examining how the specific angular momentum of the\nknow planetary system evolved with each discovery.\n","Comment: 17 Pages, 4 Figures"]}]

For example, even for\nsimple power-law distributions of M_T, the median value of sin(i) in an\nobserved RV sample can vary between 0.25 and 0.71 (as compared to the 0.5 value\nfor an isotropic i distribution) for indices of the power-law in the quite\nplausible range between -2 and -0.5, respectively. Over the same range of\nindicies, the 95% confidence upper bound on M_T ranges from 4.5 to 400 times\nlarger than M_T sin(i), respectively, due to sin(i) uncertainty alone. More\ncomplex, but still simple and plausible, distributions of M_T yield still more\ncomplicated and less intuitive $sin(i)$ distributions. In particular, if the\nM_T distribution contains any characteristic mass scale M_c, the sin(i)\ndistribution will depend on the ratio of M_T sin(i) to $M_c$, often in a\nnon-trivial way. Our qualitative conclusion is that RV studies of exoplanets,\nboth individual objects and statistical samples, should regard the sin(i)\nfactor as more than a \"numerical constant of order unity\" with simple and well\nunderstood statistical properties.

Implementing a non-perturbative Wigner-Weisskopf method we obtain\nthe correct \\emph{entangled} quantum state of neutrinos and charged leptons\nfrom the (two-body) decay of a parent particle. The source lifetime and\ndisentanglement length scale lead to a suppression of the oscillation\nprobabilities in short-baseline experiments. The suppression is determined by\n$\\pi\\, L_s/L_{osc}$ where $L_s$ is the \\emph{smallest} of the decay length of\nthe parent particle or the disentanglement length scale. For $L_s \\geq L_{osc}$\ncoherence and oscillations are suppressed. These effects are more prominent in\n\\emph{short base line experiments} and at low neutrino energy. We obtain the\ncorrections to the appearance and disappearance probabilities modified by both\nthe lifetime of the source and the disentanglement scale and discuss their\nimplications for accelerator and reactor experiments.

The\nexisting LRR solver is based on the alternating direction method (ADM). It\nsuffers from $O(n^3)$ computation complexity due to the matrix-matrix\nmultiplications and matrix inversions, even if partial SVD is used. Moreover,\nintroducing auxiliary variables also slows down the convergence. Such a heavy\ncomputation load prevents LRR from large scale applications. In this paper, we\ngeneralize ADM by linearizing the quadratic penalty term and allowing the\npenalty to change adaptively.

As a result, we\narrive at an algorithm for LRR with complexity $O(rn^2)$, where $r$ is the rank\nof the representation matrix.
