The formalism works by minimising the\ntotal spread of the MLWF in real space. This done in the space of unitary\nmatrices that describe rotations of the Bloch bands at each k-point. As a\nresult, Wannier90 is independent of the basis set used in the underlying\ncalculation to obtain the Bloch states.

The locality of MLWF can be\nexploited to compute band-structure, density of states and Fermi surfaces at\nmodest computational cost. Furthermore, Wannier90 is able to output MLWF for\nvisualisation and other post-processing purposes. Wannier functions are already\nused in a wide variety of applications. These include analysis of chemical\nbonding in real space; calculation of dielectric properties via the modern\ntheory of polarisation; and as an accurate and minimal basis set in the\nconstruction of model Hamiltonians for large-scale systems, in linear-scaling\nquantum Monte Carlo calculations, and for efficient computation of material\nproperties, such as the anomalous Hall coefficient.

In this\nnoisy scenario, complex networks offer a clear advantage over regular lattices,\nnamely the fact that two arbitrary nodes can be connected through a relatively\nsmall number of steps, known as the small world effect. We calculate the\nprobability that two arbitrary nodes in the network can successfully\ncommunicate with a fidelity above a given threshold.

Conventional BCS theory predicts that the\nkinetic energy of carriers increases in the transition from the normal to the\nsuperconducting state. However, substantial experimental evidence obtained in\nrecent years indicates that in at least some superconductors the opposite\noccurs. Motivated in part by these experiments many novel mechanisms of\nsuperconductivity have recently been proposed where the transition to\nsuperconductivity is associated with a lowering of the kinetic energy of the\ncarriers.

The physics can be understood\nat the level of a single electron atom: kinetic energy lowering and enhanced\ndiamagnetic susceptibility are intimately connected. According to the theory of\nhole superconductivity, superconductors expel negative charge from their\ninterior driven by kinetic energy lowering and in the process expel any\nmagnetic field lines present in their interior. Associated with this we predict\nthe existence of a macroscopic electric field in the interior of\nsuperconductors and the existence of macroscopic quantum zero-point motion in\nthe form of a spin current in the ground state of superconductors (spin\nMeissner effect).

For this purpose we have constructed two\nphenomenological models based on our previous effective Lagrangian model, which\nare able to describe kaon photoproduction from threshold up to W = 1730 MeV. By\nvarying the mass (width) of an inserted P_{11} resonance from 1620 to 1730 MeV\n(0.1 to 1 MeV and 1 to 10 MeV) a number of fits has been performed in order to\nsearch for the resonance mass. Our result indicates that the most promising\ncandidate mass (width) of this resonance is 1650 MeV (5 MeV). Although our\ncalculation does not exclude the possibility of narrow resonances with masses\nof 1680, 1700 and 1720 MeV, the mass of 1650 MeV is obtained for all\nphenomenological models used in this investigation. Variations of the resonance\nwidth and $K\\Lambda$ branching ratio are found to have a mild effect on the\nchi^2. The possibility that the obtained result originates from other resonance\nstates is also discussed.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 19 figures, submitted to Phys. Rev. D"]}]

We show that the two\nsemantics are closely related. First, we show that for a broad class of weight\nconstraint programs, called strongly satisfiable programs, the two semantics\ncoincide. When they disagree, a stable model admitted by the stable model\nsemantics may be circularly justified. We show that the gap between the two\nsemantics can be closed by transforming a weight constraint program to a\nstrongly satisfiable one, so that no circular models may be generated under the\ncurrent implementation of the stable model semantics. We further demonstrate\nthe close relationship between the two semantics by formulating a\ntransformation from weight constraint programs to logic programs with nested\nexpressions which preserves the answer set semantics. Our study on the\nsemantics leads to an investigation of a methodological issue, namely the\npossibility of compact representation of aggregate programs by weight\nconstraint programs. We show that almost all standard aggregates can be encoded\nby weight constraints compactly. This makes it possible to compute the answer\nsets of aggregate programs using the ASP solvers for weight constraint\nprograms. This approach is compared experimentally with the ones where\naggregates are handled more explicitly, which show that the weight constraint\nencoding of aggregates enables a competitive approach to answer set computation\nfor aggregate programs.\n","Comment: To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP), 2011.\n  30 pages"]}]

As an answer, we suggest that\nif the length scale at which homogeneity sets in is much smaller than the\nHubble length scale, the back-reaction due to averaging over inhomogeneities is\nnegligible. This result is supported by more than one approach to study of\naveraging in cosmology.

Kinematics is generally very favourable, with\nemission angles in a narrow angular cone and a relatively concentrated outgoing\nenergy spectrum which allows an efficient collection as a neutral gas in a tiny\nvolume with a technology at high temperatures perfected at ISOLDE. It is\nhowever of a much more general applicability. The method appears capable of\nproducing a \"table top\" storage ring with an accumulation rate in excess of\n10**14 Li-8 radioactive ion/s for possible use for radioactive beams for\nphysics studies (for example for beta-beams) or for therapy.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 11 figures"]}]
