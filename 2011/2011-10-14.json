In this paper, it is shown that the complex phases of\nthese weak conditional probabilities describe the dynamic response of the\nsystem to unitary transformations. Quantum mechanics thus unifies the\nstatistical overlap of different states with the dynamical structure of\ntransformations between these states. Specifically, it is possible to identify\nthe phase of weak conditional probabilities directly with the action of a\nunitary transform that maximizes the overlap of initial and final states. This\naction provides a quantitative measure of how much quantum correlations can\ndiverge from the deterministic relations between physical properties expected\nfrom classical physics or hidden variable theories. In terms of quantum\ninformation, the phases of weak conditional probabilities thus represent the\nlogical tension between sets of three quantum states that is at the heart of\nquantum paradoxes.\n","Comment: 16 pages, including 2 figures, added explanations on physics and\n  relevance for recent experiments, final version for publication in NJP"]}]

Regarding the\nCoulomb-interacting hole liquid, the full dependence of the zero-temperature\ndielectric function on wave vector and frequency is explored. The imaginary\npart of the dielectric function is analytically obtained in terms of\ncomplicated but fully elementary expressions, while in the result for the real\npart nonelementary one-dimensional integrations remain to be performed. The\ncorrectness of these two independent calculations is checked via Kramers-Kronig\nrelations.\n  The mass difference between heavy and light holes, along with variations in\nthe background dielectric constant, leads to dramatic alternations in the\nplasmon excitation pattern, and generically, two plasmon branches can be\nidentified. These findings are the result of the evaluation of the full\ndielectric function and are not accessible via a high-frequency expansion. In\nthe static limit a beating of Friedel oscillations between the Fermi wave\nnumbers of heavy and light holes occurs.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 11 figures included.

It\nalso provides insights into the complex solar magnetism. Variations in the mean\nstrength of the solar magnetic field lead to significant shifts in the\nfrequencies of even the lowest-degree p modes with high levels of correlation\nwith surface activity proxies. These frequency shifts are explained to arise\nfrom structural changes in the outer layers of the Sun during the 11-year\nactivity cycle, which is understood to be driven by a dynamo process. However,\nclear differences between p-mode frequencies and surface activity during the\nextended minimum of cycle 23 were observed. The origin of the p-mode\nvariability is thus far from being properly understood and a better\ncomprehension of its relationship with solar and stellar activity cycles will\nhelp us in our understanding of the dynamo processes. Spectroscopic\nmeasurements of Ca H and K emission lines revealed magnetic activity variations\nin a large sample of solar-type stars with timescales ranging from 2.5 and 25\nyears. This broad range of cycle periods is thought to reflect differences in\nthe rotational properties and the depths of the surface convection zones with\nvarious masses and ages. However, spectroscopic measurements are only good\nproxies of surface magnetic fields. The recent discovery of variations with\nmagnetic activity in the p-mode frequencies of the solar-like star HD 49933\nobserved by CoRoT, with a frequency dependence comparable in shape to the one\nobserved in the Sun, opens a new era in the study of the physical phenomena\ninvolved in the dynamo processes.

Therefore the LISA Pathfinder mission has been designed by ESA to fly\nthe LISA Technology Package (LTP), aiming at testing free-fall by measuring the\nresidual acceleration between two test-bodies in the dynamical scheme we\naddress as \"drag-free\". The spectral map of the residual acceleration as\nfunction of frequency will convey information on the local noise level, thus\nproducing a picture of the environmental working conditions for LISA itself.\n  The thesis contains abundant material on the problem of compensating static\ngravity, the development of a theory of orthogonalization of reference and\ncross-talk for the LTP experiment. The construction of the laser detection\nprocedure starting from GR and differential geometry arguments is carried on.\nEffort was put in pointing out the physical motivations for the choices made in\nseveral other papers by the author and colleagues.

The most\nimportant conclusion of the model computations is that the problem of the\nsevere degradation of large CICCs can be drastically and straightforwardly\nsolved by increasing the pitch length of subsequent cabling stages. It is for\nthe first time that an increase of the pitches is proposed and no experimental\ndata are available to confirm this outcome of the TEMLOP model. Larger pitch\nlengths will result in a more homogeneous distribution of the stresses and\nstrains in the cable by significantly moderating the local peak stresses\nassociated with the intermediate-length twist pitches. The twist pitch scheme\nof the present conductor layout turns out to be unfortunately close to a worst\ncase scenario. It is possible to improve the ITER conductor design or the\noperation margin, by mainly a change in the cabling scheme. We also find that a\nlower cable void fraction and larger strand stiffness add to a further\nimprovement of the conductor performance.\n"]}]
