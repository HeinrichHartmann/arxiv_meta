The anomaly puzzle concerns the\nquestion of whether there is a consistent way to put the R-current and the\nstress tensor in a single supercurrent, even though in the classical theory\nthey are in the same supermultiplet. As is well known, the classically\nconserved supercurrent bifurcates into two supercurrents having different\nanomalies in the quantum regime. The most interesting result we obtain is an\nexplicit expression for the lowest component of one of the two supercurrents in\n4-dimensional spacetime, namely the supercurrent that has the energy-momentum\ntensor as one of its components. This expression for the lowest component is an\nenergy-dependent linear combination of two chiral currents, which itself does\nnot correspond to a classically conserved chiral current. The lowest component\nof the other supercurrent, namely, the R-current, satisfies the Adler-Bardeen\ntheorem. The lowest component of the first supercurrent has an anomaly that we\nshow is consistent with the anomaly of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor.\nTherefore, we conclude that there is no consistent way to put the R-current and\nthe stress tensor in a single supercurrent in the quantized theory. We also\ndiscuss and try to clarify some technical points in the derivations of the\ntwo-supercurrents in the literature.

Our study serves as\na prelude to our analysis of the circular binary WDNS problem. We focus on\ncompact binaries whose total mass exceeds the maximum mass that a cold\ndegenerate star can support, and our goal is to determine the fate of such\nsystems. A fully general relativistic hydrodynamic computation of a realistic\nWDNS head-on collision is prohibitive due to the large range of dynamical time\nscales and length scales involved. For this reason, we construct an equation of\nstate (EOS) which captures the main physical features of NSs while, at the same\ntime, scales down the size of WDs. We call these scaled-down WD models\n\"pseudo-WDs (pWDs)\". Using pWDs, we can study these systems via a sequence of\nsimulations where the size of the pWD gradually increases toward the realistic\ncase. We perform two sets of simulations; One set studies the effects of the NS\nmass on the final outcome, when the pWD is kept fixed. The other set studies\nthe effect of the pWD compaction on the final outcome, when the pWD mass and\nthe NS are kept fixed. All simulations show that 14%-18% of the initial total\nrest mass escapes to infinity. All remnant masses still exceed the maximum rest\nmass that our cold EOS can support (1.92 solar masses), but no case leads to\nprompt collapse to a black hole.

All cases settle into spherical, quasiequilibrium\nconfigurations consisting of a cold NS core surrounded by a hot mantle,\nresembling Thorne-Zytkow objects.

We explore this as an alternative approach for\nconnecting large-scale dynamical mechanisms with star formation processes in\ndisk galaxies, based on burst ages derived from the Ha to far UV (FUV) flux\nratio. Images of each galaxy in Ha were taken with Taurus Tunable Filter (TTF)\nand matched to FUV imaging from GALEX. The resulting flux ratio provides a\nrobust measure of relative age across the disk which we discuss in terms of the\nlarge-scale dynamical motions. Systematic effects, such as a variable initial\nmass function (IMF), non-solar metallicities, variable star-formation history\n(SFHs), and dust attenuation, have been used to derive estimates of the\nsystematic uncertainty.\n  The resulting age maps show a wide range of patterns outside of those\ngalaxies with the strongest spiral structure, confirming the idea that star\nformation is driven one by several processes, largely determined by the\nindividual circumstances of the galaxy. Generally, grand design spirals such as\nM74, M100, and M51 exhibit age gradients across the main spiral arms, with the\nyoungest star formation regions along the central and inner edges. In M63 and\nM74 galaxy-wide trends emerge, suggesting that although most star formation is\nlocated along spiral arms, spiral density waves are not the only driver in\nthese cases. We argue that despite appearances, galaxy morphology is not an\nabsolute discriminator of the star formation history of an individual galaxy,\nnor of the processes triggering it. We conclude that Ha-to-FUV flux ratios are\na relatively direct way to probe burst ages across galaxies and infer something\nof their dynamical histories, provided that sources of systematics are properly\ntaken into account.\n","Comment: The paper contains 22 pages, 13 figures and 5 tables"]}]

Quantifying the performance of\nmulti-cell cooperation is challenging as it integrates physical-layer\ntechniques and network topologies. For tractability, existing work typically\nrelies on the over-simplified Wyner-type models. In this paper, we propose a\nnew stochastic-geometry model for a cellular network with multi-cell\ncooperation, which accounts for practical factors including the irregular\nlocations of base stations (BSs) and the resultant path-losses. In particular,\nthe proposed network-topology model has three key features: i) the cells are\nmodeled using a Poisson random tessellation generated by Poisson distributed\nBSs, ii) multi-antenna BSs are clustered using a hexagonal lattice and BSs in\nthe same cluster mitigate mutual interference by spatial interference\navoidance, iii) BSs near cluster edges access a different sub-channel from that\nby other BSs, shielding cluster-edge mobiles from strong interference. Using\nthis model and assuming sparse scattering, we analyze the shapes of the outage\nprobabilities of mobiles served by cluster-interior BSs as the average number\n$K$ of BSs per cluster increases. The outage probability of a mobile near a\ncluster center is shown to be proportional to $e^{-c(2-\\sqrt{\\nu})^2K}$ where\n$\\nu$ is the fraction of BSs lying in the interior of clusters and $c$ is a\nconstant. Moreover, the outage probability of a typical mobile is proved to\nscale proportionally with $e^{-c' (1-\\sqrt{\\nu})^2K}$ where $c'$ is a constant.\n","Comment: 5 pages"]}]

After discussing the limitations of the orthodox\napproach, we propose an alternative that appears to be quite naturally implied\nby recent developments based on D-brane physics. In this new alternative: 1)\nThe gauge group, above a scale of order 1 TeV, is the minimal left-right\nsymmetric extension $SU(3)\\times SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R\\times U(1)_{B-L}$ of the\nSM; 2) Quarks, leptons and Higgs fields come in three generations; 3) Couplings\nunify at an intermediate string scale $M_s= 9\\times 10^{11}$ GeV with boundary\nconditions $g_3^2=g_L^2=g_R^2=32/3 g_{B-L}^2$. This corresponds to the natural\nembedding of gauge interactions into D-branes and is different from the\nstandard SO(10) embedding which corresponds to $k_{B-L}=8/3$. Unification only\nworks in the case of three generations;\n  4) Proton stability is automatic due to the presence of $Z_2$ discrete\nR-parity and lepton parities. A specific Type IIB string orientifold model with\nthe above characteristics is constructed. The existence of three generations is\ndirectly related to the existence of three complex extra dimensions.\n  In this model the string scale can be identified with the intermediate scale\nand SUSY is broken also at that scale due to the presence of anti-branes in the\nvacuum.\n  We discuss a number of phenomenological issues in this model including Yukawa\ncouplings and a built-in axion solution to the strong-CP problem.

A measurement of J/\\psi production at RHIC in\nthe next run with better statistics will allow us to determine the validity of\nthe color octet model of J/\\psi production at RHIC energies.
