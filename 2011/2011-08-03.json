The resulting MC algorithm is\nformulated in terms of elastic and inelastic mean free paths, and it is by\nconstruction insensitive to the IR and UV divergences of the total elastic and\ninelastic cross sections that serve as its basic building blocks in the\nincoherent limit.

It can be used to increase\nefficiency and thus power, and to reduce possible bias. While most statistical\ntests in randomized clinical trials are nonparametric in nature, approaches for\ncovariate adjustment typically rely on specific regression models, such as the\nlinear model for a continuous outcome, the logistic regression model for a\ndichotomous outcome and the Cox model for survival time. Several recent efforts\nhave focused on model-free covariate adjustment. This paper makes use of the\nempirical likelihood method and proposes a nonparametric approach to covariate\nadjustment. A major advantage of the new approach is that it automatically\nutilizes covariate information in an optimal way without fitting nonparametric\nregression. The usual asymptotic properties, including the Wilks-type result of\nconvergence to a chi-square distribution for the empirical likelihood ratio\nbased test, and asymptotic normality for the corresponding maximum empirical\nlikelihood estimator, are established. It is also shown that the resulting test\nis asymptotically most powerful and that the estimator for the treatment effect\nachieves the semiparametric efficiency bound.

A concise mechanism for the adsorption and electro-oxidation\nof H2S on Pt anode is presented. H2S dissociatively adsorbs onto Pt as two\ndifferent sulfur species and at intermediate oxidation potentials, undergoes\nelectro-oxidation to sulfur and then to sulfur dioxide (SO2). This mechanism is\nvalidated by charge balances between hydrogen desorption and sulfur\nelectro-oxidation on Pt. The ignition potential for sulfur oxidation decreases\nwith increase in temperature, which coupled with faster electro-oxidation\nkinetics result in the easier removal of adsorbed sulfur at higher\ntemperatures. Furthermore, the adsorption potential is found to influence\nsulfur coverage of an electrode exposed to H2S.

This study takes account of the\ntwo dimensional (radial and normal) structure of the disk gas, including the\neffects of the variation in the gas velocity as a function of distance from the\nmidplane. It is shown that the dust component of disks accretes slower than the\ngas component. At high altitude from the disk midplane, the gas rotates faster\nthan particles because of the inward pressure gradient force, and its drag\nforce causes particles to move outward in the radial direction. Viscous torque\ninduces the gas within a scale height from the disk midplane to flow outward,\ncarrying small (size < 100 micron at 10 AU) particles with it. Only particles\nat intermediate altitude or with sufficiently large sizes (> 1 mm at 10 AU)\nmove inward. When the particles' radial velocities are averaged over the entire\nvertical direction, particles have a net inward flux. At large distances from\nthe central star, particles migrate inward with a velocity much faster than the\ngas accretion velocity. However, their inward velocity is reduced below that of\nthe gas in the inner regions of the disk. The rate of velocity decrease is a\nfunction of the particles' size. While larger particles retain fast accretion\nvelocity until they approach closer to the star, 10 micron particles have\nslower velocity than the gas in the most part of the disk (r < 100 AU). This\ndifferential migration of particles causes the size fractionation. Dust disks\ncomposed mostly of small particles (size < 10 micron) accrete slower than gas\ndisks, resulting in the increase in the dust-gas ratio during the gas accretion\nphase.\n","Comment: ApJ, accepted, 17 pages, 14 figures"]}]
