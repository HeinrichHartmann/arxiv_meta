We first describe the generic band\nstructure of an isolated FeAs layer. Use of its Abelian glide-mirror group\nallows us to reduce the primitive cell to one FeAs unit. From\ndensity-functional theory, we generate the set of eight Fe $d$ and As $p$\nlocalized Wannier functions for LaOFeAs and their tight-binding (TB)\nHamiltonian, $h(k)$. We discuss the topology of the bands, i.e. allowed and\navoided crossings, the origin of the d6 pseudogap, as well as the role of the\nAs $p$ orbitals and the elongation of the FeAs$_{4}$ tetrahedron. We then\ncouple the layers, mainly via interlayer hopping between As $p_{z}$ orbitals,\nand give the formalism for simple and body-centered tetragonal stackings. This\nallows us to explain the material-specific 3D band structures. Due to the high\nsymmetry, several level inversions take place as functions of $k_{z}$ or\npressure, resulting in linear band dispersions (Dirac cones). The underlying\nsymmetry elements are, however, easily broken, so that the Dirac points are not\nprotected, nor pinned to the Fermi level. From the paramagnetic TB Hamiltonian,\nwe form the band structures for spin spirals with wavevector $q$ by coupling\n$h(k)$ and $h (k+q)$. The band structure for stripe order is studied as a\nfunction of the exchange potential, $\\Delta$, using Stoner theory. Gapping of\nthe Fermi surface (FS) for small $\\Delta $ requires matching of FS dimensions\n(nesting) and $d$-orbital characters. The origin of the propeller-shaped FS is\nexplained. Finally, we express the magnetic energy as the sum over\nband-structure energies, which enables us to understand to what extent the\nmagnetic energies might be described by a Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and the\ninterplay between the magnetic moment and the elongation of the FeAs4\ntetrahedron.\n"]}]

Subsequent work by A. K.\nBousfield established the existence of these functors, using more technical\nsimplicial methods. These functors are now an essential tool in homotopy\ntheory.

In theory, criticality provides many desirable\nfeatures for the behaving brain, optimizing computational capabilities,\ninformation transmission, sensitivity to sensory stimuli and size of memory\nrepertoires. However, a thorough characterization of neuronal avalanches in\nfreely-behaving (FB) animals is still missing, thus raising doubts about their\nrelevance for brain function. To address this issue, we employed chronically\nimplanted multielectrode arrays (MEA) to record avalanches of spikes from the\ncerebral cortex (V1 and S1) and hippocampus (HP) of 14 rats, as they\nspontaneously traversed the wake-sleep cycle, explored novel objects or were\nsubjected to anesthesia (AN). We then modeled spike avalanches to evaluate the\nimpact of sparse MEA sampling on their statistics. We found that the size\ndistribution of spike avalanches are well fit by lognormal distributions in FB\nanimals, and by truncated power laws in the AN group. The FB data are also\ncharacterized by multiple key features compatible with criticality in the\ntemporal domain, such as 1/f spectra and long-term correlations as measured by\ndetrended fluctuation analysis. These signatures are very stable across waking,\nslow-wave sleep and rapid-eye-movement sleep, but collapse during anesthesia.\nLikewise, waiting time distributions obey a single scaling function during all\nnatural behavioral states, but not during anesthesia. Results are equivalent\nfor neuronal ensembles recorded from V1, S1 and HP. Altogether, the data\nprovide a comprehensive link between behavior and brain criticality, revealing\na unique scale-invariant regime of spike avalanches across all major behaviors.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 9 figures, supporting material included (published in Plos\n  One)"]}]
