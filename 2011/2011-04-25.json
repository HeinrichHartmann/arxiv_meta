The three types of\ntheories suitable for describing the hysteresis loops of MNPs are presented and\ncompared to numerical simulations: equilibrium functions, Stoner-Wohlfarth\nmodel based theories (SWMBTs) and linear response theory (LRT). Suitable\nformulas to calculate the hysteresis area of major cycles are deduced from\nSWMBTs and from numerical simulations; the domain of validity of the analytical\nformula is explicitly studied. In the case of minor cycles, the hysteresis area\ncalculations are based on the LRT. A perfect agreement between LRT and\nnumerical simulations of hysteresis loops is obtained. The domain of validity\nof the LRT is explicitly studied. Formulas to calculate the hysteresis area at\nlow field valid for any anisotropy of the MNP are proposed. Numerical\nsimulations of the magnetic field dependence of the area show it follows\npower-laws with a large range of exponents. Then, analytical expressions\nderived from LRT and SWMBTs are used for a theoretical study of magnetic\nhyperthermia. It is shown that LRT is only pertinent for MNPs with strong\nanisotropy and that SWMBTs should be used for weak anisotropy MNPs. The optimum\nvolume of MNPs for magnetic hyperthermia as function of material and\nexperimental parameters is derived. The maximum specific absorption rate (SAR)\nachievable is calculated versus the MNP anisotropy. It is shown that an optimum\nanisotropy increases the SAR and reduces the detrimental effects of size\ndistribution. The optimum anisotropy is simple to calculate and depends on the\nmagnetic field used in the hyperthermia experiments and on the MNP\nmagnetization only. The theoretical optimum parameters are compared to the one\nof several magnetic materials.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 1 table, 11 figures"]}]

In one spatial\ndimension a gluon-mediated attraction between a quark and an antiquark of\ndifferent flavors inevitably leads to formation of a colorless spin-triplet\nbound state (a vector analogue of the Cooper pair) with quantum numbers of an\nelectrically charged rho meson. Such quark-antiquark pairs condense to form an\nanisotropic inhomogeneous superconducting state similar to the Abrikosov vortex\nlattice in a type-II superconductor.

We define primitive words as words having only a trivial\nrepresentation as the power of another word. Nonprimitive words (without the\nempty word) are exactly the periodic words. Every nonempty word is a power of\nan uniquely determined primitive word which is called the root of the former\none. The set of all roots of nonempty words of a language is called the root of\nthe language. The primitive words have interesting combinatorial properties\nwhich we consider in Section 2. In Section 3 we investigate the relationship\nbetween the set $Q$ of all primitive words over some fixed alphabet and the\nlanguage classes of the Chomsky Hierarchy and the contextual languages over the\nsame alphabet. The computational complexity of the set $Q$ and of the roots of\nlanguages are considered in Section 4. The set of all powers of the same degree\nof all words from a language is the power of this language. We examine the\npowers of languages for different sets of exponents, and especially their\nregularity and context-freeness, in Section 5, and the decidability of\nappropriate questions in Section 6.
