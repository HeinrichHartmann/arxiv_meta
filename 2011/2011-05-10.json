Both techniques have\nsolid theoretical foundations based on analytical calculations as well as on\nnumerical testings. Among the two the VCS, which has been developed quite\nrecently, has two unique features. First of all, it is applicable to turbulent\nvolumes that are not spatially resolved. Second, it can be used with absorption\nlines that do not provide good spatial sampling of different lags over the\nimage of the turbulent object. In fact, recent studies show that measurements\nof absorption line along less than 10 absorption directions are sufficient for\na reliable recovering of the underlying spectrum of the turbulence. Moreover,\nboth weak absorption lines and absorption lines in saturated regime can be\nused, which extends the applicability of the technique. Our comparison of the\nVCA and the VCS with a more traditional technique of Velocity Centroids shows\nthat the former two techniques recover reliably the spectra of supersonic\nturbulence, while the Velocity Centroids may be used only for studying subsonic\nturbulence.

The main cost of many QMC methods, for example the\nvariational Monte Carlo (VMC) method, is in constructing a sequence of Slater\nmatrices and computing the ratios of determinants for successive Slater\nmatrices. Recent work has improved the scaling of constructing Slater matrices\nfor insulators so that the cost of constructing Slater matrices in these\nsystems is now linear in the number of particles, whereas computing determinant\nratios remains cubic in the number of particles. With the long term aim of\nsimulating much larger systems, we improve the scaling of computing the\ndeterminant ratios in the VMC method for simulating insulators by using\npreconditioned iterative solvers.\n  The main contribution of this paper is the development of a method to\nefficiently compute for the Slater matrices a sequence of preconditioners that\nmake the iterative solver converge rapidly. This involves cheap preconditioner\nupdates, an effective reordering strategy, and a cheap method to monitor\ninstability of ILUTP preconditioners. Using the resulting preconditioned\niterative solvers to compute determinant ratios of consecutive Slater matrices\nreduces the scaling of QMC algorithms from O(n^3) per sweep to roughly O(n^2),\nwhere n is the number of particles, and a sweep is a sequence of n steps, each\nattempting to move a distinct particle.

We examine the\noptical colors of radio-morphology subsamples and find that radio quasars with\ncore emission unresolved by FIRST (on 5\" scale) have a redder color\ndistribution than radio-quiet quasars (S_{20}<1mJy); other classes of radio\nquasars have optical color distributions similar to the radio-quiet quasars.\nThis analysis also suggests that optical colors of z<2.7 SDSS quasars are not\nstrongly (<0.1mag) biased blue.

It is a well-known planning problem, which has been studied for a\nlong time. Yet many simple properties remain unknown. This paper studies\nwhether modern SAT solvers are applicable to this puzzle. To our best\nknowledge, we are the first to translate Rubik's Cube to a SAT problem. To\nreduce the number of variables and clauses needed for the encoding, we replace\na naive approach of 6 Boolean variables to represent each color on each facelet\nwith a new approach of 3 or 2 Boolean variables. In order to be able to solve\nquickly Rubik's Cube, we replace the direct encoding of 18 turns with the layer\nencoding of 18-subtype turns based on 6-type turns. To speed up the solving\nfurther, we encode some properties of two-phase algorithm as an additional\nconstraint, and restrict some move sequences by adding some constraint clauses.\nUsing only efficient encoding cannot solve this puzzle. For this reason, we\nimprove the existing SAT solvers, and develop a new SAT solver based on\nPrecoSAT, though it is suited only for Rubik's Cube. The new SAT solver\nreplaces the lookahead solving strategy with an ALO (\\emph{at-least-one})\nsolving strategy, and decomposes the original problem into sub-problems. Each\nsub-problem is solved by PrecoSAT. The empirical results demonstrate both our\nSAT translation and new solving technique are efficient. Without the efficient\nSAT encoding and the new solving technique, Rubik's Cube will not be able to be\nsolved still by any SAT solver. Using the improved SAT solver, we can find\nalways a solution of length 20 in a reasonable time.
