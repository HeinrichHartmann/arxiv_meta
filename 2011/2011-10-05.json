We\nhave conducted a multiwavelength study of HCG7, consisting of four giant\ngalaxies: 3 spirals and 1 lenticular. We use Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nimaging to identify and characterize the young and old star cluster\npopulations. We find young massive clusters (YMC) mostly in the three spirals,\nwhile the lenticular features a large, unimodal population of globular clusters\n(GC) but no detectable clusters with ages less than ~Gyr. The spatial and\napproximate age distributions of the ~300 YMCs and ~150 GCs thus hint at a\nregular star formation history in the group over a Hubble time. While at first\nglance the HST data show the galaxies as undisturbed, our deep ground-based,\nwide-field imaging that extends the HST coverage reveals faint signatures of\nstellar material in the intra-group medium. We do not detect the intra-group\nmedium in HI or Chandra X-ray observations, signatures that would be expected\nto arise from major mergers. We find that the HI gas content of the individual\ngalaxies and the group as a whole are a third of the expected abundance. The\nappearance of quiescence is challenged by spectroscopy that reveals an intense\nionization continuum in one galaxy nucleus, and post-burst characteristics in\nanother. Our spectroscopic survey of dwarf galaxy members yields one dwarf\nelliptical in an apparent tidal feature. We therefore suggest an evolutionary\nscenario for HCG7, whereby the galaxies convert most of their available gas\ninto stars without major mergers and result in a dry merger.

A key property of NBL is that it allows\nus to apply a superposition of many input vectors to a SAT instance at the same\ntime, circumventing a key restriction and assumption in the traditional\napproach to solving SAT. By exploiting the superposition property of NBL, our\nNBL-based SAT algorithm can determine whether an instance is SAT or not in a\nsingle operation. A satisfying solution can be found by iteratively performing\nSAT check operations up to n times, where n is the number of variables in the\nSAT instance. Although this paper does not focus on the realization of an\nNBL-based SAT engine, such an engine can be conceived using analog circuits\n(wide-band amplifiers, adders and multipliers), FPGAs or ASICs.

This structure has recently arisen in the\nstudy of three-dimensional graph drawings. This paper presents the beginnings\nof a theory of track layouts. First we determine the maximum number of edges in\na $(k,t)$-track layout, and show how to colour the edges given fixed linear\norderings of the vertex colour classes. We then describe methods for the\nmanipulation of track layouts. For example, we show how to decrease the number\nof edge colours in a track layout at the expense of increasing the number of\ntracks, and vice versa. We then study the relationship between track layouts\nand other models of graph layout, namely stack and queue layouts, and geometric\nthickness. One of our principle results is that the queue-number and\ntrack-number of a graph are tied, in the sense that one is bounded by a\nfunction of the other. As corollaries we prove that acyclic chromatic number is\nbounded by both queue-number and stack-number. Finally we consider track\nlayouts of planar graphs. While it is an open problem whether planar graphs\nhave bounded track-number, we prove bounds on the track-number of outerplanar\ngraphs, and give the best known lower bound on the track-number of planar\ngraphs.\n","Comment: The paper is submitted for publication.
