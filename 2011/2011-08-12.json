It is based on kinematics of particles moving near the horizon. This\neffect arises when particles of two kinds collide near the horizon. For massive\nparticles, the first kind represents a particle with the generic energy and\nangular momentum (I call them \"usual\"). Near the horizon, such a particle has a\nvelocity almost equal to that of light in the frame that corotates with a black\nhole (the frame is static if a black hole is static). The second kind (called\n\"critical\") consists of particles with the velocity v<c near the horizon due to\nspecial relationship between the energy and angular momentum (or charge). As a\nresult, the relative velocity approaches the speed of light c, the Lorentz\nfactor grows unbound. This explanation applies both to generic rotating black\nholes and charged ones (even for radial motion of particles). If one of\ncolliding particles is massless (photon), the critical particle is\ndistinguished by the fact that its frequency is finite near the horizon. The\nexistence (or absence) of the effect is determined depending on competition of\ntwo factors - gravitational blue shift for a photon propagating towards a black\nhole and the Doppler effect due to transformation from the locally nonrotating\nframe to a comoving one.

We compare the simulation results with theoretical\npredictions proposed by Matsubara (2008) which naturally incorporate the halo\nbias and redshift-space distortions into their formalism of perturbation theory\nwith a resummation technique via the Lagrangian picture. The power spectrum and\ncorrelation function of halos obtained from Lagrangian resummation theory (LRT)\nwell agree with N-body simulation results on scales of BAOs. Especially\nnonlinear effects on the baryon acoustic peak of the halo correlation function\nare accurately explained both in real and redshift space. We find that\nnonlinearity and scale dependence of bias are fairly well reproduced by 1-loop\nLRT up to k=0.35hMpc^{-1} (z=2 and 3) within a few percent level in real space\nand up to k=0.1hMpc^{-1} (z=2) and 0.15hMpc^{-1} (z=3) in redshift space.
