Galaxy H alpha equivalent widths are compared to a broadband color\nindex to constrain the IMF. This parameter space is useful for breaking\ndegeneracies which are traditionally problematic. Age and dust corrections are\nlargely orthogonal to IMF variations. In addition the effects of metallicity\nand smooth star formation history e-folding times are small compared to IMF\nvariations. We find that for the sample as a whole the best fitting IMF slope\nabove 0.5 M_sun is Gamma = 1.4535 with a negligible random error of +/- 0.0004\nand a systematic error of +/- 0.1. Galaxies brighter than around M_r,0.1 = -20\n(including galaxies like the Milky Way which has M_r,0.1 ~ -21) are well fit by\na universal Gamma ~ 1.4 IMF, similar to Salpeter, and smooth, exponential star\nformation histories (SFH). Fainter galaxies prefer steeper IMFs and the quality\nof the fits reveal that for these galaxies a universal IMF with smooth SFHs is\nactually a poor assumption. Several sources of sample bias are ruled out as the\ncause of these luminosity dependent IMF variations. Analysis of bursting SFH\nmodels shows that an implausible coordination of burst times is required to fit\na universal IMF to the M_r,0.1 = -17 galaxies. This leads to the conclusions\nthat the IMF in low luminosity galaxies has fewer massive stars, either by\nsteeper slope or lower upper mass cutoff, and is not universal.\n","Comment: 68 pages, 22 figures, accepted to ApJ"]}]

When these experiments are performed using macro-bolometers,\nradioactive contamination near the surfaces is of particular concern. In order\nto control the effects of surface contamination, we developed a novel technique\nthat uses composite macro-bolometers to identify energy depositions that occur\nclose to the surfaces of materials immediately surrounding the detector. The\ncomposite macro-bolometer proposed and studied here consists of a main energy\nabsorber that is thermally coupled to and entirely surrounded by thin absorbers\nthat act as active shields. Surface energy depositions can be rejected by the\nanalysis of simultaneous signals in the main absorber and the shields. In this\npaper, we describe a full thermal model and experimental results for three\nprototype detectors. The detectors consist of Ge, Si, or TeO2 thin absorbers as\nactive shields, all with TeO2 crystals as main absorbers. In all cases, the\nsurface event rejection capability is clearly demonstrated. In addition,\nsimulations and preliminary results show that it is possible to detect energy\ndepositions that occurred on the shields without separate readout channels for\nthem. The energy depositions in the shields are distinguished from those in the\nmain absorber through pulse shape discrimination.

The\nkriging metamodeling technique is chosen in order to surrogate the performance\nfunctions because it allows one to genuinely quantify the surrogate error. The\nsurrogate error onto the limit-state surfaces is propagated to the failure\nprobabilities estimates in order to provide an empirical error measure.

This original refinement strategy makes it possible to\nadd several observations in the design of experiments at the same time.\nReliability and reliability sensitivity analyses are performed by means of the\nsubset simulation technique for the sake of numerical efficiency. The adaptive\nsurrogate-based strategy for reliability estimation is finally involved into a\nclassical gradient-based optimization algorithm in order to solve the RBDO\nproblem.

This raises the question of whether a similar\nintractability holds for approximate Nash equilibrium without such constraints.\nWe give evidence that the constraint of near-optimal value makes the problem\ndistinctly harder: a simple algorithm finds an optimal 1/2-approximate\nequilibrium, while finding strictly better than 1/2-approximate equilibria is\nas hard as the Hidden Clique problem. This is in contrast to the unconstrained\nproblem where more sophisticated algorithms, achieving better approximations,\nare known.\n  Unlike general Nash equilibrium, which is in PPAD, optimal (maximum value)\nNash equilibrium is NP-hard. We proceed to show that optimal Nash equilibrium\nis just one of several known NP-hard problems related to Nash equilibrium, all\nof which have approximate variants which are as hard as finding a planted\nclique.

This new theory provides a\nnatural covariant microscopic approach that includes automatically spacetime\nnonlocality and retardation, nonequilibrium phenomena, interactions among all\nnucleons and particle production. In the current version of our theory, we\nconsider $N$ extended unexcited nucleons interacting with massive neutral\nscalar ($\\sigma$) and neutral vector ($\\omega$) meson fields. The resulting\nclassical relativistic many-body equations of motion are solved numerically\nwithout further approximation for soft nucleon-nucleon collisions at $p_{\\rm\nlab}$ = 14.6, 30, 60, 100 and 200 GeV/$c$ to yield the transverse momentum\nimparted to the nucleons. For the future development of the theory, the\nisovector pseudoscalar ($\\pi^+$, $\\pi^-$, $\\pi^0$), isovector scalar\n($\\delta^+$, $\\delta^-$, $\\delta^0$), isovector vector ($\\rho^+$, $\\rho^-$,\n$\\rho^0$) and neutral pseudoscalar ($\\eta$) meson fields that are known to be\nimportant from nucleon-nucleon scattering experiments should be incorporated.\nIn addition, the effects of quantum uncertainty on the equations of motion\nshould be included by use of techniques analogous to those used by Moniz and\nSharp for nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics.\n","Comment: 6 pages, LA-UR-94-2178"]}]
