The progenitor suffered an LBV-like\noutburst just 2 yr earlier, and we propose that the dust formation is a\nconsequence of the SN blast wave overtaking that LBV-like shell. The key\nevidence for dust formation is (a) the appearance of a red/near-IR continuum\nsource fit by 1600 K graphite grains, and (b) fading of the redshifted sides of\nHe I emission lines, yielding progressively more asymmetric blueshifted lines\nas dust obscures receding material. This provides the strongest case yet for\ndust formation in any SN Ib/c. Both developments occurred between 51 and 75 d\nafter peak, while other SNe observed to form dust did so after a few hundred\ndays. Geometric considerations indicate that dust formed in the dense swept-up\nshell between the forward and reverse shocks, and not in the freely expanding\nSN ejecta. Rapid cooling leading to dust formation may have been aided by\nextremely high shell densities, as indicated by He I line ratios. The brief\nepoch of dust formation is accompanied by He II 4686 emission and enhanced\nX-ray emission. These clues suggest that the unusual dust formation in this\nobject was not due to properties of the SN itself, but instead -- like most\npeculiarities of SN 2006jc -- was a consequence of the dense environment\ncreated by an LBV-like eruption 2 yr before the SN.\n","Comment: ApJ, accepted. added some discussion and 2 figures, better title,\n  conclusions same as previous version. 12 pages, 4 color figs"]}]

To explore the effect of different\nextrapolations by hadronic interaction models we developed an ad hoc model.\nThis ad hoc model is based on the modification of the output of standard\nhadronic interaction event generators within the air shower simulation process\nand allows us to study the impact of changing interaction features on the air\nshower development. In a systematic study we demonstrate the resulting changes\nof important air shower observables and also discuss them in terms of the\npredictions of the Heitler model of air shower cascades. It is found that the\nresults of our ad hoc modifications are, to a large extend, independent of the\nchoice of the underlying hadronic interaction model.\n","Comment: submitted to PRD"]}]

Away from the particle-hole symmetric point the\ncolor superfluid phase is always spontaneously magnetized, leading to the\nformation of different color superfluid domains in systems where the total\nnumber of particles of each species is conserved.

Obtaining new set of photometric and spectroscopic\nobservations, we analysed them together with the older spectroscopic and\nphotometric data to build model of this eclipsing system with respect to\nobserved changes of O-C diagram and light curve. Methods. Reduction of new\nspectra was carried out in the IRAF and SPEFO programs. Radial velocities were\ndetermined manually using SPEFO, by CCF using the Zverko's code and from the\nprogram KOREL.

For a given amplitude of driving, there is a certain\nmaximum detuning between the two up to which the entrained solution persists.\nThe question of stability of the entrained solution is addressed. The simplest\nsituation involving three oscillators is investigated in details where the\nonset of synchronization is seen to occur through a tangent bifurcation at some\ncritical value of $K$. Immediately before the appearance of the first\nsynchronized solution, the system exhibits intermittent chaos with a typical\nscaling for the duration of the laminar phase. Under a periodic driving with an\nappropriately limited detuning, there occurs entrainment of the chaotic\nsolution.\n","Comment: 34 pages, 9 figures"]}]

The paper specifies and tests a multi-factor housing\nasset pricing model. In that model, we evaluate whether the market factor as\nwell as other measures of risk, including idiosyncratic risk, momentum, and MSA\nsize effects, have explanatory power for metropolitan-specific housing returns.\nFurther, we test the robustness of the asset pricing results to inclusion of\ncontrols for socioeconomic variables commonly represented in the house price\nliterature, including changes in employment, affordability, and foreclosure\nincidence. We find a sizable and statistically significant influence of the\nmarket factor on MSA house price returns. Moreover we show that market betas\nhave varied substantially over time. Also, results are largely robust to the\ninclusion of other explanatory variables, including standard measures of risk\nand other housing market fundamentals. Additional tests of model validity using\nthe Fama-MacBeth framework offer further strong support of a positive risk and\nreturn relationship in housing. Our findings are supportive of the application\nof a housing investment risk-return framework in explanation of variation in\nmetro-area cross-section and time-series US house price returns.
