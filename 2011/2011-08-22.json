Inspired by the power-law corrections to entropy and adopting\nthe viewpoint that gravity emerges as an entropic force, we derive modified\nNewton's law of gravitation as well as the corrections to Friedmann equations.\nIn a different approach, we obtained power-law corrected Friedmann equation by\nstarting from the first law of thermodynamics at apparent horizon of a FRW\nuniverse, and assuming that the associated entropy with apparent horizon has a\npower-law corrected relation. Our study shows a consistency between the\nobtained results of these two approaches.

A\ndistinctive feature of the suggested model is a separation of a studied flow\ninto two layers in calculating flow quantities near each step, and improving by\nthis means approximation of depth-averaged solutions of the initial\nthree-dimensional Euler equations. We are solving the shallow-water equations\nfor one layer, introducing the fictitious lower layer only as an auxiliary\nstructure in setting up the appropriate Riemann problems for the upper layer.\nBesides quasi-two-layer approach leads to appearance of additional terms in\none-layer finite-difference representation of balance equations.

Since the 1970's, the physics of optical caustics has been\ndeveloped to a very high degree of mathematical sophistication using\ncatastrophe theory. That kind of quantitative application of catastrophe theory\nhas not previously been applied to folding nor have the points of similarity\nwith optics been identified or exploited.\n  A putative underlying physical link between caustics and folding is a torsion\nwave of non-constant wave speed, propagating on the dihedral angles and $\\Psi$\nfound in an analytical model of the molecule.\n  Regardless of whether we have correctly identified an underlying link, the\nanalogy between caustic formation and folding is strong and the parallels (and\ndifferences) in the physics are useful.\n","Comment: 14 pages (pdf file)"]}]

The best\nknown exponent is 2.376, due to Coppersmith and Winograd. Many attempts to\nsolve this problems in the literature work by solving, fixed-size problems and\nthen apply the solution recursively. This leads to pure combinatorial\noptimisation problems with fixed size. These problems are unlikely to be\nsolvable in polynomial time.\n  In 1976 Laderman published a method to multiply two 3x3 matrices using only\n23 multiplications. This result is non-commutative, and therefore can be\napplied recursively to smaller sub-matrices. In 35 years nobody was able to do\nbetter and it remains an open problem if this can be done with 22\nmultiplications. We proceed by solving the so called Brent equations [7]. We\nhave implemented a method to converting this very hard problem to a SAT\nproblem, and we have attempted to solve it, with our portfolio of some 500 SAT\nsolvers. With this new method we were able to produce new solutions to the\nLaderman's problem. We present a new fully general non-commutative solution\nwith 23 multiplications and show that this solution is new and is NOT an\nequivalent variant of the Laderman's original solution. This result\ndemonstrates that the space of solutions to Laderman's problem is larger than\nexpected, and therefore it becomes now more plausible that a solution with 22\nmultiplications exists. If it exists, we might be able to find it soon just by\nrunning our algorithms longer, or due to further improvements in the SAT solver\nalgorithms.\n","Comment: This work was supported by the UK Technology Strategy Board under\n  Project No: 9626-58525"]}]

The coherences of the reduced state of the central system written in\nthe preferential energy eigenbasis are quantum Loschmidt echoes, which in the\nstrong coupling regime are characterized at long times scales by fluctuations\naround a constant mean value. We show that due to the chaotic dynamics of the\nenvironment, the mean value and the width of the Loschmidt echo fluctuations\nare inversely proportional to the quantity we define as the effective Hilbert\nspace dimension of the environment, which in general is smaller than the\ndimension of the entire available Hilbert space. Nevertheless, in the\nsemiclassical regime this effective Hilbert space dimension is in general\nlarge, in which case even a chaotic environment with few degrees of freedom\nproduces decoherence without revivals. Moreover we show that in this regime the\nenvironment leads the central system to equilibrate to the time average of its\nreduced density matrix, which corresponds to a diagonal state in the\npreferential energy eigenbasis. For the case of two uncoupled, initially\nentangled central systems that interact with identical local quantum\nenvironments with chaotic underlying classical dynamics, we show that in the\nsemiclassical limit the equilibration state is arbitrarily close to a separable\nstate. We confirm our results with numerical simulations in which the\nenvironment is modeled by the quantum kicked rotor in the chaotic regime.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 5 figures"]}]

Finding community structure is one of fundamental problems in\nnetwork science. Since Newman's suggestion of using \\emph{modularity} as a\nmeasure to qualify the goodness of community structures, many efficient methods\nto maximize modularity have been proposed but without a guarantee of\noptimality. In this paper, we propose two polynomial-time algorithms to the\nmodularity maximization problem with theoretical performance guarantees.

Despite being mainly of\ntheoretical interest, to our best knowledge, this is the first approximation\nalgorithm for finding community structure in networks. In our second algorithm,\nwe propose a \\emph{sparse metric}, a substantially faster linear programming\nmethod for maximizing modularity and apply a rounding technique based on this\nsparse metric with a \\emph{posteriori approximation guarantee}. Our experiments\nshow that the rounding algorithm returns the optimal solutions in most cases\nand are very scalable, that is, it can run on a network of a few thousand nodes\nwhereas the LP solution in the literature only ran on a network of at most 235\nnodes.\n"]}]
