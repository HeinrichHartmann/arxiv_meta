On the gauge theory side, Reggeon exchange is described as\nquark-antiquark exchange in the t channel between fast projectiles. The\ncorresponding amplitude is represented in terms of Wilson loops running along\nthe trajectories of the constituent quarks and antiquarks. The paths of the\nexchanged fermions are integrated over, while the \"spectator\" fermions are\ndealt with in an eikonal approximation. On the gravity side, we follow a\npreviously proposed approach, and we evaluate the Wilson-loop expectation value\nby making use of gauge/gravity duality for a generic confining gauge theory.\nThe amplitude is obtained in a saddle-point approximation through the\ndetermination near the confining horizon of a Euclidean \"minimal surface with\nfloating boundaries\", i.e., by fixing the trajectories of the exchanged quark\nand antiquark by means of a minimisation procedure, which involves both area\nand length terms. After discussing, as a warm-up exercise, a simpler problem on\na plane involving a soap film with floating boundaries, we solve the\nvariational problem relevant to Reggeon exchange, in which the basic geometry\nis that of a helicoid. A compact expression for the Reggeon-exchange amplitude,\nincluding the effects of a small fermion mass, is then obtained through\nanalytic continuation from Euclidean to Minkowski space-time. We find in\nparticular a linear Regge trajectory, corresponding to a Regge-pole singularity\nsupplemented by a logarithmic cut induced by the non-zero quark mass. The\nanalytic continuation leads also to companion contributions, corresponding to\nthe convolution of the same Reggeon-exchange amplitude with multiple elastic\nrescattering interactions between the colliding mesons.\n","Comment: 60+1 pages, 14 figures"]}]

The second\nbranch asymptotically approaches to the range of Psw=4.8 nPa under very strong\nnegative Bz and it is associated with a regime of the Bz influence saturation.\nWe suggest that the saturation is caused by relatively high contribution of the\nmagnetosphere thermal pressure into the pressure balance on the magnetopause.\nThe intermediate region of the boundary for the moderate negative and small\npositive IMF Bz can be well approximated by a hyperbolic tangent function.

Near OPERA energies both an energy-independent velocity, as well as\na linear energy dependence with an offset that is comparable in value to the\nobserved {\\delta}v by OPERA at 28.1 GeV works very well.

In\nother words, the observed variation with size retains the inherent trait of\nintensive properties in the form of size-independent staircase plateaus.

The\nfirst part is also an overview but on a restricted subject : the link between\nstatistics and Fourier, from Legendre and the role of l^2 to Donoho and the\nrole of l^1. The third part starts from a theorem of Cand\\`es, Romberg and Tao\non compressive sampling and applies the basic idea to a quite different\nquestion : the reconstruction of a function whose unknown spectrum has large\ngaps from Its restriction to an interval. The description and extention of the\nmethod of Cand\\`es, Romberg and Tao in Appendix 2 was developed later in a note\naux Comptes rendus and an article submitted to Annales de l'Institut Fourier.\n"]}]

For the last thirty years, most of the studies on the relaxation of\nstressed magnetic fields in the solar environment have onlyconsidered the\nLorentz force, neglecting plasma contributions, and therefore, limiting every\nequilibrium to that of a force-free field. Aims. Here we begin a study of the\nnon-resistive evolution of finite beta plasmas and their relaxation to\nmagnetohydrostatic states, where magnetic forces are balanced by\nplasma-pressure gradients, by using a simple 2D scenario involving a\nhydromagnetic disturbance to a uniform magnetic field. The final equilibrium\nstate is predicted as a function of the initial disturbances, with aims to\ndemonstrate what happens to the plasma during the relaxation process and to see\nwhat effects it has on the final equilibrium state. Methods. A set of numerical\nexperiments are run using a full MHD code, with the relaxation driven by\nmagnetoacoustic waves damped by viscous effects. The numerical results are\ncompared with analytical calculations made within the linear regime, in which\nthe whole process must remain adiabatic. Particular attention is paid to the\nthermodynamic behaviour of the plasma during the relaxation. Results. The\nanalytical predictions for the final non force-free equilibrium depend only on\nthe initial perturbations and the total pressure of the system.

The\nelectrical transport measurements performed in a wide range of temperature\n(3K-700K) to understand the interactions of electrons with phonon, magnon and\nsurface when the electron mean free path is limited by the dimension of these\nnanostructures. The measurements were performed in the wide range of\ntemperature to encompass and study the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase\ntransition in case of magnetic nanowires. We observed systematic scaling of\nthese interactions and the characteristic temperatures such as the Debye\ntemperature(\\theta_R) and Curie temperature(T_C) as a function of diameter.

However in\nmany instruments the strings are not made of steel, nor are the strings easily\naccessible on both sides. In this work it is shown that string positions can be\nmeasured by inexpensive optical reflection sensors which neither require\nmetallic strings nor obtrusive access. We have demonstrated a versatile and\nnon-invasive technique for measuring the position of a vibrating string in a 1\nmm^2 area with an accuracy of tens of microns for thin strings, and better than\n0.1 mm for thick ones.\n","Comment: More work needs to be done on nonlinearities before this becomes a\n  useful device"]}]

For an\narbitrary such channel, we give multi-letter characterizations of two different\ntwo-dimensional capacity regions. The first region is comprised of the rates at\nwhich it is possible for one sender to send classical information, while the\nother sends quantum information. The second region consists of the rates at\nwhich each sender can send quantum information.
