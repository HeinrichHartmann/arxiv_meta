There exists an optimal concentration at\nwhich the minimum amount of DNA is ejected from the virus. At lower or higher\nconcentrations, more DNA is ejected from the capsid.

Results: Although the two considered thermonuclear\nsupernova explosion scenarios are expected to produce almost identical\nelectromagnetic output, their neutrino signatures appear vastly different,\nwhich allow an unambiguous identification of the explosion mechanism: a pure\ndeflagration produces a single peak in the neutrino light curve, while the\naddition of the second maximum characterizes a delayed-detonation. We\nidentified the following main contributors to the neutrino signal: (1) weak\nelectron neutrino emission from electron captures (in particular on the protons\nCo55 and Ni56) and numerous beta-active nuclei produced by the thermonuclear\nflame and/or detonation front, (2) electron antineutrinos from positron\ncaptures on neutrons, and (3) the thermal emission from pair annihilation.

Our approach begins by employing the\ntheory of stratification to find optimal node weights, for a given estimation\nproblem, under an independence sampler. While optimal under independence\nsampling, these weights may be impractical under graph crawling due to\nconstraints arising from the structure of the graph.

The processes by which gravitational\nenergy is converted into turbulent and magnetic energies, however, remain\npoorly understood. Here, we show with high-resolution, adaptive-mesh\nsimulations that MHD turbulence is efficiently driven by extracting energy from\nthe gravitational potential during the collapse of a dense gas cloud.\nCompressible motions generated during the contraction are converted into\nsolenoidal, turbulent motions, leading to a natural energy ratio of E_sol/E_tot\nof approximately 2/3. We find that the energy injection scale of gravity-driven\nturbulence is close to the local Jeans scale. If small seeds of the magnetic\nfield are present, they are amplified exponentially fast via the small-scale\ndynamo process. The magnetic field grows most efficiently on the smallest\nscales, for which the stretching, twisting, and folding of field lines, and the\nturbulent vortices are sufficiently resolved. We find that this scale\ncorresponds to about 30 grid cells in the simulations. We thus suggest a new\nminimum resolution criterion of 30 cells per Jeans length in\n(magneto)hydrodynamical simulations of self-gravitating gas, in order to\nresolve turbulence on the Jeans scale, and to capture minimum dynamo\namplification of the magnetic field.

However in\npractice the delta-hedging strategy is widely used and its potential\nshortcoming in models with jumps is disregarded since such models are typically\nincomplete and hence most contingent claims are non-attainable. In this note we\ninvestigate a complete model with jumps where the delta-hedging strategy is\nwell-defined for regular payoff functions and is uniquely determined via the\nrisk-neutral measure. In this setting we give examples of (admissible)\ndelta-hedging strategies with bounded discounted value processes, which\nnevertheless fail to replicate the respective bounded contingent claims.

The\nstatistical moments of the solutions to a given BVP on each of the M\nultra-sparse meshes provide insight into identifying highly accurate\nnon-uniform meshes. Essentially, we use the pointwise mean and variance of the\ncoarse-grid solutions to construct a mapping Q(x) from uniformly to\nnon-uniformly spaced mesh-points. The error convergence properties of the\napproximate solution to the PDE-BVP on the non-uniform mesh are superior to a\nuniform mesh for a certain class of BVP's. In particular, the method works well\nfor BVP's with locally non-smooth solutions. We present a framework for\nstudying the sampled sparse-mesh solutions and provide numerical evidence for\nthe utility of this approach as applied to a set of example BVP's.

However images will never support a\ncomplete representation of the reality. Three-dimensional representations will\nnot change that. Images are primarily a spatial representation of our world\ndedicated to our sight. Key aspects such as energy and the associated forces\nare not spatially materialized. In classical physics, interaction description\nis based on Newton equations with trajectory and force as the dual central\nconcepts. Images can in real time show all aspects of trajectories but not the\nassociated dynamical aspects described by forces and energies. Contrary to the\nreal world, the world of images opposes no constrain, nor resistance to our\nactions. Only the physical quantities, that do not contain mass in their\ndimension can be satisfactory represented by images. Often symbols such as\narrows are introduced to visualize the force vectors.\n"]}]

The\nSDRE methodology is applicable on special forms of nonlinear systems where\nsatellite model is one of the candidates. It is not easy to find an analytical\nsolution from the SDRE. Thus point wise solutions are interpolated with respect\nto the operating conditions. The point wise solutions are obtained from the\nMATLAB algorithms which are derived from the positive definite solutions of the\nSDRE. The global stability analysis is difficult due to the nature of the\nmethodology. The resultant attitude controllers outside the breakpoints (the\nselected operating conditions for interpolation) are suboptimal. The\nperformance of the designs is examined by simulations on MATLAB - Simulink\nenvironment.

The QSHE\nrequires an energy gap in the bulk and gapless edge modes that conduct spin-up\nand spin-down excitations in opposite directions. When the number of Kramers\npairs of edge modes is odd, certain one-particle scattering processes are\nforbidden due to a topological $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ index.

For a single Kramers pair the QSHE is stable to weak\ninteractions and disorder, while for two Kramers pairs it is not; however, the\ntwo-pair case can be stabilized by {\\it either} finite attractive or repulsive\ninteractions. For the simplest case of a single pair of edge modes, it is shown\nthat changing the screening length in an edge with screened Coulomb\ninteractions can be used to drive a phase transition between the QSHE state and\nthe ordinary insulator.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 2 figures"]}]
