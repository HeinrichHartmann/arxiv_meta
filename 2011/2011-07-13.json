(I): The effective theory of inflation a la\nGinsburg-Landau (GL): the inflaton potential is a polynomial with universal\nform making explicit the inflation energy scale M, the Planck mass and the\ninflation e-folds number N ~ 60. The slow-roll expansion becomes a systematic\n1/N expansion and the inflaton couplings are naturally small as powers of\n(M/M_{Pl})^2. The spectral index (n_s - 1) and the ratio of tensor/scalar\nfluctuations r are O(1/N), the running index is O(1/N^2). M ~ 0.7 10^{16} GeV\nis completely determined by the scalar adiabatic fluctuations amplitude. (II):\nA Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) analysis of the CMB+LSS data (including\nWMAP5) with our analytic theoretical results yields: a lower bound for r (new\ninflation): r > 0.023 (95%CL), r > 0.046 (68%CL); the preferred inflation\npotential is a double well, even function of the field yielding as most\nprobable values n_s ~ 0.964, r ~ 0.051. This value for r is within reach of\nforthcoming CMB observations. Slow-roll inflation is generically preceded by a\nshort fast-roll stage which leads to a suppression of the CMB quadrupoles. MCMC\nanalysis of the WMAP+SDSS data shows that fast-roll fits the TT, TE and EE\nmodes well reproducing the quadrupole suppression and fixes the total number of\nefolds of inflation to be N_{total} ~ 64.

Hence, one has to recur the results of data races to\ndeterministically replay a multi-threaded program. However, data races are\nconcealed in enormous number of memory operations in a program. Due to the\ndifficulty of accurately identifying data races, previous multi-threaded\ndeterministic record/replay schemes for commodity multi-processor system give\nup to record data races directly. Consequently, they either record all shared\nmemory operations, which brings remarkable slowdown to the production run, or\nrecord the synchronization only, which introduces significant efforts to\nreplay.\n  Inspired by the advances in data race detection, we propose an efficient\nsoftware-only deterministic replay scheme for commodity multi-processor\nsystems, which is named RacX.

As a result,\nRacX can efficiently monitor all potential data races to deterministically\nreplay a multi-threaded program.\n  To evaluate RacX, we have carried out experiments over a number of well-known\nmulti-threaded programs from SPLASH-2 benchmark suite and large-scale\ncommercial programs.

Here, we review the theory and observations of cluster\ndisruption, both the suggested initial rapid dissolution phase (infant\nmortality) and the longer timescale processes that affect clusters after they\nemerge from their progenitor GMCs. Over the past decade, the standard paradigm\nthat has developed is that all/most stars are formed in clusters and that the\nvast majority of these groups are disrupted over short timescales (< 10 Myr).\nThis is thought to be due to the removal of the left over gas from the\nstar-formation process, known as infant mortality. However, recent results have\nsuggested that the fraction of stars that form in clusters has been\noverestimated, with the majority being formed in unbound groups (i.e.\nassociations) which expand and disrupt without the need of invoking gas\nremoval. Dynamical measurements of young massive clusters in the Galaxy suggest\nthat clusters reach a stable equilibrium at very young (<3 Myr) ages,\nsuggesting that gas expulsion has little effect on the cluster. After the early\ndynamical phase, clusters appear to be long lived and stable objects. We use\nthe recent WFC3 image of the cluster population in M83 to test empirical\ndisruption laws and find that the lifetime of clusters strongly depends on\ntheir ambient environment. While the role of cluster mass is less well\nconstrained (due to the added parameter of the form of the cluster mass\nfunction), we find evidence suggesting that higher mass clusters survive\nlonger, and that the cluster mass function (at least in M83, outside the\nnuclear region) is truncated above ~10^5Msun.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 6 Figures, invited review for the proceedings of \"Stellar\n  Clusters and Associations - A RIA workshop on GAIA\", 23-27 May 2011, Granada,\n  Spain"]}]

Hence, it predicts the\nexistence of an intrinsic magnetic moment for the electron and gives its\ncorrect value. In the scale relativity framework, the Schrodinger, Klein-Gordon\nand Dirac equations have been derived from first principles as geodesics\nequations of a non-differentiable and continuous spacetime. Since such a\ngeneralized geometry implies the occurence of new discrete symmetry breakings,\nthis has led us to write Dirac bi-spinors in the form of bi-quaternions\n(complex quaternions). In the present work, we show that, in scale relativity\nalso, the correct Pauli equation can only be obtained from a non-relativistic\nlimit of the relativistic geodesics equation (which, after integration, becomes\nthe Dirac equation) and not from the non-relativistic formalism (that involves\nsymmetry breakings in a fractal 3-space). The same degeneracy procedure, when\nit is applied to the bi-quaternionic 4-velocity used to derive the Dirac\nequation, naturally yields a Pauli-type quaternionic 3-velocity. It therefore\ncorroborates the relevance of the scale relativity approach for the building\nfrom first principles of the quantum postulates and of the quantum tools. This\nalso reinforces the relativistic and fundamentally quantum nature of spin,\nwhich we attribute in scale relativity to the non-differentiability of the\nquantum spacetime geometry (and not only of the quantum space).
