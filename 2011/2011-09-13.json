While the attractive Hubbard\nmodel can be regarded as the generalization of BCS to Bose Einstein\ncondensation (BEC) crossover to a lattice, we find that the BEC limit of this\nHubbard model is very different from that of jellium, owing to the strong\ninter-site repulsion between pairs, which becomes important near half filling\nwhen the on-site attraction is strong.

A\nnonlinear tracking controller is developed on the special Euclidean group $\\SE$\nfor each flight mode, and the closed loop is shown to have desirable closed\nloop properties that are almost global in each case.

Theoretical models also vary, suggesting that the absence or\npresence of the nodes depends quantitatively on the model parameters. An\nopinion that has gained substantial currency is that the gap structure, unlike\nall other known superconductors, including cuprates, may be different in\ndifferent compounds within the same family. A unique method for addressing this\nissue, one of the very few methods that are bulk and angle-resolved, calls for\nmeasuring the electronic specific heat in a rotating magnetic field, as a\nfunction of field orientation with respect to the crystallographic axes.

In particular, we specify the density at z of critical clusters\nconditioned to touch either or both vertical sides of the rectangle, with these\nsides 'wired,' i.e. constrained to be in a single cluster, and the horizontal\nsides free. These quantities probe the structure of various cluster\nconfigurations, including those that contribute to the crossing probability.\n  We first examine the effects of boundary conditions on C for the critical\nO(n) loop models in both high and low density phases and for both\nFortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) and spin clusters in the critical Q-state Potts models.\nA Coulomb gas analysis then allows us to calculate the cluster densities with\nvarious conditionings in terms of the known conformal blocks.

A diagnostic policy is a complete description of the decision-making\nactions of a diagnostician (i.e., tests followed by a diagnostic decision) for\nall possible combinations of test results. An optimal diagnostic policy is one\nthat minimizes the expected total cost, which is the sum of measurement costs\nand misdiagnosis costs. In most diagnostic settings, there is a tradeoff\nbetween these two kinds of costs. This paper formalizes diagnostic decision\nmaking as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The paper introduces a new family of\nsystematic search algorithms based on the AO* algorithm to solve this MDP. To\nmake AO* efficient, the paper describes an admissible heuristic that enables\nAO* to prune large parts of the search space. The paper also introduces several\ngreedy algorithms including some improvements over previously-published\nmethods. The paper then addresses the question of learning diagnostic policies\nfrom examples. When the probabilities of diseases and test results are computed\nfrom training data, there is a great danger of overfitting. To reduce\noverfitting, regularizers are integrated into the search algorithms. Finally,\nthe paper compares the proposed methods on five benchmark diagnostic data sets.\nThe studies show that in most cases the systematic search methods produce\nbetter diagnostic policies than the greedy methods.

Despite their promise, current BDI team\napproaches lack tools for quantitative performance analysis under uncertainty.\nDistributed partially observable Markov decision problems (POMDPs) are well\nsuited for such analysis, but the complexity of finding optimal policies in\nsuch models is highly intractable. The key contribution of this article is a\nhybrid BDI-POMDP approach, where BDI team plans are exploited to improve POMDP\ntractability and POMDP analysis improves BDI team plan performance. Concretely,\nwe focus on role allocation, a fundamental problem in BDI teams: which agents\nto allocate to the different roles in the team. The article provides three key\ncontributions. First, we describe a role allocation technique that takes into\naccount future uncertainties in the domain; prior work in multiagent role\nallocation has failed to address such uncertainties. To that end, we introduce\nRMTDP (Role-based Markov Team Decision Problem), a new distributed POMDP model\nfor analysis of role allocations. Our technique gains in tractability by\nsignificantly curtailing RMTDP policy search; in particular, BDI team plans\nprovide incomplete RMTDP policies, and the RMTDP policy search fills the gaps\nin such incomplete policies by searching for the best role allocation. Our\nsecond key contribution is a novel decomposition technique to further improve\nRMTDP policy search efficiency. Even though limited to searching role\nallocations, there are still combinatorially many role allocations, and\nevaluating each in RMTDP to identify the best is extremely difficult. Our\ndecomposition technique exploits the structure in the BDI team plans to\nsignificantly prune the search space of role allocations. Our third key\ncontribution is a significantly faster policy evaluation algorithm suited for\nour BDI-POMDP hybrid approach. Finally, we also present experimental results\nfrom two domains: mission rehearsal simulation and RoboCupRescue disaster\nrescue simulation.\n"]}]

The solutions map belief states to\nactions. Models of other agents may include their belief states and are related\nto agent types considered in games of incomplete information.

In many domains, the performance of a planner can greatly\nbe improved by discovering and exploiting information about the domain\nstructure that is not explicitly encoded in the initial PDDL formulation.

Traditionally, a fixed\nEulerian mesh is often employed for this purpose, which in modern schemes may\nalso be adaptively refined during a calculation. Particle-based methods on the\nother hand discretize the mass instead of the volume, yielding an approximately\nLagrangian approach. It is also possible to achieve Lagrangian behavior in\nmesh-based methods if the mesh is allowed to move with the flow. However, such\napproaches have often been fraught with substantial problems related to the\ndevelopment of irregularity in the mesh topology. Here we describe a novel\nscheme that eliminates these weaknesses. It is based on a moving unstructured\nmesh defined by the Voronoi tessellation of a set of discrete points. The mesh\nis used to solve the hyperbolic conservation laws of ideal hydrodynamics with a\nfinite volume approach, based on a second-order Godunov scheme with an exact\nRiemann solver. A particularly powerful feature of the approach is that the\nmesh-generating points can in principle be moved arbitrarily. If they are given\nthe velocity of the local flow, a highly accurate Lagrangian formulation of\ncontinuum hydrodynamics is obtained that is free of mesh distortion problems,\nwhile it is at the same time fully Galilean-invariant, unlike ordinary Eulerian\ncodes.

A generalization of Ojima tilde\nconjugation rules is suggested, which reveals the properties of coherent state\nfor SU(2) group for the fermionic thermal vacuum state and is useful for the\nthermofield bosonization. The notions of \"hot\" and \"cold\" thermofields are\nintroduced to distinguish different thermofield representations giving the\ncorrect normal form of thermofield solution. The weak sense of definition of\nzero and finite temperature operator bosonization rules in the framework of\nthermofield dynamics is demonstrated.\n","Comment: 53 pages"]}]

We consider these questions\nin the context of the job-shop scheduling problem (JSP), a domain where tabu\nsearch algorithms have been shown to be remarkably effective. Previously, we\ndemonstrated that the mean distance between random local optima and the nearest\noptimal solution is highly correlated with problem difficulty for a well-known\ntabu search algorithm for the JSP introduced by Taillard. In this paper, we\ndiscuss various shortcomings of this measure and develop a new model of problem\ndifficulty that corrects these deficiencies. We show that Taillards algorithm\ncan be modeled with high fidelity as a simple variant of a straightforward\nrandom walk. The random walk model accounts for nearly all of the variability\nin the cost required to locate both optimal and sub-optimal solutions to random\nJSPs, and provides an explanation for differences in the difficulty of random\nversus structured JSPs. Finally, we discuss and empirically substantiate two\nnovel predictions regarding tabu search algorithm behavior. First, the method\nfor constructing the initial solution is highly unlikely to impact the\nperformance of tabu search. Second, tabu tenure should be selected to be as\nsmall as possible while simultaneously avoiding search stagnation; values\nlarger than necessary lead to significant degradations in performance.\n"]}]

In decision-theoretic planning, where many desirable behaviours are\nmore naturally expressed as properties of execution sequences rather than as\nproperties of states, NMRDPs form a more natural model than the commonly\nadopted fully Markovian decision process (MDP) model. While the more tractable\nsolution methods developed for MDPs do not directly apply in the presence of\nnon-Markovian rewards, a number of solution methods for NMRDPs have been\nproposed in the literature.

When the length of\nfrequent itemsets to be found is large, the traditional algorithms find all the\nfrequent itemsets from 1-length to n-length, which is a difficult process. This\nproblem can be solved by mining only the Maximal Frequent Itemsets (MFS).\nMaximal Frequent Itemsets are frequent itemsets which have no proper frequent\nsuperset. Thus, the generation of only maximal frequent itemsets reduces the\nnumber of itemsets and also time needed for the generation of all frequent\nitemsets as each maximal itemset of length m implies the presence of 2m-2\nfrequent itemsets. Furthermore, mining only maximal frequent itemset is\nsufficient in many data mining applications like minimal key discovery and\ntheory extraction.

An intuitive\nextension of this formalism is communicating ASP, in which multiple ASP\nprograms collaborate to solve the problem at hand. However, the expressiveness\nof communicating ASP has not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we present\na systematic study of the additional expressiveness offered by allowing ASP\nprograms to communicate. First, we consider a simple form of communication\nwhere programs are only allowed to ask questions to each other. For the most\npart, we deliberately only consider simple programs, i.e. programs for which\ncomputing the answer sets is in P. We find that the problem of deciding whether\na literal is in some answer set of a communicating ASP program using simple\ncommunication is NP-hard. In other words: we move up a step in the polynomial\nhierarchy due to the ability of these simple ASP programs to communicate and\ncollaborate. Second, we modify the communication mechanism to also allow us to\nfocus on a sequence of communicating programs, where each program in the\nsequence may successively remove some of the remaining models. This mimics a\nnetwork of leaders, where the first leader has the first say and may remove\nmodels that he or she finds unsatisfactory. Using this particular communication\nmechanism allows us to capture the entire polynomial hierarchy. This means, in\nparticular, that communicating ASP could be used to solve problems that are\nabove the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, such as some forms of\nabductive reasoning as well as PSPACE-complete problems such as STRIPS\nplanning.\n","Comment: 35 pages.

This involves\nconstructing a variational problem that searches over all disturbances of fixed\ninitial amplitude, which respect the boundary conditions, incompressibility and\nthe Navier--Stokes equations, to maximise a chosen functional over an\nasymptotically long time period. The functional must be selected such that it\nidentifies turbulent velocity fields by taking significantly enhanced values\ncompared to those for laminar fields. We illustrate this approach using the\nratio of the final to initial perturbation kinetic energies (energy growth) as\nthe functional and the energy norm to measure amplitudes in the context of pipe\nflow. Our results indicate that the variational problem yields a smooth\nconverged solution providing the amplitude is below the threshold amplitude for\ntransition. This optimal is the nonlinear analogue of the well-studied (linear)\ntransient growth optimal. At and above this threshold, the optimising search\nnaturally seeks out disturbances that trigger turbulence by the end of the\nperiod, and convergence is then practically impossible. The first disturbance\nfound to trigger turbulence as the amplitude is increased identifies the\n`minimal seed' for the given geometry and forcing (Reynolds number). We\nconjecture that it may be possible to select a functional such that the\nconverged optimal below threshold smoothly converges to the minimal seed at\nthreshold.

The mass distribution of Super-Earths and Neptune-mass planets (SEN)\nis strongly increasing between 30 and 15M-Earth. The SEN occurence rate does\nnot exhibit a preference for metal rich stars. Most of the SEN planets belong\nto multi-planetary systems. The orbital eccentricities of the SEN planets seems\nlimited to 0.45. At the opposite, the occurence rate of gaseous giant planets\nis growing with the logarithm of the period, and is strongly increasing with\nthe host-star metallicity. About 14% of solar-type stars have a planetary\ncompanion more massive than 50M-Earth? on an orbit with a period shorter than\n10 years. Orbital eccentricities of giant planets are observed up to 0.9 and\nbeyond. The precision of HARPS-type spectrographs opens the possibility to\ndetect planets in the habitable zone of solar-type stars. Identification of a\nsignificant number of super-Earths orbiting solar-type of the Sun vicinity is\nachieved by Doppler spectroscopy. 37 newly discovered planets are announced in\nthe Appendix of this paper, among which 15 Super-Earths.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 18 figures, and many tables, submitted to A&A"]}]

The core ingredient\nof the proposal is a deformation of Lorentz transformations in which also the\nPlanck scale $E_p$ (in addition to the speed-of-light scale $c$) is described\nas an invariant. Just like the introduction of the invariant $c$ requires a\ndeformation of the Galileian transformations into the Lorentz transformations,\nthe introduction of the invariant $E_p$ requires a deformation of the Lorentz\ntransformations, but there is no special class of inertial observers. The\nPierre Auger Observatory and the GLAST space telescope should play a key role\nin future developments of these investigations.

This work extends a previous heuristic modification of\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger dynamics based on discrete time intervals with an intrinsic\nuncertainty. The extension uses unital semigroup representations of space and\ntime translations rather than the more usual unitary representation, and does\nthe least violence to physically important invariance principles. Physical\nconsequences include a modification of the uncertainty principle and a\nmodification of field dispersion relations, in a way consistent with other\nmodifications suggested by quantum gravity and string theory .\n","Comment: This paper generalises an earlier model published as Phys.

This conviction is\nbased on the belief that the higher order contributions from the ``extension\nsector'' will be numerically small. However, the structure of higher order\ncorrections can be quite different when comparing the SM with its extension,\nthus one should avoid assumptions which do not care about such facts. This is\nthe case for all models with $\\rho_{\\rm tree} \\equiv\nM_W^2/(M_{Z}^2\\cos^2{\\Theta_W}) \\neq 1$. As an example, both the manifest\nleft-right symmetric model and the $SU(2)_L \\otimes U(1)_Y \\otimes\n\\tilde{U}(1)$ model, with an additional $Z'$ boson, are discussed and special\nattention to the top contribution to $\\Delta \\rho$ is given. We conclude that\nthe only sensible way to confront a model with the experimental data is to\nrenormalize it self-consistently, if not, parameters which depend strongly on\nquantum effects should be left free in fits, though essential physics is lost\nin this way. We should note that arguments given here allow us to state that at\nthe level of loop corrections (indirect effects) there is nothing like a\n``model independent global analysis'' of the data.\n","Comment: 10 pages"]}]

In addition, for these virtualities, we also find\nsizeable contributions from large non-perturbative dipoles ($b \\gsim 0.4$ fm)\nto $F_2$, and also to $F_L$.
