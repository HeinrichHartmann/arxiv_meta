While the attractive Hubbard\nmodel can be regarded as the generalization of BCS to Bose Einstein\ncondensation (BEC) crossover to a lattice, we find that the BEC limit of this\nHubbard model is very different from that of jellium, owing to the strong\ninter-site repulsion between pairs, which becomes important near half filling\nwhen the on-site attraction is strong.

A\nnonlinear tracking controller is developed on the special Euclidean group $\\SE$\nfor each flight mode, and the closed loop is shown to have desirable closed\nloop properties that are almost global in each case.

Theoretical models also vary, suggesting that the absence or\npresence of the nodes depends quantitatively on the model parameters. An\nopinion that has gained substantial currency is that the gap structure, unlike\nall other known superconductors, including cuprates, may be different in\ndifferent compounds within the same family. A unique method for addressing this\nissue, one of the very few methods that are bulk and angle-resolved, calls for\nmeasuring the electronic specific heat in a rotating magnetic field, as a\nfunction of field orientation with respect to the crystallographic axes.

In particular, we specify the density at z of critical clusters\nconditioned to touch either or both vertical sides of the rectangle, with these\nsides 'wired,' i.e. constrained to be in a single cluster, and the horizontal\nsides free. These quantities probe the structure of various cluster\nconfigurations, including those that contribute to the crossing probability.\n  We first examine the effects of boundary conditions on C for the critical\nO(n) loop models in both high and low density phases and for both\nFortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) and spin clusters in the critical Q-state Potts models.\nA Coulomb gas analysis then allows us to calculate the cluster densities with\nvarious conditionings in terms of the known conformal blocks.

A diagnostic policy is a complete description of the decision-making\nactions of a diagnostician (i.e., tests followed by a diagnostic decision) for\nall possible combinations of test results. An optimal diagnostic policy is one\nthat minimizes the expected total cost, which is the sum of measurement costs\nand misdiagnosis costs. In most diagnostic settings, there is a tradeoff\nbetween these two kinds of costs. This paper formalizes diagnostic decision\nmaking as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The paper introduces a new family of\nsystematic search algorithms based on the AO* algorithm to solve this MDP. To\nmake AO* efficient, the paper describes an admissible heuristic that enables\nAO* to prune large parts of the search space. The paper also introduces several\ngreedy algorithms including some improvements over previously-published\nmethods. The paper then addresses the question of learning diagnostic policies\nfrom examples. When the probabilities of diseases and test results are computed\nfrom training data, there is a great danger of overfitting. To reduce\noverfitting, regularizers are integrated into the search algorithms. Finally,\nthe paper compares the proposed methods on five benchmark diagnostic data sets.\nThe studies show that in most cases the systematic search methods produce\nbetter diagnostic policies than the greedy methods.

Despite their promise, current BDI team\napproaches lack tools for quantitative performance analysis under uncertainty.\nDistributed partially observable Markov decision problems (POMDPs) are well\nsuited for such analysis, but the complexity of finding optimal policies in\nsuch models is highly intractable. The key contribution of this article is a\nhybrid BDI-POMDP approach, where BDI team plans are exploited to improve POMDP\ntractability and POMDP analysis improves BDI team plan performance. Concretely,\nwe focus on role allocation, a fundamental problem in BDI teams: which agents\nto allocate to the different roles in the team. The article provides three key\ncontributions. First, we describe a role allocation technique that takes into\naccount future uncertainties in the domain; prior work in multiagent role\nallocation has failed to address such uncertainties. To that end, we introduce\nRMTDP (Role-based Markov Team Decision Problem), a new distributed POMDP model\nfor analysis of role allocations. Our technique gains in tractability by\nsignificantly curtailing RMTDP policy search; in particular, BDI team plans\nprovide incomplete RMTDP policies, and the RMTDP policy search fills the gaps\nin such incomplete policies by searching for the best role allocation. Our\nsecond key contribution is a novel decomposition technique to further improve\nRMTDP policy search efficiency. Even though limited to searching role\nallocations, there are still combinatorially many role allocations, and\nevaluating each in RMTDP to identify the best is extremely difficult. Our\ndecomposition technique exploits the structure in the BDI team plans to\nsignificantly prune the search space of role allocations.

The solutions map belief states to\nactions. Models of other agents may include their belief states and are related\nto agent types considered in games of incomplete information. We express the\nagents autonomy by postulating that their models are not directly manipulable\nor observable by other agents.

We consider these questions\nin the context of the job-shop scheduling problem (JSP), a domain where tabu\nsearch algorithms have been shown to be remarkably effective. Previously, we\ndemonstrated that the mean distance between random local optima and the nearest\noptimal solution is highly correlated with problem difficulty for a well-known\ntabu search algorithm for the JSP introduced by Taillard. In this paper, we\ndiscuss various shortcomings of this measure and develop a new model of problem\ndifficulty that corrects these deficiencies. We show that Taillards algorithm\ncan be modeled with high fidelity as a simple variant of a straightforward\nrandom walk. The random walk model accounts for nearly all of the variability\nin the cost required to locate both optimal and sub-optimal solutions to random\nJSPs, and provides an explanation for differences in the difficulty of random\nversus structured JSPs. Finally, we discuss and empirically substantiate two\nnovel predictions regarding tabu search algorithm behavior. First, the method\nfor constructing the initial solution is highly unlikely to impact the\nperformance of tabu search. Second, tabu tenure should be selected to be as\nsmall as possible while simultaneously avoiding search stagnation; values\nlarger than necessary lead to significant degradations in performance.\n"]}]

A recent wave of improvements in algorithms for\nBoolean satisfiability (SAT) and 0-1 Integer Linear Programming (ILP) suggests\ngeneric problem-reduction methods, rather than problem-specific heuristics,\nbecause (1) heuristics may be upset by new constraints, (2) heuristics tend to\nignore structure, and (3) many relevant problems are provably inapproximable.\n  Problem reductions often lead to highly symmetric SAT instances, and\nsymmetries are known to slow down SAT solvers.

Our focus on reducing CSPs to SAT allows us\nto leverage recent dramatic improvement in SAT solvers and automatically\nbenefit from future progress.

In decision-theoretic planning, where many desirable behaviours are\nmore naturally expressed as properties of execution sequences rather than as\nproperties of states, NMRDPs form a more natural model than the commonly\nadopted fully Markovian decision process (MDP) model. While the more tractable\nsolution methods developed for MDPs do not directly apply in the presence of\nnon-Markovian rewards, a number of solution methods for NMRDPs have been\nproposed in the literature.

This paper presents NMRDPP (Non-Markovian Reward Decision Process\nPlanner), a software platform for the development and experimentation of\nmethods for decision-theoretic planning with non-Markovian rewards. The current\nversion of NMRDPP implements, under a single interface, a family of methods\nbased on existing as well as new approaches which we describe in detail.

Generally, many algorithms use either the bottom-up or\ntop-down approaches for finding these frequent itemsets. When the length of\nfrequent itemsets to be found is large, the traditional algorithms find all the\nfrequent itemsets from 1-length to n-length, which is a difficult process. This\nproblem can be solved by mining only the Maximal Frequent Itemsets (MFS).\nMaximal Frequent Itemsets are frequent itemsets which have no proper frequent\nsuperset.

An intuitive\nextension of this formalism is communicating ASP, in which multiple ASP\nprograms collaborate to solve the problem at hand. However, the expressiveness\nof communicating ASP has not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we present\na systematic study of the additional expressiveness offered by allowing ASP\nprograms to communicate. First, we consider a simple form of communication\nwhere programs are only allowed to ask questions to each other. For the most\npart, we deliberately only consider simple programs, i.e. programs for which\ncomputing the answer sets is in P. We find that the problem of deciding whether\na literal is in some answer set of a communicating ASP program using simple\ncommunication is NP-hard. In other words: we move up a step in the polynomial\nhierarchy due to the ability of these simple ASP programs to communicate and\ncollaborate. Second, we modify the communication mechanism to also allow us to\nfocus on a sequence of communicating programs, where each program in the\nsequence may successively remove some of the remaining models. This mimics a\nnetwork of leaders, where the first leader has the first say and may remove\nmodels that he or she finds unsatisfactory. Using this particular communication\nmechanism allows us to capture the entire polynomial hierarchy. This means, in\nparticular, that communicating ASP could be used to solve problems that are\nabove the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, such as some forms of\nabductive reasoning as well as PSPACE-complete problems such as STRIPS\nplanning.\n","Comment: 35 pages.

This involves\nconstructing a variational problem that searches over all disturbances of fixed\ninitial amplitude, which respect the boundary conditions, incompressibility and\nthe Navier--Stokes equations, to maximise a chosen functional over an\nasymptotically long time period. The functional must be selected such that it\nidentifies turbulent velocity fields by taking significantly enhanced values\ncompared to those for laminar fields. We illustrate this approach using the\nratio of the final to initial perturbation kinetic energies (energy growth) as\nthe functional and the energy norm to measure amplitudes in the context of pipe\nflow. Our results indicate that the variational problem yields a smooth\nconverged solution providing the amplitude is below the threshold amplitude for\ntransition. This optimal is the nonlinear analogue of the well-studied (linear)\ntransient growth optimal. At and above this threshold, the optimising search\nnaturally seeks out disturbances that trigger turbulence by the end of the\nperiod, and convergence is then practically impossible. The first disturbance\nfound to trigger turbulence as the amplitude is increased identifies the\n`minimal seed' for the given geometry and forcing (Reynolds number). We\nconjecture that it may be possible to select a functional such that the\nconverged optimal below threshold smoothly converges to the minimal seed at\nthreshold.

The core ingredient\nof the proposal is a deformation of Lorentz transformations in which also the\nPlanck scale $E_p$ (in addition to the speed-of-light scale $c$) is described\nas an invariant. Just like the introduction of the invariant $c$ requires a\ndeformation of the Galileian transformations into the Lorentz transformations,\nthe introduction of the invariant $E_p$ requires a deformation of the Lorentz\ntransformations, but there is no special class of inertial observers. The\nPierre Auger Observatory and the GLAST space telescope should play a key role\nin future developments of these investigations.

It is well known that for small transverse\nsize dipoles this cross section is related to the leading-log gluon density.\nUsing the measured pion-proton cross section as a guide, we suggest a\nreasonable extrapolation of the dipole cross section to the large transverse\nsize region. We point out that the observed magnitude and small $x$ rise of the\ngluon density from conventional fits implies that the DGLAP approximation has a\nrestricted region of applicability. We found that `higher twist' or unitarity\ncorrections are required in, or close to, the HERA kinematic region, even for\nsmall `perturbative' dipoles for scattering at central impact parameters. This\nmeans that the usual perturbative leading twist description, for moderate\nvirtualities, $1 < Q^2 < 10$ GeV$^2$, has rather large `higher twist'\ncorrections at small $x$. In addition, for these virtualities, we also find\nsizeable contributions from large non-perturbative dipoles ($b \\gsim 0.4$ fm)\nto $F_2$, and also to $F_L$. This also leads to deviations from the standard\nleading twist DGLAP results, at small $x$ and moderate $Q^2$. Our model also\ndescribes the low $Q^2$ data very well without any further tuning.

These calculi are bicovariant under the action of\nthe full inhomogeneous (multiparametric) quantum group ISO_{q,r}(N), and do\ncontain dilatations.\n  If we require bicovariance only under the quantum orthogonal group\nSO_{q,r}(N), the calculus on the q-plane can be expressed in terms of its\ncoordinates x^a, differentials dx^a and partial derivatives \\partial_a without\nthe need of dilatations, thus generalizing known results to the multiparametric\ncase. Using real forms that lead to the signature (n+1,m) with m = n-1, n, n+1\n, we find ISO_{q,r}(n+1, m) and SO_{q,r}(n+1,m) bicovariant calculi on the\nmultiparametric quantum spaces. The particular case of the quantum Minkowski\nspace ISO_{q,r}(3,1)/SO_{q,r}(3,1) is treated in detail.\n  The conjugated partial derivatives \\partial_a* can be expressed as linear\ncombinations of the \\partial_a. This allows a deformation of the phase-space\nwhere no additional operators (besides x^a and p_a) are needed.\n","Comment: LaTeX, 36 pages.
