It\nwas discovered in recent years that string theory on AdS_5xS^5 admits a Lax\nformulation. However, the complete statement of integrability requires not only\nthe existence of a Lax formulation, but also that the resulting integrals of\nmotion are in pairwise involution.

The\nconstruction is based on an invariant algebraic curve previously found in the\nAdS_5xS^5 case. However, encoding the dynamics of the solution requires\nspecification of additional marked points. By restricting the symplectic\nstructure of the string to this algebro-geometric data we derive the\naction-angle variables of the system. We then perform a first-principle\nsemiclassical quantisation of string theory on RxS^3 as a toy model for strings\non AdS_5xS^5. The result is exactly what one expects from the dual gauge theory\nperspective, namely the underlying algebraic curve discretises in a natural\nway.

Because of this cancellation, regulation of the matter field\nzero-point energy density is not needed, and thus does not cause any trace\nanomaly to arise. We exhibit our results in two theories of gravity that are\nwell-defined quantum-mechanically. Both of these theories are locally conformal\ninvariant, quantum Einstein gravity in two dimensions and Weyl-tensor-based\nquantum conformal gravity in four dimensions (a fourth-order derivative quantum\ntheory of the type that Bender and Mannheim have recently shown to be\nghost-free and unitary). Central to our approach is the requirement that any\nand all departures of the geometry from Minkowski are to be brought about by\nquantum mechanics alone. Consequently, there have to be no fundamental\nclassical fields, and all mass scales have to be generated by dynamical\ncondensates. In such a situation the trace of the matter field energy-momentum\ntensor is zero, a constraint that obliges its cosmological constant and\nzero-point contributions to cancel each other identically, no matter how large\nthey might be.

Results are presented on the phi invariant yield and the\nnuclear modification factor R_AA for Au+Au and Cu+Cu, and R_dA for d+Au\ncollisions, studied as a function of transverse momentum (1<p_T<7 GeV/c) and\ncentrality. In central and mid-central Au+Au collisions, the R_AA of phi\nexhibits a suppression relative to expectations from binary scaled p+p results.\nThe amount of suppression is smaller than that of the neutral pion and the eta\nmeson in the intermediate p_T range (2--5 GeV/c); whereas at higher p_T the\nphi, pi^0, and eta show similar suppression. The baryon (protons and\nanti-protons) excess observed in central Au+Au collisions at intermediate p_T\nis not observed for the phi meson despite the similar mass of the proton and\nthe phi. This suggests that the excess is linked to the number of constituent\nquarks rather than the hadron mass. The difference gradually disappears with\ndecreasing centrality and for peripheral collisions the R_AA values for both\nparticles are consistent with binary scaling. Cu+Cu collisions show the same\nyield and suppression as Au+Au collisions for the same number of N_part. The\nR_dA of phi shows no evidence for cold nuclear effects within uncertainties.\n","Comment: 532 authors, 11 pages text, RevTeX-4, 7 figures, 1 Table.

This can be done by\nintroducing a feedback transmission scheme as an inner code. In this paper,\nthis process is investigated for the case when a linear feedback scheme is\nimplemented as an inner code and, in particular, over an additive white\nGaussian noise (AWGN) channel with noisy feedback. To begin, we look to derive\nthe optimal linear feedback scheme by optimizing over the received\nsignal-to-noise ratio. From this optimization, an asymptotically optimal linear\nfeedback scheme is produced and compared to other well-known schemes. Then, the\nlinear feedback scheme is implemented as an inner code to a concatenated code\nover the AWGN channel with noisy feedback. This code shows improvements not\nonly in error exponent bounds, but also in bit-error-rate and frame-error-rate.\nIt is also shown that the if the concatenated code has total blocklength L and\nthe inner code has blocklength, N, the inner code blocklength should scale as N\n= O(C/R), where C is the capacity of the channel and R is the rate of the outer\ncode.

We show how to compute a 1 +-\nepsilon approximation (with small probability of error) in expected time O(n)\nfor any epsilon > 4/\\sqrt[4]{z}. The previously best estimation algorithm, due\nto Cohen (JCSS 1997), uses time O(n/epsilon^2). We also present a variant using\nO(sort(n)) I/Os in expectation in the cache-oblivious model. In contrast to\nthese results, the currently best algorithms for computing a sparse boolean\nmatrix product use time omega(n^{4/3}) (resp. omega(n^{4/3}/B) I/Os), even if\nthe result matrix has only z=O(n) nonzero entries. Our algorithm combines the\nsize estimation technique of Bar-Yossef et al.

We then describe how sampling can be used to maintain (independent)\nsketches of matrices that allow estimation to be performed in time o(n) if z is\nsufficiently large. This gives a simpler alternative to the sketching technique\nof Ganguly et al. (PODS 2005), and matches a space lower bound shown in that\npaper. Finally, we present experiments on real-world data sets that show the\naccuracy of both our methods to be significantly better than the worst-case\nanalysis predicts.\n","Comment: Corrected a number of mistakes and typos in the first version (also\n  present in the version published at RANDOM 2010). Most importantly, the lower\n  bound on the error epsilon is now a function of z rather than n"]}]

Despite these\noscillations, our models do not develop the runaway instability during the\nfirst several orbital periods. Instead, all of the models develop unstable\nnon-axisymmetric modes on a dynamical timescale. We observe two distinct types\nof instabilities: the Papaloizou-Pringle and the so-called intermediate type\ninstabilities. The development of the non-axisymmetric mode with azimuthal\nnumber m = 1 is accompanied by an outspiraling motion of the black hole, which\nsignificantly amplifies the growth rate of the m = 1 mode in some cases.\nOverall, our simulations show that the properties of the unstable\nnon-axisymmetric modes in our disk models are qualitatively similar to those in\nNewtonian theory.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 21 figures"]}]

Even though RG(pk) does not\ncapture many graph properties common in real-life graphs (such as\nassortativity), our RG(pk)-based correction technique performs well on a broad\nrange of Internet topologies and on two large BFS samples of Facebook and Orkut\nnetworks.
