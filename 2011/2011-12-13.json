In this article, OPCOT\nconcurrency control algorithm is introduced based on optimistic concurrency\ncontrol method. Reducing communications between mobile client and server,\ndecreasing blocking rate and deadlock of transactions, and increasing\nconcurrency degree are the most important motivation of using optimistic method\nas the basis method of OPCOT algorithm. To reduce abortion rate of\ntransactions, in execution time of transactions` operators a timestamp is\nassigned to them. In other to checking commitment ordering property of\nscheduler, the assigned timestamp is used in server on time of commitment. In\nthis article, serializability of OPCOT algorithm scheduler has been proved by\nusing serializability graph. Results of evaluating simulation show that OPCOT\nalgorithm decreases abortion rate and waiting time of transactions in compare\nto 2pl and optimistic algorithms.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 13 figures, Journal: International Journal of Database\n  Management Systems (IJDMS)"]}]

The angler goes\nfishing. He uses various techniques and he has at most two fishing rods. He\nbuys a fishing ticket for a fixed time. The fishes are caught with the use of\ndifferent methods according to the renewal processes. The fishes' value and the\ninter arrival times are given by the sequences of independent, identically\ndistributed (i.i.d.) random variables with the known distribution functions. It\nforms the marked renewal--reward process. The angler's measure of satisfaction\nis given by the difference between the utility function, depending on the value\nof the fishes caught, and the cost function connected with the time of fishing.\nIn this way, the angler's relative opinion about the methods of fishing is\nmodelled. The angler's aim is to have as much satisfaction as possible and\nadditionally he has to leave the lake before a fixed moment. Therefore his goal\nis to find two optimal stopping times in order to maximize his satisfaction. At\nthe first moment, he changes the technique of fishing, e.g. by excluding one\nrod and intensifying on the rest. Next, he decides when he should stop the\nexpedition. These stopping times have to be shorter than the fixed time of\nfishing. The dynamic programming methods have been used to find these two\noptimal stopping times and to specify the expected satisfaction of the angler\nat these times.\n","Comment: 23 pages + index"]}]

This\nrewriting enables us to avoid the overhead of view materialization and\nmaintenance. A major concern here is that query rewriting for recursive XML\nviews is still an open problem. To overcome this problem, some works have been\nproposed to translate XPath queries into non-standard ones, called Regular\nXPath queries.

At the core of ViP2P stand\ndistributed materialized XML views, defined by arbitrary XML queries, filled in\nwith data published anywhere in the network, and exploited to efficiently\nanswer queries issued by any network peer. ViP2P allows user queries to be\nevaluated over XML documents published by peers in two modes. First, a\nlong-running subscription mode, when a query can be registered in the system\nand receive answers incrementally when and if published data matches the query.\nSecond, queries can also be asked in an ad-hoc, snapshot mode, where results\nare required immediately and must be computed based on the results of other\nlong-running, subscription queries. ViP2P innovates over other similar\nDHT-based XML sharing platforms by using a very expressive structured XML query\nlanguage. This expressivity leads to a very flexible distribution of XML\ncontent in the ViP2P network, and to efficient snapshot query execution. ViP2P\nhas been tested in real deployments of hundreds of computers. We present the\nplatform architecture, its internal algorithms, and demonstrate its efficiency\nand scalability through a set of experiments. Our experimental results outgrow\nby orders of magnitude similar competitor systems in terms of data volumes,\nnetwork size and data dissemination throughput.\n","Comment: RR-7812 (2011)"]}]

Our BBN calculations include updates of nuclear rates in light of\nrecent experimental and theoretical information, with the most significant\nchange occuring for the d(p,gamma)^3He cross section. We calculate a likelihood\nfunction for BBN theory and observations that accounts for both observational\nerrors and nuclear rate uncertainties and can be easily embedded in\ncosmological parameter fitting. We then demonstrate that CMB and BBN are in\ngood agreement, suggesting that the number of relativistic species did not\nchange between the time of BBN and the time of recombination. The level of\nagreement between BBN and CMB, as well as the agreement with the standard model\nof particle physics, depends somewhat on systematic differences among\ndeterminations of the primordial helium abundance. We demonstrate that\ninteresting constraints can be derived combining only CMB and D/H observations\nwith BBN theory, suggesting that an improved D/H constraint would be an\nextremely valuable probe of cosmology.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 3 figures, submitted to Phys.

Although\ncollisional mass loss is accounted for realistically, we find that a VMS forms\neven in proto-galactic nuclei models with a high velocity dispersion (many 100\nkm/s).
