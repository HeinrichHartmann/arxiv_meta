The nature of the result depends on\nseveral parameters, including the occupation number N_k, the phase angle\n\\theta_k between the Bogoliubov parameters, and the slow-roll parameter\n\\epsilon. In the most conservative case, where one takes \\theta_k \\approx\n\\eta_0 k (justified by physical reasons discussed within) and \\epsilon\\lesssim\n0.01, we find that 0 < fNL < 1.52 (\\epsilon/0.01), which is likely too small to\nbe detected in the CMB. However, if one is willing to allow a constant value\nfor the phase angle \\theta_k and N_k=O(1), fNL can be much larger and/or\nnegative (depending on the choice of \\theta_k), e.g. fNL \\approx 28\n(\\epsilon/0.01) or -6.4 (\\epsilon/0.01); depending on \\epsilon, these scenarios\ncould be detected by Planck or a future satellite. While we show that these\nresults are not actually a violation of the single-field consistency relation,\nthey do produce a value for fNL that is considerably larger than that usually\npredicted from single-field inflation.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 1 figure. v2: Version accepted for publication in PRD.

In cosmology, it is used to quantify large-scale structure\n(LSS) and the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This is because the power\nspectrum completely quantifies Gaussian random fields, which the CMB and LSS\nfields seem to be at early epochs. However, at late epochs and small scales,\ncosmological density fields become highly non-Gaussian. The power spectrum\nloses power to describe LSS and CMB fields on small scales, most obviously\nthrough high covariance in the power spectrum as a function of scale.\nPractically, this significantly degrades constraints that observations can\nplace on cosmological parameters. However, if a nonlinear transformation that\nproduces a (more) Gaussian 1-point distribution is applied to a field, the\nextra covariance in the field's power spectrum can be dramatically reduced. In\nthe case of the roughly lognormal low-redshift matter density field, a log\ntransform accomplishes this.

These intracellular particles can be found in four different modes of\n(undirected and directed) motion and can fuse with other vesicles. While the\nsize of vesicles follows a log-normal distribution that changes over time due\nto fusion processes, their spatial distribution gives rise to distinct\npatterns. Their occurrence depends on the concentration of proteins which are\nsynthesized based on the transcriptional activities of some genes. Hence,\ndifferences in these spatio-temporal vesicle patterns allow indirect\nconclusions about the (unknown) impact of these genes.\n  By means of agent-based computer simulations we are able to reproduce such\npatterns on real temporal and spatial scales. Our modeling approach is based on\nBrownian agents with an internal degree of freedom, $\\theta$, that represents\nthe different modes of motion. Conditions inside the cell are modeled by an\neffective potential that differs for agents dependent on their value $\\theta$.\nAgent's motion in this effective potential is modeled by an overdampted\nLangevin equation, changes of $\\theta$ are modeled as stochastic transitions\nwith values obtained from experiments, and fusion events are modeled as\nspace-dependent stochastic transitions. Our results for the spatio-temporal\nvesicle patterns can be used for a statistical comparison with experiments. We\nalso derive hypotheses of how the silencing of some genes may affect the\nintracellular transport, and point to generalizations of the model.\n"]}]

It is shown that the motion of infinitesimal fluid\nelements (i.e. a set of Lagrangian trajectories) in an interacting quantum\nsystem is governed by a closed hydrodynamics equation with the stress force\nbeing a universal functional of the Green's deformation tensor $g_{ij}$. Since\nthe Lagrangian trajectories uniquely determine the current density, this\napproach can be also viewed as a representation of the time-dependent current\ndensity functional theory. To derive the above theory we separate a\n\"convective\" and a \"relative\" motions of particles by reformulating the\nmany-body problem in a comoving Lagrangian frame. Then we prove that a properly\ndefined many-body wave function (and thus any observable) in the comoving frame\nis a universal functional of the deformation tensor. Both the hydrodynamic and\nthe Kohn-Sham formulations of the theory are presented. In the Kohn-Sham\nformulation we derive a few exact representations of the exchange-correlation\npotentials, and discuss their implication for the construction of new\nnonadiabatic approximations.

A. Fuchs and M. Sasaki defined the quantumness of a set of quantum states\nin \\cite{Quantumness}, which is closely related to the fidelity loss in\ntransmission of the quantum states through a classical channel. In\n\\cite{Fuchs}, Fuchs showed that in $d$-dimensional Hilbert space, minimum\nquantumness is $\\frac{2}{d+1}$, and this can be achieved by all rays in the\nspace. He left an open problem, asking whether fewer than $d^2$ states can\nachieve this bound. Recently, in a different context, A. J.

In this paper, we show that the lower\nbound on the quantumness can be achieved if and only if the states form a\ngeneralized 2-design. As a corollary, we show that this bound can be only\nachieved if the number of states are larger or equal to $d^2$, answering the\nopen problem. Furthermore, we also show that the minimal set of such ensemble\nis Symmetric Informationally Complete POVM(SIC-POVM).
