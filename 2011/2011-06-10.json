Finally, based on current observational data, we plot the evolutionary\ntrajectories in $s-r$ and $q-r$ planes for best fit values of the parameters of\nGCG model. It has been shown that although, there are similarities between GCG\nmodel and other forms of chaplygin gas in statefinder plane, but the distance\nof this model from the $\\Lambda$CDM fixed point in $s-r$ diagram is shorter\ncompare with standard chaplygin gas model.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 5 figures, accepted in Astrophys Space Sci.

However,\nthe baseline of the European XFEL, including the soft X-ray SASE3 line,\nforesees planar undulators only. The lowest-risk strategy for implementing\npolarization control at SASE3 involves adding an APPLE II-type undulator at the\nend of the planar undulator, to exploit the microbunching from the baseline\nFEL. 5m-long APPLE II undulators are standard devices at synchrotrons. However,\nthe choice of a short helical radiator leads to the problem of background\nsuppression. The driving idea of our proposal is that the background radiation\ncan be suppressed by spatial filtering. Slits can be inserted behind the APPLE\nII radiator, where the linearly-polarized radiation spot size is about 30 times\nlarger than the radiation spot size from the helical radiator. The last 7 cells\nof the SASE3 undulator are left with an open gap in order to provide a total 42\nm drift section for electron beam and radiation. The linearly-polarized\nradiation spot size increases along the drift, and the linearly polarized\nbackground radiation can be suppressed by the slits. At the same time, the\nmicrobunch structure is preserved. 100GW level coherent radiation is emitted in\nthe helical radiator. The filtering setup consists of a pair of water cooled\nslits for X-ray beam filtering and of a 5m-long magnetic chicane, creating an\noffset for slit installation immediately behind the helical radiator. Electrons\nand X-rays are separated before the slits by the chicane, and the electron beam\ncan pass by the filtering setup without perturbations.

In this paper, we characterize the\nmethodology and examine eight implicit assumptions about the problems, planners\nand metrics used in many of these comparisons. The problem assumptions are:\nPR1) the performance of a general purpose planner should not be\npenalized/biased if executed on a sampling of problems and domains, PR2) minor\nsyntactic differences in representation do not affect performance, and PR3)\nproblems should be solvable by STRIPS capable planners unless they require ADL.\nThe planner assumptions are: PL1) the latest version of a planner is the best\none to use, PL2) default parameter settings approximate good performance, and\nPL3) time cut-offs do not unduly bias outcome. The metrics assumptions are: M1)\nperformance degrades similarly for each planner when run on degraded runtime\nenvironments (e.g., machine platform) and M2) the number of plan steps\ndistinguishes performance. We find that most of these assumptions are not\nsupported empirically; in particular, that planners are affected differently by\nthese assumptions. We conclude with a call to the community to devote research\nresources to improving the state of the practice and especially to enhancing\nthe available benchmark problems.\n"]}]

However,\nin monitoring deployed teams, we often cannot rely on the agents to always\ncommunicate their state to the monitoring system. This paper presents a\nnon-intrusive approach to monitoring by 'overhearing', where the monitored\nteam's state is inferred (via plan-recognition) from team-members' routine\ncommunications, exchanged as part of their coordinated task execution, and\nobserved (overheard) by the monitoring system. Key challenges in this approach\ninclude the demanding run-time requirements of monitoring, the scarceness of\nobservations (increasing monitoring uncertainty), and the need to scale-up\nmonitoring to address potentially large teams. To address these, we present a\nset of complementary novel techniques, exploiting knowledge of the social\nstructures and procedures in the monitored team: (i) an efficient probabilistic\nplan-recognition algorithm, well-suited for processing communications as\nobservations; (ii) an approach to exploiting knowledge of the team's social\nbehavior to predict future observations during execution (reducing monitoring\nuncertainty); and (iii) monitoring algorithms that trade expressivity for\nscalability, representing only certain useful monitoring hypotheses, but\nallowing for any number of agents and their different activities to be\nrepresented in a single coherent entity.

The particular problem domain we\nexplore is the control of network routing by placing agents on all the routers\nin the network. Conventional approaches to this task have the agents all use\nthe Ideal Shortest Path routing Algorithm (ISPA). We demonstrate that in many\ncases, due to the side-effects of one agent's actions on another agent's\nperformance, having agents use ISPA's is suboptimal as far as global aggregate\ncost is concerned, even when they are only used to route infinitesimally small\namounts of traffic. The utility functions of the individual agents are not\n\"aligned\" with the global utility, intuitively speaking. As a particular\nexample of this we present an instance of Braess' paradox in which adding new\nlinks to a network whose agents all use the ISPA results in a decrease in\noverall throughput. We also demonstrate that load-balancing, in which the\nagents' decisions are collectively made to optimize the global cost incurred by\nall traffic currently being routed, is suboptimal as far as global cost\naveraged across time is concerned. This is also due to 'side-effects', in this\ncase of current routing decision on future traffic. The mathematics of\nCollective Intelligence (COIN) is concerned precisely with the issue of\navoiding such deleterious side-effects in multi-agent systems, both over time\nand space. We present key concepts from that mathematics and use them to derive\nan algorithm whose ideal version should have better performance than that of\nhaving all agents use the ISPA, even in the infinitesimal limit. We present\nexperiments verifying this, and also showing that a machine-learning-based\nversion of this COIN algorithm in which costs are only imprecisely estimated\nvia empirical means (a version potentially applicable in the real world) also\noutperforms the ISPA, despite having access to less information than does the\nISPA.

This causes heating, a limitation for atom-based quantum information\nprocessing where it obviates straightforward reuse of the qubit. No such energy\nexchange is required by quantum mechanics. Here we experimentally demonstrate\noptical detection of an atomic qubit with significantly less than one\nspontaneous scattering event. We measure transmission and reflection of an\noptical cavity containing the atom. In addition to the qubit detection itself,\nwe quantitatively measure how much spontaneous scattering has occurred. This\nallows us to relate the information gained to the amount of spontaneous\nemission, and we obtain a detection error below 10% while scattering less than\n0.2 photons on average. Furthermore, we perform a quantum Zeno type experiment\nto quantify the measurement back action and find that every incident photon\nleads to an almost complete state collapse. Together, these results constitute\na full experimental characterization of a quantum measurement in the \"energy\nexchange-free\" regime below a single spontaneous emission event. Besides its\nfundamental interest, this means significant simplification for proposed\nneutral-atom quantum computation schemes and may enable sensitive detection of\nmolecules and atoms lacking closed transitions.\n"]}]
