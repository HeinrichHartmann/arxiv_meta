The uncertainties {ui} of measuring {Xi} are generally a priori\nensured as acceptable. However, there is no general method for assessing\nuncertainty (em) in the desired Ym, i.e. irrespective of whatever might be its\nsystem-specific-relationship (SSR) with {Xi}, and/ or be the causes of {ui}. We\nhere therefore study the behaviors of different typical SSRs. The study shows\nthat any SSR is characterized by a set of parameters, which govern em. That is,\nem is shown to represent a net SSR-driven (purely systematic) change in ui(s);\nand it cannot vary for whether ui(s) be caused by either or both statistical\nand systematic reasons. We thus present the general relationship of em with\nui(s), and discuss how it can be used to predict a priori the requirements for\nan evaluated Ym to be representative, and hence to set the guidelines for\ndesigning experiments and also really appropriate evaluation models. Say: Y_m=\nf_m ({X_i}_(i=1)^N), then, although: e_m= g_m ({u_i}_(i=1)^N), \"N\" is not a key\nfactor in governing em. However, simply for varying \"fm\", the em is\ndemonstrated to be either equaling a ui, or >ui, or even <ui. Further, the\nlimiting error (d_m^(Lim.)) in determining an Ym is also shown to be decided by\n\"fm\" (SSR). Thus, all SSRs are classified into two groups: (I) the SSRs that\ncan never lead \"d_m^(Lim.)\" to be zero; and (II) the SSRs that enable\n\"d_m^(Lim.)\" to be zero. In fact, the theoretical-tool (SSR) is by pros and\ncons no different from any discrete experimental-means of a study, and has\nresemblance with chemical reactions as well.\n","Comment: 39 pages (Edited version [no. 3] With clarifying appendix no. 1 on\n  notations): however, wrong file got uploaded yesterday"]}]

We present a first\ngeneral characterization of the pulsational behaviour of A-F type stars as\nobserved in the Kepler light curves of a sample of 750 candidate A-F type\nstars. We propose three main groups to describe the observed variety in\npulsating A-F type stars: gamma Dor, delta Sct, and hybrid stars. We assign 63%\nof our sample to one of the three groups, and identify the remaining part as\nrotationally modulated/active stars, binaries, stars of different spectral\ntype, or stars that show no clear periodic variability. 23% of the stars (171\nstars) are hybrid stars, which is a much larger fraction than what has been\nobserved before. We characterize for the first time a large number of A-F type\nstars (475 stars) in terms of number of detected frequencies, frequency range,\nand typical pulsation amplitudes. The majority of hybrid stars show frequencies\nwith all kinds of periodicities within the gamma Dor and delta Sct range, also\nbetween 5 and 10 c/d, which is a challenge for the current models. We find\nindications for the existence of delta Sct and gamma Dor stars beyond the edges\nof the current observational instability strips.

In this paper, we explore specific classes of wiretap\nchannels for which the expression and evaluation of the rate-equivocation\nregion are simpler. In particular, we show that when the main channel is more\ncapable than the eavesdropping channel, V=X is optimal and the boundary of the\nrate-equivocation region can be achieved by varying U alone. Conversely, we\nshow under a mild condition that if the main receiver is not more capable, then\nV=X is strictly suboptimal. Next, we focus on the class of cyclic shift\nsymmetric wiretap channels. We explicitly determine the optimal selections of\nrate splitting U and channel prefixing V that achieve the boundary of the\nrate-equivocation region. We show that optimal U and V are determined via\ncyclic shifts of the solution of an auxiliary optimization problem that\ninvolves only one auxiliary random variable. In addition, we provide a\nsufficient condition for cyclic shift symmetric wiretap channels to have U=\\phi\nas an optimal selection. Finally, we apply our results to the binary-input\ncyclic shift symmetric wiretap channels. We solve the corresponding constrained\noptimization problem by inspecting each point of the I(X;Y)-I(X;Z) function. We\nthoroughly characterize the rate-equivocation regions of the BSC-BEC and\nBEC-BSC wiretap channels. In particular, we find that U=\\phi is optimal and the\nboundary of the rate-equivocation region is achieved by varying V alone for the\nBSC-BEC wiretap channel.\n","Comment: Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, October 2011"]}]

Five pure-rotational H2 emission\nlines are detected and mapped over and around the Southern Ridge in order to\ncompare with predicted level column densities from theoretical PDR models. We\nfind very good agreement between PDR model predictions and emission line\nintensities and ratios measured with Spitzer, leading us to conclude that grain\nphotoelectric heating sufficiently warms the gas to produce the observed H2\nline emission via collisional excitation. On the Southern Ridge, we infer a\nhydrogen nucleus density n_H approx 2x10^5 cm^-3 and radiation field strength\n\\chi\\ approx 10^4 relative to the local Galactic interstellar radiation field.\nThis high value for \\chi\\ independently predicts a distance toward HD 37903 of\n300 pc, and is consistent with the most recent HIPPARCOS results. Over the map\nwe find that both n_H and \\chi\\ vary by a factor of sim 3. Such 2-D variations\nprovide clues about the underlying 3-D structure of the Southern Ridge field,\nwhich appears to be the tip of a molecular cloud. We also map variations in\nexcitation temperature and the ortho-to-para ratio, the latter attaining values\nof sim 1.5---2.0 on the Southern Ridge, and find that PDR modeling can readily\nreproduce observed ortho-to-para ratios that are < 3 for rotational excitation\ndominated by collisional processes.
