This condition constrains the Hilbert space\ngenerated by the macroscopic loop operator but the bulk matrix model remains\nunaffected, thereby describing a situation parallel to string theory. We have\nanalyzed the constrained theory with uncompactified as well as compactified\ntime and have shown that it is in good agreement with string theory. Without\nthis constraint, the grand canonical partition function for MQM on a circle in\nthe presence of the brane diverges while the constrained partition function is\nfinite and corresponds to that of a deformed Fermi surface, as expected within\nthe compactified theory. Matrix model path integral on a circle in the presence\nof the brane is expressed as Fredholm determinant. We consider matrix model in\nthe presence of the brane, to be perturbed by momentum modes. We obtain the\nexpression of MQM wave function in this background from collective field theory\nanalysis. We have shown with the help of this constraint that the grand\ncanonical partition function has an integrable structure and can be expressed\nas tau function of Toda hierarchy. Finally we have analyzed the dispersionless\nlimit.\n","Comment: LaTeX file, 55 pages"]}]
