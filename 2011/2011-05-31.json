The packing fraction dependent\nmechanical properties are characterised by a fluid-solid transition, where the\nsystem properties switch from a viscous to an elastic low-frequency behaviour.\nApproaching this transition from below, we find that the range of spatial\ncorrelations in the dynamics increases. Beyond this transition, the spatial\ncorrelation range reaches a maximum, extending over the entire observable\nsystem size of approximately 5 mm. Increasing the packing fraction even further\nleads to a second transition, which is characterised by the development of\nlarge zones of lower and higher dynamical activity that are well separated from\neach other; the range of correlation decreases at this point. This striking\nnon-monotonic dependence of the spatial correlation length on volume fraction\nis reminiscent of the behaviour recently observed at the jamming/rigidity\ntransition in granular systems (Lechenault et al. 2008). We identify this\nsecond transition as the transition to 'squeezed' states, where the\nconstituents of the system start to exert direct contact forces on each other,\nsuch that the dynamics becomes increasingly determined by imbalanced stresses.\nEvidence of this transition is also found in the frequency dependence of the\nstorage and loss moduli, which become increasingly coupled as direct friction\nbetween the particles starts to contribute to the dissipative losses within the\nsystem. To our knowledge, our data provide the first observation of a\nqualitative change in dynamical heterogeneity as the dynamics switch from\npurely thermally-driven to stress-driven.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 8 figures.

A realistic model of inflation\nmust explain the tiny perturbations in the cosmic microwave background\nradiation and also how to excite the ordinary matter degrees of freedom after\ninflation, required for the success of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We study these\nissues focusing on two promising inflationary models embedded in LARGE volume\ntype IIB flux compactifications. We show that phenomenological requirements and\nconsistency of the effective field theory treatment imply the presence at low\nenergies of a hidden sector together with a visible sector, where the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model fields are residing. A detailed calculation of\nthe inflaton coupling to the fields of the hidden sector, visible sector, and\nmoduli sector, reveals that the inflaton fails to excite primarily the visible\nsector fields, instead hidden sector fields are excited copiously after the end\nof inflation. This sets severe constraints on hidden sector model building\nwhere the most promising scenario emerges as a pure N=1 SYM theory, forbidding\nthe kinematical decay of the inflaton to the hidden sector. In this case it is\npossible to reheat the Universe with the visible degrees of freedom even though\nin some cases we discover a new tension between TeV scale SUSY and reheating on\ntop of the well-known tension between TeV scale SUSY and inflation.\n","Comment: 37 pages + appendix, 5 figures"]}]

We measure the flux of\nemission lines in the stellar-continuum-subtracted spectra from which local\nmetallicities are computed.

Results: Based on our sample, we detect a\ntentative indication that Type Ic supernovae might explode in environments that\nare more metal-rich than those of Type Ib supernovae (average difference of\n0.08 dex), but this is not a statistically significant result.

The\nheavy computational burden makes eQTL analysis less popular, often forces\nanalysts to restrict their attention to just a subset of transcripts and SNPs.\nAs larger genotype and gene expression datasets become available, the demand\nfor fast tools for eQTL analysis increases.

The sensor nodes in the sleep state do\nnot sample or communicate any information to the fusion centre (FC), thereby\nconserving energy. At each time slot, the FC, after having received the samples\nfrom the sensor nodes in the wake state, makes a decision to stop (and thus\ndeclare that the event has occurred) or to continue observing. If it decides to\ncontinue, the FC also makes the decision of choosing the number of sensor nodes\nto be in the wake state in the next time slot. We consider three alternative\napproaches to the problem of choosing the number of sensor nodes to be in the\nwake state in time slot k+1, based on the information available at time slot k,\nnamely, 1. optimal control of M_{k+1}, the number of sensor nodes to be in the\nawake state in time slot k+1, 2. optimal control of q_{k+1}, the probability of\na sensor node to be in the awake state in time slot k+1, and 3. optimal\nprobability q that a sensor node is in the awake state in any time slot. In\neach case, we formulate the problem as a sequential decision process. We show\nthat a sufficient statistic for the decision at time k is the a posteriori\nprobability of change Pi_k. Also, we show that the optimal stopping rule is a\nthreshold rule on Pi_k. The optimal policy for M_{k+1} can keep very few\nsensors wake during the prechange phase and then quickly increase the number of\nsensors in the wake state when a change is \"suspected\".

The performance of iterative\nbelief-propagation (BP) decoding of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes over\nthe BEC can be characterized in terms of stopping sets. We describe turbo\ndecoding on the BEC which is simpler than turbo decoding on other channels. We\nthen adapt the concept of stopping sets to turbo decoding and state an exact\ncondition for decoding failure. Apply turbo decoding until the transmitted\ncodeword has been recovered, or the decoder fails to progress further. Then the\nset of erased positions that will remain when the decoder stops is equal to the\nunique maximum-size turbo stopping set which is also a subset of the set of\nerased positions. Furthermore, we present some improvements of the basic turbo\ndecoding algorithm on the BEC. The proposed improved turbo decoding algorithm\nhas substantially better error performance as illustrated by the given\nsimulation results. Finally, we give an expression for the turbo stopping set\nsize enumerating function under the uniform interleaver assumption, and an\nefficient enumeration algorithm of small-size turbo stopping sets for a\nparticular interleaver.
