In weighted congestion games with linear latency\nfunctions, the existence of (pure Nash) equilibria is guaranteed by potential\nfunction arguments. Unfortunately, this proof of existence is inefficient and\ncomputing equilibria is such games is a {\\sf PLS}-hard problem. The situation\ngets worse when superlinear latency functions come into play; in this case, the\nNash dynamics of the game may contain cycles and equilibria may not even exist.\nGiven these obstacles, we consider approximate equilibria as alternative\nsolution concepts. Do such equilibria exist? And if so, can we compute them\nefficiently?\n  We provide positive answers to both questions for weighted congestion games\nwith polynomial latency functions by exploiting an \"approximation\" of such\ngames by a new class of potential games that we call $\\Psi$-games. This allows\nus to show that these games have $d!$-approximate equilibria, where $d$ is the\nmaximum degree of the latency functions. Our main technical contribution is an\nefficient algorithm for computing O(1)-approximate equilibria when $d$ is a\nconstant. For games with linear latency functions, the approximation guarantee\nis $\\frac{3+\\sqrt{5}}{2}+O(\\gamma)$ for arbitrarily small $\\gamma>0$; for\nlatency functions with maximum degree $d\\geq 2$, it is $d^{2d+o(d)}$. The\nrunning time is polynomial in the number of bits in the representation of the\ngame and $1/\\gamma$. As a byproduct of our techniques, we also show the\nfollowing structural statement for weighted congestion games with polynomial\nlatency functions of maximum degree $d\\geq 2$: polynomially-long sequences of\nbest-response moves from any initial state to a $d^{O(d^2)}$-approximate\nequilibrium exist and can be efficiently identified in such games as long as\n$d$ is constant.\n","Comment: 31 pages"]}]

As a large fraction of the population will be exposed to\nradiation, low-dose imaging is essential. Iterative image reconstruction based\non solving an optimization problem, such as Total-Variation minimization, shows\npotential for reconstruction from sparse-view data. For iterative methods it is\nimportant to ensure convergence to an accurate solution, since important image\nfeatures, such as presence of microcalcifications indicating breast cancer, may\nnot be visible in a non-converged reconstruction, and this can have clinical\nsignificance. To prevent excessively long computational times, which is a\npractical concern for the large image arrays in CT, it is desirable to keep the\nnumber of iterations low, while still ensuring a sufficiently accurate\nreconstruction for the specific imaging task. This motivates the study of\naccurate convergence criteria for iterative image reconstruction. In simulation\nstudies with a realistic breast phantom with microcalcifications we compare\ndifferent convergence criteria for reliable reconstruction. Our results show\nthat it can be challenging to ensure a sufficiently accurate microcalcification\nreconstruction, when using standard convergence criteria. In particular, the\ngray level of the small microcalcifications may not have converged long after\nthe background tissue is reconstructed uniformly.

This scheme builds on compress-forward\n(CF) relaying but involves three new ideas, namely no Wyner-Ziv binning,\nrelaxed simultaneous decoding and message repetition. In this paper, using the\ntwo-way relay channel as the underlining example, we analyze the impact of each\nof these ideas on the achievable rate region of relay networks. First, CF\nwithout binning but with joint decoding of both the message and compression\nindex can achieve a larger rate region than the original CF scheme for\nmulti-destination relay networks. With binning and successive decoding, the\ncompression rate at each relay is constrained by the weakest link from the\nrelay to a destination; but without binning, this constraint is relaxed.\nSecond, simultaneous decoding of all messages over all blocks without uniquely\ndecoding the compression indices can remove the constraints on compression rate\ncompletely, but is still subject to the message block boundary effect. Third,\nmessage repetition is necessary to overcome this boundary effect and achieve\nthe noisy network coding region for multi-source networks. The rate region is\nenlarged with increasing repetition times. We also apply CF without binning\nspecifically to the one-way and two-way relay channels and analyze the rate\nregions in detail. For the one-way relay channel, it achieves the same rate as\nthe original CF and noisy network coding but has only 1 block decoding delay.\nFor the two-way relay channel, we derive the explicit channel conditions in the\nGaussian and fading cases for CF without binning to achieve the same rate\nregion or sum rate as noisy network coding. These analyses may be appealing to\npractical implementation because of the shorter encoding and decoding delay in\nCF without binning.\n","Comment: Submitted to Transactions on Information Theory"]}]

The third edition of the\n\\\"Ozsu-Valduriez textbook Principles of Distributed Database Systems [10]\nreflects the evolution of distributed data management and distributed database\nsystems. In this new edition, the fundamental principles of distributed data\nmanagement could be still presented based on the three dimensions of earlier\neditions: distribution, heterogeneity and autonomy of the data sources. In\nretrospect, the focus on fundamental principles and generic techniques has been\nuseful not only to understand and teach the material, but also to enable an\ninfinite number of variations. The primary application of these generic\ntechniques has been obviously for distributed and parallel DBMS versions.\nToday, to support the requirements of important data-intensive applications\n(e.g. social networks, web data analytics, scientific applications, etc.), new\ndistributed data management techniques and systems (e.g. MapReduce, Hadoop,\nSciDB, Peanut, Pig latin, etc.) are emerging and receiving much attention from\nthe research community. Although they do well in terms of\nconsistency/flexibility/performance trade-offs for specific applications, they\nseem to be ad-hoc and might hurt data interoperability. The key questions I\ndiscuss are: What are the fundamental principles behind the emerging solutions?\nIs there any generic architectural model, to explain those principles?
