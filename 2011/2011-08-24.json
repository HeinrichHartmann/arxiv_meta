For many real physico-chemical\ncomplex systems (e.g. homogeneous combustion, heterogeneous catalytic\noxidation, most enzyme reactions etc), detailed mechanisms include both\nreversible and irreversible reactions. In this case, the principle of detailed\nbalance cannot be applied directly. We represent irreversible reactions as\nlimits of reversible steps and obtain the principle of detailed balance for\ncomplex mechanisms with some irreversible elementary processes. We proved two\nconsequences of the detailed balance for these mechanisms: the structural\ncondition and the algebraic condition that form together the extended form of\ndetailed balance. The algebraic condition is the principle of detailed balance\nfor the reversible part. The structural condition is: the convex hull of the\nstoichiometric vectors of the irreversible reactions has empty intersection\nwith the linear span of the stoichiometric vectors of the reversible reaction.\nPhysically, this means that the irreversible reactions cannot be included in\noriented pathways. The systems with the extended form of detailed balance are\nalso the limits of the reversible systems with detailed balance when some of\nthe equilibrium concentrations (or activities) tend to zero. Surprisingly, the\nstructure of the limit reaction mechanism crucially depends on the relative\nspeeds of this tendency to zero.\n","Comment: The final version (minor corrections and editing), accepted for\n  publication in Chemical Engineering Science"]}]

This was thought to be related to observational biases, but recent\nhigh-precision measurements of WD masses in a great number of CVs are\nchallenging this interpretation. We review the measured WD masses of CVs,\ndetermine the WD-mass distribution of an extensive sample of\npost-common-envelope binaries (PCEBs) that are representative for the\nprogenitors of the current CV population (pre-CVs) and compare both\ndistributions.

Possible observational biases affecting the WD-mass distribution\nfor the pre-CV and the CV samples are discussed. The mean WD mass among CVs is\n<Mwd>=0.83\\pm0.23 Msun, much larger than that found for pre-CVs,\n<Mwd>=0.67\\pm0.21 Msun. Selection effects cannot explain the high WD masses\nobserved in CVs and we here suggest two possible explanations, both of which\nimply substantial revisions to the standard model of CV evolution: either most\nCVs have formed above the orbital-period gap (which requires a high WD mass to\ninitiate stable mass transfer or a previous phase of thermal-timescale mass\ntransfer), or the mass of the WDs in CVs grows through accretion (which\nstrongly disagrees with the predictions of classical nova models). Both options\nmay imply that CVs contribute to the single-degenerate progenitors of Type Ia\nsupernovae. The number of He-core WDs found in CVs (<=10%) is roughly\nconsistent with the number of He-core WDs in pre-CVs (<=17+-8%), which\nindicates a low value of the CE efficiency.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A, 18 pages, 9 figures"]}]

The construction\nof sparse universal graphs for various families F has received a considerable\namount of attention. One is particularly interested in tight F-universal\ngraphs, i.e., graphs whose number of vertices is equal to the largest number of\nvertices in a graph from F. Arguably, the most studied case is that when F is\nsome class of trees.\n  Given integers n and \\Delta, we denote by T(n,\\Delta) the class of all\nn-vertex trees with maximum degree at most \\Delta.

In this case both are\ncharacterizations of the so-called Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity. Moreover,\nwe can characterize a standard graded polynomial ring as an algebra with\nextremal properties with respect to the Tor- and the local-regularity. For\nmodules of finite projective dimension we get a nice formula relating the two\nregularity notions. Interesting examples are given to help to understand the\nrelationship between the Tor- and the local-regularity in general.\n","Comment: 13 pages; Revised version of the paper"]}]

Earlier criticisms of the idea are\ndiscussed and their relevance to the proposal assessed. Several constraints on\nmeasuring apparatus required by \"protective\" measurements are discussed, with\nemphasis on how they may restrict their experimental feasibility. Though\n\"protective\" measurements result in an unchanged system state and a shift of\nthe pointer proportional to the expectation value of the measured observable in\nthe system state, the actual reading of the pointer position gives rise to\nseveral subtleties. We propose several schemes for reading pointer position,\nboth when the apparatus is treated as a classical system as well as when its\nquantum aspects are taken into account, that address these issues. The tiny\nentanglement which is always present due to deviation from extreme adiabaticity\nin realistic situations is argued to be the weakest aspect of the proposal.\nBecause of this, one can never perform a protective measurement on a single\nquantum system with absolute certainty. This clearly precludes an ontological\nstatus for the wave function. Several other conceptual issues are also\ndiscussed.\n","Comment: 14 pages RevTex, published version with change in title"]}]
