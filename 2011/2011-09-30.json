The basic idea of the new approach\nis similar to the Ghost Fluid Method (GFM). The GFM relies on corrections\napplied on nodes located across the interface for discretization stencils that\nstraddle the interface. If the corrections are solution-independent, they can\nbe moved to the right-hand-side (RHS) of the equations, producing a problem\nwith the same linear system as if there were no jumps, only with a different\nRHS. However, achieving high accuracy is very hard (if not impossible) with the\n\"standard\" approaches used to compute the GFM correction terms.\n  In this paper we generalize the GFM correction terms to a correction\nfunction, defined on a band around the interface. This function is then shown\nto be characterized as the solution to a PDE, with appropriate boundary\nconditions. This PDE can, in principle, be solved to any desired order of\naccuracy. As an example, we apply this new method to devise a 4th order\naccurate scheme for the constant coefficients Poisson equation with\ndiscontinuities in 2D. This scheme is based on (i) the standard 9-point stencil\ndiscretization of the Poisson equation, (ii) a representation of the correction\nfunction in terms of bicubics, and (iii) a solution of the correction function\nPDE by a least squares minimization. Several applications of the method are\npresented to illustrate its robustness dealing with a variety of interface\ngeometries, its capability to capture sharp discontinuities, and its high\nconvergence rate.\n","Comment: 59 pages, 42 figures"]}]

The corresponding solution\nentails a complexity upper bound which improves on the one so far available in\nthe multichannel framework.

Our procedure relies\non combining supposedly equivalent PN models at highest available order with\ncommon data in the NR regime, and their difference serves as a measure of the\nuncertainty assumed in each waveform.

Then, among them the\nnodes with less energy and greater overlap with their neighbors have been\nchosen to go to sleep mode, Also, the energy imbalance among sensor nodes is\nreduced by integrating the distance of the nodes from the base station into\nclustering policies.\n","Comment: 6 pages"]}]

DOAS spectra consist of a linear combination of complex\nmulti-peak multi-scale structures. Most DOAS analysis routines in use today are\nbased on least squares techniques, for example, the approach developed in the\n1970s uses polynomial fits to remove a slowly varying background, and known\nreference spectra to retrieve the identity and concentrations of reference\ngases. An open problem is to identify unknown gases in the fitting residuals\nfor complex atmospheric mixtures.\n  In this work, we develop a novel three step semi-blind source separation\nmethod. The first step uses a multi-resolution analysis to remove the\nslow-varying and fast-varying components in the DOAS spectral data matrix $X$.\nThe second step decomposes the preprocessed data $\\hat{X}$ in the first step\ninto a linear combination of the reference spectra plus a remainder, or\n$\\hat{X} = A\\,S + R$, where columns of matrix $A$ are known reference spectra,\nand the matrix $S$ contains the unknown non-negative coefficients that are\nproportional to concentration. The second step is realized by a convex\nminimization problem $S = \\mathrm{arg} \\min \\mathrm{norm}\\,(\\hat{X} - A\\,S)$,\nwhere the norm is a hybrid $\\ell_1/\\ell_2$ norm (Huber estimator) that helps to\nmaintain the non-negativity of $S$. The third step performs a blind independent\ncomponent analysis of the remainder matrix $R$ to extract remnant gas\ncomponents. We first illustrate the proposed method in processing a set of DOAS\nexperimental data by a satisfactory blind extraction of an a-priori unknown\ntrace gas (ozone) from the remainder matrix. Numerical results also show that\nthe method can identify multiple trace gases from the residuals.\n","Comment: submitted to Journal of Scientific Computing"]}]

Previous observation of the\nMira star omicron Ceti around a bright maximum of light led to the detection of\na strong linear polarization associated to Balmer emissions, although the\norigin of this phenomenon is not fully explained yet. With the help of\nspectropolarimetry, we propose to investigate the nature of shock waves\npropagating throughout the stellar atmosphere and present, for omicron Ceti\n(the prototype of Mira stars), a full observational study of hydrogen emission\nlines formed in the radiative region of such a shock.

All Stokes parameters were systematically\ncollected, with a particular emphasis on the maxima of luminosity, i.e. when a\nradiative shock wave is supposed to emerge from the photosphere and propagate\noutward. On Balmer lines, over a large part of the luminosity cycle, we report\ndetections in Stokes spectra which are evolving with time. These signatures\nappear to be strongly correlated to the presence of an intense shock wave\nresponsible for the hydrogen emission lines. We establish that those lines are\npolarized by a process inherent to the mechanism responsible for the emission\nline formation: the shock wave itself. Two mechanisms are considered: a global\none that implies a polarization induced by convective cells located around the\nphotosphere and a local one that implies a charge separation due to the passage\nof the shock wave, inducing an electrical current.

The storage is\nfrictionless as a supply source, but once used, it cannot be filled up\ninstantaneously. The focus application is a power supply network in which the\nbase supply and demand are assumed to match perfectly, while deviations from\nthe base are modeled as random shocks with stochastic arrivals. Due to\nfriction, the random surge shocks cannot be tracked by the main supply sources.\nStorage, when available, can be used to compensate, fully or partially, for the\nsurge in demand or loss of supply. The problem of optimal utilization of\nstorage with the objective of maximizing system reliability is formulated as\nminimization of the expected discounted cost of blackouts over an infinite\nhorizon. It is shown that when the stage cost is linear in the size of the\nblackout, the optimal policy is myopic in the sense that all shocks are\ncompensated by storage up to the available level of storage. However, when the\nstage cost is strictly convex, it may be optimal to curtail some of the demand\nand allow a small current blackout in the interest of maintaining a higher\nlevel of reserve to avoid a large blackout in the future.

However, in the event of a merger,\ngravitational-wave (GW) recoil may displace a SMBH from its galactic center, or\neject it entirely. To explore the consequences of this phenomenon, we use\nhydrodynamic simulations of gaseous galaxy mergers that include a range of BH\nrecoil velocities. We have generated a suite of over 200 simulations with more\nthan 60 merger models, enabling us to identify systematic trends in the\nbehavior of recoiling BHs -- specifically (i) their dynamics, (ii) their\nobservable signatures, and (iii) their effects on BH/galaxy co-evolution. (i)\nRecoiling BH trajectories depend heavily on the gas content of the host galaxy;\nmaximal BH displacements from the center may vary by up to an order of\nmagnitude between gas-rich and gas-poor mergers. In some cases, recoil\ntrajectories also depend on the timing of the BH merger relative to the\nformation of the galaxy merger remnant. (ii) Recoiling BHs may be observable as\noffset active galactic nuclei (AGN) via either kinematic offsets (v > 800 km\ns^-1) or spatial offsets (R > 1 kpc) for lifetimes of about 1 - 100 Myr. In\naddition, recoil events affect the total AGN lifetime. GW recoil generally\nreduces the lifetimes of bright AGN, but may extend lower-luminosity AGN\nlifetimes. (iii) Rapidly-recoiling BHs may be up to about 5 times less massive\nthan their stationary counterparts. These mass deficits lower the normalization\nof the M - sigma relation and contribute to both intrinsic and overall scatter.\nFurthermore, recoil events displace AGN feedback from the galactic center,\nwhich enhances central star formation rates.

In the hard state, the variability can be\nexplained by softening the overall spectrum with a pivot at 50 keV and another,\nindependent variability pattern where the spectral shape does not change when\nthe luminosity changes. In the soft state, the variability is caused by a\nvariable hard tail of a constant shape superimposed on a constant soft\ncomponent.
