At the Swedish 1-m Solar\nTelescope, such a setup is used to scan through the blue wing of the Ca II H\nline. Because the filter is mounted in a converging beam, the incident angle\nvaries over the pupil, which causes a variation of the transmission over the\npupil, different for each wavelength within the passband. This causes\nbroadening of the filter transmission profile and degradation of the image\nquality. Aims.

It is found that the thermal conductivity in\nnarrower DNW is lower and does not show obvious temperature dependence; a very\nsmall value (about 2.0 W/m/K) of thermal conductivity is observed in\nultra-narrow DNW, which may be of potential applications in thermoelectric\ndevices. These two phenomena are probably due to the dominant surface effect\nand phonon confinement effect in narrow DNW. Our simulation reveals a high\nanisotropy in the heat transport of DNW. Specifically, the thermal conductivity\nin DNW along [110] growth direction is about five times larger than that of\n[100] and [111] growth directions. The anisotropy is believed to root in the\nanisotropic group velocity for acoustic phonon modes in DNW along three\ndifferent growth directions.\n","Comment: accepted by PRB"]}]

It is found that a causal system must be\nstable, but an acausal system in the boost frame at high speed must be\nunstable. (2)The transport coefficients can be determined in kinetic theory. We\nwill firstly discuss about derivation of the shear viscosity via variational\nmethod in the Boltzmann equation. Secondly, we will compute the shear viscosity\nvia AdS/CFT duality in a Bjorken boost invariant fluid with radial flow.

Several self-healing algorithms\nhave been suggested recently [IPDPS'08, PODC'08, PODC'09, PODC'11] in a line of\nwork that has yielded gradual improvements in the properties ensured on the\ngraph. This work motivates a strong general phenomenon of edge-preserving\nhealing that aims at obtaining self-healing algorithms with the constraint that\nall original edges in the graph (not deleted by the adversary), be retained in\nevery intermediate graph.\n  The previous algorithms, in their nascent form, are not explicitly edge\npreserving. In this paper, we show they can be suitably modified (We introduce\nXheal+, an edge-preserving version of Xheal[PODC'11]). Towards this end, we\npresent a general self-healing model that unifies the previous models. The main\ncontribution of this paper is not in the technical complexity, rather in the\nsimplicity with which the edge-preserving property can be ensured and the\nmessage that this is a crucial property with several benefits. In particular,\nwe highlight this by showing that, almost as an immediate corollary, subgraph\ndensities are preserved or increased. Maintaining density is a notion motivated\nby the fact that in certain distributed networks, certain nodes may require and\ninitially have a larger number of inter-connections. It is vital that a healing\nalgorithm, even amidst failures, respect these requirements. Our suggested\nmodifications yield such subgraph density preservation as a by product. In\naddition, edge preservation helps maintain any subgraph induced property that\nis monotonic. Also, algorithms that are edge-preserving require minimal\nalteration of edges which can be an expensive cost in healing - something that\nhas not been modeled in any of the past work.\n","Comment: Submitted to IEEE InfoComm"]}]
