This study investigates the tracking dynamics of\ncontinuous attractor neural networks (CANNs). Due to the translational\ninvariance of neuronal recurrent interactions, CANNs can hold a continuous\nfamily of stationary states. They form a continuous manifold in which the\nneural system is neutrally stable. We systematically explore how this property\nfacilitates the tracking performance of a CANN, which is believed to have clear\ncorrespondence with brain functions. By using the wave functions of the quantum\nharmonic oscillator as the basis, we demonstrate how the dynamics of a CANN is\ndecomposed into different motion modes, corresponding to distortions in the\namplitude, position, width or skewness of the network state. We then develop a\nperturbative approach that utilizes the dominating movement of the network's\nstationary states in the state space. This method allows us to approximate the\nnetwork dynamics up to an arbitrary accuracy depending on the order of\nperturbation used. We quantify the distortions of a Gaussian bump during\ntracking, and study their effects on the tracking performance.

At\npresent, little is known about how cortical growth affects the development of\nneuronal circuits. Here, in acute and chronic experiments, we study the layout\nof ocular dominance (OD) columns in cat primary visual cortex (V1) during a\nperiod of substantial postnatal growth. We find that despite a considerable\nsize increase of V1, the spacing between columns is largely preserved. In\ncontrast, their spatial arrangement changes systematically over this period.\nWhile in young animals columns are more band-like, layouts become more\nisotropic in mature animals. We propose a novel mechanism of growth-induced\nreorganization that is based on the `zigzag instability', a dynamical\ninstability observed in several inanimate pattern forming systems. We argue\nthat this mechanism is inherent to a wide class of models for the\nactivity-dependent formation of OD columns. Analyzing one member of this class,\nthe Elastic Network model, we show that this mechanism can account for the\npreservation of column spacing and the specific mode of reorganization of OD\ncolumns that we observe. We conclude that neurons systematically shift their\nselectivities during normal development and that this reorganization is induced\nby the cortical expansion during growth.

These lines include a blue-shifted\nabsorption component at ~ -125 km/s. The He I and metal-line profiles are\ndouble-peaked, with a likely origin in a circumstellar disk.

While the general claim is\ncorrect, the discussions have been incomplete and, sometimes, misleading. The\ndiscussions have been of three kinds. Type 1 examines the time dependence of\nthe survival probability for 3-momentum eigenstates of the unstable quanton\n(Khalfin). Type 2 does the same for velocity eigenstates, obtaining an\noutrageous result which then discredits velocity eigenstates (Shirokov /\nHegerfeldt). Type 3 examines arbitrary boosts of 3-momentum eigenstates\n(Stefanovich). Type 1 is incomplete since the momentum eigenstates are not the\nboosts of one another. Type 2 is misleading since the outrageous result is due\nto misinterpreting the initial conditions of the velocity eigenstates (as I\nhave previously argued). Type 3 is the most satisfactory, but has failed to\nrecognize and implement the unification of all three types of discussion that\ncan be achieved. In this paper I will provide that unified treatment, beginning\nwith a recapitulation of Type 1 and offering further clarification of Type 2 in\nthe process.
