The generation of communities can easily be repeated for many values\nof resolution; thus allowing different views on the network at different\nresolutions.

In our tests, this approach results in characteristic\nranges of resolution where a large resolution change does not lead to a growth\nof the natural community.

In the test-mass limit,\nwell-defined ISCO conditions exist for the Kerr and Schwarzschild spacetimes.\nIn the finite-mass case, there are a large variety of ways to define an ISCO in\na post-Newtonian (PN) context. Here I generalize the gauge-invariant ISCO\ncondition of Blanchet & Iyer (2003) to the case of spinning (nonprecessing)\nbinaries. The Blanchet-Iyer ISCO condition has two desirable and unexpected\nproperties: (1) it exactly reproduces the Schwarzschild ISCO in the test-mass\nlimit, and (2) it accurately approximates the recently-calculated shift in the\nSchwarzschild ISCO frequency due to the conservative-piece of the gravitational\nself-force [Barack & Sago (2009)]. The generalization of this ISCO condition to\nspinning binaries has the property that it also exactly reproduces the Kerr\nISCO in the test-mass limit (up to the order at which PN spin corrections are\ncurrently known). The shift in the ISCO due to the spin of the test-particle is\nalso calculated. Remarkably, the gauge-invariant PN ISCO condition exactly\nreproduces the ISCO shift predicted by the Papapetrou equations for a\nfully-relativistic spinning particle. It is surprising that an analysis of the\nstability of the standard PN equations of motion is able (without any form of\n\"resummation\") to accurately describe strong-field effects of the Kerr\nspacetime. The ISCO frequency shift due to the conservative self-force in Kerr\nis also calculated from this new ISCO condition, as well as from the\neffective-one-body Hamiltonian of Barausse & Buonanno (2010).

The physical\nimplications of this abundance of symmetry remain unclear. In recent work, it\nhas been shown how these chiral symmetries for overlap fermions can be derived\nfrom a renormalisation group blocking in the continuum, transforming the action\nfrom the standard continuum action to an equivalent to the lattice overlap\naction. There is no unique blocking, and different blockings lead to different\nchiral symmetries. The group of symmetries found by Mandula immediately\nfollows. In this way, the excess chiral symmetry on the lattice can be\nexplained in terms of different renormalisation schemes.\n  The previous work suffered from one technical challenge: there is no\ncontinuum analogue of the lattice chiral eigenvectors at eigenvalue $2/a$. As\nthe construction of the overlap operator required a mapping between lattice and\ncontinuum eigenvalues, the lack of a continuum counterpart to the doublers of\nthe zero modes creates an ambiguity in the construction. Although the lattice\nchiral symmetry can still be defined, this leads to difficulties when\nconsidering $\\mathcal{CP}$ symmetry on the lattice. In this work, we\ninvestigate the possibility of resolving this ambiguity by adding a second\nfermion field to the original continuum action used as a basis of the\nrenormalisation group blockings. This second fermion field has a mass of the\norder of the momentum cut-off, to simulate the effects of the fermion doublers.\nWorking through the same renormalisation group procedure to map this action to\nthe lattice overlap action yields additional Ginsparg-Wilson relations\nsatisfied by the overlap operator, and more (non-commuting) lattice chiral\nsymmetries.\n","Comment: 24 pages"]}]

We call this transformation of $(Y,Z)$ into $(U,V)$ the\npartial copula transform. It is easy to show that if $Y$ and $Z$ are continuous\nfor any given value of $X$, then $Y\\ind Z|X$ implies $U\\ind V$. Conditional\nindependence can then be tested by (i) applying the partial copula transform to\nthe data points and (ii) applying a test of ordinary independence to the\ntransformed data. In practice, $F_{Y|X}$ and $F_{Z|X}$ will need to be\nestimated, which can be done by, e.g., standard kernel methods. We show that\nunder easily satisfied conditions, and for a very large class of test\nstatistics for independence which includes the covariance, Kendall's tau, and\nHoeffding's test statistic, the effect of this estimation vanishes\nasymptotically. Thus, for large samples, the estimation can be ignored and we\nhave a simple method which can be used to apply a wide range of tests of\nindependence, including ones with consistency for arbitrary alternatives, to\ntest for conditional independence. A simulation study indicates good small\nsample performance. Advantages of the partial copula approach compared to\ncompetitors seem to be simplicity and generality.\n"]}]

At classical level, for\nan observer in the CM frame of UHECR and atmospheric hadrons, color charge\nsources are contracted to a thin sheet with a width inversely proportional to\nthe energy of the ultra energetic cosmic ray hadron and consequently they can\nsee an extra dimension with comparable size. Due to QCD interaction a short\nlife swarm of partons is produced in front of the sheet and its partons can\npenetrate to the extra-dimension bulk. This reduces the effective density of\npartons on the brane or in a classical view creates a delay in the arrival of\nthe most energetic particles if they are reflected back due to the warping of\nthe bulk. In CGC approximation the density of swarm at different distance from\nthe classical sheet can be related and therefore it is possible (at least\nformally) to determine the relative fraction of partons in the bulk and on the\nbrane at different scales.

The quadratic and quartic terms\nin the anomalous moments can fit to the rise of a deviation with transverse\nenergy. Since previous analyses have been done on the top quark total cross\nsection, here we assume the same moment on all quarks except the top and find\nthe range $|\\kappa'| \\equiv |\\kappa/(2 m_q)| = 1.0\\pm 0.3$ TeV$^{-1}$ for the\nCDF data. Assuming the anomalous moment is present only on a charm or bottom\nquark which is pair produced results in a range $|\\kappa'_{b,c}| = 3.5 \\pm 1.0\n$ TeV$^{-1}$.

We assume\ntwo qubits are initially in Werner state or Werner-like state, and find that\nthermal environment can make two qubits become stationary nonlocality. The\nanalytical relations among average thermal photon number of the environment,\nentanglement and nonlocality of two qubits are given in details. It is shown\nthat the fraction of Bell singlet state plays a key role in the phenomenon that\nthe common thermal reservoir can enhance the entanglement of two qubits.\nMoreover, we find that the collective decay of two qubits in a thermal\nreservoir at zero-temperature can generate a stationary maximally entangled\nmixed state if only the fraction of Bell singlet state in the initial state is\nnot smaller than 2/3. It provides us a feasible way to prepare the maximally\nentangled mixed state in various physical systems such as the trapped ions,\nquantum dots or Josephson Junctions. For the case in which two qutrits\ncollectively coupled with the thermal reservoir at zero-temperature, we find\nthat the collective decay can induce the entanglement of two qutrits initially\nin the maximally mixed state. The collective decay of two qutrits can also\ninduce distillable entanglement from the initial conjectured negative partial\ntranspose bound entangled states.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 8 figures, RevTex4, a reference is added and change the\n  email address"]}]
