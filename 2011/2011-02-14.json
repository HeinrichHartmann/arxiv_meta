Following\nthe approach of Black and Cox, one defines the time of default to be the first\npassage time for the log-leverage ratio to cross the level zero. Rather than\nadopt the classical notion of first passage, with its associated numerical\nchallenges, we accept an alternative notion applicable for TCBMs called \"first\npassage of the second kind\". We demonstrate how statistical inference can be\nefficiently implemented in this new class of models. This allows us to compare\nthe performance of two versions of TCBMs, the variance gamma (VG) model and the\nexponential jump model (EXP), to the Black-Cox model. When applied to a 4.5\nyear long data set of weekly credit default swap (CDS) quotes for Ford Motor\nCo, the conclusion is that the two TCBM models, with essentially one extra\nparameter, can significantly outperform the classic Black-Cox model.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables"]}]

The model is the first member of the principal series of the recently\nintroduced logarithmic minimal models. The key to the solution is a functional\nequation in the form of an inversion identity satisfied by the commuting\ndouble-row transfer matrices. This is established directly in the planar\nTemperley-Lieb algebra and holds independently of the space of link states on\nwhich the transfer matrices act. Different sectors are obtained by acting on\nlink states with s-1 defects where s=1,2,3,... is an extended Kac label. The\nbulk and boundary free energies and finite-size corrections are obtained from\nthe Euler-Maclaurin formula. The eigenvalues of the transfer matrix are\nclassified by the physical combinatorics of the patterns of zeros in the\ncomplex spectral-parameter plane. This yields a selection rule for the\nphysically relevant solutions to the inversion identity and explicit finitized\ncharacters for the associated quasi-rational representations. In particular, in\nthe scaling limit, we confirm the central charge c=-2 and conformal weights\nDelta_s=((2-s)^2-1)/8 for s=1,2,3,....

Courant showed\nthat one half of Sturm's theorem for the strings applies to the theory of\nmembranes: N-th eigenfunction cannot have more than N domains. He also gave an\nexample of a eigenfunction high in the spectrum with a minimal number of nodal\ndomains, thus excluding the existence of a non-trivial lower bound. An analogue\nof Sturm's result for discretizations of the interval was discussed by\nGantmacher and Krein. The discretization of an interval is a graph of a simple\nform, a chain-graph. But what can be said about more complicated graphs? It has\nbeen known since the early 90s that the nodal count for a generic eigenfunction\nof the Schrodinger operator on quantum trees (where each edge is identified\nwith an interval of the real line and some matching conditions are enforced on\nthe vertices) is exact too: zeros of the N-th eigenfunction divide the tree\ninto exactly N subtrees. We discuss two extensions of this result in two\ndirections. One deals with the same continuous Schrodinger operator but on\ngeneral graphs (i.e. non-trees) and another deals with discrete Schrodinger\noperator on combinatorial graphs (both trees and non-trees). The result that we\nderive applies to both types of graphs: the number of nodal domains of the N-th\neigenfunction is bounded below by N-L, where L is the number of links that\ndistinguish the graph from a tree (defined as the dimension of the cycle space\nor the rank of the fundamental group of the graph). We also show that if it the\ngenericity condition is dropped, the nodal count can fall arbitrarily far below\nthe number of the corresponding eigenfunction.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 4 figures; Minor corrections: added 2 important references"]}]
