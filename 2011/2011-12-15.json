In habitats that remain stable over many\ngenerations, stabilizing selection reduces trait differences within\npopulations, thereby appearing to remove the diversity needed for heritable\nadaptive responses in new environments. Paradoxically, field studies have\ndocumented numerous populations under long periods of stabilizing selection and\nevolutionary stasis that have rapidly evolved under changed environmental\nconditions. In this article, we review how cryptic genetic variation (CGV)\nresolves this diversity paradox by allowing populations in a stable environment\nto gradually accumulate hidden genetic diversity that is revealed as trait\ndifferences when environments change. Instead of being in conflict,\nenvironmental stasis supports CGV accumulation and thus appears to facilitate\nrapid adaptation in new environments as suggested by recent CGV studies.\nSimilarly, degeneracy has been found to support both genetic and non-genetic\nadaptation at many levels of biological organization. Degenerate, as opposed to\ndiverse or redundant, ensembles appear functionally redundant in certain\nenvironmental contexts but functionally diverse in others. CGV and degeneracy\nparadigms for adaptation are integrated in this review, revealing a common set\nof principles that support adaptation at multiple levels of biological\norganization. Though a discussion of simulation studies, molecular-based\nexperimental systems, principles from population genetics, and field\nexperiments, we demonstrate that CGV and degeneracy reflect complementary\ntop-down and bottom-up, respectively, conceptualizations of the same basic\nphenomenon and arguably capture a universal feature of biological adaptive\nprocesses.\n"]}]

As a result of the many new pulsar discoveries, the gamma-ray\npulsar population is now approaching 100. Some very famous millisecond pulsars\n(MSPs) have also been detected: J1939+2134 (B1937+21), the first MSP ever\ndiscovered, as well as J1959+2048 (B1957+20), the first black widow pulsar\nsystem. These, along with other MSPs such as PSR J0034-0534 and J2214+3000, are\nrare among the pulsar population in that they exhibit nearly phase-aligned\nradio and gamma-ray light curves (LCs). Traditionally, pulsar LCs have been\nmodelled using standard HE models in conjunction with low-altitude conal beam\nradio models. However, a different approach is needed to account for\nphase-aligned LCs. We explored two scenarios: one where both the radio and\ngamma-ray emission originate in the outer magnetosphere, and one where the\nemission comes from near the polar caps (PCs) on the stellar surface. We find\nbest-fit LCs using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique for the first\nclass of models. The first scenario seems to be somewhat preferred, as is also\nhinted at by the radio polarization data. This implies that the phase-aligned\nLCs are possibly of caustic origin produced in the outer magnetosphere, in\ncontrast to the usual lower-altitude conal beam radio models. Lastly, we\nconstrain the emission altitudes with typical uncertainties of ~10% of the\nlight cylinder radius.

In most cases, it\nis believed that the post-Newtonian expansion is asymptotically divergent. A\nstandard technique for accelerating the convergence of a power series is to\nre-sum the series by means of a rational polynomial called a Pad\\'e\napproximation. If we liken this approximation to a matrix, the best convergence\nis achieved by staying close to a diagonal Pad\\'e approximation. This broadly\npresents two subsets of the approximation : a super-diagonal approximation\n$P^M_N$ and a sub-diagonal approximation $P_M^N$, where $M = N+\\epsilon$, and\n$\\epsilon$ takes the values of 0 or 1.
