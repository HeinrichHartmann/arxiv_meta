For the present study we select a homogeneous\nsample covering about 675 square degrees in the direction of the NGP. It\ncontains nearly 670,000 MS stars with apparent magnitudes between 15 and 20.5\nmag and spectral classes later than G5. The data were taken from the SDSS. We\nconstruct the two-point correlation function (2PCF) for angular separations\nbetween 2 and 30 arcsecs. The resulting clustering signal is modeled by means\nof the Wasserman-Weinberg technique. We show that the distribution of\nsemi-major axis is consistent with the canonical Oepik law and infer that about\n10% of all stars in the solar neighbourhood belong to a WB system. To reduce\nthe noise from optical pairs and to increase the sensitivity of the analysis at\nlarger separations, we include distance information from photometric\nparallaxes. Introducing a novel weighting procedure based on the binding\nprobability of a double star, we infer the distribution of colours and mass\nratios, which were carefully corrected for observational selection effects.\nAbout 4,000 WBs were taken into account statistically, whose components have\nmasses between 0.2 and 0.85 solar masses. We find that the WB colour\ndistribution is in accord with the colour distribution of single field stars.\nHowever, pairs with a mass difference exceeding 0.5 solar masses seem to be\nsystematically underrepresented as compared to a random pairing of field stars.\nOur results are broadly in agreement with prior studies but a direct comparison\nis difficult and often impossible. The novel procedure presented in this thesis\ncan be regarded as complementary to common proper motion studies, and\nconstitutes a viable approach to study the statistical properties of WBs in the\nGalactic field.\n","Comment: 163 pages, PhD thesis"]}]
