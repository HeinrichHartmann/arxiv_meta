Whether an underlying tendency of charges\nto order is present in all cuprates and whether this has any relationship with\nsuperconductivity are, however, two highly controversial issues. In order to\nuncover underlying electronic orders, magnetic fields strong enough to\ndestabilise superconductivity can be used. Such experiments, including quantum\noscillations in YBa2Cu3Oy (a notoriously clean cuprate where charge order is\nnot observed) have suggested that superconductivity competes with spin, rather\nthan charge, order. Here, using nuclear magnetic resonance, we demonstrate that\nhigh magnetic fields actually induce charge order, without spin order, in the\nCuO2 planes of YBa2Cu3Oy. The observed static, unidirectional, modulation of\nthe charge density breaks translational symmetry, thus explaining quantum\noscillation results, and we argue that it is most likely the same 4a-periodic\nmodulation as in stripe-ordered cuprates. The discovery that it develops only\nwhen superconductivity fades away and near the same 1/8th hole doping as in\nLa2-xBaxCuO4 suggests that charge order, although visibly pinned by CuO chains\nin YBa2Cu3Oy, is an intrinsic propensity of the superconducting planes of high\nTc cuprates.\n","Comment: For a final version, see\n  http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v477/n7363/full/nature10345.html"]}]

The most powerful\none-sided upper confidence limit at 95% C.L. is UL = x+1.64s, which I refer to\nas the \"original diagonal line\". Perceived problems in HEP with small or\nnon-physical upper limits for x<0 historically led, for example, to\nsubstitution of max(0,x) for x, and eventually to abandonment in the Particle\nData Group's Review of Particle Physics of this diagonal line relationship\nbetween UL and x.

Thus it is\ntimely to consider again what is problematic about the original diagonal line,\nand whether or not modifications cure these defects. In a 2002 Comment,\nstatistician Leon Jay Gleser pointed to the literature on recognizable and\nrelevant subsets. For upper limits given by the original diagonal line, the\nsample space for x has recognizable relevant subsets in which the quoted 95%\nC.L. is known to be negatively biased (anti-conservative) by a finite amount\nfor all values of mu. This issue is at the heart of a dispute between Jerzy\nNeyman and Sir Ronald Fisher over fifty years ago, the crux of which is the\nrelevance of pre-data coverage probabilities when making post-data inferences.\nThe literature describes illuminating connections to Bayesian statistics as\nwell. Methods such as that advocated by CCGV have 100% unconditional coverage\nfor certain values of mu and hence formally evade the traditional criteria for\nnegatively biased relevant subsets; I argue that concerns remain.

In addition, since\nthese tasks can require integrating multiple sources of remote information ?\ntypically, a slow, I/O-bound process ? it is desirable to make execution as\nefficient as possible. To address both of these needs, we present a flexible\nsoftware agent plan language and a highly parallel execution system that enable\nthe efficient execution of expressive agent plans. The plan language allows\ncomplex tasks to be more easily expressed by providing a variety of operators\nfor flexibly processing the data as well as supporting subplans (for\nmodularity) and recursion (for indeterminate looping). The executor is based on\na streaming dataflow model of execution to maximize the amount of operator and\ndata parallelism possible at runtime.

Our results from testing THESEUS show that\nstreaming dataflow execution can yield significant speedups over both\ntraditional serial (von Neumann) as well as non-streaming dataflow-style\nexecution that existing software and robot agent execution systems currently\nsupport. In addition, we show how plans written in the language we present can\nrepresent certain types of subtasks that cannot be accomplished using the\nlanguages supported by network query engines.

It is used widely in practice, for example, for power\nallocation to sub-carriers in multi-user OFDM systems such as WiMax. The\nclassic water-filling algorithm is deterministic and requires perfect knowledge\nof the channel gain to noise ratios. In this paper we consider how to do power\nallocation over stochastically time-varying (i.i.d.) channels with unknown gain\nto noise ratio distributions. We adopt an online learning framework based on\nstochastic multi-armed bandits. We consider two variations of the problem, one\nin which the goal is to find a power allocation to maximize $\\sum\\limits_i\n\\mathbb{E}[\\log(1 + SNR_i)]$, and another in which the goal is to find a power\nallocation to maximize $\\sum\\limits_i \\log(1 + \\mathbb{E}[SNR_i])$. For the\nfirst problem, we propose a \\emph{cognitive water-filling} algorithm that we\ncall CWF1. We show that CWF1 obtains a regret (defined as the cumulative gap\nover time between the sum-rate obtained by a distribution-aware genie and this\npolicy) that grows polynomially in the number of channels and logarithmically\nin time, implying that it asymptotically achieves the optimal time-averaged\nrate that can be obtained when the gain distributions are known. For the second\nproblem, we present an algorithm called CWF2, which is, to our knowledge, the\nfirst algorithm in the literature on stochastic multi-armed bandits to exploit\nnon-linear dependencies between the arms.
