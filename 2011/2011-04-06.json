This paper is divided into two parts, which are\nclosely related to each other. In the first part, we discuss the statistical\nmechanical model of crystal melting counting BPS states. Each of the BPS state\ncontributing to the BPS index is in one-to-one correspondence with a\nconfiguration of a molten crystal, and the statistical partition function of\nthe melting crystal gives the BPS partition function. We also show that smooth\ngeometry of the Calabi-Yau manifold emerges in the thermodynamic limit of the\ncrystal. This suggests a remarkable interpretation that an atom in the crystal\nis a discretization of the classical geometry, giving an important clue as to\nthe geometry at the Planck scale.In the second part we discuss the wall\ncrossing phenomena. Wall crossing phenomena states that the BPS index depends\non the value of the moduli of the Calabi-Yau manifold, and jumps along real\ncodimension one subspaces in the moduli space. We show that by using type\nIIA/M-theory duality, we can provide a simple and an intuitive derivation of\nthe wall crossing phenomena, furthermore clarifying the connection with the\ntopological string theory. This derivation is consistent with another\nderivation from the wall crossing formula, motivated by multi-centered BPS\nextremal black holes. We also explain the representation of the wall crossing\nphenomena in terms of crystal melting, and the generalization of the counting\nproblem and the wall crossing to the open BPS invariants.\n","Comment: PhD thesis, 129 pages, 39 figures, comments welcome; v2: typos\n  corrected, references added, now in IJMPA format; v3: figures corrected"]}]

In our setting, the\nmore trusted a data miner is, the less perturbed copy of the data it can\naccess. Under this setting, a malicious data miner may have access to\ndifferently perturbed copies of the same data through various means, and may\ncombine these diverse copies to jointly infer additional information about the\noriginal data that the data owner does not intend to release. Preventing such\n\\emph{diversity attacks} is the key challenge of providing MLT-PPDM services.\nWe address this challenge by properly correlating perturbation across copies at\ndifferent trust levels.

That is, for data miners who have\naccess to an arbitrary collection of the perturbed copies, our solution prevent\nthem from jointly reconstructing the original data more accurately than the\nbest effort using any individual copy in the collection.

Some methods,\nsuch as image-guided radiation therapy and dose-guided radiation therapy, aimto\ncompensate thismissing information through periodic CT acquisitions. The aimis\nto adapt patient's position, beam configuration or prescribed dose for a\ndosimetric compliance. Methods. -We evaluated organmotion (and repletion) for\n54 patients after having computed the original ballistic on a new CT scan\nacquisition. A new delineation was done on the prostate, bladder and rectum to\ndetermine the newdisplacements and define organ dosesmistakes (equivalent\nuniformdose, average dose and dose-volume histograms). Results. - The new CT\nacquisitions confirmed that bladder and rectal volumes were not constant during\nsessions. Some cases showed that previously validated treatment plan became\nunsuitable. A proposed solution is to correct dosimetries when bladder volume\nmodifications are significant. The result is an improvement for the stability\nof bladder doses, D50 error is reduced by 25.3%, mean dose error by 5.1% and\nequivalent uniform dose error by 2.6%. For the rectum this method decreases\nerrors by only 1%. This process can reduce the risk of mismatch between the\ninitial scan and following treatment sessions. Conclusion. - For the\nproposedmethod, the cone-beamCT is necessary to properly position the isocenter\nand to quantify bladder and rectal volume variation and deposited doses. The\ndosimetries are performed in the event that bladder (or rectum) volume\nmodification limits are exceeded. To identify these limits, we have calculated\nthat a tolerance of 10% for the equivalent uniformdose (compared to the initial\nvalue of the first dosimetry), this represents 11% of obsolete dosimetries for\nthe bladder, and 4% for the rectum.\n"]}]

We propose a model for the\nUHECR contribution from the spin-down power of black holes (BHs) in LLAGN,\nwhich present a jet power $P_{\\mathrm{j}} \\leqslant 10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$. This\nis in contrast to the opinion that only high-luminosity AGN can accelerate\nparticles to energies $ \\geqslant 50$ EeV. We rewrite the equations which\ndescribe the synchrotron self-absorbed emission of a non-thermal particle\ndistribution to obtain the observed radio flux density from flat-spectrum core\nsources and its relationship to the jet power. In general, the jet power\nprovides the UHECR luminosity and so, its relationship to the observed radio\nflux density. We found that the UHECR luminosity is dependent on the observed\nradio flux density, the distance to the AGN, and the BH mass, where the\nparticle acceleration regions can be sustained by the magnetic energy\nextraction from spinning BHs and where the strength of the magnetic field at\nthe sites of particle acceleration scales with the maximum value of the BH\nmagnetic field, which is $\\sim 10^4$ gauss for a BH of $10^9 M_{\\odot}$.
