The formation of molecular bound states and\nthe ferromagnetic transition of the excited scattering state are examined\nsystematically as a function of the 2-body scattering length. Identification of\nthe upper branch (scattering states) is discussed and a general approach valid\nfor systems with many particles is given. We show that an adiabatic\nferromagnetic transition occurs, but at a critical transition point kF a much\nhigher than predicted from previous calculations, almost all of which use the\nscattering length approximation. In the 4-particle system the discrepancy is a\nfactor of 2. The exact critical interaction strength calculated in the\n4-particle system is consistent with that reported by experiment.

We\nobserve that the transition voltage depends significantly on the length, but\nthat the ratio between the transition voltage and the conducting frontier\norbital is approximately constant only in strongly screening (conjugated)\nmolecules. Uncertainty about the screening within a molecule thus limits the\npredictive power of TVS.

An abundance\nanalysis of the white dwarf spectrum yields accretion rates that are consistent\nwith mass loss from the secondary due to a stellar wind. The second and\nstronger Halpha component is attributed to stellar activity on the secondary\nstar. An active secondary is likely to be present because of the occurrence of\na flare in our time-resolved spectroscopy.

The survivability criterion\nrequires that a feasible flow must still exists (i.e. all demands can be\nsatisfied without violating arc capacities) even after the disruption of a\nsubset of the network's arcs. Specifically, we consider the case in which a\ndisruption (random or malicious) can destroy a subset of the arcs, with the\ncost of the disruption not to exceed a disruption budget. This problem takes\nthe form of a tri-level, two-player game, in which the network operator designs\n(or augments) the network, then the attacker launches a disruption that\ndestroys a subset of arcs, and then the network operator attempts to find a\nfeasible flow over the residual network.

It is suggested that\nthe \"physical\" degrees of freedom, which explain the entropy $S^{BH}$, form\nonly a finite subset of the standard Rindler-like modes defined outside the\nblack hole horizon. The entropy $S_R$ of the Rindler modes, or entanglement\nentropy, is always ultraviolet divergent, while the entropy of the \"physical\"\nmodes is finite and it coincides in the induced gravity with $S^{BH}$. The two\nentropies $S^{BH}$ and $S_R$ differ by a surface integral Q interpreted as a\nNoether charge of non-minimally coupled scalar constituents of the model. We\ndemonstrate that energy E and Hamiltonian H of the fields localized in a part\nof space-time, restricted by the Killing horizon $\\Sigma$, differ by the\nquantity $T_H Q$, where $T_H$ is the temperature of a black hole. The first law\nof the black hole thermodynamics enables one to relate the probability\ndistribution of fluctuations of the black hole mass, caused by the quantum\nfluctuations of the fields, to the probability distribution of \"physical\" modes\nover energy E. The latter turns out to be different from the distribution of\nthe Rindler modes. We show that the probability distribution of the \"physical\"\ndegrees of freedom has a sharp peak at E=0 with the width proportional to the\nPlanck mass. The logarithm of number of \"physical\" states at the peak coincides\nexactly with the black hole entropy $S^{BH}$. It enables us to argue that the\nenergy distribution of the \"physical\" modes and distribution of the black hole\nmass are equivalent in the induced gravity. Finally it is shown that the\nNoether charge Q is related to the entropy of the low frequency modes\npropagating in the vicinity of the bifurcation surface $\\Sigma$ of the horizon.\n","Comment: 28 pages, Latex file"]}]
