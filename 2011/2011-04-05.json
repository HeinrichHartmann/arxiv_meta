The analysis is based on two-dimensional kinematic\nmaps extending out to 1.7 effective radii obtained from Keck spectroscopy, on\nlensing geometry and on stellar mass estimates obtained from multiband Hubble\nSpace Telescope imaging. The data are modelled under the assumptions of axial\nsymmetry supported by a two-integral distribution function (DF), by applying\nthe combined gravitational lensing and stellar dynamics code CAULDRON, and\nyielding high-quality constraints for an early-type galaxy at cosmological\nredshifts. Modelling the total density profile as a power-law of the form\nrho_tot ~ 1/r^{gamma}, we find that it is nearly isothermal (logarithmic slope\ngamma = 2.08^{+0.04}_{-0.02}), and quite flattened (axial ratio q =\n0.60^{+0.08}_{-0.03}). The galaxy is mildly anisotropic (delta = 0.08 +/- 0.02)\nand shows a fair amount of rotational support, in particular towards the outer\nregions. We determine a dark matter fraction lower limit of 28 per cent within\nthe effective radius. The stellar contribution to the total mass distribution\nis close to maximal for a Chabrier initial mass function (IMF), whereas for a\nSalpeter IMF the stellar mass exceeds the total mass within the galaxy inner\nregions. We find that the combination of a NFW dark matter halo with the\nmaximally rescaled luminous profile provides a remarkably good fit to the total\nmass distribution over a broad radial range. Our results confirm and expand the\nfindings of the SLACS survey for early-type galaxies of comparable velocity\ndispersion (sigma_SDSS = 214 +/- 11 km/s). The internal structure of J0728 is\nconsistent with that of local early-type galaxies of comparable velocity\ndispersion as measured by the SAURON project, suggesting lack of evolution in\nthe past two billion years.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 10 figures.

In the framework of\nthe QCB model, we formulate a self-consistent system of coupled equations for\nthe nucleon and 6QS propagators in nuclear matter and the G-matrix. The\napproach provides a link between high-density nuclear matter with the MQS\ncomponents and the cumulative effect observed in reactions on the nuclei, which\nrequires the admixture of MQS in the wave functions of nuclei kinematically.\n  6QS determine the natural scale of the density for a possible phase\ntransition into the MQS phase of nuclear matter. Such a phase transition can\nlead to dynamic instability of newly born protoneutron stars and dramatically\naffect the dynamics of supernovae. Numerical simulations show that the phase\ntransition may be a good remedy for the triggering supernova explosions in the\nspherically symmetric supernova models. A specific signature of the phase\ntransition is an additional neutrino peak in the neutrino light curve. For a\nGalactic core-collapse supernova, such a peak could be resolved by the present\nneutrino detectors.

The measurement\nprotocols usually involve an amplification chain which relies on circulators to\nseparate input and output channels and to suppress backaction from different\nstages on the sample under test. In these devices the usual reciprocal symmetry\nof circuits is broken by the phenomenon of Faraday rotation based on magnetic\nmaterials and fields. However, magnets are averse to on-chip integration, and\nmagnetic fields are deleterious to delicate superconducting devices. Here we\npresent a new proposal combining two stages of parametric modulation emulating\nthe action of a circulator. It is devoid of magnetic components and suitable\nfor on-chip integration. As the design is free of any dissipative elements and\nbased on reversible operation, the device operates noiselessly, giving it an\nimportant advantage over other nonreciprocal active devices for quantum\ninformation processing applications.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 4 figures + 12 pages Supplementary Information"]}]

The kink state is stable with respect to such deformations\nand homogeneous state in the magnetic field is only stable within a certain\nrange of frequencies and fields. Stability with respect to the long-range\ndeformations is controlled by resonance excitations of fast modes at finite\nwave vectors and typically leads to unstable range of the wave-vectors.

Since traditional network measures (e.g., betweenness centrality)\nutilize a discrete link structure, complex systems must be transformed to this\nrepresentation in order to investigate network properties. However, in many\ndomains there may be uncertainty about the relationship structure and any\nuncertainty information would be lost in translation to a discrete\nrepresentation. Uncertainty may arise in domains where there is moderating link\ninformation that cannot be easily observed, i.e., links become inactive over\ntime but may not be dropped or observed links may not always corresponds to a\nvalid relationship. In order to represent and reason with these types of\nuncertainty, we move beyond the discrete graph framework and develop social\nnetwork measures based on a probabilistic graph representation.

The main consequence of ionization\nis the reduction of the maximum energy which ions can achieve with respect to\nthe standard result of the DSA. In fact the photo-ionization has a timescale\ncomparable to the beginning of the Sedov-Taylor phase, hence the maximum energy\nis no more proportional to the nuclear charge, as predicted by standard DSA,\nbut rather to the effective ions' charge during the acceleration process, which\nis smaller than the total nuclear charge $Z_N$. This result can have a direct\nconsequence in the prediction of the knee structure of the cosmic ray spectrum.\nMoreover the acceleration of ultra-heavy elements beyond the Iron's maximum\nenergy is very hard to achieve making unlikely their possible contribution to\nthe cosmic ray spectrum in the transition region between Galactic and\nextragalactic component.\n","Comment: 7 pages, Contributed talk to the 25th Texas Symposium on Relativistic\n  Astrophysics; Dec. 6-10, 2010; Heidelberg (Germany).

Both methods\nsuffer from degeneracies, however, that are difficult to break. In this paper,\nwe present a new framework that self-consistently unifies gravitational lensing\nand stellar dynamics. This approach breaks some of classical degeneracies that\nhave limited their individual usage, in particular in the study of\nhigh-redshift galaxies. The methodology is based on the premise that, for any\ngiven galaxy potential, the mapping of both the unknown lensed source\nbrightness distribution and the stellar phase-space distribution function on to\nthe photometric and kinematic observables, can be cast as a single set of\ncoupled linear equations. This set of linear equations is solved, maximizing\nthe likelihood penalty function. The evidence penalty function, as derived from\nBayesian statistics, subsequently allows the best potential-model parameters to\nbe found and potential-model families, or other model assumptions (e.g. PSF),\nto be quantitatively ranked. We have implemented a fast algorithm that solves\nfor the maximum-likelihood pixelized lensed source brightness distribution and\nthe two-integral stellar phase-space distribution function f(E, L_z), assuming\naxisymmetric potentials. To make the method practical, we have devised a new\nMonte-Carlo approach to Schwarzschild's orbital superposition method, based on\nthe superposition of two-integral (E and L_z) toroidal components, to find the\nmaximum-likelihood two-integral distribution function in a matter of seconds in\nany axisymmetric potential.

A tropical curve in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ corresponds\nto an immersion from a tropical curve to $\\mathbb{R}^2$. In this paper, we show\nthat any principal divisor on a tropical curve is the restriction of a\nprincipal divisor on the ambient plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n","Comment: 18 pages, journal version"]}]
