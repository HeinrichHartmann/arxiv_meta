We show that a simple exclusion of the radiative component of EM\nfield produced by bound particles leads to a violation of the energy-momentum\nconservation law, if the non-radiative EM field is left unmodified. In order to\nrestore the energy-momentum conservation, we make a closer look at the\ninteraction of two hypothetical classical charges with the prohibited radiation\ncomponent of their EM field and bring the appropriate modifications in the\nstructure of their bound EM field and, accordingly, in the Hamilton function of\nthis system. In comparison with the common Hamilton function for the one-body\nproblem, the electric interaction energy is multiplied by the Lorentz factor of\norbiting charged particle, and its rest mass m is replaced by an effective rest\nmass parameter, which includes the interaction EM energy. We introduce, as a\nnovel postulate, these replacements into the Dirac equation for the bound\nelectron and show that the solution of the modified Dirac Coulomb equation\ngives the same gross and fine structure of energy levels, as the one furnished\nby the conventional approach, for hydrogen-like atoms. The correction to\nspin-spin splitting of 1S state of hydrogen and heavier atoms is much smaller\nthan nuclear structure contribution and can be ignored.

This limit provides a useful constraint for amplitudes, in\nparticular, can be used to fix the periods part for the case of 4K gluons,\nwhich is the last missing piece of full amplitudes.\n","Comment: v3: 22 pages, comments and a new subsection 5.1 added, typos fixed"]}]

As expected, HI-rich galaxies differ strongly from galaxies of same\nstellar mass that are selected without regard to HI content. The majority of\nthese differences are attributable to the fact that galaxies with more gas are\nbluer and more actively star-forming. In order to identify those galaxy\nproperties that are causally connected with HI content, we compare results\nderived for the HI sample with those derived for galaxies matched in stellar\nmass, size and NUV-$r$ colour. The only photometric property that is clearly\nattributable to increasing HI content, is the colour gradient of the galaxy.\nGalaxies with larger HI fractions have bluer, more actively star-forming outer\ndisks compared to the inner part of the galaxy. HI-rich galaxies also have\nlarger $g$-band radii compared to $i$-band radii. Our results are consistent\nwith the \"inside-out\" picture of disk galaxy formation, which has commonly\nserved as a basis for semi-analytic models of the formation of disks in the\ncontext of Cold Dark Matter cosmologies.

In principle, lattice QCD\nsimulations provide at present the most appropriate way to estimate the Omega-\nform factors, as function of the square of the transferred four-momentum, Q2,\nsince it describes baryon systems at the physical mass for the strange quark.\nHowever, lattice QCD form factors, and in particular GE2, are determined at\nfinite Q2 only, and the extraction of the electric quadrupole moment, Q_Omega=\nGE2(0) e/(2 M_Omega), involves an extrapolation of the numerical lattice\nresults. In this work we reproduce the lattice QCD data with a covariant\nspectator quark model for Omega- which includes a mixture of S and two D states\nfor the relative quark-diquark motion.

We showed recently[1] that the naked singularities that form due\nto gravitational collapse of massive stars provide a suitable environment where\nparticles could get accelerated and collide at arbitrarily high center of mass\nenergies. However, we focussed there only on the spherically symmetric\ngravitational collapse models, which were also assumed to be self-similar. In\nthis paper, we broaden and generalize the result to all gravitational collapse\nmodels leading to the formation of a naked singularity as final state of\ncollapse, evolving from a regular initial data, without making any prior\nrestrictive assumptions about the spacetime symmetries such as above. We show\nthat when the particles interact and collide near the Cauchy horizon, the\nenergy of collision in the center of mass frame will be arbitrarily high, thus\noffering a window to the Planck scale physics. We also consider the issue of\nvarious possible physical mechanisms of generation of such very high energy\nparticles from the vicinity of naked singularity. We then construct a model of\ngravitational collapse to a timelike naked singularity to demonstrate the\nworking of these ideas, where the pressure is allowed to be negative but the\nenergy conditions are respected. We show that a finite amount of mass-energy\ndensity has to be necessarily radiated away from the vicinity of the naked\nsingularity as the collapse evolves. Therefore the nature of naked\nsingularities, both at classical and quantum level could play an important role\nin the process of particle acceleration, explaining the occurrence of highly\nenergetic outgoing particles in the vicinity of Cauchy horizon that participate\nin extreme high energy collisions.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 5 figures, Accepted for publication in Phys.

Different experimental techniques have been used to\nprobe the excited states of CNCbl, revealing many issues that remain poorly\nunderstood from an electronic structure point of view. Due to its efficient\nscaling with size, TD-DFT emerges as one of the most practical tools that can\nbe used to predict the electronic properties of these fairly complex molecules.\nHowever, the description of excited states is strongly dependent on the type of\nfunctional used in the calculations. In the present contribution, the choice of\na proper functional for vitamin B12 was evaluated in terms of its agreement\nwith both experimental results and correlated ab initio calculations. Three\ndifferent functionals, i.e. B3LYP, BP86, and LC-BLYP, were tested. In addition,\nthe effect of relative contributions of DFT and HF to the exchange-correlation\nfunctional was investigated as a function of the range-separation parameter,\n{\\mu}. The issues related to the underestimation of charge transfer (CT)\nexcitation energies by TD-DFT was validated by Tozer's L diagnostic, which\nmeasures the spatial overlap between occupied and virtual orbitals involved in\nthe particular excitation. The nature of low-lying excited states was also\nanalyzed based on a comparison of TD-DFT and ab initio results. Based on an\nextensive comparision against experimental results and ab initio benchmark\ncalculations, the BP86 functional was found to be the most appropriate in\ndescribing the electronic properties of CNCbl.

We assume that there are two users, one\nhalf-duplex relay, and a common destination, each equipped with single antenna.\nFor the Rayleigh fading, the DDF protocol is well known and has been analyzed\nin terms of the DMT with infinite block length. By carefully dealing with\nproperties specific to finite block length, we characterize the finite block\nlength DMT which takes into account the fact that the event of decoding error\nat the relay causes the degradation in error performance when the block length\nis finite. Furthermore, we consider the situation where the destination does\nnot have a priori knowledge of the relay decision time at which the relay\nswitches from listening to transmitting. By introducing a decision rejection\ncriterion such that the relay forwards message only when its decision is\nreliable, and the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) at the destination\nthat jointly decodes the relay decision time and the information message, our\nanalysis show that the optimal DMT is achievable as if there is no decoding\nerror at the relay and the relay decision time is known at the destination.\nTherefore, infinite block length and additional overhead for communicating the\ndecision time are not needed for the DDF to achieve the optimal DMT. To further\nimprove the DMT, we propose the HDAF protocol which take advantages of both the\nDDF and the Amplified-and-Forward protocols by judiciously choosing which\nprotocol to use.

By deriving a tight upper bound for the sum rate loss, the minimum\nnumber of thresholds for a given tolerable sum rate loss is determined. In\naddition, a fast bit allocation method is discussed for the proposed scheme,\nand the simulation results show that the sum rate performances with the complex\noptimal bit allocation method and with the fast algorithm are almost the same.\nWe compare our multi-threshold scheme to some previously proposed feedback\nschemes.

This study considers two\ntypes of pedestrians: familiar and unfamiliar with the facility. Four\nstrategies are modelled to cover those groups. The modelled strategies are the\nshortest path (local and global); They are combined with a quickest path\napproach, which is based on an observation principle. In the quickest path\napproach, pedestrians take their decisions based on the observed environment\nand are routed dynamically in the network using an appropriate cost benefit\nanalysis function. The dynamic modelling of route choice with different\nstrategies and types of pedestrians considers the manifold of in uences which\nappears in the real system and raises questions about the criticality of an\nevacuation process. To address this question criteria are elaborated. The\ncriteria we focus on in this contribution are the evacuation time, the\nindividual times spent in jam, the jam size evolution and the overall jam size\nitself.

The first one concerns the\ndiscovery of some basic dynamical laws that enable the emergence of the\nfundamental features observed in social networks, namely the nontrivial\nclustering properties, the existence of positive degree correlations and the\nsubdivision into communities. To reproduce all these features we describe a\nsimple model of mobile colliding agents, whose collisions define the\nconnections between the agents which are the nodes in the underlying network,\nand develop some analytical considerations. The second point addresses the\nparticular feature of clustering and its relationship with global network\nmeasures, namely with the distribution of the size of cycles in the network.\nSince in social bipartite networks it is not possible to measure the clustering\nfrom standard procedures, we propose an alternative clustering coefficient that\ncan be used to extract an improved normalized cycle distribution in any\nnetwork. Finally, the third point addresses dynamical processes occurring on\nnetworks, namely when studying the propagation of information in them. In\nparticular, we focus on the particular features of gossip propagation which\nimpose some restrictions in the propagation rules. To this end we introduce a\nquantity, the spread factor, which measures the average maximal fraction of\nnearest neighbors which get in contact with the gossip, and find the striking\nresult that there is an optimal non-trivial number of friends for which the\nspread factor is minimized, decreasing the danger of being gossiped.\n","Comment: 16 Pages, 9 figures"]}]
