Then there exists a finite set Y which is the\nsubset of A that A has and an integer h' = h(A) such that A has Shirshov's\nheight h' over set Y. For Y we may take the set of words of length <d. Such Y\nis called a Shirshov's base of algebra A.\" Shirshov's original proof was purely\ncombinatorical, but did not provide a reasonable upper estimate for the height.\nKolotov obtained an estimate for h(A) < s^(s^m) (m = deg(A), and s is the\nnumber of generators) in 1981. I. Zelmanov asked for an exponential bound in\nthe Dniester Notebook. In 2011 Belov and Kharitonov get the estimate 2^87 m^(12\nlog_3(m)+48) l. This result answered Zelmanov question that in fact Shirshov's\nheight has subexponential growth. As a corollary from Amitzur-Levitsky theorem\nwe have the lower estimate of h(A) which is ((m/2)^2 - 1)(s - 1) + 1 . We\nconsider essential height over the sets of small words to obtain exact\nestimations of Shirshov's height.

The main results of the paper are the\nfollowing: Let M be the set of non-n-dividable words with: 1) finite essential\nheight over the words degree 2, then the number of lexicographically comparable\nwords with period 2 is less than (2l-1)(n-1)(n-2)/2; 2) finite essential height\nover the words degree 3, then the number of lexicographically comparable words\nwith period 3 is less than (2l-1)(n-1)(n-2); 3) finite essential height over\nthe words degree (n-1), then the number of lexicographically comparable words\nwith period (n-1) is less than (l-2)(n-1). The case of the words of length 2 is\nsynthesized to the proof of the exponential estimation in Shirshov's Height\ntheorem.\n","Comment: In Russian, 13 pages.

When $n=1$ the ground state eigenvector of the transfer matrix of\nthis model can be interpreted as a probability distribution of the possible\nstates of the system. Because of special properties the transfer matrix has at\n$n=1$, we can show that the eigenvector is a solution of the q-deformed\nKnizhnik--Zamolodchikov equation, and we use this fact to explicitly calculate\nsome of the components of the eigenvector. In addition, recursive properties of\nthe transfer matrix allow us to compute the normalisation of the eigenvector,\nand show that it is the product of four Weyl characters of the symplectic\ngroup. The boundary condition of this model lends itself to calculations\nrelating to horizontal percolation. One of these calculations is a type of\ncorrelation function that can be interpreted as the density of percolation\ncluster crossings between the two boundaries of the lattice.

Using\nVLT/SINFONI, we obtained near-infrared imaging spectroscopy of a small region\nin the Antennae overlap region, coincident with the supergiant molecular cloud\n2 (SGMC 2). We find extended H2 line emission across much of the 600 pc\nfield-of-view, traced at sub-arcsecond spatial resolution. The data also reveal\na compact H2 source with broad lines and a dynamical mass Mdyn 10^7 Msun, which\nhas no observable Brg or K-band continuum emission, and no obvious counterpart\nin the 6 cm radio continuum. Line ratios indicate that the H2 emission of both\nsources is powered by shocks, making these lines a quantitative tracer of the\ndissipation of turbulent kinetic energy. The turbulence appears to be driven by\nthe large-scale gas dynamics, and not by feedback from star formation. We\npropose a scenario where the H2 emission is related to the formation of bound\nclouds through accretion. The kinetic energy of the accreted gas drives the\nturbulence and powers the H2 emission. Broad H2 line widths of-order 150 km/s,\nsimilar to the velocity gradient of the gas across the field of view, support\nthis idea. Within this interpretation, the compact H2 source could be a massive\ncloud on its way to form a super star cluster within the next few Myr. This\nscenario can be further tested with ALMA observations.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 8 figures, A&A accepted: september 1st 2011"]}]
