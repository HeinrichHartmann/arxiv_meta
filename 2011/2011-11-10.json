As can be seen from\nour papers, all of the formulas for different kinds of multicenter integrals\nover Slater type orbitals with integer and noninteger principal quantum numbers\nobtained by the use of unsymmetrical and symmetrical one-range addition\ntheorems were tested by computer calculations. We reject the Weniger's personal\nviews about papers published by Guseinov and his coworkers from 1978 to 2006\nand respectable referees on one-range addition theorems and multicenter\nintegrals. All claims of inconsistencies and flaws in the theoretical framework\nare rejected as unfounded. This rejoinder paper contains all of the answers to\nWeniger's comments.\n","Comment: According to arXiv moderation's suggestion, our reply to published by\n  E.J.Weniger \"arXiv:0707.3361v1\" has been combined with recently published my\n  Rejoinder \"arXiv: 0706.0975v2\", 36 pages, title slightly changed, minor\n  changes in the Sections 3 and 4, new references has been added"]}]

Specifically, we investigate how the different\ntypes of electron orbits, involving one or two centers, affect the interference\npatterns in the spectra. We also briefly address the influence of the choice of\ngauge, and of the initial and final electronic bound states on such patterns.\nFor the length-gauge SFA and undressed bound states, there exist additional\nterms, which can be interpreted as potential energy shifts. If, on the one\nhand, such shifts alter the potential barriers through which the electron\ninitially tunnels, and may lead to a questionable physical interpretation of\nthe features encountered, on the other hand they seem to be necessary in order\nto reproduce the overall maxima and minima in the spectra. Indeed, for dressed\nelectronic bound states in the length gauge, or undressed bound states in the\nvelocity gauge, for which such shifts are absent, there is a breakdown of the\ninterference patterns. In order to avoid such a problem, we provide an\nalternative pathway for the electron to reach the continuum, by means of an\nadditional attosecond-pulse train. A comparison of the purely monochromatic\ncase with the situation for which the attosecond pulses are present suggests\nthat the patterns are due to the interference between the electron orbits which\nfinish at different centers, regardless of whether one or two centers are\ninvolved.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 9 figures; two figures have been modified, one figure and\n  new results included, discussions extended"]}]

Currently, the most promising method to detect\nWIMPs is the direct detection of the recoil energy deposited in a\nlow-background laboratory detector due to elastic WIMP-nucleus scattering. So\nfar the usual procedure has been to predict the event rate of direct detection\nof WIMPs based on some model(s) of the Galactic halo from cosmology and of\nWIMPs from elementary particle physics. The aim of this work is to invert this\nprocess. In this thesis I present methods which allow to reconstruct (the\nmoments of) the WIMP velocity distribution function as well as to determine the\nWIMP mass from the recoil energy spectrum as well as from experimental data\ndirectly. The reconstruction of the velocity distribution function has been\nfurther extended to take into account the annual modulation of the event rate.\nMoreover, the reconstruction of the amplitude of the annual modulation of the\nvelocity distribution and an alternative, better way for confirming the annual\nmodulation of the event rate have been discussed. On the other hand, the\ndetermination of the WIMP mass by combining two (or more) experiments with\ndifferent detector materials has been developed. All formulae and expressions\ngiven here are not only independent of the model of Galactic halo but also of\nthat of WIMPs.

Explanations of this acceleration are of two kinds:\nmodifications of Einstein gravity or new forms of energy. An example of\nmodified gravity is the braneworld Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model, an\nexample of dark energy is Chaplygin gas. Both are characterized by a cross-over\nlength scale $r_c$ which marks the transition between physics occurring on our\nfour-dimensional brane, and in a five-dimensional bulk space. Assuming that the\nscales $r_c$ in the two models are the same, we study Chaplygin gas dark energy\nin flat DGP geometries. The self-accelerating branch does not give a viable\nmodel, it causes too much acceleration. We derive the Hubble function and the\nluminosity distance for the self-decelerating branch, and then fit a\ncompilation of 192 SNeIa magnitudes and redshifts in the space of the three\nparameters of the model. Our model with the self-decelerating branch fits the\nsupernova data as successfully as does the $\\Lambda CDM$ model, and with only\none additional parameter. In contrast to the $\\Lambda CDM$ model, this model\nneeds no fine-tuning, and it can explain the coincidence problem. It is unique\nin the sense that it cannot be reduced to a cosmological constant model in any\nother limit of the parameter space than in the distant future. If later tests\nwith other cosmological data are successful, we have here a first indication\nthat we live in a five-dimensional braneworld.\n","Comment: 4 pages. Three misprints in v1 corrected"]}]

The renormalised\ncouplings are defined in terms of suitable boundary-to-boundary correlation\nfunctions. In the computation the known first order coefficients of the\nbeta-functions are reproduced. One of the couplings is found to have a\nvanishing beta-function. The calculation is repeated for the recently proposed\nSchroedinger functional with exact chiral symmetry, i.e. Ginsparg-Wilson\nfermions. The renormalisation pattern is found to be the same as in the Wilson\ncase. Using the regularisation dependent finite part of the renormalised\ncouplings, the ratio of the Lambda-parameters is computed.\n","Comment: Ph.D. Thesis (Advisor: Dr. Rainer Sommer)"]}]

In particular, excess momenta in the outflows of pAGB\nobjects suggest that a binary may be required to supply an additional source of\nenergy and angular momentum. The extraction of rotational energy from the\nengine is likely fundamental and may be facilitated if a dynamo is operating in\nthe interior. In this regard, single star magnetic outflow models have been\nproposed as mechanisms for producing and shaping PNe, however these models\nneglect the back-reaction of the large-scale magnetic field on the flow.\n  Here we present a transient $\\alpha-\\Omega$ dynamo operating in the envelope\nof an AGB star in (1) an isolated setting and (2) a common envelope in which\nthe secondary is a low-mass companion in-spiraling in the AGB interior. The\nback reaction of the fields on the shear is included and differential rotation\nand rotation deplete via turbulent dissipation and Poynting flux. For an\nisolated star, the shear must be resupplied in order to sufficiently sustain\nthe dynamo. We comment on the energy requirements that convection must satisfy\nto accomplish this.

Hence the\nphase separation does occur, but in a more subtle and interesting nanoscopic\nform, here referred as ``homogeneous''. Remarkably, this ``nanoscale phase\nseparation'' alone is able to bring forth the colossal magnetoresistance in the\nperovskite manganites, and is potentially relevant to a wide variety of other\nmagnetic and/or electrical properties of manganites, as well as many other\ntransition metal oxides, in bulk or thin film form as we exemplify throughout\nthe article.\n","Comment: jpsj2 TeX style (J.

The basic principles which a gravitational\ntheory should follow, and their geometrical interpretation, are analysed in a\nbroad perspective which highlights the basic assumptions of General Relativity\nand suggests possible modifications which might be made. A number of such\npossible modifications are presented, focusing on certain specific classes of\ntheories: scalar-tensor theories, metric f(R) theories, Palatini f(R) theories,\nmetric-affine f(R) theories and Gauss--Bonnet theories. The characteristics of\nthese theories are fully explored and attention is payed to issues of dynamical\nequivalence between them. Also, cosmological phenomenology within the realm of\neach of the theories is discussed and it is shown that they can potentially\naddress the well-known cosmological problems. A number of viability criteria\nare presented: cosmological observations, Solar System tests, stability\ncriteria, existence of exact solutions for common vacuum or matter\nconfigurations etc. Finally, future perspectives in the field of modified\ngravity are discussed and the possibility for going beyond a trial-and-error\napproach to modified gravity is explored.\n","Comment: PhD thesis (Advisors: Stefano Liberati and John C.

However, in biological applications, there are\noften a group of correlated genes responsible for clinical outcomes, and the\nuse of the covariance information can significantly reduce misclassification\nrates.

The implementation of a new model of bone remodeling in PRISM has\nled to an interesting characterization of osteoporosis as a defective bone\nremodeling dynamics with respect to other bone pathologies. Our approach allows\nto derive three types of model checking-based diagnostic estimators. The first\ndiagnostic measure focuses on the level of bone mineral density, which is\ncurrently used in medical practice. In addition, we have introduced a novel\ndiagnostic estimator which uses the full patient clinical record, here\nsimulated using the modeling framework. This estimator detects rapid (months)\nnegative changes in bone mineral density. Independently of the actual bone\nmineral density, when the decrease occurs rapidly it is important to alarm the\npatient and monitor him/her more closely to detect insurgence of other bone\nco-morbidities. A third estimator takes into account the variance of the bone\ndensity, which could address the investigation of metabolic syndromes, diabetes\nand cancer. Our implementation could make use of different logical combinations\nof these statistical estimators and could incorporate other biomarkers for\nother systemic co-morbidities (for example diabetes and thalassemia). We are\ndelighted to report that the combination of stochastic modeling with formal\nmethods motivate new diagnostic framework for complex pathologies.

Liquid\ncharacteristics of the FQHE states are associated with the symmetry-conserving\nrotations and vibrations of the electron molecule. Although the electron\ndensities of the symmetry-conserving LLL states do not exhibit crystalline\npatterns, the intrinsic crystalline correlations are reflected in the\nconditional probability distributions and the emergence of cusp yrast states in\nthe LLL spectra. It is shown that away from the exact fractional fillings, weak\npinning perturbations (due to weak disorder) may overcome the energy gaps\nbetween adjacent global states and generate pinned broken symmetry ground\nstates as a superposition of symmetry-conserving LLL states with different\ntotal angular momenta. The electron densities of such mixed states (without\ngood angular momentum quantum numbers) exhibit oscillating patterns that\ncorrespond to molecular crystallites. These pinned Wigner crystallites\nrepresent finite-size precursors of the bulk Wigner-solid state. It is further\nshown that the emergence of these molecular crystallites is a consequence of\nthe presence of RVEM components in the symmetry-conserving LLL states. In\naddition, it is shown that the RVEM approach accounts for the Wigner-solid\nstate in the neighborhood of nu=1, which was also found in the experiments.

So far, the studies or applications of multivariate probabilistic\nmodel based continuous EDAs are still restricted to rather low dimensional\nproblems (smaller than 100D). Traditional EDAs have difficulties in solving\nhigher dimensional problems because of the curse of dimensionality and their\nrapidly increasing computational cost. However, scaling up continuous EDAs for\nhigher dimensional optimization is still necessary, which is supported by the\ndistinctive feature of EDAs: Because a probabilistic model is explicitly\nestimated, from the learnt model one can discover useful properties or features\nof the problem. Besides obtaining a good solution, understanding of the problem\nstructure can be of great benefit, especially for black box optimization.

By using Weakly dependent variable Identification (WI) and Subspace\nModeling (SM), EDA-MCC shows significantly better performance than traditional\nEDAs on high dimensional problems. Moreover, the computational cost and the\nrequirement of large population sizes can be reduced in EDA-MCC.

It is argued that a similar analysis performed on Taub-NUT space\nshould give the same result, namely, if one holds an ordinary mass outside of\nthe horizon of a Taub-NUT space with only magnetic mass, the system, as seen\nfrom large distances, is endowed with an angular momentum proportional to the\nproduct of the two kinds of masses. When the ordinary, electric, mass reaches\nthe horizon, the exterior metric becomes that of a rotating Taub-NUT space.\n","Comment: 8 pages. References added"]}]

Flaschka-Ratiu conjectured that one can choose the\nGinzburg-Weinstein diffeomorphism in such a way that it intertwines the linear\nand nonlinear Gelfand-Zeitlin systems. Our main result gives a proof of this\nconjecture, and produces a canonical Ginzburg-Weinstein diffeomorphism.\n","Comment: 32 pages"]}]
