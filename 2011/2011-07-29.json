Steiner proved that there is only one pair of conjugate\ndirections, M1 and M2, that belong to all ellipses of circumscription. Then he\nproves that if there is an ellipse, E, whose equal conjugate diameters possess\nthe directional constants M1 and M2, then E must be an ellipse of\ncircumscription which has minimal eccentricity. However, Steiner does not show\nthe existence or uniqueness of such an ellipse. We prove that there is a unique\nellipse of minimal eccentricity which passes through the vertices of D. We also\nshow that there exists an ellipse which passes through the vertices of D and\nwhose equal conjugate diameters possess the directional constants M1 and M2. We\nalso show that there exists a unique ellipse of minimal area which passes\nthrough the vertices of D. Finally, we call a convex quadrilateral, D,\nbielliptic if the unique inscribed and circumscribed ellipses of minimal\neccentricity have the same eccentricity.

Accordingly, considerable research efforts have been devoted to the\ndevelopment of efficient compression techniques for inverted indexes. Roughly,\nindex compression relies on two factors: the ordering of the indexed documents,\nwhich strives to position similar documents in proximity, and the encoding of\nthe inverted lists that result from the ordered stream of documents. Large\ncommercial search engines index tens of billions of pages of the ever growing\nWeb. The sheer size of their indexes dictates the distribution of documents\namong thousands of servers in a scheme called local index-partitioning, such\nthat each server indexes only several millions pages. Due to engineering and\nruntime performance considerations, random distribution of documents to servers\nis common. However, random index-partitioning among many servers adversely\nimpacts the resulting index sizes, as it decreases the effectiveness of\ndocument ordering schemes. We study the impact of random index-partitioning on\ndocument ordering schemes. We show that index-partitioning decreases the\naggregated size of the inverted lists logarithmically with the number of\nservers, when documents within each server are randomly reordered. On the other\nhand, the aggregated partitioned index size increases logarithmically with the\nnumber of servers, when state-of-the-art document ordering schemes, such as\nlexical URL sorting and clustering with TSP, are applied. Finally, we justify\nthe common practice of randomly distributing documents to servers, as we\nqualitatively show that despite its ill-effects on the ensuing compression, it\ndecreases key factors in distributed query evaluation time by an order of\nmagnitude as compared with partitioning techniques that compress better.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 4 figures"]}]

One can also consider the zeros of the\npartition function simultaneously in both complex magnetic field and complex\ntemperature. They form an algebraic curve called the Lee-Yang-Fisher (LYF)\nzeros. In this paper we study their limiting distribution for the Diamond\nHierarchical Lattice (DHL). In this case, it can be described in terms of the\ndynamics of an explicit rational function $R$ in two variables (the\nMigdal-Kadanoff renormalization transformation). We prove that the\nLee-Yang-Fisher zeros are equidistributed with respect to a dynamical\n$(1,1)$-current in the projective space.

We calculated graph\ntheoretical indices of the individual cognitive maps and the collective\ncognitive map produced by augmentation. The graph theoretical indices revealed\ninternal cycles showing non-linear dynamics in the shallow lake ecosystem. The\necological processes were organized democratically without a top-down\nhierarchical structure. The steady state condition of the generic model was a\ncharacteristic turbid shallow lake ecosystem since there were no dynamic\nenvironmental changes that could cause shifts between a turbid and a clearwater\nstate, and the generic model indicated that only a dynamic disturbance regime\ncould maintain the clearwater state. The model developed herein captured the\nempirical behavior of shallow lakes, and contained the basic model of the\nAlternative Stable States Theory. In addition, our model expanded the basic\nmodel by quantifying the relative effects of connections and by extending it.\nIn our expanded model we ran 4 simulations: harvesting submerged plants,\nnutrient reduction, fish removal without nutrient reduction, and\nbiomanipulation. Only biomanipulation, which included fish removal and nutrient\nreduction, had the potential to shift the turbid state into clearwater state.\nThe structure and relationships in the generic model as well as the outcomes of\nthe management simulations were supported by actual field studies in shallow\nlake ecosystems. Thus, fuzzy cognitive mapping methodology enabled us to\nunderstand the complex structure of shallow lake ecosystems as a whole and\nobtain a valid generic model based on tacit knowledge of experts in the field.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 5 Figures"]}]

With input variable relevances, sensitivity analyses and\nneural interpretation diagrams we were able to understand how the different\nmodels predicted nest occurrence and breeding success and compare their\ndifferences and similarities. Both models also predicted increasing nest\noccurrence/breeding success with increasing water depth under the nest and\nincreasing distance to edge. However, relationships for prediction differed in\nthe models. Generalizability of the models was poor except when the marshes had\nsimilar values of important variables in the model. ANN models performed better\nthan generalized linear models (GLM) on marshes with similar structures.\nGeneralizability of the models did not differ in nest occurrence and breeding\nsuccess data. Extensive testing also showed that the GLMs were not necessarily\nmore generalizable than ANNs, suggesting that ANN models make good definitions\nof a study system but are too specific to generalize well to other ecologically\ncomplex systems unless input variable distributions are very similar.\n","Comment: 42 pages, 3 figures.

Overtraining on data or giving vague references to how it was\navoided is the major problem. Various methods can be used to determine when to\nstop training in artificial neural networks: 1) early stopping based on\ncross-validation, 2) stopping after a analyst defined error is reached or after\nthe error levels off, 3) use of a test data set. We do not recommend the third\nmethod as the test data set is then not independent of model development. Many\nstudies used the testing data to optimize the model and training. Although this\nmethod may give the best model for that set of data it does not give\ngeneralizability or improve understanding of the study system. The importance\nof an independent data set cannot be overemphasized as we found dramatic\ndifferences in model accuracy assessed with prediction accuracy on the training\ndata set, as estimated with bootstrapping, and from use of an independent data\nset. The comparison of the artificial neural network with a general linear\nmodel (GLM) as a standard procedure is recommended because a GLM may perform as\nwell or better than the MLP. MLP models should not be treated as black box\nmodels but instead techniques such as sensitivity analyses, input variable\nrelevances, neural interpretation diagrams, randomization tests, and partial\nderivatives should be used to make the model more transparent, and further our\necological understanding which is an important goal of the modelling process.\nBased on our experience we discuss how to build a MLP model and how to optimize\nthe parameters and architecture.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 2 figures.

We provide an overview for nature of the wide\nrange of the data sets and predictive variables, from both aquatic and\nterrestrial ecosystems with different scales of time-dependent dynamics, and\nthe applicability and robustness of predictive modeling methods on such data\nsets by comparing different statistical modeling approaches.
