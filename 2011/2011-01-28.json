Our results show that both the\natomic-to-molecular transition on small, ~10 pc scales and the\nKennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation on ~kpc scales are sensititive to the\ndust-to-gas ratio and the FUV flux. The atomic-to-molecular transition as a\nfunction of gas density or column density has a large scatter but is rather\nsharp and shifts to higher densities with decreasing dust-to-gas ratio and/or\nincreasing FUV flux. Consequently, star formation is concentrated to higher gas\nsurface density regions, resulting in steeper slope and lower amplitude of the\nKS relation at a given gas surface density, in less dusty and/or higher FUV\nflux environments. These trends should have a particularly strong effect on the\nevolution of low-mass, low surface brightness galaxies which typically have low\ndust content and anemic star formation, but are also likely to be important for\nevolution of the Milky Way-sized systems.
