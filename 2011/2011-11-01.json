The upconverters in\nthis study are based on triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) between excited\npolycyclic aromatic molecules, and TTA requires a fluidic media to allow for\nthe molecules to collide with each other for energy transfer. This process,\nTTA-based photon upconversion (TTA-UC), was therefore mainly accomplished with\norganic solvents previously. It is found that the molecules used for TTA-UC,\nwhich are non-polar or weakly polar, are stably solvated in a certain class of\nILs. The mechanism of the observed solvation is proposed and discussed. The\nupconversion quantum yields (UC-QYs) measured by continuous wave (CW) light\nexcitation reach as high as 10 % with moderate excitation intensity (~ 6\nW/cm2), which is considerably higher than those in previous TTA-UC studies\nperformed with organic solvents (up to ~ 4 % with CW light excitations). It is\nfound that the value of UC-QY starts to saturate as the excitation power\nincreases for all the cases, even within the moderate CW excitation power range\nin this study. An analytical model that describes the UC-QY vs. excitation\npower relationship is derived and compared with the experimental results. The\nagreement between them suggests that the donor-acceptor energy transfer in this\nsystem is highly efficient. Based on these experimental and analytical\nfindings, it is found that efficient energy transfer between the molecules is\npossible in ILs and therefore ILs are not actually viscous media for the\npurpose of TTA-UC.\n","Comment: This manuscript was submitted to Advanced Functional Materials\n  (Wiley-VCH) on January 26, 2011.

A streamer can supply these electrons by itself through\nphoto-ionization, or the electrons can be present due to external background\nionization. Here we investigate the effects of background ionization on\nstreamer propagation and morphology by changing the gas composition and the\nrepetition rate of the voltage pulses, and by adding a small amount of\nradioactive Krypton 85.\n  We find that the general morphology of a positive streamer discharge in high\npurity nitrogen depends on background ionization: at lower background\nionization levels the streamers branch more and have a more feather-like\nappearance. This is observed both when varying the repetition rate and when\nadding Krypton 85, though side branches are longer with the radioactive\nadmixture. But velocities and minimal diameters of streamers are virtually\nindependent of the background ionization level. In air, the inception cloud\nbreaks up into streamers at a smaller radius when the repetition rate and\ntherefore the background ionization level is higher. When measuring the effects\nof the pulse repetition rate and of the radioactive admixture on the discharge\nmorphology, we found that our estimates of background ionization levels are\nconsistent with these observations; this gives confidence in the estimates.\n  Streamer channels generally do not follow the paths of previous discharge\nchannels for repetition rates of up to 10 Hz.

To circumvent this problem, information gap (info-gap)\ntheory has been developed to explicitly recognize and quantify the implications\nof information gaps in decision making. This paper presents a decision analysis\nbased on info-gap theory developed for a contaminant remediation scenario. The\nanalysis provides decision support in determining the fraction of contaminant\nmass to remove from the environment in the presence of a lack of information\nrelated to the contaminant mass flux into an aquifer.

The nominal contaminant\nflux defines a reasonable contaminant flux over time based on existing\ninformation. A robustness function is derived to quantify the maximum level of\ndeviation from nominal that still ensures compliance for each decision.

No inhibitory coherence is observed in a\nhomogeneous ensemble composed of only subthreshold neurons (which cannot fire\nspontaneously without noise). By increasing the fraction of (spontaneously\nfiring) suprathreshold neurons $P_{supra}$, heterogeneity-induced inhibitory\ncoherence is investigated in a heterogeneous ensemble of subthreshold and\nsuprathreshold neurons. As $P_{supra}$ passes a threshold $P_{supra}^*$,\nsuprathreshold neurons begin to synchronize and play the role of coherent\ninhibitors for the emergence of inhibitory coherence. Thus,\nregularly-oscillating ensemble-averaged global potential appears for $P_{supra}\n> P_{supra}^*$. For this coherent case suprathreshold neurons exhibit coherent\nmixed-mode oscillations with a fast subthreshold (small-amplitude) hopping\nfrequency and a lower spiking frequency. By virtue of their coherent\ninhibition, sparsely synchronized suprathreshold neurons suppress noisy\nactivities of subthreshold neurons. Thus, only coherent subthreshold hoppings\nappear in the individual potentials of subthreshold neurons. We also\ncharacterize the inhibitory coherence in terms of the \"statistical-mechanical\"\nspike-based and correlation-based measures and find that the degree of\ninhibitory coherence increases with increasing $P_{supra}$ for $P_{supra} >\nP_{supra}^*$.

We assume that gamma-ray and non-thermal X-ray photons are\nemitted from a particle acceleration region in the outer magnetosphere, and\nUV/optical photons originate above that region. We also assume that gamma-rays\nare radiated only by outwardly moving particles, whereas the other photons are\nproduced by particles moving inward and outward. We parametrize the altitude of\nthe emission region. We find that the outer gap model can explain the\nmulti-wavelength pulse behavior. From observational fitting, we also find a\ngeneral tendency for the altitude of the gamma-ray emission region to depend on\nthe inclination angle. In particular, the emission region for low inclination\nangle is required to be located in very low altitude, which corresponds to the\ninner region within the last-open field line of rotating dipole in vacuum.

The CRC\nsymbols, which allow the decoder to identify the correct sequence, incur\nnegligible overhead for large block lengths.

We further show that the approach can be extended to a\nmore general class of channel: the exponentially decaying channels, which model\naccuratly the cooperation of TXs located on a one dimensional space. Finally,\nwe verify by simulations that the proposed CSI allocation leads to very little\nperformance losses.\n"]}]

This stochastic spiking coherence may be well visualized in the raster\nplot of neural spikes. For a coherent case, partially-occupied \"stripes\"\n(composed of spikes and indicating collective coherence) are formed in the\nraster plot. This partial occupation occurs due to \"stochastic spike skipping\"\nwhich is well shown in the multi-peaked interspike interval histogram. The main\npurpose of our work is to quantitatively measure the degree of stochastic\nspiking coherence seen in the raster plot. We introduce a new spike-based\ncoherence measure $M_s$ by considering the occupation pattern and the pacing\npattern of spikes in the stripes. In particular, the pacing degree between\nspikes is determined in a statistical-mechanical way by quantifying the average\ncontribution of (microscopic) individual spikes to the (macroscopic)\nensemble-averaged global potential. This \"statistical-mechanical\" measure $M_s$\nis in contrast to the conventional measures such as the \"thermodynamic\" order\nparameter (which concerns the time-averaged fluctuations of the macroscopic\nglobal potential), the \"microscopic\" correlation-based measure (based on the\ncross-correlation between the microscopic individual potentials), and the\nmeasures of precise spike timing (based on the peri-stimulus time histogram).\nIn terms of $M_s$, we quantitatively characterize the stochastic spiking\ncoherence, and find that $M_s$ reflects the degree of collective spiking\ncoherence seen in the raster plot very well. Hence, the\n\"statistical-mechanical\" spike-based measure $M_s$ may be used usefully to\nquantify the degree of stochastic spiking coherence in a statistical-mechanical\nway.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 5 figures, to appear in the J.

For the large halo-to-disk mass ratio expected in CDM\ncosmologies their sequence of models failed to produce strong tails like those\nobserved in many well-known pairs of interacting galaxies.

With a series of\nself-consistent collisionless simulations of galaxy-galaxy mergers we\ndemonstrate that even the disks of very massive dark haloes have no problems\ndeveloping long tidal tails, provided the halo spin parameter is large enough.\nWe show that the halo-to-disk mass ratio is a poor indicator for the ability to\nproduce tails. Instead, the relative size of disk and halo, or alternatively,\nthe ratio of circular velocity to local escape speed at the half mass radius of\nthe disk are more useful criteria. This result holds in all CDM cosmologies.\nThe length of tidal tails is thus unlikely to provide useful constraints on\nsuch models.\n","Comment: 17 pages, mn.sty, 13 included eps-figures, submitted to MNRAS"]}]
