The proposed approach is relevant for\ntwo reasons: 1) Statistics of systems with several different drift terms can be\nhandled in an efficient way, independently from the kind of white noise; 2) The\nparticular form of Wiener-Hopf integral transform and its numerical evaluation,\nboth introduced in this study, are generalizations of fractional\nintegro-differential operators of potential type and Gr\\\"unwald-Letnikov\nfractional derivatives, respectively.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 5 figures"]}]

The model depends on the mass function, clustering and density\nprofiles of halos. We test these ingredients using a large ensemble of\nhigh-resolution Gaussian and non-Gaussian numerical simulations. In particular,\nwe provide a first exploration of how density profiles change in the presence\nof primordial non-Gaussianities. We find that for f_NL positive/negative high\nmass halos have an increased/decreased core density, so being more/less\nconcentrated than in the Gaussian case.

The stability margin in case of the undirected graph decays to\n0 as at least $O(1/N)$.

Given the permission of unlicensed access to TV white spaces, WSPs\ncan alleviate their burden by exploiting the concept of \"capacity offload\" to\ntransfer part of their traffic load to unlicensed spectrum. For such use cases,\na central problem is for WSPs to coexist with others, since all of them may\naccess the unlicensed spectrum without coordination thus interfering each\nother. Game theory provides tools for predicting the behavior of WSPs, and we\nformulate the coexistence problem under the framework of non-cooperative games\nas a capacity offload game (COG). We show that a COG always possesses at least\none pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (NE), and does not have any mixed-strategy\nNE. The analysis provides a full characterization of the structure of the NEs\nin two-player COGs. When the game is played repeatedly and each WSP\nindividually updates its strategy based on its best-response function, the\nresulting process forms a best-response dynamic. We establish that, for\ntwo-player COGs, alternating-move best-response dynamics always converge to an\nNE, while simultaneous-move best-response dynamics does not always converge to\nan NE when multiple NEs exist. When there are more than two players in a COG,\nif the network configuration satisfies certain conditions so that the resulting\nbest-response dynamics become linear, both simultaneous-move and\nalternating-move best-response dynamics are guaranteed to converge to the\nunique NE.\n"]}]

This has important\nramifications for the structure of the Oort Cloud, as it means that the solar\nsystem may have experienced tidal and stellar perturbations that were\nsignificantly different from its current local galactic environment. To\ncharacterize the effects of solar migration within the Milky Way, we use direct\nnumerical simulations to model the formation of an Oort Cloud around stars that\nend up on solar-type orbits in a galactic-scale simulation of a Milky Way-like\ndisk formation. Surprisingly, our simulations indicate that Sedna's orbit may\nbelong to the classical Oort Cloud.

From July to October 2010, Virgo performed its\nthird science run (VSR3) in coincidence with the LIGO detectors. Despite\nseveral techniques adopted to isolate the interferometer from the environment,\nseismic noise remains an important issue for Virgo. Vibrations produced by the\ndetector infrastructure (such as air conditioning units, water\nchillers/heaters, pumps) are found to affect Virgo's sensitivity, with the main\ncoupling mechanisms being through beam jitter and scattered light processes.\nThe Advanced Virgo (AdV) design seeks to reduce ITF couplings to environmental\nnoise by having most vibration-sensitive components suspended and in-vacuum, as\nwell as muffle and relocate loud machines. During the months of June and July\n2010, a Guralp-3TD seismometer was stationed at various locations around the\nVirgo site hosting major infrastructure machines. Seismic data were examined\nusing spectral and coherence analysis with seismic probes close to the\ndetector. The primary aim of this study was to identify noisy machines which\nseismically affect the ITF environment and thus require mitigation attention.\nAnalyzed machines are located at various distances from the experimental halls,\nranging from 10m to 100m. An attempt is made to measure the attenuation of\nemitted noise at the ITF and correlate it to the distance from the source and\nto seismic attenuation models in soil.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 7 figures, Gravitational-wave Physics and Astronomy\n  Workshop"]}]

The behaviour of the crowd is considered from a twofold perspective. We\nexamine both the large scale behaviour of the crowd, and phenomena happening at\nthe individual pedestrian's level. We unify micro and macro in a single model,\nby working with general mass measures and their transport. We improve existing\nmodelling by coupling a measure-theoretical framework with basic ideas of\nmixture theory formulated in terms of measures. This strategy allows us to\ndefine several constituents of the crowd, each having its own partial velocity.\nWe can thus examine the interaction between subpopulations that have distinct\ncharacteristics. We give special features to those pedestrians that are\nrepresented by the microscopic (discrete) part. In real life they would play\nthe role of leaders, predators etc. Since we are interested in the global\nbehaviour of the rest of the crowd, we model this part as a continuum. By\nidentifying a suitable concept of entropy, we derive an entropy inequality and\nshow that our model agrees with a Clausius-Duhem-like inequality. From this\ninequality natural restrictions on the proposed velocity fields follow; obeying\nthese restrictions makes our model compatible with thermodynamics.

Our analysis shows two\ndistinct regions for which the integral characteristics of both the giant and\npygmy resonances behave rather differently. For neutron-rich nuclei, starting\nfrom $^{132}$Sn, we obtain a giant E1 resonance which significantly deviates\nfrom the widely-used systematics extrapolated from experimental data in the\n$\\beta$-stability valley. We show that the inclusion of the phonon coupling is\nnecessary for a proper description of the low-energy pygmy resonances and the\ncorresponding transition densities for $A<$132 nuclei, while in the $A>132$\nregion the influence of phonon coupling is significantly smaller. The radiative\nneutron capture cross sections leading to the stable $^{124}$Sn and unstable\n$^{132}$Sn and $^{150}$Sn nuclei are calculated with both the (Q)RPA and the\nbeyond-(Q)RPA strength functions and shown to be sensitive to both the\npredicted low-lying strength and the phonon coupling contribution. The\ncomparison with the widely-used phenomenological Generalized Lorentzian\napproach shows considerable differences both for the strength function and the\nradiative neutron capture cross section. In particular, for the neutron-rich\n$^{150}$Sn, the reaction cross section is found to be increased by a factor\ngreater than 20.

By separately considering random and prepared initial\nconditions, we observe a critical influence of the competition rate $p$ on the\nstability of spiral waves and on the emergence of biodiversity. In particular,\nwhile increasing values of $p$ promote biodiversity, they may act detrimental\non spatial pattern formation. For random initial conditions, we observe a phase\ntransition from biodiversity to an absorbing phase, whereby the critical value\nof mobility grows linearly with increasing values of $p$ on a log-log scale,\nbut then saturates as $p$ becomes large. For prepared initial conditions, we\nobserve the formation of single-armed spirals, but only for values of $p$ that\nare below a critical value. Once above, the spirals break up and form\ndisordered spatial structures, mainly because of the percolation of vacant\nsites. Thus, there exists a critical value of the competition rate $p_{c}$ for\nstable single-armed spirals in finite populations. Importantly though, $p_{c}$\nincreases with increasing system size, because noise reinforces the\ndisintegration of ordered patterns. In addition, we also find that $p_{c}$\nincreases with the mobility. These phenomena are reproduced by a deterministic\nmodel that is based on nonlinear partial differential equations.

Both the spatial distribution of cosmic rays due to their\ndiffusion and the spatial distribution of the intracluster gas are taken into\naccount. Our calculations are specifically applied to the case of the Coma\ncluster. The fluxes and spectra of the radio halo emission and of the hard\nX-ray excess from Coma can be explained in this model if an average magnetic\nfield $B \\sim 0.1\\mu G$ is assumed. However, such a low value for the\nintracluster magnetic field implies a large cosmic ray energy density which in\nturn is responsible, through neutral pion decay, for a gamma ray flux above 100\nMeV which exceeds the EGRET upper limit. This gamma ray bound can be relaxed if\nthe hard X-ray excess and the radio halo emission from Coma are not due to the\nsame population of electrons.

We\nprove that, in the closely related context of a continuous score function,\nmonotonicity of the conditional default probabilities is equivalent to\noptimality of the corresponding decision rules in the test-theoretic sense.
