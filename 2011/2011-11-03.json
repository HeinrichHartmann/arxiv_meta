We present a novel algorithm to compute such finite\nstate models for nonlinear discrete-time and sampled systems which depends on\nquantizing the state space using polyhedral cells, embedding these cells into\nsuitable supersets whose attainable sets are convex, and over-approximating\nattainable sets by intersections of supporting half-spaces. We prove a novel\nrecursive description of these half-spaces and propose an iterative procedure\nto compute them efficiently. We also provide new sufficient conditions for the\nconvexity of attainable sets which imply the existence of the aforementioned\nembeddings of quantizer cells. Our method yields highly accurate abstractions\nand applies to nonlinear systems under mild assumptions, which reduce to\nsufficient smoothness in the case of sampled systems. Its practicability in the\ndesign of discrete controllers for nonlinear continuous plants under state and\ncontrol constraints is demonstrated by an example.\n","Comment: This work has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Trans.\n  Automatic Control. v3: minor modifications; accepted version"]}]

As expected the finite quark mass suppresses the quark number\nsusceptibility. We find that at high temperatures $T\\ge 600$ MeV the quark\nnumber susceptibility of light quarks and heavy quarks are almost equal in the\nbottom-up model. This indicates that the heavy quark like charm contribution to\nthermodynamics of a QCD-like system may start to become significant at\ntemperatures $T\\sim 600$ MeV. In D3/D7 model, we focus on the competition\nbetween the quark chemical potential, which enhances the quark number\nsusceptibility, and the quark mass that suppresses the susceptibility. We\nobserve that depending on the relative values of the quark mass and the quark\nchemical potential, the quark number susceptibility shows a diverging or\nconverging behavior. We also calculate the chiral susceptibility in D3/D7 model\nto support the observation made with the quark number susceptibility.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 3 figures"]}]

The answers to these\nquestions involve not only the biology of plant vasculature, but also the\nphysical properties of water that enable such transport.

Our approach is based on a novel multilevel\nhierarchical model that we refer to as a User Profile Model with Graphical\nLasso (UPG). The UPG provides a personalized recommendation to users by\nsimultaneously incorporating both user covariates and historical user\ninteractions with items in a model based way. In fact, we build a per-item\nregression model based on a rich set of user covariates and estimate individual\nuser affinity to items by introducing a latent random vector for each user. The\nvector random effects are assumed to be drawn from a prior with a precision\nmatrix that measures residual partial associations among items. To ensure\nbetter estimates of a precision matrix in high-dimensions, the matrix elements\nare constrained through a Lasso penalty. Our model is fitted through a\npenalized-quasi likelihood procedure coupled with a scalable EM algorithm. We\nemploy several computational strategies like multi-threading, conjugate\ngradients and heavily exploit problem structure to scale our computations in\nthe E-step. For the M-step we take recourse to a scalable variant of the\nGraphical Lasso algorithm for covariance selection. Through extensive\nexperiments on a new data set obtained from Yahoo! front page and a benchmark\ndata set from a movie recommender application, we show that our UPG model\nsignificantly improves performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods\nin the literature, especially those based on a bilinear random effects model\n(BIRE).

Although the dancing bunches do not cause single bunch emittance\ngrowth or beam loss at injection, it leads to bunch lengthening at collisions.\nIn operations, a longitudinal damper has been built which stops this dance and\ndamps out coupled bunch modes. Recent theoretical work predicts that the dance\ncan also be stopped by an appropriate change in the bunch distribution. This\npaper shows the Tevatron experiments which support this theory.\n"]}]

Using similar parameters for both equations, we ran various\nsimulations aggregating particles.
