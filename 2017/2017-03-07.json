Such detection problems require a formal\ndefinition of meme, or unit of information that can spread from person to\nperson through the social network.

Here we describe a streaming framework for online detection and\nclustering of memes in social media, specifically Twitter. A pre-clustering\nprocedure, namely protomeme detection, first isolates atomic tokens of\ninformation carried by the tweets. Protomemes are thereafter aggregated, based\non multiple similarity measures, to obtain memes as cohesive groups of tweets\nreflecting actual concepts or topics of discussion. The clustering algorithm\ntakes into account various dimensions of the data and metadata, including\nnatural language, the social network, and the patterns of information\ndiffusion. As a result, our system can build clusters of semantically,\nstructurally, and topically related tweets. The clustering process is based on\na variant of Online K-means that incorporates a memory mechanism, used to\n\"forget\" old memes and replace them over time with the new ones. The evaluation\nof our framework is carried out by using a dataset of Twitter trending topics.\nOver a one-week period, we systematically determined whether our algorithm was\nable to recover the trending hashtags. We show that the proposed method\noutperforms baseline algorithms that only use content features, as well as a\nstate-of-the-art event detection method that assumes full knowledge of the\nunderlying follower network.

Using this framework, we\ndesign a new deterministic algorithm for the fundamental problem of\n\\emph{broadcasting}, running in $O(n \\log D \\log\\log\\frac{D \\Delta}{n})$ time.\nThis is the fastest known algorithm for the problem, improving upon the $O(n\n\\log n \\log \\log n)$-time algorithm of De Marco (2010) and the $O(n \\log^2\nD)$-time algorithm due to Czumaj and Rytter (2003), the previous fastest\nresults for directed networks.

However, a viable\nbeyond-CMOS logic technology has remained elusive. Here, we propose a scalable\nspintronic logic device which operates via spin-orbit transduction combined\nwith magneto-electric switching.

The proposed MESO devices scale strongly and favorably with critical\ndimensions of the device, showing a cubic dependence of switching energy on\nsize, (E_m proportional to W^3), and square dependence on voltage (E_m\nproportional to V^2). The excellent scaling is obtained thanks to the\nproperties of the spin orbit effects (e.g. Inverse Spin Hall Effect (ISHE) and\nInverse Rashba-Edelstein Effect (IREE)) and the dependence of capacitance on\nsize. The operating voltages for these devices are predicted to be < 100 mV\nallowing a significant jump ahead of historic trends of scaling voltage with\nsize and corresponding reduction of energy. Interconnect resistance is a\ncritical obstacle for scaling beyond 10 nm dimensions. We project a less\ndetrimental impact of interconnect resistance and show that MESO logic is\namenable for highly resistive interconnects (100 uOhm.cm-1 mOhm.cm) which opens\na possibility to use nano-metallic (width < bulk electron mean free path) or\ndoped semiconducting wires (width<5 nm).

The recent success in optical pumping of valley polarization in\n2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has greatly promoted the concept of\nvalley-based informatics and electronics. However, between the demonstrated\nvalley polarization of transient electron-hole pair excitations and practical\nvalleytronic operations, there exist obvious gaps to fill, among which is the\nvalley pump of long-lived charge carriers.

The mechanism is rooted in the nature of valley as a momentum space\nindex: the intervalley backscattering in general has valley contrasted rate due\nto the distinct momentum transfers, causing a net transfer of population from\none valley to another. As examples, we numerically demonstrate the sizable\nvalley pump effects driven by charge current in nanoribbons of monolayer TMDs,\nwhere the spin-orbit scattering by non-magnetic disorders also realizes spin\npump for the spin-valley locked holes.

An audio-visual spatiotemporal diarization model is proposed.

Multiple-person visual tracking is combined with multiple\nspeech-source localization in order to tackle the speech-to-person association\nproblem. The latter is solved within a novel audio-visual fusion method on the\nfollowing grounds: binaural spectral features are first extracted from a\nmicrophone pair, then a supervised audio-visual alignment technique maps these\nfeatures onto an image, and finally a semi-supervised clustering method assigns\nbinaural spectral features to visible persons. The main advantage of this\nmethod over previous work is that it processes in a principled way speech\nsignals uttered simultaneously by multiple persons. The diarization itself is\ncast into a latent-variable temporal graphical model that infers speaker\nidentities and speech turns, based on the output of an audio-visual association\nprocess, executed at each time slice, and on the dynamics of the diarization\nvariable itself. The proposed formulation yields an efficient exact inference\nprocedure.

We propose a\npost-gridding linear data embedding to the space spanned by the left singular\nvectors of the measurement operator, providing a dimensionality reduction below\nimage size.

The proposed reduction also preserves the i.i.d.\nGaussian properties of the original measurement noise. For convex\noptimization-based imaging algorithms, this is key to justify the use of the\nstandard L2-norm as the data fidelity term.

Second,\ndeviations of order ${\\cal O}(q^2)$ (i.e., of the same order or larger than the\nsingle-particle energy) are described by the operator product expansion, with a\nuniversal crossover connecting both regimes. The scaling is consistent with a\nnumber of sum rules in the large momentum limit. Furthermore, we derive an\nexact expression for the shift and width of the single-particle peak at large\nmomentum due to interactions, thus extending a result by Beliaev [JETP 7, 299\n(1958)] for the low-density Bose gas to arbitrary values of the scattering\nlength $a$. The shift exhibits a maximum around $qa \\simeq 1$, which is\nconnected with a maximum in the static structure factor due to strong\nshort-range correlations. For Bose gases with moderate interaction strengths,\nthe theoretically predicted shift is consistent with the value observed by Papp\net al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 135301 (2008)]. Finally, we develop a\ndiagrammatic theory for the dynamic structure factor which accounts for the\ncorrelations beyond Bogoliubov theory and which covers the full range of\nmomenta and frequencies, showing the correct asymptotic scaling at large\nmomentum.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 11 figures"]}]

Special cases of the SLM have been widely studied under\nvarious restricted assumptions during the past decade. Yet how to efficiently\nlearn the SLM under full generality still remains an open question due to\nseveral fundamental limitations of the conventional gradient descent learning\nframework. In this introductory study, we try to attack this problem from a\ngradient-free approach which we call the moment-estimation-sequence (MES)\nmethod. We show that the conventional gradient descent heuristic is biased by\nthe skewness of the distribution therefore is no longer the best practice of\nlearning the SLM. Based on the MES framework, we design a nonconvex alternating\niteration process to train a $d$-dimension rank-$k$ SLM within $O(kd)$ memory\nand one-pass of the dataset. The proposed method converges globally and\nlinearly, achieves $\\epsilon$ recovery error after retrieving\n$O[k^{2}d\\cdot\\mathrm{polylog}(kd/\\epsilon)]$ samples. Furthermore, our\ntheoretical analysis reveals that not all SLMs can be learned on every\nsub-gaussian distribution. When the instances are sampled from a so-called\n$\\tau$-MIP distribution, the SLM can be learned by $O(p/\\tau^{2})$ samples\nwhere $p$ and $\\tau$ are positive constants depending on the skewness and\nkurtosis of the distribution. For non-MIP distribution, an addition\ndiagonal-free oracle is necessary and sufficient to guarantee the learnability\nof the SLM. Numerical simulations verify the sharpness of our bounds on the\nsampling complexity and the linear convergence rate of our algorithm. Finally\nwe demonstrate several applications of the SLM on large-scale high dimensional\ndatasets.\n"]}]

When alpha is an integer,\nthese orthonormal bases can be expressed in terms of Laguerre functions. We\nstudy the reconstruction and speed of convergence properties of the\nwarping-based sampling.

However, the biology of QS\nremains incompletely understood in heterogeneous communities, where variant\nbacterial strains possess distinct QS systems that produce chemically unique\nAIs. AI molecules bind to 'cognate' receptors, but also to 'non-cognate'\nreceptors found in other strains, resulting in inter-strain crosstalk.\nUnderstanding these interactions is a prerequisite for deciphering the\nconsequences of crosstalk in real ecosystems, where multiple AIs are regularly\npresent in the same environment. As a step towards this goal, we map crosstalk\nin a heterogeneous community of variant QS strains onto an artificial neural\nnetwork model. This formulation allows us to systematically analyze how\ncrosstalk regulates the community's capacity for flexible decision making, as\nquantified by the Boltzmann entropy of all QS gene expression states of the\nsystem. In a mean-field limit of complete cross-inhibition between variant\nstrains, the model is exactly solvable, allowing for an analytical formula for\nthe number of variants that maximize capacity as a function of signal kinetics\nand activation parameters. An analysis of previous experimental results on the\nStaphylococcus aureus two-component Agr system indicates that the observed\ncombination of variant numbers, gene expression rates and threshold\nconcentrations lies near this critical regime of parameter space where capacity\npeaks.

The proof formalism of nested sequents was recently generalised\nto indexed nested sequents in order to yield cutfree proof calculi for\nextensions of the modal logic K by Geach (Lemmon-Scott) axioms. The proofs of\ncompleteness and cut-elimination therein were semantical and intricate.

Moreover, we find that the combination of these two channels exhibit\ndiminishing returns, meaning that the contribution of either of these learning\nchannels is redundant when the other one is present. Finally, we address\nendogeneity concerns by using the introduction of high-speed rail as an\ninstrument to isolate the effects of inter-regional learning. Our\ndifferences-in-differences (DID) analysis reveals that the introduction of high\nspeed-rail increased the industrial similarity of pairs of provinces connected\nby high-speed rail. Also, industries in provinces that were connected by rail\nincreased their productivity when they were connected by rail to other\nprovinces where that industry was already present.

At the same time the\nspecific nature of the disturbance to the upper atmosphere and the effect on\nradio propagation could be examined in detail using scientific instruments at\nminimum cost since most instruments would not have to be moved. This would\nallow prediction models to be tested in a controlled fashion. Contained within\nthis report are the details and results of the radio and ionospheric\nexperiments conducted by the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory during the 1999\ntotal solar eclipse. The promoting of the radio experiments with the general\npublic produced nearly 60 appearances on local and national TV, newspapers and\nperiodicals. Close to 1700 people responded to the general public medium wave\nexperiment and 16 million people looked in on the general eclipse web site\n(part funded by RA) that included the details of the radio experiments. A large\ndatabase of systematic observations across VLF to HF was collected from radio\namateurs and from the RA Regional Offices allowing comparisons to be made with\nITU estimates. There is a brief look at the scientific results and a forward\nlook as to how the analysis of this disturbance might have impact on the use of\nionospheric models for Space Weather tools in the future.\n","Comment: 41 pages, 33 Figures, government funded research final report,\n  unclassified"]}]

Near-IR images of six Group II disks in\nscattered light were obtained with VLT/NACO in Polarimetric Differential\nImaging, which is the most efficient technique to image the light scattered by\nthe disk material close to the stars. We compare the stellar/disk properties of\nthis sample with those of well-studied Group I sources available from the\nliterature. Three Group II disks are detected. The brightness distribution in\nthe disk of HD163296 indicates the presence of a persistent ring-like structure\nwith a possible connection with the CO snowline. A rather compact (less than\n100 AU) disk is detected around HD142666 and AK Sco. A taxonomic analysis of 17\nHerbig Ae/Be sources reveals that the difference between Group I and Group II\nis due to the presence or absence of a large disk cavity (larger than 5 AU).\nThere is no evidence supporting the evolution from Group I to Group II. Group\nII are not evolved version of the Group I. Within the Group II disks, very\ndifferent geometries (both self-shadowed and compact) exist. HD163296 could be\nthe primordial version of a typical Group I. Other Group II, like AK Sco and\nHD142666, could be smaller counterpart of Group I unable to open cavities as\nlarge as those of Group I.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication by A&A"]}]

Many\nstate-of-the-art systems use segment-level classifiers to select and rank\nproposal segments of pre-determined boundaries. However, a desirable model\nshould move beyond segment-level and make dense predictions at a fine\ngranularity in time to determine precise temporal boundaries.

It is unique in jointly modeling action semantics in space-time\nand fine-grained temporal dynamics. We train the CDC network in an end-to-end\nmanner efficiently. Our model not only achieves superior performance in\ndetecting actions in every frame, but also significantly boosts the precision\nof localizing temporal boundaries.

For\nexample, we show that under the Boolean Matrix Multiplication (BMM) conjecture\ncombinatorial algorithms cannot compute the (4/3 - {\\epsilon})-approximate\ndiameter of an undirected unweighted dense graph with truly subcubic\npreprocessing time and truly subquadratic update/query time. This result is\nsurprising since in the static setting it is not clear whether a reduction from\nBMM to diameter is possible. We further show under the BMM conjecture that many\nproblems, such as reachability or approximate shortest paths, cannot be solved\nfaster than by recomputation from scratch even after only one or two edge\ninsertions. We give more lower bounds under the Strong Exponential Time\nHypothesis and the All Pairs Shortest Paths Conjecture. Many of our lower\nbounds also hold for static oracle data structures where no sensitivity is\nrequired. Finally, we give the first algorithm for the (1 +\n{\\epsilon})-approximate radius, diameter, and eccentricity problems in directed\nor undirected unweighted graphs in case of single edges failures.

Monte Carlo simulations indicate\nthat a neutron capture efficiency of over 70% is achievable with a sufficient\nnumber of $^6$LiF:ZnS(Ag) screens per cube and that an appropriate segmentation\nenables a measurement of the positron energy which is not limited by gamma-ray\nleakage. First measurements of a single cell indicate that a very good\nneutron-gamma discrimination and high neutron detection efficiency can be\nobtained with adequate triggering techniques. The light yield from positron\nsignals has been measured, showing that an energy resolution of\n14%/$\\sqrt{E({\\mathrm{MeV}})}$ is achievable with high uniformity. A\npreliminary neutrino signal analysis has been developed, using selection\ncriteria for pulse shape, energy, time structure and energy spatial\ndistribution and showing that an antineutrino efficiency of 40% can be\nachieved. It also shows that the fine segmentation of the detector can be used\nto significantly decrease both correlated and accidental backgrounds.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 15 figures, submitted to JINST"]}]

Methods. Mock catalogues of galaxy clusters are extracted from the\nN-body PLUS simulation.

By stacking their modulus, a statistical estimator is built to\ncharacterise the angular mass distribution around clusters.

The observed elemental abundances can be explained by\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) nucleosynthesis models for initially 1-1.5 Msun\nstars with Z = 0.008. The Ne overabundance might be due to the enhancement of\n22Ne isotope in the He-rich intershell. By using the spectrum of the central\nstar synthesized by Tlusty as the ionization/heating source of the PN, we\nconstructed the self-consistent photoionization model with Cloudy to the\nobserved quantities, and we derived the gas and dust masses, dust-to-gas mass\nratio, and core-mass of the central star. About 80 % of the total dust mass is\nfrom warm-cold dust component beyond ionization front. Comparison with other\nGalactic PNe indicates that Hen3-1357 is an ordinary amorphous silicate rich\nand O-rich gas PN. Among other studied PNe, IC4846 shows many similarities in\nproperties of the PN to Hen3-1357, although their post-AGB evolution is quite\ndifferent from each other. Further monitoring observations and comparisons with\nother PNe such as IC4846 are necessary to understand the evolution of\nHen3-1357.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 7 figures, 12 tables, Accepted for publication by the\n  Astrophysical Journal"]}]

The use of a\nfractal space allows one to naturally define a momentum for a bound wave\nfunction.

The\nredshift evolution of $v_\\rm{out}$ ($v_\\rm{max}$) and $\\eta$ are probably\nexplained by high gas fractions in high-redshift massive galaxies, which is\nsupported by recent radio observations. We obtain a scaling relation of\n$\\eta\\propto v_\\rm{cir}^a$ for $a=-0.5\\pm1.1$ in our $z\\sim0$ galaxies. This\nscaling relation agrees well with the momentum-driven outflow model ($a=-1$)\nwithin the uncertainty.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 8 figures, submitted to ApJ"]}]

In most surviving populations, alleles\ncontaining at least one known large-effect beneficial mutation were present.\nThese genotype data also support a model which only invokes sampling effects to\ndescribe the occurrence of alleles containing large-effect driver mutations.\nHence, evolution is largely predictable given cursory knowledge of mutational\nfitness effects, the mutation rate and population size. There were no clear\ntrends in the repeatability of selected mutants when we considered all\nmutations present.

In the symmetric case, i.e., zero\nhard-limiting offset, it is well-understood that in the low signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) regime the signal processing performance degrades moderately by\n${2}/{\\pi}$ ($-1.96$ dB) when comparing to an ideal $\\infty$-bit converter. Due\nto hardware imperfections, low-complexity $1$-bit ADCs will in practice exhibit\nan unknown threshold different from zero. Therefore, the offset has to be\nestimated jointly with the signal parameters. Here we study the estimation\naccuracy which can be obtained with receive data preprocessed by a hard-limiter\nwith unknown quantization level. In order to characterize the achievable\nperformance, we employ analytic error expressions for different setups while\nmodeling the offset as a nuisance parameter. In the low SNR regime we establish\nthe necessary condition for a vanishing loss due to missing offset knowledge at\na receiver with $1$-bit ADC.
