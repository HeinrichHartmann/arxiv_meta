Using the 3sigma\nupper limit of the flux in the optical to mid-infrared observing bands, which\ncorresponds to the UV to optical bands in the rest-frame of the intervening\nabsorbers, we constrained the star-formation rates and stellar masses of the\nhosts. We estimated the star-formation rates for the intervening absorbers as <\n2.5 Msun/yr for z>3 DLAs and < 1.0 Msun/yr for z~2 MgII systems. Their stellar\nmasses are estimated to be several times 10^9 Msun or smaller for all\nintervening galaxies. These properties are comparable to dwarf galaxies, rather\nthan the massive star-forming galaxies commonly seen in the z>2 galaxy surveys\nbased on emission-line selection or color selection.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures, Accepted for publication in The Astronomical\n  Journal"]}]

The photometric system was designed to\nmaximize the effective depth of the survey in terms of accurate spectral-type\nand photo-zs estimation along with the capability of identification of\nrelatively faint emission lines.

We calculate photometric redshifts with the BPZ2\ncode, which includes new empirically calibrated templates and priors.

However, HII\nregions associated with recent star-formation may not have abundances typical\nfor the galaxy as a whole and it is believed that the bulk of the metals may be\ncontained in the neutral gas. It is therefore important to directly probe the\nmetal abundances in the neutral gas, which can be done by using absorption\nlines imprinted on a background quasar. Recently, we have presented studies of\nthe stellar content of a small sample of such quasar absorbers with HI column\ndensities measured to be in the sub-Damped Lyman-alpha to Damped Lyman-alpha\nrange. Here, we present observations covering 300 nm to 2.5 microns of emission\nline spectra of three of these absorbing-galaxies using the long-slit\nspectrograph X-Shooter on the VLT. This allows us to compare the neutral and\nionised phase metallicities in the same objects and relates these measures to\npossible signature of low-metallicity gas accretion or outflows of gas enriched\nby star formation. Our results suggest that the abundances derived in\nabsorption along the line-of-sight to background quasars are reliable measures\nof the overall galaxy metallicities. In addition to a comparison of abundances\nin different phases of the gas, a potential observational consequence of\ndifferences in fueling mechanisms for disc galaxies is the internal\ndistribution of their chemical abundances. We present some evidence for small\nnegative metallicity gradients in the three systems. The flat slopes are in\nline with the differences observed between the two phases of the gas.

Whilst usually stated as between\nGR and QM, in fact 8/9ths of it is already present at the classical level. Thus\nwe adopt a `top-down' classical and then quantum approach. I consider a local\nresolution to the Problem of Time that is Machian, which was previously\nrealized for relational triangle and minisuperspace models. This resolution has\nthree levels: classical, semiclassical and combined\nsemiclassical-histories-records. This article's specific model is a slightly\ninhomogeneous cosmology considered for now at the classical level. This is\nmotivated by how the inhomogeneous fluctuations that underlie structure\nformation - galaxies and CMB hotspots - might have been seeded by quantum\ncosmological fluctuations, as magnified by some inflationary mechanism. In\nparticular, I consider the perturbations about $S^3$ case of this involving up\nto second order, which has a number of parallels with the Halliwell-Hawking\nmodel but has a number of conceptual differences and useful upgrades. The\narticle's main features are that the elimination part of the model's thin\nsandwich is straightforward, but the modewise split of the constraints fail to\nbe first-class constraints. Thus the elimination part only arises as an\nintermediate geometry between superspace and Riem.

The typical Halpha luminosity of these sources is\nsignificantly lower than that of field galaxies at similar redshifts, but\ngreater than that found for A1689, a rich cluster at z~0.2. The Halpha\nluminosities of our objects translate into star-formation rates (SFRs) between\n~0.02 and 6 Msun/yr. Comparing the relationship between stellar mass and\nHalpha-derived SFR with that found in the field indicates a suppression of star\nformation in the cores of the clusters. These findings agree with previous\ninvestigations of this multi-cluster structure, based on other star formation\nindicators, and demonstrate the power of tuneable filters for this kind of\nstudy.\n","Comment: MNRAS accepted, 19 pages, 20 figures,1 table"]}]

Three examples of these, namely\nmaterial free surface evolution, deformation of a grain column below the punch\nand resolution of velocities inside the primary shear band, are highlighted.\nThe variety of flow features observed in this model problem also illustrates\nthe difficulty involved in formulating a complete micromechanical analytical\ndescription of the deformation.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 11 figures"]}]

We briefly discuss models introduced to discern the physics behind\nthe experimental discoveries, such as the shell model, the collective model,\nthe statistical model, the interacting boson model, etc., some of these models\nmay be seemingly in conflict with each other, but this was shown to be only\napparent.\n  The richness of the ideas and abundance of theoretical models attests to the\nimportant fact that the nucleus is a really singular system in the sense that\nit evolves from two-body bound states such as the deuteron, to few-body bound\nstates, such as $^4$He, $^7$Li, $^9$Be etc. and up the ladder to heavier bound\nnuclei containing up to more than 200 nucleons.

However,\nthis is only true when one ignores the refractive effects of the exoplanet's\natmosphere. I illustrate with a suite of simple isothermal clear Jovian H2-He\natmosphere models with various abundances of water that refraction can decrease\nsignificantly the spectral slope of the Rayleigh continuum and that it becomes\nflat in the infrared.

Indeed, refraction breaks in\nlarge part the retrieval degeneracy between abundances of chemical species and\nthe planet's radius because the size of spectral features increases\nsignificantly with abundances, in stark contrast with the non-refractive case\nwhich simply shifts them to a larger or smaller effective radius.

It has been shown in Nature that individuals in animal\ngroups develop the capacity to perceive this signal and the social interactions\nbetween them produce complex group behavior e.g. schooling fish. Previous work\non collective sensing shows that gregarious individuals obtain an evolutionary\nadvantage when competing against solitary individuals. It is still unclear if\nand under which conditions groups are evolutionarily stable formations. The\nquestion this work addresses is whether collective sensing allows for the\nemergence of groups from a population of individuals without pre-determined\nbehaviors. Experiments are run in an agent-based evolutionary model of a\nforaging task, where the fitness of the agents depends on their foraging\nstrategy. Agents compete for the same limited resources and neither the\nenvironment nor inter-group dynamics advantage groups over individuals. The\nbehavior of agents is determined by a model-free neural network, which is\nrandomly initialized. The advantage of a model-free approach is that it does\nnot impose any constraints on the agent behavior, allowing evolution to explore\na higher number of strategies. Results show that a population of gregarious\nagents, which are able to exploit collective sensing, has a higher fitness than\na competing population of random walkers, under some environmental conditions.\nIn particular, previous results linking the evolution of collective behavior to\nfood scarcity are confirmed. Further results show that groups can emerge in a\npopulation of randomly-initialized agents, in response to a reduction of\nresources in the environment.\n"]}]

Instead, we argue that those strong lower bounds\npoint to a limitation of the previous model in that it must consider wildly\nasymmetric scenarios which do not hold in typical applications.\n  To better understand other difficulties of adaptivity, we propose a new\nBayesian version of the problem that mandates symmetry. Since the other lower\nbound techniques are ruled out, we can more effectively see difficulties that\nmight otherwise be overshadowed. As a first contribution to this model, we\nproduce a new problem using error-correcting codes on which a large family of\nmethods, including all previously proposed algorithms, require roughly\n$n\\sim\\sqrt[4]q$. These early results illustrate new difficulties in adaptive\ndata analysis regarding slightly correlated queries on problems with\nconcentrated uncertainty.\n"]}]

We\ncalibrate our physical model using a novel approach to create realistic\ngalaxies at z=0, so the simulation is predictive at high redshifts. With this\napproach we can (1) robustly predict the evolution of the galaxy UV luminosity\nfunction at faint magnitudes down to $M_\\mathrm{UV}$~-15, two magnitudes\nfainter than observations, and (2) estimate $f_\\mathrm{esc}$ over a large range\nof galaxy masses based on the detailed stellar and gas distributions in\nresolved galaxies. We find steep faint end slopes, implying high number\ndensities of faint galaxies, and the dependence of $f_\\mathrm{esc}$ on the UV\nmagnitude of a galaxy, given by the power-law: log $f_\\mathrm{esc} = (0.51 \\pm\n0.04)M_\\mathrm{UV} + 7.3 \\pm 0.8$, with the faint population having\n$f_\\mathrm{esc}$~35%. Convolving the UV luminosity function with\n$f_\\mathrm{esc}$($M_\\mathrm{UV}$), we find an ionizing emissivity that is (1)\ndominated by the faintest galaxies and (2) reionizes the universe at the\nappropriate rate, consistent with observational constraints of the ionizing\nemissivity and the optical depth to the decoupling surface tau_es, without the\nneed for additional sources of ionizing radiation.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 12 Figures, Accepted for publication to MNRAS"]}]

This modification of the collinear factorization formula goes\nbeyond the leading power and thus a natural question arises if such cutoff can\nbe extracted from a formalism which takes into account power corrections. In\nthis work, we consider the High Energy Factorization (HEF) valid at small $x$\nand a new model, based on a similar principle to HEF, which in addition has a\nlimit respecting the Dokshitzer-Dyakonov-Troyan formula for the dijet momentum\ndisbalance spectrum. Minijet cross section and its suppression is then analyzed\nin two ways. First, we study minijets directly in the low-$p_T$ region, and\ndemonstrate that higher twist corrections do generate suppression of the\ninclusive jet production cross section though these effects are not leading to\nthe increase of the cutoff with incident energy. Second, we consider hard\ninclusive dijet production where Multi Parton Interactions (MPIs) with minijets\nproduce power corrections. We introduce an observable constructed from\ndifferential cross section in the ratio $\\tau$ of dijet disbalance to the\naverage dijet $p_T$ and demonstrate that the $\\tau>1$ region is sensitive to\nthe cutoff $p_{T0}$ in the MPI minijet models.

The\n$NuSTAR$ data show extreme variability in both the flux and spectral properties\nof the source. This is partly driven by strong and variable line-of-sight\nabsorption, similar to previous outbursts. The latter stages of this\nobservation are dominated by strong flares, reaching luminosities close to\nEddington.

Here we use the differences\nof a measure based on Euclidean distance between the natural orbital occupation\nnumber (NOON) vector of the Slater determinant (SD) from the exact solution in\nthe NOON vector space, that can be viewed as a measure of SD inequivalency and\na measure of the expected degree of nondynamic-correlation-related bias in\nFN-DMC energy differences. This is explored on a set of small noncovalent\ncomplexes and covalent bond breaking of Si$_2$ vs. N$_2$. It turns out that\nNOON-based measures well reflect the magnitude and sign of the bias present in\nthe data available, thus providing new insights to the nature of bias\ncancellation in SD FN-DMC energy differences.\n"]}]

We aimed to design a short version whilst preserving\nits psychometric quality. METHODS: Study partners of subjects (n=1355), ranging\nfrom cognitively normal to dementia subjects, completed the original A-IADL-Q.\nWe selected the short version items using a stepwise procedure combining\nmissing data, Item Response Theory and input from respondents and experts. We\ninvestigated internal consistency of the short version as well as concordance\nwith the original version. To assess its construct validity, we additionally\ninvestigated concordance between the short version and the Mini-Mental State\nExamination (MMSE) and Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD). Lastly, we\ninvestigated differences in IADL scores between diagnostic groups across the\ndementia spectrum. RESULTS: We selected 30 items covering the entire spectrum\nof IADL functioning. Internal consistency (.98) and concordance with the\noriginal version (.97) were very high. Concordance with the MMSE (.72) and DAD\n(.87) scores was high. IADL impairment scores increased across the spectrum\nfrom normal cognition to dementia. DISCUSSION: The A-IADL-Q Short Version\n(A-IADL-Q-SV) consists of 30 items.

The stellar and accretion properties of the 81 bona\nfide YSOs, which represent more than 90% of the whole class~II and transition\ndisc YSO population in the aforementioned Lupus clouds, have been homogeneously\nand self-consistently derived, allowing for an unbiased study of accretion and\nits relationship with stellar parameters. The accretion luminosity, Lacc,\nincreases with the stellar luminosity, Lstar, with an overall slope of ~1.6,\nsimilar but with a smaller scatter than in previous studies. There is a\nsignificant lack of strong accretors below Lstar~0.1Lsun, where Lacc is always\nlower than 0.01Lstar. We argue that the Lacc-Lstar slope is not due to\nobservational biases, but is a true property of the Lupus YSOs. The\nlogMacc-logMstar correlation shows a statistically significant evidence of a\nbreak, with a steeper relation for Mstar<0.2Msun and a flatter slope for higher\nmasses. The bimodality of the Macc-Mstar relation is confirmed with four\ndifferent evolutionary models used to derive the stellar mass. The bimodal\nbehaviour of the observed relationship supports the importance of modelling\nself-gravity in the early evolution of the more massive discs, but other\nprocesses, such as photo evaporation and planet formation during the YSO's\nlifetime, may also lead to disc dispersal on different timescales depending on\nthe stellar mass.

(2013) but less extreme.\nIn particular, we find the inner disk radius at about 13 R_g and an inclination\nangle with respect to the line of sight of about 27 deg. We conclude that,\nwhile the choice of the reflection model has little impact on the disk\nparameters, as soon as a self-consistent model is used, the choice of the\ncontinuum model can be important in the precise determination of the disk\nparameters from the reflection component. Hence broad-band X-ray spectra are\nhighly preferable to constrain the continuum and disk parameters.\n","Comment: 13 pages including 8 figures. Accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

In this paper, we address the\nlatter issue through a pair of global disc simulations. Here, we only consider\ncases of initially purely toroidal magnetic fields contained entirely within a\ncompact torus. We find that, over only a few tens of orbital periods, the\nmagnetization of an initially strongly magnetized disc,\n$P_\\mathrm{mag}/P_\\mathrm{gas} \\ge 10$, drops to $\\lesssim 0.1$, similar to the\nsteady-state value reached in initially weakly magnetized discs. This is\nconsistent with recent shearing box simulations with initially strong toroidal\nfields, the robust conclusion being that strongly magnetized toroidal fields\ncan not be locally self-sustaining. These results appear to leave net poloidal\nflux or extended radial fields as the only avenues for establishing strongly\nmagnetized discs, ruling out the thermal collapse scenario.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 7 figures, accepted to MNRAS"]}]

If FRBs repeat for decades or centuies, a\nlocal FRB could be active now. A typical Galactic FRB would produce a\nmillisecond radio pulse with ~1 GHz flux density of ~3E10 Jy, comparable to the\nradio flux levels and frequencies of cellular communication devices (cell\nphones, Wi-Fi, GPS). We propose to search for Galactic FRBs using a global\narray of low-cost radio receivers. One possibility is to use the ~1GHz\ncommunication channel in cellular phones through a Citizens-Science\ndownloadable application. Participating phones would continuously listen for\nand record candidate FRBs and would periodically upload information to a\ncentral data processing website, which correlates the incoming data from all\nparticipants, to identify the signature of a real, globe-encompassing, FRB from\nan astronomical distance. Triangulation of the GPS-based pulse arrival times\nreported from different locations will provide the FRB sky position,\npotentially to arc-second accuracy. Pulse arrival times from phones operating\nat diverse frequencies, or from an on-device de-dispersion search, will yield\nthe dispersion measure (DM) which will indicate the FRB source distance within\nthe Galaxy. A variant of this approach would be to use the built-in ~100 MHz\nFM-radio receivers present in cell phones for an FRB search at lower\nfrequencies. Alternatively, numerous \"software-defined radio\" (SDR) devices,\ncosting ~$10 US each, could be plugged into USB ports of personal computers\naround the world (particularly in radio quiet regions) to establish the global\nnetwork of receivers.\n","Comment: 5 pages, MNRAS, in press"]}]

The Large Magellanic Cloud"],"description":["  The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the closest star forming galaxy with low\nmetallicity, provides an ideal laboratory to study star formation in such an\nenvironment. The classical dense molecular gas thermometer NH3 is rarely\navailable in a low metallicity environment because of photoionization and a\nlack of nitrogen atoms. Our goal is to directly measure the gas kinetic\ntemperature with formaldehyde toward six star-forming regions in the LMC. Three\nrotational transitions of para-H2CO near 218 GHz were observed with the APEX\n12m telescope toward six star forming regions in the LMC. Those data are\ncomplemented by C18O 2-1 spectra. Using non-LTE modeling with RADEX, we derive\nthe gas kinetic temperature and spatial density, using as constraints the\nmeasured para-H2CO 321-220/303-202 and para-H2CO 303-202/C18O 2-1 ratios.\nExcluding the quiescent cloud N159S, where only one para-H2CO line could be\ndetected, the gas kinetic temperatures derived from the preferred para-H2CO\n321-220/303-202 line ratios range from 35 to 63 K with an average of 47 K.\nSpatial densities of the gas derived from the paraH2CO 303-202/C18O 2-1 line\nratios yield 0.4-2.9x10^5 cm^-3 with an average of 1.5x10^5 cm^-3. Temperatures\nderived from the para-H2CO line ratio are similar to those obtained with the\nsame method from Galactic star forming regions and agree with results derived\nfrom CO in the dense regions of the LMC. A comparison of kinetic temperatures\nderived from para-H2CO with those from the dust also shows good agreement. This\nsuggests that the dust and para-H2CO are well mixed in the studied star forming\nregions. A correlation between the gas kinetic temperatures derived from\npara-H2CO and infrared luminosity, represented by the 250um flux, suggests that\nthe kinetic temperatures traced by para-H2CO are correlated with the ongoing\nmassive star formation in the LMC.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

For the case of deterministic periodic driving, the first\npassage time probability density function (pdf) displays a complex,\nmulti-peaked behavior, which depends crucially on the details of initial phase,\nfrequency, and strength of the driving. As an interesting feature we find that\nthe mean first passage time enters the resonant activation regime at a critical\nfrequency $\\nu^*$ which depends very weakly on the strength of the driving.\nMoreover, we provide the relation between the first passage time pdf and the\nstatistics of residence times.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 13 figures"]}]

The likely progenitors of today's most massive galaxies are remarkably\nsmall, disky, passive and have already assembled much of their stellar mass at\nredshift z=2. An in-depth analysis of these objects, however, is currently not\nfeasible due to the lack of high-quality, spatially-resolved photometric and\nspectroscopic data. In this paper, we present a sample of nearby compact\nelliptical galaxies (CEGs), which bear resemblance to the massive and quiescent\ngalaxy population at earlier times. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and wide-field\nintegral field unit (IFU) data have been obtained, and are used to constrain\norbit-based dynamical models and stellar population synthesis (SPS) fits, to\nunravel their structural and dynamical properties. We first show that our\ngalaxies are outliers in the present-day stellar mass-size relation. They are,\nhowever, consistent with the mass-size relation of compact, massive and\nquiescent galaxies at redshift z=2. The compact sizes of our nearby galaxies\nimply high central stellar mass surface densities, which are also in agreement\nwith the massive galaxy population at higher redshift, hinting at strong\ndissipational processes during their formation. Corroborating evidence for a\nlargely passive evolution within the last 10 Gyr is provided by their orbital\ndistribution as well as their stellar populations, which are difficult to\nreconcile with a very active (major) merging history. This all supports that we\ncan use nearby CEGs as local analogues of the high-redshift, massive and\nquiescent galaxy population, thus providing additional constraints for models\nof galaxy formation and evolution.\n","Comment: 33 pages, 27 figures and 20 tables (with most of the tables provided\n  as online-only supporting information).

Therefore, we use trigonometric parallax from the {\\it\nGaia DR1} for VY~Pyx and the {\\it Hubble Space Telescope} parallaxes for\n$k$~Pav and 5 RR Lyrae variables to obtain an absolute calibration of the\nGalactic $K_s$-band P-L relation, resulting in a distance modulus to the LMC of\n$\\mu_{\\rm LMC} = 18.54\\pm0.08$~mag. We update the mean magnitudes of Pop~II\nCepheids in Galactic globular clusters using our light curve templates and\nobtain distance estimates to those systems, anchored to a precise late-type\neclipsing binary distance to the LMC.

At irregular intervals\nwithin the magnetic depressions are long-lived pairs of magnetic islands where\nthe magnetic field direction reverses so that spacecraft data would reveal\nsharp magnetic field depressions with only occasional crossings with jumps in\nmagnetic field direction. This is typical of the magnetic field data from the\nVoyager spacecraft \\citep{Burlaga11,Burlaga16}.

This H+ may then dissolve relict soil CaCO3 carbonate\n(calcite), to release Ca+2 calcium cations and more HCO3- bicarbonate. When\nconditions allow, one mole of Ca+2 and two moles of HCO3- combine to\nprecipitate one mole of calcite, and to release one mole of CO2: Ca+2 + 2HCO3-\n--> CaCO3 + CO2 + H2O. However, it has been claimed that such carbonates do not\nsequester significant amounts of present day atmospheric CO2. The reasons given\nwere that they originate in part from the pre-existing limestone; and that for\nevery mole of calcite precipitated, one mole of CO2 may be liberated to the\natmosphere. It was argued that only if the Ca+2 cation is derived from a\nnon-carbonate source can sequestration be assumed. We have tested these\nassumptions under field conditions at two semi-arid sites in Israel. We found\nthat bicarbonate, originating from root exhalation, is depleted and is\nincorporated within the USZ as carbonates precipitate. Thus, a net\nsequestration of atmospheric CO2 does occur under semi-arid forests.

We\ntrack $T^\\star$ as a function of doping and find that it decreases linearly vs\n$p$ in all four materials, having the same value in the three LSCO-based\ncuprates, irrespective of their different crystal structures. At low $p$,\n$T^\\star$ is higher than the onset temperature of the various orders observed\nin underdoped cuprates, suggesting that these orders are secondary\ninstabilities of the pseudogap phase. A linear extrapolation of $T^\\star(p)$ to\n$p=0$ yields $T^\\star(p\\to 0)\\simeq T_N(0)$, the N\\'eel temperature for the\nonset of antiferromagnetic order at $p=0$, suggesting that there is a link\nbetween pseudogap and antiferromagnetism. With increasing $p$, $T^\\star(p)$\nextrapolates linearly to zero at $p\\simeq p_{\\rm c2}$, the critical doping\nbelow which superconductivity emerges at high doping, suggesting that the\nconditions which favour pseudogap formation also favour pairing. We also use\nthe Nernst effect to investigate how far superconducting fluctuations extend\nabove $T_{\\rm c}$, as a function of doping, and find that a narrow fluctuation\nregime tracks $T_{\\rm c}$, and not $T^\\star$. This confirms that the pseudogap\nphase is not a form of precursor superconductivity.\n","Comment: 25 pages and 24 figures including Appendix"]}]

Distributed sensor networks are often used for automated\nclassification and detection of abnormal events in high-stakes situations, e.g.\nfire in buildings, earthquakes, or crowd disasters. Such networks might\ntransmit privacy-sensitive information, e.g. GPS location of smartphones, which\nmight be disclosed if the network is compromised. Privacy concerns might slow\ndown the adoption of the technology, in particular in the scenario of social\nsensing where participation is voluntary, thus solutions are needed which\nimprove privacy without compromising on the event detection accuracy.

Many databases on asteroid brightnesses (e.g. ALCDEF, WISE) are\npotential sources for extensive asteroid shape and spin modelling. Individual\nlightcurve inversion models require several apparitions and hundreds of data\npoints per target. However, we can analyse the coarse shape and spin\ndistributions over populations of at least thousands of targets even if there\nare only a few points and one apparition per asteroid. This is done by\nexamining the distribution of the brightness variations observed within the\nchosen population.\n  Aims. Brightness variation has been proposed as a population-scale rather\nthan individual-target observable in two studies so far. We aim to examine this\napproach rigorously to establish its theoretical validity, degree of\nill-posedness, and practical applicability.\n  Methods. We model the observed brightness variation of a target population by\nconsidering its cumulative distribution function (CDF) caused by the joint\ndistribution function of two fundamental shape and spin indicators. These are\nthe shape elongation and the spin latitude of a simple ellipsoidal model. The\nmain advantage of the model is that we can derive analytical basis functions\nthat yield the observed CDF as a function of the shape and spin distribution.\nThe inverse problem can be treated linearly. Even though the inaccuracy of the\nmodel is considerable, databases of thousands of targets should yield some\ninformation on the distribution.\n  Results.

We combine chemical and radiative transfer simulations in the\ncontext of a modified Bonnor-Ebert sphere to model the effect of chemistry on\nthe gas temperature, and study the effect of temperature changes on core\nstability.\n  Results. We find that chemistry has in general very little effect on the\nnondimensional radius $\\xi_{\\rm out}$ which parametrizes the core stability.\nCores that are initially stable or unstable tend to stay near their initial\nstates, in terms of stability (i.e., $\\xi_{\\rm out} \\sim$ constant), as the\nchemistry develops.

While the CO(6-5) line wing emission shows an outflow\nlobe in the north-western direction emanating from source #1, the dense gas\ntracer CH3CN shows a velocity gradient perpendicular to the outflow that is\nindicative of rotational motions. Absorption profile measurements against the\nsubmm source #2 indicate infall rates on the order of 10^{-4} to\n10^{-3}M_sun/yr which can be considered as an upper limit of the mean accretion\nrates. The position-velocity diagrams are consistent with a central rotating\ndisk-like structure embedded in an infalling envelope, but they may also be\ninfluenced by the outflow. Using the CH_3CN(37_k-36_k) k-ladder with excitation\ntemperatures up to 1300K, we derive a gas temperature map of source #1\nexhibiting temperatures often in excess of 1000K. Brightness temperatures of\nthe submm continuum never exceed 200K. This discrepancy between gas\ntemperatures and submm dust brightness temperatures (in the optically thick\nlimit) indicates that the dust may trace the disk mid-plane whereas the gas\ncould be tracing a hotter gaseous disk surface layer. In addition, we conduct a\npixel-by-pixel Toomre gravitational stability analysis of the central rotating\nstructure. The derived high Q values throughout the structure confirm that this\ncentral region appears stable against gravitational instability.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 12 figures, accepted for Astronomy & astrophysics, a\n  high-resolution version of the draft can be found at\n  http://www.mpia-hd.mpg.de/homes/beuther/papers.html"]}]

The UV slope $\\beta$ (assuming\n$f_\\lambda \\propto \\lambda^\\beta$) correlates with the GALEX FUV-NUV color if\nthe sample is restricted to galaxies below $z < 0.1$. Taking advantage of the\nUV and IR data, we estimate the dust attenuation from the IR/UV ratio and\ncompare it to the UV slope $\\beta$. We find that it is not possible to uniquely\nestimate the dust attenuation from $\\beta$ for our sample of galaxies. These\ngalaxies are highly extinguished with a median value $A_{FUV} = 2.7 \\pm 0.8$.\nOnce the dust correction applied, the UV- and IR-based SFRs correlate. For the\nclosest galaxy with the best quality spectrum, we see a feature consistent with\nbeing produced by a bump near 220nm in the attenuation curve.\n","Comment: This paper has been published as part of the GALEX ApJL Special Issue\n  (ApJ 619, L63)"]}]
