Using the 3sigma\nupper limit of the flux in the optical to mid-infrared observing bands, which\ncorresponds to the UV to optical bands in the rest-frame of the intervening\nabsorbers, we constrained the star-formation rates and stellar masses of the\nhosts. We estimated the star-formation rates for the intervening absorbers as <\n2.5 Msun/yr for z>3 DLAs and < 1.0 Msun/yr for z~2 MgII systems. Their stellar\nmasses are estimated to be several times 10^9 Msun or smaller for all\nintervening galaxies. These properties are comparable to dwarf galaxies, rather\nthan the massive star-forming galaxies commonly seen in the z>2 galaxy surveys\nbased on emission-line selection or color selection.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures, Accepted for publication in The Astronomical\n  Journal"]}]

The observations,\ncarried out with the Calar Alto 3.5m telescope using the wide field (0.25 sq.\ndeg FOV) optical camera LAICA and the NIR instrument Omega-2000, correspond to\n~700hrs on-target science images. The photometric system was designed to\nmaximize the effective depth of the survey in terms of accurate spectral-type\nand photo-zs estimation along with the capability of identification of\nrelatively faint emission lines.

The photometric ZP have\nbeen calibrated using stellar transformation equations and refined internally,\nusing a new technique based on the highly robust photometric redshifts measured\nfor emission line galaxies. We calculate photometric redshifts with the BPZ2\ncode, which includes new empirically calibrated templates and priors. Our\nphoto-zs have a precision of $dz/(1+z_s)=1%$ for I<22.5 and 1.4% for\n22.5<I<24.5.

However, HII\nregions associated with recent star-formation may not have abundances typical\nfor the galaxy as a whole and it is believed that the bulk of the metals may be\ncontained in the neutral gas. It is therefore important to directly probe the\nmetal abundances in the neutral gas, which can be done by using absorption\nlines imprinted on a background quasar. Recently, we have presented studies of\nthe stellar content of a small sample of such quasar absorbers with HI column\ndensities measured to be in the sub-Damped Lyman-alpha to Damped Lyman-alpha\nrange. Here, we present observations covering 300 nm to 2.5 microns of emission\nline spectra of three of these absorbing-galaxies using the long-slit\nspectrograph X-Shooter on the VLT. This allows us to compare the neutral and\nionised phase metallicities in the same objects and relates these measures to\npossible signature of low-metallicity gas accretion or outflows of gas enriched\nby star formation. Our results suggest that the abundances derived in\nabsorption along the line-of-sight to background quasars are reliable measures\nof the overall galaxy metallicities. In addition to a comparison of abundances\nin different phases of the gas, a potential observational consequence of\ndifferences in fueling mechanisms for disc galaxies is the internal\ndistribution of their chemical abundances. We present some evidence for small\nnegative metallicity gradients in the three systems. The flat slopes are in\nline with the differences observed between the two phases of the gas.

Whilst usually stated as between\nGR and QM, in fact 8/9ths of it is already present at the classical level. Thus\nwe adopt a `top-down' classical and then quantum approach. I consider a local\nresolution to the Problem of Time that is Machian, which was previously\nrealized for relational triangle and minisuperspace models. This resolution has\nthree levels: classical, semiclassical and combined\nsemiclassical-histories-records. This article's specific model is a slightly\ninhomogeneous cosmology considered for now at the classical level. This is\nmotivated by how the inhomogeneous fluctuations that underlie structure\nformation - galaxies and CMB hotspots - might have been seeded by quantum\ncosmological fluctuations, as magnified by some inflationary mechanism. In\nparticular, I consider the perturbations about $S^3$ case of this involving up\nto second order, which has a number of parallels with the Halliwell-Hawking\nmodel but has a number of conceptual differences and useful upgrades. The\narticle's main features are that the elimination part of the model's thin\nsandwich is straightforward, but the modewise split of the constraints fail to\nbe first-class constraints. Thus the elimination part only arises as an\nintermediate geometry between superspace and Riem.

AGN and star-forming (SF) objects are identified using\nthe [NII]/Halpha vs. W_Halpha (WHAN) diagnostic diagram.

The typical Halpha luminosity of these sources is\nsignificantly lower than that of field galaxies at similar redshifts, but\ngreater than that found for A1689, a rich cluster at z~0.2. The Halpha\nluminosities of our objects translate into star-formation rates (SFRs) between\n~0.02 and 6 Msun/yr. Comparing the relationship between stellar mass and\nHalpha-derived SFR with that found in the field indicates a suppression of star\nformation in the cores of the clusters. These findings agree with previous\ninvestigations of this multi-cluster structure, based on other star formation\nindicators, and demonstrate the power of tuneable filters for this kind of\nstudy.\n","Comment: MNRAS accepted, 19 pages, 20 figures,1 table"]}]

Three examples of these, namely\nmaterial free surface evolution, deformation of a grain column below the punch\nand resolution of velocities inside the primary shear band, are highlighted.\nThe variety of flow features observed in this model problem also illustrates\nthe difficulty involved in formulating a complete micromechanical analytical\ndescription of the deformation.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 11 figures"]}]

We briefly discuss models introduced to discern the physics behind\nthe experimental discoveries, such as the shell model, the collective model,\nthe statistical model, the interacting boson model, etc., some of these models\nmay be seemingly in conflict with each other, but this was shown to be only\napparent.\n  The richness of the ideas and abundance of theoretical models attests to the\nimportant fact that the nucleus is a really singular system in the sense that\nit evolves from two-body bound states such as the deuteron, to few-body bound\nstates, such as $^4$He, $^7$Li, $^9$Be etc. and up the ladder to heavier bound\nnuclei containing up to more than 200 nucleons.

However,\nthis is only true when one ignores the refractive effects of the exoplanet's\natmosphere. I illustrate with a suite of simple isothermal clear Jovian H2-He\natmosphere models with various abundances of water that refraction can decrease\nsignificantly the spectral slope of the Rayleigh continuum and that it becomes\nflat in the infrared. This mimics a surface, or an optically thick cloud deck,\nat much smaller pressures than one can probe in the non-refractive case. The\nrelative impact of refraction on an exoplanet's transmission spectrum decreases\nwith atmospheric temperatures and increases with stellar temperature.\nRefraction is quite important from a retrieval's perspective for Jovian-like\nplanets even at the highest atmospheric temperatures (1200 K) considered in\nthis paper, and for all stellar spectral types. Indeed, refraction breaks in\nlarge part the retrieval degeneracy between abundances of chemical species and\nthe planet's radius because the size of spectral features increases\nsignificantly with abundances, in stark contrast with the non-refractive case\nwhich simply shifts them to a larger or smaller effective radius.

It has been shown in Nature that individuals in animal\ngroups develop the capacity to perceive this signal and the social interactions\nbetween them produce complex group behavior e.g. schooling fish. Previous work\non collective sensing shows that gregarious individuals obtain an evolutionary\nadvantage when competing against solitary individuals. It is still unclear if\nand under which conditions groups are evolutionarily stable formations. The\nquestion this work addresses is whether collective sensing allows for the\nemergence of groups from a population of individuals without pre-determined\nbehaviors. Experiments are run in an agent-based evolutionary model of a\nforaging task, where the fitness of the agents depends on their foraging\nstrategy. Agents compete for the same limited resources and neither the\nenvironment nor inter-group dynamics advantage groups over individuals. The\nbehavior of agents is determined by a model-free neural network, which is\nrandomly initialized. The advantage of a model-free approach is that it does\nnot impose any constraints on the agent behavior, allowing evolution to explore\na higher number of strategies. Results show that a population of gregarious\nagents, which are able to exploit collective sensing, has a higher fitness than\na competing population of random walkers, under some environmental conditions.\nIn particular, previous results linking the evolution of collective behavior to\nfood scarcity are confirmed. Further results show that groups can emerge in a\npopulation of randomly-initialized agents, in response to a reduction of\nresources in the environment.\n"]}]

Previous work has defined a model with a rather strong lower bound on\nsample complexity in terms of the number of queries, $n\\sim\\sqrt q$, arguing\nthat adaptive data analysis is much harder than static data analysis, where\n$n\\sim\\log q$ is possible. Instead, we argue that those strong lower bounds\npoint to a limitation of the previous model in that it must consider wildly\nasymmetric scenarios which do not hold in typical applications.\n  To better understand other difficulties of adaptivity, we propose a new\nBayesian version of the problem that mandates symmetry.

To ease the\ncomparison between rate and spiking networks, recent works investigated the\ndynami- cal regimes of randomly-connected rate networks with segregated\nexcitatory and inhibitory populations, and firing rates constrained to be\npositive.

This modification of the collinear factorization formula goes\nbeyond the leading power and thus a natural question arises if such cutoff can\nbe extracted from a formalism which takes into account power corrections. In\nthis work, we consider the High Energy Factorization (HEF) valid at small $x$\nand a new model, based on a similar principle to HEF, which in addition has a\nlimit respecting the Dokshitzer-Dyakonov-Troyan formula for the dijet momentum\ndisbalance spectrum.

First, we study minijets directly in the low-$p_T$ region, and\ndemonstrate that higher twist corrections do generate suppression of the\ninclusive jet production cross section though these effects are not leading to\nthe increase of the cutoff with incident energy. Second, we consider hard\ninclusive dijet production where Multi Parton Interactions (MPIs) with minijets\nproduce power corrections. We introduce an observable constructed from\ndifferential cross section in the ratio $\\tau$ of dijet disbalance to the\naverage dijet $p_T$ and demonstrate that the $\\tau>1$ region is sensitive to\nthe cutoff $p_{T0}$ in the MPI minijet models.

Our approach takes advantage of the hierarchical nature of\nthe CNN and identifies the 3D positions of features that capture the\nhierarchical support relations between filters in different CNN layers by\ntracing the activation of higher level features in the CNN backward. When this\nbackward trace terminates in the RGB-D image, important manipulable structures\ncomprising the objects are, thus, localized. These features located in\ndifferent layers of the CNN are then associated to controllers belonging to\ndifferent hierarchies of the robot morphology for grasping. A Grasping Dataset\nis collected using demonstrated hand/object relationships for Robonaut-2 to\nevaluate the proposed approach in terms of the precision of the resulting\npreshape postures. We demonstrate that this approach outperforms base-line\napproaches in cluttered scenarios on the Grasping Dataset and a point cloud\nbased approach on a grasping task using Robonaut-2.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 9 figures"]}]

Spitzer/MIPS 24 micron and Herschel/PACS\n100 and 160 micron observations are used to derive rest-frame 7.7 micron\nluminosities (L(7.7)) and total IR luminosities (L(IR)), respectively.

Additionally, L(7.7)/L(IR) is significantly\nlower in the youngest quartile of our sample (ages of 500 Myr) compared to\nolder galaxies, which may be a result of the delayed production of PAHs by AGB\nstars.

The\nobserved radio luminosity rules out a powerful relativistic jet like that seen\nin the relativistic TDE Swift J1644+57. Instead we infer from an equipartition\nanalysis that the radio emission most likely arises from a non-relativistic\noutflow similar to that seen in the nearby TDE ASASSN-14li, with a velocity of\nabout $10^4$ km s$^{-1}$ and a kinetic energy of about $10^{48}$ erg, expanding\ninto a medium with a density of about $10^2$ cm$^{-3}$. Alternatively, the\nradio emission could arise from a weak initially-relativistic but decelerated\njet with an energy of $\\sim 2\\times 10^{50}$ erg, or (for an extreme disruption\ngeometry) from the unbound debris. The radio data for XMMSL1 J0740$-$85\ncontinues to support the previous suggestion of a bimodal distribution of\ncommon non-relativistic isotropic outflows and rare relativistic jets in TDEs\n(in analogy with the relation between Type Ib/c supernovae and long-duration\ngamma-ray bursts). The radio data also provide a new measurement of the\ncircumnuclear density on a sub-parsec scale around an extragalactic\nsupermassive black hole.\n","Comment: Accepted to ApJ.

Using the most stringent bound on the\nelectron EDM, provided by the ACME Collaboration, we determine that the upper\nbound on the difference between axial and vector currents lies within\n$\\sim10^{-10}$ and $\\sim10^{-7}$ for heavy-neutrino masses between $0.5\\,{\\rm\nTeV}$ and $6\\,{\\rm TeV}$ and if the $W'$ mass is within $0.45\\,{\\rm\nTeV}-7\\,{\\rm TeV}$. This possibility is analyzed altogether with the anomalous\nmagnetic moments of charged leptons, among which we estimate, for the $\\tau$\nlepton, an anomalous magnetic moment contribution between $\\sim10^{-8}$ and\n$\\sim10^{-10}$ for neutrino masses ranging from $0.5\\,{\\rm TeV}$ to $6\\,{\\rm\nTeV}$ and a $W'$ mass between $0.45\\,{\\rm TeV}$ and $7\\,{\\rm TeV}$. The general\ncharged currents are also used to calculate the branching ratio for $\\mu\\to\ne\\gamma$, which gets suppressed if the set of masses of heavy neutrinos is\nquasidegenerate. In a scenario of nondegenerate neutrino masses, we find that\nregions of neutrino and $W'$ masses in which the contributions to this flavor\nchanging branching ratio are lower than the current upper bound exist. We show\nthat such regions can be widened if the $W'$ gauge boson mass is larger.\n","Comment: 14 pages; 4 figures; accepted by Physical Review D for publication;\n  we found a problem with our calculations, so this revised version includes\n  corrections, modifications to analyses, a whole new section, and an improved\n  discussion"]}]

METHODS: Study partners of subjects (n=1355), ranging\nfrom cognitively normal to dementia subjects, completed the original A-IADL-Q.\nWe selected the short version items using a stepwise procedure combining\nmissing data, Item Response Theory and input from respondents and experts. We\ninvestigated internal consistency of the short version as well as concordance\nwith the original version. To assess its construct validity, we additionally\ninvestigated concordance between the short version and the Mini-Mental State\nExamination (MMSE) and Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD). Lastly, we\ninvestigated differences in IADL scores between diagnostic groups across the\ndementia spectrum. RESULTS: We selected 30 items covering the entire spectrum\nof IADL functioning.

For breakup,\nwe investigate various aspects, such as the role of the alpha + t continuum,\nthe angular-momentum distribution, and the balance between Coulomb and nuclear\neffects. We show that there is a large ambiguity in defining the 'Coulomb' and\n'nuclear' breakup cross sections, since both techniques, although providing the\nsame total breakup cross sections, strongly differ for the individual\ncomponents. We suggest a third method which could be efficiently used to\naddress convergence problems at large angular momentum.

In order to reduce the matching complexity with minimal or no sacrifice\nin retrieval performance: (i) we utilize the tree structure of the spatial\nhierarchical K-means to perform a top-to-bottom pruning for local similarity\nmaxima; (ii) we propose a new image similarity score that combines relevant\ninformation from all partition levels into a single measure for similarity;\n(iii) we combine our proposal with a novel and efficient approach for optimal\nbit allocation within quantized descriptor representations. By deriving both a\nVoronoi-based VLAD descriptor (termed as Fast-VVLAD) and a Voronoi-based deep\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) descriptor (termed as Fast-VDCNN), we\ndemonstrate that our Voronoi-based framework is agnostic to the descriptor\nbasis, and can easily be slotted into existing frameworks. Via a range of ROI\nqueries in two standard datasets, it is shown that the Voronoi-based\ndescriptors achieve comparable or higher mean Average Precision against\nconventional grid-based spatial search, while offering more than two-fold\nreduction in complexity. Finally, beyond ROI queries, we show that Voronoi\npartitioning improves the geometric invariance of compact CNN descriptors,\nthereby resulting in competitive performance to the current state-of-the-art on\nwhole image retrieval.\n","Comment: IEEE Transaction on Multimedia, to appear"]}]

The upper limit of the $\\gamma$ discrepancy set\nby such an extensively-observed and well-modeled source is as follows:\n$\\gamma_{radio}-\\gamma_{\\gamma-ray}<3.28\\times10^{-9}$ at the energy difference\nof $E_{\\gamma-ray}/E_{radio}\\sim10^{13}$,\n$\\gamma_{radio}-\\gamma_{X-ray}<4.01\\times10^{-9}$ at the energy difference of\n$E_{X-ray}/E_{radio}\\sim10^{9}$,\n$\\gamma_{radio}-\\gamma_{optical}<2.63\\times10^{-9}$ at\n$E_{optical}/E_{radio}\\sim10^{5}$, and\n$\\gamma_{optical}-\\gamma_{\\gamma-ray}<3.03\\times10^{-10}$ at\n$E_{\\gamma-ray}/E_{optical}\\sim10^8$.

The framework of multi-node BS provides an estimate of the critical\nnumber of nodes which when simultaneously perturbed, significantly reduces the\ncapacity of the system to return to the desired stable state. Further, this\nmethodology can be applied to estimate the minimum number of nodes of the\nnetwork to be controlled or safeguarded from external perturbations to ensure\nproper operation of the system. Multi-node BS can also be utilized for probing\nthe influence of spatially localised perturbations or targeted attacks to\nspecific parts of a network.

The accretion luminosity, Lacc,\nincreases with the stellar luminosity, Lstar, with an overall slope of ~1.6,\nsimilar but with a smaller scatter than in previous studies. There is a\nsignificant lack of strong accretors below Lstar~0.1Lsun, where Lacc is always\nlower than 0.01Lstar. We argue that the Lacc-Lstar slope is not due to\nobservational biases, but is a true property of the Lupus YSOs.

The bimodality of the Macc-Mstar relation is confirmed with four\ndifferent evolutionary models used to derive the stellar mass. The bimodal\nbehaviour of the observed relationship supports the importance of modelling\nself-gravity in the early evolution of the more massive discs, but other\nprocesses, such as photo evaporation and planet formation during the YSO's\nlifetime, may also lead to disc dispersal on different timescales depending on\nthe stellar mass.

Recently, Miller et al. (2103) have presented broad-band, high quality\nNuSTAR data of SerX-1.Using relativistically smeared self-consistent reflection\nmodels, they find a value of R_in close to 1.0 R_ISCO (corresponding to 6 R_g),\nand a low inclination angle, less than 10 deg. Aims: The aim of this paper is\nto probe to what extent the choice of reflection and continuum models (and\nuncertainties therein) can affect the conclusions about the disk parameters\ninferred from the reflection component. To this aim we re-analyze all the\navailable public NuSTAR and XMM-Newton. Ser X-1 is a well studied source, its\nspectrum has been observed by several instruments, and is therefore one of the\nbest sources for this study. Methods: We use slightly different continuum and\nreflection models with respect to those adopted in literature for this source.\nIn particular we fit the iron line and other reflection features with\nself-consistent reflection models as reflionx (with a power-law illuminating\ncontinuum modified with a high energy cutoff to mimic the shape of the incident\nComptonization spectrum) and rfxconv. With these models we fit NuSTAR and\nXMM-Newton spectra yielding consistent spectral results. Results: Our results\nare in line with those already found by Miller et al. (2013) but less extreme.\nIn particular, we find the inner disk radius at about 13 R_g and an inclination\nangle with respect to the line of sight of about 27 deg. We conclude that,\nwhile the choice of the reflection model has little impact on the disk\nparameters, as soon as a self-consistent model is used, the choice of the\ncontinuum model can be important in the precise determination of the disk\nparameters from the reflection component. Hence broad-band X-ray spectra are\nhighly preferable to constrain the continuum and disk parameters.\n","Comment: 13 pages including 8 figures. Accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

In this paper, we address the\nlatter issue through a pair of global disc simulations. Here, we only consider\ncases of initially purely toroidal magnetic fields contained entirely within a\ncompact torus. We find that, over only a few tens of orbital periods, the\nmagnetization of an initially strongly magnetized disc,\n$P_\\mathrm{mag}/P_\\mathrm{gas} \\ge 10$, drops to $\\lesssim 0.1$, similar to the\nsteady-state value reached in initially weakly magnetized discs.

If FRBs repeat for decades or centuies, a\nlocal FRB could be active now. A typical Galactic FRB would produce a\nmillisecond radio pulse with ~1 GHz flux density of ~3E10 Jy, comparable to the\nradio flux levels and frequencies of cellular communication devices (cell\nphones, Wi-Fi, GPS). We propose to search for Galactic FRBs using a global\narray of low-cost radio receivers. One possibility is to use the ~1GHz\ncommunication channel in cellular phones through a Citizens-Science\ndownloadable application. Participating phones would continuously listen for\nand record candidate FRBs and would periodically upload information to a\ncentral data processing website, which correlates the incoming data from all\nparticipants, to identify the signature of a real, globe-encompassing, FRB from\nan astronomical distance. Triangulation of the GPS-based pulse arrival times\nreported from different locations will provide the FRB sky position,\npotentially to arc-second accuracy. Pulse arrival times from phones operating\nat diverse frequencies, or from an on-device de-dispersion search, will yield\nthe dispersion measure (DM) which will indicate the FRB source distance within\nthe Galaxy. A variant of this approach would be to use the built-in ~100 MHz\nFM-radio receivers present in cell phones for an FRB search at lower\nfrequencies.

The Large Magellanic Cloud"],"description":["  The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the closest star forming galaxy with low\nmetallicity, provides an ideal laboratory to study star formation in such an\nenvironment. The classical dense molecular gas thermometer NH3 is rarely\navailable in a low metallicity environment because of photoionization and a\nlack of nitrogen atoms. Our goal is to directly measure the gas kinetic\ntemperature with formaldehyde toward six star-forming regions in the LMC. Three\nrotational transitions of para-H2CO near 218 GHz were observed with the APEX\n12m telescope toward six star forming regions in the LMC. Those data are\ncomplemented by C18O 2-1 spectra. Using non-LTE modeling with RADEX, we derive\nthe gas kinetic temperature and spatial density, using as constraints the\nmeasured para-H2CO 321-220/303-202 and para-H2CO 303-202/C18O 2-1 ratios.\nExcluding the quiescent cloud N159S, where only one para-H2CO line could be\ndetected, the gas kinetic temperatures derived from the preferred para-H2CO\n321-220/303-202 line ratios range from 35 to 63 K with an average of 47 K.\nSpatial densities of the gas derived from the paraH2CO 303-202/C18O 2-1 line\nratios yield 0.4-2.9x10^5 cm^-3 with an average of 1.5x10^5 cm^-3. Temperatures\nderived from the para-H2CO line ratio are similar to those obtained with the\nsame method from Galactic star forming regions and agree with results derived\nfrom CO in the dense regions of the LMC. A comparison of kinetic temperatures\nderived from para-H2CO with those from the dust also shows good agreement. This\nsuggests that the dust and para-H2CO are well mixed in the studied star forming\nregions. A correlation between the gas kinetic temperatures derived from\npara-H2CO and infrared luminosity, represented by the 250um flux, suggests that\nthe kinetic temperatures traced by para-H2CO are correlated with the ongoing\nmassive star formation in the LMC.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

Methods: We discuss the initial conditions of our\nmajor merger, which consist of two protogalaxies on a collision orbit. We show\nthat such merger simulations can produce a non-realistic central mass\nconcentration, and we propose simple, parametric, AGN-like feedback as a\nsolution to this problem. Our AGN-like feedback algorithm is very simple: at\neach time-step we take all particles whose local volume density is above a\ngiven threshold value and increase their temperature to a preset value.

Results: We show that the evolution of isolated\nprotogalaxies resembles the evolution of disk galaxies, thus arguing that our\nprotogalaxies are well suited for our merger simulations. We demonstrate that\nthe problem with the unphysical central mass concentration in our merger\nsimulations is further aggravated when we increase the resolution.

An in-depth analysis of these objects, however, is currently not\nfeasible due to the lack of high-quality, spatially-resolved photometric and\nspectroscopic data.

The compact sizes of our nearby galaxies\nimply high central stellar mass surface densities, which are also in agreement\nwith the massive galaxy population at higher redshift, hinting at strong\ndissipational processes during their formation. Corroborating evidence for a\nlargely passive evolution within the last 10 Gyr is provided by their orbital\ndistribution as well as their stellar populations, which are difficult to\nreconcile with a very active (major) merging history.

We\nshow that this effect arises because the RNe maps are dominated by strongly\nirradiated PDR emission, while the much larger HII region maps are dominated by\nemission from regions much more distant from the exciting stars, leading to\nsubtly different spectral behavior. Further investigation of this dichotomy\nreveals that the ratio of two of these components (centered at 7.6 and 7.8\n$\\mu$m) is linearly related to the UV field intensity (log G$_0$). We find that\nthis relationship does not hold for sources consisting of circumstellar\nmaterial, which are known to have variable 7.7 $\\mu$m spectral profiles.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 17 figures, ApJ Accepted"]}]

This H+ may then dissolve relict soil CaCO3 carbonate\n(calcite), to release Ca+2 calcium cations and more HCO3- bicarbonate. When\nconditions allow, one mole of Ca+2 and two moles of HCO3- combine to\nprecipitate one mole of calcite, and to release one mole of CO2: Ca+2 + 2HCO3-\n--> CaCO3 + CO2 + H2O. However, it has been claimed that such carbonates do not\nsequester significant amounts of present day atmospheric CO2. The reasons given\nwere that they originate in part from the pre-existing limestone; and that for\nevery mole of calcite precipitated, one mole of CO2 may be liberated to the\natmosphere. It was argued that only if the Ca+2 cation is derived from a\nnon-carbonate source can sequestration be assumed. We have tested these\nassumptions under field conditions at two semi-arid sites in Israel.

We only see an\nadditional effect for centrals in the most massive halos, but we argue that\neven this is not dominated by ICL. Hence, for the vast majority of galaxies,\nthe differences between PyMorph and SDSS pipeline photometry cannot be ascribed\nto the semantics of whether or not one includes the ICL when describing the\nstellar mass of massive galaxies. Rather, they likely reflect differences in\nstar formation or assembly histories. Failure to account for the SDSS\nunderestimate has significantly biased most previous estimates of the SDSS\nluminosity and stellar mass functions, and therefore Halo Model estimates of\nthe z ~ 0.1 relation between the mass of a halo and that of the galaxy at its\ncenter. We also show that when one studies correlations, at fixed group mass,\nwith a quantity which was not used to define the groups, then selection effects\nappear. We show why such effects arise, and should not be mistaken for physical\neffects.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 17 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS.

As a proof of concept we present a discovery\ntechnique based on fuzzy Petri nets, i.e., Petri nets with three types of arcs\nto express the level of certainty. These models allow for formal reasoning, but\nalso reveal information that cannot be captured in mainstream formal models. A\nnovel discovery algorithm returning fuzzy Petri nets has been implemented in\nProM and has been applied to several real-life event logs. The results clearly\ndemonstrate the advantages of remaining \"vague\" when there is not enough\n\"evidence\" in the data. Moreover, the approach is scalable enough to be\nincorporated in industrial-strength process mining tools.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 9 figures"]}]

For the Crab Nebula as a\nreference source we find no indication of variability in the TeV band. Our main\nfocus is the study of the TeV blazars Markarian (Mrk) 421 and Mrk 501. A\nspectral fit for Mrk 421 yields a power law index $\\Gamma=2.21\n\\pm0.14_{\\mathrm{stat}} \\pm 0.20_{\\mathrm{sys}} $ and an exponential cut-off\n$E_0=5.4 \\pm 1.1_{\\mathrm{stat}} \\pm 1.0_{\\mathrm{sys}}$ TeV. For Mrk 501, we\nfind an index $\\Gamma=1.60 \\pm 0.30_{\\mathrm{stat}} \\pm 0.20_{\\mathrm{sys}}$\nand exponential cut-off $E_0=5.7 \\pm 1.6_{\\mathrm{stat}} \\pm\n1.0_{\\mathrm{sys}}$ TeV. The light curves for both sources show clear\nvariability and a Bayesian analysis is applied to identify changes between flux\nstates. The highest per-transit fluxes observed from Mrk 421 exceed the Crab\nNebula flux by a factor of approximately five. For Mrk 501, several transits\nshow fluxes in excess of three times the Crab Nebula flux.

To capture the\ntemporal relation between the image frames, we use linear chain CRF in the\nsecond part of our network. We evaluate our proposed network on three publicly\navailable databases, viz. CK+, MMI, and FERA. Experiments are performed in\nsubject-independent and cross-database manners. Our experimental results show\nthat cascading the deep network architecture with the CRF module considerably\nincreases the recognition of facial expressions in videos and in particular it\noutperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the cross-database experiments and\nyields comparable results in the subject-independent experiments.\n"]}]

The theory of stochastic differential equation for\nSchroedinger's functional equation was given by B. Jamison. The solution is\nDoob's h-path process with given two end point marginals. We show that the\nsolution of Schroedinger's functional equation is measurable in space, kernel\nand marginals. As an application, we show that the drift vector of the h-path\nprocess with given two end point marginals is a measurable function of space,\ntime and marginal at each time. In particular, we show that the marginals\nsatisfy a class of mean field PDE systems of which the coefficients are\nmeasurable function of space, time and marginal. We also show that\nSchroedinger's functional equation is the Euler equation of a stochastic\noptimal transportation problem.\n"]}]

Most of the initial attempts largely focused on replacing the input to\nsuch a deep convolutional neural network from a natural image to a medical\nimage. This, however, does not take into consideration the fundamental\ndifferences between these two types of data. More specifically, detection or\nrecognition of an anomaly in medical images depends significantly on fine\ndetails, unlike object recognition in natural images where coarser, more global\nstructures matter more. This difference makes it inadequate to use the existing\ndeep convolutional neural networks architectures, which were developed for\nnatural images, because they rely on heavily downsampling an image to a much\nlower resolution to reduce the memory requirements. This hides details\nnecessary to make accurate predictions for medical images. Furthermore, a\nsingle exam in medical imaging often comes with a set of different views which\nmust be seamlessly fused in order to reach a correct conclusion. In our work,\nwe propose to use a multi-view deep convolutional neural network that handles a\nset of more than one high-resolution medical image. We evaluate this network on\nlarge-scale mammography-based breast cancer screening (BI-RADS prediction)\nusing 103 thousand images. We focus on investigating the impact of training set\nsizes and image sizes on the prediction accuracy. Our results highlight that\nperformance clearly increases with the size of training set, and that the best\nperformance can only be achieved using the images in the original resolution.\nThis suggests the future direction of medical imaging research using deep\nneural networks is to utilize as much data as possible with the least amount of\npotentially harmful preprocessing.\n"]}]

Brightness variation has been proposed as a population-scale rather\nthan individual-target observable in two studies so far. We aim to examine this\napproach rigorously to establish its theoretical validity, degree of\nill-posedness, and practical applicability.\n  Methods. We model the observed brightness variation of a target population by\nconsidering its cumulative distribution function (CDF) caused by the joint\ndistribution function of two fundamental shape and spin indicators. These are\nthe shape elongation and the spin latitude of a simple ellipsoidal model. The\nmain advantage of the model is that we can derive analytical basis functions\nthat yield the observed CDF as a function of the shape and spin distribution.\nThe inverse problem can be treated linearly.

Reconstructing the energy of these recoils is\ncomplicated by scintillation quenching. Understanding how nuclear recoils are\nquenched in these scintillators is an important and difficult problem. In this\narticle, we present a set of measurements of neutron-induced proton recoils in\na boron-loaded organic liquid scintillator at recoil energies ranging from\n57--467 keV, and we compare these measurements to predictions from different\nquenching models.

Given these\nindividual taxon-specific observations, we learn a phytoplankton community\nmodel that characterizes the co-occurrence relations between taxa. We present\nexperiments with simulated robot missions drawn from real observation data\ncollected during a research cruise traversing the US Atlantic coast. Our\nresults show that the proposed approach outperforms nearest neighbor and\nk-means based methods for predicting the spatial distribution of hotspots from\nin-situ observations.\n","Comment: To appear in ICRA 2017, Singapore"]}]

A\nsecond catalogue gives a list of galaxies with CCD magnitudes in the V (239\ngalaxies) and R (610 galaxies) bands for a much smaller region in the centre of\nthe cluster. These two catalogues will be combined with a redshift catalogue of\n466 galaxies (Durret et al. 1999) to investigate the cluster properties at\noptical wavelengths (Durret et al. in preparation), as a complement to previous\nX-ray studies by a member of our group (Pislar 1998).\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics, Supplement\n  Series"]}]
