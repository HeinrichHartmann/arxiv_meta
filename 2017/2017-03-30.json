Because this ontology is\nunitary, the theory avoids the dilemmas of wave-particle dualism and\ncomplementarity.\n  Furthermore, the theory's dynamic equations generate correct, quasi-discrete\nvalues of action increments and energy levels without recourse to the operator\nformalism and eigenvalue postulate of standard quantum mechanics. Quantization\nof the harmonic oscillator provides a simple illustration.\n  The theory provides insight into the nature of a number of quantum effects\nsuch as the zero-point energy of the harmonic oscillator.

We extend the existing theory to include the more\nrealistic possibility that the price at which the investors trade is dependent\non the traded volume. The investors in the market always buy at the ask and\nsell at the bid price. Implicit transaction costs are composed of two terms,\none is able to capture the bid-ask spread, and the second the price impact.\nMoreover, a new definition of a self-financing portfolio is obtained. The\nself-financing condition suggests that continuous trading is possible, but is\nrestricted to predictable trading strategies having c\\'adl\\'ag\n(right-continuous with left limits) and c\\'agl\\'ad (left-continuous with right\nlimits) paths of bounded quadratic variation and of finitely many jumps.

The focused wave\namplitude is exactly the sum of the focusing soliton heights; the maximum wave\ninherits the polarity of the fastest soliton in the train. The focusing of\nseveral solitary waves or/and breathers may naturally occur in a soliton gas\nand will lead to rogue-wave-type dynamics; hence it represents a new nonlinear\nmechanism of rogue wave generation.

At LHC and top RHIC\nenergies, QCD matter is studied at very high temperatures and nearly vanishing\nnet-baryon densities. There is evidence that a Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP) was\ncreated at experiments at RHIC and LHC. The transition from the QGP back to the\nhadron gas is found to be a smooth cross over. For larger net-baryon densities\nand lower temperatures, it is expected that the QCD phase diagram exhibits a\nrich structure, such as a first-order phase transition between hadronic and\npartonic matter which terminates in a critical point, or exotic phases like\nquarkyonic matter. The discovery of these landmarks would be a breakthrough in\nour understanding of the strong interaction and is therefore in the focus of\nvarious high-energy heavy-ion research programs. The Compressed Baryonic Matter\n(CBM) experiment at FAIR will play a unique role in the exploration of the QCD\nphase diagram in the region of high net-baryon densities, because it is\ndesigned to run at unprecedented interaction rates. High-rate operation is the\nkey prerequisite for high-precision measurements of multi-differential\nobservables and of rare diagnostic probes which are sensitive to the dense\nphase of the nuclear fireball. The goal of the CBM experiment at SIS100\n(sqrt(s_NN) = 2.7 - 4.9 GeV) is to discover fundamental properties of QCD\nmatter: the phase structure at large baryon-chemical potentials (mu_B > 500\nMeV), effects of chiral symmetry, and the equation-of-state at high density as\nit is expected to occur in the core of neutron stars.

However, commercial MIP\nsolvers are designed to run on desktop computing platforms and are not suited\nfor embedded applications which are typically restricted by limited\ncomputational power and memory. To alleviate these restrictions, we develop a\nnovel low-complexity, iterative method for a class of non-convex, non-smooth\noptimization problems. This class of problems encompasses hybrid model\npredictive control problems where the dynamics are piece-wise affine (PWA).

For the inspiral-plunge phase, we use a Markov-chain Monte Carlo\nalgorithm to efficiently explore the calibration space. For the merger-ringdown\nphase, we fit the NR signals with phenomenological formulae.

Using the M\\\"obius inversion\nduality between multivariable entropies and multivariable interaction\ninformation, we express the divergence as an additive series in the number of\ninteracting variables, which provides a restricted and simplified set of\ndistributions to use as approximation and with which to model data. Truncations\nof this series yield approximations based on the number of interacting\nvariables. The first few terms of the expansion-truncation are illustrated and\nshown to lead naturally to familiar approximations, including the well-known\nKirkwood superposition approximation. Truncation can also induce a simple\nrelation between the multi-information and the interaction information. A\nmeasure of distance between distributions, based on Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence, is then described and shown to be a true metric if properly\nrestricted.

It has been shown that in-memory data\nprocessing systems suffer from serious memory pressure.

For example, in a service-oriented system, multiple submitted tasks\nare launched at the same time and executed in the same context in the\nresources, comparing with the batch processing mode where the tasks are\nprocessed one by one. Therefore, the memory pressure will affect all submitted\ntasks, including the tasks that only incur the light memory pressure when they\nare run alone.

The fragmentation fraction ratio is an important ingredient in\nexperimental determinations of $B_s$ meson branching fractions at hadron\ncolliders, in particular for the rare decay ${\\cal B}(B_s \\rightarrow \\mu^+\n\\mu^-)$. In addition to the form factor results, we make the first prediction\nof the branching fraction ratio $R(D_s) = {\\cal B}(B_s\\to D_s\\tau\\nu)/{\\cal\nB}(B_s\\to D_s\\ell\\nu) = 0.301(6)$, where $\\ell$ is an electron or muon. Current\nexperimental measurements of the corresponding ratio for the semileptonic\ndecays of $B$ mesons disagree with Standard Model expectations at the level of\nnearly four standard deviations. Future experimental measurements of $R(D_s)$\nmay help understand this discrepancy.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 15 figures"]}]

Traditional misuse detection strategies are unable to detect\nnew and unknown intrusion. Besides, anomaly detection in network security is\naim to distinguish between illegal or malicious events and normal behavior of\nnetwork systems. Anomaly detection can be considered as a classification\nproblem where it builds models of normal network behavior, which it uses to\ndetect new patterns that significantly deviate from the model. Most of the cur-\nrent research on anomaly detection is based on the learning of normally and\nanomaly behaviors. They do not take into account the previous, re- cent events\nto detect the new incoming one. In this paper, we propose a real time\ncollective anomaly detection model based on neural network learning and feature\noperating. Normally a Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM\nRNN) is trained only on normal data and it is capable of predicting several\ntime steps ahead of an input. In our approach, a LSTM RNN is trained with\nnormal time series data before performing a live prediction for each time step.\nInstead of considering each time step separately, the observation of prediction\nerrors from a certain number of time steps is now proposed as a new idea for\ndetecting collective anomalies. The prediction errors from a number of the\nlatest time steps above a threshold will indicate a collective anomaly. The\nmodel is built on a time series version of the KDD 1999 dataset.

They are able to provide flexible, affordable and\nportable health guides to device users. Current online decision-making methods\nfor mHealth assume that the users are completely heterogeneous. They share no\ninformation among users and learn a separate policy for each user. However,\ndata for each user is very limited in size to support the separate online\nlearning, leading to unstable policies that contain lots of variances. Besides,\nwe find the truth that a user may be similar with some, but not all, users, and\nconnected users tend to have similar behaviors. In this paper, we propose a\nnetwork cohesion constrained (actor-critic) Reinforcement Learning (RL) method\nfor mHealth. The goal is to explore how to share information among similar\nusers to better convert the limited user information into sharper learned\npolicies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first online actor-critic\nRL for mHealth and first network cohesion constrained (actor-critic) RL method\nin all applications. The network cohesion is important to derive effective\npolicies. We come up with a novel method to learn the network by using the warm\nstart trajectory, which directly reflects the users' property. The optimization\nof our model is difficult and very different from the general supervised\nlearning due to the indirect observation of values. As a contribution, we\npropose two algorithms for the proposed online RLs. Apart from mHealth, the\nproposed methods can be easily applied or adapted to other health-related\ntasks. Extensive experiment results on the HeartSteps dataset demonstrates that\nin a variety of parameter settings, the proposed two methods obtain obvious\nimprovements over the state-of-the-art methods.\n"]}]

This screening method is found to predict dissociative\nadsorption energies that span a range of more than 2 eV, with a mean absolute\nerror $<0.1$ eV. In addition, we show that the quality of such predictions can\nbe readily assessed by examination of the Kohn-Sham highest occupied molecular\norbital in the initial states. In this way, the root mean square error in the\ndissociative adsorption energies of water is reduced by almost an order of\nmagnitude (down to $\\sim0.02$ eV) after filtering out poor predictions. The\nfindings point the way towards a reliable use of first order alchemical\nderivatives for efficient screening procedures.\n"]}]

If a sensor detects an abnormality, it injects into the medium a\nnumber of molecules which is proportional to the sensed value. Two transmission\nschemes for releasing molecules into the medium are considered. In the first\nscheme, referred to as DTM, each sensor releases a different type of molecule,\nwhereas in the second scheme, referred to as STM, all sensors release the same\ntype of molecule. The molecules released by the sensors propagate through the\nMC channel and some may reach the FC where the final decision regarding whether\nor not an abnormality has occurred is made. We derive the optimal decision\nrules for both DTM and STM. However, the optimal detectors entail high\ncomputational complexity as log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) have to be computed.\nTo overcome this issue, we show that the optimal decision rule for STM can be\ntransformed into an equivalent low-complexity decision rule. Since a similar\ntransformation is not possible for DTM, we propose simple low-complexity\nsub-optimal detectors based on different approximations of the LLR. The\nproposed low-complexity detectors are more suitable for practical MC systems\nthan the original complex optimal decision rule, particularly when the FC is a\nnano-machine with limited computational capabilities. Furthermore, we analyze\nthe performance of the proposed detectors in terms of their false alarm and\nmissed detection probabilities.

The purpose of this investigation is to characterize the temporal\nevolution of an emerging flux region, the associated photospheric and\nchromospheric flow fields, and the properties of the accompanying arch filament\nsystem. Methods. This study is based on imaging spectroscopy with the\nG\\\"ottingen Fabry-P\\'erot Interferometer at the Vacuum Tower Telescope, on 2008\nAugust 7. Cloud model (CM) inversions of line scans in the strong chromospheric\nabsorption H$\\alpha$ line yielded CM parameters, which describe the cool plasma\ncontained in the arch filament system. Results. The observations cover the\ndecay and convergence of two micro-pores with diameters of less than one\narcsecond and provide decay rates for intensity and area. The photospheric\nhorizontal flow speed is suppressed near the two micro-pores indicating that\nthe magnetic field is sufficiently strong to affect the convective energy\ntransport. The micro-pores are accompanied by an arch filament system, where\nsmall-scale loops connect two regions with H$\\alpha$ line-core brightenings\ncontaining an emerging flux region with opposite polarities. The chromospheric\nvelocity of the cloud material is predominantly directed downwards near the\nfootpoints of the loops with velocities of up to 12 km/s, whereas loop tops\nshow upward motions of about 3 km/s. Conclusions. Micro-pores are the smallest\nmagnetic field concentrations leaving a photometric signature in the\nphotosphere. In the observed case, they are accompanied by a miniature arch\nfilament system indicative of newly emerging flux in the form of\n$\\Omega$-loops. Flux emergence and decay take place on a time-scale of about\ntwo days, whereas the photometric decay of the micro-pores is much more rapid\n(a few hours), which is consistent with the incipient submergence of\n$\\Omega$-loops.
