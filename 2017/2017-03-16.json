The novel\nconvergence results presented in this paper answer several open questions that\nhave been the subject of considerable discussion. We firstly extend the 2-block\nproximal ADMM to linearly constrained convex optimization with a coupled\nquadratic objective function, an area where theoretical understanding is\ncurrently lacking, and prove that the sequence generated by the proximal ADMM\nconverges in point-wise manner to a primal-dual solution pair.

When the linear constraint vanishes, the\n2-block proximal ADMM and RPADMM reduce to the 2-block cyclic proximal BCD\nmethod and randomly permuted BCD (RPBCD). Our study provides the first iterate\nconvergence result for 2-block cyclic proximal BCD without assuming the\nboundedness of the iterates. We also theoretically establish the expected\niterate convergence result concerning multi-block RPBCD for convex quadratic\noptimization. In addition, we demonstrate that RPBCD may have a worse\nconvergence rate than cyclic proximal BCD for 2-block convex quadratic\nminimization problems. Although the results on RPADMM and RPBCD are restricted\nto quadratic minimization models, they provide some interesting insights: 1)\nrandom permutation makes ADMM and BCD more robust for multi-block convex\nminimization problems; 2) cyclic BCD may outperform RPBCD for \"nice\" problems,\nand therefore RPBCD should be applied with caution when solving general convex\noptimization problems.\n"]}]

Meshing functionals are discretized\ngeometrically and the MMPDE is formulated as a modified gradient system of the\ncorresponding discrete functionals for the location of mesh vertices. It is\nshown that if the meshing functional satisfies a coercivity condition, then the\nmesh of the semi-discrete MMPDE is nonsingular for all time if it is\nnonsingular initially. Moreover, the altitudes and volumes of its elements are\nbounded below by positive numbers depending only on the number of elements, the\nmetric tensor, and the initial mesh. Furthermore, the value of the discrete\nmeshing functional is convergent as time increases, which can be used as a\nstopping criterion in computation. Finally, the mesh trajectory has limiting\nmeshes which are critical points of the discrete functional. The convergence of\nthe mesh trajectory can be guaranteed when a stronger condition is placed on\nthe meshing functional. Two meshing functionals based on alignment and\nequidistribution are known to satisfy the coercivity condition.

Here, we report\nthe first experimental realization of a thermal Josephson junction whose phase\nbias can be controlled from $0$ to $\\pi$. This is obtained thanks to a\nsuperconducting quantum interferometer that allows to fully control the\ndirection of the coherent energy transfer through the junction [10]. This\npossibility, joined to the completely superconducting nature of our system,\nprovides temperature modulations with unprecedented amplitude of $\\sim$ 100 mK\nand transfer coefficients exceeding 1 K per flux quantum at 25 mK. Then, this\nquantum structure represents a fundamental step towards the realization of\ncaloritronic logic components, such as thermal transistors, switches and memory\ndevices [10,11]. These elements, combined with heat interferometers [3,4,12]\nand diodes [13,14], would complete the thermal conversion of the most important\nphase-coherent electronic devices and benefit cryogenic microcircuits requiring\nenergy management, such as quantum computing architectures and radiation\nsensors.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 9 color figures"]}]

Three notions of consistency\narise for CSTNs and CSTPs: weak, strong, and dynamic. Dynamic-Consistency (DC)\nis the most interesting notion, but it is also the most challenging. In order\nto address the DC-Checking problem, in [Comin and Rizzi, TIME 2015] we\nintroduced epsilon-DC (a refined, more realistic, notion of DC), and provided\nan algorithmic solution to it. The epsilon-DC notion is interesting per se, and\nthe epsilon-DC-Checking algorithm in [Comin and Rizzi, TIME 2015] rests on the\nassumption that the reaction-time satisfies epsilon > 0; leaving unsolved the\nquestion of what happens when epsilon = 0. In this work, we introduce and study\npi-DC, a sound notion of DC with an instantaneous reaction-time (i.e. one in\nwhich the planner can react to any observation at the same instant of time in\nwhich the observation is made). Firstly, we demonstrate by a counter-example\nthat pi-DC is not equivalent to 0-DC, and that 0-DC is actually inadequate for\nmodeling DC with an instantaneous reaction-time. This shows that the main\nresults obtained in our previous work do not apply directly, as they were\nformulated, to the case of epsilon=0. Motivated by this observation, as a\nsecond contribution, our previous tools are extended in order to handle pi-DC,\nand the notion of ps-tree is introduced, also pointing out a relationship\nbetween pi-DC and HyTN-Consistency. Thirdly, a simple reduction from\npi-DC-Checking to DC-Checking is identified. This allows us to design and to\nanalyze the first sound-and-complete pi-DC-Checking procedure.

The method relies on a\nnew formulation for Ewald summation of the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) tensor,\nwhich guarantees that the real-space and wave-space contributions to the tensor\nare independently symmetric and positive-definite for all possible particle\nconfigurations. Brownian displacements are drawn from a superposition of two\nindependent samples: a wave-space (far-field or long-ranged) contribution,\ncomputed using techniques from fluctuating hydrodynamics and non-uniform Fast\nFourier Transforms; and a real-space (near-field or short-ranged) correction,\ncomputed using a Krylov subspace method. The combined computational complexity\nof drawing these two independent samples scales linearly with the number of\nparticles. The proposed method circumvents the super-linear scaling exhibited\nby all known iterative sampling methods applied directly to the RPY tensor that\nresults from the power law growth of the condition number of tensor with the\nnumber of particles.

By\ncomparing our photometric data with stellar isochrones, we set a limit on\n[N/Fe] enhancement of $\\lesssim$+0.5 dex and hence we find that no MPs are\ndetected in this cluster. This is surprising because, in the first two papers\nof this series, we found evidence for MPs in 4 other SMC clusters (NGC 121;\nLindsay 1, NGC 339, NGC 416), aged from 6 Gyr up to $\\sim 10-11$ Gyr. This\nfinding raises the question whether age could play a major role in the MPs\nphenomenon.

In the present work our focus\nis on the empirical relation between age and metallicity for GCs and its effect\non the $M/L$ ratio. Assuming that there is an anti-correlation between the age\nof M31 GCs and their metallicity, we evolve dynamical SSP models of GCs to\nestablish a relation between the $M/L$ ratio (in the $V$ and $K$ band) and\nmetallicity. We then demonstrate that the established $M/L-\\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$\nrelation is in perfect agreement with that of M31 GCs. In our models we\nconsider both the canonical initial mass function (IMF) and the top-heavy IMF\ndepending on cluster birth density and metallicity as derived independently\nfrom Galactic GCs and ultra-compact dwarf galaxies by Marks et al. Our results\nsignify that the combination of the density- and metallicity-dependent\ntop-heavy IMF, the anti-correlation between age and metallicity, stellar\nevolution and standard dynamical evolution yields the best possible agreement\nwith the observed trend of $M/L-\\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$ for M31 GCs.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures, 1 table.

Clustering is evaluated in two dimensions, by binning absorbers\nboth in projected radius and in velocity separation. Excess MgII is detected\naround massive galaxies out to R_p=20 Mpc. At projected radii less than 800\nkpc, the excess extends out to velocity separations of 10,000 km/s.

The aim of this work is to\nobtain a simple model to study the collisionless dynamical evolution of generic\nwide binaries systems in the solar neighbourhood. Methods.

Using the one-degree of\nfreedom model, we developed a detailed dynamical study, finding that the\nsecular Galactic tide period changes as a function of the separation of the\npair, which also gives a dynamical explanation for the arbitrary classification\nbetween \"wide\" and \"tight\" binaries. Moreover, the secular phase space for a\ngeneric gravitationally bound pair is similar to the dynamical structure of a\nLidov-Kozai resonance, but surprisingly this structure is independent of the\nmasses and semimajor axis of the binary system.

In contrast to related literature, which models the memory as a\nsequence of historical states, we model the memory as a recursive tree\nstructure. This structure more effectively captures temporal dependencies\nacross both short term and long term sequences using its hierarchical\nstructure. We demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed TMN\nin two practical problems, aircraft trajectory modelling and pedestrian\ntrajectory modelling in a surveillance setting, and in both cases we outperform\nthe current state-of-the-art.

In this\npaper, we investigate this question on adipose tissue. Adipose tissue can\nrepresent 20 to 50% of the body weight. Its investigation is key to overcome a\nlarge array of metabolic disorders that heavily strike populations worldwide.\nAdipose tissue consists of lobular clusters of adipocytes surrounded by an\norganized collagen fiber network. By supplying substrates needed for\nadipogenesis, vasculature was believed to induce the regroupment of adipocytes\nnear capillary extremities. This paper shows that the emergence of these\nstructures could be explained by simple mechanical interactions between the\nadipocytes and the collagen fibers. Our assumption is that the fiber network\nresists the pressure induced by the growing adipocytes and forces them to\nregroup into clusters. Reciprocally, cell clusters force the fibers to merge\ninto a well-organized network. We validate this hypothesis by means of a\ntwo-dimensional Individual Based Model (IBM) of interacting adipocytes and\nextra-cellular-matrix fiber elements. The model produces structures that\ncompare quantitatively well to the experimental observations.

One of the goals of MoD systems is to provide personalized\ntransportation services to passengers. This process is facilitated by a\ncentralized operator that coordinates the assignment of vehicles to individual\npassengers, based on location data. However, current approaches assume that\naccurate positioning information for passengers and vehicles is readily\navailable. This assumption raises privacy concerns. In this work, we address\nthis issue by proposing a method that protects passengers' drop-off locations\n(i.e., their travel destinations). Formally, we solve a batch assignment\nproblem that routes vehicles at obfuscated origin locations to passenger\nlocations (since origin locations correspond to previous drop-off locations),\nsuch that the mean waiting time is minimized. Our main contributions are\ntwo-fold. First, we formalize the notion of privacy for continuous\nvehicle-to-passenger assignment in MoD systems, and integrate a privacy\nmechanism that provides formal guarantees. Second, we present a scalable\nalgorithm that takes advantage of superfluous (idle) vehicles in the system,\ncombining multiple iterations of the Hungarian algorithm to allocate a\nredundant number of vehicles to a single passenger. As a result, we are able to\nreduce the performance deterioration induced by the privacy mechanism. We\nevaluate our methods on a real, large-scale data set consisting of over 11\nmillion taxi rides (specifying vehicle availability and passenger requests),\nrecorded over a month's duration, in the area of Manhattan, New York.

Denumerable\nMarkov chains however do not encompass stochastic real-time systems, and\ngeneral stochastic transition systems (STSs) are needed.

Then we define a notion of abstraction, together\nwith natural concepts of soundness and completeness, and we give general\ntransfer properties, which will be central to several verification algorithms\non STSs. Then we focus on qualitative analysis. Beyond (repeated) reachability\nproperties for which our technics are strongly inspired by [1], we use\nabstractions to design algorithms for the qualitative model-checking of\narbitrary omega-regular properties, when the STS admits a denumerable (sound\nand complete) abstraction with a finite attractor. We further design generic\napproximation procedures for quantitative analysis; in addition to extensions\nof [1] for general STSs, we design approximation algorithms for omega-regular\nproperties (once again by means of specific abstractions).

We estimate spin parameters, and suggest that these sources may exist\nin high spin parameter halos, and as such may be potential HI-rich progenitors\nto the ultra-diffuse galaxies observed in cluster environments.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 8 figures, resubmitted to ApJ after revisions based on\n  reviewer comments"]}]

MXB 1659-298 on\noutburst in August 2015 after 14 years of quiescence. We span a baseline of 40\nyears using the eight eclipse arrival times present in literature and adding 51\neclipse arrival times collected during the last two outbursts. We find that the\ncompanion star mass is $0.76 $ M$_{\\odot}$, the inclination angle of the system\nis $72^{\\circ}\\!.4$ and the corona surrounding the neutron star has a size of\n$R_c \\simeq 3.5 \\times 10^8$ cm. A simple quadratic ephemeris do not fit the\ndelays associated with the eclipse arrival times, the addition of a sinusoidal\nterm is needed. We infer a binary orbital period of $P=7.1161099(3)$ hr and an\norbital period derivative of $\\dot{P}=-8.5(1.2) \\times 10^{-12}$ s s$^{-1}$;\nthe sinusoidal modulation has a period of $2.31 \\pm 0.02$ yr. These results are\nconsistent with a conservative mass transfer scenario during the outbursts and\nwith a totally non-conservative mass transfer scenario during X-ray quiescence\nwith the same mass transfer rate. The periodic modulation can be explained by\neither a gravitational quadrupole coupling due to variations of the oblateness\nof the companion star or with a presence of celestial body by orbiting around\nthe binary system; in the latter case the mass of a third body is M$_3 = 21 \\pm\n2$ M$_J$.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures.

In practice, with\nimperfect data and incomplete redshift coverage, this requires making\nassumptions about the evolution of w with redshift z. These assumptions can be\nmanifested in a choice of a specific parametric form, which can potentially\nbias the outcome, or else one can reconstruct w(z) non-parametrically, by\nspecifying a prior covariance matrix that correlates values of w at different\nredshifts. In this work, we derive the theoretical prior covariance for the\neffective DE equation of state predicted by general scalar-tensor theories with\nsecond order equations of motion (Horndeski theories). This is achieved by\ngenerating a large ensemble of possible scalar-tensor theories using a Monte\nCarlo methodology, including the application of physical viability conditions.\nWe also separately consider the special sub-case of the minimally coupled\nscalar field, or quintessence. The prior shows a preference for tracking\nbehaviors in the most general case.
