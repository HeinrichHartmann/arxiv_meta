Evaluating formulae in such extended\ngraph logics boils down to checking nonemptiness of the intersection of\nrational relations with regular or recognizable relations (or, more generally,\nto the generalized intersection problem, asking whether some projections of a\nregular relation have a nonempty intersection with a given rational relation).\n  We prove that for several basic and commonly used rational relations, the\nintersection problem with regular relations is either undecidable (e.g., for\nsubword or suffix, and some generalizations), or decidable with\nnon-primitive-recursive complexity (e.g., for subsequence and its\ngeneralizations).

Even\nsimple consistency requirements often turn out to be unrealizable because of\nthe complicated information flow in the distributed system: not all information\nis available in every component, and information transmitted from other\ncomponents may arrive with a delay or not at all, especially in the presence of\nfaults. The problem of checking the distributed realizability of a temporal\nspecification is, in general, undecidable. Semi-algorithms for synthesis, such\nas bounded synthesis, are only useful in the positive case, where they\nconstruct an implementation for a realizable specification, but not in the\nnegative case: if the specification is unrealizable, the search for the\nimplementation never terminates. In this paper, we introduce counterexamples to\ndistributed realizability and present a method for the detection of such\ncounterexamples for specifications given in linear-time temporal logic (LTL). A\ncounterexample consists of a set of paths, each representing a different\nsequence of inputs from the environment, such that, no matter how the\ncomponents are implemented, the specification is violated on at least one of\nthese paths. We present a method for finding such counterexamples both for the\nclassic distributed realizability problem and for the fault-tolerant\nrealizability problem. Our method considers, incrementally, larger and larger\nsets of paths until a counterexample is found. For safety specifications in\nweakly ordered architectures we obtain a decision procedure, while\ncounterexamples for full LTL and arbitrary architectures may consist of\ninfinitely many paths.

Is\nlambda-calculus a reasonable machine? Is there a way to measure the\ncomputational complexity of a lambda-term? This paper presents the first\ncomplete positive answer to this long-standing problem. Moreover, our answer is\ncompletely machine-independent and based over a standard notion in the theory\nof lambda-calculus: the length of a leftmost-outermost derivation to normal\nform is an invariant cost model. Such a theorem cannot be proved by directly\nrelating lambda-calculus with Turing machines or random access machines,\nbecause of the size explosion problem: there are terms that in a linear number\nof steps produce an exponentially long output. The first step towards the\nsolution is to shift to a notion of evaluation for which the length and the\nsize of the output are linearly related. This is done by adopting the linear\nsubstitution calculus (LSC), a calculus of explicit substitutions modeled after\nlinear logic proof nets and admitting a decomposition of leftmost-outermost\nderivations with the desired property. Thus, the LSC is invariant with respect\nto, say, random access machines. The second step is to show that LSC is\ninvariant with respect to the lambda-calculus. The size explosion problem seems\nto imply that this is not possible: having the same notions of normal form,\nevaluation in the LSC is exponentially longer than in the lambda-calculus. We\nsolve such an impasse by introducing a new form of shared normal form and\nshared reduction, deemed useful. Useful evaluation avoids those steps that only\nunshare the output without contributing to beta-redexes, i.e. the steps that\ncause the blow-up in size. The main technical contribution of the paper is\nindeed the definition of useful reductions and the thorough analysis of their\nproperties.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1405.3311"]}]

These results demonstrate a\nreconfigurable, unitary method to controlling the spectral-temporal mode\nstructure of quantum light.\n","Comment: Final version. 5 pages, 3 figures"]}]

The simulation procedure\nis based exclusively on empirical prescriptions -- rather than first principles\n-- to provide the most accurate match with observations at 0<z<7. In\nparticular, we consider that galaxies can be either quiescent or star-forming,\nand use their stellar mass (M*) and redshift (z) as the fundamental properties\nfrom which all the other observables can be statistically derived. Drawing z\nand M* from the observed galaxy stellar mass functions, we associate a star\nformation rate (SFR) to each galaxy from the tight SFR-M* main sequence, while\ndust attenuation, optical colors and morphologies (including bulge-to-total\nratios, sizes and aspect ratios) are obtained from empirical relations that we\nestablish from the high quality Hubble and Herschel observations available in\nthe CANDELS fields. Random scatter is introduced in each step to reproduce the\nobserved distributions of each parameter. Based on these observables, a\npanchromatic spectral energy distribution (SED) is selected for each galaxy and\nsynthetic photometry is produced by integrating the redshifted SED in common\nbroad-band filters. Finally, the mock galaxies are placed on the sky at random\npositions with a fixed angular two-point correlation function to implement\nbasic clustering. The resulting flux catalogs reproduce accurately the observed\nnumber counts in all broad bands from the ultraviolet up to the sub-millimeter,\nand can be directly fed to image simulators such as Skymaker.

This new model\nfollows the angular momentum evolution of gas and stars, providing the base for\na new star formation recipe, and treatment of the effects of mergers that\ndepends on the central galaxy dynamical structure. We find that the new recipes\nhave the effect of boosting the efficiency of the baryonic cycle in producing\nand recycling metals, as well as preventing minor mergers from diluting the\nmetallicity of bulges and ellipticals. The model reproduces the stellar mass -\nstellar metallicity relation for galaxies above 1e10 solar masses, including\nBrightest Cluster Galaxies.

Strong light matter coupling between the molecular\nexcitons and electromagnetic field generated by the plasmonic structures leads\nto the formation of hybrid quasi-particles known as plasmon exciton polaritons\n(PEPs).

Specifically, we examine how the brain moves from a specified\ninitial state (characterized by high activity in the default mode) to a\nspecified target state (characterized by high activity in primary sensorimotor\ncortex) in finite time.

Cluster\nparticles grow in mass over several million years at the rate determined by\nlocal gas properties, with high time resolution. The particle growth is\nterminated by its own energy and momentum feedback on the interstellar medium.\nWe test this implementation for Milky Way-sized galaxies at high redshift, by\ncomparing the properties of model clusters with observations of young star\nclusters. We find that the cluster initial mass function is best described by a\nSchechter function rather than a single power law. In agreement with\nobservations, at low masses the logarithmic slope is $\\alpha\\approx 1.8-2$,\nwhile the cutoff at high mass scales with the star formation rate. A related\ntrend is a positive correlation between the surface density of star formation\nrate and fraction of stars contained in massive clusters. Both trends indicate\nthat the formation of massive star clusters is preferred during bursts of star\nformation. These bursts are often associated with major merger events. We also\nfind that the median timescale for cluster formation ranges from 0.5 to 4 Myr\nand decreases systematically with increasing star formation efficiency. Local\nvariations in the gas density and cluster accretion rate naturally lead to the\nscatter of the overall formation efficiency by an order of magnitude, even when\nthe instantaneous efficiency is kept constant.

These approaches\nhave been extended to a number of models for survival outcomes including\naccelerated failure time (AFT) models which are widely used in a broad range of\nhealth applications given their intuitive interpretation. In this setting, it\nhas been suggested that under standard assumptions, the \"difference\" and\n\"product\" methods produce equivalent estimates of the indirect effect of\nexposure on the survival outcome. We formally show that these two methods may\nproduce substantially different estimates in the presence of censoring or\ntruncation, due to a form of model misspecification. Specifically, we establish\nthat while the product method remains valid under standard assumptions in the\npresence of independent censoring, the difference method can be biased in the\npresence of such censoring whenever the error distribution of the AFT model\nfails to be collapsible upon marginalizing over the mediator. This will\ninvariably be the case for most choices of mediator and outcome error\ndistributions. A notable exception arises in case of normal mediator-normal\noutcome where we show consistency of both difference and product estimators in\nthe presence of independent censoring.

In particular, we find a\ncorrelation between the Brackett gamma equivalent width and the system\nbrightness. The bluing of the continuum of the NW component along with the\nabsolute flux and color-variation of the system during the outburst suggests\nthat the outburst was caused by a complex interplay between a variation of the\nextinction in the line of sight of the NW component on one hand, and the\nemission of shocked regions close to the NW component on the other. We confirm\nthe recently reported wiggling of the SE component jet from [Fe II] line\nemission. We find a point-like structure associated with a peak emission at\n2.098 microns coincidental with the clump or arm seen in broadband polarization\ndifferential imaging as well as additional diffuse emission along a PA=214\ndegrees.

In the coupled corona, transition\nregion and chromosphere system, an enhanced downward conductive flux results in\nan upflow (chromospheric evaporation). However, obtaining the correct upflow\ngenerally requires high spatial resolution in order to resolve the transition\nregion. With an unresolved transition region, artificially low coronal\ndensities are obtained because the downward heat flux jumps across the\nunresolved region to the chromosphere, underestimating the upflows. Here, we\ntreat the lower transition region as a discontinuity that responds to changing\ncoronal conditions through the imposition of a jump condition that is derived\nfrom an integrated form of energy conservation. To illustrate and benchmark\nthis approach against a fully resolved one-dimensional model, we present\nfield-aligned simulations of coronal loops in response to a range of impulsive\n(spatially uniform) heating events. We show that our approach leads to a\nsignificant improvement in the coronal density evolution than just when using\ncoarse spatial resolutions insufficient to resolve the lower transition region.\nOur approach compensates for the jumping of the heat flux by imposing a\nvelocity correction that ensures that the energy from the heat flux goes into\ndriving the transition region dynamics, rather than being lost through\nradiation. Hence, it is possible to obtain improved coronal densities. The\nadvantages of using this approach in both one-dimensional hydrodynamic and\nthree-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations are discussed.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables, accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

More specifically, we employ the framework of the\nresidual neural networks to model the temporal closeness, period, and trend\nproperties of the crowd traffic, respectively. For each property, we design a\nbranch of residual convolutional units, each of which models the spatial\nproperties of the crowd traffic. ST-ResNet learns to dynamically aggregate the\noutput of the three residual neural networks based on data, assigning different\nweights to different branches and regions. The aggregation is further combined\nwith external factors, such as weather and day of the week, to predict the\nfinal traffic of crowds in each and every region. We evaluate ST-ResNet based\non two types of crowd flows in Beijing and NYC, finding that its performance\nexceeds six well-know methods.\n","Comment: AAAI 2017"]}]

As for the transverse mode contribution,\nits analysis turns out to be particularly important, because the\nmultiexponential expansion reveals a transition marking the onset of\npropagating excitations when the density is increased above a threshold value.\nWhile this finding agrees with recent literature debating the issue of\ndynamical crossover boundaries, such as the one identified with the Frenkel\nline, we can add detailed information on the modes involved in this specific\nprocess in the domains of both time and frequency. This will help obtain a\nstill missing full account of transverse dynamics, in its nonpropagating and\npropagating aspects which are linked by dynamical transitions depending on both\nthe thermodynamic states and the excitation wavevectors.\n"]}]

Increasing the disc mass to 10 or 20 MMSN leads to two\ndramatic changes in disc structure. First, the scale of the inner cavity\nshrinks substantially, bringing its outer edge closer to the binary. Second, in\naddition to the eccentric inner cavity, additional precessing eccentric\nring-like features develop in the outer regions of the discs.

However, a major remaining uncertainty is host galaxy\nobscuration. In Paper I we discovered a relation of $N_H \\propto\nM_{\\star}^{1/3}$ for the obscuration of galaxy-scale gas. Here we apply this\nobservational relation to the AGN population, and find that galaxy-scale gas is\nresponsible for a luminosity-independent fraction of Compton-thin AGN, but does\nnot produce Compton-thick columns. With the host galaxy obscuration understood,\nwe present a model of the remaining, nuclear obscurer which is consistent with\na range of observations. Our radiation-lifted torus model consists of a\nCompton-thick component ($f_{\\text{cov}}\\sim35\\%$) and a Compton-thin component\n($f_{\\text{cov}}\\sim40\\%$), which depends on both black hole mass and\nluminosity. This provides a useful summary of observational constraints for\ntorus modellers who attempt to reproduce this behaviour. It can also be\nemployed as a sub-grid recipe in cosmological simulations which do not resolve\nthe torus. We also investigate host-galaxy X-ray obscuration inside\ncosmological, hydro-dynamic simulations (EAGLE, Illustris). The obscuration\nfrom ray-traced galaxy gas can agree with observations, but is highly sensitive\nto the chosen feedback assumptions.\n","Comment: Recommended for publication in MNRAS with minor changes.

For the\nsake of comparison, we also estimated mass using Photon index vs. QPO frequency\ncorrelation method which turns out to be $11.65 \\pm 0.67 M_\\odot$ using GRO\nJ1655-40 as reference source. Combining these two estimates, the most probable\nmass of the compact object becomes $11.21^{+1.65}_{-1.96} M_\\odot$.\n","Comment: 16 Pages, 9 Figues and 4 Appendix Tables (Accepted for Publication in\n  ApJ)"]}]

These events have significant impact on the intra-cluster medium,\ndepositing vast amounts of energy - often in the form of shocks - as well as\nheavily influencing the properties of the constituent galaxy population. Many\nclusters have been shown to host large-scale diffuse radio emission, known\nvariously as radio haloes and relics. These sources arise as a result of\nelectron (re-)acceleration in cluster-scale magnetic fields, although the\nprocesses by which this occurs are still poorly understood. We present new,\ndeep radio observations of the high-redshift galaxy cluster MACS\nJ0025.4$-$1222, taken with the GMRT at 325 MHz, as well as new analysis of all\narchival $Chandra$ X-ray observations. We aim to investigate the potential of\ndiffuse radio emission and categorise the radio population of this cluster,\nwhich has only been covered previously by shallow radio surveys. We produce\nlow-resolution maps of MACS J0025.4$-$1222 through a combination of uv-tapering\nand subtracting the compact source population.

For the first time, two sources of diffuse radio emission\nare detected in MACS J0025.4$-$1222, on linear scales of several hundred kpc.\nGiven the redshift of the cluster and the assumed cosmology, these sources\nappear to be consistent with established trends in power scaling relations for\nradio relics. The X-ray temperature map presents evidence of an asymmetric\ntemperature profile and tentative identification of a temperature jump\nassociated with one relic. We classify the pair of diffuse radio sources in\nthis cluster as a pair of radio relics, given their consistency with scaling\nrelations, location toward the cluster outskirts, and the available X-ray data.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

Thus, for\nmost young stars monitoring over a month is sufficient to constrain the total\namount of variability over timescales up to a decade. The fraction of stars\nwith strong optical variability (sigma>0.3mag) is 21% in our sample and 21% in\nan unbiased control sample. An even smaller fraction (13% in our sample, 6% in\nthe control) show evidence for an increase in variability amplitude as a\nfunction of timescale from weeks to months or years. The presence of long-term\nvariability correlates with the spectral slope at 3-5mu, which is an indicator\nof inner disk geometry, and with the U-B band slope, which is an accretion\ndiagnostics. This shows that the long-term variations in CTTS are predominantly\ndriven by processes in the inner disk and in the accretion zone. Four of the\nstars with long-term variations show periods of 20-60d, significantly longer\nthan the rotation periods and stable over months to years.

This is because at\nhigh altitudes, open clusters are far from the disruptive effects of in-plane\nsubstructures, such as spiral arms, molecular clouds and the bar. However, an\nimportant aspect to consider in this scenario is that orbits of high-altitude\nopen clusters will eventually cross the Galactic plane, where the vertical\ntidal field of the disk is strong. In this work we simulate the interaction of\nopen clusters with the tidal field of a detailed Milky Way Galactic model at\ndifferent average altitudes and galactocentric radii. We find that the life\nexpectancy of clusters decreases as the maximum orbital altitude increases and\nreaches a minimum at altitudes of approximately 600 pc. Clusters near the\nGalactic plane live longer because they do not experience strong vertical tidal\nshocks from the Galactic disk; then, for orbital altitudes higher than 600 pc,\nclusters start again to live longer due to the decrease in the number of\nencounters with the disk. With our study, we find that the compressive nature\nof the tides in the arms region and the bar have an important role on the\nsurvival of small clusters by protecting them from disruption: clusters inside\nthe arms can live up to twice as long as those outside the arms at similar\ngalactocentric distance.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 6 figures, 1 table.

Over ten convergence studies of QM/MM methods have\nrevealed over the past several years that key energetic and structural\nproperties approach asymptotic limits with only very large (ca. 500-1000 atom)\nQM regions. This slow convergence has been observed to be due in part to\nsignificant charge transfer between the core active site and surrounding\nprotein environment, which cannot be addressed by improvement of MM force\nfields or the embedding method employed within QM/MM. Given this slow\nconvergence, it becomes essential to identify strategies for the most\natom-economical determination of optimal QM regions and to gain insight into\nthe crucial interactions captured only in large QM regions. Here, we extend and\ndevelop two methods for quantitative determination of QM regions. First, in the\ncharge shift analysis (CSA) method, we probe the reorganization of electron\ndensity when core active site residues are removed completely, as determined by\nlarge-QM region QM/MM calculations. Second, we introduce the\nhighly-parallelizable Fukui shift analysis (FSA), which identifies how\ncore/substrate frontier states are altered by the presence of an additional QM\nresidue on smaller initial QM regions. We demonstrate that the FSA and CSA\napproaches are complementary and consistent on three test case enzymes:\ncatechol O-methyltransferase, cytochrome P450cam, and hen eggwhite lysozyme.

Several methods are used to determine p, such as geometrical and\nhydrodynamical models or the inverse BW approach when the distance is known. We\nanalyze new HARPS-N spectra of delta Cep to measure its cycle-averaged\natmospheric velocity gradient in order to better constrain the projection\nfactor.

The reason why\nblack-hole HMXBs with these orbital periods may survive spiral in is: the\ncombination of a radiative envelope of the donor star, and a high mass of the\ncompact star. When the donor star has a radiative envelope when it begins to\noverflow its Roche lobe, and the mass ratio of donor and accretor is not larger\nthan about 3.5, the formation of a Common Envelope (CE) is avoided, and the\nsystems spiral in slowly with rapid stable Roche-lobe overflow, where the\ntransferred mass is ejected from the vicinity of the compact star (so-called\n\"isotropic re-emission\" mass loss mode, or \"SS433-like mass loss\"). If the mass\nratio of donor and black hole is $\\apgt 3.5$, these systems will go into CE\nevolution and, if they survive, produce WR/X-ray binaries with orbital periods\nof only a few hours. If the compact star is a neutron star, the mass ratio of\ndonor and accretor is very large and HMXBs with the same orbital periods do\nnever survive the mass transfer and merge. We therefore find that WR/X-ray\nbinaries are expected to only harbor black holes. Several of the well-known\nWR+O binaries in our Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds, with orbital periods in\nthe range between a week and several months will later evolve into WR+BH\nbinaries and will produce close double black holes.

If\nany graph of set $A$ has a unique coordinates with respect to a graph set $ B$,\nthen, we call $B$ is a basis for the graphs set $A$. Having a basis, any graph\nfinds a unique coordinates.

Moreover, the two order parameters bring three phases and\nthe three types of second-order phase transitions between two of them. For each\ntype of the phase transitions, all the critical exponents for elements of the\nsusceptibility matrix are computed. The critical exponents reveal that some\nelements of the matrices do not diverge even at critical points, while the\nmean-field theory predicts divergences.

Moving from one voting agent to a group of r randomly selected\nvoting agents reduces the probabilistic character of the outcome. Building r\nsuch groups, each one electing its president, to constitute a group of the\ngroups with the r local presidents electing a higher-level president, does\nreduce further the outcome probabilistic aspect.

AS 205A is a late-type\ndwarf (~K5) of ~1 Msun that belongs to a triple system. Independent photometric\nsurveys discovered that AS 205A has two distinct periods (P1=6.78 and P2=24.78\ndays) detected in the light curve that persist over several years. Period P1\nseems to be linked to the axial-rotation of the star and is caused by the\npresence of cool surface spots. Period P2 is correlated with the modulation in\nAS 205A brightness (V) and red color (V-R), consistent with a gravitating\nobject within the accretion disk. We here derive precise Near Infrared radial\nvelocities to investigate the origin of period P2 which is predicted to\ncorrespond to a cool source in a Keplerian orbit with a semi-major axis of\n~0.17 AU positioned close to the inner disk radius of 0.14 AU. The radial\nvelocity variations of AS 205A were found to have a period of P ~ 24.84 days\nand a semi-amplitude of 1.529 kms-1. This result closely resembles the P2\nperiod in past photometric observations (P ~ 24.78 days). The analysis of the\ncross-correlation function bisector has shown no correlation with the radial\nvelocity modulations, strongly suggesting that the period is not controlled by\nstellar rotation. Additional activity indicators should however be explored in\nfuture surveys. Taking this into account we found that the presence of a\nsubstellar companion is the explanation that best fits the results. We derived\nan orbital solution for AS 205A and found evidence of a m2sini 19.25 MJup\nobject in an orbit with moderate eccentricity of e~0.34.

On the\nother hand, canonicity of modal formulae is important, too, because it implies\nframe-completeness of logics axiomatized with canonical formulae.\n  Computing a first-order equivalent of a modal formula amounts to elimination\nof second-order quantifiers. Two algorithms have been developed for\nsecond-order quantifier elimination: SCAN, based on constraint resolution, and\nDLS, based on a logical equivalence established by Ackermann.\n  In this paper we introduce a new algorithm, SQEMA, for computing first-order\nequivalents (using a modal version of Ackermann's lemma) and, moreover, for\nproving canonicity of modal formulae. Unlike SCAN and DLS, it works directly on\nmodal formulae, thus avoiding Skolemization and the subsequent problem of\nunskolemization. We present the core algorithm and illustrate it with some\nexamples. We then prove its correctness and the canonicity of all formulae on\nwhich the algorithm succeeds. We show that it succeeds not only on all\nSahlqvist formulae, but also on the larger class of inductive formulae,\nintroduced in our earlier papers.
