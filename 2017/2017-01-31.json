This reduction can be\nviewed as a non-trivial modification of reductions of Trachtenbrot (1958),\nTutte (1966), Hopcroft and Tarjan (1973), Cuningham and Edmonds (1980), and\nWalsh (1982). A novel feature of our approach is that in each step all\nessential information about symmetries of $G$ are preserved.\n  A regular covering $G_0\\to H_0$ induces regular coverings $G_i \\to H_i$ where\n$H_i$ is the $i$-th reduction of $H_0$. This property allows to construct all\npossible quotients $H_0$ of $G_0$ from the possible quotients $H_r$ of $G_r$.\nBy applying this method to planar graphs, we give a direct proof of Negami's\nTheorem (1988). Our structural results are also used in subsequent papers for\nregular covering testing when $G$ is a planar graph and for characterization of\nthe automorphism groups of planar graphs.\n","Comment: The journal version of the first part of arXiv:1402.3774 . arXiv\n  admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1402.3774"]}]

A number\nof site-specific structural characteristics have been proposed, most of which\nare broadly related to either the density of contacts or the solvent\naccessibility of individual residues. Most importantly, there has been\ndisagreement in the literature over the relative importance of solvent\naccessibility and local packing density for explaining site-specific sequence\nvariability in proteins. We show here that this discussion has been confounded\nby the definition of local packing density. The most commonly used measures of\nlocal packing, such as the contact number and the weighted contact number,\nrepresent by definition the combined effects of local packing density and\nlonger-range effects. As an alternative, we here propose a truly local measure\nof packing density around a single residue, based on the Voronoi cell volume.\nWe show that the Voronoi cell volume, when calculated relative to the geometric\ncenter of amino-acid side chains, behaves nearly identically to the relative\nsolvent accessibility, and both can explain, on average, approximately 34\\% of\nthe site-specific variation in evolutionary rate in a data set of 209 enzymes.\nAn additional 10\\% of variation can be explained by non-local effects that are\ncaptured in the weighted contact number. Consequently, evolutionary variation\nat a site is determined by the combined action of the immediate amino-acid\nneighbors of that site and of effects mediated by more distant amino acids. We\nconclude that instead of contrasting solvent accessibility and local packing\ndensity, future research should emphasize the relative importance of immediate\ncontacts and longer-range effects on evolutionary variation.\n","Comment: Published in the Journal of Proteins: Structure, Function, and\n  Bioinformatics. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prot.25034/full"]}]

Corresponding approaches, e.g.\nbased on L\\'evy walk-type models, continue to be popular despite having been\nlargely discredited. We contend that there is a need for an appropriate balance\nbetween the extremes of either being overly complex or being overly simplistic,\nwhereby the discipline relies on models of intermediate complexity that are\nusable by general ecologists, but grounded in well-developed statistical\npractice and efficient to fit to large data sets.\n"]}]

Using detailed numerical experiments, we discuss\nmodifications to w-BFBT at Dirichlet boundaries that decrease the number of\niterations. The overall algorithmic performance of the Stokes solver is\ngoverned by the efficacy of w-BFBT as a Schur complement approximation and, in\naddition, by our parallel hybrid spectral-geometric-algebraic multigrid (HMG)\nmethod, which we use to approximate the inverses of the viscous block and\nvariable-coefficient pressure Poisson operators within w-BFBT.

An open source tracking framework is made available that\nfollows this decomposition closely through extensive use of generic\nprogramming. It is used to perform all experiments on four publicly available\ndatasets so the results are easily reproducible.

The IB\nformulation uses an Eulerian representation of the fluid and a Lagrangian\nrepresentation of the structure. The Lagrangian and Eulerian frames are coupled\nby integral transforms with delta function kernels. The discretized IB\nequations use approximations to these transforms with regularized delta\nfunction kernels to interpolate the fluid velocity to the structure, and to\nspread structural forces to the fluid. It is well-known that the conventional\nIB method can suffer from poor volume conservation since the interpolated\nLagrangian velocity field is not generally divergence-free, and so this can\ncause spurious volume changes. In practice, the lack of volume conservation is\nespecially pronounced for cases where there are large pressure differences\nacross thin structural boundaries.

Generally, this modification can be\naccurately captured by including only the closest resonant mode of the cavity.\nIn the circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture, where the coupling\nstrengths can be substantial, it is however found that the radiative decay\nrates are strongly influenced by far off-resonant modes.

In systems where the loss of one mode is balanced by the\ngain in another mode, EPs are generally referred to as parity-time (PT)\nsymmetry breaking point. EPs lead to many counter-intuitive phenomena such as\nloss-induced transparency, invisible sensing, loss-induced optical revival, PT\nlasing or mode switching, and topological energy transfer. On the other hand,\nthe emerging field of optomechanics has led to many important applications,\nincluding the striking observation of a phonon laser, which provides the core\ntechnology to integrate coherent phonon sources and devices. However, defects\nin materials, which have been traditionally considered to be detrimental for\nachieving phonon lasers, have been neglected in previous works. Here we show\nthat contrary to this traditional view, material defects can lead to the\nemergence of an EP, beyond which the mechanical gain and the phonon number\nstart to increase significantly with increasing loss. This indicates a novel\nand counterintuitive way to improve the performance of a phonon laser i.e., by\ntuning lossy defects, instead of adding any active dopants. In view of the\ncontrollability of defects via external electric fields, this also opens the\nway for electrically-tuned phonon lasing in optomechanical resonators.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 9 figures"]}]

The PMC uses the renormalization group equation to fix the\n$\\beta$-pattern of each order in an arbitrary pQCD approximant, and it then\ndetermines the optimal renormalization scale by absorbing all $\\beta$ terms\ninto the running coupling at each order. The resulting coefficients of the pQCD\nseries match the scheme-independent conformal series with $\\beta=0$. As in QED,\ndifferent renormalization scales appear at each order; we call this the\nmulti-scale approach. In this paper, we present a novel single-scale approach\nfor the PMC, in which a single effective scale is constructed to eliminate all\nnon-conformal $\\beta$-terms up to a given order simultaneously. The PMC\nsingle-scale approach inherits the main features of the multi-scale approach;\nfor example, its predictions are scheme-independent, and the pQCD convergence\nis greatly improved due to the elimination of divergent renormalon terms. As an\napplication of the single-scale approach, we investigate the $e^+e^-$\nannihilation cross-section ratio $R_{e^+e^-}$ and the Higgs decay-width\n$\\Gamma(H \\to b \\bar{b})$, including four-loop QCD contributions. The resulting\npredictions are nearly identical to the multi-scale predictions for both the\ntotal and differential contributions. Thus in many cases, the PMC single-scale\napproach PMC-s, which requires a simpler analysis, could be adopted as a\nreliable substitution for the PMC multi-scale approach for setting the\nrenormalization scale for high-energy processes, particularly when one does not\nneed detailed information at each order.

However, this increase may impose\ninterference on nodes within the same WBAN or on other nodes of nearby\ncoexisting WBANs, as these WBANs may use similar frequencies. Due to co-channel\ninterference, packet collisions and retransmissions are increased and\nconsequently, the power consumption of the individual WBANs may increase\ncorrespondingly. To address this problem, we adopt the approach of two-hop\ncooperative communication due to its efficiency in power savings.
