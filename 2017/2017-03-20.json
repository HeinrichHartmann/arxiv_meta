By photodissociating ultracold\n88Sr2 molecules with full control of the low-energy continuum, we access the\nquantum regime of ultracold chemistry, observing resonant and nonresonant\nbarrier tunneling, matter-wave interference of reaction products and forbidden\nreaction pathways. Our results illustrate the failure of the traditional\nquasiclassical model of photodissociation and instead are accurately described\nby a quantum mechanical model. The experimental ability to produce well-defined\nquantum continuum states at low energies will enable high-precision studies of\nlong-range molecular potentials for which accurate quantum chemistry models are\nunavailable, and may serve as a source of entangled states and coherent matter\nwaves for a wide range of experiments in quantum optics.\n"]}]

By introducing a novel\nvariation of codex, i.e., interleaved codex (the concept of codex has been used\nfor arithmetic secret sharing \\cite{C11,CCX12}), we are able to locally recover\narbitrarily large number $k$ of coordinates of a Reed-Muller code\nsimultaneously at the cost of querying $O(q^2k)$ coordinates. It turns out that\nour local decoding of Reed-Muller codes shows ({\\it perhaps surprisingly}) that\naccessing $k$ locations is in fact cheaper than repeating the procedure for\naccessing a single location for $k$ times. Precisely speaking, to get the same\nsuccess probability from repetition of local decoding for recovery of a single\ncoordinate, one has to query $O(qk^2)$ coordinates. Thus, the query complexity\nof our local decoding is smaller for $k=\\Omega(q)$. In addition, our local\ndecoding decoding is efficient, i.e., the decoding complexity is $\\poly(k,q)$.\nConstruction of an interleaved codex is based on concatenation of a codex with\na multiplication friendly pair, while the main tool to realize codex is based\non algebraic function fields (or more precisely, algebraic geometry codes).\n"]}]

In\nso doing a clear image of quantum mechanics emerges, including quantum optics,\nQED and field quantization. To our belief this description is of highly\npedagogical value. In this chapter we start with a traditional description of\nthe old quantum mechanics, first quantization and second quantization, showing\nthe tendency to renounce to visualization, as proposed by Heisenberg for the\nquantum theory. In the last part we describe an intuitive description of first\nand second quantization based on the concept of solitons, pioneered by the\n'double solution' of de Broglie in 1927. Many aspects of first and second\nquantization are clarified and visualized intuitively, including the possible\nachievement of ergodicity by the so called vacuum fluctuations.\n","Comment: 192 pages.

Such approaches mainly use the trust scores explicitly expressed by\nusers. However, it is often challenging to have users provide explicit trust\nscores of each other. There exist quite a few works, which propose Trust\nMetrics to compute and predict trust scores between users based on their\ninteractions.

Then, we propose to incorporate the predicted\ntrust scores into social matrix factorization models. By analyzing social\nrelation extraction from three well-known real-world datasets, which both:\ntrust and recommendation data available, we conclude that using the implicit\nsocial relation in social recommendation techniques has almost the same\nperformance compared to the actual trust scores explicitly expressed by users.\nHence, we build our method, called Hell-TrustSVD, on top of the\nstate-of-the-art social recommendation technique to incorporate both the\nextracted implicit social relations and ratings given by users on the\nprediction of items for an active user. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first work to extend TrustSVD with extracted social trust information.

This remarkable result is an application of the Jones polynomial. In the\ncase of the braid index of an alternating link, Murasugi had conjectured that\nthe number of Seifert circles in a reduced alternating diagram of the link\nequals the braid index of the link. This conjecture turned out to be false. In\nthis paper we prove the next best thing that one could hope for: we\ncharacterize exactly those alternating links for which their braid indices\nequal to the numbers of Seifert circles in their corresponding reduced\nalternating link diagrams. More specifically, we prove that if $D$ is a reduced\nalternating link diagram of an alternating link $L$, then $b(L)$, the braid\nindex of $L$, equals the number of Seifert circles in $D$ if and only if\n$G_S(D)$ contains no edges of weight one. Here $G_S(D)$, called the Seifert\ngraph of $D$, is an edge weighted simple graph obtained from $D$ by identifying\neach Seifert circle of $D$ as a vertex of $G_S(D)$ such that two vertices in\n$G_S(D)$ are connected by an edge if and only if the two corresponding Seifert\ncircles share crossings between them in $D$ and that the weight of the edge is\nthe number of crossings between the two Seifert circles. This result is partly\nbased on the well known MFW inequality, which states that the $a$-span of the\nHOMFLY polynomial of $L$ is a lower bound of $2b(L)-2$, as well as a result due\nto Yamada, which states that the minimum number of Seifert circles over all\nlink diagrams of $L$ equals $b(L)$.\n"]}]

Deep residual networks (ResNets) has achieved\nstate-of-the-art results in image classification and detection related problems\n[5-8]. In this ISIC 2017 skin lesion analysis challenge [9], we propose to\nexploit the deep ResNets for robust visual features learning and\nrepresentations.\n","Comment: Submission for ISIC2017 Challenge"]}]

To provide a complete description of\nheavy-ion fusion it is important to characterize the quasifission process. In\nparticular, the impact of changing the neutron-richness of the quasifission\nprocess is not well known. A previous study of Cr + W reactions at a constant\n13 % above the Coulomb barrier concluded that an increase in neutron-richness\nleads to a decrease in the prominence of the quasifission reaction channel.\nPurpose: The interplay between the fusion-fission and quasifission reaction\nchannels, with varying neutron-richness, was explored at a constant excitation\nenergy, closer to the interaction barrier than the previous work, to see if the\ncorrelation between neutron-richness and quasifission is valid at lower\nenergies. Methods: Mass distributions were determined for eight different\ncombinations of Cr + W reactions at the Australian National University at 52.0\nMeV of excitation energy in the compound nucleus. Results: A curvature\nparameter was determined for the fission-like fragment mass distributions and\ncompared to various reaction parameters known to influence quasifission.\nConclusions: The present work demonstrates that at energies near the\ninteraction barrier the deformation effects dominate over the neutron-richness\neffects in the competition between quasifission and compound nucleus formation\nin these Cr + W systems and is an important consideration for future with heavy\nand superheavy element production reactions.\n"]}]

It expresses an end-to-end logical path as a sequence\nof segments, each of which is represented by a middlepoint. In this paper, we\narguably conduct the first systematic study of traffic engineering with segment\nrouting in SDN based WANs. We first provide a theoretical characterization of\nthe problem. We show that for general segment routing, where flows can take any\npath that goes through a middlepoint, the resulting traffic engineering is\nNP-hard. We then consider segment routing with shortest paths only, and prove\nthat the traffic engineering problem can now be solved in (weakly) polynomial\ntime when the number of middlepoints per path is fixed and not part of the\ninput. Our results thus explain, for the first time, the underlying reason why\nexisting work only focuses on segment routing with shortest paths. In the\nsecond part of the paper, we study practical traffic engineering using shortest\npath based segment routing. We note that existing methods work by taking each\nnode as a candidate middlepoint. This requires solving a large-scale linear\nprogram which is prohibitively slow. We thus propose to select just a few\nimportant nodes as middlepoints for all traffic. We use node centrality\nconcepts from graph theory, notably group shortest path centrality, for\nmiddlepoint selection. Our performance evaluation using realistic topologies\nand traffic traces shows that a small percentage of the most central nodes can\nachieve good results with orders of magnitude lower runtime.\n"]}]

As a typical model,\ngraphene molecule (C )24 having coronene skeleton with seven carbon hexagons\nwas tried.Step 2 is a proton sputtering and passivation on ejected graphene\nmolecule. Slow speed proton with energy less than 4.3eV makes hydrogenation,\nGraphene molecule (C )24 was transformed to PAH (C24H12). Higher speed proton\nhaving sufficient energy larger than 18.3 eV could make a void in a molecule as\nlike C23H12. Resulted structure was a combination of two carbon pentagons and\nfive hexagons. Step 3 is photo-ionization of those molecules by high energy\nphoton. Electrons are removed to make a molecule to cation. Model molecule\n(C23H12) became mono-cation (C23H12)+, di-cation (C23H12)2+ and so on. Typical\nenergy difference between such cation was 6.5 and 10.8 eV. If the light source\nhas a nature of black-body radiation, effective temperature will be 18000K ~\n24000K, which suggested that central light source star may have 4 to 7 times\nheavier than our sun. Finally, theoretical IR spectrum was obtained. Especially\nin case of (C23H12)2+, calculated emission spectrum revealed that among 13\nmajor peaks, 11 peaks could correlate with ubiquitous observed IR one.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 9 figures"]}]

Nonetheless, the high intermittency and\nunpredictability of renewable energy make it very challenging to deliver a high\nquality of service to users in energy harvesting mobile edge computing systems.\nIn this paper, we address the challenge of incorporating renewables into mobile\nedge computing and propose an efficient reinforcement learning-based resource\nmanagement algorithm, which learns on-the-fly the optimal policy of dynamic\nworkload offloading (to the centralized cloud) and edge server provisioning to\nminimize the long-term system cost (including both service delay and\noperational cost).

Considering single trace scalar operators\nin the boundary theory and using the saddle point analysis of the worldsheet\nOPE [1], we derive an explicit relation between OPE coefficients in the\nboundary and worldsheet theories for the contribution of single trace spin\n$\\ell$ operators to the OPE. We also consider external vector operators and\nobtain the relation between OPE coefficients for the exchange of single trace\nscalar operators in the OPE. We revisit the relationship between the bulk cubic\ncouplings in the Supergravity approximation and the OPE coefficients in the\ndual boundary theory. Our results match with the known examples from the case\nof AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$.
