We use the agent-based\nmodel to test whether this change in behavior needs to be explained by means of\nstrategic considerations, i.e. firms switching their strategy in choosing\npartners dependent on their network position. We find that the observed\nbehavior can be well reproduced without such strategic considerations, this way\nchallenging the role of strategies in explaining macro patterns of\ncollaborations.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 12 figures, one page of appendix"]}]

When considering satellites with $M_*> 10^4$\\msun, we predict a\ncombined $5-25$ satellites for the five largest field dwarfs, and $10-50$ for\nthe whole Local Group field dwarf population. Because of the relatively small\nnumber of predicted dwarfs, and their extended spatial distribution, a large\nfraction each Local Group dwarf's virial volume will need to be surveyed to\nguarantee discoveries. We compute the predicted number of satellites in a given\nfield of view of specific Local Group galaxies, as a function of minimum\nsatellite luminosity, and explicitly obtain such values for the Solitary Local\ndwarfs survey. Uncertainties in abundance matching and reionization models are\nlarge, implying that comprehensive searches could lead to refinements of both\nmodels.\n","Comment: Submitted to MNRAS, 19 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables"]}]

On the\nother hand, Chiron's CO measurements are consistent with it being significantly\ndepleted over its original state, perhaps due to increased radiogenic heating\nmade possible by its much larger size or its higher processing due to orbital\nhistory. Observed spectral line profiles are consistent with development and\nsublimation of icy grains at about 5-6 AU for 29P and Hale-Bopp, and this is\nprobably a common feature in distantly active comets, and an important source\nof volatiles for all comets within 5 AU.

However, it is still not well understood how to create a\nbiologically plausible network of brain-like, spiking neurons with multi-layer,\nunsupervised learning. This paper explores a novel bio-inspired spiking CNN\nthat is trained in a greedy, layer-wise fashion. The proposed network consists\nof a spiking convolutional-pooling layer followed by a feature discovery layer\nextracting independent visual features. Kernels for the convolutional layer are\ntrained using local learning. The learning is implemented using a sparse,\nspiking auto-encoder representing primary visual features. The feature\ndiscovery layer extracts independent features by probabilistic, leaky\nintegrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons that are sparsely active in response to\nstimuli. The layer of the probabilistic, LIF neurons implicitly provides\nlateral inhibitions to extract sparse and independent features. Experimental\nresults show that the convolutional layer is stack-admissible, enabling it to\nsupport a multi-layer learning. The visual features obtained from the proposed\nprobabilistic LIF neurons in the feature discovery layer are utilized for\ntraining a classifier. Classification results contribute to the independent and\ninformative visual features extracted in a hierarchy of convolutional and\nfeature discovery layers. The proposed model is evaluated on the MNIST digit\ndataset using clean and noisy images. The recognition performance for clean\nimages is above 98%. The performance loss for recognizing the noisy images is\nin the range 0.1% to 8.5% depending on noise types and densities.

First, fundamental results\non the caching capabilities, including caching probability and cache duration\nare derived for the proposed dual-mode network scenario.

If we define the context of the interaction to be the objects\ninvolved, then most current methods can be categorized as either: (i) training\na single classifier on the combination of the interaction and its context; or\n(ii) aiming to recognize the interaction independently of its explicit context.\nBoth methods suffer limitations: the former scales poorly with the number of\ncombinations and fails to generalize to unseen combinations, while the latter\noften leads to poor interaction recognition performance due to the difficulty\nof designing a context-independent interaction classifier. To mitigate those\ndrawbacks, this paper proposes an alternative, context-aware interaction\nrecognition framework. The key to our method is to explicitly construct an\ninteraction classifier which combines the context, and the interaction. The\ncontext is encoded via word2vec into a semantic space, and is used to derive a\nclassification result for the interaction.\n  The proposed method still builds one classifier for one interaction (as per\ntype (ii) above), but the classifier built is adaptive to context via weights\nwhich are context dependent. The benefit of using the semantic space is that it\nnaturally leads to zero-shot generalizations in which semantically similar\ncontexts (subjectobject pairs) can be recognized as suitable contexts for an\ninteraction, even if they were not observed in the training set.\n","Comment: 13 pages.

The\noptical and near-infrared afterglow of this GRB had a peculiar spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) with a strong flux-drop at 8000 {\\AA} (4000 {\\AA}\nrest-frame) suggesting an unusually steep extinction curve. By analyzing the\ncontribution and physical properties of the host galaxy, we here aim at\nproviding additional information on the properties and origin of this steep,\nnon-standard extinction. We find that the strong flux-drop in the GRB afterglow\nspectrum at < 8000 {\\AA} and rise at < 4000 {\\AA} is well explained by the\ncombination of a steep extinction curve along the GRB line of sight and\ncontamination by the host galaxy light so that the scenario with an extreme\n2175 {\\AA} extinction bump can be excluded. We localise the GRB to be at a\nprojected distance of approximately 4 kpc from the centre of the host galaxy.\nBased on emission-line diagnostics of the four detected nebular lines, Halpha,\nHbeta, [O II] and [O III], we find the host to be a modestly star forming (SFR\n= 1.34 +/- 0.04 Msun yr^-1) and relatively metal poor (Z = 0.35^{+0.15}_{-0.11}\nZsun) galaxy with a large dust content, characterized by a measured visual\nattenuation of A_V = 1.74 +/- 0.41 mag, thus unexceptional in all its physical\nproperties. We model the extinction curve of the host-corrected afterglow and\nshow that the standard dust properties causing the reddening seen in the Local\nGroup are inadequate in describing the steep drop. We conclude that the steep\nextinction curve seen in the afterglow towards the GRB is of exotic origin, is\nsightline-dependent only and thus solely a consequence of the circumburst\nenvironment.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 9 figures and 4 tables.

These estimates are\nused to initialize fast, randomized, local search algorithms, which in turn\nexpose more information about the search space that is subsequently used to\nrefine the models. We demonstrate the technique on multiple optimization\nproblems that have arisen in a variety of real-world domains, including:\npacking, graphics, job scheduling, layout and compression. The problems include\ncombinatoric search spaces, discontinuous and highly non-linear spaces, and\nspan binary, higher-cardinality discrete, as well as continuous parameters.\nStrengths, limitations, and extensions of the approach are extensively\ndiscussed and demonstrated.\n"]}]

Such\nspacetimes are used to test the status of cosmic censorship in the context of\nlow-energy string theory. We prove that - within this family of solutions -\nregular black holes cannot evolve into naked singularities by accreting null\ndust, unless standard energy conditions are violated. Secondly, we employ\nS-duality to derive new time-dependent dyon solutions with a nontrivial axion\nturned on. Although they share the same causal structure as their\nEinstein-Maxwell-dilaton counterparts, these solutions possess both electric\nand magnetic charges.\n","Comment: 20 pages + appendices, 6 figures"]}]

When the magnetic dipole-dipole\ninteraction (DDI) is neglected, a skyrmion can show a current-induced\nrotational motion together with a helicity rotation since the energy is\nindependent of the helicity. Here, we explore the skyrmion dynamics in a\nfrustrated magnetic system based on the $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$-$J_{3}$ classical\nHeisenberg model explicitly by including the DDI. The skyrmion energy acquires\na helicity dependence due to the DDI, resulting in a current-induced\ntranslational motion with a fixed helicity. The lowest energy states are the\ndegenerate Bloch-type states with two distinguishable helicities, which could\nbe used as information carriers in the binary memory. The skyrmion helicity can\nbe identified by applying a small driving current as the direction of the\ntranslational motion is dependent of the helicity. It is found that by\nincreasing the intensity of the driving current, the helicity locking-unlocking\ntransition occurs, where the translational skyrmion motion with a fixed\nhelicity changes to a rotational skyrmion motion together with a helicity\nrotation. This new aspect of the helicity-orbital coupling allows us to realize\nthe flip of the helicity between two stable Bloch-type states by applying a\nstrong current pulse, which could act as a switching process in the binary\nmemory.

In our experiments, the\nprecision of measured tilt angle is about 10-4rad with OAM orders of -3~3.\nUsing the measured angle value, the additional phase delay due to axis tilt can\nbe calculated so that the dispersion of OAM spectrum can be corrected with a\nsimple formula while the optical axis is not aligned. The experimental results\nindicate that the original OAM spectrum has been successfully extracted for not\nonly the pure OAM state but also the superposed OAM states.\n"]}]

LDGRFs suggest that a\nparticle-acceleration mechanism operates over many hours to produce energetic\nprotons that stream continually towards the solar surface. Coronal shocks,\ndriven by the expansion of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), could be the source\nof these energetic particles. For this hypothesis to work, the shock must be\nmagnetically connected to the solar disk visible from Earth in order for\nparticles accelerated at the shock to be channelled towards and impact the\nvisible chromosphere. In this paper, we investigate if the spatial and temporal\nevolution of the coronal shocks, inferred from stereoscopic observations, could\nbe the accelerators of the particles producing the LDGRFs. We analyse three\nCMEs that (1) erupted behind the solar limb viewed from Earth, (2) were\nassociated with the early formation of coronal shocks measured by ground-based\nradio spectrographs, and (3) were associated with $\\gamma-$ray events measured\nby the {\\it Fermi}-Large Area Telescope (LAT) instrument. A 3D triangulation\ntechnique, based on remote-sensing observations is employed to model the\nexpansion of these three CME shocks from above the solar surface to the upper\ncorona. Coupling the expansion model to different models of the coronal\nmagnetic field allows us to derive the time-dependent distribution of shock\nMach numbers and the magnetic connection of particles produced by the shock to\nthe solar surface visible from Earth. For all events, the reconstructed shock\nfront was magnetically connected to the visible solar surface after the start\nof the flare and just before the onset of the $>$ 100 MeV gamma-ray emission\nobserved by {\\it Fermi}-LAT $\\gamma$-ray emission. n.

Only for certain types of Bianchi\nmodular forms, which we will call non-genuine, it is possible at present to\ndevelop dimension formulas: They are (twists of) those forms which arise from\nelliptic cuspidal modular forms via the Langlands Base-Change procedure, or\narise from a quadratic extension of the imaginary quadratic field via\nautomorphic induction (so-called CM-forms). The remaining Bianchi modular forms\nare what we call genuine, and they are of interest for an extension of the\nmodularity theorem (formerly the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, crucial in the\nproof of Femat's Last Theorem) to imaginary quadratic fields.

The design of the\nfeedback control is based on the Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) compensator.\nComputational results demonstrate the effectiveness of this control and the key\nfinding is that Kasper Wing configurations are in general more controllable\nthan their single plate counterparts and also exhibit larger basins of\nattraction under LQG feedback control.
