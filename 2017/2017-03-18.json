We obtain the gapped bands with a Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling dependent pseudo Zeeman field due to the interplay of\nsubstrate induced interactions. This enables us to obtain an expression of the\ndielectric function in the finite doping case ignoring the spin-flip scattering\nevents completely. We observe that the relative strength of screening is nearly\na constant with relative to the changes in the the carrier density.The stronger\nconfinement capability of GrTMD Plasmon(tunable)compared to that of standalone\ngraphene is a major outcome of our analysis;the plasmon dispersion yields the\nq2/3 behavior and not the well known q1/2 behavior. We also find that the\nabsorbance and the transmittance are increasing functions of the frequency and\nthe gate voltage. This outcome is useful for devices utilizing\nphotoconductivity and the photo-electric effect.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 1 figure. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:1612.02359"]}]
