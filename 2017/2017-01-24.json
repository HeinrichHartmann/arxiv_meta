The focus\nlies on an observer O interrogating a system S with binary questions and S's\nstate is taken as O's `catalogue of knowledge' about S. The mathematical tools\nof the framework are simple and we attempt to highlight all underlying\nassumptions. Four rules are imposed, asserting (1) a limit on the amount of\ninformation available to O; (2) the mere existence of complementary\ninformation; (3) O's total amount of information to be preserved in-between\ninterrogations; and, (4) O's `catalogue of knowledge' to change continuously in\ntime in-between interrogations and every consistent such evolution to be\npossible. This approach permits a constructive derivation of quantum theory,\nelucidating how the ensuing independence, complementarity and compatibility\nstructure of O's questions matches that of projective measurements in quantum\ntheory, how entanglement and monogamy of entanglement and, more generally, how\nthe correlation structure of arbitrarily many qubits and rebits arises. The\nrules yield a reversible time evolution and a quadratic measure, quantifying\nO's information about S. Finally, it is shown that the four rules admit two\nsolutions for the simplest case of a single elementary system: the Bloch ball\nand disc as state spaces for a qubit and rebit, respectively, together with\ntheir symmetries as time evolution groups. The reconstruction for arbitrarily\nmany qubits is completed in a companion paper (arXiv:1511.01130) where an\nadditional rule eliminates the rebit case.

Although this distribution represents a very general scattering\nmodel valid over a wide range of atmospheric conditions, it is has not been\nconsidered in the past in conjunction with FSO systems possibly because of its\nmathematical complexity. The proposed analytical framework yields exact\nperformance evaluation results for MIMO systems with two transmit- and an\narbitrary number of receive apertures. In addition, tight upper bounds are\nderived for the error probability for OSM systems with an arbitrary number of\ntransmit apertures as well as for convolutionally encoded signals. The\nperformance of OSM is compared to that of well established coherent FSO\nschemes, employing spatial diversity at the transmitter or the receiver only.\nSpecifically, it is shown that OSM can offer comparable performance with\nconventional coherent FSO schemes while outperforming the latter in terms of\nspectral efficiency and hardware complexity. Various numerical performance\nevaluation results are also presented and compared with equivalent results\nobtained by Monte Carlo simulations which verify the accuracy of the derived\nanalytical expressions.\n"]}]

The rate difference between the best known\nlower and upper bounds on the sum capacity remains as large as 1 bit per\nchannel use especially around $g^2=P^{-1/3}$, where $P$ is the symmetric power\nconstraint and $g$ is the symmetric real cross-channel coefficient. In this\npaper, we pay attention to the \\emph{moderate interference regime} where\n$g^2\\in (\\max(0.086, P^{-1/3}),1)$. We propose a new upper-bounding technique\nthat utilizes noisy observation of interfering signals as genie signals and\napplies time sharing to the genie signals at the receivers. A conditional\nversion of the worst additive noise lemma is also introduced to derive new\ncapacity bounds. The resulting upper (outer) bounds on the sum capacity\n(capacity region) are shown to be tighter than the existing bounds in a certain\nrange of the moderate interference regime.

Such solutions have been proposed as exotic\nalternatives to the black-hole paradigm because they can be as compact as black\nholes and exist in any mass range.

Therefore, such relations can be used to discern a\ngravastar from an ordinary compact star, but not to break the degeneracy with\nthe black-hole case.

Previous work has shown that\nsubhalos are expected to boost the DM signal of their host halos significantly.\nYet, these works traditionally assumed that subhalos exhibit similar structural\nproperties than those of field halos, while it is known that subhalos are more\nconcentrated. Building upon our N-body data analysis, we refine the\nsubstructure boost model of Sanchez-Conde & Prada (2014), and find boosts that\nare a factor 2-3 higher. We further refine the model to include unavoidable\ntidal stripping effects on the subhalo population. For field halos, this\nintroduces a moderate 20-30% suppression. Yet, for subhalos like those hosting\ndwarf galaxy satellites, tidal stripping plays a critical role, the boost being\nat the level of a few tens of percent at most.

This\nhighly nontrivial coincidence between the two quantization schemes requires\ninfinite constraints among the refined Gopakumar-Vafa invariants. The\nequivalence for mirror curves of genus one has been verified for some local del\nPezzo surfaces. In this paper, we generalize the correspondence to higher\ngenus, and analyze in detail the resolved $\\mathbb{C}^3/\\mathbb{Z}_5$ orbifold\nand several $SU(N)$ geometries. We also give a proof for some models at\n$\\hbar=2\\pi/k$.\n","Comment: 91 pages, 14 figures, v2: journal version, some small corrections"]}]

Here we present a new approach to using object pose information to\nimprove deep network learning. While existing large-scale datasets, e.g.\nImageNet, do not have pose information, we leverage the newly published\nturntable dataset, iLab-20M, which has ~22M images of 704 object instances shot\nunder different lightings, camera viewpoints and turntable rotations, to do\nmore controlled object recognition experiments. We introduce a new\nconvolutional neural network architecture, what/where CNN (2W-CNN), built on a\nlinear-chain feedforward CNN (e.g., AlexNet), augmented by hierarchical layers\nregularized by object poses. Pose information is only used as feedback signal\nduring training, in addition to category information; during test, the\nfeedforward network only predicts category. To validate the approach, we train\nboth 2W-CNN and AlexNet using a fraction of the dataset, and 2W-CNN achieves 6%\nperformance improvement in category prediction. We show mathematically that\n2W-CNN has inherent advantages over AlexNet under the stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) optimization procedure. Further more, we fine-tune object\nrecognition on ImageNet by using the pretrained 2W-CNN and AlexNet features on\niLab-20M, results show that significant improvements have been achieved,\ncompared with training AlexNet from scratch. Moreover, fine-tuning 2W-CNN\nfeatures performs even better than fine-tuning the pretrained AlexNet features.\nThese results show pretrained features on iLab- 20M generalizes well to natural\nimage datasets, and 2WCNN learns even better features for object recognition\nthan AlexNet.\n","Comment: 10 pages, accepted by WACV 2017"]}]

In the proposed approach, an outlier is set\napart from an inlier by comparing their coherence with the rest of the data\npoints. As inliers lie on a low dimensional subspace, they are likely to have\nstrong mutual coherence provided there are enough inliers. By contrast,\noutliers do not typically admit low dimensional structures, wherefore an\noutlier is unlikely to bear strong resemblance with a large number of data\npoints. The mutual coherences are computed by forming the Gram matrix of\nnormalized data points. Subsequently, the subspace is recovered from the span\nof a small subset of the data points that exhibit strong coherence with the\nrest of the data. As coherence pursuit only involves one simple matrix\nmultiplication, it is significantly faster than the state of-the-art robust PCA\nalgorithms. We provide a mathematical analysis of the proposed algorithm under\na random model for the distribution of the inliers and outliers. It is shown\nthat the proposed method can recover the correct subspace even if the data is\npredominantly outliers.

The rule requires only one\naddition and two comparisons for each synaptic weight using a two-compartment\nleaky Integrate & Fire (I&F) neuron, making it very suitable for implementation\nin digital or mixed-signal neuromorphic hardware. Our results show that using\neRBP, deep representations are rapidly learned, achieving nearly identical\nclassification accuracies compared to artificial neural network simulations on\nGPUs, while being robust to neural and synaptic state quantizations during\nlearning.\n"]}]

However, despite its success and rapid\nadoption, MAP estimation is not theoretically well understood yet, and the\nprevalent view is that it is generally not proper Bayesian estimation in a\ndecision-theoretic sense. This paper presents a new decision-theoretic\nderivation of MAP estimation in Bayesian models that are log-concave. Our\nanalysis is based on differential geometry and proceeds as follows. First, we\nexploit the log-concavity of the model to induce a Riemannian geometry on the\nparameter space. We then use differential geometry to identify the natural or\ncanonical loss function to perform Bayesian point estimation in that Riemannian\nmanifold. For log-concave models this canonical loss is the Bregman divergence\nof the negative log posterior density, a similarity measure rooted in convex\nanalysis that in addition to the relative position of points also takes into\naccount the geometry of the space, and which generalises the Euclidean squared\ndistance to non-Euclidean settings. We then show that the MAP estimator is the\nBayesian estimator that minimises the expected canonical loss, and that the\nposterior mean or MMSE estimator minimises the expected dual canonical loss.\nFinally, we establish universal performance and stability guarantees for MAP\nand MMSE estimation in high dimensional log-concave models. These results\nprovide a new understanding of MAP and MMSE estimation under log-concavity, and\nreveal new insights about their good empirical performance and about the roles\nthat log-concavity plays in high dimensional inference problems.\n"]}]

We also give a simplicial version of the Kruskal's and\nJarn\\`{i}k-Prim-Dijkstra's algorithms for generating minimal spanning acycles.\nIn the second part, using simplicial Kruskal's algorithm, we prove that the set\nof face-weights of a minimal spanning acycle is same as the set of `death\ntimes' in the associated persistence diagram provided the weights on faces\ninduce a filtration of the complex. Further, we prove a stability result for\nthe face-weights in a minimal spanning acycle, and hence for death and birth\ntimes under the $L_p$ matching distance for any $p \\in \\{0,\\ldots,\\infty\\}.$ In\nthe third part, we consider randomly weighted $d-$complexes on $n$ vertices.

Finally, unknown parameters of the optimal\nmulti-layer reinsurance policy are estimated using some additional appropriate\ncriteria. Three simulation-based studies have been conducted to demonstrate:\n({\\bf 1}) The practical applications of our findings and ({\\bf 2}) How one may\nemploy other appropriate criteria to estimate unknown parameters of an optimal\nmulti-layer contract. The multi-layer reinsurance policy, similar to the\noriginal stop-loss reinsurance policy is optimal, in a same sense. Moreover it\nhas some other optimal criteria which the original policy does not have. Under\noptimal criterion of minimizing general translative and monotone risk measure\n$\\rho(\\cdot)$ of {\\it either} the insurer's total risk {\\it or} both the\ninsurer's and the reinsurer's total risks, this article (in its discussion)\nalso extends a given optimal reinsurance contract $f(\\cdot)$ to a multi-layer\nand continuous reinsurance policy.\n"]}]

This need has motivated significant research into\nmulti-level memory systems that can store multiple bits of information per\ndevice. Although both the memory state of these devices and much of the data\nthey store are intrinsically analog-valued, both are quantized for use with\ndigital systems and discrete error correcting codes. Using phase change memory\nas a prototypical multi-level storage technology, we herein demonstrate that\nanalog-valued devices can achieve higher capacities when paired with analog\ncodes. Further, we find that storing analog signals directly through\njoint-coding can achieve low distortion with reduced coding complexity. By\njointly optimizing for signal statistics, device statistics, and a distortion\nmetric, finite-length analog encodings can perform comparable to digital\nsystems with asymptotically infinite large encodings. These results show that\nend-to-end analog memory systems have not only the potential to reach higher\nstorage capacities than discrete systems, but also to significantly lower\ncoding complexity, leading to faster and more energy efficient storage.\n"]}]

Common intuition is that defects with shallow levels act as\ncarrier providers and defects with deep levels are carrier killers. Here,\ntaking the Cu defects in CdTe as an example, we show that shallow defects can\nplay both roles. Using first-principles calculation methods combined with\nthermodynamic simulations, we study the dialectic effects of Cu-related defects\non hole density and lifetime in bulk CdTe over a wide range of Cu incorporation\nconditions. Because CuCd can form a relatively shallow acceptor in CdTe, we\nfind that increased Cu incorporation into CdTe indeed can help achieve high\nhole density; however, too much Cu can cause significant non-radiative\nrecombination. We discuss two strategies to balance the contradictory effects\nof Cu defects based on the calculated impact of Cd chemical potential, copper\ndefect concentrations, and incorporation temperature on lifetime and hole\ndensity. The results indicates that to optimize the Cu doping in CdTe, it is\nimportant to control the total amount of Cu incorporated into CdTe and optimize\nthe match between the Cu incorporation temperature and the Cd chemical\npotential.

The currently\naccepted physical model of transcription predicts the existence of a physical\nlimit on the maximal rate of transcription, which does not depend on the\ntranscribed gene. This limit appears as a result of polymerase \"traffic jams\"\nforming in the bulk of the 1D DNA chain at high polymerase concentrations.\nRecent experiments have, for the first time, allowed one to access live gene\nexpression dynamics in the Drosophila fly embryo in vivo under the conditions\nof heavy polymerase load and test the predictions of the model. Our analysis of\nthe data shows that the maximal rate of transcription is indeed the same for\nthe Hunchback, Snail and Knirps gap genes, and modified gene constructs in\nnuclear cycles 13, 14, but the experimentally observed value of the maximal\ntranscription rate corresponds to only 40 % of the one predicted by this model.\nWe argue that such a decrease must be due to a slower polymerase elongation\nrate in the vicinity of the promoter region. This effectively shifts the\nbottleneck of transcription from the bulk to the promoter region of the gene.\nWe suggest a quantitative explanation of the difference by taking into account\nabortive transcription initiation. Our calculations based on the independently\nmeasured abortive initiation constant in vitro confirm this hypothesis and find\nquantitative agreement with MS2 fluorescence live imaging data in the early\nfruit fly embryo. If our explanation is correct, then the transcription rate\ncannot be increased by replacing \"slow codons\" in the bulk with synonymous\ncodons, and experimental efforts must be focused on the promoter region\ninstead.

Such a space, as\nan alternative to expensive built dwellings, could potentially support new,\nminimalist lifestyles of occupants, defined as the neo-nomads, aligned with\ntheir work experience in the digital domain through the generation of emotional\nexperiences of spaces. Data from the experiments confirmed the hypothesis that\nperceivable emotional aspects of real-world spaces could be successfully\ngenerated through simulation of design attributes in the virtual space. The\nsubjective response to the virtual space was consistent with corresponding\nresponses from real-world color and brightness emotional perception. Our data\ncould serve the virtual reality (VR) community in its attempt to conceive of\nfurther applications of virtual spaces for well-defined activities.\n","Comment: 12 figures"]}]

In an attempt to quantify this evidence, we investigate the\npossibility that the observed spectrum of the neutron star in HESS J1731-347 is\na combination of the spectra produced in a hydrogen atmosphere of the hotspots\nand of the cooler remaining part of the neutron star surface. The lack of\npulsations in this case has to be explained either by a sufficiently small\nangle between the neutron star spin axis and the line of sight, or by a\nsufficiently small angular distance between the hotspots and the neutron star\nrotation poles. As the observed flux from a non-uniformly emitting neutron star\ndepends on the angular distribution of the radiation emerging from the\natmosphere, we have computed two new grids of pure carbon and pure hydrogen\natmosphere model spectra accounting for Compton scattering.

Indeed, according\nto our previous study [Phys. Rev.

Then the\nexpression of the anisotropic elastic field is recalled in term of strain\ntensor components to show that image fields should be also considered. The\nother aspect of this comment concerns the supposedly loss of correlation along\nthe nanorod caused by the twist. It is claimed for instance by LRPS that : \"As\nan effect of the dislocation strain and twist, if the cylinder is long enough,\nupper/lower regions tend to lose correlation, as if the rod were made of\ndifferent sub-domains.\". This assertion appears to us misleading since for any\ntwist the position of all the atoms in the nanorod is perfectly defined and\ntherefore prevents any loss of correlation. To clarify this point, it should be\nspecified that this apparent loss of correlation can not be ascribed to the\ntwisted state of the nanowire but is rather due to a limitation of the X-ray\npowder diffraction.

An example of recently\ndiscovered new concepts is the N\\'{e}el spin-orbit torque which allows for the\nantiferromagnetic order parameter to be controlled by an electrical current in\ncommon microelectronic circuits. In this review we discuss the utility of\nantiferromagnets as active and supporting materials for spintronics, the\ninterplay of antiferromagnetic spintronics with other modern research fields in\ncondensed matter physics, and its utility in future \"More than Moore\"\ninformation technologies.\n","Comment: Overview of the topics presented at the Workshop of Antiferromagnetic\n  Spintronics, 2016, Mainz, Germany"]}]
