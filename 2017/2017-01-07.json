Of\nsuch is the recognition of self and nonself cells by the immune system. This\nimmune response process is regulated by the major histocompatibility complex\n(MHC) protein which is encoded by the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex.\nUnderstanding the binding potential between MHC and peptides is crucial to our\nunderstanding of the functioning of the immune system, which in turns will\nbroaden our understanding of autoimmune diseases and vaccine design.\n  We introduce a new distributed representation of amino acids, named HLA-Vec,\nthat can be used for a variety of downstream proteomic machine learning tasks.\nWe then propose a deep convolutional neurerror can be used only in preambleal\nnetwork architecture, named HLA-CNN, for the task of HLA class I-peptide\nbinding prediction. Experimental results show combining the new distributed\nrepresentation with our HLA-CNN architecture acheives state-of-the-art results\nin the vast majority of the latest two Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) weekly\nautomated benchmark datasets.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables"]}]
