The objective of this study is\nto identify one truth from multiple conflicting objects for a certain predicate\nof a real-world entity. An intuitive principle based on common sense is that an\nobject from a reliable source is trustworthy; thus, a source that provide\ntrustworthy object is reliable. Many truth discovery methods based on this\nprinciple have been proposed to estimate source reliability and identify the\ntruth. However, the effectiveness of existing truth discovery methods is\nsignificantly affected by the number of objects provided by each source.\nTherefore, these methods cannot be trivially extended to resolve conflicts in\nLinked Data with a scale-free property, i.e., most of the sources provide few\nconflicting objects, whereas only a few sources have many conflicting objects.\nTo address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called TruthDiscover to\nidentify the truth in Linked Data with a scale-free property. Two strategies\nare adopted in TruthDiscover to reduce the effect of the scale-free property on\ntruth discovery. First, this approach leverages the topological properties of\nthe Source Belief Graph to estimate the priori beliefs of sources, which are\nutilized to smooth the trustworthiness of sources.

To this end, we study a~certain class of graphs, which we call flip\ngraphs. These graphs encode adjacency structure in certain subcomplexes of\niterated standard chromatic subdivisions of a simplex. While keeping the\ngeometric background in mind for an additional intuition, we develop the\nstructure theory of matchings in flip graphs in a purely combinatorial way. Our\nbound for the IIS complexity is then a corollary of this general theory.\n  As an afterthought of our result, we suggest to change the overall paradigm.\nSpecifically, we think, that the bounds on the IIS complexity of solving WSB\nfor n processes should be formulated in terms of the size of the solutions of\nthe associated Diophantine equation, rather than in terms of the value n\nitself.\n","Comment: Final version, as accepted for publication"]}]

These are devices that act both as a threshold laser and a coherent\nperfect absorber (CPA) for the same values of their physical parameters. Unlike\na homogeneous slab that is made to act as a CPA, a slab CPA-laser would absorb\nthe incident waves coming from the left and right of the device provided that\nthey have appropriate intensity and phase contrasts. We provide a comprehensive\nstudy of one of the simplest experimentally accessible examples of a CPA-laser,\nnamely a PT-symmetric optical slab system consisting of a balanced pair of\nadjacent or separated gain and loss components. In particular, we give a closed\nform expression describing the spectral singularities of the system which\ncorrespond to its CPA-laser configurations. We determine the intensity and\nphase contrasts for the TE and TM waves that are emitted (absorbed) whenever\nthe slab acts as a laser (CPA). We also investigate the behavior of the\ntime-averaged energy density and Poynting vector for these waves. This is\nnecessary for determining the optimal values of the physical parameters of the\nsystem that make it act as a CPA-laser. These turn out to correspond to\nsituations where the separation distance $s$ between the gain and loss layers\nis an odd multiple of a characteristic length scale $s_0$.

Such a relation\nholds only in frequency ranges where the flux is dominated by synchrotron\nemission, as this radiation originates from cosmic rays produced in supernova\nremnants, therefore reflecting recent star formation. At low frequencies\nsynchrotron emission can be absorbed by the free-free mechanism.

If the observed galaxy is at high redshift, this critical frequency\nmoves along with other spectral features to lower values in the observing\nframe. In the absence of systematic evolutionary effects, one would therefore\nexpect that the method can be applied at lower observing frequencies for high\nredshift observations. However, in case of a strong increase of the typical gas\ncolumn densities towards high redshift, the increasing free-free absorption may\nerase the star formation signatures at low frequencies.

The purpose of this study is twofold.\nFirst, based on the expected energy restricted Boltzmann machine (EE-RBM), we\npropose two activation functions for neural network function approximation in\nreinforcement learning: the sigmoid-weighted linear (SiL) unit and its\nderivative function (SiLd1). The activation of the SiL unit is computed by the\nsigmoid function multiplied by its input, which is equal to the contribution to\nthe output from one hidden unit in an EE-RBM.

However, PCA has two major weaknesses. Firstly, it only\nconsiders linear correlations among variables (features), and secondly it is\nnot suitable for categorical data. We resolve these issues by proposing\nMaximally Correlated Principal Component Analysis (MCPCA). MCPCA computes\ntransformations of variables whose covariance matrix has the largest Ky Fan\nnorm.

For jointly Gaussian variables we show that the covariance\nmatrix corresponding to the identity (or the negative of the identity)\ntransformations majorizes covariance matrices of non-identity functions. Using\nthis result we characterize global MCPCA optimizers for nonlinear functions of\njointly Gaussian variables for every rank constraint. For categorical variables\nwe characterize global MCPCA optimizers for the rank one constraint based on\nthe leading eigenvector of a matrix computed using pairwise joint\ndistributions. For a general rank constraint we propose a block coordinate\ndescend algorithm and show its convergence to stationary points of the MCPCA\noptimization.

Some neurons are selective for the expanding radial\nmotion that occurs as an observer moves through the environment (\"heading\"),\nand computational models can account for this finding. However, ample evidence\nsuggests that MSTd neurons may exhibit a continuum of visual response\nselectivity to large-field motion stimuli, but the underlying computational\nprinciples by which these response properties are derived remain poorly\nunderstood. Here we describe a computational model of MSTd based on the\nhypothesis that neurons in MSTd efficiently encode the continuum of large-field\nretinal flow patterns on the basis of inputs received from neurons in MT, with\nreceptive fields that resemble basis vectors recovered with nonnegative matrix\nfactorization (NMF). These assumptions are sufficient to quantitatively\nsimulate neurophysiological response properties of MSTd cells such as radial,\ncircular, and spiral motion tuning, suggesting that these properties might\nsimply be a by-product of MSTd neurons performing dimensionality reduction on\ntheir inputs. At the population level, model MSTd accurately predicts heading\nusing a sparse distributed code, consistent with the idea that biological MSTd\nmight operate in a sparseness regime well-suited to efficiently encode a number\nof self-motion variables. The present work provides an alternative to the\ntemplate-model view of MSTd, and offers a biologically plausible account of the\nreceptive field structure across a wide range of visual response properties in\nMSTd.\n"]}]

To date pedestrian dynamics have\nbeen primarily studied in the natural and engineering sciences. Pedestrians are\nanalyzed and modeled as driven particles revealing self-organizing phenomena\nand complex transport characteristics. However, pedestrians in crowds also\nbehave as living beings according to stimulus-response mechanisms or act as\nhuman subjects on the basis of social norms, social identities or strategies.\nTo show where pedestrian dynamics need social psychology in addition to the\nnatural sciences we propose the application of three categories: phenomena,\nbehavior and action. They permit a clear discrimination between situations in\nwhich minimal models from the natural sciences are appropriate and those in\nwhich sociological and psychological concepts are needed.\n  To demonstrate the necessity of this framework, an experiment in which a\nlarge group of people (n=270) enters a concert hall through two different\nspatial barrier structures is analyzed. These two structures correspond to\neveryday situations such as boarding trains and access to immigration desks.\nMethods from the natural and social sciences are applied. Firstly, physical\nmeasurements show the influence of the spatial structure on the dynamics of the\nentrance procedure. Density, waiting time and speed of progress show large\nvariations. Secondly, a questionnaire study (n=60) reveals how people perceive\nand evaluate these entrance situations. Markedly different expectations, social\nnorms and strategies are associated with the two spatial structures.
