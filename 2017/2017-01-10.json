While it is universally understood that\nsingle-field inflation predicts negligible scale-dependent bias compared to\ncurrent observational uncertainties, there is still disagreement on the exact\nlevel of scale-dependent bias at a level that could strongly impact inferences\nmade from future surveys. In this paper, we clarify this confusion and derive\nin various ways that there is exactly zero scale-dependent bias in single-field\ninflation. Much of the current confusion follows from the fact that\nsingle-field inflation does predict a mode coupling of matter perturbations at\nthe level of $f_{NL}^{loc} \\approx -5/3$, which naively would lead to\nscale-dependent bias. However, we show explicitly that this mode coupling\ncancels out when perturbations are evaluated at a fixed physical scale rather\nthan fixed coordinate scale. Furthermore, we show how the absence of\nscale-dependent bias can be derived easily in any gauge. This result can then\nbe incorporated into a complete description of the observed galaxy clustering,\nincluding the previously studied general relativistic terms, which are\nimportant at the same level as scale-dependent bias of order $f_{NL}^{loc} \\sim\n1$.

Moreover, we predict that\nincreasing the lattice by $<4\\%$ can annihilate all Weyl nodes, driving a novel\ntopological metal-to-insulator transition from a Weyl semimetal state to a\ntopological insulator state. We further discover that changing the lattice\nconstant can move the Weyl nodes and the van Hove singularities with enhanced\ndensity of states to the chemical potential.

This\npaper investigates the adaptive control of robotic systems with an inner/outer\nloop structure, taking into full account the effects of the dynamics and the\nsystem uncertainties, and both the task-space control and joint-space control\nare considered. We propose a dynamic modularity approach to resolve this issue,\nand a class of adaptive outer loop control schemes is proposed and their role\nis to dynamically generate the joint velocity (or position) command for the\nlow-level joint servoing loop. Without relying on the ad hoc assumption that\nthe joint servoing is fast enough or the modification of the low-level joint\ncontroller structure, we rigorously show that the proposed outer loop\ncontrollers can ensure the stability and convergence of the closed-loop system.\nWe also propose the outer loop versions of several standard joint-space\ndirect/composite adaptive controllers for rigid or flexible-joint robots, and a\npromising conclusion may be that most torque-based adaptive controllers for\nrobots can be designed to fit the inner/outer loop structure by using the new\ndefinition of the joint velocity (or position) command.

Fundamentally, the\ndriving breaks the continuous time-translation symmetry and replaces it with\nthe symmetry with respect to time translation by the driving period. This\ndiscrete symmetry should be reflected in the character of the oscillations.\nHere, we perform experimental and theoretical study of new aspects of the\nbackaction and the discrete time-translation symmetry using a micromechanical\nresonator designed to have two nonlinearly coupled vibrational modes with\nstrongly differing frequencies and decay rates. We find that self-sustained\noscillations are induced not only in the low frequency mode as measured in\nprevious experiments, but also in the high frequency mode. The vibration\nfrequencies and amplitudes are determined by the system nonlinearity, which\nalso leads to bistability and hysteresis.

We find that the phase fluctuations of the two modes are nearly\nperfectly anti-correlated. At the same time, in each mode the phase undergoes\nanomalous diffusion, where the time dependence of the phase variance follows a\nsuperlinear rather than the standard linear power law. Our analysis shows that\nthe exponent of the power law is determined by the exponent of the 1/f-type\nintrinsic frequency noise of the resonator.

An important exception to\nthis rule are states which, while being at high energy, maintain a low entropy.\nSuch states can interestingly still display features of quantum criticality,\nespecially in one dimension. Here, we consider high-energy states in\nanisotropic Heisenberg quantum spin chains obtained by splitting the ground\nstate's magnon Fermi sea into separate pieces. Using methods based on\nintegrability, we provide a detailed study of static and dynamical spin-spin\ncorrelations. These carry distinctive signatures of the Fermi sea splittings,\nwhich would be observable in eventual experimental realizations.

The possibility that single\nphotons can carry OAM has made this degree of freedom an ideal candidate for\nthe investigation of complex quantum phenomena and their applications. Research\nin this direction has ranged from experiments on complex forms of quantum\nentanglement to the interaction between light and quantum states of matter.\nFurthermore, the use of OAM in quantum information has generated a lot of\nexcitement, as it allows for encoding large amounts of information on a single\nphoton. Here we explain the intuition that led to the first quantum experiment\nwith OAM fifteen years ago. We continue by reviewing some key experiments\ninvestigating fundamental questions on photonic OAM and the first steps into\napplying these properties in novel quantum protocols.

Methods: We use X-ray and radio luminosity\nrelations in accreting BHs, along with the latest scaling relations between the\nmass of the central black hole (MBH) and the properties of its host spheroid,\nto predict MBH in seven LLAGN, that were previously reported to be in the IMBH\nregime. Namely, we use the recently re-evaluated MBH - Msph (Msph : spheroid\nabsolute magnitude at 3.6 microm) scaling relation for spiral galaxies, the MBH\n- nsph (nsph : major axis Sersic index of the bulge) relation, the MBH - PA\n(PA: pitch angle) relation and the FP-BH for weakly accreting BHs, to\nindependently estimate MBH in all seven galaxies.

Previous theoretical analyses\nhave shown that the elastic breakup (EBU) mechanism (i.e., projectile breakup\nleaving the target in its ground state) is able to account only for a small\nfraction of the total $\\alpha$ inclusive breakup cross sections, pointing\ntoward the dominance of non-elastic breakup (NEB) mechanisms.\n  Purpose: We aim to provide a systematic study of the $\\alpha$ inclusive cross\nsections observed in nuclear reactions induced by $^{6}$Li projectiles. In\naddition to estimating the total $\\alpha$ singles cross sections, it is our\ngoal to evaluate angular and energy distributions of these $\\alpha$ particles\nand compare with experimental data, when available.\n  Method: We compute separately the EBU and NEB components of the inclusive\nbreakup cross sections. For the former, we use the continuum-discretized\ncoupled-channels (CDCC) method, which treats this mechanism to all orders. For\nthe NEB part, we employ the the model proposed in the eighties by Ichimura,\nAustern and Vincent [Phys. Rev. C32, 432 (1982)], within the DWBA\napproximation.\n  Results: Overall, the sum of the computed EBU and NEB cross sections is found\nto reproduce very well the measured singles cross sections. In all cases\nanalyzed, we find that the inclusive breakup cross section is largely dominated\nby the NEB component.\n  Conclusions: The presented method provides a global and systematic\ndescription of inclusive breakup reactions induced by $^{6}$Li projectiles. It\nprovides also a natural explanation of the previously observed underestimation\nof the measured $\\alpha$ yields by CDCC calculations. The method used here can\nbe extended to other weakly-bound projectiles, including halo nuclei.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 16 figures, fig. 12 updated; some typos corrected"]}]

They are commonly believed not to have formed in situ,\nrequiring inwards migration towards the host star. One of the proposed\nmigration scenarios is secular high-eccentricity or high-$e$ migration, in\nwhich the orbit of the planet is perturbed to high eccentricity by secular\nprocesses, triggering strong tidal evolution and orbital migration. Previous\ntheoretical studies have considered secular excitation in stellar binaries.\nRecently, a number of HJs have been observed in stellar triple systems. In the\nlatter, the secular dynamics are much richer compared to stellar binaries, and\nHJs could potentially be formed more efficiently. Here, we investigate this\npossibility by modeling the secular dynamical and tidal evolution of planets in\ntwo hierarchical configurations in stellar triple systems. We find that the HJ\nformation efficiency is higher compared to stellar binaries, but only by at\nmost a few tens of per cent. The orbital properties of the HJs formed in the\nsimulations are very similar to HJs formed in stellar binaries, and similarly\nto studies of the latter we find no significant number of warm Jupiters. HJs\nare only formed in our simulations for triples with specific orbital\nconfigurations, and our constraints are approximately consistent with current\nobservations. In future, this allows to rule out high-$e$ migration in stellar\ntriples if a HJ is detected in a triple grossly violating these constraints.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS. 14 pages, 11 figures"]}]

EMT can also be co-opted by cancer cells to\nacquire metastatic potential and drug-resistance. Recent research has argued\nthat epithelial (E) cells can undergo either a partial EMT to attain a hybrid\nepithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype that typically displays collective\nmigration, or a complete EMT to adopt a mesenchymal (M) phenotype that shows\nindividual migration. The core EMT regulatory network -\nmiR-34/SNAIL/miR-200/ZEB1 - has been identified by various studies, but how\nthis network regulates the transitions among the E, E/M, and M phenotypes\nremains controversial. Two major mathematical models - ternary chimera switch\n(TCS) and cascading bistable switches (CBS) - that both focus on the\nmiR-34/SNAIL/miR-200/ZEB1 network, have been proposed to elucidate the EMT\ndynamics, but a detailed analysis of how well either or both of these two\nmodels can capture recent experimental observations about EMT dynamics remains\nto be done.

Under suitable local hypotheses, we show\nthat a cuspidal cohomological automorphic representation $\\pi$ of $U$ whose\nAsai $L$-function has a pole at the edge of the critical strip is nearly\nequivalent to a cuspidal cohomological automorphic representation $\\pi'$ of $U$\nthat is $U^{\\sigma}$-distinguished in the sense that there is a form in the\nspace of $\\pi'$ admitting a nonzero period over $U^{\\sigma}$. This provides\ncohomologically nontrivial cycles of middle dimension on unitary Shimura\nvarieties analogous to those on Hilbert modular surfaces studied by Harder,\nLanglands, and Rapoport.\n","Comment: This is an old paper uploaded for arXival purposes.

Quantum tomography\n(QT) is the standard tool for diagnosing quantum states, process, and readout\ndevices by providing complete information. However, QT is limited since it is\nexpensive to not only implement experimentally, but also requires heavy\nclassical post-processing of data. In this dissertation, we introduce new\nmethods for QT that are more efficient to implement and robust to noise and\nerrors, thereby making QT a more practical tool for current quantum information\nexperiments.\n  The crucial detail that makes these new, efficient, and robust methods\npossible is prior information about the quantum system. This prior information\nis prompted by the goals of most experiments in quantum information, which\nrequire pure states, unitary processes, and rank-1 POVM operators. Therefore,\nmost experiments are designed to operate near this ideal regime. We show that\nwhen this is the case, QT can be accomplished with significantly fewer\nresources, and produce a robust estimate in the presence of noise and errors.\nMoreover, the estimate is also robust if the state is not exactly pure, the\nprocess is not exactly unitary, or the POVM is not exactly rank-1. Such\ncompelling methods are only made possible by the positivity constraint on\nquantum states, processes, and POVMs. This requirement is an inherent feature\nof quantum mechanics, but has powerful consequences to QT.\n  Since QT is necessarily an experimental tool, we discuss a test of these new\nmethods in an experimental setting. The physical system is an ensemble of\nlaser-cooled cesium atoms in the laboratory of Prof. Poul Jessen. Experiments\nwere conducted by Hector Sosa-Martinez et al. to demonstrate different QT\nprotocols. We compare the results, and conclude that the new methods are\neffective.\n","Comment: Ph.D. Thesis, 180 pages"]}]

Specificially, all the intermediate nodes\nwhich successfully decode the source signal are considered as relay candidates.\nFor each candidate, we derive the sub-optimal closed-form power allocation\nsolution and obtain the secrecy rate result of the corresponding JRJS scheme.\nThen, the candidate which is capable of achieving the highest secrecy rate is\nselected as the relay. Two assumptions about the channel state information\n(CSI), namely the full CSI (FCSI) and partial CSI (PCSI), are considered.\nSimulation results show that the proposed JRJS scheme outperforms the\nconventional pure relay selection, pure jamming and GSVD based beamforming\nschemes in terms of secrecy rate. Additionally, the proposed FCSI based power\nallocation (FCSI-PA) and PCSI based power allocation (PCSI-PA) schemes both\nachieve higher secrecy rates than the equal power allocation (EPA) scheme.\n","Comment: 14 pages, IEEE Transactions on Communications, 2017"]}]

To better understand the transport behavior in a\ngranitic aquifer, we combine tracer test data with single-hole\nground-penetrating radar (GPR) reflection monitoring data. Five successful\ntracer tests were performed under various experimental conditions between two\nboreholes 6 m apart. For each experiment, saline tracer was injected into a\npreviously identified packed-off transmissive fracture while repeatedly\nacquiring single-hole GPR reflection profiles together with electrical\nconductivity logs in the pumping borehole. By analyzing depth-migrated GPR\ndifference images together with tracer breakthrough curves and associated\nsimplified flow and transport modeling, we estimate (1) the number, the\nconnectivity, and the geometry of fractures that contribute to tracer\ntransport, (2) the velocity and the mass of tracer that was carried along each\nflow path, and (3) the effective transport parameters of the identified flow\npaths. We find a qualitative agreement when comparing the time evolution of GPR\nreflectivity strengths at strategic locations in the formation with those\narising from simulated transport. The discrepancies are on the same order as\nthose between observed and simulated breakthrough curves at the outflow\nlocations. The rather subtle and repeatable GPR signals provide useful and\ncomplementary information to tracer test data acquired at the outflow locations\nand may help us to characterize transport phenomena in fractured rock aquifers.\n"]}]

Its popularity\narose from a tractable asymptotic expansion for implied volatility, derived by\nheat kernel methods. As markets moved to historically low rates, this expansion\nappeared to yield inconsistent prices. Since the model is deeply embedded in\nmarket practice, alternative pricing methods for SABR have been addressed in\nnumerous approaches in recent years. All standard option pricing methods make\ncertain regularity assumptions on the underlying model, but for SABR these are\nrarely satisfied. We examine here regularity properties of the model from this\nperspective with view to a number of (asymptotic and numerical) option pricing\nmethods. In particular, we highlight delicate degeneracies of the SABR model\n(and related processes) at the origin, which deem the currently used popular\nheat kernel methods and all related methods from (sub-) Riemannian geometry\nill-suited for SABR-type processes, when interest rates are near zero. We\ndescribe a more general semigroup framework, which permits to derive a suitable\ngeometry for SABR-type processes (in certain parameter regimes) via symmetric\nDirichlet forms. Furthermore, we derive regularity properties (Feller-\nproperties and strong continuity properties) necessary for the applicability of\npopular numerical schemes to SABR-semigroups, and identify suitable Banach- and\nHilbert spaces for these. Finally, we comment on the short time and large time\nasymptotic behaviour of SABR-type processes beyond the heat-kernel framework.\n"]}]

The network must also be able to smoothly change the\naccess technologies, or called a vertical handover, to ensure QoS for ongoing\napplications. In addition, the network must have a mechanism to save energy.\nFor hese reasons, an SDN approach, which has been proposed in a previous work,\nis considered. The performance of the system has been validated by a set of\nexperiments in a real testbed. The obtained results show that the proposed\nvertical handover can save at least 24.42 per cent of the energy consumed by\nthe wireless communication. The handover delay with different UDP traffic is\nless than 150ms. Moreover, the network allows a device using Bluetooth to talk\nwith another one using Wi-Fi over a heterogeneous connection where the\nend-to-end jitter is mainly below 20ms and the packet loss rate is as small as\n0.2 per cent.\n"]}]

This\nenables the planner to select the optimal subset of agents and obtain the\nefficient execution, which requires that each hidden decision of each agent\nshould genuinely depend on the hidden capabilities and earlier hidden chance\nevents of all other players. We will construct another mechanism that is\ncollusion-resistant but implements an only approximately efficient outcome. The\nlatter mechanism is widely applicable, and the major application details will\nbe elaborated.\n","Comment: 53 pages.

It gives optimal lower bounds\nfor many problems, has application to classical complexity in formula size\nlower bounds, and is versatile with equivalent formulations in terms of weight\nschemes, eigenvalues, and Kolmogorov complexity. All these formulations rely on\nthe principle that if an algorithm successfully computes a function then, in\nparticular, it is able to distinguish between inputs which map to different\nvalues.\n  We present a stronger version of the adversary method which goes beyond this\nprinciple to make explicit use of the stronger condition that the algorithm\nactually computes the function.

Moreover ADV+- is always at least as\nlarge as the adversary method ADV, and we show an example of a monotone\nfunction for which ADV+-(f)=Omega(ADV(f)^1.098).
