We suggest that the high orbital energy and low angular momentum of\nthe flow make it possible for magnetic stresses to reduce the matter's already\nsmall angular momentum to the point at which it can fall ballistically into the\nSMBH before circularization. As a result, the efficiency is only ~1--10% of a\nstandard accretion disk's efficiency. Thus, the intrinsically high eccentricity\nof the tidal debris naturally explains why most TDE candidates are fainter than\nexpected.\n","Comment: 8 pages, Accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

These possibilities emerge from the\nstrongly reduced GP wavelength, lp, compared to the photon wavelength, l0,\nwhich can be controlled by modulating the carrier density of graphene via\nelectrical gating. Recently, GPs in a graphene-insulator-metal configuration\nhave been predicted to exhibit a linear dispersion (thus called acoustic\nplasmons) and a further reduced wavelength, implying an improved field\nconfinement, analogous to plasmons in two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs)\nnear conductive substrates.

We examine two cases: (i) data aggregation (only one sink node\ncomputes) and (ii) consensus (all nodes compute the same function). By\nquantifying the accumulation of information loss in distributed computing, we\nobtain fundamental limits on network computation rate as a function of\nincremental distortions (and hence incremental loss of information) along the\nedges of the network. The above characterization, based on quantifying\ndistortion accumulation, offers an improvement over classical cut-set type\ntechniques which are based on overall distortions instead of incremental\ndistortions. This quantification of information loss qualitatively resembles\ninformation dissipation in cascaded channels [1]. Surprisingly, this\naccumulation effect of distortion happens even at infinite blocklength.\nCombining this observation with an inequality on the dominance of mean-square\nquantities over relative-entropy quantities, we obtain outer bounds on the rate\ndistortion function that are tighter than classical cut-set bounds by a\ndifference which can be arbitrarily large in both data aggregation and\nconsensus. We also obtain inner bounds on the optimal rate using random\nGaussian coding, which differ from the outer bounds by $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{D})$,\nwhere $D$ is the overall distortion. The obtained inner and outer bounds can\nprovide insights on rate (bit) allocations for both the data aggregation\nproblem and the consensus problem.

In order to fully exploit the potential of these data sets, it\nis important to understand the systematic effects associated with the\ninstrument and the analysis pipeline. A common approach to tackle this is to\nforward-model the entire system - from the hardware to the analysis of the data\nproducts. For this purpose, we introduce two newly developed, open-source\nPython packages: the HI Data Emulator (HIDE) and the Signal Extraction and\nEmission Kartographer (SEEK) for simulating and processing single-dish radio\nsurvey data. HIDE forward-models the process of collecting astronomical radio\nsignals in a single-dish radio telescope instrument and outputs pixel-level\ntime-ordered-data. SEEK processes the time-ordered-data, removes artifacts from\nRadio Frequency Interference (RFI), automatically applies flux calibration, and\naims to recover the astronomical radio signal. The two packages can be used\nseparately or together depending on the application. Their modular and flexible\nnature allows easy adaptation to other instruments and data sets. We describe\nthe basic architecture of the two packages and examine in detail the noise and\nRFI modeling in HIDE, as well as the implementation of gain calibration and RFI\nmitigation in SEEK. We then apply HIDE & SEEK to forward-model a Galactic\nsurvey in the frequency range 990 - 1260 MHz based on data taken at the Bleien\nObservatory. For this survey, we expect to cover 70% of the full sky and\nachieve a median signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 5 - 6 in the cleanest\nchannels including systematic uncertainties.

For more than a decade, the measure here called $ \\Delta I^{DL} $\nhas been believed exact. However, we have recently shown that it can exceed the\ninformation loss $ \\Delta I^{B} $ caused by optimal decoders constructed\nignoring noise correlations. Unfortunately, the different information notions\nunderlying $ \\Delta I^{DL} $ and $ \\Delta I^{B} $, and the putative rigorous\ninformation-theoretical derivation of $ \\Delta I^{DL} $, both render unclear\nwhether those findings indicate either flaws in $ \\Delta I^{DL} $ or major\ndepartures from traditional relations between information and decoding. Here we\nresolve this paradox and prove that, under certain conditions, observing $\n\\Delta I^{DL} {>}\\Delta I^{B} $ implies that $ \\Delta I^{DL} $ is flawed.\nMotivated by this analysis, we test both measures using neural populations that\ntransmit independent information. Our results show that $ \\Delta I^{DL} $ may\ndeem noise correlations more important when decoding the populations together\nthan when decoding them in parallel, whereas the opposite may occur for $\n\\Delta I^{B} $. We trace these phenomena back, for $ \\Delta I^{B} $, to the\nchoice of tie-breaking rules, and for $ \\Delta I^{DL} $, to unforeseen\nlimitations within its information-theoretical foundations. Our study\ncontributes with better estimates that potentially improve theoretical and\nexperimental inferences currently drawn from $ \\Delta I^{DL} $ without noticing\nthat it may constitute an upper bound. On the practical side, our results\npromote the design of optimal decoding algorithms and neuroprosthetics without\nrecording noise correlations, thereby saving experimental and computational\nresources.\n","Comment: To improve readability, this version has more material, more\n  explanations, more figures, less symbols, and more demonstrations than the\n  previous version"]}]

This framework incorporates\nweak helix structure dependent forces into the determination of the free energy\nand average structure of a plectoneme. Notably, due to their chiral nature,\nhelix structure dependent forces break the symmetry between left and right\nhanded supercoiling. The theoretical approach, presented here, also provides a\nsystematic way of enforcing the topological constraint of closed loop\nsupercoiling in the variational approximation. At large plectoneme lengths, by\nconsidering correlation functions in an expansion in terms of the spatial mean\ntwist density about its thermally averaged value, it can be argued that\ntopological constraint may be approximated with by replacing twist and writhe\nby their thermal averages. A Lagrange Multiplier, containing the sum of average\ntwist and writhe, can be added to the free energy to conveniently inforce this\nresult. The average writhe can be calculated through the thermal average of\nGauss integral in the variational approximation. Furthermore, this approach\nallows for a possible way to calculate finite size corrections due to the\ntopological constraint. Using interaction energy terms from the mean-field\nKornyshev-Leikin theory, for parameter values that correspond to weak helix\ndependent forces, we calculate the free energy, fluctuation magnitudes and mean\ngeometric parameters for the plectoneme.

Information cascades are triggered when the activation\nof a set of initial nodes (seeds) results in diffusion to large number of\nnodes. Here, several novel approaches for seed initiation that replace the\ncommonly used activation of all seeds at once with a sequence of initiation\nstages are introduced. Sequential strategies at later stages avoid seeding\nhighly ranked nodes that are already activated by diffusion active between\nstages. The gain arises when a saved seed is allocated to a node difficult to\nreach via diffusion. Sequential seeding and a single stage approach are\ncompared using various seed ranking methods and diffusion parameters on real\ncomplex networks. The experimental results indicate that, regardless of the\nseed ranking method used, sequential seeding strategies deliver better coverage\nthan single stage seeding in about 90% of cases. Longer seeding sequences tend\nto activate more nodes but they also extend the duration of diffusion. Various\nvariants of sequential seeding resolve the trade-off between the coverage and\nspeed of diffusion differently.\n"]}]

Because the mixing entropy in such systems is divergent in\nthe thermodynamic limit we show that the configurational entropy estimated from\nstandard computational approaches to characterize glassy states also diverges.\nThis reasoning would suggest that polydisperse materials cannot undergo a glass\ntransition, in contradiction to experiments. We explain that this argument\nstems from the confusion between configurations in phase space and states\ndefined by free energy minima, and propose a simple method to compute a finite\nand physically meaningful configurational entropy in continuously polydisperse\nsystems. Physically, the proposed approach relies on an effective description\nof the system as an $M^*$-component system with a finite $M^*$, for which\nfinite mixing and configurational entropies are obtained. We show how to\ndirectly determine $M^*$ from computer simulations in a range of glass-forming\nmodels with different size polydispersities, characterized by hard and soft\ninterparticle interactions, and by additive and non-additive interactions.

On the extended Cohn-Kanade dataset (CK+), our one-shot\nautomatic method on raw face videos performs as competitive as SRC applied on\nmanually prepared action components and performs even better than SRC in terms\nof true positive rate.

By naturally combining two\nrecently rising techniques: active learning (AL) and self-paced learning (SPL),\nour framework is capable of automatically annotating new instances and\nincorporating them into training under weak expert re-certification. We first\ninitialize the classifier using a few annotated samples for each individual,\nand extract image features using the convolutional neural nets. Then, a number\nof candidates are selected from the unannotated samples for classifier\nupdating, in which we apply the current classifiers ranking the samples by the\nprediction confidence. In particular, our approach utilizes the high-confidence\nand low-confidence samples in the self-paced and the active user-query way,\nrespectively. The neural nets are later fine-tuned based on the updated\nclassifiers. Such heuristic implementation is formulated as solving a concise\nactive SPL optimization problem, which also advances the SPL development by\nsupplementing a rational dynamic curriculum constraint.

For the case of\nzero surface momentum, we can analytically derive scaling relations between the\ndecay length of the surface states and the amplitude and penetration length of\nthe radiation. For topological insulators, we again find that circularly\npolarized radiation can generate states on the surfaces; these states have much\nlarger decay lengths than the surface states which are present even in the\nabsence of radiation. Finally, we show that radiation can generate surface\nstates for trivial insulators also.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 9 figures"]}]

Furthermore, the\nanalysis of the kinematic properties of the stellar population put in evidence\na significant velocity shift (~1 km s^{-1}) between the two sub-clusters\nlocated around the North and South main clouds.

Considering that giant\nplanets seem to be more common around stars of higher metallicity and stars of\nhigher mass, it is notable that the hosts are all metal-rich, late-type stars.\nWith orbital separations that place both WASP-105b and WASP-107b in the\nweak-tide regime, measurements of the alignment between the planets' orbital\naxes and their stars' spin axes may help us to understand the inward migration\nof short-period, giant planets.\n  The mass of WASP-107b (2.2 $M_{\\rm Nep}$, 0.40 $M_{\\rm Sat}$) places it in\nthe transition region between the ice giants and gas giants of the Solar\nSystem. Its radius of 0.94 $R_{\\rm Jup}$ suggests that it is a low-mass gas\ngiant with a H/He-dominated composition. The planet thus sets a lower limit of\n2.2 $M_{\\rm Nep}$ on the planetary mass above which large gaseous envelopes can\nbe accreted and retained by proto-planets on their way to becoming gas giants.\nWe may discover whether WASP-107b more closely resembles an ice giant or a gas\ngiant by measuring its atmospheric metallicity via transmission spectroscopy,\nfor which WASP-107b is a very good target.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 6 figures, submitted to A&A"]}]

One of the earliest steps in\nusing QUS methods is contouring a region of interest (ROI) inside the tumour in\nultrasound B-mode images. While manual segmentation is a very time-consuming\nand tedious task for human experts, auto-contouring is also an extremely\ndifficult task for computers due to the poor quality of ultrasound B-mode\nimages. However, for the purpose of cancer response prediction, a rough\nboundary of the tumour as an ROI is only needed. In this research, a\nsemi-automated tumour localization approach is proposed for ROI estimation in\nultrasound B-mode images acquired from patients with locally advanced breast\ncancer (LABC). The proposed approach comprised several modules, including 1)\nfeature extraction using keypoint descriptors, 2) augmenting the feature\ndescriptors with the distance of the keypoints to the user-input pixel as the\ncentre of the tumour, 3) supervised learning using a support vector machine\n(SVM) to classify keypoints as \"tumour\" or \"non-tumour\", and 4) computation of\nan ellipse as an outline of the ROI representing the tumour. Experiments with\n33 B-mode images from 10 LABC patients yielded promising results with an\naccuracy of 76.7% based on the Dice coefficient performance measure. The\nresults demonstrated that the proposed method can potentially be used as the\nfirst stage in a computer-assisted cancer response prediction system for\nsemi-automated contouring of breast tumours.\n","Comment: Accepted at BHI 2017"]}]
