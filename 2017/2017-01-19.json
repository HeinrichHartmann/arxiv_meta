We consider an\nobjective function that involves the mean and variance of the control\nobjective, leading to a risk-averse optimal control problem. To make the\noptimal control problem tractable, we invoke a quadratic Taylor series\napproximation of the control objective with respect to the uncertain parameter\nfield. This enables deriving explicit expressions for the mean and variance of\nthe control objective in terms of its gradients and Hessians with respect to\nthe uncertain parameter. The risk-averse optimal control problem is then\nformulated as a PDE-constrained optimization problem with constraints given by\nthe forward and adjoint PDEs defining these gradients and Hessians. The\nexpressions for the mean and variance of the control objective under the\nquadratic approximation involve the trace of the (preconditioned) Hessian, and\nare thus prohibitive to evaluate. To overcome this difficulty, we employ\nrandomized trace estimators. We illustrate our approach with two specific\nproblems: the control of a semilinear elliptic PDE with an uncertain boundary\nsource term, and the control of a linear elliptic PDE with an uncertain\ncoefficient field. For the latter problem, we derive adjoint-based expressions\nfor efficient computation of the gradient of the risk-averse objective with\nrespect to the controls. Our method ensures that the cost of computing the\nrisk-averse objective and its gradient with respect to the control---measured\nin the number of PDE solves---is independent of the (discretized) parameter and\ncontrol dimensions, and depends only on the number of random vectors employed\nin the trace estimation.

As a result, the predicted spectrum provides a better fit to the\nPLANCK mission data than standard inflation, where the initial conditions are\nset in the general relativity regime. Thus, our proposal brings out a deep\ninterplay between the ultraviolet and the infrared. Finally, the proposal also\nleads to specific predictions for power suppression at large angular scales\nalso for the (T-E and E-E) correlations involving electric polarization. The\nPLANCK team is expected to release this data in the coming year.\n","Comment: Invited article, to appear in CQG. This paper is addressed both to\n  the quantum gravity and cosmology audiences.

This paper proposes a Saliency-Guided Complexity Control (SGCC)\napproach for HEVC decoding, which reduces the decoding complexity to the target\nwith minimal perceptual quality loss. First, an HEVC domain method is developed\nto detect video saliency from HEVC bitstreams, as the preliminary for assessing\nperceptual quality.

One important component in this formulation is the modelled\nrelationship between decoding complexity reduction and DF disabling/MC\nsimplification, which determines the control accuracy of our approach. Another\ncomponent is the modelled relationship between quality loss and DF disabling/MC\nsimplification, responsible for optimizing perceptual quality. By solving the\nSGCC formulation, we can obtain the DF and MC states of each LCU given a target\ncomplexity, and then the decoding complexity can be reduced to the target.\nFinally, the experimental results show the effectiveness of our SGCC approach,\nfrom the aspects of control performance, complexity-distortion performance and\nsubjective quality.\n"]}]

However, we find that the observed relation between\nbaryonic mass and $V_{max}$ places tight constraints on the maximum suppression\nfrom reionisation. At the 3-$\\sigma$ confidence level neither energetic\nfeedback nor photoevaporation are effective enough to reconcile the\ndisagreement. In the case of maximum baryonic effects, the theoretical estimate\nstill deviates significantly from the observations for $V_{max} < 60$ km/s. CDM\npredicts at least 1.8 times more galaxies with $V_{max} = 50$ km/s and 2.5\ntimes more than observed at $30$ km/s. This might point to the need to modify\ncosmological predictions at small scales.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 18 figures"]}]

We then exploit the functorial properties of Crofton formulas to pass\nto the general case. We also identify the invariant formulas explicitly for all\n$O(p,2)$-invariant valuations. The proof relies on the exact computation of\nsome integrals of independent interest. Those are related to Selberg's integral\nand to the Beta function of a matrix argument, except that the\npositive-definite matrices are replaced with matrices of all signatures. We\nalso analyze the distinguished invariant Crofton distribution supported on the\nminimal orbit, and show that, somewhat surprisingly, it sometimes defines the\ntrivial valuation, thus producing a distribution in the kernel of the cosine\ntransform of particularly small support. In the heart of the paper lies the\ndescription by Muro of the $|\\det X|^s$ family of distributions on the space of\nsymmetric matrices, which we use to construct a family of $O(p,q)$-invariant\nCrofton distributions. We conjecture there are no others, which we then prove\nfor $O(p,2)$ with $p$ even. The functorial properties of Crofton distributions,\nwhich serve an important tool in our investigation, are studied by T.

We conclude that both DMEOSs and\ncentral pressure ratios of DM to NM affect the slope of the mass-radius\nrelation of DMANSs. This is because of the interaction between DM and NM, which\nleads to gravitationally or self-bound DMANSs. We study the radius of the NM\nsphere as well as the radius of the DM halo for different DMANSs. The results\nconfirm that, in some cases, a NM sphere with a small radius is surrounded by a\nhalo of DM with a larger radius. Our calculations verify that, due to the\ndifferent degrees of DM domination in DMANSs, with a value of the visible\nradius of a star two possible DMANSs with different masses can be exist. The\ngravitational redshift is also calculated for DMANSs with different DMEOSs and\ncentral pressure ratios.

Different field configurations are looked at in\norder to study various phenomena including multiphoton pair production,\nSauter-Schwinger pair production and dynamically assisted pair production. The\nmain focus lies on pulsed, rotating fields with one main frequency component\nwhich are called rotating Sauter pulses. The results are obtained via two\nnumerical methods, that rest on different theoretical approaches. A generic\nmethod is derived from the Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner (DHW) formalism which\nentails a modified quantum kinetic equation. We call the numerical solution of\nthis equation the Wigner method.

In the case of rotating Sauter pulses a completely different numerical\nmethod is developed, which is based on a semiclassical approach and therefore\ncalled the semiclassical method. A number of parameter studies are conducted to\nunderstand pair production in rotating Sauter pulses. The Wigner method and the\nsemiclassical method are compared exhaustively and found to complement each\nother. This makes it possible to cover the complete range of parameters of the\nrotating Sauter pulse, which helps to calculate the pair production rates for\nexperiments involving counter-propagating circularly polarized laser light.

One problematic feature\nof these models is their failure to converge under maximal (or even\nnear-maximal) random effects structures. The lack of convergence is relatively\nunaddressed in linguistics and when it is addressed has resulted in statistical\npractices (e.g. Jaeger, 2009; Gries, 2015; Bates, et al, 2015b) that are\npremised on the idea that non-convergence is an indication that a random\neffects structure is over-specified (or not parsimonious), the parsimonious\nconvergence hypothesis (PCH). We test the PCH by running simulations in lme4\nunder two sets of assumptions for both a linear dependent variable and a binary\ndependent variable in order to assess the rate of non-convergence for both\ntypes of mixed effects models when a known maximal effect structure is used to\ngenerate the data (i.e. when non-convergence cannot be explained by random\neffects with zero variance). Under the PCH, lack of convergence is treated as\nevidence against a more maximal random effects structure, but that result is\nnot upheld with our simulations. We provide an alternative model, fully\nspecified Bayesian models implemented in rstan (Stan Development Team, 2016;\nCarpenter, et al, in press) that removed the convergence problems almost\nentirely in simulations of the same conditions.

A simple\napproach is Stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE), which estimates the risk in\nthe data space, while a recent modification (GSURE) estimates the risk in the\nspace of the unknown variable. It seems intuitive that the latter is more\nappropriate for ill-posed problems, since the properties in the data space do\nnot tell much about the quality of the reconstruction. We provide theoretical\nstudies of both estimators for linear Tikhonov regularization in a finite\ndimensional setting and estimate the quality of the risk estimators, which also\nleads to asymptotic convergence results as the dimension of the problem tends\nto infinity. Unlike previous papers, who studied image processing problems with\na very low degree of ill-posedness, we are interested in the behavior of the\nrisk estimators for increasing ill-posedness. Interestingly, our theoretical\nresults indicate that the quality of the GSURE risk can deteriorate\nasymptotically for ill-posed problems, which is confirmed by a detailed\nnumerical study. The latter shows that in many cases the GSURE estimator leads\nto extremely small regularization parameters, which obviously cannot stabilize\nthe reconstruction. Similar but less severe issues with respect to robustness\nalso appear for the SURE estimator, which in comparison to the rather\nconservative discrepancy principle leads to the conclusion that regularization\nparameter choice based on unbiased risk estimation is not a reliable procedure\nfor ill-posed problems. A similar numerical study for sparsity regularization\ndemonstrates that the same issue appears in nonlinear variational\nregularization approaches.\n"]}]

Contrary to ordinary surface plasmons of metallic bulk\nmaterials, their dispersion goes to zero in the long wavelength limit, thus\ncovering a broad range of energies from terahertz to near infrared, and from\nmesoscopic wavelengths down to just a few nanometers. Using specific and most\ncharacteristic examples, we review first the properties of plasmons in\ntwo-dimensional (2D) metallic layers from an experimental point of view. As\ndemonstrated, tuning of their dispersion is possible by changes of charge\ncarrier concentration in the partially filled 2D conduction bands, but for the\nrelativistic electron gas like in graphene only in the long wavelength limit.\nFor short wavelengths, on the other hand, the dispersion turns out to be\nindependent of the position of the Fermi level with respect to the Dirac point.\nA linear dispersion, seen under the latter conditions in graphene, can also be\nobtained in non-relativistic electron gases by coupling between 2D and 3D\nelectronic systems. As a well investigated example, the acoustic surface\nplasmons in Shockley surface states, coupled with the bulk electronic system,\nare discussed. Also the introduction of anisotropy, e.g. by regular arrays of\nsteps, seems to result in linearization (and to partial localization of the\nplasmons normal to the steps, depending on wavelengths). In quasi-one\ndimensional (1D) systems, such as arrays of gold chains on regularly stepped Si\nsurfaces, only the dispersion is 1D, whereas shape and slope of the dispersion\ncurves depend on the 2D distribution of charge within each terrace and on\ncoupling between wires on different terraces.\n","Comment: 37 pages, 17 figures, review to appear in Springer Handbook on\n  Surface Science in 2017"]}]

This\nelectronic inelastic scattering technique is shown to provide results\ncomparable to those obtained from non resonant X-ray inelastic scattering. Both\ntechniques are complementary: X-ray scattering is more accurate at large q wave\nvector whereas electron spectroscopy is more accurate at low q and is an\nattractive tool to study excitonic effects, which are inaccessible by optical\ntechniques.

Our goal is to use the\ninformation potentially available in the covariates to increase power compared\nto conventional procedures that only use the $P_i$, while controlling the false\ndiscovery rate (FDR). To this end, we recently introduced independent\nhypothesis weighting (IHW), a weighted Benjamini-Hochberg method, in which the\nweights are chosen as a function of the covariate $X_i$ in a data-driven\nmanner. We showed empirically in simulations and datasets from genomics and\nproteomics that IHW leads to a large power increase, while controlling the FDR.\nThe key idea was to use hypothesis splitting to learn the weight-covariate\nfunction without overfitting. In this paper, we provide a survey of IHW and\nrelated approaches by presenting them under the lens of the two-groups model,\nwhen it is valid conditionally on a covariate. Furthermore, a slightly modified\nvariant of IHW is proposed and shown to enjoy finite sample FDR control. The\nsame ideas can also be applied for finite-sample control of the family-wise\nerror rate (FWER) via IHW-Bonferroni.\n"]}]
