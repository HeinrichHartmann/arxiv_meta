Consider an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$\nvertices, and define (for $s > 0$) $\\mu_s = \\frac{1}{n}\\cdot\\sum_{v \\in V}\nd^s_v$. Our aim is to estimate $\\mu_s$ within a multiplicative error of\n$(1+\\epsilon)$ (for a given approximation parameter $\\epsilon>0$) in sublinear\ntime. We consider the sparse graph model that allows access to: uniform random\nvertices, queries for the degree of any vertex, and queries for a neighbor of\nany vertex. For the case of $s=1$ (the average degree),\n$\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ queries suffice for any constant $\\epsilon$ (Feige,\nSICOMP 06 and Goldreich-Ron, RSA 08). Gonen-Ron-Shavitt (SIDMA 11) extended\nthis result to all integral $s > 0$, by designing an algorithms that performs\n$\\widetilde{O}(n^{1-1/(s+1)})$ queries.\n  We design a new, significantly simpler algorithm for this problem. In the\nworst-case, it exactly matches the bounds of Gonen-Ron-Shavitt, and has a much\nsimpler proof. More importantly, the running time of this algorithm is\nconnected to the degeneracy of $G$.

Thus, for the class of bounded\ndegeneracy graphs (which includes all minor closed families and preferential\nattachment graphs), we can estimate the average degree in $\\widetilde{O}(1)$\nqueries, and can estimate the variance of the degree distribution in\n$\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ queries.

Then we investigate the detachment of\nthe imprinted spin textures from the underneath of the nanodisk, as well as its\ntransport by the spin-transfer torque imposed by spin-polarized current pulses\napplied in the nanotrack. A prominent feature of the moving imprinted spin\ntexture is that its topological number Q is oscillating around the averaged\nvalue of Q=0 as if it is a resonant state between the skyrmions with Q= +/- 1\nand the bubble with Q=0. We may call it a resonant magnetic soliton (RMS). A\nRMS moves along a straight line since it is free from the skyrmion Hall effect.\nIn our studied device, the same electrodes are employed to realize the\nimprinted spin texture detachment and its transport.

The neural enquirer typically\nnecessitates multiple steps of execution because of the compositionality of\nqueries. In previous studies, researchers have developed either distributed\nenquirers or symbolic ones for table querying. The distributed enquirer is\nend-to-end learnable, but is weak in terms of execution efficiency and explicit\ninterpretability. The symbolic enqurier, on the contrary, is efficient during\nexecution; but it is very difficult to train especially at initial stages. In\nthis paper, we propose to couple distributed and symbolic execution for natural\nlanguage queries. The observation is that a fully distributed executor also\nexhibits meaningful, albeit imperfect, interpretation. We can thus pretrain the\nsymbolic executor with the distributed one's intermediate execution results in\na step-by-step fashion. Experiments show that our approach significantly\noutperforms either the distributed or symbolic executor; moreover, we have\nrecovered more than 80% execution sequences with only groundtruth denotations\nduring training.

In the present paper, the heuristic approach introduced in\n(Athanassoulis & Belibassakis 1999, J. Fluid Mech. 389, 275-301) is generalized\nand justified. It is proved that an appropriately enhanced series expansion\nbecomes an exact, rapidly-convergent representation of the field $\\Phi$, valid\nfor any smooth, nonplanar boundaries and any smooth enough $\\Phi$. This series\nexpansion can be differentiated termwise everywhere in the domain, including\nthe boundaries, implementing an exact semi-separation of variables for\nnon-separable domains. The efficiency of the method is illustrated by solving a\nboundary value problem for the Laplace equation, and computing the\ncorresponding Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, involved in Hamiltonian equations\nfor nonlinear water waves. The present method provides accurate results with\nonly a few modes for quite general domains. Extensions to general waveguides\nare also discussed.\n","Comment: 24 pages plus five appendices (23 pages); 5 figures plus 2 figures in\n  appendix E"]}]

This work presents an unsupervised method for assessing similarity\nin bipartite data. Similar to some co-clustering methods, the method is based\non regular equivalence in graphs. The algorithm uses spectral properties of a\nbipartite adjacency matrix to estimate similarity in both dimensions. The\nmethod is reflexive in that similarity in one dimension is used to inform\nsimilarity in the other. Reflexive regular equivalence can also use the\nstructure of transitivities -- in a network sense -- the contribution of which\nis controlled by the algorithm's only free-parameter, $\\alpha$. The method is\ncompletely unsupervised and can be used to validate assumptions of\nco-similarity, which are required but often untested, in co-clustering\nanalyses. Three variants of the method with different normalizations are tested\non synthetic data. The method is found to be robust to noise and well-suited to\nasymmetric co-similar structure, making it particularly informative for cluster\nanalysis and recommendation in bipartite data of unknown structure. In\nexperiments, the convergence and speed of the algorithm are found to be stable\nfor different levels of noise. Real-world data from a network of malaria genes\nare analyzed, where the similarity produced by the reflexive method is shown to\nout-perform other measures' ability to correctly classify genes.\n","Comment: A condensed version of this paper will appear in Proceedings of the\n  30th Canadian Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Edmonton, Alberta,\n  Canada"]}]

Alvarez and A. Macovski, Phys.

The method then computes\nthe line integrals of the basis set coefficient from measurements with\ndifferent x-ray spectra. This paper shows that the transformation from photon\ncounting detector data with pileup to the line integrals can become\nill-conditioned under some circumstances leading to highly increased noise.\nMethods: An idealized model that includes pileup and quantum noise is used. The\nnoise variance of the line integral estimates is computed using the\nCram{\\`e}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB). The CRLB is computed as a function of object\nthickness for photon counting detector data with three and four bin pulse\nheight analysis (PHA) and low and high pileup. Results: With four bin PHA data\nthe transformation is well conditioned with either high or low pileup. With\nthree bin PHA and high pileup, the transformation becomes ill-conditioned for\nspecific values of object attenuation. At these values the CRLB variance\nincreases by approximately 10 5 compared with the four bin PHA or low pileup\nresults. The condition number of the forward transformation matrix also shows a\nspike at those attenuation values.

A metallic phase and a new insulating phase are successively\nobserved at room temperature as the doping concentration increases. It is\nsuggested that the polarized charges from doped hydrogens play an important\nrole. These charges gradually occupy V3d-O2p hybridized orbitals and\nconsequently modulate the filling of the VO2 crystal conduction band-edge\nstates, which eventually evolve into new valence band-edge states. This\ndemonstrates the exceptional sensitivity of VO2 electronic properties to\nelectron concentration and orbital occupancy, providing key information for the\nphase transition mechanism.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Our work adds to recent efforts to model very\nmassive clusters towards the approaching launch of the James Webb Space\nTelescope, in order to identify the most useful cosmic lenses for studying the\nearly Universe. Spectroscopic redshifts for the multiply-imaged galaxies and\nadditional HST data will be useful for refining the lens model and verifying\nthe nature of the $z\\sim7$ dropout.\n","Comment: Submitted; 8 pages, 5 figures, 1 table; comments welcome"]}]

One of the most frequently used radial functions\nis called shifted surface spline, introduced by Dyn, Levin and Rippa in\n\\cite{Dy1} for $R^{2}$. Then it's extended to $R^{n}$ for $n\\geq 1$. Many\narticles have studied its properties, as can be seen in\n\\cite{Bu,Du,Dy2,Po,Ri,Yo1,Yo2,Yo3,Yo4}. When dealing with this function, the\nmost commonly used error bounds are the one raised by Wu and Schaback in\n\\cite{WS}, and the one raised by Madych and Nelson in \\cite{MN2}. Both are\n$O(d^{l})$ as $d\\to 0$, where $l$ is a positive integer and $d$ is the\nfill-distance. In this paper we present an improved error bound which is\n$O(\\omega^{1/d})$ as $d\\to 0$, where $0<\\omega <1$ is a constant which can be\naccurately calculated.\n","Comment: 14 pages, radial basis functions, approximation theory. arXiv admin\n  note: text overlap with arXiv:math/0601158"]}]
