The link is established via weighted projective lines and (stable)\ncategories of vector bundles on those. The setup yields a new approach to\nattack the subspace problem. In particular, we deduce the main results of\nRingel and Schmidmeier for nilpotency degree p from properties of the category\nof vector bundles on the weighted projective line of weight type (2,3,p),\nobtained by Serre construction from the triangle singularity x^2+y^3+z^p. For\np=6 the Ringel-Schmidmeier classification is thus covered by the classification\nof vector bundles for tubular type (2,3,6), and then is closely related to\nAtiyah's classification of vector bundles on a smooth elliptic curve. Returning\nto the general case, we establish that the stable categories associated to\nvector bundles or invariant subspaces of nilpotent operators may be naturally\nidentified as triangulated categories. They satisfy Serre duality and also have\ntilting objects whose endomorphism rings play a role in singularity theory. In\nfact, we thus obtain a whole sequence of triangulated (fractional) Calabi-Yau\ncategories, indexed by p, which naturally form an ADE-chain.\n","Comment: More details added. 33 pages"]}]

Despite substantial progress, existing\nimplementations are not yet practical. The main bottleneck is typically the\nextra effort required by the prover to return an answer with a guarantee of\ncorrectness, compared to returning an answer with no guarantee.\n  We describe a refinement of a powerful interactive proof protocol originally\ndue to Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum.

We then algebraically characterize the expressive power of this logic,\nusing a new syntactic congruence for cost functions introduced in this paper.\n","Comment: 37 pages, 13 figures, accepted to LMCS, updated version 08/02/2017"]}]

Using the 'field\ngalaxy' stellar mass function from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the\nhalo mass function from the $\\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter Bolshoi simulation, we\nfind remarkable agreement between the two. This holds down to $M_{200} \\sim 5\n\\times 10^9$M$_\\odot$, and to $M_{200} \\sim 5 \\times 10^8$M$_\\odot$ if we\nassume a power law extrapolation of the SDSS stellar mass function below $M_*\n\\sim 10^7$M$_\\odot$.\n  However, if instead of SDSS we use the stellar mass function of nearby galaxy\ngroups, then the agreement is poor. This occurs because the group stellar mass\nfunction is shallower than that of the field below $M_* \\sim 10^9$M$_\\odot$,\nrecovering the familiar 'missing satellites' and 'too big to fail' problems.\nOur result demonstrates that both problems are confined to group environments\nand must, therefore, owe to 'galaxy formation physics' rather than exotic\ncosmology.\n  Finally, we repeat our analysis for a $\\Lambda$ Warm Dark Matter cosmology,\nfinding that it fails at 68% confidence for a thermal relic mass of $m_{\\rm\nWDM} < 1.25$keV, and $m_{\\rm WDM} < 2$keV if we use the power law extrapolation\nof SDSS.

This error can relate to\nmisleading results;specifically, inaccurate topic descriptions and a reduction\nin the efficacy of text mining classification results. Objective: To provide a\nmethod in which distributions generated by LDA are more stable and can be used\nfor further analysis. Method: We use LDADE, a search-based software engineering\ntool that tunes LDA's parameters using DE (Differential Evolution). LDADE is\nevaluated on data from a programmer information exchange site (Stackoverflow),\ntitle and abstract text of thousands ofSoftware Engineering (SE) papers, and\nsoftware defect reports from NASA.

Such systems require comb operation in low-noise, phase-coherent\nstates such as solitons, with broad spectral bandwidths (e.g., octave-spanning)\nfor self-referencing to detect the carrier-envelope offset frequency. However,\nstably accessing such states is complicated by thermo-optic dispersion. For\nexample, in the Si3N4 platform, precisely dispersion-engineered structures can\nsupport broadband operation, but microsecond thermal time constants have\nnecessitated fast pump power or frequency control to stabilize the solitons. In\ncontrast, here we consider how broadband soliton states can be accessed with\nsimple pump laser frequency tuning, at a rate much slower than the thermal\ndynamics. We demonstrate octave-spanning soliton frequency combs in Si3N4\nmicroresonators, including the generation of a multi-soliton state with a pump\npower near 40 mW and a single-soliton state with a pump power near 120 mW. We\nalso develop a simplified two-step analysis to explain how these states are\naccessed in a thermally stable way without fast control of the pump laser, and\noutline the required thermal properties for such operation. Our model agrees\nwith experimental results as well as numerical simulations based on a\nLugiato-Lefever equation that incorporates thermo-optic dispersion.

However, enforcing this strict guarantee\nin practice significantly distorts data and/or limits data uses, thus\ndiminishing the analytical utility of the differentially private results. In an\nattempt to address this shortcoming, several relaxations of differential\nprivacy have been proposed that trade off privacy guarantees for improved data\nutility. In this work, we argue that the standard formalization of differential\nprivacy is stricter than required by the intuitive privacy guarantee it seeks.\nIn particular, the standard formalization requires indistinguishability of\nresults between any pair of neighbor data sets, while indistinguishability\nbetween the actual data set and its neighbor data sets should be enough.

In this respect, we\npropose individual differential privacy, an alternative differential privacy\nnotion that offers em the same privacy guarantees as standard differential\nprivacy to individuals (even though not to groups of individuals). This new\nnotion allows the data controller to adjust the distortion to the actual data\nset, which results in less distortion and more analytical accuracy.

These persistent charge carriers seem to originate\nfrom oxygen vacancies that are trapped at the structural domain boundaries\nwhich develop below the so-called antiferrodistortive transition at T* = 105 K.\nThis is most evident from a corresponding photo-doping study of the DC\ntransport in STO (110) crystals for which the concentration of these domain\nboundaries can be modified by applying a weak uniaxial stress. The oxygen\nvacancies and their trapping by defects are also the source of the electrons\nthat are confined to the interface of LAO/STO (110) heterostructures which\nlikely do not have a polar discontinuity as in LAO/STO (001). In the former,\nthe trapping and clustering of the oxygen vacancies also has a strong influence\non the anisotropy of the charge carrier mobility. We show that this anisotropy\ncan be readily varied and even inverted by various means, such as a gentle\nthermal treatment, UV irradiation, or even a weak uniaxial stress. Our\nexperiments suggest that extended defects, which develop over long time periods\n(of weeks to months), can strongly influence the response of the confined\ncharge carriers at the LAO/STO (110) interface.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables"]}]

In this `many-seeds' model, the\nsolids-to-gas ratio interior to the snowline is enhanced as well, but not as\nmuch as just outside the snowline. In the context of a viscous disk, the\ndiffusion-condensation mechanism is most effective for high values of the\nturbulence parameter $\\alpha$ ($10^{-3}$--$10^{-2}$). Therefore, assuming young\ndisks are more vigorously turbulent than older disks, planetesimals near the\nsnowline can form in an early stage of the disk. In highly turbulent disks,\ntens of Earth masses can be stored in an annulus outside the snowline, which\ncan be identified with recent ALMA observations.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 11 figures; abstract abridged to meet arXiv requirements.\n  Accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

The proposed generative model is uniform in the space of\nanatomically valid poses and as a result, does not suffer from the dataset bias\nin existing motion capture datasets such as Human3.6M (H36M), HumanEva, and CMU\nMoCap. A good model that spans the full variability of human pose and\ngeneralizes to unseen poses must be compositional i.e., produce a pose by\ncombining parts. Our model is flexible and compositional and consequently can\ngeneralize to every plausible human 3D pose since it is only limited by\nphysical constraints. We discuss sampling from this model and use these samples\nto generate multiple diverse human 3D pose hypotheses given the 2D detection of\njoints. We argue that generating multiple pose hypotheses from a monocular RGB\nimage is more reasonable than generating only a single 3D pose given the depth\nambiguity and the uncertainty caused by occlusion and imperfect 2D joint\ndetection. To support this argument, we have performed empirical evaluation on\nthe popular Human3.6M dataset that confirms that most often, at least one of\nour pose hypotheses is closer to the true 3D pose compared to the estimated\npose by other recent baseline methods for 3D pose reconstruction from monocular\nRGB images.

In many cases, the dependence of\ndensity and spatial variation of electronic and optical device states on the\npoint of operation is modest and the reciprocity relation holds. In\nnanostructure-based photovoltaic devices exploiting confined modes, however,\nthe underlying assumptions are no longer justifiable. In the case of ultrathin\nabsorber solar cells, the modification of the electronic structure with applied\nbias is significant due to the large variation of the built-in field.\nStraightforward use of the external quantum efficiency as measured at short\ncircuit conditions in the photovoltaic reciprocity theory thus fails to\nreproduce the electroluminescence spectrum at large forward bias voltage.
