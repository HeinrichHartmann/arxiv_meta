(ii) Demixing\ntransitions are weakly affected, with small shifts in the $\\mu_1-\\mu_2$\n(chemical potentials) plane. (iii) Confinement-induced layering (CIL)\ntransitions occurring in the two confined one-component fluids in some cases\nmerge with the demixing transition. (iv) Surface-induced layering (SIL)\ntransitions occurring at a single surface as coexistence conditions are\napproached are also shifted in the confined fluid.

The interpretation of polarised radiation emerging from a planetary\natmosphere must rely on solutions to the vector Radiative Transport Equation\n(vRTE). Monte Carlo integration of the vRTE is a valuable approach for its\nflexible treatment of complex viewing and/or illumination geometries and\nbecause it can intuitively incorporate elaborate physics. Aims. We present a\nnovel Pre-Conditioned Backward Monte Carlo (PBMC) algorithm for solving the\nvRTE and apply it to planetary atmospheres irradiated from above. As classical\nBMC methods, our PBMC algorithm builds the solution by simulating the photon\ntrajectories from the detector towards the radiation source, i.e. in the\nreverse order of the actual photon displacements. Methods. We show that the\nneglect of polarisation in the sampling of photon propagation directions in\nclassical BMC algorithms leads to unstable and biased solutions for\nconservative, optically-thick, strongly-polarising media such as Rayleigh\natmospheres. The numerical difficulty is avoided by pre-conditioning the\nscattering matrix with information from the scattering matrices of prior (in\nthe BMC integration order) photon collisions. Pre-conditioning introduces a\nsense of history in the photon polarisation states through the simulated\ntrajectories. Results. The PBMC algorithm is robust and its accuracy is\nextensively demonstrated via comparisons with examples drawn from the\nliterature for scattering in diverse media. Since the convergence rate for MC\nintegration is independent of the integral's dimension, the scheme is a\nvaluable option for estimating the disk-integrated signal of stellar radiation\nreflected from planets.

To investigate the\npotential of spectroscopic surveys to follow up high-redshift galaxy\nclusters/groups observed in X-ray surveys for the identifications and mass\ncalibrations, we carried out Monte-Carlo re-sampling of the cluster galaxy\nredshifts and calibrated the uncertainties of the redshift and dynamical mass\nestimates when only reduced numbers of galaxy redshifts per cluster are\navailable.

Polarization parameters suffer from bias in the\npresence of measurement noise. It is critical to take into account all the\ninformation available in the data in order to accurately derive these\nparameters. The goal of this paper is to characterize the bias on the\npolarization angle dispersion function that is used to study the spatial\ncoherence of the polarization angle. We characterize, for the first time, the\nbias on the conventional estimator of the polarization angle dispersion\nfunction (S hereafter) and show that it can be positive or negative depending\non the true value. Monte Carlo simulations are performed in order to explore\nthe impact of the noise properties of the polarization data, as well as the\nimpact of the distribution of the true polarization angles on the bias. We show\nthat in the case where the ellipticity of the noise in (Q, U) varies by less\nthan 10 percent, one can use simplified, diagonal approximation of the noise\ncovariance matrix. In other cases, the shape of the noise covariance matrix\nshould be taken into account in the estimation of S. We also study new\nestimators such as the dichotomic and the polynomial estimators. Though the\ndichotomic estimator cannot be directly used to estimate S, we show that, on\nthe one hand, it can serve as an indicator of the accuracy of the conventional\nestimator and, on the other hand, it can be used for deriving the polynomial\nestimator. We propose a method for determining the upper limit of the bias on\nthe conventional estimator of S.

In this work, the\nrobustness of N2H+ as a tracer of the CO snowline is investigated. A simple\nchemical network is used in combination with the radiative transfer code LIME\nto model the N2H+ distribution and corresponding emission in the disk around TW\nHya. The assumed CO and N2 abundances, corresponding binding energies, cosmic\nray ionization rate, and degree of large-grain settling are varied to determine\nthe effects on the N2H+ emission and its relation to the CO snowline. For the\nadopted physical structure of the TW Hya disk and molecular binding energies\nfor pure ices, the balance between freeze-out and thermal desorption predicts a\nCO snowline at 19 AU, corresponding to a CO midplane freeze-out temperature of\n20 K. A model with a total, i.e. gas plus ice, CO abundance of 3e-6 with\nrespect to H2 fits the position of the emission peak observed by Qi et al. 2013\nfor the TW Hya disk. However, the relationship between N2H+ and the CO snowline\nis more complicated than generally assumed: for the investigated parameters,\nthe N2H+ column density peaks at least 5 AU outside the CO snowline. Moreover,\nthe N2H+ emission can peak much further out, as far as ~50 AU beyond the\nsnowline. Hence, chemical modeling, as done here, is necessary to derive a CO\nsnowline location from N2H+ observations.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 3 tables, 15 figures. Accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

This is in part due to a lack of reliable oxygen abundance indicators in\nthe metal-poor stars, in part due to shortcomings in 1D LTE abundance analyses.\nIn this study we determined the oxygen abundance in the metal-poor halo giant\nHD 122563 using a 3D hydrodynamical CO5BOLD model atmosphere. Our main goal was\nto understand whether a 3D LTE analysis may help to improve the reliability of\noxygen abundances determined from OH UV lines in comparison to those obtained\nusing standard 1D LTE methodology. The oxygen abundance in HD 122563 was\ndetermined using 71 OH UV lines located in the wavelength range between 308-330\nnm. The analysis was done using a high-resolution VLT UVES spectrum with a 1D\nLTE spectral line synthesis performed using the SYNTHE package and classical\nATLAS9 model atmosphere. Subsequently, a 3D hydrodynamical CO5BOLD, and 1D\nhydrostatic LHD model atmospheres were used in order to compute 3D-1D abundance\ncorrections. For this, the microturbulence velocity used with the 1D LHD model\natmosphere was derived from the hydrodynamical CO5BOLD model atmosphere. As in\nprevious studies, we found trends of the 1D LTE oxygen abundances determined\nfrom OH UV lines with line parameters, such as the line excitation potential\nand the line strength. These trends become significantly less pronounced in 3D\nLTE. Using OH UV lines we determined a 3D LTE oxygen abundance in HD 122563 of\nA(O) = 6.23 +/- 0.13. This is in fair agreement with the oxygen abundance\nobtained from OH IR lines, A(O) = 6.39 +/- 0.11, but it is noticeably lower\nthan that determined using the forbidden [OI] line, A(O) = 6.53 +/- 0.15. While\nthe exact cause for this discrepancy remains unclear, it is very likely that\nnon-LTE effects may play a decisive role here.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 13 figures, 6 tables.

Two- and three-dimensional hydrodynamic\nsimulations demonstrated that this gravitational tug-boat mechanism can explain\nthe observed space velocities of young NSs up to more than 1000 km/s.

We first discussed the connection between the decrement types\nand the source properties and then compared the observed decrements with\npredictions from recently published local line excitation models. One third of\nthe objects show lines with narrow symmetric profiles, and present similar\nBalmer and Paschen decrements (straight decrements, types 2 and A). Lines in\nthese sources are consistent with optically thin emission from gas with\nhydrogen densities of order 10^9 cm^-3 and 5000<T<15000 K. These objects are\nassociated with low mass accretion rates. Type 4 (L-shaped) Balmer and type B\nPaschen decrements are found in conjunction with very wide line profiles and\nare characteristic of strong accretors, with optically thick emission from\nhigh-density gas (log n_H > 11 cm^-3). Type 1 (curved) Balmer decrements are\nobserved only in three sub-luminous sources viewed edge-on, so we speculate\nthat these are actually reddened type 2 decrements.

We develop a system based upon\nthese information content methods to trace the instrumental and atmospheric\nmodel phase space in order to identify which observing modes are best suited\nfor particular classes of planets, focusing on transmission spectra.\nSpecifically, the atmospheric parameter space we cover is T=600-1800 K,\nC/O=0.55-1, [M/H]=1-100$\\times$Solar for a R=1.39 R$_J$, M=0.59 M$_J$ planet\norbiting WASP-62-like star. We find that obtaining broader wavelength coverage\nover multiple modes is preferred over higher precision in a single mode given\nthe same amount of observing time. Regardless of the planet temperature and\ncomposition, the best modes for constraining terminator temperatures, C/O\nratios, and metalicity are NIRISS SOSS+NIRSpec G395. If the target's host star\nis dim enough such that the NIRSpec prism can be used, then it cam be used\ninstead of NIRISS SOSS+NIRSpec G395. Lastly, observations that use more than\ntwo modes, should be carefully analyzed because sometimes the addition of a\nthird mode results in no gain of information. In these cases, higher precision\nin the original two modes is favorable.\n","Comment: 9 figures, 1 table, accepted ApJ"]}]

We have examined over 800 nights of high-precision photometry\nof the multiperiodic pulsator 4 CVn obtained from 1966 through 2012.

Most pulsation modes\nshow systematic significant period and amplitude changes on a timescale of\ndecades. For the well-studied modes, around 1986 a general reversal of the\ndirections of both the positive and negative period changes occurred.\nFurthermore, the period changes between the different modes are strongly\ncorrelated, although they differ in size and sign. For the modes with known\nvalues of the spherical degree and azimuthal order, we find a correlation\nbetween the direction of the period changes and the identified azimuthal order,\nm. The associated amplitude changes generally have similar timescales of years\nor decades, but show little systematic or correlated behavior from mode to\nmode. A natural explanation for the opposite behavior of the prograde and\nretrograde modes is that their period changes are driven by a changing rotation\nprofile. The changes in the rotation profile could in turn be driven by\nprocesses, perhaps the pulsations themselves, that redistribute angular\nmomentum within the star.

Although the\nflux surfaces and therefore also the equilibria have a 2D character, these\nstationary MHD states depend on all three coordinates and display highly\ncomplex currents. The existence of geometrically complex 3D currents within\nsymmetric field-line structures provide the base for efficient dissipation of\nthe magnetic energy in the solar corona by Ohmic heating. We also discuss the\npossibility of maintaining an important subset of non-linear MHS states, namely\nforce-free fields, by stationary flows. We find that force-free fields with\nnon-linear flows only arise under severe restrictions of the field-line\ngeometry and of the magnetic flux density distribution.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 5 figures, accepted to ApJ"]}]
