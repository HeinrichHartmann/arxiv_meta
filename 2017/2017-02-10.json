The obtained insights further motivate the\ndevelopment of several modifications to improve the pathwise coordinate\noptimization framework, which guarantees linear convergence to a unique sparse\nlocal optimum with optimal statistical properties in parameter estimation and\nsupport recovery. This is the first result on the computational and statistical\nguarantees of the pathwise coordinate optimization framework in high\ndimensions. Thorough numerical experiments are provided to support our theory.\n","Comment: Accepted by the Annals of Statistics, 2016+"]}]

Gelman et al. (2008) recommended independent Cauchy\ndistributions as default priors for the regression coefficients in logistic\nregression, even in the case of separation, and reported posterior modes in\ntheir analyses. As the mean does not exist for the Cauchy prior, a natural\nquestion is whether the posterior means of the regression coefficients exist\nunder separation. We prove theorems that provide necessary and sufficient\nconditions for the existence of posterior means under independent Cauchy priors\nfor the logit link and a general family of link functions, including the probit\nlink. We also study the existence of posterior means under multivariate Cauchy\npriors.

We show that for\nthe amplitude damping channel the evolved total QC can be written as the sum of\nlocal and non-local parts, with the last one being equal to entanglement. On\nthe other hand, for the phase damping channel (PDC) entanglement does not\naccount for all non-local QC, with the gap between them depending on time and\nalso on the qubit's initial state. Besides these issues, the possibility and\nconditions for time invariance of QC are regarded in the case of bit, phase,\nand bit-phase flip channels. Here we reveal the qualitative dynamical\ninequivalence between these channels and the PDC and show that the creation of\nsystem-environment entanglement does not necessarily imply in the destruction\nof the qubit's QC. We also investigate the resources needed for non-local QC\ncreation, showing that while the PDC requires initial coherence of the qubit,\nfor some other channels non-zero population of the excited state (i.e., energy)\nis sufficient.

To achieve this objective, intrusion detection\nsystems (IDS) that are able to detect malicious behavior can be deployed.\nHowever, practical IDS are imperfect and sometimes they may produce false\nalarms for a normal system behavior. Since alarms need to be investigated for\nany potential damage, a large number of false alarms may increase the\noperational costs significantly. Thus, IDS need to be configured properly, as\noversensitive IDS could detect attacks early but at the cost of a higher number\nof false alarms. Similarly, IDS with low sensitivity could reduce the false\nalarms while increasing the time to detect the attacks. The configuration of\nIDS to strike the right balance between time to detecting attacks and the rate\nof false positives is a challenging task, especially in dynamic environments,\nin which the damage incurred by a successful attack is time-varying.\n  In this paper, we study the problem of finding optimal detection thresholds\nfor anomaly-based detectors implemented in dynamical systems in the face of\nstrategic attacks. We formulate the problem as an attacker-defender security\ngame, and determine thresholds for the detector to achieve an optimal trade-off\nbetween the detection delay and the false positive rates. In this direction,\nfirst, we provide an algorithm that computes optimal fixed threshold that\nremains fixed throughout. Second, we allow detector's threshold to change with\ntime to further minimize the defender's loss and provide an algorithm to\ncompute time-varying thresholds, which we call adaptive thresholds.

It is a general name\nfor any of several computationally-feasible approximations to the generally\nNP-Hard Strict Minimum Message Length (SMML) estimator. One often-cited\nshowcase for the power of MML is the Neyman-Scott estimation problem, where\nmost popular estimation algorithms fail to produce a consistent result. MML's\nperformance on Neyman-Scott was analysed by Dowe and Wallace (1997) and by\nWallace (2005) and MML was shown to be consistent for the problem. However,\nthis analysis was not performed on SMML, but rather on two SMML approximations:\nWallace-Freeman and Ideal Group. As for most estimation problems, the exact\nSMML solution is not known for Neyman-Scott. We analyse the Dowe-Wallace\nsolution, and show that it hinges critically on the use of an unnatural prior\nfor the problem. We argue that the Jeffreys prior is a more natural prior to\nassume in this case. Re-analysing the problem over its Jeffreys prior, we show\nthat both the Ideal Group and the Wallace-Freeman approximations converge to\nthe (inconsistent) Maximum Likelihood (ML) solution. We develop novel\ntechniques that enable determining properties of the SMML estimator for some\ngeneral families of estimation problems without requiring a full construction\nof the estimator, and use these to show that for many problems, including\nNeyman-Scott, the SMML estimator is not a point-estimator at all. Rather, it\nmaps each observation to an entire continuum of estimates. Furthermore, using\nthe tools developed we show that for Neyman-Scott the SMML estimate is\ninconsistent for all parameter sets as well as asymptotically. We discuss\nmethodological problems in the arguments put forward by previous authors, who\nargued that MML is consistent for Neyman-Scott and in general.\n","Comment: 50 pages, 0 figures"]}]

Furthermore, consistent with low-redshift studies,\nwe find that the probability of hosting an AGN in the total galaxy population\ncan be characterized by a universal Eddington ratio ($p(\\lambda_{Edd}) \\sim\n\\lambda_{Edd}^{-0.4}$) and a moderate redshift evolution. Yet consistent with\ntheir different AGN fractions, different populations appear to also have\ndifferent $p(\\lambda_{Edd})$ with red galaxies exhibiting more rapid redshift\nevolution than green and blue ones. Evidence for a steeper power law of\n$p(\\lambda_{Edd})$ in red galaxies is also presented, though larger samples are\nneeded to confirm. These results suggest that the AGN accretion or the growth\nof supermassive black holes is related to their host properties, and may also\ninfluence their hosts in a different mode dependent on the host color.\n","Comment: A&A, in press"]}]

A novel Multichannel Immediate Multiple Access (MIMA)\nphysical layer is developed such that each SU can monitor all the channels\nsimultaneously for incoming signals and achieve fast rendezvous within the\nmultiple channels. The spectrum utilized by an SU pair can be changed\ndynamically based upon spectrum sensing at the transmitter and tracking\nsynchronization and control messages at the receiver.

We find a qualitative and quantitative agreement over both a wide range\nof temperatures and carrier concentrations, from light to heavily doped.\nMoreover, the results appear insensitive to the nature of the dopant La, B, Gd\nand Nb. Thus, the quantitative success found in the case of SrTiO3, reveals an\nefficient procedure to explore new routes to improve the thermoelectric\nproperties in oxides.\n","Comment: 5 figures, manuscript submitted"]}]

We then analytically derive the\nresulting capacity of such a small cell network by accounting for the channel\ncharacteristics unique to both these spectrum bands, relative distance and the\ncontact times between a given transceiver pair. We then formulate the optimal\nprocedure for scheduling multiple vehicles at a given infrastructure tower,\nwith regards to practical road congestion scenarios. The search for the optimal\nschedule is shown to be a NP-hard problem. Hence, we design a\ncomputationally-feasible polynomial-time scheduling algorithm that runs at the\nSDN controller and compare its performance against the optimal procedure and\nrandom access. Additionally, we present a simulation-based case study for the\nuse case of data center backhauling in Boston city to showcase the benefits of\nour approach.\n"]}]
