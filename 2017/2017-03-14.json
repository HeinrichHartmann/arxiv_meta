When the flux is convex, the\ncombination of diffusion and dispersion are known to give rise to monotonic and\noscillatory traveling waves that approximate shock waves. The zero-diffusion\nlimits of these traveling waves are dynamically expanding dispersive shock\nwaves (DSWs). A richer set of wave solutions can be found when the flux is\nnon-convex. This review compares the structure of solutions of Riemann problems\nfor a conservation law with non-convex, cubic flux regularized by two different\nmechanisms: 1) dispersion in the modified Korteweg--de Vries (mKdV) equation;\nand 2) a combination of diffusion and dispersion in the mKdV-Burgers equation.\nIn the first case, the possible dynamics involve two qualitatively different\ntypes of DSWs, rarefaction waves (RWs) and kinks (monotonic fronts). In the\nsecond case, in addition to RWs, there are traveling wave solutions\napproximating both classical (Lax) and non-classical (undercompressive) shock\nwaves. Despite the singular nature of the zero-diffusion limit and rather\ndiffering analytical approaches employed in the descriptions of dispersive and\ndiffusive-dispersive regularization, the resulting comparison of the two cases\nreveals a number of striking parallels. In contrast to the case of convex flux,\nthe mKdVB to mKdV mapping is not one-to-one. The mKdV kink solution is\nidentified as an undercompressive DSW. Other prominent features, such as\nshock-rarefactions, also find their purely dispersive counterparts involving\nspecial contact DSWs, which exhibit features analogous to contact\ndiscontinuities.

In order to make the problem tractable,\nparticular assumptions regarding the neural or synaptic parameters are usually\nmade.

In this regime, synaptic time\nconstants and refractory periods dominate membrane dynamics.\n  The core idea of our approach is to separately consider two different \"modes\"\nof spiking dynamics: burst spiking and transient quiescence, in which the\nneuron does not spike for longer periods. We treat the former by propagating\nthe PDF of the effective membrane potential from spike to spike within a burst,\nwhile using a diffusion approximation for the latter.

However, densifying the network with a viral\ndeployment of SBSs can significantly increase energy consumption. To reduce the\nreliance on unsustainable energy sources, one can adopt self-powered SBSs that\nrely solely on energy harvesting. Due to the uncertainty of energy arrival and\nthe finite capacity of energy storage systems, self-powered SBSs must smartly\noptimize their ON and OFF schedule. In this paper, the problem of ON/OFF\nscheduling of self-powered SBSs is studied, in the presence of energy\nharvesting uncertainty with the goal of minimizing the operational costs\nconsisted of energy consumption and transmission delay of a network. For the\noriginal problem, we show an algorithm can solve the problem in the\nillustrative case. To reduce the complexity of the original problem, an\napproximation is proposed. To solve the approximated problem, a novel approach\nbased on the ski rental framework, a powerful online optimization tool, is\nproposed. Using this approach, each SBS can effectively decide on its ON/OFF\nschedule autonomously, without any prior information on future energy arrivals.\nBy using competitive analysis, a deterministic online algorithm (DOA) and a\nrandomized online algorithm (ROA) are developed. ROA is shown to achieve the\noptimal competitive ratio in the approximation problem.

When a PDE (system) is\nvariational, multipliers correspond to symmetries of the variational principle,\nand the local divergence identity relating a multiplier to a conserved integral\nis the same as the variational identity used in Noether's theorem for\nconnecting conserved integrals to invariance of a variational principle. From\nthis viewpoint, the multiplier method is shown to constitute a modern form of\nNoether's theorem in which the variational principle is not used. When a PDE\n(system) is non-variational, multipliers are shown to be an adjoint counterpart\nto symmetries, and the local divergence identity relating a multiplier to a\nconserved integral is shown to be an adjoint generalization of the variational\nidentity underling Noether's theorem. Two main results are established for PDE\nsystems having a solved-form for leading derivatives, which encompasses all\ntypical PDEs of physical interest. First, all non-trivial conserved integrals\nare shown to arise from non-trivial multipliers in a one-to-one manner, taking\ninto account certain equivalence freedoms. Second, a scaling formula based on\ndimensional analysis is derived to obtain the conserved density and spatial\nflux in any conserved integral, just using the corresponding multiplier and the\ngiven PDE system. The derivations use a few basic tools from variational\ncalculus, for which a self-contained formulation is provided.\n","Comment: 51 pages. Revised version, with corrected examples.

One of the most\nimportant issues encountered when modeling bipartite networks is devising a way\nto obtain a (monopartite) projection on the layer of interest, which preserves\nthe information encoded into the original bipartite structure as much as\npossible. In the present paper we propose an algorithm to obtain\nstatistically-validated projections of bipartite networks, which implements a\nsimple rule: in order for any two nodes to be linked, the number of shared\nneighbors must be statistically significant. Naturally, assessing the\nstatistical significance of nodes similarity requires the definition of a\nproper statistical benchmark: here we consider a set of four null models,\ndefined within the Exponential Random Graph framework. Our algorithm outputs a\nmatrix of link-specific p-values, from which a validated projection can be\nstraightforwardly obtained, upon running a multiple hypothesis test and\nretaining only the statistically-significant links.

The authors conducted a series of experiments for\nvarious macro parameters of HTM SP, as well as for different levels of video\nreduction ratios.

Knowing the\ndistributions of their orbital parameters (OPs) is important for a wide range\nof topics, from stellar feedback to binary evolution channels, from the\ndistribution of supernova types to gravitational wave progenitors, yet, no\ndirect measurements exist outside the Milky Way. The Tarantula Massive Binary\nMonitoring was designed to help fill this gap by obtaining multi-epoch radial\nvelocity monitoring of 102 MBs in the 30 Dor. In this paper, we analyse 32\nVLT/FLAMES observations of 93 O- and 7 B-type binaries. We performed a Fourier\nanalysis and obtained orbital solutions for 82 systems: 51 single- and 31\ndouble-lined spectroscopic binaries. Overall, the OPs and binary fraction are\nremarkably similar across the 30 Dor region and compared to existing Galactic\nsamples (GSs). This indicates that within these domains environmental effects\nare of second order in shaping the properties of MBs. A small difference is\nfound in the distribution of orbital periods (OrbPs), which is slightly flatter\n(in log space) in 30 Dor than in the Galaxy, although this may be compatible\nwithin error estimates and differences in the fitting methodology. Also, OrbPs\nin 30 Dor can be as short as 1.1 d; somewhat shorter than seen in GSs. Equal\nmass binaries q>0.95 in 30 Dor are all found outside NGC 2070 the very young\nand massive cluster at 30 Dor's core. One outstanding exception however is the\nfact that earliest spectral types (O2-O7) tend to have shorter OrbPs than\nlatter (O9.2-O9.7). Our results point to a relative universality of the\nincidence rate of MBs and their OPs in the metallicity range from solar\n($Z_{\\odot}$) to about $0.5Z_{\\odot}$.

Here we show that\napplication of perpendicular electric and magnetic fields effects a tuneable\nartificial gauge potential for two-dimensional microcavity exciton polaritons.\nFor verification, we perform interferometric measurement of the associated\nphase accumulated during coherent polariton transport. Since the gauge\npotential originates from the magnetoelectric Stark effect, it can be realized\nfor photons strongly coupled to excitations in any polarizable medium. Together\nwith strong polariton- polariton interactions and engineered polariton\nlattices, artificial gauge fields could play a key role in investigation of\nnon-equilibrium dynamics of strongly correlated photons.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 3 figures.

Resonance\ncapture requires slow convergent migration of the planets, with sufficiently\nlarge eccentricity damping timescale $T_e$ and small pre-resonance\neccentricities. We quantify these requirements and find that they can be\nsatisfied for super-Earths under protoplanetary disk conditions. For planets\ncaptured into resonance, an equilibrium state can be reached, in which\neccentricity excitation due to resonant planet-planet interaction balances\neccentricity damping due to planet-disk interaction. We show that this\n\"captured\" equilibrium can be overstable, leading to partial or permanent\nescape of the planets from the resonance. In general, the stability of the\ncaptured state depends on the inner to outer planet mass ratio $q=m_1/m_2$ and\nthe ratio of the eccentricity damping times. The overstability growth time is\nof order $T_e$, but can be much larger for systems close to the stability\nthreshold. For low-mass planets undergoing type I (non-gap opening) migration,\nconvergent migration requires $q \\lesssim 1$, while the stability of the\ncapture requires $q\\gtrsim 1$. These results suggest that planet pairs stably\ncaptured into second-order MMRs have comparable masses. This is in contrast to\nfirst-order MMRs, where a larger parameter space exists for stable resonance\ncapture. We confirm and extend our analytical results with $N$-body\nsimulations, and show that for overstable capture, the escape time from the MMR\ncan be comparable to the time the planets spend migrating between resonances.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 17 figures"]}]

It contains\nall the necessary material for the generalization to come in part II, namely\nthe characterization of the signature of the metric in terms of a\ntime-orientation 1-form and a natural Krein product on spinor fields. It turns\nout that all the data available in Noncommutative Geometry (the algebra of\nfunctions, the Krein space of spinor fields, the representation of the algebra\non it, the Dirac operator, charge conjugation and chirality), but nothing more,\nplay a role in this characterization. Thus, only space and time oriented spin\nmanifolds of even dimension are considered for a noncommutative generalization\nin this approach. We observe that these are precisely the kind of manifolds on\nwhich the modern theories of spacetime and matter are defined.\n","Comment: The end of the proof of theorem 2 was fawlty.

This can be done in two ways: by comparing\narrival times of GWs and their EM counterparts and by comparing the time delays\nbetween images seen in GWs and their EM counterparts. The lensed GW-EM event is\nperhaps the best way to identify an EM counterpart. Conceptually, this method\ndoes not rely on any specific theory of massive gravitons or modified gravity.\nIts differential setting (i.e., measuring the difference between time delays in\nGW and EM domains) makes it robust against lens modeling details (photons and\nGWs travel in the same lensing potential) and against internal time delays\nbetween GW and EM emission acts. It requires, however, that the theory of\ngravity is metric and predicts gravitational lensing similar to general\nrelativity. We expect that such a test will become possible in the era of\nthird-generation gravitational-wave detectors, when about 10 lensed GW events\nwould be observed each year. The power of this method is mainly limited by the\ntiming accuracy of the EM counterpart, which for kilonovae is around $10^4$\ns.Thisuncertaintycanbesuppressedbya factor of $\\sim 10^{10}$, if strongly\nlensed transients of much shorter duration associated with the GW event can be\nidentified. Candidates for such short transients include short gamma-ray burst\nand fast radio bursts.\n","Comment: update refs based on PRL published version"]}]

In this paper we address\nthe problem with a modelling approach following three basic steps. We first\nintroduce a network morphogenesis model to reconstruct network structures where\nhomophily can be tuned with a parameter. We show that as homophily increases\nthe emergence of marked topological community structures in the networks\nraises. Secondly, we perform an opinion dynamics process on homophily dependent\nnetworks and we show that, contrary to the common idea, homophily helps\nconsensus formation. Finally, we introduce a tunable external media pressure\nand we show that, actually, the combination of homophily and media makes the\nmedia effect less effective and leads to strongly polarized opinion clusters.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 10 figures"]}]

In both simulations, gas loses on average\n$\\approx0.4$ dex between accreting onto halos and first accreting onto central\ngalaxies. In Illustris, this is followed by $\\approx0.2$ dex gains in the\n`galactic wind fountain' and no further net evolution past the final accretion\nonto the galaxy. Without feedback, further losses of $\\approx0.2$ dex occur in\nthe gas phase inside the galaxies themselves. An additional $\\approx0.15$ dex\ndifference arises due to feedback preferentially selecting gas with higher\nangular momentum at accretion by expelling gas that is poorly aligned. These\nand additional effects of similar magnitude are discussed, suggesting a complex\norigin to the close similarity between the specific angular momenta of galactic\ndisks and of typical halos.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 10 figures.

To build a large-scale quantum computer with\nSi QDs, we must address any dot-to-dot variations that can cause randomness in\nqubit operations. In this work, we identify the presence of monoatomic steps at\nthe Si/SiGe or Si/SiO$_2$ interface as a dominant source of variations in the\nelectron $g$-factors, which will cause qubit-to-qubit variability in the single\nqubit spin resonance frequencies. Using atomistc tight-binding calculations we\nshow that the Stark shift of the resonance frequencies, essential to\nselectively address individual spin qubits, also undergoes variations due to\nthese steps. We compare our theoretical predictions with experiments on QDs at\na Si/SiO$_2$ interface, in which we observe significant differences in Stark\nshifts between QDs in two different samples. We also experimentally observe\nvariations in the $g$-factors of one-electron and three-electron spin qubits\nrealized in three neighboring QDs on the same sample, at a level consistent\nwith our calculations. The dephasing times of these qubits also vary, most\nlikely due to their varying sensitivity to charge noise.

Some further\ndevelopments and mathematical challenges in this direction are also discussed.\n","Comment: 19 pages; 8 figures; accepted by Science China Mathematics on\n  February 2, 2017 (invited survey paper)"]}]

Only a few of them encode\nthe temporal information such as stage transition rules, which is important to\ncorrectly identify the next possible sleep stages, into the extracted features.\nIn the proposed model, we utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to\nextract time-invariant features, and bidirectional Long Short- Term Memory\n(bidirectional-LSTM) to learn transition rules among sleep stages from EEG\nepochs. We implement a two-step training algorithm that pre-trains the model\nwith oversampled dataset to alleviate class-imbalance problems and fine-tunes\nthe model with sequences of EEG epochs to encode the temporal information into\nthe model.

Similarly, each VR/AR application\nhas minimum reconstruction quality requirements for its own session. We propose\nan optimization framework that makes three contributions in this context.\nFirst, we select the optimal sampling rates to be used by each UAV, such that\nthe system and application constraints are not exceed, while the priority\nweighted reconstruction quality across all VR/AR sessions is maximized. Then,\nwe design an optimal scalable source-channel signal representation that\ninstills into the captured data inherent rate adaptivity, unequal error\nprotection, and minimum required redundancy. Finally, the UAV transmission\nefficiency is enhanced by the use of small-form-factor multi-beam directional\nantennas and optimal power/link scheduling across the scalable signal\nrepresentation layers. Our experiments demonstrate competitive advantages over\nconventional methods for visual sensing. This is a first-of-its-kind study of\nan emerging application of prospectively broad societal impact.\n","Comment: To appear @ INFOCOM 2017. Supported by NSF award CCF-1528030"]}]

To further broaden the use of ML models, cloud-based services\noffered by Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and others have developed ML-as-a-service\ntools as black-box systems. However, ML classifiers are vulnerable to\nadversarial examples: inputs that are maliciously modified can cause the\nclassifier to provide adversary-desired outputs. Moreover, it is known that\nadversarial examples generated on one classifier are likely to cause another\nclassifier to make the same mistake, even if the classifiers have different\narchitectures or are trained on disjoint datasets.

The worst-case number\nof movements of the generic strategy is $\\Omega(n^2)$.

Our results are not limited to\nstimulations of infinitesimal amplitude, but they apply as well to finite\namplitude post-synaptic potentials, thus being able to capture the effect of\nrare and large spikes.

Finally, as smart systems may\nwork in different dimensions of applications via internet or intranet\nconnectivity, the basic specifications of proposed CoT are presented.\nConsequently, due to nature of CoTs, a new multi- dimension multi-hierarchy\ncontrol strategy is proposed.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 8 figures,15 references"]}]

The current observational campaign was\nperformed with the Swift/XRT telescope in the soft X-ray band (0.5-10 keV)\nbetween two subsequent Type I outbursts in January and September 2016. The\nexpected transition to the propeller regime was not observed. However, the\ntransitions between different regimes of accretion were detected. In\nparticular, after an outburst the source entered a stable accretion state\ncharacterised by the accretion rate of ~10^14-10^15 g/s. We associate this\nstate with accretion from a cold (non-ionised) disc of temperature below ~6500\nK. We argue that a transition to such accretion regime should be observed in\nall X-ray pulsars with certain combination of the rotation frequency and\nmagnetic field strength. Moreover, the propeller effect should never be\nobserved in such sources even for very low mass accretion rates. The proposed\nmodel of accretion from a cold disc is able to explain several puzzling\nobservational properties of X-ray pulsars.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, submitted to A&A"]}]
