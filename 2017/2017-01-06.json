The\nresults show that the optimization of a utility estimate such as the\ncross-validation (CV) score is liable to finding overfitted models due to\nrelatively high variance in the utility estimates when the data is scarce. This\ncan also lead to substantial selection induced bias and optimism in the\nperformance evaluation for the selected model. From a predictive viewpoint,\nbest results are obtained by accounting for model uncertainty by forming the\nfull encompassing model, such as the Bayesian model averaging solution over the\ncandidate models. If the encompassing model is too complex, it can be robustly\nsimplified by the projection method, in which the information of the full model\nis projected onto the submodels. This approach is substantially less prone to\noverfitting than selection based on CV-score. Overall, the projection method\nappears to outperform also the maximum a posteriori model and the selection of\nthe most probable variables.

In\nthe resource theory of coherence free states are diagonal in some fixed basis,\nand free operations are those which cannot create coherence for some particular\nexperimental realization. Recently, some problems of this approach have been\ndiscussed, and new sets of operations have been proposed to resolve these\nproblems. We propose here the framework of genuine quantum coherence. This\napproach is based on a simple principle: we demand that a genuinely incoherent\noperation preserves all incoherent states.

We also introduce the full class of operations with\nthis property, which we call fully incoherent. We analyze in detail the\nmathematical structure of these classes and also study possible state\ntransformations. We show that deterministic manipulation is severely limited,\neven in the asymptotic settings. In particular, this framework does not have a\nunique golden unit, i.e., there is no single state from which all other states\ncan be created deterministically with the free operations. This suggests that\nany reasonably powerful resource theory of coherence must contain free\noperations which can potentially create coherence in some experimental\nrealization.\n","Comment: 21 pages, no figures, published version.

If H is an irreflexive bipartite graph or a\nreflexive complete graph then counting list H-colourings is trivially in\npolynomial time. Otherwise, if H is an irreflexive bipartite permutation graph\nor a reflexive proper interval graph then approximately counting list\nH-colourings is equivalent to #BIS, the problem of approximately counting\nindependent sets in a bipartite graph. This is a well-studied problem which is\nbelieved to be of intermediate complexity -- it is believed that it does not\nhave an FPRAS, but that it is not as difficult as approximating the most\ndifficult counting problems in #P. For every other graph H, approximately\ncounting list H-colourings is complete for #P with respect to\napproximation-preserving reductions (so there is no FPRAS unless NP=RP). Two\npleasing features of the trichotomy are (i) it has a natural formulation in\nterms of hereditary graph classes, and (ii) the proof is largely self-contained\nand does not require any universal algebra (unlike similar dichotomies in the\nweighted case).

Once the\nnetwork operates in this configuration, it performs efficiently on a specific\napplication both in terms of (i) low prediction error and (ii) high short-term\nmemory capacity. Since the behavior of recurrent networks is strongly\ninfluenced by the particular input signal driving the dynamics, a universal,\napplication-independent method for determining the edge of criticality is still\nmissing.

In our previous papers, we studied the least squares estimator\nand the projection estimator, where we proved the optimal convergence rates for\nthe least squares estimator in Schatten $p$-norms with $1\\leq p\\leq 2$ and,\nunder a stronger condition, the optimal convergence rates for the projection\nestimator in Schatten $p$-norms with $1\\leq p\\leq +\\infty$. In this paper, we\nshow that the results of these two distinct estimators can be simultaneously\nobtained by the Dantzig estimator. Moreover, better convergence rates in\nSchatten norm distances can be proved for Dantzig estimator under conditions\nweaker than those needed in previous papers. When the objective function of DE\nis replaced by the negative von Neumann entropy, we obtain sharp convergence\nrate in Kullback-Leibler divergence.\n","Comment: in Electronic Journal of Statistics, 2017"]}]

In\nthis article, we categorize these methods as \"image-source reversion\", which\nlocalizes the image source before finding the reflector position, and \"direct\nlocalization\", which localizes the reflector without intermediate steps. We\npresent five new contributions. First, an onset detector, called the clustered\ndynamic programming projected phase-slope algorithm, is proposed to\nautomatically extract the time of arrival for early reflections within the RIRs\nof a compact microphone array. Second, we propose an image-source reversion\nmethod that uses the RIRs from a single loudspeaker. It is constructed by\ncombining an image source locator (the image source direction and range (ISDAR)\nalgorithm), and a reflector locator (using the loudspeaker-image bisection\n(LIB) algorithm). Third, two variants of it, exploiting multiple loudspeakers,\nare proposed. Fourth, we present a direct localization method, the ellipsoid\ntangent sample consensus (ETSAC), exploiting ellipsoid properties to localize\nthe reflector. Finally, systematic experiments on simulated and measured RIRs\nare presented, comparing the proposed methods with the state-of-the-art.

A sequence of events\nincluding magnetic flux-rope instability and distortion, followed by filament\neruption and arcade implosion, lead us to conclude that the implosion arises\nfrom the transfer of magnetic energy from beneath the arcade as part of the\nglobal magnetic instability, rather than due to local magnetic energy\ndissipation in the flare.

These galaxies contain a substantial young A-type stellar\ncomponent, but have only little ongoing star formation (SF). HI 21-cm line\nemission is found in approximately half of the nearby E+A galaxies, indicating\nthat they contain a reservoir of gas that could fuel active SF. Here, we study\ntwo HI-rich galaxies, which show a typical E+A spectrum at the centre and SF at\nlarger radii. We present new high spatial resolution radio interferometric\nobservations of the HI 21-cm emission line using the VLA and of the CO(1-0)\nemission line using ALMA. We combine these data sets to predict the SFR and\nshow that it does not correlate well with the SFR derived from H alpha on\nsub-kpc scales. We apply a recently developed statistical model for the small\nscale behaviour of the SF relation to predict and interpret the observed\nscatter. We find smoothly distributed, regularly rotating HI gas. The CO(1-0)\nemission line is not detected for both galaxies. The derived upper limit on the\nCO mass implies a molecular gas depletion time shorter than 20 Myr. However,\ndue to the low metallicity, the CO-to-H2 conversion factor is highly uncertain.\nIn the relations between the H alpha-based SFR and the HI mass, we observe a\nsubstantial scatter we demonstrate results from small-number statistics of\nindependent star-forming regions on sub-kpc scales. This finding adds to the\nexisting literature reporting a scale dependence of the molecular SF relation,\nshowing that the atomic and molecular phases are both susceptible to the\nevolutionary 'cycling' of individual regions.

Rapid experimental progress in the last two decades includes the\nfirst demonstrations of small-scale quantum processors, but realising\nlarge-scale quantum information processors capable of universal quantum control\nremains a challenge. One primary obstacle is the inadequacy of classical\ncomputers for the task of optimising the experimental control field as we scale\nup to large systems. Classical optimisation procedures require a simulation of\nthe quantum system and have a running time that grows exponentially with the\nnumber of quantum bits (qubits) in the system. Here we show that it is possible\nto tackle this problem by using the quantum processor to optimise its own\ncontrol fields. Using measurement-based quantum feedback control (MQFC), we\ncreated a 12-coherence state with the essential control pulse completely\ndesigned by a 12-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum processor. The\nresults demonstrate the superiority of MQFC over classical optimisation\nmethods, in both efficiency and accuracy. The time required for MQFC\noptimisation is linear in the number of qubits, and our 12-qubit system beat a\nclassical computer configured with 2.4 GHz CPU and 8 GB memory. Furthermore,\nthe fidelity of the MQFC-prepared 12-coherence was about 10% better than the\nbest result using classical optimisation, since the feedback approach\ninherently corrects for unknown imperfections in the quantum processor. As MQFC\nis readily transferrable to other technologies for universal quantum\ninformation processors, we anticipate that this result will open the way to\nscalably and precisely control quantum systems, bringing us closer to a\ndemonstration of quantum supremacy.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 3 figures, plus 10-page supplemental information"]}]

All these overlays can be generated,\nadded or removed dynamically with just one line of code. The catalog data is\nkept in a non-relational database, and the interfaces were developed in\nJavaScript and Python to work within Jupyter Notebook, which allows to create\ncustom widgets, user generated scripts to analyze and plot the data\nselected/displayed in the interactive map.

Improving our understanding of these mysterious\nplanets requires the detection of a significant sample of objects suitable for\ndetailed characterization. Searching for the transits of the low-mass planets\ndetected by Doppler surveys is a straightforward way to achieve this goal.\nIndeed, Doppler surveys target the most nearby main-sequence stars, they\nregularly detect close-in low-mass planets with significant transit\nprobability, and their radial velocity data constrain strongly the ephemeris of\npossible transits. In this context, we initiated in 2010 an ambitious Spitzer\nmulti-Cycle transit search project that targeted 25 low-mass planets detected\nby radial velocity, focusing mainly on the shortest-period planets detected by\nthe HARPS spectrograph. We report here null results for 19 targets of the\nproject. For 16 planets out of 19, a transiting configuration is strongly\ndisfavored or firmly rejected by our data for most planetary compositions. We\nderive a posterior probability of 83% that none of the probed 19 planets\ntransits (for a prior probability of 22%), which still leaves a significant\nprobability of 17% that at least one of them does transit. Globally, our\nSpitzer project revealed or confirmed transits for three of its 25 targeted\nplanets, and discarded or disfavored the transiting nature of 20 of them. Our\nlight curves demonstrate for Warm Spitzer excellent photometric precisions: for\n14 targets out of 19, we were able to reach standard deviations that were\nbetter than 50ppm per 30 min intervals. Combined with its Earth-trailing orbit,\nwhich makes it capable of pointing any star in the sky and to monitor it\ncontinuously for days, this work confirms Spitzer as an optimal instrument to\ndetect sub-mmag-deep transits on the bright nearby stars targeted by Doppler\nsurveys.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics. 23 pages, 21\n  figures"]}]

The heuristics are usually easy to\nimplement and they work well for several practice-relevant classes of graphs.\nHowever, only a few research efforts are focused on providing rigorous analysis\nof such heuristics and often they lack of proven optimality or approximation\nquality. This paper focuses on the spectral heuristic proposed by Boppana\nalmost three decades ago, which still belongs to one of the most important\nbisection methods.\n  It is well known that Boppana's algorithm finds and certifies an optimal\nbisection with high probability in the random planted bisection model -- the\nstandard model which captures many real-world instances. In this model the\nvertex set is partitioned randomly into two equal sized sets, and then each\nedge inside the same part of the partition is chosen with probability $p$ and\neach edge crossing the partition is chosen with probability $q$, with $p \\ge\nq$. In our paper we investigate the problem if Boppana's algorithm works well\nin the semirandom model introduced by Feige and Kilian. The model generates\ninitially an instance by random selection within the planted bisection model,\nfollowed by adversarial decisions. Feige and Kilian posed the question if\nBoppana's algorithm works well in the semirandom model and it has remained open\nso far. In our paper we answer the question affirmatively. We show also that\nthe algorithm achieves similar performance on graph models which generalize the\nsemirandom model.

At a fixed stellar mass, galaxies with higher Dn4000 have\nlarger velocity dispersions and smaller sizes. Dn4000 is a proxy for stellar\npopulation age, thus these trends suggest that older galaxies typically have\nlarger velocity dispersions and smaller sizes. We combine velocity dispersion\nand size into a dynamical mass estimator, $\\sigma^2 R$. At a fixed stellar\nmass, $\\sigma^2 R$ depends on Dn4000. The Sersic index is also correlated with\nDn4000. The dependence of $\\sigma^2 R$ and Sersic index on Dn4000 suggests that\nquiescent galaxies are not structurally homologous systems. We derive an\nempirical correction for non-homology which is consistent with the analytical\ncorrection derived from the virial theorem. After accounting for non-homologous\ngalactic structure, we measure M* ~ M_d^(0.997 +/- 0.004) where M* is the\nstellar mass and M_d is the dynamical mass derived from the velocity dispersion\nand size; stellar mass is directly proportional to dynamical mass. Quiescent\ngalaxies appear to be in approximate virial equilibrium and deviations of the\nfundamental plane parameters from the expected virial relation may result from\nmass-to-light ratio variations, selection effects and the non-homology of\nquiescent galaxies. We infer the redshift evolution of velocity dispersion and\nsize for galaxies in our sample assuming purely passive evolution. The inferred\nevolution is inconsistent with direct measurements at higher redshifts. Thus\nquiescent galaxies do not passively evolve. Quiescent galaxies have properties\nthat are consistent with standard galaxy formation in LambdaCDM. They form at\ndifferent epochs and evolve modestly increasing their size, velocity dispersion\nand Sersic index after they cease star formation.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 14 figures. Submitted to ApJ.

Using a\nsolution of CsF in glycerol, we demonstrate that 4 +/- 2 x 10^12 19F spins in a\n1 pL volume, can be detected with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 in 1 s\nintegration.
