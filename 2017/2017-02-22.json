We found rapid spectral softening during both the prompt tail phase\nand the decline phase of an X-ray flare in the BAT and XRT data. The observed\nspectra were fit by power-law photon indices which rapidly changed from $\\Gamma\n= 1.51^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ to $\\Gamma = 5.30^{+0.69}_{-0.59}$ within a few hundred\nseconds in the prompt tail. This is one of the steepest X-ray spectra ever\nobserved, making it quite difficult to explain by simple electron acceleration\nand synchrotron radiation. Then, we applied an alternative spectral fitting\nusing a broken power-law with exponential cutoff (BPEC) model. It is valid to\nconsider the situation that the cutoff energy is equivalent to the synchrotron\nfrequency of the maximum energy electrons in their energy distribution. Since\nthe spectral cutoff appears in the soft X-ray band, we conclude the electron\nacceleration has been inefficient in the internal shocks of GRB 060904A. These\ncutoff spectra suddenly disappeared at the transition time from the prompt tail\nphase to the shallow decay one. After that, typical afterglow spectra with the\nphoton indices of 2.0 are continuously and preciously monitored by both XRT and\nSuzaku/XIS up to 1 day since the burst trigger time. We could successfully\ntrace the temporal history of two characteristic break energies (peak energy\nand cutoff energy) and they show the time dependence of $\\propto t^{-3} \\sim\nt^{-4}$ while the following afterglow spectra are quite stable. This fact\nindicates that the emitting material of prompt tail is due to completely\ndifferent dynamics from the shallow decay component. Therefore we conclude the\nemission sites of two distinct phenomena obviously differ from each other.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ (Suzaku 2nd\n  Special Issue)"]}]

There have been fewer studies of the\nasymptotic capacity of large-scale wireless networks based on CSMA\n(carrier-sensing multi-access), which schedules transmissions in a distributed\nand random manner. With the rapid and widespread adoption of CSMA technology, a\ncritical question is that whether CSMA networks can be as scalable as TDMA\nnetworks. To answer this question and explore the capacity of CSMA networks, we\nfirst formulate the models of CSMA protocols to take into account the unique\nCSMA characteristics not captured by existing interference models in the\nliterature.

As a result, we show that CSMA\ncan achieve throughput as $\\Omega(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}})$, the same order as\noptimal centralized TDMA, on uniform random networks.

Also, to obtain\nan analytical probability distribution for stacked test statistics in the case\nof a search for pulsed emission from an ensemble of pulsars where the\nsignificance per pulsar is relatively low, making individual detections\ninsignificant on their own. This information is timely given the recent rapid\ndiscovery of new pulsars with the Fermi-LAT t $\\gamma$-ray telescope. Methods:\nApproximately $10^{14}$ realisations of the H-statistic ($H$) for random\n(white) noise is calculated from a random number generator for which the\nrepitition cycle is $\\gg 10^{14}$. From these numbers the probability\ndistribution $P(>H)$ is calculated. Results: The distribution of $H$ is is\nfound to be exponential with parameter $\\lambda=0.4$ so that the cumulative\nprobability distribution $P(>H)=\\exp{(-\\lambda H)}$. If we stack independent\nvalues for $H$, the sum of $K$ such values would follow the Erlang-K\ndistribution with parameter $\\lambda$ for which the cumulative probability\ndistribution is also a simple analytical expression.

In applying this method to waveforms of initially\nnon-spinning black hole binaries, of mass ratios 1 to 15, we find not only the\nfundamental quasi-normal mode amplitudes, but also overtones, and evidence for\n2nd order quasi-normal modes. We find that the mass-ratio dependence of\nquasi-normal mode excitation is very well modeled by a Post-Newtonian like sum\nin symmetric mass ratio. Concurrently, we find that the mass ratio dependence\nof some quasi-normal modes is qualitatively different from their Post-Newtonian\ninspired counterparts, suggesting that the imprints of nonlinear merger are\nmore evident in some modes than in others. We present new fitting formulas for\nthe related quasi-normal mode excitations, as well as for remnant black hole\nspin and mass.

The first algorithm is designed to work with scan strategies that\nhave a good range of crossing angles for each map pixel and the second for scan\nstrategies that have a limited range of crossing angles. The first algorithm\ncan also be used to identify if systematic errors that have a particular spin\nare present in a TOD. We demonstrate the use of both algorithms and the ability\nto identify systematics with simulations of TOD with realistic scan strategies\nand instrumental noise.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 6 figures"]}]

Some recent studies have shown that the collective\nmaximum force (stall force) generated by multiple cytoskeletal filaments or\nmolecular motors may not always be just a simple sum of the stall forces of the\nindividual filaments or motors. To understand this excess or deficit in the\ncollective force, we study a broad class of models of both cytoskeletal\nfilaments and molecular motors.

However, an important precondition to identify all of\nthese parameters, is a sufficient number of RTs from erroneous responses. In\nthe present article, we show by simulation that the parameters of the Wiener\ndistribution can be recovered even from tasks yielding very high or even\nperfect response accuracies using the shifted Wald distribution.

In accordance with our\nsimulations, diffusion modeling using the Wiener and the shifted Wald\ndistribution yielded identical parameter estimates when the number of erroneous\nresponses was predicted to be low. Moreover, the modeling of error RTs as\ncensored correct RTs substantially improved the recovery of these diffusion\nparameters when premature trial timeout was introduced to increase the number\nof omission errors.

We review here a broad range of\nnetwork-based recommendation algorithms and for the first time compare their\nperformance on three distinct real datasets.

As this rises, so does\nthe fraction of gas in the CO-dominated phase that produces little [CII]\nemission. Our model further suggests that the apparent offset in the [CII]-FIR\nrelation for high-z sources compared to those at present epoch may arise from\nsystematically larger gas masses at early times: a galaxy with a large gas mass\ncan sustain a high star formation rate even with relatively modest surface\ndensity, allowing copious [CII] emission to coexist with rapid star formation.\n","Comment: Accepted by MNRAS; minor revisions that include additional\n  comparisons to observations"]}]

We\nidentify parameter regimes where scattering between Floquet bands of opposite\nchirality is exponentially suppressed, opening a long time window where the\nmany-body dynamics separately conserves the occupations of the two chiral\nbands. Within this intermediate time regime we predict that the system reaches\na chiral quasi-steady state. This state is universal in the sense that the\ncurrent it carries is determined solely by the density of particles in each\nband and the topological winding numbers of the Floquet bands. This remarkable\nbehavior, which holds for both bosons and fermions, may be readily studied\nexperimentally in recently developed cold atom systems.\n","Comment: Expanded version"]}]

Firstly, in earlier work, I had shown how to\nconstruct the four-dimensional exceptional root systems from the 3D root\nsystems using Clifford techniques, by constructing them in the 4D even\nsubalgebra of the 3D Clifford algebra; for instance the icosahedral root system\n$H_3$ gives rise to the largest (and therefore exceptional)\nnon-crystallographic root system $H_4$. Arnold's trinities and the McKay\ncorrespondence then hint that there might be an indirect connection between the\nicosahedron and $E_8$. Secondly, in a related construction, I have now made\nthis connection explicit for the first time: in the 8D Clifford algebra of 3D\nspace the $120$ elements of the icosahedral group $H_3$ are doubly covered by\n$240$ 8-component objects, which endowed with a `reduced inner product' are\nexactly the $E_8$ root system. It was previously known that $E_8$ splits into\n$H_4$-invariant subspaces, and we discuss the folding construction relating the\ntwo pictures. This folding is a partial version of the one used for the\nconstruction of the Coxeter plane, so thirdly we discuss the geometry of the\nCoxeter plane in a Clifford algebra framework.

Methods: We perform three-dimensional simulations of\nstratified fully compressible magnetohydrodynamic convection in rotating\nspherical wedges at various thermal and magnetic Prandtl numbers (from 0.25 to\n2 and 5, respectively). Results: We find that the rotation profiles for high\nthermal diffusivity show a monotonically increasing angular velocity from the\nbottom of the convection zone to the top and from the poles toward the equator.\nFor sufficiently rapid rotation, a region of negative radial shear develops at\nmid-latitudes as the thermal diffusivity is decreased.

Hence CQs provide very\ncrucial and independent information on the strength of the magnetic field\nproduced in HIC.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures, Accepted for publication in Physics Letters B"]}]

At an estimated\nplanet-to-star contrast of ~10^-7 in reflected light, Proxima b is extremely\nchallenging to detect with SPHERE alone. However, the combination of a\n~10^3-10^4 contrast enhancement from SPHERE to the high spectral resolution of\nESPRESSO can reveal the planetary spectral features and disentangle them from\nthe stellar ones. Results. We find that significant but realistic upgrades to\nSPHERE and ESPRESSO would enable a 5-sigma detection of the planet and yield a\nmeasurement of its true mass and albedo in 20-40 nights of telescope time,\nassuming an Earth-like atmospheric composition. Moreover, it will be possible\nto probe the O2 bands at 627, 686 and 760 nm, the water vapour band at 717 nm,\nand the methane band at 715 nm. In particular, a 3.6-sigma detection of O2\ncould be made in about 60 nights of telescope time. Those would need to be\nspread over 3 years considering optimal observability conditions for the\nplanet. Conclusions. The very existence of Proxima b and the SPHERE-ESPRESSO\nsynergy represent a unique opportunity to detect biosignatures on an exoplanet\nin the near future. It is also a crucial pathfinder experiment for the\ndevelopment of Extremely Large Telescopes and their instruments (abridged).\n","Comment: 16 pages, 7 figures, revised version accepted to A&A"]}]

We then estimate the velocity dispersions of UDGs\ndrawn from two published samples and examine the distribution of total masses.\nWe find, in agreement with the previous studies of two individual UDGs, that\nthese systems are dark matter dominated systems, and that they span a range of\nat least $10^{10} < M_{200}/M_\\odot < 10^{12} $.

The feature is of magnetic\norigin but is insensitive to magnetic field, explicable in terms of\ninhomogeneous occupancy of Mn within the lattice resulting in antiferromagnetic\nordered Mn clusters.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 7 figures, 1 table"]}]

The search for signals from exotic sources in\nantiproton data is hampered by large backgrounds from spallation which, within\ntheoretical errors, can solely account for the current data. Due to the higher\nenergy threshold for antideuteron production, which translates into a\nsuppression of the low energy flux from spallations, antideuteron searches have\nbeen proposed as a probe for exotic sources. We perform in this paper a\ncomprehensive analysis of the antideuteron fluxes at the Earth expected from\nknown and hypothetical sources in our Galaxy, and we calculate their maximal\nvalues consistent with current antiproton data from AMS-02. We find that\nsupernova remnants generate a negligible flux, whereas primordial black hole\nevaporation and dark matter annihilations or decays may dominate the total flux\nat low energies. On the other hand, we find that the detection of cosmic\nantideuterons would require, for the scenarios studied in this paper and\nassuming optimistic values of the coalescence momentum and solar modulation, an\nincrease of the experimental sensitivity compared to ongoing and planned\ninstruments by at least a factor of 2. Finally, we briefly comment on the\nprospects for antihelium-3 detection.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 5 figures; v2 matches published version"]}]

The recent version of the L-Galaxies model\nby Henriques et al.(H15) is a step forward to solve these problems by\nreproducing the evolution of stellar mass function and the overall fraction of\nred galaxies. In this paper we compare the two model predictions of L-Galaxies\n(the other is Guo et al. , G13) to the SDSS data in detail.

Aims: Our goal is to\nconstrain the IMF of the Galactic thin disc population using both Galactic\nClassical Cepheids and Tycho-2 data. Methods: For the first time the\nBesan\\c{c}on Galaxy Model (BGM) has been used to characterise the Galactic\npopulation of the Classical Cepheids. We have modified the age configuration in\nthe youngest populations of the BGM thin disc model to avoid artificial\ndiscontinuities in the age distribution of the simulated Cepheids. Three\nstatistical methods, optimized for different mass ranges, have been developed\nand applied to search for the best IMF that fits the observations.

Light curves were analyzed for periodicity using\nthe Lomb-Scargle periodogram, the autocorrelation function and the\nstring-length method. The period distribution obtained for the cluster consists\nof a smooth distribution centered around P=5.2 d with two peaks at P=1-2 d and\n3-4 d. A separate analysis of CTTS and WTTS indicates that the P=1-2 d peak is\nassociated with the latter, while both groups contribute to the P=3-4 d peak.\nThe comparison between CTTS and WTTS supports the idea of a rotation-accretion\nconnection: their respective rotational properties are statistically different,\nand CTTS rotate on average more slowly than WTTS. We also observe a clear\ndearth of fast rotators with strong accretion signatures (large UV flux\nexcess). This is consistent with earlier findings that fast rotators in young\nstar clusters are typically devoid of dusty disks. Our sample shows some\nevidence of a mass dependence in the rotation properties of NGC 2264 members,\nlower-mass stars spinning on average faster. This study confirms that disks\ninfluence the rotational evolution of young stars. The idea of disk-locking may\nbe consistent with the picture of rotation and rotation-accretion connection\nthat we observe for the NGC 2264 cluster.

Besides GW150914, all of the search\nresults are consistent with the expected rate of accidental noise coincidences.\nFinally, we estimate rate-density limits for a broad range of non-BBH transient\ngravitational-wave sources as a function of their gravitational radiation\nemission energy and their characteristic frequency.

Our sample of 45 stellar systems includes\n28 kinematically confirmed dark-matter-dominated dwarf spheroidal galaxies\n(dSphs) and 17 recently discovered systems that have photometric\ncharacteristics consistent with the population of known dSphs. For each of\nthese targets, the relative predicted gamma-ray flux due to dark matter\nannihilation is taken from kinematic analysis if available, and estimated from\na distance-based scaling relation otherwise, assuming that the stellar systems\nare dark-matter-dominated dSphs. LAT data coincident with four of the newly\ndiscovered targets show a slight preference (each ~$2 \\sigma$ local) for\ngamma-ray emission in excess of the background. However, the ensemble of\nderived gamma-ray flux upper limits for individual targets is consistent with\nthe expectation from analyzing random blank-sky regions, and a combined\nanalysis of the population of stellar systems yields no globally significant\nexcess (global significance $<1 \\sigma$). Our analysis has increased\nsensitivity compared to the analysis of 15 confirmed dSphs by Ackermann et al.\n2015.

To constrain the background\ncloud particle sizes and scattering properties we conducted a limb-darkening\nanalysis of the background cloud structure at 30-40N by simultaneously fitting:\na) these HST/OPAL observations at a range of zenith angles; b) the VLT/SINFONI\nobservations at a range of zenith angles; and c) IRTF/SpeX observations made in\n2009 (Irwin et al., 2015).\n  We find that the observations are well modelled with a three-component cloud\ncomprised of: 1) a vertically thin, but optically thick 'deep' tropospheric\ncloud at a pressure of ~2 bars; 2) a methane-ice cloud at the\nmethane-condensation level with variable vertical extent; and 3) a vertically\nextended tropospheric haze. We find that the particles sizes in both haze and\ntropospheric cloud have an effective radius of ~0.1 micron, although we cannot\nrule out larger particle sizes in the tropospheric cloud.\n  We find that the particles in both the tropospheric cloud and haze are more\nscattering at short wavelengths, giving them a blue colour, but are more\nabsorbing at longer wavelengths, especially for the tropospheric haze. For the\nparticles in the storm clouds, which we assume to be composed of methane ice\nparticles, we find that their mean radii must be ~0.5 micron. We find that the\nhigh clouds have low integrated opacity, and that \"streamers\" reminiscent of\nthunderstorm anvils are confined to levels deeper than 1 bar.

Thus, we propose MTransE, a translation-based model for\nmultilingual knowledge graph embeddings, to provide a simple and automated\nsolution. By encoding entities and relations of each language in a separated\nembedding space, MTransE provides transitions for each embedding vector to its\ncross-lingual counterparts in other spaces, while preserving the\nfunctionalities of monolingual embeddings. We deploy three different techniques\nto represent cross-lingual transitions, namely axis calibration, translation\nvectors, and linear transformations, and derive five variants for MTransE using\ndifferent loss functions. Our models can be trained on partially aligned\ngraphs, where just a small portion of triples are aligned with their\ncross-lingual counterparts. The experiments on cross-lingual entity matching\nand triple-wise alignment verification show promising results, with some\nvariants consistently outperforming others on different tasks. We also explore\nhow MTransE preserves the key properties of its monolingual counterpart TransE.\n"]}]

Although metrics have been\nproposed in these contexts, no systematic study has been conducted on the\nselection of a robust metric for quality assessment. This article addresses the\nquestion: what is the best metric to assess the quality of a reconstructed\nimage? It starts by considering several metrics, and selecting a few based on\ngeneral properties. Then, a variety of image reconstruction cases is\nconsidered. The observational scenarios are phase closure and phase referencing\nat the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), for a combination of two,\nthree, four and six telescopes. End-to-end image reconstruction is accomplished\nwith the MiRA software, and several merit functions are put to test. It is\nfound that convolution by an effective point spread function is required for\nproper image quality assessment. The effective angular resolution of the images\nis superior to naive expectation based on the maximum frequency sampled by the\narray. This is due to the prior information used in the aperture synthesis\nalgorithm and to the nature of the objects considered. The l1 norm is the most\nrobust of all considered metrics, because being linear it is less sensitive to\nimage smoothing by high regularisation levels. For the cases considered, this\nmetric allows the implementation of automatic quality assessment of\nreconstructed images, with a performance similar to human selection.\n","Comment: Key words: instrumentation: high angular resolution -\n  instrumentation: interferosmeters - methods: data analysis - techniques: high\n  angular resolution - techniques: image processing - techniques:\n  interferometric. 18 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables"]}]

Such initial models, however, are difficult to\nconstruct for giant stars because of the wide range in spatial scales of the\nhydrostatic equilibrium and in dynamical timescales between the core and the\nenvelope of the giant. They are needed for, e.g., modeling the common envelope\nphase where a giant envelope encompasses both the giant core and a companion\nstar. Here, we present a new method of approximating and reconstructing giant\nprofiles from a stellar evolution code to produce stable models for\nmulti-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. We determine typical stellar\nstratification profiles with the 1D stellar evolution code MESA. After an\nappropriate mapping, hydrodynamical simulations are conducted using the\nmoving-mesh code AREPO. The giant profiles are approximated by replacing the\ncore of the giant with a point mass and by constructing a suitable continuation\nof the profile to the center. Different reconstruction methods are tested that\ncan specifically control the convective behaviour of the model. After mapping\nto a grid, a relaxation procedure that includes damping of spurious velocities\nyields stable models in three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. Initially\nconvectively stable configurations lead to stable hydrodynamical models while\nfor stratifications that are convectively unstable in the stellar evolution\ncode, simulations recover the convective behaviour of the initial model and\nshow large convective plumes with Mach numbers up to 0.8.

This tendency is especially\nreflected in the efforts to design composite indicators (e.g. the Altmetric\nattention score). We deem appropriate that not only the impact measurement\nusing citations is target-oriented (citations measure the impact of papers on\nscientists), but also the measurement of impact using altmetrics. Impact\nmeasurements only make sense, if the target group - the recipient of academic\npapers - is clearly defined. Thus, we extend in this study the field-normalized\nreader impact indicator proposed by us in an earlier study, which is based on\nMendeley data (the mean normalized reader score, MNRS), to a target-oriented\nfield-normalized impact indicator (e.g., MNRS_ED measures reader impact on the\nsector of educational donation, i.e., teaching). This indicator can show - as\ndemonstrated in empirical examples - the ability of journals, countries, and\nacademic institutions to publish papers which are below or above the average\nimpact of papers on a specific sector in society (e.g., the educational or\nteaching sector). For example, the method allows to measure the impact of\nscientific papers on students - controlling for the field in which the papers\nhave been published and their publication year.\n","Comment: In press at Research Evaluation"]}]

In this paper we introduce a novel\nformalism which fixes this functional dependence directly from the isometries\nof the background metric, thus allowing one to quickly assess the overall\nfeatures of Gaussian correlators without resorting to the full machinery of\nperturbation theory. As an application we construct the CMB temperature\ncorrelation function in one inhomogeneous (namely, an off-center LTB model) and\ntwo spatially flat and anisotropic (Bianchi) universes, and derive their\ncovariance matrices in the limit of almost Friedmannian symmetry.

After a general study of nearest-neighbor\nstatistics on spatial random distribution, we introduce the one-point\ncorrelation $\\Psi$ function to complement the pair correlation function and\ndefine the spatial regimes departing from randomness in Taurus. We then perform\na set of statistical studies to characterize the binary regime that prevails in\nTaurus. The $\\Psi$ function in Taurus has a scale-free trend with a similar\nexponent as the correlation function at small scale. It extends almost 3\ndecades up to $\\sim 60$ kAU showing a potential extended wide binary regime.\nThis was hidden in the correlation function due to the clustering pattern\nblending. Distinguishing two stellar populations, single stars versus multiple\nsystems (separation $ \\leq 1$ kAU), within Class II/III stars observed at high\nangular resolution, we highlight a major spatial neighborhood difference\nbetween the two populations using nearest-neighbor statistics. The multiple\nsystems are three times more likely to have a distant companion within 10 kAU\nwhen compared to single stars. We show that this is due to the presence of most\nprobable physical ultra-wide pairs. These UWPs are biased towards high\nmultiplicity and higher-stellar-mass components at shorter separations. The\nmultiplicity fraction per ultra-wide pair with separation less than 10 kAU may\nbe as high as 83.5 $\\pm$ 19.6\\%.

Those algorithms have been wildly used as a preprocessing step in\ncomputer vision works, as they can enormously reduce the number of entries of\nsubsequent algorithms. In this work, we propose an alternative superpixel\nsegmentation method based on Gaussian mixture model (GMM) by assuming that each\nsuperpixel corresponds to a Gaussian distribution, and assuming that each pixel\nis generated by first randomly choosing one distribution from several Gaussian\ndistributions which are defined to be related to that pixel, and then the pixel\nis drawn from the selected distribution.

An algorithm based on expectation-maximization method is\napplied to estimate the unknown parameters. Once the unknown parameters are\nobtained, the superpixel label of a pixel is determined by a posterior\nprobability. The success of applying GMM to superpixel segmentation depends on\nthe two major differences between the traditional GMM-based clustering and the\nproposed one: data points in our model may be non-identically distributed, and\nwe present an approach to control the shape of the estimated Gaussian functions\nby adjusting their covariance matrices.

Properly accounting for this causes\nthe inferred reflection fraction to increase substantially, especially for the\nhard state. Another important impact of the Comptonization of reflection\nemission by the corona is the downscattered tail. Downscattering has the\npotential to mimic the relativistically-broadened red wing of the Fe line\nassociated with a spinning black hole.

For bright hard states, we show that disk truncation to large scales (R\nmuch larger than the ISCO radius) is unlikely as this would require accretion\nrates far in excess of the brightest soft states.

This approach, whose origins can be traced to machine learning, is\nbased on the leave-one-out bootstrap for prediction error. In machine learning\nthis is called the out-of-bag (OOB) error. To obtain the OOB error for a model,\none draws a bootstrap sample and fits the model to the in-sample data. The\nout-of-sample prediction error for the model is obtained by calculating the\nprediction error for the model using the out-of-sample data. Repeating and\naveraging yields the OOB error, which represents a robust cross-validated\nestimate of the accuracy of the underlying model. By a simple modification to\nthe bootstrap data involving \"noising up\" a variable, the OOB method yields a\nvariable importance (VIMP) index, which directly measures how much a specific\nvariable contributes to the prediction precision of a model. VIMP provides a\nscientifically interpretable measure of the effect size of a variable, we call\nthe \"predictive effect size\", that holds whether the researcher's model is\ncorrect or not, unlike the p-value whose calculation is based on the assumed\ncorrectness of the model.

Recently, several empirical luminosity correlations have been\nstatistically proposed from GRB observations. However, to treat GRB as the\ndistance indicator, there are two key issues: the redshift evolution of\nluminosity correlations and their calibrations. In this paper, we choose the\nAmati relation, the correlation between the peak spectra energy and the\nequivalent isotropic energy of GRBs ($E_{\\rm p}-E_{\\rm iso}$), as an example,\nand find that the current GRB dataset implies that there could be a evolution\nof the luminosity correlation with respect to the redshift.

We examine the effect that the intrinsic CNO\nabundances have on a 3D model structure and the resulting 3D spectrum\nsynthesis. Methods.

Our results suggest that varying the C/O ratio has a\nsubstantial impact on the internal structure of the 3D model, even in the hot\nturn-off star models explored here.

A graph-based API enables rapid\ndevelopment of complex feature extraction pipelines that output results in a\nsingle, standardized format.

However, the\nVoyager 1 spacecraft measured very little rotation across the HP. Previously we\nshowed that the $B_{ISM}$ twists as it approaches the HP and acquires a strong\nT component (East-West). Here we establish that reconnection in the eastern\nflank of the heliosphere is responsible for the twist. On the eastern flank the\nsolar magnetic field has twisted into the positive N direction and reconnects\nwith the Southward pointing component of the $B_{ISM}$. Reconnection drives a\nrotational discontinuity (RD) that twists the $B_{ISM}$ into the -T direction\nand propagates upstream in the interstellar medium towards the nose. The\nconsequence is that the N component of $B_{ISM}$ is reduced in a finite width\nband upstream of the HP. Voyager 1 currently measures angles\n($\\delta=sin^{-1}(B_{N}/B)$) close to solar values. We present MHD simulations\nto support this scenario, suppressing reconnection in the nose region while\nallowing it in the flanks, consistent with recent ideas about reconnection\nsuppression from diamagnetic drifts. The jump in plasma $\\beta$ (the plasma to\nmagnetic pressure) across the nose of HP is much greater than in the flanks\nbecause the heliosheath $\\beta$ is greater there than in the flanks.\nLarge-scale reconnection is therefore suppressed in the nose but not at the\nflanks.

The proposed four-parameter affine motion model can not\nonly handle most of the complex motions in natural videos but also save the\nbits for two parameters. Second, to efficiently encode the affine motion\nparameters, we propose two motion prediction modes, i.e., advanced affine\nmotion vector prediction combined with a gradient-based fast affine motion\nestimation algorithm and affine model merge, where the latter attempts to reuse\nthe affine motion parameters (instead of the motion vectors) of neighboring\nblocks. Third, we propose two fast affine motion compensation algorithms. One\nis the one-step sub-pixel interpolation, which reduces the computations of each\ninterpolation. The other is the interpolation-precision-based adaptive block\nsize motion compensation, which performs motion compensation at the block level\nrather than the pixel level to reduce the interpolation times.

Reinforcement learning (RL) methods are recognized to be\npromising for specifying such tasks in a relatively simple manner. However, the\nstrong dependency between the learning method and the task to learn is a\nwell-known problem that restricts practical implementations of RL in robotics,\noften requiring major modifications of parameters and adding other techniques\nfor each particular task. In this paper we present a practical core\nimplementation of RL which enables the learning process for multiple robotic\ntasks with minimal per-task tuning or none. Based on value iteration methods,\nthis implementation includes a novel approach for action selection, called\nQ-biased softmax regression (QBIASSR), which avoids poor performance of the\nlearning process when the robot reaches new unexplored states. Our approach\ntakes advantage of the structure of the state space by attending the physical\nvariables involved (e.g., distances to obstacles, X,Y,{\\theta} pose, etc.),\nthus experienced sets of states may favor the decision-making process of\nunexplored or rarely-explored states. This improvement has a relevant role in\nreducing the tuning of the algorithm for particular tasks. Experiments with\nreal and simulated robots, performed with the software framework also\nintroduced here, show that our implementation is effectively able to learn\ndifferent robotic tasks without tuning the learning method.

One key challenge in CIP is\nthe ability to allocate resources, either personnel or cyber, to critical\ninfrastructures with different vulnerability and criticality levels. In this\nwork, a contract-theoretic approach is proposed to solve the problem of\nresource allocation in critical infrastructure with asymmetric information. A\ncontrol center (CC) is used to design contracts and offer them to\ninfrastructures' owners. A contract can be seen as an agreement between the CC\nand infrastructures using which the CC allocates resources and gets rewards in\nreturn. Contracts are designed in a way to maximize the CC's benefit and\nmotivate each infrastructure to accept a contract and obtain proper resources\nfor its protection. Infrastructures are defined by both vulnerability levels\nand criticality levels which are unknown to the CC. Therefore, each\ninfrastructure can claim that it is the most vulnerable or critical to gain\nmore resources. A novel mechanism is developed to handle such an asymmetric\ninformation while providing the optimal contract that motivates each\ninfrastructure to reveal its actual type. The necessary and sufficient\nconditions for such resource allocation contracts under asymmetric information\nare derived. Simulation results show that the proposed contract-theoretic\napproach maximizes the CC's utility while ensuring that no infrastructure has\nan incentive to ask for another contract, despite the lack of exact information\nat the CC.\n","Comment: Accepted in IEEE GLOBECOM 2015"]}]

The ISO by itself cannot solve the DC-OPF problem as\ngenerators are strategic and do not share their cost functions. Instead, each\ngenerator submits to the ISO a bid, consisting of the price per unit of\nelectricity at which it is willing to provide power.

As a powerful example,\nwe study whether minimally coupled, single field Quintessence models that are\nsafe from ghost instabilities, can source the CPL expansion history recently\nshown to be mildly favored by a combination of CMB (Planck) and Weak Lensing\n(KiDS) data. Interestingly we find that in their most conservative form, the\ntheoretical conditions impact the analysis in such a way that smooth single\nfield Quintessence becomes significantly disfavored with respect to the\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. This is due to the fact that these\nconditions cut a significant portion of the $(w_0,w_a)$ parameter space for\nCPL, in particular eliminating the region that would be favored by weak lensing\ndata. Within the scenario of a smooth dynamical dark energy parametrized with\nCPL, weak lensing data favors a region that would require multiple fields to\nensure gravitational stability.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures"]}]

A new approach to the formulation\nof the electromotive force and the theory of differential rotation and\nmeridional circulation is described. Dynamo cycles in the overshoot layer and\ndistributed dynamos are compared, with the latter including the influence of\nmeridional flow. The overshoot layer dynamo reproduces the solar cycle periods\nand the butterfly diagram only if alpha=0 in the convection zone (CZ). The\ndistributed dynamo including meridional flows shows the observed butterfly\ndiagram even with a positive dynamo-alpha in CZ. The nonlinear feedback of\nstrong magnetic fields on differential rotation leads to grand minima in the\ncyclic activity similar to those observed. Our 2D model contains the large- and\nsmall-scale feedback of magnetic fields on diff. rotation and induction in a\nmean-field formulation (Lambda-, alpha-quenching). Grand minima may also occur\nif a dynamo occasionally falls below its critical eigenvalue. We never found\nany indication that such an on-off dynamo collapses by this effect after being\nexcited. The full quenching of turbulence by strong magnetic fields as reduced\ninduction (alpha) and reduced turbulent diffusivity (eta_T) is studied in 1D.\nWe find a stronger dependence of cycle period on dynamo number compared with a\npure alpha-quenching model giving a very weak cycle period dependence. Also the\ntemporal fluctuations of alpha and eta_T from a random-vortex simulation were\napplied to a dynamo. Then the low `quality' of the solar cycle can be explained\nwith a small number of giant cells as dynamo-active turbulence. The transition\nfrom almost regular magnetic oscillations (many vortices) to a more or less\nchaotic time series (very few vortices) is shown.\n","Comment: 46 pages, 27 figures, 3 tables; replacement because we added: to be\n  published in \"The Fluid Mechanics of Astrophysics and Geophysics\", Vol. 8,\n  ed.
