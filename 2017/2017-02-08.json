One type of ions\n(small counterions) permeates into the gap and gives rise to a\ndistance-dependent membrane potential, which translates into a repulsive\nelectrostatic disjoining pressure due to an overlap of counterion clouds in the\ngap. To quantify it we use two complementary approaches. First, we propose a\nmean-field theory based on a linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation and Fourier\nanalysis. These calculations allow us to estimate the effect of a heterogeneous\ncharge pattern at the wall on the induced heterogeneous membrane potential, and\nthe value of the disjoining pressure as a function of the gap. Second, we\nperform Langevin dynamics simulations of the same system with explicit ions.\nThe results of the two approaches are in good agreement with each other at low\nsurface charge and small gap, but differ due to nonlinearity at the higher\ncharge.

However,\nwhile some of these methods assume a zero-mean Gaussian distribution for the\nunderlying noise, its real distribution is known to be non-Gaussian and to\ndepend on the methodology used to combine multichannel signals. Indeed, the two\nprevailing methods for multichannel signal combination lead to Rician and\nnoncentral Chi noise distributions.

To quantify the benefits of using\nproper noise models, RUMBA-SD was compared with dRL-SD, a well-established\nmethod based on the RL algorithm for Gaussian noise. Another aim of the study\nwas to quantify the impact of including a total variation (TV) spatial\nregularization term in the estimation framework. To do this, we developed TV\nspatially-regularized versions of both RUMBA-SD and dRL-SD algorithms. The\nevaluation was performed by comparing various quality metrics on 132\nthree-dimensional synthetic phantoms involving different inter-fiber angles and\nvolume fractions, which were contaminated with noise mimicking patterns\ngenerated by data processing in multichannel scanners. The results demonstrate\nthat the inclusion of proper likelihood models leads to an increased ability to\nresolve fiber crossings with smaller inter-fiber angles and to better detect\nnon-dominant fibers.

In this article, we present a novel model of\nopinion formation in which agents may either have a strict preference for a\nchoice, or be undecided.

As a function of these two parameters, the model presents a wide\nrange of possible solutions, as for instance, consensus of each opinion,\nbi-polarisation or convergence of undecided individuals. We found that a\nminimum fraction of undecided agents is crucial not only for reaching consensus\nof a given opinion, but also to determine a dominant opinion in a polarised\nsituation.

Here we\npropose a unifying framework that connects cognitive and social forces together\nin order to study the dynamics of societal belief evolution.

Because the ISM is turbulent, a given\npatch of ISM exhibits sub-patches with a range of surface densities. The\nhigh-density patches are 'pushed' by feedback, thereby driving turbulence and\nself-regulating local star formation. Sufficiently low-density patches,\nhowever, are accelerated to above the escape velocity before the region can\nself-adjust and are thus vented as outflows. In the\nturbulent-pressure-supported regime, when the gas fraction is $\\gtrsim 0.3$,\nthe ratio of the turbulent velocity dispersion to the circular velocity is\nsufficiently high that at any given time, of order half of the ISM has surface\ndensity less than the critical value and thus can be blown out on a dynamical\ntime. The resulting outflows have a mass-loading factor ($\\eta \\equiv M_{\\rm\nout}/M_{\\star}$) that is inversely proportional to the gas fraction times the\ncircular velocity. At low gas fractions, the star formation rate needed for\nlocal self-regulation, and corresponding turbulent Mach number, decline\nrapidly; the ISM is 'smoother', and it is actually more difficult to drive\nwinds with large mass-loading factors. Crucially, our model predicts that\nstellar-feedback-driven outflows should be suppressed at $z \\lesssim 1$ in\n$M_{\\star} \\gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$ galaxies. This mechanism allows massive\ngalaxies to exhibit violent outflows at high redshifts and then 'shut down'\nthose outflows at late times, thereby enabling the formation of a smooth,\nextended thin stellar disk.

Identification of conserved moieties gives insight into\nthe structure and function of metabolic networks and facilitates metabolic\nmodelling. All moiety conservation relations can be represented as nonnegative\ninteger vectors in the left null space of the stoichiometric matrix\ncorresponding to a biochemical network. Algorithms exist to compute such\nvectors based only on reaction stoichiometry but their computational complexity\nhas limited their application to relatively small metabolic networks.

In many cases, gradients of secreted signaling\nmolecules - morphogens - guide this process. The continuous positional\ninformation provided by the gradient is converted into discrete cell types by\nthe downstream transcriptional network that responds to the morphogen. A\nmechanism commonly used to implement a sharp transition between two adjacent\ncell fates is the genetic toggle switch, composed of cross-repressing\ntranscriptional determinants. Previous analyses emphasize the steady state\noutput of these mechanisms. Here, we explore the dynamics of the toggle switch\nand use exact numerical simulations of the kinetic reactions, the Chemical\nLangevin Equation, and Minimum Action Path theory to establish a framework for\nstudying the effect of gene expression noise on patterning time and boundary\nposition. This provides insight into the time scale, gene expression\ntrajectories and directionality of stochastic switching events between cell\nstates. Taking gene expression noise into account predicts that the final\nboundary position of a morphogen-induced toggle switch, although robust to\nchanges in the details of the noise, is distinct from that of the deterministic\nsystem. Moreover, stochastic switching introduces differences in patterning\ntime along the morphogen gradient that result in a patterning wave propagating\naway from the morphogen source. The velocity of this wave is influenced by\nnoise; the wave sharpens and slows as it advances and may never reach steady\nstate in a biologically relevant time. This could explain experimentally\nobserved dynamics of pattern formation. Together the analysis reveals the\nimportance of dynamical transients for understanding morphogen-driven\ntranscriptional networks and indicates that gene expression noise can\nqualitatively alter developmental patterning.\n"]}]

The intensity profiles of iron and oxygen in Solar Energetic\nParticle (SEP) events often display differences that result in a decreasing\nFe/O ratio over time.

In this paper we study the propagation of\niron and oxygen SEP ions using a 3D model of propagation which includes the\neffect of guiding centre drift in a Parker spiral magnetic field. We derive\ntime intensity profiles for a variety of observer locations and study the\ntemporal evolution of the Fe/O ratio. Methods. We use a 3D full orbit test\nparticle model which includes scattering. The configuration of the\ninterplanetary magnetic field is a unipolar Parker spiral. Particles are\nreleased instantaneously from a compact region at 2 solar radii and allowed to\npropagate in 3D. Results. Both Fe and O experience significant transport across\nthe magnetic field due to gradient and curvature drifts. We find that Fe ions\ndrift more than O ions due to their larger mass-to-charge ratio, so that an\nobserver that is not magnetically well connected to the source region will\nobserve Fe arriving before O, for particles within the same range in energy per\nnucleon. As a result, for the majority of observer locations, the Fe/O ratio\ndisplays a decrease in time. Conclusions. We conclude that propagation effects\nassociated with drifts produce a decay over time of the Fe/O ratio,\nqualitatively reproducing that observed in SEP event profiles.\n","Comment: Submitted to A&A, revised version (6 pages, 6 figures)"]}]

High-resolution simulations exhibit a tendency towards\nstatistical self-organization of MRI dynamo turbulence into large-scale cyclic\ndynamics. Understanding the physical origin of these structures, and whether\nthey can be sustained and transport angular momentum efficiently in\nastrophysical conditions, represents a significant theoretical challenge. The\ndiscovery of simple periodic nonlinear MRI dynamo solutions has recently proven\nuseful in this respect, and has notably served to highlight the role of\nturbulent magnetic diffusion in the seeming decay of the dynamics at low\nmagnetic Prandtl number Pm (magnetic diffusivity larger than viscosity), a\ncommon regime in accretion disks. The connection between these simple\nstructures and the statistical organization reported in turbulent simulations\nremained elusive, though. Here, we report the numerical discovery in moderate\naspect ratio Keplerian shearing boxes of new periodic, incompressible,\nthree-dimensional nonlinear MRI dynamo solutions with a larger dynamical\ncomplexity reminiscent of such simulations. These \"chimera\" cycles are\ncharacterized by multiple MRI-unstable dynamical stages, but their basic\nphysical principles of self-sustainment are nevertheless identical to those of\nsimpler cycles found in azimuthally elongated boxes. In particular, we find\nthat they are not sustained at low Pm either due to subcritical turbulent\nmagnetic diffusion. These solutions offer a new perspective into the transition\nfrom laminar to turbulent instability-driven dynamos, and may prove useful to\ndevise improved statistical models of turbulent accretion disk dynamos.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 8 figures, submitted to A&A"]}]

So also, clinical trials in ARPKD evaluating the\nefficacy of novel drug candidates could benefit from serial determination of\nCI. Although ultrasound is currently the imaging modality of choice for\ndiagnosis of ARPKD, its utilization for assessing disease progression is highly\nlimited. Magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, although more\nreliable for determination of CI, are expensive, time-consuming and somewhat\nimpractical in the pediatric population. Using a well-established mammalian\nmodel of ARPKD, we undertook a big data-like analysis of minimally- or\nnon-invasive serum and urine biomarkers of renal injury/dysfunction to derive a\nfamily of equations for estimating CI. We then applied a signal averaging\nprotocol to distill these equations to a single empirical formula for\ncalculation of CI. Such a formula will eventually find use in identifying and\nmonitoring patients at high risk for progressing to end-stage renal disease and\naid in the conduct of clinical trials.\n","Comment: 3 tables and 8 figures"]}]

However the size and slow rotation of these galaxies appear\ninsufficient to support a mean-field dynamo action to excite such fields. Here\nwe suggest a new mechanism to explain large-scale magnetic fields in galaxies\nthat are too small to support mean-field dynamo action. The key idea is that we\ndo not identify large-scale and mean magnetic fields. In our scenario the the\nmagnetic structures originate from a small-scale dynamo which produces\nsmall-scale magnetic field in the galactic disc and a galactic wind that\ntransports this field into the galactic halo where the large turbulent\ndiffusion increases the scale and order of the field. As a result, the magnetic\nfield becomes large-scale; however its mean value remains vanishing in a strict\nsense. We verify the idea by numerical modelling of two distinct simplified\nconfigurations, a thin disc model using the no-$z$ approximation, and an\naxisymmetric model using cylindrical $r,z$ coordinates. Each of these allows\nreduction of the problem to two spatial dimensions. Taken together, the models\nsupport the proposition that the general trends will persist in a fully 3D\nmodel.

The presence of higher-isospin scalars contributing to\nelectroweak symmetry breaking offers the interesting possibility that the\ncouplings of the 125 GeV Higgs boson to both gluons and vector boson pairs\ncould be larger than those of the Standard Model Higgs boson. Constraining this\npossibility using measurements of Higgs production and decay at the CERN Large\nHadron Collider is notoriously problematic if a new, non-Standard Model decay\nmode of the 125 GeV Higgs boson is present. We study an implementation of this\nscenario in which the Georgi-Machacek model is extended by a real singlet\nscalar dark matter candidate, and require that the singlet scalar account for\nall the dark matter in the universe. The combination of the observed dark\nmatter relic density and direct detection constraints exclude singlet scalar\nmasses below about 57 GeV. Higgs measurements are not yet precise enough to be\nvery sensitive to $h\\rightarrow SS$ in the remaining allowed kinematic region,\nso that constraints from Higgs measurements are so far the same as in the GM\nmodel without a singlet scalar. We also find that, above the Higgs pole, a\nsubstantial region of parameter space yielding the correct dark matter relic\ndensity can escape the near-future direct detection experiments DEAP and\nXENON~1T for dark matter masses as low as 120 GeV and even have a direct\ndetection cross section below the neutrino floor for $m_S\\gtrsim 150$ GeV. This\nis in contrast to the singlet scalar dark matter extension of the Standard\nModel, for which these future experiments are expected to exclude dark matter\nmasses above the Higgs pole up to the multi-TeV range.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 8 figures"]}]

Intuitively,\nthis approach suffers from scalability limitations as it creates bottlenecks in\nthe network, due to sub-optimal routing via the anchor point.

To understand the origin of this contrasting\nbehavior, in this work we model brushes made of these two types of linear chain\nmolecules using quantum mechanical numerical simulations under the Density\nFunctional Theory at the B97D/6-31G(d,p)level of theory. Four chains of\nerucamide and behenamide were linked to a 2X10 zigzag graphene sheet and\noptimized both in vacuum and in continuous solvent using the SMD implicit\nsolvation model.

It is argued that this arrangement of the erucamide\nchains is responsible for the lower friction coefficient of erucamide brushes,\ncompared with behenamide brushes, which is a macroscopic consequence of\ncooperative quantum mechanical interactions. While only quantum level\ninteractions are modeled here, we show that behenamide chains are more spread\nout in the brush than erucamide chains as a consequence of those interactions.\nThe spread out configuration allows more solvent particles to penetrate the\nbrush, leading in turn to more friction, in agreement with macroscopic\nmeasurements and mesoscale simulations of the friction coefficient reported in\nthe literature.\n","Comment: To appear in The Journal of Physical Chemistry A"]}]

The ions responsible for\nforming the observed X-ray absorption lines may only exist in relatively cold\nclumps that can be identified with the so-called 'warm absorbers'. Here we\ncalculate synthetic absorption lines for such warm absorbers from first\nprinciples by combining 2D hydrodynamic solutions of a two-phase medium with a\ndense grid of photoionization models to determine the detailed ionization\nstructure of the gas. Our calculations reveal that cloud disruption, which\nleads to a highly complicated velocity field (i.e. a clumpy flow), will only\nmildly affect line shapes and strengths when the cold gas becomes highly mixed\nbut not depleted. Prior to complete disruption, clouds which are optically thin\nto the driving UV resonance lines will cause absorption at an increasingly\nblueshifted line of sight velocity as they are accelerated. This behavior will\nimprint an identifiable signature on the line profile if warm absorbers are\nenshrouded in an even broader absorption line produced by a high column of\nintercloud gas. Interestingly, we show that it is possible to develop a\nspectral diagnostic for cloud acceleration by differencing the absorption\ncomponents of a doublet line, a result which can be qualitatively understood\nusing a simple partial covering model.

We modeled a 2-dimensional disk with a steady accretion flow onto the\ncentral star and embed a Jupiter mass planet at 5.2 au. The disk is locally\nisothermal and viscosity is modeled using a constant $\\alpha$. The planet is\nheld on a fixed orbit for a few hundred orbits to allow the disk to adapt and\ncarve a gap. After this period, the planet is released and free to move\naccording to the gravitational interaction with the gas disk. The mass\naccretion onto the planet is modeled by removing a fraction of gas from the\ninner Hill sphere, and the removed mass and momentum can be added to the\nplanet. Our results show that a fast migrating planet is able to accrete more\ngas than a slower migrating planet. Utilizing a tracer fluid we analyzed the\norigin of the accreted gas which comes predominantly originating from the inner\ndisk for a fast migrating planet. In case of slower migration the fraction of\ngas from the outer disk increases. We also found that even for very high\naccretion rates in some cases gas crosses the planetary gap from the inner to\nthe outer disk. Our simulations show that the crossing of gas changes during\nthe migration process as the migration rate slows down.

Interferometry does not detect a\ncompanion and sets upper limits on the companion mass of 0.2, 0.35, 0.1 and\n0.05 M_sun at projected physical separations of 0.1-4 AU,4-5 AU, 5-10 AU, and\n10-30 AU, respectively (assuming a distance of 120.9 pc). Our mid-IR\nmeasurements, the first of the system since 2012, are consistent with the\ndepleted dust level seen after 2009. The new data confirms that stellar\nactivity is unlikely to destroy the dust in the disk and shows that scenarios\nwhere either TYC 8241 2652 1 heats the disk of a binary companion or a\npotential companion heats the disk of TYC 8241 2652 1 are unlikely.\n","Comment: accepted by A&A"]}]

The Sun and solar-like stars undergo activity cycles for which the\nunderlying mechanisms are not well understood.

Kepler has detected oscillations in\nhundreds of solar-like stars but as of yet, no widespread detection of\nsignatures of magnetic activity cycles in the oscillation parameters of these\nstars have been reported.\n  Aims. We analyse the photometric short cadence Kepler time series of a set of\n24 solar-like stars, which were observed for at least 960 days each, with the\naim to find signatures of stellar magnetic activity in the oscillation\nparameters.\n  Methods. We analyse the temporal evolution of oscillation parameters by\nmeasuring mode frequency shifts, changes in the height of the p-mode envelope,\nas well as granulation time scales.\n  Results. For 23 of the 24 investigated stars, we find significant frequency\nshifts in time. We present evidence for magnetic activity in six of them.

In wireless communication systems, inter-symbol\ninterference (ISI) caused by multipath propagation is one of the main obstacles\nto achieve high bit transmission rate and low bit error rate (BER).

We demonstrate through numerical\nsimulations that the stochastic reconnection is able to self-generate\nturbulence through interactions between its outflows. We analyze the\nstatistical properties of velocity fluctuations using power spectra and\nanisotropy scaling, which demonstrates that the reconnection produces\nKolmogorov-like turbulence, compatible with Goldreich-Sridhar (1995) model.\nAnisotropy statistics are, however, strongly affected by the dynamics of\nreconnection outflows. Once the broad turbulent region is formed, the typical\nanisotropy scaling $l_\\parallel \\propto l_\\perp^{2/3}$ is formed, especially\nfor high resolution models, were the broader range of scales is available. The\ndecay of reconnection outflows to turbulent-like fluctuations, characterized by\ndifferent anisotropy scalings, strongly depends on $\\beta$ plasma. Moreover,\nthe estimated reconnection rates are weakly dependent on the resolution,\nsuggesting that no external processes are required to make reconnection fast.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 9 figures"]}]

Going\n  beyond the traditional approximation"],"description":["  Context. As of today, asteroseismology mainly allows us to probe the internal\nrotation of stars when modes are only weakly affected by rotation using\nperturbative methods. Such methods cannot be applied to rapidly rotating stars,\nwhich exhibit complex oscillation spectra. In this context, the so-called\ntraditional approximation, which neglects the terms associated with the\nlatitudinal component of the rotation vector, describes modes that are strongly\naffected by rotation. This approximation is sometimes used for interpreting\nasteroseismic data, however, its domain of validity is not established yet.\n  Aims. We aim at deriving analytical prescriptions for period spacings of\nlow-frequency gravity modes strongly affected by rotation through the full\nCoriolis acceleration, which can be used to probe stellar internal structure\nand rotation.\n  Methods. We approximated the asymptotic theory of gravito-inertial waves in\nuniformly rotating stars using ray theory described in a previous paper in the\nlow-frequency regime, where waves are trapped near the equatorial plane. We put\nthe equations of ray dynamics into a separable form and used the EBK\nquantisation method to compute modes frequencies from rays.\n  Results. Two spectral patterns that depend on stratification and rotation are\npredicted within this new approximation: one for axisymmetric modes and one for\nnon-axisymmetric modes.\n  Conclusions. The detection of the predicted patterns in observed oscillation\nspectra would give constraints on internal rotation and chemical stratification\nof rapidly rotating stars exhibiting gravity modes, such as $\\gamma$ Doradus,\nSPB, or Be stars. The obtained results have a mathematical form that is similar\nto that of the traditional approximation, but the new approximation takes the\nfull Coriolis, which allows for propagation near the centre, and centrifugal\naccelerations into account.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

It\nis widely accepted that flares are powered by magnetic reconnection in the\ncorona. An eruptive flare is usually accompanied by a coronal mass ejection,\nboth of which are probably driven by the eruption of a magnetic flux rope\n(MFR). Here we report an eruptive flare on 2016 March 23 observed by the\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The\nextreme-ultraviolet imaging observations exhibit the clear rise and eruption of\nan MFR. In particular, the observations reveal solid evidence for magnetic\nreconnection from both the corona and chromosphere during the flare. Moreover,\nweak reconnection is observed before the start of the flare. We find that the\npreflare weak reconnection is of tether-cutting type and helps the MFR to rise\nslowly. Induced by a further rise of the MFR, strong reconnection occurs in the\nrise phases of the flare, which is temporally related to the MFR eruption. We\nalso find that the magnetic reconnection is more of 3D-type in the early phase,\nas manifested in a strong-to-weak shear transition in flare loops, and becomes\nmore 2D-like in the later phase, as shown by the apparent rising motion of an\narcade of flare loops.\n","Comment: ApJ accepted.

In\nparticular, we discuss the ability of clumps to form massive stars: we estimate\nthe fraction of distant sources that are classified as high-mass stars-forming\nobjects due to their position in the mass vs radius diagram, that are only\n\"false positives\". We give also a threshold for high-mass star-formation\n$M>1282 \\ \\left(\\frac{r}{[\\mathrm{pc}]}\\right)^{1.42} M_{\\odot}$.

Isochrones which fit the parallax stars were used\nto determine the distances and ages of nine globular clusters (with -2.4 <=\n[Fe/H] <= -1.9$). Averaging together the age of all nine clusters, leads to an\nabsolute age of the oldest, most metal-poor globular clusters of 12.7+/- 1.0\nGyr, where the quoted uncertainty takes into account the known uncertainties in\nthe stellar models and isochrones, along with the uncertainty in the distance\nand reddening of the clusters.\n","Comment: 37 pages, 10 figures"]}]

Much of this may be caused\nby the requirement that the gravitational sphere of influence of the black hole\nmust be resolved for the black-hole mass to be reliably estimated. We revisit\nthis issue by using a comprehensive galaxy evolution semi-analytic model, which\nself-consistently evolves supermassive black holes from high-redshift seeds via\ngas accretion and mergers, and also includes AGN feedback. Once tuned to\nreproduce the (mean) correlation of black-hole mass with velocity dispersion,\nthe model is unable to also account for the correlation with stellar mass. This\nbehaviour is independent of the model's parameters, thus suggesting an internal\ninconsistency in the data. The predicted distributions, especially at the\nlow-mass end, are also much broader than observed. However, if selection\neffects are included, the model's predictions tend to align with the\nobservations. We also demonstrate that the correlations between the residuals\nof the local scaling relations are as effective as the scaling relations\nthemselves at constraining AGN feedback models. In fact, we find that our\nsemi-analytic model, while in apparent broad agreement with the scaling\nrelations when accounting for selection biases, yields very weak correlations\nbetween their residuals at fixed stellar mass, in stark contrast with\nobservations.

Two DER integration models are considered: (i) a\ndecentralized model involving behind-the-meter DERs in a net metering setting,\nand (ii) a centralized model involving DERs integrated by the retailer.

While Weyl\nfermion quasiparticles exist only when the chemical potential is located\nbetween two saddle points of the Weyl cone features, the Fermi arc states\nextend in a larger energy scale and are robust across the bulk Lifshitz\ntransitions associated with the recombination of two non-trivial Fermi surfaces\nenclosing one Weyl point into a single trivial Fermi surface enclosing two Weyl\npoints of opposite chirality. Therefore, in some systems (e.g. NbP),\ntopological Fermi arc states are preserved even if Weyl fermion quasiparticles\nare absent in the bulk.

The assumption about\nthe unavailability of the knowledge of the physical coordinates of the nodes\ntruly captures the `ad-hoc' nature of wireless networks.\n  Previous work in this area uses a flavor of a technique called dilution, in\nwhich nodes transmit in a (predetermined) round-robin fashion, and are able to\nreach all their neighbors. However, without knowing the physical coordinates,\nit's not possible to know the coordinates of their containing (pivotal) grid\nbox and seemingly not possible to use dilution (to coordinate their\ntransmissions).

In this\nwork, we strengthen the realm of ERM for SCO by exploiting smoothness and\nstrong convexity conditions to improve the risk bounds. First, we establish an\n$\\widetilde{O}(d/n + \\sqrt{F_*/n})$ risk bound when the random function is\nnonnegative, convex and smooth, and the expected function is Lipschitz\ncontinuous, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the problem, $n$ is the number\nof samples, and $F_*$ is the minimal risk.

Second, if\nthe objective function is also $\\lambda$-strongly convex, we prove an\n$\\widetilde{O}(d/n + \\kappa F_*/n )$ risk bound where $\\kappa$ is the condition\nnumber, and improve it to $O(1/[\\lambda n^2] + \\kappa F_*/n)$ when\n$n=\\widetilde{\\Omega}(\\kappa d)$.

Transmission\nspectra lack an absolute normalization due to the a priori unknown value of a\nreference transit radius, which is tied to an unknown reference pressure. We\nshow that there is a degeneracy between the uncertainty in the transit radius,\nthe assumed value of the reference pressure (typically set to 10 bar) and the\ninferred value of the water abundance when interpreting a WFC3 transmission\nspectrum. Second, we demonstrate that transmission spectra may be assumed to be\nisobaric, which simplifies the data analysis. We validate the isothermal,\nisobaric analytical formula for the transmission spectrum against full\nnumerical calculations and show that the typical errors are $\\sim 0.1\\%$ ($\\sim\n10$ ppm) within the WFC3 range of wavelengths. Third, we generalize the\nprevious formula for the transit radius to include a small temperature\ngradient. Finally, we analyze the measured WFC3 transmission spectrum of\nWASP-12b and demonstrate that we obtain consistent results with the retrieval\napproach of Kreidberg et al.

One scenario is that super-Earths\nform in a gas-rich disk, and they interact gravitationally with the surrounding\ngas, inducing their orbital migration. Disk migration theory predicts, however,\nthat planets would end up at resonant orbits due to their differential\nmigration speed. Motivated by the discrepancy between observation and theory,\nwe seek for a mechanism that moves planets out of resonances. We examine the\norbital evolution of planet pairs near the magnetospheric cavity during the gas\ndisk dispersal phase. Our study determines the conditions under which planets\ncan escape resonances. We perform two-planet N-body simulations, varying the\nplanet masses, stellar magnetic field strengths, disk accretion rates and gas\ndisk depletion timescales. As planets migrate outward with the expanding\nmagnetospheric cavity, their dynamical configurations can be rearranged.\nMigration of planets is substantial (minor) in a massive (light) disk. When the\nouter planet is more massive than the inner planet, the period ratio of two\nplanets increases through outward migration. On the other hand, when the inner\nplanet is more massive, the final period ratio tends to remain similar to the\ninitial one. Larger stellar magnetic field strengths result in planets stopping\ntheir migration at longer periods. We highlight \\textit{magnetospheric rebound}\nas an important ingredient able to reconcile disk migration theory with\nobservations.
