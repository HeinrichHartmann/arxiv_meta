In order to disentangle the evolution of galaxy\nkinematics from low resolution effects, we have used Fabry-Perot 3D Ha\ndata-cubes of 153 nearby isolated galaxies from the GHASP survey to simulate\ndata-cubes of galaxies at z=1.7. We show that the inner velocity gradient is\nlowered and is responsible for a peak in the velocity dispersion map.\nToy-models of rotating disks have been built to recover the parameters from low\nresolution data. The poor resolution makes the kinematical inclination\nuncertain and the center difficult to recover. The major axis is retrieved with\nan accuracy higher than 5deg for 70% of the sample. Toy-models also enable to\nretrieve statistically the maximum velocity and the mean velocity dispersion of\ngalaxies with a satisfying accuracy. This validates the use of the Tully-Fisher\nrelation for high-z galaxies but the loss of resolution induces a lower slope\nat high-z.

This paper presents and\nanalyses the performance of a 3D lattice Boltzmann solver, optimized for third\ngeneration nVidia GPU hardware, also known as `Kepler'. We provide a review of\nprevious optimisation strategies and analyse data read/write times for\ndifferent memory types. In LBM, the time propagation step (known as streaming),\ninvolves shifting data to adjacent locations and is central to parallel\nperformance; here we examine three approaches which make use of different\nhardware options. Two of which make use of `performance enhancing' features of\nthe GPU; shared memory and the new shuffle instruction found in Kepler based\nGPUs. These are compared to a standard transfer of data which relies instead on\noptimised storage to increase coalesced access. It is shown that the more\nsimple approach is most efficient; since the need for large numbers of\nregisters per thread in LBM limits the block size and thus the efficiency of\nthese special features is reduced. Detailed results are obtained for a D3Q19\nLBM solver, which is benchmarked on nVidia K5000M and K20C GPUs. In the latter\ncase the use of a read-only data cache is explored, and peak performance of\nover 1036 Million Lattice Updates Per Second (MLUPS) is achieved.

In this paper, we obtain a new\nclass of variance reduction methods for treating stochastic equations, called\nparallel optimized sampling. The objective of parallel optimized sampling is to\nreduce the sampling variance in the observables of an ensemble of stochastic\ntrajectories. This is achieved through calculating a finite set of observables\n- typically statistical moments - in parallel, and minimizing the errors\ncompared to known values. The algorithm is both numerically efficient and\nunbiased. Importantly, it does not increase the errors in higher order moments,\nand generally reduces such errors as well. The same procedure is applied both\nto initial ensembles and to changes in a finite time-step. Results of these\nmethods show that errors in initially optimized moments can be reduced to the\nmachine precision level, typically around 10^(-16) in current hardware. For\nnonlinear stochastic equations, sampled moment errors during time-evolution are\nlarger than this, due to error propagation effects. Even so, we provide\nevidence for error reductions of up to two orders of magnitude in a nonlinear\nequation example, for low order moments, which is a large practical benefit.\nThe sampling variance typically scales as 1/N_S, but with the advantage of a\nvery much smaller prefactor than for standard, non-optimized methods.\n","Comment: 32 pages"]}]

For better understanding this theory, we discuss here in more\ndetails the new concept of Misrepair and the concept of accumulation of\nMisrepairs. I. Aging takes place uniquely on the systems that have a\nwell-defined structure: an organization of its sub-structures. Aging of a\nnon-living system is a result of accumulation of injuries (damage) of its\nstructure. II. A generalized concept of Misrepair is important for reaching to\na unified understanding of aging changes. In the situation of a severe injury,\nincorrect repair is a repair essential for maintaining structural integrity for\nincreasing the surviving chance of an organism. With the same mechanism as that\nin \"Misrepair of DNA\" , the term of \"Misrepair\" can be used for describing all\nkinds of incorrect repairs on different types of living structures, including\nmolecules, cells and tissues. A new concept of Misrepair is therefore proposed\nand defined as incorrect reconstruction of an injured living structure.\nMisrepair mechanism is beneficial for the survival of an organism, and it is\nessential for the survival of a species. III. Alteration of structure made by\nMisrepair is irreversible; therefore Misrepairs accumulate and disorganize\ngradually a structure, which appears as aging of it. Accumulation of Misrepairs\ntakes place on molecular, cellular and tissue levels respectively: on tissue\nlevel, it appears as disorganization of cells and extracellular matrixes\n(ECMs); on cellular level, it appears as deformation of cytoskeleton and change\nof cell shape; and on DNA, it appears as accumulation of DNA mutations and\nalteration of DNA sequence. An essential change in aging of an organism is an\nirreversible change of the spatial relationship between cells/ECMs in a tissue.\nIn conclusion, aging of an organism is a result of accumulation of Misrepairs\non tissue level.\n"]}]

The\nmanufacture of this magnetic carbon, having (3.97 x 0.8) 10^17 spins/ mg, can\nimmediately benefit a number of spintronic and magnetic MEMS applications, and\nalso shed light on the controversial theories concerning the existence and\nmechanisms of magnetism in carbon.\n"]}]

Here we survey recent results on how simple\nhashing schemes based on tabulation provide unexpectedly strong guarantees.\n  Simple tabulation hashing dates back to Zobrist [1970]. Keys are viewed as\nconsisting of $c$ characters and we have precomputed character tables\n$h_1,...,h_c$ mapping characters to random hash values. A key $x=(x_1,...,x_c)$\nis hashed to $h_1[x_1] \\oplus h_2[x_2].....\\oplus h_c[x_c]$. This schemes is\nvery fast with character tables in cache. While simple tabulation is not even\n4-independent, it does provide many of the guarantees that are normally\nobtained via higher independence, e.g., linear probing and Cuckoo hashing.\n  Next we consider twisted tabulation where one input character is \"twisted\" in\na simple way. The resulting hash function has powerful distributional\nproperties: Chernoff-Hoeffding type tail bounds and a very small bias for\nmin-wise hashing. This also yields an extremely fast pseudo-random number\ngenerator that is provably good for many classic randomized algorithms and\ndata-structures.\n  Finally, we consider double tabulation where we compose two simple tabulation\nfunctions, applying one to the output of the other, and show that this yields\nvery high independence in the classic framework of Carter and Wegman [1977]. In\nfact, w.h.p., for a given set of size proportional to that of the space\nconsumed, double tabulation gives fully-random hashing.

Potential of longevity is the maximum\nlongevity of a species if the individuals live in an ideal environment.\nLongevity of an organism includes two parts: the time for development (mature\ntime) and the time for structure-maintenance (maintaining time). II. The mature\ntime for an organism depends on its structural complexity. The maintaining time\nfor an organism is related to two factors, the degree of damage-exposure and\nthe potential of functionality for structure-maintenance. Potential of\nfunctionality include two parts: the capacity of basic functionality and the\npotential of functional compensation. The capacity of basic functionality is\nbuilt in the structural complexity of the organism. However, the structural\ncomplexity and the functionality of an organism will be reduced gradually with\nage by the accumulation of Misrepairs. Functional compensation can slow down\nthe decline of functionality during aging by two mechanisms: functional\nsubstitution and regeneration of cells, and theses two functions are also built\nin the structural complexity. The potential of longevity of an organism is\ntherefore hidden in its structural complexity, which is determined by the gene\nconfiguration. III. An animal has limited longevity because it has limited\nstructural complexity. Limited structural complexity and limited longevity are\nessential for the survival of a species. IV.

The presented formulation is\ncapable of simulating non-trivial surface shapes associated with tube formation\nand protein-induced budding of lipid bilayers.

(2011) exhibits an overabundance of\nshort-timescale events (STEs; t_E<2 days) relative to what is expected from\nknown stellar populations and a smooth power-law extrapolation down to the\nbrown dwarf regime. This excess has been interpreted as a population of\n~Jupiter-mass objects that outnumber main-sequence stars by nearly twofold;\nhowever the microlensing data alone cannot distinguish between events due to\nwide-separation (a>~10 AU) and free-floating planets. Assuming these STEs are\nindeed due to planetary-mass objects, we aim to constrain the fraction of these\nevents that can be explained by bound but wide-separation planets. We fit the\nobserved timescale distribution with a lens mass function comprised of brown\ndwarfs, main-sequence stars, and stellar remnants, finding and thus\ncorroborating the initial identification of an excess of STEs. We then include\na population of bound planets that are expected not to show signatures of the\nprimary lens (host) in their microlensing light curves and that are also\nconsistent with results from representative microlensing, radial velocity, and\ndirect imaging surveys. We find that bound planets alone cannot explain the\nentire STE excess without violating the constraints from the surveys we\nconsider and thus some fraction of these events must be due to free-floating\nplanets, if our model for bound planets holds. We estimate a median fraction of\nSTEs due to free-floating planets to be f=0.67 (0.23-0.85 at 95% confidence)\nwhen assuming \"hot-start\" planet evolutionary models and f=0.58 (0.14-0.83 at\n95% confidence) for \"cold-start\" models.

We have shown that the optimal envelope\nwaveform is a bang-bang-type solution. Also, we have found \"inversion\" symmetry\nthat relates two signals with different powers, but the same interval of\nentrained frequencies.

Two pickup patterns were tested\nusing a small commercial MCP-PMT as the signal source: 1) parallel 50$\\Omega$\n25-cm-long micro-strips with an analog bandwidth of 1.5 GHz, and 2) a 20\n$\\times$ 20 cm$^2$ array of 2-dimensional square `pads' with sides of 1.27 cm\nor 2.54 cm. The rise-time of the fast input pulse is maintained for both pickup\npatterns. For the pad pattern, we observe 80% of the directly coupled\namplitude. For the strip pattern we measure 34% of the directly coupled\namplitude on the central strip of a broadened signal. The physical decoupling\nof the photodetector from the pickup pattern allows easy customization for\ndifferent applications while maintaining high analog bandwidth.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 7 figures"]}]

The jet deposits\n$10^{51}-10^{52}$ erg into this cocoon. This energy is comparable to the GRB's\nenergy and to the energy of the accompanying supernova, yet its signature has\nbeen largely neglected so far. A fraction of the cocoon energy is released\nduring its expansion following the breakout from the star and later as it\ninteracts with the surrounding matter. We explore here the possible signatures\nof the cocoon emission and outline a framework to calculate them from the\nconditions of the cocoon at the time of the jet breakout. We show that the\ncocoon signature depends strongly on the level of mixing between the shocked\njet and shocked stellar material that fills it, which is currently unknown. We\nfind that if there is no mixing at all then the $\\gamma$-ray emission from the\ncocoon is so bright that it should have been already detected, and the lack of\nsuch detections indicates that mixing at some level must take place. We\ncalculate also the expected signal for partial and full mixing. While the\ntypical signals are weaker than GRBs' afterglows, the latter are highly beamed\nwhile the former have wide angles.

It has been speculated that the\nquenched component contained in star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is the reason why\nthe star formation main sequence (MS) has a shallow slope at high masses. In\nthis paper, we present a toy model to quantify the quenched mass portion of\nSFGs ($f_{\\rm Q}$) at fixed stellar mass ($M_{\\ast}$) and to reconcile the MS\nslopes both in the low and the high mass regimes. In this model, each SFG is\ncomposed by a star-forming plus a quenched component. The mass of the\nstar-forming component ($M_{\\rm SF}$) correlates with the star formation rate\n(SFR) following a relation SFR $\\propto M_{\\rm SF}^{\\alpha_{\\rm SF}}$, where\n$\\alpha_{\\rm SF}\\sim 1.0$ . The quenched component contributes to the stellar\nmass but does not to the SFR. It is thus possible to quantify $f_{\\rm Q}$ based\non the departure of the observed MS slope $\\alpha$ from $\\alpha_{\\rm SF}$.\nAdopting the redshift-dependent MS slope reported by \\citet{Whitaker 2014}, we\nexplore the evolution of the $f_{\\rm Q}-M_{\\ast}$ relations over $z=[0.5,2.5]$.\nWe find that Milky-Way mass SFGs (with $M_{\\ast}\\approx 10^{10.7}M_{\\odot}$)\ntypically have a $f_{\\rm Q}=30\\%-40\\%$ at $z\\sim 2.25$, whereas this value\nrapidly rises up to $70\\%-80\\%$ at $z\\sim 0.75$. The origin of an $\\alpha\\sim\n1.0$ MS slope seen in the low mass regime is also discussed. We argue for a\nscenario in which the majority of low mass SFGs stay in a \"steady-stage\" star\nformation phase. In this phase, the SFR is mainly regulated by stellar feedback\nand not significantly influenced by the quenching mechanisms, thus keeping\nroughly constant over cosmic time.

Recently, two\nsuch models have gained wide spread attention, where one was a graphical scheme\nbased on visually inspecting the connectivity of carbon sites in conjugated pi\nsystems in an atomic orbital (AO) basis and the other one put the emphasis on\nthe amplitudes and signs of the frontier molecular orbitals (MOs).

In\nparticular, we argue that most existing methods only focus on a limited number\nof time-related features and neglect others. Furthermore, considering a\nspecific granularity (e.g. time of a day) in recommendation cannot always apply\nto each user or each dataset. To address the challenges, we propose a\nprobabilistic generative model, named after Multi-aspect Time-related Influence\n(MATI) to promote POI recommendation. We also develop a novel optimization\nalgorithm based on Expectation Maximization (EM). Our MATI model firstly\ndetects a user's temporal multivariate orientation using her check-in log in\nLocation-based Social Networks(LBSNs). It then performs recommendation using\ntemporal correlations between the user and proposed locations. Our method is\nadaptable to various types of recommendation systems and can work efficiently\nin multiple time-scales. Extensive experimental results on two large-scale LBSN\ndatasets verify the effectiveness of our method over other competitors.\n"]}]

The rotation curve can be rising, falling or\nflat. The self-consistent power-law disks are scale-free, so that all physical\nquantities vary as a power of radius. They possess simple equilibrium\ndistribution functions depending on the two classical integrals, energy and\nangular momentum. While maintaining the scale-free equilibrium force law, the\npower-law disks can be transformed into cut-out disks by preventing stars close\nto the origin (and sometimes also at large radii) from participating in any\ndisturbance. This paper derives the homogeneous Fredholm integral equation for\nthe in-plane normal modes in the self-consistent and the cut-out power-law\ndisks. This is done by linearising the collisionless Boltzmann equation to find\nthe response density corresponding to any imposed density and potential. The\nnormal modes -- that is, the self-consistent modes of oscillation -- are found\nby requiring the imposed density to equal the response density. In practice,\nthis scheme is implemented in Fourier space, by decomposing both imposed and\nresponse densities in logarithmic spirals. The Fredholm integral equation then\nrelates the transform of the imposed density to the transform of the response\ndensity. Numerical strategies to solve the integral equation and to isolate the\ngrowth rates and the pattern speeds of the normal modes are discussed.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 9 figures, in press at Monthly Notices"]}]

These techniques are found to produce a\nconsistent estimate for the halo shape, with a shortest-to-longest axis ratio\nof q ~ 0.8, but only if one adopts somewhat non-standard values for the\ndistance to the Galactic centre, R_0, and the local Galactic rotation speed,\nTheta_0. For consistency, one requires values of R_0 < 7.6 kpc and Theta_0 <\n190 km/s. Although differing significantly from the current IAU-sanctioned\nvalues, these upper limits are consistent with all existing observational\nconstraints. If future measurements confirm these lower values for the Galactic\nconstants, then the validity of the gas layer flaring method will be confirmed.\nFurther, dark matter candidates such as cold molecular gas and massive decaying\nneutrinos, which predict very flat dark halos with q < 0.2, will be ruled out.\nConversely, if the Galactic constants were found to be close to the more\nconventional values, then there would have to be some systematic error in the\nmethods for measuring dark halo shapes, so the existing modeling techniques\nwould have to be viewed with some scepticism.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS. 10 pages, 6 figures, uses mn.sty\n  and epsf.sty"]}]
