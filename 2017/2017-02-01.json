So\nfar most of the work has been for lattices with open boundary conditions in at\nleast one of the two directions, but it is desirable to also be able to handle\nthe case of periodic boundary conditions. Here, we take steps in this direction\nby deriving analytical expressions for a family of conformal field theory\nstates on the torus that is closely related to the family of bosonic and\nfermionic Laughlin states. We compute how the states transform when a particle\nis moved around the torus and when the states are translated or rotated, and we\nprovide numerical evidence in particular cases that the states become\northonormal up to a common factor for large lattices. We use these results to\nfind the S-matrix of the states, which turns out to be the same as for the\ncontinuum Laughlin states. Finally, we show that when the states are defined on\na square lattice with suitable lattice spacing they practically coincide with\nthe Laughlin states restricted to a lattice.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 1 figure, v2: accepted version"]}]

Recently, following the theoretical prediction [J. \\v{Z}elezn\\'y et\nal., PRL 113, 157201 (2014)], the electrical switching of magnetic moments in\nan antiferromagnet has been demonstrated [P. Wadley et al., Science 351, 587\n(2016)]. The switching is due to the so-called spin-orbit torque, which has\nbeen extensively studied in ferromagnets. In this phenomena a non-equilibrium\nspin-polarization exchange coupled to the ordered local moments is induced by\ncurrent, hence exerting a torque on the order parameter. Here we give a general\nsystematic analysis of the symmetry of the spin-orbit torque in locally and\nglobally non-centrosymmetric crystals. We study when the symmetry allows for a\nnonzero torque, when is the torque effective, and its dependence on the applied\ncurrent direction and orientation of magnetic moments. For comparison, we\nconsider both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic orders.

This corresponds to a directed probabilistic\nmodel where the coarse variables play the role of latent generators of the fine\nscale (all-atom) data. From an information-theoretic perspective, the framework\nproposed provides an improvement upon the relative entropy method and is\ncapable of quantifying the uncertainty due to the information loss that\nunavoidably takes place during the CG process. Furthermore, it can be readily\nextended to a fully Bayesian model where various sources of uncertainties are\nreflected in the posterior of the model parameters.

Although\nthese states have been shown to be sensitive to interaction details, the effect\nof anisotropy on quantum resonances has eluded experimental observation so far.\nHere, we directly measure the anisotropy in atom-molecule interactions via\nquantum resonances by changing the quantum state of the internal molecular\nrotor.

We also\ndemonstrate how to adapt a standard optimization method to the proposed\nformulation in order to obtain a substantial reduction in computational cost.\n  We investigate the potential of the proposed planning objectives as tools for\noptimizing DVH statistics through juxtaposition with the conventional planning\nobjectives on two patient cases. Sets of treatment plans with differently\nbalanced planning objectives are generated using either the proposed or the\nconventional approach. Dominance in the sense of better distributed\ndoses-at-volume is observed in plans optimized within the proposed framework,\nindicating that the DVH statistics are better optimized and more efficiently\nbalanced using the proposed planning objectives.\n"]}]

Therefore, aptamers are largely employed for producing label-free\nbiosensors, with significant applications in diagnostics and drug delivery. In\nparticular, the anti-thrombin aptamers are biomolecules of high interest for\nclinical use, because of their ability to recognize and bind the thrombin\nenzyme. Among them, the DNA 15-mer thrombin-binding aptamer (TBA), has been\nwidely explored concerning both its structure, which was resolved with\ndifferent techniques, and its function, especially about the possibility of\nusing it as the active part of biosensors. This paper proposes a microscopic\nmodel of the electrical properties of TBA and the aptamer-thrombin complex,\ncombining information from both structure and function. The novelty consists in\ndescribing both the aptamer alone and the complex as an impedance network, thus\ngoing deeper inside the issues addressed in an emerging electronics branch\nknown as proteotronics.

This\nsuggests that the solutions to the nonlinear wave equation can be metastable\nover these sets, in the sense that they spend long periods of time in these\nsets and only rarely transition between them. Here we quantify this phenomenon\nby calculating exactly via Transition State Theory (TST) the mean frequency at\nwhich the solutions of the nonlinear wave equation with initial conditions\ndrawn from its invariant measure cross a dividing surface lying in between the\nmetastable sets. Numerical results suggest that the dynamics of the nonlinear\nwave equation is ergodic and rapidly mixing with respect to the Gibbs invariant\nmeasure when the parameter $\\delta$ in small enough. This is a regime in which\nthe dynamics of the nonlinear wave equation displays a metastable behavior that\nis not fundamentally different from that observed in its stochastic counterpart\nin which random noise and damping terms are added to the equation. For larger\n$\\delta$, however, the dynamics either stops being ergodic, or its mixing time\nbecomes larger than the inverse of the TST frequency, indicating that\nsuccessive transitions between the metastable sets are correlated and the\ncoarse-graining to a Markov chain fails.\n","Comment: 30 pages"]}]

However, the infection\nrate between a pair of nodes is usually heterogeneous and even correlated with\ntheir nodal degrees in the contact network. We aim to understand how such\ncorrelated heterogeneous infection rates influence the spreading on different\nnetwork topologies.

In order to understand the effect of such\ncorrelation on epidemic spreading, we consider as well the corresponding\nuncorrected but still heterogeneous infection rate scenario as a reference,\nwhere the original correlated infection rates in our CSIS model are shuffled\nand reallocated to the links of the same network topology.

The well-balanced scheme\nhere is defined as a method to evolve an isolated gravitational system under\nany initial condition to an isothermal hydrostatic equilibrium state and to\nkeep such a solution. To preserve such a property is important for a numerical\nscheme, which can be used for the study of slowly evolving gravitational\nsystem, such as the formation of star and galaxy.

As\na result, with the varia- tion of the ratio between the numerical time step and\nlocal particle collision time, the UGKS is able to recover flow physics in\ndifferent regimes and provides a continuum spectrum of gas dynamics.

The method uses a distribution function $f(\\mathcal{E},L)$ to model\nthe galaxy and kinematic data from satellite objects such as globular clusters\n(GCs) to trace the Galaxy's gravitational potential. A major advantage of the\nmethod is that it not only includes complete and incomplete data simultaneously\nin the analysis, but also incorporates measurement uncertainties in a coherent\nand meaningful way. We first test the hierarchical Bayesian framework, which\nincludes measurement uncertainties, using the same data and power-law model\nassumed in Eadie & Harris (2016), and find the results are similar but more\nstrongly constrained. Next, we take advantage of the new statistical framework\nand incorporate all possible GC data, finding a cumulative mass profile with\nBayesian credible regions.

In the framework of the implementation of\nthe photo-z algorithm for Euclid, we are exploring new avenues to improve\ntemplate-fitting methods. The paper focusses on the prescription of the\nextinction of source light by dust in the Milky Way. Since Galactic extinction\nstrongly correlates with wavelength and photometry is commonly obtained in\nbroad-band filters, the amount of absorption depends on the source SED, a point\noften neglected as the SED is not known a-priori. A consequence of this is that\nthe observed E(B-V) (=A_B-A_V) will be different from the E(B-V) used to\nnormalise the absorption law k_lambda (=A_lambda/E(B-V)). Band-pass corrections\nare required to renormalise the law for a given SED. We assess the band-pass\ncorrections of a range of SEDs and find they vary by up to 20%.

An inaccurate correction of extinction critically\naffects photo-z. In particular, for high extinctions and z<0.5, the bias (mean\nD_z=z_phot-z_real) exceeds 0.2%(1+z), the precision required by weak-lensing\nanalyses. Additional uncertainty on the MW extinction law further reduces the\nphoto-z precision.

We have considered a sample of about 130000\ngalaxies and a SN sample of about 50 events. We found that the SN Ia rate per\nunit mass is higher by a factor of six in the star-forming galaxies with\nrespect to the passive galaxies. The SN Ia rate per unit mass is also higher in\nthe less massive galaxies that are also younger. These results suggest a\ndistribution of the delay times (DTD) less populated at long delay times than\nat short delays. The CC SN rate per unit mass is proportional to both the sSFR\nand the galaxy mass. The trends of the Type Ia and CC SN rates as a function of\nthe sSFR and the galaxy mass that we observed from SUDARE data are in agreement\nwith literature results at different redshifts. The expected number of SNe Ia\nis in agreement with the observed one for all four DTD models considered both\nin passive and star-forming galaxies so we can not discriminate between\ndifferent progenitor scenarios. The expected number of CC SNe is higher than\nthe observed one, suggesting a higher limit for the minimum progenitor mass. We\nalso compare the expected and observed trends of the SN Ia rate with the\nintrinsic U - J colour of the parent galaxy, assumed as a tracer of the age\ndistribution. While the slope of the relation between the SN Ia rate and the U\n- J color in star-forming galaxies can be reproduced well by all four DTD\nmodels considered, only the steepest of them is able to account for the rates\nand colour in star-forming and passive galaxies with the same value of the SN\nIa production efficiency.\n","Comment: A& A accepted"]}]

The helium lines\nhave two components: a broad and blue-shifted emission component associated\nwith the EB, and a narrower absorption component formed in the overlying\nchromosphere. One of the EBs in our data shows evidence of strong velocity\ngradients in its emission component. The emission component of the other two\nEBs could be fitted using a constant slab. Our analysis hints towards thermal\nDoppler motions having a large contribution to the broadening for helium and\nIRIS lines.

We find that the different assumptions for how to scale the wind\ntemperature to other stars lead to significantly different mass loss rates for\nthe rapid rotators. If we assume a constant temperature, the mass loss rates of\nsolar mass stars do not saturate at rapid rotation, which we show to be\ninconsistent with observed rotational evolution.

An analysis of 5.5 yr of HE Fermi LAT data gives\nconsistent results ({\\ss}_HE = 1.20 +0.21 -0.23, on time scales larger than 10\ndays) compatible with the VHE findings. The HE and VHE power spectral densities\nshow a scale invariance across the probed time ranges. A direct linear\ncorrelation between the VHE and HE fluxes could neither be excluded nor firmly\nestablished. These long-term-variability properties are discussed and compared\nto the red noise behavior ({\\ss} ~ 2) seen on shorter time scales during\nVHE-flaring states. The difference in power spectral noise behavior at VHE\nenergies during quiescent and flaring states provides evidence that these\nstates are influenced by different physical processes, while the compatibility\nof the HE and VHE long-term results is suggestive of a common physical link as\nit might be introduced by an underlying jet-disk connection.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 16 figures"]}]

The analysis of the photometric components reveals a clear segregation of\nthe structural composition of galaxies with stellar mass. At high masses\n(log(Mstar/Msun)>11), the galaxy population is dominated by galaxies modelled\nwith a single Sersic or a bulge+disc with a bulge-to-total (B/T) luminosity\nratio B/T>0.2. At intermediate masses (9.5<log(Mstar/Msun)<11), galaxies\ndescribed with bulge+disc but B/T < 0.2 are preponderant, whereas, at the low\nmass end (log(Mstar/Msun)<9.5), the prevailing population is constituted by\ngalaxies modelled with either pure discs or nuclear point sources+discs (i.e.,\nno discernible bulge). We obtain that 57% of the volume corrected sample of\ndisc galaxies in the CALIFA sample host a bar. This bar fraction shows a\nsignificant drop with increasing galaxy mass in the range\n9.5<log(Mstar/Msun)<11.5. The analyses of the extended multi-component radial\nprofile result in a volume-corrected distribution of 62%, 28%, and 10% for the\nso-called Type I, Type II, and Type III disc profiles, respectively. These\nfractions are in discordance with previous findings. We argue that the\ndifferent methodologies used to detect the breaks are the main cause for these\ndifferences.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 13 figures. Accepted for publication in A&A.

A\nnatural set of pairs of leaves is provided by any `triplet cover' of the tree\n(based on the fact that each non-leaf vertex is the median vertex of three\nleaves). In this paper we describe a number of new results concerning triplet\ncovers of minimum size. In particular, we characterize such covers in terms of\nan associated graph being a 2-tree. Also, we show that minimum triplet covers\nare `shellable' and thereby provide a set of pairs for which the inter-leaf\ndistance values will uniquely determine the underlying tree and its associated\nbranch lengths.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Thus, BMP stars\nare ideal field blue straggler candidates for investigating internal stellar\nevolution processes and binary interaction.

We find the surprising result that for BIQH states in\ndimension $2m-1$ ($m=1,2,\\dots$), the bulk response to an electromagnetic field\n$A_{\\mu}$ is characterized by a Chern-Simons term for $A_{\\mu}$ with a level\nquantized in integer multiples of $m!$ (factorial).

In this\nwork, we employ the DFT+U formalism to address the effects of local\ncorrelations due to transition metal d electrons on compositional phase\nstability in the prototype phase stable and separating materials LixCoO2 and\nolivine LixFePO4, respectively. We exploit a new spectral decomposition of the\nDFT+U total energy, revealing the distinct roles of the filling and ordering of\nthe d orbital correlated subspace. The on-site interaction U drives both of\nthese very different materials systems towards phase separation, stemming from\nenhanced ordering of the d orbital occupancies in the x=0 and x=1 species,\nwhereas changes in the overall filling of the d shell contribute negligibly. We\nshow that DFT+U formation energies are qualitatively consistent with\nexperiments for phase stable LixCoO2, phase separating LixFePO4, and phase\nstable LixCoPO4. However, we find that charge ordering plays a critical role in\nthe energetics at intermediate x, strongly dampening the tendency for the\nHubbard U to drive phase separation. Most relevantly, the phase stability of\nLi1/2CoO2 within DFT+U is qualitatively incorrect without allowing charge\nordering, which is problematic given that neither charge ordering nor the band\ngap that it induces are observed in experiment. We demonstrate that charge\nordering arises from the correlated subspace interaction energy as opposed to\nthe double counting. Additionally, we predict the Li order-disorder transition\ntemperature for Li1/2CoO2, demonstrating that the unphysical charge ordering\nwithin DFT+U renders the method problematic, often producing unrealistically\nlarge results.

Using weak turbulence simulations, we investigate how solar wind\ndensity turbulence changes the probability distribution functions, mean value\nand variance of the beam-driven electric field distributions. Simulations show\nrather complicated forms of the distribution that are dependent upon how the\nelectric fields are sampled. Generally the higher magnitude of density\nfluctuations reduce the mean and increase the variance of the distribution in a\nconsistent manor to the predictions from resonance broadening by density\nfluctuations. We also demonstrate how the properties of the electric field\ndistribution should vary radially from the Sun to the Earth and provide a\nnumerical prediction for the in-situ measurements of the upcoming Solar Orbiter\nand Solar Probe Plus spacecraft.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 11 figures, published in Astronomy and Astrophysics"]}]

Typically this requires to compute the\nreliability of all the $N$ synthetic channels and then to include those that\nare sufficiently reliable. However, we know from [1], [2] that there is a\npartial order among the synthetic channels. Hence, it is natural to ask whether\nwe can exploit it to reduce the computational burden of the construction\nproblem.\n  We show that, if we take advantage of the partial order [1], [2], we can\nconstruct a polar code by computing the reliability of roughly a fraction\n$1/\\log^{3/2} N$ of the synthetic channels. In particular, we prove that\n$N/\\log^{3/2} N$ is a lower bound on the number of synthetic channels to be\nconsidered and such a bound is tight up to a multiplicative factor $\\log\\log\nN$. This set of roughly $N/\\log^{3/2} N$ synthetic channels is universal, in\nthe sense that it allows one to construct polar codes for any $W$, and it can\nbe identified by solving a maximum matching problem on a bipartite graph.\n  Our proof technique consists of reducing the construction problem to the\nproblem of computing the maximum cardinality of an antichain for a suitable\npartially ordered set.

Feedback from star formation has difficulties halting the process in\ndense gas but can easily remove the less dense and warmer envelopes where star\nformation does not occur. However, the envelopes can play an important role\nkeeping their host clouds bound by deepening the gravitational potential and\nproviding a constraining pressure boundary. We use numerical simulations to\nshow that removal of the cloud envelopes results in all cases in a fall in the\nstar formation efficiency (SFE). At 1.38 free-fall times our 4 pc cloud\nsimulation experienced a drop in the SFE from 16 to six percent, while our 5 pc\ncloud fell from 27 to 16 per cent. At the same time, our 3 pc cloud (the least\nbound) fell from an SFE of 5.67 per cent to zero when the envelope was lost.\nThe star formation efficiency per free-fall time varied from zero to $\\approx$\n0.25 according to $\\alpha$, defined to be the ratio of the kinetic plus thermal\nto gravitational energy, and irrespective of the absolute star forming mass\navailable. Furthermore the fall in SFE associated with the loss of the envelope\nis found to even occur at later times.

For\ncapturing it, a quantum resolution of the classical background - e.g., in terms\nof a coherent state - is required. In this paper, we first consider a simple\nscalar model with anharmonic oscillations and derive its quantum break-time.\nNext, we apply these ideas to de Sitter space. We formulate a simple model of a\nspin-2 field, which for some time reproduces the de Sitter metric and\nsimultaneously allows for its well-defined representation as quantum coherent\nstate of gravitons. The mean occupation number $N$ of background gravitons\nturns out to be equal to the de Sitter horizon area in Planck units, while\ntheir frequency is given by the de Sitter Hubble parameter. In the\nsemi-classical limit, we show that the model reproduces all the known\nproperties of de Sitter, such as the redshift of probe particles and thermal\nGibbons-Hawking radiation, all in the language of quantum $S$-matrix\nscatterings and decays of coherent state gravitons. Most importantly, this\nframework allows to capture the $1/N$-effects to which the usual semi-classical\ntreatment is blind. They violate the de Sitter symmetry and lead to a finite\nquantum break-time of the de Sitter state equal to the de Sitter radius times\n$N$. We also point out that the quantum-break time is inversely proportional to\nthe number of particle species in the theory. Thus, the quantum break-time\nimposes the following consistency condition: Older and species-richer universes\nmust have smaller cosmological constants.

A new flexible method to sample the stellar initial mass function\nallows us to follow the contribution to the ISRF, the metal output and the SN\ndelay times of individual massive stars.

Outflow rates (with\nmass-loading factors of a few) and hot gas fractions of the ISM increase with\nthe number of SNe exploding in low-density environments where radiative energy\nlosses are low. While PE heating alone can suppress star formation slightly\nmore (a factor of a few) than SNe alone can do, it is unable to drive outflows\nand reproduce the multi-phase ISM that emerges naturally when SNe are included.\nThese results are in conflict with recent results of Forbes et al. who\nconcluded that PE heating is the dominant process suppressing star formation in\ndwarfs, about an order of magnitude more efficient than SNe. Potential origins\nfor this discrepancy are discussed. In the absence of SNe and photoionization\n(mechanisms to disperse dense clouds), the impact of PE heating is highly\noverestimated owing to the (unrealistic) proximity of dense gas to the\nradiation sources. This leads to a substantial boost of the infrared continuum\nemission from the UV-irradiated dust and a far infrared line-to-continuum ratio\ntoo low compared to observations.

Unfortunately, visual tracking, a\nfundamental computer vision problem, is not handled well using the existing CNN\nmodels, because most object trackers implemented with CNN do not effectively\nleverage temporal and contextual information among consecutive frames.\nRecurrent neural network (RNN) models, on the other hand, are often used to\nprocess text and voice data due to their ability to learn intrinsic\nrepresentations of sequential and temporal data. Here, we propose a novel\nneural network tracking model that is capable of integrating information over\ntime and tracking a selected target in video. It comprises three components: a\nCNN extracting best tracking features in each video frame, an RNN constructing\nvideo memory state, and a reinforcement learning (RL) agent making target\nlocation decisions. The tracking problem is formulated as a decision-making\nprocess, and our model can be trained with RL algorithms to learn good tracking\npolicies that pay attention to continuous, inter-frame correlation and maximize\ntracking performance in the long run. We compare our model with an existing\nneural-network based tracking method and show that the proposed tracking\napproach works well in various scenarios by performing rigorous validation\nexperiments on artificial video sequences with ground truth.

We show that DSFs are a flexible\nparametric family of submodular functions that share many of the properties and\nadvantages of deep neural networks (DNNs). DSFs can be motivated by considering\na hierarchy of descriptive concepts over ground elements and where one wishes\nto allow submodular interaction throughout this hierarchy.

This implies that,\nlike DNNs, there is a utility to depth, but unlike DNNs, the family of DSFs\nstrictly increase with depth. Despite this, we show (using a \"backpropagation\"\nlike method) that DSFs, even with arbitrarily large $k$, do not comprise all\nsubmodular functions.

One increasingly popular technique is the Nanoparticle Tracking\nAnalysis (NTA), in which the diameters of EVs are calculated from the\nmeasurements of their diffusion constants. The crucial assumption here is that\nthe diffusion of EVs follows the Stokes-Einstein relation, i.e. that the Mean\nSquare Displacement (MSD) of a particle grows linearly in time (MSD $\\propto\nt$). In this letter we show that this relation is severely violated in\nbiological samples. In fact, at intermediate time periods MSD shows strongly\nsub-diffusive behavior (MSD $\\propto t^\\alpha$, $0<\\alpha<1$) and for the\nlonger periods it is affected by the boundary effects.
