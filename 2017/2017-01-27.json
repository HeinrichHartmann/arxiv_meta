Three basic schemes\nand their achievable rates are studied: Decode-and-Forward (DF),\nAmplify-and-Forward (AF), and Compress-and-Forward (CF). For the DF scheme, the\nsource transmits two private signals, one for each relay, where dirty paper\ncoding (DPC) is used between the two private streams, and a common signal for\nboth relays. The relays make efficient use of the common information to\nintroduce a proper amount of correlation in the transmission to the\ndestination. We show that the DF scheme achieves the capacity under certain\nconditions. We also show that the CF scheme is asymptotically optimal in the\nhigh relay power limit, regardless of channel ranks. It turns out that the AF\nscheme also achieves the asymptotic optimality but only when the\nrelays-to-destination channel is full rank.

An intriguing feature of quantum interference arises in a three\nslit experiment. In this set-up, the interference pattern can be written in\nterms of the two and one slit patterns obtained by blocking some of the slits.\nThis is in stark contrast with the standard two slit experiment, where the\ninterference pattern is irreducible. This was first noted by Rafael Sorkin, who\nasked why quantum theory only exhibits irreducible interference in the two slit\nexperiment. One approach to this problem is to compare the predictions of\nquantum theory to those of operationally-defined `foil' theories, in the hope\nof determining whether theories exhibiting higher-order interference suffer\nfrom pathological--or at least undesirable--features. In this paper two\nproposed extensions of quantum theory are considered: the theory of Density\nCubes proposed by Dakic et al., which has been shown to exhibit irreducible\ninterference in the three slit set-up, and the Quartic Quantum Theory of\nZyczkowski. The theory of Density Cubes will be shown to provide an advantage\nover quantum theory in a certain computational task and to posses a\nwell-defined mechanism which leads to the emergence of quantum theory. Despite\nthis, the axioms used to define Density Cubes will be shown to be insufficient\nto uniquely characterise the theory. In comparison, Quartic Quantum Theory is\nwell-defined and we show that it exhibits irreducible interference to all\norders. This feature of the theory is argued not to be a genuine phenomenon,\nbut to arise from an ambiguity in the current definition of higher-order\ninterference. To understand why quantum theory has limited interference\ntherefore, a new operational definition of higher-order interference is needed.\n","Comment: Updated in response to referee comments. 17 pages.

This work explores the\nextent to which an arbitrary insertion-correcting code can take advantage of\nthis fact. Such questions are relevant today, because insertion errors\nfrequently occur in DNA, a medium which is beginning to be used for long term\ndata storage.\n  For a particular codeword $c$ of length $n,$ we are interested in two\nparticular measures. The first is the fraction of received words of length\n$n+t$ which are unique to $c.$ The second is the fraction of insertion\nhistories of length $t$ which give rise to received words of length $n+t$ that\nare unique to $c.$ The first measure is the probability of uniquely decoding\nwhen $t$ insertions occur, if all possible length $n+t$ received words are\nequally likely. The second measure is the probability of uniquely decoding when\n$t$ consecutive insertions occur, and each insertion position and element are\nselected uniformly at random. This paper attempts to better understand the\nbehavior of these measures for arbitrary insertion correcting codes, placing a\nparticular emphasis on limiting behavior as the number of insertions increases,\nor the code-length increases.

We\nperform a suite of 3D MHD AMR simulations of AGN feedback in a cool core\ncluster including cosmic ray (CR) physics. CRs are supplied to the ICM via\ncollimated AGN jets and subsequently disperse in the magnetized ICM via\nstreaming, and interact with the ICM via hadronic, Coulomb, and streaming\ninstability heating.

Moreover, the dynamical state and intermittency of the\ncentral AGN are dramatically altered when CR streaming is present.

X-ray binaries contain accreting neutron stars\nand stellar--mass black holes which are the end points of massive star\nevolution. Studying these remnants thus provides clues to understanding the\nevolutionary processes that lead to their formation. We focus here on the\ndistributions of dynamical masses, space velocities and chemical anomalies of\ntheir companion stars. These three observational features provide unique\ninformation on the physics of core collapse and supernovae explosions within\ninteracting binary systems. There is suggestive evidence for a gap between ~2-5\nMsun in the observed mass distribution. This might be related to the physics of\nthe supernova explosions although selections effects and possible systematics\nmay be important. The difference between neutron star mass measurements in\nlow-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and pulsar masses in high-mass X-ray binaries\n(HMXBs) reflect their different accretion histories, with the latter presenting\nvalues close to birth masses. On the other hand, black holes in LMXBs appear to\nbe limited to <~12 Msun because of strong mass-loss during the wind Wolf-Rayet\nphase. Detailed studies of a limited sample of black-hole X-ray binaries\nsuggest that the more massive black holes have a lower space velocity, which\ncould be explained if they formed through direct collapse. Conversely, the\nformation of low-mass black holes through a supernova explosion implies that\nlarge escape velocities are possible through ensuing natal and/or Blaauw kicks.\nFinally, chemical abundance studies of the companion stars in seven X-ray\nbinaries indicate they are metal-rich (all except GRO J1655-40) and possess\nlarge peculiar abundances of alpha-elements (Abridged)\n","Comment: Book chapter in Handbook of Supernovae, edited by Athem W.

We fill this gap by carrying out a\nlaboratory investigation of the physical properties of CO$_2$ clathrates\nproduced in weak aqueous solutions of MgSO$_4$.

The semantics of\nCoupled (hierarchical) models is then given by translation into Atomic DEVS\nmodels. As this formal \"flattening\" is not efficient, a modular abstract\nsimulator which operates directly on the coupled model is also presented. This\nis the common basis for subsequent efficient implementations. We continue to\nactual applications of DEVS modelling and simulation, as seen in performance\nanalysis for queueing systems. Finally, we present some of the shortcomings in\nthe Classic DEVS formalism, and show solutions to them in the form of variants\nof the original formalism.\n"]}]

To a great extent, our highly-skilled motor responses are a\nresult of a reactive feedback system, originating in the brain-stem and spinal\ncord, combined with a feed-forward anticipatory system, that is adaptively\nfine-tuned by sensory experience and originates in the cerebellum. Based on\nthat interaction we design the counterfactual predictive control (CFPC)\narchitecture, an anticipatory adaptive motor control scheme in which a\nfeed-forward module, based on the cerebellum, steers an error feedback\ncontroller with counterfactual error signals. Those are signals that trigger\nreactions as actual errors would, but that do not code for any current or\nforthcoming errors. In order to determine the optimal learning strategy, we\nderive a novel learning rule for the feed-forward module that involves an\neligibility trace and operates at the synaptic level. In particular, our\neligibility trace provides a mechanism beyond co-incidence detection in that it\nconvolves a history of prior synaptic inputs with error signals. In the context\nof cerebellar physiology, this solution implies that Purkinje cell synapses\nshould generate eligibility traces using a forward model of the system being\ncontrolled.

It can provide a reliable and\ncomputationally lean method for extracting parameters of physical interest\nusing a small fraction of the voluminous interferometric data, which can be\nprohibitingly compute intensive to calibrate and image using conventional\napproaches. We demonstrate this technique by applying it to data from the\nMurchison Widefield Array and assess its reliability.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Solar Physics"]}]

In spite of its significance, a number of aspects of\nSpekkens' model remained incomplete. Formal rules for the update of states\nafter measurement had not been written down, and the theory had only been\nconstructed for prime-dimensional, and infinite dimensional systems. In this\nwork, we remedy this, by deriving measurement update rules, and extending the\nframework to derive models in all dimensions, both prime and non-prime.\nStabilizer quantum mechanics is a sub-theory of quantum mechanics with\nrestricted states, transformations and measurements. First derived for the\npurpose of constructing error correcting codes, it now plays a role in many\nareas of quantum information theory. Previously, it had been shown that\nSpekkens' model was operationally equivalent in the case of infinite and odd\nprime dimensions. Here, exploiting known results on Wigner functions, we extend\nthis to show that Spekkens' model is equivalent to stabilizer quantum mechanics\nin all odd dimensions, prime and non-prime.
