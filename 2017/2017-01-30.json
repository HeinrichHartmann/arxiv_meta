(3) Any linear subdivision of any star-shaped polyhedron\nin $\\mathbb{R}^d$ is simplicially collapsible after d-2 derived subdivisions at\nmost. This presents progress on an old question by Goodrick.\n  Furthermore, we provide the following applications: (4) Any simplicial\ncomplex admits a CAT(0) metric if and only if it admits collapsible\ntriangulations. (5) All contractible manifolds (except for some 4-dimensional\nones) admit collapsible CAT(0) triangulations. This provides a combinatorial\nversion of a classical result of Ancel and Guilbault. (6) There are\nexponentially many geometric triangulations of $S^d$.

Towards this\nend, data centers can employ a rich set of resource management knobs, such as\nworkload shifting and dynamic server provisioning. Nonetheless, these knobs may\nnot be readily available in a cloud data center (CDC) that serves cloud\ntenants/users, because workloads in CDCs are managed by tenants themselves who\nare typically charged based on a usage-based or flat-rate pricing and often\nhave no incentive to cooperate with the CDC operator for demand response and\ncost saving. Towards breaking such \"split incentive\" hurdle, a few recent\nstudies have tried market-based mechanisms, such as dynamic pricing, inside\nCDCs. However, such mechanisms often rely on complex designs that are hard to\nimplement and difficult to cope with by tenants. To address this limitation, we\npropose a novel incentive mechanism that is not dynamic, i.e., it keeps pricing\nfor cloud resources unchanged for a long period.

We aim to explore the MDP under this constraint, assuming that the\nunknown function satisfies regularity conditions expressed via a Gaussian\nprocess prior. We develop a novel algorithm for this task and prove that it is\nable to completely explore the safely reachable part of the MDP without\nviolating the safety constraint. To achieve this, it cautiously explores safe\nstates and actions in order to gain statistical confidence about the safety of\nunvisited state-action pairs from noisy observations collected while navigating\nthe environment. Moreover, the algorithm explicitly considers reachability when\nexploring the MDP, ensuring that it does not get stuck in any state with no\nsafe way out.

One observation frequently made in experiments, is that\ncorrelations can increase systematically with firing rate.

The effect of compressive/tensile strain on the\nchemical activity of the in-plane graphene/silicene heterostructure is examined\nby studying its interaction with the H2O molecule.

While typical erasure codes can provide\na significant storage advantage over replication, they suffer from poor repair\nefficiency. Locally repairable codes (LRCs) tackle this issue by reducing the\nnumber of nodes participating in the repair process (locality), with the cost\nof reduced minimum distance. In this paper, we study the tradeoff between\nlocality and minimum distance of LRCs with local codes that have an arbitrary\ndistance requirement. Unlike existing methods where a common locality\nrequirement is imposed on every node, we allow the locality requirements vary\narbitrarily from node to node.

In addition, the feasible rate\nregion is characterized by a dimension upper bound that does not depend on the\ndistance. In line with the literature, we first derive bounds based on the\nnotion of locality profile, which refers to the symbol localities specified in\na minimum sense. Since the notion of locality profile is less desirable than\nthe locality requirement, which all conventional problem formulations are also\nbased on, we provide locality requirement-based bounds by exhaustively\ncomparing over the relevant locality profiles.

In this paper,\nwe propose a distributed approach that adapts to the size of the network, i.e.,\nthe number of coexisting WBANs, and to the density of sensors forming each\nindividual WBAN in order to minimize the impact of co-channel interference\nthrough dynamic channel hopping based on Latin rectangles. Furthermore, the\nproposed approach opts to reduce the overhead resulting from channel hopping,\nand lowers the transmission delay, and saves the power resource at both sensor-\nand WBAN-levels. Specifically, we propose two schemes for channel allocation\nand medium access scheduling to diminish the probability of inter-WBAN\ninterference. The first scheme, namely, Distributed Interference Avoidance\nusing Latin rectangles (DAIL), assigns channel and time-slot combination that\nreduces the probability of medium access collision. DAIL suits crowded areas,\ne.g., high density of coexisting WBANs, and involves overhead due to frequent\nchannel hopping at the WBAN coordinator and sensors. The second scheme, namely,\nCHIM, takes advantage of the relatively lower density of collocated WBANs to\nsave power by hopping among channels only when interference is detected at the\nlevel of the individual nodes.

As a consequence, the single-particle spectrum of a neutron in\nthe core of a Borromean nucleus is purely continuum, similarly to the spectrum\nof a free neutron, but two valence neutrons are bound up in such a core. Most\nof the usual approaches do not use the true continuum to solve the three-body\nproblem but use a discrete basis, like for example, wave functions in a finite\nbox. In this paper the proper continuum is used to solve the pairing\nHamiltonian in the continuum spectrum of energy by using the single particle\nlevel density devoid of the free gas. It is shown that the density defined in\nthis way modulates the pairing in the continuum.

This more general setting is of\ncentral relevance for statistical applications involving functional time\nseries. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of I(1)\nsolutions to a given autoregressive law of motion generalizing the Johansen\nI(1) condition, and a characterization of such solutions. To accomplish this we\nobtain necessary and sufficient conditions for a pole in the inverse of a\nholomorphic index-zero Fredholm operator pencil to be simple, and a formula for\nits residue. In the case of first order autoregressive dynamics with a unit\nroot our results take a particularly simple form, with the residue associated\nwith the simple pole at one proportional to a Riesz projection.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 4 figures"]}]

The conventional wisdom is that\nthe interaction energy decays exponentially with object separation and the\ndecay length is a decreasing function of ion concentration; the interaction is\nthus negligible in a concentrated electrolyte. Contrary to this conventional\nwisdom, we have shown by surface force measurements that the decay length is an\nincreasing function of ion concentration and Bjerrum length for concentrated\nelectrolytes. In this paper we report surface force measurements to test\ndirectly the scaling of the screening length with Bjerrum length. Furthermore,\nwe identify a relationship between the concentration dependence of this\nscreening length and empirical measurements of activity coefficient and\ndifferential capacitance. The dependence of the screening length on the ion\nconcentration and the Bjerrum length can be explained by a simple scaling\nconjecture based on the physical intuition that solvent molecules, rather than\nions, are charge carriers in a concentrated electrolyte.\n","Comment: Accepted as a conference paper for \"Chemical Physics of Electroactive\n  Materials: Faraday Discussion\" (10-12 April 2017, Cambridge, UK)"]}]
