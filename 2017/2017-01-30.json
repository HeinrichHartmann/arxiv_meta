(2) Any linear\nsubdivision of any polytope is simplicially collapsible after one derived\nsubdivision. This solves up to one derived subdivision a classical question by\nHudson and Lickorish. (3) Any linear subdivision of any star-shaped polyhedron\nin $\\mathbb{R}^d$ is simplicially collapsible after d-2 derived subdivisions at\nmost. This presents progress on an old question by Goodrick.\n  Furthermore, we provide the following applications: (4) Any simplicial\ncomplex admits a CAT(0) metric if and only if it admits collapsible\ntriangulations. (5) All contractible manifolds (except for some 4-dimensional\nones) admit collapsible CAT(0) triangulations. This provides a combinatorial\nversion of a classical result of Ancel and Guilbault. (6) There are\nexponentially many geometric triangulations of $S^d$. This interpolates between\nthe known result that boundaries of simplicial (d+1)-polytopes are\nexponentially many, and the conjecture that d-spheres are more than\nexponentially many.

When the driving\nevolves smoothly in time, the theory can be sharpened by estimating the\nprobability of adiabatic Landau-Zener transitions at many-body level crossings.\nIn all cases, we argue that there is delocalization at sufficiently low\nfrequency.

We aim to explore the MDP under this constraint, assuming that the\nunknown function satisfies regularity conditions expressed via a Gaussian\nprocess prior. We develop a novel algorithm for this task and prove that it is\nable to completely explore the safely reachable part of the MDP without\nviolating the safety constraint. To achieve this, it cautiously explores safe\nstates and actions in order to gain statistical confidence about the safety of\nunvisited state-action pairs from noisy observations collected while navigating\nthe environment. Moreover, the algorithm explicitly considers reachability when\nexploring the MDP, ensuring that it does not get stuck in any state with no\nsafe way out.

One observation frequently made in experiments, is that\ncorrelations can increase systematically with firing rate.

While typical erasure codes can provide\na significant storage advantage over replication, they suffer from poor repair\nefficiency. Locally repairable codes (LRCs) tackle this issue by reducing the\nnumber of nodes participating in the repair process (locality), with the cost\nof reduced minimum distance. In this paper, we study the tradeoff between\nlocality and minimum distance of LRCs with local codes that have an arbitrary\ndistance requirement. Unlike existing methods where a common locality\nrequirement is imposed on every node, we allow the locality requirements vary\narbitrarily from node to node.

In addition, the feasible rate\nregion is characterized by a dimension upper bound that does not depend on the\ndistance. In line with the literature, we first derive bounds based on the\nnotion of locality profile, which refers to the symbol localities specified in\na minimum sense. Since the notion of locality profile is less desirable than\nthe locality requirement, which all conventional problem formulations are also\nbased on, we provide locality requirement-based bounds by exhaustively\ncomparing over the relevant locality profiles.

The interference is most likely to\naffect the communication links and degrade the performance when sensors of\ndifferent WBANs simultaneously transmit using the same channel. In this paper,\nwe propose a distributed approach that adapts to the size of the network, i.e.,\nthe number of coexisting WBANs, and to the density of sensors forming each\nindividual WBAN in order to minimize the impact of co-channel interference\nthrough dynamic channel hopping based on Latin rectangles. Furthermore, the\nproposed approach opts to reduce the overhead resulting from channel hopping,\nand lowers the transmission delay, and saves the power resource at both sensor-\nand WBAN-levels. Specifically, we propose two schemes for channel allocation\nand medium access scheduling to diminish the probability of inter-WBAN\ninterference. The first scheme, namely, Distributed Interference Avoidance\nusing Latin rectangles (DAIL), assigns channel and time-slot combination that\nreduces the probability of medium access collision. DAIL suits crowded areas,\ne.g., high density of coexisting WBANs, and involves overhead due to frequent\nchannel hopping at the WBAN coordinator and sensors. The second scheme, namely,\nCHIM, takes advantage of the relatively lower density of collocated WBANs to\nsave power by hopping among channels only when interference is detected at the\nlevel of the individual nodes.

The offline tier, the Predictive Flow Optimizer (PFO),\ncreates plans for routing traffic using a model of network conditions. The\nonline tier, MONtra, is aware of the precise local network conditions and is\nable to react quickly to problems within the network. Either tier alone is\ninsufficient. The PFO may take too long to react to network changes. MONtra\nonly has local information and cannot optimize non-concave mission utilities.\nHowever, by combining the two systems, MON is robust and achieves near-optimal\nutility under a wide range of network conditions. While best-effort overlay\nnetworks are well studied, our work is the first to design overlays that are\noptimized for mission utility.\n","Comment: IEEE INFOCOM 2017"]}]

As a consequence, the single-particle spectrum of a neutron in\nthe core of a Borromean nucleus is purely continuum, similarly to the spectrum\nof a free neutron, but two valence neutrons are bound up in such a core. Most\nof the usual approaches do not use the true continuum to solve the three-body\nproblem but use a discrete basis, like for example, wave functions in a finite\nbox. In this paper the proper continuum is used to solve the pairing\nHamiltonian in the continuum spectrum of energy by using the single particle\nlevel density devoid of the free gas. It is shown that the density defined in\nthis way modulates the pairing in the continuum. The partial-wave occupation\nprobabilities for the Borromean nuclei $^6$He and $^{11}$Li are calculated as a\nfunction of the pairing strength. While at the threshold strength the\n$(s_{1/2})^2$ and $(p_{3/2})^2$ configurations are equally important in $^6$He,\nthe $(s_{1/2})^2$ configuration is the main one in $^{11}$Li.

The conventional wisdom is that\nthe interaction energy decays exponentially with object separation and the\ndecay length is a decreasing function of ion concentration; the interaction is\nthus negligible in a concentrated electrolyte. Contrary to this conventional\nwisdom, we have shown by surface force measurements that the decay length is an\nincreasing function of ion concentration and Bjerrum length for concentrated\nelectrolytes. In this paper we report surface force measurements to test\ndirectly the scaling of the screening length with Bjerrum length. Furthermore,\nwe identify a relationship between the concentration dependence of this\nscreening length and empirical measurements of activity coefficient and\ndifferential capacitance. The dependence of the screening length on the ion\nconcentration and the Bjerrum length can be explained by a simple scaling\nconjecture based on the physical intuition that solvent molecules, rather than\nions, are charge carriers in a concentrated electrolyte.\n","Comment: Accepted as a conference paper for \"Chemical Physics of Electroactive\n  Materials: Faraday Discussion\" (10-12 April 2017, Cambridge, UK)"]}]
