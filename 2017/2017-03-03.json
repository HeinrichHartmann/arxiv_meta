So far only rough bounds for these parameters have been\nderived for specific problems. This paper sharpens the bounds on these\nstructural parameters for a well-known open problem in the theory of preemptive\nscheduling: Instances consist of in-trees of $n$ unit-execution-time jobs with\nrelease dates, and the objective is to minimize the total completion time on\ntwo processors. This is among the current, tantalizing `threshold' problems of\nscheduling theory: Our literature survey reveals that any significant\ngeneralization leads to an NP-hard problem, but that any significant\nsimplification leads to tractable problem.\n  For the above problem, we show that the number of preemptions necessary for\noptimality need not exceed $2n-1$; that the number must be of order\n$\\Omega(\\log n)$ for some instances; and that the minimum shift need not be\nless than $2^{-2n+1}$. These bounds are obtained by combinatorial analysis of\noptimal schedules rather than by the analysis of polytope corners for\nlinear-program formulations, an approach to be found in earlier papers. The\nbounds immediately follow from a fundamental structural property called\n`normality', by which minimal shifts of a job are exponentially decreasing\nfunctions. In particular, the first interval between a preempted job's start\nand its preemption is a multiple of 1/2, the second such interval is a multiple\nof 1/4, and in general, the $i$-th preemption occurs at a multiple of $2^{-i}$.\nWe expect the new structural properties to play a prominent role in finally\nsettling a vexing, still-open question of complexity.\n"]}]

Cyclic overlays may provide multiple paths, however, the\nsubscription broadcast process generates one content-based routing path per\nsubscription. This poses serious challenges in offering dynamic routing of\nnotifications when congestion is detected because instantaneous updates in\nrouting tables are required to generate alternative routing paths. This paper\nintroduces the first subscription-based publish/subscribe system, OctopiS,\nwhich offers inter-cluster dynamic routing when congestion in the output queues\nis detected. OctopiS is based on a formally defined Structured Cyclic Overlay\nTopology (SCOT). SCOT is divided into homogeneous clusters where each cluster\nhas equal number of brokers and connects to other clusters through multiple\ninter-cluster overlay links. These links are used to provide parallel routing\npaths between publishers and subscribers connected to brokers in different\nclusters. While aiming at deployment at data center networks, OctopiS generates\nsubscription-trees of shortest lengths used by Static Notification Routing\n(SNR) algorithm. Dynamic Notification Routing (DNR) algorithm uses a bit-vector\nmechanism to exploit the structuredness of a clustered SCOT to offer\ninter-cluster dynamic routing without making updates in routing tables and\nminimizing load on overwhelmed brokers and congested links.

The rigid elliptical cylinder case is\nimportant to be considered as a first-order approximation of the behavior of a\nfluid particle suspended in air, because of the significant acoustic impedance\nmismatch at the particle's boundary. Based on the partial-wave series expansion\nmethod in cylindrical coordinates, non-dimensional acoustic radiation force and\ntorque functions are derived and defined in terms of the scattering\ncoefficients of the elliptic cylinder. A coupled system of linear equations is\nobtained after applying the Neumann boundary condition for an immovable surface\nin a non-viscous fluid, and solved numerically by matrix inversion after\nperforming a single numerical integration procedure. Computational results for\nthe non-dimensional force components and torque, showing the transition from\nthe progressive to the (equi-amplitude) standing wave behavior, are performed\nwith particular emphasis on the aspect ratio a/b, where a and b are the\nsemi-axes of the ellipse, the dimensionless size parameter, as well as the\nangle of incidence ranging from end-on to broadside incidence. The results show\nthat the elliptical geometry has a direct influence on the radiation force and\ntorque, so that the standard theory for circular cylinders (at normal\nincidence) leads to significant miscalculations when the cylinder cross-section\nbecomes non-circular. Moreover, the elliptical cylinder experiences, in\naddition to the acoustic radiation force, a radiation torque that vanishes for\nthe circular cylinder case.

The fused lasso estimate is highly nontrivial to compute when\nthe underlying graph is large and has an arbitrary structure. But for a special\ngraph structure, namely, the chain graph, the fused lasso---or simply, 1d fused\nlasso---can be computed in linear time. In this paper, we establish a\nsurprising connection between the total variation of a generic signal defined\nover an arbitrary graph, and the total variation of this signal over a chain\ngraph induced by running depth-first search (DFS) over the nodes of the graph.\nSpecifically, we prove that for any signal, its total variation over the\ninduced chain graph is no more than twice its total variation over the original\ngraph.

Denoting by $m$ and $n$ the number of edges and\nnodes, respectively, of the graph in question, our result implies that for an\nunderlying signal with total variation $t$ over the graph, the fused lasso\nachieves a mean squared error rate of \\smash{$t^{2/3} n^{-2/3}$}.

We show that whiteout is associated with a deterministic optimization\nobjective function in generalized linear models with a closed-form penalty term\nwhich has connections with the bridge, lasso, ridge, and elastic net\npenalization; and it can be also extended to offer regularization similar to\nthe adaptive lasso and group lasso regression.

This has also allowed to study the\nminute photometric variability following the orbital motion in stellar binaries\nand star-planet systems which is the subject of this review. We focus on\nsystems with a main sequence primary and a low-mass secondary, from a small\nstar to a massive planet. The orbital modulations are induced by a combination\nof gravitational and atmospheric processes, including the beaming effect, tidal\nellipsoidal distortion, reflected light, and thermal emission. Therefore, the\nphase curve shape contains information about the companion's mass and\natmospheric characteristics, making phase curves a useful astrophysical tool.\nFor example, phase curves can be used to detect and measure the mass of\nshort-period low-mass companions orbiting hot fast-rotating stars, out of reach\nof other detection methods. Another interesting application of phase curves is\nusing the orbital phase modulations to look for non-transiting systems, which\ncomprise the majority of stellar binary and star-planet systems.

We highlight important\ndifferences between gas-poor and gas-rich hosts, and between orbital evolution\ntaking place at high redshift as opposed to low redshift. Two effects have a\nhuge impact and are rather novel in the context of massive black hole binaries.\nThe first is the increase in characteristic density of galactic nuclei of\nmerger remnants as galaxies are more compact at high redshift due to the way\ndark halo collapse depends on redshift. This leads naturally to hardening\ntimescales due to 3-body encounters that should decrease by two orders of\nmagnitude up to $z=4$. It explains naturally the short binary coalescence\ntimescale, $\\sim 10$ Myr, found in novel cosmological simulations that follow\nbinary evolution from galactic to milliparsec scales. The second one is the\ninhomogeneity of the interstellar medium in massive gas-rich disks at high\nredshift. In the latter star forming clumps 1-2 orders of magnitude more\nmassive than local Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) can scatter massive black\nholes out of the disk plane via gravitational perturbations and direct\nencounters.

The axial and toroidal fluxes of magnetic field\nare conserved in the perfect-conductivity limit, as is the mass per unit axial\nlength. The magnetic field relaxes during a rapid initial stage to a force-free\nstate, and then decays slowly, due to the effect of weak resistivity $\\eta$,\nwhile constrained to remain approximately force-free. Interest centres on\nwhether the relaxed field may attain a Taylor state; but under the assumed\nconditions with axial and toroidal flux conserved inside every cylindrical\nLagrangian surface, this is not possible. The effect of an additional\n$\\alpha$-effect associated with instabilities and turbulence in the plasma is\ntherefore investigated in exploratory manner.

Despite being\ndistributed, Local Voting has a very close performance to a centralized\nalgorithm that is considered to have the optimal performance.\n","Comment: Accepted at 2017 INFOCOM Poster and Demo"]}]

The\ngoal of this paper is to determine new relationships which allow the\ncalculation of any collisional rates of the d-levels of ions by simply\ndetermining the value of n^* and $E_p$ without the need of determining the\ninteraction potentials and treating the dynamics of collisions. The\ndetermination of n^* and E_p is easy and based on atomic data usually available\nonline. Accurate collisional rates allow a reliable diagnostics of solar\nmagnetic fields. In this work we applied our collisional FORTRAN code to a\nlarge number of cases involving complex and simple ions. After that, the\nresults are utilized and injected in a genetic programming code developed with\nC-langugae in order to infer original relationships which will be of great help\nto solar applications. We discussed the accurarcy of our collisional rates in\nthe cases of polarized complex atoms and atoms with hyperfine structure. The\nrelationships are expressed on the tensorial basis and we explain how to\ninclude their contributions in the master equation giving the variation of the\ndensity matrix elements. As a test, we compared the results obtained through\nthe general relationships provided in this work with the results obtained\ndirectly by running our code of collisions. These comparisons show a percentage\nof error of about 10% in the average value.\n","Comment: In press in Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia\n  (PASA) journal, Cambridge Core"]}]

(b) Based on our analysis, we propose a novel\nhierarchical, parallel and multi-scale residual block architecture that yields\nlarge performance improvement over the standard bottleneck block when having\nthe same number of parameters, thus bridging the gap between the original\nnetwork and its binarized counterpart. (c) We also show that the performance\nboost offered by the proposed architecture is not only observed for the case of\nbinary networks but also generalizes for the case of real valued weights and\nactivations. (d) We perform a large number of ablation studies that shed light\non the properties and the performance of the proposed block. (e) We present\nresults for experiments on the most challenging datasets for human pose\nestimation and face alignment, reporting in many cases state-of-the-art\nperformance.

This plugin model allows a target application to disconnect\nfrom the hardware emulator at checkpoint time and then re-connect to a possibly\ndifferent hardware emulator at the time of restart. The DMTCP plugin model is\nimportant in allowing three distinct parties to seamlessly inter-operate. The\nthree parties are: the EDA designer, who is concerned with formal verification\nof a circuit design; the DMTCP developers, who are concerned with providing\ntransparent checkpointing during the circuit emulation; and the hardware\nemulator vendor, who provides a plugin library that responds to checkpoint,\nrestart, and other events.\n  The new plugin model is an example of process-level virtualization:\nvirtualization of external abstractions from within a process. This capability\nis motivated by scenarios for testing circuit models with the help of a\nhardware emulator. The plugin model enables a three-way collaboration: allowing\na circuit designer and emulator vendor to each contribute separate proprietary\nplugins while sharing an open source software framework from the DMTCP\ndevelopers. This provides a more flexible platform, where different fault\ninjection models based on plugins can be designed within the DMTCP\ncheckpointing framework. After initialization, one restarts from a checkpointed\nstate under the control of the desired plugin. This restart saves the time\nspent in simulating the initialization phase, while enabling fault injection\nexactly at the region of interest.
