The galaxy has been imaged in the F435W (B), F555W (V) and F814W (I)\nbroad-band filters, and in the F658N (Halpha) narrow-band filter. Our\nphotometry includes ~300,000 objects in the (B, V) color-magnitude diagram\n(CMD) down to V < 28, and ~400,000 objects in the (V, I) CMD, down to I < 27 .\nA subsample of ~200,000 stars has been photometrized in all the three bands\nsimultaneously. The features observed in the CMDs imply a variety of stellar\nages up to at least 1 Gyr, and possibly as old as a Hubble time. The spatial\nvariation of the CMD morphology and of the red giant branch colors point toward\nthe presence of an age gradient: young and intermediate-age stars tend to be\nconcentrated toward the galactic center, while old stars are present\neverywhere. The spatial variation in the average luminosity of carbon stars\nsuggests that there is not a strong metallicity gradient (< 0.2 dex). Also, we\ndetect an interesting resolved star cluster on the West side of the galaxy,\nsurrounded by a symmetric tidal or spiral feature consisting of young stars.\nThe positions of the stars in NGC 4449 younger than 10 Myr are strongly\ncorrelated with the Halpha emission. We derive the distance of NGC 4449 from\nthe tip of the red giant branch to be D=3.82 \\pm 0.27 Mpc.

Afterwards, we study the\nsubsequent evolution of generating PBHs during the bouncing phase. For the PBH\ngrowth ignoring the Hawking radiation, a relation upon model parameters of the\nbouncing phase $\\Upsilon \\geq c_s^2 \\pi^2 H^2_{-}$ is expected to be satisfied,\nin case that PBHs would grow to infinity before the bouncing point. We also\ncalculate the back-reaction of PBHs in order to theoretically constrain bounce\ncosmologies by considering the effects of both PBH growth and the associated\nHawking radiation. The constraint is in accordance to the relation $\\Upsilon\n\\geq c_s^2 \\pi^2 H^2_{-}$ for the bounce cosmology with a relatively low energy\nscale $H_{-}^2 \\ll 10^9 c_s^5 M_p^2$.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 4 figures, comments are welcome"]}]

To answer this, we need to be able to estimate the H2 mass.\nTraditionally, this is done using CO and a few assumptions but the Herschel\nobservations in the FIR make it possible to estimate the molecular gas mass\nindependently of CO. Previous attempts to derive gas masses from dust emission\nsuffered from biases. Generally, dust surface densities, HI column densities,\nand CO intensities are used to derive a gas-to-dust ratio (GDR) and the local\nCO intensity to H2 column density ratio (XCO), sometimes allowing for an\nadditional CO-dark gas component (Kdark). We tested earlier methods, revealing\ndegeneracies among the parameters, and then used a Bayesian formalism to derive\nthe most likely values for each of the parameters mentioned above as a function\nof position in the nearby low metallicity spiral galaxy M33. The data are from\nthe IRAM 30m CO(2-1) line, high-resolution HI and Herschel dust continuum\nobservations. Solving for GDR, XCO, and Kdark in macro pixels 500 pc in size,\nwe find that (i) allowing for CO-dark gas significantly improves fits; (ii)\nKdark decreases with galactocentric distance; (iii) GDR is slightly higher than\ninitially expected and increases with galactocentric distance; (iv) the total\namount of dark gas closely follows the radially decreasing CO emission, as\nmight be expected if the dark gas is H2 where CO is photodissociated. The total\namount of H2, including dark gas, yields an average XCO of twice the galactic\nvalue of 2e20 cm^-2/(K km/s), 55% of this traced directly through CO. The\nrather constant fraction of dark gas suggests that there is no large population\nof diffuse H2 clouds (unrelated to GMCs) without CO emission.

Edge-on\ngalaxies with boxy bulges tend to lack extended spheroidal halos, while those\nwith large classical bulges exhibit extended round halos, supporting the\nnotions that boxy or barlike bulges originate from disks. Most face-on spiral\ngalaxies present features that appear to be irregular extensions of spiral\narms, although rare cases show smooth boundaries with no sign of star\nformation. Although we serendipitously discovered a dwarf galaxy undergoing\ntidal disruption in the halo of NGC 4449, we found no comparable examples in\nour general survey. A search for similar examples in the Local Volume\nidentified hcc087, a tidally disrupting dwarf galaxy in the Hercules Cluster,\nbut we do not confirm an anomalously large half-light radius reported for the\ndwarf VCC 1661.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 4 figures"]}]

MUSIC is an implicit large eddy simulation code that uses implicit\ntime integration, implemented as a Jacobian-free Newton Krylov method. A\nphysics based preconditioning technique which can be adjusted to target varying\nphysics is used to improve the performance of the solver. The problems used for\nthis benchmark study include the Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstabilities, and the decay of the Taylor-Green vortex.

A series of\nmulti-dimensional tests are performed and analysed. Each of these test cases is\nanalysed with a simple, scalar diagnostic, with the aim of enabling direct code\ncomparisons. As the tests performed do not have analytic solutions we verify\nMUSIC by comparing to established codes including ATHENA and the PENCIL code.\nMUSIC is able to both reproduce behaviour from established and widely-used\ncodes as well as results expected from theoretical predictions.

These methods are cumbersome and lack flexibility. Here we propose a\nconvenient framework for numerically solving the forward problem of\ntime-distance helioseismology in the frequency domain. The fundamental quantity\nto be computed is the cross-covariance of the seismic wavefield.

We illustrate\nthe method by considering the 3D acoustic wave equation in an axisymmetric\nreference solar model, ignoring the effects of gravity on the waves. The\nsymmetry of the background model around the rotation axis implies that the\nGreen's function can be written as a sum of longitudinal Fourier modes, leading\nto a set of independent 2D problems.

Recently Almheiri-Marolf-Polchinski-Sully (AMPS) have\nnoted an apparent paradox in reconciling fundamental properties of quantum\nmechanics with standard beliefs about black holes. One way to resolve the\nparadox is to postulate the existence of a \"firewall\" inside the black hole\nhorizon which prevents objects from falling smoothly toward the singularity. A\nfundamental limitation on the behavior of quantum entanglement known as\n\"monogamy\" plays a key role in the AMPS argument. Our goal is to study and\napply many-body entanglement theory to consider the entanglement among\ndifferent parts of Hawking radiation and black holes. Using the multipartite\nentanglement measure called negativity, we identify an example which could\nchange the AMPS accounting of quantum entanglement and perhaps eliminate the\nneed for a firewall. Specifically, we constructed a toy model for black hole\ndecay which has different entanglement behavior than that assumed by AMPS. We\ndiscuss the additional steps that would be needed to bring lessons from our toy\nmodel to our understanding of realistic black holes.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 2 figures.

The lack of gas and recent star formation in Eri II is surprising given\nits mass and distance from the Milky Way, and may place constraints on models\nof quenching in dwarf galaxies and on the distribution of hot gas in the Milky\nWay halo. Furthermore, the large velocity dispersion of Eri II can be combined\nwith the existence of a central star cluster to constrain MACHO dark matter\nwith mass $\\gtrsim10~\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 10 figures, Accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

The adopted star-formation efficiency of 0.33 in the cluster volume\nresults in a distinct sensitivity to the gas expulsion velocity over a wide\nmass range, while a variation of the star-formation efficiency can make the\ncluster robust to the rapidly decreasing external potential. We confirm that\nprimordial mass segregation leads to a smaller bound fraction, its influence\npossibly decreasing with mass.

Only strong radiation at the early stage of structure formation can\nhalt the cloud collapse, but this is much stronger than observationally allowed\nvalue. We also explored the effect of ionizing radiation on a sample of 68\nhalos by employing an analytical model and found that increase in the mean\ndensity of the gas between the SMS forming cloud and the source galaxy protects\nthe gas cloud from ionizing radiation as they approach each other.

We focus on two issues: i) The role of the\ninternal gauge freedom in consistent formulations of the action principle, and\nii) the role a 3+1 decomposition has in the allowed internal gauge. We clarify\nhow the requirement of well posed variational principles compatible with\ngeneral weakly isolated horizons (WIHs) does lead to a partial gauge fixing in\nthe first order descriptions used previously in the literature. We consider the\nPalatini action together with the Holst extension, with and without boundary\nterms at the horizon. We show that, for the complete configuration space --with\nno gauge fixing--, the Palatini action is differentiable without additional\nsurface terms at the WIH boundary, but the more general Holst action is not. A\nsurface term at the horizon --that renders the action for asymptotically flat\nconfigurations differentiable-- makes the Holst action differentiable, but only\nif one restricts configuration space and partially reduces the internal Lorentz\ngauge. For the second issue, we show that upon performing a 3+1 decomposition\nand imposing the time gauge, there is a further gauge reduction of the\nHamiltonian theory in terms of Ashtekar-Barbero variables to a $U(1)$-gauge\ntheory on the horizon. We show that even when the Holst action is\ndifferentiable without additional surface terms or any gauge fixing for Type I\nspherically symmetric (strongly) isolated horizons --and a preferred\nfoliation--, this result does not go through for more general isolated or\nweakly isolated horizons.

Following the\nobservations of GW150914 and GW151226, the rate and mass of coalescing binary\nblack holes appear to be greater than many previous expectations. As a result,\nthe stochastic background from unresolved compact binary coalescences is\nexpected to be particularly loud. We perform a search for the isotropic\nstochastic gravitational-wave background using data from Advanced LIGO's first\nobserving run. The data display no evidence of a stochastic gravitational-wave\nsignal. We constrain the dimensionless energy density of gravitational waves to\nbe $\\Omega_0<1.7\\times 10^{-7}$ with 95% confidence, assuming a flat energy\ndensity spectrum in the most sensitive part of the LIGO band (20-86 Hz). This\nis a factor of ~33 times more sensitive than previous measurements. We also\nconstrain arbitrary power-law spectra. Finally, we investigate the implications\nof this search for the background of binary black holes using an astrophysical\nmodel for the background.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 6 figures"]}]

During this\nprocess, transverse oscillations of the threads are observed. The cool plasma\nis then observed to descend back to the chromosphere along each loop strand. At\nthe same time, a larger diffuse co-spatial loop observed in the hot wavebands\nof SDO/AIA and Hinode/XRT is formed, exhibiting periodic intensity variations\nalong its length. The formation and evolution of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nwaves depend upon the values of the local plasma parameters (e.g. density,\ntemperature and magnetic field), which can hence be inferred by coronal\nseismology. In this study we aim to assess how the observed MHD modes are\naffected by the variation of density and temperature. We combined analysis of\nEUV/X-ray imaging and spectroscopy using SDO/AIA, Hinode/EIS and XRT.

To keep our model simple, in this work we propose to change the\nstrength of the spin 1/2 components in the $\\Delta$ propagator and use the\n$\\nu_\\mu n\\to\\mu^- n\\pi^+$ data to constraint its value. With this\nmodification, we now find a good reproduction of the $\\nu_\\mu n\\to\\mu^- n\\pi^+$\ncross section without affecting the good results previously obtained for the\nother channels.

In this work, we propose a novel method\nto control and generate SPCs in stanene nanoribbons in the quantum spin Hall\n(QSH) insulator regime by all electrical means without spin-flip mechanism.\nThis is achieved with intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in stanene nanoribbons by\ntuning the relative phase of spin up and down electrons using a gate voltage,\nwhich creates a time delay between them thereby producing alternative SPCs\ndriven by ac voltage. The control and generation of SPCs are demonstrated\nnumerically for ac transport in both transient and ac regime. Our results are\nrobust against edge imperfections and generally valid for other QSH insulators\nsuch as silicene and germanene, etc. These findings establish a novel route for\ngenerating SPCs by purely electrical means and open the door for new\napplications of semiconductor spintronics.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Our main aim is in pointing out the biases in the results due to not\naccounting for some sources of uncertainty. We adopt the SCEPtER pipeline,\nrelying on stellar models computed with two stellar evolutionary codes (FRANEC\nand MESA). We found multiple independent groups of solutions. The best one\nsuggests a system of age 1.10 $\\pm$ 0.07 Gyr (primary star in the central\nhelium burning stage, secondary in the sub-giant branch), with a\nhelium-to-metal enrichment ratio of $\\Delta Y/\\Delta Z = 1$ and core\novershooting parameter $\\beta = 0.15 \\pm 0.01$ (FRANEC) and $f_{\\rm ov}= 0.013\n\\pm 0.001 $ (MESA). The second class of solutions, characterised by a worse\ngoodness-of-fit, still suggest a primary star in the central helium-burning\nstage but a secondary in the overall contraction phase, at the end of the main\nsequence. The FRANEC grid provides an age of $1.16_{-0.02}^{+0.03}$ Gyr and\n$\\beta = 0.25_{-0.01}^{+0.005}$, while the MESA grid gives $1.23 \\pm 0.03$ Gyr\nand $f_{\\rm ov} = 0.025 \\pm 0.003$. We also show that very precise mass\ndeterminations with uncertainty of a few thousandths of solar mass are required\nto obtain reliable determinations of stellar parameters, as mass errors larger\nthan approximately 1% lead to estimates that are not only less precise but also\nbiased. Moreover, we show that a fit obtained with a grid of models computed at\na fixed $\\Delta Y/\\Delta Z$ can provide biased age and overshooting estimates.\nThe possibility of independent overshooting efficiencies for the two stars of\nthe system is also explored.

Oscillatory final states are found for all viscosity\nratios (0.1-10). For uniform viscosity (m=1), the first bifurcation is through\na surface tension-driven global instability. For low viscosity of the outer\nfluid, there is a mode competition between a steady asymmetric Coanda-type\nattachment mode and the surface tension-induced mode. At moderate surface\ntension, the Coanda-type attachment dominates and eventually triggers\ntime-dependent convective bursts. At high surface tension, the surface\ntension-dominated mode dominates.

In addition,\nfor low spectral dimensions, we observe superlocalization resonances and a\nformation of an energy gap around the center of the spectrum.\n","Comment: version accepted for publication in PRB, (7 pages, 8 figures)"]}]

Because these\nerrors are highly correlated on the sky, their influence is expected to be\nespecially important at very large scales. In this work we quantify how the\nuncertainty in the visibility mask of a survey influences the measured power\nspectrum of a sample of tracers of the density field and its covariance matrix.\nWe start from a very large set of 10,000 catalogs of dark matter halos in\nperiodic cosmological boxes, produced with the PINOCCHIO approximate method. To\nmake an analytic approach feasible, we assume luminosity-independent halo bias\nand an idealized geometry for the visibility mask. We find that the power\nspectrum of these biased tracers can be expressed as the sum of a cosmological\nterm, a mask term and a term involving their convolution. The mask and\nconvolution terms scale like $P\\propto l^2\\sigma_A^2$, where $\\sigma_A^2$ is\nthe variance of the uncertainty on the visibility mask. With $l=30-100$ Mpc$/h$\nand $\\sigma_A=5-20$\\%, the mask term can be significant at $k\\sim0.01-0.1\\\nh/$Mpc, and the convolution term can amount to $\\sim 1-10$\\% of the total. For\nthe power spectrum covariance, the coupling of the convolution term with the\nother two gives rise to several mixed terms, that we quantify by difference\nusing the mock catalogs. These are found to be of the same order of the mask\ncovariance, and to introduce non-diagonal terms at large scales. Then, the\npower spectrum covariance matrix cannot be expressed as the sum of a\ncosmological and of a mask term. Our results lie down the theoretical bases to\nquantify the impact that uncertainties in the mask calibration have on the\nderivation of cosmological constraints from large spectroscopic surveys.\n[Abridged]\n","Comment: 23 pages, 6 figures - Minor changes"]}]

Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics\n(SPH) method has been used in many of such simulations. Recently, however, it\nhas been shown that SPH cannot handle contact discontinuities or free surfaces\naccurately. There are several reasons for this problem. The first one is that\nSPH requires that the density is continuous and differentiable. The second one\nis that SPH does not have the consistency, and thus the accuracy is zeroth\norder in space. In addition, we cannot express accurate boundary conditions\nwith SPH. In this paper, we propose a novel, high-order scheme for\nparticle-based hydrodynamics of compress- ible fluid. Our method is based on\nkernel-weighted high-order fitting polynomial for intensive variables. With\nthis approach, we can construct a scheme which solves all of the three prob-\nlems described above. For shock capturing, we use a tensor form of\nvon-Neumann-Richtmyer artificial viscosity. We have applied our method to many\ntest problems and obtained excel- lent result. Our method is not conservative,\nsince particles do not have mass or energy, but only their densities.

It is thus critical to correct\nfor the possible slow drift of the star image from the phase mask center,\ngenerally due to mechanical flexures induced by temperature and/or gravity\nfield variation, or to misalignment between the optics that rotate in pupil\ntracking mode. A control loop based on the QACITS algorithm for the vortex\ncoronagraph has thus been developed and deployed for the Keck/NIRC2 instrument.\nThis algorithm executes the entire observing sequence, including the\ncalibration steps, initial centering of the star on the vortex center and\nstabilisation during the acquisition of science frames. On-sky data show that\nthe QACITS control loop stabilizes the position of the star image down to 2.4\nmas rms at a frequency of about 0.02 Hz.

The Incremental\nQuasi-Newton (IQN) method proposed here belongs to the family of stochastic and\nincremental methods that have a cost per iteration independent of $n$. IQN\niterations are a stochastic version of BFGS iterations that use memory to\nreduce the variance of stochastic approximations. The convergence properties of\nIQN bridge a gap between deterministic and stochastic quasi-Newton methods.\nDeterministic quasi-Newton methods exploit the possibility of approximating the\nNewton step using objective gradient differences. They are appealing because\nthey have a smaller computational cost per iteration relative to Newton's\nmethod and achieve a superlinear convergence rate under customary regularity\nassumptions. Stochastic quasi-Newton methods utilize stochastic gradient\ndifferences in lieu of actual gradient differences. This makes their\ncomputational cost per iteration independent of the number of objective\nfunctions $n$. However, existing stochastic quasi-Newton methods have sublinear\nor linear convergence at best. IQN is the first stochastic quasi-Newton method\nproven to converge superlinearly in a local neighborhood of the optimal\nsolution. IQN differs from state-of-the-art incremental quasi-Newton methods in\nthree aspects: (i) The use of aggregated information of variables, gradients,\nand quasi-Newton Hessian approximation matrices to reduce the noise of gradient\nand Hessian approximations. (ii) The approximation of each individual function\nby its Taylor's expansion in which the linear and quadratic terms are evaluated\nwith respect to the same iterate. (iii) The use of a cyclic scheme to update\nthe functions in lieu of a random selection routine. We use these fundamental\nproperties of IQN to establish its local superlinear convergence rate.\n"]}]

As a\nresult, predicting when, where, and how far diseases will spread requires a\ncomplex systems approach to modeling. Recent studies have demonstrated that\npredicting different components of outbreaks--e.g., the expected number of\ncases, pace and tempo of cases needing treatment, importation probability\netc.--is feasible. Therefore, advancing both the science and practice of\ndisease forecasting now requires testing for the presence of fundamental limits\nto outbreak prediction. To investigate the question of outbreak prediction, we\nstudy the information theoretic limits to forecasting across a broad set of\ninfectious diseases using permutation entropy as a model independent measure of\npredictability. Studying the predictability of a diverse collection of\nhistorical outbreaks--including, gonorrhea, influenza, Zika, measles, polio,\nwhooping cough, and mumps--we identify a fundamental entropy barrier for time\nseries forecasting. However, we find that for most diseases this barrier to\nprediction is often well beyond the time scale of single outbreaks, implying\nprediction is likely to succeed. We also find that the forecast horizon varies\nby disease and demonstrate that both shifting model structures and social\nnetwork heterogeneity are the most likely mechanisms for the observed\ndifferences in predictability across contagions. Our results highlight the\nimportance of moving beyond time series forecasting, by embracing dynamic\nmodeling approaches to prediction and suggest challenges for performing model\nselection across long disease time series.

Owing to their proximity to the massive spirals Milky\nWay (MW) and M31, various environmental processes have been invoked to explain\ntheir origin. In this context, the tidal stirring model postulates that\ninteractions with MW-sized hosts can transform rotationally supported dwarfs,\nresembling present-day dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxies, into systems with the\nkinematic and structural properties of dSphs.

For a given orbit inside the primary galaxy, rotationally supported\ndwarfs with gas fractions akin to those of observed dIrrs (fgas >= 0.5),\ndemonstrate a substantially enhanced likelihood and efficiency of\ntransformation into dSphs relative to their collisionless (fgas = 0)\ncounterparts. We argue that the combination of ram-pressure stripping and SN\nwinds causes the gas-rich dwarfs to respond more impulsively to tides,\naugmenting their transformation. When fgas >= 0.5, disky dwarfs on previously\nunfavorable low-eccentricity or large-pericenter orbits are still able to\ntransform. On the widest orbits, the transformation is incomplete; the dwarfs\nretain significant rotational support, a relatively flat shape, and some gas,\nnaturally resembling transition-type systems.

Broadly speaking, these experiments\nconsist of a simulated, or virtual model coupled directly to a physical\nexperiment. Within the physical experiment, it is typical to find a good deal\nof uncertainty and noise since it is connected to the real world, and thus\nsubjected to random perturbations. In contrast, the virtual part of the coupled\nsystem represents a somewhat idealized version of reality in which noise can be\neliminated entirely, or at least well characertized. Thus, mixed-reality\nsystems have very skewed sources of uncertainty spread through the entire\nsystem. In this paper, we consider a generic model of a mixed-reality system,\nand show how noise in the physical part of the system can influence the virtual\ndynamics through a large fluctuation, even when there is no noise in the\nvirtual components. The virtual large fluctuation happens while the real\ndynamics exhibits only small random oscillations. We quantify the effects of\nuncertainty by showing how characteristic timescales of noise induced switching\nscale as a function of the coupling between the real and virtual parts of the\nexperiment. Our results show that the probability of switching in the virtual\nworld scales inversely as the square of reduced noise intensity amplitude,\nrendering the virtual probability of switching to be an extremely rare event.\nOur results are also confirmed through simulations, which agree quite well with\nanalytic theory.\n","Comment: 13 pages 12 figures"]}]

Methods and results: The SI fluctuations versus time for 34\nhealthy people walking 15 minutes on an instrumented treadmill is studied in\nfour conditions: forward walking (FW) without GVS (FW_{S0}) and with GVS\n(FW_{S+}), and backward walking without GVS (BW_{S0}) and with GVS (BW_{S+}).\nThe time series are then analysed from a spatio-temporal point of view and from\na long-range AC point of view: particular attention is paid to the Hurst\nexponent (\\alpha) and to the Minkowski fractal dimension, interpreted as\nindexes expressing predictability and complexity of the time series\nrespectively. WD has a major impact on the results: walking backward increases\nspatio-temporal variablility and modifies long-range AC. GVS differently\ninfluences FW and BW: It increases the stride width in FW while increasing the\nmean SI duration in BW. The fractal dimension is always decreased when turning\non GVS, but the long-range AC are unchanged. Conclusion: The control condition\nis typical of a chaotic system exhibiting long-range AC, and the trend of\n\\alpha versus stride amplitude is compatible with a peculiar pendular model of\nwalking. GVS reduced complexity or predictability, depending on WD. During FW\nwalking, GVS reduced complexity, leading to fewer walking adaptability. During\nBW walking, GVS reduced predictability, leading to a more random walking. The\npresent study thus opens a way to classify walking according to the complexity\nand predictability of SI time series. Our findings may finally have\napplications in the field of rehabilitation. They suggest that, in FW, GVS is a\nrelevant tool to work on balance, while in BW, GVS may help to improve the\nregularity of steps.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 6 figures"]}]

To ensure the required\nquality-of-service (QoS) with finite transmit power, a proactive packet\ndropping mechanism is introduced. Then, the overall packet loss probability\nincludes transmission error probability, queueing delay violation probability,\nand packet dropping probability. We optimize the packet dropping policy, power\nallocation policy, and bandwidth allocation policy to minimize the transmit\npower under the QoS constraint. The optimal solution is obtained, which depends\non both channel and queue state information.

An\nend-to-end manner, mapping from raw depth maps to action classes, is\nnon-trivial to design due to the fact that: 1) single channel map lacks texture\nthus weakens the discriminative power; 2) relatively small set of depth\ntraining data. To address these challenges, we propose to learn an RNN driven\nby privileged information (PI) in three-steps: An encoder is pre-trained to\nlearn a joint embedding of depth appearance and PI (i.e. skeleton joints). The\nlearned embedding layers are then tuned in the learning step, aiming to\noptimize the network by exploiting PI in a form of multi-task loss. However,\nexploiting PI as a secondary task provides little help to improve the\nperformance of a primary task (i.e. classification) due to the gap between\nthem. Finally, a bridging matrix is defined to connect two tasks by discovering\nlatent PI in the refining step. Our PI-based classification loss maintains a\nconsistency between latent PI and predicted distribution. The latent PI and\nnetwork are iteratively estimated and updated in an expectation-maximization\nprocedure. The proposed learning process provides greater discriminative power\nto model subtle depth difference, while helping avoid overfitting the scarcer\ntraining data.

The formation of microcolonies is a crucial step towards the\nformation of more mature bacterial communities known as biofilms, but also mark\na significant change in bacterial physiology. Within a microcolony, bacteria\nforgo a single cell lifestyle for a communal lifestyle hallmarked by high cell\ndensity and physical interactions between cells potentially leading to\ndifferentiation. It is thus crucial to understand how this transition occurs:\nhow identical single cells assemble in these tight communities and might start\nto behave differently.

Observation of merging\nmicrocolonies and tracking of single cells within microcolonies reveal a\nheterogeneous motility behavior: cells close to the outside of the microcolony\nexhibit a much higher motility compared to cells towards the center. Extensive\nnumerical simulations of a biophysical model for the microcolonies at the\nsingle cell level indicate that mechanical forces exerted by the bacterial\ncells are sufficient to generate the observed heterogeneous motility. Further\ncorroborating this idea, experiment with cells lacking the ability to exert\nforces on their surroundings leads to their segregation on the outside of\nmicrocolonies as predicted by the biophysical model.

We estimate the concentration of light (C) at the galaxy\ncenter and the 180 degree-rotational asymmetry (A), computed at several\nwavelengths, from ultraviolet (UV) to I-band. The variation of the indices of\nconcentration and asymmetry with the wavelength reflects the proportion and the\ndistribution of young and old stellar populations in galaxies. In general C is\nfound to decrease from optical to UV, and A is found to increase from optical\nto UV: the patchy appearance of galaxies in UV with no bulge is often very\ndifferent from their counterpart at optical wavelengths, with prominent bulges\nand more regular disks. The variation of C and A with the wavelength is\nquantified. By this way, we are able to distinguish five types of galaxies that\nwe call spectro-morphological types: compact, ringed, spiral, irregular and\ncentral-starburst galaxies, which can be differentiated by the repartition of\ntheir stellar populations. We discuss in detail the morphology of galaxies of\nthe sample, and describe the morphological characteristics of each\nspectro-morphological type. We apply spectro-morphology to three objects at a\nredshift z=1 in the Hubble Deep Field North, that gives encouraging results for\napplications to large samples of high-redshift galaxies. This method of\nmorphological classification could be used to study the evolution of the\nmorphology with the redshift and is expected to bring observational constraints\non scenarios of galaxy evolution.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics"]}]

Our formulation\ncoincides with Newtonian Lagrangian perturbation theory developed by Buchert\nfor the scale much smaller than the horizon scale, and with the gauge invariant\nlinearized theory in the longitudinal gauge conditions for the linear regime.\nThese are achieved by using the gauge invariant quantities at the initial time\nwhen the linearized theory is valid enough. The post-Newtonian corrections in\nthe solution of the trajectory field of fluid elements are calculated in the\nexplicit forms. Thus our formulation allows us to investigate the evolution of\nthe large-scale fluctuations involving relativistic corrections from the early\nregime such as the decoupling time of matter and radiation until today. As a\nresult, we are able to show that naive Newtonian cosmology to the structure\nformation will be a good approximation even for the perturbations with scales\nnot only inside but also beyond the present horizon scale in the longitudinal\ncoordinates. Although the post-Newtonian corrections are small, it is shown\nthat they have a growing transverse mode which is not present in Newtonian\ntheory as well as in the gauge invariant linearized theory. Such post-Newtonian\norder effects might produce characteristic appearances of the large-scale\nstructure formation, for example, through the observation of anisotropies of\nthe cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). Furthermore since our approach\nhas a straightforward Newtonian limit, it will be also convenient for numerical\nimplementation based on the presently available Newtonian simulation. ......\n","Comment: 26 pages, accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]
