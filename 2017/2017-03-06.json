However, when compared to trajectory planning methods using\ndepth-based SLAM, Monocular SLAM in loop does need additional considerations.\nOne main reason being that for the optimization, in the form of Bundle\nAdjustment (BA), to be robust, the SLAM system needs to scan the area for a\nreasonable duration. Most monocular SLAM systems do not tolerate large camera\nrotations between successive views and tend to breakdown. Other reasons for\nMonocular SLAM failure include ambiguities in decomposition of the Essential\nMatrix, feature-sparse scenes and more layers of non linear optimization apart\nfrom BA. This paper presents a novel formulation based on Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) that generates fail safe trajectories wherein the SLAM generated\noutputs (scene structure and camera motion) do not deviate largely from their\ntrue values. Quintessentially, the RL framework successfully learns the\notherwise complex relation between motor actions and perceptual inputs that\nresult in trajectories that do not cause failure of SLAM, which are almost\nintractable to capture in an obvious mathematical formulation.

With the current work, we provide\nthis general formulation, which comprehensively and parsimoniously expresses\n$\\Phi^{max}$ in the language of probabilistic models. Here, the stochastic\nprocess describing a system under scrutiny corresponds to a first-order\ntime-invariant Markov process, and all necessary mathematical operations for\nthe definition of $\\Phi^{max}$ are fully specified by a system's joint\nprobability distribution over two adjacent points in discrete time.

Furthermore, we suspend the approach of interventional\ncalculus based on system perturbations, which allows us to omit undefined\nconditional distributions and virtualization. We validate our formulation in a\npreviously established discrete example system, in which we furthermore address\nthe previously unexplored theoretical issue of quale underdetermination due to\nnon-uniqueness of maximally irreducible cause-effect repertoires, which in turn\nalso entails the sensitivity of $\\Phi^{max}$ to the shape of the conceptual\nstructure in qualia space.

The\nstudent learns to predict an output chosen by noisy voting among all of the\nteachers, and cannot directly access an individual teacher or the underlying\ndata or parameters.

For fixed individual masses and spin\nmagnitudes, an equal-mass black-hole inspiral is uniquely characterized by the\ntwo parameters $(S,\\xi)$: these two numbers completely determine the entire\nevolution under the effect of radiation reaction. In particular, for equal-mass\nbinaries we find that (i) the black-hole binary spin morphology is constant\nthroughout the inspiral, and that (ii) the precessional motion of the two\nblack-hole spins about the total spin takes place on a longer timescale than\nthe precession of the total spin and the orbital plane about the total angular\nmomentum.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 1 figure, accepted for publication in CQG"]}]

The escaping electromagnetic\npulse is very narrow (a few wavelengths) and so the width of the detected\ntransient is dominated by propagation effects. GHz radio transients are emitted\nfrom i) the dark matter halos of galaxies and ii) the near-horizon regions of\nsupermassive black holes that formed by direct gas collapse and now accrete\nslowly. Brighter and much narrower 0.1-1 THz pulses are predicted at a rate at\nleast comparable to fast radio bursts, experiencing weaker scattering and\nabsorption.

A first step toward addressing this challenge is the growth\nand characterization of technologically relevant, high quantum efficiency\nbialkali photocathodes grown on ultra-thin free-standing graphene substrates.\nPhotocathode growth on free-standing graphene provides the opportunity to\nintegrate these two materials and study their interaction. Specifically,\nspectral response features and photoemission stability of cathodes grown on\ngraphene substrates are compared to those deposited on established substrates.\nIn addition we observed an increase of work function for the graphene\nencapsulated bialkali photocathode surfaces, which is predicted by our\ncalculations. The results provide a unique demonstration of bialkali\nphotocathodes on free-standing substrates, and indicate promise towards our\ngoal of fabricating high-performance graphene encapsulated photocathodes with\nenhanced lifetime for accelerator applications.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 5 figures, accepted to npj 2D Materials and Applications"]}]

This makes it a prime candidate for the\nminimal-span channel, which only captures the near-wall flow by restricting the\nspanwise channel width to be of the order of a few hundred viscous units.\nRecently, Chung et al.

The streamwise domain length of the channel is investigated with\nthe minimum length found to be three times the spanwise width or 1000 viscous\nunits, whichever is longer. A half-height (open) channel with slip wall is\nshown to reproduce the near-wall behaviour seen in a standard channel, but with\nhalf the number of grid points. Next, a forcing model is introduced into the\nouter layer of a half-height channel to reduce the high streamwise velocity.\nFinally, an investigation is conducted to see if varying the roughness Reynolds\nnumber with time is a feasible method for obtaining the full hydraulic\nbehaviour of a rough surface. An empirical costing argument is developed to\ndetermine the cost in terms of CPU hours of minimal-span channel simulations a\npriori. This argument involves counting the number of eddy lifespans in the\nchannel, which is then related to the statistical uncertainty of the streamwise\nvelocity. For a given statistical uncertainty in the roughness function, this\ncan then be used to determine the simulation run time. Following this, a\nfinite-volume code with a body-fitted grid is used to determine the roughness\nfunction for square-based pyramids using the above insights.

Here we review micro-jets of different\norigins, scales and appearances, and propose a unified framework to describe\ntheir dynamics by using an anisotropy parameter $\\zeta$, representing a\ndimensionless measure of the liquid momentum at the collapse point (Kelvin\nimpulse). This parameter is rigorously defined for various jet drivers,\nincluding gravity and nearby boundaries. Combining theoretical considerations\nwith hundreds of high-speed visualisations of bubbles collapsing near a rigid\nsurface, near a free surface or in variable gravity, we classify the jets into\nthree distinct regimes: weak, intermediate and strong. Weak jets\n($\\zeta<10^{-3}$) hardly pierce the bubble, but remain within it throughout the\ncollapse and rebound. Intermediate jets ($10^{-3}<\\zeta<0.1$) pierce the\nopposite bubble wall close to the last collapse phase and clearly emerge during\nthe rebound. Strong jets ($\\zeta>0.1$) pierce the bubble early during the\ncollapse. The dynamics of the jets is analysed through key observables, such as\nthe jet impact time, jet speed, bubble displacement, bubble volume at jet\nimpact and vapour-jet volume. We find that, upon normalising these observables\nto dimensionless jet parameters, they all reduce to straightforward functions\nof $\\zeta$, which we can reproduce numerically using potential flow theory. An\ninteresting consequence of this result is that a measurement of a single\nobservable, such as the bubble displacement, suffices to estimate any other\nparameter, such as the jet speed. Remarkably, the dimensionless parameters of\nintermediate and weak jets only depend on $\\zeta$, not on the jet driver.

The eight stars form two groups\nwith very different oscillation power spectra; the four stars with lowest\nDelta_nu-values display rich sets of mixed l=1 modes, while this is not the\ncase for the four stars with higher Delta_nu. For the four stars with lowest\nDelta_nu, we determine the asymptotic period spacing of the mixed modes,\nDeltaP, which together with the masses we derive for all eight stars suggest\nthat they belong to the so-called secondary clump. Based on the global\noscillation parameters, we present initial theoretical stellar modeling which\nindicate that we can constrain convective-core overshoot on the main sequence\nand in the helium-burning phase for these ~2M_sun stars. Finally, our results\nindicate less mode suppression than predicted by recent theories for magnetic\nsuppression of certain oscillation modes in red giants.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 12 figures.

Upon\ninclusion of Ho2O3, due to the strong spin orbit coupling of the rare earth\nHo3+ ion, we do see 13 percent enhancement in the efficiency. We attribute such\nan enhancement in power conversion efficiency to the increased lifetime of the\nphoto-excited excitons. Essentially, a Ho3+ ion accelerates the phenomenon of\nthe spin rephasing or the intersystem crossing of the excitons in a\nphotosensitizer. Increase in the absorbance and decrease in the\nphotoluminescence intensity suggests a decrease in the recombination rate,\nhinting an enhanced charge transport and is in accordance with our\nelectrochemical impedance spectra and the J V characteristics. From the above\nwe strongly believe that enhanced efficiency of the device is due to increased\nintersystem crossing which would accelerate the exciton dissociation. On top of\nspin orbit interaction, a configuration where the electric and magnetic fields\nare perpendicular to each other helped in enhancing the efficiency by 16\npercent, suggesting that the Lorentz force also plays a dominant role in\ncontrolling the charge transport of the photo-generated charge carriers.

However, the computational costs are usually expensive. This paper\naims to propose a computationally fast and accurate deep learning algorithm for\nthe reconstruction of MR images from highly down-sampled k-space data.\n  Theory: Based on the topological analysis, we show that the data manifold of\nthe aliasing artifact is easier to learn from a uniform subsampling pattern\nwith additional low-frequency k-space data. Thus, we develop deep aliasing\nartifact learning networks for the magnitude and phase images to estimate and\nremove the aliasing artifacts from highly accelerated MR acquisition.\n  Methods: The aliasing artifacts are directly estimated from the distorted\nmagnitude and phase images reconstructed from subsampled k-space data so that\nwe can get an aliasing-free images by subtracting the estimated aliasing\nartifact from corrupted inputs. Moreover, to deal with the globally distributed\naliasing artifact, we develop a multi-scale deep neural network with a large\nreceptive field.\n  Results: The experimental results confirm that the proposed deep artifact\nlearning network effectively estimates and removes the aliasing artifacts.\nCompared to existing CS methods from single and multi-coli data, the proposed\nnetwork shows minimal errors by removing the coherent aliasing artifacts.\nFurthermore, the computational time is by order of magnitude faster.\n  Conclusion: As the proposed deep artifact learning network immediately\ngenerates accurate reconstruction, it has great potential for clinical\napplications.\n"]}]

For\nthis parameter, we propose an FPT algorithm for Nash stability for the case\nwhere the social network is acyclic and obtain a W[1]-hardness result for\ncliques (i.e., for classic GASP); similar results hold for individual\nstability. In contrast, finding a core stable outcome is hard even if the\nnumber of activities is bounded by a small constant, both for classic GASP and\nwhen the social network is a star.

The first Gaia Data Release contains the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric\nSolution (TGAS). This is a subset of about 2 million stars for which, besides\nthe position and photometry, the proper motion and parallax are calculated\nusing Hipparcos and Tycho-2 positions in 1991.25 as prior information. Aims. We\ninvestigate the scientific potential and limitations of the TGAS component by\nmeans of the astrometric data for open clusters. Methods. Mean cluster parallax\nand proper motion values are derived taking into account the error correlations\nwithin the astrometric solutions for individual stars, an estimate of the\ninternal velocity dispersion in the cluster, and, where relevant, the effects\nof the depth of the cluster along the line of sight. Internal consistency of\nthe TGAS data is assessed. Results. Values given for standard uncertainties are\nstill inaccurate and may lead to unrealistic unit-weight standard deviations of\nleast squares solutions for cluster parameters. Reconstructed mean cluster\nparallax and proper motion values are generally in very good agreement with\nearlier Hipparcos-based determination, although the Gaia mean parallax for the\nPleiades is a significant exception. We have no current explanation for that\ndiscrepancy. Most clusters are observed to extend to nearly 15 pc from the\ncluster centre, and it will be up to future Gaia releases to establish whether\nthose potential cluster-member stars are still dynamically bound to the\nclusters. Conclusions. The Gaia DR1 provides the means to examine open clusters\nfar beyond their more easily visible cores, and can provide membership\nassessments based on proper motions and parallaxes. A combined HR diagram shows\nthe same features as observed before using the Hipparcos data, with clearly\nincreased luminosities for older A and F dwarfs.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication by A&A. 21 pages main text plus 46 pages\n  appendices. 34 figures main text, 38 figures appendices. 8 table in main\n  text, 19 tables in appendices"]}]

If we reduce the radial\nlines to reduce the sampling time, streaking artifact patterns are unavoidable.\nTo solve this problem, we propose a novel deep learning approach to reconstruct\nhigh-resolution MR images from the under-sampled k-space data.\n  Methods: The proposed deep network estimates the streaking artifacts.

Moreover, some specific entanglement\nwitnesses can be viewed as a special case of an asymmetry witness---which\nindicates a potential connection between asymmetry and entanglement. We also\nprovide an operationally meaningful coherence measure, which we call\n\\emph{coherence weight}, and investigate its relationship to other coherence\nmeasures like the robustness of coherence and the $l_1$ norm of coherence. In\nparticular, we show that for Werner states in any dimension $d$, all three\ncoherence quantifiers, namely the coherence weight, the robustness of\ncoherence, and the $l_1$ norm of coherence are equal and are given by a single\nletter formula.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 4 figures, RevTeX 4-1"]}]

These can\nbe thought of as intensional vs. extensional data: data in the first region,\nthe modal one, are available as code, and their description can be examined,\nwhereas data in the second region are only available as values up to ordinary\nequality. This allows us to add seemingly non-functional operations at modal\ntypes, whilst maintaining consistency. In this setting the G\\\"odel-L\\\"ob axiom\nacquires a novel constructive reading: it affords the programmer the\npossibility of a very strong kind of recursion, by enabling him to write\nprograms that have access to their own code. This is a type of computational\nreflection that is strongly reminiscent of Kleene's Second Recursion Theorem.\nWe prove that it is consistent with the rest of the system.\n"]}]

The key problem is to simultaneously infer the exact object\nlocations in the training images and train the object detectors, given only the\ntraining images with weak image-level labels. Intuitively, by simulating the\nselective attention mechanism of human visual system, saliency detection\ntechnique can select attractive objects in scenes and thus is a potential way\nto provide useful priors for WOD. However, the way to adopt saliency detection\nin WOD is not trivial since the detected saliency region might be possibly\nhighly ambiguous in complex cases. To this end, this paper first\ncomprehensively analyzes the challenges in applying saliency detection to WOD.\nThen, we make one of the earliest efforts to bridge saliency detection to WOD\nvia the self-paced curriculum learning, which can guide the learning procedure\nto gradually achieve faithful knowledge of multi-class objects from easy to\nhard. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can\nsuccessfully bridge saliency detection and WOD tasks and achieve the\nstate-of-the-art object detection results under the weak supervision.\n","Comment: Has published in IJCAI 16"]}]
