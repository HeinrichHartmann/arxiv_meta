To this date, no such systems were\nfound, and moreover, it became evident that even embedding local Hamiltonians\non robust, albeit \"non-physical\" topologies, namely expanders, does not\nguarantee entanglement robustness. In this study, we indicate that such\nrobustness may be possible after all: We construct an infinite family of\nO(1)-local Hamiltonians, corresponding to check terms of a quantum\nerror-correcting code with the following property of inapproximability: any\nquantum state with energy at most 0.05 w.r.t. the total available energy cannot\nbe even approximately simulated by classical circuits of bounded\n(sub-logarithmic) depth.

It is the first time we are aware of that the\npresented approach has been applied to the nonlinear voter dynamics with noise.\nUp till now, the analytical results have been obtained only for a complete\ngraph. We show that in the limiting case the prediction of pair approximation\ncoincides with the known solution on a fully connected network.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 9 figures, corrected typos, extended section VI"]}]

We\nthen translate Eq(DB) into another, but purely linear matrix equations\ntilde_Eq(DB). It is proved that the least solution of tilde_Eq(DB) in the sense\nof matrix ordering is converted to the least solution of Eq(DB) and the latter\ngives M_DB as a set of adjacency matrices. Hence computing the least solution\nof tilde_Eq(DB) is equivalent to computing M_DB specified by DB. For a class of\ntail recursive programs and for some other types of programs, our approach\nachieves O(N^3) time complexity irrespective of the number of variables in a\nclause since only matrix operations costing O(N^3) or less are used.\n  We conducted two experiments that compute the least Herbrand models of linear\nDatalog programs.

We call\ncollectively the problems formulated under this framework Wasserstein loss\nminimization (WLM). One important appeal of WLM is the innate capability to\naccount for the similarity between atoms or features, while the usual\ndecomposable losses treat the features as separate dimensions. Despite being\nconceptually simple, WLM problems are computationally challenging because they\ninvolve minimizing over functions of quantities (i.e., Wasserstein distances)\nthat themselves require numerical algorithms to compute. Most recent approaches\nuse an entropy-type barrier function on the primal domain, resulting in fast\noptimization with a smoothed Wasserstein loss. In this paper, we introduce a\nnew technique based on simulated annealing, a stochastic approach that\nimplicitly uses a distance-matrix-dependent barrier on the dual domain. With\nthis approach, we can draw on a rich body of work on Markov chain Monte Carlo.\nWe have developed a Gibbs sampler to approximate effectively and efficiently\nthe partial gradients of a sequence of Wasserstein losses. Our new approach has\nthe advantages of numerical stability and readiness for warm starts. These\ncharacteristics are valuable for WLM problems that often require multiple\nlevels of iterations in which the oracle for computing the value and gradient\nof a loss function is embedded.

A better understanding of this\nprocess requires detailed observations of galactic dust polarization on scales\nof 0.01 to 0.1 pc. Such high-resolution polarization observations can be\ncarried out at the IRAM 30 m telescope using the recently installed NIKA2\ncamera, which features two frequency bands at 260 and 150 GHz (respectively\n1.15 and 2.05 mm), the 260 GHz band being polarization sensitive.

The fast and continuous rotation of\nthe HWP permits the quasi simultaneous reconstruction of the three Stokes\nparameters, I, Q and U at 150 and 260 GHz.

The Prandtl number, $Pr$,\ncharacterizing compositional convection is significantly larger than unity,\nsuggesting that the inertial force may not be important on the small scales of\nconvection as long as the buoyancy force is not too strong. We develop\nasymptotic dynamo models for the case of small Rossby number and large Prandtl\nnumber in which inertia is absent on the convective scale. The relevant\ndiffusivity parameter for this limit is the compositional Roberts number, $q =\nD/\\eta$, which is the ratio of compositional and magnetic diffusivities. Dynamo\nmodels are developed for both order one $q$ and the more geophysically relevant\nlow $q$ limit. For both cases the ratio of magnetic to kinetic energy\ndensities, $M$, is asymptotically large and reflects the fact that Alfv\\'en\nwaves have been filtered from the dynamics. Along with previous investigations\nof asymptotic dynamo models for $Pr=O(1)$, our results show that the ratio $M$\nis not a useful indicator of dominant force balances in the momentum equation\nsince many different asymptotic limits of $M$ can be obtained without changing\nthe leading order geostrophic balance.

This implies that major mergers are more common at high\nredshift than implied by the simplest arguments assuming a constant\nobservability time. Several effects contribute to this trend: (1) The fraction\nof massive, major (4:1) pairs which merge by today increases weakly from ~0.5\nat z=1 to ~0.8 at z=3. (2) The median time elapsed between an observed pair and\nfinal remnant decreases by a factor of two from z~1 to z~3.

Accurate separation of the Galactic foregrounds\ntherefore binds this quest to our understanding of the magnetized interstellar\nmedium (ISM). The two most relevant empirical results from analysis of Planck\ndata are line of sight depolarization arising from fluctuations of the Galactic\nmagnetic field orientation and alignment of filamentary dust structures with\nthe magnetic field at high Galactic latitude. Furthermore, Planck and HI\nemission data in combination indicate that most of the filamentary dust\nstructures are in the cold neutral medium. The goal of this paper is to test\nwhether these salient observational results, taken together, can account fully\nfor the statistical properties of the dust polarization over a selected low\ncolumn density region comprising 34 % of the southern Galactic cap ($b \\le\n-30\\deg$). To do this, we construct a dust model that incorporates HI column\ndensity maps as tracers of the dust intensity structures and a phenomenological\ndescription of the Galactic magnetic field. By adjusting the parameters of the\ndust model, we were able to reproduce the Planck dust observations at 353 GHz\nin the selected region.

In this work, we present\na gauged U(1)$_{L_{\\mu}-L_{\\tau}}$ extension of the Standard Model (SM) which\nhas a scalar FIMP DM candidate and can consistently explain the DM relic\ndensity bound. In addition, the spontaneous breaking of the\nU(1)$_{L_{\\mu}-L_{\\tau}}$ gauge symmetry gives an extra massive neutral gauge\nboson $Z_{\\mu\\tau}$ which can explain the muon ($g-2$) data through its\nadditional one-loop contribution to the process.

Integrated-light spectra were obtained by scanning the\nslit of the UVES spectrograph on the ESO Very Large Telescope across the\nhalf-light diameters of the clusters. We modelled the spectra using resolved\nHST colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), as well as theoretical isochrones, in\ncombination with standard stellar atmosphere and spectral synthesis codes. The\nabundances of Fe, Na, Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Ba were compared with literature data\nfor individual stars in the clusters. The typical differences between iron\nabundances derived from our integrated-light spectra and those compiled from\nthe literature are less than 0.1 dex. A larger difference is found for one\ncluster (NGC 6752), and is most likely caused primarily by stochastic\nfluctuations in the numbers of bright red giants within the scanned area. As\nexpected, the alpha-elements (Ca, Ti) are enhanced by about 0.3 dex compared to\nthe Solar-scaled composition, while the [Cr/Fe] ratios are close to Solar. When\nusing up-to-date line lists, our [Mg/Fe] ratios also agree well with literature\ndata. Our [Na/Fe] ratios are, on average, 0.08-0.14 dex lower than average\nvalues quoted in the literature, and our [Ba/Fe] ratios may be overestimated by\n0.20-0.35 dex at the lowest metallicities. We find that analyses based on\ntheoretical isochrones give very similar results to those based on resolved\nCMDs. Overall, the agreement between our integrated-light abundance\nmeasurements and the literature data is satisfactory. Refinements of the\nmodelling procedure, such as corrections for stellar evolutionary and non-LTE\neffects, might further reduce some of the remaining offsets.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 16 figures, accepted for A&A"]}]

Researchers\nhave demonstrated that secret-dependent information can be extracted from\nenclave execution through page-fault access patterns. Consequently, various\nrecent research efforts are actively seeking countermeasures to SGX\nside-channel attacks. It is widely assumed that SGX may be vulnerable to other\nside channels, such as cache access pattern monitoring, as well. However, prior\nto our work, the practicality and the extent of such information leakage was\nnot studied.\n  In this paper we demonstrate that cache-based attacks are indeed a serious\nthreat to the confidentiality of SGX-protected programs. Our goal was to design\nan attack that is hard to mitigate using known defenses, and therefore we mount\nour attack without interrupting enclave execution. This approach has major\ntechnical challenges, since the existing cache monitoring techniques experience\nsignificant noise if the victim process is not interrupted. We designed and\nimplemented novel attack techniques to reduce this noise by leveraging the\ncapabilities of the privileged adversary. Our attacks are able to recover\nconfidential information from SGX enclaves, which we illustrate in two example\ncases: extraction of an entire RSA-2048 key during RSA decryption, and\ndetection of specific human genome sequences during genomic indexing.

While operating at room temperature, and gas pressures of a\nfew millibar, our system exhibits an effective $Q_{\\rm m}$ of $10^{11}$, and a\n$Q_{\\rm m}$-frequency product of $10^{17}$Hz, three orders of magnitude greater\nthan measured in any other experiment. This frequency stability yields an\nunprecedentedly high room temperature torque sensitivity of $0.24$zNm and a\nrelative pressure sensitivity of $0.3$%. In addition, the external drive allows\nus to tune the rotational frequency by almost $10^{12}$ linewidths, and the\nability to make local phase sensitive measurements allows real-time readout,\noffering a new paradigm of flexibility in sensing applications.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures"]}]

The method of\nnormal modes is not applicable due to the time dependence of the nonlinear base\nprofile. Therefore, the instability is quantified either in terms of critical\ntimes at which the boundary layer instability sets in or in terms of long time\nevolution of initial disturbances. This paper adopts an unstably stratified\nbasic profile having a step function density with top heavy carbon saturated\nlayer (boundary layer) overlying a lighter carbon free layer (ambient brine).\nThe resulting configuration resembles that of the Rayleigh-Taylor problem with\nbuoyancy diffusion at the interface separating the two layers.

The resulting stratification remains stable\nuntil the thickness of the carbon saturated layer is sufficient to induce the\nfluid to overturn. With this formulation for the reference state, the stability\ncalculations will be in terms of critical boundary layer thickness instead of\ncritical times, although the two formulations are homologous.

Using the model, the equilibrium constants and rate\nconstants for the reactions were obtained. For one initial concentration of\nF$^-$, a reasonable fit was obtained to the batch adsorption data, except at\nshort times. Because of an uncertainty in the amount of impurity present in the\ncommercial adsorbent used, there was a significant discrepancy between\npredictions and data at higher initial concentrations of F$^-$. The present\nmodel can be applied to any charged adsorbent.\n"]}]

However, genomic-scale networks are high-dimensional\nmodels and are usually estimated from a relatively small number of samples.\nTherefore, their usefulness is hampered by estimation instability. In addition,\nthe complexity of the models is controlled by one or more penalization (tuning)\nparameters where small changes to these can lead to vastly different networks,\nthus making interpretation of models difficult. This necessitates the\ndevelopment of techniques to produce robust network models accompanied by\nestimation quality assessments.\n  We introduce Resampling of Penalized Estimates (ROPE): a novel statistical\nmethod for robust network modeling. The method utilizes resampling-based\nnetwork estimation and integrates results from several levels of penalization\nthrough a constrained, over-dispersed beta-binomial mixture model. ROPE\nprovides robust False Discovery Rate (FDR) control of network estimates and\neach edge is assigned a measure of validity, the q-value, corresponding to the\nFDR-level for which the edge would be included in the network model.

This is the first\nobservation of the $\\omega$ in ultra-peripheral collisions, and the first\nmeasurement of $\\rho-\\omega$ interference at energies where photoproduction is\ndominated by Pomeron exchange. The $\\omega$ amplitude is consistent with the\nmeasured $\\gamma p\\rightarrow \\omega p$ cross section, a classical Glauber\ncalculation and the $\\omega\\rightarrow\\pi^+\\pi^-$ branching ratio. The $\\omega$\nphase angle is similar to that observed at much lower energies, showing that\nthe $\\rho-\\omega$ phase difference does not depend significantly on photon\nenergy.\n  The $\\rho^0$ differential cross section $d\\sigma/dt$ exhibits a clear\ndiffraction pattern, compatible with scattering from a gold nucleus, with 2\nminima visible.

They employ Machine Learning (ML) to allow a local passive adversary\nto uncover the Web browsing behavior of a user, even if she browses through an\nencrypted tunnel (e.g. Tor, VPN). Numerous defenses have been proposed in the\npast; however, it is typically difficult to have formal guarantees on their\nsecurity, which is most often evaluated empirically against state-of-the-art\nattacks. In this paper, we present a practical method to derive security bounds\nfor any WF defense, which depend on a chosen feature set. This result derives\nfrom reducing WF attacks to an ML classification task, where we can determine\nthe smallest achievable error (the Bayes error); such error can be estimated in\npractice, and is a lower bound for a WF adversary, for any classification\nalgorithm he may use. Our work has two main consequences: i) it allows\ndetermining the security of WF defenses, in a black-box manner, with respect to\nthe state-of-the-art feature set and ii) it favors shifting the focus of future\nWF research to the identification of optimal feature sets. The generality of\nthe approach further suggests that the method could be used to define security\nbounds for other ML-based attacks.\n"]}]
