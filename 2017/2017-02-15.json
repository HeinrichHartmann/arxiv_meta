The luminosity functions are reasonably fit\nby half-Gaussian functions. The peak magnitudes shift as a function of redshift\nfrom $M\\sim-23.5$ at $z\\sim0.8$ to $M\\sim-20.3$ at $z\\sim0.1$. This is\nconsistent with the downsizing trend, whereby more massive galaxies form\nearlier than low-mass galaxies. We compared the mass of the post-starburst\nstellar population found in our sample to the decline of the global\nstar-formation rate and found that only a small amount ($\\sim1\\%$) of all\nstar-formation quenching in the redshift range $z=0.2-0.7$ results in\npost-starburst galaxies in the luminosity range our sample is sensitive to.\nTherefore, luminous post-starburst galaxies are not the place where most of the\ndecline in star-formation rate of the universe is happening.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 24 figures, 8 tables.

This is the third discovery of extended UV emission\nfrom a carbon AGB star and the first from an AGB star with a detached shell.\nFrom imaging and photometric analysis of the FUV and NUV images, we determined\nthat the ultraviolet ring has a radius of $\\sim 110^{\\prime\\prime}$, thus\nindicating that the emitting material is likely associated with the detached\nshell seen in the infrared.

At the time of assigning resources, each\nagent privately holds information about her distribution on future values for\ndifferent assignments. Subsequently, we allow for payments to be contingent on\nex post utilization decisions. The objective is to maximize expected\nutilization, while insisting on dominant-strategy equilibria, individual\nrationality, and no-deficit. We also consider two additional, natural\nproperties: an agent should not pay if she utilizes a resource, and resources\nshould always be assigned if possible. We show that the natural, contingent\nsecond-price (CSP) mechanism, is unique under these criteria and optimal for a\nlarger class of mechanisms for assigning a single resource. We extend the CSP\nmechanism to assign multiple, heterogeneous resources (making a technical\nconnection with assignment problems under non quasi-linear utility functions),\nshowing that this generalized mechanism outperforms other methods such as\nfirst-come-first-serve and the VCG mechanism.\n"]}]

The existence of these two different forms of correlation in quantum\nmany-body systems suggests the possibility of formulating an approximation\nwhich affects quantum correlations only, without preventing the correct\ndescription of classical fluctuations at all length scales. Focusing on lattice\nboson and quantum Ising models, we make use of the path-integral formulation of\nquantum statistical mechanics to introduce such an approximation -- that we dub\n\\emph{quantum mean-field} (QMF) approach, and which can be readily generalized\nto a cluster form (cluster QMF or cQMF). The cQMF approximation reduces to\ncluster mean-field theory at $T=0$, while at any finite temperature it produces\na family of systematically improved, semi-classical approximations to the\nquantum statistical mechanics of the lattice theory at hand. Contrary to\nstandard MF approximations, the correct nature of thermal critical phenomena is\ncaptured by any cluster size. In the two exemplary cases of the two-dimensional\nquantum Ising model and of two-dimensional quantum rotors, we study\nsystematically the convergence of the cQMF approximation towards the exact\nresult, and show that the convergence is typically linear or sub-linear in the\n{ boundary-to-bulk ratio} of the clusters as $T\\to 0$, while it becomes faster\nthan linear as $T$ grows.

The\nCZT Imager of AstroSat on its very first day of operation detected a long\nduration gamma-ray burst (GRB) namely GRB 151006A. Using the off-axis imaging\nand spectral response of the instrument, we demonstrate that CZT Imager can\nlocalise this GRB correct to about a few degrees and it can provide, in\nconjunction with Swift, spectral parameters similar to that obtained from\nFermi/GBM. Hence CZT Imager would be a useful addition to the currently\noperating GRB instruments (Swift and Fermi). Specifically, we argue that the\nCZT Imager will be most useful for the short hard GRBs by providing\nlocalisation for those detected by Fermi and spectral information for those\ndetected only by Swift. We also provide preliminary results on a new exciting\ncapability of this instrument: CZT Imager is able to identify Compton scattered\nevents thereby providing polarisation information for bright GRBs. GRB 151006A,\nin spite of being relatively faint, shows hints of a polarisation signal at\n100-300 keV (though at a low significance level). We point out that CZT Imager\nshould provide significant time resolved polarisation measurements for GRBs\nthat have fluence 3 times higher than that of GRB 151006A. We estimate that the\nnumber of such bright GRBs detectable by CZT Imager is 5 - 6 per year. CZT\nImager can also act as a good hard X-ray monitoring device for possible\nelectromagnetic counterparts of Gravitational Wave events.\n","Comment: Submitted to ApJ"]}]

Aims: We seek to constrain the surface\ndensity of warm gas in the disk of HD 139614, a Herbig Ae star with a\ntransition disk exhibiting a dust gap from 2.3 to 6 AU. Methods: We have\nobtained ESO/VLT CRIRES high-resolution spectra of CO ro-vibrational emission.\nWe derived constraints on the disk's structure by modeling the line-profiles,\nthe spectroastrometric signal, and the rotational diagrams using flat Keplerian\ndisk models. Results: We detected v=1-0 12CO, 2-1 12CO, 1-0 13CO, 1-0 C18O, and\n1-0 C17O ro-vibrational lines. 12CO v=1-0 lines have an average width of 14\nkm/s, Tgas of 450 K and an emitting region from 1 to 15 AU. 13CO and C18O lines\nare on average 70 and 100 K colder, 1 and 4 km/s narrower, and are dominated by\nemission at R>6 AU.

Adaptive filtration reduces\ndetector dynamic range and improves image quality. The adaptive filter with\npredetermined shape is placed at the x-ray beam such that the x-ray intensity\nat the detector surface is flat. However, adaptive filter alters the mean dose\nto the breast, as well as volume distribution of the dose. Methods: The dose\nwas measured using a 14 cm diameter cylindrical acrylic breast phantom. An\nacrylic adaptive filter was fabricated to match the 14 cm diameter of the\nphantom. The dose was measured using ion chamber inserted into holes\ndistributed along the radius of the phantom from the center to the edge. The\nradial distribution of dose was measured and fitted by an analytical function\nand the volume distribution and mean value of dose was calculated. The\nmeasurements were performed at 40, 60, 90, and 120 kVp tube voltages and 6.6\nmGy air kerma. Results: The adaptive filter decreased mean breast dose by a\nfactor of 1.6-2.2 depending on the tube voltage. To maintain image quality, the\ntube output was increased by these factors when adaptive filter was used. The\nadaptive filter provided uniform volume distribution of dose at 40 kVp and 60\nkVp tube voltages, but the distribution was non-uniform at 90 kVp and 120 kVp\ntube voltages. Conclusion: While adaptive filtration helps with detector\ndynamic range, CT number uniformity, and CT noise uniformity, the volume\nnon-uniformity of the dose with adaptive filter depends on tube voltage. On the\nother hand, at the same average breast dose, volume non-uniformity of the dose\nwith adaptive filter was not higher that that without adaptive filter. The\nresults allowed also to determine necessary dose increase factor to compensate\nfor x-ray absorption in the adaptive filter.\n","Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author for further evaluation"]}]

Significant UV flux variability on short time-scales\ndetected at the time of the re-brightening disfavors the shock interaction\nscenario as the source of energy powering the long-lived UV emission, while\ndeep radio limits exclude the presence of relativistic jets propagating into a\nlow-density environment. We propose a model where the extreme luminosity and\ndouble-peaked temporal structure of ASASSN-15lh is powered by a central source\nof ionizing radiation that produces a sudden change of the ejecta opacity at\nlater times. As a result, UV radiation can more easily escape, producing the\nsecond bump in the light-curve. We discuss different interpretations for the\nintrinsic nature of the ionizing source.

In contrast to all the previous cases in quantum or\ntopological transitions, although the leading terms are non-universal and\ncutoff dependent, the sub-leading terms satisfy universal scaling relations.\nThe sub-leading scaling leads to the topological depletions (TD) which show\nnon-analytic and non-Fermi liquid corrections in the quantum critical regime,\ncan be easily distinguished from the analytic leading terms and detected\nexperimentally. One can also form a topological Wilson ratio from the TD of two\nconserved quantities such as the specific heat and the compressibility. As a\nbyproduct, we also find Type II Weyl fermions appearing as the TPT due to the\ncollision of the extended particle-hole WFS.

Our results\ndemonstrate that including a self-consistent treatment of radiative energy\nlosses is necessary to perform accurate MHD simulations of powerful jets and\nthat jet spectra calculated via post-processing are liable to vastly\noverestimate the amount of non-thermal emission. If no more than 95% of the\ninitial total jet power is radiated away by the plasma travels as it travels\nalong the length of the jet, we can place a lower bound on the magnetisation of\nthe jet plasma at the base of the jet. For typical powerful jets, we find that\nthe plasma at the jet base is required to be highly magnetised, with at least\n10,000 times more energy contained in magnetic fields than in non-thermal\nleptons. Using a simple power-law model of magnetic reconnection, motivated by\nsimulations of collisionless reconnection, we determine the allowed range of\nthe large-scale average reconnection rate along the jet, by restricting the\ntotal radiative energy losses incurred and the distance at which the jet first\ncomes into equipartition.

We re-assess the potential of asteroseismology for probing the chemical\nstratification in white dwarf cores, in light of new highly efficient tools\nrecently developed for that purpose.\n  Methods. Using the forward modeling approach and a new parameterization for\nthe core chemical stratification in ZZ Ceti stars, we test several situations\ntypical of the usually limited constraints available, such as small numbers of\nobserved independent modes, to carry out asteroseismology of these stars.\n  Results. We find that, even with a limited number of modes, the core chemical\nstratification (in particular, the location of the steep chemical transitions\nexpected in the oxygen profile) can be determined quite precisely due to the\nsignificant sensitivity of some confined modes to partial reflexion (trapping)\neffects. These effects are similar to the well known trapping induced by the\nshallower chemical transitions at the edge of the core and at the bottom of the\nH-rich envelope. We also find that success to unravel the core structure\ndepends on the information content of the available seismic data.

It is found that our approach\nyields quite similar results as hydrodynamical predictions on the beam energy\ndependence of the directed flow; Transport theory predicts a minimum in the\nexcitation function of the slope of proton directed flow and does indeed yield\nnegative directed flow, if the EoS with a first-order phase transition is\nemployed.

In weakly ionized gas as in PPDs, magnetic flux is largely\nfrozen in the electron fluid, except when resistivity is large. When the disk\nis largely laminar, we show that the relative drift between the electrons and\nions (the Hall-drift), and the ions and neutral fluids (ambipolar-drift) can\nplay a dominant role on the transport of magnetic flux. Using two-dimensional\nsimulations that incorporate the Hall effect and ambipolar diffusion (AD) with\nprescribed diffusivities, we show that when large-scale poloidal field is\naligned with disk rotation, the Hall effect rapidly drags magnetic flux inward\nat the midplane region, while it slowly pushes flux outward above/below the\nmidplane. This leads to a highly radially elongated field configuration as a\nglobal manifestation of the Hall-shear instability. This field configuration\nfurther promotes rapid outward flux transport by AD at the midplane, leading to\ninstability saturation. In quasi-steady state, magnetic flux is transported\noutward at approximately the same rate at all heights, and the rate is\ncomparable to the Hall-free case. For anti-aligned field polarity, the Hall\neffect consistently transports magnetic flux outward, leading to a largely\nvertical field configuration in the midplane region. The field lines in the\nupper layer first bend radially inward and then outward to launch a disk wind.\nOverall, the net rate of outward flux transport is about twice faster than the\naligned case. In addition, the rate of flux transport increases with increasing\ndisk magnetization. The absolute rate of transport is sensitive to disk\nmicrophysics which remains to be explored in future studies.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

Higginbottom \\& Proga recently demonstrated that the\nproperties of thermally-driven winds depend critically on the shape of the\nthermal equilibrium curve, since this determines the thermal stability of the\nirradiated material. For a given spectral energy distribution, the thermal\nequilibrium curve depends on exact balance between the various heating and\ncooling mechanisms at work. Most previous work on thermally-driven disk winds\nrelied an analytical approximation to these rates. Here, we use the\nphotoionization code \\textsc{cloudy} to generate realistic heating and cooling\nrates which we then use in a 2.5D hydrodynamic model computed in ZEUS to\nsimulate thermal winds in a typical black-hole X-ray binary. We find that these\nheating and cooling rates produce a significantly more complex thermal\nequilibrium curve, with dramatically different stability properties. The\nresulting flow, calculated in the optically thin limit, is qualitatively\ndifferent from flows calculated using approximate analytical rates.\nSpecifically, our thermal disk wind is much denser and slower, with a mass-loss\nrate that is a factor of two higher and characteristic velocities that are a\nfactor of three lower. The low velocity of the flow -- $v_{max} \\simeq\n200$~km~s$^{-1}$ -- may be difficult to reconcile with observations. However,\nthe high mass-loss rate -- 15$\\times$ the accretion rate -- is promising, since\nit has the potential to destabilize the disk.

Most of the spatial structure functions\n(SSFs) show that the phase fluctuation increases as a function of baseline\nlength, with a power-law slope of ~0.6. In many cases, we find that the slope\nbecomes shallower (average of ~0.2-0.3) at baseline lengths longer than ~1 km,\nnamely showing a turn-over in SSF. The phase correction method using water\nvapor radiometers (WVRs) works well, especially for the cases where PWV >1 mm,\nwhich reduces the degree of phase fluctuations by a factor of two in many\ncases. However, phase fluctuations still remain after the WVR phase correction,\nsuggesting the existence of other turbulent constituent that cause the phase\nfluctuation. This is supported by occasional SSFs that do not exhibit any\nturn-over; these are only seen when the PWV is low or after WVR phase\ncorrection. This means that the phase fluctuation caused by this turbulent\nconstituent is inherently smaller than that caused by water vapor. Since there\nis no turn-over in the SSF up to the maximum baseline length of ~15 km, this\nturbulent constituent must have scale height of 10 km or more, and thus cannot\nbe water vapor, whose scale height is around 1 km. This large scale height\nturbulent constituent is likely to be water ice or a dry component. Excess path\nlength fluctuation after the WVR phase correction at a baseline length of 10 km\nis large (>200 micron), which is significant for high frequency (>450 GHz or\n<700 micron) observations. These results suggest the need for an additional\nphase correction method, such as fast switching, in addition to the WVR phase\ncorrection. We simulated the fast switching, and the result suggests that it\nworks well, with shorter cycle times linearly improving the coherence.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 7 figures. PASP, in press"]}]

We show that the long-range interaction is\nessentially modified when quasi-degenerate states are available for virtual\ntransitions. A discrepancy in the literature regarding the van der Waals\ncoefficient C_6(2S;1S) describing the interaction of metastable atomic hydrogen\n(2S state) with a ground-state hydrogen atom is resolved. In the the van der\nWaals range a_0 << R << a_0/alpha, where a_0= hbar/(alpha m c) is the Bohr\nradius and alpha is the fine structure constant, one finds the\nsymmetry-dependent result E_{2S;1S}(R) ~ (-176.75 +/- 27.98) E_h (a_0/R)^6 (E_h\ndenotes the Hartree energy). In the Casimir-Polder range a_0/alpha << R << hbar\nc/L, where L = E(2S_{1/2})-E(2P_{1/2}) is the Lamb shift energy, one finds\nE_{2S;1S}(R) ~ (-121.50 +/- 46.61) E_h (a_0/R)^6. In the the Lamb shift range R\n>> hbar c/L, we find an oscillatory tail with a negligible interaction energy\nbelow 10^(-36) Hz. Dirac-delta perturbations to the interaction are also\nevaluated and results are given for all asymptotic distance ranges; these\neffects describe the hyperfine modification of the interaction, or, expressed\ndifferently, the shift of the hydrogen 2S hyperfine frequency due to\ninteractions with neighboring 1S atoms.

The van der Waals shift\nbecomes commensurate with the 2S-2P_{3/2} fine-structure splitting only for\nclose approach (R < 100 a_0, where a_0 is the Bohr radius) and one may thus\nrestrict the discussion to the levels with n=2 and J=1/2 to good approximation.\nBecause each S or P state splits into an F=1 triplet and an F=0 hyperfine\nsinglet (eight states for each atom), the Hamiltonian matrix {\\em a priori} is\nof dimension 64. A careful analysis of symmetries the problem allows one to\nreduce the dimensionality of the most involved irreducible submatrix to 12.

This is done by performing random\ncircuits that would compose to the identity operation if the gates were\nperfect. In the limit of no finite-sampling error, the exponential decay rate\nof the observable survival probabilities, as a function of circuit length,\nyields a single error metric, the \"RB number\" ($r$). This is the quantity that\nRB experiments estimate. For Clifford gates that have reasonably well-behaved\nMarkovian errors, $r$ was believed to reliably correspond to the mean, over all\nCliffords, of the average gate infidelity (AGI) between the imperfect gates and\ntheir ideal counterparts. We refer to this quantity as the average gateset\ninfidelity (AGsI). We show that $r$ does not reliably correspond to the AGsI\nwhen the errors can be gate-dependent, and that AGI and AGsI are not uniquely\ndefined. A particular definition for AGsI is used throughout the literature,\nwhich we call the \"canonical AGsI\". However, $r$ does not generally coincide\nwith it, even approximately. We give explicit examples of this disagreement,\nand a simple explanation: canonical AGsI is not measurable by any experiment\nbecause it does not respect a gauge symmetry. We present an alternative, and\nintuitive, definition of AGsI that is gauge-invariant, and prove that it does\nnot equal $r$ either.

This titanium has been measured with activities\nof $^{238}$U$_{e}$~$<$1.6~mBq/kg, $^{238}$U$_{l}$~$<$0.09~mBq/kg,\n$^{232}$Th$_{e}$~$=0.28\\pm 0.03$~mBq/kg, $^{232}$Th$_{l}$~$=0.25\\pm\n0.02$~mBq/kg, $^{40}$K~$<$0.54~mBq/kg, and $^{60}$Co~$<$0.02~mBq/kg (68\\% CL).\nSuch low intrinsic activities, which are some of the lowest ever reported for\ntitanium, enable its use for future dark matter and other rare event searches.\nMonte Carlo simulations have been performed to assess the expected background\ncontribution from the LZ cryostat with this radioactivity. In 1,000 days of\nWIMP search exposure of a 5.6-tonne fiducial mass, the cryostat will contribute\nonly a mean background of $0.160\\pm0.001$(stat)$\\pm0.030$(sys) counts.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 3 figures, replaced to correct author list, submitted to\n  Astroparticle Physics"]}]

A distinctive feature\nof copepods motility is their ability to perform quick displacements, often\ndubbed jumps, by means of powerful swimming strokes. Such a reaction has been\nassociated to an escape behaviour from flow disturbances due to predators or\nother external dangers. In the present study, the encounter rate of copepods in\na developed turbulent flow with intensity comparable to the one found in\ncopepods' habitat is numerically investigated. This is done by means of a\nLagrangian copepod (LC) model that mimics the jump escape reaction behaviour\nfrom localised high-shear rate fluctuations in the turbulent flows. Our\nanalysis shows that the encounter rate for copepods of typical perception\nradius of ~ {\\eta}, where {\\eta} is the dissipative scale of turbulence, can be\nincreased by a factor up to ~ 100 compared to the one experienced by passively\ntransported fluid tracers. Furthermore, we address the effect of introducing in\nthe LC model a minimal waiting time between consecutive jumps. It is shown that\nany encounter-rate enhancement is lost if such time goes beyond the dissipative\ntime-scale of turbulence, {\\tau}_{\\eta}. Because typically in the ocean {\\eta}\n~ 0.001m and {\\tau}_{\\eta} ~ 1s, this provides stringent constraints on the\nturbulent-driven enhancement of encounter-rate due to a purely mechanical\ninduced escape reaction.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 10 figures"]}]

Recently, Cs$_2$AgInCl$_6$ has been\nreported as a new lead-free halide double perovskite with a direct bandgap,\nwhich is a preferred property for thin-film solar cell applications. However,\nwhile the synthesized Cs$_2$AgInCl$_6$ powders exhibit white coloration with an\nexperimentally measured optical bandgap of 3.3 eV, the photoluminescence\nemission energy is only 2.0 eV.

The large difference between the\nfundamental (independent of allowed/forbidden transition) and the optical\n(derived from allowed transition) bandgaps renders this double perovskite\nunsuitable for efficient thin-film photovoltaic applications.

The young stellar population remains kinematically associated with the\nmolecular gas, following a ~10km/s $v_r$ gradient along the 40pc long filament.\nHowever, near the center of the region stars appear ~1km/s blue-shifted with\nrespect to the gas and show an asymmetric $v_r$ distribution. This region is\nslightly older and less embedded than average, suggesting that the remaining\ngas is mostly behind the population along the line of sight. We find evidence\nfor kinematic subclustering, detecting statistically significant groupings of\nco-located stars with coherent motions. These are mostly in the lower-density,\ndispersed filament south of the ONC, which, on the other hand, appears\ndynamically evolved. The 1-D velocity dispersion is roughly constant throughout\nthe region (2-2.5km/s). The ONC has a virial parameter $\\alpha$~1.8, i.e., near\nthe limit for the cluster to remain bound. In the ONC we also find some\nevidence for on-going expansion, from a correlation between $v_r$ and\nextinction. In the lower-density region south of the ONC, the velocity\ndispersion is ~3 times larger than expected from virial equilibrium, i.e.,\nunbound. The origin of these high stellar velocities remains somewhat unclear,\nespecially since the velocity dispersion of the gas is consistent a virial\nstate.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 12 figures, submitted to ApJ.

By integrating a linear phase ramp to the\ncoronagraphic phase pattern, two separated coronagraphic PSFs are created with\na single pupil-plane optic, which makes it robust and easy to install in\nexisting telescopes.

However, the real-world deployment\nof such drone delivery systems faces many cyber-physical security challenges.\nIn this paper, a novel mathematical framework for analyzing and enhancing the\nsecurity of drone delivery systems is introduced. In this regard, a zero-sum\nnetwork interdiction game is formulated between a vendor, operating a drone\ndelivery system, and a malicious attacker. In this game, the vendor seeks to\nfind the optimal path that its UAV should follow, to deliver a purchase from\nthe vendor's warehouse to a customer location, to minimize the delivery time.\nMeanwhile, an attacker seeks to choose an optimal location to interdict the\npotential paths of the UAVs, so as to inflict cyber or physical damage to it,\nthus, maximizing its delivery time. First, the Nash equilibrium point of this\ngame is characterized. Then, to capture the subjective behavior of both the\nvendor and attacker, new notions from prospect theory are incorporated into the\ngame. These notions allow capturing the vendor's and attacker's i) subjective\nperception of attack success probabilities, and ii) their disparate subjective\nvaluations of the achieved delivery times relative to a certain target delivery\ntime. Simulation results have shown that the subjective decision making of the\nvendor and attacker leads to adopting risky path selection strategies which\ninflict delays to the delivery, thus, yielding unexpected delivery times which\nsurpass the target delivery time set by the vendor.\n","Comment: 2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications - Communication\n  and Information Systems Security Symposium"]}]

Similarly, the effect of electromagnetic induction can\nincrease or decrease the currents with the corresponding mechanical work linked\nto these developments.

Our aim with this paper is to validate this\nhypothesis by performing experiments with three different recognition tasks\n(Aurora 4, CHiME 2 and CHiME 3) and assess the discriminability of the\ninformation encoded by Gabor filterbank features. Additionally, to identify the\ncontribution of low, medium and high temporal modulation frequencies subsets of\nthe Gabor filterbank were used as features (dubbed LTM, MTM and HTM\nrespectively). With temporal modulation frequencies between 16 and 25 Hz, HTM\nconsistently outperformed the remaining ones in every condition, highlighting\nthe robustness of these representations against channel distortions, low\nsignal-to-noise ratios and acoustically challenging real-life scenarios with\nrelative improvements from 11 to 56% against a Mel-filterbank-DNN baseline. To\nexplain the results, a measure of similarity between phoneme classes from DNN\nactivations is proposed and linked to their acoustic properties.
