When stochastic gradient is used, it can\nnaturally damp the gradient noise to stabilize SGD. Efficient preconditioner\nestimation methods are developed, and with reasonable simplifications, they are\napplicable to large scaled problems.

This induces a functional coupling between\nmovement and sensation, since tumbling probability is controlled by the\ninternal state of the organism which, in turn, depends on previous signal\nlevels. Although a negative feedback tends to maintain this internal state\nclose to adapted levels, positive feedback can arise when motion up the\ngradient reduces tumbling probability, further boosting drift up the gradient.\nImportantly, such positive feedback can drive large fluctuations in the\ninternal state, complicating analytical approaches. Previous studies focused on\nwhat happens when the negative feedback dominates the dynamics. By contrast, we\nshow here that there is a large portion of physiologically-relevant parameter\nspace where the positive feedback can dominate, even when gradients are\nrelatively shallow. We demonstrate how large transients emerge because of\nnon-normal dynamics (non-orthogonal eigenvectors near a stable fixed point)\ninherent in the positive feedback, and further identify a fundamental\nnonlinearity that strongly amplifies their effect.

These polaritons are formed from a hybrid\n\"supermode\" of cavity photons coupled to atomic density waves of a quantum gas.\nBecause the cavity supports multiple photon spatial modes, and because the\nmatter-light coupling can be comparable to the energy splitting of these modes,\nthe composition of the supermode polariton is changed by the matter-light\ncoupling upon condensation. These results, found in the few-mode-degenerate\ncavity regime, demonstrate the potential of fully multimode cavities to exhibit\nphysics beyond mean-field theories. Such systems will provide experimental\naccess to nontrivial phase transitions in driven dissipative quantum systems as\nwell as enabling the studies of novel non-equilibrium spin glasses and\nneuromorphic computation.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 9 figures"]}]

Scene categories are often defined by multi-level\ninformation, including local objects, global layout, and background\nenvironment, thus leading to large intra-class variations. In addition, with\nthe increasing number of scene categories, label ambiguity has become another\ncrucial issue in large-scale classification. This paper focuses on large-scale\nscene recognition and makes two major contributions to tackle these issues.\nFirst, we propose a multi-resolution CNN architecture that captures visual\ncontent and structure at multiple levels. The multi-resolution CNNs are\ncomposed of coarse resolution CNNs and fine resolution CNNs, which are\ncomplementary to each other. Second, we design two knowledge guided\ndisambiguation techniques to deal with the problem of label ambiguity. (i) We\nexploit the knowledge from the confusion matrix computed on validation data to\nmerge ambiguous classes into a super category. (ii) We utilize the knowledge of\nextra networks to produce a soft label for each image. Then the super\ncategories or soft labels are employed to guide CNN training on the Places2. We\nconduct extensive experiments on three large-scale image datasets (ImageNet,\nPlaces, and Places2), demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.\nFurthermore, our method takes part in two major scene recognition challenges,\nand achieves the second place at the Places2 challenge in ILSVRC 2015, and the\nfirst place at the LSUN challenge in CVPR 2016.

The outer and inner regions are taken\nto be the Ba\\~{n}ados-Teitelbom-Zanelli (BTZ) spacetime and the vacuum ground\nstate anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, respectively. By applying the first law\nof thermodynamics to the extremal shell one shows that its entropy is an\narbitrary function of the gravitational area $A_+$ alone, $S=S(A_+)$. When the\nshell approaches its own gravitational radius $r_+$ and turns into an extremal\nrotating BTZ black hole, it is found that the entropy of the spacetime remains\nsuch a function of $A_+$. It is thus vindicated, that extremal black holes,\nhere extremal BTZ black holes, have different properties from the corresponding\nnonextremal black holes, which have the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy $S(A_+)=\n\\frac{A_+}{4G}$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant. It is argued that for\nthe extremal case $0\\leq S(A_+)\\leq \\frac{A_+}{4G}$. Thus, rather than having\njust two entropies for extremal black holes, as previous results debated, 0 and\n$\\frac{A_+}{4G}$, it is shown that extremal black holes may have a continuous\nrange of entropies, limited by precisely those two entropies. Surely, the\nentropy that a particular extremal black hole picks must depend on past\nprocesses, notably on how it was formed. It is also found a remarkable relation\nbetween the third law of thermodynamics and the impossibility for a massive\nbody to reach the velocity of light. In the procedure, it becomes clear that\nthere are two distinct angular velocities for the shell, the mechanical and\nthermodynamic angular velocities. In passing, we clarify, for a static\nspacetime with a thermal shell, the meaning of the Tolman temperature formula\nat a generic radius and at the shell.

The second segment of the superoutburst\nhad a long duration of 33 d and a very gentle decline with a rate of 0.02\nmag/d, and it displayed an extended post-outburst decline lasting at least 500\nd. Simultaneously with the start of the rapid fading from the superoutburst\nplateau, the system showed the appearance of a strong near-infrared excess\nresulting in very red colours, which reached extreme values (B-I~1.4) about 20\nd later. The colours then became bluer again, but it took at least 250 d to\nacquire a stable level. Superhumps were clearly visible in the light curve from\nour very first time-resolved observations until at least 420 d after the rapid\nfading from the superoutburst. The spectroscopic and photometric data revealed\nan orbital period of 109.80 min and a fractional superhump period excess <0.8\nper cent, indicating a very low mass ratio q<0.045. With such a small mass\nratio the donor mass should be below the hydrogen-burning minimum mass limit.\nThe observed infrared flux in quiescence is indeed much lower than is expected\nfrom a cataclysmic variable with a near-main-sequence donor star.

A total of 453 tracked PMJ events were\nfound, or 4253 PMJs detections tallied over all timeframes and a detection rate\nof 21 events per timestep. From these, an average length, width and lifetime of\n640 km, 210 km and 90 s were obtained. The average PMJ Ca II 8542 Angstrom line\nprofile is characterized by enhanced inner wings, often in the form of one or\ntwo distinct peaks, and a brighter line core as compared to the quiet Sun\naverage. Average blue and red peak positions were determined at -10.4 km/s and\n+10.2 km/s offsets from the Ca II 8542 Angstrom line core. We found several\nclusters of PMJ hotspots within the sunspot penumbra, where PMJ events occur in\nthe same general area repeatedly over time. Our results indicate smaller\naverage PMJs sizes and longer lifetimes compared to previously published\nvalues, but with statistics still in the same orders of magnitude.

These synapses possess a ribbon-like structure capable\nof storing around 100 synaptic vesicles, allowing graded responses through the\nrelease of different numbers of vesicles in response to visual input. These\nresponses depend critically on the ability of the ribbon to replenish itself as\nribbon sites empty upon release. The rate of vesicle replenishment is thus an\nimportant factor in shaping neural coding in the retina.

Our general theory\ndemonstrates that the detected Raman spectrum originates from an interplay\nbetween nonlinear light generation and propagation. Counter intuitively, at the\nnonlinear generation stage, we show that the Stokes (anti-Stokes) signal at the\nmolecule location depends on the plasmonic enhancements, through the local\ndensity of photon states (LDOS), at the anti-Stokes (Stokes) frequency.\nHowever, when propagating from the vibrating molecule to the far field, the\nStokes (anti-Stokes) emission experiences a plasmonic enhancement at the Stokes\n(anti-Stokes) frequency, as expected. We identify the limits of the commonly\nknown E^4 electric-field rule for Raman signal enhancement near plasmonic\nsurfaces at low pump powers, as well as a different E^8 rule at high pump\npowers, and we clarify the role of the LDOS.

In this paper, we present a\nsystematic analysis of the competition between the polaron and anti-polaron\nunder the interplay of the coupling strength and the asymmetric term. While\nintuitively the anti-polaron should be secondary owing to its higher potential\nenergy, we find that, under certain conditions, the minor anti-polaron may gain\na reversal in the weight over the major polaron. If the asymmetric amplitude\n$\\epsilon$ is smaller than the harmonic frequency $\\omega$, such an\noverweighted anti-polaron can occur beyond a critical value of the coupling\nstrength $g$; if $\\epsilon$ is larger, the anti-polaron can even be always\noverweighted at any $g$. We propose that the explicit occurrence of the\noverweighted anti-polaron can be monitored by a displacement transition from\nnegative to positive values.

The\ndifficulty is also that the corresponding optimization problems are non-convex,\nbut the required accuracy is high. Therefore, we formulate the ISL and WISL\nminimization problems as non-convex quartic optimization problems in frequency\ndomain, and then simplify them into quadratic problems by utilizing the\nmajorization-minimization technique, which is one of the basic techniques for\naddressing large-scale and/or non-convex optimization problems.

Rolling occurs\nspontaneously when the ratio of iceberg width to height falls below a critical\nthreshold.

This model is used to decipher relevant scaling\nparameters that explain the variations in circulation, entrainment and\nreattachment length. A low-Strouhal-number regime is observed for which\nvortices are formed at a late stage relative to the recirculation region,\ncausing a decrease in effectiveness. For high Strouhal numbers vortices are\nbeing re-ingested into the actuator or are packed so close together that they\ncancel each other, both decreasing the effectiveness of forcing. In the\nintermediate regime a vortex train is formed of which the decay of circulation\nincreases for increasing Strouhal number. The scaling of this decay fully\nexplains the observed variation in reattachment length.\n"]}]

In particular, the\nstatistical occurrence of their surface magnetism has been established (~10%)\nand the field origin is now understood to be fossil. However, fundamental\nquestions remain: how do these fossil fields evolve during the post-main\nsequence phases, and how do they influence the evolution of hot stars from the\nmain sequence to their ultimate demise? Filling the void of known magnetic\nevolved hot (OBA) stars, studying the evolution of their fossil magnetic fields\nalong stellar evolution, and understanding the impact of these fields on the\nangular momentum, rotation, mass loss, and evolution of the star itself, is\ncrucial to answering these questions, with far reaching consequences, in\nparticular for the properties of the precursors of supernovae explosions and\nstellar remnants. In the framework of the BRITE spectropolarimetric survey and\nLIFE project, we have discovered the first few magnetic hot supergiants. Their\nlongitudinal surface magnetic field is very weak but their configuration\nresembles those of main sequence hot stars. We present these first\nobservational results and propose to interpret them at first order in the\ncontext of magnetic flux conservation as the radius of the star expands with\nevolution. We then also consider the possible impact of stellar structure\nchanges along evolution.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 2 figures, IAUS 329 conference proceeding"]}]
