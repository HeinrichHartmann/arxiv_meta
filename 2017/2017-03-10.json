We obtain the optimal quantum Fisher\ninformation for parameters in time-dependent Hamiltonians, and show proper\nHamiltonian control is necessary to optimize the Fisher information. We derive\nthe optimal Hamiltonian control, which is generally adaptive, and the\nmeasurement scheme to attain the optimal Fisher information. In a minimal\nexample of a qubit in a rotating magnetic field, we find a surprising result\nthat the fundamental limit of $T^{2}$ time scaling of quantum Fisher\ninformation can be broken with time-dependent Hamiltonians, which reaches\n$T^{4}$ in estimating the rotation frequency of the field. We conclude by\nconsidering level crossings in the derivatives of the Hamiltonians, and point\nout additional control is necessary for that case.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 5 figures.

It has been shown that\ncurvature perturbations generated by the inflaton are identical in both frames,\nmeaning that observables such as the spectrum of cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) anisotropies are independent of whether matter fields---including those\nin the standard model of particle physics---minimally couple to the brane or\nthe bulk metric/frame. This is true despite the fact that the observables are\neventually measured by the matter fields and that the total action including\nthe matter fields is different in the two cases. In contrast, in curvaton\nscenarios, the observables depend on the frame to which the curvaton minimally\ncouples. Among all inflationary scenarios, we focus on two models motivated by\nthe KKLMMT fine-tuning problem: a slow-roll inflation with an inflection-point\npotential and a model of a rapidly rolling inflaton that conformally couples to\ngravity. In the first model, the difference between the frames in which the\ncurvaton resides is encoded in the spectral index of the curvature\nperturbations, depicting the nature of the frame transformation.

The p/He decrease is often\ninterpreted in terms of particle-dependent acceleration, which is in contrast\nwith the universal nature of DSA mechanisms. A different explanation is that\nthe p-He anomaly reflects a flux transition between two components: a sub-TeV\nflux component (L) provided by hydrogen-rich supernova remnants with soft\nacceleration spectra, and a multi-TeV component (G) injected by younger sources\nwith amplified magnetic fields and hard spectra.

Bipartite\nnetworks are often analyzed after projecting them onto one of the two sets of\nnodes. As a result of the projection, nodes of the same set are linked together\nif they have at least one neighbor in common in the bipartite network. Even\nthough these projections allow one to study bipartite networks using tools\ndeveloped for unipartite networks, one-mode projections lead to significant\nloss of information and artificial inflation of the projected network with\nfully connected subgraphs.

We examine training at reduced\nprecision, both from a theoretical and practical perspective, and ask: is it\npossible to train models at end-to-end low precision with provable guarantees?\nCan this lead to consistent order-of-magnitude speedups? We present a framework\ncalled ZipML to answer these questions. For linear models, the answer is yes.\nWe develop a simple framework based on one simple but novel strategy called\ndouble sampling. Our framework is able to execute training at low precision\nwith no bias, guaranteeing convergence, whereas naive quantization would\nintroduce significant bias. We validate our framework across a range of\napplications, and show that it enables an FPGA prototype that is up to 6.5x\nfaster than an implementation using full 32-bit precision. We further develop a\nvariance-optimal stochastic quantization strategy and show that it can make a\nsignificant difference in a variety of settings. When applied to linear models\ntogether with double sampling, we save up to another 1.7x in data movement\ncompared with uniform quantization. When training deep networks with quantized\nmodels, we achieve higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art XNOR-Net.

By reducing a system's symmetry, through the application\nof a magnetic field or uniaxial pressure, these dynamics can be modified.

After applying uniaxial pressure to the sample in situ, both\nthe magnitude and field position of the QTM steps changed. The step magnitudes\nwere observed to grow as a function of pressure in both arrangements of\npressure, while pressure applied along (perpendicular to) the sample's easy\naxis caused the resonant-tunneling fields to increase (decrease). These\nobservations were compared with simulations in which the system's Hamiltonian\nparameters were changed.

One\nproposed model for the transport and release of mechanical energy generated in\nthe sub-phorospheric layers and photosphere is the nanoflare model that\nincorporates Ohmic heating which releases a part of the energy stored in the\nmagnetic field via magnetic reconnection. The problem with the verification of\nthis model is that we cannot resolve observationally small scale events.\nHistograms of observable characteristics of flares, show powerlaw behavior, for\nboth energy release rate, size and total energy. Depending on the powerlaw\nindex of the energy release, nanoflares might be an important candidate for\ncoronal heating; we seek to find that index. In this paper, we employ a\nnumerical 3D-MHD simulation produced by the numerical code Bifrost, and a new\ntechnique to identify the 3D heating events at a specific instant. The quantity\nwe explore is the Joule heating, which is explicitly correlated with the\nmagnetic reconnection because depends on the curl of the magnetic field.

The identified energy events do not\nrepresent all the released energy, but of the identified events, the total\nenergy of the largest events dominate the energy release. Most of the energy\nrelease happens in the lower corona, while heating drops with height.

We use a custom\nbuilt confocal rheoscope to image the particle configurations of a colloidal\nsuspension while simultaneously measuring the viscosity.

As the gap decreases below 15 particle\ndiameters, the viscosity first decreases from its bulk value, shows\nfluctuations with the gap, and then sharply increases for gaps below three\nparticle diameters. Further, we compare our experimental results to two\nsimulations techniques that enables us to determine the relative contributions\nof hydrodynamic and short range repulsive stresses. The first method uses the\nlubrication approximation to find the hydrodynamic stress and includes a short\nrange repulsive force between the particles and the second is a Stokesian\ndynamics simulation that calculates the full hydrodynamic stress in the\nsuspension.

We measured the line-of-sight stellar velocity distribution\nwithin the bulge effective radius from the long-slit spectra taken with high\nspectral resolution at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. We used the\nphotometric and kinematic properties of the sample bulges to study their\nlocation in the Fundamental Plane, Kormendy, and Faber-Jackson relations\ndefined for ellipticals and large bulges. We found that our sample bulges\nsatisfy some of the photometric and kinematic prescriptions for being\nconsidered disk-like bulges such as small sizes and masses with nearly\nexponential light profiles, small bulge-to-total luminosity ratios, low stellar\nvelocity dispersions, and ongoing star formation. However, each of them follows\nthe same scaling relations of ellipticals, massive bulges, and compact\nearly-type galaxies so they cannot be classified as disk-like systems. We find\na single population of galaxy spheroids that follow the same scaling relations,\nwhere the mass seems to lead to a smooth transition in the photometric and\nkinematic properties from less massive bulges to more massive bulges and\nellipticals.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A, 20 pages, 10 figures"]}]

We show that the complexity landscape is surprisingly rich,\nusing a variety of technical tools: automata-based compilation to d-DNNF\nlineages as in [4], \\b{eta}-acyclic lineages using [10], the X-property for\ntractable CSP from [24], graded DAGs [27] and various coding techniques for\nhardness proofs.\n","Comment: 34 pages including 4 appendix sections, 8 figures, 3 tables, 35\n  references.

We\nanalyse a number of different quantities to validate that the black hole\nproduced is indeed a Kerr-Newman one and show that, in the absence of rotation\nor magnetic field, the end result of the collapse is a Schwarzschild or Kerr\nblack hole, respectively.\n","Comment: MNRAS accepted"]}]

This includes jackknife and\nbootstrap as estimators for the full survey area, and subsampling as an\nestimator of the covariance of subsamples. The limitations of the jackknife\ncovariance have been previously presented in the literature, basically because\nit is effectively a rescaling of the covariance of the subsample area. However\nwe point out that subsampling is also biased but for a different reason: the\nsubsamples are not independent, and the corresponding lack of power results in\nSSC underprediction. We develop the formalism in the case of cluster counts\nthat allows to predict exactly the bias of each covariance estimator. We find\nsignificant effects for a small scale area or when a low number of subsamples\nis used, with auto-redshift biases ranging from 0.4% to 15% for subsampling and\nfrom 5% to 75% for jackknife covariance estimates. The cross-redshift\ncovariance is even more affected, with biases ranging from 8% to 25% for\nsubsampling and from 50% to 90% for jackknife. Due to the redshift evolution of\nthe probe, the covariances cannot be debiased by a simple rescaling factor, and\nan exact debiasing has the same requirements as the full SSC prediction.

A fundamental limit in nearly all applications based\non such systems arises from spontaneous emission, in which photons are absorbed\nby atoms and then re-scattered into undesired channels. In typical treatments\nof atomic ensembles, it is assumed that this re-scattering occurs\nindependently, and at a rate given by a single isolated atom, which in turn\ngives rise to standard limits of fidelity in applications such as quantum\nmemories or quantum gates. However, this assumption can be violated. In\nparticular, spontaneous emission of a collective atomic excitation can be\nsignificantly suppressed through strong interference in emission. Thus far the\nphysics underlying the phenomenon of subradiance and techniques to exploit it\nhave not been well-understood. In this work, we provide a comprehensive\ntreatment of this problem. First, we show that in ordered atomic arrays in free\nspace, subradiant states acquire an interpretation in terms of optical modes\nthat are guided by the array, which only emit due to scattering from the ends\nof the finite chain. We also elucidate the properties of subradiant states in\nthe many-excitation limit. Finally, we introduce the new concept of selective\nradiance. Whereas subradiant states experience a reduced coupling to all\noptical modes, selectively radiant states are tailored to simultaneously\nradiate efficiently into a desired channel while scattering into undesired\nchannels is suppressed, thus enabling an enhanced atom-light interface. We show\nthat these states naturally appear in chains of atoms coupled to nanophotonic\nstructures, and we analyze the performance of photon storage exploiting such\nstates.

There is significant evidence T-cells achieve\nthis remarkable performance utilizing a network architecture based on kinetic\nproofreading (KPR). KPR-based mechanisms actively consume energy to increase\nthe specificity beyond what is possible in equilibrium. An important\ntheoretical question that arises is to understand the trade-offs and\nfundamental limits on accuracy, speed, and dissipation (energy consumption).\nRecent theoretical work suggests that it should always be possible to reduce\nthe error of KPR-based mechanisms by waiting longer and/or consuming more\nenergy. Surprisingly, we find that this is not the case and that there actually\nexists an optimal point in the speed-energy-accuracy plane for KPR and its\ngeneralizations. We give general arguments for why we expect this optimal to be\na generic property of all KPR-based biochemical networks and discuss\nimplications for our understanding of the T cell receptor circuit.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 6 figures"]}]
