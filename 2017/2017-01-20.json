Assuming that the\nreference gene is read in frame +0, an overlapping gene can be encoded in two\nreading frames in the sense strand, denoted by +1 and +2, and in three reading\nframes in the opposite strand, denoted by -0, -1 and -2. This motivated\nnumerous researchers to study the constraints induced by the genetic code on\nthe various overlapping frames, mostly based on information theory. Our focus\nin this paper is on the constraints induced on two overlapping genes in terms\nof amino acids, as well as polypeptides. We show that simple linear constraints\nbind the amino acid composition of two proteins encoded by overlapping genes.\nNovel constraints are revealed when polypeptides are considered, and not just\nsingle amino acids. For example, in double-coding sequences with an overlapping\nreading frame -2, each Tyrosine (denoted as Tyr or Y) in the overlapping frame\noverlaps a Tyrosine in the reference frame +0 (and reciprocally), whereas\nspecific words (e.g. YY) never occur. We thus distinguish between null\nconstraints (YY = 0 in frame -2) and non-null constraints (Y in frame +0 <=> Y\nin frame -2). Our equivalence-based constraints are symmetrical and thus enable\nthe characterization of the joint composition of overlapping proteins.

RANSAC\ndiscriminates outliers by randomly generating minimalistic sampled hypotheses\nand verifying their consensus over the input data. Its response is based on the\nsingle hypothesis that obtained the largest inlier support. In this article we\nshow that the resulting accuracy can be improved by aggregating all generated\nhypotheses. This yields RANSAAC, a framework that improves systematically over\nRANSAC and its state-of-the-art variants by statistically aggregating\nhypotheses. To this end, we introduce a simple strategy that allows to rapidly\naverage 2D transformations, leading to an almost negligible extra computational\ncost.

In particular we examine whether zero-mode\noperators analogous to Majorana zero-modes can be found in these models when\none introduces chiral parameters to break time reversal symmetry. The existence\nof such zero-modes implies $N$-fold degeneracies throughout the energy\nspectrum. We address the question directly through these degeneracies by\ncharacterising the entire energy spectrum using perturbation theory and exact\ndiagonalisation. We find that when $N$ is prime, and the length $L$ of the wire\nis finite, the spectrum exhibits degeneracies up to a splitting that decays\nexponentially with system size, for generic values of the chiral parameters.\nHowever, at particular parameter values (resonance points), band crossings\nappear in the unperturbed spectrum that typically result in a splitting of the\ndegeneracy at finite order. We find strong evidence that these preclude the\nexistence of strong zero-modes for generic values of the chiral parameters. In\nparticular we show that in the thermodynamic limit, the resonance points become\ndense in the chiral parameter space. When $N$ is not prime, the situation is\nqualitatively different, and degeneracies in the energy spectrum are split at\nfinite order in perturbation theory for generic parameter values, even when the\nlength of the wire $L$ is finite. Exceptions to these general findings can\noccur at special \"anti-resonant\" points. Here the evidence points to the\nexistence of strong zero modes and, in the case of the achiral point of the the\n$N=4$ model, we are able to construct these modes exactly.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 16 figures"]}]

The metasurface is described in terms of Lorentzian\nelectric and magnetic surface susceptibilities, $\\chi_\\text{ee}$ and\n$\\chi_\\text{mm}$, respectively, and its resonant frequencies are periodically\nmodulated in both space and time.

Finally, the computed steady-state scattered fields\nare Fourier propagated analytically, for visualization of refracted harmonics.\nThe proposed method is simple and versatile and able to determine the\nsteady-state response of a space-time modulated Huygen's metasurface, for\narbitrary modulation frequencies and depths.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures"]}]

Unfortunately,\ncurrent solutions fail to meet these requirements. First, existing database\nsolutions fail to expose a high-level programming abstraction in which latency\nof transactions can be influenced and reasoned about by application developers.\nSecond, these solutions either inhibit or limit infrastructure engineers in\nexercising low-level control on the deployment of the system on a target\ninfrastructure, further impacting performance.\n  In this paper, we propose a relational actor programming model for in-memory\ndatabases.

In this paper, we explore the advantages of using higher-order\ncorrelations; specifically, we introduce Higher-order Kernel (HOK) descriptors\ngenerated from the late fusion of CNN classifier scores from all the frames in\na sequence. To generate these descriptors, we use the idea of kernel\nlinearization. Specifically, a similarity kernel matrix, which captures the\ntemporal evolution of deep classifier scores, is first linearized into kernel\nfeature maps. The HOK descriptors are then generated from the higher-order\nco-occurrences of these feature maps, and are then used as input to a\nvideo-level classifier. We provide experiments on two fine-grained action\nrecognition datasets and show that our scheme leads to state-of-the-art\nresults.\n","Comment: 9 pages"]}]

As the steady\nstates at rest are not relevant for blood flow, we construct two well-balanced\nhydrostatic reconstruction techniques designed to preserve low-Shapiro number\nsteady states that may occur in large network simulations. The Shapiro number S\nh = u/c is the equivalent of the Froude number for shallow water equations and\nthe Mach number for compressible Euler equations.

The second is the\nsubsonic hydrostatic reconstruction (HR-S), adapted here to blood flow and\ndesigned to exactly preserve all subcritical steady states. We systematically\ncompare HR, HR-LS and HR-S in a series of single artery and arterial network\nnumerical tests designed to evaluate their well-balanced and wave-capturing\nproperties.

We found that the\npre-maximum spectrum of PS1-12bwh is well matched by a synthetic spectrum\ngenerated from a model with a lower density in the high velocity ($\\gtrsim$6000\nkm~s$^{-1}$) ejecta than SN 2005hk. The observed differences between SN 2005hk\nand PS1-12bwh may therefore be attributed primarily to differences in the high\nvelocity ejecta alone, while comparable densities for the lower velocity ejecta\nwould explain the nearly identical post-maximum spectra. These two supernovae\nfurther highlight the diversity within the SNe Iax class, as well as the\nchallenges in spectroscopically identifying and phasing these objects,\nespecially at early epochs.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 8 figures.

CMEs\nrepresent highly interpretable phenomena for a wide range of applications in\nengineering, social sciences and genomics. The challenge in model selection\nlies in the grouped collinearity structure of CMEs, which can cause poor\nselection and prediction performance for existing methods. We propose a new\nmethod called cmenet, which employs coordinate descent and two principles\ncalled CME coupling and reduction to efficiently perform model selection.\nSimulation studies demonstrate the improved performance of cmenet over existing\nselection methods, such as the LASSO and SparseNet. Applied to a gene\nassociation study on fly wing shape, cmenet not only provides improved\npredictive performance over existing techniques, but also reveals important\ninsight on gene activation behavior.

The\nmeasurements were conducted using 81 keV and 356 keV gamma-rays from a\ncollimated 133Ba source. The 3D position reconstruction of interaction points\nwas performed using artificial neural networks trained with experimental data.\nAlthough the position resolution was significantly better for the thinner\ncrystal, the 20 mm thick CeBr3 crystal showed an acceptable resolution of about\n5.4 mm FWHM for the x and y coordinates, and 7.8 mm FWHM for the z-coordinate\n(crystal depth) at 356 keV. These values were obtained from the full position\nscans of the crystal sides. The position resolution of the LaBr3:Ce crystal was\nfound to be considerably worse, presumably due to the highly diffusive optical\nin- terface between the crystal and the optical window of the enclosure. The\nenergy resolution (FWHM) measured for 662 keV gamma-rays was 4.0% for LaBr3:Ce\nand 5.5% for CeBr3.

However, the relaxation process can be\nvery slow, and quasi-stationary non-thermal plateaux are often observed at\nintermediate times. The typical example is a quantum quench in an integrable\nmodel with weak integrability breaking; for a long time, the state can not\nescape the constraints imposed by the approximate integrability. Here we unveil\na new mechanism of prethermalization, based on the presence of a symmetry of\nthe pre-quench Hamiltonian, which is spontaneously broken at zero temperature,\nand is explicitly broken by the post-quench Hamiltonian. The typical time scale\nof the phenomenon is proportional to the thermal correlation length of the\ninitial state, which diverges as the temperature is lowered. We show that the\nprethermal quasi-stationary state can be approximated by a mixed state that\nviolates cluster decomposition property.
