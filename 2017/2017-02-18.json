Recent advances have suggested that\nthe weighted nuclear norm minimization (WNNM) is expected to be more\nappropriate than NNM. However, it still lacks a plausible mathematical\nexplanation why WNNM is more appropriate than NNM. In this paper, we analyze\nthe WNNM and NNM from a point of the group sparse representation (GSR).\nFirstly, an adaptive dictionary for each group is designed. Then we show\nmathematically that WNNM is more appropriate than NNM. We exploit the proposed\nscheme to two typical low level vision tasks, including image deblurring and\nimage compressive sensing (CS) recovery. Experimental results have demonstrated\nthat the proposed scheme outperforms many state-of-the-art methods.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1611.08983"]}]
