Critical observability is a property\nof FSMs that corresponds to the possibility of detecting if the current state\nof an FSM belongs to a set of critical states modeling operations that may be\nunsafe or, in general, operations of specific interest in a particular\napplication. A critical observer is an observer that detects on-line the\noccurrence of critical states.

Collapse is displayed in the way that\nthe wavefunction's evolution becomes unstable at certain critical expansions of\nspacetime, at which it reconfigures via a self-reinforcing mechanism\nquasi-abruptly to an evolution resembling a classical trajectory. Thereby,\nspacetime geometry changes in favour of the winning state, which causes the\npath of the other state to vanish by destructive interference. This mechanism\nfor collapse can explain the quantum correlations in EPR experiments without\ncoming into conflict with relativity and the Free Will theorem.

While our random walk-based method is not comparable to\nrouting-based methods in terms of latency, we prove that it is theoretically no\nmore than a logarithmic factor higher than the worst case latency. The main\ncontribution of our paper, however, is the throughput result: we show that the\nrate at which our algorithm can collect data is lower bounded by the spectral\ngap of the random walk's transition matrix, which is, in turn, proportional to\nthe spectral gap of the network for regular graphs.

The fuel\nrequired for each journey was calculated for various types of propulsion\nsystems to determine the viability of low-acceleration rockets to colonise the\nMilky Way.

Such transit\ntimes are clearly impractical, and thus, any kind of colonisation using low\nacceleration rockets would be difficult. High accelerations, on the order of\n1g, are likely required to complete interstellar journeys within a reasonable\ntime frame, though they may require prohibitively large amounts of fuel.

Specifically, the\npancreas demonstrates very high inter-patient anatomical variability in both\nits shape and volume. In this paper, we present an automated system using 3D\ncomputed tomography (CT) volumes via a two-stage cascaded approach: pancreas\nlocalization and segmentation. For the first step, we localize the pancreas\nfrom the entire 3D CT scan, providing a reliable bounding box for the more\nrefined segmentation step. We introduce a fully deep-learning approach, based\non an efficient application of holistically-nested convolutional networks\n(HNNs) on the three orthogonal axial, sagittal, and coronal views. The\nresulting HNN per-pixel probability maps are then fused using pooling to\nreliably produce a 3D bounding box of the pancreas that maximizes the recall.\nWe show that our introduced localizer compares favorably to both a conventional\nnon-deep-learning method and a recent hybrid approach based on spatial\naggregation of superpixels using random forest classification.

Here, employing NMR spectroscopy, we show that the\nanisotropic WFs appearing in a quasi-2D organic conductor possess an\nextraordinarily strong Coulomb correlation. We find that this characteristic\nleads to a tremendous enhancement of the NMR index of spin correlations (the\nKorringa ratio), given by the ratio of the relaxation rate to the square of the\nspectral shift, by a factor of ~$10^3$ from the values in ordinary metals. Our\nmodel calculations based on renormalization-group treatment reveal that the\nobserved enormous spin correlation is a general characteristic of WF systems,\narising from the short-wavelength correlations that persist at low energy\ndespite the drastic suppression of the long-wavelength correlations by the\nrunning Coulomb coupling. On further cooling, the dynamic spin susceptibility\n(probed by the relaxation rate) shows a sudden increase, which is identified by\nmodel calculations within the ladder approximation as indicating spin-triplet\nexcitonic fluctuations -- precursors to mass generation associated with chiral\nsymmetry breaking.\n"]}]

The existing HSI denoising methods mainly focus on specific spectral\nand spatial prior knowledge in HSIs, and share a common underlying assumption\nthat the embedded noise in HSI is independent and identically distributed\n(i.i.d.). In real scenarios, however, the noise existed in a natural HSI is\nalways with much more complicated non-i.i.d. statistical structures and the\nunder-estimation to this noise complexity often tends to evidently degenerate\nthe robustness of current methods. To alleviate this issue, this paper attempts\nthe first effort to model the HSI noise using a non-i.i.d. mixture of Gaussians\n(NMoG) noise assumption, which is finely in accordance with the noise\ncharacteristics possessed by a natural HSI and thus is capable of adapting\nvarious noise shapes encountered in real applications. Then we integrate such\nnoise modeling strategy into the low-rank matrix factorization (LRMF) model and\npropose a NMoG-LRMF model in the Bayesian framework. A variational Bayes\nalgorithm is designed to infer the posterior of the proposed model. All\ninvolved parameters can be recursively updated in closed-form.

In this\npaper, we instead explore finding sensitive accounts by examining the\npercentage of anonymous and identifiable followers the accounts have. This\napproach is motivated by an earlier study showing that sensitive accounts\ntypically have a large percentage of anonymous followers and a small percentage\nof identifiable followers.\n  To this end, we first considered the problem of automatically determining if\na Twitter account is anonymous or identifiable. We find that simple techniques,\nsuch as checking for name-list membership, perform poorly. We designed a\nmachine learning classifier that classifies accounts as anonymous or\nidentifiable. We then classified an account as sensitive based on the\npercentages of anonymous and identifiable followers the account has. We applied\nour approach to approximately 100,000 accounts with 404 million active\nfollowers. The approach uncovered accounts that were sensitive for a diverse\nnumber of reasons. These accounts span across varied themes, including those\nthat are not commonly proposed as sensitive or those that relate to socially\nstigmatized topics. To validate our approach, we applied Latent Dirichlet\nAllocation (LDA) topic analysis to the tweets in the detected sensitive and\nnon-sensitive accounts.

Different from competing techniques from the literature, our approach\ndoes not simply return a bounding box around the detected ear, but provides\ndetailed, pixel-wise information about the location of the ears in the image.\nOur experiments on a dataset gathered from the web (a.k.a. in the wild) show\nthat the proposed technique ensures good detection results in the presence of\nvarious covariate factors and significantly outperforms the existing\nstate-of-the-art.\n","Comment: 12 pages"]}]

In the\nwell-studied cooperative, or temperature 2, abstract tile assembly model it is\nknown that there is a tile set to simulate any Turing machine and an\nintrinsically universal tile set that simulates the shapes and dynamics of any\ninstance of the model, up to spatial rescaling. It has been an open question as\nto whether the seemingly simpler noncooperative, or temperature 1, model is\ncapable of such behaviour. Here we show that this is not the case, by showing\nthat there is no tile set in the noncooperative model that is intrinsically\nuniversal, nor one capable of time-bounded Turing machine simulation within a\nbounded region of the plane.\n  Although the noncooperative model intuitively seems to lack the complexity\nand power of the cooperative model it has been exceedingly hard to prove this.\nOne reason is that there have been few tools to analyse the structure of\ncomplicated paths in the plane. This paper provides a number of such tools. A\nsecond reason is that almost every obvious and small generalisation to the\nmodel (e.g. allowing error, 3D, non-square tiles, signals/wires on tiles, tiles\nthat repel each other, parallel synchronous growth) endows it with great\ncomputational, and sometimes simulation, power. Our main results show that all\nof these generalisations provably increase computational and/or simulation\npower. Our results hold for both deterministic and nondeterministic\nnoncooperative systems. Our first main result stands in stark contrast with the\nfact that for both the cooperative tile assembly model, and for 3D\nnoncooperative tile assembly, there are respective intrinsically universal\ntilesets. Our second main result gives a new technique (reduction to\nsimulation) for proving negative results about computation in tile assembly.\n"]}]

A set of 20 extremely red galaxies at 2.5<z<3.8 with photometric\nfeatures of old passive-evolving galaxies without dust, with stellar masses of\n~10^{11} M_sun, have colors that could be related to passive-evolving galaxies\nwith mean ages larger than 1 Gyr. This suggests they have been formed, on\naverage, when the Universe was very young (<1 Gyr).\n  AIMS. We provide new estimates for the stellar content of these 20 galaxies,\nwith a deeper analysis for two of them that includes spectroscopy.\n  METHODS. We obtained, with the GRANTECAN-10.4 m, ultraviolet rest-frame\nspectra of two galaxies and analyzed them together with photometric data. The\nremaining 18 galaxies are analyzed only with photometry. We fit the data with\nmodels of a single-burst stellar population (SSP), combinations of two SSPs, as\nwell as with extended star formation.\n  RESULTS. Fits based on one SSP do not provide consistent results for the blue\nand red wavelengths. Moreover, the absence in the spectra of a break at ~2,000\nangstroms indicates that a rather young component is necessary. Using two SSPs\nwe can match the photometric and spectroscopic data, with the bulk of the\nstellar population being very old (several Gyr) and the remaining contribution\n(<5% of stellar mass fraction) from a young, likely residual star formation\ncomponent with age <~0.1 Gyr. Exponentially decaying extended star formation\nmodels improve slightly the fits with respect to the single burst model, but\nthey are considerably worse than the two SSP based fits, further supporting the\nresidual star formation scenario.\n  CONCLUSIONS. The fact that one SSP cannot match these early-type galaxies\nhighlights the limitations for the use of age estimators based on single lines\nor breaks, such as the Balmer break used in cosmic chronometers, thus\nquestioning this approach for cosmological purposes.\n","Comment: 14 pages, accepted to be published in A&A"]}]
