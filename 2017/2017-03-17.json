(a) If the ring is $F$-injective,\nthen every ideal generated by a filter regular sequence, whose length is equal\nto the finiteness dimension of the ring, is Frobenius closed.

Since the structure of the whole social\nnetwork is yet largely unexplored, for deeper insight into human society there\nis need for more comprehensive datasets and modeling of the stylized facts. The\nexisting dynamical models generically require a considerable amount of\ncomputational efforts, while various static modeling approaches tend to be\ncomplicated for the whole social network showing the stylized facts. In this\npaper, in order to model the whole social network, we take an alternative\napproach by devising a community-based static model, for which a number of\ncommunities are randomly assigned to isolated nodes using a few reasonable\nassumptions such that the community size is heterogeneous, and larger\ncommunities are assigned with smaller link density and smaller characteristic\nlink weight. With these few assumptions, we are able to generate realistic\nsocial networks that show most stylized facts for a wide range of parameters,\nwhich in turn can explain why the stylized facts are so commonly observed. We\nalso obtain analytical results for various network quantities that turn out to\nbe comparable with the numerical results.

We found that when the\nvalue of the gait parameter was conspicuously greater (smaller) than the mean\nvalue, it was either followed immediately by a smaller (greater) value of the\ncontralateral leg (interleg control), or the deviation from the mean value\ndecreased during the next movement of ipsilateral leg (intraleg control). The\nselection of step duration and the selection of step length during such\ntransient control events were performed in unique ways. We quantified the\nsymmetry of short-term control of gait parameters and observed the significant\ndominance of the right leg in short-term control of all three parameters at\nhigher speeds (1.4 and 1.7 m/s).\n","Comment: 11 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Both explosion scenarios\nare based on the negative jet feedback mechanism (JFM). In the first, termed\nthe jittering jets scenario, a collapsing core of a single star progenitor can\nlaunch jets. The accretion disk or belt (a sub-Keplerian accretion flow\nconcentrated toward the equatorial plane) that launches the jets is\nintermittent with varying directions of the axis. Instabilities, such as the\nstanding accretion shock instability (SASI), lead to stochastic angular\nmomentum variations that allow the formation of the intermittent accretion\ndisk/belt, even when the pre-collapse core is slowly rotating. According to\nthis scenario no failed CCSNe exist. According to the second scenario, termed\nfixed axis scenario, single star progenitors cannot form an accretion disk or\nbelt around the newly born neutron star, and end their lives in failed CCSNe.\nIn the case of a successful CCSN the accretion disk axis has a more or less\nconstant direction. In this scenario the core of the progenitor star must be\nspun up during its late evolutionary phases, and hence all CCSNe are\ndescendants of strongly interacting binary systems, most likely through a\ncommon envelope evolution. For the first time these two scenarios are compared\nto each other, as well as to some aspects of neutrino-driven explosion\nmechanism. These new comparisons further suggest that the JFM plays a major\nrole in exploding massive stars.\n","Comment: An updated version"]}]

It is important to apply such models to different\ndomains because collecting many labeled samples in various domains is\nexpensive. In unsupervised domain adaptation, one needs to train a classifier\nthat works well on a target domain when provided with labeled source samples\nand unlabeled target samples. Although many methods aim to match the\ndistributions of source and target samples, simply matching the distribution\ncannot ensure accuracy on the target domain. To learn discriminative\nrepresentations for the target domain, we assume that artificially labeling\ntarget samples can result in a good representation.

We\nuse upscaling to propose an environmental-scale model which incorporates the\nmass exchange between surface and subsurface oil due to oil droplet dynamics,\nbuoyancy effects, and sea surface and subsurface mechanics. While the mass\nexchange mechanism detailed here is generally applicable to oil transport\nmodels, it addresses the modeling needs of a particular to an oil spill model\n[1]. This transport model is designed to capture oil spills at very large\nspatio-temporal scales. It accomplishes this goal by specializing to\nshallow-water environments, in which depth averaging is a perfectly good\napproximation for the flow, while at the same time retaining mass conservation\nof oil over the whole oceanic domain.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 6 figures"]}]

From its position on the sky, distance\n($\\sim$15 kpc heliocentric), and kinematic properties, A13 is likely to be an\nextension of another low Galactic latitude substructure -- the Galactic\nAnticenter Stellar Structure (also known as the Monoceros Ring) -- towards\nsmaller Galactic longitude and farther distance. Furthermore, the kinematics of\nA13 also connect it with another structure in the southern Galactic hemisphere\n-- the Triangulum-Andromeda overdensity. We discuss these three connected\nstructures within a previously proposed scenario that one or all of these\nfeatures originate from the disk of the Milky Way.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 8 figures.

Low mass stars are currently the best targets for searches for rocky\nplanets in the habitable zone of their host star.

We study evolution of spectral properties of the source from\nspectral analysis with the additive table model {\\it fits} file of the\nChakrabarti-Titarchuk two-components advective flow (TCAF) solution. From\nspectral fit, we extract physical flow parameters, such as, Keplerian disk\naccretion rate, sub-Keplerian halo rate, shock location and shock compression\nratio, etc. We also study the evolution of temporal properties, such as\nobservation of low frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), variation of\nX-ray intensity throughout the outburst. From the nature of the variation of\nQPOs, and accretion rate ratios (ARRs=ratio of halo to disk rates), we classify\nentire 2005 outburst into two harder (hard-intermediate and hard) spectral\nstates. No signature of softer (soft-intermediate and soft) spectral states are\nseen. This may be because of significant halo rate throughout the outburst.\nThis behavior is similar to a class of other short orbital period sources, such\nas, MAXI~J1836-194, MAXI~J1659-152 and XTE~J1118+480.

This result was\nproved by Kapovich-Nagnibeda in the case of free groups, and is also a\ngeneralization of Bonahon's result on geodesic currents on hyperbolic groups.\nWe will also generalize several other results of them. Especially, we extend\nthe (geometric) intersection number of two closed geodesics on $\\Sigma$ to the\nintersection number of two convex cores on $\\Sigma $ and, in addition, to a\ncontinuous $\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$-bilinear functional on $\\mathrm{SC}(\\Sigma)$.\n","Comment: 134 pages, 6 figures"]}]

Conventional\nbusiness process models only describe the lifecycles of individual instances\n(cases) in isolation. Although process models may include data elements (cf.\nBPMN), explicit connections to real data models (e.g., an entity relationship\nmodel or a UML class model) are rarely made. Therefore, we propose a novel\napproach that extends data models with a behavioral perspective. Data models\ncan easily deal with many-to-many and one-to-many relationships. This is\nexploited to create process models that can also model complex interactions\nbetween different types of instances. Classical multiple-instance problems are\ncircumvented by using the data model for event correlation. The declarative\nnature of the proposed language makes it possible to model behavioral\nconstraints over activities like cardinality constraints in data models. The\nresulting object-centric behavioral constraint (OCBC) model is able to describe\nprocesses involving interacting instances and complex data dependencies. In\nthis paper, we introduce the OCBC model and notation, providing a number of\nexamples that give a flavour of the approach. We then define a set-theoretic\nsemantics exploiting cardinality constraints within and across time points. We\nfinally formalize conformance checking in our setting, arguing that evaluating\nconformance against OCBC models requires diagnostics that go beyond what is\nprovided by contemporary conformance checking approaches.\n"]}]

Accurate estimates of this parameter are of the utmost\nimportance because it is directly linked to disk stability and star formation.\nA global measure of the gas velocity dispersion can be inferred from the width\nof the atomic hydrogen HI 21 cm line. We explore how several systematic effects\ninvolved in the production of HI cubes affect the estimate of HI velocity\ndispersion. We do so by comparing the HI velocity dispersion derived from\ndifferent types of data cubes provided by The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS).\nWe find that residual-scaled cubes best recover the HI velocity dispersion,\nindependent of the weighting scheme used and for a large range of\nsignal-to-noise ratio. For HI observations where the dirty beam is\nsubstantially different from a Gaussian, the velocity dispersion values are\noverestimated unless the cubes are cleaned close to (e.g., ~1.5 times) the\nnoise level.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in the Astronomical Journal, 14 pages, 12\n  Figures, 2 Tables"]}]

However, in 2D\nsystems, the long-range magnetic order is strongly hampered by thermal\nfluctuations which may be counteracted by magnetic anisotropy, according to the\nMermin-Wagner theorem. Prior efforts via defect and composition engineering,\nand proximity effect only locally or extrinsically introduce magnetic\nresponses. Here we report the first experimental discovery of intrinsic\nlong-range ferromagnetic order in pristine Cr2Ge2Te6 atomic layers by scanning\nmagneto-optic Kerr microscopy. In such a 2D vdW soft ferromagnet, for the first\ntime, an unprecedented control of transition temperature of ~ 35% - 57%\nenhancement is realized via surprisingly small fields (<= 0.3 Tesla in this\nwork), in stark contrast to the stiffness of the transition temperature to\nmagnetic fields in the three-dimensional regime. We found that the small\napplied field enables an effective anisotropy far surpassing the tiny\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy, opening up a sizable spin wave excitation gap.\nConfirmed by renormalized spin wave theory, we explain the phenomenon and\nconclude that the unusual field dependence of transition temperature\nconstitutes a hallmark of 2D soft ferromagnetic vdW crystals. Our discovery of\n2D soft ferromagnetic Cr2Ge2Te6 presents a close-to-ideal 2D Heisenberg\nferromagnet for studying fundamental spin behaviors, and opens the door for\nexploring new applications such as ultra-compact spintronics.\n","Comment: to appear in Nature"]}]
