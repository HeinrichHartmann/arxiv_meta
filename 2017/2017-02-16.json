We further show that in these cases automatic continuity holds, i.e.\nevery intertwiner between the Harish-Chandra modules extends to an intertwiner\nbetween the Casselman--Wallach completions, verifying a conjecture by\nKobayashi. Altogether, this establishes the compact picture of the recently\nstudied symmetry breaking operators for orthogonal groups by Kobayashi--Speh,\ngives new proofs of their main results and extends them to unitary groups.\n","Comment: 45 pages; v2: worked out all details for the case of rank one unitary\n  groups"]}]

Specifically, we say that a sketching algorithm is efficient if it\nachieves constant approximation using constant sketch size. A well-known result\nof Indyk (J. ACM, 2006) implies that a metric that admits a constant-distortion\nembedding into $\\ell_p$ for $p\\in(0,2]$ also admits an efficient sketching\nscheme. But is the converse true, i.e., is embedding into $\\ell_p$ the only way\nto achieve efficient sketching?\n  We address these questions for the important special case of normed spaces,\nby providing an almost complete characterization of sketching in terms of\nembeddings. In particular, we prove that a finite-dimensional normed space\nallows efficient sketches if and only if it embeds (linearly) into\n$\\ell_{1-\\varepsilon}$ with constant distortion. We further prove that for\nnorms that are closed under sum-product, efficient sketching is equivalent to\nembedding into $\\ell_1$ with constant distortion. Examples of such norms\ninclude the Earth Mover's Distance (specifically its norm variant, called\nKantorovich-Rubinstein norm), and the trace norm (a.k.a. Schatten $1$-norm or\nthe nuclear norm). Using known non-embeddability theorems for these norms by\nNaor and Schechtman (SICOMP, 2007) and by Pisier (Compositio.

Recent improvements of these\nenumeration algorithms rely on the use of bounds on path resources to discard\npartial solutions. The quality of the bounds determines the performance of the\nalgorithm. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a standard\nprocedure to generate bounds on paths resources in a general setting which\ncovers most resource constrained shortest path problems, among which stochastic\nversions.\n  In that purpose, we introduce a generalization of the resource constrained\nshortest path problem where the resources are taken in a monoid. The resource\nof a path is the monoid sum of the resources of its arcs. The problem consists\nin finding a path whose resource minimizes a non-decreasing cost function of\nthe path resource among the paths that respect a given constraint. Enumeration\nalgorithms are generalized to this framework. We use lattice theory to provide\npolynomial procedures to find good quality bounds.

In order to achieve this,\nthe magnetic structure of the CME as it leaves the Sun must be known. In this\narticle we address this issue by developing a method to determine the intrinsic\nflux rope type of a CME solely from solar disk observations. We use several\nwell known proxies for the magnetic helicity sign, the axis orientation, and\nthe axial magnetic field direction to predict the magnetic structure of the\ninterplanetary flux rope. We present two case studies: the 2 June 2011 and the\n14 June 2012 CMEs. Both of these events erupted from an active region and,\ndespite having clear in situ counterparts, their eruption characteristics were\nrelatively complex. The first event was associated with an active region\nfilament that erupted in two stages, while for the other event the eruption\noriginated from a relatively high coronal altitude and the source region did\nnot feature the presence of a filament. Our magnetic helicity sign proxies\ninclude the analysis of magnetic tongues, soft X-ray and/or EUV sigmoids,\ncoronal arcade skew, filament emission and absorption threads, and filament\nrotation. Since the inclination of the post-eruption arcades was not clear, we\nuse the tilt of the polarity inversion line to determine the flux rope axis\norientation, and coronal dimmings to determine the flux rope footpoints and,\ntherefore, the direction of the axial magnetic field. The comparison of the\nestimated intrinsic flux rope structure to in situ observations at the\nLagrangian point L1 indicated a good agreement with the predictions. Our\nresults highlight the flux rope type determination techniques that are\nparticularly useful for active region eruptions, where most geoeffective CMEs\noriginate.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in Solar Physics"]}]

Reconstructing the solution of the\noriginal diffusion model from novel self-similar solutions of the associated\nself-similar PDE, we infer that the $t^{-1/2}$ decay law of the diffusion\namplitude is {\\it not necessary}.

Hence, unless\nthe projection to such a mode is eliminated, generically this decay will be the\nslowest one observed. In initial-boundary value problems, an additional issue\nthat arises is whether the boundary data are \\textit{consonant} with the\ninitial data; namely, whether the boundary data agree at all times with the\nsolution of the Cauchy problem associated with the same initial data, when this\nsolution is evaluated at the boundary of the domain. In that case, the power\nlaw dictated by the solution of the Cauchy problem will be selected. On the\nother hand, in the non-consonant cases a decomposition of the problem into a\nself-similar and a non-self-similar one is seen to be beneficial in obtaining a\nsystematic understanding of the resulting solution.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 6 figures"]}]

We\nfind a good agreement between the two approaches, with similar slopes and\nvariability in the light curves, but identify several weaknesses in the\nballistic model: the density is underestimated in the shocked regions, and more\nimportantly, late shock reflections are not captured. With the accurate\ndynamics provided by our hydrodynamic simulations, we confirm that internal\nshocks in the ejecta lead to the formation of dense shells. The interaction of\na long-lived reverse shock with these dense shells then produces bright flares\nin the bolometric light curve, with arrival times, shapes, and duration in\nagreement with the observed properties of X-ray flares in GRB afterglows.\n","Comment: Submitted to MNRAS, comments welcome"]}]

Which mechanisms are responsible for the disc\ndissipation is still debated. Here we investigate the movement through an\nambient medium as a possible cause of disc dispersal. The ram pressure exerted\nby the flow can truncate the disc and the accretion of material with no\nazimuthal angular momentum leads to further disc contraction. We derive a\ntheoretical model from accretion disc theory that describes the evolution of\nthe disc radius, mass, and surface density profile as a function of the density\nand velocity of the ambient medium. We test our model by performing\nhydrodynamical simulations of a protoplanetary disc embedded in a flow with\ndifferent velocities and densities. We find that our model gives an adequate\ndescription of the evolution of the disc radius and accretion rate onto the\ndisc. The total disc mass in the simulations follows the theoretically expected\ntrend, except at the lowest density where our simulated discs lose mass owing\nto continuous stripping. This stripping may be a numerical rather than a\nphysical effect. Some quantitative differences exist between the model\npredictions and the simulations. These are at least partly caused by numerical\nviscous effects in the disc and depend on the resolution of the simulation. Our\nmodel can be used as a conservative estimate for the process of face-on\naccretion onto protoplanetary discs, as long as viscous processes in the disc\ncan be neglected. The model predicts that in dense gaseous environments, discs\ncan shrink substantially in size and can, in theory, sweep up an amount of gas\nof the order of their initial mass. This process could be relevant for planet\nformation in dense environments.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A, 20 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables"]}]

Although the theoretical basis of\nalternative models such as Fokker-Planck diffusion is not less convincing,\nmovement of populations is commonly modelled using the diffusion law due to\nFick. It is an interesting feature of Fokker-Planck diffusion that for\nspatially varying diffusion coefficients the stationary solution is not a\nhomogeneous distribution; in contrast to Fickian diffusion. Instead,\nconcentration accumulates in regions of low diffusivity and tends to lower\nlevels for areas of high diffusivity. Thus, we may interpret the stationary\ndistribution of the Fokker-Planck diffusion as a reflection of different levels\nof habitat quality. Moreover, the most common model for environmental\nfluctuations, linear multiplicative noise, is based on the assumption that\nindividuals respond independently to stochastic environmental fluctuations. For\nlarge population densities the assumption of independence is debatable and the\nmodel further implies that noise intensities can increase to arbitrarily high\nlevels. Therefore, instead of the commonly used linear multiplicative noise\nmodel, we implement environmental variability by an alternative nonlinear noise\nterm which never exceeds a certain maximum noise intensity. With Fokker-Planck\ndiffusion and the nonlinear noise model replacing the classical approaches we\ninvestigate a simple invasive system based on the Lotka-Volterra competition\nmodel.

Our second step consists of finding an\nappropriate change of the variables to linearize the found nonlinear Lax pair.\nThe desired change of the variables is again defined by a quadratic form. The\nmethod is illustrated by the well-known KdV equation and the modified Volterra\nchain. New Lax pairs are found. The formal asymptotic expansions for their\neigenfunctions are constructed around the singular values of the spectral\nparameter. By applying the method of the formal diagonalization to these Lax\npairs the infinite series of the local conservation laws are obtained for the\ncorresponding nonlinear models.\n","Comment: 16 pages"]}]

With the advent of high\nprecision astrometry, new horizons have been opened for detecting the\nkinematics associated with the warp and constraining possible warp formation\nscenarios for the Milky Way. The aim of this contribution is to establish\nwhether the first Gaia data release (DR1) shows significant evidence of the\nkinematic signature expected from a long-lived Galactic warp in the kinematics\nof distant OB stars. As the first paper in a series, we present our approach\nfor analyzing the proper motions and apply it to the sub-sample of Hipparcos\nstars. We select a sample of 989 distant spectroscopically-identified OB stars\nfrom the New Reduction of Hipparcos, of which 758 are also in Gaia DR1,\ncovering distances from 0.5 to 3 kpc from the Sun. We develop a model of the\nspatial distribution and kinematics of the OB stars from which we produce the\nprobability distribution functions of the proper motions, with and without the\nsystematic motions expected from a long-lived warp. A likelihood analysis is\nused to compare the expectations of the models with the observed proper motions\nfrom both Hipparcos and Gaia DR1. We find that the proper motions of the nearby\nOB stars are consistent with the signature of a warp, while those of the more\ndistant stars (parallax<1 mas) are not.

However, whereas most situations involve multiple particles\ninteracting with each other and the front, attention has focused almost\nexclusively on the interaction of a single, isolated object with the front.\nHere we address experimentally the interaction of multiple particles with a\nsolidification front by performing solidification experiments of a monodisperse\nparticle suspension in a Hele-Shaw cell, with precise control of growth\nconditions and real-time visualization. We evidence the growth of a particle\nlayer ahead of the front at a close-packing volume fraction and we document its\nsteady state value at various solidification velocities. We then extend single\nparticle models to the situation of multiple particles by taking into account\nthe additional force induced on an entering particle by viscous friction in the\ncompacted particle layer. By a force balance model, this provides an indirect\nmeasure of the repelling mean thermomolecular pressure over a particle entering\nthe front. The presence of multiple particles is found to increase it following\na reduction of the thickness of the thin liquid film that separates particles\nand front. We anticipate the findings reported here to provide a relevant basis\nto understand many complex solidification situations in geophysics,\nengineering, biology, or food engineering, where multiple objects interact with\nthe front and control the resulting solidification patterns.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 10 figures, submitted to Langmuir"]}]

Correlation between the\nmodes and the magnetic phase maps constructed from real-space imaging and\nscattering patterns allows us to conclude that the resonant modes arise from\nlocal topological features such as dipole skyrmions but does not depend on the\ncollective response of a close packed lattice of these chiral textures. Using\nmicromagnetic modeling, we are able to quantitatively reproduce our\nexperimental observations which describes localized spin-wave modes that are\ndependent on the helicity of the dipole skyrmion domain. We identify four\nlocalized spin wave excitations for the skyrmions that are excited under either\nin-plane or out-of-plane r.f. fields. Lastly we show that dipole skyrmions and\nnon-chiral bubble domains exhibit qualitatively different localized spin wave\nmodes.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 15 figures"]}]

We quantize the measurements using stable,\npossibly one-bit, Sigma-Delta schemes, and use a reconstruction method based on\nconvex optimization. We show that the part of the reconstruction error due to\nquantization decays polynomially in the number of measurements. This is in line\nwith analogous results on Sigma-Delta quantization associated with random\nGaussian or subgaussian matrices, and significantly better than results\nassociated with the widely assumed memoryless scalar quantization. Moreover, we\nprove that our approach is stable and robust; i.e., the reconstruction error\ndegrades gracefully in the presence of non-quantization noise and when the\nunderlying signal is not strictly sparse. The analysis relies on results\nconcerning subgaussian chaos processes as well as a variation of McDiarmid's\ninequality.\n","Comment: 15 pages"]}]

While generally appropriate, this\nprocedure can also fail, e.g., for covariant, quartic, scalar fields in\nfive-and-more spacetime dimensions (and possibly four spacetime dimensions as\nwell), which become trivial; such failures are normally blamed on the `problem'\nrather than on the `quantization procedure'.
