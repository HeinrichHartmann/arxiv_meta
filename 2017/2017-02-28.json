In\nthis case, the linearized system does qualitatively capture the dynamics in a\nsmall neighborhood of the hyperbolic steady state. However, one is often forced\nto consider non-hyperbolic steady states, for example in the context of\nbifurcation theory. A geometric technique to desingularize non-hyperbolic\npoints is the blow-up method. The classical case of the method is motivated by\ndesingularization techniques arising in algebraic geometry. The idea is to blow\nup the steady state to a sphere or a cylinder. In the blown-up space, one is\nthen often able to gain additional hyperbolicity at steady states. In this\npaper, we discuss an explicit example where we replace the sphere in the\nblow-up by hyperbolic space. It is shown that the calculations work in the\nhyperbolic space case as for the spherical case. This approach may be even\nslightly more convenient if one wants to work with directional charts. Hence,\nit is demonstrated that the sphere should be viewed as an auxiliary object in\nthe blow-up construction.

In this paper, a novel\nnon-destructive test (NDT) method based on flexural free vibration is\nintroduced to investigate the viscoelastic properties of fiber-reinforced\ncomposites. Three different types of industrial fibers (carbon, glass, and\nhemp) and an unsaturated polyester resin were selected to produce bar-shaped\ncomposites via pultrusion technique.

By analyzing the recorded sounds by means of fast\nFourier transform (FFT), viscoelastic properties such as flexural elastic\nmodulus and the loss parameter (Tan {\\delta}) were calculated for the\nfiber-reinforced composites.

We focus our study on observations of\nthe gamma-ray excess at energies exceeding 10 GeV, finding: (1) a statistically\nsignificant excess remains in the energy range 9.5-47.5 GeV, which is not\ndegenerate with known diffuse emission templates such as the Fermi Bubbles, (2)\nthe radial profile of the excess at high energies remains relatively consistent\nwith data near the spectral peak, (3) the data above ~5 GeV prefer a slightly\ngreater ellipticity with a major axis oriented perpendicular to the Galactic\nplane. Using the recently developed non-Poissonian template fit, we find mild\nevidence for a point-source origin for the high-energy excess, although given\nthe statistical and systematic uncertainties we show that a smooth origin of\nthe high-energy emission cannot be ruled out. We discuss the implication of\nthese findings for pulsar and dark matter models of the gamma-ray excess.\nFinally we provide a number of updated measurements of the gamma-ray excess,\nutilizing novel diffuse templates and the Pass 8 dataset.\n","Comment: 40 pages, 36 figures"]}]

The equivalent scalar\noptimization problem is identified as a secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem\nwith the quality of multicast service (QoMS) constraints. Further, we show that\nthis equivalent QoMS-constrained SRM problem, albeit nonconvex, can be\nefficiently handled based on a two-stage optimization approach, including\nsolving a sequence of semidefinite programs.

At the center of this literature lies the\nquestion of whether there exist fair mechanisms despite strategic behavior of\nthe agents. A fundamental objective function used for measuring fair outcomes\nis the Nash social welfare, defined as the geometric mean of the agent\nutilities. This objective function is maximized by widely known solution\nconcepts such as Nash bargaining and the competitive equilibrium with equal\nincomes.\n  In this work we focus on the question of (approximately) implementing the\nNash social welfare. The starting point of our analysis is the Fisher market, a\nfundamental model of an economy, whose benchmark is precisely the (weighted)\nNash social welfare. We begin by studying two extreme classes of valuations\nfunctions, namely perfect substitutes and perfect complements, and find that\nfor perfect substitutes, the Fisher market mechanism has a constant\napproximation: at most 2 and at least $e^{\\frac{1}{e}}$.

Not only does Trading Post achieve an\napproximation of 2 for perfect substitutes, but this bound holds for any\nconcave utilities and becomes arbitrarily close to optimal for perfect\ncomplements, where it reaches $(1+\\epsilon)$ for every $\\epsilon>0$.

Based on the Hamiltonian of electromagnetics and quantum\nmechanics, a unified Maxwell-Schrodinger system is derived by the variational\nprinciple. The coupled system is well-posed and symplectic, which ensures\nenergy conserving property during the time evolution. However, due to the\ndisparity of wavelengths of EM waves and that of electron waves, a numerical\nimplementation of the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method to the\nmultiscale coupled system is extremely challenging. To overcome this\ndifficulty, a reduced eigenmode expansion technique is first applied to\nrepresent the wave function of the particle. Then, a set of ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs) governing the time evolution of the\nslowly-varying expansion coefficients are derived to replace the original\nSchrodinger equation. Finally, Maxwell's equations represented by the vector\npotential with a Coulomb gauge, together with the ODEs, are solved\nself-consistently. For numerical examples, the interaction between EM fields\nand a particle is investigated for both the closed, open and inhomogeneous\nelectromagnetic systems. The proposed approach not only captures the Rabi\noscillation phenomenon in the closed cavity but also captures the effects of\nradiative decay and shift in the open free space. After comparing with the\nexisting theoretical approximate models, it is found that the approximate\nmodels break down in certain cases where a rigorous self-consistent approach is\nneeded.

We\npropose a single-particle framework to characterize these phases by the\neigenstates (the natural orbitals) and the eigenvalues (the occupation\nspectrum) of the one-particle density matrix (OPDM) in many-body eigenstates.\nAs a main result, we find that the natural orbitals are localized in the MBL\nphase, but delocalized in the ergodic phase. This qualitative change in these\nsingle-particle states is a many-body effect, since without interactions the\nsingle-particle energy eigenstates are all localized. The occupation spectrum\nin the ergodic phase is thermal in agreement with the eigenstate thermalization\nhypothesis, while in the MBL phase the occupations preserve a discontinuity at\nan emergent Fermi edge. This suggests that the MBL eigenstates are weakly\ndressed Slater determinants, with the eigenstates of the underlying Anderson\nproblem as reference states.

Many of these are universally recognized, while there are\ncontroversies regarding the definitions, membership and even the names of some\nsub-classes; we will try to review here the commonly-used nomenclature, noting\nthe main variants when possible. SN Types are defined according to\nobservational properties; mostly visible-light spectra near maximum light, as\nwell as according to their photometric properties. However, a long-term goal of\nSN classification is to associate observationally-defined classes with specific\nphysical explosive phenomena. We show here that this aspiration is now finally\ncoming to fruition, and we establish the SN classification scheme upon direct\nobservational evidence connecting SN groups with specific progenitor stars.\nObservationally, the broad class of Type II SNe contains objects showing strong\nspectroscopic signatures of hydrogen, while objects lacking such signatures are\nof Type I, which is further divided to numerous subclasses. Recently a class of\nsuper-luminous SNe (SLSNe, typically 10 times more luminous than standard\nevents) has been identified, and it is discussed. We end this chapter by\nbriefly describing a proposed alternative classification scheme that is\ninspired by the stellar classification system. This system presents our\nemerging physical understanding of SN explosions, while clearly separating\nrobust observational properties from physical inferences that can be debated.\nThis new system is quantitative, and naturally deals with events distributed\nalong a continuum, rather than being strictly divided into discrete classes.\nThus, it may be more suitable to the coming era where SN numbers will quickly\nexpand from a few thousands to millions of events.\n","Comment: Extended final draft of a chapter in the \"SN Handbook\".

The\nStandard Model Higgs field emerges as a result of the mixing of a scalar meson\nin the new strong dynamics and a massless elementary scalar field. The mass and\nscalar decay constant of that scalar meson, which are generated dynamically in\nthe new gauge theory, give rise to the Higgs field mass term, automatically\npossessing the correct negative sign by the bosonic seesaw mechanism. Using\nanalogy with QCD, we evaluate the dynamical scale of the new gauge theory and\nfurther make quantitative predictions for light pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons\nassociated with axial symmetry breaking along chiral symmetry breaking in the\nnew gauge theory. A prominent consequence of the scenario is that there should\nbe a Standard Model gauge singlet pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson with mass below\n220GeV, which couples to two electroweak gauge bosons through the\nWess-Zumino-Witten term, whose strength is thus determined by the dynamical\nscale of the new gauge theory.

In unifilar channels the channel state evolves in a deterministic\nfashion based on the previous state, input, and output, and is known to the\ntransmitter but is unknown to the receiver.

We\nconsider the leading spin 2 couplings to scalars, fermions, and vectors, and\nsystematically study signal propagation in all these other families of\ntheories. We find that most interactions directly lead to superluminal\npropagation of either a spin 2 particle or a matter particle, and interactions\nthat are subluminal generate other interactions that are superluminal. Hence,\nsuch theories of interacting multiple spin 2 species have superluminality, and\nby extension, acausality. This is radically different to the special case of\ngeneral relativity with a single species of minimally coupled spin 2, which\nleads to subluminal propagation from sources satisfying the null energy\ncondition. This pathology persists even if the spin 2 field is massive. We\ncompare these findings to the analogous case of spin 1 theories, where higher\nderivative interactions can be causal. This makes the spin 2 case very special,\nand suggests that multiple species of spin 2 is forbidden, leading us to\ngeneral relativity as essentially the unique internally consistent effective\ntheory of spin 2.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 4 figures, 1 table"]}]

Our analysis shows\nthat the proposed entropy based features out-perform previous state-of-the-art\nmethods using video data. For accelerometer data, our method performs better\nfor suturing only. We also show that fusion of video and acceleration features\ncan improve overall performance with the proposed entropy features achieving\nhighest accuracy. Conclusions: Automated surgical skills assessment can be\nachieved with high accuracy using the proposed entropy features.

To this end, we solve the braneworld generalization of the\nstellar structure equations for a static fluid distribution with spherical\nsymmetry considering that the spacetime outside the star is described by a\nSchwarzschild metric. First, the stellar structure equations are integrated\nemploying the so called causal limit equation of state (EOS), which is\nconstructed using a well established EOS at densities below a fiducial density,\nand the causal EOS $P= \\rho$ above it. It is a standard procedure in general\nrelativistic stellar structure calculations to use such EOS for obtaining a\nlimit in the mass radius diagram, known as causal limit, above which no stellar\nconfigurations are possible if the EOS fulfills that the sound velocity is\nsmaller than the speed of light. We find that the equilibrium solutions in the\nbraneworld model can violate the general relativistic causal limit and, for\nsufficiently large mass they approach asymptotically to the Schwarzschild limit\n$M = 2 R$. Then, we investigate the properties of hadronic and strange quark\nstars using two typical EOSs. For masses below $\\sim 1.5 - 2 M_{\\odot}$, the\nmass versus radius curves show the typical behavior found within the frame of\nGeneral Relativity. However, we also find a new branch of stellar\nconfigurations that can violate the general relativistic causal limit and that\nin principle may have an arbitrarily large mass. The stars belonging to this\nnew branch are supported against collapse by the nonlocal effects of the bulk\non the brane. We also show that these stars are always stable under small\nradial perturbations.

HSU aims at estimating the pure spectra present in the\nscene of interest, referred to as endmembers, and their fractions in each\npixel, referred to as abundances. Today, many HSU algorithms have been\nproposed, based either on a geometrical or statistical model. While most\nmethods assume that the number of endmembers present in the scene is known,\nthere is only little work about estimating this number from the observed data.\nIn this work, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric framework that jointly\nestimates the number of endmembers, the endmembers itself, and their\nabundances, by making use of the Indian Buffet Process as a prior for the\nendmembers. Simulation results and experiments on real data demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithm, yielding results comparable with\nstate-of-the-art methods while being able to reliably infer the number of\nendmembers. In scenarios with strong noise, where other algorithms provide only\npoor results, the proposed approach tends to overestimate the number of\nendmembers slightly.

The field of Complex\nEvent Processing (CEP) relates to the techniques and tools developed to\nefficiently process these queries. However, most CEP systems developed so far\nhave concentrated on relatively narrow types of queries, which consist of\nsliding windows, aggregation functions, and simple sequential patterns computed\nover events that have a fixed tuple structure. Many of them boast throughput,\nbut in counterpart, they are difficult to setup and cumbersome to extend with\nuser-defined elements.\n  This paper describes a variety of use cases taken from real-world scenarios\nthat present features seldom considered in classical CEP problems. It also\nprovides a broad review of current solutions, that includes tools and\ntechniques going beyond typical surveys on CEP. From a critical analysis of\nthese solutions, design principles for a new type of event stream processing\nsystem are exposed. The paper proposes a simple, generic and extensible\nframework for the processing of event streams of diverse types; it describes in\ndetail a stream processing engine, called BeepBeep, that implements these\nprinciples. BeepBeep's modular architecture, which borrows concepts from many\nother systems, is complemented with an extensible query language, called eSQL.\nThe end result is an open, versatile, and reasonably efficient query engine\nthat can be used in situations that go beyond the capabilities of existing\nsystems.\n","Comment: 40 pages"]}]

The power consumption is assumed to be convex\nin transmission rates. Hence, if the scheduler transmits faster, the delay will\nbe reduced but with higher power consumption. To obtain the optimal delay-power\ntradeoff and the corresponding optimal policy, we model the problem as a\nConstrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where we minimize the average delay\ngiven an average power constraint. By steady-state analysis and Lagrangian\nrelaxation, we can show that the optimal tradeoff curve is decreasing, convex,\nand piecewise linear, and the optimal policy is threshold-based.

The\noutput of our retinal stage model is presented for several types of Tilt\nillusion, in which the final tilt percept arises from multiple scale processing\nof Differences of Gaussian and the perceptual interaction of foreground and\nbackground elements. Our results suggest that this multilevel filtering\nexplanation, which is a simplified simulation for Retinal Ganglion Cell's\nresponses to these patterns is indeed the underlying mechanism connecting\nlow-level filtering to mid- and high-level explanations such as 'anchoring\ntheory' and 'perceptual grouping'.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 7 figures, submitted manuscript to Brain Informatics\n  journal"]}]

Thus, the problem is not APX-hard, unless $NP\n\\subseteq DTIME(n^{O(\\log n)})$. By applying a generic reduction, we obtain as\na corollary that the studied problem admits a polynomial-time $O(\\sqrt{\\log\nn})$-approximation. This improves previous $\\hat O(\\log n)$-approximation\napproaches, where the $\\hat O$-notation disregards $O(\\mathrm{poly}\\log\\log\nn)$-factors.\n"]}]

We have seen that the Web can\ninfluence the realization of human rights and even the pursuit of happiness.\nThe Web provides an infrastructure to help us to learn, to work, to communicate\nwith loved ones, and to provide entertainment. However, it also creates an\nenvironment affected by the digital divide between those who have and those who\ndo not have access. Additionally, the Web provides challenges we must\nunderstand if we are to find a viable balance between data ownership and\nprivacy protection, between over-whelming surveillance and the prevention of\nterrorism. For the Web to succeed, we need to understand its societal\nchallenges including increased crime, the impact of social platforms and\nsocio-economic discrimination, and we must work towards fairness, social\ninclusion, and open governance.\n  Ten Yars ago, the field of Web Science was created to explore the science\nunderlying the Web from a socio-technical perspective including its\nmathematical properties, engineering principles, and social impacts. Ten years\nlater, we are learning much as the interdisciplinary endeavor to understand the\nWeb's global information space continues to grow.\n  In this article we want to elicit the major lessons we have learned through\nWeb Science and make some cautious predictions of what to expect next.\n","Comment: 4 pages"]}]

The interest is mainly\nfocused on the assessment of suspension behaviour and, thus, on the\nidentification of the so-called vehicle rigid body modes. But issues arise when\nthe operational identification of a vehicle system is performed, basically\nrelated to the nature of the loads induced by the roughness of rolling\nprofiles.

We define\nthe geoid as a level surface of a time-independent redshift potential. Such a\nredshift potential exists in any stationary spacetime. Therefore, our geoid is\nwell-defined for any rigid body that rotates with constant angular velocity\nabout a fixed axis and is not subject to external forces. Our definition is\noperational because the level surfaces of a redshift potential can be realized\nwith the help of standard clocks, which may be connected by optical fibers.\nTherefore, these surfaces are also called isochronometric surfaces.

Among models that are capable of reproducing the\nobserved characteristics of the gamma-ray emission, we find that pulsars\ninvariably produce a flux of high-energy positrons that is similar in spectrum\nand magnitude to the positron fraction measured by PAMELA and AMS-02.
