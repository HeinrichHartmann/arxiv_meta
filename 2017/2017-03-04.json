This\ncomes from exposing four papers to the automated computer filters used by the\nphysics preprint server arXiv. These filters are used to flag papers in need of\nfurther review by human assessors before being promulgated on the server;\npapers not flagged by the algorithm are generally posted on arXiv without\nfurther review. After the filtering, human moderators decide whether papers\nshould be posted based on a relatively low bar of whether they are of interest,\nrelevance and value to the research communities that populate arXiv.\n","Comment: 9 pages"]}]
