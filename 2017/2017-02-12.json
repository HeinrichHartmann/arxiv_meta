Blazars at extremely high\nredshifts provide a unique insight into the AGN phenomena in the early\nUniverse. We observed four radio sources at redshift $z>4$ with the European\nVLBI Network (EVN) at 1.7 and 5 GHz. These objects were previously classified\nas blazar candidates based on X-ray observations.

Its radio jet extended to $\\sim$10\nmilli-arcsec scale makes this source a promising target for follow-up VLBI\nobservations to reveal any apparent proper motion. Another target, J0839+5112\nshows a compact radio structure typical of quasars. There is evidence for flux\ndensity variability and its radio \"core\" has a flat spectrum. However, the EVN\ndata suggest that its emission is not Doppler-boosted. The remaining two blazar\ncandidates (J1420+1205 and J2220+0025) show radio properties totally unexpected\nfrom radio AGN with small-inclination jet. Their emission extends to arcsec\nscales and the Doppler factors of the central components are well below 1.\nTheir structures resemble that of double-lobed radio AGN with large inclination\nto the line of sight.
