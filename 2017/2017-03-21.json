This normal\nform consists of four parts, one part based on the Jordan canonical form, one\npart made of nilpotent matrices, and two other dual parts, which we call the\nobservation and control part. The goal of this paper is to show that large\nportions of that decomposition are still valid for pairs of morphisms of\nmodules or abelian groups, and more generally in any abelian category. % This\ngives a new perspective even in the vector space case, as we have to use\nradically new proof techniques to work on abelian categories. In the vector\nspace case, we recover the full Kronecker decomposition theorem. The main\ntechnique is that of reduction, which extends readily to the abelian category\ncase. Reductions naturally arise in two flavours, which are dual to each other.\nThere are a number of properties of those reductions which extend remarkably\nfrom the vector space case to abelian categories. First, both types of\nreduction commute. Second, at each step of the reduction, one can compute three\nsequences of invariant spaces (objects in the category), which generalize the\nKronecker decomposition into nilpotent, observation and control blocks. These\nsequences indicate whether the system is reduced in one direction or the other.\nIn the category of modules, there is also a relation between these sequences\nand the resolvent set of the pair of morphisms, which generalizes the regular\npencil theorem. We also indicate how this allows to define invariant subspaces\nin the vector space case, and study the notion of strangeness as an example.\n"]}]

We consider two scenarios: outer\nsystems of giant planets potentially unstable to planet--planet scattering, and\nwide binaries that may be capable of driving Kozai or other secular variations\nof outer planets' eccentricities. Dynamical excitation of planets in the outer\nsystem reduces the multiplicity of Kepler-detectable planets in the inner\nsystem in $\\sim20-25\\%$ of our systems.

The effects of the outer dynamics can generate systems similar to\nKepler-56 (two coplanar planets significantly misaligned with the host star)\nand Kepler-108 (two significantly non-coplanar planets in a binary).

In these scenarios,\nthe formation of eccentric warm Jupiters is a signature of a past history of\nviolent dynamics among massive planets beyond $\\sim1$ au.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 19 figures.

The method improves upon and includes\ntwo previous fixed-point iteration methods. At each iteration step, we measure\nthe inconsistency, namely the inverse residual, between the iterative inverse\nestimate and the input DVF. The residual is modulated by a feedback control\nmechanism before being incorporated into the next iterate. The feedback control\ndesign is based on analysis of error propagation in the iteration process.

Inspired by recent experimental\nobservations and building on ideas from previous mathematical models, we\npresent a new, thermodynamically consistent, statistical-mechanical model of\nthe clock. At its heart are two main ideas: i) ATP hydrolysis in the CI domain\nprovides the thermodynamic driving force for the clock, switching KaiC between\nan active conformational state in which its phosphorylation level tends to rise\nand an inactive one in which it tends to fall; ii) phosphorylation of the CII\ndomain provides the timer for the hydrolysis in the CI domain. The model also\nnaturally explains how KaiA, by acting as a nucleotide exchange factor, can\nstimulate phosphorylation of KaiC, and how the differential affinity of KaiA\nfor the different KaiC phosphoforms generates the characteristic temporal order\nof KaiC phosphorylation. As the phosphorylation level in the CII domain rises,\nthe release of ADP from CI slows down, making the inactive conformational state\nof KaiC more stable. In the inactive state, KaiC binds KaiB, which not only\nstabilizes this state further, but also leads to the sequestration of KaiA, and\nhence to KaiC dephosphorylation.

E-mode GOOI FET with source to drain spacing of\n0.9 um demonstrates a breakdown voltage of 185 V and an average electric field\n(E) of 2 MV/cm, showing the great promise of GOOI FET for future power devices.\n"]}]

External power management circuits such as rectifiers\ncomprise diodes that consume power and have undesirable forward bias. To\naddress the above issues, we devise a novel integrated piezoelectric energy\nharvesting device that is structured by stacking a layer of quantum dots (QDs)\nand a layer of piezoelectric material. We find that the QD can rectify\nelectrical charges generated from the piezoelectric material because of its\nadaptable conductance to the electrochemical potentials of both sides of the\nQDs layer, so that electrical current causing energy loss on the same surface\nof the piezoelectric material can be minimized. The QDs layer has the potential\nto replace external rectification circuits providing a much more compact and\nless power-consumption solution.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 7 figures"]}]

Here, we propose instead\nto constrain the quantum carriers through a bound on the mean value of a\nwell-chosen observable. This modified assumption is physically better motivated\nthan a dimension bound and closer to the description of actual experiments. In\nparticular, we consider quantum optical schemes where the source emits quantum\nstates described in an infinite-dimensional Fock space and model our assumption\nas an upper bound on the average photon number in the emitted states. We\ncharacterize the set of correlations that may be exhibited in the simplest\npossible scenario compatible with our new framework, based on two\nenergy-constrained state preparations and a two-outcome measurement.\nInterestingly, we uncover the existence of quantum correlations exceeding the\nset of classical correlations that can be produced by devices behaving in a\npurely pre-determined fashion (possibly including shared randomness). This\nfeature suggests immediate applications to certified randomness generation.\nAlong this line, we analyze the achievable correlations in several\nprepare-and-measure optical schemes with a mean photon number constraint and\ndemonstrate that they allow for the generation of certified randomness. Our\nsimplest optical scheme works by the on-off keying of an attenuated laser\nsource followed by photocounting.

To address these issues, we adopt a new low-frequency\nsampling manner with a hierarchical transportation mode identification\nalgorithm and propose an offline data labeling approach with its manual and\nautomatic implementations. Through a real-world large-scale experiment and\ncomparison with related works, our sampling manner and algorithm are proved to\nconsume much less energy while achieving a competitive accuracy around 85%. The\nnew offline data labeling approach is also validated to be efficient and\neffective in providing ground truth for model training and testing.\n","Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author to rewrite"]}]

We then examine the light\ncurves of the SNe Ia iPTF14atg and SN 2012cg, and find that the collision of\nthe ejecta with a DOM in the frame of the DD scenario can account for their\nearly excess emission. Thus, early excess light does not necessarily imply the\npresence of a stellar companion in the frame of the single-degenerate scenario.\nOur findings further increase the variety of phenomena that the DD scenario can\naccount for, and emphasize the need to consider all different SN Ia scenarios\nwhen interpreting observations.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures.

We present a photometric survey of PNe in the galaxy's\nextended halo to characterise its PN population, as well as the surrounding\nintragroup light (IGL) of the Subcluster B. PNe were identified based on their\nbright [OIII]5007 \\AA\\ emission and absence of a broad-band continuum.

The outer halo beyond 60 kpc has a 3.2 times higher\nalpha-parameter compared to the main galaxy halo, which is likely due to\ncontribution from the surrounding blue IGL. We use the Planetary Nebulae\nLuminosity Function (PNLF) as an indicator of distance and stellar population.\nIts slope, which correlates empirically with galaxy type, varies within the\ninner halo. In the eastern quadrant of M49, the PNLF slope is shallower,\nindicating an additional localised, bright PN population following an accretion\nevent, likely that of the dwarf irregular galaxy VCC1249. We also determined a\ndistance modulus of mu = 31.29+/-0.08 for M49, corresponding to a physical\ndistance of 18.1+/-0.6 Mpc, which agrees with a recent surface-brightness\nfluctuations distance.

The second shortcoming is\nthat when this measure is used in real-world networks, a huge number of\nvertices may have exactly the same closeness/eccentricity scores. The third\nshortcoming is that in many applications, the distance between two vertices not\nonly depends on the size of shortest paths, but also on the number of shortest\npaths between them. In this paper, we develop a new distance measure between\nvertices of a graph that yields discriminative distance-based centrality\nindices. This measure is proportional to the size of shortest paths and\ninversely proportional to the number of shortest paths. We present algorithms\nfor exact computation of the proposed discriminative indices. We then develop\nrandomized algorithms that precisely estimate average discriminative path\nlength and average discriminative eccentricity and show that they give\n$(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-approximations of these indices. Finally, we preform\nextensive experiments over several real-world networks from different domains\nand show that compared to the traditional indices, discriminative indices have\nusually much more discriminability. Our experiments reveal that real-world\nnetworks have usually a tiny average discriminative path length, bounded by a\nconstant (e.g., 2). We refer to this property as the tiny-world property.\n"]}]

We employ the MESA stellar evolution code in combination\nwith the oscillation code GYRE to identify the pulsation modes for two SPB\nstars which exhibit short period spacing series. From our analysis we identify\nfour objects that show SPB pulsations, five stars that show rotational\nmodulation of their light curves caused by spots, one star that is identified\nto be a binary, and one object in the field of the cluster that is found to be\na non-member Be star. In two SPB stars we detect a number of regularly spaced\npulsation modes that are compatible with being members of a g mode period\nseries. Despite NGC 2264's young age, our analysis illustrates that its B type\nmembers have already arrived on the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS).

A2142 is\nnot a major merger and the presence of a giant radio halo is somewhat\nsurprising. We performed deep radio observations with the GMRT at 608 MHz, 322\nMHz, and 234 MHz and with the VLA in the 1-2 GHz band. We obtained high-quality\nimages at all frequencies in a wide range of resolutions. The radio halo is\nwell detected at all frequencies and extends out to the most distant cold front\nin A2142. We studied the spectral index in two regions: the central part of the\nhalo and a second region in the direction of the most distant south-eastern\ncold front, selected to follow the bright part of the halo and X-ray emission.\nWe complemented our observations with a preliminary LOFAR image at 118 MHz and\nwith the re-analysis of archival VLA data at 1.4 GHz. The two components of the\nradio halo show different observational properties. The central brightest part\nhas higher surface brightess and a spectrum whose steepness is similar to those\nof the known radio halos, i.e. $\\alpha^{\\rm 1.78~GHz}_{\\rm 118~MHz}=1.33\\pm\n0.08$. The ridge, which fades into the larger scale emission, is broader in\nsize and has considerably lower surface brightess and a moderately steeper\nspectrum, i.e. $\\alpha^{\\rm 1.78~GHz}_{\\rm 118~MHz}\\sim 1.5$. We propose that\nthe brightest part of the radio halo is powered by the central sloshing in\nA2142, similar to what has been suggested for mini-halos, or by secondary\nelectrons generated by hadronic collisions in the ICM. On the other hand, the\nsteeper ridge may probe particle re-acceleration by turbulence generated either\nby stirring the gas and magnetic fields on a larger scale or by less energetic\nmechanisms, such as continuous infall of galaxy groups or an off-axis merger.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables - A&A, accepted"]}]

With the emergence of mobile computing such\narchitectures became increasingly important and several techniques emerged to\nsupport in their specification. These techniques usually allow for the\nspecification of concrete architecture instances. Sometimes, however, it is\ndesired to focus on the specification of constraints, rather than concrete\narchitectures. Especially specifications of architecture patterns usually focus\non a few, important constraints, leaving out the details of the concrete\narchitecture implementing the pattern. With this article we introduce an\napproach to specify such constraints for dynamic architectures. To this end, we\nintroduce the notion of configuration traces as an abstract model for dynamic\narchitectures. Then, we introduce the notion of configuration trace assertions\nas a formal language based on linear temporal logic to specify constraints for\nsuch architectures. In addition, we also introduce the notion of configuration\ndiagrams to specify interfaces and certain common activation and connection\nconstraints in one single, graphical notation. The approach is well-suited to\nspecify patterns for dynamic architectures and verify them by means of formal\nanalyses. This is demonstrated by applying the approach to specify and verify\nthe Blackboard pattern for dynamic architectures.\n"]}]

This includes usual, affine, and double affine Hecke algebras\nfor Weyl groups, Hecke algebras of complex reflection groups, as well as many\nnew examples.\n","Comment: 29 pages. latex; the latest version is a major revision submitted for\n  publication. Many details added, and there is a new Section 4 containing a\n  discussion of further work on the subject since 2004"]}]
