We show that in the\npresence of a gravitational horizon the Friedmann equation can be derived from\na Machian definition of kinetic energy, without invoking the shell theorem.\nWhereas in the Newtonian case total energy translates to curvature energy\ndensity, in the Machian case total energy takes on different identities,\ndepending on the evolution of the horizon; we show that in the de Sitter\nuniverse Machian total energy density is constant, i.e. appears as cosmological\nconstant.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 1 fig"]}]

From a relational expression of the kinetic energy between\ntwo particles, due to Schroedinger, one can derive a Machian energy equation of\nthe expanding Universe [1], which in fact is the Friedmann equation. It turns\nout that conservation of total Machian energy has some intriguing consequences.\nIt yields a set of only four admissible spacetimes (de Sitter k=-1,0,1, and\nMinkowski), This, however, in the assumed presence of matter (dust,\nradiation,..). Subject to conservation of energy, matter appears as curvature\nenergy, and total energy as vacuum energy. Of these models, the open de Sitter\nmodel ($\\rho\\propto1+a^{-2}$) is observationally closest to $\\Lambda$CDM.\n","Comment: 5 pages"]}]
