For an extended defect, in the thermodynamic limit the system\ngenerically displays inhomogeneous density profiles in the steady state - the\nfaster segment is either in a phase with spatially varying density having no\ndensity discontinuity, or a phase with a discontinuous density changes.\nNonequilibrium phase transitions between them are controlled by the\ninhomogeneity and LK. The slower segment displays only macroscopically uniform\nbulk density profiles in the steady states, reminiscent of the maximal current\nphase of TASEP but with a bulk density generally different from half. With a\npoint defect, there are low and high density spatially uniform phases as well,\nin addition to the inhomogeneous density profiles observed for an extended\ndefect. In all the cases, it is argued that the the mean particle density in\nthe steady state is controlled only by the ratio of the LK attachment and\ndetachment rates.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 14 figures"]}]

Current solutions to distributed transaction\ncan spend more than half of the whole transaction processing time in\ndistributed commit. An efficient atomic commit protocol is highly desirable.\nThis paper presents the HACommit protocol, a logless one-phase commit protocol\nfor highly-available systems. HACommit has transaction participants vote for a\ncommit before the client decides to commit or abort the transaction; in\ncomparison, the state-of-the-art practice for distributed commit is to have the\nclient decide before participants vote. The change enables the removal of both\nthe participant logging and the coordinator logging steps in the distributed\ncommit process; it also makes possible that, after the client initiates the\ntransaction commit, the transaction data is visible to other transactions\nwithin one communication roundtrip time (i.e., one phase). In the evaluation\nwith extensive experiments, HACommit outperforms recent atomic commit solutions\nfor highly-available datastores under different workloads. In the best case,\nHACommit can commit in one fifth of the time 2PC does.\n","Comment: 11 pages"]}]

Within a \"wide sheaths\" asymptotic regime, valid for\nlarge-amplitude near RF fields, the RF part of this simple RF+DC model becomes\nlinear: the sheath oscillating voltage VRF at open field line boundaries can be\nre-expressed as a linear combination of individual contributions by every\nemitting point in the input field map. SW evanescence makes individual\ncontributions all the larger as the wave emission point is located closer to\nthe sheath walls. The decay of |VRF| with the emission point/sheath poloidal\ndistance involves the transverse SW evanescence length and the radial\nprotrusion depth of lateral boundaries. The decay of |VRF| with the\nemitter/sheath parallel distance is quantified as a function of the parallel SW\nevanescence length and the parallel connection length of open magnetic field\nlines.

Neglecting fluid inertia, thermal convection and shape\ndeformation, asymptotic analysis is performed to obtain the velocity of a\nforce-free surfactant-laden droplet. The present study is focused on two\nlimiting situations of surfactant transport: (i) small surface Peclet number,\nand (ii) high surface Peclet number. Thermocapillary-induced Marangoni stress,\nstrength of which relative to viscous stress is represented by thermal\nMarangoni number, has strong influence on the distribution of surfactant on the\ndroplet surface. Temperature field not only affects the axial velocity of the\ndroplet but also has significant effect on the cross-stream velocity of the\ndroplet in spite of the fact that the temperature gradient is aligned with the\nPoiseuille flow direction. When the imposed temperature increases in the\ndirection of Poiseuille flow, the droplet migrates towards the flow centerline.\nThe magnitude of both axial and cross-stream velocity components increases with\nthe thermal Marangoni number. However, when the imposed temperature decreases\nin the direction of Poiseuille flow, the magnitude of both axial and\ncross-stream velocity components may increase or decrease with the thermal\nMarangoni number. Most interestingly, the droplet moves either towards the flow\ncenterline or away from it. Present study shows a critical value of the thermal\nMarangoni number beyond which the droplet moves away from the flow centerline\nwhich is in sharp contrast to the motion of a surfactant-laden droplet in\nisothermal flow for which droplet always moves towards the flow centerline.\n"]}]

In this work the numerical\ndesign of continuous double freeform surfaces from ray mapping methods for\ncollimated beam shaping with arbitrary irradiances is considered. These methods\nconsist of the calculation of a proper ray mapping between the source and the\ntarget irradiance and the subsequent construction of the freeform surfaces.

However, the large spatial extent of\nevanescent light waves generated during nanoscale light confinement are\nubiquitous in silicon photonic devices and are the stumbling roadblock to\nminiaturization. Here, we demonstrate the control of evanescent waves using\nall-dielectric metamaterials on a chip. We demonstrate that anisotropic\nmetamaterials open a new degree of freedom in total internal reflection (TIR)\nto reduce the decay length of evanescent waves. This counterintuitive approach\nuses optical devices which can have a cladding with a higher average index than\nthe core and marks a departure from interference based confinement as in\nphotonic crystal waveguides or slot waveguides which utilize nanoscale field\nenhancement. We experimentally show that all-dielectric anisotropic\nmetamaterials can help to reduce the cross-talk more than 30 times and bending\nloss more than 3 times in ultra-compact photonic circuits, two major attributes\nthat limit the integration density in photonic circuits. We verify our\nall-dielectric metamaterial platform fabricated on a scalable process paving\nthe way to impact future device designs for dense photonic integration.\n"]}]

We present here a comprehensive,\nmulti-wavelength dataset---from radio to X-rays---for the most gamma-ray\nluminous classical nova to-date, V1324 Sco. Using this dataset, we show that\nV1324 Sco is a canonical dusty Fe-II type nova, with a bulk ejecta velocity of\n$1150 \\pm 40~\\rm km~s^{-1}$ and an ejecta mass of $2.0 \\pm 0.4 \\times\n10^{-5}~M_{\\odot}$. However, despite it's seeming normalcy, there is also\nevidence for complex shock interactions, including the aforementioned\ngamma-rays and early time high-brightness temperature radio emission. To\nexplain how a nova can be simultaneously ordinary and have the highest\ngamma-ray luminosity to date we present a simplified model of the ejecta in\nwhich the strength of gamma-ray emission is set by properties the fast ejecta\ncomponent that collides with a slower component to produce shocks.

The contribution of this paper is to: (a)\nextend the use of cjBitSeq to the DTU context, a previously introduced Bayesian\nmodel which is originally designed for identifying changes in overall\nexpression levels and (b) propose a Bayesian version of DRIMSeq, a frequentist\nmodel for inferring DTU. cjBitSeq is a read based model and performs fully\nBayesian inference by MCMC sampling on the space of latent state of each\ntranscript per gene. BayesDRIMSeq is a count based model and estimates the\nBayes Factor of a DTU model against a null model using Laplace's approximation.\nThe proposed models are benchmarked against the existing ones using a recent\nindependent simulation study.
