However, much less\nis known today about the network dynamics: indeed, complex networks in reality\nare not static, but rather dynamically evolve over time.\n  Our paper is motivated by the empirical observation that network evolution\npatterns seem far from random, but exhibit structure. Moreover, the specific\npatterns appear to depend on the network type, contradicting the existence of a\n\"one fits it all\" model. However, we still lack observables to quantify these\nintuitions, as well as metrics to compare graph evolutions. Such observables\nand metrics are needed for extrapolating or predicting evolutions, as well as\nfor interpolating graph evolutions.\n  To explore the many faces of graph dynamics and to quantify temporal changes,\nthis paper suggests to build upon the concept of centrality, a measure of node\nimportance in a network. In particular, we introduce the notion of centrality\ndistance, a natural similarity measure for two graphs which depends on a given\ncentrality, characterizing the graph type. Intuitively, centrality distances\nreflect the extent to which (non-anonymous) node roles are different or, in\ncase of dynamic graphs, have changed over time, between two graphs.\n  We evaluate the centrality distance approach for five evolutionary models and\nseven real-world social and physical networks. Our results empirically show the\nusefulness of centrality distances for characterizing graph dynamics compared\nto a null-model of random evolution, and highlight the differences between the\nconsidered scenarios.

In Newtonian gravity the pressure within a star merely\nplays the role of opposing self-gravity. In general relativity all sources of\nenergy and momentum contribute to the gravity. As a result the pressure not\nonly opposes gravity but also enhances it. The later role of pressure becomes\nmore pronounced with increasing compactness, $M/R$ where $M$ and $R$ are the\nmass and radius of the star, and sets a critical mass beyond which collapse is\ninevitable. This critical mass has no Newtonian analogue; it is conceptually\ndifferent than the Stoner-Landau-Chandrasekhar limit in Newtonian gravity which\nis attained asymptotically for ultra-relativistic fermions. For white dwarfs\nthe general relativistic critical mass is very close to the\nStoner-Landau-Chandrasekhar limit. For neutron stars the maximum mass---so\ncalled Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit---is significantly smaller than the\nStoner-Landau-Chandrasekhar limit. This follows from the fact that the general\nrelativistic correction to hydrostatic equilibrium within a neutron star is\nsignificant throughout the star, including the central part where the mass\ncontained within radial coordinate, $m(r)$, and the Newtonian gravitational\nacceleration, $Gm(r)/r^2$, are small.\n","Comment: Accepted in Turkish Journal of Physics for the special issue on GR\n  and Related Topics commemorating the 100th anniversary of GR. 13 pages, 1\n  figure, 145 references.

Consequently, if it is possible to\nderive QM from more basic principles, these principles should be of general,\nphilosophical nature. Here, we derive the formalism of QM from well-motivated\nepistemic principles. A key assumption is that a physical theory that relies on\nentities or distinctions that are unknowable in principle gives rise to wrong\npredictions. First, an epistemic formalism is developed, using concepts like\nknowledge and potential knowledge, identifying a physical state $S$ with the\npotential knowledge of the physical world. It is demonstrated that QM emerges\nfrom this formalism. However, Hilbert spaces, wave functions and probabilities\nare defined in certain well-defined observational contexts only. This means\nthat the epistemic formalism is broader than QM. In the fundamental layer of\ndescription, the physical state $S$ is a subset of a state space\n$\\mathcal{S}=\\{Z\\}$, such that $S$ always contains many elements $Z$. These\nelements correspond to unattainable states of complete knowledge of the world.\nThe evolution of $S$ cannot be determined in terms of the individual evolution\nof the elements $Z$, unlike the evolution of an ensemble in classical phase\nspace.

HM materials are used as capping layers to generate\nthe structural asymmetry and enhance the interfacial effects. For instance, the\nPt/Co/Ta structure attracts a lot of attention as it may exhibit large\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. However, the dependence of magnetic\nproperties on different capping materials has not been systematically\ninvestigated. In this paper, we experimentally show the interfacial PMA and\ndamping constant for Pt/Co/HM tri-layered structures through time-resolved\nmagneto-optical Kerr effect measurements as well as magnetometry measurements,\nwhere the capping HM materials are W, Ta, and Pd. We found that the Co/HM\ninterface plays an important role on the magnetic properties. In particular,\nthe magnetic multilayers with a W capping layer features the lowest effective\ndamping value, which may be attributed to the different spin-orbit coupling and\ninterfacial hybridization between Co and HM materials. Our findings allow a\ndeep understanding of the Pt/Co/HM tri-layered structures. Such structures\ncould lead to a better era of data storage and processing devices.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables"]}]

The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is\nachieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from\nnon-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to\na variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate\nthe data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are\ntransient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so\nthat accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible.\nIn this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing\nwith machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the\nglitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we\nengage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of glitches\ninto pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that\nappear as the detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are\nused to categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of\nthe morphological classes. Leveraging the strengths of both classification\nmethods, we create a combined method with the aim of improving the efficiency\nand accuracy of each individual classifier. The resulting classification and\ncharacterization should help LIGO scientists to identify causes of glitches and\nsubsequently eliminate them from the data or the detector entirely, thereby\nimproving the rate and accuracy of gravitational-wave observations. We\ndemonstrate these methods using a small subset of data from LIGO's first\nobserving run.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 8 figures, 1 table"]}]

Although several\nstudies have examined the association between presidential elections and stock\nreturns, very little attention has been given to the impacts of elections and\nelection induced uncertainty on stock markets. This paper explores, at sectoral\nlevel, the uncertain information hypothesis (UIH) as a means of explaining the\nreaction of markets to the arrival of unanticipated information. This\nhypothesis postulates that political uncertainty is greater prior to the\nelections (relative to pre-election period) but is resolved once the outcome of\nthe elections is determined (relative to post-election period). To this end, we\nadopt an event-study methodology that examines abnormal return behavior around\nthe election date. We show that collapsing stock returns around the election\nresult is reversed by positive abnormal return on the next day, except some\ncases where we note negative responses following the vote count. Although\nTrump's win plunges US into uncertain future, positive reactions of abnormal\nreturn are found. Therefore, our results do not support the UIH hypothesis.\nBesides, the effect of political uncertainty is sector-specific.

In this\nwork we present Application Embedding, a novel approach to application\ndevelopment which allows all aspects of an application, including its\nbusiness-logic, to be programmed declaratively.\n  We develop this approach in a two-step process. First, we draw a mapping\nbetween web applications and Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs).

Application\nembedding offers a separation of code assets that encourages reuse of\nimperative code, while keeping all application-specific assets, including those\nspecifying its business- logic, declarative.\n  As validation, we implemented a simple, though nontrivial web application\nusing the proposed separation of assets. This implementation includes an\napplication-agnostic imperative host application named FishTank, intended to be\napplicable for a wide variety of web applications, and a declarative definition\nof the different aspects of the specific application, intended to be loaded on\nthat host.\n  Our method of separation of code assets facilitates a better separation of\nwork, in comparison to traditional methods. By this separation, host\napplication developers can focus mostly on the extra-functional aspects of a\nweb application, namely on improving performance, scalability, and\navailability, while developers of an embedded application can focus on the\nfunctional aspects of their application, without worrying about extra-\nfunctional concerns.

For\nbehavioral therapy of SNMDs, an idea, similar to providing electronic\ncigarettes to addictive smokers, is to substitute highly-addictive newsfeeds\nwith safer, less-addictive ones to those users. Nevertheless, this idea faces\ntwo major challenges: 1) how to measure the addictive degree of a newsfeed to\nan SNMD user, and 2) how to exploit the theories in Psychology to determine\nappropriate substitution of newsfeeds for the therapy. To address these issues,\nin this paper, we propose a learning framework, namely, SNMD-Aware Personalized\nnEwsfeed Ranking (SAPER), that exploits features extracted from social network\ndata to measure the addictive degree of a newsfeed. With the quantified\naddictive degrees of newsfeeds, we formulate a new optimization problem,\nnamely, Multi-Efficacy Maximization with Interest Constraint (MEMIC), to\nmaximize the efficacy of the behavioral therapy, without sacrificing the\ninterests of users. Accordingly, we propose a randomized algorithm called\nComputing Budget Optimization for MEMIC with Newsfeed Differentiation\n(CBOM-ND). To validate our idea, we conduct a user study on 517 online social\nnetwork users to evaluate the proposed SAPER framework. Moreover, we conduct\nexperiments on large-scale datasets to evaluate the proposed CBOM-ND. The\nresults show that our approach is promising for alleviating the symptoms of\nonline social network users with potential SNMDs.\n","Comment: 12 pages"]}]

By analysing each cluster in 768\nprojections, we determine the optimistic noise floor in the measurements of the\ngalaxy-DM offsets. We find that the choice of the galaxy summary statistics\naffects the inferred offset values substantially, with the BCG and the\nluminosity peak giving the tightest 68-th percentile offset levels, $\\lesssim$\n4 kpc and $\\lesssim$ 32 kpc, respectively.

(For\nexample, a statistical query (SQ) gives an estimate of $Ex_{x \\sim D}[q(x)]$\nfor any choice of the query function $q$ mapping $X$ to the reals, where $D$ is\nan unknown data distribution over $X$.) Yet some data analysis algorithms rely\non properties of functions that depend on multiple samples. Such algorithms\nwould be naturally implemented using $k$-wise queries each of which is\nspecified by a function $q$ mapping $X^k$ to the reals. Hence it is natural to\nask whether algorithms using $k$-wise queries can solve learning problems more\nefficiently and by how much.\n  Blum, Kalai and Wasserman (2003) showed that for any weak PAC learning\nproblem over a fixed distribution, the complexity of learning with $k$-wise SQs\nis smaller than the (unary) SQ complexity by a factor of at most $2^k$. We show\nthat for more general problems over distributions the picture is substantially\nricher. For every $k$, the complexity of distribution-independent PAC learning\nwith $k$-wise queries can be exponentially larger than learning with\n$(k+1)$-wise queries. We then give two approaches for simulating a $k$-wise\nquery using unary queries. The first approach exploits the structure of the\nproblem that needs to be solved. It generalizes and strengthens (exponentially)\nthe results of Blum et al..

These two modules are pre-trained independently\nand then stitched to initialize and optimize the eventual depth-induced\nsaliency detection model.

Understanding the\nfundamental relation between fitness and information is therefore crucial to\nclarify the limits and universal properties of adaptation.

Both $B$ and $C$ are obtained by means of best-fits to data for\nproton-proton and antiproton-proton scattering, including recent data obtained\nat the LHC, and also to data for other meson-baryon and baryon-baryon\nscattering processes. The results are compared to the theoretical predictions\nexisting in the literature. In particular, following the above-mentioned\nnonperturbative QCD approach, we also consider fits where the parameters $B$\nand $C$ are set to $B = \\kappa B_\\text{th}$ and $C = \\kappa C_\\text{th}$, where\n$B_\\text{th}$ and $C_\\text{th}$ are universal quantities related to the QCD\nstable spectrum, while $\\kappa$ (treated as an extra free parameter) is related\nto the asymptotic value of the ratio $\\sigma_\\text{el}/\\sigma_\\text{tot}$.\nDifferent possible scenarios are then considered and compared.\n","Comment: 33 pages, 7 tables, 7 figures"]}]

Often, analyses are based on the response rate. This is the proportion\nof patients who have an observed tumour shrinkage above a pre-defined level and\nno new tumour lesions. The augmented binary method has been proposed to improve\nthe precision of the estimator of the response rate. The method involves\nmodelling the tumour shrinkage to avoid dichotomising it.

The movement from everyday conceptions\nof the world around us to a disciplinary interpretation is fraught with\npitfalls and problems. Thus, what underpins the characteristics of the\ndisciplinary trajectory to competence becomes an important educational\nconsideration. In this article we report on a study involving what students and\nlecturers discern from the same disciplinary semiotic resource. We use this to\npropose an Anatomy of Disciplinary Discernment (ADD), a hierarchy of what is\nfocused on and how it is interpreted in an appropriate, disciplinary manner, as\nan overarching fundamental aspect of disciplinary learning. Students and\nlecturers in astronomy and physics were asked to describe what they could\ndiscern from a video simulation of travel through our Galaxy and beyond. 137\npeople from nine countries participated. The descriptions were analysed using a\nhermeneutic interpretive study approach. The analysis resulted in the\nformulation of five qualitatively different categories of discernment; the ADD,\nreflecting a view of participants' competence levels.

This facilitates the identification of a clear\nrelationship between educational level and the level of disciplinary\ndiscernment.

In particular, images are\nrepresented as signals on graphs, which permits to replace classical\nconvolution and pooling layers in deep networks with graph spectral convolution\nand dynamic graph pooling layers that together contribute to invariance to\nisometric transformations. Our experiments show high performance on rotated and\ntranslated images from the test set compared to classical architectures that\nare very sensitive to transformations in the data. The inherent invariance\nproperties of our framework provide key advantages, such as increased\nresiliency to data variability and sustained performance with limited training\nsets.\n"]}]

This protection can be further\nenhanced using differential privacy (DP) techniques to bound the privacy\nleakage from the aggregates themselves, by either perturbing the input of the\naggregation or its output. In this paper, we set to evaluate the impact of\nreleasing aggregate location time-series on the privacy of individuals\ncontributing to the aggregation. We introduce a framework allowing us to reason\nabout privacy against an adversary attempting to predict users' locations or\nrecover their mobility patterns.

We then use the framework to\nquantify the privacy loss stemming from aggregate location data, with and\nwithout DP protection, using two real-world mobility datasets. We find that\naggregates do leak information about punctual locations and profiles.\nFurthermore, the density of the observations, as well as timing, play important\nroles, e.g., regular patterns during peak hours are better protected than\nsporadic movements.

Major criticisms of neutral theory have\nfocused on interspecific differences, which are in conflict with ecological\nequivalence. However, individual-level neutrality in nature is also broken by\ndifferences between conspecific individuals at different life stages, which in\nmany communities may vastly exceed interspecific differences between\nindividuals at similar stages. These individual-level asymmetries have not been\nfully explored in species-neutral models, and it is not known whether\ndemographic stage structure affects macroecological patterns in neutral theory.\nHere we present a two-stage neutral model, where both fecundity and mortality\nare allowed to change as an individual moves from a stage to the other. We\nexplore qualitatively different scenarios, and compare numerically obtained\nspecies abundance distributions to the predictions of unstructured neutral\ntheory. We find that abundance distributions are robust to this kind of stage\nstructure, but only so long as subpopulations at different stages fluctuate in\nsynchrony. On the other hand, species abundance distributions can differ\nsignificantly from the unstructured case if adults have sufficiently low\nfecundity and mortality. In addition, we show that the cumulative number of\nbirths per species, which is distributed as a power law with a 3/2 exponent, is\ninvariant even when the SAD departs from unstructured model predictions.

A linearly-polarized tagged photon beam produced by coherent\nbremsstrahlung was incident on a cryogenic hydrogen target within the CEBAF\nLarge Acceptance Spectrometer. Results are presented for the $\\gamma p \\to \\eta\np$ reaction for incident photon energies from 1.070 to 1.876 GeV, and from\n1.516 to 1.836 GeV for the $\\gamma p \\to \\eta^\\prime p$ reaction. For $\\gamma p\n\\to \\eta p$, the data reported here considerably extend the range of\nmeasurements to higher energies, and are consistent with the few previously\npublished measurements for this observable near threshold. For $\\gamma p \\to\n\\eta^\\prime p$, the results obtained are consistent with the few previously\npublished measurements for this observable near threshold, but also greatly\nexpand the incident photon energy coverage for that reaction. Initial analysis\nof the data reported here with the Bonn-Gatchina model strengthens the evidence\nfor four nucleon resonances -- the $N(1895)1/2^-$, $N(1900)3/2^+$,\n$N(2100)1/2^+$ and $N(2120)3/2^-$ resonances -- which presently lack the\n\"four-star\" status in the current Particle Data Group compilation, providing\nexamples of how these new measurements help refine models of the\nphotoproduction process.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures"]}]
