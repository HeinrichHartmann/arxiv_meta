Asking that this be symplectic gives a\ncurvature inequality first considered by Reznikov. We study this inequality in\nthe case when the base has dimension four, with three main aims. Firstly, we\nuse this approach to construct symplectic six-manifolds with c_1=0 which are\nnever Kahler; e.g., we produce such manifolds with b_1=0=b_3 and also with\nc_2.omega <0, answering questions posed by Smith-Thomas-Yau. Examples come from\nRiemannian geometry, via the Levi-Civita connection on Lambda^+. The underlying\nsix-manifold is then the twistor space and often the symplectic structure tames\nthe Eells-Salamon twistor almost complex structure. Our second aim is to\nexploit this to deduce new results about minimal surfaces: if a certain\ncurvature inequality holds, it follows that the space of minimal surfaces (with\nfixed topological invariants) is compactifiable; the minimal surfaces must also\nsatisfy an adjunction inequality, unifying and generalising results of\nChen--Tian. One metric satisfying the curvature inequality is hyperbolic\nfour-space H^4. Our final aim is to show that the corresponding symplectic\nmanifold is symplectomorphic to the small resolution of the conifold xw-yz=0 in\nC^4. We explain how this fits into a hyperbolic description of the conifold\ntransition, with isometries of H^4 acting symplectomorphically on the\nresolution and isometries of H^3 acting biholomorphically on the smoothing.\n","Comment: v1. 52 pages, but not overly technical, so don't let the length put\n  you off!

For a diffraction grating under incidence by a\nplane wave at a fixed frequency, by rotating the incidence angle at a given\nangular velocity, the field propagated by a nonzero diffraction order will\nrotate at increasingly fast angular velocity as the incidence angle approaches\nthe angle where Wood anomaly occurs. Such a fast rotating diffracted field has\nthe potential to generate a substantial Doppler shift. Indeed, under the\nassumption of a grating with infinite extent, the expression for the\ninstantaneous frequency shift perceived by an observer, who is looking into the\nlight radiated by the diffraction order, is derived and it is in full agreement\nwith the prediction from an interpretation based on the Doppler shift generated\nby a rotation of light sources.

They are symmetric up to conjugation by a\ndiagonal matrix and in many cases satisfy a certain sparseness condition: there\nare at most two nonzero entries in each row and column. Conjecturally, this\nclassifies all such solutions in vector spaces carrying this representation. A\ngroup of Hopf algebra automorphisms of $U_q(\\mathfrak{g})$ acts on these\nreflection matrices, allowing us to show that each reflection matrix found is\nequivalent to one with at most two free parameters. Additional characteristics\nof the reflection matrices such as eigendecompositions and affinization\nrelations are also obtained. The eigendecompositions suggest that for all these\nmatrices there should be a natural interpretation in terms of representations\nof Hecke-type algebras.\n","Comment: 118 pages, 24 tables; v.3: generalizations of Satake diagrams and\n  quantum symmetric pair algebras included, simplifications and minor notation\n  changes throughout"]}]

Our algorithm\ncan identify features such as redundant mechanisms and fast timescale\nsubsystems, as well as the regimes in which such approximations are valid. We\nbase our algorithm on a novel quantification of regional parametric\nsensitivity: multiscale sloppiness. Traditionally, the link between parametric\nsensitivity and the conditioning of the parameter estimation problem is made\nlocally, through the Fisher Information Matrix. This is valid in the regime of\ninfinitesimal measurement uncertainty. We demonstrate the duality between\nmultiscale sloppiness and the geometry of confidence regions surrounding\nparameter estimates made where measurement uncertainty is non-negligible.\nFurther theoretical relationships are provided linking multiscale sloppiness to\nthe Likelihood-ratio test.

Given the\nextreme brightness of V404~Cyg during the 2015 outburst, we aim to constrain\nthe source spectral properties using an unprecedented time resolution in hard\nX-rays, and to monitor their evolution over the outburst.

In a\ncomparative experimental study, we find that ReCoN is often superior to many\nother state-of-the-art network generation methods. We argue that ReCoN is a\nscalable and effective tool for modeling a given network while preserving\nimportant properties at both micro- and macroscopic scales, and for scaling the\nexemplar data by orders of magnitude in size.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 13 figures, extended version, a preliminary version of the\n  paper was presented at the 5th International Workshop on Complex Networks and\n  their Applications"]}]

We identify a new void observable, $\\lambda_v$, which depends\non a combination of the void size and the average galaxy density contrast\nwithin the void, and show that it provides a good proxy indicator of the\npotential at the void location. A simple linear scaling of $\\Phi$ as a function\nof $\\lambda_v$ is found to hold, independent of the redshift and properties of\nthe galaxies used as tracers of voids. We provide an accurate fitting formula\nto describe the spherically averaged potential profile $\\Phi(r)$ about void\ncentre locations. We discuss the importance of these results for the\nunderstanding of the evolution history of voids, and for their use in precision\nmeasurements of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, gravitational lensing and\npeculiar velocity distortions in redshift space.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 9 figures.

Below a critical velocity $v_c$ that\nscales as $\\omega ^{1/2}$, and is temperature independent below 1 K, the flow\nis laminar (potential flow). Below 0.5 K the linear drag force is caused by\nballistic phonon scattering that vanishes as T$^4$ until background damping,\nmeasured in the empty cell, becomes dominant for T $<$ 0.1 K. Increasing the\nvelocity amplitude above $v_c$ leads to a transition from potential flow to\nturbulence, where the large turbulent drag force varies as $(v^2 - v_c^2)$.

We performed N-body simulations to\ndetermine the effects of the planet trajectories (ejection and secular effects)\nonto the disk morphology. The combination of the migration and mean-motion\nresonances with the binary star (often 1:6) can eject the planet.

No source for\naphid resistance is presently available in Brassica juncea . A wild crucifer,\nBrassica fruticulosa is known to be resistant to mustard aphid. An artificially\nsynthesized amphiploid, AD-4 (B. fruticulosa x B. rapa var. brown sarson) was\ndeveloped for use as a bridge species to transfer fruticulosa resistance to B.\njuncea. Using the selfed backcross we could select a large number of lines with\nresistance to mustard aphid. This paper reports cytogenetic stability of\nintrogression lines, molecular evidence for alien introgression and their\nreaction to mustard aphid infestation. Results: Majority of introgression lines\nhad expected euploid chromosome number(2n= 36), showed normal meiosis and high\npollen grain fertility. Well-distributed and transferable simple-sequence\nrepeats (SSR) markers for all the 18 B. juncea chromosomes helped to\ncharacterize introgression events.

We\nshowed that hybrid superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs)\nmade of 2-nm-thick W5Si3 films over 2-nm-thick NbN films exhibit advantageous\ncoexistence of timing (< 5-ns reset time and 52-ps timing jitter) and\nefficiency (> 96% quantum efficiency) performance. We propose that the\ngoverning mechanism of this hybridization is the presence of a dual\nsuperconducting behavior: native superconductivity of each of the films and\nsuperconductivity that is induced from the neighboring film via the proximity\neffect. In addition to improvement in SNSPDs performance, our results suggest\nthat such hybridization can expand the range of available superconducting\nproperties, impacting nano-superconducting technologies. Lastly, this\nhybridization may be used to tune the amorphous character of superconducting\nfilms and to illuminate the elusive onset of collective-electron behavior near\nthe superconducting-to-insulating transition.\n"]}]

Earlier studies\nexplained the formation of such a plume in terms of the effect of a uniform\naxial magnetic field that significantly increases the lengthscale of convection\nin a rotating plane layer. However, rapidly rotating dynamo simulations show\nthat the magnetic field within the tangent cylinder has severe lateral\ninhomogeneities that may influence the onset of an isolated plume. Increasing\nthe rotation rate in our dynamo simulations (by decreasing the Ekman number\n$E$) produces progressively thinner plumes that appear to seek out the location\nwhere the field is strongest. Motivated by this result, we examine the linear\nonset of convection in a rapidly rotating fluid layer subject to a laterally\nvarying axial magnetic field. A cartesian geometry is chosen where the finite\ndimensions $(x,z)$ mimic $(\\phi,z)$ in cylindrical coordinates. The lateral\ninhomogeneity of the field gives rise to a unique mode of instability where\nconvection is entirely confined to the peak-field region.

The latter is essentially accomplished via two toroidal structures\npresumably formed in the tachocline and placed symmetrically with respect to\nthe equatorial plane. The two tori are characterized by several prominent\nkey-properties as follows: First, in each \"Torus\" a surplus of negative charge\nis entrapped for approximately the 11-year sunspot cycle. Second, the net\nnegative charge of Torus, moving with the solar rotational speed, generates a\nhuge toroidal current which, in turn, builds up an intense poloidal magnetic\nfield. Third, each Torus is placed at a specific distance from the Radiative\nZone, so that the rotational speed (u) of the entrapped electrons equals the\nlocal propagation velocity for an electromagnetic disturbance (v). Thus, two\nTorus electrons satisfy the condition that the repulsive electrostatic force\nequals the attractive magnetic force caused from the two elementary currents.\nFourth, the surplus negative charge can steadily increase; electrons are\nsystematically attracted inwards. The electrons remain without any \"Debye\nshielding\" action in the Torus-core region, while they demonstrate a \"Debye\nanti-shielding effect\" closer to the Radiative Zone. Thus, each Torus electron\n\"moves\" with zero resistivity and the Torus core region behaves like a gigantic\n\"superconductor\" at the extremely high temperatures of tachocline. Fifth, the\ntori move equatorward drifting on a surface on which the condition u=v is\nsatisfied.

We study\nmechanisms of high-energy emissions (X-ray, GeV, and TeV $\\gamma$-rays) from\nthis binary system. The paper is composed of two parts. In the first part, we\nre-analyze the GeV emission from 1FGL J1018.6-5856 using 7 yrs of the\nobservational data of \\textit{Fermi}/LAT. The data analysis of phase-resolved\nspectrum suggests that the 0.1-10 GeV emissions may contain two different\ncomponents: (1) a simple power-law with exponential cutoff component in the LOW\nstate; (2) an additional component extended to $\\sim $10 GeV in the HIGH state.\nIn the second part, we develop a model to explain the multi-wavelength\nemissions of this binary. Assuming that 1FGL J1018.6-5856 includes a pulsar,\nthe GeV spectrum in the LOW state can be well explained by the two-layer outer\ngap model of pulsar magnetosphere. As the pulsar is orbiting around the star,\nthe pulsar is considered to be wrapped by two kinds of termination shock: a bow\nshock due to the interaction between pulsar wind and stellar wind, and a back\nshock due to the effect of orbital motion. We proposed that X-rays are mainly\nproduced by the synchrotron radiation at the apex of the bow shock, and TeV\n$\\gamma$-rays are mainly produced by the inverse-Compton scattering at the back\nshock. The sharp peak in X-ray and TeV light curves are produced by in the\nshock tail due to the Doppler boosting effect at inferior-conjunction while\nanother broad sinusoidal modulations are possibly produced by the apex of the\nbow shock and the back shock due to variations of shock conditions.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 10 figures"]}]

Here, we formally\nrelate scrambling complexities to the degree of randomness, by studying the\nbehaviors of generalized entanglement entropies -- in particular R\\'enyi\nentropies -- and their relationship to designs, ensembles of states or\nunitaries that match the completely random states or unitaries (drawn from the\nHaar measure) up to certain moments. The main result is that the\nR\\'enyi-$\\alpha$ entanglement entropies, averaged over $\\alpha$-designs, are\nalmost maximal. The result generalizes Page's theorem for the von Neumann\nentropies of small subsystems of random states. For designs of low orders, the\naverage R\\'enyi entanglement entropies can be non-maximal: we exhibit a\nprojective 2-design such that all higher order R\\'enyi entanglement entropies\nare bounded away from the maximum. However, we show that the R\\'enyi\nentanglement entropies of all orders are almost maximal for state or unitary\ndesigns of order logarithmic in the dimension of the system. That is, such\ndesigns are indistinguishable from Haar-random by the entanglement spectrum.\nOur results establish a formal correspondence between generalized entropies and\ndesigns of the same order.\n","Comment: 60 pages"]}]
