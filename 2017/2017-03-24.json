Asking that this be symplectic gives a\ncurvature inequality first considered by Reznikov. We study this inequality in\nthe case when the base has dimension four, with three main aims. Firstly, we\nuse this approach to construct symplectic six-manifolds with c_1=0 which are\nnever Kahler; e.g., we produce such manifolds with b_1=0=b_3 and also with\nc_2.omega <0, answering questions posed by Smith-Thomas-Yau. Examples come from\nRiemannian geometry, via the Levi-Civita connection on Lambda^+. The underlying\nsix-manifold is then the twistor space and often the symplectic structure tames\nthe Eells-Salamon twistor almost complex structure. Our second aim is to\nexploit this to deduce new results about minimal surfaces: if a certain\ncurvature inequality holds, it follows that the space of minimal surfaces (with\nfixed topological invariants) is compactifiable; the minimal surfaces must also\nsatisfy an adjunction inequality, unifying and generalising results of\nChen--Tian. One metric satisfying the curvature inequality is hyperbolic\nfour-space H^4. Our final aim is to show that the corresponding symplectic\nmanifold is symplectomorphic to the small resolution of the conifold xw-yz=0 in\nC^4. We explain how this fits into a hyperbolic description of the conifold\ntransition, with isometries of H^4 acting symplectomorphically on the\nresolution and isometries of H^3 acting biholomorphically on the smoothing.\n","Comment: v1. 52 pages, but not overly technical, so don't let the length put\n  you off!

For a diffraction grating under incidence by a\nplane wave at a fixed frequency, by rotating the incidence angle at a given\nangular velocity, the field propagated by a nonzero diffraction order will\nrotate at increasingly fast angular velocity as the incidence angle approaches\nthe angle where Wood anomaly occurs. Such a fast rotating diffracted field has\nthe potential to generate a substantial Doppler shift. Indeed, under the\nassumption of a grating with infinite extent, the expression for the\ninstantaneous frequency shift perceived by an observer, who is looking into the\nlight radiated by the diffraction order, is derived and it is in full agreement\nwith the prediction from an interpretation based on the Doppler shift generated\nby a rotation of light sources.

They are symmetric up to conjugation by a\ndiagonal matrix and in many cases satisfy a certain sparseness condition: there\nare at most two nonzero entries in each row and column. Conjecturally, this\nclassifies all such solutions in vector spaces carrying this representation. A\ngroup of Hopf algebra automorphisms of $U_q(\\mathfrak{g})$ acts on these\nreflection matrices, allowing us to show that each reflection matrix found is\nequivalent to one with at most two free parameters. Additional characteristics\nof the reflection matrices such as eigendecompositions and affinization\nrelations are also obtained. The eigendecompositions suggest that for all these\nmatrices there should be a natural interpretation in terms of representations\nof Hecke-type algebras.\n","Comment: 118 pages, 24 tables; v.3: generalizations of Satake diagrams and\n  quantum symmetric pair algebras included, simplifications and minor notation\n  changes throughout"]}]

Our algorithm\ncan identify features such as redundant mechanisms and fast timescale\nsubsystems, as well as the regimes in which such approximations are valid. We\nbase our algorithm on a novel quantification of regional parametric\nsensitivity: multiscale sloppiness. Traditionally, the link between parametric\nsensitivity and the conditioning of the parameter estimation problem is made\nlocally, through the Fisher Information Matrix. This is valid in the regime of\ninfinitesimal measurement uncertainty. We demonstrate the duality between\nmultiscale sloppiness and the geometry of confidence regions surrounding\nparameter estimates made where measurement uncertainty is non-negligible.\nFurther theoretical relationships are provided linking multiscale sloppiness to\nthe Likelihood-ratio test.

Given the\nextreme brightness of V404~Cyg during the 2015 outburst, we aim to constrain\nthe source spectral properties using an unprecedented time resolution in hard\nX-rays, and to monitor their evolution over the outburst.

In a\ncomparative experimental study, we find that ReCoN is often superior to many\nother state-of-the-art network generation methods. We argue that ReCoN is a\nscalable and effective tool for modeling a given network while preserving\nimportant properties at both micro- and macroscopic scales, and for scaling the\nexemplar data by orders of magnitude in size.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 13 figures, extended version, a preliminary version of the\n  paper was presented at the 5th International Workshop on Complex Networks and\n  their Applications"]}]

Below 0.5 K the linear drag force is caused by\nballistic phonon scattering that vanishes as T$^4$ until background damping,\nmeasured in the empty cell, becomes dominant for T $<$ 0.1 K.

We performed N-body simulations to\ndetermine the effects of the planet trajectories (ejection and secular effects)\nonto the disk morphology. The combination of the migration and mean-motion\nresonances with the binary star (often 1:6) can eject the planet.

In particular, the\nIPDS state, in which the metronomes on each layer are synchronized in phase but\nare of a constant phase delay to metronomes on the other layer, is observed for\nthe first time. In addition, a new technique based on audio signals is proposed\nfor pattern detection, which is more convenient and easier to apply than the\nexisting acquisition techniques. Furthermore, a theoretical model is developed\nto explain the experimental observations, and is employed to explore the\ndynamical properties of the patterns, including the basin distributions and the\npattern transitions. Our study sheds new lights on the collective behaviors of\ncoupled metronomes, and the developed setup can be used in the classroom for\ndemonstration purposes.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 6 figures"]}]

Well-distributed and transferable simple-sequence\nrepeats (SSR) markers for all the 18 B. juncea chromosomes helped to\ncharacterize introgression events. Average proportions of recipient and donor\ngenome in the substitution lines were 49.72 and 35.06%, respectively. Minimum\nalien parent genome presence (27.29%) was observed in the introgression line,\nAd3K-280 . Introgressed genotypes also varied for their resistance responses to\nmustard aphid infestations under artificial release conditions for two\ncontinuous seasons. Some of the test genotypes showed consistent resistant\nreaction. Conclusions: B.juncea-fruticulosa introgression set may prove to be a\nvery powerful breeding tool for aphid resistance related QTL/gene discovery and\nfine mapping of the desired genes/QTLs to facilitate marker assisted transfer\nof identified gene(s) for mustard aphid resistance in the background of\ncommercial mustard genotypes.\n","Comment: Phenotyped introgression lines for resistance to mustard aphid,\n  Lipaphis erysimi - a key pest of rapeseed mustard in India and other\n  countries"]}]

Earlier studies\nexplained the formation of such a plume in terms of the effect of a uniform\naxial magnetic field that significantly increases the lengthscale of convection\nin a rotating plane layer. However, rapidly rotating dynamo simulations show\nthat the magnetic field within the tangent cylinder has severe lateral\ninhomogeneities that may influence the onset of an isolated plume. Increasing\nthe rotation rate in our dynamo simulations (by decreasing the Ekman number\n$E$) produces progressively thinner plumes that appear to seek out the location\nwhere the field is strongest. Motivated by this result, we examine the linear\nonset of convection in a rapidly rotating fluid layer subject to a laterally\nvarying axial magnetic field. A cartesian geometry is chosen where the finite\ndimensions $(x,z)$ mimic $(\\phi,z)$ in cylindrical coordinates. The lateral\ninhomogeneity of the field gives rise to a unique mode of instability where\nconvection is entirely confined to the peak-field region. The localization of\nthe flow by the magnetic field occurs even when the field strength (measured by\nthe Elsasser number $\\varLambda$) is small and viscosity controls the smallest\nlengthscale of convection. The lowest Rayleigh number at which an isolated\nplume appears within the tangent cylinder in spherical shell dynamo simulations\nagrees closely with the viscous-mode Rayleigh number in the plane layer linear\nmagnetoconvection model.

The latter is essentially accomplished via two toroidal structures\npresumably formed in the tachocline and placed symmetrically with respect to\nthe equatorial plane. The two tori are characterized by several prominent\nkey-properties as follows: First, in each \"Torus\" a surplus of negative charge\nis entrapped for approximately the 11-year sunspot cycle. Second, the net\nnegative charge of Torus, moving with the solar rotational speed, generates a\nhuge toroidal current which, in turn, builds up an intense poloidal magnetic\nfield. Third, each Torus is placed at a specific distance from the Radiative\nZone, so that the rotational speed (u) of the entrapped electrons equals the\nlocal propagation velocity for an electromagnetic disturbance (v). Thus, two\nTorus electrons satisfy the condition that the repulsive electrostatic force\nequals the attractive magnetic force caused from the two elementary currents.\nFourth, the surplus negative charge can steadily increase; electrons are\nsystematically attracted inwards. The electrons remain without any \"Debye\nshielding\" action in the Torus-core region, while they demonstrate a \"Debye\nanti-shielding effect\" closer to the Radiative Zone. Thus, each Torus electron\n\"moves\" with zero resistivity and the Torus core region behaves like a gigantic\n\"superconductor\" at the extremely high temperatures of tachocline. Fifth, the\ntori move equatorward drifting on a surface on which the condition u=v is\nsatisfied.

Assuming that 1FGL J1018.6-5856 includes a pulsar,\nthe GeV spectrum in the LOW state can be well explained by the two-layer outer\ngap model of pulsar magnetosphere. As the pulsar is orbiting around the star,\nthe pulsar is considered to be wrapped by two kinds of termination shock: a bow\nshock due to the interaction between pulsar wind and stellar wind, and a back\nshock due to the effect of orbital motion. We proposed that X-rays are mainly\nproduced by the synchrotron radiation at the apex of the bow shock, and TeV\n$\\gamma$-rays are mainly produced by the inverse-Compton scattering at the back\nshock. The sharp peak in X-ray and TeV light curves are produced by in the\nshock tail due to the Doppler boosting effect at inferior-conjunction while\nanother broad sinusoidal modulations are possibly produced by the apex of the\nbow shock and the back shock due to variations of shock conditions.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 10 figures"]}]

The relations equate the dissipation rate for\neither passive or active scalars to the variance of scalar inputs from the\ninitial values, boundary values, and internal sources, as those are sampled\nbackward in time by stochastic Lagrangian trajectories. New probabilistic\nconcepts are required to represent scalar boundary conditions at the walls: the\nboundary local-time density at points on the wall where scalar fluxes are\nimposed and the boundary first hitting-time at points where scalar values are\nimposed. These concepts are illustrated both by analytical results for the\nproblem of pure heat conduction and by numerical results from a database of\nchannel-flow flow turbulence, which also demonstrate the scalar mixing\nproperties of near-wall turbulence. As an application of the\nfluctuation-dissipation relation, we examine for wall-bounded flows the\nrelation between anomalous scalar dissipation and Lagrangian spontaneous\nstochasticity, i.e. the persistent non-determinism of Lagrangian particle\ntrajectories in the limit of vanishing viscosity and diffusivity.
