The heat and momentum fluxes as well as the\ncooling rate are determined to first order in the deviations of the\nhydrodynamic field gradients from their values in the homogeneous steady state.\nSince the collisional cooling cannot be compensated locally for the heat\nproduced by the external driving force, the reference distribution $f^{(0)}$\n(zeroth-order approximation) depends on time through its dependence on\ntemperature. This fact gives rise to conceptual and practical difficulties not\npresent in the undriven case.

However, simulations that include\nRayleigh friction invariably produce a sub-rotating (retrograde) equatorial jet\nfor Jovian parameter regimes, whilst observations of Jupiter show a\nsuper-rotating (prograde) equatorial jet that has persisted over several\ndecades. Super-rotating equatorial jets have recently been obtained in shallow\nwater simulations that include a Newtonian relaxation of perturbations to the\nlayer thickness to model radiative cooling to space, and in simulations of the\nthermal shallow water equations that include a similar relaxation term in their\ntemperature equation. Simulations of global quasigeostrophic forms of these\ndifferent models produce equatorial jets in the same directions as the parent\nmodels, suggesting that the mechanism responsible for setting the direction\nlies within quasigeostrophic theory.

Following a simple feedback model, the\nresults confirm the presence of a positive eddy-jet feedback in the annular\nmode dynamics, with a feedback strength of 0.137 day$^{-1}$ in the idealized\nGCM. Statistical methods proposed by earlier studies to quantify the feedback\nstrength are evaluated against results from the LRF.

A recently emerging area where\nnucleation is highly relevant is the initiation of filamentous protein\nself-assembly, a process that has broad implications from medicine to\nnanotechnology. As such, spontaneous nucleation of protein fibrils has received\nmuch attention in recent years with many theoretical and experimental studies\nfocussing on the underlying physical principles. In this paper we make a step\nforward in this direction and explore the early time behaviour of filamentous\nprotein growth in the context of nucleation theory. We first provide an\noverview of the thermodynamics and kinetics of spontaneous nucleation of\nprotein filaments in the presence of one relevant degree of freedom, namely the\ncluster size. In this case, we review how key kinetic observables, such as the\nreaction order of spontaneous nucleation, are directly related to the physical\nsize of the critical nucleus. We then focus on the increasingly prominent case\nof filament nucleation that includes a conformational conversion of the\nnucleating building-block as an additional slow step in the nucleation process.\nUsing computer simulations, we study the concentration dependence of the\nnucleation rate. We find that, under these circumstances, the reaction order of\nspontaneous nucleation with respect to the free monomer does no longer relate\nto the overall physical size of the nucleating aggregate but rather to the\nportion of the aggregate that actively participates in the conformational\nconversion. Our results thus provide a novel interpretation of the common\nkinetic descriptors of protein filament formation, including the reaction order\nof the nucleation step or the scaling exponent of lag times, and put into\nperspective current theoretical descriptions of protein aggregation.\n"]}]

The\ncluster has two CO velocity components, a low velocity one spatially associated\nwith the cluster and a high velocity one distributed in a bubble-like shape\naround the cluster. Our results on the low velocity component suggest that this\ngas did not participate in the formation of the SSC. We propose that most of\nthe parent cloud has already been blown away, accelerated at the early stages\nof the SSC evolution by radiation pressure, in a timescale ~1 Myr. The high\nvelocity component may trace outflowing molecular gas from the parent cloud.\nSupporting evidence is found in shock heated H2 gas. The low velocity component\nmay be gas that was near the SSC when it formed but not part of its parent\ncloud or clumps that migrated from the SGMC environment. This gas would be\ndispersed by stellar winds and supernova explosions. Within ~100 pc from the\ncluster, we estimate SFE>17%, smaller than the theoretical limit of 30% needed\nto form a bound cluster. Further higher spatial resolution observations are\nneeded to test and quantify our proposed scenario.\n","Comment: 15 pages, accepted to A&A"]}]

In this paper, we investigate the problem of\nprivate machine learning, where as common in practice, the data is not given at\nonce, but rather arrives incrementally over time.\n  We introduce the problems of private incremental ERM and private incremental\nregression where the general goal is to always maintain a good empirical risk\nminimizer for the history observed under differential privacy. Our first\ncontribution is a generic transformation of private batch ERM mechanisms into\nprivate incremental ERM mechanisms, based on a simple idea of invoking the\nprivate batch ERM procedure at some regular time intervals. We take this\nconstruction as a baseline for comparison. We then provide two mechanisms for\nthe private incremental regression problem. Our first mechanism is based on\nprivately constructing a noisy incremental gradient function, which is then\nused in a modified projected gradient procedure at every timestep. This\nmechanism has an excess empirical risk of $\\approx\\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the\ndimensionality of the data. While from the results of [Bassily et al. 2014]\nthis bound is tight in the worst-case, we show that certain geometric\nproperties of the input and constraint set can be used to derive significantly\nbetter results for certain interesting regression problems.\n","Comment: To appear in PODS 2017"]}]

The empirical\ngoal of the data analysis is to investigate the effect of this attention on\ntrading behavior. For this purpose, we regress the (next day) returns and the\n(partially) observed ranks of frequencies. In the regression, the ranks are\ntransformed into scores, for which purpose the identity or linear scores are\ncommonly used. In this paper, we propose a new class of scores (a score\nfunction) that is based on the moments of order statistics of a pre-decided\nrandom variable. The new score function, denoted by D-rank, is shown to be\nasymptotically optimal to maximize the correlation between the response and\nscore, when the pre-decided random variable and true covariate are in the same\nlocation-scale family. In addition, the least-squares estimator using the\nD-rank consistently estimates the true correlation between the response and the\ncovariate, and asymptotically approaches the normal distribution. We\nadditionally propose a procedure for diagnosing a given score function\n(equivalently, the pre-decided random variable Z) and selecting one that is\nbetter suited to the data. We numerically demonstrate the advantage of using a\ncorrectly specified score function over that of the identity scores (or other\nmisspecified scores) in estimating the correlation coefficient.

Their dispersive arrival times suggest an\nextragalactic origin and imply radio luminosities orders of magnitude larger\nthan any other kind of known short-duration radio transient. Thus far, all FRBs\nhave been detected with large single-dish telescopes with arcminute\nlocalizations, and attempts to identify their counterparts (source or host\ngalaxy) have relied on contemporaneous variability of field sources or the\npresence of peculiar field stars or galaxies. These attempts have not resulted\nin an unambiguous association with a host or multi-wavelength counterpart. Here\nwe report the sub-arcsecond localization of FRB 121102, the only known\nrepeating burst source, using high-time-resolution radio interferometric\nobservations that directly image the bursts themselves. Our precise\nlocalization reveals that FRB 121102 originates within 100 mas of a faint 180\nuJy persistent radio source with a continuum spectrum that is consistent with\nnon-thermal emission, and a faint (25th magnitude) optical counterpart. The\nflux density of the persistent radio source varies by tens of percent on day\ntimescales, and very long baseline radio interferometry yields an angular size\nless than 1.7 mas. Our observations are inconsistent with the fast radio burst\nhaving a Galactic origin or its source being located within a prominent\nstar-forming galaxy. Instead, the source appears to be co-located with a\nlow-luminosity active galactic nucleus or a previously unknown type of\nextragalactic source. [Truncated] If other fast radio bursts have similarly\nfaint radio and optical counterparts, our findings imply that direct\nsub-arcsecond localizations of FRBs may be the only way to provide reliable\nassociations.\n","Comment: Nature, published online on 4 Jan 2017, DOI: 10.1038/nature20797"]}]

In this\nwork, we extend the investigation of the validity of the RWA to a more involved\nsetup where two qubit-mode subsystems are brought to interaction through their\nharmonic coordinates. Our treatment is all analytic thanks to a sequence of\ncarefully chosen unitary transformations which allows us to diagonlize the\nHamiltonian within and without the RWA. By also considering qubit dephasing, we\nfind that the purity of the two-qubit state presents non-Markovian features\nwhich become more pronounced as the coupling between the modes gets stronger\nand the RWA loses its validity. In the same regime, there occurs fast\ngeneration of entanglement between the qubits which is also not correctly\ndescribed under the RWA.
