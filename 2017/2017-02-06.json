Ostwald-de\nWaele power law viscous fluid has been considered to represent the rheological\nfluid to analyze pumping by means of a sequence of beat of cilia from row to\nrow of cilia in a given row of cells and from one row of cells to the next\n(metachronal wave movement) under conditions for which the corresponding\nReynolds number is small enough for inertial effects to be negligible and the\nwavelength to diameter ratio is large enough for the pressure to be considered\nuniform over the cross-section.

Subsequently, a micromechanical\npull-out model for a continuous fiber multi-scale composite is developed, and\nstress transfer behavior is studied for different orientations of CNS\nconsidering their perfect and imperfect interfacial bonding conditions with the\nsurrounding epoxy. Such interface condition was modeled using the linear spring\nlayer model with a continuous traction but a displacement jump. The current\npull-out model accounts for the radial as well as the axial deformations of\ndifferent orthotropic constituent phases of the multiscale composite.

Health economic evaluations of interventions against infectious\ndiseases are commonly based on the predictions of ordinary differential\nequation (ODE) systems or Markov models (MMs). Standard MMs are static, whereas\nODE systems are usually dynamic and account for herd immunity which is crucial\nto prevent overestimation of infection prevalence. Complex ODE systems\nincluding probabilistic model parameters are computationally intensive. Thus,\nmainly ODE-based models including deterministic parameters are presented in the\nliterature. These do not account for parameter uncertainty. As a consequence,\nprobabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA), a crucial component of health\neconomic evaluations, cannot be conducted straightforwardly.\n  Methods. We present a dynamic MM under a Bayesian framework. We extend a\nstatic MM by incorporating the force of infection into the state allocation\nalgorithm. The corresponding output is based on dynamic changes in prevalence\nand thus accounts for herd immunity. In contrast to deterministic ODE-based\nmodels, PSA can be conducted straightforwardly. We introduce a case study of a\nfictional sexually transmitted infection and compare our dynamic Bayesian MM to\na deterministic and a Bayesian ODE system. The models are calibrated to time\nseries data.\n  Results. By means of the case study, we show that our methodology produces\noutcome which is comparable to the \"gold standard\" of the Bayesian ODE system.\n  Conclusions. In contrast to ODE systems in the literature, the setting of the\ndynamic MM is probabilistic at manageable computational effort (including\ncalibration).

The interest in these random variables is\ndue to the fact that the configuration model, conditioned on being simple, is a\nuniform random graph with prescribed degrees. Simplicity corresponds to the\nabsence of self-loops and multiple edges. We show that the number of self-loops\nand multiple edges converges in distribution to two independent Poisson random\nvariables when the second moment of the empirical degree distribution\nconverges. We also provide an estimate on the total variation distance between\nthe number of self-loops and multiple edges and the Poisson limit of their sum.\nThis revisits previous works of Bollob\\'as, of Janson, of Wormald and others.\nThe error estimates also imply sharp asymptotics for the number of simple\ngraphs with prescribed degrees.

The asymptotic independence of self-loops and multiple edges follows\nfrom a Poisson version of the Cram\\'er-Wold device using thinning, which is of\nindependent interest. When the degree distribution has infinite second moment,\nour general results break down. We can, however, prove a central limit theorem\nfor the number of self-loops, and for the multiple edges between vertices of\ndegrees much smaller than the square root of the size of the graph, or when we\ntruncate the degrees similarly.

The main problem in fitting the data is the\nlack of low spatial frequencies. This deficiency often leads to a local minimum\nand to non-plausible solutions.

By jointly inverting these\ntwo problems we enrich FWI with information that can replace low frequency\ndata. In addition, we use high order regularization, in a preliminary inversion\nstage, to prevent high frequency features from polluting our model in the\ninitial stages of the reconstruction. This regularization also promotes the\nnon-dominant low-frequency modes that exist in the FWI sensitivity. By applying\na joint FWI and travel time inversion we are able to obtain a smooth model than\ncan later be used to recover a good approximation for the true model.

In particular, model based real-time control of\nurban water infrastructures and online flood alarm systems require fast\nprediction of the network response at different actuation and/or parameter\nvalues. General purpose urban drainage simulators are too slow for this\napplication. Fast surrogate models, so-called emulators, provide a solution to\nthis efficiency demand. Emulators are attractive, because they sacrifice\nunneeded accuracy in favor of speed. However, they have to be fine-tuned to\npredict the system behavior satisfactorily. Also, some emulators fail to\nextrapolate the system behavior beyond the training set. Although, there are\nmany strategies for developing emulators, up until now the selection of the\nemulation strategy remains subjective. In this paper, we therefore compare the\nperformance of two families of emulators for open channel flows in the context\nof urban drainage simulators. We compare emulators that explicitly use\nknowledge of the simulator's equations, i.e. mechanistic emulators based on\nGaussian Processes, with purely data-driven emulators using matrix\nfactorization. Our results suggest that in many urban applications, naive\ndata-driven emulation outperforms mechanistic emulation.

As examples, the recently discovered impact of isospin dynamics on\nthe nuclear shell structure and the isospin-flip pairing vibrations are\ndiscussed.\n","Comment: Talk and contribution to the Proceedings of the International Nuclear\n  Physics Conference (INPC2016), Adelaide, Australia, September 11-16, 2016"]}]

At higher\ntemperatures ab-initio thermodynamics show, that the H-free surface is\nenergetically favored. To validate these theoretical predictions experiments at\nroom temperature and under ultrahigh vacuum conditions were performed.

At\ntemperatures above 820 K, the attached hydrogen gets desorbed. The adsorbed\nhydrogen atoms saturate the dangling bonds of the gallium and nitrogen surface\natoms and result in an inversion of the Ga-N surface dimer buckling.

In this paper, using a\nnumerical example, we demonstrate that incorporating the PCM in a photonic\nstructure can lead to a dramatic modification of the effects of light-induced\nphase transition, as compared to a stand-alone sample of the same PCM. Our\nfocus is on short pulses. We discuss some possible applications of such\nphase-changing photonic structures for optical sensing and limiting.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures"]}]

We show explicitly that the field-theoretic\ncalculation of the grand partition function in this formulation amounts to a\ncanonical trace over the eigenfunctions of the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian at fixed\ntotal number of bosons $N$, and that the additional trace over $N$ that is\nrequired in the grand-canonical formalism is never carried out. This implies\nthat what usually passes as the grand-canonical treatment of the Bogoliubov\nHamiltonian is not quite grand-canonical, and is in fact a canonical one. We\nalso show that the discontinuity in the condensate density predicted by\nprevious formulations of this theory as the temperature $T$ goes past the\ncritical transition temperature $T_c$ is a direct consequence of an\ninappropriate generalization of the Bogoliubov prescription to finite\ntemperatures, and that this discontinuity disappears when this prescription is\neither used as a zero temperature approximation or avoided altogether. Armed\nwith the above findings, we reformulate the statistical mechanics of\ninteracting bosons in the canonical ensemble and derive the thermodynamics of\nthe system. We then show how the canonical treatment can be used to setup a\ntruly grand-canonical description of the statistical mechanics of a weakly\ninteracting Bose gas where the average number of bosons in the system varies\nwith temperature, unlike existing formulations where the total number of bosons\n$N$ is taken to be a constant that does not depend on $T$.

By the Seiberg-Witten\nmap, the free electrons of the nano-scale ring in noncommutative phase space\ncan be mapped equivalently to the quantum mechanical (Heisenberg's algebra)\nphase space with an extra effective magnetic flux. We introduce two variables\nrelated to the persistent current in the ring to probe the noncommutative phase\nspace effect.

Transmitted x-ray spectra are computed for a calibration\nphantom. The transmitted spectra are used to compute random data for photon\ncounting detectors with pileup.

Neural network training data with extremely low noise are computed\nby averaging the random detected data with pileup for a large numbers of\nexposures of the phantom. Each exposure is equivalent to a projection image or\none projection of a computed tomography scan. Training data with high noise are\ncomputed by using data from one exposure.

In this investigation, this problem is\nrevisited in view of the recent progresses on the phase field approach to\nbrittle fracture. In this concern, a novel formulation combining the phase\nfield approach for modeling brittle fracture in the bulk and a cohesive zone\nmodel for pre-existing adhesive interfaces is herein proposed to investigate\nthe competition between crack penetration and deflection at an interface. The\nmodel, implemented within the finite element method framework using a\nmonolithic fully implicit solution strategy, is applied to provide a further\ninsight into the understanding of the role of model parameters on the above\ncompetition.

In the case of a\nbrittle interface, the asymptotic predictions based on linear elastic fracture\nmechanics criteria for crack penetration, single deflection or double\ndeflection are fully captured by the present method. Moreover, by increasing\nthe size of the process zone along the interface, or by varying the internal\nlength scale of the phase field model, new complex phenomena are emerging, such\nas simultaneous crack penetration and deflection and the transition from single\ncrack penetration to deflection and penetration with subsequent branching into\nthe bulk.\n"]}]

Each affine model represents a different system operating\nmode, corresponding to unobserved intents of other drivers or robots, or to\nfault types or attack strategies, etc. The input design problem aims to find\noptimal separating/discriminating (controlled) inputs such that the outputs of\nall the affine models are guaranteed to differ in at least one time instance.\nWe formulate this problem as a tractable mixed-integer linear program (MILP),\nwith an emphasis on guarantees for model discrimination and with no\nrelaxations. Moreover, our fairly general formulation allows the incorporation\nof differing objectives or responsibilities among rational agents. For\ninstance, each driver has to individually obey traffic rules, while\nsimultaneously optimizing for safety, comfort and energy efficiency. Finally,\nwe demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for identifying the intent of\nother human-driven or autonomous vehicles.\n"]}]

A comparison between lattice simulations and the Hadron\nResonance Gas (HRG) model suggested the existence of missing strange\nresonances. To clarify this issue we calculate the partial pressures of mesons\nand baryons with different strangeness quantum numbers using lattice\nsimulations in the confined phase of QCD. In order to make this calculation\nfeasible, we perform simulations at imaginary strangeness chemical potentials.\nWe systematically study the effect of different hadronic spectra on\nthermodynamic observables in the HRG model and compare to lattice QCD results.\nWe show that, for each hadronic sector, the well established states are not\nenough in order to have agreement with the lattice results. Additional states,\neither listed in the Particle Data Group booklet (PDG) but not well\nestablished, or predicted by the Quark Model (QM), are necessary in order to\nreproduce the lattice data. For mesons, it appears that the PDG and the quark\nmodel do not list enough strange mesons, or that, in this sector, interactions\nbeyond those included in the HRG model are needed to reproduce the lattice QCD\nresults.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 9 figures"]}]
