On the\nother hand, when the corresponding Lie group $G$ is simple and of real rank at\nleast two, we prove that there is only one possible BS-limit, i.e. when the\nvolume tends to infinity, locally symmetric spaces always BS-converge to their\nuniversal cover $G/K$. This leads to various general uniform results.\n  When restricting to arbitrary sequences of congruence covers of a fixed\narithmetic manifold we prove a strong quantitative version of BS-convergence\nwhich in turn implies upper estimates on the rate of convergence of normalized\nBetti numbers in the spirit of Sarnak--Xue.\n  An important role in our approach is played by the notion of Invariant Random\nSubgroups. For higher rank simple Lie groups $G$, we exploit rigidity theory,\nand in particular the Nevo--St\\\"{u}ck--Zimmer theorem and Kazhdan's property\n(T), to obtain a complete understanding of the space of IRSs of $G$.\n","Comment: The first version of this paper has been split into two papers.

However, two basic and ubiquitous\nproperties of cortical responses seem difficult to reconcile with probabilistic\ninference: neural activity displays prominent oscillations in response to\nconstant input, and large transient changes in response to stimulus onset. Here\nwe show that these dynamical behaviours may in fact be understood as hallmarks\nof the specific representation and algorithm that the cortex employs to perform\nprobabilistic inference. We demonstrate that a particular family of\nprobabilistic inference algorithms, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), naturally\nmaps onto the dynamics of excitatory-inhibitory neural networks. Specifically,\nwe constructed a model of an excitatory-inhibitory circuit in primary visual\ncortex that performed HMC inference, and thus inherently gave rise to\noscillations and transients. These oscillations were not mere epiphenomena but\nserved an important functional role: speeding up inference by rapidly spanning\na large volume of state space. Inference thus became an order of magnitude more\nefficient than in a non-oscillatory variant of the model.

These calculations are then expanded to the\ncritical behavior of Born-Infeld-AdS (BI-AdS) black holes in the third order of\nLovelock gravity and in the grand canonical ensemble to find a Van der Waals\nbehavior for $d=7$ and a reentrant phase transition for $d=8$ for specific\nvalues of potential $\\phi$ in the grand canonical ensemble.

A common theoretical framework is developed here to\ndescribe thermogravitational cycles which have the same efficiencies as the\nCarnot, Rankine or Brayton cycles. Considering a working fluid, enclosed in a\nballoon, inside a column filled with a transporting fluid, the cycle is\ncomposed of four steps. Starting from the top of the column, the balloon goes\ndown by gravity, receives heat from a hot source at the bottom, rises and\ndelivers heat to a cold source at the top. Unlike classic power cycles which\nneed external work to operate the compressor, thermogravitational cycles can\noperate as \"pure power cycle\" where no external work is provided to drive the\ncycle. To illustrate this concept, the prototype of a thermogravitational\nelectrical generator is presented.

Curiously, simulation\nresults in previous works suggested that the robust problem admits rank-one\noptimal transmit covariances in most cases.

Overcoming these limitations requires further development on\nclustering algorithms for high-performance cryo-EM data analysis.

High-resolution cryo-EM reconstruction often requires hundreds of\nthousands of single-particle images. Particle extraction from experimental\nmicrographs thus can be laborious and presents a major practical bottleneck in\ncryo-EM structural determination. Existing computational methods of particle\npicking often use low-resolution templates as inputs for particle matching,\nmaking it possible to cause reference-dependent bias. It is critical to develop\na highly efficient template-free method to automatically recognize particle\nimages from cryo-EM micrographs. Results: We developed a deep learning-based\nalgorithmic framework, DeepEM, for single-particle recognition from noisy\ncryo-EM micrographs, enabling automated particle picking, selection and\nverification in an integrated fashion. The kernel of DeepEM is built upon a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) of eight layers, which can be recursively\ntrained to be highly \"knowledgeable\". Our approach exhibits improved\nperformance and high precision when tested on the standard KLH dataset.\nApplication of DeepEM to several challenging experimental cryo-EM datasets\ndemonstrates its capability in avoiding selection of un-wanted particles and\nnon-particles even when true particles contain fewer features. Conclusions: The\nDeepEM method derived from a deep CNN allows automated particle extraction from\nraw cryo-EM micrographs in the absence of templates, which demonstrated\nimproved performance, objectivity and accuracy. Application of this novel\napproach is expected to free the labor involved in single-particle\nverification, thus promoting the efficiency of cryo-EM data processing.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 6 figures, 1 table"]}]

A common approach for exploring program\nbehaviors relies on enumerating the traces of the program, without storing the\nvisited states (aka stateless exploration). As the number of distinct traces\ngrows exponentially, dynamic partial-order reduction (DPOR) techniques have\nbeen successfully used to partition the space of traces into equivalence\nclasses (Mazurkiewicz partitioning), with the goal of exploring only few\nrepresentative traces from each class.\n  We introduce a new equivalence on traces under sequential consistency\nsemantics, which we call the observation equivalence. Two traces are\nobservationally equivalent if every read event observes the same write event in\nboth traces. While the traditional Mazurkiewicz equivalence is control-centric,\nour new definition is data-centric. We show that our observation equivalence is\ncoarser than the Mazurkiewicz equivalence, and in many cases even exponentially\ncoarser. We devise a DPOR exploration of the trace space, called data-centric\nDPOR, based on the observation equivalence. For acyclic architectures, our\nalgorithm is guaranteed to explore exactly one representative trace from each\nobservation class, while spending polynomial time per class. Hence, our\nalgorithm is optimal wrt the observation equivalence, and in several cases\nexplores exponentially fewer traces than any enumerative method based on the\nMazurkiewicz equivalence. For cyclic architectures, we consider an equivalence\nbetween traces which is finer than the observation equivalence; but coarser\nthan the Mazurkiewicz equivalence, and in some cases is exponentially coarser.\nOur data-centric DPOR algorithm remains optimal under this trace equivalence.\n"]}]

We extend the\nEclipse IDE and create new menu entries and associated action via the\nParichayana plug- in (free and open-source hosted on GitHub). We compare and\ncontrast Parichayana with several code smell detection tools and demonstrate\nthat our tool provides unique capabilities in context to existing tools. We\nhave created an update site and developers can use the Eclipse up- date manager\nto install Parichayana from our site. We used Parichyana on several large\nopen-source Java based projects and detected presence of exception handling\nanti-patterns\n","Comment: Tools Demo Paper (paper provides links to the video demo and source\n  code)"]}]

We propose two weak solution concepts for the\nrelated initial-boundary value problem, namely `entropic' and `weak energy'\nsolutions. Accordingly, we prove two existence results by passing to the limit\nin a carefully devised time discretization scheme. Finally, in the case of a\nprescribed temperature profile, and under a strongly simplifying condition, we\nprovide a continuous dependence result, yielding uniqueness of weak energy\nsolutions.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1609.07232"]}]

In the present work, we introduce a\nnovel approach for aggregating judgments - the transmission chain - which has\nnot yet been consistently evaluated in the context of collective intelligence.\nIn a transmission chain, all group members have access to a unique collective\nsolution and can improve it sequentially. Over repeated improvements, the\ncollective solution that emerges reflects the judgments of every group members.\nWe address the question of whether such a transmission chain can foster\ncollective intelligence for binary-choice problems. In a series of numerical\nsimulations, we explore the impact of various factors on the performance of the\ntransmission chain, such as the group size, the model parameters, and the\nstructure of the population. The performance of this method is compared to\nthose of the majority rule and the confidence-weighted majority. Finally, we\nrely on two existing datasets of individuals performing a series of binary\ndecisions to evaluate the expected performances of the three methods\nempirically. We find that the parameter space where the transmission chain has\nthe best performance rarely appears in real datasets. We conclude that the\ntransmission chain is best suited for other types of problems, such as those\nthat have cumulative properties.\n"]}]

As the proposed SWIFT does not adapt the BS's beams\nto any single user, we are able to estimate all user channels simultaneously.\nSimulation results show that SWIFT can significantly outperform the existing\nrandom beamforming-based approaches, which use a predetermined number of\nmeasurements, over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios and channel coherence\ntime. Furthermore, by utilizing the users' order in terms of completing their\nchannel estimation, our SWIFT framework can infer the sequence of users'\nchannel quality and perform effective user scheduling to achieve superior\nperformance.\n","Comment: Submitted for journal publication. arXiv admin note: substantial text\n  overlap with arXiv:1612.02113"]}]

The disc instability model (DIM) successfully explains why many\naccreting compact binary systems exhibit outbursts, during which their\nluminosity increases by orders of magnitude. The DIM correctly predicts which\nsystems should be transient and works regardless of whether the accretor is a\nblack hole, a neutron star or a white dwarf. However, it has been known for\nsome time that the outbursts of X-ray binaries (which contain neutron-star or\nblack-hole accretors) exhibit hysteresis in the X-ray hardness-intensity\ndiagram (HID). More recently, it has been shown that the outbursts of accreting\nwhite dwarfs also show hysteresis, but in a diagram combining optical, EUV and\nX-ray fluxes.\n  Aims. We examine here the nature of the hysteresis observed in cataclysmic\nvariables and low-mass X-ray binaries.\n  Methods. We use the Hameury et al.

Then, we show that the quadratic speedup obtained by the quantum\nsearching algorithm over classical brute force can still be obtained for a\nlarge family of search problems for which good classical heuristics exist.\nFinally, as our main result, we combine ideas from Grover's and Shor's quantum\nalgorithms to perform approximate counting, which can be seen as an amplitude\nestimation process.\n","Comment: 12 pages, LaTeX2e"]}]
