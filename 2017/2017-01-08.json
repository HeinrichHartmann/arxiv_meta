For example, an agent representing a seller\nin an auction should try to maximize the seller's profit by reasoning about a\nvariety of possibly uncertain pieces of information, such as the maximum prices\nvarious buyers might be willing to pay, the possible prices being offered by\ncompeting sellers, the rules by which the auction operates, the dynamic arrival\nand matching of offers to buy and sell, and so on. A naive application of\nmultiagent reasoning techniques would require the seller's agent to explicitly\nmodel all of the other agents through an extended time horizon, rendering the\nproblem intractable for many realistically-sized problems. We have instead\ndevised a new strategy that an agent can use to determine its bid price based\non a more tractable Markov chain model of the auction process. We have\nexperimentally identified the conditions under which our new strategy works\nwell, as well as how well it works in comparison to the optimal performance the\nagent could have achieved had it known the future. Our results show that our\nnew strategy in general performs well, outperforming other tractable heuristic\nstrategies in a majority of experiments, and is particularly effective in a\n'seller?s market', where many buy offers are available.\n"]}]
