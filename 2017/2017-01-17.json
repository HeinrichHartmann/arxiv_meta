X, a reciprocating\nfunction r is constructed, based only on the distribution of X, such that the\nconditional distribution of X given the (at-most-)two-point set {X,r(X)} is the\nzero-mean distribution on this set; in fact, a more general construction\nwithout the continuity assumption is given in this paper, as well as a large\nvariety of other related results, including characterizations of the\nreciprocating function and modeling distribution asymmetry patterns. The\nmentioned disintegration of zero-mean r.v.'s implies, in particular, that an\narbitrary zero-mean distribution is represented as the mixture of two-point\nzero-mean distributions; moreover, this mixture representation is most\nsymmetric in a variety of senses. Somewhat similar representations -- of any\nprobability distribution as the mixture of two-point distributions with the\nsame skewness coefficient (but possibly with different means) -- go back to\nKolmogorov; very recently, Aizenman et al. further developed such\nrepresentations and applied them to (anti-)concentration inequalities for\nfunctions of independent random variables and to spectral localization for\nrandom Schroedinger operators. One kind of application given in the present\npaper is to construct certain statistical tests for asymmetry patterns and for\nlocation without symmetry conditions. Exact inequalities implying conservative\nproperties of such tests are presented. These developments extend results\nestablished earlier by Efron, Eaton, and Pinelis under a symmetry condition.\n"]}]

The primary use of this\nembedding has been for practical spectral clustering algorithms [SM00,NJW02].\nRecently, spectral embedding was studied from a theoretical perspective to\nprove higher order variants of Cheeger's inequality [LOT12,LRTV12].\n  We use spectral embedding to provide a unifying framework for bounding all\nthe eigenvalues of graphs. For example, we show that for any finite graph with\nn vertices and all k >= 2, the k-th largest eigenvalue is at most\n1-Omega(k^3/n^3), which extends the only other such result known, which is for\nk=2 only and is due to [LO81]. This upper bound improves to 1-Omega(k^2/n^2) if\nthe graph is regular. We generalize these results, and we provide sharp bounds\non the spectral measure of various classes of graphs, including\nvertex-transitive graphs and infinite graphs, in terms of specific graph\nparameters like the volume growth.\n  As a consequence, using the entire spectrum, we provide (improved) upper\nbounds on the return probabilities and mixing time of random walks with\nconsiderably shorter and more direct proofs. Our work introduces spectral\nembedding as a new tool in analyzing reversible Markov chains.

Usually the software consists of many modules. Thus,\nthe delivered reliability is dependent on the operational profile which\nspecifies how the users will use these modules as well as the defect number\nremaining in each module. Therefore, a good testing policy should take the\noperational profile into account and dynamically select tested modules\naccording to the current state of the software during the testing process. This\npaper discusses how to dynamically select tested modules in order to maximize\ndelivered reliability by formulating the selection problem as a dynamic\nprogramming problem. As the testing process is performed only once, risk must\nbe considered during the testing process, which is described by the tester's\nutility function in this paper.

Despite their extreme\nsimplicity, these systems have been shown to cooperatively perform complex\ncomputational tasks, such as simulating register machines to compute standard\narithmetic functions. The election of a unique leader agent is a key\nrequirement in such computational constructions. Yet, the fastest currently\nknown population protocol for electing a leader only has linear convergence\ntime, and, it has recently been shown that no population protocol using a\nconstant number of states per node may overcome this linear bound.\n  In this paper, we give the first population protocol for leader election with\npolylogarithmic convergence time, using polylogarithmic memory states per node.\nThe protocol structure is quite simple: each node has an associated value, and\nis either a leader (still in contention) or a minion (following some leader). A\nleader keeps incrementing its value and \"defeats\" other leaders in one-to-one\ninteractions, and will drop from contention and become a minion if it meets a\nleader with higher value. Importantly, a leader also drops out if it meets a\nminion with higher absolute value. While these rules are quite simple, the\nproof that this algorithm achieves polylogarithmic convergence time is\nnon-trivial. In particular, the argument combines careful use of concentration\ninequalities with anti-concentration bounds, showing that the leaders' values\nbecome spread apart as the execution progresses, which in turn implies that\nstraggling leaders get quickly eliminated.

In a special case, we show that the Minkowski dimension of the\nlimiting spaces equal $(\\tau-2)/(\\tau-3)$ a.s., in stark contrast to the\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi scaling limit whose Minkowski dimension is 2 a.s. It is\ngenerally believed that dynamic versions of a number of fundamental random\ngraph models, as one moves from the barely subcritical to the critical regime\ncan be approximated by the multiplicative coalescent.

Inspired by developments in molecular\ncomputation, and in particular DNA computing, recent algorithmic work has\nfocused on the complexity of solving simple yet fundamental tasks in the\npopulation model, such as leader election (which requires convergence to a\nsingle agent in a special \"leader\" state), and majority (in which agents must\nconverge to a decision as to which of two possible initial states had higher\ninitial count). Known results point towards an inherent trade-off between the\ntime complexity of such algorithms, and the space complexity, i.e. size of the\nmemory available to each agent.\n  In this paper, we explore this trade-off and provide new upper and lower\nbounds for majority and leader election. First, we prove a unified lower bound,\nwhich relates the space available per node with the time complexity achievable\nby a protocol: for instance, our result implies that any protocol solving\neither of these tasks for $n$ agents using $O( \\log \\log n )$ states must take\n$\\Omega( n / \\rm{polylog} n )$ expected time. This is the first result to\ncharacterize time complexity for protocols which employ super-constant number\nof states per node, and proves that fast, poly-logarithmic running times\nrequire protocols to have relatively large space costs.\n  On the positive side, we give algorithms showing that fast, poly-logarithmic\nconvergence time can be achieved using $O( \\log^2 n )$ space per node, in the\ncase of both tasks. Overall, our results highlight a time complexity separation\nbetween $O(\\log \\log n)$ and $\\Theta( \\log^2 n )$ state space size for both\nmajority and leader election in population protocols, and introduce new\ntechniques, which should be applicable more broadly.\n"]}]

These decisions typically involve a tension between increasing the\ntotal level of group resources (i.e. social efficiency) and distributing these\nresources among group members (i.e. individuals' relative shares). This is the\ncase because the redistribution process may destroy part of the resources, thus\nresulting in socially inefficient allocations. Here we apply a dual-process\napproach to understand the cognitive underpinnings of this fundamental tension.\nWe conducted a set of experiments to examine the extent to which different\nallocation decisions respond to intuition or deliberation. In a newly developed\napproach, we assess intuition and deliberation at both the trait level (using\nthe Cognitive Reflection Test, henceforth CRT) and the state level (through the\nexperimental manipulation of response times). To test for robustness,\nexperiments were conducted in two countries: the US and India. Despite absolute\nlevel differences across countries, in both locations we show that: (i) time\npressure and low CRT scores are associated with individuals' concerns for their\nrelative shares; (ii) time delay and high CRT scores are associated with\nindividuals' concerns for social efficiency. These findings demonstrate that\ndeliberation favours social efficiency by overriding individuals' intuitive\ntendency to focus on relative shares.\n","Comment: Forthcoming in Royal Society Open Science"]}]

This allows for action functionals which are gauge invariant for rather\ngeneral background fields in the sense that their invariance conditions are\nmilder than the usual case. In particular, the vector fields that control the\ngauging need not be Killing. The relaxation of isometry for the background\nfields is controlled by two connections on a Lie algebroid L in which the gauge\nfields take values, in a generalization of the common Lie-algebraic picture.\nHere we show that these connections can always be determined when L is a Dirac\nstructure in the H-twisted Courant algebroid.

Classical empirical\nprocess theory implies uniform convergence of the empirical risk to the\npopulation risk. While uniform convergence implies consistency of the resulting\nM-estimator, it does not ensure that the latter can be computed efficiently.\n  In order to capture the complexity of computing M-estimators, we propose to\nstudy the landscape of the empirical risk, namely its stationary points and\ntheir properties.

Consequently, good properties of the population risk can\nbe carried to the empirical risk, and we can establish one-to-one\ncorrespondence of their stationary points. We demonstrate that in several\nproblems such as non-convex binary classification, robust regression, and\nGaussian mixture model, this result implies a complete characterization of the\nlandscape of the empirical risk, and of the convergence properties of descent\nalgorithms.\n  We extend our analysis to the very high-dimensional setting in which the\nnumber of parameters exceeds the number of samples, and provide a\ncharacterization of the empirical risk landscape under a nearly\ninformation-theoretically minimal condition.

The smallest scale length\nassociated with variations parallel to the wall is taken to be across the\nmagnetic field, and ordered $l = \\rho_{\\text{i}} / \\delta$, where $ \\delta \\ll\n1$ is assumed. The scale lengths along the magnetic field line are assumed so\nlong that variations associated with this direction are neglected. These\norderings are consistent with what we expect close to the divertor target of a\ntokamak. We allow for a strong component of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ in the\ndirection normal to the electron repelling wall, with strong variation in the\nsame direction. The large change of the electric field over an ion Larmor\nradius distorts the orbit so that it is not circular. We solve for the lowest\norder orbits by identifying coordinates, which consist of constants of\nintegration, an adiabatic invariant and a gyrophase, associated with periodic\nion motion in the system with $\\alpha = \\delta = 0$. By using these new\ncoordinates as variables in the limit $\\alpha \\sim \\delta \\ll 1$, we obtain a\ngeneralized ion gyrokinetic equation. We find another quantity that is\nconserved to first order and use this to simplify the gyrokinetic equation,\nsolving it in the case of a collisionless magnetic presheath. Assuming a\nBoltzmann response for the electrons, a form of the quasineutrality equation\nthat exploits the change of variables is derived. The gyrokinetic and\nquasineutrality equations give the ion distribution function and electrostatic\npotential in the magnetic presheath if the entrance boundary condition is\nspecified.\n","Comment: 55 pages including appendices and references"]}]

At small values of the ratio, the levels are\nsqueezed into narrow bunches separated by wide smile gaps. Each bunch consists\nof almost degenerate ABSs.\n  We study in detail the properties of the spectrum in the limit of a small\nratio, paying special attention to the crossings of bunches. We distinguish two\ntypes of crossings: i. with a regular phase dependence of the levels and ii.\ncrossings where the Brownian motion of the levels leads to an apparently\nirregular phase-dependence. We work out a perturbation theory to explain the\nobservations.\n  The unusual properties of the spectrum originate from unobvious topological\neffects. Topology of the first kind is related to the winding of the\nsemiclassical Green's function. It is responsible for the proximity gaps.\nTopology of the second kind comes about the discreteness of the number of modes\nand is responsible for the smile gaps.\n","Comment: 20 pages with 20 figures"]}]

In the general third order truncated form of fRG,\nthe dependence of the two-particle vertex is described by O(N^4) independent\nvariables, where N is the dimension of the single-particle system. In a\nprevious paper [Phys. Rev. B 89, 045128 (2014)], the so-called coupled-ladder\napproximation (CLA) was introduced and shown to admit a consistent treatment\nfor models with a purely onsite interaction, reducing the vertex to O(N^2)\nindependent variables. Here, we extend this scheme to the extended coupled\nladder approximation (eCLA), which includes a spatially extended feedback\nbetween the individual channels, measured by a feedback length L, using O(N^2\nL^2) independent variables for the vertex. We apply the eCLA to three types of\none-dimensional models : First, to a quantum point contact (QPC) with a\nparabolic barrier top and short-ranged interactions. Here eCLA achieves\nconvergence for L equal to the characteristic length l_x of the QPC. It also\nturns out that the additional feedback stabilizes the fRG-flow. This enables\nus, second, to study the crossover between a QPC and a quantum dot, again for a\nmodel with short-ranged interactions. Third, the enlarged feedback also enables\nthe treatment of a finite-ranged interaction extending over up to L sites.\nEstimating the form of such a finite-ranged interaction in a QPC, we study its\neffects on the conductance and the density. For low densities and sufficiently\nlarge interaction ranges the conductance develops additional oscillatory\nfeatures, and the corresponding density shows fluctuations that can be\ninterpreted as Friedel oscillations arising from a renormalized barrier shape\nwith a rather flat top and steep flanks.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 14 figures"]}]

We analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each learning\nstrategy and validate our methods on public datasets which contain four kinds\nof named entities, i.e., movies, TV shows, restaurants and celebrities. The\nexperimental results indicate that our proposed methods can adapt to different\ntypes of entity search queries, and outperform the current state-of-the-art\nmethods based on keyword matching and vanilla word2vec models. Besides, the\nproposed methods can be trained fast and be easily extended to other similar\ntasks.\n","Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author because the proposed\n  model need to be re-evaluate"]}]

Moreover, for a fixed\ninteraction splitting, as coupling rate increases, the optimal strength\ndecreases and tends towards the experimental predictions.

When relating\nthe black-hole electric charges to the baryon-chemical potentials it was found\nthat the phenomenologically-deduced parameters from various particle ratios in\nthe statistical thermal models agree well with the ones determined from the\nthermal radiation from charged black-hole. Accordingly, the resulting freezeout\nconditions, such as $s/T^3=7$ and $<E>/<N>=1~$GeV, are confirmed at finite\nchemical potentials, as well. Furthermore, the problematic of strangeness\nproduction in elementary collisions can be interpreted by thermal particle\nproduction from the Hawking-Unruh radiation. Consequently, the freezeout\ntemperature depends on the quark masses. This leads to a deviation from full\nequilibrium and thus a suppression of the strangeness production in the\nelementary collisions. But in nucleus-nucleus collisions, an average\ntemperature should be introduced in order to dilute the quark masses. This\nnearly removes the strangeness suppression.

In contrast, a NNEM's architecture recurrent\nactivity doesn't involve a long chain of activity (though some architectures\nsuch as the NTM do utilize a traditional recurrent architecture as a\ncontroller). Rather, the externally stored embedding vectors are used at each\ntime-step, but no messages are passed from previous time-steps. This means that\nvanishing gradients aren't a problem, as all of the necessary gradient paths\nare short. However, these paths are extremely numerous (one per embedding\nvector in memory) and reused for a very long time (until it leaves the memory).\nThus, the forward-pass information of each memory must be stored for the entire\nduration of the memory. This is problematic as this additional storage far\nsurpasses that of the actual memories, to the extent that large memories on\ninfeasible to back-propagate through in high dimensional settings. One way to\nget around the need to hold onto forward-pass information is to recalculate the\nforward-pass whenever gradient information is available. However, if the\nobservations are too large to store in the domain of interest, direct\nreinstatement of a forward pass cannot occur. Instead, we rely on a learned\nautoencoder to reinstate the observation, and then use the embedding network to\nrecalculate the forward-pass. Since the recalculated embedding vector is\nunlikely to perfectly match the one stored in memory, we try out 2\napproximations to utilize error gradient w.r.t. the vector in memory.\n","Comment: Accepted into the NIPS 2016 workshop on Continual Learning"]}]

In the static declaration strategy\nthat is used in toolkits like Theano, CNTK, and TensorFlow, the user first\ndefines a computation graph (a symbolic representation of the computation), and\nthen examples are fed into an engine that executes this computation and\ncomputes its derivatives. In DyNet's dynamic declaration strategy, computation\ngraph construction is mostly transparent, being implicitly constructed by\nexecuting procedural code that computes the network outputs, and the user is\nfree to use different network structures for each input. Dynamic declaration\nthus facilitates the implementation of more complicated network architectures,\nand DyNet is specifically designed to allow users to implement their models in\na way that is idiomatic in their preferred programming language (C++ or\nPython). One challenge with dynamic declaration is that because the symbolic\ncomputation graph is defined anew for every training example, its construction\nmust have low overhead. To achieve this, DyNet has an optimized C++ backend and\nlightweight graph representation.

In this work, we establish an optimal\ncontrol framework to derive the analytical solution to an ISP's optimal service\ndifferentiation, i.e. the optimal service qualities and associated prices. By\nanalyzing the structures of the solution, we reveal how an ISP should adjust\nthe service qualities and prices in order to meet varying capacity constraints\nand users' characteristics. We also obtain the conditions under which ISPs have\nstrong incentives to implement service differentiation and whether regulators\nshould encourage such practices.\n"]}]

Linear decision rules (LDRs) yield an approximation of an MSLP by\nrestricting the decisions at each stage to be an affine function of the\nobserved uncertain parameters. Finding an optimal LDR is a static optimization\nproblem that provides an upper bound on the optimal value of the MSLP, and,\nunder certain assumptions, can be formulated as an explicit linear program.\nSimilarly, as proposed by Kuhn, Wiesemann, and Georghiou (Math. Program., 130,\n177-209, 2011) a lower bound for an MSLP can be obtained by restricting\ndecisions in the dual of the MSLP to follow an LDR. We propose a new\napproximation approach for MSLPs, two-stage LDRs. The idea is to require only\nthe state variables in an MSLP to follow an LDR, which is sufficient to obtain\nan approximation of an MSLP that is a two-stage stochastic linear program\n(2SLP). We similarly propose to apply LDR only to a subset of the variables in\nthe dual of the MSLP, which yields a 2SLP approximation of the dual that\nprovides a lower bound on the optimal value of the MSLP. Although solving the\ncorresponding 2SLP approximations exactly is intractable in general, we\ninvestigate how approximate solution approaches that have been developed for\nsolving 2SLP can be applied to solve these approximation problems, and derive\nstatistical upper and lower bounds on the optimal value of the MSLP. In\naddition to potentially yielding better policies and bounds, this approach\nrequires many fewer assumptions than are required to obtain an explicit\nreformulation when using the standard static LDR approach. As an illustrative\nexample we apply our approach to a capacity expansion model, and find that the\ntwo-stage LDR policy has expected cost between 20% and 34% lower than the\nstatic LDR policy, and in the dual yields lower bounds that are between 0.1%\nand 3.3% better.\n"]}]

Many different approaches\nfor specifying a set of distributions have been proposed.

In this paper, we\nconsider problems in which different random variables exhibit some form of\ndependence, but the exact values of the parameters that represent the\ndependence are not known. We consider various sets of distributions that\nincorporate the dependence structure, and we study the corresponding DRSO\nproblems.\n  In the first part of the paper, we consider problems with linear dependence\nbetween random variables. We consider sets of distributions that are within a\nspecified Wasserstein distance of a nominal distribution, and that satisfy a\nsecond-order moment constraint. We obtain a tractable dual reformulation of the\ncorresponding DRSO problem. This approach is compared with the traditional\nmoment-based DRSO and Wasserstein-based DRSO with no moment constraints.\nNumerical experiments suggest that our new formulation has superior\nout-of-sample performance.\n  In the second part of the paper, we consider problems with various types of\nrank dependence between random variables, including rank dependence measured by\nSpearman's footrule distance between empirical rankings, comonotonic\ndistributions, box uncertainty for individual observations, and Wasserstein\ndistance between copulas associated with continuous distributions.

These questions\nconcern specifically (1) whether a change in sign of the Hall coefficient R_H\nwith magnetic field and temperature is dependent on a `special' form for the\nrounding of the vertices, (2) whether a pocket of such a geometry can produce\nquantum oscillations in R_H in the absence of other Fermi surface sections and\n(3) whether a reconstructed Fermi surface consisting of a single pocket is less\n`natural' than one consisting of multiple pockets. Below we consider each of\nthese in turn.\n"]}]

We\nfurther improve our lower bound to $\\Omega(n/\\alpha^2)$ in the case of dense\ngraphs.\n  Furthermore, we prove that a $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation to matching size in\ninsertion-only streams requires RS$(n) \\cdot n^{1-O(\\epsilon)}$ space; here,\nRS${n}$ denotes the maximum number of edge-disjoint induced matchings of size\n$\\Theta(n)$ in an $n$-vertex graph. It is a major open problem to determine the\nvalue of RS$(n)$, and current results leave open the possibility that RS$(n)$\nmay be as large as $n/\\log n$. We also show how to avoid the dependency on the\nparameter RS$(n)$ in proving lower bound for dynamic streams and present a\nnear-optimal lower bound of $n^{2-O(\\epsilon)}$ for\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation in this model.\n  Using a well-known connection between matching size and matrix rank, all our\nlower bounds also hold for the problem of estimating matrix rank. In particular\nour results imply a near-optimal $n^{2-O(\\epsilon)}$ bit lower bound for\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation of matrix ranks for dense matrices in dynamic\nstreams, answering an open question of Li and Woodruff (STOC 2016).\n"]}]
