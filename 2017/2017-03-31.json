This prevents harvesting to\nextinction. A known exception can occur if consumer demand causes a declining\nspecies' harvest price to rise faster than costs. This threat may affect rare\nand valuable species, such as large land mammals, sturgeons, and bluefin tunas.\nWe analyze a similar but underappreciated threat, which arises when the\ngeographic area (range) occupied by a species contracts as its abundance\ndeclines. Range contractions maintain the local densities of declining\npopulations, which facilitates harvesting to extinction by preventing abundance\ndeclines from causing harvest costs to rise. Factors causing such range\ncontractions include schooling, herding, or flocking behaviors--which,\nironically, can be predator-avoidance adaptations; patchy environments; habitat\nloss; and climate change. We use a simple model to identify combinations of\nrange contractions and price increases capable of causing extinction from\nprofitable overharvesting, and we compare these to an empirical review. We find\nthat some aquatic species that school or forage in patchy environments\nexperience sufficiently severe range contractions as they decline to allow\nprofitable harvesting to extinction even with little or no price increase; and\nsome high-value declining aquatic species experience severe price increases.\nFor terrestrial species, the data needed to evaluate our theory are scarce, but\navailable evidence suggests that extinction-enabling range contractions may be\ncommon among declining mammals and birds.

When we carefully examine the\nposition dependence of the boundary unitary operator that produces the\nexcitation and the bulk observable necessary to detect the anomalously large\neffect, we find that they do not both fit in a single causal patch.

This hypothesis has\nbeen tested previously by measuring the information transfer between brain\nareas, and by taking reduced information transfer as a proxy for decoupling.\nYet, information transfer is a function of the amount of information available\nin the information source-such that transfer decreases even for unchanged\ncoupling when less source information is available. Therefore, we asked whether\nimpaired local information processing leads to a loss of information transfer.\nAn important prediction of this alternative hypothesis is that changes in\nlocally available information (signal entropy) should be at least as pronounced\nas changes in information transfer. We tested this prediction by recording\nlocal field potentials in two ferrets after administration of isoflurane in\nconcentrations of 0.0 %, 0.5 %, and 1.0 %.\n  We found strong decreases in the source entropy under isoflurane in area V1\nand the prefrontal cortex (PFC)-as predicted by our alternative hypothesis. The\ndecrease in source entropy was stronger in PFC. Information transfer between V1\nand PFC was reduced bidirectionally, but with a stronger decrease from PFC to\nV1. This links the stronger decrease in information transfer to the stronger\ndecrease in source entropy, suggesting reduced source entropy reduces\ninformation transfer. This conclusion fits the observation that the synaptic\ntargets of isoflurane are located in local cortical circuits rather than on the\nsynapses formed by interareal axonal projections. Thus, changes in information\ntransfer under isoflurane seem to be a consequence of changes in local\nprocessing more than of decoupling between brain areas. We suggest that source\nentropy changes must be considered whenever interpreting changes in information\ntransfer as decoupling.\n","Comment: 48 pages, 11 Figures"]}]

We find two distinct modes of accretion depending\non the resistivity and field strength. A small resistivity or high field\nstrength promotes the development of rapidly infalling `avalanche accretion\nstreams' in a vertically extended disk envelope that dominates the dynamics of\nthe system, especially the mass accretion. The streams are suppressed in\nsimulations with larger resistivities or lower field strengths, where most of\nthe accretion instead occurs through a laminar disk. In these simulations, the\ndisk accretion is driven mainly by a slow wind that is typically accelerated by\nthe pressure gradient from a predominantly toroidal magnetic field. Both\nwind-dominated and stream-dominated modes of accretion create prominent\nfeatures in the surface density distribution of the disk, including rings and\ngaps, with a strong spatial variation of the magnetic flux relative to the\nmass. Regions with low mass-to-flux ratios accrete quickly, leading to the\ndevelopment of gaps, whereas regions with higher mass-to-flux ratios tend to\naccrete more slowly, allowing matter to accumulate and form dense rings. In\nsome cases, avalanche accretion streams are observed to produce dense rings\ndirectly through continuous feeding.

Logic locking, a promising solution to mitigate this threat,\nadds extra logic gates (key gates) and inputs (key bits) to the chip so that it\nfunctions correctly only when the correct key, known only to the designer but\nnot the foundry, is applied. In this paper, we identify a new vulnerability in\nall existing logic locking schemes. Prior attacks on logic locking have assumed\nthat, in addition to the design of the locked chip, the attacker has access to\na working copy of the chip. Our attack does not require a working copy and yet\nwe successfully recover a significant fraction of key bits from the design of\nthe locked chip only. Empirically, we demonstrate the success of our attack on\neight large benchmark circuits from a benchmark suite that has been tailored\nspecifically for logic synthesis research, for two different logic locking\nschemes. Then, to address this vulnerability, we initiate the study of provably\nsecure logic locking mechanisms.

We establish that\nany locking procedure that is secure under our definition is guaranteed to\ncounter our desynthesis attack, and all other such known attacks. We then\ndevise a new logic locking procedure, Meerkat, that guarantees that the locked\nchip reveals no information about the key or the designer's intended\nfunctionality. A main insight behind Meerkat is that canonical representations\nof boolean functionality via Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (ROBDDs)\ncan be leveraged effectively to provide security.

Due to the problem complexity, we propose a\ngradient-projection-based (GP) algorithm to obtain an optimal solution.\nMoreover, a nonalternating sub-optimal solution is proposed by assuming a\nrank-1 relay amplification matrix, and separating the design of the relay\nprocess into multiple stages (MuStR1). The proposed MuStR1 method is then\nenhanced by introducing an alternating update over the optimization variables,\ndenoted as AltMuStR1 algorithm. It is observed that compared to GP, (Alt)MuStR1\nalgorithms significantly reduce the required computational complexity at the\nexpense of a slight performance degradation. Finally, the proposed methods are\nevaluated under various system conditions, and compared with the methods\navailable in the current literature. In particular, it is observed that as the\nhardware impairments increase, or for a system with a high transmit power, the\nimpact of applying a distortion-aware design is significant.\n","Comment: To be submitted to IEEE for possible publication"]}]

They also provide insights on close binary\nevolution and hierarchical structure formation. Sub-parsec BBHs cannot be\nspatially resolved but indirect methods can identify candidates. In 2015 Liu et\nal. reported an optical-continuum periodicity in the quasar PSO\nJ334.2028+01.4075, with the estimated mass and rest-frame period suggesting an\norbital separation of about 0.006 pc (0.7 micro-arcsec). The persistence of the\nquasar's optical periodicity has recently been disfavored over an extended\nbaseline. However, if a radio jet is launched from a sub-parsec BBH, the\nbinary's properties can influence the radio structure on larger scales. Here,\nwe use the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array\n(VLA) to study the parsec- and kiloparsec-scale emission energized by the\nquasar's putative BBH. We find two VLBA components separated by 3.6 mas (30\npc), tentatively identifying one as the VLBA \"core\" from which the other was\nejected. The VLBA components contribute to a point-like, time-variable VLA\nsource that is straddled by lobes spanning 8 arcsec (66 kpc). We classify PSO\nJ334.2028+01.4075 as a lobe-dominated quasar, albeit with an atypically large\ntwist of 39 deg between its elongation position angles on parsec- and\nkiloparsec-scales. By analogy with 3C 207, a well-studied lobe-dominated quasar\nwith a similarly-rare twist, we speculate that PSO J334.2028+01.4075 could be\nejecting jet components over an inner cone that traces a precessing jet in a\nBBH system.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.

We show that\nthis is necessary even in undirected unweighted graphs, and even if you allow\nfor a small additive error: If you aim at size $O(n^{2-\\epsilon})$ for\n$\\epsilon>0$, then the additive error has to be $\\Omega(\\eps f)$.

However, this effect completely disappears in the\nunstable (spinodal) regime, indicating the absence of the activation barrier\neven for bulk LLT. This confirms the presence of nucleation-growth-type and\nspinodal-decomposition-type LLT, supporting that LLT is truly a first-order\ntransition with criticality.

We consider a Dirac field coupled to a\nspatially flat, homogeneous, and isotropic cosmology, sourced by a scalar\ninflaton, and treat the Dirac field as a perturbation. We describe the\ninhomogeneities of this field in terms of creation and annihilation variables,\nchosen to admit a unitary evolution if the Dirac fermion were treated as a test\nfield. Considering instead the full system, we truncate its action at quadratic\nperturbative order and construct a canonical formulation. In particular this\nimplies that, in the global Hamiltonian constraint of the model, the\ncontribution of the homogeneous sector is corrected with a quadratic\nperturbative term. We then adopt the hybrid LQC approach to quantize the full\nmodel, combining the loop representation of the homogeneous geometry with the\nFock quantization of the inhomogeneities. We assume a Born-Oppenheimer ansatz\nfor physical states and show how to obtain a Schr\\\"odinger equation for the\nquantum evolution of the perturbations, where the role of time is played by the\nhomogeneous inflaton. We prove that the resulting quantum evolution of the\nDirac field is indeed unitary, despite the fact that the underlying homogeneous\ngeometry has been quantized as well. Remarkably, in such evolution, the fermion\nfield couples to an infinite sequence of quantum moments of the homogeneous\ngeometry. Moreover, the evolved Fock vacuum of our fermion perturbations is\nshown to be an exact solution of the Schr\\\"odinger equation. Finally, we\ndiscuss in detail the quantum backreaction that the fermion field introduces in\nthe global Hamiltonian constraint. For completeness, our quantum study includes\nsince the beginning (gauge-invariant) scalar and tensor perturbations, that\nwere studied in previous works.\n","Comment: 38 pages.

The Galactic rest frame velocities range from\n203 km\\,s$^{-1}$ to 660 km\\,s$^{-1}$, indicating that most likely all four\nstars are gravitationally bound to the Galaxy. With $T_\\text{eff}=47000$ K and\na surface gravity of $\\log g = 5.7$, SDSS J205030.39$-$061957.8 (J2050) is a\nspectroscopic twin of the hypervelocity He-sdO US 708. As for the latter, the\nGC is excluded as a place of origin based on the kinematic analysis. Hence, the\nHills mechanism can be excluded for J2050. The ejection velocity is much more\nmoderate ($385\\pm79$ km\\,s$^{-1}$) than that of US 708 ($998\\pm68$\nkm\\,s$^{-1}$). The binary thermonuclear supernova scenario suggested for US 708\nwould explain the observed properties of J2050 very well without pushing the\nmodel parameters to their extreme limits, as required for US 708. Accordingly,\nthe star would be the surviving donor of a type Ia supernova. Three sdB stars\nalso showed extreme kinematics; one could be a HVS ejected from the GC, whereas\nthe other two could be ejected from the Galactic disk through the binary\nsupernova mechanism. Alternatively, they might be extreme halo stars.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication by A&A"]}]

Fifteen MR images with various types of brain tumors were\nretrospectively collected to undergo manual and automatic segmentation. Mean\nDice Similarity coefficients around 0.80 were reported.

In this case, results obtained from the\nautomatic contours mostly lie on the variability of the observers, showing no\nsignificant differences with respect to them. These results suggest therefore\nthat the proposed system is more accurate than other presented approaches, up\nto date, to segment these structures.

We propose to base the RA in multi-antenna CRAN\nsystems on the position information of user terminals only. We use Random\nForests as supervised machine learning approach to determine the multi-user\nRAs. This likely leads to lower overhead costs, as the acquisition of position\ninformation requires less radio resources in comparison to the acquisition of\ninstantaneous CSI. The results show the following findings: I) In general,\nlearning-based RA schemes can achieve comparable spectral efficiency to\nCSI-based scheme; II) If taking the system overhead into account,\nlearning-based RA scheme utilizing position information outperform legacy\nCSI-based scheme by up to 100%; III) Despite their dependency on the training\ndata, Random Forests based RA scheme is robust against position inaccuracies\nand changes in the propagation scenario; IV) The most important factor\ninfluencing the performance of learning-based RA scheme is the antenna\norientation, for which we present three approaches that restore most of the\noriginal performance results. To the best of our knowledge, these insights are\nnew and indicate a novel as well as promising approach to master the complexity\nin future cellular networks.\n"]}]

Our goal is to learn a mapping $G: X \\rightarrow Y$\nsuch that the distribution of images from $G(X)$ is indistinguishable from the\ndistribution $Y$ using an adversarial loss. Because this mapping is highly\nunder-constrained, we couple it with an inverse mapping $F: Y \\rightarrow X$\nand introduce a cycle consistency loss to push $F(G(X)) \\approx X$ (and vice\nversa). Qualitative results are presented on several tasks where paired\ntraining data does not exist, including collection style transfer, object\ntransfiguration, season transfer, photo enhancement, etc. Quantitative\ncomparisons against several prior methods demonstrate the superiority of our\napproach.\n","Comment: Submitted to ICCV 2017"]}]

If the\nmotion is chaotic, in the sense of non-zero maximal Characteristic Lyapunov\nExponent (mLCE), then REM increases exponentially with time, as exp \\lambda t,\nwhile when the motion is regular (quasi-periodic) then REM increases as a power\nlaw in time, as t^{\\alpha}, where {\\alpha} and {\\lambda} are real coefficients.\nWe compare the REM with a variant of mLCE, the Mean Exponential Growth factor\nof Nearby Orbits (MEGNO).
