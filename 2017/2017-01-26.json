The basic idea behind this framework is to map distributions into a\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) in which the whole arsenal of kernel\nmethods can be extended to probability measures. It can be viewed as a\ngeneralization of the original \"feature map\" common to support vector machines\n(SVMs) and other kernel methods. While initially closely associated with the\nlatter, it has meanwhile found application in fields ranging from kernel\nmachines and probabilistic modeling to statistical inference, causal discovery,\nand deep learning. The goal of this survey is to give a comprehensive review of\nexisting work and recent advances in this research area, and to discuss the\nmost challenging issues and open problems that could lead to new research\ndirections. The survey begins with a brief introduction to the RKHS and\npositive definite kernels which forms the backbone of this survey, followed by\na thorough discussion of the Hilbert space embedding of marginal distributions,\ntheoretical guarantees, and a review of its applications. The embedding of\ndistributions enables us to apply RKHS methods to probability measures which\nprompts a wide range of applications such as kernel two-sample testing,\nindependent testing, and learning on distributional data. Next, we discuss the\nHilbert space embedding for conditional distributions, give theoretical\ninsights, and review some applications. The conditional mean embedding enables\nus to perform sum, product, and Bayes' rules---which are ubiquitous in\ngraphical model, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning---in a\nnon-parametric way. We then discuss relationships between this framework and\nother related areas. Lastly, we give some suggestions on future research\ndirections.\n","Comment: 147 pages; this is a version of the manuscript after the review\n  process"]}]

Finding the \"best\" set of vertices of a\ntournament is a well studied problem in social choice theory. A {\\em tournament\nsolution} takes a tournament as input and outputs a subset of vertices of the\ninput tournament. However, in many applications, for example, choosing the best\nset of drugs from a given set of drugs, the edges of the tournament are given\nonly implicitly and knowing the orientation of an edge is costly. In such\nscenarios, we would like to know the best set of vertices (according to some\ntournament solution) by \"querying\" as few edges as possible. We, in this paper,\nprecisely study this problem for commonly used tournament solutions: given an\noracle access to the edges of a tournament T, find $f(T)$ by querying as few\nedges as possible, for a tournament solution f. We first show that the set of\nCondorcet non-losers in a tournament can be found by querying $2n-\\lfloor \\log\nn \\rfloor -2$ edges only and this is tight in the sense that every algorithm\nfor finding the set of Condorcet non-losers needs to query at least $2n-\\lfloor\n\\log n \\rfloor -2$ edges in the worst case, where $n$ is the number of vertices\nin the input tournament. We then move on to study other popular tournament\nsolutions and show that any algorithm for finding the Copeland set, the Slater\nset, the Markov set, the bipartisan set, the uncovered set, the Banks set, and\nthe top cycle must query $\\Omega(n^2)$ edges in the worst case. On the positive\nside, we are able to circumvent our strong query complexity lower bound results\nby proving that, if the size of the top cycle of the input tournament is at\nmost $k$, then we can find all the tournament solutions mentioned above by\nquerying $O(nk + \\frac{n\\log n}{\\log(1-\\frac{1}{k})})$ edges only.\n","Comment: To appear in AAAI 2017"]}]

The distributions of\nthe test statistics may be non-standard -- so corrections to usual asymptotic\ncritical values are needed -- but the characterizations are sufficiently\nexplicit to yield finite-sample (Monte-Carlo) tests of the exogeneity\nhypothesis.

In the extreme case where\nno structural parameter is identified, the distributions under the alternative\nhypothesis and the null hypothesis are identical, so the power function is\nflat, for all the exogeneity statistics.

Calibration time can be reduced or eliminated e.g.~by transfer of a\npre-trained classifier or unsupervised adaptive classification methods which\nlearn from scratch and adapt over time.

Our objective is to\nmodify an event-related potential (ERP) paradigm to work in unison with the\nmachine learning decoder to achieve a reliable calibration-less decoding with a\nguarantee to recover the true class means.\n  Method: We introduce learning from label proportions (LLP) to the BCI\ncommunity as a new unsupervised, and easy-to-implement classification approach\nfor ERP-based BCIs. The LLP estimates the mean target and non-target responses\nbased on known proportions of these two classes in different groups of the\ndata.

For\nevaluation, we ran simulations on artificially created data sets and conducted\nan online BCI study with N=13 subjects performing a copy-spelling task.\n  Results: Theoretical considerations show that LLP is guaranteed to minimize\nthe loss function similarly to a corresponding supervised classifier.

Additionally, LLP works on complementary\nprinciples compared to existing unsupervised methods, allowing for their\nfurther enhancement when combined with LLP.\n","Comment: The EEG data of 13 subjects is freely available online at:\n  http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.192684"]}]

We further analysed archival data taken in 2000 and 2012.\nResults: We detect the source at 5 GHz and on short baselines at 8 GHz. At 15\nand 24 GHz, the source is below our baseline sensitivity for fringe fitting,\nindicating the lack of prominent compact features. The morphology is that of an\nasymmetric double, with significant diffuse emission. The spectrum between 5\nand 8 GHz is rather steep ($S(\\nu)\\sim\\nu^{-(1.0\\pm0.2)}$).

Raw images are in the\nform of triangulated surfaces and the first step is to create a standardised\nrepresentation of surface shape which provides a meaningful correspondence\nacross different images, to provide a basis for statistical analysis. Point\nlocations with anatomical definitions, referred to as landmarks, have been the\ntraditional approach, with analysis and interpretation which is widely used and\nwell understood. Landmarks can also be taken as the starting point for more\ngeneral surface representations, often using templates which are warped on to\nan observed surface by matching landmark positions and subsequent local\nadjustment of the surface. The aim of the present paper is to use the\nintermediate structures of ridge and valley curves to capture the principal\nfeatures of the manifold (surface) of interest. Landmarks are used as anchoring\npoints, as usual, but curvature information across the surface is used to guide\nthe curve locations. Once the ridges and valleys have been located, the\nintervening surface patches are relatively flat and can be represented in a\nstandardised manner by appropriate surface transects, to give a complete\nsurface model. However, the intermediate curve representation is of\nconsiderable interest in its own right, as it captures the principal features\nof the surface and therefore embodies much of the shape information on the\nobject of interest.\n  Methods of identifying these curves are described and evaluated. While the\nmethods are generic, the human face is used as an important application. In\nparticular, the models are used to investigate sexual dimorphism (the\ndifferences in shape between male and female faces).

Despite this,\nour collective memory is often short on such matters, focusing on present\ntriumphs and quickly forgetting past failures. This makes us less tolerant to\nthat which challenges present orthodoxy. It may be of value to recall such past\ndeficiences as well as present shortcomings, particularly since science may\nalways be encumbered with such limitations. We can avoid serious pitfalls if we\nlet the past serve as a guide to the future. Subjects covered will include\nGodel's theorem, superconductivity, zero-point energy, the quantum and\nclassical Aharonov-Bohm and similar effects, theories of general relativity,\nMach's principle, black hole radiation, ball lightning, and the universe(s).\n","Comment: 30 pages, 0 figures"]}]
