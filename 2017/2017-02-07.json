This flux in turn\nyields the observed inhomogeneous steady-state distribution of Golgi enzymes,\nwhich compete with each other and with the SNAREs for incorporation into\ntransport vesicles. We show analytically that the steady state SNARE\nconcentration decays exponentially with the cisterna number. Numerical\nsolutions of rate equations reproduce the experimentally observed SNARE\ngradients, overlapping enzyme peaks in cis, medial and trans and the reported\nchange in vesicle nature across Golgi: Vesicles originating from younger\ncisternae mostly contain Golgi enzymes and SNAREs enriched in these cisternae\nand extensively recycle through the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), while the other\nsubpopulation of vesicles contains Golgi proteins prevalent in older cisternae\nand hardly reaches the ER.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 6 figures"]}]

Yet despite examples of complicated frequency dynamics, the\npossibility of long-term evolutionary chaos is rarely considered. The concept\nof \"survival of the fittest\" is central to much evolutionary thinking and\nembodies a perspective of evolution as a directional optimization process\nexhibiting simple, predictable dynamics. This perspective is adequate for\nsimple scenarios, when frequency-independent selection acts on scalar\nphenotypes. However, in most organisms many phenotypic properties combine in\ncomplicated ways to determine ecological interactions, and hence\nfrequency-dependent selection. Therefore, it is natural to consider models for\nthe evolutionary dynamics generated by frequency-dependent selection acting\nsimultaneously on many different phenotypes. Here we show that complicated,\nchaotic dynamics of long-term evolutionary trajectories in phenotype space is\nvery common in a large class of such models when the dimension of phenotype\nspace is large, and when there are epistatic interactions between the\nphenotypic components. Our results suggest that the perspective of evolution as\na process with simple, predictable dynamics covers only a small fragment of\nlong-term evolution.

Moreover, the\nrate of convergence is explicitly calculated in terms of the theta series,\nleading to a predictable mixing time. In order to further exploit the\nconvergence potential, a symmetric Metropolis-Klein (SMK) algorithm is\nproposed.

Moreover, the relation\nbetween QRKR and linear rotor models implies that dynamical many-body\nlocalization can exist in generic, nonintegrable many-body systems. And\nlocalization can generally result from a complicated interplay between Anderson\nmechanism and limiting integrability, since the many-body linear model is a\nhigh-angular-momentum limit of many-body QRKRs.

The suggested inequality allows\nus to assert if a particular quantum measurement, together with an appropriate\nestimator, is optimal. An adaptive strategy to estimate the value of a\nparameter, based on our modified inequality, is proposed.\n","Comment: 6 pages"]}]

As\nthe Saharan SMC shifts poleward, its mid-tropospheric divergent outflow\ndecreases, indicating a weakening of its overturning mass flux.

The mass accretion rates through the\npostulated disks cover a wide range, dM_disk/dt~4-190 Msol/yr, with most of the\nobjects (80\\%) having dM_disk/dt~10-65 Msol/yr, confirming the\nEddington-limited nature of the accretion flows.

Our sample consists of three \"FIR-bright\"\nsources, which were individually detected in previous Herschel/SPIRE\nobservations, with star formation rates of SFR>1000 M_sol/yr, and three\n\"FIR-faint\" sources for which Herschel stacking analysis implies a typical SFR\nof ~400 M_sol/yr. The dusty interstellar medium in the hosts of all six quasars\nis clearly detected in the ALMA data and resolved on scales of ~2 kpc, in both\ncontinuum (\\lambda_rest ~150 um) and [C II]157.74 um line emission. The\ncontinuum emission is in good agreement with the expectations from the Herschel\ndata, confirming the intense SF activity in the quasar hosts. Importantly, we\ndetect companion sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs) for three sources -- one\nFIR-bright and two FIR-faint, separated by ~14-45 kpc and <450 km/s from the\nquasar hosts. The [C II]-based dynamical mass estimates for the interacting\nSMGs are within a factor of ~3 of the quasar hosts' masses, while the continuum\nemission implies SFR(quasar)~(2-11)xSFR(SMG). Our ALMA data therefore clearly\nsupport the idea that major mergers are important drivers for rapid early SMBH\ngrowth. However, the fact that not all high-SFR quasar hosts are accompanied by\ninteracting SMGs and the gas kinematics as observed by ALMA suggest that other\nprocesses may be fueling these systems. Our analysis thus demonstrates the\ndiversity of host galaxy properties and gas accretion mechanisms associated\nwith early and rapid SMBH growth.\n","Comment: This version matches the one published in ApJ. 21 pages, 9 figures"]}]

In many problems like self calibration or model parameter\nidentification some states are only observable under a specific motion. These\nmotions are often hard to find, especially for inexperienced users. Therefore,\nwe consider system model identification in an active setting, where the vehicle\nautonomously decides what actions to take in order to quickly identify the\nmodel. Our algorithm approximates the belief dynamics of the system around a\ncandidate trajectory using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). It uses\nsampling-based motion planning to explore the space of possible beliefs and\nfind a maximally informative trajectory within a user-defined budget. We\nvalidate our method in simulation and on a real system showing the feasibility\nand repeatability of the proposed approach. Our planner creates trajectories\nwhich reduce model parameter convergence time and uncertainty by a factor of\nfour.\n","Comment: Published at ICRA 2017.

However, the Aldous-Hoover theorem guarantees that\nthese graphs are dense or empty with probability one, whereas many real-world\ngraphs are sparse. We present an alternative notion of exchangeability for\nrandom graphs, which we call edge exchangeability, in which the distribution of\na graph sequence is invariant to the order of the edges. We demonstrate that\nedge-exchangeable models, unlike models that are traditionally vertex\nexchangeable, can exhibit sparsity. To do so, we outline a general framework\nfor graph generative models; by contrast to the pioneering work of Caron and\nFox (2015), models within our framework are stationary across steps of the\ngraph sequence. In particular, our model grows the graph by instantiating more\nlatent atoms of a single random measure as the dataset size increases, rather\nthan adding new atoms to the measure.\n","Comment: In the proceedings of the Advances in Neural Information Processing\n  Systems 29 (NIPS), 2016.

To accommodate the typically heavy-tailed distributions of\nsingle-pulse radio flux density, the fourth-order joint cumulants of the\nelectric field are used to describe the superposition of modes with arbitrary\nprobability distributions. The framework is used to consider the distinction\nbetween superposed and disjoint modes with particular attention to the effects\nof integration over finite samples. If the interval over which the polarization\nstate is estimated is longer than the timescale for switching between two or\nmore disjoint modes of emission, then the modes are unresolved by the\ninstrument. The resulting composite sample mean exhibits properties that have\nbeen attributed to mode superposition, such as depolarization. Because the\ndistinction between disjoint modes and a composite sample of unresolved\ndisjoint modes depends on the temporal resolution of the observing\ninstrumentation, the arguments in favour of superposed modes of pulsar emission\nare revisited and observational evidence for disjoint modes is described. In\nprinciple, the four-dimensional covariance matrix that describes the\ndistribution of sample mean Stokes parameters can be used to distinguish\nbetween disjoint modes, superposed modes, and a composite sample of unresolved\ndisjoint modes. More comprehensive and conclusive interpretation of the\ncovariance matrix requires more detailed consideration of various relevant\nphenomena, including temporally correlated subpulse modulation (e.g. jitter),\nstatistical dependence between modes (e.g. covariant intensities and partial\ncoherence), and multipath propagation effects (e.g. scintillation and\nscattering).

Nevertheless, in this paper we present an algorithm that is\nable to efficiently recover certifiably globally optimal solutions of the\nspecial Euclidean synchronization problem in a non-adversarial noise regime.\nThe crux of our approach is the development of a semidefinite relaxation of the\nmaximum-likelihood estimation whose minimizer provides an exact MLE so long as\nthe magnitude of the noise corrupting the available measurements falls below a\ncertain critical threshold; furthermore, whenever exactness obtains, it is\npossible to verify this fact a posteriori, thereby certifying the optimality of\nthe recovered estimate.

A well-defined relation\nbetween A(Li) and rotation was obtained. With models constrained by the\ncharacterisation of the individual mode frequencies for single stars, we\nidentify a sequence of three SA with similar mass (~1.1Mo) and stellar ages\nranging between 1 to 9 Gyr. Within the realistic estimate of ~7% for the mass\nuncertainty, we find a good agreement between the measured A(Li) and the\npredicted A(Li) evolution from a grid of models calculated with the\nToulouse-Geneva stellar evolution code, which includes rotational internal\nmixing, calibrated to reproduce solar chemical properties. We present A(Li) for\na consistent spectroscopic survey of SA with a mass of 1.00+/-0.15Mo, and\ncharacterised through asteroseismology and surface rotation rates based on\nKepler observations. The correlation between A(Li) and P_rot supports the\ngyrochronological concept for stars younger than the Sun. The consensus between\nmeasured A(Li) for solar analogues with model grids, calibrated onto the Sun's\nchemical properties suggests that these targets share the same internal\nphysics.

If driven\nby fluctuations in the accretion rate, the variability could be isotropic. If\nrelativistic Doppler modulation dominates the periodicity, then the variability\nshould instead be anisotropic, resembling a rotating forward-beamed lighthouse.\nWe consider the infrared (IR) reverberation of either type of periodic emission\nby pc-scale circumbinary dust tori. Using toy models, we predict the phase and\namplitude of IR variability as a function of the ratio of dust light crossing\ntime to source variability period, and of the torus inclination and opening\nangle. We enumerate several differences between dust echoes of isotropically\nand anisotropically variable sources. Most importantly, for a nearly face-on\nbinary with an inclined dust torus, the Doppler boost can produce significant\nIR variability without any observable optical/UV variability. Such orphan-IR\nvariability would have been missed in existing searches for periodic AGN in\noptical surveys.

Here, we introduce a class of random spatial\nnetworks (RSNs) which generalizes many existing random network models but adds\nspatial structure. In these networks, nodes are placed randomly in space and\njoined in edges with a probability depending on their distance and their\nindividual expected degrees, in a manner that crucially remains analytically\ntractable.

A long line of work on the\nsparse FFT has resulted in algorithms with $O(k\\log n\\log (n/k))$ runtime\n[Hassanieh et al., STOC'12] and $O(k\\log n)$ sample complexity [Indyk et al.,\nFOCS'14]. These results are proved using non-adaptive algorithms, and the\nlatter $O(k\\log n)$ sample complexity result is essentially the best possible\nunder the sparsity assumption alone.\n  This paper revisits the sparse FFT problem with the added twist that the\nsparse coefficients approximately obey a $(k_0,k_1)$-block sparse model. In\nthis model, signal frequencies are clustered in $k_0$ intervals with width\n$k_1$ in Fourier space, where $k= k_0k_1$ is the total sparsity. Signals\narising in applications are often well approximated by this model with $k_0\\ll\nk$.\n  Our main result is the first sparse FFT algorithm for $(k_0, k_1)$-block\nsparse signals with the sample complexity of $O^*(k_0k_1 + k_0\\log(1+ k_0)\\log\nn)$ at constant signal-to-noise ratios, and sublinear runtime.

The grain\nstructure is idealized as a lattice of identical hexagonal cells - a honeycomb\npattern. Reactions with the environment constitute the boundary conditions and\ndrive the transport between the surfaces. Time-dependent simulations solving\nthe Poisson equation self-consistently with the Nernst-Planck flux equations\nfor the mobile species are performed. In the resulting Poisson-Nernst-Planck\nsystem of equations, the electrostatic potential is obtained from the Poisson\nequation in its integral form by summation. The model is used to interpret\nalumina membrane oxygen permeation experiments, in which different oxygen gas\npressures are applied at opposite membrane surfaces and the resulting flux of\noxygen molecules through the membrane is measured. Simulation results involving\nfour mobile species, charged aluminum and oxygen vacancies, electrons, and\nholes, provide a complete description of the measurements and insight into the\nmicroscopic processes underpinning the oxygen permeation of the membrane. Most\nnotably, the hypothesized transition between p-type and n-type ionic\nconductivity of the alumina grain boundaries as a function of the applied\noxygen gas pressure is observed in the simulations. The range of validity of a\nsimple analytic model for the oxygen permeation rate, similar to the Wagner\ntheory of metal oxidation, is quantified by comparison to the numeric\nsimulations. The three-dimensional model we develop here is readily adaptable\nto problems such as transport in a solid state electrode, or corrosion scale\ngrowth.\n"]}]

Our\napproach maps the 1-dim marginal distribution into a factorized 2-dim\ndistribution by multiplying the measured distribution or the vacuum-state\ndistribution along an orthogonal axis. The resulting fictitious Wigner function\nbecomes unphysical only for a nonclassical state, thus the negativity of the\ncorresponding density operator provides an evidence of nonclassicality.\nFurthermore, the negativity measured this way yields a lower bound for\nentanglement potential---a measure of entanglement generated using a\nnonclassical state with a beam splitter setting that is a prototypical model to\nproduce continuous-variable (CV) entangled states.

The size\nof the lattice, $L$, was varied from $128$ to $2048$, and periodic boundary\nconditions were applied along both $x$ and $y$ axes, while the length of the\n$k$-mers (determining the aspect ratio) was varied from $2$ to $12$.

This provides an expression of the\nvirtual forces in terms of general Hook's macro-parameters. Previously, MDEM\nhas been formulated through an analogy with linear elements for FEM. We show\nthe connection between MDEM and the virtual element method (VEM), which is a\ngeneralization of FEM to polyhedral grids. Unlike standard FEM, which computes\nstrain-states in a reference space, MDEM and VEM compute stress-states directly\nin real space. This connection leads us to a new derivation of the MDEM method.\nMoreover, it gives the basis for coupling (M)DEM to domain with linear\nelasticity described by polyhedral grids, which makes it easier to apply\nrealistic boundary conditions in hydraulic-fracturing simulations. This\napproach also makes it possible to combine fine-scale (M)DEM behavior near the\nfracturing region with linear elasticity on complex reservoir grids in the\nfar-field region without regridding.

In a\nsecond step, this semantics is refined to define some of its abstract features\nthat are found in many implementations of ACT-R - the abstract semantics.

Since these integral equations\nare difficult to solve analytically, an exponential upper bound for eventual\noutage probability is given using martingales. This bound guarantees that the\neventual outage probability can be made arbitrarily small simply by increasing\nthe initial battery energy. We also give an asymptotic formula for eventual\noutage. For the special case when the energy arrival follows a Poisson process,\nwe are able to find the exact formulas for the eventual outage probability.

For any given $m\\times n$ binary matrix $M$, the GM-MDS\nconjecture, proposed by Dau et al., states that if $M$ satisfies the so-called\nMDS condition, then for any field $\\mathbb{F}$ of size $q\\geq n+m-1$, there\nexists an $[n,m]_q$ MDS code whose generator matrix $G$, with entries in\n$\\mathbb{F}$, fits the matrix $M$ (i.e., $M$ is the support matrix of $G$).\nDespite all the attempts by the coding theory community, this conjecture\nremains still open in general. It was shown, independently by Yan et al. and\nDau et al., that the GM-MDS conjecture holds if the following conjecture,\nreferred to as the TM-MDS conjecture, holds: if $M$ satisfies the MDS\ncondition, then the determinant of a transform matrix $T$, such that $TV$ fits\n$M$, is not identically zero, where $V$ is a Vandermonde matrix with distinct\nparameters. In this work, we first reformulate the TM-MDS conjecture in terms\nof the Wronskian determinant, and then present an algebraic-combinatorial\napproach based on polynomial-degree reduction for proving this conjecture. Our\nproof technique's strength is based primarily on reducing inherent\ncombinatorics in the proof. We demonstrate the strength of our technique by\nproving the TM-MDS conjecture for the cases where the number of rows ($m$) of\n$M$ is upper bounded by $5$. For this class of special cases of $M$ where the\nonly additional constraint is on $m$, only cases with $m\\leq 4$ were previously\nproven theoretically, and the previously used proof techniques are not\napplicable to cases with $m > 4$.\n"]}]

The information-theoretic sum\ncapacity of MPIR $C_s^P$ is the maximum number of desired message symbols that\ncan be retrieved privately per downloaded symbol.
