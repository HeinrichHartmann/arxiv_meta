We study their high-energy signatures, focusing on\nthe role of pair-enriched bubbles produced by young magnetars, rapidly-rotating\nneutron stars, and magnetized white dwarfs. (i) First, we study the nebular\nproperties and the conditions allowing for escape of high-energy gamma-rays and\nradio waves, showing that their escape is possible for nebulae with ages of\n>10-100 yr. In the rapidly-rotating neutron star scenario, we find that radio\nemission from the quasi-steady nebula itself may be bright enough to be\ndetected especially at sub-mm frequencies, which is relevant as a possible\ncounterpart of pulsar-driven SNe and FRBs. (ii) Second, we consider the fate of\nbursting emission in the nebulae. We suggest that an impulsive burst may lead\nto a highly relativistic flow, which would interact with the nebula. If the\nshocked nebula is still relativistic, pre-existing non-thermal particles in the\nnebula can be significantly boosted by the forward shock, leading to\nshort-duration (maybe millisecond or longer) high-energy gamma-ray flashes.\nPossible dissipation at the reverse shock may also lead to gamma-ray emission.\n(iii) After such flares, interactions with the baryonic ejecta may lead to\nafterglow emission with a duration of days to weeks. In the magnetar scenario,\nthis burst-in-bubble model leads to the expectation that nearby (<10-100 Mpc)\nhigh-energy gamma-ray flashes may be detected by HAWC and CTA, and the\nsubsequent afterglow emission may be seen by radio telescopes such as VLA.

However, magnitude-based pruning of\nweights reduces a significant number of parameters from the fully connected\nlayers and may not adequately reduce the computation costs in the convolutional\nlayers due to irregular sparsity in the pruned networks. We present an\nacceleration method for CNNs, where we prune filters from CNNs that are\nidentified as having a small effect on the output accuracy. By removing whole\nfilters in the network together with their connecting feature maps, the\ncomputation costs are reduced significantly. In contrast to pruning weights,\nthis approach does not result in sparse connectivity patterns. Hence, it does\nnot need the support of sparse convolution libraries and can work with existing\nefficient BLAS libraries for dense matrix multiplications. We show that even\nsimple filter pruning techniques can reduce inference costs for VGG-16 by up to\n34% and ResNet-110 by up to 38% on CIFAR10 while regaining close to the\noriginal accuracy by retraining the networks.\n","Comment: Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017"]}]

As such, it is imperative to accurately measure and model\ninterconnect parasitic in order to predict interconnect performance on silicon.\nDespite many test structures developed in the past to characterize device\nmodels and layout effects, only few of them are available for interconnects.\nNevertheless, they are either not suitable for real chip implementation or too\ncomplicated to be embedded.

The\nsky maps and source catalogue of the HGPS allow for a systematic study of the\npopulation of TeV pulsar wind nebulae found throughout the last decade. To\ninvestigate the nature and evolution of pulsar wind nebulae, for the first time\nwe also present several upper limits for regions around pulsars without a\ndetected TeV wind nebula. Our data exhibit a correlation of TeV surface\nbrightness with pulsar spin-down power $\\dot{E}$.

We also find that the offsets of pulsars with respect to the wind\nnebula centres with ages around 10 kyr are frequently larger than can be\nplausibly explained by pulsar proper motion and could be due to an asymmetric\nenvironment. In the present data, it seems that a large pulsar offset is\ncorrelated with a high apparent TeV efficiency\n$L_{1-10\\,\\mathrm{TeV}}/\\dot{E}$. In addition to 14 HGPS sources considered as\nfirmly identified pulsar wind nebulae and 5 additional pulsar wind nebulae\ntaken from literature, we find 10 HGPS sources that form likely TeV pulsar wind\nnebula candidates. Using a model that subsumes the present common understanding\nof the very high-energy radiative evolution of pulsar wind nebulae, we find\nthat the trends and variations of the TeV observables and limits can be\nreproduced to a good level, drawing a consistent picture of present-day TeV\ndata and theory.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables.

Applying the representation languages build by these\nmodels to tasks beyond the one they were originally trained for is a field of\ninterest known as transfer learning for feature extraction. Through this\napproach, one can apply the image descriptors learnt by a CNN after processing\nmillions of images to any dataset, without an expensive training phase.\nContributions to this field have so far focused on extracting CNN features from\nlayers close to the output (e.g., fully connected layers), particularly because\nthey work better when used out-of-the-box to feed a classifier. Nevertheless,\nthe rest of CNN features is known to encode a wide variety of visual\ninformation, which could be potentially exploited on knowledge representation\nand reasoning tasks. In this paper we analyze the behavior of each feature\nindividually, exploring their intra/inter class activations for all classes of\nthree different datasets. From this study we learn that low and middle level\nfeatures behave very differently to high level features, the former being more\ndescriptive and the latter being more discriminant. We show how low and middle\nlevel features can be used for knowledge representation purposes both by their\npresence or by their absence.

Compare to prior work, our proposal possesses the\nfollowing advantages: (1) it takes user intentions and demands into account\nthrough intention mining techniques. By unearthing user intentions from the\nhistorical user-item interactions, and various user digital traces harvested\nfrom social media and Internet of Things, it is capable of delivering more\nsatisfactory recommendations by leveraging rich online and offline user data;\n(2) it embraces the benefits of embedding heterogeneous source information and\nshared representations of multiple domains to provide accurate and effective\nrecommendations comprehensively; (3) it recommends products or services\nproactively and timely by capturing the dynamic influences, which can\nsignificantly reduce user involvements and efforts.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 1 figure"]}]

In any such protocol, the transmitter and\nreceiver are in the same physical location, and the goal of such a protocol is\nto use these devices, coupled with a quantum strategy, to read out as much\ninformation as possible from a classical memory, such as a CD or DVD. In this\ncontext, a memory cell is a collection of quantum channels that can be used to\nencode a classical message in a memory. The maximum rate at which information\ncan be read out from a given memory encoded with a memory cell is called the\nquantum reading capacity of the memory cell. As a consequence of the physical\nsetup of quantum reading, the most natural and general definition for quantum\nreading capacity should allow for an adaptive operation after each call to the\nchannel, and this is how we define quantum reading capacity in this paper. In\ngeneral, an adaptive strategy can give a significant advantage over a\nnon-adaptive strategy in the context of quantum channel discrimination, and\nthis is relevant for quantum reading, due to its close connection with channel\ndiscrimination. In this paper, we provide a general definition of quantum\nreading capacity, and we establish several upper bounds on the quantum reading\ncapacity of a memory cell.

Since the\nformation energy of a charged defect depends linearly on the Fermi level,\ndoping limits can be especially pronounced in wide bandgap semiconductors where\nthe Fermi level can vary substantially. Introduction of non-equilibrium carrier\nconcentrations during growth or processing alters the chemical potentials of\nband carriers and thus provides the possibility of modifying populations of\ncharged defects in ways impossible at thermal equilibrium. Herein we\ndemonstrate that, for an ergodic system with excess carriers, the rates of\ncarrier capture and emission involving a defect charge transition level\nrigorously determine the admixture of electron and hole quasi-Fermi levels\ndetermining the formation energy of non-zero charge states of that defect type.\nTo catalog the range of possible responses to excess carriers, we investigate\nthe behavior of a single donor-like defect as functions of extrinsic doping and\nenergy of the charge transition level. The technologically most important\nfinding is that excess carriers will increase the formation energy of\ncompensating defects for most values of the charge transition level in the\nbandgap. Thus, it may be possible to overcome limitations on doping imposed by\nnative defects. Cases also exist in wide bandgap semiconductors in which the\nconcentration of defects with the same charge polarity as the majority dopant\nis either left unchanged or actually increases.

We extend this effective approach by allowing the\nLagrangian in unitary gauge to depend on the time derivative of the lapse\nfunction. Although this dependence generically signals the presence of an extra\nscalar degree of freedom, theories that contain only one propagating scalar\ndegree of freedom, in addition to the usual tensor modes, can be constructed by\nrequiring the initial Lagrangian to be degenerate. Starting from a general\nquadratic action, we derive the dispersion relations for the linear\nperturbations around Minkowski and a cosmological background. Our analysis\ndirectly applies to the recently introduced Degenerate Higher-Order\nScalar-Tensor (DHOST) theories. For these theories, we find that one cannot\nrecover a Poisson-like equation in the static linear regime except for the\nsubclass that includes the Horndeski and so-called \"beyond Horndeski\" theories.\nWe also discuss Lorentz-breaking models inspired by Horava gravity.\n"]}]

This species of fish performs burst-and-coast swimming behavior\nthat consists of sudden heading changes combined with brief accelerations\nfollowed by quasi-passive, straight decelerations. We quantify the spontaneous\nstochastic behavior of a fish and the interactions that govern wall avoidance\nand the attraction and alignment to a neighboring fish, the latter by\nexploiting general symmetry constraints for the interactions. In contrast with\nprevious experimental works, we find that both attraction and alignment\nbehaviors control the reaction of fish to a neighbor. We then exploit these\nresults to build a model of spontaneous burst-and-coast swimming and\ninteractions of fish, with all parameters being estimated or directly measured\nfrom experiments. This model quantitatively reproduces the key features of the\nmotion and spatial distributions observed in experiments with a single fish and\nwith two fish. This demonstrates the power of our method that exploits large\namounts of data for disentangling and fully characterizing the interactions\nthat govern collective behaviors in animals groups.
