Our Monte\nCarlo simulations and analysis of the residuals from scaling relations both\nindicate that sigma is more fundamental than Mstar or effective radius. In\nparticular, the Mbh-Mstar relation is mostly a consequence of the Mbh-sigma and\nsigma-Mstar relations, and is heavily biased by up to a factor of 50 at small\nmasses. This helps resolve the discrepancy between dynamically-based black\nhole-galaxy scaling relations versus those of active galaxies.

However, many objects, such as pottery sherds found in the\narchaeological record, are fragmentary, making the underlying complete designs\nunknowable at the scale of the sherd fragment. The challenge to reconstruct and\nstudy complete designs is stymied because 1) most fragmentary cultural-heritage\nobjects contain only a small portion of the underlying full design, 2) in the\ncase of a stamping application, the same design may be applied multiple times\nwith spatial overlap on one object, and 3) curve patterns detected on an object\nare usually incomplete and noisy. As a result, classical curve-pattern matching\nalgorithms, such as Chamfer matching, may perform poorly in identifying the\nunderlying design. In this paper, we develop a new partial-to-global curve\nmatching algorithm to address these challenges and better identify the full\ndesign from a fragmented cultural heritage object.

If\nno solution exists, the solver is expected to announce that no solution has\nbeen found. Owing to the complexity, type or difficulty of a constraint\nproblem, it is possible that the solver does not find a solution even though\none may exist. Thus, there may be false negatives, but there should never be\nfalse positives. Intuitively, the ability to find solutions can be considered a\nmeasure of solver's competence. We consider static constraint problems and\ntheir solvers. We do not consider dynamic constraint solvers, also known as\ndynamic geometry programs, in which specific geometric elements are moved,\ninteractively or along prescribed trajectories, while continually maintaining\nall stipulated constraints. However, if we have a solver for static constraint\nproblems that is sufficiently fast and competent, we can build a dynamic\ngeometry program from it by solving the static problem for a sufficiently dense\nsampling of the trajectory of the moving element(s). The work we survey has its\nroots in applications, especially in mechanical computer-aided design (MCAD).\nThe constraint solvers used in MCAD took a quantum leap in the 1990s.
