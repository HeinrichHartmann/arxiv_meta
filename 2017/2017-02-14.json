This is in strong contrast to the case of constant gapped 1-D\nHamiltonians, which is in NP. Moreover, it shows that unless QCMA can be\nreduced to NP by randomized reductions, there is no classical description of\nthe ground state of every poly-gapped local Hamiltonian which allows the\ncalculation of expectation values efficiently.\n  Finally, we discuss a few obstacles towards establishing an analogous result\nto the class Quantum-Merlin-Arthur (QMA).

The solution here provided holds in the case of a single\nunknown input. The first part of the work presents this analytic solution. As\nfor the observability rank condition, the proposed analytic criterion is based\non the computation of the observable codistribution. Similarly to the case of\nonly known inputs, the observable codistribution is obtained by recursively\ncomputing the Lie derivatives of the outputs along the vector fields that\ncharacterize the dynamics. However, in correspondence of the unknown input, the\ncorresponding vector field must be suitably rescaled. Additionally, the Lie\nderivatives of the outputs must also be computed along a new set of vector\nfields that are obtained by recursively performing suitable Lie bracketing of\nthe vector fields that define the dynamics. In practice, the entire observable\ncodistribution is obtained by a very simple recursive algorithm. Finally, it is\nshown that the recursive algorithm converges in a finite number of steps and\nthe criterion to establish that the convergence has been reached is provided.\nThe proposed analytic extension of the observability rank condition is\nillustrated by checking the weak local observability of several nonlinear\nsystems driven by multiple known inputs and a single unknown input.

When the network is presented\nwith natural images, the neurons in the entry layers detect edges, and the most\nactivated ones fire first, while neurons in higher layers are equipped with\nspike timing-dependent plasticity. These neurons progressively become selective\nto intermediate complexity visual features appropriate for object\ncategorization. The model is evaluated on 3D-Object and ETH-80 datasets which\nare two benchmarks for invariant object recognition, and is shown to outperform\nstate-of-the-art models, including DeepConvNet and HMAX. This demonstrates its\nability to accurately recognize different instances of multiple object classes\neven under various appearance conditions (different views, scales, tilts, and\nbackgrounds). Several statistical analysis techniques are used to show that our\nmodel extracts class specific and highly informative features.\n"]}]

When increasing bath fraction exceeds half-filling, the\nwake-mediated interaction between obstacles switches from effective attraction\nto repulsion or vice-versa, depending on the mutual alignment of obstacles with\nrespect to the gas flow. It is shown that for an ensemble of small and widely\nseparated obstacles the dissipative interaction takes the form of induced\ndipole-dipole interaction governed by an anisotropic screened Coulomb-like\npotential.

The idea is to transform\na nondeterministic-polynomial-hard ground state simulation with infinite\ndegrees of freedom into a single optimization problem of a local function with\nfinite number of physical and ancillary degrees of freedom. This work\ncontributes mainly in the following aspects: 1) AOP provides a simple and\nefficient scheme to simulate the ground state by solving a local optimization\nproblem. Its solution contains two kinds of boundary states, one of which play\nthe role of the entanglement bath that mimic the interactions between a\nsupercell and the infinite environment, and the other give the ground state in\na tensor network (TN) form. 2) In the sense of TN, a novel decomposition named\nas tensor ring decomposition (TRD) is proposed to implement AOP. Instead of\nfollowing the contraction-truncation scheme used by many existing TN-based\nalgorithms, TRD solves the contraction of a uniform TN in an opposite clue by\nencoding the contraction in a set of self-consistent equations that\nautomatically reconstruct the whole TN, making the simulation simple and\nunified; 3) AOP inherits and develops the ideas of different well-established\nmethods, including the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), infinite\ntime-evolving block decimation (iTEBD), network contractor dynamics, density\nmatrix embedding theory, and etc., providing a unified perspective that is\npreviously missing in this fields; 4) AOP as well as TRD gives novel\nimplications to existing TN-based algorithms: a modified iTEBD is suggested and\nthe 2D AOP is argued to be an intrinsic 2D extension of DMRG that is based on\ninfinite projected entangled pair state.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 11 figures"]}]

We systematically vary the concentration and the length of the\noligocation, and examine how the oligocations affects the chain conformation,\nthe static structure factor, the radial and axial distribution of various\ncharged species, and the number of bound ions in the complex. At low\noligocation concentration, the polyanion has an extended structure. Upon\nincreasing the oligocation concentration, the polyanion chain collapses and\nforms a compact globule, but the complex still carries a net negative charge.\nOnce the total charge of the oligocations is equal to that of the polyanion,\nthe collapse stops and is replaced by a slow expansion. In this regime, the net\ncharge on the complexes is positive or neutral, depending on the microion\nconcentration in solution. The expansion can be explained by the reduction of\nthe oligocation bridging. We find that the behavior and the structure of the\ncomplex are largely independent of the length of oligocations, and very similar\nto that observed when replacing the oligocations by multivalent salt cations,\nand conclude that the main driving force keeping the complex together is the\nrelease of monovalent counterions and coions.

We present detailed\ncomparisons of high- and low-Z models against different ensembles of solar\nobservables including solar neutrinos, surface helium abundance, depth of\nconvective envelope and sound speed profile. A global comparison, including all\nobservables, yields a p-value of 2.7$\\sigma$ for the high-Z model and\n4.7$\\sigma$ for the low-Z one. When the sound-speed differences in the narrow\nregion of $0.65 < r/R_{sun} < 0.70$ are excluded from the analysis, results are\n0.9$\\sigma$ and 3.0$\\sigma$ for high- and low-Z models respectively. These\nresults show that: high-Z models agree well with solar data but have a\nsystematic problem right below the bottom of the convective envelope linked to\nsteepness of molecular weight and temperature gradients, and that low-Z models\nlead to a much more general disagreement with solar data. We also show that,\nwhile simple parametrizations of opacity uncertainties can strongly alleviate\nthe solar abundance problem, they are insufficient to substantially improve the\nagreement of SSMs with helioseismic data beyond that obtained for high-Z models\ndue to the intrinsic correlations of theoretical predictions.

Then, if at certain time, say $t/2$, an experimental protocol\nreverses the many-body dynamics, it would drive the system back to the initial\nnon-equilibrium state at time $t$.

The model is solved on a\nsimple cubic lattice through a Hartree-Fock approximation, within a\n`semi-classical' framework which allows spiral magnetic modes to be stabilized.\nFor a fixed electronic density, $n_c$, the small $J$ region of the ground state\n($T=0$) phase diagram displays spiral antiferromagnetic (SAFM) states for small\n$U$. Upon increasing $U$, a state with coexistence between superconductivity\n(SC) and SAFM sets in; further increase in $U$ turns the spiral mode into a\nN\\'eel antiferromagnet. The large $J$ region is a (singlet) Kondo phase. At\nfinite temperatures, and in the region of coexistence, thermal fluctuations\nsuppress the different ordered phases in succession: the SAFM phase at lower\ntemperatures and SC at higher temperatures; also, reentrant behavior is found\nto be induced by temperature.

By embedding the meta-language\nwithin a larger programming or reasoning framework, it is possible to absorb\nthe treatment of binding structure in the object language into the meta-theory\nof the system, thereby greatly simplifying the overall implementation and\nreasoning processes.\n  We develop the above argument in this thesis by presenting and demonstrating\nthe effectiveness of an approach to the verified implementation of compiler\ntransformations for functional programs that exploits HOAS. In this approach,\ntransformations on functional programs are first articulated in the form of\nrule-based relational specifications. These specifications are rendered into\nprograms in the language lambda Prolog. On the one hand, these programs serve\ndirectly as implementations. On the other hand, they can be used as input to\nthe Abella system which allows us to prove properties about them and thereby\nabout the implementations. Both lambda Prolog and Abella support the use of the\nHOAS approach. Thus, they constitute a framework that can be used to test out\nthe benefits of the HOAS approach in verified compilation. We use them to\nimplement and verify a compiler for a representative functional programming\nlanguage that embodies the transformations that form the core of many compilers\nfor such languages.

The ratio of the observed intensity of\nthe 3.3 $\\mu$m aromatic C--H feature ($I_{3.3}$) to that of the 3.4 $\\mu$m\naliphatic C--H feature ($I_{3.4}$) allows one to estimate the aliphatic\nfraction (i.e. $N_{\\rm C,aliph}/N_{\\rm C,arom}$, the number of C atoms in\naliphatic units to that in aromatic rings) of the UIE carriers, provided the\nintrinsic oscillator strengths of the 3.3 $\\mu$m aromatic C--H stretch\n($A_{3.3}$) and the 3.4 $\\mu$m aliphatic C--H stretch ($A_{3.4}$) are known.\n  In this article we summarize the computational results on $A_{3.3}$ and\n$A_{3.4}$ and their implications for the aromaticity and aliphaticity of the\nUIE carriers. We use density functional theory and second-order perturbation\ntheory to derive $A_{3.3}$ and $A_{3.4}$ from the infrared vibrational spectra\nof seven PAHs with various aliphatic substituents (e.g., methyl-, dimethyl-,\nethyl-, propyl-, butyl-PAHs, and PAHs with unsaturated alkyl-chains). The mean\nband strengths of the aromatic ($A_{3.3}$) and aliphatic ($A_{3.4}$) C--H\nstretches are derived and then employed to estimate the aliphatic fraction of\nthe UIE carriers by comparing $A_{3.4}$/$A_{3.3}$ with $I_{3.4}$/$I_{3.3}$. We\nconclude that the UIE emitters are predominantly aromatic, as revealed by the\nobservationally-derived ratio <$I_{3.4}$/$I_{3.3}$> ~ 0.12 and the\ncomputationally-derived ratio <$A_{3.4}$/$A_{3.3}$> ~ 1.76 which suggest an\nupper limit of $N_{\\rm C,aliph}/N_{\\rm C,arom}$ ~ 0.02 for the aliphatic\nfraction of the UIE carriers.\n","Comment: 67 pages, 18 figures, 8 tables; invited article accepted for\n  publication in \"New Astronomy Review\"; a considerable fraction of this\n  article is concerned with the computational techniques and results, readers\n  who are mainly interested in astrophysics may wish to only read\n  \"Introduction\", and \"Astrophysical Implications\""]}]

A popular approach to entity extraction is based\non matching sub-string candidates in a document against a dictionary of\nentities. To handle spelling errors and name variations of entities, usually\nthe matching is approximate and edit or Jaccard distance is used to measure\ndissimilarity between sub-string candidates and the entities. For approximate\nentity extraction from free text, existing work considers solely\ncharacter-based or solely token-based similarity and hence cannot\nsimultaneously deal with minor variations at token level and typos. In this\npaper, we address this problem by considering both character-based similarity\nand token-based similarity (i.e. two-level similarity). Measuring one-level\n(e.g. character-based) similarity is computationally expensive, and measuring\ntwo-level similarity is dramatically more expensive. By exploiting the\nproperties of the two-level similarity and the weights of tokens, we develop\nnovel techniques to significantly reduce the number of sub-string candidates\nthat require computation of two-level similarity against the dictionary of\nentities.

The basic concept is to use\none magnet system with a strong and homogeneous (dipolar) magnetic field to\nmagnetize and orient the particles. A second constantly graded field\n(quadrupolar) is superimposed to the first to generate a force. In this\nconfiguration the motion of the particles is driven solely by the component of\nthe gradient field which is parallel to the direction of the homogeneous field.\nThen the particles are guided with constant force in a single direction over\nthe entire volume. The direction can be adjusted by varying the angle between\nquadrupole and dipole. Since a single gradient is impossible, the other\ngradient component determines the angular deviation of the force. The latter\ncan be neglected if the homogeneous field is stronger than the local\ncontribution of the gradient field. A possible realization is a coaxial\narrangement of two Halbach cylinders. A dipole produces a strong and\nhomogeneous field to evenly magnetize the particles, while the second cylinder\nis a quadrupole to generate the force. A simple prototype was constructed to\ndemonstrate the principle on several nano-particles, which were moved along a\nrough square by manually changing the force angle. The observed velocities of\nparticles were always several orders of magnitude higher than the theoretical\nvalue. This discrepancy is attributed to the observed formation of long\nparticle chains as a result of their polarization by the homogeneous field.

By adding\nrestrictions on the training rules, the learned weight matrix of FBNN is\nband-limited and sorted by frequency, similar to the normal filter bank. Unlike\nthe manually designed filter bank, the learned filter bank has different filter\nshapes in different channels, which can capture the differences between natural\nand synthetic speech more effectively. The experimental results on the ASVspoof\n{2015} database show that the Gaussian mixture model maximum-likelihood\n(GMM-ML) classifier trained by the new feature performs better than the\nstate-of-the-art linear frequency cepstral coefficients (LFCC) based\nclassifier, especially on detecting unknown attacks.\n"]}]

Obtaining\nnumerical predictions from hydrodynamical simulations of expected survey\nvolumes is expensive, and a cheaper alternative relies on populating large dark\nmatter-only simulations with accurate models of alignments calibrated on\nsmaller hydrodynamical runs. This requires connecting the shapes and\norientations of galaxies to those of dark matter halos and to the large-scale\nstructure. In this paper, we characterise galaxy-halo alignments in the\nHorizon-AGN cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. We compare the shapes and\norientations of galaxies in the redshift range $0<z<3$ to those of their\nembedding dark matter halos, and to the matching halos of a twin dark-matter\nonly run with identical initial conditions. We find that galaxy ellipticities\nin general cannot be predicted directly from halo ellipticities. The mean\nmisalignment angle between the minor axis of a galaxy and its embedding halo is\na function of halo mass, with residuals arising from the dependence of\nalignment on galaxy type, but not on environment. Halos are much more strongly\naligned among themselves than galaxies, and they decrease their alignment\ntowards low redshift. Galaxy alignments compete with this effect, as galaxies\ntend to increase their alignment with halos towards low redshift. We discuss\nthe implications of these results for current halo models of intrinsic\nalignments and suggest several avenues for improvement.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 22 figures"]}]
