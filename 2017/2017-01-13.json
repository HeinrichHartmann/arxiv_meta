Our proposed template is obtained\nby fitting the post-merger waveform part of several publicly available\nnumerical relativity simulations from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS)\ncatalog and then suitably interpolating over (symmetric) mass ratio and spins.\nWe show that this analytic expression accurately reproduces ($\\sim$~0.01 rad)\nthe phasing of the post-merger data of other datasets not used in its\nconstruction. This is notably the case of the spin-aligned run SXS:BBH:0305,\nwhose intrinsic parameters are consistent with the 90\\% credible intervals\nreported by the parameter-estimation followup of GW150914 in Phys.

Using SXS waveforms as \"experimental\" data, we\nfurther show that our template could be used on the actual GW150914 data to\nperform a new measure the complex frequency of the fundamental quasi-normal\nmode so to exploit the complete (high signal-to-noise-ratio) post-merger\nwaveform.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Phys.

This test is not rigorous,\nhowever, without good bounds on the mixing time of the Markov chain, as one\nmust argue that the observed states on the trajectory approximate the\nstationary distribution.\n  Our test is the following: given the presented state in the Markov chain,\ntake a random walk from the presented state for any number of steps. We prove\nthat observing that the presented state is an $\\varepsilon$-outlier on the walk\nis significant at $p=\\sqrt {2\\varepsilon}$, under the null hypothesis that the\nstate was chosen from a stationary distribution. Our result assumes nothing\nabout the structure of the Markov chain beyond reversibility, and we construct\nexamples to show that significance at $p\\approx\\sqrt \\varepsilon$ is\nessentially best possible in general. We illustrate the use of our test with a\npotential application to the rigorous detection of gerrymandering in\nCongressional districtings.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 3 figures"]}]

Our results provide a useful yardstick against which other\napproximate methods and/or experimental studies of relevant antiferromagnetic\nsquare-lattice compounds may now compare their own results.

Important examples include gene expression and enzymatic processes in\nliving cells. Such systems are typically modelled as chemical reaction networks\nwhose dynamics are governed by the Chemical Master Equation. Despite its simple\nstructure, no analytic solutions to the Chemical Master Equation are known for\nmost systems. Moreover, stochastic simulations are computationally expensive,\nmaking systematic analysis and statistical inference a challenging task.\nConsequently, significant effort has been spent in recent decades on the\ndevelopment of efficient approximation and inference methods. This article\ngives an introduction to basic modelling concepts as well as an overview of\nstate of the art methods. First, we motivate and introduce deterministic and\nstochastic methods for modelling chemical networks, and give an overview of\nsimulation and exact solution methods. Next, we discuss several approximation\nmethods, including the chemical Langevin equation, the system size expansion,\nmoment closure approximations, time-scale separation approximations and hybrid\nmethods. We discuss their various properties and review recent advances and\nremaining challenges for these methods. We present a comparison of several of\nthese methods by means of a numerical case study and highlight some of their\nrespective advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we discuss the problem of\ninference from experimental data in the Bayesian framework and review recent\nmethods developed the literature.

To place an ad automatically and optimally,\nit is critical for advertisers to devise a learning algorithm to cleverly bid\nan ad impression in real-time. Most previous works consider the bid decision as\na static optimization problem of either treating the value of each impression\nindependently or setting a bid price to each segment of ad volume. However, the\nbidding for a given ad campaign would repeatedly happen during its life span\nbefore the budget runs out. As such, each bid is strategically correlated by\nthe constrained budget and the overall effectiveness of the campaign (e.g., the\nrewards from generated clicks), which is only observed after the campaign has\ncompleted. Thus, it is of great interest to devise an optimal bidding strategy\nsequentially so that the campaign budget can be dynamically allocated across\nall the available impressions on the basis of both the immediate and future\nrewards. In this paper, we formulate the bid decision process as a\nreinforcement learning problem, where the state space is represented by the\nauction information and the campaign's real-time parameters, while an action is\nthe bid price to set.

Let the received signal\nfirst go through a carefully designed beamforming network, which could separate\nmultiple CFOs in the spatial domain with sufficient number of receive antennas.\nA joint estimation method for the Doppler shifts and the OFO is further\ndeveloped. Then the conventional single-CFO compensation and channel estimation\nmethod can be carried out for each beamforming branch. The proposed receiver\ndesign avoids the complicated time-varying channel estimation, which differs a\nlot from the conventional methods. More importantly, the proposed scheme can be\napplied to the commonly used time-varying channel models, such as the Jakes'\nchannel model.\n"]}]

In this paper, customers are assumed to\nmake decisions that pertain to reactive power coordination. In consequence, the\nway in which those customers evaluate the compensation value resulting from\ntheir individual decisions will impact the overall grid performance. In\nparticular, a behavioral framework, based on the framing effect of prospect\ntheory (PT), is developed to study the effect of both objective value and\nsubjective evaluation in a reactive power compensation game.

For the proposed game, both the objective case\nusing expected utility theory (EUT) and the PT consideration are solved via a\nlearning algorithm that converges to a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. In\naddition, several key properties of this game are derived analytically.\nSimulation results show that, under PT, customers are likely to make decisions\nthat differ from those predicted by classical models. For instance, using an\nillustrative two-customer case, we show that a PT customer will increase the\nconservative strategy (achieving a high power factor) by 29% compared to a\nconventional customer.

On the other hand, variational QMC can provide\nBorn-Oppenheimer (BO) potential energy surfaces with a precision comparable to\nthe most advanced post Hartree-Fock approaches, and with a favorable scaling\nwith the system size.

The variational parameters of the QMC\nwave function are evolved during the nuclear dynamics, such that the BO\npotential energy surface is unbiased. Statistical errors on the wave function\nparameters are reduced by resorting to bead grouping average, which we show to\nbe accurate and well controlled.

Under certain conditions, the superiorized\nalgorithm is guaranteed to find a solution that is as satisfactory as any found\nby the original algorithm with respect to satisfying the constraints of the\nproblem; this solution is also expected to be superior with respect to the\nchosen objective.\n  Most work on superiorization has used reconstruction algorithms which assume\na linear measurement model, which in the case of CT corresponds to data\ngenerated from a monoenergetic X-ray beam. Many CT systems generate X-rays from\na polyenergetic spectrum, however, in which the measured data represent an\nintegral of object attenuation over all energies in the spectrum.

The vortices are effectively planar and\ndescribed by the winding number and the \"flavor\" index, stemming from the fact\nthat we have two parallel beams propagating in opposite directions. The problem\nis amenable to the methods of statistical field theory and generalizes the\nBerezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of the XY model to the \"two-flavor\"\ncase. In addition to the familiar conductor and insulator phases, we also have\nthe perfect conductor (vortex proliferation in both beams/\"flavors\") and the\nfrustrated insulator (energy costs of vortex proliferation and vortex\nannihilation balance each other). In the presence of disorder in the background\nlattice, a novel phase appears which shows long-range correlations and absence\nof long-range order, thus being analogous to spin glasses. An important benefit\nof this approach is that qualitative behavior of patterns can be known without\nintensive numerical work over large areas of the parameter space. More\ngenerally, we would like to draw attention to connections between the\n(classical) pattern-forming systems in photorefractive optics and the methods\nof (quantum) condensed matter and field theory: on one hand, we use the\nfield-theoretical methods (renormalization group, replica formalism) to analyze\nthe patterns; on the other hand, the observed phases are analogous to those\nseen in magnetic systems, and make photorefractive optics a fruitful testing\nground for condensed matter systems.
