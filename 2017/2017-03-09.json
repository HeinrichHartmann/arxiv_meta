In the Kerr black hole,\ncomplications arise due to the absence of a global timelike Killing field and\nthe presence of the ergosphere. Nevertheless, it is possible to calculate the\nentropy of a thin shell of matter field in the near-horizon region using the\nbrick wall model. The corresponding leading order entropy of the\nnonsuperradiant modes is found to be proportional to the area of the horizon\nand is logarithmically divergent. Thus, the entropy of a three dimensional\nsystem in the near-horizon region is proportional to the boundary surface. This\nis similar to that of the black hole entropy itself. The corresponding internal\nenergy remains finite if the entropy is chosen to be of the order of the black\nhole entropy itself.

The galaxy sits near\nthe expected main sequence of star-forming galaxies at those redshifts, and\nresembles moderately star-forming systems observed at $z>5$. The high specific\nstar formation rate results in vigorous heating and stirring of the gas by\nsupernovae feedback, and the galaxy develops a thick and turbulent disc, with\ngas velocity dispersion $\\sim 40$ km s$^{-1}$, rotation to dispersion ratio\n$\\sim 2$, and with a significant amount of gas at $\\sim 10^5$ K. The Toomre\nparameter always exceeds the critical value for gravito-turbulence, $Q\\sim\n1.5-2$, mainly due to the contribution of warm/hot gas inside the disc. Without\nfeedback, a nearly gravito-turbulent regime establishes with similar gas\nvelocity dispersion and lower $Q$. We propose that the \"hot and turbulent\" disc\nregime seen in our simulations, unlike the \"cold and turbulent\"\ngravito-turbulent regime of massive clumpy disc galaxies at $z\\sim 1-2$, is a\nfundamental characterisation of main sequence galaxies at $z\\gtrsim 6$, as they\ncan sustain star formation rates comparable to those of low-mass starbursts at\n$z=0$. This results in no sustained coherent gas inflows through the disc, and\nin fluctuating and anisotropic mass transport, possibly postponing the assembly\nof the bulge and causing the initial feeding of the central black hole to be\nhighly intermittent.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 18 figures, 1 table, MNRAS accepted, mistakes in figures\n  corrected, results unchanged"]}]

Originally motivated by pursuing a\ntheoretical understanding of the maximum correntropy criterion based regression\n(MCCR), our study reveals that MCCR with a tending-to-zero scale parameter is\nessentially modal regression. We show that nonparametric modal regression\nproblem can be approached via the classical empirical risk minimization. Some\nefforts are then made to develop a framework for analyzing and implementing\nmodal regression. For instance, the modal regression function is described, the\nmodal regression risk is defined explicitly and its \\textit{Bayes} rule is\ncharacterized; for the sake of computational tractability, the surrogate modal\nregression risk, which is termed as the generalization risk in our study, is\nintroduced. On the theoretical side, the excess modal regression risk, the\nexcess generalization risk, the function estimation error, and the relations\namong the above three quantities are studied rigorously. It turns out that\nunder mild conditions, function estimation consistency and convergence may be\npursued in modal regression as in vanilla regression protocols, such as mean\nregression, median regression, and quantile regression. However, it outperforms\nthese regression models in terms of robustness as shown in our study from a\nre-descending M-estimation view. This coincides with and in return explains the\nmerits of MCCR on robustness. On the practical side, the implementation issues\nof modal regression including the computational algorithm and the tuning\nparameters selection are discussed.

This equivalence also permits to determine the p->q\nnorms of the aforementioned quantum-classical channel, and prove that they are\nachieved by thermal Gaussian states. The same equivalence permits to prove that\nthe Husimi Q representation of a passive state (i.e. a state diagonal in the\nFock basis with eigenvalues decreasing as the energy increases) majorizes the\nHusimi Q representation of any other state with the same spectrum, i.e. it\nmaximizes any convex functional.\n"]}]

We investigate the impact of several physical quantities on the\nuncertainty of the analysis method, which is used to derive the line-of-sight\n(LOS) magnetic field strength from Zeeman split spectral lines.\n  Methods. We simulate the Zeeman splitting of the 1665 MHz OH line with the 3D\nradiative transfer (RT) extension ZRAD.

Observations of the OH Zeeman effect in typical molecular clouds are\nnot significantly affected by the uncertainty of the analysis method. We\nderived an approximation to quantify the range of parameters in which the\nanalysis method works sufficiently accurate and provide factors to convert our\nresults to other spectral lines and species as well.

The mechanism of disk formation around fast-rotating Be stars is not\nwell understood. In particular, it is not clear which mechanisms operate, in\naddition to fast rotation, to produce the observed variable ejection of matter.\nThe star Achernar is a privileged laboratory to probe these additional\nmechanisms because it is close, presents B-Be phase variations on timescales\nranging from 6 yr to 15 yr, a companion star was discovered around it, and\nprobably presents a polar wind or jet. Aims. Despite all these previous\nstudies, the disk around Achernar was never directly imaged. Therefore we seek\nto produce an image of the photosphere and close environment of the star.\nMethods. We used infrared long-baseline interferometry with the PIONIER/VLTI\ninstrument to produce reconstructed images of the photosphere and close\nenvironment of the star over four years of observations. To study the disk\nformation, we compared the observations and reconstructed images to previously\ncomputed models of both the stellar photosphere alone (normal B phase) and the\nstar presenting a circumstellar disk (Be phase). Results. The observations\ntaken in 2011 and 2012, during the quiescent phase of Achernar, do not exhibit\na disk at the detection limit of the instrument. In 2014, on the other hand, a\ndisk was already formed and our reconstructed image reveals an extended H-band\ncontinuum excess flux. Our results from interferometric imaging are also\nsupported by several H-alpha line profiles showing that Achernar started an\nemission-line phase sometime in the beginning of 2013. The analysis of our\nreconstructed images shows that the 2014 near-IR flux extends to 1.7 - 2.3\nequatorial radii. Our model-independent size estimation of the H-band continuum\ncontribution is compatible with the presence of a circumstellar disk, which is\nin good agreement with predictions from Be-disk models.\n"]}]

Cool clouds form in equilibrium with the warm phase of the wind\nbecause the rapidly varying X-ray quasar continuum changes the force\nmultiplier, causing pressure waves to move gas into stable locations in\npressure-temperature space. The narrow range of 2-phase equilibrium densities\nmay explain the scaling of the BELR size with the square root of luminosity,\nwhile the scaling of cloud formation timescales could produce the Baldwin\neffect. These dense clouds have force multipliers of order unity and so cannot\nbe accelerated to escape velocity.

In order to achieve that, we employ a number\nof nonlinear gauge-invariant constraints which only affect the superheavy\ndegrees of freedom. We illustrate our considerations in a model based on the\nSU(5) group, with the generalization to other groups being straightforward. We\ndiscuss how scale or conformal invariance may be added to our proposal.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 2 figures"]}]

In this work we propose a framework\nto study these questions, based on the assumption that the $m$ experts have\nuncorrelated deviations from the optimal predictor. Assuming the first two\nmoments of the response are known, we develop methods to detect the best and\nworst regressors, and derive U-PCR, a novel principal components approach for\nunsupervised ensemble regression.
