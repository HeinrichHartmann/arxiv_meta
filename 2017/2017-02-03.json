To circumvent that problem, we propose two new\nselection criteria, namely: the bootstrapped likelihood quasi-CV (BQCV) and its\n632QCV variant. We use Monte Carlo simulation to compare the finite sample\nperformances of the two proposed criteria to those of the AIC and its\nvariations that use the bootstrapped log-likelihood in the class of varying\ndispersion beta regressions. The numerical evidence shows that the proposed\nmodel selection criteria perform well in small samples.

Key features of\ncombinatorial Dyson-Schwinger equations are revealed to follow from general\ncategorical constructions and universal properties. Rather than beginning with\nan equation inside a given Hopf algebra and referring to given Hochschild\n$1$-cocycles, our starting point is an abstract fixpoint equation in groupoids,\nshown canonically to generate all the algebraic structure. Precisely, for any\nfinitary polynomial endofunctor $P$ defined over groupoids, the system of\ncombinatorial Dyson-Schwinger equations $X=1+P(X)$ has a universal solution,\nnamely the groupoid of $P$-trees. The isoclasses of $P$-trees generate\nnaturally a Connes-Kreimer-like bialgebra, in which the abstract\nDyson-Schwinger equation can be internalised in terms of canonical\n$B_+$-operators. The solution to this equation is a series (the Green function)\nwhich always enjoys a Fa\\`a di Bruno formula, and hence generates a\nsub-bialgebra isomorphic to the Fa\\`a di Bruno bialgebra. Varying $P$ yields\ndifferent bialgebras, and cartesian natural transformations between various $P$\nyield bialgebra homomorphisms and sub-bialgebras, corresponding for example to\ntruncation of Dyson-Schwinger equations. Finally, all constructions can be\npushed inside the classical Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of trees by the\noperation of taking core of $P$-trees. A byproduct of the theory is an\ninterpretation of combinatorial Green functions as inductive data types in the\nsense of Martin-L\\\"of Type Theory (expounded elsewhere).\n","Comment: v4: minor adjustments, 49pp, final version to appear in J.

For reasons of simplicity and conceptual clarity, we focus on the\ncase in which only electrically neutral species are present in the solution and\non chemical reactions which are described by first order kinetics. Within a\nself-consistent approach we explicitly determine the steady state product and\nreactant number density fields around the colloid as functionals of the\ninteraction potentials of the various molecular species in solution with the\ncolloid. By using Teubner's reciprocal theorem, this allows us to compute and\nto interpret -- in a transparent way in terms of the classical Smoluchowski\ntheory of chemical kinetics -- the external force needed to keep such a\ncatalytically active colloid at rest (\\textit{stall} force) or, equivalently,\nthe corresponding velocity of the colloid \\textit{if} it is free to move. We\nuse the particular case of triangular-well interaction potentials as a\nbenchmark example for applying the general theoretical framework developed\nhere. For this latter case, we derive explicit expressions for the dependences\nof the quantities of interest on the diffusion coefficients of the chemical\nspecies, the reaction rate constant, the coverage by catalyst, the size of the\ncolloid, as well as on the parameters of the interaction potentials. These\nexpressions provide a detailed picture of the phenomenology associated with\ncatalytically-active colloids and self-diffusiophoresis.\n","Comment: 63 pages, 5 figures"]}]

The only caveat is the case where the particle mass is larger\nthan the bounce energy scale.

Three of the point sources (A,B,D) have\nSEDs compatible with the discovery quasar spectra, while the faintest\npoint-like image (G2/C) shows significant reddening and a `grey' dimming of\n$\\approx0.8$mag. In order to understand the lens configuration, we fit\ndifferent models to the relative positions of A,B,D. Models with just a single\ndeflector predict a fourth image at the location of G2/C but considerably\nbrighter and bluer. The addition of a small satellite galaxy ($R_{\\rm\nE}\\approx0.2$\") in the lens plane near the position of G2/C suppresses the flux\nof the fourth image and can explain both the reddening and grey dimming.

We give some new\nconnections between these two problems and their variants.\n  In 1897, Stickelberger proved that if a polynomial has an odd number of even\ndegree factors, then its discriminant is a quadratic nonresidue in the field.\nWe give an extension of Stickelberger's Lemma; we construct $r$-th nonresidues\nfrom a polynomial $f$ for which there is a $d$, such that, $r|d$ and\n$r\\nmid\\,$#(irreducible factor of $f(x)$ of degree $d$). Our theorem has the\nfollowing interesting consequences: (1) we can construct $\\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$ in\ndeterministic poly(deg($f$),$m\\log q$)-time if $m$ is an $r$-power and $f$ is\nknown; (2) we can find $r$-th roots in $\\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$ in deterministic\npoly($m\\log p$)-time if $r$ is constant and $r|\\gcd(m,p-1)$.\n  We also discuss a conjecture significantly weaker than the Generalized\nRiemann hypothesis to get a deterministic poly-time algorithm for $r$-th root\nfinding.\n","Comment: 16 pages"]}]

An alternative theory of\ndependency resolution difficulty is the direct-access model (McElree et al.,\n2003); this model assumes that retrieval times are a mixture of two\ndistributions: one distribution represents successful retrieval and the other\nrepresents an initial failure to retrieve the correct dependent, followed by a\nreanalysis that leads to successful retrieval. The time needed for a successful\nretrieval is independent of the dependency distance (cf. the distance-based\naccount), but reanalyses cost extra time, and the proportion of failures\nincreases with increasing dependency distance. We implemented a series of\nincreasingly complex hierarchical Bayesian models to compare the distance-based\naccount and the direct-access model; the latter was implemented as a\nhierarchical finite mixture model with heterogeneous variances for the two\nmixture distributions.

In\nparticular, we show that one of our proposed DNNs is more accurate than the\ncurrent best algorithm for automatic localization of landmarks on hawkmoth\nvideos. Moreover, we demonstrate how these annotations can be used to\nquantitatively analyze the 3D flight of a hawkmoth. To facilitate the use of\nDNNs by scientists from many different fields, we provide a self contained\nexplanation of what DNNs are, how they work, and how to apply them to other\ndatasets using the freely available library Caffe and supplemental code that we\nprovide.\n","Comment: 30 pages"]}]

Their conceptual simplicity has\nfor several decades offered an unprecedented window into nonlinear cavity\ndynamics, providing insights into numerous systems and applications ranging\nfrom all-optical memory devices to microresonator frequency combs. Yet despite\nthe decades of study, a recent theoretical study has surprisingly alluded to an\nentirely new and unexplored paradigm in the regime where nonlinearly tilted\ncavity resonances overlap with one another [T. Hansson and S. Wabnitz, J. Opt.\nSoc. Am. B 32, 1259 (2015)]. We have used synchronously driven fiber ring\nresonators to experimentally access this regime, and observed the rise of new\nnonlinear dissipative states. Specifically, we have observed, for the first\ntime to the best of our knowledge, the stable coexistence of dissipative\n(cavity) solitons and extended modulation instability (Turing) patterns, and\nperformed real time measurements that unveil the dynamics of the ensuing\nnonlinear structures. When operating in the regime of continuous wave\ntristability, we have further observed the coexistence of two distinct cavity\nsoliton states, one of which can be identified as a \"super\" cavity soliton as\npredicted by Hansson and Wabnitz. Our experimental findings are in excellent\nagreement with theoretical analyses and numerical simulations of the\ninfinite-dimensional Ikeda map that governs the cavity dynamics. The results\nfrom our work reveal that experimental systems can support complex combinations\nof distinct nonlinear states, and they could have practical implications to\nfuture microresonator-based frequency comb sources.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 6 figures"]}]
