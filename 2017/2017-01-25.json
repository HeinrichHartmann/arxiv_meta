Specifically, we\nconsider a setting in which k identical (probabilistic) agents, initially\nplaced at some central location, collectively search for a treasure in the\ntwo-dimensional plane. The treasure is placed at a target location by an\nadversary and the goal is to find it as fast as possible as a function of both\nk and D, where D is the distance between the central location and the target.\nThis is biologically motivated by cooperative, central place foraging such as\nperformed by ants around their nest. In this type of search there is a strong\npreference to locate nearby food sources before those that are further away.\nOur focus is on trying to find what can be achieved if communication is limited\nor altogether absent. Indeed, to avoid overlaps agents must be highly dispersed\nmaking communication difficult. Furthermore, if agents do not commence the\nsearch in synchrony then even initial communication is problematic. This holds,\nin particular, with respect to the question of whether the agents can\ncommunicate and conclude their total number, k. It turns out that the knowledge\nof k by the individual agents is crucial for performance. Indeed, it is a\nstraightforward observation that the time required for finding the treasure is\n$\\Omega$(D + D 2 /k), and we show in this paper that this bound can be matched\nif the agents have knowledge of k up to some constant approximation. We present\nan almost tight bound for the competitive penalty that must be paid, in the\nrunning time, if agents have no information about k.

A graph has the constant\ncontainment property if there is an integer $n$ such that it has the\n$n$-containment property.

Unfortunately, direct\nmeasurements of O/H in the neutral gas are extremely difficult to obtain as the\nonly OI line available within the HST UV wavelength range (1150-3200A) is often\nsaturated. As such, proxies for oxygen are needed to indirectly derive an O/H\nvia the assumption that solar ratios based on local Milky Way sight lines hold\nin different environments. In this paper we assess the validity of using two\nsuch proxies, PII and SII within more typical star-forming environments. Using\nHST-COS FUV spectra of a sample of nearby star-forming galaxies and the oxygen\nabundances in their ionized gas, we demonstrate that both P and S are mildly\ndepleted with respect to O and follow a trend, log(PII/SII)=-1.73+/-0.18, in\nexcellent agreement with the solar ratio of log(P/S)_sol=-1.71+/-0.04 over the\nlarge range of metallicities (0.03-3.2 Zsol) and HI column densities\n(log[N(HI)/cm^-2]=18.44-21.28) spanned by the sample. From literature data we\nshow evidence that both elements individually trace oxygen according to their\nrespective solar ratios across a wide range of environments. Our findings\ndemonstrate that the solar ratios of log(P/O)_sol=-3.28+/-0.06 and\nlog(S/O)_sol=-1.57+/-0.06 can both be used to derive reliable O/H abundances in\nthe neutral gas of local and high-redshift star-forming galaxies. The trends in\nthe difference between O/H in the ionized- and neutral-gas phases versus\nmetallicity and HI, content are consistent with primordial gas accretion, with\ngalactic outflows and/or star-formation inefficiency also playing a role in the\nmost metal-poor galaxies.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 3 figures, submitted to MNRAS"]}]

Since the majority of\nthe mass density is in the form of dark matter that cannot be directly\nobserved, to do cosmology with large-scale structure one must use observable\n(baryonic) quantities that trace the underlying matter distribution in a\n(hopefully) predictable way. However, recent numerical studies have\ndemonstrated that the mapping between observable and total mass, as well as the\ntotal mass itself, are sensitive to unresolved feedback processes associated\nwith galaxy formation, motivating explicit calibration of the feedback\nefficiencies.

Three validations are described: (1) Prediction\ncorrelation performed well on simulated data where the ground truth was known,\nand outperformed four other methods. (2) On simulated data designed to display\nthe \"common driver\" problem, prediction correlation did not introduce false\nconnections between non-interacting driven ROIs.

Dust and\ngas (self-)shielding is followed to compute the chemical state of the gas with\na chemical network. We find that stellar winds can regulate star (cluster)\nformation. Since the winds suppress the accretion of fresh gas soon after the\ncluster has formed, they lead to clusters which have lower average masses\n(10$^2$ - 10$^{4.3}$ M$_{\\odot}$) and form on shorter timescales (10$^{-3}$ -\n10 Myr). In particular we find an anti-correlation of cluster mass and\naccretion time scale. Without winds the star clusters easily grow to larger\nmasses for ~5 Myr until the first supernova explodes. Overall the most massive\nstars provide the most wind energy input, while objects beginning their\nevolution as B-type stars contribute most of the supernova energy input. A\nsignificant outflow from the disk (mass loading $\\gtrsim$ 1 at 1 kpc) can be\nlaunched by thermal gas pressure if more than 50% of the volume near the disc\nmid-plane can be heated to T > 3x10$^5$ K.

First, we study a\nsuperthin, LSB galaxy UGC 7321 and show that it does not support discrete\nglobal spiral modes when modeled as a disk-alone system or as a disk plus dark\nmatter system. Even a moderate increase in the stellar central surface density\ndoes not yield any global spiral modes. This naturally explains the observed\nlack of strong large-scale spiral structure in LSBs. An earlier work (Ghosh,\nSaini & Jog, 2016) where the galactic disk was treated as a fluid system for\nsimplicity had shown that the dominant halo could not arrest global modes. We\nfound that this difference arises due to the different dispersion relation used\nin the two cases and which plays a crucial role in the search for global spiral\nmodes. Thus the correct treatment of stars as a collisionless system as done\nhere results in the suppression of global spiral modes, in agreement with the\nobservations.

Our results are compared to the nonrelativistic formulations\nexisting in the literature and a number of discrepancies are found. In\nparticular, it is shown that, generally, the electric displacement ${\\pmb D}$\ndoes not coincide with the electric field ${\\pmb E}$, contrary to what is\nstated in the previous works. The relativistic framework developed here is\neasily extendable to account for more sophisticated microphysics models and it\nprovides the necessary basis for realistic modelling of neutron stars.\n","Comment: 39 pages, submitted to PRD, minor changes to match published version"]}]

Independent of\nthe continuum adopted, in all three cases a column density of a few $10^{23}$\ncm$^{-2}$ of neutral gas covering 20-40\\% of the continuum source is required\nby the data. Most interestingly, absorption structures due to highly ionised\niron have been detected in both observations with a redshift of about $0.1c$\nwith respect to the systemic redshift of the host galaxy. The redshifted\nabsorber can be ascribed to a failed wind/aborted jets component, to\ngravitational redshift effects, and/or to matter directly falling towards the\ncentral supermassive black hole. In either case, we are probing the innermost\naccretion flow around the central supermassive black hole of NGC 2617 and might\nbe even watching matter in a direct inflow towards the black hole itself.\n","Comment: Replaced to match the published version"]}]

By contrast, CR diffusion\nconserves the CR energy in the absence of adiabatic changes and if CRs are\nefficiently scattered by Alfv\\'en waves that are propagating up the CR\ngradient.

The ULX pulsar clearly indicates\nthat this hypothesis is not universal, and the question arises if other ULXs\nare as well powered by accretion onto neutron stars.

A 94,\n010302(R) (2016)] not only exploits second-order-based scenarios, but it also\nprovides a detailed investigation of nonclassicality and entanglement in\nnon-Gaussian and multimode radiation fields undergoing a fluctuating\nattenuation. That is, various examples of criteria and states are studied in\ndetail, unexpected effects, e.g., the dependency of the squeezing transfer on\nthe coherent displacement, are discovered, and it is demonstrated that\nnon-Gaussian entanglement can be more robust against atmospheric losses than\nGaussian one. Additionally, we propose a detection scheme for measuring the\nconsidered moments after propagation through the atmosphere. Therefore, our\nresults may help to develop, improve, and optimize non-Gaussian sources of\nquantum light for applications in free-space quantum communication.\n"]}]

We find a concentration of cold dust in the unshocked ejecta of Cas A\nand derive a mass of 0.3-0.5 Msun of silicate grains freshly produced in the\nSNR, with a lower limit of >=0.1-0.2 Msun. For a mixture of 50% of\nsilicate-type grains and 50% of carbonaceous grains, we derive a total SN dust\nmass between 0.4 Msun and 0.6 Msun. These dust mass estimates are higher than\nfrom most previous studies of Cas A and support the scenario of supernova\ndominated dust production at high redshifts. We furthermore derive an\ninterstellar extinction map for the field around Cas A which towards Cas A\ngives average values of A_V=6-8 mag, up to a maximum of A_V=15 mag.\n","Comment: 37 pages, 24 figures, Manuscript published in MNRAS, including minor\n  corrections.

In addition to the\ntransits of a planet in front of its star and the eclipses of the planet by its\nstar, researchers have reported flux variations at the orbital frequency and\nits harmonics: planetary reflection and/or emission and Doppler beaming of\nstarlight produce one peak per orbit, while ellipsoidal variations of a tidally\ndistorted star and/or planet produce two maxima per orbit. Researchers have\nalso reported significant photometric variability at three times the orbital\nfrequency, sometimes much greater than the predictions of tidal theory. The\nreflected phase variations of a homogeneous planet contains power at even\norbital harmonics-important for studies of ellipsoidal variations-but cannot\ncontain odd orbital harmonics. We show that odd harmonics can, however, be\nproduced by an edge-on planet with a time-variable map, or an inclined planet\nwith a North-South (N-S) asymmetric map. Either of these scenarios entail\nweather: short-period planets are expected to have zero obliquity and hence N-S\nsymmetric stellar forcing. North-South asymmetry in a giant planet would\ntherefore suggest stochastic localized features, such as weather. However, we\nfind that previous claims of large-amplitude odd modes in Kepler photometry are\nartifacts of removing planetary transits rather than modeling them. The only\nreliable claims of odd harmonics remain HAT-P-7b and Kepler-13Ab, for which the\nthird mode amplitude is 6-8% of the planetary flux. Although time-variable\nalbedo maps could in principle explain these odd harmonics, upper-limits on the\ninfrared variability of hot Jupiters make this hypothesis unlikely.

We\ndemonstrate that this discrepancy is a result of the methodology adopted for\nmeasuring filament widths. First, we perform the previously used analysis\ntechnique on artificial scale-free data, and obtain a peaked width distribution\nof filament-like structures. Next, we repeat the analysis on three Herschel\nmaps and reproduce the narrow distribution of widths found in previous studies\n$-$ when considering the average width of each filament. However, the\ndistribution of widths measured at all points along a filament spine is broader\nthan the distribution of mean filament widths, indicating that the narrow\nspread (interpreted as a \"characteristic\" width) results from averaging.\nFurthermore, the width is found to vary significantly from one end of a\nfilament to the other. Therefore, the previously identified peak at 0.1 pc\ncannot be understood as representing the typical width of filaments. We find an\nalternative explanation by modelling the observed width distribution as a\ntruncated power-law distribution, sampled with uncertainties. The position of\nthe peak is connected to the lower truncation scale and is likely set by the\nchoice of parameters used in measuring filament widths.

The heavy fermion singlet/Higgs triplet not only results in a\ntype-I/II seesaw at tree level but also contributes to the inflaton decay at\none-loop level. In this scenario, the type-I/II seesaw contains all of the\nphysical CP phases in the lepton sector and hence the CP violation for the\nnon-thermal leptogenesis by the inflaton decay exactly comes from the imaginary\npart of the neutrino mass matrix.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 1 figure"]}]

Depending on the dopant\nelements and their concentration, Jc exhibits a variety of magnetic-field (H)\nand temperature (T) dependences. (1) In the case of K-Ba122, MHL of the\nunderdoped samples (x < 0.33) exhibits the second magnetization peak (SMP),\nwhich sustains high Jc at high H and high T, exceeding 10^5 A/cm2 at T = 25 K\nand H = 6 T for x = 0.30. On the other hand, SMP is missing in the optimally (x\n~ 0.36-0.40) and overdoped (x ~ 0.50) samples, and consequently Jc rapidly\ndecreases by more than one order of magnitude, although the change in Tc is\nwithin a few K. (2) For Co-Ba122, SMP is always present over the entire\nsuperconducting (SC) dome from the under (x ~ 0.05) to the overdoped (x ~ 0.12)\nregion. However, the magnitude of Jc significantly changes with x, exhibiting a\nsharp maximum at x ~ 0.057, which is a slightly underdoped composition for\nCo-Ba122. (3) For P-Ba122, the highest Jc is attained at x = 0.30 corresponding\nto the highest Tc composition. For the overdoped samples, MHL is characterized\nby SMP located close to the irreversibility field. Common to the three doping\nvariations, Jc becomes highest at the under-doping side of SC dome near the\nphase boundary between SC phase and the antiferromagnetic/orthorhombic phase.\nAlso, the peak appears in a narrow range of doping, distinct from the Tc dome\nwith broad maximum.

In the model, it is presumed that, initially, a\nvertically extended hot gas (corona) is supplied to the central supermassive\nblack hole by capturing the interstellar medium and stellar wind. In this\nscenario, when the initial mass accretion rate $\\dot M/ \\dot M_{\\rm Edd}\n\\gtrsim 0.01$, at a critical radius $r_{\\rm d}$, part of the hot gas begins to\ncondense onto the equatorial disc plane of the black hole, forming an inner\ncold accretion disc.

The size of the inner disc is determined by the initial mass accretion\nrate. With the increase of the initial mass accretion rate, the size of the\ninner disc increases, which results in both the increase of the Compton\nreflection scaling factor $\\Re$ and the increase of the hard X-ray photon index\n$\\Gamma$.

With a 3.2\"\nseparation and similar radial velocities and photometric distances, 'B-N' is\nlikely physically associated with 'R-S', making this a quintuple system, but\nthat is incidental to our main claim of a strongly interacting quadruple system\nin 'R-S'. The two binaries in 'R-S' have orbital periods of 13.27 d and 14.41\nd, respectively, and each has an inclination angle of >89 degrees. From our\nanalysis of radial velocity measurements, and of the photometric lightcurve, we\nconclude that all four stars are very similar with masses close to 0.4 Msun.\nBoth of the binaries exhibit significant ETVs where those of the primary and\nsecondary eclipses 'diverge' by 0.05 days over the course of the 80-day\nobservations. Via a systematic set of numerical simulations of quadruple\nsystems consisting of two interacting binaries, we conclude that the outer\norbital period is very likely to be between 300 and 500 days. If sufficient\ntime is devoted to RV studies of this faint target, the outer orbit should be\nmeasurable within a year.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 18 figures, 7 tables; accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

Concerning the smaller C-types such as\nEugenia, both their derived surface composition (enstatite and amorphous\nsilicates) and low density suggest that these bodies accreted from the same\nbuilding blocks, namely chondritic porous, pyroxene-rich IDPs and volatiles\n(mostly water ice), and that a significant volume fraction of these bodies has\nremained unaffected by hydrothermal activity likely implying a late accretion.\nIn addition, their current heliocentric distance may best explain the presence\nor absence of water ice at their surfaces. Finally, we raise the possibility\nthat CI chondrites, Tagish Lake-like material, or hydrated IDPs may be\nrepresentative samples of the cores of these bodies.\n"]}]

This effectively solves the well-known discontinuity problem that\ndegrades the boundary accuracy of existing local partitioned GP methods. Our\nmain innovation is to represent the continuity conditions as additional\npseudo-observations that the differences between neighboring GP responses are\nidentically zero at an appropriately chosen set of boundary input locations. To\npredict the response at any input location, we simply augment the actual\nresponse observations with the pseudo-observations and apply standard GP\nprediction methods to the augmented data. In contrast to heuristic continuity\nadjustments, this has an advantage of working within a formal GP framework, so\nthat the GP-based predictive uncertainty quantification remains valid.

A common\nassumption adopted in the literature is that the realized (ground truth) reward\nby taking the selected action is observed by the learner at no cost, which,\nhowever, is not realistic in many practical scenarios. When observing the\nground truth reward is costly, a key challenge for the learner is how to\njudiciously acquire the ground truth by assessing the benefits and costs in\norder to balance learning efficiency and learning cost. From the information\ntheoretic perspective, a perhaps even more interesting question is how much\nefficiency might be lost due to this cost. In this paper, we design a novel\ncontextual bandit-based learning algorithm and endow it with the active\nlearning capability. The key feature of our algorithm is that in addition to\nsending a query to an annotator for the ground truth, prior information about\nthe ground truth learned by the learner is sent together, thereby reducing the\nquery cost. We prove that by carefully choosing the algorithm parameters, the\nlearning regret of the proposed algorithm achieves the same order as that of\nconventional contextual bandit algorithms in cost-free scenarios, implying\nthat, surprisingly, cost due to acquiring the ground truth does not increase\nthe learning regret in the long-run.

The free layer and a\nsynthetic antiferromagnetic (SyF) pinned layer of the spin-torque oscillator\nare in-plane magnetized. In order to understand experimental results, numerical\nsimulations have been performed considering three types of interlayer\ninteractions: exchange interaction between the two magnetic layers of the SyF,\nmutual spin torque between the top layer of the SyF and the free layer and\ndipolar interaction between all three magnetic layers. It will be shown that\nthe dynamic dipolar coupling plays a predominant role. First, it leads to a\nhybridization of the free layer and the SyF linear modes and through this gives\nrise to a strong field dependence of the critical current. In particular, there\nis a field range of enhanced damping in which much higher current is required\nto drive the modes into steady state. This results in a gap in the excitation\nspectrum. Second, the dynamic dipolar interaction is also responsible for the\nnon-linear interaction between the current driven steady state mode and the\ndamped modes of the system. Here one can distinguish: (i) a resonant\ninteraction that leads to a kink in the frequency-field and frequency-current\ndispersions accompanied by a small hysteresis and a reduction of the linewidth\nof the steady state mode and (ii) a non-resonant interaction that leads to a\nstrong frequency redshift of the damped mode.

The primary is a magnetic Bp star with a variable longitudinal\nmagnetic field, a polar field strength of ~1400 G and a low obliquity, while\nthe secondary is probably a hot Am star and does not appear to be magnetic. The\nrotation period of the primary (5.04 d) is not synchronised with the orbit, but\nthe rotation angular velocity is close to being synchronised with the orbital\nangular velocity of the secondary at periastron, perhaps as a result of tidal\ninteractions. The periastron separation is small enough (about 12 times the\nradius of the primary star) that BD-19 5044L may be one of the very rare known\ncases of a tidally interacting SB2 binary system containing a magnetic Ap/Bp\nstar.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics"]}]

For any $(n,k)$ code we show that the\nnumber of correctable errors under this constraint is bounded above by $\\lfloor\n(n-k/\\alpha)/2 \\rfloor.$ Moreover, we present two families of MDS array codes\nwhich achieves this bound with equality under a simple decoding procedure. The\ndecoder downloads an $\\alpha$ proportion of each of the codeword's coordinates,\nand provides a much larger decoding radius compared to the naive approach of\nreading some $\\alpha n$ coordinates of the codeword. One of the code families\nis formed of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes with well-chosen evaluation points, while\nthe other is based on folded RS codes.\n  Finally, we show that folded RS codes also have the optimal list decoding\nradius under the fractional decoding constraint.\n","Comment: Submitted to ISIT 2017"]}]

The effective\nfield theory studied here contains nucleons, pions, isoscalar scalar (\\sigma)\nand vector (\\omega) fields, and isovector vector (\\rho) fields. The theory\nexhibits a nonlinear realization of spontaneously broken SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R\nchiral symmetry and has three desirable features: it uses the same degrees of\nfreedom to describe the nuclear currents and the strong-interaction dynamics,\nit satisfies the symmetries of the underlying theory of QCD, and its parameters\ncan be calibrated using strong-interaction phenomena, like hadron scattering or\nthe empirical properties of finite nuclei. Moreover, it has recently been\nverified that for normal nuclear systems, it is possible to expand the\neffective Lagrangian systematically in powers of the meson fields (and their\nderivatives) and to truncate the expansion reliably after the first few orders.\nUsing a mean-field version of the energy functional, accurate quantitative\nresults are obtained for the bulk and single-particle properties of medium- and\nheavy-mass nuclei. The importance of modern perspectives in effective field\ntheory and density functional theory for understanding these successes of QHD\nis emphasized.
