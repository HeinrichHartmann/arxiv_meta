We argue that this\nentails a notion of nonintegrability: a generic general relativistic model, at\nleast when coupled to cosmologically interesting matter, almost certainly\npossesses neither differentiable Dirac observables nor a reduced phase space.\nIt follows that the standard notion of observable has to be extended to include\nnon-differentiable or even discontinuous generalized observables. These cannot\ncarry Poisson-algebraic structures and do not admit a standard quantization;\none thus faces a quantum representation problem of gravitational observables.\nThis has deep consequences for a quantum theory of gravity, which we\ninvestigate in a simple model for a system with Hamiltonian constraint that\nfails to be completely integrable. We show that basing the quantization on\nstandard topology precludes a semiclassical limit and can even prohibit any\nsolutions to the quantum constraints. Our proposed solution to this problem is\nto refine topology such that a complete set of Dirac observables becomes\ncontinuous. In the toy model, it turns out that a refinement to a polymer-type\ntopology, as e.g. used in loop gravity, is sufficient. Basing quantization of\nthe toy model on this finer topology, we find a complete set of quantum Dirac\nobservables and a suitable semiclassical limit. This strategy is applicable to\nrealistic candidate theories of quantum gravity and thereby suggests a solution\nto a long-standing problem which implies ramifications for the very concept of\nquantization. Our work reveals a qualitatively novel facet of chaos in physics\nand opens up a new avenue of research on chaos in gravity which hints at deep\ninsights into the structure of quantum gravity.\n","Comment: 6 pages + references -- accepted for publication in Phys.

Such spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking occurs in nematic liquid crystals and a highlight of such\nanisotropic liquids are the uniaxial and biaxial nematics. Generalizing the\nfamiliar uniaxial and biaxial nematics to phases characterized by an arbitrary\npoint group symmetry, referred to as \\emph{generalized nematics}, leads to a\nlarge hierarchy of phases and possible orientational phase transitions. We\ndiscuss how a particular class of nematic phase transitions related to axial\npoint groups can be efficiently captured within a recently proposed gauge\ntheoretical formulation of generalized nematics [K.

For moderate values\nof the magnetic Reynolds number ($100 \\lesssim Rm \\lesssim 550$, with $Rm$\nbased on the box depth and the convective velocity), a large-scale (i.e.\nsystem-size) magnetic field is generated. The amplitude of the magnetic energy\noscillates in time, nearly out of phase with the oscillating amplitude of the\nlarge-scale vortex. The large-scale vortex is disrupted once the magnetic field\nreaches a critical strength, showing that these oscillations are of magnetic\norigin. The dynamo mechanism relies on those components of the flow that have\nlength scales lying between that of the large-scale vortex and the typical\nconvective cell size; smaller-scale flows are not required. The large-scale\nvortex plays a crucial role in the magnetic induction despite being essentially\ntwo-dimensional; we thus refer to this dynamo as a large-scale-vortex dynamo.\nFor larger magnetic Reynolds numbers, the dynamo is small scale, with a\nmagnetic energy spectrum that peaks at the scale of the convective cells. In\nthis case, the small-scale magnetic field continuously suppresses the\nlarge-scale vortex by disrupting the correlations between the convective\nvelocities that allow it to form. The suppression of the large-scale vortex at\nhigh $Rm$ therefore probably limits the relevance of the large-scale-vortex\ndynamo to astrophysical objects with moderate values of $Rm$, such as planets.\nIn this context, the ability of the large-scale-vortex dynamo to operate at low\nmagnetic Prandtl numbers is of great interest.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 17 figures, accepted for publication in J.

The submm\nALMA data reveal TiO and TiO$_2$ bearing gas within the extended atmosphere of\nMira. While TiO is traceable up to a radius (FWHM/2) of 4.0 R$_{\\star}$,\nTiO$_2$ extends as far as 5.5 R$_{\\star}$ and unlike TiO appears to be\nanisotropically distributed. Optical spectra display variable emission of TiI\nand TiO from inner parts of the extended atmosphere (<3 R$_{\\star}$). Chemical\nmodels which include shocks are in general agreement with the observations of\ngas-phase titanium-bearing molecules. It is unlikely that substantial amounts\nof titanium is locked up in solids because the abundance of the gaseous\ntitanium species is very high. In particular, formation of hot titanium-rich\ncondensates is very improbable because we find no traces of their hot precursor\nspecies in the gas phase. It therefore appears unlikely that the formation of\ndust in Mira, and possibly other M-type AGB stars, is initiated by titanium\noxides.\n","Comment: 19 pages plus spectral atlas of the TiO gamma' band in 1998-2014\n  submitted to A&A"]}]

Consistent with\nprevious studies, our models suggest that interstellar water ice is delivered\nto forming disks without significant alteration. On the other hand, the local\nvertically averaged H2O ice abundance and HDO/H2O ice ratio can differ more, by\nup to a factor of several, depending on time and distance from a central star.\nKey parameters for the local variations are the fluence of stellar UV photons\nen route into the disk and the ice layered structure, the latter of which is\nmostly established in the prestellar stages.

This restriction allows us to implement procedures to\ncheck for liveness and safety in types which in turn approximates liveness and\nsafety in Go programs.

PKS 1510-089 is one of only a few flat spectrum radio quasars\ndetected in the VHE (very-high-energy, > 100 GeV) gamma-ray band. Aims. We\nstudy the broadband spectral and temporal properties of the PKS 1510-089\nemission during a high gamma-ray state. Methods. We performed VHE gamma-ray\nobservations of PKS 1510-089 with the MAGIC telescopes during a long high\ngamma-ray state in May 2015. In order to perform broadband modelling of the\nsource, we have also gathered contemporaneous multiwavelength data in radio,\nIR, optical photometry and polarization, UV, X-ray and GeV gamma-ray ranges. We\nconstruct a broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) in two periods,\nselected according to VHE gamma-ray state. Results. PKS 1510-089 has been\ndetected by MAGIC during a few day-long observations performed in the middle of\na long, high optical and gamma-ray state, showing for the first time a\nsignificant VHE gamma-ray variability. Similarly to the optical and gamma-ray\nhigh state of the source detected in 2012, it was accompanied by a rotation of\nthe optical polarization angle and the emission of a new jet component observed\nin radio. However, due to large uncertainty on the knot separation time, the\nassociation with the VHE gamma-ray emission cannot be firmly established. The\nspectral shape in the VHE band during the flare is similar to the ones obtained\nduring previous measurements of the source. The observed flux variability sets\nfor the first time constraints on the size of the region from which VHE gamma\nrays are emitted. We model the broadband SED in the framework of the external\nCompton scenario and discuss the possible emission site in view of\nmultiwavelength data and alternative emission models.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 10 figures, accepted for a publication in A&A"]}]

In order to obtain unbiased measurements of its spin and the\nrelated relativistic effects, a comprehensive understanding of the\ngravitational perturbations of the stars and stellar remnants around the MBH is\nquite essential. Here, we study the perturbations on the observables of a\ntypical target star, i.e., the apparent orbital motion and the redshift, due to\nboth the spin-induced relativistic effects and the Newtonian attractions of a\nsingle or a cluster of disturbing object(s). We find that, in most cases, the\nNewtonian perturbations on the observables are mainly attributed to the\nperturbed orbital period of the target star, rather than the Newtonian orbital\nprecessions. The Newtonian perturbations have their unique features when they\npeak around the pericenter passage in each revolution, which is quite different\nfrom those of the spin-induced effects. Looking at the currently detected star\nS2/S0-2, we find that its spin-induced effects on both the image position and\nredshift are very likely obscured by the gravitational perturbations from the\nstar S0-102 alone. We also investigate and discuss the Newtonian perturbations\non a hypothetical S-star located inside the orbits of the currently detected\nones. By considering a number of possible stellar distributions near the\ncentral MBH, we find that the spin-induced effects on the apparent position and\nthe redshift dominate over the stellar perturbations for target stars with\norbital semimajor axis smaller than $100-400$AU if the MBH is maximally\nspinning.

One of the\nmain challenges is contamination by artifacts, especially in regions of strong\nunresolved emission. We present a novel method for identifying candidates for\nvariables and transients from the outputs of such surveys' data pipelines. We\nuse the method to systematically search for novae in iPTF observations of the\nbulge of M31. We demonstrate that most artifacts produced by the iPTF pipeline\nform a locally uniform background of false detections approximately obeying\nPoissonian statistics, whereas genuine variables and transients as well as\nartifacts associated with bright stars result in clusters of detections, whose\nspread is determined by the source localization accuracy. This makes the\nproblem analogous to source detection on images produced by X-ray telescopes,\nenabling one to utilize tools developed in X-ray astronomy. In particular, we\nuse a wavelet-based source detection algorithm from the Chandra data analysis\npackage CIAO. Starting from ~2.5x10^5 raw detections made by the iPTF data\npipeline, we obtain ~4000 unique source candidates. Cross-matching these\ncandidates with the source-catalog of a deep reference image, we find\ncounterparts for ~90% of them.

We identify novae among these candidates by applying\nselection cuts based on the expected properties of nova lightcurves. Thus, we\nrecovered all 12 known novae registered during the time span of the survey and\ndiscovered three nova candidates.

In this\ninstance of the problem of a single impurity immersed in a quantum bath, the\nmedium is a Lieb-Liniger gas of bosons ranging from the weakly interacting to\nthe Tonks-Girardeau regime, whereas the impurity is coupled to the bath via a\ndifferent contact potential producing both repulsive and attractive\ninteractions. Both the case of a mobile impurity, having the same mass as the\nparticles in the medium, and of a static impurity with infinite mass are\nconsidered. We make use of exact numerical techniques that allow us to\ncalculate the ground-state energy of the impurity, its effective mass as well\nas the contact parameter between the impurity and the bath. These quantities\nare investigated as a function of the strength of interactions between the\nimpurity and the bath and within the bath. In particular, we find that the\neffective mass rapidly increases to very large values when the impurity gets\nstrongly coupled to an otherwise weakly repulsive bath. This heavy impurity\nhardly moves within the medium, thereby realizing the \"self-localization\"\nregime of the Landau-Pekar polaron.

Hence, it can not necessarily be used as a\ntracer of the 12C/13C ratio. The most likely hypothesis to explain the observed\ndiscrepancy between the 12CO/13CO and 12C/13C ratios is CO isotopologue\nselective photodissociation by UV radiation. Unlike the CO isotopologue ratio,\nthe HCN isotopologue ratio is not affected by UV radiation. Therefore, HCN\nisotopologue ratios can be used as the tracer of the atomic C ratio in UV\nirradiated regions. We have performed a detailed non-LTE excitation analysis of\ncircumstellar H12CN and H13CN line emission around R Scl, observed with ALMA\nand APEX, using a radiative transfer code, ALI.

Despite this striking assumption, many\nrecent studies have sought to assess whether neutrality can provide a good\ndescription of different episodes of cultural change. One approach has been to\ntest whether neutral predictions are consistent with observed progeny\ndistributions, recording the number of variants that have produced a given\nnumber of new instances within a specified time interval: the classic example\nis the distribution of baby names registered within a given year. Here we\ndevelop new methods to analyze the shape of progeny distributions.

Using an overlapping\ngenerations model we show that the progeny distribution consists of two phases:\na power law phase with an universally-applicable exponent of -3/2, followed by\nan exponential cut-off for variants with very large numbers of progeny. Maximum\nlikelihood estimations of the model parameters then provide a direct way to\nparameterize the neutral model. We apply our approach to a data set of baby\nnames from Australia. While neutrality provides a plausible description of the\nprogeny distribution of abundant variants, rare variants deviate from\nneutrality. This indicates that analyses based on only the most popular\nvariants can provide misleading evidence for underlying transmission\nhypotheses. To determine whether the progeny distribution is a meaningful\nstatistic to distinguish between different processes of cultural transmission\nwe analyze the effects of novelty biases.

The release of electron neutrinos, which are\nabundantly produced by electron captures, accelerates the catastrophic infall\nand causes a gradual neutronization of the stellar plasma by converting protons\nto neutrons as dominant constituents of neutron star matter. The emission of\nneutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors carries away the gravitational\nbinding energy of the compact remnant and drives its evolution from the hot\ninitial to the cold final state. The absorption of electron neutrinos and\nantineutrinos in the surroundings of the newly formed neutron star can power\nthe supernova explosion and determines the conditions in the innermost\nsupernova ejecta, making them an interesting site for the nucleosynthesis of\niron-group elements and trans-iron nuclei. In this Chapter the basic neutrino\nphysics in supernova cores and nascent neutron stars will be discussed.

According to\nthe standard paradigm of the neutrino-driven mechanism, the energy transfer by\nthe intense neutrino flux to the medium behind the stagnating core-bounce\nshock, assisted by violent hydrodynamic mass motions (sometimes subsumed by the\nterm \"turbulence\"), revives the outward shock motion and thus initiates the SN\nblast.
