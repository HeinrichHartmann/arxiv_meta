HST imaging shows\nthat the active nucleus is offset by 1.3 +- 0.1 arcsec (i.e. ~11 kpc) with\nrespect to the center of the host galaxy.

We derive closed-form solutions for\nthe evolution of stellar surface density, gas surface density and gas-phase\nmetallicity, and show that these parameters form a tight relation independent\nof initial gas density and time.

We can go a long way toward solving both problems if the disk\ngas surrounding planets has no intrinsic diffusivity (\"viscosity\"). In\ninviscid, laminar disks, a planet readily repels gas away from its orbit. On\nshort timescales, zero viscosity gas accumulates inside a planet's orbit to\nslow Type I migration by orders of magnitude. On longer timescales, multiple\nsuper-Earths (distributed between, say, $\\sim$0.1--10 AU) can torque inviscid\ngas out of interplanetary space, either inward to feed their stars, or outward\nto be blown away in a wind. We explore this picture with 2D hydrodynamics\nsimulations of Earths and super-Earths embedded in inviscid disks, confirming\ntheir slow/stalled migration even under gas-rich conditions, and showing that\ndisk transport rates range up to $\\sim$$10^{-7} M_\\odot~{\\rm yr^{-1}}$ and\nscale as $\\dot{M} \\propto \\Sigma M_{\\rm p}^{3/2}$, where $\\Sigma$ is the disk\nsurface density and $M_{\\rm p}$ is the planet mass.

In addition, the SS models, which employ an\nexplicit filter, have no impact in general. On the contrary, both EV and NL\nmodels change the statistics if an explicit filter is used. For example, they\nslightly increase the dissipation on the smallest scales. We demonstrate that\nthe nonlinear model improves higher order statistics already with a small\nexplicit filter, i.e. a three-point stencil. The results of e.g. the structure\nfunctions or the skewness and kurtosis of the current density distribution are\ncloser to the ones obtained from simulations at higher resolution. We conclude\nthat the nonlinear model with a small explicit filter is suitable for\napplication in more complex scenarios when higher order statistics are\nimportant.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in PRE"]}]

We measure an average temperature\nof $kT=5.0\\pm0.7$ keV; a metallicity with respect to solar of\n$Z/Z_{\\odot}=0.33^{+0.19}_{-0.17}$, consistent with lower-redshift clusters;\nand a redshift of $z=1.99^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$, consistent with the earlier photo-z\nestimate. The measured gas density profile leads to a mass estimate at\n$r_{500}$ of $M_{500}=(6.3\\pm1.5)\\times10^{13}M_{\\odot}$. From CARMA 30 GHz\ndata, we measure the spherically integrated Compton parameter within $r_{500}$\nto be $Y_{500}=(3.6\\pm0.4)\\times10^{-12}$. We compare the measured properties\nof XLSSC 122 to lower-redshift cluster samples, and find good agreement when\nassuming the simplest (self-similar) form for the evolution of cluster scaling\nrelations. While a single cluster provides limited information, this result\nsuggests that the evolution of the intracluster medium in the most massive,\nwell developed clusters is remarkably simple, even out to the highest redshifts\nwhere they have been found. At the same time, our data reaffirm the previously\nreported spatial offset between the centers of the X-ray and SZ signals for\nXLSSC 122, suggesting a disturbed configuration. Higher spatial resolution data\ncould thus provide greater insights into the internal dynamics of this system.\n","Comment: 12 pages, A&A accepted"]}]

We describe the internal distribution of angular momentum in PMS\nstars accreting at high rates and we show how the various physical conditions\nimpact their internal structures, evolutionary tracks, and rotation velocities\nduring the PMS and the early main sequence. We find that the smooth angular\nmomentum accretion considered in previous studies leads to an angular momentum\nbarrier and does not allow the formation of massive stars by accretion. A\nbraking mechanism is needed in order to circumvent this angular momentum\nbarrier. This mechanism has to be efficient enough to remove more than 2/3 of\nthe angular momentum from the inner accretion disc. Due to the weak efficiency\nof angular momentum transport by shear instability and meridional circulation\nduring the accretion phase, the internal rotation profiles of accreting stars\nreflect essentially the angular momentum accretion history. As a consequence,\ncareful choice of the angular momentum accretion history allows circumvention\nof any limitation in mass and velocity, and production of stars of any mass and\nvelocity compatible with structure equations.\n"]}]

Through the\nmodification of the coupling design that relies on additional spectral\ndependence, it is possible to achieve similar coincidence ratios without the\nincreased pumping requirement.

Following this we review recent work on the development of\nrenormalization groups, both numerical and analytical, that alleviate the\neffects of truncating the spectrum. Using these technologies, we consider a\nnumber of applications to one-dimensional systems: properties of carbon\nnanotubes, quenches in the Lieb-Liniger model, 1+1D quantum chromodynamics, as\nwell as Landau-Ginzburg theories. In the final part we move our attention to\nconsider truncated spectrum methods applied to two-dimensional systems. This\ninvolves combining truncated spectrum methods with matrix product state\nalgorithms. We describe applications of this method to two-dimensional systems\nof free fermions and the quantum Ising model, including their non-equilibrium\ndynamics.\n","Comment: 111 pages, 54 figures, 6 tables; comments welcome"]}]

Firstly, we used data about the luminosities and stellar\nmasses of high stellar mass galaxies with $\\log(M_*/h^{-1}M_\\odot) \\geq 11.3$.\nSecondly, we applied a scaling relation that combines morphological and\nphysical parameters of superclusters to obtain supercluster luminosities, and\nobtained supercluster masses using the mass-to-light ratios found for local\nrich superclusters. We find that the BGW superclusters are very elongated\nsystems, with shape parameter values of less than $0.2$. This value is lower\nthan that found for the most elongated local superclusters. The values of the\nfourth Minkowski functional $V_3$ for the richer BGW superclusters ($V_3 = 7$\nand $10$) show that they have a complicated and rich inner structure. We\nidentify two Planck SZ clusters in the BGW superclusters, one in the richest\nBGW supercluster, and another in one of the poor BGW superclusters. The\nluminosities of the BGW superclusters are in the range of $1 -\n8\\times~10^{13}h^{-2}L_\\odot$, and masses in the range of $0.4 -\n2.1\\times~10^{16}h^{-1}M_\\odot$. Supercluster luminosities and masses obtained\nwith two methods agree well. We conclude that the BGW is a complex of massive,\nluminous and large superclusters with very elongated shape. The search and\ndetailed study, including the morphology analysis of the richest superclusters\nand their complexes from observations and simulations can help us to understand\nformation and evolution of the cosmic web.\n","Comment: Comments: 10 pages, 2 figures, A&A, in press"]}]

Methods: From the spectroscopic follow-ups of the ATLASGAL TOP100\nsample, we selected several multiplets of CH3CN, CH3CCH, and CH3OH emission\nlines to derive and compare the physical properties of the gas in the clumps\nalong the evolutionary sequence. Our findings are compared with results\nobtained from CO isotopologues, dust, and NH3 from previous studies on the same\nsample. Results: The chemical properties of each species have a major role on\nthe measured physical properties. Low temperatures are traced by NH3, CH3OH,\nand CO (in the early phases), the warm and dense envelope can be probed with\nCH3CN, CH3CCH, and, in evolved sources via CO isotopologues. CH3OH and CH3CN\nare also abundant in the hot cores, and their high-excitation transitions may\nbe good tools to study the kinematics in the hot gas surrounding the YSOs that\nthese clumps are hosting. All tracers show, to different degrees, progressive\nwarming with evolution. The relation between gas temperature and L/M is\nreproduced by a toy model of a spherical, internally heated clump. Conclusions:\nThe evolutionary sequence defined for the clumps is statistically valid and we\ncould identify the processes dominating in different intervals of L/M.

Sampling methods based on stochastic\npartial differential equations provide a highly scalable way to sample Gaussian\nfields, but the resulting parametrization is mesh dependent. We propose a\nmultilevel decomposition of the stochastic field to allow for scalable,\nhierarchical sampling based on solving a mixed finite element formulation of a\nstochastic reaction-diffusion equation with a random, white noise source\nfunction. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the scalability of\nthe sampling method as well as numerical results of multilevel Monte Carlo\nsimulations for a subsurface porous media flow application using the proposed\nsampling method.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 9 figures, To appear in SIAM Journal on Scientific\n  Computing Special Session: 2016 Copper Mountain Conference"]}]

Since the effect of the Earth oblateness\nis strong at low altitudes, its inclusion in the model can sensibly improve the\ninitial orbit, giving a better starting guess for differential corrections and\nincreasing the chances to obtain their convergence. The input set consists of\ntwo tracks of radar observations, each one composed of at least 4 observations\ntaken during the same pass of the satellite. A single observation gives the\ntopocentric position of the satellite, where the range is very accurate, while\nthe line of sight direction is poorly determined. From these data we can\ncompute by a polynomial fit the values of the range and range rate at the mean\nepochs of the two tracks. In order to obtain a preliminary orbit we wish to\ncompute the angular velocities, that is the rate of change of the line of\nsight. In the same spirit of (Gronchi et al 2015), we also wish to correct the\nvalues of the angular measurements, so that they fit the selected dynamical\nmodel if the same holds for the radial distance and velocity. The selected\nmodel is a perturbed Keplerian dynamics, where the only perturbation included\nis the secular effect of the $J_2$ term of the geopotential.
