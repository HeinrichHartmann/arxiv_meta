It is shown that it\nfollows also from the S-polynomial recurrence and certain rules following from\nthe trigonometric nature of the argument x = rho(n). The minimal integer\npolynomial C(n,x) for rho(n) is presented, and its simple zeros are expressed\nin the power-basis of Q(rho(n)). Also the positive zeros of the Chebyshev\npolynomial S(k-1,rho(n)) are rewritten in this basis. The number of positive\nand negative zeros of C(n,x) is determined. The coefficient C(n,0) is computed\nfor special classes of n values. Theorems on C(n,x) in terms of monic integer\nChebyshev polynomials of the first kind (called here t-hat) are given. These\npolynomials can be factorized in terms of the minimal C-polynomials. A\nconjecture on the discriminant of these polynomials is made. In order to\ndetermine the cycle structure of the (Abelian) Galois group a novel modular\nmultiplication, called Modd n is introduced. On the reduced odd residue system\nModd n this furnishes a group which is isomorphic to this Galois group.\n","Comment: 57 pages with 4 figures and 8 tables Revised version, March 2017:\n  error in Table 7, line n=80, column 5 corrected, typos corrected and note\n  before section 4 added"]}]

In this paper, we invoke collapse of dark bosonic halo matter,\nexisting initially in self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) phase, to\nlead to formation of SMBH.

If\nthe condensate, made up of identical dark bosons of mass $m$, collapses to form\na black hole of mass $M_{eff}$ as soon as the former's effective size shrinks\nbelow the corresponding Schwarzschild radius, a simple inequality $ m \\ M_{eff}\n\\gtrsim 0.64 \\ m^2_{Pl} $ can be derived, that ensues from a competition\nbetween attractive self-gravity and quantum repulsion arising due to\nuncertainty principle.

Group of individuals who are cyclically\nconnected are said to be balanced if the number of negative edges in the cycle\nis even and unbalanced otherwise. In its earliest and most natural formulation,\nthe balance of a social network was thus defined from its simple cycles, cycles\nwhich do not visit any vertex more than once. Because of the inherent\ndifficulty associated with finding such cycles on very large networks, social\nbalance has since then been studied via other means. In this article we present\nthe balance as measured from the simple cycles and primitive orbits of social\nnetworks. We specifically provide two measures of balance: the proportion\n$R_\\ell$ of negative simple cycles of length $\\ell$ for each $\\ell\\leq 20$\nwhich generalises the triangle index, and a ratio $K_\\ell$ which extends the\nrelative signed clustering coefficient introduced by Kunegis. To do so, we use\na Monte Carlo implementation of a novel exact formula for counting the simple\ncycles on any weighted directed graph. Our method is free from the\ndouble-counting problem affecting previous cycle-based approaches, does not\nrequire edge-reciprocity of the underlying network, provides a gray-scale\nmeasure of balance for each cycle length separately and is sufficiently\ntractable that it can be implemented on a standard desktop computer. We observe\nthat social networks exhibit strong inter-edge correlations favouring balanced\nsituations and we determine the corresponding correlation length $\\xi$. For\nlonger simple cycles, $R_\\ell$ undergoes a sharp transition to values expected\nfrom an uncorrelated model.

For example, many\nhospitals are interested in pooling their medical records for research, but\nnone may disclose arbitrary patient records to researchers or other healthcare\nproviders. In this context we propose the Private Data Network (PDN), a\nfederated database for querying over the collective data of mutually\ndistrustful parties. In a PDN, each member database does not reveal its tuples\nto its peers nor to the query writer. Instead, the user submits a query to an\nhonest broker that plans and coordinates its execution over multiple private\ndatabases using secure multiparty computation (SMC). Here, each database's\nquery execution is oblivious, and its program counters and memory traces are\nagnostic to the inputs of others. We introduce a framework for executing PDN\nqueries named SMCQL. This system translates SQL statements into SMC primitives\nto compute query results over the union of its source databases without\nrevealing sensitive information about individual tuples to peer data providers\nor the honest broker. Only the honest broker and the querier receive the\nresults of a PDN query.

We argue that this\nweak noise, not captured by the Kramers-Moyal expansion, can not be neglected.\nWe then propose a coarse-graining procedure, which takes the form of a\nstochastic version of the \\emph{heterogeneous mean field} approximation. This\napproximation groups the behaviour of nodes of same degree, reducing the\ncomplexity of the problem. With the help of this approximation, we study in\ndetail two simple families of networks: the regular networks and the\nstar-shaped networks. The analysis reveals and quantifies a finite size effect\nof the dynamics. If we increase the size of the network by keeping all the\nother parameters constant, we transition from a state where conventions emerge\nto a state when no convention emerges. Furthermore, we show that the degree of\na node acts as a time scale. For heterogeneous networks such as star-shaped\nnetworks, the time scale difference can become very large leading to a noisier\nbehaviour of highly connected nodes.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication Physical Review E"]}]

However, how well do these models perform at\nnational scale in China? Is there space to improve the estimation accuracy of\nPM2.5 concentration? The contribution of this study is threefold. Firstly,\ntaking advantage of the newly established national monitoring network, we\ndevelop a national-scale generalized regression neural network (GRNN) model to\nestimate PM2.5 concentrations. Secondly, different assessment experiments are\nundertaken in time and space, to comprehensively evaluate and compare the\nperformance of the widely used models. Finally, to map the yearly and seasonal\nmean distribution of PM2.5 concentrations in China, a pixel-based merging\nstrategy is proposed. The results indicate that the conventional models (linear\nregression, multiple linear regression, and semi-empirical model) do not\nperform well at national scale, with cross-validation R values of 0.488~0.552\nand RMSEs of 30.80~31.51 {\\mu}g/m3, respectively. In contrast, the more\nadvanced models (geographically weighted regression, back-propagation neural\nnetwork, and GRNN) have great advantages in PM2.5 estimation, with R values\nranging from 0.610 to 0.816 and RMSEs from 20.93 to 28.68 {\\mu}g/m3,\nrespectively. In particular, the proposed GRNN model obtains the best\nperformance. Furthermore, the mapped PM2.5 distribution retrieved from 3-km\nMODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) products, agrees quite well with the station\nmeasurements.

We examine\nthe conditions under which the resulting vortex develops an eye at its core;\nthat is, a region where the poloidal flow reverses and the angular momentum is\nlow. For simplicity, we restrict ourselves to steady, axisymmetric flows in a\nBoussinesq fluid. Our numerical experiments show that, in such systems, an eye\nforms as a passive response to the development of a so-called eyewall, a\nconical annulus of intense, negative azimuthal vorticity that can form near the\naxis and separates the eye from the primary vortex. We also observe that the\nvorticity in the eyewall comes from the lower boundary layer, and relies on the\nfact the poloidal flow strips negative vorticity out of the boundary layer and\ncarries it up into the fluid above as it turns upward near the axis. This\nprocess is effective only if the Reynolds number is sufficiently high for the\nadvection of vorticity to dominate over diffusion. Finally we observe that, in\nthe vicinity of the eye and the eyewall, the buoyancy and Coriolis forces are\nnegligible, and so although these forces are crucial to driving and shaping the\nprimary vortex, they play no direct role in eye formation in a Boussinesq\nfluid.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 12 figures"]}]

We find that gas bombardment can potentially damage the surface of the\nspacecraft to a depth of $\\sim 0.1$ mm for quartz material after traversing a\ngas column of $N_{\\rm H}\\sim 2\\times 10^{18}\\rm cm^{-2}$ along the path to\n$\\alpha$ Centauri, whereas the effect is much weaker for graphite material. The\neffect of dust bombardment erodes the spacecraft surface and produces numerous\ncraters due to explosive evaporation of surface atoms. For a spacecraft speed\n$v=0.2c$, we find that dust bombardment can erode a surface layer of $\\sim 0.5$\nmm thickness after the spacecraft has swept a column density of $N_{\\rm H}\\sim\n3\\times 10^{17}\\rm cm^{-2}$, assuming the standard gas-to-dust ratio of the\ninterstellar medium. Dust bombardment also damages the spacecraft surface by\nmodifying the material structure through melting. We calculate the equilibrium\nsurface temperature due to collisional heating by gas atoms as well as the\ntemperature profile as a function of depth into the spacecraft. Our\nquantitative results suggest methods for damage control, and we highlight\npossibilities for shielding strategies and protection of the spacecraft.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 16 figures, accepted to ApJ"]}]

The OH and CH+ lines correlate well with the high-J CO\nemission and delineate the warm and dense molecular region.

The presence of overluminous CO can\nbe traced back to the dependence of the CO intensity on UV illumination. In\nfact, while most lines show some dependence on the UV radiation field, CN and\nCCH are the most sensitive. Moreover dense cloud cores are almost exclusively\ntraced by N2H+. Other traditional high density tracers, such as HCN (1-0), are\nalso easily detected in extended translucent regions at a typical density of\nabout 500 H2 cm-3. In general, we find no straightforward relation between line\ncritical density and the fraction of the line luminosity coming from dense gas\nregions. Our initial findings demonstrate that the relations between line\n(ratio) intensities and environment in GMCs are more complicated than often\nassumed. Sensitivity (i.e., the molecular column density), excitation, and\nabove all chemistry contribute to the observed line intensity distributions.\nThey must be considered together when developing the next generation of\nextra-galactic molecular line diagnostics of mass, density, temperature and\nradiation field.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 29 PDF figures.

The system displays complex\nphotometric and spectroscopic variability over a range of timescales and\nwavelengths. Using two optical CoRoT runs, and infrared Spitzer 3.6 and 4.5\n$\\mu$m observations (simultaneous with the second CoRoT run), we model the\nout-of-eclipse light curves. The large scale structure in both CoRoT light\ncurves is consistent with the constructive and destructive interference of\nstarspot signals at two slightly different periods. Using the stellar $v\\sin i$\n's, we infer different rotation periods: the primary is consistent with\nsynchronisation and the secondary is slightly supersynchronous.

This paper\ndescribes an experiment based on a set of 162,514 celestial objects classified\nas clockwise and counterclockwise spiral galaxies in a fully automatic process,\nshowing that the source of the asymmetry is more than the human perception\nbias. The results are compared to two smaller datasets, and confirm the\nobservation that the handedness of SDSS galaxies can be predicted by their\nphotometric information, and show that the position angle of counterclockwise\ngalaxies computed by SDSS photometry pipeline is consistently higher than the\nposition angle computed for galaxies with clockwise patterns. The experiment\nalso shows statistically significant differences in the measured magnitude,\naccording which galaxies with clockwise patterns are brighter than galaxies\nwith counterclockwise patterns. The magnitude of that difference changes across\nRA ranges, and exhibits a strong correlation with the cosine of the right\nascension.\n","Comment: PASA, accepted"]}]

The\nexact formation process of this nebula and its precise relation to the star's\nevolution remain unknown. Methods. We analyzed infrared Spitzer IRS and\nfar-infrared Herschel/PACS observations of the NGC6164/5 nebula. The Herschel\nimaging allowed us to constrain the global morphology of the nebula. We also\ncombined the infrared spectra with optical spectra of the central star to\nconstrain its evolutionary status. We used these data to derive the abundances\nin the ejected material. To relate this information to the evolutionary status\nof the star, we also determined the fundamental parameters of HD148937 using\nthe CMFGEN atmosphere code. Results. The H$\\alpha$ image displays a bipolar or\n\"8\"-shaped ionized nebula, whilst the infrared images show dust to be more\nconcentrated around the central object.

Consequently it injected a significant bias into the results obtained\nby Queloz et al. (2010) for the projected rotational velocity $v_{eq} \\sin\ni_{\\star}$ (1.59$\\stackrel{+0.08}{_{-0.09}}$ km/s) and the sky-projected\nobliquity $\\lambda$ (-123.0$\\stackrel{+3.4}{_{-4.4}}^{\\circ}$). Using our\ntechnique, we measured these values to be $v_{eq} \\sin i_{\\star}$ =\n1.90$\\pm$0.05 km/s and $\\lambda$ = -143.0$\\stackrel{+1.6}{_{-1.5}}^{\\circ}$. We\nfound no compelling evidence for differential rotation of the star, although\nthere are hints that WASP-8 is pointing away from us with the stellar poles\nrotating about 25% slower than the equator. Measurements at higher accuracy\nduring ingress/egress will be required to confirm this result. In contrast to\nthe traditional analysis of the RM effect, the reloaded RM technique directly\nextracts the local stellar CCFs, allowing us to analyze their shape and to\nmeasure their RV centroids, unbiased by variations in their contrast or FWHM.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A. 12 pages"]}]

The goal of this work is to fully exploit CO isotopologues\nobservations in Lupus, comparing them with physical-chemical model results, in\norder to obtain gas masses for a large number of disks. We have employed\nphysical-chemical models to analyze continuum and CO isotopologues observations\nof Lupus disks, including isotope-selective processes and freeze-out.

We confirm that overall gas-masses are\nvery low, often smaller than 1 $M_{\\rm J}$, if volatile carbon is not depleted.\nAccordingly, global gas/dust ratios predominantly between 1 and 10. Low\nCO-based gas masses and gas/dust ratios may indicate rapid loss of gas, or\nalternatively chemical evolution, e.g. via sequestering of carbon from CO to\nmore complex molecules, or carbon locked up in larger bodies. Current ALMA\nobservations cannot distinguish between these two hypotheses. We have simulated\nboth scenarios, but chemical model results do not allow us to rule out one of\nthe two. Assuming that all Lupus disks have evolved mainly due to viscous\nprocesses over the past few Myr, the observed correlation between the current\nmass accretion rate and dust mass found by Manara et al. (2016) implies a\nconstant gas-to-dust ratio, which is close to 100 based on the observed $M_{\\rm\ndisk}/\\dot{M}_{\\rm acc}$ ratio.

Exploiting additionally the known scalings\nof the problem reduces the parameter space of initial conditions for one\nspecific perturbation to two dimensions. To this two-dimensional initial\ncondition space we have related the final properties of the perturbed\ntrajectories of the low-mass objects from our numerical simulations. That way,\nmaps showing the effect of the perturbation on the low-mass objects have been\ncreated, which provide a new view on the perturbation process. Comparing the\nmaps for different mass-ratios reveals that the perturbations by low- and\nhigh-mass perturbers are dominated by different physical processes. The\nequal-mass case is a complicated mixture of the other two cases. Since the\nfinal properties of trajectories with similar initial conditions are usually\nalso similar, the results of the limited number of integrated trajectories can\nbe generalised to the full presented parameter space by interpolation. Since\nour results are also unique within the accuracy strived for, they constitute\ngeneral numerical solutions for this subset of the restricted three-body\nproblem.

The situation\nwhere $\\Delta$ and $\\Gamma$ are related appears to reproduce better the\nexperimental observations on the LiHo$_x$Y$_{1-x}$F$_4$ compound, with the\ntheoretical results coinciding qualitatively with measurements of the nonlinear\nsusceptibility. In this later case, by increasing $\\Gamma$, $\\chi_3$ becomes\nprogressively rounded, presenting a maximum at a temperature $T^*$ ($T^*>T_f$).\nMoreover, we also show that the random field is the main responsible for the\nsmearing of the nonlinear susceptibility, acting significantly inside the\nparamagnetic phase, leading to two regimes delimited by the temperature $T^*$,\none for $T_f<T<T^*$, and another one for $T>T^*$. It is argued that the\nconventional paramagnetic state corresponds to $T>T^*$, whereas the temperature\nregion $T_f<T<T^*$ may be characterized by a rather unusual dynamics, possibly\nincluding Griffiths singularities.\n","Comment: accepted for publication in PRB"]}]

To understand their influence, we study the heavily-spotted\nweak-lined T-Tauri star LkCa 4 by searching for spectral signatures of\nradiation originating from the starspot or starspot groups. We introduce a new\nmethodology for constraining both the starspot filling factor and the spot\ntemperature by fitting two-temperature stellar atmosphere models constructed\nfrom Phoenix synthetic spectra to a high-resolution near-IR IGRINS spectrum.\nClearly discernable spectral features arise from both a hot photospheric\ncomponent $T_{\\mathrm{hot}} \\sim4100$ K and to a cool component\n$T_{\\mathrm{cool}} \\sim2700-3000$ K, which covers $\\sim80\\%$ of the visible\nsurface. This mix of hot and cool emission is supported by analyses of the\nspectral energy distribution, rotational modulation of colors and of TiO band\nstrengths, and features in low-resolution optical/near-IR spectroscopy.\nAlthough the revised effective temperature and luminosity make LkCa 4 appear\nmuch younger and lower mass than previous estimates from unspotted stellar\nevolution models, appropriate estimates will require the production and\nadoption of spotted evolutionary models. Biases from starspots likely afflict\nmost fully convective young stars and contribute to uncertainties in ages and\nage spreads of open clusters. In some spectral regions starspots act as a\nfeatureless veiling continuum owing to high rotational broadening and heavy\nline-blanketing in cool star spectra.

We look for\nsigns of late-time H-alpha emission in older Type Ia/Ibc/IIb SNe having\nhydrogen-poor ejecta, via narrow-band imaging. Continuum-subtracted H-alpha\nemission has been detected for 13 point sources: 9 SN Ibc, 1 SN IIb and 3 SN Ia\nevents. Thirty-eight SN sites were observed on at least two epochs, from which\nthree objects (SN 1985F, SN 2005kl, SN 2012fh) showed significant temporal\nvariation in the strength of their H-alpha emission in our DIAFI data. This\nsuggests that the variable emission is probably not due to nearby H II regions\nunassociated with the SN, and hence is an important additional hint that\nejecta-CSM interaction may take place in these systems. Moreover, we\nsuccessfully detected the late-time H-alpha emission from the Type Ib SN 2014C,\nwhich was recently discovered as a strongly interacting SN in various (radio,\ninfrared, optical and X-ray) bands.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 7 figures, accepted in ApJ"]}]

We confirm the mean expansion rate (2011 to\n2015) of 0.58% per year, but large spatial variations are present. Using the\nnonparametric \"Demons\" method, we measure the velocity field throughout the\nentire SNR, finding that motions vary by a factor of 5, from 0.09\" to 0.44\" per\nyear. The slowest shocks are at the outer boundary of the bright northern radio\nrim, with velocities $v_s$ as low as 3,600 km/s (for an assumed distance of 8.5\nkpc), much less than $v_s = 12,000 - 13,000$ km/s along the X-ray-bright major\naxis. Such strong deceleration of the northern blast wave most likely arises\nfrom the collision of SN ejecta with a much denser than average ambient medium\nthere. This asymmetric ambient medium naturally explains the radio asymmetry.\nIn several locations, significant morphological changes and strongly nonradial\nmotions are apparent. The spatially-integrated X-ray flux continues to increase\nwith time. Based on Chandra observations spanning 8.3 years, we measure its\nincrease at 1.3% +/- 0.8% per year.

Instead of the\ntraditional steady, one-dimensional solution, accretion may be episodic and not\nnecessarily symmetrical, thereby affecting the energy deposited inside the star\nand its interior structure. Given this new framework, we want to understand\nwhat controls the evolution of accreting stars. We use the MESA stellar\nevolution code with various sets of conditions.

A comparison of theoretical evolutionary tracks and\nobservations allows us to exclude some cold accretion models ($\\xi\\sim 0$) with\nlow deuterium abundances.

To remedy these issues, we propose a\nnew and complete electronic band theory that assembles the last missing piece -\nthe link between topology and local chemical bonding - with the conventional\nband theory of electrons. Topological Quantum Chemistry is a description of the\nuniversal global properties of all possible band structures and materials\ncomprised of a graph theoretical description of momentum space and a dual group\ntheoretical description in real space. This patches together local\n$\\mathbf{k}\\cdot \\mathbf{p}$ dispersions into distinct global groups of energy\nbands: we classify all the possible bands for all 230 crystal symmetry groups\ninvolving $s, p$ or $d$ orbitals on any of the Wyckoff positions of every space\ngroup. We show how our topological band theory sheds new light on known TIs,\nand demonstrate the power of our method to predict a plethora of new TIs.\n","Comment: 8 pages + 40 pages supplemenetary material.

This paper develops MOD fleet management approaches for ride hailing,\nwhere customers may instead request rides simply by hailing a passing vehicle,\nan approach of particular importance for campus MOD systems. The challenge for\nride hailing is that customer demand is not explicitly provided as it would be\nwith an app, but rather customers are only served if a vehicle happens to be\nlocated at the arrival location. This work focuses on maximizing the number of\nserved hailing customers in an MOD system by learning and utilizing customer\ndemand. A Bayesian framework is used to define a novel customer demand model\nwhich incorporates observed pedestrian traffic to estimate customer arrival\nlocations with a quantification of uncertainty. An exploration planner is\nproposed which routes MOD vehicles in order to reduce arrival rate uncertainty.\nA robust ride hailing fleet management planner is proposed which routes\nvehicles under the presence of uncertainty using a chance-constrained\nformulation. Simulation of a real-world MOD system on MIT's campus demonstrates\nthe effectiveness of the planners.

First, the center-to-limb run of V_los derived from\nground-based low-resolution spectra is simply monotonic with a slightly\nincreasing tendency, which contradicts the specific trend (an appreciable peak\nat theta~45 deg) predicted from RTM. Second, the V_los values derived from a\nlarge number of spectra based on high-resolution space observation revealed to\nfollow a nearly normal distribution, without any sign of peculiar distribution\nexpected for the RTM case. These two observational facts indicate that the\nactual solar velocity field is not such simply dichotomous as assumed in RTM,\nbut directionally more chaotic.

Insider threats\nhave been the cause of other sensitive information leaks too, including the\ninfamous Edward Snowden incident. Most of the recent leaks were in the form of\ntext. Due to the nature of text data, security classifications are assigned\nmanually. In an adversarial environment, insiders can leak texts through\nE-mail, printers, or any untrusted channels. The optimal defense is to\nautomatically detect the unstructured text security class and enforce the\nappropriate protection mechanism without degrading services or daily tasks.\nUnfortunately, existing Data Leak Prevention (DLP) systems are not well suited\nfor detecting unstructured texts. In this paper, we compare two recent\napproaches in the literature for text security classification, evaluating them\non actual sensitive text data from the WikiLeaks dataset.\n","Comment: Pre-print of camera-ready copy accepted to the 2017 IEEE Homeland\n  Security Technologies (HST) conference"]}]

In this paper, a Distributed Antenna Power\nBeacon (DA-PB) based WPT system where these antennas are uniformly distributed\non a circle is analyzed and optimized with the safety electromagnetic radiation\nlevel (SERL) requirement.

First, the minimum antenna height of\nDA-PB is derived to make the radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic radiation\npower density at any location of the charging cell lower than the SERL\npublished by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Second, the\nclosed-form expressions of average harvested Direct Current (DC) power per user\nin the charging cell for pass-loss exponent 2 and 4 are also provided.

Through measurements we show that a location\nclassification accuracy of 100% is achieved when the classes of nodes are\nisolated. When classes are approaching each other, our measurements show that\nwe can still achieve an accuracy of 85%. Furthermore, when the density of the\nGPS nodes is increasing, we can rely on peer-to-peer triangulation and thus\nimprove the possibility of localizing nodes with an error less than 20m from\n20% to more than 60% of the nodes in our measurement scenario. 90% of the nodes\nis localized with an error of less than 50m in our experiment with\nnon-optimized anchor node locations.\n","Comment: Accepted in ICC 17.

Methods - We modelled a standing kink wave in a density-enhanced loop\nwith the three dimensional (3-D), resistive magnetohydrodynamics code, Lare3d.\nWe conducted a parameter study on the viscosity and resistivity coefficients to\nexamine the effects of dissipation on the KHI. Results - Enhancing the\nviscosity and resistivity acts to suppress the KHI. Larger values delay the\nformation of the instability and, in some cases, prevent the onset completely.\nThis leads to the earlier onset of heating for smaller values of the transport\ncoefficients. We note that viscosity has a greater effect on the development of\nthe KHI than resistivity. Furthermore, when using anomalous resistivity, the\nOhmic heating rate associated with the KHI may be greater than that associated\nwith the phase mixing that occurs in an instability-suppressed regime (using\nuniform resistivity). Conclusions - From our study, it is clear that the\nheating rate crucially depends on the formation of small length scales\n(influenced by the numerical resolution) as well as the values of resistivity\nand viscosity. As larger values of the transport coefficients suppress the KHI,\nthe onset of heating is delayed but the heating rate is larger. As increased\nnumerical resolution allows smaller length scales to develop, the heating rate\nwill be higher even for the same transport coefficients.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 12 figures"]}]

The\nearly stages of graphene hydrogenation are accompanied by the evolution of a\nseries of so far undiscovered D-bands ($D_1$-$D_5$).

Their existence and robustness against\nadiabatic changes is deeply related, via a bulk-edge correspondence, to\ntopological properties of the band structure. As it does in the quantum spin\nHall effect, the spin-orbit ensures the existence of a gapped phase without\ninducing any topological transitions. The present work nonetheless shows that\nthis spin-flip process may additionally be responsible for topological\ntransitions, provided the superconducting system has an underlying sublattice\nstructure, as it appears in a dimerized Peierls chain, graphene, and\nphosphorene. These systems, which belong to the Bogoliubov-de Gennes class D,\nare found to have an extra symmetry that plays the role of the parity. It\nenables us to characterize the topology of the particle-hole symmetric band\nstructure in terms of band inversions. The topological phase diagrams this\nleads to are then obtained analytically and exactly. They reveal that, because\nof the underlying sublattice structure, the existence of topological\nsuperconducting phases requires a minimum doping fixed by the strength of the\nRashba spin-orbit. Majorana boundary quasiparticles are then predicted to\nemerge when the Fermi level lies in the vicinity of the bottom (top) of the\nconduction (valence) band in semiconductors like the dimerized Peierls chain\nand phosphorene. In the case of (stretched) graphene, which is semimetallic, it\nturns out that the Majorana quasiparticles cannot emerge at zero and low\ndoping, that is when the Fermi energy is close to the Dirac points. It is\nnevertheless possible to obtain such boundary quasiparticles when the Fermi\nlevel lies in the vicinity of the van Hove singularities.\n"]}]

The\nnew \\mgii~ redshift determination reveals strong blueshifts and asymmetry of\nthe high-ionization emission lines. We estimated a black hole mass of $\\sim\n2.3\\times 10^9 M_\\odot$ and Eddington ratio of $\\sim 1.0$ according to the\nempirical \\mgii-based single-epoch relation and bolometric correction factor.\nIt is possible that strong outflows are the result of an extreme quasar\nenvironment driven by the high Eddington ratio. A lower limit on the outflowing\nkinetic power ($>0.9\\% L_{Edd}$) was derived from both emission and absorption\nlines, indicating these outflows play a significant role in the feedback\nprocess to regulate the growth of its black hole as well as host galaxy\nevolution.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 10 figures.

In the Voronoi method\nthe velocity is supposed to be uniform within the Voronoi polyhedra, whereas\nthe Delaunay method constructs a velocity field by linear interpolation between\nthe four velocities at the locations defining each Delaunay tetrahedron. The\nmost important advantage of these methods is that they provide an optimal\nestimator for determining the statistics of volume-averaged quantities, as\nopposed to the available numerical methods that mainly concern mass-averaged\nquantities. As the major share of the related analytical work on velocity field\nstatistics has focussed on volume-averaged quantities, the availability of\nappropriate numerical estimators is of crucial importance for checking the\nvalidity of the analytical perturbation calculations. In addition, it allows us\nto study the statistics of the velocity field in the highly nonlinear\nclustering regime.

The emphasis is on the\nconsistent treatment of the off-shell motion between collisions and on the\nnon-instant and non-local picture of binary collisions. The resulting kinetic\nequation is of the Boltzmann type, and it represents an interpolation between\nthe theory of transport in metals and the theory of moderately dense gases. The\nfree motion of particles is renormalised by various mean field and mass\ncorrections in the spirit of Landau's quasiparticles in metals. The collisions\nare non-local in the spirit of Enskog's theory of non-ideal gases. The\ncollisions are moreover non-instant, a feature which is absent in the theory of\ngases, but which is shown to be important for dense Fermi systems. In spite of\nits formal complexity, the presented theory has a simple implementation within\nthe Monte-Carlo simulation schemes. Applications in nuclear physics are given\nfor heavy-ion reactions and the results are compared with the former theory and\nrecent experimental data. The effect of the off-shell motion and the non-local\nand non-instant collisions on the dynamics of the system can be characterised\nin terms of thermodynamic functions such as the energy density or the pressure\ntensor. Non-equilibrium counterparts of these functions and the corresponding\nbalance equations are derived and discussed from two points of view. Firstly,\nthey are used to prove the conservation laws. Secondly, the role of individual\nmicroscopic mechanisms in fluxes of particles and momenta and in\ntransformations of the energy is clarified.\n","Comment: Book"]}]
