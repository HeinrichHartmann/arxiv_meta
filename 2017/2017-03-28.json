Recently, a physics-based, nonparametric approach for quantifying\nmodel-form uncertainty in RANS simulations has been proposed, where Reynolds\nstresses are projected to physically meaningful dimensions and perturbations\nare introduced only in the physically realizable limits. However, a challenge\nassociated with this approach is to assess the amount of information introduced\nin the prior distribution and to avoid imposing unwarranted constraints. In\nthis work we propose a random matrix approach for quantifying model-form\nuncertainties in RANS simulations with the realizability of the Reynolds stress\nguaranteed. Furthermore, the maximum entropy principle is used to identify the\nprobability distribution that satisfies the constraints from available\ninformation but without introducing artificial constraints. We demonstrate that\nthe proposed approach is able to ensure the realizability of the Reynolds\nstress, albeit in a different manner from the physics-based approach. Monte\nCarlo sampling of the obtained probability distribution is achieved by using\npolynomial chaos expansion to map independent Gaussian random fields to the\nReynolds stress random field with the marginal distributions and correlation\nstructures as specified. Numerical simulations on a typical flow with\nseparation have shown physically reasonable results, which verifies the\nproposed approach. Therefore, the proposed method is a promising alternative to\nthe physics-based approach for model-form uncertainty quantification of RANS\nsimulations.

Our algorithm consists of two main\nstages. During the first \"off-line\" stage the fine-grid operator (of the graph\nLaplacian type} is partitioned on coarse cells (subdomains). Then\nprojection-type multi-scale reduced order models (ROMs) are computed for the\ncoarse cell operators. The off-line stage is embarrassingly parallel as ROM\ncomputations for the subdomains are independent of each other. It also does not\ndepend on the number of simulated sources (inputs) and it is performed just\nonce before the entire time-domain simulation. At the second \"on-line\" stage\nthe time-domain simulation is performed within the obtained multi-scale ROM\nframework. The crucial feature of our formulation is the representation of the\nROMs in terms of matrix Stieltjes continued fractions (S-fractions). The\nlayered structure of the S-fraction introduces several hidden layers in the ROM\nrepresentation, that results in the block-tridiagonal dynamic system within\neach coarse cell. This allows us to sparsify the obtained multi-scale subdomain\noperator ROMs and to reduce the communications between the adjacent subdomains\nwhich is highly beneficial for a parallel implementation of the on-line stage.\nOur approach suits perfectly the high performance computing architectures,\nhowever in this paper we present rather promising numerical results for a\nserial computing implementation only.

While many attack vectors have already been uncovered,\none important vector has been left out though: attacking the currency via the\nInternet routing infrastructure itself. Indeed, by manipulating routing\nadvertisements (BGP hijacks) or by naturally intercepting traffic, Autonomous\nSystems (ASes) can intercept and manipulate a large fraction of Bitcoin\ntraffic.\n  This paper presents the first taxonomy of routing attacks and their impact on\nBitcoin, considering both small-scale attacks, targeting individual nodes, and\nlarge-scale attacks, targeting the network as a whole. While challenging, we\nshow that two key properties make routing attacks practical: (i) the efficiency\nof routing manipulation; and (ii) the significant centralization of Bitcoin in\nterms of mining and routing. Specifically, we find that any network attacker\ncan hijack few (<100) BGP prefixes to isolate ~50% of the mining power---even\nwhen considering that mining pools are heavily multi-homed. We also show that\non-path network attackers can considerably slow down block propagation by\ninterfering with few key Bitcoin messages.\n  We demonstrate the feasibility of each attack against the deployed Bitcoin\nsoftware. We also quantify their effectiveness on the current Bitcoin topology\nusing data collected from a Bitcoin supernode combined with BGP routing data.\n  The potential damage to Bitcoin is worrying. By isolating parts of the\nnetwork or delaying block propagation, attackers can cause a significant amount\nof mining power to be wasted, leading to revenue losses and enabling a wide\nrange of exploits such as double spending. To prevent such effects in practice,\nwe provide both short and long-term countermeasures, some of which can be\ndeployed immediately.\n","Comment: To appear in the 38th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, May\n  2017"]}]

Efficient pebble\naccretion is likely to be unavoidable in transition disc dust traps, as the\nsize of the dust particles required for pebble accretion are those which are\nmost efficiently trapped in the transition disc dust trap. Rapid pebble\naccretion within the dust trap gives rise, not only to low-mass planets, but to\na large accretion luminosity. This accretion luminosity is sufficient to heat\nthe disc outside the gravitational influence of the planet and makes the disc\nlocally baroclinic, and a source of vorticity. Using numerical simulations we\ndemonstrate that this source of vorticity can lead to the growth of a single\nlarge scale vortex in $\\sim 100$ orbits, which is capable of trapping\nparticles. Finally, we suggest an evolutionary cycle: planet formation proceeds\nthrough pebble accretion, followed by vortex formation and particle trapping in\nthe vortex quenching the planetary accretion and thus removing the vorticity\nsource.

In the many body problem of the Haldane model at\nhalf-filling, we use a linear response approach to demonstrate a circulating\ncurrent around the impurity.

It was shown recently that for gyros\nattached to static observers, their precession frequency became arbitrarily\nlarge in the limit of approach to the ergosurface. For gyros attached to\nstationary observers that move with non-zero angular velocity $\\Omega$, this\ndivergence at the ergosurface can be avoided. Specifically, for such gyros, the\nprecession frequencies diverge on the event horizon of a BH, but are finite and\nregular for NS everywhere except at the singularity itself. Therefore a genuine\ndetection of the event horizon becomes possible in this case. We also show that\nfor a near-extremal NS ($1<a_* < 1.1$), characteristic features appear in the\nradial profiles of the precession frequency, using which we can further\ndistinguish a near-extremal NS from a BH, or even from NS with larger angular\nmomentum.

The LT precession in equatorial circular orbits increases with\napproach to a BH, whereas for NS it increases, attains a peak and then\ndecreases. Interestingly, for $a_*=1.089$, it decreases until it vanishes at a\ncertain radius, and acquires negative values for $a_* > 1.089$ for a certain\nrange of $r$. For $1<a_*<1.089$, a peak appears, but the LT frequency remains\npositive definite. There are important differences in accretion disk LT\nfrequencies for BH and NS and since LT frequencies are intimately related to\nobserved QPOs, these features might allow us to determine whether a given\nrotating compact astrophysical object is BH or NS.\n","Comment: LaTex; 26 pages including 51 figures, thoroughly revised version, new\n  sections and new references added, results and conclusions remain unchanged,\n  accepted for publication in PRD"]}]

One mechanism for doing so is to make use of\nthe experimentally achievable one axis twist spin squeezing in combination with\nunsqueezing which results in the generation of a Schr\\\"odinger cat state\ncorresponding to an equal superposition of the extremal Dicke collective\nstates. However, the protocol for achieving this result critically requires the\nknowledge of whether the total number of atoms is even or odd. Here, we\ndescribe a protocol which employs null detection of one of the collective\nstates that circumvents this problem. Specifically, we show that this detection\nprocess produces fringes that are narrowed by a factor of N with unit\nvisibility when N is even, and yields zero signal when N is odd. Thus, over\nrepeated measurements under which the probability of N being even or odd is\nequal, the signal from the odd cases get filtered out, and HL sensitivity is\nachieved for the $\\sim N/2$ atoms corresponding to the even cases. For all N\natoms, the sensitivity is below the HL by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$.

We demonstrate that Renormalization\nGroup and Asymptotic Freedom imply that in 't Hooft large-N expansion the\nS-matrix in YM is ultraviolet finite, while in both 't Hooft and Veneziano\nlarge-N expansions the S-matrix in confining QCD with massless quarks is\nrenormalizable but not ultraviolet finite. By the same argument it follows that\nthe large-N $\\mathcal{N}=1$ SUSY YM S-matrix is ultraviolet finite as well.\nBesides, we demonstrate that the correlators of local gauge-invariant\noperators, as opposed to the S-matrix, are renormalizable but in general not\nultraviolet finite in the large-N 't Hooft and Veneziano expansions, neither in\npure YM and $\\mathcal{N}=1$ SUSY YM nor a fortiori in massless QCD. Moreover,\nwe compute explicitly the counterterms that arise renormalizing the large-N 't\nHooft and Veneziano expansions, by deriving in confining massless QCD-like\ntheories a low-energy theorem of NSVZ type, that relates the log derivative\nwith respect to the gauge coupling of a $k$-point correlator, or the log\nderivative with respect to the RG-invariant scale, to a $k+1$-point correlator\nwith the insertion of $Tr F^2$ at zero momentum. Finally, we argue that similar\nresults hold in the large-N limit of a vast class of confining QCD-like\ntheories with massive matter fields, provided a renormalization scheme exists,\nas for example $\\overline{MS}$, in which the beta function is independent on\nthe masses. In particular, in both 't Hooft and Veneziano large-N expansions\nthe S-matrix in confining massive QCD and massive $\\mathcal{N}=1$ SUSY QCD is\nrenormalizable but not ultraviolet finite.\n","Comment: 12 pages, latex"]}]

We measure how often users observe retweets in their home\ntimeline, and observe a phenomenon that we term the \"Impressions Paradox\": the\nshare of impressions for cascades of size k decays much slower than frequency\nof cascades of size k. Thus, the audience for cascades can be quite large even\nfor rare large cascades. We also measure audience engagement with retweet\ncascades in comparison to non-retweeted content. Our results show that cascades\noften rival or exceed organic content in engagement received per impression.\nThis result is perhaps surprising in that consumers didn't opt in to see tweets\nfrom these authors. Furthermore, although cascading content is widely popular,\none would expect it to eventually reach parts of the audience that may not be\ninterested in the content. Motivated by our findings, we posit a theoretical\nmodel that focuses on the effect of cascades on the audience.

Given these challenges, a natural approach\nis to instead use structural network features for the task, produced by {\\em\ncombining} the strong and \"weak\" edges. In this work, we demonstrate via\nexperiments on Twitter data that using only such structural network features is\nsufficient for detecting strong ties with high precision. These structural\nnetwork features are obtained from the presence and frequency of small network\nmotifs on combined strong and weak ties. We observe that using motifs larger\nthan triads alleviate sparsity problems that arise for smaller motifs, both due\nto increased combinatorial possibilities as well as benefiting strongly from\nsearching beyond the ego network. Empirically, we observe that not all motifs\nare equally useful, and need to be carefully constructed from the combined\nedges in order to be effective for strong tie detection. Finally, we reinforce\nour experimental findings with providing theoretical justification that\nsuggests why incorporating these larger sized motifs as features could lead to\nincreased performance in planted graph models.\n","Comment: To appear in Proceedings of WWW 2017 (Web-science track)"]}]

In particular, the ratios of the\nassociated partial decay widths, which contain both kinematical factors and the\ncouplings, are found to be around $\\Gamma [a_0(980)\\rightarrow \\pi \\eta]/\\Gamma\n[a_0(1450)\\rightarrow \\pi \\eta] = 2.51-2.54$, $\\Gamma [a_0(980)\\rightarrow\nK\\bar{K}]/\\Gamma [a_0(1450)\\rightarrow K\\bar{K}] = 0.52-0.89$, which seems to\nagree with the experimental ratios reasonably well. This agreement can be\ninterpreted as the tetraquark signatures for $a_0(980), a_0(1450)$.\n","Comment: 6 pages, no figures, substantially revised, some references are added"]}]

Existing methods decouple these decisions,\nforgoing optimality for tractability. We propose a new optimization approach to\njointly determine the beacon placement and inference algorithm. We model\ninference as a neural network and incorporate beacon placement as a\ndifferentiable neural layer. This formulation allows us to optimize placement\nand inference by jointly training the inference network and beacon layer. We\nevaluate our method on different localization problems and demonstrate\nperformance that exceeds hand-crafted baselines.\n"]}]

Our method is to exhaustively examine all possible\nintersections---this is much faster than it sounds, because we do not need to\nexamine all $\\binom Ns$ subsets in order to find all possible intersection\nrectangles.

We then fit the data by a\nmodel with two components in which one has the gap function of\n$\\Delta_0(1+\\alpha cos2\\theta)$. To have a good global fitting and the entropy\nconservation for the low temperature transition, we reach a conclusion that the\ngap minimum should be smaller than 0.15 meV ($\\alpha$ = 0.9 to 1), indicating\nthat the superconducting gap(s) are highly anisotropic.

One important issue in MT\nis that how to evaluate the MT system reasonably and tell us whether the\ntranslation system makes an improvement or not. The traditional manual judgment\nmethods are expensive, time-consuming, unrepeatable, and sometimes with low\nagreement. On the other hand, the popular automatic MT evaluation methods have\nsome weaknesses. Firstly, they tend to perform well on the language pairs with\nEnglish as the target language, but weak when English is used as source.\nSecondly, some methods rely on many additional linguistic features to achieve\ngood performance, which makes the metric unable to replicate and apply to other\nlanguage pairs easily. Thirdly, some popular metrics utilize incomprehensive\nfactors, which result in low performance on some practical tasks. In this\nthesis, to address the existing problems, we design novel MT evaluation methods\nand investigate their performances on different languages. Firstly, we design\naugmented factors to yield highly accurate evaluation.Secondly, we design a\ntunable evaluation model where weighting of factors can be optimised according\nto the characteristics of languages.

But what are the reasons for this\nphenomenon? Is it that such relations are more convenient and easier to\nmaintain? Or are there also some more tangible benefits to be gained from this\ncollective behaviour?\n  The current work takes a game-theoretic perspective on this phenomenon, and\nstudies the conditions under which different assortative mixing strategies lead\nto equilibrium in an evolving social network. We focus on a biased preferential\nattachment model where the strategy of each group (e.g., political or social\nminority) determines the level of bias of its members toward other group\nmembers and non-members. Our first result is that if the utility function that\nthe group attempts to maximize is the degree centrality of the group,\ninterpreted as the sum of degrees of the group members in the network, then the\nonly strategy achieving Nash equilibrium is a perfect homophily, which implies\nthat cooperation with other groups is harmful to this utility function. A\nsecond, and perhaps more surprising, result is that if a reward for inter-group\ncooperation is added to the utility function (e.g., externally enforced by an\nauthority as a regulation), then there are only two possible equilibria,\nnamely, perfect homophily or perfect heterophily, and it is possible to\ncharacterize their feasibility spaces.

A significant\nheterogeneity is observed in the aggregate structures and in the thermodynamics\nof aggregation for systems of different HP sequences and different number of\npeptides. Fibril-like ordered aggregates are found for several sequences that\ncontain the common HPH pattern while other sequences may form helix bundles or\ndisordered aggregates.

The transition is found to be the most cooperative\nand first-order like for sequences forming fibril-like structures.

Two fundamental challenges in it are visual-semantic embedding and\ndomain adaptation in cross-modality learning and unseen class prediction steps,\nrespectively. To address both challenges, this paper presents two corresponding\nmethods named Adaptive STructural Embedding (ASTE) and Self-PAsed Selective\nStrategy (SPASS), respectively. Specifically, ASTE formulates the\nvisualsemantic interactions in a latent structural SVM framework to adaptively\nadjust the slack variables to embody the different reliableness among training\ninstances. In this way, the reliable instances are imposed with small\npunishments, wheras the less reliable instances are imposed with more severe\npunishments. Thus, it ensures a more discriminative embedding. On the other\nhand, SPASS offers a framework to alleviate the domain shift problem in ZSL,\nwhich exploits the unseen data in an easy to hard fashion.

A shift\nof about 7 GeV from the original power law p^{-6} production cross section in\npp explains well all the observed R_{AA} dependencies. The shift of about 7 GeV\nis also valid at RHIC energy, where the cross section follows a power law with\nabout p^{-8} and this shift explains a very slow rise of R_{AA} seen for\nneutral pions with p_t above 15 GeV/c.

This problem is known\nto be NP-hard in general. Our contribution is two fold: a polyhedral\ncharacterization and an approximation algorithm. Previously Chen et al. have\nshown that the stable matching polytope is integral if and only if the subgraph\nobtained after running phase one of Irving's algorithm is bipartite. We improve\nupon this result by showing that there are instances where this subgraph might\nnot be bipartite but one can further eliminate some edges and arrive at a\nbipartite subgraph. Our elimination procedure ensures that the set of stable\nmatchings remains the same, and thus the stable matching polytope of the final\nsubgraph contains the incidence vectors of all stable matchings of our original\ngraph. This allows us to characterize a larger class of instances for which the\nweighted stable matching problem is polynomial-time solvable. We also show that\nour edge elimination procedure is best possible, meaning that if the subgraph\nwe arrive at is not bipartite, then there is no bipartite subgraph that has the\nsame set of stable matchings as the original graph. We complement these results\nwith a $2$-approximation algorithm for the minimum weight stable matching\nproblem for instances where each agent has at most two possible partners in any\nstable matching. This is the first approximation result for any class of\ninstances with general weights.\n","Comment: This is an extended version of a paper to appear at the The Fourth\n  International Workshop on Matching Under Preferences (MATCH-UP 2017)"]}]

The mathematical error analysis is shown\nrigorously by an image representation of the Sommerfeld spectral form of the\ndomain Green's function. As a result, in the H-FMM algorithm, both the\n\"multipole-to-multipole\" and \"local-to-local\" translation operators are the\nsame as those in the free-space case, allowing easy adaptation of existing\nfree-space FMM.

These methods naturally\nfacilitate tractable uncertainty quantification and incorporation of prior\ninformation. A common feature of these models, including the Bayesian lasso,\nglobal-local shrinkage priors, and spike-and-slab priors is that the\ncorresponding priors on the regression coefficients can be expressed as scale\nmixture of normals. While the three-step Gibbs sampler used to sample from the\noften intractable associated posterior density has been shown to be\ngeometrically ergodic for several of these models (Khare and Hobert, 2013; Pal\nand Khare, 2014), it has been demonstrated recently that convergence of this\nsampler can still be quite slow in modern high-dimensional settings despite\nthis apparent theoretical safeguard. We propose a new method to draw from the\nsame posterior via a tractable two-step blocked Gibbs sampler. We demonstrate\nthat our proposed two-step blocked sampler exhibits vastly superior convergence\nbehavior compared to the original three- step sampler in high-dimensional\nregimes on both real and simulated data. We also provide a detailed theoretical\nunderpinning to the new method in the context of the Bayesian lasso. First, we\nderive explicit upper bounds for the (geometric) rate of convergence.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate theoretically that while the original Bayesian\nlasso chain is not Hilbert-Schmidt, the proposed chain is trace class (and\nhence Hilbert-Schmidt). The trace class property has useful theoretical and\npractical implications. It implies that the corresponding Markov operator is\ncompact, and its eigenvalues are summable. It also facilitates a rigorous\ncomparison of the two-step blocked chain with \"sandwich\" algorithms which aim\nto improve performance of the two-step chain by inserting an inexpensive extra\nstep.\n"]}]

These responses measure the impact of long-wavelength\nperturbations on the local small-scale power spectrum. The kinematic structure\nof the responses (i.e., their angular dependence) can be decomposed\nunambiguously through a \"bias\" expansion of the local power spectrum, with a\nfixed number of physical response coefficients, which are only a function of\nthe hard wavenumber $k$. Further, the responses up to $n$-th order completely\ndescribe the $(n+2)$-point function in the squeezed limit, i.e. with two hard\nand $n$ soft modes, which one can use to derive the response coefficients. This\ngeneralizes previous results, which relate the angle-averaged squeezed limit to\nisotropic response coefficients. We derive the complete expression of first-\nand second-order responses at leading order in perturbation theory, and present\nextrapolations to nonlinear scales based on simulation measurements of the\nisotropic response coefficients. As an application, we use these results to\npredict the non-Gaussian part of the angle-averaged matter power spectrum\ncovariance ${\\rm Cov}^{\\rm NG}_{\\ell = 0}(k_1,k_2)$, in the limit where one of\nthe modes, say $k_2$, is much smaller than the other. Without any free\nparameters, our model results are in very good agreement with simulations for\n$k_2 \\lesssim 0.06\\ h/{\\rm Mpc}$, and for any $k_1 \\gtrsim 2 k_2$. The\nwell-defined kinematic structure of the power spectrum response also permits a\nquick evaluation of the angular dependence of the covariance matrix. While we\nfocus on the matter density field, the formalism presented here can be\ngeneralized to generic tracers such as galaxies.\n","Comment: 28 pages + appendices and references. 5 figures.

The consensus opinion has upheld the QZE as a\ngeneral feature of quantum mechanics, which should lead to the inhibition of\nany decay. The claim of QZE generality hinges on the assumption that successive\nobservations can in principle be made at time intervals too short for the\nsystem to change appreciably. However, this assumption and the generality of\nthe QZE have scarcely been investigated thus far. We have addressed these\nissues by showing that (i) the QZE is principally unattainable in radiative or\nradioactive decay, because the required measurement rates would cause the\nsystem to disintegrate; (ii) decay acceleration by frequent measurements (the\nanti-Zeno effect -- AZE) is much more ubiquitous than its inhibition. The AZE\nis shown to be observable as the enhancement of tunneling rates (e.g., for\natoms trapped in ramped-up potentials or in current-swept Josephson junctions),\nfluorescence rates (e.g., for Rydberg atoms perturbed by noisy optical fields)\nand photon depolarization rates (in randomly modulated Pockels cells).\n","Comment: 8 pages, 13 figures, 1 table; revised version.

The reservoir is described by\na complex Gaussian-Markovian field coupled to the nondiagonal elements of the\nTLS Hamiltonian. The theory can be relevant for electromagnetic interactions in\nmicrowave high-$Q$ cavities and muon spin depolarization. Analytical results\nare obtained for the strong-coupling regime, $\\Omega_0\\gg\\nu$, where $\\Omega_0$\nis the rms coupling amplitude (Rabi frequency) and $\\nu$ is the width of the\nreservoir spectrum. In this regime, the population difference and half of the\ninitial coherence decay with two characteristic rates: the most part of the\ndecay occurs at $t\\sim\\Omega_0^{-1}$, the relaxation being reversible for\n$t\\ll(\\Omega_0^2\\nu)^{-1/3}$, whereas for $t\\gg(\\Omega_0^2\\nu)^{-1/3}$ the\nrelaxation becomes irreversible and is practically over. The other half of the\ncoherence decays with the rate on the order of $\\nu$, which may be slower by\norders of magnitude than the time scale of the population relaxation.
