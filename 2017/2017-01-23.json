We observe\nvery strong second-order assortative mixing in social networks, often\nsignificantly stronger than the first-order assortative mixing. This suggests\nthat if two people interact in a social network, then the importance of the\nmost prominent person each knows is very likely to be the same. This is also\ntrue if we measure the average prominence of neighbours of the two people. This\nproperty is weaker or negative in non-social networks.

In this paper we present\nconvergence results for constrained versions of ETD($\\lambda$) with constant\nstepsize and with diminishing stepsize from a broad range. Our results\ncharacterize the asymptotic behavior of the trajectory of iterates produced by\nthose algorithms, and are derived by combining key properties of ETD($\\lambda$)\nwith powerful convergence theorems from the weak convergence methods in\nstochastic approximation theory. For the case of constant stepsize, in addition\nto analyzing the behavior of the algorithms in the limit as the stepsize\nparameter approaches zero, we also analyze their behavior for a fixed stepsize\nand bound the deviations of their averaged iterates from the desired solution.\nThese results are obtained by exploiting the weak Feller property of the Markov\nchains associated with the algorithms, and by using ergodic theorems for weak\nFeller Markov chains, in conjunction with the convergence results we get from\nthe weak convergence methods. Besides ETD($\\lambda$), our analysis also applies\nto the off-policy TD($\\lambda$) algorithm, when the divergence issue is avoided\nby setting $\\lambda$ sufficiently large.\n","Comment: Minor edits; 53 pages.

For example, in the well-studied Colonel Blotto game\n(introduced by Borel in 1921), players must divide a pool of troops among a set\nof battlefields with the goal of winning (i.e., having more troops in) a\nmajority. The Colonel Blotto game is commonly used for analyzing a wide range\nof applications from the U.S presidential election, to innovative technology\ncompetitions, to advertisement, to sports. However, because of the size of the\nstrategy space, standard methods for computing equilibria of zero-sum games\nfail to be computationally feasible. Indeed, despite its importance, only a few\nsolutions for special variants of the problem are known.\n  In this paper we show how to compute equilibria of Colonel Blotto games.\n  Moreover, our approach takes the form of a general reduction: to find a Nash\nequilibrium of a zero-sum game, it suffices to design a separation oracle for\nthe strategy polytope of any bilinear game that is payoff-equivalent. We then\napply this technique to obtain the first polytime algorithms for a variety of\ngames. In addition to Colonel Blotto, we also show how to compute equilibria in\nan infinite-strategy variant called the General Lotto game; this involves\nshowing how to prune the strategy space to a finite subset before applying our\nreduction. We also consider the class of dueling games, first introduced by\nImmorlica et al. (2011). We show that our approach provably extends the class\nof dueling games for which equilibria can be computed: we introduce a new\ndueling game, the matching duel, on which prior methods fail to be\ncomputationally feasible but upon which our reduction can be applied.\n","Comment: Conference version at\n  http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI16/paper/download/12163/11607"]}]

These results then indicate the easy controllability of chaotic\noscillators by an external chaotic system, thereby suggesting a potent method\nthat may help design control strategies.\n"]}]

Both problems are nontrivial when a small\nfraction of the nodes in the network can be used to achieve the desired goal.\nThe minimization problem is equivalent to a structural optimization. The\n\"superblockers\", i.e., the nodes that should be removed from the network to\nminimize the size of outbreaks, are those nodes that make connected components\nas small as possible. \"Superspreaders\" are instead the nodes such that, if\nchosen as initiators, they maximize the average size of outbreaks. The identity\nof superspreaders is expected to depend not just on the topology, but also on\nthe specific dynamics considered. Recently, it has been conjectured that the\ntwo optimization problems might be equivalent, in the sense that superblockers\nact also as superspreaders. In spite of its potential groundbreaking\nimportance, no empirical study has been performed to validate this conjecture.\nIn this paper, we perform an extensive analysis over a large set of real-world\nnetworks to test the similarity between sets of superblockers and of\nsuperspreaders.

Modification of intermolecular\ninteractions and molecule-substrate interactions influences the assembly\ndrastically and 2D materials can also be used as a platform to carry out\ncovalent and metal-coordinated assembly. The second part deals with the\nelectronic properties of molecules adsorbed on 2D materials.

The power\nspectra analysis revealed that the atmosphere sampled in our observation\n(excluding the NEB region) is in a 2-D turbulent regime and its dynamics are\npredominately governed by the shallow water equations. The GRS is also very\nprominent and has a noticeable meridional asymmetry and we compare it, and\nnearby storms, with optical images.

The trade in second-hand tires has been implicated as a\nfactor in this process as they act as mobile reservoirs of mosquito eggs and\nlarvae. Regional transportation of tires can create linkages between rural\nareas with dengue to disease-free urban areas, potentially giving rise to\noutbreaks even in areas with strong local control measures. In this work we\nsought to model the dynamics of mosquito transportation via the tire trade, in\nparticular to predict its role in causing unexpected dengue outbreaks through\nvertical transmission of the virus across generations of mosquitoes. We also\naimed to identify strategies for regulating the trade in second-hand tires,\nimproving disease control. We created a mathematical model which captures the\ndynamics of dengue between rural and urban areas, taking into account the\nmovement, storage time of tires, and mosquito diapause. We simulate a series of\nscenarios. First a mosquito population is introduced to a dengue-free area via\nmovement of tires, either as single or multiple events, increasing the\nlikelihood of a dengue outbreak. An endemic state can be induced regardless of\nwhether urban conditions for an outbreak are met, and an existing endemic state\ncan be enhanced by vector input. Finally we assess the potential for regulation\nof tire processing as a means of reducing the transmission of dengue fever\nusing a specific case study from Puerto Rico. Our work demonstrates the\nimportance of the second-hand tire trade in modulating the spread of dengue\nfever across regions, in particular its role in introducing dengue to\ndisease-free areas. We propose that regulation of tire storage and movement can\nplay a crucial role in containing outbreaks and dengue spread.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 7 figures"]}]

The arch shape is reproduced by the\nsimulations, which assume a smooth surface. However, surface roughness on the\nscale of the particles, such as the Hapke and van Horn (1963) fairy castles\nthat can spontaneously form when sprinkling a fine powder, leads to monotonic\nreddening. A further consequence of this form of microscopic roughness (being\nindistinct without the use of a microscope) is a flattening of the disk\nfunction at visible wavelengths, i.e. Lommel-Seeliger-type scattering. The\nexperiments further reveal monotonic reddening for reflectance ratios at\nnear-IR wavelengths.
