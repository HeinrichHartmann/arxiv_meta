As classical reversible gates are essentially\npermutation gates, above statistics is strictly valid for classical reversible\ngates, but the argument can be easily extended to include quantum gates and to\nestablish that the majority of the quantum gates are also non-self-inverse.\nFurther, the % of genuinely 2-bit reversible gates (i.e., 2-bit gates that\ncannot be decomposed as a product of two single bit gates) among all possible\ngates has been computed as 83.3%, and the applicability of this analysis in the\noptimization of circuit cost is discussed.\n","Comment: 8 pages, no figure"]}]

We employ\nthese tools to derive price of anarchy results for social welfare and revenue.\nOur approach separates the standard smoothness framework into two distinct\nparts, isolating the analysis common to any auction from the analysis specific\nto a given auction. The first part relates a bidder's contribution to welfare\nin equilibrium to their contribution to welfare in the optimal auction using\nthe price the bidder faces for additional allocation. Intuitively, either an\nagent's utility and hence contribution to welfare is high, or the price she has\nto pay for additional allocation is high relative to her value. We call this\ncondition value covering; it holds in every Bayes-Nash equilibrium of any\nauction. The second part, revenue covering, relates the prices bidders face for\nadditional allocation to the revenue of the auction, using an auction's rules\nand feasibility constraints. Combining the two parts gives approximation\nresults to the optimal welfare, and, under the right conditions, the optimal\nrevenue. In mechanisms with reserve prices, our welfare results show\napproximation with respect to the optimal mechanism with the same reserves.\n  As a center-piece result, we analyze the single-item first-price auction with\nindividual monopoly reserves. When each distribution satisfies a regularity\ncondition the auction's revenue is at least a $2e/(e-1) \\approx 3.16$\napproximation to the revenue of the optimal auction.

In the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a trial\nmove to a region of lower target density, equivalently \"higher energy\", than\nthe current state can be rejected with positive probability. In this\nalternative approach, a particle moves along straight lines continuously around\nthe space and, when facing a high energy barrier, it is not rejected but its\npath is modified by bouncing against this barrier. The resulting non-reversible\nMarkov process provides a rejection-free MCMC sampling scheme.

IBFD self-backhauling in a HetNet refers to\nIBFD-enabled small cells backhauling themselves with macro cells over the\nwireless channel. Owing to their IBFD capability, the small cells\nsimultaneously communicate over the access and backhaul links, using the same\nfrequency band. The idea is doubly advantageous, as it obviates the need for\nfiber backhauling small cells every hundred meters and allows the access\nspectrum to be reused for backhauling at no extra cost. This work considers the\ncase of a two-tier cellular network with IBFD-enabled small cells, wirelessly\nbackhauling themselves with conventional macro cells. For clear exposition, the\ncase considered is that of FDD network, where within access and backhaul links,\nthe downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) are frequency duplexed ($f1$, $f2$\nrespectively), while the total frequency spectrum used at access and backhaul\n($f1+f2$) is the same.

In order to\nidentify their dynamical properties and/or their topology consistently from\nmeasured data, we need to make sure that the network model set is identifiable.\nWe introduce the notion of network identifiability, as a property of a\nparameterized model set, that ensures that different network models can be\ndistinguished from each other when performing identification on the basis of\nmeasured data. Different from the classical notion of (parameter)\nidentifiability, we focus on the distinction between network models in terms of\ntheir transfer functions. Network identifiability allows to study the\nstructural aspects of network models, reflected in prior information on modules\nbeing present or not. For a given structured model set, identifiability\ntypically requires conditions on the presence and location of excitation\nsignals, and on presence, location and correlation of disturbance signals.\nBecause in a dynamic network, disturbances cannot always be considered to be of\nfull-rank, the reduced-rank situation is also covered, meaning that the number\nof driving white noise processes can be strictly less than the number of\ndisturbance variables. This includes the situation of having noise-free nodes.\n","Comment: Submitted for publication in Automatica"]}]

In this scheme, the enclosure acts as a mediator. The strong\ncoupling permits the excitation of the non-bonding mode with high purity.

Recently, the Partial\nInformation Decomposition (PID) was proposed to decompose mutual information\n(MI) about a target variable into components which are redundant, unique and\nsynergistic within different subsets of predictor variables. Here, we propose\nto apply the elegant formalism of the PID to multivariate entropy, resulting in\na Partial Entropy Decomposition (PED). We implement the PED with an entropy\nredundancy measure based on pointwise common surprisal; a natural definition\nwhich is closely related to the definition of MI. We show how this approach can\nreveal the dyadic vs triadic generative structure of multivariate systems that\nare indistinguishable with classical Shannon measures. The entropy perspective\nalso shows that misinformation is synergistic entropy and hence that MI itself\nincludes both redundant and synergistic effects. We show the relationships\nbetween the PED and MI in two predictors, and derive two alternative\ninformation decompositions which we illustrate on several example systems. This\nreveals that in entropy terms, univariate predictor MI is not a proper subset\nof the joint MI, and we suggest this previously unrecognised fact explains in\npart why obtaining a consistent PID has proven difficult.

In particular, the set of nodes that correspond to\nlarge components of the leading eigenvector of the adjacency matrix determines\nthe onset of bistability. Above this transition, the eigenvectors of the\nadjacency matrix determine a hierarchy of clusters, defined by its spectral\nproperties, which are activated sequentially with increasing network activity.\nWe argue further that the onset of bistability occurs either continuously or\ndiscontinuously depending upon whether the leading eigenvector is localized or\ndelocalized.

Two challenges\nfaced by the coordinator are a finite budget from which to allocate incentives,\nand an initial lack of knowledge about the utility function of the agents.\nHere, we present a behavioral analytics approach to solve the coordinator's\nproblem when agents make decisions by maximizing utility functions that depend\non prior system states, inputs, and other parameters that are initially unknown\nand subject to temporal dynamics. Our behavioral analytics framework involves\nthree steps: first, we develop a behavioral model that describes the\ndecision-making process of an agent; second, we use data to estimate behavioral\nmodel parameters for each agent and then use these estimates to predict future\ndecisions of each agent; and third, we use the estimated behavioral model\nparameters to optimize a set of costly incentives to provide to each agent. In\nthis paper, we describe a specific set of tools, models, and approaches that\nfit into this framework, and that adapt models and incentives as new\ninformation is collected by repeating the second and third steps of this\nframework. Furthermore, we prove that incentives computed by this adaptive\napproach are asymptotically optimal with respect to a given loss function that\ndescribes the coordinator's objective. We optimize incentives using a\ndecomposition scheme, where each sub-problem solves the coordinator's problem\nfor a single agent, and the master problem is a pure integer program.

The symmetry\nof these features points to lensing by an intervening object as the cause.\nU-shaped events in radio light curves in the cm-wave band have previously been\nattributed to Extreme scattering events (ESE). ESEs are thought to be the\nresult of lensing by compact plasma structures in the Galactic interstellar\nmedium, but the precise nature of these plasma structures remains unknown.\nSince the strength of a plasma lens evolves with wavelength $\\lambda$ as\n$\\lambda^2$, the presence of correlated variations at over a wide wavelength\nrange casts doubt on the canonical ESE interpretation for J1415+1320. In this\npaper, we critically examine the evidence for plasma lensing in J1415+1320. We\ncompute limits on the lensing strength, and the associated free-free opacity of\nthe putative plasma lenses. We compare the observed and model ESE light curves,\nand also derive a lower limit on the lens distance based on the effects of\nparallax due to the Earth's orbit around the Sun. We conclude that plasma\nlensing is not a viable interpretation for J1415+1320's light curves and that\nsymmetric U-shaped features in the radio light curves of extragalactic sources\ndo not present {\\em prima facie} evidence for ESEs.

These simplifications usually rely on\nso-called redundancy properties that characterize cases in which the removal of\na clause does not affect the satisfiability status of a formula. A particularly\nsuccessful redundancy property is that of blocked clauses, because it\ngeneralizes several other redundancy properties. To find out whether a clause\nis blocked---and therefore redundant---one only needs to consider its\nresolution environment, i.e., the clauses with which it can be resolved. For\nthis reason, the redundancy property of blocked clauses is said to be local. In\nthis paper, we show that there exist local redundancy properties that are even\nmore general than blocked clauses.

Recently, neural-network based methods have been proposed\nfor learning this representation from large corpora. This type of\nword-to-vector embedding is able to keep, in the learned vector space, some of\nthe syntactic and semantic relationships present in the original word corpus.\nThis, in turn, serves to address different types of language classification\ntasks by doing algebraic operations defined on the vectors. The general\npractice is to assume that the semantic relationships between the words can be\ninferred by the application of a-priori specified algebraic operations. Our\ngeneral goal in this paper is to show that it is possible to learn methods for\nword composition in semantic spaces. Instead of expressing the compositional\nmethod as an algebraic operation, we will encode it as a program, which can be\nlinear, nonlinear, or involve more intricate expressions. More remarkably, this\nprogram will be evolved from a set of initial random programs by means of\ngenetic programming (GP). We show that our method is able to reproduce the same\nbehavior as human-designed algebraic operators. Using a word analogy task as\nbenchmark, we also show that GP-generated programs are able to obtain accuracy\nvalues above those produced by the commonly used human-designed rule for\nalgebraic manipulation of word vectors.

Substantial\nimprovements in phylogenetic inference and model fit were achieved by\naugmenting these models with a set of multiplicative random effects that\nallowed different sites to evolve at different rates which scaled the baseline\nrate matrix. Motivated by this pioneering work, we consider an extension which\nallows quadratic, rather than linear, site-specific transformations of the\nbaseline rate matrix.\n  We derive properties of the resulting process and show that when combined\nwith a particular class of non-stationary models, we obtain one that allows\nsequence composition to vary across both sites of the alignment and taxa.\nFormulating the model in a Bayesian framework, a Markov chain Monte Carlo\nalgorithm for posterior inference is described. We consider two applications to\nalignments concerning the tree of life, fitting stationary and non-stationary\nmodels. In each case we compare inferences obtained under our site-specific\nquadratic transformation, with those under linear and site-homogeneous models.\n","Comment: 7 figures, 1 table"]}]

The\nCHP will therefore switch on at moments of high electricity prices.\nNevertheless, since there never is a perfect match between the demand of heat\nand the demand of electricity, a thermal energy storage is included in the\nnetwork to overcome the difference between supply and demand of heat in the\nnetwork.

AR upflows typically fan away from the AR\ncore by 40 deg. to near vertical for the following polarity. The span of\ninclination angles is more spread for the leading polarity with flows angled\nfrom -29 deg. (inclined towards the AR center) to 28 deg. (directed away from\nthe AR).

Further, line widths are correlated with Doppler velocities only for\nthe few ARs having the largest velocities. We conclude that for the line widths\nto be affected by the solar rotation, the spatial gradient of the upflow\nvelocities must be large enough such that the line broadening exceeds the\nthermal line width of Fe XII.

A particularly difficult problem in experimental and numerical\nsimulation studies of the problem is how to distinguish the effects of AR from\nthose originating from Hall-effect and other non-turbulent processes in the\ngeneralized Ohm's. In this paper, using particle-in-cell simulations, we\npresent a case study of how AR produced by Buneman Instability accelerates\nmagnetic reconnection. We first show that in a thin current layer, the AR\nproduced by Buneman instability spontaneously breaks the magnetic field lines\nand causes impulsive fast non-Hall magnetic line annihilation on\nelectron-scales with a rate reaching 0.6~$V_A$. However, the electron-scale\nmagnetic line annihilation is not a necessary condition for the dissipation of\nmagnetic energy, but rather a result of the inhomogeneity of the AR. On the\nother hand, the inhomogeneous drag arising from a Buneman instability driven by\nthe intense electron beams at the x-line in a 3D magnetic reconnection can\ndrive in the electron diffusion region electron-scale magnetic line\nannihilation. The electron-scale annihilations play an essential role in\naccelerating the magnetic reconnection with a rate two times faster than the\nnon-turbulent Hall-dominated 2D magnetic reconnection. The reconnection rate is\nenhanced around the x-line, and the coupling between the AR carried out by the\nreconnection outflow and the Hall effect leads to the breaking of the symmetric\nstructure of the ion diffusion region and the enhancement of the outward\nPoynting flux.\n","Comment: submitted to Physics of Plasma"]}]

We quantify the number of mmWave (60 GHz) service antennas\nthat are needed to duplicate the performance of a specified number of PCS (1.9\nGHz) service antennas. As a baseline we consider a modest PCS deployment of 128\nantennas serving 18 terminals.

To\nmatch the total antenna area of the PCS array would require 128000\nhalf-wavelength mmWave antennas, but a much reduced number is adequate because\nthe large number of antennas also confers greater channel orthogonality.
