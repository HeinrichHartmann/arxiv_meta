In order to avoid the requirement for\ncell lines expressing fluorescent markers and the associated phototoxicity,\nphase contrast microscopy is often preferred over fluorescence microscopy in\nlive-cell imaging. However, common specific image characteristics complicate\nimage processing and impede use of standard methods. Nevertheless, automated\nanalysis is desirable due to manual analysis being subjective, biased and\nextremely time-consuming for large data sets. Here, we present the following\nworkflow based on mathematical imaging methods. In the first step, mitosis\ndetection is performed by means of the circular Hough transform. The obtained\ncircular contour subsequently serves as an initialisation for the tracking\nalgorithm based on variational methods. It is sub-divided into two parts: in\norder to determine the beginning of the whole mitosis cycle, a backwards\ntracking procedure is performed. After that, the cell is tracked forwards in\ntime until the end of mitosis. As a result, the average of mitosis duration and\nratios of different cell fates (cell death, no division, division into two or\nmore daughter cells) can be measured and statistics on cell morphologies can be\nobtained.

This is\nbecause an additional contact related to the p-wave effective range needs to be\nintroduced, besides the one related to the scattering volume as originally\nconsidered by Shina Tan in the s-wave case. It has been found that if one tries\nto define the contacts according to Tan's adiabatic relations, the subleading\ntail of the large-momentum distribution can not fully be captured, and an extra\nterm is involved resulted from the c.m. motions of the pairs, which should be a\ngeneral feature of strongly interacting Fermi gases near p-wave resonances.

In this work, we systematically investigate the full set of p-wave\nuniversal relations of a 2D spin-polarized Fermi gas. We define the p-wave\ncontacts according to the adiabatic relations. The leading behavior of the\nlarge-momentum distribution ($k^{-2}$) is fully captured by the contact related\nto the scattering area, while the extra c.m. term appears in the subleading\ntail ($k^{-4}$) besides the contact related to the effective range, as we\nanticipate.

Fortunately, we find all the other universal relations, such as the\nhigh-frequency behavior of the radio-frequency response etc., remain unaffected\nby the c.m. motions of the pairs, and are fully governed by the contacts\ndefined by the adiabatic relations.

Akin to\nexisting approaches on the problem, our framework builds on low-level features\nwhich allow partial matching between images. For each local feature in the\nquery image, we find its approximate nearest neighbors in the reference set.\nNext, we cluster the features from reference images using Dominant Set\nclustering, which affords several advantages over existing approaches. First,\nit permits variable number of nodes in the cluster which we use to dynamically\nselect the number of nearest neighbors (typically coming from multiple\nreference images) for each query feature based on its discrimination value.\nSecond, as we also quantify in our experiments, this approach is several orders\nof magnitude faster than existing approaches. Thus, we obtain multiple clusters\n(different local maximizers) and obtain a robust final solution to the problem\nusing multiple weak solutions through constrained Dominant Set clustering on\nglobal image features, where we enforce the constraint that the query image\nmust be included in the cluster. This second level of clustering also bypasses\nheuristic approaches to voting and selecting the reference image that matches\nto the query.

The discriminant group of this action is an\nobstruction to this action being homogeneous. The discriminant vanishes if the\ngroup $G$ is abelian, but there are examples of actions of nilpotent groups for\nwhich the discriminant is non-trivial.

If the discriminant group never stabilizes\nas the diameter of the clopen set $U$ tends to zero, then we say that the\naction is unstable, and the weak solenoid which defines it is said to be wild.\nIn this work, we show two main results in the course of our study of the\nproperties of the discriminant group for Cantor actions. First, the tail\nequivalence class of the sequence of discriminant groups obtained for the\nrestricted action on a neighborhood basis system of a point in $X$ defines an\ninvariant of the return equivalence class of the action, called the asymptotic\ndiscriminant, which is consequently an invariant of the homeomorphism class of\nthe weak solenoid.

On one hand, we introduce three\ninterdependent operations, namely weight partition, group-wise quantization and\nre-training. A well-proven measure is employed to divide the weights in each\nlayer of a pre-trained CNN model into two disjoint groups. The weights in the\nfirst group are responsible to form a low-precision base, thus they are\nquantized by a variable-length encoding method. The weights in the other group\nare responsible to compensate for the accuracy loss from the quantization, thus\nthey are the ones to be re-trained.

Purpose: The aim of this\npaper is to compare on a quantitative basis the single-particle spectral\nfunction generated by different nuclear hamiltonians using the first three\nenergy-weighted moments. Method: The spectral functions are calculated in the\nframework of the self-consistent Green's function approach at finite\ntemperature within a ladder resummation scheme. We analyze the first three\nmoments of the spectral function and connect these to the correlations induced\nby the interactions between the nucleons.

The discussion is centred around two- and three-body chiral\nnuclear interactions, with and without renormalization, but we also provide\nresults obtained with the traditional phase-shift-equivalent CD-Bonn and Av18\npotentials. Results: The variance of the spectral function is particularly\nsensitive to the short-range structure of the force, with hard-core\ninteractions providing large variances. Chiral forces yield variances which are\nan order of magnitude smaller and, when tamed using the similarity\nrenormalization group, the variance reduces significantly and in proportion to\nthe renormalization scale. The presence of three-body forces does not\nsubstantially affect the results. Conclusions: The first three moments of the\nspectral function are useful tools in analysing the importance of correlations\nin nuclear ground states. In particular, the second-order moment provides a\ndirect insight into dispersive contributions to the self-energy and its value\nis indicative of the fragmentation of single-particle states.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 7 figures.

The size of the shift in oscillation frequencies between the two minima is\ndependent on the frequency of the oscillation and takes the same functional\nform as the frequency dependence observed when the frequencies at cycle maximum\nare compared with the cycle-minimum frequencies. This implies that the same\nnear-surface magnetic perturbation is responsible. Finally, we determine that\nthe difference in the mean magnetic field between the minimum preceding Cycle\n23 and that following it is approximately 1G.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Solar Physics, 16 pages, 4 figures, 4\n  tables"]}]

At ASDEX Upgrade these modes can cause\nthree-dimensional (3D) boundary displacements up to the centimeter range. These\ndisplacements have been measured using toroidally localized high resolution\ndiagnostics and rigidly rotating n = 2 MP-fields with various applied poloidal\nmode spectra. These measurements are compared to non-linear 3D ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equilibria calculated by VMEC. Comprehensive\ncomparisons have been conducted, which consider for instance plasma movements\ndue to the position control system, attenuation due to internal conductors and\nchanges in the edge pressure profiles. VMEC accurately reproduces the amplitude\nof the displacement and its dependencies on the applied poloidal mode spectra.\nQuantitative agreement is found around the low field side (LFS) midplane. The\nresponse at the plasma top is qualitatively compared. The measured and\npredicted displacements at the plasma top maximize when the applied spectra is\noptimized for ELM-mitigation. The predictions from the vacuum modeling\ngenerally fails to describe the displacement at the LFS midplane as well as at\nthe plasma top. When the applied mode spectra is set to maximize the\ndisplacement, VMEC and the measurements clearly surpass the predictions from\nthe vacuum modeling by a factor of four.

More generally, what is the set ${\\cal M}(X,Y)$ of MSSR\ncurves from $X$ to $Y$? This set is influenced by two ways that non-uniqueness\ncan potentially occur, \"Type I\" and \"Type II\".

Our method of proof also yields an interesting half-angle formula\nconcerning principal angles beween subspaces of ${\\bf R}^p$ whose dimensions\nmay or may not be equal. The general-$p$ results concerning MSSR curves and\nscaling-rotation distance that we establish here underpin the $p=3$ results in\n[Groisser et al.
