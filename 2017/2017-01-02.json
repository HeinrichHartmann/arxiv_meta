As a\nconsequence, we show that every aperiodic uniformly recurrent word begins in an\nanti-power of order $k$, for any choice of $k>1$.

Such debris disks\nresult from the tidal disruption of rocky planetesimals which had survived to\nwhole stellar evolution from the main sequence to the final white dwarf stage.\nDetermining the accretion rate of this material is an important step towards\nestimating the mass of the planetesimals and towards understanding the ultimate\nfate of the planetary systems. The accretion of heavy material with a mean\nmolecular weight, $\\mu$, higher than the mean molecular weight of the white\ndwarf outer layers, induces a double-diffusive instability producing fingering\nconvection and extra-mixing. As a result, the accreted material is diluted deep\ninto the star.

Here we will focus on the composite Goldstone\nHiggs paradigm, for which this model provides a minimal UV complete realization\nin terms of a new strong sector with fermionic matter. After introducing the\nrelevant Lattice methods used in our simulations, we will discuss our numerical\nresults.

Among them, this review focuses on the molecule-like\nstructure of unstable nuclei. One of the earliest discussions on the clustering\nin unstable nuclei was made for neutron-rich Be and B isotopes. AMD\ncalculations predicted that the ground state clustering is enhanced or reduced\ndepending on the number of excess neutrons. Today, the experiments are\nconfirming this prediction as the change of the proton radii. Behind this\nenhancement and reduction of the clustering, there are underlying shell effects\ncalled molecular- and atomic-orbits. These orbits form covalent and ionic\nbonding of the clusters analogous to the atomic molecules. It was found that\nthis \"molecular-orbit picture\" reasonably explains the low-lying spectra of Be\nisotopes. The molecular-orbit picture is extended to other systems having\nparity asymmetric cluster cores and to the three cluster systems. O and Ne\nisotopes are the candidates of the former, while the $3\\alpha$ linear chains in\nC isotopes are the latter. For both subjects, many intensive studies are now in\nprogress. We also pay a special attention to the observables which are the\nfingerprint of the clustering. In particular, we focus on the monopole and\ndipole transitions which are recently regarded as good probe for the\nclustering. We discuss how they have and will reveal the exotic clustering.\n","Comment: 96 pages, 44 figures"]}]

As\nexamples, we construct a common cancer pathway model for BRCA and OV, infer a\ncomplex driver pathway model for BRCA carcinogenesis based on common driver\ngene sets of BRCA with eight cancer types, and investigate specific driver\npathways of the liquid cancer lymphoblastic acute myeloid leukemia (LAML)\nversus other solid cancer types.

The dynamics of the flaring loops in active region (AR) 11429 are\nstudied. The observed dynamics consist of several evolution stages of the\nflaring loop system during both the ascending and descending phases of the\nregistered M-class flare. The dynamical properties can also be classified by\ndifferent types of magnetic reconnection, related plasma ejection and aperiodic\nflows, quasi-periodic oscillatory motions, and rapid temperature and density\nchanges, among others. The focus of the present paper is on a specific time\ninterval during the ascending (pre-flare) phase. Aims. The goal is to\nunderstand the quasi-periodic behavior in both space and time of the magnetic\nloop structures during the considered time interval. Methods.We have studied\nthe characteristic location, motion, and periodicity properties of the flaring\nloops by examining space-time diagrams and intensity variation analysis along\nthe coronal magnetic loops using AIA intensity and HMI magnetogram images (from\nthe Solar Dynamics Observatory(SDO)). Results. We detected bright plasma blobs\nalong the coronal loop during the ascending phase of the solar flare, the\nintensity variations of which clearly show quasi-periodic behavior. We also\ndetermined the periods of these oscillations. Conclusions. Two different\ninterpretations are presented for the observed dynamics. Firstly, the\noscillations are interpreted as the manifestation of non-fundamental harmonics\nof longitudinal standing acoustic oscillations driven by the thermodynamically\nnonequilibrium background (with time variable density and temperature). The\nsecond possible interpretation we provide is that the observed bright blobs\ncould be a signature of a strongly twisted coronal loop that is kink unstable.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 10 figures, A&A, in press"]}]

In\nreal-world applications, a signal of interest is typically sparse not in the\ncanonical basis but in a certain transform domain, such as the wavelet or the\nfinite difference domain. The theory of compressed sensing was extended to this\nanalysis sparsity model. However, existing theoretic results for the analysis\nsparsity model have limitations in the following senses: the derivation relies\non particular choices of sensing matrix and sparsifying transform; sample\ncomplexity is significantly suboptimal compared to the analogous result in\ncompressed sensing with the canonical sparsity model. In this paper, we propose\na novel unified theory for robust recovery of sparse signals in a general\ntransform domain using convex relaxation methods that overcomes the\naforementioned limitations.

However,\nrecent research applying information theory to causal analysis has shown that\nthe causal structure of some systems can actually come into focus (be more\ninformative) at a macroscale (Hoel et al. 2013). That is, a macro model of a\nsystem (a map) can be more informative than a fully detailed model of the\nsystem (the territory). This has been called causal emergence.

There is increasing evidence of 6 to 10\ncompeting species/lineages at any point in the last half million years, making\nthe elucidation of the relationships of individual specimens particularly\nimportant. Recent estimates of the phylogeny of key specimens include Waddell\n(2013, 2014, 2015, 2016), and Mounier et al. (2016). These are made with quite\ndifferent data (3D skull shapes and discrete morphological characters,\nrespectively) and methods of analysis (unweighted least squares fitting of\ndistances, OLS+, and reweighted maximum parsimony, respectively). Initial\ninspection of the trees in these articles might leave the impression of a great\ndeal of disagreement and confused results. Here it is shown this need not be\nthe case, and that these two types of data and analysis may be indicating a\nvery similar tree, one that is in good agreement also with subjective current\nwisdom/expert opinions on particular parts of the phylogeny. The precise\nlocation of the African LH18 specimen arises as key to a better understanding\nof the likely form of the last common ancestors of H. sapiens and Neanderthals.\nA diverse approach seems to bring forth much more agreement of trees than\notherwise perceived, and argues against being dogmatic about methods of\nphylogenetic analysis particularly when working with difficult problems.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 6 figures"]}]

This paper provides a\nrecipe for combining ML algorithms to solve for causal effects in the presence\nof instrumental variables -- sources of treatment randomization that are\nconditionally independent from the response. We show that a flexible IV\nspecification resolves into two prediction tasks that can be solved with deep\nneural nets: a first-stage network for treatment prediction and a second-stage\nnetwork whose loss function involves integration over the conditional treatment\ndistribution. This Deep IV framework imposes some specific structure on the\nstochastic gradient descent routine used for training, but it is general enough\nthat we can take advantage of off-the-shelf ML capabilities and avoid extensive\nalgorithm customization. We outline how to obtain out-of-sample causal\nvalidation in order to avoid over-fit.
