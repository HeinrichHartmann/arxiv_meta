As a\nconsequence, we show that every aperiodic uniformly recurrent word begins in an\nanti-power of order $k$, for any choice of $k>1$.

The accretion of heavy material with a mean\nmolecular weight, $\\mu$, higher than the mean molecular weight of the white\ndwarf outer layers, induces a double-diffusive instability producing fingering\nconvection and extra-mixing. As a result, the accreted material is diluted deep\ninto the star.

Specifically, we discover a structure\ncalled superior edge set, the insertion or deletion of edges in which can be\nprocessed in parallel. Based on the structure of superior edge set, efficient\nparallel algorithms are then devised for incremental and decremental core\nmaintenance respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed algorithms\nare the first parallel ones for the fundamental core maintenance problem.

When compare to\nphysicists prediction of the Aganagic-Vafa mirror branes, such naive SYZ\ntransform fails to coincide with the prediction. The main reasons lies in the\nfact that the SYZ transformation does not capture open Gromov-Witten invariants\nof the A-brane.

Among them, this review focuses on the molecule-like\nstructure of unstable nuclei. One of the earliest discussions on the clustering\nin unstable nuclei was made for neutron-rich Be and B isotopes. AMD\ncalculations predicted that the ground state clustering is enhanced or reduced\ndepending on the number of excess neutrons. Today, the experiments are\nconfirming this prediction as the change of the proton radii. Behind this\nenhancement and reduction of the clustering, there are underlying shell effects\ncalled molecular- and atomic-orbits. These orbits form covalent and ionic\nbonding of the clusters analogous to the atomic molecules. It was found that\nthis \"molecular-orbit picture\" reasonably explains the low-lying spectra of Be\nisotopes. The molecular-orbit picture is extended to other systems having\nparity asymmetric cluster cores and to the three cluster systems. O and Ne\nisotopes are the candidates of the former, while the $3\\alpha$ linear chains in\nC isotopes are the latter. For both subjects, many intensive studies are now in\nprogress. We also pay a special attention to the observables which are the\nfingerprint of the clustering. In particular, we focus on the monopole and\ndipole transitions which are recently regarded as good probe for the\nclustering. We discuss how they have and will reveal the exotic clustering.\n","Comment: 96 pages, 44 figures"]}]

In\nreal-world applications, a signal of interest is typically sparse not in the\ncanonical basis but in a certain transform domain, such as the wavelet or the\nfinite difference domain. The theory of compressed sensing was extended to this\nanalysis sparsity model.

It has long been thought that while higher scale (macro)\ndescriptions of causal structure may be useful to observers, they are at best a\ncompressed description and at worse leave out critical information. However,\nrecent research applying information theory to causal analysis has shown that\nthe causal structure of some systems can actually come into focus (be more\ninformative) at a macroscale (Hoel et al. 2013). That is, a macro model of a\nsystem (a map) can be more informative than a fully detailed model of the\nsystem (the territory). This has been called causal emergence. While causal\nemergence may at first glance seem counterintuitive, this paper grounds the\nphenomenon in a classic concept from information theory: Shannon's discovery of\nthe channel capacity.

There is increasing evidence of 6 to 10\ncompeting species/lineages at any point in the last half million years, making\nthe elucidation of the relationships of individual specimens particularly\nimportant. Recent estimates of the phylogeny of key specimens include Waddell\n(2013, 2014, 2015, 2016), and Mounier et al. (2016). These are made with quite\ndifferent data (3D skull shapes and discrete morphological characters,\nrespectively) and methods of analysis (unweighted least squares fitting of\ndistances, OLS+, and reweighted maximum parsimony, respectively). Initial\ninspection of the trees in these articles might leave the impression of a great\ndeal of disagreement and confused results. Here it is shown this need not be\nthe case, and that these two types of data and analysis may be indicating a\nvery similar tree, one that is in good agreement also with subjective current\nwisdom/expert opinions on particular parts of the phylogeny. The precise\nlocation of the African LH18 specimen arises as key to a better understanding\nof the likely form of the last common ancestors of H. sapiens and Neanderthals.\nA diverse approach seems to bring forth much more agreement of trees than\notherwise perceived, and argues against being dogmatic about methods of\nphylogenetic analysis particularly when working with difficult problems.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 6 figures"]}]

Much of this growth has been fueled by the success of\ndeep learning architectures: models that map from observables to outputs via\nmultiple layers of latent representations. These deep learning algorithms are\neffective tools for unstructured prediction, and they can be combined in AI\nsystems to solve complex automated reasoning problems. This paper provides a\nrecipe for combining ML algorithms to solve for causal effects in the presence\nof instrumental variables -- sources of treatment randomization that are\nconditionally independent from the response. We show that a flexible IV\nspecification resolves into two prediction tasks that can be solved with deep\nneural nets: a first-stage network for treatment prediction and a second-stage\nnetwork whose loss function involves integration over the conditional treatment\ndistribution. This Deep IV framework imposes some specific structure on the\nstochastic gradient descent routine used for training, but it is general enough\nthat we can take advantage of off-the-shelf ML capabilities and avoid extensive\nalgorithm customization. We outline how to obtain out-of-sample causal\nvalidation in order to avoid over-fit. We also introduce schemes for both\nBayesian and frequentist inference: the former via a novel adaptation of\ndropout training, and the latter via a data splitting routine.\n"]}]

The capabilities of this approach\nare demonstrated on an idealised sloping beach setup in which the profile of an\nincoming wave is reconstructed from wet/dry interface observations. The method\nis robust against noisy observations if a regularisation term is added to the\noptimisation objective.
