The shocks produce\nneutrino emission and affect the observed photospheric radiation from the\nexplosion. They develop from internal compressive waves and can be of different\ntypes depending on the composition of the outflow: (1) Shocks in \"photon gas,\"\nwith negligible plasma inertia, have a unique structure determined by the\nforce-free condition---zero radiation flux in the plasma rest frame. Radiation\ndominance over plasma inertia suppresses formation of collisionless shocks\nmediated by collective electromagnetic fields. (2) If the outflow is\nsufficiently magnetized, a strong collisionless subshock develops, which is\nembedded in a thicker radiation-mediated structure. (3) Waves in outflows with\na free neutron component lead to dissipation through nuclear collisions. At\nlarge optical depths, shocks have a thickness comparable to the neutron free\npath, with an embedded radiation-mediated and collisionless subshocks. The\npaper also presents first-principle simulations of magnetized flows filled with\nphotons, demonstrating formation of shocks and their structure. Simple\nestimates show that magnetized sub-photospheric shocks are efficient producers\nof photons and have a great impact on the observed photospheric radiation. The\nshock structure changes as the outflow expands toward its photosphere. The\ndissipation is accompanied by strong $e^\\pm$ pair creation, and the\n$e^\\pm$-dressed shock carries the photosphere with it up to two decades in\nradius, emitting a strong pulse of nonthermal radiation.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 16 figures, accepted to ApJ"]}]

In our model angular momentum and mass are transported by a\ncombination of gravitational and bar-driven acoustic instabilities. In\ngravitationally-unstable regions the gas can form stars, and the resulting\nfeedback drives both turbulence and a wind that ejects mass from the CMZ. We\nshow that the CMZ is in a quasi-steady state where mass deposited at large\nradii by the bar is transported inward to a star-forming, ring-shaped region at\n$\\sim 100$ pc from the Galactic Centre, where the shear reaches a minimum. This\nring undergoes episodic starbursts, with bursts lasting $\\sim 5-10$ Myr\noccurring at $\\sim 20-40$ Myr intervals. During quiescence the gas in the ring\nis not fully cleared, but is driven out of a self-gravitating state by the\nmomentum injected by expanding supernova remnants. Starbursts also drive a wind\noff the star-forming ring, with a time-averaged mass flux comparable to the\nstar formation rate. We show that our model agrees well with the observed\nproperties of the CMZ, and places it near a star formation minimum within the\nevolutionary cycle.

Our aim is to compare the\npredictions of different physical models and to explore the extent to which\ncommonly-adopted assumptions in observational analyses (e.g. self-similar\nevolution) are violated. We examine the relations between (true) halo mass and\nthe X-ray temperature, X-ray luminosity, gas mass, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ)\nflux, the X-ray analogue of the SZ flux ($Y_X$) and the hydrostatic mass. For\nthe most realistic models, which include AGN feedback, the slopes of the\nvarious mass-observable relations deviate substantially from the self-similar\nones, particularly at late times and for low-mass clusters. The amplitude of\nthe mass-temperature relation shows negative evolution with respect to the\nself-similar prediction (i.e. slower than the prediction) for all models,\ndriven by an increase in non-thermal pressure support at higher redshifts. The\nAGN models predict strong positive evolution of the gas mass fractions at low\nhalo masses. The SZ flux and $Y_X$ show positive evolution with respect to\nself-similarity at low mass but negative evolution at high mass. The scatter\nabout the relations is well approximated by log-normal distributions, with\nwidths that depend mildly on halo mass. The scatter decreases significantly\nwith increasing redshift. The exception is the hydrostatic mass-halo mass\nrelation, for which the scatter increases with redshift.

This hybrid model is constructed by allowing\nthe surface flux transport (SFT) simulation described in Lemerle et al. 2015 to\nprovide the poloidal source term to an axisymmetric FTD simulation defined in a\nmeridional plane, which in turn generates the BMRs required by the SFT.

We use a genetic algorithm to\ncalibrate this function, together with other model parameters, against observed\ncycle 21 emergence data. We present a reference dynamo solution reproducing\nmany solar cycle characteristics, including good hemispheric coupling, phase\nrelationship between the surface dipole and the BMR-generating internal field,\nand correlation between dipole strength at cycle maximum and peak amplitude of\nthe next cycle. The saturation of the cycle amplitude takes place through the\nquenching of the BMR tilt as a function of the internal field. The observed\nstatistical scatter about the mean BMR tilt, built into the model, acts as a\nsource of stochasticity which dominates amplitude fluctuations.

We found that AGN populations across our\nsample had less time since the last starburst than the overall galaxy\npopulations. We did not find any relation between AGN activity and location\nwithin the LSSs, suggesting triggering mechanisms which depend on global\nenvironment are at most sub-dominant. To focus on differences between our AGNs,\nwe grouped them into four sub-samples based on the spectral properties of their\nparents LSSs. We found one of the sub-samples, SG0023 & SC1604, stood out from\nthe others: AGNs in this sample were disproportionately luminous, their average\ntime since the last starburst event was the smallest, despite the fact that\nthis was not true of the overall galaxy population in those LSSs, and both the\nAGNs and the overall galaxy population had the largest fraction of close\nkinematic pairs, which indicates a higher rate of galaxy mergers and\ninteractions. These results suggest that major mergers are driving AGN activity\nin SG0023 & SC1604, while other processes are likely triggering less luminous\nAGNs in the rest of our sample. Additionally, minor mergers are unlikely to\nplay a significant role, since the same conditions that lead to more major\nmergers should should also lead to more minor mergers, which is not observed in\nSG0023 & SC1604.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 8 figures, submitted to MNRAS"]}]

This suggests that Hercules may be dissolving under the Milky\nWay's gravitational influence, and hence could be a tidal stream in formation\nrather than a bound, dark-matter dominated satellite. Using Bayesian inference\nin combination with N-body simulations, we show that Hercules has to be on a\nvery eccentric orbit (epsilon~0.95) within the Milky Way in this scenario. On\nsuch an orbit, Hercules \"explodes\" as a consequence of the last tidal shock at\npericenter 0.5 Gyr ago. It is currently decelerating towards apocenter of its\norbit with a velocity of V=157 km/s -- of which 99% is directed radially\noutwards. Due to differential orbital precession caused by the non-spherical\nnature of the Galactic potential, its debris fans out nearly perpendicular to\nits orbit. This explains why Hercules has an elongated shape without showing a\ndistance gradient along its main body: it is in fact a stream that is\nsignificantly broader than it is long. In other words, it is moving\nperpendicular to its apparent major axis. In this scenario, there is a spike in\nthe radial velocity profile created by the dominant debris component that\nformed through the last pericenter passage. This is similar to kinematic\nsubstructure that is observed in the real Hercules. Modeling a satellite on\nsuch a highly eccentric orbit is strongly dependent on the form of the Galactic\npotential. We therefore propose that detailed kinematic investigation of\nHercules and other exploding satellite candidates can yield strong constraints\non the potential of the Milky Way.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 12 figures, submitted to AAS, comments welcome"]}]

Here, we develop a numerical implementation of the\nformalism by Godazgar and Reall (Ref.[1]) -- based on projections of the Weyl\ntensor analogous to the Newman-Penrose scalars -- that allows for the\ncalculation of gravitational waves in higher dimensional spacetimes with\nrotational symmetry. We apply and test this method in black-hole head-on\ncollisions from rest in $D=6$ spacetime dimensions and find that a fraction\n$(8.19\\pm 0.05)\\times 10^{-4}$ of the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass is radiated\naway from the system, in excellent agreement with literature results based on\nthe Kodama-Ishibashi perturbation technique. The method presented here\ncomplements the perturbative approach by automatically including contributions\nfrom all multipoles rather than computing the energy content of individual\nmultipoles.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 2 figures"]}]

A small\ndegree of curvature in the first-moment maps indicates that the disks are\nslightly curved in the manner expected for bow shocks moving away from the IRAS\nsource. A simple geometrical model confirms that this scenario fits the main\nemission features.\n  $Conclusions.$ The emission peaks in the IRAS 04166+2706 jet likely represent\ninternal bow shocks where material is being ejected laterally away from the jet\naxis. While the linear momentum of the ejected gas is dominated by the\ncomponent in the jet direction, the sideways component is not negligible, and\ncan potentially affect the distribution of gas in the surrounding outflow and\ncore.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

Rapid\ndevelopment of efficient speckle subtraction techniques in data reduction has\nenabled final contrasts of up to 10-6 to be obtained, however it remains\npreferable to eliminate the underlying NCPEs at the source. In this work we\nintroduce the coronagraphic Modal Wavefront Sensor (cMWS), a new wavefront\nsensor suitable for real-time NCPE correction. This pupil-plane optic combines\nthe apodizing phase plate coronagraph with a holographic modal wavefront\nsensor, to provide simultaneous coronagraphic imaging and focal-plane wavefront\nsensing using the science point spread function. We first characterise the\nbaseline performance of the cMWS via idealised closed-loop simulations, showing\nthat the sensor successfully recovers diffraction-limited coronagraph\nperformance over an effective dynamic range of +/-2.5 radians root-mean-square\n(RMS) wavefront error within 2-10 iterations. We then present the results of\ninitial on-sky testing at the William Herschel Telescope, and demonstrate that\nthe sensor is able to retrieve injected wavefront aberrations to an accuracy of\n10nm RMS under realistic seeing conditions. We also find that the cMWS is\ncapable of real-time broadband measurement of atmospheric wavefront variance at\na cadence of 50Hz across an uncorrected telescope sub-aperture. When combined\nwith a suitable closed-loop adaptive optics system, the cMWS holds the\npotential to deliver an improvement in raw contrast of up to two orders of\nmagnitude over the uncorrected QSS floor.

A number of\ncorrelations between the DRW model parameters, the signal decorrelation\ntimescale and amplitude, and the physical AGN parameters such as the black hole\nmass or luminosity have been reported. Aims: We are interested in whether it is\nplausible to correctly measure the DRW parameters from a typical ground-based\nsurvey, in particular how accurate the recovered DRW parameters are compared to\nthe input ones. Methods: By means of Monte Carlo simulations of AGN light\ncurves, we study the impact of the light curve length, the source magnitude,\ncadence, and additional light on the DRW model parameters. Results: The most\nsignificant finding is that currently existing surveys are going to return\nunconstrained DRW decorrelation timescales, because typical rest-frame data do\nnot probe long enough timescales or the white noise part of PSD for DRW. The\nexperiment length must be at least ten times longer than the true DRW\ntimescale, being presumably in the vicinity of one year, meaning a minimum\n10-years-long AGN light curves (rest-frame). The DRW timescales for\nsufficiently long light curves are typically weakly biased, and the exact bias\ndepends on the fitting method and used priors. The DRW amplitude is mostly\naffected by the photometric noise (so the source magnitude or the\nsignal-to-noise ratio), cadence, and the AGN host light. Conclusions: Because\nthe DRW parameters appear to be incorrectly determined from typically existing\ndata, the reported correlations of the DRW variability and physical AGN\nparameters from other works seem unlikely to be correct. In particular, the\nanti-correlation of the DRW timescale with redshift is a manifestation of the\nsurvey length being too short.

Cumulative distribution functions of the projected angle between the\nmagnetic field and outflow show different degrees of alignment in simulations\nwith differing mass-to-flux ratios. The distribution function for the less\nmagnetized core agrees with observations finding random alignment between\noutflow and field orientations, while the more magnetized core exhibits\nstronger alignment. We find that fractional polarization increases when the\nsystem is viewed such that the magnetic field is close to the plane of the sky,\nand the values of fractional polarization are consistent with observational\nmeasurements. The simulation outflow, which reflects the underlying angular\nmomentum of the accreted gas, changes direction significantly over the first\n$\\sim0.1$ Myr of evolution. This movement could lead to the observed random\nalignment between outflows and the magnetic fields in protostellar cores.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 10 figures, 1 appendix, accepted for publication in the\n  Astrophysical Journal"]}]

For\nquiescent galaxies, a median and dispersion of log <N(Fe II)/N(Mg II)>\n=-0.06+/-0.15 is found at d<~60 kpc, which declines to log <N(Fe II)/N(Mg II)>\n<-0.3 at d>~100 kpc.

We introduce a new interpretation that a part of\nthe CND may be colliding with the 20 km/s cloud and the collision may be\nresponsible for the formation of the bridge. Such collisional events could\npromote mass accretion onto the CND or into the inner ionized cavity, which may\nbe further tested by proper motion studies.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal"]}]

The Local Group dwarf galaxies would have similarly evolved with\nbuilding blocks of the Milky Way halo. However, how the chemo-dynamical\nevolution of the building blocks affects the abundance of r-process elements is\nnot yet clear. In this paper, we perform a series of simulations using dwarf\ngalaxy models with various dynamical times and total mass, which determine\nstar-formation histories. We find that galaxies with dynamical times longer\nthan 100 Myr have star formation rates less than $10^{-3} M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$\nand slowly enrich metals in their early phase. These galaxies can explain the\nobserved large scatters of r-process abundance in EMP stars in the Milky Way\nhalo regardless of their total mass. On the other hand, the first neutron star\nmerger appears at a higher metallicity in galaxies with a dynamical time\nshorter than typical neutron star merger times. The scatters of r-process\nelements mainly come from inhomogeneity of the metals in the interstellar\nmedium whereas the scatters of $\\alpha$-elements are mostly due to the\ndifference in the yield of each supernova.

The review\nthen moves to focus on modern applications of these concepts, including the\nbasic concepts and diagnostics developed for the forensics of nuclear\nexplosions, the nuclear diagnostics at the National Ignition Facility, nuclear\nreactor safeguards, and the detection of nuclear material production and\ntrafficking. The review also summarizes recent developments in nuclear\ngeophysics and nuclear medicine. The nuclear geophysics areas discussed include\ngeo-chronology, nuclear logging for industry, the Oklo reactor, and\ngeo-neutrinos. The section on nuclear medicine summarizes the critical advances\nin nuclear imaging, including PET and SPECT imaging, targeted radionuclide\ntherapy, and the nuclear physics of medical isotope production.

Further increase of $x$ leads to the appearance of a double\npeak in the scattering profile at $0.45 < x < 0.7$.

Our wet (dry) mergers have an average\nneutral gas fraction (i.e. the ratio between the neutral gas and the stellar\nmasses of the merging system) of $1.1$ ($0.02$), while minor (major) mergers\nare those with stellar mass ratios between the secondary and primary galaxy in\nthe range $0.1-0.3$ ($\\ge 0.3$). We correlate the positions of galaxies in the\n$j_{\\rm stars}$-stellar mass plane at $z=0$ with their merger history, and find\nthat galaxies of low spins suffered dry mergers, while galaxies of normal/high\nspins suffered predominantly wet mergers, if any at all.

A lot, it turns out. Neural network model\ncompression has become a topic of great interest in recent years, and many\ndifferent techniques have been proposed to address this problem. In general,\nthis is motivated by the idea that smaller models typically lead to better\ngeneralization. At the same time, the decision of what to prune and when to\nprune necessarily forces us to confront our assumptions about how neural\nnetworks actually learn to represent patterns in data. In this work we set out\nto test several long-held hypotheses about neural network learning\nrepresentations and numerical approaches to pruning. To accomplish this we\nfirst reviewed the historical literature and derived a novel algorithm to prune\nwhole neurons (as opposed to the traditional method of pruning weights) from\noptimally trained networks using a second-order Taylor method. We then set\nabout testing the performance of our algorithm and analyzing the quality of the\ndecisions it made. As a baseline for comparison we used a first-order Taylor\nmethod based on the Skeletonization algorithm and an exhaustive brute-force\nserial pruning algorithm. Our proposed algorithm worked well compared to a\nfirst-order method, but not nearly as well as the brute-force method. Our error\nanalysis led us to question the validity of many widely-held assumptions behind\npruning algorithms in general and the trade-offs we often make in the interest\nof reducing computational complexity. We discovered that there is a\nstraightforward way, however expensive, to serially prune 40-70% of the neurons\nin a trained network with minimal effect on the learning representation and\nwithout any re-training.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 36 figures, submission to ICLR 2017"]}]

Currently, existing methods couple the models\neither at the channel lateral boundaries (lateral methods) or at the location,\nalong the channel flow direction, where the two sub-domains intersect (frontal\nmethods). We classify these methods as horizontal methods since the coupling\npoints are on the horizontal plane. The limitations of these methods include\ntheir inability to recover the 2D channel flow structure during flooding\nwithout losing efficiency, and their inability to switch between lateral and\nfrontal methods, based on the problem. Here, we propose a new paradigm which is\nto think of the channel flow as a two layer flow. This leads to the vertical\ncoupling method (VCM) which is able to recover 2D channel flow structure\nwithout losing efficiency, switch types depending on the flow and is a superset\nof some existing methods. The VCM is based on a user chosen elevation above\nwhich the user considers the channel to be full. From this elevation, all other\nflow quantities are defined including the two layers. The flows in the lower\nand upper layers are assumed to be 1D and 2D respectively, and the appropriate\nflow models with exchange terms are derived. The 2D shallow water flow model is\nretained for the floodplains.

The tangential condition on the velocity\nand the pressure gradient is enforced only weakly, avoiding the need for any\ntangential projection.

Unfortunately, this method\nhas important limitations in identifying the existence of multiple planets and\ndetermining their parameters due to the degeneracy of the resulting light curve\nanomalies from those induced by a single planet and the complexity of multiple\nplanet lensing models.

It\nhas been proposed that intermediate redshift LCBGs may be the progenitors of\nlocal dwarf ellipticals or low luminosity spirals, or that they may be more\nmassive disks forming from the center outward to become L^star galaxies. To\ndiscriminate among various possible evolutionary scenarios, we have measured\nthe dynamical masses and gas depletion time scales of this sample of nearby\nLCBGs.\n  We find that local LCBGs span a wide range of dynamical masses, from 4 x 10^9\nto 1 x 10^11 M_solar (measured within R_25). Molecular gas in local LCBGs is\ndepleted quite quickly, in 30 to 200 million years. The molecular plus atomic\ngas is depleted in 30 million to 10 billion years; however, ~80% of the local\nLCBGs deplete their gas in less than 5 billion years. As LCBGs are\nheterogeneous in both dynamical mass and gas depletion time scales, they are\nnot likely to evolve into one homogeneous galaxy class.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures, to be published in 4th\n  Cologne-Bonn-Zermatt-Symposium, Eds.

The line is redshifted by about 130 km s^-1 with respect to the\nsystemic velocity, is extremely broad, with a FWHM of 130 km s^-1, and has no\ndetectable high velocity components within 1500 km s^-1 on either side of the\nobserved line. The unusual line profile led us to suspect that this source,\nmight belong to a class of megamaser galaxies in which the amplified emission\nis the result of an interaction between the radio jet and an encroaching\nmolecular cloud, rather than occurring in a circumnuclear disk. Our initial\nVLBA observations show that the maser emission emanates entirely from a region\n<0.25 pc in extent, located toward a continuum component thought to be\nassociated with the receding jet. The very high linewidth occurring on such\nsmall spatial scales and the rapid variability indicate that the H_2O emission\nis likely to arise from a shocked region at the interface between the energetic\njet material and the molecular gas in the cloud where the jet is boring\nthrough. The orientation of the radio jets close to the plane of the sky also\nresults in shocks with the preferred orientation for strong masers from our\nvantage point. Single-dish monitoring with the Effelsberg 100m telescope showed\nthat the line and continuum emission \"flared\" on very similar timescales. The\nclose temporal correlation between this activity in the maser emission and the\ncontinuum flare further suggest that the masing region and the continuum\nhotspots are nearly equidistant from the central engine and may be different\nmanifestations of the same dynamical events.\n  (abridged abstract)\n","Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures.
