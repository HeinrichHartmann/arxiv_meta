For a class of passage time distributions there is a family of\nboundary conditions that make the process stationary and self-dual. For such\ndistributions there is a law of large numbers and the process extends to the\ninfinite lattice. A proof of Burke's theorem emerges from the construction.

An essential aspect\nis that traits collectively evolve under the repeated action of social\ninfluence interactions, which is the focus of many quantitative studies of\ncultural dynamics. In this paradigm, dynamical models require that all traits\nare fixed when specifying the \"initial cultural state\". Typically, this initial\nstate is randomly generated, from a uniform distribution over the set of\npossible combinations of traits. However, recent work has shown that the\noutcome of social influence dynamics strongly depends on the nature of the\ninitial state: if this is sampled from empirical data instead of being\ngenerated in a uniformly random way, a higher level of cultural diversity is\nfound after long-term dynamics, for the same level of propensity towards\ncollective behavior in the short-term; moreover, if the initial state is\nobtained by shuffling the empirical traits among people, the level of long-term\ncultural diversity is in-between those obtained for the empirical and random\ncounterparts. The current study repeats the analysis for multiple empirical\ndata sets, showing that the results are remarkably similar, although the matrix\nof correlations between cultural variables clearly differs across data sets.\nThis points towards robust structural properties inherent in empirical cultural\nstates, likely due to universal laws governing the dynamics of culture in the\nreal world.

A direct numerical\napproximation of such problems is prohibitively expensive as it requires\nresolving the microscopic variations over a much larger physical domain of\ninterest. The heterogeneous multiscale method (HMM) is an efficient framework\nto approximate the solutions of multiscale problems. In HMM, one assumes an\nincomplete macroscopic model which is coupled to a known but expensive\nmicroscopic model. The micromodel is solved only locally to upscale the\nparameter values which are missing in the macromodel. The resulting macroscopic\nmodel can then be solved at a cost independent of the small scales in the\nproblem.\n  In general, the accuracy of the HMM is related to how good the upscaling step\napproximates the right macroscopic quantities.

We aim to search for\ngiant planets responsible for the disk features and, in case of non-detection,\nto constrain recent planet predictions using the data detection limits.\nMethods. We obtained new high-contrast and high-resolution total intensity\nimages of the target spanning the Y to the K bands (0.95-2.3 mic) using the\nVLT/SPHERE near-infrared camera and integral field spectrometer.

We derive\nbias and variance rates, and show that for the class of $\\gamma$-H\\\"{o}lder\nsmooth functions, the estimator achieves the MSE rate of\n$O(N^{-2\\gamma/(\\gamma+d)})$. Furthermore, by using a weighted ensemble\nestimation technique, for density functions with continuous and bounded\nderivatives of up to the order $d$, and some extra conditions at the support\nset boundary, we derive an ensemble estimator that achieves the parametric MSE\nrate of $O(1/N)$.

The main two have an overlapping spatial distribution,\nsuggesting a (past or ongoing) collision along the line-of-sight. After\naccounting for the presence of substructures, the mass estimate of Abell 315\nfrom kinematics is reduced by a factor 4, down to M200=0.8 (-0.4,+0.6) x 10^14\nMsun. We also find evidence that the cluster mass concentration is unusually\nlow, c200=r200/r-2 <~ 1. Using our new estimate of c200 we revise the weak\nlensing mass estimate down to M200=1.8 (-0.9,+1.7) x 10^14 Msun. Our new mass\nestimates are in agreement with that derived from the cluster X-ray luminosity\nvia a scaling relation, M200=0.9+-0.2 x 10^14 Msun. Abell 315 no longer belongs\nto the class of X-ray underluminous clusters. Its mass estimate was inflated by\nthe presence of an undetected subcluster in collision with the main cluster.\nWhether the presence of undetected line-of-sight structures can be a general\nexplanation for all X-ray underluminous clusters remains to be explored using a\nstatistically significant sample.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A. 12 pages, 11 figures"]}]

Here we propose the A-ISI-distance, the\nA-SPIKE-distance and A-SPIKE-synchronization, which generalize the original\nmeasures by considering the local relative to the global time-scales. For the\nA-SPIKE-distance we also introduce a rate-independent extension called the\nRIA-SPIKE-distance, which focuses specifically on spike timing.\n  Results: The adaptive generalizations A-ISI-distance and A-SPIKE-distance\nallow to disregard spike time differences that are not relevant on a more\nglobal scale.

Aim: To analyze the physical mechanisms that cause\nasymmetries and surface structures in observed images, we use detailed 3D\ndynamical simulations of AGB stars; these simulations self-consistently\ndescribe convection and pulsations. Methods: We used the CO5BOLD\nradiation-hydrodynamics code to produce an exploratory grid of global\n\"star-in-a-box\" models of the outer convective envelope and the inner\natmosphere of AGB stars to study convection, pulsations, and shock waves and\ntheir dependence on stellar and numerical parameters. Results: The model\ndynamics are governed by the interaction of long-lasting giant convection\ncells, short-lived surface granules, and strong, radial, fundamental-mode\npulsations. Radial pulsations and shorter wavelength, traveling, acoustic waves\ninduce shocks on various scales in the atmosphere. Convection, waves, and\nshocks all contribute to the dynamical pressure and, thus, to an increase of\nthe stellar radius and to a levitation of material into layers where dust can\nform. Consequently, the resulting relation of pulsation period and stellar\nradius is shifted toward larger radii compared to that of non-linear 1D models.\nThe dependence of pulsation period on luminosity agrees well with observed\nrelations. The interaction of the pulsation mode with the non-stationary\nconvective flow causes occasional amplitude changes and phase shifts. The\nregularity of the pulsations decreases with decreasing gravity as the relative\nsize of convection cells increases. The model stars do not have a well-defined\nsurface.

Following our earlier work, we\nformulate recommendation system design as a subgraph selection problem from a\ncandidate super-graph of potential recommendations where both diversity and\nrating quality are explicitly optimized: (1) On the modeling side, we define a\nnew flexible notion of diversity that allows a system designer to prescribe the\nnumber of recommendations each item should receive, and smoothly penalizes\ndeviations from this distribution. (2) On the algorithmic side, we show that\nminimum-cost network flow methods yield fast algorithms in theory and practice\nfor designing recommendation subgraphs that optimize this notion of diversity.\n(3) On the empirical side, we show the effectiveness of our new model and\nmethod to increase diversity while maintaining high rating quality in standard\nrating data sets from Netflix and MovieLens.\n"]}]

Our work extends the framework of [BFRR14] and follow-up papers,\nwhich focused on quantitative objectives, by addressing the case of\n$\\omega$-regular conditions encoded as parity objectives, a natural way to\nrepresent functional requirements of systems.\n  We build strategies that satisfy a main parity objective on all plays, while\nensuring a secondary one with sufficient probability. This setting raises new\nchallenges in comparison to quantitative objectives, as one cannot easily mix\ndifferent strategies without endangering the functional properties of the\nsystem. We establish that, for all variants of this problem, deciding the\nexistence of a strategy lies in ${\\sf NP} \\cap {\\sf coNP}$, the same complexity\nclass as classical parity games. Hence, our framework provides additional\nmodeling power while staying in the same complexity class.\n  [BFRR14] V\\'eronique Bruy\\`ere, Emmanuel Filiot, Mickael Randour, and\nJean-Fran\\c{c}ois Raskin.
