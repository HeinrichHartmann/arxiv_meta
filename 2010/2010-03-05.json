Given the enormous\nelectrical potential that would develop with no screening, we conjecture that\nthe size of the Universe,as given by the speed of light c and its age t, ct,\ncannot be very much lower than the Debye length. The Debye length of the\nUniverse must be of the order of its size ct.It turns out that it is about 6\ntimes larger. Hence inside the volume of size ct there is an outward electrical\npressure due to the lack of complete screening of the electrical charges.

To the\nquestion of why the Universe does not collapse under its own gravitational\nattraction we analyze the possibility to answer this by the effect of the\nrepulsive forces of these electrical charges. Evidence in support of the idea\nthat space is not expanding is growing more and more in the scientific\nliterature. As a frame of work we consider the model of a constant size\nUniverse that implies a constant equilibrium between the gravitational (GM2/R2)\nand the electrical forces (Q2/R2).
