It was the\nperiod of the Universe evolution during the first parts of the first second of\nits life. After the last phase transition (quark-hadron) the vacuum energy `has\nhardened'. In this moment its energy density can be calculated using the\nZeldovich's formula inserting an average value of the pseudo-Goldstone boson\nmasses (pi-mesons) that characterizes this chromodynamical vacuum.

Usually a Chapman-Enskog analysis is performed, either on the\ncontinuous Boltzmann system, or its discrete velocity counterpart. Separately a\ndiscrete time approximation is introduced to the discrete velocity Boltzmann\nsystem, to achieve a practically useful approximation to the continuous system,\nfor use in computation. Thereafter, with some additional arguments, the\ndynamics of the Chapman-Enskog expansion are linked to the discrete time system\nto produce the dynamics of the completely discrete scheme. In this paper we put\nforward a different route to the macroscopic dynamics. We begin with the system\ndiscrete in both velocity space and time. We hypothesize that the alternating\nsteps of advection and relaxation, common to all lattice Boltzmann schemes,\ngive rise to a slow invariant manifold. We perform a time step expansion of the\ndiscrete time dynamics using the invariance of the manifold. Finally we\ncalculate the dynamics arising from this system. By choosing the fully discrete\nscheme as a starting point we avoid mixing approximations and arrive at a\ngeneral form of the microscopic dynamics up to the second order in the time\nstep. We calculate the macroscopic dynamics of two commonly used lattice\nschemes up to the first order, and hence find the precise form of the deviation\nfrom the Navier-Stokes equations in the dissipative term, arising from the\ndiscretization of velocity space.

This change, I argue, has been causing damage by\npromoting the view that there is no substantial cooling in these clusters. In\nthis contribution I discuss the following points, with emphasize on the last\none that deals with magnetic fields in cooling flow clusters. (1) Both\nAGN-feedback and hot-gas cooling to form stars occur during galaxy formation as\nwell as in cooling flow clusters. Ignoring cooling of the intra-cluster medium,\nas implied by the term \"cool core\", does not encourage comparative study of AGN\nfeedback in cooling flow clusters with that of galaxy formation. (2) The line\nof thought that there is no cooling might lead to wrong questions and research\ndirections. (3) A key question in both cooling flow clusters and during galaxy\nformation is the mode of accretion by the super massive black hole (SMBH). When\ncooling is neglected only accretion from the hot phase remains. Accretion from\nthe hot phase, such as the Bondi accretion, suffers from some severe problems.\n(4) When it is accepted that moderate quantities of gas are cooling, it becomes\nclear that global heat conduction must be substantially suppressed. This does\nnot favor a globally ordered magnetic field. As well, it makes global heat\nconduction unattractive.\n","Comment: A contribution presented in Galaxy Clusters, 26-30 July 2010,\n  Garching, Germany"]}]

To assist in\nexploring the possibility that they are due to an astrophysical false positive,\nwe describe a procedure (BLENDER) to model the photometry in terms of a \"blend\"\nrather than a planet orbiting a star. A blend may consist of a background or\nforeground eclipsing binary (or star-planet pair) whose eclipses are attenuated\nby the light of the candidate and possibly other stars within the photometric\naperture.

Recovering depth information from two-dimensional images of a\nscene is an important task in computer vision that can assist numerous\napplications such as object recognition, scene interpretation, obstacle\navoidance, inspection and assembly. Various passive depth computation\ntechniques have been developed for computer vision applications. They can be\nclassified into two groups. The first group operates using just one image. The\nsecond group requires more than one image which can be acquired using either\nmultiple cameras or a camera whose parameters and positioning can be changed.\nThis project is aimed to find the real depth of the object from the camera\nwhich had been used to click the photograph. An n-degree polynomial was\nformulated, which maps the pixel depth of an image to the real depth. In order\nto find the coefficients of the polynomial, an experiment was carried out for a\nparticular lens and thus, these coefficients are a unique feature of a\nparticular camera. The procedure explained in this report is a monocular\napproach for estimation of depth of a scene. The idea involves mapping the\nPixel Depth of the object photographed in the image with the Real Depth of the\nobject from the camera lens with an interpolation function. In order to find\nthe parameters of the interpolation function, a set of lines with predefined\ndistance from camera is used, and then the distance of each line from the\nbottom edge of the picture (as the origin line) is calculated.\n"]}]

The distribution has to be measured\nrelative to the momentum q transferred from the projectile to the target atom.\nThe situation is similar, but not identical to the photoionization studies,\nwhere the matrix elements of continuous spectrum atomic quadrupole transitions\ncan be determined by measuring the so-called non-dipole angular anisotropy\nparameters of photoelectrons. However, they are strongly suppressed as compared\nto the dipole matrix elements by small ratio of atomic size to the photon\nwavelength.

Maintaining high performance, while\nextending the battery life between charges is an interesting challenge for\nsystem designers. Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) allows a processor to\ndynamically change speed and voltage at run time, thereby saving energy by\nspreading run cycles into idle time. Knowing when to use full power and when\nnot, requires the cooperation of the operating system scheduler. Usually,\nhigher processor voltage and frequency leads to higher system throughput while\nenergy reduction can be obtained using lower voltage and frequency. Instead of\nlowering processor voltage and frequency as much as possible, energy efficient\nreal-time scheduling adjusts voltage and frequency according to some\noptimization criteria, such as low energy consumption or high throughput, while\nit meets the timing constraints of the real-time tasks. As the quantity and\nfunctional complexity of battery powered portable devices continues to raise,\nenergy efficient design of such devices has become increasingly important. Many\nreal-time scheduling algorithms have been developed recently to reduce energy\nconsumption in the portable devices that use DVS capable processors.

In Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, the MSM risk group has\nbeen traced for decades. This has motivated studies which provide detailed\ninformation about MSM's risk behavior statistically, psychologically and\nsociologically. Despite the era of potent antiretroviral therapy, the incidence\nof HIV among MSM increases. In the long term the contradictory effects of risk\nbehavior and effective therapy are still poorly understood. Using a previously\npresented Complex Agent Network model, we describe steady and casual\npartnerships to predict the HIV spreading among MSM. Behavior-related\nparameters and values, inferred from studies on Amsterdam MSM, are fed into the\nmodel; we validate the model using historical yearly incidence data.\nSubsequently, we study scenarios to assess the contradictory effects of risk\nbehavior and effective therapy, by varying corresponding values of parameters.\nFinally, we conduct quantitative analysis based on the resulting incidence\ndata. The simulated incidence reproduces the ACS historical incidence well and\nhelps to predict the HIV epidemic among MSM in Amsterdam. Our results show that\nin the long run the positive influence of effective therapy can be outweighed\nby an increase in risk behavior of at least 30% for MSM. Conclusion: We\nrecommend, based on the model predictions, that lowering risk behavior is the\nprominent control mechanism of HIV incidence even in the presence of effective\ntherapy.\n"]}]

It this\npaper we estimate the frequency of intrinsically disordered proteins in several\nliving organisms by using the ratio S between the likelihood, for a protein\nsequence, of being composed mainly by order-promoting or disorder-promoting\nresidues. We scan several proteomes from Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya. We find\nthe following figures: 1.63% for Archaea, 3.91% for Bacteria, 16.35% for\nEukarya.

We introduce the notion of a quantum stochastic representation of\nan instrument, whose elements are wholly determined by the unitary invariants\nof a measuring process.
