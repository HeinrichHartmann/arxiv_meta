Complexity arises from the size of software systems and the wide\nvariety of possible operating environments: the increasing choice of platforms\nand communication policies leads to ever more complex performance\ncharacteristics. In addition, software systems exhibit different behaviour\nunder different workloads. Many software systems are designed to be\nconfigurable so that policies can be chosen to meet the needs of various\nstakeholders. For complex software systems it can be difficult to accurately\npredict the effects of a change and to know which configuration is most\nappropriate. This thesis demonstrates that it is useful to run automated\nexperiments that measure a selection of system configurations. Experiments can\nfind configurations that meet the stakeholders' needs, find interesting\nbehavioural characteristics, and help produce predictive models of the system's\nbehaviour. The design and use of ACT (Automated Configuration Tool) for running\nsuch experiments is described, in combination a number of search strategies for\ndeciding on the configurations to measure. Design Of Experiments (DOE) is\ndiscussed, with emphasis on Taguchi Methods. These statistical methods have\nbeen used extensively in manufacturing, but have not previously been used for\nconfiguring software systems. The novel contribution here is an industrial case\nstudy, applying the combination of ACT and Taguchi Methods to DC-Directory, a\nproduct from Data Connection Ltd (DCL). The case study investigated the\napplicability of Taguchi Methods for configuring complex software systems.\nTaguchi Methods were found to be useful for modelling and configuring DC-\nDirectory, making them a valuable addition to the techniques available to\nsystem administrators and developers.\n","Comment: PhD Thesis, University of St Andrews, 2003.

This is\nparticularly true of complexity, an inherently interdisciplinary concept that\nhas penetrated very different fields of intellectual activity from physics to\nlinguistics, but with no underlying, unified theory. Complexity has become a\npopular buzzword used in the hope of gaining attention or funding -- institutes\nand research networks associated with complex systems grow like mushrooms. Why\nand how did it happen that this vague notion has become a central motif in\nmodern science? Is it only a fashion, a kind of sociological phenomenon, or is\nit a sign of a changing paradigm of our perception of the laws of nature and of\nthe approaches required to understand them? Because virtually every real system\nis inherently extremely complicated, to say that a system is complex is almost\nan empty statement - couldn't an Institute of Complex Systems just as well be\ncalled an Institute for Almost Everything? Despite these valid concerns, the\nworld is indeed made of many highly interconnected parts over many scales,\nwhose interactions result in a complex behaviour needing separate\ninterpretation for each level. This realization forces us to appreciate that\nnew features emerge as one goes from one scale to another, so it follows that\nthe science of complexity is about revealing the principles governing the ways\nby which these new properties appear.\n","Comment: Concepts essay, published in Nature\n  http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v418/n6894/full/418131a.html"]}]
