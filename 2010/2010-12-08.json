The main difference is the treatment of\nstar formation and feedback, both of which were designed to be more efficient\nin the disc-dominated object. We find that the specific angular momentum of the\ndisc-dominated galaxy tracks the evolution of the angular momentum of the dark\nmatter halo very closely: the angular momentum grows as predicted by linear\ntheory until the epoch of maximum expansion and remains constant thereafter. By\ncontrast, the evolution of the angular momentum of the bulge-dominated galaxy\nresembles that of the central, most bound halo material: it also grows at first\naccording to linear theory, but 90% of it is rapidly lost as pre-galactic\nfragments, into which gas had cooled efficiently, merge, transferring their\norbital angular momentum to the outer halo by tidal effects.

When modeling the stellar dynamics of the primary lens\ngalaxy, the lensing effect, and the environment of the lens, we explicitly\ninclude the total mass distribution profile logarithmic slope gamma' and the\nexternal convergence kappa_ext; we marginalize over these parameters, assigning\nwell-motivated priors for them, and so turn the major systematic errors into\nstatistical ones. The HST images provide one such prior, constraining the lens\nmass density profile logarithmic slope to be gamma'=2.08+/-0.03; a combination\nof numerical simulations and photometric observations of the B1608+656 field\nprovides an estimate of the prior for kappa_ext: 0.10 +0.08/-0.05. This latter\ndistribution dominates the final uncertainty on H_0. Compared with previous\nwork on this system, the new data provide an increase in precision of more than\na factor of two. In combination with the WMAP 5-year data set, we find that the\nB1608+656 data set constrains the curvature parameter to be -0.031 < Omega_k <\n0.009 (95% CL), a level of precision comparable to that afforded by the current\nType Ia SNe sample. Asserting a flat spatial geometry, we find that, in\ncombination with WMAP, H_0 = 69.7 +4.9/-5.0 km/s/Mpc and w=-0.94 +0.17/-0.19\n(68% CL), suggesting that the observations of B1608+656 constrain w as tightly\nas do the current Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data.

To this end, we consider two Gaussian processes: (i) a\nshort-range correlated process with an infinite set of time-scales bounded from\nbelow, and (ii) a power-law correlated process with an infinite and unbounded\nset of time-scales. For these processes we investigate the equal position\nconditional probability P(x,t|x,0) and the mean First Passage Time T(L).

The mean First Passage Time can be considered as a proxy\nof how fast is the process in reaching a position at distance L starting from\nposition x. In the first investigation we show that the more time-scales the\nprocess includes, the larger the persistence. Specifically, we show that the\npower-law correlated process shows a slow power-law decay of P(x,t|x,0) to the\nstationary pdf. By contrast, the short range correlated process shows a decay\ndominated by an exponential cut-off. Moreover, we also show that the existence\nof an infinite and unbouded set of time-scales is a necessary and not\nsufficient condition for observing a slow power-law decay of P(x,t|x,0). In the\nsecond investigation, we show that for large values of L the more time-scales\nthe process includes, the larger the mean First Passage Time, i.e. the slowest\nthe process. On the other hand, for small values of L, the more time-scales the\nprocess includes, the smaller the mean First Passage Time, i.e. when a process\nstatistically spends more time in a given position the likelihood that it\nreached nearby positions by chance is also enhanced.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 7 figure"]}]

The bulk contribution to NST arises\nfrom an extended sharp radius of neutrons, whereas the surface contribution\narises from different widths of the neutron and proton surfaces. Nuclear models\nwhere the symmetry energy is stiff, as typical relativistic models, predict a\nbulk contribution in NST of 208Pb about twice as large as the surface\ncontribution. In contrast, models with a soft symmetry energy like common\nnonrelativistic models predict that NST of 208Pb is divided similarly into bulk\nand surface parts. Indeed, if the symmetry energy is supersoft, the surface\ncontribution becomes dominant.

We point out two discrepancies\nbetween their treatment and ours, however, one technical, the other having to\ndo with the very understanding of what constitutes a Gaussian random signal.\nBoth groups simulate maps using the CMB power spectrum for LCDM, while we\nsimulate a pure Gaussian sky plus the WMAP's noise, which points out the\ncontradiction with a common statement [3] that \"CMB signal is random noise of\nGaussian nature\". For as it was shown in [5], the random component is a minor\none in the CMB signal, namely, about 0.2. Accordingly, the circles we saw are a\nreal structure of the CMB sky and they are not of a random Gaussian nature.\nAlthough the structures studied certainly cannot contradict the power spectrum,\nwhich is well fitted by LCDM model, we particularly emphasize that the low\nvariance circles occur in concentric families, and this key fact cannot be\nexplained as a purely random effect.
