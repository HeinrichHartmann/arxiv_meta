By this new model, superconducting state\nconsists of the dynamic bound state of superconducting electrons, which is\nformed by the high-energy nonbonding electrons through dynamic interaction with\ntheir surrounding lattice to trap themselves into the three - dimensional\npotential wells lying in energy at above the Fermi level of the material. The\nbinding energy of superconducting electrons dominates the superconducting\ntransition temperature in the corresponding material. Under an electric field,\nsuperconducting electrons move coherently with lattice distortion wave and\nperiodically exchange their excitation energy with chain lattice, that is, the\nsuperconducting electrons transfer periodically between their dynamic bound\nstate and conducting state. Thus, the intrinsic feature of superconductivity is\nto generate an oscillating current under a dc voltage. The coherence lengths in\ncuprates must have the value equal to an even number times the lattice\nconstant. A superconducting material must simultaneously satisfy three criteria\nrequired by superconductivity. Almost all of the puzzling behavior of the\ncuprates can be uniquely understood under this new model. We demonstrate that\nthe factor 2 in Josephson current equation, in fact, is resulting from 2V, the\nvoltage drops across the two superconductor sections on both sides of a\njunction, not from the Cooper pair, and the magnetic flux is quantized in units\nof h/e, postulated by London, not in units of h/2e.

The key to\nintelligence1 is learning relationships between large numbers of signals (such\nas pixel values), rather than memorizing explicit patterns. Causes (such as\nobjects) can then be inferred from a learned internal model. These\nrelationships fall into 2 classes: simple pairwise or second-order correlations\n(socs), and complex, and vastly more numerous, higher-order correlations\n(hocsB), such as the product of 3 or more pixels averaged over a set of images.\nThus if 3 pixels correlate, they may give an \"edge\". Neurons with \"Hebbian\"\nsynapses (changing strength in response to input-output spike-coincidences) are\nsensitive to such correlations, and it's likely that learned internal models\nuse such neurons. Because output firing depends on input firing via the\nrelevant connection strengths, Hebbian learning provides, in a feedback manner,\nsensitivity to input correlations. Hocs are vital, since they express\n\"interesting\" structure2 (e.g. edges), but their detection requires nonlinear\nrules operating at synapses of individual neurons. Here we report that in\nsingle model neurons learning from hocs fails, and defaults to socs, if\nnonlinear Hebbian rules are not sufficiently connection-specific. Such failure\nwould inevitably occur if a neuron's input synapses were too crowded, and would\nundermine biological connectionism.

Unfortunately, the mostly used social services are centralized and\npersonal information is stored at a single vendor. This results in potential\nprivacy problems as users do not have much control over how their private data\nis disseminated. To overcome this limitation, some recent approaches envisioned\nreplacing the single authority centralization of services by a peer-to-peer\ntrust-based approach where users can decide with whom they want to share their\nprivate data. In this peer-to-peer collaboration it is very difficult to ensure\nthat after data is shared with other peers, these peers will not misbehave and\nviolate data privacy. In this paper we propose a mechanism that addresses the\nissue of data privacy violation due to data disclosure to malicious peers. In\nour approach trust values between users are adjusted according to their\nprevious activities on the shared data. Users share their private data by\nspecifying some obligations the receivers must follow. We log modifications\ndone by users on the shared data as well as the obligations that must be\nfollowed when data is shared. By a log-auditing mechanism we detect users that\nmisbehaved and we adjust their associated trust values by using any existing\ndecentralized trust model.\n"]}]
