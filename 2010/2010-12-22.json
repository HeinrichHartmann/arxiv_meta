PEL that provides the inherent structure (IS) of a\nsystem is obtained by removing the kinetic energy (including that of\nintermolecular vibrations). Broad Distribution of inherent structure energy\ndemonstrates the larger role of entropy in stabilizing the parent liquid of the\nstructure breaking type of binary mixtures. At high temperature, although the\nparent structure is homogenous, the corresponding inherent structure is found\nto be always phase separated, with a density pattern that exhibits marked\ncorrelation with the energy of inherent structure. Over broad range of\nintermediate inherent structure energy, bicontinuous phase separation prevails\nwith interpenetrating stripes as signatures of spinodal decomposition. At low\ninherent structure energy, the structure is largely phase separated with one\ninterface where as at high inherent structure energy, we find nucleation type\ngrowth. Interestingly, at low temperature, the average inherent structure\nenergy (<EIS>) exhibits a drop with temperature which signals onset of\ncrystallization in one of the phases while the other remains in the liquid\nstate.

It is well-accepted that the classical nucleation theory (CNT) fails to\nprovide a qualitative picture and gives incorrect quantitative values for such\nquantities as activation free energy barrier and supersaturation dependence of\nnucleation rate, especially at large metastability. In this article, we present\na powerful alternative formalism to treat nucleation at large supersaturation.\nThis formalism goes over to the classical picture at small supersaturation\nwhere CNT is expected to be valid. The new theory is based on an extended set\nof order parameters in terms of k-th largest liquid-like clusters where k=1 is\nthe largest cluster in the system, k=2 is the second largest cluster and so on.\nWe derive an analytic expression for the free energy of formation of the k-th\nlargest cluster which shows that at large metastability the barrier of growth\nfor the few largest liquid-like clusters disappear, the nucleation becomes\ncollective and the approach to the critical size occurs by barrierless\ndiffusion in the cluster size space. The expression for the rate of barrier\ncrossing predicts a weaker supersaturation dependence than that of CNT at large\nmetastability. Such a cross-over behavior has indeed been observed in recent\nexperiments but eluded an explanation till now. In order to understand the\nlarge numerical difference between simulation predictions and experimental\nresults, we carried out a study of the dependence on the range of\nintermolecular interaction of both the surface tension of an equilibrium planar\ngas-liquid interface and the free energy barrier of nucleation.

To retrieve any trace gas mixing ratios from these measurements,\nthe atmospheric pressure and temperature have to be known accurately. Thus, a\nprototype retrieval model for the determination of pressure and temperature\nfrom a broadband high resolution infrared Fourier Transform spectrometer\nexperiment with the Sun as a source on board a spacecraft orbiting the planet\nMars is presented. It is found that the pressure and temperature can be\nuniquely solved from remote sensing spectroscopic measurements using a\nRegularized Total Least Squares method and selected pairs of micro-windows\nwithout any a-priori information of the state space parameters and other\nconstraints.\n  The selection of the pairs of suitable micro-windows is based on the\ninformation content analysis. A comparative information content calculation\nusing Bayes theory and a hyperspace formulation are presented to understand the\ninformation available in measurement. A method of minimization of mutual\ninformation is used to search the suitable micro-windows for a simultaneous\npressure and temperature retrieval.\n"]}]

We\ninvestigate the collective behaviour of nematodes in a thin liquid layer, which\nwas first observed by Gray and Lissmann, [J. Exp. Biol. 41, 135 (1964)]. We\nshow experimentally that nematodes confined by a thin liquid film come into\ncontact and only separate again after some intervention. We attribute this\ncollective motion to an attractive force between them arising from the surface\ntension of the layer and show that for nearby nematodes this force is typically\nstronger than the force that may be exerted by the nematodes' muscles. We\nbelieve this to be the first demonstration of the \"Cheerios effect\" acting on a\nliving organism. However, we find that being grouped together does not\nsignificantly alter the body stroke and kinematic performance of the nematode:\nthere are no statistically significant changes of the Strouhal number and the\nratio of amplitude to wavelength when aggregated. This result implies that\nnematodes gain neither a mechanical advantage nor disadvantage by being grouped\ntogether; the capillary force merely draws and keeps them together.\n"]}]
