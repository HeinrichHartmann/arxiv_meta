Previous calculations have found that the two-point function can\nhave a logarithmic running of the form log(k/mu), where k is the wavenumber of\nthe perturbation, and mu is the renormalization scale. We highlight that this\nresult would have profound consequences for both eternal inflation and the\npredictivity of standard inflation. We find a different result.

We find that there is a logarithmic running but of the form\nlog(H/mu), where H is the Hubble constant during inflation. We find this result\nin three independent ways: by performing the calculation with a sharp cutoff in\nfrequency-momentum space, in dimensional regularization and by the simple\nprocedure of making the loop integral dimensionless. For the simplest of our\ntheories we explicitly renormalize the correlation function proving that the\ndivergencies can be reabsorbed and that the correlation function for\nsuper-horizon modes does not depend on time (once the tadpole terms have been\nproperly taken into account). We prove the time-independence of the\nsuper-horizon correlation function in several additional ways: by doing the\ncalculation of the correlation function at finite time using both the\nregularizations and by developing a formalism which expresses loop corrections\ndirectly in terms of renormalized quantities at each time.

The\ntechnical reason for this effect to occur is the property of Bogolubov's\ncoefficients which mix the positive and negative frequencies modes. The\ncorresponding mixture can not be avoided because the projections to positive\n-frequency modes with respect to Minkowski time t and positive -frequency modes\nwith respect to the Rindler observer's proper time \\eta are not equivalent. The\nexact cancellation of unphysical degrees of freedom which is maintained in\nMinkowski space can not hold in the Rindler space.

Previous attempts which assumed\nnon-minimal coupling to gravity failed due to a tachyonic instability of the\nsinglet field during inflation. A canonical K\\\"{a}hler potential with\n\\textit{minimal coupling} to gravity can resolve the tachyonic instability but\nruns into the $\\eta$-problem. We suggest a model which is free of the\n$\\eta$-problem due to an additional coupling in the K\\\"{a}hler potential which\nis allowed by the Standard Model gauge group. This induces directions in the\npotential which we call K-flat. For a certain value of the new coupling in the\n(N)MSSM, the K\\\"{a}hler potential is special, because it can be associated with\na certain shift symmetry for the Higgs doublets, a generalization of the shift\nsymmetry for singlets in earlier models. We find that K-flat direction has\n$H_u^0=-H_d^{0*}.$ This shift symmetry is broken by interactions coming from\nthe superpotential and gauge fields. This direction fails to produce successful\ninflation in the MSSM but produces a viable model in the NMSSM. The model is\nspecifically interesting in the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) limit of the NMSSM.

In numerical charged-particle map generation, fields along a reference\ntrajectory are differentiated multiple times. Any attempt to differentiate\ndirectly such field data multiple times is soon dominated by \"noise\" due to\nfinite meshing and/or measurement errors. This problem can be overcome by the\nuse of field data on a surface outside of the reference trajectory to\nreconstruct the fields along and around the reference trajectory. The integral\nkernels for Laplace's equation that provide interior fields in terms of\nboundary data or boundary sources are smoothing: interior fields will be\nanalytic even if the boundary data or source distributions fail to be\ndifferentiable or are even discontinuous. In our approach, we employ all three\ncomponents of the field on the surface to find a superposition of single-layer\nand double-layer surface source distributions that can be used together with\nsimple, surface-shape-independent kernels for computing vector potentials and\ntheir multiple derivatives (required for a Hamiltonian map integration) at\ninterior points. These distributions and kernels are found by the aid of\nHelmholtz's theorem (or equivalently, by Green's theorem). A novel application\nof the Dirac-monopole vector potential is used to find a kernel for the\nsingle-layer distribution.

The discretisation of such a field is a complex issue\nand particle fluctuations are especially relevant at small scales where\nnon-linear dynamics firstly takes place. In general, most of the procedures\nwhich may discretise a continuous field, gives rise to Poisson noise, which\nwould then dominate the non-linear small-scales dynamics due to\nnearest-neighbours interactions. In order to avoid such a noise, and to\nconsider the dynamics as due only to large scale (smooth) fluctuations, an\nad-hoc method (lattice or glassy system plus correlated displacements) has been\nintroduced and used in cosmological simulations. We show that such a method\ngives rise to a particle distribution which does not have any of the\ncorrelation properties of the theoretical continuous density field.

Moderate-resolution spectra of exceptionally high\nquality were obtained in part to detect broad H-alpha emission, similar in\ncharacter to, but much weaker than, the broad permitted lines that define type\n1 Seyfert nuclei. One of the primary goals of the survey is to better quantify\nthe faint end of the luminosity function of active galactic nuclei. This paper\ndescribes the subset of nuclei showing definite or probable evidence of broad\nH-alpha emission. We outline the procedures for determining the presence of\nthis elusive spectral feature, steps for its quantitative measurement, and the\nassociated systematic errors. Of the 211 emission-line galaxies classified as\nhaving Seyfert or LINER nuclei in our survey, the broad H-alpha line was\ndetected with confidence in 34 objects, and with less certainty in another 12.\nMost of the detections are reported for the first time, and the detection rate\nrepresents a lower limit to the true incidence of active nuclei harboring a\nbroad emission-line region. These statistics imply that broad-lined active\nnuclei are much more common than previously believed: they exist in at least\n20% of all galaxies spectroscopically classified as \"active\" and in more than\n10% of all luminous galaxies at the current epoch.\n","Comment: To appear in the Astrophysical Journal Supplements.

Here we generalize the original Cardassian proposal to include\nadditional variants on the FRW equation. Specific examples are presented.\n  In the ordinary FRW equation, the right hand side is a linear function of the\nenergy density, $H^2 \\sim \\rho$. Here, instead, the right hand side of the FRW\nequation is a different function of the energy density, $H^2 \\sim g(\\rho)$.\nThis function returns to ordinary FRW at early times, but modifies the\nexpansion at a late epoch of the universe. The only ingredients in this\nuniverse are matter and radiation: in particular, there is {\\it no} vacuum\ncontribution. Currently the modification of the FRW equation is such that the\nuniverse accelerates. The universe can be flat and yet consist of only matter\nand radiation, and still be compatible with observations. The energy density\nrequired to close the universe is much smaller than in a standard cosmology, so\nthat matter can be sufficient to provide a flat geometry. The modifications may\narise, e.g., as a consequence of our observable universe living as a\n3-dimensional brane in a higher dimensional universe. The Cardassian model\nsurvives several observational tests, including the cosmic background\nradiation, the age of the universe, the cluster baryon fraction, and structure\nformation. As will be shown in future work, the predictions for observational\ntests of the generalized Cardassian models can be very different from generic\nquintessence models, whether the equation of state is constant or time\ndependent.\n","Comment: 5 pages, Conference Proceeding, Meeting on Sources and Detection of\n  Dark Matter and Dark Energy in the Universe, Marina del Rey, CA, February\n  2002"]}]
