Previous schemes\nmade use of a four-crystal fixed-exit monochromator in Bragg geometry. In such\nmonochromator the X-ray pulse acquires a cm-long path delay, which must be\ncompensated. For a single-bunch self-seeding scheme this requires a long\nelectron beam bypass, implying modifications of the baseline undulator\nconfiguration. To avoid this problem, a double bunch self-seeding scheme based\non a special photoinjector setup was recently proposed. At variance, here we\npropose a new time-domain method of monochromatization exploiting a single\ncrystal in the transmission direction, thus avoiding the problem of extra-path\ndelay for the X-ray pulse. The method can be realized using a temporal\nwindowing technique, requiring a magnetic delay for the electron bunch only.\nThe proposed setup is extremely simple and composed of as few as two simple\nelements. These are the crystal and the short magnetic chicane, which\naccomplishes three tasks by itself. It creates an offset for crystal\ninstallation, it removes the electron micro-bunching produced in the first\nundulator, and it acts as a delay line for temporal windowing. Using a single\ncrystal installed within a short magnetic chicane in the baseline undulator, it\nis possible to decrease the bandwidth of the radiation well beyond the XFEL\ndesign down to 10E-5. The installation of the magnetic chicane does not perturb\nthe undulator focusing system and does not interfere with the baseline mode of\noperation.

Our treatment is\nquite general and our results help to characterize the reachable set at all\ntimes for a class of bilinear control systems with time varying drift and\nunbounded control amplitude. These results are of fundamental interest in\ngeometric control theory and have applications to control of coupled spins in\nsolid state NMR spectroscopy.\n","Comment: 4 pages"]}]
