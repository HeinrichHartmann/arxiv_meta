We prove a\nresult that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms\nof a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite\ndimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant\nsubspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological\nclasses and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given\ntype, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes\nand are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a\nplethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is\nimportant. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth\nrate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives\nsufficient \"marching orders\" to the system to prohibit the formation of any\nother such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical\nsubsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give\nconditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf\ncontaining it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf\ncohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified\nwith the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the\nsmooth and holomorphic setting.\n","Comment: 38 pages"]}]

We pointed out that the traditional concept of\nisomorphism of algebra does not apply here, because there is even no one-one\ncorrespondence between the elements of two seed algebras. The lack of this\none-one correspondence comes from the non-deterministic choice of transitions\nof a process. We introduce a technique of hidden operations to mask unwanted\ndetails of elements of a seed algebra, which only reflect non-determinism or\nother implicit control mechanism of process transition. Elements of a seed\nalgebra are considered as indistinguishable if they show the same behavior\nafter these unwanted details are masked. Each class of indistinguishable\nelements is called a non-hidden closure. We proved that bisimulation of two\nprocesses is equivalent to isomorphism of non-hidden closures of two seed\nalgebras representing these two processes. We call this kind of isomorphism a\ndeep isomorphism. We get different models of seed algebra by specifying\ndifferent axiom systems for the same signature.

PBM was based on a substructure of a ring of\nlocalized bubbles (gluonic hot spots) which initially contain 3-4 partons\ncomposed of almost entirely gluons. The bubbles emitted correlated particles at\nkinetic freezeout, leading to a lumpy fireball surface. For a selection of\ncharged particles (0.8 GeV/c $<$ $p_t$ $<$ 4.0 GeV/c), the PBM reasonably\nquantitatively (within a few percent) explained high precision RHIC\nexperimental correlation analyses in a manner which was consistent with the\nsmall observed HBT source size in this transverse momentum range. We\ndemonstrated that surface emission from a distributed set of surface sources\n(as in the PBM) was necessary to obtain this consistency. In this paper we give\na review of the above comparison to central Au Au collisions. The bubble\nformation can be associated with gluonic objects predicted by a Glasma Flux\nTube Model (GFTM) that formed longitudinal flux tubes in the transverse plane\nof two colliding sheets of Color Glass Condensate (CGC), which pass through one\nanother.

A `program' for growing a desired\nstructure consists of a set of molecular `tiles' designed to have specific\nbinding interactions. A key challenge to making algorithmic self-assembly\npractical is designing tile set programs that make assembly robust to errors\nthat occur during initiation and growth. One method for the controlled\ninitiation of assembly, often seen in biology, is the use of a seed or catalyst\nmolecule that reduces an otherwise large kinetic barrier to nucleation. Here we\nshow how to program algorithmic self-assembly similarly, such that seeded\nassembly proceeds quickly but there is an arbitrarily large kinetic barrier to\nunseeded growth. We demonstrate this technique by introducing a family of tile\nsets for which we rigorously prove that, under the right physical conditions,\nlinearly increasing the size of the tile set exponentially reduces the rate of\nspurious nucleation. Simulations of these `zig-zag' tile sets suggest that\nunder plausible experimental conditions, it is possible to grow large seeded\ncrystals in just a few hours such that less than 1 percent of crystals are\nspuriously nucleated. Simulation results also suggest that zig-zag tile sets\ncould be used for detection of single DNA strands. Together with prior work\nshowing that tile sets can be made robust to errors during properly initiated\ngrowth, this work demonstrates that growth of objects via algorithmic\nself-assembly can proceed both efficiently and with an arbitrarily low error\nrate, even in a model where local growth rules are probabilistic.\n","Comment: 37 pages, 14 figures"]}]

When the number\nof particles is large, the effect caused by the small but finite mass\ndifference between the neutral and charged pions can add up substantially in\nthe quantum evolution of an initially coherent state. As a result, the states\nwith quite different numbers of neutral or charged pions are essentially\nincoherent. The importance of the quantum scattering in the final-state isospin\ncharge distribution of a disoriented chiral condensate (DCC) is investigated.\nWe find that the scattering effect significantly reduces the spectacular\nCentauro and anti-Centauro events.
