The key to the quantum topological order is the coexistence of\nspin-orbit coupling with proximity-induced s-wave superconductivity and an\nexternally-induced Zeeman coupling of the spins. For the Zeeman coupling below\na critical value, the system is a non-topological (proximity-induced) s-wave\nsuperconductor. However, for a range of Zeeman coupling above the critical\nvalue, the lowest energy excited state inside a vortex is a zero-energy\nMajorana fermion state. The system, thus, has entered into a non-Abelian s-wave\nsuperconducting state via a topological quantum phase transition (TQPT) tuned\nby the Zeeman coupling. In the one-dimensional version of the same structure\nand for the Zeeman coupling above the critical value, there are localized\nMajorana zero-energy modes at the two ends of a semiconducting quantum\nnanowire. In this case, the Zeeman coupling can be induced more easily by an\nexternal magnetic field parallel to the wire, obviating the need for a magnetic\ninsulator. We show that, despite the fact that the superconducting pair\npotential in the nanowire is explicitly s-wave, tunneling of electrons to the\nends of the wire reveals a pronounced zero-bias peak. Such a peak is absent\nwhen the Zeeman coupling is below its critical value, i.e., the nanowire is in\nthe non-topological s-wave superconducting state.

In the peak model pioneered by BBKS, one considers instead\ndensity maxima of the initial, Gaussian mass density field as an approximation\nto the formation site of virialized objects. In this paper, the peak model is\nextended in two ways to improve its predictive accuracy. Firstly, we derive the\ntwo-point correlation function of initial density peaks up to second order and\ndemonstrate that a peak-background split approach can be applied to obtain the\nk-independent and k-dependent peak bias factors at all orders. Secondly, we\nexplore the gravitational evolution of the peak correlation function within the\nZel'dovich approximation. We show that the local (Lagrangian) bias approach\nemerges as a special case of the peak model, in which all bias parameters are\nscale-independent and there is no statistical velocity bias.

We\ntherefore investigate an alternative mode in which messages are stored by relay\nvehicles traveling in the opposite direction, and forwarded to vehicles in the\noriginal direction at a later time. The wireless communication consists of two\n`transversal' message hops across driving directions. Since direct connectivity\nfor transversal hops and a successful message transmission to vehicles in the\ndestination region is only a matter of time, the quality of this IVC strategy\ncan be described in terms of the distribution function for the total\ntransmission time.

We explore and exploit this\ninterplay to obtain new insight into nucleation phenomena. Just like its\ndependence on supersaturation (S), the free energy barrier of nucleation is\nfound to depend strongly on the range of the interaction potential. Actually,\nthe entire free energy surface, F(n), where n is the size of the liquid-like\ncluster, shows this dependence. The evidences and the reasons for this strong\ndependence are as follows. (i) The surface tension increases dramatically on\nincreasing the range of interaction potential. In three dimensional\nLennard-Jones system, the value of the surface tension increases from 0.494 for\na cut-off of 2.5 {\\sigma} to 1.09 when the full range of the potential is\ninvolved. In two dimensional LJ system, the value of the line tension increases\nfrom 0.05 to 0.18, under the same variation of the potential range. (ii) The\ndensity of the gas phase at coexistence decreases while that of the liquid\nphase increases substantially on increasing the range of the interaction\npotential. (iii) As a result of the above, at a given supersaturation S, the\nsize of the critical nucleus and the free energy barrier both increase with\nincrease in the range of interaction potential. (iv) Surprisingly, however, we\nfind that the functional form predicted by the classical nucleation theory\n(CNT) for the dependence of the free energy barrier on the size of the nucleus\nto remain valid except at the largest value of S studied.

An example is considered to draw a comparison between\nclassical and quantum version of the game. Our choice of most general initial\nquantum state enables us to make the game symmetric or asymmetric. We show that\nfor a particular set of game parameters where there exist only mixed ESS in the\nclassical version of the game, however, quantization allows even a pure\nstrategy to be an ESS for symmetric game in addition to ixed ESS. On the other\nhand only pure strategy ESS can exist for asymmetric quantum version of the\nHawk-Dove game.\n","Comment: Revised version. LaTex, 11 pages, no figure.
