The published distant and local Ia SNe\nused for the Supernova Legacy Survey first-year cosmology report form the\nsample for this study. While previous work has assumed that the local SNe are\nat rest in the CMB frame (the No Flow assumption), we test this assumption by\napplying peculiar velocity corrections to the local SNe using three different\nflow models. The models are based on the IRAS PSCz galaxy redshift survey, have\nvarying beta = Omega_m^0.6/b, and reproduce the Local Group motion in the CMB\nframe. These datasets are then fit for w, Omega_m, and Omega_Lambda using\nflatness or LambdaCDM and a BAO prior. The chi^2 statistic is used to examine\nthe effect of the velocity corrections on the quality of the fits. The most\nfavored model is the beta=0.5 model, which produces a fit significantly better\nthan the No Flow assumption, consistent with previous peculiar velocity\nstudies. By comparing the No Flow assumption with the favored models we derive\nthe largest potential systematic error in w caused by ignoring peculiar\nvelocities to be Delta w = +0.04.

We identified\n23 X-ray sources within the central 30' x 30' region of IC342. Our HRC-I\nobservation resolved the historical Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULX), X3, near\nthe nucleus into 2 sources, namely C12 and C13, for the first time. The\nbrighter source C12, with L(0.08-10keV)=(6.66\\pm0.45)\\times10^{38}ergs^-1, was\nspatially extended (~82 pc x 127 pc). From the astrometric registration of the\nX-ray image, C12 was at R.A.=03h:46m:48.43s, decl.=+68d05m47.45s, and was\ncloser to the nucleus than C13.

Screening of variables, as\nintroduced in \\cite{fan08sis}, is an efficient and highly scalable way to\nremove many irrelevant variables from the set of all variables, while retaining\nall the relevant variables. S-OMP can be applied to problems with hundreds of\nthousands of variables and once the number of variables is reduced to a\nmanageable size, a more computationally demanding procedure can be used to\nidentify the relevant variables for each of the regression outputs. To our\nknowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize relatedness of multiple outputs\nto perform fast screening of relevant variables.

We establish that the most likely CXB intensity level at\nits emission peak (26-28 keV) is ~40 keV/cm2/s/sr, a value consistent with that\nderived from the best available CXB measurement obtained over 25 years ago with\nthe first High Energy Astronomical Observatory satellite mission (HEAO-1;\nGruber et al. 1999), whose intensity, lying well below the extrapolation of\nsome lower energy measurements performed with focusing telescopes, was\nquestioned in the recent years. We find that 90% of the acceptable solutions of\nour best fit model to the PDS data give a 20-50 keV CXB flux lower than 6.5E-08\nerg/cm2/s/sr, which is 12% higher than that quoted by Gruber et al.
