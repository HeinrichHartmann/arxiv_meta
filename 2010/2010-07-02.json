The classical gaps and angles of Dixmier and Friedrichs are\ncharacterized in terms of the angles. We introduce principal invariant\nsubspaces and prove that they are connected by an isometry that appears in the\npolar decomposition of the product of corresponding orthogonal projectors.\nPoint angles are defined by analogy with the point operator spectrum. We bound\nthe Hausdorff distance between the sets of the squared cosines of the angles\ncorresponding to the original subspaces and their perturbations. We show that\nthe squared cosines of the angles from one subspace to another can be\ninterpreted as Ritz values in the Rayleigh-Ritz method, where the former\nsubspace serves as a trial subspace and the orthogonal projector of the latter\nsubspace serves as an operator in the Rayleigh-Ritz method. The Hausdorff\ndistance between the Ritz values, corresponding to different trial subspaces,\nis shown to be bounded by a constant times the gap between the trial subspaces.\nWe prove a similar eigenvalue perturbation bound that involves the gap squared.\nFinally, we consider the classical alternating projectors method and propose\nits ultimate acceleration, using the conjugate gradient approach. The\ncorresponding convergence rate estimate is obtained in terms of the angles.

We explore\nthe stability of these equilibrium states and show that all states are saddle\npoints of entropy and can, in principle, be destabilized by a perturbation with\na larger wavenumber, resulting in a structure at the smallest available scale.\nThis mechanism is therefore reminiscent of the 3D Richardson energy cascade\ntowards smaller and smaller scales. Therefore, our system is truly intermediate\nbetween 2D turbulence (coherent structures) and 3D turbulence (energy cascade).\nWe further explore numerically the robustness of the equilibrium states with\nrespect to random perturbations using a relaxation algorithm in both canonical\nand microcanonical ensembles. We show that saddle points of entropy can be very\nrobust and therefore play a role in the dynamics. We evidence differences in\nthe robustness of the solutions in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles.\nA scenario of bifurcation between two different equilibria (with one or two\ncells) is proposed and discussed in connection with a recent observation of a\nturbulent bifurcation in a von Karman experiment [Ravelet et al., Phys.

The morphology of supernova remnants is also expected to be\nmodified when efficient particle acceleration occurs at their shocks. Aims: The\nimpact of the Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities from the ejecta-dominated to the\nSedov-Taylor phase is investigated over one octant of the supernova remnant.

The adiabatic index of a relativistic gas between\nthe forward shock and the contact discontinuity mimics the presence of\naccelerated particles.

Conclusions: The development of the Rayleigh-Taylor structures is\naffected, although not drastically, if the blast wave is dominated by cosmic\nrays.

But until now no mechanism proposed has\nsatisfactorily explained this phenomenon. Objective: The aim of this research\nis to propose a mechanism, until now never considered, which could drive the\natmosphere of Venus in its superrotation. This mechanism involves the transfer\nof the transterminator ionospheric flow momentum to the lower atmosphere via\npressure waves generated in the cryosphere of Venus. The mechanism proposed\npresents a source of energy sufficiently strong to allow the transfer of energy\ndespite dissipation. Method: The energy flow which transports the\ntransterminator flow and the energy lost by the viscosity in the superrotating\natmosphere were calculated. Both results were compared to establish if there is\nsufficient energy in the transterminator flow to drive the superrotation.\nFinally, the amplitude that the waves should have to be able to obtain the\nmomentum necessary to induce superrotation was calculated. Also an experimental\nmodel was made presenting some similarities with the process described.\nResults: The calculated power for the transterminator flow is 8.48x10e10 W. The\ncalculated viscous dissipation of the superrotating flow is 1.4x10e9 W.\nTherefore, there is sufficient energy in the transterminator flow to maintain\nsuperrotation. The amplitude of the waves generated in the cryosphere,\nnecessary to deposit the power dissipated by the viscous forces, is 10e-4 m for\nwaves of 1 Hz and 10e-8 m for waves of 10e4 Hz. These amplitudes imply that at\nthe altitude of the clouds on the night side there must be a constant sound of\n83 dB.

The first involves the application of kurtosis and\nskewness on the vector magnitude of three component seismograms. Customarily,\nP-wave arrival detection techniques use vertical component seismogram which is\nappropriate only for teleseismic events. The inherent weakness of those methods\nstems from the fact that the energy from P-wave is distributed among horizontal\nand vertical recording channels. Our procedure, however, uses the vector\nmagnitude which accommodates all components. The results show that this\nprocedure would be useful for detecting/picking of P-arrivals from local and\nregional earthquakes and man-made explosions. The second procedure introduces a\nnew method called \"Ratios in Higher Order Statistics (RHOS).\" Unlike commonly\nused techniques that involve derivatives, this technique employs ratios of\nadjacent kurtosis and skewness values to improve the accuracy of the detection\nof the P onset. RHOS can be applied independently on vertical component\nseismogram as well as the vector magnitude for improved detection of P-wave\narrivals.\n"]}]

Moreover, it can be\nrepresented as two or more figures that can be have different properties to\neach other. For the purpose of HCP, we represent a graph by two such figures.\nIn each of them, there is an exterior part called the contour, and an interior\npart. These two figures differ from each other by the constitution of the edges\nin the interior part. That is, any edges in the interior part for one figure\nare not in the interior for the other figure.

Individually, neither of these\nrepresentations possess the features to easily determine the Hamiltonicity of\nthe graph. However, the combination of these two figures, once certain weights\nare assigned to their edges, allows us to determine the Hamiltonicity with a\npolynomial-time check. The rules for the assignment of weights are: 1. The\nweight of any edge of the interior part is 0, for both objects. 2. In both\nfigures any common edge of the contour has the same weight. The weights of the\nedges allow us to extend the number of parameters of the objects, that is\nsufficient to determine the Hamiltonicity of the graph. Then, if the graph is\nHamiltonian, then both figures possess the same set of parameters. If the sets\nof parameters for two figures are different, then the graph is not Hamiltonian.\nThe parameters that determine the Hamiltonicity of the graph are the sums of\nweights of edges and windows of contours in the figure.
