This has generated the conviction that in the past\nearly-type galaxies were more compact, hence denser, and that as a consequence,\nthey should have increased their radius across the time to reconcile with the\npresent-day ones. However, observations have not yet established whether the\npopulation of early-types in the early Universe was fully represented by\ncompact galaxies nor if they were so much more numerous than in the present-day\nUniverse to require an evolution of their sizes. Here we report the results of\na study based on a complete sample of 34 early-type galaxies at\n0.9<z_{spec}<1.92. We find a majority (62 per cent) of normal early-type\ngalaxies similar to typical local ones, co-existing with compact early-types\nfrom ~2 to ~6 times smaller in spite of the same mass and redshift. The\nco-existence of normal and compact early-type galaxies at <z>~1.5 suggests that\ntheir build-up taken place in the first 3-4 Gyr, followed distinct paths. Also,\nwe find that the number density of compact early-types at <z>~1.5 is consistent\nwith the lower limits of the local number density of compact early-types\nderived from local clusters of galaxies. The similar number of compact\nearly-types found in the early and in the present day Universe frustrates the\nhypothesized effective radius evolution while provides evidence that also\ncompact ETGs were as we see them today 9-10 Gyr ago. Finally, the fact that (at\nleast) most of the compact ETGs at high-z are accounted for by compact\nearly-types in local cluster of galaxies implies that the former are the direct\nprogenitors of the compact early-type cluster galaxies establishing a direct\nlink between environment and early phases of assembly of ETGs.\n","Comment: Published on MNRAS Letters (5 pages, 2 figures, 1 table)"]}]

Among intermediate-mass and massive stars, fast\nrotators are common objects. Taking the rotation effects into account is needed\nto correctly understand, identify, and interpret the observed oscillation\nfrequencies of these stars. A classical approach is to consider the rotation as\na perturbation. In this paper, we focus on gravity modes, such as those\noccurring in gamma Doradus, slowly pulsating B (SPB), or Be stars. We aim to\ndefine the suitability of perturbative methods. With the two-dimensional\noscillation program (TOP), we performed complete computations of gravity modes\n-including the Coriolis force, the centrifugal distortion, and compressible\neffects- in 2-D distorted polytropic models of stars. We started with the modes\nl=1, n=1-14, and l=2-3, n=1-5,16-20 of a nonrotating star, and followed these\nmodes by increasing the rotation rate up to 70% of the break-up rotation rate.\nWe then derived perturbative coefficients and determined the domains of\nvalidity of the perturbative methods. Second-order perturbative methods are\nsuited to computing low-order, low-degree mode frequencies up to rotation\nspeeds ~100 km/s for typical gamma Dor stars or ~150 km/s for B stars. The\ndomains of validity can be extended by a few tens of km/s thanks to the\nthird-order terms. For higher order modes, the domains of validity are\nnoticeably reduced. Moreover, perturbative methods are inefficient for modes\nwith frequencies lower than the Coriolis frequency 2Omega. We interpret this\nfailure as a consequence of a modification in the shape of the resonant cavity\nthat is not taken into account in the perturbative approach.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 6 figures, Astronomy & Astrophysics (in press)"]}]

Distinct scenarios emerge,\ndepending on the mechanism and the scale of SUSY-breaking mediation. In\nparticular, we propose an appealing and economical picture in which the heavy\nseesaw mediators are also messengers of SUSY breaking. In this case, strong\ncorrelations exist among neutrino parameters, sparticle and Higgs masses, as\nwell as lepton flavour violating processes.

The quantum theory of\nmeasurement can be interpreted without the intervention of human minds, but\nother fields of science cannot contemplate the mentalist scenario, so it is\nconcluded that QM has nothing to say about the mind or free will, and its\nscientific explanation is more related to biology than to physics.
