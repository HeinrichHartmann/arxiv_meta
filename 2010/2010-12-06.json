Our results are\nconsistent with zero supersolid flow in response to the imposed low frequency\npressure gradient. A statistical analysis of our data sets a bound, at the 68%\nconfidence level, of 9.6$\\times 10^{-4}$ nm/s for the mass transport velocity\ncarried by a possible supersolid flow. In terms of a simple model for the\nsupersolid, an upper bound of 3.3$\\times 10^{-6}$ is set for the supersolid\nfraction at 25 mK, at this same confidence level. These findings force the\nconclusion that the NCRI observed in the torsional oscillator experiments is\nnot evidence for a frequency independent superfluid-like state. Supersolid\nbehavior is a frequency-dependent phenomenon, clearly evident in the frequency\nrange of the torsional oscillator experiments, but undetectably small at\nfrequencies approaching zero.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 5 figures"]}]

A framework is a maximal set of\nproperties of a system for which probabilities can be consistently defined.\nThis notion is expressed by saying that a framework provides an exhaustive set\nof exclusive alternatives (ESEA), but no single framework suffices to fully\ncharacterize a quantum system. Indeed, the existence of multiple incompatible\nframeworks is the hallmark of quantum mechanical behavior.

The resulting zero-temperature phase\ndiagram includes a 1D quasi-ordered phase, a 2D Neel ordered phase, and a 2D\nspiraling ordered phase. We have strong indications that the various ordered or\nquasi-ordered phases are separated by spin-liquid phases with short-range\ncorrelations, in analogy to what has been predicted for the Heisenberg model on\nthe same lattice. Within MSW theory we also explore the finite-temperature\nphase diagram. We find that the zero-temperature long-range-ordered phases turn\ninto quasi-ordered phases (up to a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless\ntemperature), while zero-temperature quasi-ordered phases become short-range\ncorrelated at finite temperature. These results show that modified spin-wave\ntheory is very well suited for describing ordered and quasi-ordered phases of\nfrustrated XY spins (or, equivalently, of frustrated lattice bosons) both at\nzero and finite temperatures. While MSW theory, just as other theoretical\nmethods, cannot describe spin-liquid phases, its breakdown provides a fast\nmethod for singling out Hamiltonians which may feature these intriguing quantum\nphases.

Systematic surveys of the tunneling spectra\ntaken with Pt/Ir tips reveal spatial variations on the length scale of a few\nhundred nanometers in the ferromagnetic state, which may be attributed to the\nintrinsic heterogeneity of the manganites due to their tendency towards phase\nseparation. The electronic heterogeneity is found to decrease either with\nincreasing field at low temperatures or at temperatures above all magnetic\nordering temperatures. On the other hand, spectra taken with Cr-coated tips are\nconsistent with convoluted electronic properties of both LCMO and Cr. In\nparticular, for temperatures below the magnetic ordering temperatures of both\nCr and LCMO, the magnetic-field dependent tunneling spectra may be\nquantitatively explained by the scenario of spin-polarized tunneling in a\nspin-valve configuration. Moreover, a low-energy insulating energy gap $\\sim\n0.6$ eV commonly found in the tunneling conductance spectra of bulk metallic\nLCMO at $T \\to 0$ may be attributed to a surface ferromagnetic insulating (FI)\nphase, as evidenced by its spin filtering effect at low temperatures and\nvanishing gap value above the Curie temperature.

The central concentration of early black\nholes in present day galaxies is reduced if they are born even with moderate\nkicks of tens of km/s. The modest kicks allow the black holes to leave their\nparent halo, which consequently leads to dynamical friction being less\neffective on the lower mass black holes as compared to those still embedded in\ntheir parent halos. Therefore, merger rates may be reduced by more than an\norder of magnitude. Using analytical and illustrative cosmological N--body\nsimulations we quantify the role of natal kicks of black holes formed from\nmassive metal free stars on their merger rates with supermassive black holes in\npresent day galaxies.
