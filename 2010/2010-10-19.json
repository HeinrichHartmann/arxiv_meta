These VLBI\nobservations represent the first scientific results from a new antenna in NZ\nand the first antenna of the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP). A compact\ndouble radio source, PKS 1934-638, has been monitored over a period of 40\nyears, and the observation described here provides the latest datum, eight\nyears after the previous observation, to aid in the study of the long-term\nevolution of the source structure. We take advantage of these new long\nbaselines to probe PKS 1934-638 at the relatively low frequency of 1.4 GHz, in\norder to examine the effects of optical depth on the structure of the radio\nsource. Optical depth effects, resulting in the observation of frequency\ndependent structure, may have previously been interpreted in terms of an\nexpansion of the source as a function of time. Expansion and frequency\ndependent effects are important to disentangle in order to estimate the age of\nPKS 1934-638. We show that frequency dependent structure effects are likely to\nbe important in PKS 1934-638 and present a simple two-dimensional synchrotron\nsource model in which opacity effects due to synchrotron self-absorption are\ntaken into account. Evidence for expansion of the radio source over 40 years is\ntherefore weak, with consequences for the estimated age of the radio source.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 5 figures.

The secondary spheres are visibly seen to be affected by the\nbow shock wave of the primary bodies in the form of quite beautiful\ntrajectories. Computational images were obtained from a simulation using the\nAMROC code.

Although the GSM standard\nallows for a cell phone to receive signal strength information from up to seven\ncell towers, many of today's cell phones are low-end phones, with limited API\nsupport, that gives only information about the associated cell tower. In\naddition, in many places in the world, the density of cell towers is very small\nand therefore, the available cell tower information for localization is very\nlimited. This raises the challenge of accurately determining the cell phone\nlocation with very limited information, mainly the RSSI of the associated cell\ntower.

However, TFETs do face certain special challenges, particularly with\nrespect to the process induced variations in (i) the channel length and (ii)\nthe thickness of the silicon thin-film and the gate oxide. This paper, for the\nfirst time, studies the impact of the above process variations on the\nelectrical characteristics of a Double Gate Tunnel Field Effect Transistor\n(DGTFET). Using two dimensional device simulations, we propose the Strained\nDouble Gate Tunnel Field Effect Transistor (SDGTFET) with high-k gate\ndielectric as a possible solution for effectively compensating the process\ninduced variations in the on-current, threshold voltage and subthreshold-swing\nimproving the reliability of the DGTFET.\n","Comment: Journal Paper"]}]

The main purpose of our non-standard approach\nto Colombeau' theory is the improvement of the properties of the scalars of the\nvarieties of spaces of generalized functions: in our non-standard approach the\nsets of scalars of the functional spaces always form algebraically closed\nnon-archimedean Cantor complete fields. In contrast, the scalars of the\nfunctional spaces in Colombeau's theory are rings with zero divisors. The\nimprovement of the scalars leads to other improvements and simplifications of\nColombeau's theory such as reducing the number of quantifiers and possibilities\nfor an axiomatization of the theory. Some of the algebras we construct in these\nnotes have already counterparts in Colombeau's theory, other seems to be\nwithout counterpart. We present applications of the theory to PDE and\nmathematical physics. Although our approach is directed mostly to Colombeau's\ncommunity, the readers who are already familiar with non-standard methods might\nalso find a short and comfortable way to learn about Colombeau's theory: a new\nbranch of functional analysis which naturally generalizes the Schwartz theory\nof distributions with numerous applications to partial differential equations,\ndifferential geometry, relativity theory and other areas of mathematics and\nphysics.\n","Comment: 70 pages"]}]

In agreement with the recent experiments (PRL, 92, 155506, 2004),\nGe-O coordination increases under compression. For 1650 K, at ~11.5 GPa the\nstructure becomes 6 coordinated with a discontinuous change in the density. The\ntransition from the low density liquid (LDL) to high density liquid (HDL) is\nfound to be reversible and the transition pressure increases with the\ntemperature. At lower temperatures, the low density to high density transition\nis found to be continuous, but with the coexistence of two structures.\n","Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the authors.

This representation produces side effects\nso that numerical tests are necessary to deal with the limiting situations of\nthe small-particle (Rayleigh) and forward/backward scattering.
