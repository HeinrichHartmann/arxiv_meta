We prove the existence of an affine H(k0)-equivariant CLF-map j from\nthe enlarged Bruhat-Tits building B^1(H,k0) to B^1(G,k0). As conjectured by\nBroussous the CLF-property determines j, if none of the factors of H is\nk0-isomorphic to the isotropic orthogonal group of k0-rank one and all factors\nare unitary groups. Under the weaker assumption that the affine CLF-map j is\nonly equivariant under the center of H^0(k0) it is uniquely determined up to a\ntranslation of B^1(H,k0). The second part is devoted to the decoding of\nembedding types by the geometry of a CLF-map. Embedding types have been studied\nby Broussous and M. Grabitz. We consider a division algebra D of finite index\nwith a p-adic center F. The construction of simple types for GLn(D) in the\nBudhnell-Kutzko framework required an investigation of strata which had to\nfulfil a rigidity property. Giving a stratum especially means to fix a pair\n(E,a) consisting of a field extension E|F in Mn(D) and a hereditary order a\nwhich is stable under conjugation by E^x, in other words we fix an embedding of\nE^x into the normalizer of a. Broussous and Grabitz classified these pairs with\ninvariants. We describe and prove a way to decode these invariants using the\ngeometry of a CLF-map.\n"]}]

By searching for\ntiming signals at the frequencies of the QPOs discovered in the 2004 December\n27 giant flare from the source, we find three QPOs at 84, 103, and 648 Hz in\nthree different bursts.

The detected\nQPOs are found in bursts with different durations, morphologies, and\nbrightness, and are vindicated by Monte Carlo simulations.

The fact that we can find evidence for QPOs in the\nrecurrent bursts at frequencies relatively close to those found in the giant\nflare is intriguing and can offer insight about the origin of the oscillations.\nWe confront our findings against the available theoretical models and discuss\nthe physical interpretation of these QPOs. The leading interpretation for the\norigin of magnetar QPOs suggests that these toroidal seismic oscillatory modes\nare most likely to be excited by a crustquake of the neutron star crust. Other\nmodels have been proposed to explain the magnetar QPO phenomena including\nmagnetospheric oscillations, magnetic flux tubes and modes of a passive debris\ndisk.
