Indeed, if we select the so called natural fractal structure on each\neuclidean space, then we will get the box-counting dimension as a particular\ncase. Recall that box-counting dimension could be calculated over any euclidean\nspace, although it can be defined over any metrizable one. Nevertheless, the\nnew definition we present can be computed on an easy way over any space\nadmitting a fractal structure. Thus, since a space is metrizable if and only if\nit supports a starbase fractal structure, our model allows to classify and\ndistinguish a much larger number of topological spaces than the classical\ndefinition. On the other hand, our aim consists also of studying some\napplications of effective calculation of the fractal dimension over a kind of\ncontexts where the box-counting dimension has no sense, like the domain of\nwords, which appears when modeling the streams of information in Kahn's\nparallel computation model.

A radio air shower detector can extend IceTop,\nthe air shower detector on top of IceCube. This could increase the sensitivity\nof IceTop to higher shower energies and for inclined showers significantly.\nMuons from air showers are a major part of the background of the neutrino\ntelescope IceCube. Thus a surface radio air shower detector could act as a veto\ndetector for this muonic background. Initial radio background measurements with\na single antenna in 2007 revealed a continuous electromagnetic background\npromising a low energy threshold of radio air shower detection. However, short\npulsed radio interferences can mimic real signals and have to be identified in\nthe frequency range of interest. These properties of the electromagnetic\nbackground was being measured at the South Pole during the Antarctic winter\n2009 with two different types of surface antennas. In total four antennas are\nplaced at distances ranging up to 400m from each other. In 2010 a small eight\nchannel surface detector will test an amplitude threshold self trigger strategy\nwith large dipole antennas on the South Pole snow ground. The installation will\nbe described.\n"]}]
