In this paper, we propose prime\nfactor cyclotomic Fourier transforms (PFCFTs), which use CFFTs as sub-DFTs via\nthe prime factor algorithm. When the length of DFTs is prime, our PFCFTs reduce\nto CFFTs. When the length has co-prime factors, since the sub-DFTs have much\nshorter lengths, this allows us to use CSE to significantly reduce their\nadditive complexity. In comparison to previously proposed fast Fourier\ntransforms, our PFCFTs achieve reduced overall complexity when the length of\nDFTs is at least 255, and the improvement significantly increases as the length\ngrows. This approach also enables us to propose efficient DFTs with very long\nlength (e.g., 4095-point), first efficient DFTs of such lengths in the\nliterature. Finally, our PFCFTs are also advantageous for hardware\nimplementation due to their regular structure.\n","Comment: submitted to SiPS 2010, accepted"]}]
