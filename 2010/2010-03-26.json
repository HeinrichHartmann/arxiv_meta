Many previous\nalgorithms for distributed topology control have assumed an ability at each\nnode to deduce some location-based information such as the direction and the\ndistance of its neighbor nodes with respect to itself. Such a deduction of\nlocation-based information, however, cannot be relied upon in real environments\nwhere the path loss exponents vary greatly leading to significant errors in\ndistance estimates. Also, multipath effects may result in different signal\npaths with different loss characteristics, and none of these paths may be\nline-of-sight, making it difficult to estimate the direction of a neighboring\nnode.

The regulator map to Deligne cohomology was computed by Deninger\nwith the help of the Eisenstein symbol. For the Tamagawa number conjecture one\nneeds an understanding of the $p$-adic regulator on the subspace of K-theory\ndefined by the Eisenstein symbol. This is accomplished by giving a new explicit\ncomputation of the specialization of the elliptic polylogarithm sheaf. It turns\nout that this sheaf is an inverse limit of $p^r$-torsion points of a certain\none-motive. The cohomology classes of the elliptic polylogarithm sheaf can then\nbe described by classes of sections of certain line bundles.

We present the\nfirst estimates of the changes induced in the spin-dependent, valence parton\ndistributions of the proton and neutron bound in $^3$He and $^6$Li. For $^3$He\nthe result is quite reassuring, in that the off-shell correction to $g_{1n}$ is\nvery small. On the other hand, in $^6$Li the corrections to the spin\ndistributions in the bound proton are sufficiently large that they should be\ntaken into account if one aims for a precision of better than 10%. We provide a\nsimple parametrization of the off-shell changes in the valence spin\ndistributions of $^3$He and $^6$Li, which can be used with any conventional\nestimate of nuclear binding and Fermi motion corrections.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 4 ps figures.
