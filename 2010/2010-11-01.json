Aims. We want to test the\nrotational mixing prescriptions included in the Geneva stellar evolution code\n(GENEC) by following the evolution of surface abundances of light isotopes in\nmassive stars. Methods. The GENEC is a 1D code containing sophisticated\nprescriptions for rotational mixing. We implemented an extended reaction\nnetwork into this code including the light elements Li, Be and B, which allowed\nus to perform calculations testing the rotation induced mixing. Results. We\nfollowed 9, 12 and 15 solar mass models with rotation from the zero age main\nsequence up to the end of He burning. The calculations show the expected\nbehaviour with faster depletion of light isotopes for faster rotating stars and\nmore massive stars. Conclusions. We find that the mixing prescriptions used in\nthe present rotating models for massive single stars can account for most of\nthe observations. However the uncertainties are quite large making it hard to\ndraw a firm conclusion on the mixing scenario.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in the Astronomy & Astrophysics. 14 pages,\n  10 figures"]}]

The biophysical properties of\nthese neurons are essential for the operation of the vestibular neural\nintegrator that converts a head velocity signal to one that controls eye\nposition. A novel method named QSA (quadratic sinusoidal analysis) for voltage\nclamped neurons was used to quantify nonlinear responses that are dominated by\ndendrites. The voltage clamp currents were measured at harmonic and interactive\nfrequencies using specific stimulation frequencies, which act as frequency\nprobes of the intrinsic nonlinear neuronal behavior. These responses to paired\nfrequencies form a matrix that can be reduced by eigendecomposition to provide\na very compact piecewise quadratic analysis at different membrane potentials\nthat otherwise is usually described by complex differential equations involving\na large numbers of parameters and dendritic compartments. Moreover, the QSA\nmatrix can be interpolated to capture most of the nonlinear neuronal behavior\nlike a Volterra kernel. The interpolated quadratic functions of the two major\nprepositus hypoglossi neurons, namely type B and D, are strikingly different. A\nmajor part of the nonlinear responses is due to the persistent sodium\nconductance, which appears to be essential for sustained nonlinear effects\ninduced by NMDA activation and thus would be critical for the operation of the\nneural integrator. Finally, the dominance of the nonlinear responses by the\ndendrites supports the hypothesis that persistent sodium conductance channels\nand NMDA receptors act synergistically to dynamically control the influence of\nindividual synaptic inputs on network behavior.\n"]}]

The absence of an anomaly in the fermion current would then\nappear to inhibit anomalous processes, such as electroweak baryogenesis in the\nearly universe. One way to circumvent this problem is to formulate the theory\nsuch that this U(1) symmetry is explicitly broken. However we argue that in the\nframework of spectral flow, fermion creation and annihilation still in fact\noccurs, despite the exact fermion number conservation. The crucial observation\nis that fermions are excitations relative to the vacuum, at the surface of the\nDirac sea. The exact global U(1) symmetry prohibits a state from changing its\nfermion number during time evolution, however nothing prevents the fermionic\nground state from doing so. We illustrate our reasoning with a model in two\ndimensions which has axial-vector couplings, first using a sharp momentum\ncutoff, then using the lattice regulator with staggered fermions. The\ndifference in fermion number between the time evolved state and the ground\nstate is indeed in agreement with the anomaly. A study of the vacuum energy\nshows that the perturbative counterterm needed for restoration of gauge\ninvariance is insufficient in a nonperturbative setting.

Three time scales\nare involved in the problem and therefore caution is needed to achieve\nnumerical stability for this system.

The dominant contributor to the width\ndifference is the $b\\rightarrow c\\bar c s$ transition, with final states common\nto both $B_s$ and $\\overline{B}_s$. All current experimental analyses fit the\ntime-dependences of flavor-specific $B_s$-modes to a single exponential, which\nessentially determines the average $B_s$ lifetime. We stress that the same data\nsample allows even the measurement of the width difference. To see that, this\nnote reviews the time-dependent formulae for tagged $B_s$ decays, which involve\nrapid oscillatory terms depending on $\\Delta mt$. In untagged data samples the\nrapid oscillatory terms cancel. Their time-evolutions depend only on the much\nmore slowly varying exponential falloffs. We discuss in detail the extraction\nof the two widths, and identify the large (small) CP-even (-odd) rate with that\nof the light (heavy) $B_s$ mass eigenstate. It is demonstrated that decay\nlength distributions of some \\underline{untagged} $B_s$ modes, such as $\\rho^0\nK_S, \\; D_s^{(*)\\pm}K^{(*)\\mp}$, can be used to extract the notoriously\ndifficult CKM unitarity triangle angle $\\gamma$.

Within\nthe CKM model, the ratio $\\Delta\\Gamma/ \\Delta m$ involves no CKM parameters,\nonly a QCD uncertainty. Thus a measurement of $\\Delta\\Gamma \\;(\\Delta m)$ would\npredict $\\Delta m \\;(\\Delta\\Gamma )$, up to the QCD uncertainty. A large width\ndifference would automatically solve the puzzle of the number of charmed\nhadrons per $B$ decay in favor of theory.

Due to the sizeable energy gap\nbetween PEP and LEP, we are sensitive to the scaling violation in the\nfragmentation process, which allows us to extract a value for the asymptotic\nscale parameter of QCD, $\\Lambda$. Recent data on inclusive charged-hadron\nproduction in tagged three-jet events by OPAL and similar data for longitudinal\nelectron polarization by ALEPH allow us to pin down the gluon fragmentation\nfunctions. Our new fragmentation functions lead to an excellent description of\na multitude of other $e^+e^-$ data on inclusive charged-hadron production,\nranging from $\\sqrt s=5.2$~GeV to LEP energy. In addition, they agree nicely\nwith the transverse-momentum spectra of single charged hadrons measured by H1\nand ZEUS in photoproduction at the $ep$ collider HERA, which represents a\nnontrivial check of the factorization theorem of the QCD-improved parton model.\n","Comment: 22 pages, latex, 13 compressed ps figures in separate file"]}]
