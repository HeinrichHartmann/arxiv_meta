Both the theoretical and experimental results state that the proposed\nalgorithm has many capabilities such as acceptable speed and complexity in the\nalgorithm due to the existence of two coupling parameter and high security.\nNote that the ciphertext has a flat distribution and has the same size as the\nplaintext.

Then we present three applications of groupoidification. The first\nis to Feynman diagrams. The Hilbert space for the quantum harmonic oscillator\narises naturally from degroupoidifying the groupoid of finite sets and\nbijections. This allows for a purely combinatorial interpretation of creation\nand annihilation operators, their commutation relations, field operators, their\nnormal-ordered powers, and finally Feynman diagrams. The second application is\nto Hecke algebras. We explain how to groupoidify the Hecke algebra associated\nto a Dynkin diagram whenever the deformation parameter q is a prime power. We\nillustrate this with the simplest nontrivial example, coming from the A2 Dynkin\ndiagram. In this example we show that the solution of the Yang-Baxter equation\nbuilt into the A2 Hecke algebra arises naturally from the axioms of projective\ngeometry applied to the projective plane over the finite field with q elements.\nThe third application is to Hall algebras. We explain how the standard\nconstruction of the Hall algebra from the category of representations of a\nsimply-laced quiver can be seen as an example of degroupoidification.

However, the theorem\nis not applicable to the system under finite current since it is not in\nequilibrium. To examine the effect of finite current on the thermal\nfluctuation, we adopt the influence functional formalism developed by Feynman\nand Vernon, which is known to be a useful tool to analyze effects of\ndissipation and thermal fluctuation. For this purpose, we construct a quantum\nmechanical effective Hamiltonian describing current-induced domain wall motion\nby generalizing the Caldeira-Leggett description of quantum dissipation. We\nfind that even for the current-induced domain wall motion, the statistical\nproperties of the thermal noise is still described by the\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem if the current density is sufficiently lower\nthan the intrinsic critical current density and thus the domain wall tilting\nangle is sufficiently lower than pi/4. The relation between our result and a\nrecent result, which also addresses the thermal fluctuation, is discussed. We\nalso find interesting physical meanings of the Gilbert damping alpha and the\nnonadiabaticy parameter beta; while alpha characterizes the coupling strength\nbetween the magnetization dynamics (the domain wall motion in this paper) and\nthe thermal reservoir (or environment), beta characterizes the coupling\nstrength between the spin current and the thermal reservoir.\n","Comment: 16 page, no figure"]}]

To explain\nthese observations, recent models put forward that, as edge states come close\nto each other, electrons can hop between counterpropagating edge channels, or\ntunnel through Coulomb islands. Here, we use scanning gate microscopy to\ndemonstrate the presence of quantum Hall Coulomb islands, and reveal the\nspatial structure of transport inside a quantum Hall interferometer. Electron\nislands locations are found by modulating the tunneling between edge states and\nconfined electron orbits. Tuning the magnetic field, we unveil a continuous\nevolution of active electron islands. This allows to decrypt the complexity of\nhigh magnetic field magnetoresistance oscillations, and opens the way to\nfurther local scale manipulations of quantum Hall localized states.\n"]}]

The advantage of providing a\n(fixpoint) abstraction to the code consumer is that its validity is checked in\na single pass (i.e., one iteration) of an abstract interpretation-based\nchecker. A main challenge to make ACC useful in practice is to reduce the size\nof certificates as much as possible while at the same time not increasing\nchecking time. The intuitive idea is to only include in the certificate\ninformation that the checker is unable to reproduce without iterating. We\nintroduce the notion of reduced certificate which characterizes the subset of\nthe abstraction which a checker needs in order to validate (and re-construct)\nthe full certificate in a single pass. Based on this notion, we instrument a\ngeneric analysis algorithm with the necessary extensions in order to identify\nthe information relevant to the checker. Interestingly, the fact that the\nreduced certificate omits (parts of) the abstraction has implications in the\ndesign of the checker. We provide the sufficient conditions which allow us to\nensure that 1) if the checker succeeds in validating the certificate, then the\ncertificate is valid for the program (correctness) and 2) the checker will\nsucceed for any reduced certificate which is valid (completeness).
