During the process\nof merging, the orbital angular momentum is redistributed into the internal\nangular momentum of the final system; the internal angular momentum of the\nprimary galaxy can increase or decrease depending on the relative orientation\nof the orbital spin vectors (direct or retrograde), while the initially\nnon-rotating dark matter halo always gains angular momentum. The specific\nangular momentum of the stellar component always decreases independent of the\norbital parameters or morphology of the satellite, the decrease in the rotation\nvelocity of the primary galaxy is accompanied by a change in the anisotropy of\nthe orbits, and the ratio of rotation speed to velocity dispersion of the\nmerger remnant is lower than the initial value, not only due to an increase in\nthe dispersion but also to the slowing -down of the disk rotation. We briefly\ndiscuss several astrophysical implications of these results, suggesting that\nminor mergers do not cause a \"random walk\" process of the angular momentum of\nthe stellar disk component of galaxies, but rather a steady decrease.
