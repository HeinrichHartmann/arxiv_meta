We call a\nset nested subpfaffian over R if it is the projection of a boolean combination\nof definable sets and nested Rolle leaves over R. Assuming that R admits\nanalytic cell decomposition, we prove that the complement of a nested\nsubpfaffian set over R is again a nested subpfaffian set over R. As a\ncorollary, we obtain that if R admits analytic cell decomposition, then the\npfaffian closure P(R) of R is obtained by adding to R all nested Rolle leaves\nover R, a one-stage process, and that P(R) is model complete in the language\nL(R).\n","Comment: final version before publication"]}]
