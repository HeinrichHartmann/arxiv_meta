The existing methods to eliminate ambiguities either\ninvolve calculations with varying geometries which are inherently flawed, as\nmetamaterial properties depend strongly on geometry, or are more subjective as\none must inspect and select branches to yield effec- tive parameters as a\ncontinuous function of frequency. We propose that the Kramers-Kronig relations,\nwhich hold for negative-index materials, naturally guide the selection of the\nproper branches, and in fact predict negative refractive index where other\nextraction procedures alone might not. The experimental realization of high\nquality negative-index materials requires a robust and reliable index retrieval\nprocedure; the combined extraction/Kramers-Kronig retrieval can be used to\ndesign optimal metama- terials in a simple, systemmatic, and general manner.\n"]}]

In Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thermus, and cyanobacteria, the\nfilaments can wrap into complex supercoiled structures as the cells grow. The\nstructures may be solenoids or plectonemes, with or without branches in the\nlatter case. Any microscopic theory of these morphological instabilities must\naddress the nature of pattern selection in the presence of growth, for growth\nrenders the problem nonautonomous and the bifurcations dynamic. To gain insight\ninto these phenomena, we formulate a general theory for growing elastic\nfilaments with bending and twisting resistance in a viscous medium, and study\nan illustrative model problem: a growing filament with preferred twist, closed\ninto a loop. Growth depletes the twist, inducing a twist strain. The closure of\nthe loop prevents the filament from unwinding back to the preferred twist;\ninstead, twist relaxation is accomplished by the formation of supercoils.\nGrowth also produces viscous stresses on the filament which even in the absence\nof twist produce buckling instabilities. Our linear stability analysis and\nnumerical studies reveal two dynamic regimes. For small intrinsic twist the\ninstability is akin to Euler buckling, leading to solenoidal structures, while\nfor large twist it is like the classic writhing of a twisted filament,\nproducing plectonemic windings. This model may apply to situations in which\nsupercoils form only, or more readily, when axial rotation of filaments is\nblocked. Applications to specific biological systems are proposed.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 11 figures"]}]

The filaments\nundergo polymorphic transformations in which the helical pitch and radius\nchange abruptly. These transformations arise in response to mechanical loading,\nchanges in solution temperature and ionic strength, and point substitutions in\nthe amino acid sequence of the protein subunits that make up the filament. To\nexplain polymorphism, we propose a new coarse-grained continuum rod theory\nbased on the quaternary structure of the filament. The model has two molecular\nswitches. The first is a double-well potential for the extension of a\nprotofilament, which is one of the eleven almost longitudinal columns of\nsubunits. Curved filament shapes occur in the model when there is a mismatch\nstrain, i.e. when inter-subunit bonds in the inner core of the filament prefer\na subunit spacing which is intermediate between the two spacings favored by the\ndouble-well potential. The second switch is a double-well potential for twist,\ndue to lateral interactions between neighboring protofilaments. Cooperative\ninteractions between neighboring subunits within a protofilament are necessary\nto ensure the uniqueness of helical ground states. We calculate a phase diagram\nfor filament shapes and the response of a filament to external moment and\nforce.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 21 figures"]}]
