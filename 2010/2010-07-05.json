In particular\nthere has been considerable interest in their use in tackling problems arising\nin the areas of scheduling and timetabling. However, the classical genetic\nalgorithm paradigm is not well equipped to handle constraints and successful\nimplementations usually require some sort of modification to enable the search\nto exploit problem specific knowledge in order to overcome this shortcoming.\nThis paper is concerned with the development of a family of genetic algorithms\nfor the solution of a nurse rostering problem at a major UK hospital. The\nhospital is made up of wards of up to 30 nurses. Each ward has its own group of\nnurses whose shifts have to be scheduled on a weekly basis. In addition to\nfulfilling the minimum demand for staff over three daily shifts, nurses' wishes\nand qualifications have to be taken into account. The schedules must also be\nseen to be fair, in that unpopular shifts have to be spread evenly amongst all\nnurses, and other restrictions, such as team nursing and special conditions for\nsenior staff, have to be satisfied. The basis of the family of genetic\nalgorithms is a classical genetic algorithm consisting of n-point crossover,\nsingle-bit mutation and a rank-based selection. The solution space consists of\nall schedules in which each nurse works the required number of shifts, but the\nremaining constraints, both hard and soft, are relaxed and penalised in the\nfitness function. The talk will start with a detailed description of the\nproblem and the initial implementation and will go on to highlight the\nshortcomings of such an approach, in terms of the key element of balancing\nfeasibility, i.e. covering the demand and work regulations, and quality, as\nmeasured by the nurses' preferences. A series of experiments involving\nparameter adaptation, niching, intelligent weights, delta coding, local hill\nclimbing, migration and special selection rules will then be outlined and it\nwill be shown how a series of these enhancements were able to eradicate these\ndifficulties. Results based on several months' real data will be used to\nmeasure the impact of each modification, and to show that the final algorithm\nis able to compete with a tabu search approach currently employed at the\nhospital.

Agencies and researchers who collect such\nsocial network data often have a compelling interest in allowing others to\nanalyze the data. In many cases the data describes relationships that are\nprivate and sharing the data in full can result in unacceptable disclosures.\nThus, preserving privacy without revealing sensitive information in the social\nnetwork is a serious concern. Recent developments for preserving privacy using\nanonymization techniques are focused on relational data only. Preserving\nprivacy in social networks against neighborhood attacks is an initiation which\nuses the definition of privacy called k-anonymity. k-anonymous social network\nstill may leak privacy under the cases of homogeneity and background knowledge\nattacks. To overcome, we find a place to use a new practical and efficient\ndefinition of privacy called ldiversity.

The derandomized\nversions produce again significantly better rounding errors, with running times\nstill negligible compared to the one for solving the corresponding LP. It thus\nseems worth preferring them over the randomized variants.\n  The data created in these experiments lets us propose and investigate the\nfollowing new ideas. For the low-congestion routing problems, we suggest to\nsolve a second LP, which yields the same congestion, but aims at producing a\nsolution that is easier to round. Experiments show that this reduces the\nrounding errors considerably, both in combination with randomized and\nderandomized rounding.\n  For the max-coverage instances, we generally observe that the greedy\nheuristics also performs very good. We develop a strengthened method of\nderandomized rounding, and a simple greedy/rounding hybrid approach using\ngreedy and LP-based rounding elements, and observe that both these improvements\nyield again better solutions than both earlier approaches on their own.\n  For unit disk max-domination, we also develop a PTAS. Contrary to all other\nalgorithms investigated, it performs not much better in experiments than in\ntheory; thus, unless extremely good solutions are to be obtained with huge\ncomputational resources, greedy, LP-based rounding or hybrid approaches are\npreferable.\n","Comment: Longer version of SEA 2010 paper"]}]

MMBCR\nis the most fair in terms of node usage and hence it incurs the largest time\nfor first node failure. FORP tends to repeatedly use nodes lying on the stable\npath and hence is the most unfair of the three routing protocols and it incurs\nthe smallest value for the time of first node failure.
