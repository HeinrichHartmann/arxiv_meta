We assess the effect in a Bayesian framework and compare it\nwith an alternative likelihood-based measure of a profile likelihood. We employ\na new scanning algorithm (MultiNest) which increases the computational\nefficiency by a factor ~200 with respect to previously used techniques. We\ndemonstrate that the currently available data are not yet sufficiently\nconstraining to allow one to determine the preferred values of CMSSM parameters\nin a way that is completely independent of the choice of priors and statistical\nmeasures. While b->s gamma generally favors large m_0, this is in some contrast\nwith the preference for low values of m_0 and m_1/2 that is almost entirely a\nconsequence of a combination of prior effects and a single constraint coming\nfrom the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, which remains somewhat\ncontroversial. Using an information-theoretical measure, we find that the\ncosmological dark matter abundance determination provides at least 80% of the\ntotal constraining power of all available observables. Despite the remaining\nuncertainties, prospects for direct detection in the CMSSM remain excellent,\nwith the spin-independent neutralino-proton cross section almost guaranteed\nabove sigma_SI ~ 10^{-10} pb, independently of the choice of priors or\nstatistics. Likewise, gluino and lightest Higgs discovery at the LHC remain\nhighly encouraging.

To fully utilize its potential, one\nhas to be able to control systematic effects down to below the level of the\nstatistical parameter errors. Particularly worrisome in this respect is\nintrinsic alignment, causing considerable parameter biases via correlations\nbetween the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and the gravitational shear,\nwhich mimic lensing. In an earlier work we have proposed a nulling technique\nthat downweights this systematic, only making use of its well-known redshift\ndependence. We assess the practicability of nulling, given realistic conditions\non photometric redshift information. For several simplified intrinsic alignment\nmodels and a wide range of photometric redshift characteristics we calculate an\naverage bias before and after nulling. Modifications of the technique are\nintroduced to optimize the bias removal and minimize the information loss by\nnulling. We demonstrate that one of the presented versions is close to optimal\nin terms of bias removal, given high quality of photometric redshifts. For\nexcellent photometric redshift information, i.e. at least 10 bins with a small\ndispersion, a negligible fraction of catastrophic outliers, and precise\nknowledge about the redshift distributions, one version of nulling is capable\nof reducing the shear-intrinsic ellipticity contamination by at least a factor\nof 100. Alternatively, we describe a robust nulling variant which suppresses\nthe systematic signal by about 10 for a very broad range of photometric\nredshift configurations.

If only small portions of the sky are\nconsidered, it is often desirable to perform the analysis in the flat-sky\nlimit. We aim at a formal, detailed derivation of the bispectrum covariance in\nthe flat-sky approximation, focusing on a pure two-dimensional Fourier-plane\napproach. We define an unbiased estimator of the bispectrum, which takes the\naverage over the overlap of annuli in Fourier space, and compute its full\ncovariance. The outcome of our formalism is compared to the flat-sky spherical\nharmonic approximation in terms of the covariance, the behavior under parity\ntransformations, and the information content. We introduce a geometrical\ninterpretation of the averaging process in the estimator, thus providing an\nintuitive understanding. Contrary to foregoing work, we find a difference by a\nfactor of two between the covariances of the Fourier-plane and the spherical\nharmonic approach. We argue that this discrepancy can be explained by the\ndiffering behavior with respect to parity. However, in an exemplary analysis it\nis demonstrated that the Fisher information of both formalisms agrees to high\naccuracy.

In this work\nwe analyze theoretically two aspects of ac driven transport in cold atoms\nratchets. We first address the issue of whether, and to which extent, an ac\ndriven ratchet for cold atoms can operate as a motor. We thus study\ntheoretically a dissipative motor for cold atoms, as obtained by adding a load\nto a 1D non-adiabatically driven rocking ratchet. We demonstrate that a current\ncan be generated also in the presence of a load, e.g. the ratchet device can\noperate as a motor. Correspondingly, we determine the stall force for the\nmotor, which characterizes the range of loads over which the device can operate\nas a motor, and the differential mobility, which characterizes the response to\na change in the magnitude of the load. Second, we compare our results for the\ntransport in an ac driven ratchet device with the transport in a dc driven\nsystem. We observe a peculiar phenomenon: the bi-harmonic ac force stabilizes\nthe dynamics, allowing the generation of uniform directed motion over a range\nof momentum much larger than what is possible with a dc bias. We explain such a\nstabilization of the dynamics by observing that a non-adiabatic ac drive\nbroadens the effective cooling momentum range, and forces the atom trajectories\nto cover such a region. Thus the system can dissipate energy and maintain a\nsteady-state energy balance. Our results show that in the case of a\nfinite-range velocity-dependent friction, a ratchet device may offer the\npossibility of controlling the particle motion over a broader range of momentum\nwith respect to a purely biased system, although this is at the cost of a\nreduced coherency.\n"]}]

The framework\nconsists of two models: the first one is a simple transmission model for uplink\nand downlink, which is capable to give a lower bound on the capacity for the\ncase that the transmission is subject to imperfect CSI. A detailed model for\nconcrete channel estimation and feedback schemes provides parameter input to\nthe former model and covers the most important aspects such as pilot design\noptimization, linear channel estimation, feedback delay, and feedback\nquantization. We apply this framework to determine optimal pilot densities and\nCSI feedback quantity, given that a weighted sum of uplink and downlink\nthroughput is to be maximized for a certain user velocity. We show that for low\nspeed, and if downlink throughput is of particular importance, a significant\nportion of the uplink should be invested into CSI feedback. At higher velocity,\nhowever, downlink performance becomes mainly affected by CSI feedback delay,\nand hence CSI feedback brings little gain considering the inherent sacrifice of\nuplink capacity. We further show that for high velocities, it becomes\nbeneficial to use no CSI feedback at all, but apply random beamforming in the\ndownlink and operate in time-division duplex.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication at 2010 Workshop on Smart Antennas (WSA),\n  23-24 Feb 2010, Bremen (Germany); submitted on 15 Nov 2009"]}]

However, these images are also magnified, by an\namount that depends on the angular lens-source separation. The relative\nlens-source motion results in a time-variable source magnification: a\nmicrolensing event. If the foreground star happens to host a planet with\nprojected separation near the paths of these images, the planet will further\nperturb the images, resulting in a characteristic, short-lived signature of the\nplanet. This chapter provides an introduction to the discovery and\ncharacterization of exoplanets with gravitational microlensing. The theoretical\nfoundation of the method is reviewed, focusing on the phenomenology of\nplanetary perturbations. The strengths and weaknesses of the microlensing\ntechnique are discussed, highlighting the fact that it is sensitive to low-mass\nplanets with separations just beyond the snow line, orbiting stars located\nthroughout the Galactic disk and foreground bulge. An overview of the practice\nof microlensing planet searches is given, with a discussion of some of the\nchallenges with detecting and analyzing planetary perturbations. The chapter\nconcludes with a review of the results that have been obtained to date, and a\ndiscussion of the near and long-term prospects for microlensing planet surveys.\nUltimately, microlensing is potentially sensitive to multiple-planet systems\ncontaining analogs of all the solar system planets except Mercury, as well as\nto free floating planets, and will provide a crucial test of planet formation\ntheories by determining the demographics of planets throughout the Galaxy.\n","Comment: 35 pages.

Toward the goal, we first formulate a method for\nobtaining a bird-eye view of the phenomenon of neutrino oscillation by\nintroducing a new powerful tool called the ``CP trajectory diagram in\nbi-probability space''. It allows us to represent pictorially the three effects\nseparately in a single diagram; effect from genuine CP violation due to the sin\ndelta term, effect from the CP conserving cos delta term, and the fake CP\nviolating effect due to earth matter. By using the CP trajectory diagram we\nobserve that there is a two-fold ambiguity in the determination of delta which\nis related with the sign of Delta m^2_{13}. We then address the question of\nwhat are the promising options for conceptual design of experiments at low\nenergies which looks for CP violation and at the same time would resolve the\ntwo-fold ambiguity. We point out that a version with distance of about 700 km,\nwith a megaton class water Cherenkov detector gives an optimal design which\nallows simultaneous determination of delta and the sign of Delta m^2_{13} {\\it\nin situ}.

In this paper we study possible solutions to\nthis problem by considering five-dimensional theories where the Higgs field\npotential vanishes at tree level due to a global symmetry. We consider two\navenues: a Little Higgs model and a Twin Higgs model. An obstacle for the\nembedding of these four-dimensional models in five dimensions is that their\nlogarithmic sensitivity to the cutoff will result in linear divergences in the\nhigher dimensional theory. We show that, despite the increased cutoff\nsensitivity of higher dimensional theories, it is possible to control the Higgs\nmass in these two scenarios. For the Little Higgs model studied, the\nphenomenology will be significantly different from the case of the standard\nmodel in UED. This is due to the fact that the compactification scale\napproximately coincides with the scale where the masses of the new states\nappear. For the case of the Twin Higgs model, the compactification scale may be\nconsiderably lower than the scale where the new states appear. If it is as low\nas allowed by current limits, it would be possible to experimentally observe\nthe standard model Kaluza-Klein states as well as a new heavy quark.

This coupling implies that a\nD0-brane may possess multipole moments with respect to the various type IIA\nsupergravity fields. Different such polarization states of the D0-brane will\nthus generate different long-range supergravity fields, and the corresponding\nsemi-classical supergravity solutions will have different geometries. In this\npaper, we reconsider such solutions from an eleven-dimensional perspective. We\nthus begin by deriving the ``superpartners'' of the eleven-dimensional\ngraviton. These superpartners are obtained by acting on the purely bosonic\nsolution with broken supersymmetries and, in theory, one can obtain the full\nBPS supermultiplet of states. When we dimensionally reduce a polarized\nsupergraviton along its direction of motion, we recover a metric which\ndescribes a polarized D0-brane. On the other hand, if we compactify along the\nretarded null direction we obtain the short distance, or ``near-horizon'',\ngeometry of a polarized D0-brane, which is related to finite $N$ Matrix theory.\nThe various dipole moments in this case can only be defined once the\neleven-dimensional metric is ``regularized'' and, even then, they are formally\ninfinite. We argue, however, that this is to be expected in such a\nnon-asymptotically flat spacetime.

Although most of our discussion refers to arbitrary p-branes, when\nwe need to be specific we assume that they are D-branes of Type II or Type I\nstring theory. For realistic brane couplings, such as those arising in string\ntheory, the inter-brane potentials are too steep to inflate the universe for\nacceptably long times. However, for special regions of the parameter space of\nbrane-antibrane positions the brane motion is slow enough for there to be\nsufficient inflation.

However, in the orientifold large $N_c$ limit,\nthe interaction amplitudes and matrix elements scale with $N_c^{-1}$ in the\nsame way as soliton models scale with the generic meson coupling constant $g$\nrather than as $N_c^{-1/2}$ as in the traditional large $N_c$ limit.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 26 figures"]}]

These spin chains define variants of the Hubbard model and describe\nelectron models with pair hoppings. A cubic algebra that admits the\nBirman-Wenzl-Murakami algebra as a quotient allows exact solvability of the\nperiodic chain. The two Hamiltonians, respectively built using the\ndistinguished and the fermionic bases of U_q(sl(2|1)) differ only in the\nboundary terms. They are actually equivalent, but the equivalence is non local.\nReflection equations are solved to get exact solvability on open chains with\nnon trivial boundary conditions. Two families of diagonal solutions are found.\nThe centre and the Scasimirs of the quantum enveloping algebra of sl(2|1)\nappear as tools for the construction of exactly solvable Hamiltonians.\n","Comment: 22 pages, LaTeX2e, uses amsfonts; some references added and typos\n  corrected"]}]
