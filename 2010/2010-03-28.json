A large number of clustering approaches\nhave been proposed for the analysis of gene expression data. However,\nextracting important biological knowledge is still harder. To address this\ntask, clustering techniques are used. In this paper, hybrid Hierarchical\nk-Means algorithm is used for clustering and biclustering gene expression data\nis used. To discover both local and global clustering structure biclustering\nand clustering algorithms are utilized. A validation technique, Figure of Merit\nis used to determine the quality of clustering results. Appropriate knowledge\nis mined from the clusters by embedding a BLAST similarity search program into\nthe clustering and biclustering process.
