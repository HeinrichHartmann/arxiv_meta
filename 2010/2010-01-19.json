Based on the ratio of aromatic to star-formation IR (SFIR)\nluminosities for normal star-forming galaxies at z~1, we have constructed the\nSFIR luminosity function (LF) of z~1 quasars. As we found earlier for\nlow-redshift PG quasars, these z~1 quasars show a flatter SFIR LF than do z~1\nfield galaxies, implying the quasar host galaxy population has on average a\nhigher SFR than the field galaxies do. As measured from their SFIR LF,\nindividual quasar hosts have on average LIRG-level SFRs, which mainly arise in\nthe circumnuclear regions. By comparing with similar measurements of\nlow-redshift PG quasars, we find that the comoving SFIR luminosity density in\nquasar hosts shows a much larger increase with redshift than that in field\ngalaxies. The behavior is consistent with pure density evolution since the\naverage SFR and the average SFR/BH-accretion-rate in quasar hosts show little\nevolution with redshift. For individual quasars, we have found a correlation\nbetween the aromatic-based SFR and the luminosity of the nuclear radiation,\nconsistent with predictions of some theoretical models.
