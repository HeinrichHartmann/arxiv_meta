In this technique,\nthe constellation points are extended such that the PAPR is minimized but the\nminimum distance of the constellation points does not decrease. In this paper,\nan iterative ACE method is extended to spatially encoded OFDM systems. The\nproposed methods are such that the PAPR is reduced simultaneously at all\nantennas, while the spatial encoding relationships still hold. It will be shown\nthat the original ACE method can be employed before Space Time Block Coding\n(STBC). But in case of Space Frequency Block Coding (SFBC), two modified\ntechniques have been proposed. In the first method, the OFDM frame is separated\nby several subframes and the ACE method is applied to these subframes\nindependently to reduce their corresponding PAPRs. Then the low PAPR subframes\nare recombined based on SFBC relationships to yield the transmitted signals\nfrom different antennas. In the second method, for each iteration, the ACE is\napplied to the antenna with the maximum PAPR, and the signals of the other\nantennas are generated from that of this antenna. Simulation results show that\nboth algorithms converge, but the second method outperforms the first one when\nthe number of antennas is increased.\n"]}]

The evidence in these research fields is here\nanalyzed and found to agree well with the properties of Rydberg Matter (RM).\nThis material has been studied with numerous methods in the laboratory. Alkali\natoms, mainly Na, reach the mesosphere in the form of interplanetary\n(meteoritic, cometary) dust. The planar RM clusters NaN usually contain N = 19,\n37 or 61 atoms, and have the density of air at 90 km altitude where they float.\nThe diameters of the clusters are 10-100 nm from laboratory high precision\nradio frequency spectroscopic studies. Such experiments show that RM clusters\ninteract strongly with radar frequencies: this explains the radio frequency\nheating and reflection studies of PMSE layers. The clusters give the low\ntemperature in the mesosphere by efficient selective radiation at long\nwavelengths, which is observed in RF emission experiments. The lowest possible\nstable temperature of the mesopause is calculated for the first time to be 121\nK in agreement with measurements, based on the strong optical activity at long\nwavelengths in RM. Sporadic sodium layers are explained in a unique way as due\nto shockwaves in the RM layers. Due to the high electronic excitation energy in\nRM clusters, they induce efficient reactions forming ions of all atoms and\nmolecules in the atmosphere thus providing condensation nuclei for water\nvapour.

New experimental results are presented which\nreveal that dendritic spacing versus solidification rate evolves in an almost\nstep-wise fashion, consistent with previous theoretical predictions of Langer\nand co-workers. Phase field simulations of directional solidification with\ndynamical growth conditions approximating those in the experiments confirm this\nbehavior. Changes in dendrite arm spacing is shown to be consistent with\ndendrite instabilities confined, initially, to sub-domains, rather than the\nentire system. This is due to the rapid variation in growth conditions, which\nprevent the system from adapting as a whole but, rather, in a succession of\nquasi-isolated domains.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 17 figures, submitted to Acta Materialia"]}]
