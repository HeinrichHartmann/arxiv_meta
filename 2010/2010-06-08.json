Accurate\nestimates of merging timescales are required for predictions of astrophysical\nquantities such as black hole binary merger rates, the build-up of stellar mass\nin central galaxies, and the statistical properties of satellite galaxies\nwithin dark matter halos. In this paper, we study the merging timescales of\nextended dark matter halos using N-body simulations.

Indirect reciprocity is one such\nmechanism, where other-regarding actions of a player are eventually rewarded by\nother players with whom the original player has not interacted. The upstream\nreciprocity (also called generalized indirect reciprocity) is a type of\nindirect reciprocity and represents the concept that those helped by somebody\nwill help other unspecified players. In spite of the evidence for the\nenhancement of helping behavior by upstream reciprocity in rats and humans,\ntheoretical support for this mechanism is not strong. In the present study, we\nnumerically investigate upstream reciprocity in heterogeneous contact networks,\nin which the players generally have different number of neighbors. We show that\nheterogeneous networks considerably enhance cooperation in a game of upstream\nreciprocity. In heterogeneous networks, the most generous strategy, by which a\nplayer helps a neighbor on being helped and in addition initiates helping\nbehavior, first occupies hubs in a network and then disseminates to other\nplayers.

We focus on the Unitary Correlation Operator Method (UCOM),\nwhich offers a very intuitive, universal and robust approach for the treatment\nof short-range correlations. We discuss the UCOM formalism in detail and\nhighlight the connections to other methods for the description of short-range\ncorrelations and the construction of effective interactions. In particular, we\njuxtapose UCOM with the Similarity Renormalization Group (SRG) approach, which\nimplements the unitary transformation of the Hamiltonian through a very\nflexible flow-equation formulation. The UCOM- and SRG-transformed interactions\nare compared on the level of matrix elements and in many-body calculations\nwithin the no-core shell model and with Hartree-Fock plus perturbation theory\nfor a variety of nuclei and observables. These calculations provide a detailed\npicture of the similarities and differences as well as the advantages and\nlimitations of unitary transformation methods.\n","Comment: 72 pages, 31 figures"]}]

That is why both phenomena should be\ntaken into account at once, as the gravitational collapse is considered. Since,\nunder the above transition, the hadronic-phase (HPh) vacuum (filled up with\ngluon- and chiral $q\\bar q$-condensates) turns into the \"empty\" (perturbation)\nsubhadronic-phase (SHPh) one and, thus, the formerly (very high) pressure falls\ndown rather abruptly, the formerly cold nuclear medium starts imploding almost\nfreely into the new vacuum. If the star mass is sufficiently large, then this\nimplosion is shown to result in an enormous heating - up to the temperature\nabout 100 MeV or, may be, even higher - and growth of the inner pressure due to\ndegeneracy breaking and multiple $q\\bar q$-pair production which withstands the\ngravitational compression (remind that the highest temperatures of supernovae\nbursts, as well as of the \"normal\" NS, are, at least, of one order lower). As a\nconsequence, a \"flaming wall\" is, most probably, emerged on the way of further\ncollapsing which prevents the NS to evolve towards the BH horizon appearance.\nAt the same time, it could give rise to the most powerful GRBs produced by some\nvery distant (young) stars.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 2 figures"]}]

Previous work has shown that QWSCs have a\ngreater open circuit voltage (Voc) than would be provided by a cell with the\nquantum well effective bandgap. This suggests that the fundamental efficiency\nlimits of QWSCs are greater than those of single bandgap solar cells. The\nfollowing work investigates QWSCs in the GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs materials system. The\ndesign and optimisation of a QWSC in this system requires studies of the\nvoltage and current dependencies on the aluminium fraction. QWSCs with\ndifferent aluminium fractions have been studied and show an increasing Voc with\nincreasing barrier aluminium composition. The QE however decreases with\nincreasing aluminium composition. We develop a model of the QE to test novel\nQWSC designs with a view to minimising this problem. This work concentrates on\ntwo design changes. The first deals with com- positionally graded structures in\nwhich the bandgap varies with position. This bandgap variation introduces an\nquasi electric field which can be used to increase minority carrier collection\nin the low efficiency p and n layers. This technique also increases the light\nflux reaching the highly efficient depletion regions. The second design change\nconsists of coating the back of the cell with a mirror to exploit the portion\nof light which is not absorbed on the first pass. A model of the QE of\ncompositionally graded QWSC solar cells with back surface mirrors is developed\nin order to analyse the effect of these design changes. These changes are\nimplemented separately in a number of QWSC designs and the resulting\nexperimental data compared with the model. An optimised design is then\npresented.\n","Comment: PhD thesis, Imperial College, solar cell modelling development and\n  experimental validation (235 pages) 1997"]}]

In this method, it is demonstrated that the transition to turbulence\ndepends on the relative magnitudes of the transverse gradient of the total\nmechanical energy which amplifies the disturbance and the energy loss from\nviscous friction which damps the disturbance, for given imposed disturbance.\nFor a given flow geometry and fluid properties, when the maximum of the\nfunction K (a function standing for the ratio of the gradient of total\nmechanical energy in the transverse direction to the rate of energy loss due to\nviscous friction in the streamwise direction) in the flow field is larger than\na certain critical value, it is expected that instability would occur for some\ninitial disturbances. In this paper, using the energy gradient analysis, the\nequation for calculating the energy gradient function K for plane Couette flow\nis derived. The result indicates that K reaches the maximum at the moving\nwalls. Thus, the fluid layer near the moving wall is the most dangerous\nposition to generate initial oscillation at sufficient high Re for given same\nlevel of normalized perturbation in the domain.

The NAFL theory QM, formalizing quantum mechanics, treats\nthe superposed state ($S$) of a single photon taking two or more different\npaths at the same time as a logical contradiction that is formally unprovable\nin QM. Nevertheless, in a nonclassical NAFL model for QM in which the law of\nnoncontradiction fails, $S$ has a meaningful metamathematical interpretation\nthat the classical path information for the photon is not available. It is\nargued that the existence of an interference pattern does not logically amount\nto a proof of the self-interference of a single photon. This fact, when coupled\nwith the temporal nature of NAFL truth, implies the logical validity of the\nretroactive assertion of the path information (and the logical superfluousness\nof the grid) in Afshar's experiment. The Bohr complementarity principle, when\nproperly interpreted with the time dependence of logical truth taken into\naccount, holds in Afshar's experiment. NAFL supports, but not demands, a\nmetalogical reality for the particle nature of the photon even when the\nsemantics of QM requires the state $S$.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 1 figure. Ref. [7] updated.
