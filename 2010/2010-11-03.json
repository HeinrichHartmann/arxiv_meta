This\nestimator is based upon a novel topological quantity which we term\n\\textbf{rumor centrality}. We establish that this is an ML estimator for a\nclass of graphs. We find the following surprising threshold phenomenon: on\ntrees which grow faster than a line, the estimator always has non-trivial\ndetection probability, whereas on trees that grow like a line, the detection\nprobability will go to 0 as the network grows. Simulations performed on\nsynthetic networks such as the popular small-world and scale-free networks, and\non real networks such as an internet AS network and the U.S. electric power\ngrid network, show that the estimator either finds the source exactly or within\na few hops of the true source across different network topologies. We compare\nrumor centrality to another common network centrality notion known as distance\ncentrality.

In cavities having\nmultiple degenerate modes, the quasi-continuum of possible lattice\narrangements, and the continuous symmetry breaking associated with the adoption\nof a particular lattice arrangement, give rise to phenomena such as phonons,\ndefects, and frustration, which have hitherto been unexplored in ultracold\natomic settings involving neutral atoms. The present work develops a\nnonequilibrium field-theoretic approach to explore the self-organization of a\nBEC in a pumped, lossy optical cavity.

For certain parameter regimes the corresponding recurrence relation\ncan be related to a symmetric operator on the Hilbert space l^2(Z). The\noperator has deficiency indices (1,1) and we describe as explicitly as possible\nthe spectral resolutions of the self-adjoint extensions. This gives rise to\none-parameter orthogonality relations for sums of two 2\\phi1-series. In\nparticular, we find that the Ismail-Zhang q-analogue of the exponential\nfunction satisfies certain orthogonality relations analogous to the Fourier\ncosine transform.\n","Comment: 18 pages, to appear in Indagationes Mathematicae"]}]

It became very clear at that meeting that the theoretical\nsituation concerning the He3 and H3 ground states was confused. A lack of\ncomputational power prevented converged brute-force solutions of the Faddeev or\nSchroedinger equations, both for bound and continuum states of the\nthree-nucleon systems. Pushed by experimental programs at Bates and elsewhere\nand facilitated by the rapid growth of computational power, converged solutions\nwere finally achieved about a decade later. Twenty-five years ago the first\nthree-nucleon force based on chiral-symmetry considerations was produced. Since\nthen this symmetry has been our guiding principle in constructing three-nucleon\nforces and, more recently, nucleon-nucleon forces. We are finally nearing an\nunderstanding of the common ingredients used in constructing both types of\nforces. I will discuss these and other issues involving the few-nucleon systems\nand attempt to define the current state-of-the-art.\n","Comment: Invited talk at Bates25 Symposium, MIT, November 3-5, 1999 - 13\n  pages, latex, 8 figures - To appear in AIP Conference Proceedings -\n  epsfig.sty and aipproc.sty required"]}]
