Consequently the compact\nremnant of SN 1987A may be a strange quark star, which has a softer equation of\nstate than that of neutron star matter.

We model explosive outgassing for the smallest gas overpressure at the\nregolith base that releases the regolith plug above it. This disturbance's\ntimescale and affected area are consistent with observed TLPs; we also discuss\nother effects. For slow flow, escape through the regolith is prolonged by low\ndiffusivity. Water, found recently in deep magma samples, is unique among\ncandidate volatiles, capable of freezing between the regolith base and surface,\nespecially near the lunar poles.

We examine what effect the presence\nof an inhomogeneity in the gravitational field of size larger than the present\nHubble radius would have on the temperature distribution of the CMB and start\neliciting its observational signature in the CMB power spectrum. The covariance\nfunction contains, in addition to the diagonal entries of the conventional CMB\ntemperature anisostropy power spectrum, non-diagonal entries.

Furthermore, we find\nthat an inhomogeneity in the gravitational potential of super-Hubble size would\nyield a power asymmetry in the CMB with maximal asymmetry at an angle of 90\ndegrees to the CMB dipole axis. The axis of the CMB power asymmetry was\nrecently estimated by Eriksen et. al. to be located at angles between 83 and 96\ndegrees to the CMB dipole axis, which is consistent with the prediction of our\nmodel.

Generally speaking, there are two aspects to this partnership.\nFirst there is the application of game theory to cryptography. Yet, the purpose\nof this paper is to focus on the second aspect, the converse of the first, the\napplication of cryptography to game theory. Chiefly, there exist a branch of\nnon-cooperative games which have a correlated equilibrium as their solution.\nThese equilibria tend to be superior to the conventional Nash equilibria. The\nprimary condition for a correlated equilibrium is the presence of a mediator\nwithin the game. This is simply a neutral and mutually trusted entity. It is\nthe role of the mediator to make recommendations in terms of strategy profiles\nto all players, who then act (supposedly) on this advice. Each party privately\nprovides the mediator with the necessary information, and the referee responds\nprivately with their optimized strategy set. However, there seem to be a\nmultitude of situations in which no mediator could exist. Thus, games modeling\nthese sorts of cases could not use these entities as tools for analysis. Yet,\nif these equilibria are in the best interest of players, it would be rational\nto construct a machine, or protocol, to calculate them. Of course, this machine\nwould need to satisfy some standard for secure transmission between a player\nand itself. The requirement that no third party could detect either the input\nor strategy profile would need to be satisfied by this scheme.

The Fermi EGRB spectrum is\nin excellent agreement with IT09, indicating that blazars are the dominant\ncomponent of the EGRB, and contributions from any other sources (e.g., dark\nmatter annihilations) are minor. It also indicates that the blazar SED\n(spectral energy distribution) sequence taken into account in IT09 is a valid\ndescription of mean blazar SEDs. The possible contribution of MeV blazars to\nthe EGRB in the MeV band is also discussed. In five total years of\nobservations, we predict that Fermi will detect ~1200 blazars all sky down to\nthe corresponding sensitivity limit. We also address the detectability of the\nhighest-redshift blazars. Updating our model with regard to high-redshift\nevolution based on SDSS quasar data, we show that Fermi may find some blazars\nup to z~6 during the five-year survey.

This\nspeculation appeared justified when Peter Shor described a polynomial time\nquantum algorithm for factoring integers.\n  In quantum systems, the computational space increases exponentially with the\nsize of the system which enables exponential parallelism. This parallelism\ncould lead to exponentially faster quantum algorithms than possible\nclassically. The catch is that accessing the results, which requires\nmeasurement, proves tricky and requires new non-traditional programming\ntechniques.\n  The aim of this paper is to guide computer scientists and other\nnon-physicists through the conceptual and notational barriers that separate\nquantum computing from conventional computing. We introduce basic principles of\nquantum mechanics to explain where the power of quantum computers comes from\nand why it is difficult to harness. We describe quantum cryptography,\nteleportation, and dense coding. Various approaches to harnessing the power of\nquantum parallelism are explained, including Shor's algorithm, Grover's\nalgorithm, and Hogg's algorithms. We conclude with a discussion of quantum\nerror correction.\n","Comment: 45 pages. To appear in ACM Computing Surveys. LATEX file. Exposition\n  improved throughout thanks to reviewers' comments"]}]
