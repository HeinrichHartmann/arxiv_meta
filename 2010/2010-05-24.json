In this paper we model zonal averages of thermal infrared spectra\nfrom the two instruments, Voyager 1 IRIS and Cassini CIRS, to retrieve the\nvertical and meridional profiles of temperature, and the abundances of the two\nminor hydrocarbons, acetylene (C2H2) and ethane (C2H6). The spatial variation\nof these gases is controlled by both chemistry and dynamics, and therefore\ntheir observed distribution gives us an insight into both processes. We find\nthat the two gases paint quite different pictures of seasonal change. Whilst\nthe 2-D cross-section of C2H6 abundance is slightly increased and more\nsymmetric in 2000 (northern summer solstice) compared to 1979 (northern fall\nequinox), the major trend of equator to pole increase remains. For C2H2 on the\nother hand, the Voyager epoch exhibits almost no latitudinal variation, whilst\nthe Cassini era shows a marked decrease polewards in both hemispheres. At the\npresent time, these experimental findings are in advance of interpretation, as\nthere are no published models of 2-D Jovian seasonal chemical variation\navailable for comparison.\n","Comment: 48 pages, 12 figures, 5 tables"]}]
