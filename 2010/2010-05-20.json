The free energy is\nthe effective potential associated to a so-called reaction coordinate (RC).\nComputing free energy differences remains an important challenge in molecular\ndynamics due to the presence of meta-stable regions in the potential energy\nsurface. The ABF method uses an on-the-fly estimate of the free energy to bias\ndynamics and overcome metastability. Using entropy arguments and logarithmic\nSobolev inequalities, previous results have shown that the rate of convergence\nof the ABF method is limited by the metastable features of the canonical\nmeasures conditioned to being at fixed values of the RC.

With hypotheses\nmade on `channel-dependent' conditional measures, we show on a bi-channel model\nthat we introduce, that the convergence of the ABF method is in fact not\nlimited by metastabilities in directions orthogonal to the RC under two crucial\nassumptions: (i) exchange between the two channels is possible for some values\nof the RC and (ii) the free energy is a good bias in each channel.\n"]}]

We use the\nfact that the largest-eigenvalue eigenvector of T can be approximated by a\nstate vector created from the upper or lower half of a finite size cluster.\nDecomposition of the obtained state vector into the MPS gives a way of\nextending the MPS, at the system size increment process in the infinite system\nDMRG algorithm. As a result, we successfully give the physical interpretation\nof the product wave function renormalization group (PWFRG) method, and obtain\nits appropriate initial condition.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 8 figures"]}]
