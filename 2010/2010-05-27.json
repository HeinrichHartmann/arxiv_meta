Aligning the EOB and numerical waveforms at low frequency\nover a time interval of 1000M, we first estimate the phase and amplitude errors\nin the numerical waveforms and then minimize the difference between numerical\nand EOB waveforms by calibrating a handful of EOB-adjustable parameters. In the\nequal-mass, spin aligned case, we find that phase and fractional amplitude\ndifferences between the numerical and EOB (2,2) mode can be reduced to 0.01\nradians and 1%, respectively, over the entire inspiral waveforms. In the\nequal-mass, spin anti-aligned case, these differences can be reduced to 0.13\nradians and 1% during inspiral and plunge, and to 0.4 radians and 10% during\nmerger and ringdown. The waveform agreement is within numerical errors in the\nspin aligned case while slightly over numerical errors in the spin anti-aligned\ncase.

At strong coupling this theory can be\ndescribed by a dual non-Abelian weakly coupled SQCD with the dual gauge group\nU(N_f-N) and N_f light dyon flavors. Both theories support non-Abelian strings.\nWe continue the study of confinement dynamics in these theories, in particular,\nmetamorphoses of excitation spectra, from a different side. A number of results\nobtained previously are explained, enhanced and supplemented by analyzing the\nworld-sheet dynamics on the non-Abelian confining strings. The world-sheet\ntheory is the two-dimensional N=(2,2) supersymmetric weighted CP(N_f-1) model.\nWe explore the vacuum structure and kinks on the world sheet, corresponding to\nconfined monopoles in the bulk theory. We show that (in the equal quark mass\nlimit) these kinks fall into the fundamental representation of the unbroken\nglobal SU(N)\\times SU(N_f-N)\\timesU(1) group. This result confirms the presence\nof \"extra\" stringy meson states in the adjoint representation of the global\ngroup in the bulk theory. The non-Abelian bulk duality is in one-to-one\ncorrespondence with a duality taking place in the N=(2,2) supersymmetric\nweighted CP(N_f-1) model.\n","Comment: 50 pages, 8 figures"]}]

As explained in Efroimsky and Goldreich (2004), this\nopinion originated from a wrong interpretation of a (mathematically correct)\nresult obtained in terms of non-osculating orbital elements. A similar analysis\ncarried out in the language of osculating elements will endow the planetary\nequations with some extra terms caused by the planet's obliquity change. Some\nof these terms will be nontrivial, in that they will not be amendments to the\ndisturbing function. Due to the extra terms, the variations of a planet's\nobliquity may cause a secular drift of its satellite orbit inclination. In this\narticle we set out the analytical formalism for our study of this drift. We\ndemonstrate that, in the case of uniform precession, the drift will be\nextremely slow, because the first-order terms responsible for the drift will be\nshort-period and, thus, will have vanishing orbital averages (as anticipated 40\nyears ago by Peter Goldreich), while the secular terms will be of the second\norder only. However, it turns out that variations of the planetary precession\nmake the first-order terms secular. For example, the planetary nutations will\nresonate with the satellite's orbital frequency and, thereby, may instigate a\nsecular drift. A detailed study of this process will be offered in the\nsubsequent publication, while here we work out the required mathematical\nformalism and point out the key aspects of the dynamics.\n"]}]

A total of 16\nindependent response functions were extracted, of which 12 were observed for\nthe first time. Comparisons with recent model calculations show that response\nfunctions governed by real parts of interference products are determined\nrelatively well near 1.232 GeV, but variations among models is large for\nresponse functions governed by imaginary parts and for both increases rapidly\nwith W. We performed a nearly model-independent multipole analysis that adjusts\ncomplex multipoles with high partial waves constrained by baseline models.\nParabolic fits to the W dependence of the multipole analysis around the Delta\nmass gives values for SMR = (-6.61 +/- 0.18)% and EMR = (-2.87 +/- 0.19)% that\nare distinctly larger than those from Legendre analysis of the same data.\nSimilarly, the multipole analysis gives Re(S0+/M1+) = (+7.1 +/- 0.8)% at\nW=1.232 GeV, consistent with recent models, while the traditional Legendre\nanalysis gives the opposite sign because its truncation errors are quite\nsevere. Finally, using a unitary isobar model (UIM), we find that excitation of\nthe Roper resonance is dominantly longitudinal with S1/2 = (0.05 +/- 0.01)\nGeV^(-1/2) at Q^2=1. The ReS0+ and ReE0+ multipoles favor pseudovector coupling\nover pseudoscalar coupling or a recently proposed mixed-coupling scheme, but\nthe UIM does not reproduce the imaginary parts of 0+ multipoles well.\n","Comment: 60 pages, 54 figures"]}]
