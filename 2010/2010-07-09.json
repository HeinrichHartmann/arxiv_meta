The repeatability is importand\nbecause the same scene viewed from different positions should yield features\nwhich correspond to the same real-world 3D locations [Schmid et al 2000]. The\nefficiency is important because this determines whether the detector combined\nwith further processing can operate at frame rate.\n  Three advances are described in this paper. First, we present a new heuristic\nfor feature detection, and using machine learning we derive a feature detector\nfrom this which can fully process live PAL video using less than 5% of the\navailable processing time. By comparison, most other detectors cannot even\noperate at frame rate (Harris detector 115%, SIFT 195%). Second, we generalize\nthe detector, allowing it to be optimized for repeatability, with little loss\nof efficiency. Third, we carry out a rigorous comparison of corner detectors\nbased on the above repeatability criterion applied to 3D scenes. We show that\ndespite being principally constructed for speed, on these stringent tests, our\nheuristic detector significantly outperforms existing feature detectors.\nFinally, the comparison demonstrates that using machine learning produces\nsignificant improvements in repeatability, yielding a detector that is both\nvery fast and very high quality.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 11 figures"]}]

Transformations of probability measures\ncan then be formalized as a change in free utility due to the addition of new\nconstraints expressed by a target utility function. Accordingly, one obtains a\ncriterion to choose a probability measure that trades off the maximization of a\ntarget utility function and the cost of the deviation from a reference\ndistribution. We show that optimal control, adaptive estimation and adaptive\ncontrol problems can be solved this way in a resource-efficient way. When\nresource costs are ignored, the MEU principle is recovered.

Recently, the interest in this area has\nbeen revived trough the anti-de-Sitter space/Conformal Field Theory\ncorrespondence (AdS/CFT) with the difference that in this case the background\ngeometry is Anti de Sitter in five dimensions. In a recent project that we have\ncompleted in the context of AdS/CFT, we have gained insight in the problem of\nshockwaves and our goal in this work is to apply the technique we have\ndeveloped there in the case of ordinary gravity. In the current project, each\nof the shockwaves correspond to a point-like Stress-Energy tensor that moves\nwith the speed of light while the collision is asymmetric and involves an\nimpact parameter (b). Our method is to expand the metric $(g_{\\mu \\nu})$ in the\nbackground of flat space-time in the presence of the two shockwaves and compute\ncorrections that satisfy causal boundary conditions taking into account\nback-reactions of the Stress-Energy tensor of the two point-like particles. Our\nsolution respects causality as expected but this casual dependence takes place\nin an intuitive way. In particular, $g_{\\mu \\nu}$ at any given point $\\vec{r}$\non the transverse plane at fixed $\\tau$ evolves according from whether the\npropagation from the center of each of the shockwaves or from both shockwaves\nhas enough proper time ($\\tau$) to reach the point under consideration or not.\nSimultaneously around the center of each shockwave, the future metric develops\na $\\delta$-function profile with radius $\\tau$; therefore this profile expands\noutwards from the centers (of the shockwaves) with the speed of light. Finally,\nwe discuss the case of the zero impact parameter collision which results to the\nviolation of conservation and we argue that this might be a signal for the\nformation of a black hole.\n","Comment: 60 pages, 7 figures; Master Thesis: Department of Mathematics in The\n  Ohio State University"]}]
