The absence\nof an edge between any pair of vertices (or variables) is equivalent to full\nconditional independence between these two variables given all the other\nvariables. In the multivariate Gaussian case, the absence of an edge\ncorresponds to a zero coefficient in the precision matrix, which is the inverse\nof the covariance matrix. It is well known that this concentration graph\nrepresents some of the conditional independencies in the distribution of the\nassociated random vector. These conditional independencies correspond to the\n\"separations\" or absence of edges in that graph. In this paper we assume that\nthere are no other independencies present in the probability distribution than\nthose represented by the graph.

For elongational\nexperiments at constant strain rates within a wide range of Weissenberg numbers\n(Wi), three distinct deformation regimes are identified.

This\nmaximum can be explained by simple mathematical arguments as a result of low\ndeformation rates and it should not be confused with the viscosity overshoot\nphenomenon. Corre- sponding to intermediate values of Wi (regime II), a local\nmaximum of the integral extensional viscosity is systematically observed.\nHowever, within this regime, the local viscosity measurements reveal no\nmaximum, but a plateau. Careful inspection of the images of samples within this\nregime shows that, corresponding to the maximum of the integral viscosity, sec-\nondary necks develop along the sample.

OFDM is very effective in combating\nintersymbol interference and can achieve high data rate in frequency selective\nchannel. For OFDM communication systems, the frequency offsets in mobile radio\nchannels distort the orthogonality between subcarriers resulting in Inter\nCarrier Interference (ICI). ICI causes power leakage among subcarriers thus\ndegrading the system performance. A wellknown problem of OFDM is its\nsensitivity to frequency offset between the transmitted and received carrier\nfrequencies. There are two deleterious effects caused by frequency offset one\nis the reduction of signal amplitude in the output of the filters matched to\neach of the carriers and the second is introduction of ICI from the other\ncarriers. This research work investigates three effective methods for combating\nthe effects of ICI: ICI Self Cancellation (SC), Maximum Likelihood (ML)\nestimation, and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) method. These three methods are\ncompared in terms of bit error rate performance and bandwidth efficiency.\nThrough simulations, it is shown that the three techniques are effective in\nmitigating the modulation schemes, the ML and EKF methods perform better than\nthe SC method.\n","Comment: 8 pages IEEE format, International Journal of Computer Science and\n  Information Security, IJCSIS December 2009, ISSN 1947 5500,\n  http://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/"]}]

Phase noise\n(PHN) is a transceiver impairment resulting from the non-idealities of the\nlocal oscillator. We present a case for designing a turbo receiver for systems\ncorrupted by phase noise by taking a closer look at the effects of the common\nphase error (CPE). Using an approximate probabilistic framework called\nvariational inference (VI), we develop a soft-in soft-out (SISO) algorithm that\ngenerates posterior bit-level soft estimates while taking into account the\neffect of phase noise. The algorithm also provides an estimate of the phase\nnoise sequence. Using this SISO algorithm, a turbo receiver is designed by\npassing soft information between the SISO detector and an outer forward error\ncorrecting (FEC) decoder that uses a soft decoding algorithm. It is shown that\nthe turbo receiver achieves close to optimal performance.\n","Comment: 17 pages; 1 figure. Shorter version of this paper was submitted to\n  ISIT 2010"]}]
