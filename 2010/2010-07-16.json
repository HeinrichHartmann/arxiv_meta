One important assumption\nunderlying the Ring Model is that the LGN input to V1 is weakly tuned to the\nretinal orientation and that it is the local computations in V1 that sharpen\nthis tuning. Because the equations that describe the Ring Model have built-in\nequivariance properties in the synaptic weight distribution with respect to a\nparticular group acting on the retinal orientation of the stimulus, the model\nin effect encodes an infinite number of tuning curves that are arbitrarily\ntranslated with respect to each other.

Ligand\nbinding activates integrins by stabilizing an integrin conformation with\nseparated cytoplasmic tails, thus enabling the binding of proteins that mediate\ncytoplasmic signaling. Experiments demonstrate a high sensitivity of integrin\nsignaling to ligand density and this has been accounted mainly to avidity\neffects. Based on experimental data we have developed a quantitative Monte\nCarlo model for integrin signal initiation. We show that within the\nphysiological ligand density range avidity effects cannot explain the\nsensitivity of cellular signaling to small changes in ligand density. Src\nkinases are among the first proteins to be activated, possibly by trans\nauto-phosphorylation. We calculate the extent of integrin and ligand clustering\nas well as the speed and extent of Src kinase activation by trans\nauto-phosphorylation or direct binding at different experimentally monitored\nligand densities. We find that the experimentally observed ligand density\ndependency can be reproduced if Src kinases are activated by trans\nauto-phosphorylation or some other mechanism limits integrin-dependent Src\nkinase activation. We propose that Src kinase and thus cell activation by trans\nauto-phosphorylation may provide a mechanism to enable ligand-density dependent\nresponses at physiological ligand densities.

These results are qualitatively consistent with\nscanning tunneling microscopy measurements of the sub-gap LDOS in cuprate\nsuperconductors. Furthermore, as argued in L. Balents et al., Phys.Rev.B 71,\n144508 (2005), the zero-point vortex motion also leads naturally to the\nobserved periodic modulations in the spatial dependence of the sub-gap LDOS.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 12 figures; a new appendix is added (material taken from\n  cond-mat/0604105)"]}]

We describe the\nrenormalization of the vortex motion by the quasiparticles: at T=0, the\nquasiparticles renormalize the vortex mass and introduce only a weak sub-Ohmic\ndamping. Ohmic (or `Bardeen-Stephen' damping) appears at T>0, with the damping\nco-efficient vanishing ~ T^2 with a universal prefactor. Conversely, quantum\nfluctuations of the vortex renormalize the quasiparticle spectrum. A point\nvortex oscillating in a harmonic pinning potential has no zero-bias peak in the\nelectronic local density of states (LDOS), but has small satellite features at\nan energy determined by the pinning potential. These are proposed as the origin\nof sub-gap LDOS peaks observed in scanning tunneling microscopic studies of the\nLDOS near a vortex.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 2 figures; Proceedings of M2S, Dresden, July 06"]}]
