This\nnon-functorial construction is necessary since the labelled coskeleton functor\nof the category of labelled precubical sets does not fulfil the above\nrequirement. We prove in this paper that it is possible to force the labelled\ncoskeleton functor to be well-behaved by working with labelled transverse\nsymmetric precubical sets. Moreover, we prove that this solution is the only\none. A transverse symmetric precubical set is a precubical set equipped with\nsymmetry maps and with a new kind of degeneracy map called transverse\ndegeneracy. Finally, we also prove that the two settings are equivalent from a\ndirected algebraic topological viewpoint. To illustrate, a new semantics of\nCCS, equivalent to the old one, is given.\n","Comment: 47 pages, LaTeX2e, no figures"]}]

To date two reports directly support\nthis contention, one of which is based on the spectral shape of GRB 050904 at z\n= 6.295. Aims: We reinvestigate the afterglow to understand dust at high z. We\naddress the claimed evidence for unusual (SN-origin) dust in its host galaxy by\nsimultaneously examining the X-ray and optical/NIR spectrophotometric data.\nMethods: We derive the intrinsic SED of the afterglow at 0.47, 1.25 and 3.4\ndays, by re-reducing the Swift X-ray data, the 1.25 days FORS2 z-Gunn\nphotometric data, the spectroscopic and z'-band photometric data at ~3 days\nfrom the Subaru telescope, as well as the critical UKIRT Z-band photometry at\n0.47 days, upon which the claim of dust detection largely relies. Results: We\nfind no evidence of dust extinction in the SED. We compute flux densities at\nlambda_rest = 1250 AA directly from the observed counts at all epochs. In the\nearliest epoch, 0.47 days, the Z-band suppression is found to be smaller (0.3\n+- 0.2 mag) than previously reported and statistically insignificant (<1.5\nsigma). Furthermore we find that the photometry of this band is unstable and\ndifficult to calibrate. Conclusions: From the afterglow SED we demonstrate that\nthere is no evidence for dust extinction -- the SED at all times can be\nreproduced without dust, and at 1.25 days in particular, significant extinction\ncan be excluded, with A(3000 AA) < 0.27 mag at 95% confidence using the SN-type\nextinction curve. We conclude that there is no evidence of any extinction in\nthe afterglow of GRB 050904 and that the presence of SN-origin dust in the host\nof GRB 050904 must be viewed skeptically.

We\nshow the similarities of the mathematical structure of the decoupled and\ncoupled form of the discrete-time quantum walk to that of the Klein-Gordon and\nDirac equations, respectively. In the latter case, the coin emerges as an\nanalog of the spinor degree of freedom. Discrete-time quantum walk as a coupled\nform of the continuous-time quantum walk is also shown by transforming the\ndecoupled form of the discrete-time quantum walk to the Schrodinger form. By\nshowing the coin to be a means to make the walk reversible, and that the\nDirac-like structure is a consequence of the coin use, our work suggests that\nthe relativistic causal structure is a consequence of conservation of\ninformation. However, decoherence (modelled by projective measurements on\nposition space) generates entropy that increases with time, making the walk\nirreversible and thereby producing an arrow of time.

In this work theoretical and numerical methods for\nconstraining the parameter space of a wide class of such models are described.\nFirst, string-theoretic models with large non-Gaussian signatures are\ninvestigated. An upper bound is placed on the amplitude of primordial\ngravitational waves produced by ultra-violet Dirac-Born-Infeld inflation. In\nall but the most finely tuned cases, this bound is incompatible with a lower\nbound derived for inflationary models which exhibit a red spectrum and\ndetectable non-Gaussianity. By analysing general non-canonical actions, a class\nof models is found which can evade the upper bound when the phase speed of\nperturbations is small. The multi-coincident brane scenario with a finite\nnumber of branes is one such model. For models with a potentially observable\ngravitational wave spectrum the number of coincident branes is shown to take\nonly small values. The second method of constraining inflationary models is the\nnumerical calculation of second order perturbations for a general class of\nsingle field models. The Klein-Gordon equation at second order, written in\nterms of scalar field variations only, is numerically solved. The slow roll\nversion of the second order source term is used and the method is shown to be\nextendable to the full equation. This procedure allows the evolution of second\norder perturbations in general and the calculation of the non-Gaussianity\nparameter in cases where there is no analytical solution available.\n","Comment: PhD Thesis, Queen Mary, Univ of London, Supervisor: James E.

The system possesses four critical parameter\nvalues at which qualitative changes take place, R_{sn}, R_h, R_{bh} and\nR_\\infty. The origin is globally stable if R < R_{sn} but for R > R_{sn} has\ntwo further equilibrium points, X_{lb} and X_{ub} . Of these X_{lb} is unstable\nfor all values of R > R_{sn} whereas X_{ub} is stable for R < R_{bh} and\ntherefore possesses its own basin of attraction D. At R = R_h a homoclinic\nbifurcation takes place with the simultaneous formation of a homoclinic loop\nand an edge state.\n  For R_h < R < R_{bh} the edge state, which is the stable manifold of X_{lb},\nforms part of \\partial B, the boundary of the basin of attraction of the\norigin. The other part of \\partial B is a periodic orbit P bounding D. P and D\nshrink with increasing R. At R = R_{bh} there is a 'backwards Hopf' bifurcation\nat which X_{ub} loses its stability and P and D disappear. For R_{bh} < R <\nR_\\infty the edge is 'pure' in the sense that it is the only phase space\nstructure that lies outside the basin of attraction of the origin. As R\nincreases the point X_{lb} recedes to progressively greater distances, with a\nsingularity at R = R_\\infty where it becomes infinite. For R > R_\\infty X_{lb}\nhas reappeared, the edge state has disappeared, and the geometrical structure\nfavors permanent transition from the laminar state, increasingly so for\nincreasing values of R.\n","Comment: Appears also on http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/~lebovitz"]}]

This generalizes a recent\nresult of Wagner who showed that the number of independent sets in a random\nlabeled tree is almost surely a zero residue.\n","Comment: 7 pages.

Frequency- and Phase-Resolved Significance in Fourier Space"],"description":["  Identifying frequencies with low signal-to-noise ratios in time series of\nstellar photometry and spectroscopy, and measuring their amplitude ratios and\npeak widths accurately, are critical goals for asteroseismology. These are also\nchallenges for time series with gaps or whose data are not sampled at a\nconstant rate, even with modern Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) software. Also\nthe False-Alarm Probability introduced by Lomb and Scargle is an approximation\nwhich becomes less reliable in time series with longer data gaps. A rigorous\nstatistical treatment of how to determine the significance of a peak in a DFT,\ncalled SigSpec, is presented here. SigSpec is based on an analytical solution\nof the probability that a DFT peak of a given amplitude does not arise from\nwhite noise in a non-equally spaced data set. The underlying Probability\nDensity Function (PDF) of the amplitude spectrum generated by white noise can\nbe derived explicitly if both frequency and phase are incorporated into the\nsolution. In this paper, I define and evaluate an unbiased statistical\nestimator, the \"spectral significance\", which depends on frequency, amplitude,\nand phase in the DFT, and which takes into account the time-domain sampling. I\nalso compare this estimator to results from other well established techniques\nand demonstrate the effectiveness of SigSpec with a few examples of ground- and\nspace-based photometric data, illustratring how SigSpec deals with the effects\nof noise and time-domain sampling in determining significant frequencies.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 13 figures"]}]
