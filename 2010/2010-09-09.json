An intriguing feature of this class of\nequations is that every generic hyperbolic equation admits at most a\nnine-dimensional contact symmetry algebra. The nine-dimensional bound is sharp:\nnormal forms for the contact-equivalence classes of these maximally symmetric\ngeneric hyperbolic equations are derived and explicit symmetry algebras are\npresented. Moreover, these maximally symmetric equations are Darboux\nintegrable. An enumeration of several submaximally symmetric (eight and\nseven-dimensional) generic hyperbolic structures is also given.\n","Comment: This is a contribution to the Special Issue \"Elie Cartan and\n  Differential Geometry\", published in SIGMA (Symmetry, Integrability and\n  Geometry: Methods and Applications) at http://www.emis.de/journals/SIGMA"]}]

In this paper we analyze the glassy dynamics\nemerging from the formation of a persistent network in a model colloidal gel at\nvery low density. The structural relaxation time of the gel network is compared\nwith the mean squared displacement at short times, corresponding to the\nlocalization length associated to the presence of energetic bonds.\nInterestingly, we find that the same type of scaling as for the dense glassy\nsystems holds. Our findings well elucidate the strong coupling between the\ncooperative rearrangements of the gel network and the single particle\nlocalization in the structure. Our results further indicate that the scaling\ncaptures indeed fundamental physical elements of glassy dynamics.\n","Comment: Submitted to Soft Matter for web theme on ISMC"]}]

Causal set theory is a LI candidate theory of QG that seeks not to\nquantise gravity as such, but rather to develop a new understanding of the\nuniverse from which both GR and QM could arise separately. The key hypothesis\nis that spacetime is a discrete partial order: a set of events where the\npartial ordering is the physical causal ordering between the events.

Massive particles propagating in a discrete spacetime will\nexperience diffusion in both position and momentum in proper time. This thesis\nconsiders this idea in more depth, providing a rigorous derivation of the\ndiffusion equation in terms of observable cosmic time. The diffusion behaviour\ndoes not depend on any particular underlying particle model. Simulations of\nthree different models are conducted, revealing behaviour that matches the\ndiffusion equation despite limitations on the size of causal set simulated. The\neffect of spacetime discreteness on the behaviour of massless particles is also\ninvestigated.

Constraints are placed on the magnitudes of the drift and diffusion\nparameters by considering the blackbody nature of the CMB.
