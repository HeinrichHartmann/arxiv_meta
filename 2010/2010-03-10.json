Magnetic\ninteraction between the Mn atoms is governed by a competition between the\nantiferromagnetic superexchange of the Mn t$_{2g}$ core spins and the\nferromagnetic double exchange of the itinerant e$_g$ electrons. While the core\nelectrons are relatively unaffected by the strain, the orbital character of the\nitinerant electron is strongly affected, which in turn causes a large change in\nthe strength of the ferromagnetic double exchange. The epitaxial strain\nproduces the tetragonal distortion of the MnO$_6$ octahedron, splitting the\nMn-e$_g$ states into x$^2$-y$^2$ and 3z$^2$-1 states, with the former being\nlower in energy, if the strain is tensile in the plane, and opposite if the\nstrain is compressive. For the case of the tensile strain, the resulting higher\noccupancy of the x$^2$-y$^2$ orbital enhances the in-plane ferromagnetic double\nexchange owing to the larger electron hopping in the plane, causing at the same\ntime a reduction of the out-of-plane double exchange. This reduction is large\nenough to be overcome by antiferromagnetic superexchange, which wins to produce\na net antiferromagnetic interaction between the out-of-plane Mn atoms. For the\ncase of the in-plane compressive strain, the reverse happens, viz., that the\nhigher occupancy of the 3z$^2$-1 orbital results in the out-of-plane\nferromagnetic interaction, while the in-plane magnetic interaction remains\nantiferromagnetic.

When no treatment\nis applied the model reproduces the typical dynamics of early tumor growth. The\ninitially avascular tumor reaches a diffusion limited size of the order of\nmillimeters and initiates angiogenesis through the release of vascular\nendothelial growth factor (VEGF) secreted by hypoxic cells in the core of the\ntumor. This stimulates endothelial cells to migrate towards the tumor and\nestablishes a nutrient supply sufficient for sustained invasion. To this model\nwe apply cytostatic treatment in the form of a VEGF-inhibitor, which reduces\nthe proliferation and chemotaxis of endothelial cells. This treatment has the\ncapability to reduce tumor mass, but more importantly, we were able to\ndetermine that inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation is the more\nimportant of the two cellular functions targeted by the drug. Further, we\nconsidered the application of a cytotoxic drug that targets proliferating tumor\ncells. The drug was treated as a diffusible substance entering the tissue from\nthe blood vessels. Our results show that depending on the characteristics of\nthe drug it can either reduce the tumor mass significantly or in fact\naccelerate the growth rate of the tumor.

Shape anisotropy of approximately\n10 % was introduced in nanocubes by making nanodiscs using a linear chain amine\nsurfactant during synthesis process. It has been observed that, ferromagnetism\npersisted above room temperature and a sharp drop in magnetic moment at low\ntemperatures in zero-field cooled magnetization may be associated with the spin\ndisorder due to the effective anisotropy present in the system. Dynamic\nmagnetic properties were studied using RF transverse susceptibility\nmeasurements at different temperatures and the singularities due to anisotropy\nfields were probed at low temperatures. Symmetrically located broad peaks are\nobserved in the frozen state at the effective anisotropy fields and the peak\nstructure is strongly affected by shape anisotropy and temperature.\nIrrespective of size the shape anisotropy gave rise to higher coercive fields\nand larger transverse susceptibility ratio at all temperatures. The role of\nshape anisotropy and the size of the particles on the observed magnetic\nbehaviour were discussed.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 7 figures, Accepted"]}]

It\ndescribes an inseparable connection between quantum systems, and properties\nthereof. In a quantum mechanical description even systems far apart from each\nother can share a common state. This entanglement of the subsystems, although\narising from mathematical principles, is no mere abstract concept, but can be\ntested in experiment, and be utilized in modern quantum information theory\nprocedures, such as quantum teleportation. In particular, entangled states play\na crucial role in testing our understanding of reality, by violating Bell\ninequalities. While the role of entanglement is well studied in the realm of\nnonrelativistic quantum mechanics, its significance in a relativistic quantum\ntheory is a relatively new field of interest. In this work the consequences of\na relativistic description of quantum entanglement are discussed. We analyze\nthe representations of the symmetry groups of special relativity, i.e. of the\nLorentz group, and the Poincar\\'e group, on the Hilbert space of states. We\ndescribe how unitary, irreducible representations of the Poincar\\'e group for\nmassive spin 1/2 particles are constructed from representations of Wigner's\nlittle group. We then proceed to investigate the role of the Wigner rotations\nin the transformation of quantum states under a change of inertial reference\nframe. Considering different partitions of the Hilbert space of 2 particles, we\nfind that the entanglement of the quantum states appears different in different\ninertial frames, depending on the form of the states, the chosen inertial\nframes, and the particular choice of partition. It is explained, how, despite\nof this, the maximally possible violation of Bell inequalities is frame\nindependent, when using appropriate spin observables, which are related to the\nPauli-Ljubanski vector, a Casimir operator of the Poincar\\'e group.\n","Comment: 115 pages, 6 figures, diploma thesis"]}]

In Jackson et. al.\nICPP-2008, an $O(n/p)$ time parallel algorithm has been given for this problem.\nHere $n$ is the size of the input and $p$ is the number of processors. This\nalgorithm enumerates all possible bi-directed edges which can overlap with a\nnode and ends up generating $\\Theta(n\\Sigma)$ messages.\n  In this paper we present a $\\Theta(n/p)$ time parallel algorithm with a\ncommunication complexity equal to that of parallel sorting and is not sensitive\nto $\\Sigma$. The generality of our algorithm makes it very easy to extend it\neven to the out-of-core model and in this case it has an optimal I/O complexity\nof $\\Theta(\\frac{n\\log(n/B)}{B\\log(M/B)})$. We demonstrate the scalability of\nour parallel algorithm on a SGI/Altix computer. A comparison of our algorithm\nwith that of Jackson et. al. ICPP-2008 reveals that our algorithm is faster. We\nalso provide efficient algorithms for the bi-directed chain compaction problem.\n"]}]
