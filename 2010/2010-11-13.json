In classical\napproach the problem of complex equilibrium is solved by minimization of the\nsystem Gibbs' free energy subject to logistic constraints. DTD demands any\nisolated system to comprise smaller subentities, which individual equilibria\nare based on the balance of internal and external thermodynamic forces, acting\nagainst them. The internal forces are equal to the subsystems thermodynamic\naffinities, while external forces originate from subsystems mutual\ninteractions. Those interactions impose additional constraints on the mother\nsystem Gibbs' free energy minimum. Basic expression of discrete thermodynamics,\nbeing multiplied by subsystems deviations from their \"true\" thermodynamic\nequilibria, is naturally identical to d'Alembert's principle. A thermodynamic\nversion of d'Alembert's principle in combination with derived from it\nthermodynamic version of the principle of virtual work, allowed us to express\nthe interactive constraints as a condition, that the sum of all subsystems\nthermodynamic affinities, multiplied by their deviations from their \"true\"\nequilibria, must be equal to zero.

This approach to mobile computing and\ncommunication is only appropriate in situations where a coherent infrastructure\nis available. There are many situations where these requirements are not\nfulfilled such as; developing nations, rural areas, natural disasters, and\nmilitary conflicts to name but a few. A practical solution is to use mobile\ndevices interconnected via a wireless medium to form a network, known as a\nMobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET), and provide the services normally found in wired\nnetworks. Security in MANETs is an issue of paramount importance due to the\nwireless nature of the communication links. Additionally due to the lack of\ncentral administration security issues are different from conventional\nnetworks. For the purposes of this article we have used the \"WMN test-bed\" to\nenable secure routing in MANETs. The use of cryptography is an efficient proven\nway of securing data in communications, but some cryptographic algorithms are\nnot as efficient as others and require more processing power, which is\ndetrimental to MANETs.
