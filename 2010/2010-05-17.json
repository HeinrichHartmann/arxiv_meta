For our study, we used three different samples representing different\ndensity environments: galaxies in Compact Groups (HCGs), Isolated Pairs of\nGalaxies (KPGs), and Isolated Galaxies (KIGs), which were taken as reference.\nUsing both characteristic isophotal parameters and evidence of asymmetries in\nthe optical and the near-infrared, we are able to establish differences in the\ncharacteristics of galaxies with different morphologies in different\nenvironments, allowing us to better understand their different formation\nhistories. In this first paper, we present the isophotal and asymmetry analyses\nof a sample of 214 galaxies in different environments observed in the optical\n(V and I images). For each galaxy, we have determined different characteristic\nisophotal parameters and (V-I) color profiles, as a function of semi-major\naxis, and performed a full asymmetry analysis in residual images using the V\nfilter. Evidence of asymmetry in the optical is almost missing in the KIG\nsample and significantly more common in the KPG than in the HCG samples. Our\nisophotal analysis suggests that the stellar populations in the HCG galaxies\nare older and more dynamically relaxed than in the KPG. The HCG galaxies seem\nto be at a more advanced stage of interaction than the KPGs. One possible\nexplanation is that these structures formed at different epochs: compact groups\nof galaxies would have formed before close pairs of galaxies, which only began\ninteracting recently. However, similarities in the formation process of\ngalaxies with same morphology suggest CGs and close pairs of galaxies share\nsimilar conditions; they are new structures forming relatively late in\nlow-density environments.\n","Comment: 48 pages, 21 figures.

In particular,\ndoes every uniformly recurrent word having bounded Abelian complexity begin in\nan Abelian $k$-power? While this is true for various classes of uniformly\nrecurrent words, including for example the class of all Sturmian words, in this\npaper we show the existence of uniformly recurrent binary words, having bounded\nAbelian complexity, which admit an infinite number of suffixes which do not\nbegin in an Abelian square.
