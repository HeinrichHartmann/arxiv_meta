All of the sources show evidence for interaction with\nthe interstellar medium (ISM), leading to curved frontal structures and\napparent voids in the ISM. An analysis of the spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) of Class I young stellar objects (YSOs) within the north-westerly\ninteraction region of W28, and of the density of stars within the borders of\nthe SNR, suggests that many of them may have been triggered by the SN event.\n2-D radiative transfer modelling permits us to constrain the physical\nparameters of the sources. It is also noted that the location of Class I YSOs\nabout the perimeter of G001.0-00.1, and close to frontal arcs associated with\nSNR G355.9-02.5, suggests that star formation may have been triggered by these\nSNRs as well. Finally, it is found that the MIR colours of the frontal\nstructures appear consistent with shock excitation of the v = 0->0 transitions\nof H2, although it is conceivable that emission by polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbons (PAHs) may also play a role. Where the latter mechanism is\nrelevant, then it is possible that emission derives from the shattering of\nlarger grains in frontal regions, leading to increased volume densities of PAH\ncarrying grains.\n","Comment: The paper contains 14 figures and 0 tables"]}]

The main objective was to study particles impacts on the\ndetectors applicable to future observations in orbit and possible hard and/or\nsoft curing to restore its performances. Cobalt-60 gamma ray irradiations did\nnot show significant degradation, so we mainly focused on single events effects\n(SEE). Protons and alphas irradiations were then performed at the Van de Graaf\ntandem accelerator at the Institut de Physique Nucleaire (IPN, Orsay, France),\nrespectively at 20MeV and 30MeV. Observation showed that the shape of signal\nperturbations clearly depends on the location of the impacts either on the\ndetector itself or the read-out circuit. Software curing has then to be\nanticipated in order to deglitch the signal. This test gives also a unique\nopportunity to measure some parameters of the detector: electrical crosstalk\nand thermo- electrical time constant. However a detailed bolometer model is\nnecessary to understand the contribution of the thermal response in relation\nwith the electrical response. It will be the second step of our study. Finally\nthe complete radiation evaluation proved that this detector can be used in\nspatial experiments.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 6 figures"]}]

We use two different statistical methods to\ndetermine the underlying nature of these flux-flux relationships. First, we use\nstatistical correlation and regression analysis and show that the relationships\nare not monotonic for total solar irradiance and for continuum radiation from\nthe photosphere, but are approximately linear for chromospheric and coronal\nradiation. Second, we use signal theory to examine the flux-flux relationships\nfor a temporal component. We find that a well-defined temporal component exists\nand accounts for some of the variance in the data. This temporal component\narises because active regions with high magnetic field strength evolve,\nbreaking up into small-scale magnetic elements with low field strength, and\nradiative and magnetic fluxes are sensitive to different active-region\ncomponents. We generate empirical models that relate radiative flux to magnetic\nflux, allowing us to predict spectral-irradiance variations from observations\nof disk-averaged magnetic-flux density. In most cases, the model\nreconstructions can account for 85-90% of the variability of the radiative flux\nfrom the chromosphere and corona. Our results are important for understanding\nthe relationship between magnetic and radiative measures of solar and stellar\nvariability.\n"]}]
