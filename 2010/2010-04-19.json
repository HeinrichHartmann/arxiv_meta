As a result, simple microbial life may\nbe common, but complex metazoans (and hence intelligence) will be rare. This\npaper uses Monte Carlo Realisation Techniques to investigate the Rare Earth\nHypothesis, in particular the environmental criteria considered imperative to\nthe existence of intelligence on Earth.\n  By comparing with a less restrictive, more optimistic hypothesis, the data\nindicates that if the Rare Earth hypothesis is correct, intelligent\ncivilisation will indeed be relatively rare. Studying the separations of pairs\nof civilisations shows that most intelligent civilisation pairs (ICPs) are\nunconnected: that is, they will not be able to exchange signals at lightspeed\nin the limited time that both are extant. However, the few ICPs that are\nconnected are strongly connected, being able to participate in numerous\nexchanges of signals. This may provide encouragement for SETI researchers:\nalthough the Rare Earth Hypothesis is in general a contact-pessimistic\nhypothesis, it may be a \"soft\" or \"exclusive\" hypothesis, i.e. it may contain\nfacets that are latently contact-optimistic.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in the International\n  Journal of Astrobiology"]}]

A leader neuron is, basically,\na neuron which fires at the beginning of a burst (respectively network spike)\nmore often that we expect by looking at its whole mean neural activity. This\nmeans that leader neurons have some burst triggering power beyond a simple\nstatistical effect. In this study, we characterize these leader neuron\nproperties. This naturally leads us to simulate neural 2D networks. To build\nour simulations, we choose the leaky integrate and fire (lIF) neuron model. Our\nlIF model has got stable leader neurons in the burst population that we\nsimulate. These leader neurons are excitatory neurons and have a low membrane\npotential firing threshold. Except for these two first properties, the\nconditions required for a neuron to be a leader neuron are difficult to\nidentify and seem to depend on several parameters involved in the simulations\nthemself. However, a detailed linear analysis shows a trend of the properties\nrequired for a neuron to be a leader neuron. Our main finding is: A leader\nneuron sends a signal to many excitatory neurons as well as to a few inhibitory\nneurons and a leader neuron receives only a few signals from other excitatory\nneurons. Our linear analysis exhibits five essential properties for leader\nneurons with relative importance. This means that considering a given neural\nnetwork with a fixed mean number of connections per neuron, our analysis gives\nus a way of predicting which neuron can be a good leader neuron and which\ncannot.

Hence, it is not always clear whether forking is the right\nstrategy. In this paper, we describe a mixed-methods exploratory case study\nthat investigated the process of forking a project. The study concerned the\nforking of an open-source tool for managing software projects, Trac. Trac was\nforked to address differing requirements in an academic setting. The paper\nmakes two contributions to our understanding of code forking. First, our\nexploratory study generated several theories about code forking in open source\nprojects, for further research. Second, we investigated one of these theories\nin depth, via a quantitative study. We conjectured that the features of the OSS\nforking process would allow new requirements to be addressed.
