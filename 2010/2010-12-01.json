The theoretical results are used to develop models of\nbinary or multiple system formation from RPPs, and explain the observation that\na greater fraction of binaries originated farther from the Sun. At the stage of\nRPPs, small-body satellites can form in two ways: a merger between RPPs can\nhave two centers of contraction, or the formation of satellites from a disc\naround the primary or the secondary. Formation of the disc can be caused by\nthat the angular momentum of the RPP formed by the merger is greater than the\ncritical angular momentum for a solid body. One or several satellites of the\nprimary (moving mainly in low-eccentricity orbits) can be formed from this disc\nat any separation less than the Hill radius. The first scenario can explain a\nsystem such as 2001 QW322 where the two components have similar masses but are\nseparated by a great distance.

We explore the effects of density asymmetry & a quasi-parallel\nmagnetic field on the collision of plasma clouds. A 2D relativistic PIC\nsimulation models the collision of two plasma clouds, in the presence of a\nquasi-parallel magnetic field. The cloud density ratio is 10. The densities of\nions & electrons & the temperature of 131 keV are equal in each cloud. The mass\nratio is 250. The peak Lorentz factor of the electrons is determined, along\nwith the orientation & strength of the magnetic field at the cloud collision\nboundary. The magnetic field component orthogonal to the initial plasma flow\ndirection is amplified to values that exceed those expected from shock\ncompression by over an order of magnitude. The forming shock is\nquasi-perpendicular due to this amplification, caused by a current sheet which\ndevelops in response to the differing deflection of the incoming upstream\nelectrons & ions. The electron deflection implies a charge separation of the\nupstream electrons & ions; the resulting electric field drags the electrons\nthrough the magnetic field, whereupon they acquire a relativistic mass\ncomparable to the ions. We demonstrate how a magnetic field structure\nresembling the cross section of a flux tube grows in the current sheet of the\nshock transition layer. Plasma filamentation develops, as well as signatures of\northogonal magnetic field striping. Localized magnetic bubbles form. Energy\nequipartition between the ion, electron & magnetic energy is obtained at the\nshock transition layer. The electronic radiation can provide a seed photon\npopulation that can be energized by secondary processes (e.g. inverse Compton).\n","Comment: 12 pages, 15 Figures, accepted to A&A"]}]

To investigate this question in detail, we have focused on the\npopularity of movies as measured by their box-office income. We observe that\nthe log-normal distribution describes well the tail (corresponding to the most\nsuccessful movies) of the empirical distributions for the total income, the\nincome on the opening week, as well as, the weekly income per theater. This\nobservation suggests that popularity may be the outcome of a linear\nmultiplicative stochastic process. In addition, the distributions of the total\nincome and the opening income show a bimodal form, with the majority of movies\neither performing very well or very poorly in theaters. We also observe that\nthe gross income per theater for a movie at any point during its lifetime is,\non average, inversely proportional to the period that has elapsed after its\nrelease. We argue that (i) the log-normal nature of the tail, (ii) the bimodal\nform of the overall gross income distribution, and (iii) the decay of gross\nincome per theater with time as a power law, constitute the fundamental set of\n{\\em stylized facts} (i.e., empirical \"laws\") that can be used to explain other\nobservations about movie popularity. We show that, in conjunction with an\nassumption of a fixed lower cut-off for income per theater below which a movie\nis withdrawn from a cinema, these laws can be used to derive a Weibull\ndistribution for the survival probability of movies which agrees with empirical\ndata. The connection to extreme-value distributions suggests that popularity\ncan be viewed as a process where a product becomes popular by avoiding failure\n(i.e., being pulled out from circulation) for many successive time periods.

Such a scenario can be realized in the \"Beyond the MSSM\"\ncontext. The relic abundance consistent with the WMAP result can be obtained\nwhen twice of neutralino mass is close to the light Higgs mass via the\nresonance enhancement of the annihilation cross section. As a result, the\nneutralino mass is predicted to be at around 5 to 6 GeV.\n","Comment: Talk given at the IDM 2010 conference JUL 26-30 2010, Montpellier,\n  France"]}]

First, the structure of the\nequations of motion underlying black hole solutions is considered, in theories\nof D-dimensional gravity coupled to scalars and vectors. For solutions\npreserving supersymmetry, the equations of motion have a dramatic\nsimplification: they become first-order instead of the second-order equations\none would expect. Recently, it was found that this is a feature some\nnon-supersymmetric black hole solutions exhibit as well. We investigate if this\nholds more generally, by examining what the conditions are to have first-order\nequations for the scalar fields of non-supersymmetric black holes, that mimic\nthe form of their supersymmetric counterparts. This is illustrated in examples.\nSecond, the structure of black holes themselves is investigated. String theory\nhas been successful in explaining the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for (mainly\nsupersymmetric) black holes from a microscopic perspective. However, it is not\nfully established what the interpretation of the corresponding 'microstates'\nshould be in the gravitational description where the black hole picture is\nvalid. There have been recent advances to understand the nature of black hole\nmicrostates in the gravity regime, such as the fuzzball proposal. A related\nidea says that black hole configurations with multiple centers are related to\nmicrostates of single-centered black holes. We report on work relating both\npictures. As an aside, a relation between violations of causality for certain\nspacetimes (presence of closed timelike curves in the geometry) and a breakdown\nof unitarity in the dual conformal field theory is given.\n","Comment: PhD thesis, 213 pages, 15 figures, dissertation presented in partial\n  fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Science at\n  K.U.Leuven, Belgium"]}]

Gravitational\nlens systems provide another probe of the Hubble constant using time delay\nmeasurements. However, current investigations of ~20 time delay lenses, albeit\nof varying levels of sophistication, have resulted in different values of the\nHubble constant ranging from 50-80 km/s/Mpc. In order to reduce uncertainties,\nmore time delay measurements are essential together with better determined mass\nmodels (Oguri 2007, Saha et al. 2006). We propose a more efficient technique\nfor measuring time delays which does not require regular monitoring with a\nhigh-resolution interferometer array. The method uses double image and\nlong-axis quadruple lens systems in which the brighter component varies first\nand dominates the total flux density. Monitoring the total flux density with\nlow-resolution but high sensitivity radio telescopes provides the variation of\nthe brighter image and is used to trigger high-resolution observations which\ncan then be used to see the variation in the fainter image. We present\nsimulations of this method together with a pilot project using the WSRT\n(Westerbork Radio Synthesis Telescope) to trigger VLA (Very Large Array)\nobservations. This new method is promising for measuring time delays because it\nuses relatively small amounts of time on high-resolution telescopes. This will\nbe important because many SKA pathfinder telescopes, such as MeerKAT (Karoo\nArray Telescope) and ASKAP (Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder), have\nhigh sensitivity but limited resolution.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 6 figures, Contribution to the 10th European VLBI Network\n  Symposium and EVN Users Meeting: VLBI and the new generation of radio arrays"]}]

We\nuse cosmological dark matter simulations of clusters to test the reliability of\nthe method, producing mock catalogues of tangential and radial gravitational\narcs and simulating the radial velocity dispersion profile of the cluster\nbrightest central galaxy. The density profiles of the simulated clusters\nclosely follow the NFW form, but we find that the recovered values of the inner\nslope are systematically underestimated, by about 0.4 in the mean, if the lens\nis assumed to be axially symmetric. However, if the ellipticity and orientation\nof the iso-contours of the cluster lensing potential are taken into account,\nthen the inner slopes can be recovered quite accurately for a significant\nsubset of the clusters whose central surface density profiles appear the most\nregular. These have lensing potentials with ellipticities in the range\n0.15-0.4. Further simulations projecting one cluster along many random\nlines-of-sight show that, even for lower ellipticities, the central slopes are\nunderestimated by $\\sim 10-35%$. These simulations closely mimic past\nobservations (see e.g. Sand et al., 2004), suggesting that existing estimates\nof the central slopes may be biased towards low values. For the remaining\nclusters, where the lensing potential is strongly perturbed by active merging\nor by substructure, the correct determination of the inner slope requires a\nmore accurate model for the lens. When the halo profile is modelled by a\ngeneralised NFW profile, we find that the inferred scale radius and\ncharacteristic density, unlike the inner slope, are generally poorly\nconstrained, since there is a strong degeneracy between these two parameters.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication on MNRAS"]}]
