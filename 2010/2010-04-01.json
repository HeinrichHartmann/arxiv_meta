If a throat is\nheated during cosmological evolution, energy is subsequently transferred to\nother throats and to the standard model. We calculate the heat transfer rate\nand the decay rate of throat-localized Kaluza-Klein states in a ten-dimensional\nmodel. For the calculation, we employ the dual description of the throats in\nterms of gauge theories. We discuss modifications of the decay rate which arise\nin flux compactifications and for Klebanov-Strassler throats and emphasize the\nrole of tachyonic scalars in such throats in mediating decays of Kaluza-Klein\nmodes. Our results are also applicable to the energy transfer from the heated\nstandard model to throats.

The Kaluza-Klein modes in the throats decay to other sectors with\na highly suppressed rate. If their lifetime is longer than the age of the\nuniverse, they are an interesting dark matter candidate.

These, also called \"diagonal Temperley-Lieb\ninvariants\", make possible the further introduction of the space of \"diagonal\nTemperley-Lieb harmonics\" and \"diagonal Temperley-Lieb coinvariant space\". We\npresent new results and conjectures concerning these spaces, as well as the\nspace obtained as the quotient of the ring of diagonal Temperley-Lieb\ninvariants by the ideal generated by constant term free diagonally symmetric\ninvariants. We also describe how the space of diagonal Temperley-Lieb\ninvariants affords a natural graded Hopf algebra structure, for n going to\ninfinity. We finally show how this last space and its graded dual Hopf algebra\nare related to the well known Hopf algebras of symmetric functions,\nquasi-symmetric functions and noncommutative symmetric functions.\n","Comment: 18 pages"]}]
