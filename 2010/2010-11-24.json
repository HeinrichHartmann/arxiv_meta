They however entail high\ncommunication overhead for maintenance, when some of the encoded fragments are\nlost and need to be replenished. Such overheads arise from the fundamental need\nto recreate (or keep separately) first a copy of the whole object before any\nindividual encoded fragment can be generated and replenished. There has been\nrecently intense interest to explore alternatives, most prominent ones being\nregenerating codes (RGC) and hierarchical codes (HC). We propose as an\nalternative a new family of codes to improve the maintenance process, which we\ncall self-repairing codes (SRC), with the following salient features: (a)\nencoded fragments can be repaired directly from other subsets of encoded\nfragments without having to reconstruct first the original data, ensuring that\n(b) a fragment is repaired from a fixed number of encoded fragments, the number\ndepending only on how many encoded blocks are missing and independent of which\nspecific blocks are missing. These properties allow for not only low\ncommunication overhead to recreate a missing fragment, but also independent\nreconstruction of different missing fragments in parallel, possibly in\ndifferent parts of the network. We analyze the static resilience of SRCs with\nrespect to traditional erasure codes, and observe that SRCs incur marginally\nlarger storage overhead in order to achieve the aforementioned properties. The\nsalient SRC properties naturally translate to low communication overheads for\nreconstruction of lost fragments, and allow reconstruction with lower latency\nby facilitating repairs in parallel. These desirable properties make\nself-repairing codes a good and practical candidate for networked distributed\nstorage systems.\n"]}]

Recently we rediscussed the problem of modelling the\ndouble-periodic pulsation with non-linear hydrocodes. We showed that the\npublished non-resonant double-mode models are incorrect, because they exclude\nthe negative buoyancy effects. Aims. We continue our efforts to verify whether\nthe Kuhfuss one-equation convection model with negative buoyancy included can\nreproduce the double-periodic Cepheid pulsation. Methods. Using the direct time\nintegration hydrocode, which implements the Kuhfuss convection model, we search\nfor stable double-periodic Cepheid models. We search for models pulsating in\nboth fundamental and first overtone modes (F+1O), as well as in the two lowest\norder overtones (1O+2O). In the latter case, we focus on reproducing\ndouble-overtone Cepheids of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Results. We have\nfound full amplitude non-linear beat Cepheid models of both types, F+1O and\n1O+2O. In the case of F+1O models, the beat pulsation is most likely caused by\nthe three-mode resonance, 2omega_1=omega_0+omega_2, while in the\ndouble-overtone models the underlying mechanism (resonant or non-resonant)\ncannot be identified beyond doubt. Double-periodic models found in our survey\nexist, however, only in narrow period ranges and cannot explain the majority of\nthe observed double-periodic objects. Conclusions. With only little doubt left,\nwe conclude that current one dimensional one-equation convection models are\nincapable of reproducing the majority of the observed beat Cepheids. Among the\nshortcomings of current pulsation hydrocodes, the simple treatment of\nconvection seems to be the most severe one. Growing evidence for the presence\nof non-radial modes in Cepheids suggests that the interaction between radial\nand non-radial modes should also be investigated.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 6 Figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy and\n  Astrophysics"]}]

For about two decades, knowledge based potentials based on\npairwise distances -- so-called \"potentials of mean force\" (PMFs) -- have been\ncenter stage in the prediction and design of protein structure and the\nsimulation of protein folding. However, the validity, scope and limitations of\nthese potentials are still vigorously debated and disputed, and the optimal\nchoice of the reference state -- a necessary component of these potentials --\nis an unsolved problem. PMFs are loosely justified by analogy to the reversible\nwork theorem in statistical physics, or by a statistical argument based on a\nlikelihood function. Both justifications are insightful but leave many\nquestions unanswered. Here, we show for the first time that PMFs can be seen as\napproximations to quantities that do have a rigorous probabilistic\njustification: they naturally arise when probability distributions over\ndifferent features of proteins need to be combined. We call these quantities\nreference ratio distributions deriving from the application of the reference\nratio method. This new view is not only of theoretical relevance, but leads to\nmany insights that are of direct practical use: the reference state is uniquely\ndefined and does not require external physical insights; the approach can be\ngeneralized beyond pairwise distances to arbitrary features of protein\nstructure; and it becomes clear for which purposes the use of these quantities\nis justified. We illustrate these insights with two applications, involving the\nradius of gyration and hydrogen bonding. In the latter case, we also show how\nthe reference ratio method can be iteratively applied to sculpt an energy\nfunnel.

The unobstructed outflow jets are faster and longer than the\noutflow jets directed towards the magnetic island that forms between the two\ncurrent sheets. The X-line and flow stagnation point are located near the\ntrailing end of each current sheet very close to the obstructed exit. The speed\nof X-line retreat ranges from ~0.02-0.06 while the speed of stagnation point\nretreat ranges from ~0.03-0.07, in units of the initial upstream Alfven\nvelocity. Early in time, the flow stagnation point is located closer to the\ncenter of the current sheet than the X-line, but later on the relative\npositions of these two points switch. Consequently, late in time there is\nsignificant plasma flow across the X-line in the opposite direction of X-line\nretreat. Throughout the simulation, the velocity at the X-line does not equal\nthe velocity of the X-line. Motivated by these results, an expression for the\nrate of X-line retreat is derived in terms of local parameters at the X-point.\nThis expression shows that X-line retreat is due to both advection by the bulk\nplasma flow and diffusion of the normal component of the magnetic field.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 8 figures.
