The main idea hinges on the fact that\nwe can form tensors from the difference, C^a_bc, of the Levi-Civita connections\nof the two metrics, and these act like gravitational accelerations. In the\ncontext of MOND we can form dimensionless `acceleration' scalars, and functions\nthereof, from contractions of C^a_bc/a0.
