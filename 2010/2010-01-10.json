This\nconclusion is drawn by comparing molecular dynamics simulations at constant\ntemperature with the dynamics on the graph, defined by a temperature dependent\nMarkov process. The main advantage of the graph representation is that its\ndynamics can be naturally renormalized by collecting nodes into \"hubs\", while\nredefining their connectivity. We show that both topological and dynamical\nproperties are preserved by the renormalization procedure. Moreover, we obtain\nclear indications that the heteropolymers exhibit common topological\nproperties, at variance with the homopolymer, whose peculiar graph structure\nstems from its spatial homogeneity. In order to obtain a clear distinction\nbetween a \"fast folder\" and a \"slow folder\" in the heteropolymers one has to\nlook at kinetic features of the directed graph. We find that the average time\nneeded to the fast folder for reaching its native configuration is two orders\nof magnitude smaller than its equilibration time, while for the bad folder\nthese time scales are comparable. Accordingly, we can conclude that the\nstrategy described in this paper can be successfully applied also to more\nrealistic models, by studying their renormalized dynamics on the directed\ngraph, rather than performing lengthy molecular dynamics simulations.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 12 figures"]}]
