We discuss the method employing the relativistic line profiles of iron in\nthe X-ray domain, where the emergent spectrum is blurred by general\nrelativistic effects. Precision of spectra fitting procedure could be\ncompromised by inappropriate account of the angular distribution of the disc\nemission. Often a unique profile is assumed, invariable over the entire range\nof radii in the disc and energy in the spectral band. We study how sensitive\nthe spin determination is to the assumptions about the intrinsic angular\ndistribution of the emitted photons. We find that the uncertainty of the\ndirectional emission distribution translates to 20% uncertainty in\ndetermination of the marginally stable orbit. By assuming a rotating black hole\nin the centre of an accretion disc, we perform radiation transfer computations\nof an X-ray irradiated disc atmosphere to determine the directionality of\noutgoing X-rays in the 2-10 keV energy band. We implemented the simulation\nresults as a new extension to the KY software package for X-ray spectra fitting\nof relativistic accretion disc models. Although the parameter space is rather\ncomplex, leading to a rich variety of possible outcomes, we find that on\naverage the isotropic directionality reproduces our model data to the best\nprecision. Our results also suggest that an improper usage of limb darkening\ncan partly mimic a steeper profile of radial emissivity.

Species trees represent populations of individuals\n-- each with many genes -- splitting into new populations or species. The\ncoalescent process, which models ancestry of gene copies within populations, is\noften used to model the probability distribution of gene trees given a fixed\nspecies tree. This multispecies coalescent model provides a framework for\nphylogeneticists to infer species trees from gene trees using maximum\nlikelihood or Bayesian approaches. Because the coalescent models a branching\nprocess over time, all trees are typically assumed to be rooted in this\nsetting. Often, however, gene trees inferred by traditional phylogenetic\nmethods are unrooted.\n  We investigate probabilities of unrooted gene trees under the multispecies\ncoalescent model. We show that when there are 4 species with one gene sampled\nper species, the distribution of unrooted gene tree topologies identifies the\nunrooted species tree topology and some, but not all, information in the\nspecies tree edges (branch lengths). The location of the root on the species\ntree is not identifiable in this situation. However, for 5 or more species with\none gene sampled per species, we show that the distribution of unrooted gene\ntree topologies identifies the rooted species tree topology and all its\ninternal branch lengths.

In particular, the green\ndioptase is supposed to grant the skill to speak with trees and to understand\nthe language of birds. Armed with natural samples of dioptase, we were able to\nunravel the magnetic nature of the mineral (presumably with hidden support from\nbirds and trees) and show that strong quantum fluctuations can be realized in\nan essentially framework-type spin lattice of coupled chains, thus neither\nfrustration nor low-dimensionality are prerequisites. We present a microscopic\nmagnetic model for the green dioptase. Based on full-potential DFT\ncalculations, we find two relevant couplings in this system: an\nantiferromagnetic coupling J_c, forming spiral chains along the hexagonal c\naxis, and an inter-chain ferromagnetic coupling J_d within structural Cu2O6\ndimers. To refine the J_c and J_d values and to confirm the proposed spin\nmodel, we perform quantum Monte-Carlo simulations for the dioptase spin\nlattice. The derived magnetic susceptibility, the magnetic ground state, and\nthe sublattice magnetization are in remarkably good agreement with the\nexperimental data. The refined model parameters are J_c = 78 K and J_d = -37 K\nwith J_d/J_c ~ -0.5. Despite the apparent three-dimensional features of the\nspin lattice and the lack of frustration, strong quantum fluctuations in the\nsystem are evidenced by a broad maximum in the magnetic susceptibility, a\nreduced value of the Neel temperature T_N ~ 15 K >> J_c, and a low value of the\nsublattice magnetization m = 0.55 Bohr magneton.
