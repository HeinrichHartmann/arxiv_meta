High mass and spatial resolution is a necessary condition in\norder to obtain large disks comparable with observed spiral galaxies avoiding\nspurious dissipation of angular momentum. A realistic model of the star\nformation history. gas-to-stars ratio and the morphology of the stellar and\ngaseous component is instead controlled by the phenomenological description of\nthe non-gravitational energy budget in the galaxy.

In particular, the\nmodel requires no top partners and no \"little Higgs\" mechanism. A nontrivial\nvacuum alignment results from the interplay of the top loop and technifermion\nmass terms. The composite Higgs mass is completely determined by the top loop,\nin the sense that m_h/m_t is independent of the vacuum alignment and is\ncomputable by a strong-coupling calculation.

These rules concern the overall\nsize of the population sampled by a frame as measured by its total luminosity,\nand allow to estimate the number of stars (in all evolutionary stages) that are\nincluded in the frame. The total luminosity sampled by each pixel (or\nresolution element) allows instead to estimate to which depth meaningful\nstellar photometry can be safely attempted, and below which crowding makes it\nimpossible. Simple relations give also the number of pixels (resolution\nelements) in the frame that will contain an unresolved blend of two stars of\nany kind. It is shown that the number of such blends increases quadratically\nwith both the surface brightness of the target, as well as with the angular\nsize of the pixel (or resolution element). A series of examples are presented\nillustrating how the rules are practically used in concrete observational\nsituations.

Their support is attributed to the random supersonic motions observed in\nthem. We study the support of molecular clouds against gravitational collapse\nby supersonic, gas dynamical turbulence using direct numerical simulation.\nComputations with two different algorithms are compared: a particle-based,\nLagrangian method (SPH), and a grid-based, Eulerian, second-order method\n(ZEUS). The effects of both algorithm and resolution can be studied with this\nmethod. We find that, under typical molecular cloud conditions, global collapse\ncan indeed be prevented, but density enhancements caused by strong shocks\nnevertheless become gravitationally unstable and collapse into dense cores and,\npresumably, stars. The occurance and efficiency of local collapse decreases as\nthe driving wave length decreases and the driving strength increases. It\nappears that local collapse can only be prevented entirely with unrealistically\nshort wave length driving, but observed core formation rates can be reproduced\nwith more realistic driving. At high collapse rates, cores are formed on short\ntime scales in coherent structures with high efficiency, while at low collapse\nrates they are scattered randomly throughout the region and exhibit\nconsiderable age spread. We suggest that this naturally explains the observed\ndistinction between isolated and clustered star formation.\n","Comment: Minor revisions in response to referee, thirteen figures, accepted to\n  Astrophys.
