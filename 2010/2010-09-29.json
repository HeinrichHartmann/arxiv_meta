We analyze 93\nmock relaxed clusters, built from a cosmological simulation. The stacked mock\ncluster is well fit by an m=5 Einasto DM density profile (but only out to 1.5\nvirial radii [r_v]), with velocity anisotropy (VA) close to the Mamon-Lokas\nmodel with VA radius equal to that of density slope -2. The surface density of\nFBIs is nearly flat out to r_v, while their LOS velocity distribution shows a\ndominant gaussian cluster-outskirts component and a flat field component. This\ndistribution of FBIs in projected phase space is nearly universal in mass. A\nlocal k=2.7 sigma velocity cut returns the LOS velocity dispersion profile\n(LOSVDP) expected from the NFW density and VA profiles measured in 3D. The HF\ncauses a shallower outer LOSVDP that cannot be well matched by the Einasto\nmodel for any k.

The observed constancy of the mass-function shape for\nstar-forming galaxies, demands that the mass-quenching of galaxies around and\nabove M*, must be proportional to their star-formation rates at all z < 2. We\npostulate that this simple mass-quenching law also holds over a much broader\nrange of stellar mass and epoch. These two simple quenching processes, plus\nsome additional quenching due to merging, then naturally produce (a) a\nquasi-static Schechter mass function for star-forming galaxies with a value of\nM* that is set by the proportionality between the star-formation and\nmass-quenching rates, (b) a double Schechter function for passive galaxies with\ntwo components: the dominant one is produced by mass-quenching and has exactly\nthe same M* as the star-forming galaxies but an alpha shallower by +1, while\nthe other is produced by environment effects and has the same M* and alpha as\nthe star-forming galaxies, and is larger in high density environments.\nSubsequent merging of quenched galaxies modifies these predictions somewhat in\nthe denser environments, slightly increasing M* and making alpha more negative.\nAll of these detailed quantitative relationships between the Schechter\nparameters are indeed seen in the SDSS, lending strong support to our simple\nempirically-based model. The model naturally produces for passive galaxies the\n\"anti-hierarchical\" run of mean ages and alpha-element abundances with mass.\n","Comment: 66 pages, 19 figures, 1 movie, accepted for publication in ApJ.

However, the high turbidity of foams generally\nhinders the detailed study of the temporal and spatial distribution of\nrearrangement events, such that definite assessments regarding their\ncontribution to the overall dynamics could not be made so far. In this paper,\nwe use novel light scattering techniques to measure the frequency and position\nof events within a large sample volume. As recently reported (A. S. Gittings\nand D. J. Durian, Phys. Rev. E, 2008, 78, 066313), we find that the foam\ndynamics is determined by two distinct processes: intermittent bubble\nrearrangements of finite duration and a spatially homogeneous quasicontinuous\nprocess. Our experiments show that the convolution of these two processes\ndetermines the age-dependence of the mean dynamics, such that relations between\nintermittent rearrangements and coarsening process can not be established by\nconsidering means. By contrast the use of the recently introduced photon\ncorrelation imaging technique (A. Duri, D. A. Sessoms, V. Trappe, and L.\nCipelletti, Phys. Rev. Lett., 2009, 102, 085702) enables us to assess that the\nevent frequency is directly determined by the strain-rate imposed by the\ncoarsening process. Surprisingly, we also find that, although the distribution\nof successive events in time is consistent with a random process, the spatial\ndistribution of successive events is not random: rearrangements are more likely\nto occur within a recently rearranged zone. This implies that a topological\nrearrangement is likely to lead to an unstable configuration, such that a small\namount of coarsening-induced strain is sufficient to trigger another event.\n"]}]

We study primarily the termination objective,\nwhere the goal of one player is to maximize the probability of reaching counter\nvalue 0, while the other player wishes to avoid this. Partly motivated by the\ngoal of understanding termination objectives, we also study certain \"limit\" and\n\"long run average\" reward objectives that are closely related to some\nwell-studied objectives for stochastic games with rewards. Examples of problems\nwe address include: does player 1 have a strategy to ensure that the counter\neventually hits 0, i.e., terminates, almost surely, regardless of what player 2\ndoes? Or that the liminf (or limsup) counter value equals infinity with a\ndesired probability? Or that the long run average reward is >0 with desired\nprobability? We show that the qualitative termination problem for OC-SSGs is in\nNP intersection coNP, and is in P-time for 1-player OC-SSGs, or equivalently\nfor one-counter Markov Decision Processes (OC-MDPs). Moreover, we show that\nquantitative limit problems for OC-SSGs are in NP intersection coNP, and are in\nP-time for 1-player OC-MDPs. Both qualitative limit problems and qualitative\ntermination problems for OC-SSGs are already at least as hard as Condon's\nquantitative decision problem for finite-state SSGs.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 1 figure.
