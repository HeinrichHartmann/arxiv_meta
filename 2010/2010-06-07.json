Modification of the set\npartitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) image coder is proposed to generate\nfour different groups of bit-stream relative to its significances. The\nsignificant bits, the sign bits, the set bits and the refinement bits are\ntransmitted in four different groups. The proposed method for reducing the PAPR\nutilizes twice the unequal error protection (UEP), using the Read-Solomon codes\n(RS), in conjunction with bit-rate allocation and selective interleaving to\nprovide minimum PAPR. The output bit-stream from the source code (SPIHT) will\nbe started by the most significant types of bits (first group of bits). The\noptimal unequal error protection (UEP) of the four groups is proposed based on\nthe channel destortion. The proposed structure provides significant improvement\nin bit error rate (BER) performance.

Extending the notion of a\ntwo-dimensional TQFT from cobordisms to suitable manifolds with corners\ntherefore makes the relationship between the global description of the TQFT in\nterms of a functor into the category of vector spaces and the local description\nin terms of a state sum fully transparent.

For every plane\ndiagram of an oriented tangle, we construct a chain complex whose homology is\ninvariant under Reidemeister moves. The terms of this chain complex are modules\nof a suitable algebra A such that there is one action of A or A^op for every\nboundary point of the tangle. We give examples of such algebras A for which our\ntangle homology theory reduces to the link homology theories of Khovanov, Lee,\nand Bar-Natan if it is evaluated for links. As a consequence of the Cardy\ncondition, Khovanov's graded theory can only be extended to tangles if the\nunderlying field has finite characteristic. In all cases in which the algebra A\nis strongly separable, i.e. for Bar-Natan's theory in any characteristic and\nfor Lee's theory in characteristic other than 2, we also provide the required\nalgebraic operation for the composition of oriented tangles. Just as Khovanov's\ntheory for links can be recovered from Lee's or Bar-Natan's by a suitable\nspectral sequence, we provide a spectral sequence in order to compute our\ntangle extension of Khovanov's theory from that of Bar-Natan's or Lee's theory.\nThus, we provide a tangle homology theory that is locally computable and still\nstrong enough to recover characteristic p Khovanov homology for links.\n","Comment: 56 pages, LaTeX2e with xypic and pstricks macros"]}]
