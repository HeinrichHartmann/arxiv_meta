Despite high output, the\ncurrent in such a thin film device often decays drastically. The present paper\nis focused on understanding this problem. A systematic, multiphysics based\nmodelling approach is proposed. First, a nucleation coupled model for\ndegradation of the CNT thin film is derived, where the CNTs are assumed to\ndecay by fragmentation and formation of clusters. The random orientation of the\nCNTs and the electromechanical interaction are then modeled to explain the\nself-assembly. The degraded state of the CNTs and the electromechanical force\nare employed to update the orientation of the CNTs. Field emission current at\nthe device scale is finally obtained by using the Fowler-Nordheim equation and\nintegration over the computational cell surfaces on the anode side. The\nsimulated results are in close agreement with the experimental results.

We characterize the efficiency of\nthe optimized histogram sampling by measuring round-trip times tau(N,Q) across\nthe phase transition for samples of size N spins.

Taken together, our results\nsupport a comprehensive and theoretically consistent extension of Granger\ncausality to the multivariate case. Treated individually, they highlight\nseveral specific advantages of the generalized variance measure, which we\nillustrate using applications in neuroscience as an example. We further show\nhow the measure can be used to define \"partial\" Granger causality in the\nmultivariate context and we also motivate reformulations of \"causal density\"\nand \"Granger autonomy\". Our results are directly applicable to experimental\ndata and promise to reveal new types of functional relations in complex\nsystems, neural and otherwise.\n","Comment: added 1 reference, minor change to discussion, typos corrected; 28\n  pages, 3 figures, 1 table, LaTeX"]}]

This result is surprising in that it\nseems to violate the classic Bohr-van Leeuwen Theorem on the absence of\nclassical diamagnetism. It was indeed questioned by some workers [EPL, 89,\n(2010) 37001] who verified that the Fokker-Planck (FP) equation derived from\nour Langevin equation, was satisfied by the classical canonical density in the\nsteady state, obtained by setting d/dt=0 in the FP equation. Inasmuch as the\ncanonical density does not contain the magnetic field, they concluded that the\ndiamagnetic moment must be zero. The purpose of this note is to show that this\nargument and the conclusion are invalid -- instead of setting d/dt=0 one must\nfirst obtain the fundamental time-dependent solution for the FP equation, and\nthen calculate the expectation value of the diamagnetic moment, and finally\nconsider its long-time limit (i.e., $t \\to \\infty$). This would indeed\ncorrespond to our numerical simulation of the dynamics.

However, in this work we report on a macroscopic system, which\ndoes not obey the above postulates and demonstrates specific quantum behaviour\non a macroscopic length. It is conventional quantum Hall system possessing an\nasymmetric confining potential in presence of a tilted quantizing magnetic\nfield. In the direction, along which the system is macroscopic, it demonstrates\nthe following unusual properties: (i) a spatially-dependent response on a\nspatially-homogeneous photo-excitation that implies spontaneous breaking of\ntranslational symmetry (ii) high sensitivity of a local photo-response to the\nconditions of macroscopically remote local regions (iii) excitation of whole\nsystem through the excitation of its local region without an appropriate energy\ntransfer within the system. All these properties imply the electron coherent\nlength to be as high as the macroscopic sample length. We demonstrate that the\neffect revealed opens the door for an energy-free quantum communication on\nmacroscopic distances.\n","Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to significant\n  loopholes in the proposed interpretation."]}]

Based on\nthe observation that, when changing its lane, a vehicle affects traffic on both\nits current and target lanes, we propose to capture such lateral interactions\nby introducing a new lane-changing intensity variable. With a modified\nfundamental diagram, we are able to study the impacts of lane-changing traffic\non overall traffic flow.

For a location-dependent\nlane-changing intensity variable, we discuss kinematic wave solutions of the\nRiemann problem of the new model and introduce a supply-demand method for its\nnumerical solutions. With both theoretical and empirical analysis, we\ndemonstrate that lane-changes could have significant bottleneck effects on\noverall traffic flow. In the future, we will be interested in studying\nlane-changing intensities for different road geometries, locations,\non-ramp/off-ramp flows, as well as traffic conditions.
