The\nmeasurement device consists of a single As dopant incorporated in a Silicon\nnanostructure. The atomic orbitals of the dopant are tunable by the gate\nelectric field. When they are tuned such that the ground state of the atomic\nsystem becomes a (nearly) degenerate superposition of two of the Silicon\nvalleys, an exotic and hitherto unobserved valley Kondo effect appears.\nTogether with the regular spin Kondo, the tunable valley Kondo effect allows\nfor reversible electrical control over the symmetry of the Kondo ground state\nfrom an SU(2)- to an SU(4) -configuration.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 8 figures"]}]

It can handle loads that are not necessarily rotationally\nsymmetric. Nystrom discretization is used to discretize the BIEs on the\ngenerating curve. The quadrature used is a high-order Gaussian rule that is\nmodified near the diagonal to retain high-order accuracy for singular kernels.\nThe reduction in dimensionality, along with the use of high-order accurate\nquadratures, leads to small linear systems that can be inverted directly via,\ne.g., Gaussian elimination.

This algorithm is written in the style of a\nsequent proof system. The advantage of this algorithm over traditional ones is\nthat the complex conversion process from regular expressions to finite automata\nis not needed. As a consequence, our algorithm is simple and extends easily to\nvarious extensions to regular expressions such as timed regular expressions or\nregular languages with the intersection.\n","Comment: IEEE format, International Journal of Computer Science and\n  Information Security, IJCSIS January 2010, ISSN 1947 5500,\n  http://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/"]}]
