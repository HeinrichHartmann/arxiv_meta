We assume that E. coli is in a state of balanced\nexponential steadystate growth, growing in a temporally and spatially constant\nenvironment, rich in resources. We apply this model to a series of past\nmeasurements, where the growth rate and rRNA-to-protein ratio have been\nmeasured for seven E. coli strains with an rRNA operon copy number ranging from\none to seven (the wild-type copy number). These experiments show that growth\nrate markedly decreases for strains with fewer than six copies. Using the\nmodel, we were able to reproduce these measurements. We show that the model\nthat best fits these data suggests that the volume fraction of macromolecules\ninside E. coli is not fixed when the rRNA operon copy number is varied.\nMoreover, the model predicts that increasing the copy number beyond seven\nresults in a cytoplasm densely packed with ribosomes and proteins. Assuming\nthat under such overcrowded conditions prolonged diffusion times tend to weaken\nbinding affinities, the model predicts that growth rate will not increase\nsubstantially beyond the wild-type growth rate, as indicated by other\nexperiments. Our model therefore suggests that changing the rRNA operon copy\nnumber of wild-type E. coli cells growing in a constant rich environment does\nnot substantially increase their growth rate. Other observations regarding\nstrains with an altered rRNA operon copy number, such as nucleoid compaction\nand the rRNA operon feedback response, appear to be qualitatively consistent\nwith this model.

In 2-dimensional space, we prove that the Kantorovich\nfunction is convex if and only if the condition number of its matrix is bounded\nabove by $3+2\\sqrt{2}, $ and thus the convexity of the function with two\nvariables can be completely characterized by the condition number.

Furthermore, we prove that this general sufficient\nconvexity condition can be remarkably improved in 3-dimensional space.
