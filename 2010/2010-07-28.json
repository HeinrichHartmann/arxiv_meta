The\nnew physics of the dynamical 3-space is extensively tested against experimental\nand astronomical observations, including the necessary generalisation of the\nMaxwell, Schrodinger and Dirac equations, leading to a derivation and\nexplanation of gravity as a refraction effect of quantum matter waves.

In\nthe work presented here, we experimentally study this important advantage by\nimplementing different entanglement-based QKD setups on a 144~km free-space\nlink between the two Canary Islands of La Palma and Tenerife. We established\nthree different configurations where the entangled photon source was placed at\nAlice's location, asymmetrically between Alice and Bob and symmetrically in the\nmiddle between Alice and Bob, respectively. The resulting quantum channel\nattenuations of 35~dB, 58~dB and 71~dB, respectively, significantly exceed the\nlimit for WCP systems.

However, there are\ninteresting limitations to this description: the very existence of\nquasiparticles cannot be taken for granted in some systems. Like unstable\nelementary particles, quasiparticles cannot survive beyond a threshold where\ncertain decay channels become allowed by conservation laws - their spectrum\nterminates at this threshold. This regime of quasiparticle failure was first\npredicted for an exotic state of matter, super-fluid helium-4 at temperatures\nclose to absolute zero - a quantum Bose-liquid where zero-point atomic motion\nprecludes crystallization. Using neutron scattering, here we show that it can\nalso occur in a quantum magnet and, by implication, in other systems with\nBose-quasiparticles. We have measured spin excitations in a two dimensional\n(2D) quantum-magnet, piperazinium hexachlorodicuprate (PHCC) in which spin-1/2\ncopper ions form a non-magnetic quantum spin liquid (QSL), and find remarkable\nsimilarities with excitations measured in superfluid 4He. There is a threshold\nmomentum beyond which the quasiparticle peak merges with the two-quasiparticle\ncontinuum. It then acquires a finite energy width and becomes indistinguishable\nfrom a leading-edge singularity, so that lowest excited states occupy a wide\nband of energy.

In our second\nexample we consider the localization of relative atomic phase between two Bose\nEinstein condensates, looking particularly at the build up of spatial\ninterference patterns, an area which has attracted much attention since the\nwork of Javanainen and Yoo.
