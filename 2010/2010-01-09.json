The typical double-peaked CaII 8498,8542,8662A\nemission lines can be modelled in terms of a Keplerian gas disc with a radial\nextent from ~0.5Rsun to ~1.0. The effective temperature of SDSS0845+2257,\nTeff=18600+-500K, is comparable to the two other white dwarfs with gaseous\ndiscs, SDSS1043+0855 and SDSS1228+1040, and hence substantially hotter than the\nbulk of white dwarfs where dusty debris discs were identified through the\npresence of infrared excess flux. This may suggest that the conditions to\nproduce emission lines from debris discs in the optical wavelength range are\nonly met for a relatively narrow range in Teff. The observed asymmetry in the\nline profiles indicates a substantial eccentricity in the disc. Two spectra\nobtained four years apart reveal a significant change in the shapes and\nequivalent widths of the line profiles, implying that the circumstellar disc\nevolves on relatively short time scales. In contrast to SDSS1043+0855 and\nSDSS1228+1040, SDSS0845+2257 has a helium-dominated atmosphere.

Using the Stoner model of itinerant\nferromagnetism, we study the feedback effect of the p-wave superconductivity on\nthe ferromagnetism. Below $T_{c}$, the ferromagnetism is enhanced by the p-wave\nsuperconductivity. At zero temperature, the critical Stoner value for itinerant\nferromagnetism is reduced by the strength of the p-wave pairing potential, and\nthe magnetization increases correspondingly. More important, our results\nsuggest that once Stoner ferromagnetism is established, $T_m$ is unlikely to\never be below $T_c$.
