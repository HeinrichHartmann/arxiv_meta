In mechanical isolation, i.e., if the net force\nacting on the total system consisting of the particles plus the interface\nvanishes, the superposition approximation is actually invalid.

In\ntheory, we tighten the exponential upper bound substantially; furthermore, we\nconstruct pathological triangulations that prove an exponential bound to be\nunavoidable. In practice, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of millions of\ntriangulations and find that in general the number of vertex normal surfaces is\nremarkably small, with strong evidence that our pathological triangulations may\nin fact be the worst case scenarios. This analysis is the first of its kind,\nand the striking behaviour that we observe has important implications for the\nfeasibility of topological algorithms in three dimensions.\n","Comment: Extended abstract (i.e., conference-style), 14 pages, 8 figures, 2\n  tables; v2: added minor clarifications"]}]

While consuming\nenergy, we finally practically all the produced energy is dissipated as heat.\nAs the way of preventing the \"thermal death\" the author suggests that we should\ntransit to the thermocyclic power engineering based on using heat circulation\nand build \"cold storage plants\" which must collect the dissipated heat and\ntransform it into forms of energy necessary to mankind. As a rule the\ndissipated heat has low temperature gradients. For this reason the efficiency\nof \"cold storage plants\" of the classic type (with coolers) is too small and\ntherefore they cannot be used as the basis of thermocyclic power engineering.\nThis fact makes us consider the perpetual motion engines of the second kind.\nHaving analyzed (excessively) numerous formulations of the Second Law of\nthermodynamics, the author has concluded that the prohibition of these engines\nis groundless. From the author's point of view this prohibition is a\nconsequence of the following mistakes made by the founders of Thermodynamics.\n1. Having in mind the concept of non-exterminable phlogiston, S. Carnot made a\nconclusion that the heat does not disappear but is only transferred from a warm\nbody to a cold one and therefore a cooler is necessary for any thermal engine.\nHowever, today we know that while heat is consumed, it does disappear as heat\nand converts into other forms of energy. Hence, Carnot's argumentation is\nwrong. 2.The Entropy Increase Law is wrongly reduced to the Thermal Entropy\nIncrease \"Law\" while in Nature the Total Entropy Increase Law works. Due to\ngroundlessness of the Thermal Entropy Increase \"Law\", the thermal entropy can\ndecrease and a compensation of converting thermal energy into mechanical work\ncan be non-thermal. Therefore a cooler is not necessary for a thermal engine.\n"]}]

Two programming techniques that may be\nused to pursue these goals in a persistent environment are type-safe linguistic\nreflection and hyper-programming. The first provides a mechanism by which the\nprogrammer can write generators that, when executed, produce new program\nrepresentations. This allows the specification of programs that are highly\ngeneric yet depend in non-trivial ways on the types of the data on which they\noperate. Genericity promotes software reuse which in turn reduces the amount of\nnew code that has to be written. Hyper-programming allows a source program to\ncontain links to data items in the persistent store. This improves program\nreliability by allowing certain program checking to be performed earlier than\nis otherwise possible. It also reduces the amount of code written by permitting\ndirect links to data in the place of textual descriptions. Both techniques\ncontribute to the understanding of the persistent environment through\nsupporting the implementation of store browsing tools and allowing source\nrepresentations to be associated with all executable programs in the persistent\nstore. This thesis describes in detail the structure of type-safe linguistic\nreflection and hyper-programming, their benefits in the persistent context, and\na suite of programming tools that support reflective programming and\nhyper-programming.

Nearest neighbor search (NNS) algorithms are often used\nto retrieve similar entries, given a query. While there exist efficient\ntechniques for exact query lookup using hashing, similarity search using exact\nnearest neighbors is known to be a hard problem and in high dimensions, best\nknown solutions offer little improvement over a linear scan. Fast solutions to\nthe approximate NNS problem include Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) based\ntechniques, which need storage polynomial in $n$ with exponent greater than\n$1$, and query time sublinear, but still polynomial in $n$, where $n$ is the\nsize of the database. In this work we present a new technique of solving the\napproximate NNS problem in Euclidean space using a Ternary Content Addressable\nMemory (TCAM), which needs near linear space and has O(1) query time. In fact,\nthis method also works around the best known lower bounds in the cell probe\nmodel for the query time using a data structure near linear in the size of the\ndata base. TCAMs are high performance associative memories widely used in\nnetworking applications such as access control lists. A TCAM can query for a\nbit vector within a database of ternary vectors, where every bit position\nrepresents $0$, $1$ or $*$. The $*$ is a wild card representing either a $0$ or\na $1$. We leverage TCAMs to design a variant of LSH, called Ternary Locality\nSensitive Hashing (TLSH) wherein we hash database entries represented by\nvectors in the Euclidean space into $\\{0,1,*\\}$. By using the added\nfunctionality of a TLSH scheme with respect to the $*$ character, we solve an\ninstance of the approximate nearest neighbor problem with 1 TCAM access and\nstorage nearly linear in the size of the database.

Recently\nthere has been strong experimental evidence showing that C4 symmetry breaking\noccurs on formation of the pseudogap. This form of symmetry breaking was\npredicted by the Fluctuating Bond Model (FBM), an empirical model based on a\nstrong, local coupling of electrons to the square of the planar oxygen vibrator\namplitudes. In this paper we approach the FBM theory from a new direction,\nstarting from {\\it ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations\ndemonstrate a doping-dependent instability of the in-plane oxygens towards\ndisplacement off the Cu-O-Cu bond axis. From these results and perturbation\ntheory we derive an improved and quantitative form of the Fluctuating Bond\nModel. A mean field solution of the FBM leads to C4 symmetry breaking in the\noxygen vibrational amplitudes, and to a d-type pseudogap in the electronic\nspectrum, the features linked by recent experimental data. The phase diagram of\nthe pseudogap derived from mean field theory, its doping- and\ntemperature-dependences, including the phase boundary T$^*$, agree well with\nexperimental data. We extend the theory to include the long range Coulomb\ninteraction on the same basis as the FBM interaction. When the long-range\nCoulomb interaction is included in the FBM, a CDW instability in the charge\nchannel is predicted which explains the nanoscale, rather than spatially\nuniform, behavior of the C4 symmetry-breaking. Taking the CDW into account,\nwith the theoretical k-dependence of the pseudogap, enables the Fermi Surface\narc phenomenon to be understood.\n","Comment: 37 pages, 5 figures, 1 table"]}]
