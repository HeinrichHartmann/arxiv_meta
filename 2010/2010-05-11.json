The model uses a concept of\nsemiconductor band gap engineering, such as the staggered energy band gap\nline-up in semiconductors.

The only energetic configuration that\nallows charges separation under illumination is the staggered one between two\nmaterials or molecules. We explain why (e-, h+) interacting charges can be\nseparated by using an energy staggered configuration, under illumination.\nFollowing this model, the green light of plants can be seen as related to the\nspent energy for charges separation.

The method, based on\nNitroxide-Mediated Polymerization (NMP), consists to bind covalently the\nalkoxyamine, which acts as initiator controller agent, at the silica\nnanoparticles surface in two steps. The first step is a reaction between the\naminopropylsilane and the silica particles in order to functionalize the\nparticles surface with amino group. In a second step, the\ninitiating-controlling alkoxyamine moiety is introduced via an over grafting\nreaction between the amino group and the N-hydroxysuccinimide based MAMA-SG1\nactivated ester. To simplify both their chemical transformation and the\npolymerization step, the native silica particles, initially dispersed in water,\nhave been transferred in an organic solvent, the dimethylacetamide, which is\nalso a good solvent for the polystyrene. The synthesis parameters have been\noptimized for grafting density, conversion rates, and synthesis reproducibility\nwhile keeping the colloidal stability and to avoid any aggregation of silica\nparticles induced by the inter-particles interaction evolution during the\nsynthesis.

Then the particles have been studied using Small angle\nNeutron Scattering (SANS) coupled to neutron contrast variation method. To\noptimize the contrast conditions, both hydrogenated and deuterated monomers\nhave been used for the synthesis. A refined fitting analysis based on the\ncomparison on two models, a basic core-shell and the Gaussian Pedersen model,\nenables us to fit nicely the experimental data for both the hydrogenated and\ndeuterated grafted case. Differences are seen between grafting of normal or\ndeuterated chains which can be due to monomer reactivity or to neutron contrast\neffect variations.

Lysozyme is a\nglobular protein and pectin a natural anionic semiflexible polysaccharide with\na degree of methylation (DM) 0, 43 and 74. For our experimental conditions\n(buffer ionic strength I = 2.5 10-2 mol/L and pH between 3 and 7), the\nelectrostatic charge of lysozyme is always positive (from 8 to 17 depending on\npH). The pectin charge per elementary chain segment is negative and can be\nvaried from almost zero to one through the change of DM and pH. The weight\nmolar ratio of lysozyme on pectin monomers is kept constant. The ratio of\nnegative charge content per volume to positive charge content per volume, -/+,\nis varied between 10 and 0.007. On a local scale, for all charged pectins, a\ncorrelation peak appears at 0.2 {\\AA}-1 due to proteins clustering inside the\ncomplexes. On a large scale, the complexes appear as formed of spherical\nglobules with a well defined radius of 10 to 50 nm, containing a few thousands\nproteins. The volume fraction Phi of organic matter within the globules derived\nfrom SANS absolute cross-sections is around 0.1. The protein stacking, which\noccurs inside the globules, is enhanced when pectin is more charged, due to pH\nor DM. The linear charge density of the pectin determines the size of the\nglobules for pectin chains of comparable molecular weights whether it is\ncontrolled by the pH or the DM. The radius of the globules varies between 10 nm\nand 50 nm. In conclusion the structure is driven by electrostatic interactions\nand not by hydrophobic interactions. The molecular weight also has a large\ninfluence on the structure of the complexes since long chains tend to form\nlarger globules. This maybe one reason why DM and pH are not completely\nequivalent in our system since DM 0 has a short mass, but this may not be the\nonly one. For very low pectin charge (-/+ = 0.07), globules do not appear and\nthe scattering signals a gel-like structure. We did not observe any\nbeads-on-a-string structure.\n"]}]
