In the multi-dimensional case, where each agent's preferences\nare given by different values for each of the available services, Briest et al.\n[Briest, Chawla, Kleinberg, and Weinberg '10] recently showed that the gap\nbetween the expected revenue obtained by an optimal randomized mechanism and an\noptimal deterministic mechanism can be unbounded even when a single agent is\noffered only 4 services.

An advantage of the CCM is that the Goldstone\nlinked-cluster theorem is obeyed at all levels of approximation and so it\nprovides results in the infinite lattice limit $N \\to \\infty$ from the outset.\nHowever, recent results have also shown that the CCM can provide exact\n(symmetry-breaking) results for the spin-half linear-chain $J_1$--$J_2$ at the\nMajumdar-Ghosh point $J_2/J_1=0.5$ by identifying special solutions of the CCM\nequations for the usual N\\'eel model state. Interestingly, the CCM provides\nexact (non-symmetry-breaking) results for systems in which small magnetic\nclusters become de-coupled from each other when the bonds connecting them tend\nto zero. These exact results involve the identification of \"special solutions\"\nof the CCM equations for the N\\'eel state. An example of this is given by a\nspin-half system with nearest-neighbour bonds for an underlying lattice\ncorresponding to the magnetic material CaV$_4$O$_9$ (CAVO) in which one of the\ntwo different types of bonds on the lattice tend to zero.
