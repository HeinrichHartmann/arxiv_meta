We prove that they are well-posed in a standard norm despite the\ndegeneracy. By wellposedness we mean a stable dependence of the solution on the\nright-hand side. A known approach of splitting the saddle point problem into\nseparate equations for the primary unknown and for the Lagrange multiplier is\nused. We revisit the traditional Ladygenskaya--Babu\\v{s}ka--Brezzi (LBB) or\ninf--sup condition as well as the standard coercivity condition, and analyze\nhow they are affected by the degeneracy of the corresponding bilinear forms. We\nsuggest and discuss generalized conditions that cover the degenerate case. The\nLBB or inf--sup condition is necessary and sufficient for wellposedness of the\nproblem with respect to the Lagrange multiplier under some assumptions. The\ngeneralized coercivity condition is necessary and sufficient for wellposedness\nof the problem with respect to the primary unknown under some other\nassumptions. We connect the generalized coercivity condition to the\npositiveness of the minimum gap of relevant subspaces, and propose several\nequivalent expressions for the minimum gap. Our results provide a foundation\nfor research on uniform wellposedness of mixed formulations of symmetric\nproblems with large jumps in coefficients in a standard norm, independent of\nthe jumps.

By weakening the effectiveness requirement of the convergence and\nclassifying the converging speeds of rational sequences, several interesting\nclasses of real numbers of weak computability have been introduced in\nliterature, e.g., in addition to the class of computable real numbers (EC), we\nhave the classes of semi-computable (SC), weakly computable (WC), divergence\nbounded computable (DBC) and computably approximable real numbers (CA). In this\npaper, we are interested in the weak computability of continuous real functions\nand try to introduce an analogous classification of weakly computable real\nfunctions. We present definitions of these functions by Turing machines as well\nas by sequences of rational polygons and prove these two definitions are not\nequivalent. Furthermore, we explore the properties of these functions, and\namong others, show their closure properties under arithmetic operations and\ncomposition.\n"]}]

In 1991 Ekert showed that cryptographic key\ncan be generated at a distance with help of entangled (correlated) quantum\nparticles. Recently Barrett, Hardy and Kent showed that the non-locality used\nby Ekert is itself a good resource of cryptographic key even beyond quantum\nmechanics. Their result paved the way to new generation of quantum\ncryptographic protocols - secure even if the devices are built by the very\neavesdropper. However, there is a question, which is fundamental from both\npractical and philosophical point of view: does Nature offer security on\noperational level based on the original concept behind quantum cryptography -\nthat information gain about one observable must cause disturbance to another,\nincompatible one?\n  Here we resolve this problem by using another striking feature of quantum\nworld - contextuality. It is a strong version of incompatibility manifested in\nthe famous Kochen-Specker paradox. The crucial concept is the use of a new\nclass of families of bipartite probability distributions . We show that if two\npersons share systems which locally exhibit the Kochen-Specker paradox and, in\naddition, exhibit perfect correlations, then they can extract secure key, even\nif they do not trust the quantum devices. This is the first operational\nprotocol that directly implements the fundamental feature of Nature: the\ninformation gain vs. disturbance trade-off.\n  For sake of proof we exhibit a new Bell's inequality which is interesting in\nitself. The security is proved not by exploiting strong violation of the\ninequality by quantum mechanics (as one usually proceeds), but rather by\narguing, that quantum mechanics cannot violate it too much.\n","Comment: 12 pages, RevTex, substantially revised version of e-print\n  arXive:1002.2410"]}]

M, in addition to the bare mass,\nincludes the total electromagnetic mass of the body.
