Efforts with the aim of\nextracting quantitative information about the bulk medium from the measured\nsuppression mainly focus on the extraction of an averaged transport coefficient\n<qhat> as a measure of the medium jet quenching power, with the underlying\nassumption that <qhat> is a meaningful quantity to make comparisons both among\ndifferent models and between models and data. In this note, the main\nuncertainties associated with the extraction of <qhat> from model fits to data\nare briefly reviewed before the notion of an average transport coefficient\nitself is investigated. It is shown in a case study that the choice of a\nmeaningful average is far from unique and that different well-motivated\ndefinitions of averages lead not only to differences in the outcome of about a\nfactor four, but also in a different change of <qhat> with collision\ncentrality. This casts some doubt on the idea that condensing the information\nabout jet-medium interactions into a single average parameter is a meaningful\nprocedure.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 1 figure"]}]

For $b_2^+(X)>1$, this contribution vanishes, but for\n$b_2^+=1$, the Donaldson invariants must be written as the sum of a u-plane\nintegral and an SW contribution. The u-plane integrals are quite intricate, but\ncan be analyzed in great detail and even calculated. By analyzing the u-plane\nintegrals, the relation of Donaldson theory to N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills\ntheory can be described much more fully, the relation of Donaldson invariants\nto SW theory can be generalized to four-manifolds not of simple type, and\ninteresting formulas can be obtained for the class numbers of imaginary\nquadratic fields.

By analyzing a recent proposal\nfor how to interpret quantum self-duality of RR fields, we show that the Dirac\nquantization formula for the RR p-forms, when properly formulated, receives\ncorrections that reflect curvature, lower brane charges, and an anomaly of\nD-brane world-volume fermions. The K-theory framework is important here,\nbecause the term involving the fermion anomaly cannot be naturally expressed in\nterms of cohomology and differential forms.\n","Comment: 35 pp"]}]
