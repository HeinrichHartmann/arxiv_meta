The object of this paper is to affirm the number-theoretical role of\nEuclid and the historical significance of Euclid's algorithm. It is known that\nalmost all elementary number-theoretical texts begin with Division algorithm.\nHowever, Euclid did not do like this. He began his number-theoretical work by\nintroducing his algorithm. We were quite surprised when we began to read the\n\\emph{Elements} for the first time. Nevertheless, one can prove that Euclid's\nalgorithm is essentially equivalent with the Bezout's equation and Division\nalgorithm. Therefore, Euclid has preliminarily established Theory of\nDivisibility and the greatest common divisor. This is the foundation of Number\nTheory. After more than 2000 years, by creatively introducing the notion of\ncongruence, Gauss published his \\emph{Disquisitiones Arithmeticae} in 1801 and\ndeveloped Number Theory as a systematic science. Note also that Euclid's\nalgorithm implies Euclid's first theorem (which is the heart of `the uniqueness\npart' of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic) and Euclid's second theorem\n(which states that there are infinitely many primes). Thus, in the nature of\nthings, Euclid's algorithm is the most important number-theoretical work of\nEuclid. For this reason, we further summarize briefly the influence of Euclid's\nalgorithm. Knuth said `we might call Euclid's method the granddaddy of all\nalgorithms'. Based on our discussion and analysis, it leads to the conclusion\nEuclid's algorithm is the greatest number-theoretical achievement of the\nEuclidean age.\n","Comment: 32 pages; We give a detailed revision"]}]

No\nHiggs field enters into the perturbative spectrum. The local functional\nequation (LFE), encoding the invariance of the SU(2) Haar measure under local\nleft SU(2) transformations, the Slavnov-Taylor identity, required in order to\nfulfill physical unitarity, and the Landau gauge equation hold in the\nnonlinearly realized theory. The quantization is performed in the Landau gauge\nfor the sake of simplicity and elegance. The constraints on the admissible\ninteractions arising from the Weak Power-Counting (WPC) are discussed. The same\nsymmetric pattern of the couplings as in the Standard Model is shown to arise,\nas a consequence of the defining functional identities and the WPC. However,\ntwo independent mass invariants in the vector meson sector are possible, i.e.\nno tree-level Weinberg relation holds between the Z and W mass. Majorana\nneutrino masses can be implemented in the nonlinearly realized Electroweak\nModel in a way compatible with the WPC and all the symmetries of the theory.\n","Comment: 6 pages, contributed to RADCOR2009.

The model introduced in this theory has existence\nbefore time zero so that it is not necessary to interpret it as of big-bang\norigin. The location of the Cosmic Microwave Background, within the theoretical\nstructure gives a closing of the fundamentals of the model in terms of the\ndefinitions of Temperature, Entropy and other Thermodynamic aspects. Thus\nopening up a research tool in cosmology in exact agreement with experiment that\ncan compete with the so-called Standard Big Bang Model as a\nmathematical-physical description of our universe based rigorously on\nEinstein's general relativity. It is suggested that the singularity at time\nzero involves a population inversion in the statistical mechanics sense and so\njustifies the use of negative temperature for the CMB at negative times. This\nalso has the satisfactory consequence that the Universe's evolution involves\nentropy steadily increasing over all time from minus infinity through the\nsingularity to plus infinity.An appendix with its own abstract contains an\nalternative simple classical physics derivation of this model and an extended\ndiscussion about how it can be used in the astrophysical context of galactic\nmotions.
