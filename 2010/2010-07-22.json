The PNR is assumed to be a ferroelectric\nsphere embedded in the host isotropic medium. The Lagrangian parameters are\ntaken to be the same inside and outside the PNR, with exception of the\nsoft-mode gap temperature dependence. The interaction of the Transverse (TO)\nwith the longitudinal (LO) optic modes is taken into account but the latter is\nfound to be important only at the surface of the PNR. Elementary excitations of\nthe system are found to be of two types - Vortex (V) and Quasi Polar (QP). V\nexcitations correspond to closed polarization lines or closed TO displacements\nwhile QP excitations contain open TO polarization lines, with an electric\ndipole if the net angular momentum j=1. LO waves are virtually excited only in\nthe thin layer near the PNR surface and can be excluded from the boundary\nconditions without any consequence. The final boundary conditions include only\nV and QP TO wave amplitudes. Dynamical equations are solved and a phase diagram\nis predicted. The phase transition temperature is found to be lower for Vortex\nthan for QP excitations. Therefore, the QP condensation (local phase\ntransition) occurs before the Vortex one upon cooling. TO scattering by the PNR\nreveals strong long-wave resonances that can be shown to result from shallow\nlocalized and quasi-localized states and may be essential to understanding the\nwaterfall observed in TO studies by inelastic neutron scattering.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 13 figures, 1 table"]}]

For finite $n$, if the transmitters can acquire channel\nstate information (CSI) and if all channel gains are bounded away from zero and\ninfinity, the seminal results on interference alignment establish that for any\n$K$ {\\em arbitrary} active pairs the total number of spatial degrees of freedom\nper orthogonal time and frequency domain is $\\frac{K}{2}$.
