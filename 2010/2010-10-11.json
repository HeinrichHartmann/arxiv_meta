This\nmodel suffers two deficiencies: (a) it does not account for experimental\nentropy differences of 2% among elemental liquids, and (b) it implies a value\nof zero for the transit contribution to internal energy. The purpose of this\npaper is to correct these deficiencies. To this end, the V-T equation for\nentropy is fitted to an overall accuracy of 0.1% to the available experimental\nhigh temperature entropy data for elemental liquids. The theory contains two\nnuclear motion contributions: (a) the dominant vibrational contribution\nS_{vib}(T/\\theta_0), where T is temperature and \\theta_0 is the vibrational\ncharacteristic temperature, and (b) the transit contribution\nS_{tr}(T/\\theta_{tr}), where \\theta_{tr} is a scaling temperature for each\nliquid. The appearance of a common functional form of S_{tr} for all the\nliquids studied is a property of the experimental data, when analyzed via the\nV-T formula. The resulting S_{tr} implies the correct transit contribution to\ninternal energy. The theoretical entropy of melting is derived, in a single\nformula applying to normal and anomalous melting alike.

By approximating\navalanches (cascades) as a multi-type branching process and using a\ngeneralization of Lagrange's expansion to multiple variables, we calculate the\ndistribution of avalanche sizes within each network. Due to coupling, large\navalanches in the individual networks are mitigated--in contrast to the\nconclusion for a simpler model [36]. Yet when compared to uncoupled networks,\ninterdependent networks more frequently suffer avalanches that are large in\nboth networks. Thus sparse connections between networks stabilize them\nindividually but destabilize them jointly, as coupling introduces reservoirs\nfor extra load yet also inflicts new stresses. These results suggest that in\npractice, to greedily mitigate large avalanches in one network, add connections\nbetween networks; conversely, to mitigate avalanches that are large in both\nnetworks, remove connections between networks. We also show that when only one\nnetwork receives load, the largest avalanches in the second network increase in\nsize and in frequency, an effect that is amplified with increased coupling\nbetween networks and with increased disparity in total capacity.

As the\nexpected duration and frequency of the gaps are currently unknown, we have\ndecided to focus on gaps of approximately one hour, occurring either once per\nday or once per week. We also study the case where, as well as the expected\nperiodic gaps, we have a data drop-out of one continuous week. Our results show\nthat for for galactic binaries, a gap of once per week introduces a bias of\nbetween 0.5% and 1% in the estimation of parameters, for the most important\nparameters such as the sky position, amplitude and frequency. This number rises\nto between 3% and 7% for the case of one gap a day, and to between 4% and 9%\nwhen we have one gap a day and a spurious gap of a week.

I also sift\nthrough the many meanings that have been attached to decohering histories, with\nan emphasis on the most basic one: Decoherence of appropriate histories is\nneeded to establish that quantum mechanics has the correct classical limit.\nThen I will describe efforts to find physical mechanisms that do this. Since\nmost work has focused on density matrix versions of decoherence, I'll consider\nthe relation between the two formulations, which historically has not been\nstraightforward.
