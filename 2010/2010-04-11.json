A\nmodified four generation QCD Standard Model Lagrangian is utilized per SM4. A\nfour generation neutrino mass mixing MNS Matrix, (VMNS) is estimated utilizing\na Unitary (to Order (Lambda**k), k = 1, 2, 3, 4, etc) 4 x 4 Bimaximal Matrix,\nVBIMAX. The Unitary VBIMAX is based on a weighted 3 x 3 VBIMAX scheme and is\nstudied in conjunction with the postulated four generation VCKM complex Unitary\nMatrix. A single parameter has been utilized in our analysis along with three\ncomplex DELTA(i,j) phases. A four generation Wolfenstein Parameterization of\nVCKM is deduced which is valid for order Lambda**3. Experimental implications\nof the model are discussed. The issues of Baryogenesis in the context of\nLeptogenesis associated with MNS Matrix neutrino mixing and Baryogenesis\nassociated with CKM Matrix quark mixing are discussed. These issues are studied\nin the context of the postulated complex four generation CKM Matrix and\nresulting complex MNS Matrix, predicted CP violating parameters, and a Fourth\nGeneration Neutrino mass bound of equal to or greater than 50 GeV. Our analysis\nis valid to and includes order Lambda**3 terms. Our work is a mathematical\nanalysis of the consequences of such model.
