Phantom experiments indicated that CBCT\nimages can be successfully reconstructed with our algorithm under as low as 0.1\nmAs/projection level.

We establish observationally\nmotivated constraints on the mass and radii of these haloes using a variety of\nindependent arguments. First, the observed dispersion measure of pulsars in the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud allows us to constrain the hot halo around the Milky\nWay: if it obeys the standard NFW profile, it must contain less than 4-5% of\nthe missing baryons from the Galaxy. This is similar to other upper limits on\nthe Galactic hot halo, such as the soft X-ray background and the pressure\naround high velocity clouds. Second, we note that the X-ray surface brightness\nof hot haloes with NFW profiles around large isolated galaxies is high enough\nthat such emission should be observed, unless their haloes contain less than\n10-25% of their missing baryons. Third, we place constraints on the column\ndensity of hot haloes using nondetections of OVII absorption along AGN\nsightlines: in general they must contain less than 70% of the missing baryons\nor extend to no more than 40 kpc. Flattening the density profile of galactic\nhot haloes weakens the surface brightness constraint so that a typical L$_*$\ngalaxy may hold half its missing baryons in its halo, but the OVII constraint\nremains unchanged, and around the Milky Way a flattened profile may only hold\n$6-13%$ of the missing baryons from the Galaxy ($2-4 \\times 10^{10}\nM_{\\odot}$). We also show that AGN and supernovae at low to moderate redshift -\nthe theoretical sources of winds responsible for driving out the missing\nbaryons - do not produce the expected correlations with the baryonic\nTully-Fisher relationship and so are insufficient to explain the missing\nbaryons from galaxies. We conclude that most of missing baryons from galaxies\ndo not lie in hot haloes around the galaxies, and that the missing baryons\nnever fell into the potential wells of protogalaxies in the first place. They\nmay have been expelled from the galaxies as part of the process of galaxy\nformation.\n","Comment: accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal"]}]

In most of them, the network is composed of a significant number of\nnodes deployed in an extensive area in which not all nodes are directly\nconnected. Then, the data exchange is supported by multihop communications.\nRouting protocols are in charge of discovering and maintaining the routes in\nthe network. However, the correctness of a particular routing protocol mainly\ndepends on the capabilities of the nodes and on the application requirements.\nThis paper presents a dynamic discover routing method for communication between\nsensor nodes and a base station in WSN. This method tolerates failures of\narbitrary individual nodes in the network (node failure) or a small part of the\nnetwork (area failure). Each node in the network does only local routing\npreservation, needs to record only its neighbor nodes' information, and incurs\nno extra routing overhead during failure free periods. It dynamically discovers\nnew routes when an intermediate node or a small part of the network in the path\nfrom a sensor node to a base station fails. In our planned method, every node\ndecides its path based only on local information, such as its parent node and\nneighbor nodes' routing information. So, it is possible to form a loop in the\nrouting path. We believe that the loop problem in sensor network routing is not\nas serious as that in the Internet routing or traditional mobile ad-hoc\nrouting. We are trying to find all possible loops and eliminate the loops as\nfar as possible in WSN.\n","Comment: IEEE Publication format, International Journal of Computer Science\n  and Information Security, IJCSIS, Vol. 7 No. 3, March 2010, USA.

Clustering has been dynamically applied to a variety of\ntasks in the field of Information Retrieval (IR). Clustering has become one of\nthe most active area of research and the development. Clustering attempts to\ndiscover the set of consequential groups where those within each group are more\nclosely related to one another than the others assigned to different groups.\nThe resultant clusters can provide a structure for organizing large bodies of\ntext for efficient browsing and searching. There exists a wide variety of\nclustering algorithms that has been intensively studied in the clustering\nproblem. Among the algorithms that remain the most common and effectual, the\niterative optimization clustering algorithms have been demonstrated reasonable\nperformance for clustering, e.g. the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm\nand its variants, and the well known k-means algorithm. This paper presents an\nanalysis on how partition method clustering techniques - EM, K -means and K*\nMeans algorithm work on heartspect dataset with below mentioned features -\nPurity, Entropy, CPU time, Cluster wise analysis, Mean value analysis and inter\ncluster distance. Thus the paper finally provides the experimental results of\ndatasets for five clusters to strengthen the results that the quality of the\nbehavior in clusters in EM algorithm is far better than k-means algorithm and\nk*means algorithm.\n","Comment: IEEE Publication format, ISSN 1947 5500,\n  http://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/"]}]

Generalizing a\nresult of Schwartz, any quasi-isometric image of a non-relatively hyperbolic\nspace in a relatively hyperbolic space is contained in a bounded neighborhood\nof a single peripheral subgroup. This implies that a group being relatively\nhyperbolic with nonrelatively hyperbolic peripheral subgroups is a\nquasi-isometry invariant. As an application, Artin groups are relatively\nhyperbolic if and only if freely decomposable.\n  We also introduce a new quasi-isometry invariant of metric spaces called\nmetrically thick, which is sufficient for a metric space to be nonhyperbolic\nrelative to any nontrivial collection of subsets. Thick finitely generated\ngroups include: mapping class groups of most surfaces; outer automorphism\ngroups of most free groups; certain Artin groups; and others. Nonuniform\nlattices in higher rank semisimple Lie groups are thick and hence nonrelatively\nhyperbolic, in contrast with rank one which provided the motivating examples of\nrelatively hyperbolic groups. Mapping class groups are the first examples of\nnonrelatively hyperbolic groups having cut points in any asymptotic cone,\nresolving several questions of Drutu and Sapir about the structure of\nrelatively hyperbolic groups.
