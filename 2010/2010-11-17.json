It is based on an existing\nphase-field formulation of the bulk free energy and incorporates two crucial\neffects: (i) anisotropic ionic mobility in the crystal and (ii) surface\nreactions governing the flux of ions across the electrode/electrolyte\ninterface, depending on the local free energy difference. Although the phase\nboundary can form a classical diffusive \"shrinking core\" when the dynamics is\nbulk-transport-limited, the theory also predicts a new regime of\nsurface-reaction-limited (SRL) dynamics, where the phase boundary extends from\nsurface to surface along planes of fast ionic diffusion, consistent with recent\nexperiments on LiFePO4. In the SRL regime, the theory produces a fundamentally\nnew equation for phase transformation dynamics, which admits traveling-wave\nsolutions. Rather than forming a shrinking core of untransformed material, the\nphase boundary advances by filling (or emptying) successive channels of fast\ndiffusion in the crystal. By considering the random nucleation of SRL\nphase-transformation waves, the theory predicts a very different picture of\ncharge/discharge dynamics from the classical diffusion-limited model, which\ncould affect the interpretation of experimental data for LiFePO4.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 10 figures"]}]

We tested the algorithm through realistic\nmock galaxy catalogs, revealing that the detections are 100% complete and 80%\npure for clusters up to z <1.2 and richer than \\Lambda > 25 (Abell Richness >\n0). We applied the algorithm to the CFHTLS Archive Research Survey (CARS) data,\nrecovering similar detections as previously published using the same data plus\nadditional clusters that are very probably real. We also applied this algorithm\nto the Deep Lens Survey (DLS), obtaining the first sample of optical-selected\ngalaxy in this survey.

These measurements confirmed that OsB_2 becomes a\nbulk superconductor below T_ c = 2.1 K. Our results indicate that OsB_2 is a\nmoderate-coupling Type-II superconductor with an electron-phonon coupling\nconstant \\lambda_{ep} \\approx 0.4 to 0.5, a small Ginzburg-Landau parameter\n\\kappa \\sim 1 to 2 and an upper critical magnetic field H_{c2}(0.5 K) \\sim 420\nOe for an unannealed sample and H_{c2}(1 K) \\sim 330 Oe for an annealed sample.\nThe temperature dependence of the superfluid density n_{s}(T) for the\nunannealed sample is consistent with an s-wave superconductor with a slightly\nenhanced zero temperature gap \\Delta(0) = 1.9 k_{B}T_c and a zero temperature\nLondon penetration depth \\lambda(0) = 0.38(2) \\mu m. The n_{s}(T) data for the\nannealed sample shows deviations from the predictions of the single-band s-wave\nBCS model. The magnetic, transport and thermal properties in the normal state\nof isostructural and isoelectronic RuB_2, which is reported to become\nsuperconducting below 1.6 K, are also reported.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 23 figures, 1 table; v2: New data and analysis on an\n  annealed sample of OsB2"]}]
