In this work,\nwe present our first-principles studies of the energy bands associated with\nvarious monovalent (Na, K, and Ag) and trivalent (Sb and Bi) impurities and\nimpurity clusters in PbTe, SnTe, and GeTe using supercell models. We find that\nmonovalent and trivalent impurity atoms tend to come close to one another and\nform impurity-rich clusters, and the electronic structure of the host materials\nis strongly perturbed by the impurities. There are impurity-induced bands\nassociated with the trivalent impurities that split off from the\nconduction-band bottom with large shifts towards the valence-band top. This is\ndue to the interaction between the $p$ states of the trivalent impurity cation\nand the divalent anion which tends to drive the systems towards metallicity.\nThe introduction of monovalent impurities (in the presence of trivalent\nimpurities) significantly reduces (in PbTe and GeTe) or slightly enhances (in\nSnTe) the effect of the trivalent impurities. One, therefore, can tailor the\nband gap and band structure near the band gap (hence transport properties) by\nchoosing the type of impurity and its concentration or tuning the\nmonovalent/trivalent ratio.

Here, we describe the relative, coordinated role of wet,\nmixed, and dry major mergers in driving this assembly. Accordingly to\nobservations, the model predicts that: 1) wet major mergers have controlled the\nmETGs buildup since z~1, although dry and mixed mergers have also contributed\nsignificantly to it; 2) the bulk of this assembly takes place during the ~1.4\nGyr time-period elapsed at 0.7<z<1, being nearly frozen at z<~0.7; 3) this\nfrostbite can be explained just accounting for the observational decrease of\nthe major merger fraction since z~0.7, implying that major mergers (and, in\nparticular, dry events) have contributed negligibly to the mETGs assembly\nduring the last ~6.3 Gyr; and 4) major mergers are responsible for doubling the\nstellar mass at the massive-end of the red sequence since z~1.
