First, in estimating the parameters of some model for\nthe data, the resulting posterior distribution may be multimodal or exhibit\npronounced (curving) degeneracies, which can cause problems for traditional\nMCMC sampling methods. Second, in selecting between a set of competing models,\ncalculation of the Bayesian evidence for each model is computationally\nexpensive. The nested sampling method introduced by Skilling (2004), has\ngreatly reduced the computational expense of calculating evidences and also\nproduces posterior inferences as a by-product. This method has been applied\nsuccessfully in cosmological applications by Mukherjee et al. (2006), but their\nimplementation was efficient only for unimodal distributions without pronounced\ndegeneracies. Shaw et al. (2007), recently introduced a clustered nested\nsampling method which is significantly more efficient in sampling from\nmultimodal posteriors and also determines the expectation and variance of the\nfinal evidence from a single run of the algorithm, hence providing a further\nincrease in efficiency. In this paper, we build on the work of Shaw et al. and\npresent three new methods for sampling and evidence evaluation from\ndistributions that may contain multiple modes and significant degeneracies; we\nalso present an even more efficient technique for estimating the uncertainty on\nthe evaluated evidence. These methods lead to a further substantial improvement\nin sampling efficiency and robustness, and are applied to toy problems to\ndemonstrate the accuracy and economy of the evidence calculation and parameter\nestimation. Finally, we discuss the use of these methods in performing Bayesian\nobject detection in astronomical datasets.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 11 figures, submitted to MNRAS, some major additions to the\n  previous version in response to the referee's comments"]}]

All this changes when the funds are\nallowed to leverage, i.e. borrow from a bank, to purchase more assets than\ntheir wealth would otherwise permit. During good times competition drives\ninvestors to funds that use more leverage, because they have higher profits. As\nleverage increases price fluctuations become heavy tailed and display clustered\nvolatility, similar to what is observed in real markets. Previous explanations\nof fat tails and clustered volatility depended on \"irrational behavior\", such\nas trend following. Here instead this comes from the fact that leverage limits\ncause funds to sell into a falling market: A prudent bank makes itself locally\nsafer by putting a limit to leverage, so when a fund exceeds its leverage\nlimit, it must partially repay its loan by selling the asset. Unfortunately\nthis sometimes happens to all the funds simultaneously when the price is\nalready falling. The resulting nonlinear feedback amplifies large downward\nprice movements. At the extreme this causes crashes, but the effect is seen at\nevery time scale, producing a power law of price disturbances.

Tribologists can therefore get valuable input and\ninspiration from living systems. The aim of biomimetics is knowledge transfer\nfrom biology to technology and successful biomimetics in tribology needs\ncollaboration between biologists and tribologists.

Here, a review is given of the\nevidence that supports the existence of jets from accreting stellar-mass black\nholes, from observations made at optical and infrared wavelengths. In\nparticular it is found that on occasion, jets can dominate the emission of\nthese systems at these wavelengths.
