The gapped B is the weak pairing phase described by\neither the Moore-Read Pfaffian state of the spinless fermions or anti-Pfaffian\nstate of holes depending on the sign of the next nearest neighbor hopping\namplitude.

For star-forming galaxies, M*-SFR is observed to be fairly tight with\na slope close to unity from z~0-2. Simulations of galaxy formation reproduce\nthese trends owing to the generic dominance of smooth and steady cold accretion\nin these systems. In contrast, the amplitude of the M*-SFR relation evolves\nmarkedly differently than in models. Stated in terms of a star formation\nactivity parameter alpha=(M*/SFR)/(t_H-1 Gyr), models predict a constant\nalpha~1 out to redshifts z=4+, while the observed M*-SFR relation indicates\nthat alpha increases by X3 from z~2 until today. The low alpha at high-z not\nonly conflicts with models, but is also difficult to reconcile with other\nobservations of high-z galaxies. Systematic biases could significantly affect\nmeasurements of M* and SFR, but detailed considerations suggest that none are\nobvious candidates to reconcile the discrepancy. A speculative solution is\nconsidered in which the stellar initial mass function (IMF) evolves towards\nmore high-mass star formation at earlier epochs. Following Larson, a model is\ninvestigated in which the characteristic mass Mhat where the IMF turns over\nincreases with redshift. The observed and predicted M*-SFR evolution may be\nbrought into agreement if Mhat=0.5(1+z)^2 Mo out to z~2. Such evolution broadly\nmatches recent observations of cosmic stellar mass growth, and the resulting\nz=0 cumulative IMF is similar to the paunchy IMF favored by Fardal et al to\nreconcile the observed cosmic star formation history with present-day fossil\nlight measures.

Phrasing f_NL inference in a Bayesian framework\ntakes advantage of existing techniques to account for instrumental effects and\nforeground contamination in CMB data and takes into account uncertainties in\nthe cosmological parameters in an unambiguous way.\n  Methods: We derive closed form expressions for the joint posterior of f_NL\nand the reconstructed underlying curvature perturbation, Phi, and deduce the\nconditional probability densities for f_NL and Phi. Completing the inference\nproblem amounts to finding the marginal density for f_NL. For realistic data\nsets the necessary integrations are intractable. We propose an exact\nHamiltonian sampling algorithm to generate correlated samples from the f_NL\nposterior. For sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratios, we can exploit the\nassumption of weak non-Gaussianity to find a direct Monte Carlo technique to\ngenerate independent samples from the posterior distribution for f_NL. We\nillustrate our approach using a simplified toy model of CMB data for the simple\ncase of a 1-D sky.\n  Results: When applied to our toy problem, we find that, in the limit of high\nsignal-to-noise, the sampling efficiency of the approximate algorithm\noutperforms that of Hamiltonian sampling by two orders of magnitude.

Here we report cavity cooling with a crystalline\nsemiconductor membrane via a new mechanism, in which the cooling force arises\nfrom the interaction between the photo-induced electron-hole pairs and the\nmechanical modes through the deformation potential coupling. The optoelectronic\nmechanism is so efficient as to cool a mode down to 4 K from room temperature\nwith just 50 uW of light and a cavity with a finesse of 10 consisting of a\nstandard mirror and the sub-wavelength-thick semiconductor membrane itself.
