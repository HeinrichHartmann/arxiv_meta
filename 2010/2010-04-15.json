This\ncomplements a previous study using pp -> Z Z' -> l+ l- X X*. Only the Z' mass\nand two effective charges are needed to describe this process. If the Z' decays\ninvisibly only to Standard Model neutrinos, then these charges are predicted by\nobservation of the Z' through the Drell-Yan process, allowing discrimination\nbetween Z' decays to SM neutrinos and invisible decays to new states. We\ncarefully discuss all backgrounds and systematic errors that affect this\nsearch. We find that hidden sector decays of a 1 TeV Z' can be observed at 5\nsigma significance with 50 fb^{-1} at the LHC. Observation of a 1.5 TeV state\nrequires super-LHC statistics of 1 ab^{-1}.

Here, we extend the previous results to\ninhomogeneous situations, in particular to the three-dimensional interface\ngeometry of two joint semi-infinite media. The sum rules derived for the\ncharge-charge density correlations represent a generalization of the previous\nones, related to the interface dipole moment and to the long-ranged tail of the\nsurface charge density correlation function along the interface of a conductor\nin contact with an inert (not fluctuating) dielectric wall, to two fluctuating\nsemi-infinite media of any kind. The charge-current and current-current sum\nrules obtained here are, to our knowledge, new. The current-current sum rules\nindicate a breaking of the directional invariance of the diagonal\ncurrent-current correlations by the interface. The sum rules are expressed\nexplicitly in the classical high-temperature limit (the static case) and for\nthe jellium model (the time-dependent case).\n","Comment: 23 pages, 1 figure"]}]

Although the proton intensity was very low, with only one pilot\nbunch per beam, and no systematic attempt was made to optimize the collision\noptics, all LHC experiments reported a number of collision candidates. In the\nALICE experiment, the collision region was centred very well in both the\nlongitudinal and transverse directions and 284 events were recorded in\ncoincidence with the two passing proton bunches. The events were immediately\nreconstructed and analyzed both online and offline. We have used these events\nto measure the pseudorapidity density of charged primary particles in the\ncentral region. In the range |eta| < 0.5, we obtain dNch/deta = 3.10 +- 0.13\n(stat.) +- 0.22 (syst.) for all inelastic interactions, and dNch/deta = 3.51 +-\n0.15 (stat.) +- 0.25 (syst.) for non-single diffractive interactions.

No secret is revealed with fewer than k\nshares. The alignment of the transparencies is important to the visual quality\nof the reconstructed secret image. In VSS scheme, each pixel of the original\nsecret image is expanded to m sub-pixels in a share image. If a share image is\nprinted on paper with the same size as the original secret image, the alignment\nor the registration of the sub-pixels, which is only m times smaller than that\nin the original secret, could be troublesome. Liu et al. [4] has noticed this\nalignment problem and observed that some information of the secret image may\nstill be revealed even when the shares are not precisely registered in the\nhorizontal direction. Yang et al. [9] introduced a general approach to\nconstruct a misalignment tolerant (k, n)-VSS scheme using big and small blocks\nfor the situation where the original secret image has a certain degree of\nredundancy in shape accuracy. In this paper, we propose a (2, n)-VSS scheme\nthat allows a relative shift between the shares in the horizontal direction and\nvertical direction. When the shares are perfectly aligned, the contrast of the\nreconstructed image is equal to that of traditional VSS shceme. When there is a\nshift, average contrast in the reconstructed image is higher than that of the\ntraditional VSS scheme, and the scheme can still work in the cases where very\nlittle shape redundancy presents in the image. The trade-off is that our method\ninvolves a larger pixel expansion.

Unfortunately, there\nis no algorithm capable of learning the complete class of deterministic regular\nexpressions from positive examples only, as we will show. The regular\nexpressions occurring in practical DTDs and XSDs, however, are such that every\nalphabet symbol occurs only a small number of times. As such, in practice it\nsuffices to learn the subclass of deterministic regular expressions in which\neach alphabet symbol occurs at most k times, for some small k. We refer to such\nexpressions as k-occurrence regular expressions (k-OREs for short). Motivated\nby this observation, we provide a probabilistic algorithm that learns k-OREs\nfor increasing values of k, and selects the deterministic one that best\ndescribes the sample based on a Minimum Description Length argument.

We compare this with omniscient coding, in which every node\nhas a global view of the network and all nodes can cooperate. Using Gaussian\nchannels as examples, we find that when the nodes transmit at low power, the\nrates achievable with two-hop myopic coding are as large as that under\nomniscient coding in a five-node multiple relay channel and close to that under\nomniscient coding in a six-node multiple relay channel. These results suggest\nthat we may do local coding and cooperation without compromising much on the\ntransmission rate.
