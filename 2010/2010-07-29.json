For programs P and Q, the goal is to determine the answer sets\nthat correspond to the revision of P by Q, denoted P * Q. A fundamental\nprinciple of classical (AGM) revision, and the one that guides the approach\nhere, is the success postulate. In AGM revision, this stipulates that A is in K\n* A. By analogy with the success postulate, for programs P and Q, this means\nthat the answer sets of Q will in some sense be contained in those of P * Q.\nThe essential idea is that for P * Q, a three-valued answer set for Q,\nconsisting of positive and negative literals, is first determined. The positive\nliterals constitute a regular answer set, while the negated literals make up a\nminimal set of naf literals required to produce the answer set from Q. These\nliterals are propagated to the program P, along with those rules of Q that are\nnot decided by these literals. The approach differs from work in update logic\nprograms in two main respects. First, we ensure that the revising logic program\nhas higher priority, and so we satisfy the success postulate; second, for the\npreference implicit in a revision P * Q, the program Q as a whole takes\nprecedence over P, unlike update logic programs, since answer sets of Q are\npropagated to P.

However, most islands that were expected to\nexhibit SET did not do so, and the reasons for the absence of observable SET\nare evaluated. The most likely reasons for the absence of SET are determined to\nbe a wide depletion region in the substrate and Schottky barrier lowering due\nto Fermi level pinning by surface states of the clean silicon near the islands.\nThe results establish that although the Schottky barrier can act as an\neffective tunnel junction in a DBTJ structure, the islands may be unreliable in\nfuture nanoelectronic devices.

Conducting\natomic force microscopy has been performed on these islands to characterize and\nmeasure their current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. Current-voltage curves\nwere analyzed using thermionic emission theory to obtain the Schottky barrier\nheights and ideality factors between the silicide islands and the silicon\nsubstrates. Current-voltage measurements were performed ex situ for samples\n(\"passivated surfaces\") where the silicon surface surrounding the islands was\npassivated with a native oxide. Other samples (\"clean surfaces\") remained in\nUHV while I-V curves were recorded. By comparing barrier heights and ideality\nfactors for islands on both surfaces, the effects of the non-passivated\nsurfaces on conduction were studied. The clean surface barrier heights were\nfound to be ~0.2 to 0.3 eV below barrier heights measured from similar islands\non passivated surfaces. The reduced Schottky barrier is mainly attributed to\nFermi level pinning by non-passivated surface states of the clean silicon\nsurface. However, the measured barrier heights of the clean surface islands are\nequivalent on both Si(111) and Si(100), suggesting that the non-passivated\nsurfaces are influenced by cobalt impurities. Furthermore, the barrier heights\nof islands on the clean surfaces are lower than due to Fermi level pinning\nalone and the additional barrier height lowering is primarily attributed to\nspreading resistance effects. Schottky barrier inhomogeneity may also cause\nadditional barrier height lowering and non-ideality in the contacts. The clean\nsurface barrier heights decreased and the ideality factors increased with\ndecreasing temperature, which is attributed to the temperature variation of the\nFermi level.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 6 figures"]}]

For instance, we show that $\\frac{2m+n}{3\\Delta+1} \\le\n\\gamma_o(\\Gamma)\\le \\frac{2n}{3}$ and $\\frac{2(m+n)}{3\\Delta+2}\n\\le\\gamma_{\\hat{o}}(\\Gamma)\\le \\frac{5n}{6}$, where $m$ denotes the size of\n$\\Gamma$ and $\\Delta$ its maximum degree (the last upper bound holds true for\nall $\\Gamma$ with minimum degree greatest or equal to two).\n"]}]
