The base flow is\ncharacterised by the cross flow Reynolds number, $R_{inj}$ and the\ndimensionless wall velocity, $k$. Squire's transformation may be applied to the\nlinear stability equations and we therefore consider 2D (spanwise-independent)\nperturbations. Corresponding to each dimensionless wall velocity, $k\\in[0,1]$,\ntwo ranges of $R_{inj}$ exist where unconditional stability is observed. In the\nlower range of $R_{inj}$, for modest $k$ we have a stabilisation of long\nwavelengths leading to a cut-off $R_{inj}$. This lower cut-off results from\nskewing of the velocity profile away from a Poiseuille profile, shifting of the\ncritical layers and the gradual decrease of energy production. Cross-flow\nstabilisation and Couette stabilisation appear to act via very similar\nmechanisms in this range, leading to the potential for robust compensatory\ndesign of flow stabilisation using either mechanism. As $R_{inj}$ is increased,\nwe see first destabilisation and then stabilisation at very large $R_{inj}$.\nThe instability is again a long wavelength mechanism. Analysis of the\neigenspectrum suggests the cause of instability is due to resonant interactions\nof Tollmien-Schlichting waves. A linear energy analysis reveals that in this\nrange the Reynolds stress becomes amplified, the critical layer is irrelevant\nand viscous dissipation is completely dominated by the energy\nproduction/negation, which approximately balances at criticality. The\nstabilisation at very large $R_{inj}$ appears to be due to decay in energy\nproduction, which diminishes like $R_{inj}^{-1}$.

The dissipative mechanical systems discussed in this paper are finite\ndimensional.This approach is based upon a proposition: for any nonconservative\nclassical mechanical system and any initial condition, there exists a\nconservative one; the two systems share one and only one common phase curve;\nthe Hamiltonian of the conservative system is the sum of the total energy of\nthe nonconservative system on the aforementioned phase curve and a constant\ndepending on the initial condition. Hence, this approach entails substituting\nan infinite number of conservative systems for a dissipative mechanical system\ncorresponding to varied initial conditions. Therefore, first we utilize the\ntime-centered difference scheme directly to solve the original system, after\nwhich we substitute the numerical solution for the analytical solution to\nconstruct a conservative force equal to the dissipative force on the phase\ncurve, such that we would obtain a substituting conservative system\nnumerically. Finally, we use the time-centered scheme to integrate the\nsubstituting system numerically. We will find an interesting fact that the\nlatter solution resulting from the substituting system is equivalent to that of\nthe former. Indeed, there are two transition matrices within time grid points:\nthe first one is unsymplectic and the second symplectic. In fact, the\ntime-centered scheme for dissipative systems can be thought of as an algorithm\nthat preserves the symplectic structure of the substituting conservative\nsystems. In addition, via numerical examples we find that the time-centered\nscheme preserves the total energy of dissipative systems.\n"]}]

Based on a proposition we put forward, we argue that\nintroducing a matter density field on a non-commutative background sets up a\nmechanism that deforms the field into two distinct fields, one residing\ndominantly on the lattice tops (hereafter, on-cell) and the other residing\ndominantly in the inter-lattice regions (hereafter, off-cell).

For example, not\nsurprisingly the on-cell (off-cell) fields manifest standard on-shell\n(off-shell) characteristics, respectively. Both the density and the net\nmass-energy are unchanged by the deformation mechanism. In our treatment the\nmass of a black hole defines its own size scale L of the interior region it\noccupies. Moreover, such a length is quantized, L=2N\\sqrt{\\theta}, in terms of\na minimum length scale \\sqrt{\\theta}. The approach has the advantage that there\nis no degeneracy in mass-confinement since, here, the black hole density is not\na function of the mass (as is the case in some recent treatments). The density\nis, instead a fixed quantity. As such, the approach puts an upper bound on\nblack hole density, making it a universal parameter. The picture that emerges\nis that a black hole defined on a non-commutative background is both\nnon-singular, holographic and quantized. Yet we also find, interestingly, that\nwhen taken over L the average value of the associated energy-stress tensor of\nthe fields satisfies all classical energy conditions of GR.\n","Comment: Expanded version of presentation made at 19th International\n  Conference of General Relativity and Gravitation.
