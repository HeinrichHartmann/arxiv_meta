We find that, with robust estimates of the\nmeasurement errors and realistic halo occupation distribution modeling, the\nmeasured clustering can be well fit within standard halo occupation models, in\ncontrast to previous results. However, in order to fit the strong break in\nw(theta) at theta=10 arcsec, nearly all satellite galaxies in the DRG\nluminosity range are required to be DRGs. Within this luminosity-threshold\nsample, the fraction of galaxies that are DRGs is ~44%, implying that the\nformation of DRGs is more efficient for satellite galaxies than for central\ngalaxies. Despite the evolved stellar populations contained within DRGs at\nz=2.3, 90% of satellite galaxies in the DRG luminosity range have been accreted\nwithin 500 Myr. Thus, satellite DRGs must have known they would become\nsatellites well before the time of their accretion. This implies that the\nformation of DRGs correlates with large-scale environment at fixed halo mass,\nalthough the large-scale bias of DRGs can be well fit without such assumptions.\nFurther data are required to resolve this issue. Using the observational\nestimate that ~30% of DRGs have no ongoing star formation, we infer a timescale\nfor star formation quenching for satellite galaxies of 450 Myr, although the\nuncertainty on this number is large. However, unless all non-star forming\nsatellite DRGs were quenched before accretion, the quenching timescale is\nsignificantly shorter than z~0 estimates. Down to the completeness limit of the\nQuadri et al sample, we find that the halo masses of central DRGs are ~50%\nhigher than non-DRGs in the same luminosity range, but at the highest halo\nmasses the central galaxies are DRGs only ~2/3 of the time.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 7 figues, submitted to ApJ"]}]

In this sense the theory is purely holographic. We show that this\ntheory is dual to Chern-Simons theory with an external source. We also point\nout that the holographic hypothesis must be supplemented by additional\nassumptions in order to take into account bulk topological degrees freedom,\nsince these are apriori invisible to local boundary fields.\n","Comment: LaTeX 10 pages, 1 figure using epsfig, typo in eqn.(15) corrected"]}]

How do we know? From theory or experiment? The\nhistory of this question is reviewed. Nonlinear generalizations of quantum\nmechanics have been proposed. They predict small but clear nonlinear effects,\nwhich very accurate experiments have not seen. Is there a reason in principle\nwhy nonlinearity is not found? Is it impossible? Does quantum dynamics have to\nbe linear? Attempts to prove this have not been decisive, because either their\nassumptions are not compelling or their arguments are not conclusive. The\nquestion has been left unsettled. There is a simple answer, based on a simple\nassumption. It was found in two steps separated by 44 years. They are steps\nback to simpler and more compelling assumptions. A proof of the assumptions of\nthe Wigner-Bargmann proof has been known since 1962. It assumes that the maps\nof density matrices in time are linear. For this step, it is also assumed that\ndensity matrices are mapped one-to-one onto density matrices. An alternative is\nto assume that pure states are mapped one-to-one onto pure states and that\nentropy does not decrease. In a step taken in 2006, it is proved that the maps\nof density matrices in time are linear. It is assumed, as in the earlier step,\nthat at each time the physical quantities and states are described by the usual\nlinear structures of quantum mechanics, so the question is only about how\nthings change in time. Beyond that, the proof assumes only that the dynamics\ndoes not depend on anything outside the system, but must allow the system to be\ndescribed as part of a larger system.\n","Comment: From talks, 15 pages"]}]
