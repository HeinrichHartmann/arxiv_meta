Alongside, we\nobtain the first strong hardness of approximation results for the Balanced\nSeparator and Minimum Linear Arrangement problems. Before, no such hardness was\nknown for these problems even assuming the Unique Games Conjecture.\n  These results not only establish the Small-Set Expansion Hypothesis as a\nnatural unifying hypothesis that implies the Unique Games Conjecture, all its\nconsequences and, in addition, hardness results for other problems like\nBalanced Separator and Minimum Linear Arrangement, but our results also show\nthat the Small-Set Expansion Hypothesis problem lies at the combinatorial heart\nof the Unique Games Conjecture.\n  The key technical ingredient is a new way of exploiting the structure of the\nUnique Games instances obtained from the Small-Set Expansion Hypothesis via\n(Raghavendra, Steurer, 2010). This additional structure allows us to modify\nstandard reductions in a way that essentially destroys their local-gadget\nnature. Using this modification, we can argue about the expansion in the graphs\nproduced by the reduction without relying on expansion properties of the\nunderlying Unique Games instance (which would be impossible for a local-gadget\nreduction).\n"]}]
