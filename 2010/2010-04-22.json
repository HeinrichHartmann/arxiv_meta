The frequency\nvariations of the building under moderate earthquakes are shown to be slight\n(~2%) and therefore ambient vibration frequencies are relevant over the elastic\ndomain of the building. The modal parameters extracted from ambient vibrations\nare then used to determine the 1D lumped-mass model in order to reproduce the\ninter-storey drift under weak earthquakes and to fix a 3D numerical model that\ncould be used for strong earthquakes.

The first step\ntowards understanding these networks is finding an adequate network model that\nclosely replicates their structure.

We find geometric random graphs, that model spatial\nrelationships between objects, to be the best-fitting model for RIGs.

Several observations of this asteroid have been so far\nperformed, but its surface composition and nature are still a matter of debate.\nFor long time Lutetia was supposed to have a metallic nature due to its high\nIRAS albedo. Later on it has been suggested to have a surface composition\nsimilar to primitive carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, while further\nobservations proposed a possible genetic link with more evolved enstatite\nchondrite meteorites. AIMS: In order to give an important contribution in\nsolving the conundrum of the nature of Lutetia, in November 2008 we performed\nvisible spectroscopic observations of this asteroid at the Telescopio Nazionale\nGalileo (TNG, La Palma, Spain). METHODS: Thirteen visible spectra have been\nacquired at different rotational phases. RESULTS: We confirm the presence of a\nnarrow spectral feature at about 0.47-0.48 micron already found by Lazzarin et\nal. (2009) on the spectra of Lutetia. We also find a spectral feature at about\n0.6 micron, detected by Lazzarin et al. (2004) on one of their Lutetia's\nspectra. More importantly, our spectra exhibit different spectral slopes\nbetween 0.6 and 0.75 micron and, in particular, we found that up to 20% of the\nLutetia surface could have flatter spectra. CONCLUSIONS: We detected a\nvariation of the spectral slopes at different rotational phases that could be\ninterpreted as possibly due to differences in the chemical/mineralogical\ncomposition, as well as to inhomogeneities of the structure of the Lutetia's\nsurface (e.g., the presence of craters or albedo spots) in the southern\nhemisphere.\n","Comment: 3 pages, 2 figures.

The main property we analyze is the\ntime-dependent density. We also study is the exchange-correlation potential of\nTDDFT, obtained via reverse engineering from the time-dependent density. Our\nsystems consist of small, strongly correlated clusters, described by a Hubbard\nHamiltonian within the Hartree-Fock, second Born, GW and T-matrix\napproximations. We compare the results from the KBE dynamics to those from\nexact numerical solutions. The outcome of our comparisons is that, among the\nmany-body schemes considered, the T-matrix approximation is overall superior at\nall electron densities. Such comparisons permit a general assessment of the\nwhole idea of applying MBPT, in the KBE sense, to finite systems. A striking\noutcome of our analysis is that when the system evolves under a strong external\nfield, the KBE develop a steady-state solution as a consequence of a\ncorrelation-induced damping. This damping is present both in isolated (finite)\nsystems, where it is purely artificial, as well as in clusters contacted to\n(infinite) macroscopic leads. To illustrate this point we present selected\nresults for a system coupled to contacts within the T-matrix and second Born\napproximation. The extensive characterization we performed indicates that this\nbehavior is present whenever approximate self energies, based upon infinite\npartial summations, are used. A second important result is that, for isolated\nclusters, the steady state reached is not unique but depends on how one\nswitches on the external field. This may also true for clusters connected to\nleads.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 15 figures"]}]

The\nstochastic recovery specification only models the first two moments of the spot\nrecovery rate as its higher moments have almost no contribution to the loss\ndistribution and CDO tranche pricing. Observing that only the joint\ndistribution of default indicators is needed to build the portfolio loss\ndistribution, we propose a generic class of default indicator copulas to model\nCDO tranches, which can be easily calibrated to index tranche prices across\nmultiple maturities. This correlation modelling framework has the unique\nadvantage that the joint distribution of default time and other dynamic\nproperties of the model can be changed separately from the loss distribution\nand tranche prices. After calibrating the model to index tranche prices,\nexisting top-down methods can be applied to the common factor process to\nconstruct very flexible systemic dynamics without changing the already\ncalibrated tranche prices. This modelling framework therefore combines the best\nfeatures of the bottom-up and top-down models: it is fully consistent with all\nthe single name market information and it admits very rich and flexible spread\ndynamics. Numerical results from a non-parametric implementation of this\nmodelling framework are also presented.
