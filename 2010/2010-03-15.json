I show that the prior information about\nany type of constituent (state, channel, or observable) allows us to\nreformulate the discrimination among finite number of alternatives as the\ndiscrimination among finite number of average constituents. Using this\nframework I solve several unambiguous tasks. I present a solution to optimal\nunambiguous comparison of two ensembles of unknown quantum states. I consider\ntwo cases: 1) The two unknown states are arbitrary pure states of qudits. 2)\nAlternatively, they are coherent states of single-mode optical fields. For this\ncase I propose simple and optimal experimental setup composed of beam-splitters\nand a photodetector. As a second tasks I consider an unambiguous identification\n(UI) of coherent states. In this task identical quantum systems are prepared in\ncoherent states and labeled as unknown and reference states, respectively. The\npromise is that one reference state is the same as the unknown state and the\ntask is to find out unambiguously which one it is. The particular choice of the\nreference states is unknown to us, and only the probability distribution\ndescribing this choice is known. In a general case when multiple copies of\nunknown and reference states are available I propose a scheme consisting of\nbeamsplitters and photodetectors that is optimal within linear optics. UI can\nbe considered as a search in a quantum database, whose elements are the\nreference states and the query is represented by the unknown state. This\nperspective motivated me to show that reference states can be recovered after\nthe measurement and might be used (with reduced success rate) in subsequent UI.\nMoreover, I analyze the influence of noise in preparation of coherent states on\nthe performance of the proposed setup. Another problem I address is the\nunambiguous comparison of a pair of unknown qudit unitary channels. I\ncharacterize all solutions and identify the optimal ones. I prove that in\noptimal experiments for comparison of unitary channels the entanglement is\nnecessary. The last task I studied is the unambiguous comparison of unknown\nnon-degenerate projective measurements. I distinguish between measurement\ndevices with apriori labeled and unlabeled outcomes. In both cases only the\ndifference of the measurements can be concluded unambiguously. For the labeled\ncase I derive the optimal strategy if each unknown measurement is used only\nonce. However, if the apparatuses are not labeled, then each measurement device\nmust be used (at least) twice. In particular, for qubit measurement apparatuses\nwith unlabeled outcomes I derive the optimal test state in the two-shots\nscenario.\n","Comment: 141 pages, based on PhD thesis"]}]

In this paper, another\nanti-dynamo theorem, called Cowling's theorem, which states that axisymmetric\nmagnetic fields cannot support dynamo action, is carefully tested against thick\ntubular and curved Riemannian untwisted flows, as well as thin flux tubes in\ndiffusive and diffusionless media. In the non-diffusive media the Cowling's\ntheorem is not violated in thin Riemann-flat untwisted flux tubes, where the\nFrenet curvature is negative. Nevertheless the diffusion action in the thin\nflux tube leads to a a dynamo action driven by poloidal flows as shown by Love\nand Gubbins (Geophysical Res.) in the context of geodynamos. Actually it is\nshown that a slow dynamo action is obtained. In this case the Frenet and\nRiemann curvature still vanishes. In the case of magnetic filaments in\ndiffusive media dynamo action is obtained when the Frenet scalar curvature is\nnegative. Since the Riemann curvature tensor can be expressed in terms of the\nFrenet curvature of the magnetic flux tube axis, this result can be analogous\nto a recent result obtained by Chicone, Latushkin and Smith, which states that\ngeodesic curvature in compact Riemannian manifolds can drive dynamo action in\nthe manifold. It is also shown that in absence of diffusion, magnetic energy\ndoes not grow but magnetic toroidal magnetic field can be generated by the\npoloidal field, what is called a plasma dynamo.\n"]}]
