The action for a mixture of ideal gases\nis the sum of the actions for the components, with an entropy that, in the\nabsence of gravity, is determined by the Gibbs-Dalton hypothesis. Chemical\nreactions such as hydrogen dissociation are studied, with results that include\nthe Saha equation and that are more complete than traditional treatments,\nespecially so when gravitational effects are included. A mixture of two ideal\ngases is a system with two degrees of freedom and consequently it exhibits two\nkinds of sound. In the presence of gravity the Gibbs-Dalton hypothesis is\nmodified to get results that agree with observation. The possibility of a\nparallel treatment of real gases is illustrated by an application to van der\nWaals gases.

AIMS: We investigate\nthe structure and stellar population of two large stellar condensations (knots\nA & B) along one of the faint optical \"jet-like\" tidal streams associated with\nthe spiral NGC 1097, with the goal of establishing their physical association\nwith the galaxy and their origin. METHODS: We use the VLT/FORS2 to get deep\nV-band imaging and low-resolution optical spectra of two knots along NGC 1097's\nnortheast \"dog-leg\" tidal stream. With this data, we explore their morphology\nand stellar populations. RESULTS: The FORS2 spectra show that the redshift of\nknot A (and perhaps of knot B) is consistent with that of NGC 1097. The FORS2\nphotometry shows that the two knots match very well the photometric scaling\nrelations of canonical dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph). From the spectral\nanalysis we find that knot A is mainly composed of stars near G-type, with no\nsigns of ongoing star formation. Comparing its spectrum to a library of\nGalactic GC spectra, we find that the stellar population of this dSph-like\nobject is most similar to intermediate to metal rich GCs. We find moreover,\nthat the tidal stream shows an \"S\" shaped inflection as well as a pronounced\nstellar overdensity at knot A's position. This suggests that knot A is being\ntidally stripped, and populates the stellar stream with its stars. CONCLUSIONS:\nWe have discovered that two knots along NGC 1097's northeast tidal stream share\nmost of their spectral and photometric properties with ordinary dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies (dSph). Moreover, we find strong indications that the\n\"dog-leg\" tidal stream arise from the tidal disruption of knot A. Since it has\nbeen demonstrated that tidally stripping dSph galaxies need to loose most of\ntheir dark matter before starting to loose stars, we suggest that knot A is at\npresent a CDM-poor object.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy &\n  Astrophysics"]}]

Due to changing\nof electron trajectories after collisions with interfaces new types of periodic\nmotion in the magnetic field and therefore new size and resonance phenomena in\nhigh frequency fields appear. In thin normal layers on the superconducting\nsubstrate, changing of trajectories is due to Andreev reflection and resonance\neffects, which do not exist in normal multilayers, films, and bulk\nmonocrystals, take place. In multilayers consisting of ferromagnetic and\nnonmagnetic metals, the internal magnetic field in ferromagnetic layers must be\ntaken into account, if the Larmor radius in this field is comparable with the\nlayer thickness. Because of the mutual diffusion of metals, the kinetic\ncoefficients of multilayers are changed in time. The investigation of this\nchanging may be used for determination of diffusion coefficient for the bulk\nand grain-boundary diffusion. The effects, which have been analyzed\ntheoretically in this review, can be used for the obtaining information on the\nelectron interaction with interfaces in conducting multilayers.\n","Comment: self-review, 94 pages, 21 figures"]}]

In particular, we study the ratcheting effect of\na globule formed at the \\textit{trans} side created by the translocated\nsegment, and how this ratchet drives the system towards faster translocation.\nUnlike in the case of unbiased or externally forced translocation where the\nmean first passage time $\\langle \\tau \\rangle $ is often characterized by\nalgebraic scaling as a function of the chain length $N$ with a single scaling\nexponent $\\alpha$, and the histogram of the mean first passage time\n$P(\\tau/\\langle\\tau \\rangle)$ exhibits scaling, we find that scaling is not\nwell obeyed.
