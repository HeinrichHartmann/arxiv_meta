The multi-loop\namplitude prescription for the minimal pure spinor superstring formulated in\nhep-th/0406055 involves the insertion of picture changing operators in the path\nintegral. These operators are BRST closed in a distributional sense and depend\non a number of constant tensors. One can trace the origin of these insertions\nto gauge fixing, so the amplitudes are formally independent of the constant\ntensors. We show however by explicit tree-level and one-loop computations that\nthe picture changing operators are not BRST closed inside correlators and the\namplitudes do depend on these constant tensors. This is due to the fact that\nthe gauge fixing condition implicit in the existing minimal amplitude\nprescription is singular and this can lead to Lorentz violation and\nnon-decoupling of BRST exact states. As discussed in hep-th/0406055, a\nmanifestly Lorentz invariant prescription can be obtained by integrating over\nthe constant tensors and in the sequel to this paper, it is shown that when one\nincludes these integrations unphysical states do decouple to all orders despite\nthe fact that the PCO's are not BRST closed inside correlators.\n","Comment: 77 pages (51 pages + appendices), added hyperrefs"]}]
