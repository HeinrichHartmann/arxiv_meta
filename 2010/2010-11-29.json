We\ncollect the data for 124 X-ray pulsars, which are mainly in high-mass X-ray\nbinary systems, and classify their pulse profiles according to the number of\nobserved peaks seen during one spin period, dividing them into two classes,\nsingle- and double-peaked.

Assuming a blackbody emission\npattern, it is possible to constrain the neutron star compactness if the\nmagnetic dipole has arbitrary inclinations to the pulsar rotational axis. More\nrealistic pencil-beam patterns predict that 79% of the pulsars are\ndouble-peaked independently of their compactness. The theoretical predictions\ncan be made consistent with the data if the magnetic dipole inclination to the\nrotational axis has an upper limit of 40+/-4 deg.

We then consider the nonequilibrium dynamics that result\nwhen such a precessing-vortex configuration is subjected to a static trap\nanisotropy which arrests its rotation, and observe novel coupled relaxation\ndynamics of the condensed and noncondensed components of the field. Finally, we\nconsider the nucleation of vortices in an initially zero-temperature\nquasi-two-dimensional condensate stirred by a rotating trap anisotropy. We\nquantify the emergence of a rotating thermal component of the field, which\ndrives the nucleation of vortices from condensate-surface oscillations, and\nstudy the relaxation and rotational equilibration of the initially turbulent\ncollection of vortices. We find that thermal fluctuations of the field prevent\nthe vortices from settling into a rigid crystalline lattice in this reduced\ndimensionality, and that true condensation in the field is completely destroyed\nby the disordered motion of vortices. We show, however, that the temporal\ncorrelations of the field distinguish the quasi-coherent vortex-liquid phase in\nthe trap centre from the truly thermal material in its periphery.\n","Comment: PhD thesis. 276 pages, 49 figures"]}]

We show that ambient electrons\nbecome magnetized even for weak magnetic fields (30 G); that is, their\ngyrofrequency becomes larger than the collision frequency while ion motions\ncontinue to be dominated by ion-neutral collisions. Under such conditions, ions\nare dragged by neutrals, and the magnetic field acts as if it is frozen-in to\nthe dynamics of the neutral gas. However, magnetized electrons drift under the\naction of the electric and magnetic fields induced in the reference frame of\nions moving with the neutral gas. We find that this relative motion of\nelectrons and ions results in the generation of quite intense electric\ncurrents. The dissipation of these currents leads to resistive electron heating\nand efficient gas ionization. Ionization by electron-neutral impact does not\nalter the dynamics of the heavy particles; thus, the gas turbulent motions\ncontinue even when the plasma becomes fully ionized, and resistive dissipation\ncontinues to heat electrons and ions. This heating process is so efficient that\nit can result in typical temperature increases with altitude as large as\n0.1-0.3 eV/km.

However, observations at\nsubmillimetre wavelengths are hampered by ``sky-noise'' which is caused by\nspatial and temporal fluctuations in the emissivity of the atmosphere above the\ntelescope. These variations occur in atmospheric cells that are larger than the\narray diameter, and so it is expected that the resultant noise will be\ncorrelated across the array and, possibly, at different wavelengths.\n  In this paper we describe our initial investigations into the presence of\nsky-noise for all the SCUBA observing modes, and explain our current technique\nfor removing it from the data.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 16 figures, Proc SPIE vol 3357"]}]

In classical test and verification one\ndevelops a test set separating a correct circuit from a circuit containing any\nconsidered fault. Classical faults are modelled at the logical level by fault\nmodels that act on classical states. The stuck fault model, thought of as a\nlead connected to a power rail or to a ground, is most typically considered. A\nclassical test set complete for the stuck fault model propagates both binary\nbasis states, 0 and 1, through all nodes in a network and is known to detect\nmany physical faults. A classical test set complete for the stuck fault model\nallows all circuit nodes to be completely tested and verifies the function of\nmany gates. It is natural to ask if one may adapt any of the known classical\nmethods to test quantum circuits. Of course, classical fault models do not\ncapture all the logical failures found in quantum circuits. The first obstacle\nfaced when using methods from classical test is developing a set of realistic\nquantum-logical fault models. Developing fault models to abstract the test\nproblem away from the device level motivated our study. Several results are\nestablished. First, we describe typical modes of failure present in the\nphysical design of quantum circuits. From this we develop fault models for\nquantum binary circuits that enable testing at the logical level. The\napplication of these fault models is shown by adapting the classical test set\ngeneration technique known as constructing a fault table to generate quantum\ntest sets. A test set developed using this method is shown to detect each of\nthe considered faults.\n","Comment: (almost) Forgotten rewrite from 2005"]}]
