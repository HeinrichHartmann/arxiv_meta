One crucial issue is the\nsuppression of Haldane's instanton on quantum critical point which drives the\nspinon deconfined. In this paper, by making use of the $\\phi$-mapping\ntopological current theory, we reexamine the Haldane's instanton in an\nalternative way along the direction of topology. We find that the the monopole\nevents are space-time singularities of N\\'eel field $\\vec{n}$, the\ncorresponding topological charges are the wrapping number of $\\vec{n}$ around\nthe singularities which can be expressed in terms of the Hopf indices and\nBrouwer degrees of $\\phi$-mapping. The suppression of the monopole events can\nonly be guaranteed when the $\\phi$-field possesses no zero points. Moreover,\nthe quadrapolarity of monopole events in the Heisenberg model due to the Berry\nphase is also reproduced in this topological argument.\n"]}]

In this paper an efficient Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based\nreactive power optimization approach is presented. The optimal reactive power\ndispatch problem is a nonlinear optimization problem with several constraints.\nThe objective of the proposed PSO is to minimize the total support cost from\ngenerators and reactive compensators. It is achieved by maintaining the whole\nsystem power loss as minimum thereby reducing cost allocation. The purpose of\nreactive power dispatch is to determine the proper amount and location of\nreactive support.

In this regime the virtual\ncorrections can be described by a generalized renormalization group equation\nwith infrared singular anomalous dimensions. The results are valid for virtual\nelectroweak corrections to fermions and transversely polarized vector bosons\nwith an arbitrary number of external lines. The subleading terms are found to\nexponentiate as well and are related to external lines, allowing for a\nprobabilistic interpretation in the massless limit. For $Z$-boson and $\\gamma$\nfinal states our approach leads to exponentiation with respect to each\namplitude containing the fields of the unbroken theory. For longitudinal\ndegrees of freedom it is shown that the equivalence theorem can be used to\nobtain the correct double logarithmic asymptotics. At the subleading level,\ncorrections to the would be Goldstone bosons contribute which should be\nconsidered separately.

We call $A_{u,v}(g)$ a biquantization of\n$S(g)$. We show that the bialgebra $A_{u,v}(g^*)$ quantizing $U(g^*)$,\n$U(g)^*$, and $S(g^*)$ is essentially dual to the bialgebra obtained from\n$A_{u,v}(g)$ by exchanging $u$ and $v$.

They can also be accelerated\nor decelerated by applying an appropriate high voltage switching sequence to\nthe lenses. AG focusing is applicable to molecules in both low-field and\nhigh-field-seeking states and is particularly well suited to the problem of\ndecelerating heavy molecules and those in their ground rotational state. We\ndescribe the principles of AG deceleration and set out criteria to be followed\nin decelerator design, construction and operation. We calculate the\nlongitudinal and transverse focusing properties of a decelerator, and exemplify\nthis by 2D-imaging studies of a decelerated beam of metastable CO molecules.\n","Comment: fix author names"]}]
