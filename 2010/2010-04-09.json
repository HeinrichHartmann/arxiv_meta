Secondly, we\nestimate how a different reaction rate for C-burning can affect the ignition.\nTwo-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of temperature perturbations in the\nWD core (\"bubbles\") are performed with the FLASH code. In order to evaluate the\nimpact of the C-burning reaction rate on the WD model, the evolution code\nFLASH_THE_TORTOISE from Lesaffre et al. (2006) is used. In different WD models\na key role is played by the different gravitational acceleration in the\nprogenitor's core. As a consequence, the ignition is disfavored at a large\ndistance from the WD center in models with a larger central density, resulting\nfrom the evolution of initially more massive progenitors. Changes in the C\nreaction rate at T < 5e8 K slightly influence the ignition density in the WD\ncore, while the ignition temperature is almost unaffected. Recent measurements\nof new resonances in the C-burning reaction rate (Spillane et al. 2007) do not\naffect the core conditions of the WD significantly.

A specific solution to the problem of image\nrestoration is generally determined by the nature of degradation phenomenon as\nwell as by the statistical properties of measurement noises. The present study\nis concerned with the case in which the images of interest are corrupted by\nconvolutional blurs and Poisson noises. To deal with such problems, there\nexists a range of solution methods which are based on the principles\noriginating from the fixed-point algorithm of Richardson and Lucy (RL). In this\npaper, we provide conceptual and experimental proof that such methods tend to\nconverge to sparse solutions, which makes them applicable only to those images\nwhich can be represented by a relatively small number of non-zero samples in\nthe spatial domain. Unfortunately, the set of such images is relatively small,\nwhich restricts the applicability of RL-type methods. On the other hand,\nvirtually all practical images admit sparse representations in the domain of a\nproperly designed linear transform. To take advantage of this fact, it is\ntherefore tempting to modify the RL algorithm so as to make it recover\nrepresentation coefficients, rather than the values of their associated image.\nSuch modification is introduced in this paper. Apart from the generality of its\nassumptions, the proposed method is also superior to many established\nreconstruction approaches in terms of estimation accuracy and computational\ncomplexity.

In this paper, we intend to answer one key\nquestion to the success of Cloud computing: in Cloud, can small or medium-scale\nscientific computing communities benefit from the economies of scale? Our\nresearch contributions are three-fold: first, we propose an enhanced scientific\npublic cloud model (ESP) that encourages small- or medium-scale organizations\nto rent elastic resources from a public cloud provider; second, on a basis of\nthe ESP model, we design and implement the DawningCloud system that can\nconsolidate heterogeneous scientific workloads on a Cloud site; third, we\npropose an innovative emulation methodology and perform a comprehensive\nevaluation. We found that for two typical workloads: high throughput computing\n(HTC) and many task computing (MTC), DawningCloud saves the resource\nconsumption maximally by 44.5% (HTC) and 72.6% (MTC) for service providers, and\nsaves the total resource consumption maximally by 47.3% for a resource provider\nwith respect to the previous two public Cloud solutions. To this end, we\nconclude that for typical workloads: HTC and MTC, DawningCloud can enable\nscientific communities to benefit from the economies of scale of public Clouds.\n","Comment: 16 pages"]}]

One of its main limitations is the lack of\na computationally fast method to determine the two parameters fuzzifier and\ncluster number. Wrong parameter values may either lead to the inclusion of\npurely random fluctuations in the results or ignore potentially important data.\nThe optimal solution has parameter values for which the clustering does not\nyield any results for a purely random data set but which detects cluster\nformation with maximum resolution on the edge of randomness.

Taking the dimension of the set and the number of\nobjects as input values instead of evaluating the entire data set allows us to\npropose a functional relationship determining its value directly.
