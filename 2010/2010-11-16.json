In practice, the control pulses used for\ndecoupling are imperfect and thus introduce errors which can accumulate after\nmany pulses. These instrumental errors can destroy the quantum state. Here we\nexamine several dynamical decoupling sequences, and their concatenated\nvariants, using electron spin resonance of donor electron spins in a $^{28}$Si\ncrystal.

We further find that concatenated sequences\nperform better than the periodic variants, maintaining near 100% fidelities for\nspin states even after several hundred control pulses.

Therefore, there is a\ncomplicated tradeoff between the uncertainty introduced and the information\ngained by the measurement, and thus a theoretical investigation of the\ncapability of MFC is of fundamental importance. In this paper, inspired by both\nthe Heisenberg uncertainty principle for quantum systems and the investigation\nof the feedback capability for classical systems, we try to answer the\nfollowing three basic questions: (i) How to choose the measurement channel\nappropriately?

Until now, however, the timescale over which this process happens\nremained very poorly constrained. Using recently-measured turbulent mixing\nrates for fingering convection, I provide reliable numerical and\nsemi-analytical estimates for the rate at which the added heavy elements drain\ninto the interior. I find that the relative metallicity enhancement post-infall\ndrops by a factor of ten over a timescale which depends only on the structure\nof the host star, and decreases very rapidly with increasing stellar mass (from\nabout 1Gyr for a 1.3M_sun star to 10Myr for a 1.5M_sun star). This result\noffers an elegant explanation to the lack of observed trend between metallicity\nand convection zone mass in planet-bearing stars.

Finally, the fingering region is found to extend\ndeeply into the star, a result which would provide a simple theoretical\nexplanation to the measurements of higher lithium depletion rates in\nplanet-bearing stars.\n","Comment: Submitted to ApJ Letters on October 29th. 14 pages, 5 figures.

If there exists a C such that the distribution of digits of C times the\nelements of some set is the same as that of zeta, we say that set exhibits\nshifted exponential behavior base B (with a shift of log_B C \\bmod 1). Let X_1,\n>..., X_N be independent identically distributed random variables. If the X_i's\nare drawn from the uniform distribution on [0,L], then as N\\to\\infty the\ndistribution of the digits of the differences between adjacent order statistics\nconverges to shifted exponential behavior (with a shift of \\log_B L/N \\bmod 1).\nBy differentiating the cumulative distribution function of the logarithms\nmodulo 1, applying Poisson Summation and then integrating the resulting\nexpression, we derive rapidly converging explicit formulas measuring the\ndeviations from Benford's Law. Fix a delta in (0,1) and choose N independent\nrandom variables from any compactly supported distribution with uniformly\nbounded first and second derivatives and a second order Taylor series expansion\nat each point. The distribution of digits of any N^\\delta consecutive\ndifferences \\emph{and} all N-1 normalized differences of the order statistics\nexhibit shifted exponential behavior. We derive conditions on the probability\ndensity which determine whether or not the distribution of the digits of all\nthe un-normalized differences converges to Benford's Law, shifted exponential\nbehavior, or oscillates between the two, and show that the Pareto distribution\nleads to oscillating behavior.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 2 figures, version 4: Version 3: most of the numerical\n  simulations on shifted exponential behavior have been suppressed (though are\n  available from the authors upon request). Version 4: a referee pointed out\n  that we need epsilon > 1/3 - delta/2 in the proof of Theorem 1.5; this has\n  now been added"]}]
