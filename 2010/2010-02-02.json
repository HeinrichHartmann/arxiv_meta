Luminous blazars have also typically very hard X-ray\nspectra, and those in turn seem to challenge hadronic scenarios for the high\nenergy blazar emission. As shown in this paper, no such problems are faced by\nthe models which involve Comptonization of radiation provided by a broad\nline-region, or dusty molecular torus. The lack or weakness of bulk Compton and\nKlein-Nishina features indicated by the presently available data favors\nproduction of gamma-rays via up-scattering of infrared photons from hot dust.\nThis implies that the blazar emission zone is located at parsec-scale distances\nfrom the nucleus, and as such is possibly associated with the extended,\nquasi-stationary reconfinement shocks formed in relativistic outflows. This\nscenario predicts characteristic timescales for flux changes in luminous\nblazars to be days/weeks, consistent with the variability patterns observed in\nsuch systems at infrared, optical and gamma-ray frequencies. We also propose\nthat the parsec-scale blazar activity can be occasionally accompanied by\ndissipative events taking place at sub-parsec distances and powered by internal\nshocks and/or reconnection of magnetic fields. These could account for the\nmultiwavelength intra-day flares occasionally observed in powerful blazars\nsources.\n","Comment: 34 pages, accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal"]}]

From the optimal configuration, we expect to cut down the amount of the\nneeded material and the number of forming operations.

In this paper, this phenomenon causes the use of four forming\noperations for the cup manufacture. The aim is to cut down from four to two\nforming stages by defining an optimal blank (size and shape). The advantage is\nto reduce the cost of the tool manufacturing and to minimize the needed\nmaterial (by suppressing the part flange). The chosen approach consists in\ndefining a particular description of the ears' part by modal decomposition and\nthen simulating several blank shapes and sizes generated by discrete cosine\ntransformation (DCT). The use of a numerical simulation for the forming\noperation and the design of an experiment technique allow mathematical links\nbetween the ears' formation and the DCT coefficients.

In the physical regime of a small\ninelasticity (that is $\\alpha \\in [\\alpha_*,1)$ for some constructive\n$\\alpha_*>0$) we prove uniqueness of the self-similar profile for given values\nof the restitution coefficient $\\alpha \\in [\\alpha_*,1)$, the mass and the\nmomentum; therefore we deduce the uniqueness of the self-similar solution (up\nto a time translation). Moreover, if the initial datum lies in $L^1_3$, and\nunder some smallness condition on $(1-\\alpha_*)$ depending on the mass, energy\nand $L^1_3$ norm of this initial datum, we prove time asymptotic convergence\n(with polynomial rate) of the solution towards the self-similar solution (the\nso-called {\\em homogeneous cooling state}). These uniqueness, stability and\nconvergence results are expressed in the self-similar variables and then\ntranslate into corresponding results for the original Boltzmann equation. The\nproofs are based on the identification of a suitable elastic limit rescaling,\nand the construction of a smooth path of self-similar profiles connecting to a\nparticular Maxwellian equilibrium in the elastic limit, together with tools\nfrom perturbative theory of linear operators. Some universal quantities, such\nas the \"quasi-elastic self-similar temperature\" and the rate of convergence\ntowards self-similarity at first order in terms of $(1-\\alpha)$, are obtained\nfrom our study. These results provide a positive answer and a mathematical\nproof of the Ernst-Brito conjecture [16] in the case of inelastic hard spheres\nwith small inelasticity.\n","Comment: 73 pages"]}]
