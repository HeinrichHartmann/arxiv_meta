The\ninfluence of the tree structure and the parameters of the Gaussian distribution\non the learning rate as the number of samples increases is discussed.\nSpecifically, the error exponent corresponding to the event that the estimated\ntree structure differs from the actual unknown tree structure of the\ndistribution is analyzed. Finding the error exponent reduces to a least-squares\nproblem in the very noisy learning regime. In this regime, it is shown that the\nextremal tree structure that minimizes the error exponent is the star for any\nfixed set of correlation coefficients on the edges of the tree. If the\nmagnitudes of all the correlation coefficients are less than 0.63, it is also\nshown that the tree structure that maximizes the error exponent is the Markov\nchain. In other words, the star and the chain graphs represent the hardest and\nthe easiest structures to learn in the class of tree-structured Gaussian\ngraphical models.

It appears that the function v(n) satisfies many\ncongruences modulo 2^N. For example, for every integer B there exists (as k\ntends to infinity) the limit of v(2^k+B) in the 2-adic topology. The parity of\nv(n) obeys a simple rule. In this paper we extend this result to higher powers\nof 2. In particular, we prove that for each positive integer N there exists a\nfinite table which lists all the possible cases of this sequence modulo 2^N.\nOne of our main results claims that v(n) is divisible by 2^N for almost all n,\nhowever large the value of N is.\n","Comment: 8 pages"]}]

TSDS was developed to respond quickly to\nrequests for long time spans of data. Data may be served from a fast database,\ntypically created by aggregating granules (e.g., data files) from a remote data\nsource and storing them in a local cache that is optimized for serving time\nseries. The system was designed specifically for time series data, and is\noptimized for requests where the longest dimension of the requested data\nstructure is time. Scalar, vector, and spectrogram time series types are\nsupported. The user can interact with the server by requesting a time series, a\ndate range, and an optional filter to apply to the data. Available filters\ninclude strides, block average/minimum/maximum, exclude, and inequality.\nConstraint expressions are supported, which allow such operations as a request\nfor data from one time series when a different time series satisfied a\nspecified relationship. TSDS builds upon DAP (Data Access Protocol), NcML\n(netCDF Mark-up language) and related software libraries. In this work, we\ndescribe the current design of this server, as well as planned features and\npotential implementation strategies.\n","Comment: Submitted to Earth Science Informatics"]}]
