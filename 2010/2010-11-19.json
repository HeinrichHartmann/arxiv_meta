We thus want to\ninvestigate whether WR stars are potential progenitors of stripped-envelope\ncore-collapse supernovae (SNe) and/or long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs).\nMethods: We derived the relative surface brightness (fractional flux) at the\nlocations of WR stars and compared with similar results for LGRBs and SNe. We\nexamined two nearby galaxies, M 83 and NGC 1313, for which a comprehensive\nstudy of the WR population exists. These two galaxies contain a sufficiently\nlarge number of WR stars and sample different metallicities. To enable the\ncomparison, the images of the galaxies were processed to make them appear as\nthey would look at a higher redshift. The robustness of our results against\nseveral sources of uncertainty was investigated with the aid of Monte Carlo\nsimulations. Results: We find that the WC star distribution favours brighter\npixels than the WN star population. WC stars are more likely drawn from the\nsame distribution as SNe Ic than from other SN distributions, while WN stars\nshow a higher degree of association with SNe Ib. It can also not be excluded\nthat WR (especially WC) stars are related to LGRBs. Some differences between\nthe two galaxies do exist, especially in the subtype distributions, and may\nstem from differences in metallicity. Conclusions: Although a conclusive answer\nis not possible, the expectation that WR stars are the progenitors of SNe Ib/c\nand LGRBs survives this test. The trend observed between the distributions of\nWN and WC stars, as compared to those of SNe Ib and Ic, is consistent with the\ntheoretical picture that SNe Ic result from progenitors that have been stripped\nof a larger part of their envelope.\n","Comment: The previous version was accepted (March 31).

This is contradicted by field\nobservations, where extended conduits, sometimes several kilometers long, are\nfound in karst environments. However, a sharp drop in the dissolution rate of\nCaCO_3 near saturation provides a mechanism for much deeper penetration of\nreactant. The notion of a \"kinetic trigger\" - a sudden change in rate constant\nover a narrow concentration range - has become a widely accepted paradigm in\nspeleogenesis modeling. However, it is based on one-dimensional models for the\nfluid and solute transport inside the fracture, assuming that the dissolution\nfront is planar in the direction perpendicular to the flow.

These models typically involve many free\nparameters whose determination is a substantial obstacle to model development.\nDirect measurement of biochemical parameters in vivo is often difficult and\nsometimes impracticable, while fitting them under data-poor conditions may\nresult in biologically implausible values.\n  Results: We discuss different methodological approaches to estimate\nparameters in complex biological models. We make use of the high computational\npower of the Blue Gene technology to perform an extensive study of the\nparameter space in a model of avascular tumor growth. We explicitly show that\nthe landscape of the cost function used to optimize the model to the data has a\nvery rugged surface in parameter space. This cost function has many local\nminima with unrealistic solutions, including the global minimum corresponding\nto the best fit.\n  Conclusions: The case studied in this paper shows one example in which model\nparameters that optimally fit the data are not necessarily the best ones from a\nbiological point of view. To avoid force-fitting a model to a dataset, we\npropose that the best model parameters should be found by choosing, among\nsuboptimal parameters, those that match criteria other than the ones used to\nfit the model. We also conclude that the model, data and optimization approach\nform a new complex system, and point to the need of a theory that addresses\nthis problem more generally.\n"]}]

In this note,\nit is investigated the extent to which the framework can be generalized to the\ncase of non-Abelian gauge theories where `hairy black holes' are known to\nexist.

A general testing bed for the instability of hairy black holes in\ngeneral non-linear theories is suggested. As an example, the embedded Abelian\nmagnetic solutions are considered.

This process is called time delay interferometry (TDI). In\nthe papers that defined the TDI variables, their performance was evaluated in\nthe limit that the gravitational wave detector is fixed in space. However, the\nperformance depends on certain symmetries in the armlengths that are available\nif the detector is fixed in space, but that will be broken in the actual\nrotating and flexing configuration produced by the LISA orbits. In this paper\nwe investigate the performance of these TDI variables for the real LISA orbits.\nFirst, addressing the effects of rotation, we verify Daniel Shaddock's result\nthat the Sagnac variables will not cancel out the laser phase noise, and we\nalso find the same result for the symmetric Sagnac variable. The loss of the\nlatter variable would be particularly unfortunate since this variable also\ncancels out gravitational wave signal, allowing instrument noise in the\ndetector to be isolated and measured. Fortunately, we have found a set of more\ncomplicated TDI variables, which we call Delta-Sagnac variables, one of which\naccomplishes the same goal as the symmetric Sagnac variable to good accuracy.\nFinally, however, as we investigate the effects of the flexing of the detector\narms due to non-circular orbital motion, we show that all variables, including\nthe interferometer variables, which survive the rotation-induced loss of\ndirection symmetry, will not completely cancel laser phase noise when the\narmlengths are changing with time.

We first reproduce various ans\\\"atze for compactification to 7d\nfrom the ansatz for the full nonlinear KK reduction of 11d sugra on\n$AdS_7\\times S_4$. As a side result, we obtain a lagrangian formulation of 7d\n${\\cal N}=2$ gauged sugra, which so far had only a on-shell formulation,\nthrough field equations and constraints. The $AdS_7\\times S_4$ ansatz\ngeneralizes therefore all previous sphere compactifications to 7d.

The\n11-dimensional sugra truncated on $S_4$ fits precisely the case under\nconsideration, and serves as a model for our construction.

In the effective four-dimensional field-theory picture, such\nwalls are interpreted as one of the (stable) solutions with the constant\ngradient energy, discussed earlier. In the cosmological context their energy\n\"redshifts\" by the Hubble expansion and dissipates slower then the one in\nmatter or radiation. The tilted wall eventually starts to dominate the\nUniverse. The upper bound on the energy density coincides with the present\ncritical energy density. Thus, this mechanism can become significant any time\nin the future. The solutions we discuss are characterized by a tiny spontaneous\nbreaking of both the Lorentz and rotational invariances. Small calculable\nLorentz noninvariant terms in the standard-model Lagrangian are induced. Thus,\nthe tilted walls provide a framework for the spontaneous breaking of the\nLorentz invariance.\n","Comment: Latex, 13 pages, 2 eps figures. To appear in L.B. Okun Festschrift,\n  Eds. V.
