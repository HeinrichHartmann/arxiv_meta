In\nmaking this distinction precise, we are led to a novel classification of hidden\nvariable models of quantum theory.

Our\napproach also provides a fruitful new perspective on arguments for the\nnonlocality and incompleteness of quantum theory. Specifically, we show that\nfor models wherein the quantum state has the status of something real, the\nfailure of locality can be established through an argument considerably more\nstraightforward than Bell's theorem. The historical significance of this result\nbecomes evident when one recognizes that the same reasoning is present in\nEinstein's preferred argument for incompleteness, which dates back to 1935.\nThis fact suggests that Einstein was seeking not just any completion of quantum\ntheory, but one wherein quantum states are solely representative of our\nknowledge.

This implies both a systematic shift making the actual limits to\nthe Yukawa force weaker than claimed so far, and a degree of uncertainty in the\nalpha-lambda plane related to the handling of the various approximations used\nin the theory for both the Casimir and the Yukawa forces. We further argue that\nthe recently discussed form for the proximity force approximation is\nequivalent, for a geometry made of a generic object interacting with an\ninfinite planar slab, to the usual exact integration of any additive two-body\ninteraction, without any need to invoke approximation schemes.

Recent studies of structural evolution with temperature and\npressure are reviewed. Some borohydrides involving less electropositive metals\n(e.g. Mg and Zn) reveal porous structures and dense interpenetrated frameworks,\nthus resembling metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Analysis of phase transitions,\nand the related changes of the coordination geometries for M atoms and BH4\ngroups, suggests that the directional BH4...M interaction is at the origin of\nthe structural complexity of borohydrides. The ways to influence their\nstability by chemical modification are discussed.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 9 figures.

In most\nvertebrates the active process stems from the active motility of hair bundles.\nThe mammalian cochlea exhibits an additional form of mechanical activity termed\nelectromotility: its outer hair cells (OHCs) change length upon electrical\nstimulation. The relative contributions of these two mechanisms to the active\nprocess in the mammalian inner ear is the subject of intense current debate.\nHere we show that active hair-bundle motility and electromotility can together\nimplement an efficient mechanism for amplification that functions like a\nratchet: sound-evoked forces acting on the basilar membrane are transmitted to\nthe hair bundles whereas electromotility decouples active hair-bundle forces\nfrom the basilar membrane. This unidirectional coupling can extend the hearing\nrange well below the resonant frequency of the basilar membrane. It thereby\nprovides a concept for low-frequency hearing that accounts for a variety of\nunexplained experimental observations from the cochlear apex, including the\nshape and phase behavior of apical tuning curves, their lack of significant\nnonlinearities, and the shape changes of threshold tuning curves of auditory\nnerve fibers along the cochlea. The ratchet mechanism constitutes a general\ndesign principle for implementing mechanical amplification in engineering\napplications.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures, plus Supplementary Information.

The\nlow-temperature configurations of the spin glass on square lattice can be\nviewed as strings connecting pairs of frustrated plaquettes. The worm algorithm\ndirectly manipulates these strings. It is shown that the worm algorithm is as\nefficient as any other types of cluster or replica-exchange algorithms. The\nworm algorithm is even more efficient if free boundary conditions are used.
