For quantum wires with\nspin-conserving boundary conditions, we find a crossover from weak anti- to\nweak localization as the wire width W is reduced using exact diagonalization of\nthe Cooperon equation. This crossover is due to the dimensional dependence of\nthe spin relaxation rate of conduction electrons, which becomes diminished,\nwhen the wire width is smaller than the bulk spin precession length $L_{SO}$.\nWe thus confirm previous results for small wire width, $W/L_{SO}<= 1$\n[PRL98,176808(2007)], where only the transverse 0-modes of the Cooperon\nequation had been taken into account. We find that spin helix solutions become\nstable for arbitrary ratios of linear Rashba and Dresselhaus coupling in narrow\nwires. For wider wires, the spin relaxation rate is found to be not monotonous\nas function of wire width: it becomes first enhanced for W on the order of the\nbulk $L_{SO}$ before it becomes diminished for smaller wire widths. In\naddition, we find that the spin relaxation is smallest at the edge of the wire\nfor wide wires. The effect of the Zeeman coupling to the magnetic field\nperpendicular to the 2D electron system is studied and found that it shifts the\ncrossover from weak anti- to weak localization to larger wire widths $W_c$.\nWhen the transverse confinement potential of the quantum wire is smooth\n(adiabatic), the spin relaxation rate is found to be enhanced as W is reduced.\nWe find that only a spin polarized state retains a finite spin relaxation rate\nin such narrow wires. Thus, we conclude that the injection of polarized spins\ninto nonmagnetic quantum wires should be favorable in wires with smooth\nconfinement potential. Finally, in wires with tubular shape, corresponding to\ntransverse periodic boundary conditions, we find no reduction of the spin\nrelaxation rate.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 16 figures"]}]

We find that it is quite conceivable to reach a large statistical\nsignificance for the multi-jet plus missing energy signal with an integrated\nluminosity about 50 pb^-1 (50 fb^-1) for a gluino mass of 500 GeV (1 TeV). If\ngluinos are not too heavy, less than about 1.5 TeV, this channel can typically\nprobe gaugino masses up to about 100 GeV below the gluino mass. We then study\nthe Drell-Yan type of gaugino pair production in association with a hard QCD\njet, for gaugino masses in the range of 100-150 GeV. The signal observation may\nbe statistically feasible with about 10 fb^-1, but systematically challenging\ndue to the lack of distinctive features for the signal distributions.
