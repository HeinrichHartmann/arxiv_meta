It is a legitimate question to ask how human brain can receive subtle\nexternal visual quantum information intact when it must pass through very noisy\nand complex pathways from the eye to the brain? There are several approaches to\ninvestigate information processing in the brain, each of which presents a\ndifferent set of conclusions. Penrose and Hameroff have hypothesized that there\nis quantum information processing inside the human brain whose material\nsubstrate involves microtubules and consciousness is the result of a collective\nwavefunction collapse occurring in these structures. Conversely, Tegmark stated\nthat owing to thermal decoherence there cannot be any quantum processing in\nneurons of the brain and processing in the brain must be classical for\ncognitive processes. However, Rosa and Faber presented an argument for a middle\nway which shows that none of the previous authors are completely right and\ndespite the presence of decoherence, it is still possible to consider the brain\nto be a quantum system. Additionally, Thaheld, has concluded that quantum\nstates of photons do collapse in the human eye and there is no possibility for\ncollapse of visual quantum states in the brain and thus there is no possibility\nfor the quantum state reduction in the brain.

Two principally independent methods of time series analysis are\nused: the T-R periodogram analysis (both in the standard and \"scanning window\"\nregimes) and the wavelet-analysis.

Generally the users require only certain aggregate\nfunctions of this distributed data. Computation of this aggregate data under\nthe end-to-end information flow paradigm by communicating all the relevant data\nto a central collector node is a highly inefficient solution for this purpose.\nAn alternative proposition is to perform in-network computation. This, however,\nraises questions such as: what is the optimal way to compute an aggregate\nfunction from a set of statistically correlated values stored in different\nnodes; what is the security of such aggregation as the results sent by a\ncompromised or faulty node in the network can adversely affect the accuracy of\nthe computed result. In this paper, we have presented an energy-efficient\naggregation algorithm for WSNs that is secure and robust against malicious\ninsider attack by any compromised or faulty node in the network. In contrast to\nthe traditional snapshot aggregation approach in WSNs, a node in the proposed\nalgorithm instead of unicasting its sensed information to its parent node,\nbroadcasts its estimate to all its neighbors. This makes the system more\nfault-tolerant and increase the information availability in the network. The\nsimulations conducted on the proposed algorithm have produced results that\ndemonstrate its effectiveness.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures, 1 table.

Some axioms are introduced to\nspecify these basic functions in our logic.\n  The concept Memory Scope Function (MSF) is introduced in our logic. Given a\nrecursive function $f$, the MSF of $f$ computes the set of memory units\naccessed during the evaluation of $f$. A set of rules are given to derive the\ndefinition of this MSF syntactically from the definition of $f$. As MSFs are\nalso recursive functions, they also have their MSFs.

A threshold time for antigen to stay bound to BCR for\nseveral seconds before the latter becomes signaling-capable, similar to kinetic\nproofreading, is needed to overcome the loss in serial engagement due to\nincreasing antigen affinity, and replicate the monotonic increase in B cell\nsignaling with affinity observed in B cell activation experiments. This finding\nmatches well with the experimentally observed time (~ 20 seconds) required for\nthe BCR signaling domains to undergo antigen and lipid raft-mediated\nconformational changes that lead to Src-family kinase recruitment. We\nhypothesize that the physical basis of the threshold time of antigen binding\nmay lie in the formation timescale of BCR dimers.

We\nshow that, actually, any possible non-local correlation which produces random\nbits on both sides can be used to implement bit commitment, and that this holds\neven when the parties are allowed to delay their inputs to the box. Since a\nparticular example is the behavior of an EPR pair, this resource allows for\nimplementing unconditionally secure bit commitment as long as the parties\ncannot entangle their Qbits with any other system.\n","Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the authors.
