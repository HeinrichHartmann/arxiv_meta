This situation\nhas relevance in applications such as multi-cell coordination in cellular\nnetworks as well as spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks among others.\nWe address the design of precoding (i.e. beamforming) vectors at each sender\nwith the aim of striking a compromise between beamforming gain at the intended\nreceiver (Egoism) and the mitigation of interference created towards other\nreceivers (Altruism). Combining egoistic and altruistic beamforming has been\nshown previously to be instrumental to optimizing the rates in a MISO\ninterference channel (i.e. where receivers have no interference canceling\ncapability) . Here we explore these game-theoretic concepts in the more general\ncontext of MIMO channels and using the framework of Bayesian games, allowing us\nto derive (semi-)distributed precoding techniques. We draw parallels with\nexisting work on the MIMO interference channel, including rate-optimizing and\ninterference-alignement precoding techniques, showing how such techniques may\nbe improved and re-interpretated through a common prism based on balancing\negoistic and altruistic beamforming.\n"]}]

For Planck/LFI the requirements are Cr =\n2.4 and EpsilonQ <= 10% of the rms of the instrumental white noise.

One of the most intriguing\nfeatures of such a model is that it also predicts small effects on the orbital\nmotion of test particles which could be tested in such a way that local\nmeasurements at Solar System scales would allow to get information on the\nglobal properties of the Universe. Lue and Starkman derived a secular\nextra-perihelion \\omega precession of 5\\times 10^-4 arcseconds per century,\nwhile Iorio showed that the mean longitude \\lambda is affected by a secular\nprecession of about 10^-3 arcseconds per century. Such effects depend only on\nthe eccentricities e of the orbits via second-order terms: they are, instead,\nindependent of their semimajor axes a. Up to now, the observational efforts\nfocused on the dynamics of the inner planets of the Solar System whose orbits\nare the best known via radar ranging. Since the competing Newtonian and\nEinsteinian effects like the precessions due to the solar quadrupole mass\nmoment J2, the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic part of the equations of\nmotion reduce with increasing distances, it would be possible to argue that an\nanalysis of the orbital dynamics of the outer planets of the Solar System, with\nparticular emphasis on Saturn because of the ongoing Cassini mission with its\nprecision ranging instrumentation, could be helpful in evidencing the predicted\nnew features of motion. In this note we investigate this possibility in view of\nthe latest results in the planetary ephemeris field. Unfortunately, the current\nlevel of accuracy rules out this appealing possibility and it appears unlikely\nthat Cassini and GAIA will ameliorate the situation.\n","Comment: LaTex, 22 pages, 2 tables, 10 figures, 27 references.
