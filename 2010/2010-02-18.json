This unique\nstellar system is both one of the oldest (8 Gyr) and most metal-rich ([Fe/H] ~\n0.4) open clusters in our Galaxy, and has a color-magnitude diagram (CMD) that\nexhibits both a red giant clump and a much hotter extreme horizontal branch.\nFitting the Balmer lines of the white dwarfs in the cluster, using Keck/LRIS\nspectra, suggests that most of these stars are undermassive, <M> = 0.43 +/-\n0.06 Msun, and therefore could not have formed from canonical stellar evolution\ninvolving the helium flash at the tip of the red giant branch. We show that at\nleast 40% of NGC 6791's evolved stars must have lost enough mass on the red\ngiant branch to avoid the flash, and therefore did not convert helium into\ncarbon-oxygen in their core. Such increased mass loss in the evolution of the\nprogenitors of these stars is consistent with the presence of the extreme\nhorizontal branch in the CMD. This unique stellar evolutionary channel also\nnaturally explains the recent finding of a very young age (2.4 Gyr) for NGC\n6791 from white dwarf cooling theory; helium core white dwarfs in this cluster\nwill cool ~3 times slower than carbon-oxygen core stars and therefore the\ncorrected white dwarf cooling age is in fact ~7 Gyr, consistent with the well\nmeasured main-sequence turnoff age. These results provide direct empirical\nevidence that mass loss is much more efficient in high metallicity environments\nand therefore may be critical in interpreting the ultraviolet upturn in\nelliptical galaxies.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables.

For a field star the differences in its\nrelative coordinate positions of two epochs will be accumulated. For a cluster\nstar, on the contrary, the changes in relative positions of cluster members at\nt_1 and t_2 will be very small. On the histogram of sums the cluster stars will\ngather to the left of the diagram, while the field stars will form a tail to\nthe right. The procedure allows us to efficiently discriminate one group from\nanother. The greater the distance between t_1 and t_2 and the more cluster\nstars present, the greater is the effect. The accumulation method does not\nrequire reference stars, determination of centroids and modelling the\ndistribution of field stars, necessary in traditional methods.

The\nmixed-symmetry basis combines traditional spherical shell-model states with\nSU(3) collective configurations. We test the validity of this mixed-symmetry\nscheme on 24Mg and 44Ti. Results for 24Mg, obtained using the Wilthental USD\nintersection in a space that spans less than 10% of the full-space, reproduce\nthe binding energy within 2% as well as an accurate reproduction of the\nlow-energy spectrum and the structure of the states - 90% overlap with the\nexact eigenstates. In contrast, for an m-scheme calculation, one needs about\n60% of the full space to obtain compatible results. Calculations for 44Ti\nsupport the mixed-mode scheme although the pure SU(3) calculations with few\nirreps are not as good as the standard m-scheme calculations. The strong\nbreaking of the SU(3) symmetry results in relatively small enhancements within\nthe combined basis. However, an oblique-basis calculation in 50% of the full\npf-shell space is as good as a usual m-scheme calculation in 80% of the space.\nResults for the lower pf-shell nuclei 44-48Ti and 48Cr, using the Kuo-Brown-3\ninteraction, show that SU(3) symmetry breaking in this region is driven by the\nsingle-particle spin-orbit splitting. In our study we observe some interesting\ncoherent structures, such as coherent mixing of basis states,\nquasi-perturbative behavior in the toy model, and enhanced B(E2) strengths\nclose to the SU(3) limit even though SU(3) appears to be rather badly broken.\n","Comment: 120 pages, 3 tables, 39 figures, PhD thesis (2002), LSU web page:\n  http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-1028102-183920/"]}]

In the case of two branes of opposite tension,\nlinearized Brans-Dicke (BD) gravity is recovered on either wall, with different\nBD parameters. On the wall with positive tension the BD parameter is larger\nthan 3000 provided that the separation between walls is larger than 4 times the\nAdS radius. For the wall of negative tension, the BD parameter is always\nnegative but greater than -3/2. In either case, shadow matter from the other\nwall gravitates upon us. For equal Newtonian mass, light deflection from shadow\nmatter is 25 % weaker than from ordinary matter. Hence, the effective mass of a\nclustered object containing shadow dark matter would be underestimated if\nnaively measured through its lensing effect. For the case of a single wall of\npositive tension, Einstein gravity is recovered on the wall to leading order,\nand if the source is stationary the field stays localized near the wall. We\ncalculate the leading Kaluza-Klein corrections to the linearized gravitational\nfield of a non-relativistic spherical object and find that the metric is\ndifferent from the Schwarzschild solution at large distances. We believe that\nour linearized solution corresponds to the field far from the horizon after\ngravitational collapse of matter on the brane.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 1 figure.
