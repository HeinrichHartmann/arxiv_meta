The instanton is realized by a Euclidean D brane wrapping a non-trivial\ncycle upon which we also wrap a single space-filling D brane. The standard\nproblem of unwanted neutral fermionic zero modes is evaded by the appearance of\ncouplings to charged bosonic zero modes in the instanton moduli action. Since\nthe Euclidean D brane wraps a cycle which is not associated to any low energy\ngauge dynamics, it can not be interpreted as an ordinary gauge instanton, but\nrather as a stringy one. By considering such a brane configuration at an\norbifold singularity, we can explicitly evaluate the instanton moduli space\nintegral and find a holomorphic superpotential term with the structure of a\nbaryonic mass term.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 1 figure, minor corrections, comments added, figure changed"]}]

These magnetic fields can weaken the positive correlation between\nthe arrival directions of HECRs and the positions of their sources.

The dependence of the\ncorrelation signals on GMF models are also investigated. The correlation can be\nobserved by accumulating $\\sim 200$ protons in a half hemisphere. Typical\nangular scale at which the positive signal of the correlation is maximized\ndepends on the spiral component of GMF models.

This implies that these flows can only develop singularities where the\ncurvature blows up, and that blowing-up sequences converge (up to a\nsubsequence) to a \"singularity model\", namely a complete Bach-flat, scalar-flat\nmanifold. We prove a rigidity result for those model manifolds and show that if\nthe initial energy is smaller than an explicit bound, then no singularity can\noccur. Under those assumptions, the flow exists for all time, and converges up\nto a subsequence to the sphere or the real projective space. This gives an\nalternative proof, under a slightly stronger assumption, of a result from\nChang, Gursky and Yang asserting that integral pinched 4-manifolds with\npositive Yamabe constant are space forms.\n"]}]

The width $d_{min}$ depends on $s$, and for\n$Z$-resonance channels at $s\\sim M^2_Z$ we get that $d_{min}(s)$ is 20 times\nsmaller than the low energy value. We apply the minimum width condition, $d\\geq\nd_{min}$, to high energy neutrinos in matter as well as in neutrino background.\nUsing this condition, we conclude that the matter effect is negligible for\nneutrinos propagating in AGN and GRBs environments.

Since\ninvariant composite fields have small fluctuations for large $N$, the method\nrelies on constructing effective field theories for composite fields after\nintegration over the original degrees of freedom. We first solve a general\nscalar $U(\\phib^2)$ field theory for $N$ large and discuss various\nnon-perturbative physical issues such as critical behaviour. We show how large\n$N$ results can also be obtained from variational calculations.We illustrate\nthese ideas by showing that the large $N$ expansion allows to relate the\n$(\\phib^2)^2$ theory and the non-linear $\\sigma$-model, models which are\nrenormalizable in different dimensions. Similarly, a relation between $CP(N-1)$\nand abelian Higgs models is exhibited. Large $N$ techniques also allow solving\nself-interacting fermion models. A relation between the Gross--Neveu, a theory\nwith a four-fermi self-interaction, and a Yukawa-type theory renormalizable in\nfour dimensions then follows. We discuss dissipative dynamics, which is\nrelevant to the approach to equilibrium, and which in some formulation exhibits\nquantum mechanics supersymmetry. This also serves as an introduction to the\nstudy of the 3D supersymmetric quantum field theory. Large $N$ methods are\nuseful in problems that involve a crossover between different dimensions. We\nthus briefly discuss finite size effects, finite temperature scalar and\nsupersymmetric field theories. We also use large $N$ methods to investigate the\nweakly interacting Bose gas. The solution of the general scalar $U(\\phib^2)$\nfield theory is then applied to other issues like tricritical behaviour and\ndouble scaling limit.\n","Comment: Review paper: 200 pages, 13 figures"]}]
