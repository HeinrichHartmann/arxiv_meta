This idea has been\nexplored in the literature in two main ways: firstly in a variety of explicit\nmodels of quantum systems, and secondly at a conceptual level. This note\nintroduces a third approach, intended to complement the other two. It describes\na simple toy model, which, under a natural interpretation, shows how\nretrocausality can emerge from simple global constraints. The model is also\nuseful in permitting a clear distinction between the kind of retrocausality\nlikely to be of interest in QM, and a different kind of reverse causality, with\nwhich it is liable to be confused.
