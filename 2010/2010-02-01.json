Our model is an extension of Davis and Lo's infectious default model. We\nconsider an economy of n firms which may default directly or may be infected by\nother defaulting firms (a domino effect being also possible). The spontaneous\ndefault without external influence and the infections are described by not\nnecessarily independent Bernoulli-type random variables. Moreover, several\ncontaminations could be required to infect another firm. In this paper we\ncompute the probability distribution function of the total number of defaults\nin a dependency context. We also give a simple recursive algorithm to compute\nthis distribution in an exchangeability context. Numerical applications\nillustrate the impact of exchangeability among direct defaults and among\ncontaminations, on different indicators calculated from the law of the total\nnumber of defaults. We then examine the calibration of the model on iTraxx data\nbefore and during the crisis. The dynamic feature together with the contagion\neffect seem to have a significant impact on the model performance, especially\nduring the recent distressed period.\n"]}]

Here, `metric' means the square of the norm defined on the\ntangent space, and not necessarily induced from an inner product (this property\nhereafter will be called inner-product-assumption), different from usual metric\nused in differential geometry. As for metrics in So far, there have been plenty\nof literatures on the metric in the space of probability distributions and\nquantum states. Among them, Cencov proved the monotone metric in probability\ndistribution space is unique up to constant multiple, and identical to Fisher\ninformation metric. Petz characterized all the monotone metrics in the quantum\nstate space using operator mean. As for channels, however, only a little had\nbeen known. In this paper, we impose monotonicity by concatenation of channels\nbefore and after the given channel families, and invariance by tensoring\nidentity channels. (Notably, we do not use the inner-product-assumption.) To\nobtain this result, `resource conversion' technique, which is widely used in\nquantum information, is used. We consider distillation from and formation to a\nfamily of channels. Under these axioms, we identify the largest and the\nsmallest `metrics'. Interestingly, they are not induced from any inner product,\ni.e., not a metric. Indeed, one can prove that any `metric' satisfying our\naxioms can not be a metric.

Shapiro plane waves are determined and explored as\nsolutions of Schr\\\"odinger equation in complex horosperical coordinates of\n$S_{3}$. In particular, two oppositely directed plane waves may be presented as\nexponentials in conjugated coordinates. $\\Psi_{-}= e^{-\\alpha z}$ and\n$\\Psi_{+}= e^{-\\alpha z^{*}}$.

The global\nmechanical response obtained through the use of Molecular Dynamics is shown to\nconverge to the quasistatic limit obtained with an energy minimization\nprotocol. The detailed analysis of the plastic deformation at different shear\nrates shows that the glass follows different flow regimes. At sufficiently low\nshear rates the mechanical response reaches a shear-rate independent regime\nthat exhibits all the characteristics of the quasistatic response (finite size\neffects, yield stress...). At intermediate shear rates the rheological\nproperties are determined by the externally applied shear-rate. Finally at\nhigher shear the system reaches a shear-rate independent homogeneous regime.\nThe existence of these three regimes is also confirmed by the detailed analysis\nof the atomic motion. The computation of the four-point correlation function\nshows that the transition from the shear-rate dominated to the quasistatic\nregime is accompanied by the growth of a dynamical cooperativity length scale\n$\\xi$ that is shown to diverge with shear rate.

Various other experimental results seem to point in\nthe same direction: For instance, localized wavelet-type solutions of Maxwell\nequations have been found, both theoretically and experimentally, that travel\nwith Superluminal speed. Even muonic and electronic neutrinos --it has been\nproposed-- might be \"tachyons\", since their square mass appears to be negative;\nnot to mention the apparent Superluminal expansions observed in the core of\nquasars and, recently, in the so-called galactic microquasars. In the first\npart of this paper we verify, on the basis of the numerical solution of Maxwell\nequations, that waves propagating down a microwave guide can travel with\nSuperluminal group velocity, just confirming some of the previously mentioned\nexperimental results. Then, we have to face the question of Superluminal\nmotions within the theory of Special Relativity. It is not widely recognized\nthat all such theoretical and experimental results do not place relativistic\ncausality in jeopardy. For instance, it is possible (at least in microphysics)\nto solve also the known causal paradoxes, devised for \"faster than light\"\nmotion. Here we show, in detail and rigorously, how to solve the oldest causal\nparadox, originally proposed by Tolman, which is the kernel of many further\ntachyon paradoxes. The key to the solution is a careful application of tachyon\nmechanics, as it unambiguously follows from Special Relativity.
