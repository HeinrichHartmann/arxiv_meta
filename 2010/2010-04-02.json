They are also theoretically appealing as they\nare minimally parameterized, with parameters corresponding to the chemically\nimportant concepts of electronegativities and chemical hardness. However, they\nare known to overestimate charge transfer for widely separated atoms, leading\nto qualitative errors in the predicted charge distribution and exaggerated\nelectrostatic properties. We present the charge transfer with polarization\ncurrent equilibration (QTPIE) model, which solves this problem by introducing\ndistance-dependent electronegativities. A graph-theoretic analysis of the\ntopology of charge transfer allows us to relate the fundamental quantities of\ncharge transfer back to the more familiar variables that represent atomic\npartial charges. This allows us to formulate a unified theoretical framework\nfor fluctuating-charge models and topological charge descriptors. We also\ndemonstrate the important role of charge screening effects in obtaining correct\nsize extensivity in electrostatic properties. Analyzing the spatial symmetries\nof these properties allows us to shed light on the role of charge conservation\nin the electronegativity equalization process. Finally, we develop a water\nmodel for use in classical molecular dynamics simulations that is capable of\ntreating both polarization and charge transfer phenomena.\n","Comment: Ph.

This generalises previous results in two\nsubstantial ways: We work in the setup of graded categories, i.e. we allow\ninfinitely many idempotents and also define a ``Koszul'' duality functor for\nnot necessarily Koszul categories. As an illustration of the techniques we\nreprove the Koszul duality of translation and Zuckerman functors for the\nclassical category O in a quite elementary and explicit way. As applications we\npropose a definition of a \"Koszul\" dual category for integral blocks of\nHarish-Chandra bimodules and for blocks outside the critical hyperplanes for\nthe Kac-Moody category O.\n","Comment: 50 pages, revised version to appear in Trans.
