This class of graphs includes the Cayley\ngraphs of amalgamated products, HNN extensions or general groups acting on\ntrees. It also includes all transitive graphs with more than one end. The idea\nof the method is to find a multi-type Galton--Watson branching process (with a\nparameter $p$) which has finite expected population size if and only if the\nexpected percolation cluster size is finite. This provides sufficient\ninformation about $p_c$. In particular, if the pairwise intersections of pieces\nare finite, then $p_c$ is the smallest positive $p$ such that $\\operatorname\n{det}(M-1)=0$, where $M$ is the first-moment matrix of the branching process.\nIf the pieces of the tree-like structure are finite, then $p_c$ is an algebraic\nnumber and we give an algorithm computing $p_c$ as a root of some algebraic\nfunction. We show that any Cayley graph of a virtually free group (i.e., a\ngroup acting on a tree with finite vertex stabilizers) with respect to any\nfinite generating set has a tree-like structure with finite pieces.

GRB 090510, a short burst, is\nparticularly interesting because the good timing allows to derive a severe\nlimit to theories of quantum gravity. With the dozen bursts detected in the\n0.1-30 GeV band so far, we start to see some common properties: (i) the\nduration is often longer than the duration of the softer emission detected by\nthe Gamma Burst Monitor (GBM) onboard Fermi; (ii) the spectrum is consistent\nwith F(v)~v^{-1} with no strong spectral evolution; (iii) for the brightest\nbursts, the flux detected by the LAT decays as a power law with a typical\nslope: t^{-1.5}; iv) the peak energy of the GBM emission exceeds 500 keV (rest\nframe). These properties suggest a similar process for the origin of the GeV\nflux. We propose that it is afterglow synchrotron emission shortly following\nthe start of the prompt phase. The steep decay slope suggests that the fireball\nemits in the radiative regime, i.e. all dissipated energy is radiated away. The\nlarge peak energy of the GBM flux suggests that electron-positron pairs might\nplay a crucial role. The rapid onset, but with some delay, of the GeV flux with\nrespect to the GBM one suggests that the bulk Lorentz factor Gamma of these\nbursts is of the order of 1000.
