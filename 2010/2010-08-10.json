These networks have gained immense\npopularity primarily due to their infrastructure-less mode of operation which\nmakes them a suitable candidate for deployment in emergency scenarios like\nrelief operation, battlefield etc., where either the pre-existing\ninfrastructure is totally damaged or it is not possible to establish a new\ninfrastructure quickly. However, MANETs are constrained due to the limited\ntransmission range of the mobile nodes which reduces the total coverage area.\nSometimes the infrastructure-less ad hoc network may be combined with a fixed\nnetwork to form a hybrid network which can cover a wider area with the\nadvantage of having less fixed infrastructure. In such a combined network, for\ntransferring data, we need base stations which act as gateways between the\nwired and wireless domains. Due to the hybrid nature of these networks, routing\nis considered a challenging task. Several routing protocols have been proposed\nand tested under various traffic conditions. However, the simulations of such\nrouting protocols usually do not consider the hybrid network scenario. In this\nwork we have carried out a systematic performance study of the two prominent\nrouting protocols: Destination Sequenced Distance Vector Routing (DSDV) and\nDynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocols in the hybrid networking environment.

This is surprising since the NIS has to search for small\nquantities of pathogens through larger physical spaces in larger organisms, and\nalso respond by producing larger absolute quantities of antibody in larger\norganisms.

(1-q^n) $$ and its analytic properties. To\nbegin with, we give an explicit formula for the Borel transform of the\nassociated formal power series $F(x)=e^{-1/(24x)}f(e^{-1/x})$ from which its\nanalytic continuation, its singularities and their structure can be manifestly\ndetermined. This gives rise to right/left and median summation of the original\npower series. These sums, which are well-defined in the open right half-plane\nare expressed by an integral formula involving the Dedekind eta function. The\nmedian sum can also be expressed as a series involving the complex error\nfunction. Moreover, it is shown using results of Zagier that the limiting\nvalues at $-1/(2 \\pi i \\a)$ for rational numbers $\\a$ coincide with $F(-1/(2\n\\pi i \\a))$. One motivation for studying the series $f(q)$ is Quantum Topology,\nwhich assigns numerical invariants to knotted 3-dimensional objects. Motivated\nby our results, we formulate a resurgence conjecture for the formal power\nseries of knotted objects, which we prove in the case of the trefoil knot and\nthe Poincare homology sphere, and more generally for torus knots and Seifert\nfibered 3-manifolds. In a subsequent publication we will study resurgence for a\nclass of power series that includes the quantum invariants of the simplest\nhyperbolic $4_1$ knot.\n","Comment: 23 pages with 2 figures"]}]
