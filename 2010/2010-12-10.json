Using N-body simulations we identify dark matter\nhalos over a broad mass range.

We find\nthat beta measured for a fixed halo mass is generally a function of scale even\non large scales, in contrast with the common expectation that beta approaches a\nconstant described by Kaiser's formula on such scales. The scale dependence\ndepends on the halo mass, being stronger for smaller halos. It also cannot be\neasily explained with the well-known distribution function of the halo peculiar\nvelocities. We demonstrate that the biasing for smaller halos has larger\nnonlinearity and stochasticity, thus the linear bias assumption becomes worse\nfor smaller halos.

This gives a consistent description of the quenching\nmechanism in mean-field dynamo models. The main goal of this work is to explore\nthe effects of this quenching mechanism in solar-like geometry, and in\nparticular to investigate the role of magnetic helicity fluxes, specifically\ndiffusive and Vishniac-Cho (VC) fluxes, at large magnetic Reynolds numbers\n(Rm). For models with negative radial shear or positive latitudinal shear, the\nmagnetic alpha effect has predominantly negative (positive) sign in the\nnorthern (southern) hemisphere. In the absence of fluxes, we find that the\nmagnetic energy follows an Rm^-1 dependence, as found in previous works. This\ncatastrophic quenching is alleviated in models with diffusive magnetic helicity\nfluxes resulting in magnetic fields comparable to the equipartition value even\nfor Rm=10^7. On the other hand, models with a shear-driven Vishniac-Cho flux\nshow an increase of the amplitude of the magnetic field with respect to models\nwithout fluxes, but only for Rm<10^4. This is mainly a consequence of assuming\na vacuum outside the Sun which cannot support a significant VC flux across the\nboundary. However, in contrast with the diffusive flux, the VC flux modifies\nthe distribution of the magnetic field. In addition, if an ill-determined\nscaling factor in the expression for the VC flux is large enough, subcritical\ndynamo action is possible that is driven by the action of shear and the\ndivergence of current helicity flux.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 12 figures.
