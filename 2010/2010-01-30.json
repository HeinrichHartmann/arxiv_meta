In this paper, according to the known\nconnections between MFPT, effective resistance, and the eigenvalues of graph\nLaplacian, we first study analytically the MFPT between all node pairs of a\nclass of growing treelike networks, which we term deterministic uniform\nrecursive trees (DURTs), since one of its particular cases is a deterministic\nversion of the famous uniform recursive tree. The interesting quantity is\ndetermined exactly through the recursive relation of the Laplacian spectra\nobtained from the special construction of DURTs. The analytical result shows\nthat the MFPT between all couples of nodes in DURTs varies as $N \\ln N$ for\nlarge networks with node number $N$. Second, we study trapping on a particular\nnetwork of DURTs, focusing on a special case with the immobile trap positioned\nat a node having largest degree. We determine exactly the average trapping time\n(ATT) that is defined as the average of FPT from all nodes to the trap. In\ncontrast to the scaling of the MFPT, the leading behavior of ATT is a linear\nfunction of $N$. Interestingly, we show that the behavior for ATT of the\ntrapping problem is related to the trapping location, which is in comparison\nwith the phenomenon of trapping on fractal T-graph although both networks\nexhibit treestructure. Finally, we believe that the methods could open the way\nto exactly calculate the MFPT and ATT in a wide range of deterministic media.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 6 figures, definitive version published in Physical Review E"]}]

Alternatively, if a\nbounded continuous kernel is translation-invariant on $\\bb{R}^d$, then it is\ncharacteristic if and only if the support of its Fourier transform is the\nentire $\\bb{R}^d$.

Studies of the Hall and\nthermoelectric responses indicate that Ni substitution in this system results\nin a dominant electron-like response, consistent with electron doping in other\nsimilar systems but with a weaker change in the Hall coefficient and a more\ngradual change in the thermoelectric response with Ni concentration. For\noptimally doped samples with full superconducting volume fraction, the lower\nand upper critical fields were determined to be Hc1(1.8 K)= 0.08T and Hc2(0)=\n25T, respectively, with lower-Tc samples showing reduced values and indications\nof inhomogeneous superconductivity. Comparable to other higher-Tc FeAs-based\nmaterials, the temperature dependence of the upper critical field, dHc2/dT, is\nlinear over a wide temperature range, and the large values of Hc2(0) greatly\nexceed conventional estimates of paramagnetic and orbital limits.\n","Comment: 9 pgs, 10 figs, slightly revised, updated references"]}]

In this way, one is given the possibility of\nusing a rather simple quantum equation to describe the decoherence effects due\nto dissipation. Namely, the mere introduction (not of a \"time-lattice\", but\nsimply) of a \"chronon\" allows us to go on from differential to\nfinite-difference equations; and in particular to write down the\nquantum-theoretical equations (Schroedinger equation, Liouville--von Neumann\nequation,...) in three different ways: \"retarded\", \"symmetrical\", and\n\"advanced\". One of such three formulations --the retarded one-- describes in an\nelementary way a system which is exchanging (and losing) energy with the\nenvironment; and in its density-matrix version, indeed, it can be easily shown\nthat all non-diagonal terms go to zero very rapidly.
