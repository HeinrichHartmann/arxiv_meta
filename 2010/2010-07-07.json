The pressure pulse stretch-modulates voltage-gated Na (Nav) channels\nembedded in the axon membrane, causing their accelerated activation and\ninactivation and increasing peak channel conductance. As a result, the action\npotential propagates due to mechano-electrical activation of Nav channels by\nstraggling ionic currents and the axoplasmic pressure pulse. The velocity of\nsuch propagation is higher than in the classical purely electrical Nav\nactivation mechanism, and it may be close to the velocity of propagation of\npressure pulses in the axoplasm. Extracellular Ca ions influxing during the\nvoltage spike, or Ca ions released from intracellular stores, may trigger a\nmechanism that generates and augments the pressure pulse, thus opposing its\nviscous decay.

Confinement is induced by two\nparallel planar hard walls (slit-pore geometry), with particle long axes\nperpendicular to the walls (perfect homeotropic anchoring). In bulk, a\ncontinuous nematic-to-smectic transition takes place, while shape anisotropy in\nthe (rectangular) particle cross section induces biaxial ordering. As a\nconsequence, four bulk phases, uniaxial and biaxial nematic and smectic phases,\ncan be stabilised as the cross-sectional aspect ratio is varied. On confining\nthe fluid, the nematic-to-smectic transition is suppressed, and either uniaxial\nor biaxial phases, separated by a continuous trasition, can be present. Smectic\nordering develops continuously from the walls for increasing particle\nconcentration (in agreement with the supression of nematic-smectic second order\ntransition at confinement), but first-order layering transitions, involving\nstructures with n and n+1 layers, arise in the confined fluid at high\nconcentration. Competition between layering and uniaxial-biaxial ordering leads\nto three different types of layering transitions, at which the two coexisting\nstructures can be both uniaxial, one uniaxial and another biaxial, or both\nbiaxial. Also, the interplay between molecular biaxiality and wall interactions\nis very subtle: while the hard wall disfavours the formation of the biaxial\nphase, biaxiality is against the layering transitions, as we have shown by\ncomparing the confined phase behaviour of cylinders and cuboids.

In the\nclassical formulation, n men and n women express their preferences (via a\nstrict total order) over the members of the other sex. Solving a SM problem\nmeans finding a stable marriage where stability is an envy-free notion: no man\nand woman who are not married to each other would both prefer each other to\ntheir partners or to being single. We consider both the classical stable\nmarriage problem and one of its useful variations (denoted SMTI) where the men\nand women express their preferences in the form of an incomplete preference\nlist with ties over a subset of the members of the other sex. Matchings are\npermitted only with people who appear in these lists, an we try to find a\nstable matching that marries as many people as possible. Whilst the SM problem\nis polynomial to solve, the SMTI problem is NP-hard. We propose to tackle both\nproblems via a local search approach, which exploits properties of the problems\nto reduce the size of the neighborhood and to make local moves efficiently. We\nevaluate empirically our algorithm for SM problems by measuring its runtime\nbehaviour and its ability to sample the lattice of all possible stable\nmarriages. We evaluate our algorithm for SMTI problems in terms of both its\nruntime behaviour and its ability to find a maximum cardinality stable\nmarriage.For SM problems, the number of steps of our algorithm grows only as\nO(nlog(n)), and that it samples very well the set of all stable marriages. It\nis thus a fair and efficient approach to generate stable marriages.Furthermore,\nour approach for SMTI problems is able to solve large problems, quickly\nreturning stable matchings of large and often optimal size despite the\nNP-hardness of this problem.\n","Comment: 12 pages, Proc.

Model responses to\nmultiple frequency stimuli are shown in agreement with hearing experiments. A\nnonlinear spectrum is computed from the model, and compared with FFT spectrum\nfor noisy tonal inputs. The discretized model is efficient and accurate, and\ncan serve as a useful auditory signal processing tool.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 9 figures"]}]
