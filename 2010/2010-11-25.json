Atomic multiplet, cluster diagonalization,\nand density-functional calculations were performed to simulate the pre-edge\nabsorption spectra, showing good qualitative agreement with the measurements.\nThe mechanism for the pressure-induced phase transitions of Fe$_2$O$_3$ is\ndiscussed and it is shown that ligand hybridization significantly reduces the\ncritical high-spin/low-spin pressure.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures and 1 table"]}]

All protocols\nhave polynomial complexity and require private channels and a simultaneous\nbroadcast channel. Unlike previously proposed protocols in this model, the\nprotocols that we present deterministically output the exact tally. Our first\nprotocol is a basic voting scheme which allows voters to interact in order to\ncompute the tally. Privacy of the ballot is unconditional in the sense that\nregardless of the behavior of the dishonest participants nothing can be learned\nthrough the protocol that could not be learned in an ideal realisation.\nUnfortunately, a single dishonest participant can make the protocol abort, in\nwhich case the dishonest participants can nevertheless learn the outcome of the\ntally. Our second protocol introduces voting authorities which improves the\ncommunication complexity by limiting interaction to be only between voters and\nauthorities and among the authorities themselves; the simultaneous broadcast is\nalso limited to the authorities. In the second protocol, as long as a single\nauthority is honest, the privacy is unconditional, however, a single corrupt\nauthority or a single corrupt voter can cause the protocol to abort. Our final\nprotocol provides a safeguard against corrupt voters by enabling a verification\ntechnique to allow the authorities to revoke incorrect votes without aborting\nthe protocol. Finally, we discuss the implementation of a simultaneous\nbroadcast channel with the use of temporary computational assumptions, yielding\nversions of our protocols that achieve everlasting security.\n"]}]

For this purpose, we\nhave developed radiation hydrodynamic 2D model atmosphere simulations to study\nthe formation of forsterite dust in presence of advection, condensation, and\nsedimentation across the M-L-T VLMs to BDs sequence (Teff = 2800 K to 900 K,\nFreytag et al. 2010).

Cosmological effects on a\nquantum system can be explored in one approach by considering an object at rest\nin space with a universal Hubble expansion taking place away from it, and\ndeveloping a Schroedinger type governing differential equation incorporating an\nintrinsic expansion speed. Wave function solutions to this governing equation\nexhibit pronounced central localization. The extent of concentration of\nprobability depends on mass; objects with small masses tend to behave in a\ndelocalized manner as ordinary quantum objects do in a static space, while\nquantum objects with large masses are concentrated into much smaller regions.\nTo develop a criterion for classicality, we consider that if the size of the\nlocalized region of concentrated probability density is larger than the size of\nthe corresponding extended object, then quantum behavior could be expected;\nwhereas if the region of high probability density for the location of the\ncenter of mass is smaller than the size of the object, the object would behave\nin a more classical manner. The resultant size threshold for classicality\naccords with results of other studies examining these issues based on\nuncertainty relations and wave packets. This size threshold is informative for\nthe case of compact extended objects and, as the constraint applies to the\ncenter of mass of the system, does not lead to inconsistencies for quantum\ncorrelations between distant entangled quantum objects.

Helpers are heterogenous \"micro-servers\" with limited\nstorage, bandwidth and number of users they can serve simultaneously. Our\nproposed system has the following salient features: (1) it minimizes the server\nload; (2) it is distributed, and requires little or no maintenance overhead and\nwhich can easily adapt to system dynamics; and (3) it is adaptable to varying\nsupply and demand patterns across multiple video channels irrespective of video\npopularity. Our proposed solution jointly optimizes over helper-user topology,\nvideo storage allocation and bandwidth allocation. The combinatorial nature of\nthe problem and the system demand for distributed algorithms makes the problem\nuniquely challenging. By utilizing Lagrangian decomposition and Markov chain\napproximation based arguments, we address this challenge by designing two\ndistributed algorithms running in tandem: a primal-dual storage and bandwidth\nallocation algorithm and a \"soft-worst-neighbor-choking\" topology-building\nalgorithm. Our scheme provably converges to a near-optimal solution, and is\neasy to implement in practice. Simulation results validate that the proposed\nscheme achieves minimum sever load under highly heterogeneous combinations of\nsupply and demand patterns, and is robust to system dynamics of user/helper\nchurn, user/helper asynchrony, and random delays in the network.\n"]}]

By considering the high drilling cost and\nthe potential improvement in well productivity, well placement decision is an\nimportant issue in field development. Considering complex reservoir geology and\nhigh reservoir heterogeneities, stochastic optimization methods are the most\nsuitable approaches for optimum well placement. This paper proposes an\noptimization methodology to determine optimal well location and trajectory\nbased upon the Covariance Matrix Adaptation - Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) which\nis a variant of Evolution Strategies recognized as one of the most powerful\nderivative-free optimizers for continuous optimization. To improve the\noptimization procedure, two new techniques are investigated: (1). Adaptive\npenalization with rejection is developed to handle well placement constraints.\n(2). A meta-model, based on locally weighted regression, is incorporated into\nCMA-ES using an approximate ranking procedure. Therefore, we can reduce the\nnumber of reservoir simulations, which are computationally expensive. Several\nexamples are presented. Our new approach is compared with a Genetic Algorithm\nincorporating the Genocop III technique. It is shown that our approach\noutperforms the genetic algorithm: it leads in general to both a higher NPV and\na significant reduction of the number of reservoir simulations.\n","Comment: ECMOR XII - 12 th European Conference on the Mathematics of Oil\n  Recovery, Oxford : Royaume-Uni (2010)"]}]
