The expansion of the corrosion product is\nrepresented by an eigenstrain in the lattice elements forming the interface.\nThe lattice modelling approach is applied to the analysis of corrosion induced\ncracking and its influence of the bond strength. The model capabilities are\nassessed by comparing results of analyses with those from unconfined pull-out\ntests reported in the literature.

This type of roughness is common in magnetic\nmultilayers. When the electronic mean free paths are small compared to the\nlayer thicknesses, the current flow is non-uniform, and the resistance\ndecreases in the Current-Perpendicular-to-Plane (CPP) configuration and\nincreases in the Current-In-Plane (CIP) configuration. For mean free paths much\nlonger than the layer thicknesses, the current flow is uniform, and the\nresistance increases in both the CPP and CIP configurations due to enhanced\nsurface scattering. In both the CPP and CIP geometries, the giant\nmagnetoresistance can be either enhanced or reduced by the presence of long\nlength scale interface roughness depending on the parameters. Finally, the\nchanges in the CPP and CIP resistivities due to increasing interface roughness\nare estimated using experimentally determined parameters.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 10 figures"]}]
