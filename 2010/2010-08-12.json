Instead of directly manipulating each qubit to perform universal\nquantum logic gates or measurements, ADQC uses a fixed two-qubit interaction to\ncouple the memory register of a quantum computer to an ancilla qubit. By\nmeasuring the ancilla, the measurement-induced back-action on the system\nperforms the desired logical operations.\n  By demanding that the ancilla-system qubit interaction should lead to unitary\nand stepwise deterministic evolution, and that it should be possible to\nstandardise the computation, that is, applying all global operations at the\nbeginning, we are able to place conditions on the interactions that can be used\nfor ADQC.

Moreover, we can verify liveness properties\nfor real-time systems, which is not possible by using induction with infinite\nstate model checkers.

In proof complexity, these resources\ncorrespond to the length and space of resolution proofs. There has been a long\nline of research investigating these proof complexity measures, but while\nstrong results have been established for length, our understanding of space and\nhow it relates to length has remained quite poor. In particular, the question\nwhether resolution proofs can be optimized for length and space simultaneously,\nor whether there are trade-offs between these two measures, has remained\nessentially open.\n  In this paper, we remedy this situation by proving a host of length-space\ntrade-off results for resolution. Our collection of trade-offs cover almost the\nwhole range of values for the space complexity of formulas, and most of the\ntrade-offs are superpolynomial or even exponential and essentially tight. Using\nsimilar techniques, we show that these trade-offs in fact extend to the\nexponentially stronger k-DNF resolution proof systems, which operate with\nformulas in disjunctive normal form with terms of bounded arity k. We also\nanswer the open question whether the k-DNF resolution systems form a strict\nhierarchy with respect to space in the affirmative.\n  Our key technical contribution is the following, somewhat surprising,\ntheorem: Any CNF formula F can be transformed by simple variable substitution\ninto a new formula F' such that if F has the right properties, F' can be proven\nin essentially the same length as F, whereas on the other hand the minimal\nnumber of lines one needs to keep in memory simultaneously in any proof of F'\nis lower-bounded by the minimal number of variables needed simultaneously in\nany proof of F. Applying this theorem to so-called pebbling formulas defined in\nterms of pebble games on directed acyclic graphs, we obtain our results.\n","Comment: This paper is a merged and updated version of the two ECCC technical\n  reports TR09-034 and TR09-047, and it hence subsumes these two reports"]}]

However, it is not yet resolved how\nstoichiometry should be integrated in population dynamical models, as different\nmodeling approaches are found to yield qualitatively different results. Here we\ninvestigate a unifying framework that reveals the differences and commonalities\nbetween previously proposed models for producer-grazer systems. Our analysis\nreveals that stoichiometric constraints affect the dynamics mainly by\nincreasing the intraspecific competition between producers and by introducing a\nvariable biomass conversion efficiency. The intraspecific competition has a\nstrongly stabilizing effect on the system, whereas the variable conversion\nefficiency resulting from a variable food quality is the main determinant for\nthe nature of the instability once destabilization occurs. Only if the food\nquality is high an oscillatory instability, as in the classical paradox of\nenrichment, can occur. While the generalized model reveals that the generic\ninsights remain valid in a large class of models, we show that other details\nsuch as the specific sequence of bifurcations encountered in enrichment\nscenarios can depend sensitively on assumptions made in modeling stoichiometric\nconstraints.\n","Comment: Online appendixes included"]}]

The most prominent\nexample is the Moore-Read model for the $\\nu=5/2$ state, in which the ground\nstate is a superconductor of composite fermions, and the charged excitations\nare vortices in that superconductor. In this paper we develop a physical\npicture of the nonabelian statistics of these vortices. Considering first the\npositions of the vortices as fixed, we define a set of single-particle states\nat and near the core of each vortex, and employ general properties of the\ncorresponding Bogolubov-deGennes equations to write the ground states in the\nFock space defined by these single-particle states. We find all ground states\nto be entangled superpositions of all possible occupations of the\nsingle-particle states near the vortex cores, in which the probability for all\noccupations is equal, and the relative phases vary from one ground state to\nanother. Then, we examine the evolution of the ground states as the positions\nof the vortices are braided. We find that as vortices move, they accumulate a\ngeometric phase that depends on the occupations of the single-particle states\nnear the cores of other vortices. Thus, braiding of vortices changes the\nrelative phase between different components of a superposition, in which the\noccupations of the single-particle states differ, and hence transform the\nsystem from one ground state to another. These transformations are the source\nof the nonabelian statistics. Finally, by exploring a \"self-similar\" form of\nthe many-body wave functions of the ground states, we show the equivalence of\nour picture and pictures derived previously, in which vortex braiding seemingly\naffects the occupations of states in the cores of the vortices.\n","Comment: 16 pages"]}]
