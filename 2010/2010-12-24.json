Polarization control in the soft\nX-ray region from linear to circular is highly desirable. Several schemes using\nhelical undulators have been discussed for the LCLS. One consists in replacing\nthree of the last planar undulator segments by APPLE III. A second proposal,\nthe 2nd harmonic helical afterburner, uses short, crossed undulators tuned to\nthe second harmonic. This last scheme is expected to be the better one. Its\nadvantages are a high and stable degree of circular polarization and a low\ncost. Its disadvantage is a small output power and a narrow wavelength range.\nWe propose a novel method to generate 10 GW level power at the fundamental\nharmonic with 99% degree of circular polarization from the LCLS baseline.

After the baseline\nundulator, the electron beam is sent through a 40 m long straight section, and\nsubsequently passes through a short APPLE II radiator. The microbunch structure\nis easily preserved, and intense coherent radiation is emitted in the helical\nradiator.

Using thin Beryllium foils for the\nslits the divergence of the electron beam halo increases by Coulomb scattering,\nbut the beam will propagate through the setup without electron losses.
