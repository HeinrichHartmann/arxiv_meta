Recent studies have shown that\nessentially two different outcomes are possible. Either the species surviving\ncompetition are more or less uniformly distributed over the resource spectrum,\nor their distribution is 'lumped' (or 'clumped'), consisting of clusters of\nspecies with similar resource use that are separated by gaps in resource space.\nWhich of these outcomes will occur crucially depends on the competition kernel,\nwhich reflects the shape of the resource utilization pattern of the competing\nspecies. Most models considered in the literature assume a Gaussian competition\nkernel. This is unfortunate, since predictions based on such a Gaussian\nassumption are not robust. In fact, Gaussian kernels are a border case\nscenario, and slight deviations from this function can lead to either uniform\nor lumped species distributions.

While the\npacking density $\\rho$ displays glass-like slow relaxations (aging) and\nhistory-dependence (memory) at low tapping amplitudes, the susceptibility\n$\\tilde{\\chi}_v$ displays very weak aging effects, and its spectrum shows no\nsign of a rapidly growing timescale.

The type I see-saw part of the neutrino\nmass matrix, which controls the mass squared differences and mixing angles, may\nbe governed by sequential right-handed neutrino dominance and a natural\nalignment for the SO(3)-breaking vacuum. We focus on classes of models with\nbi-large mixing originating from the neutrino mass matrix although we also\nbriefly discuss other classes of models where large mixing stems from the\ncharged lepton mass matrix. We study renormalization group corrections to the\nneutrino mass squared differences and mixings and find that the low energy\nvalues do not depend sensitively on the high energy values for partially\ndegenerate neutrinos with a mass scale up to about 0.15 eV. Our scenario\npredicts the effective mass for neutrinoless double beta decay to be\napproximately equal to the neutrino mass scale and therefore neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay will be observable if the neutrino mass spectrum is partially\ndegenerate. We also find that all observable CP phases as well as $\\theta_{13}$\nbecome small as the neutrino mass scale increases.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 10 figures; minor corrections; version published in Nucl.\n  Phys.

Our results are within the\nclassification of homogeneous quaternionic scalar manifolds. In the minimal\ncoupling of a generation of bulk matter hypermultiplets, supergravity requires\nthe field content of an SO(10) scenario. In the minimal coupling of $n$ bulk\ngenerations of matter and higgs hypermultiplets, supergravity requires the\nfield content of an E(6) scenario.\n  We also discuss the coupling of tensors and non-compact gaugings in 5D\nYMESGTs, which can serve as alternative ways to obtain four-dimensional Higgs\nsectors. Charged tensor couplings seem to be difficult to work with\nphenomenologically since a U(1) gauge factor is always required when they are\npresent, and it is not clear if tensors can be put in unified multiplets with\nother fields, if this is desired. This seems to imply that tensor coulpings in\nGUT scenarios may be better suited in higher dimensional settings. The\nnon-compact gaugings discussed here are simple, and offer a novel unification\nscenario in which the supergravity and vector multiplets are connected by gauge\ntransformations.\n  The main points are summarized in tables and the conclusion. Although the\ndiscussion is in the spirit of a \"bottom-up\" approach, M-theory is taken as a\nmotivating background.\n","Comment: V.2 Significant changes: shortened, typos corrected, main focus of\n  paper emphasized.

By\ngeneralizing the constraint condition proposed by Susskind to realize the\nPauli's exclusion principle in this two component matrix model, the classical\nexciton solution having excitation of both quasi-electron and quasi-hole is\nobtained. The constraint condition is also solved quantum mechanically in the\ninfinite-sized matrix case, giving the examples of the physical states. Using\nthese quantum states, the corrections of the exciton energy, coming from the\nnoncommutativity of space (Pauli principle) and from the quantum effects of the\nbackground state, are estimated in the lowest order perturbation expansion. As\na result, the dispersion relation of exciton is obtained.\n","Comment: 26 pages, Latex, No figures, Some comments and an appendix are added,\n  results are unchanged"]}]

To demonstrate the advantages of the algebraic\nmethod of analytical evaluation of multi-loop Feynman diagrams, we calculate\nladder diagrams for the massless $\\phi^3$ theory. Using our algebraic approach\nwe show that the problem of evaluation of special classes of Feynman diagrams\nreduces to the calculation of the Green functions for specific quantum\nmechanical problems. In particular, the integrals for ladder massless diagrams\nin the $\\phi^3$ scalar field theory are given by the Green function for the\nconformal quantum mechanics.\n","Comment: 15 pages, Latex, corrected some typos and list of Refs"]}]

As well known, at large N the k-string consists,\nto leading order, of k noninteracting fundamental strings, so that sigma_k=k\nsigma_1. We argue, both from field-theory and string-theory side, that\nsubleading corrections to this formula run in powers of 1/N^2 rather than 1/N,\nthus excluding the Casimir scaling. We suggest a heuristic model allowing one\nto relate the k-string tension in four-dimensional gluodynamics with the\ntension of the BPS domain walls (k-walls). In this model the domain walls are\nmade of a net of strings connected to each other by baryon vertices. The\nrelation emerging in this way leads to the sine formula sigma_ k ~ Lambda^2 N\nsin pi k/N. We discuss possible corrections to the sine law, and present\narguments that they are suppressed by 1/k factors. We explain why the sine law\ndoes not hold in two dimensions. Finally, we discuss the applicability of the\nsine formula for non-supersymmetric orientifold field theories.\n","Comment: 21 pages, Latex. 5 figures. v2: a factor of 2 was corrected in\n  eq.(A.3).

An exact\ncalculation in F allows us to apply the SW map, reducing the maximal abelian\npoint of view to a minimal nonabelian point of view (replacing 1/F with [X,X]\nat large F), resulting in matrix model equations of motion. We first study\nderivative corrections to the abelian BI action and compute the 2-loop beta\nfunction for an open string in a WZW (parallelizable) background. This beta\nfunction is the first step in the process of computing string equations of\nmotion, which can be later obtained by computing the Weyl anomaly coefficients\nor the partition function. The beta function is exact in F and computed to\norders O(H,H^2,H^3) (H=dB and curvature is R ~ H^2) and O(DF,D^2F,D^3F).

Our gauging procedure uses off-shell\nsuperfields and so is manifestly supersymmetric. We focus on N=4 supersymmetric\nmechanics and show that various actions of the multiplet (3,4,1) amount to some\ngauge choices in the gauged superfield actions of the linear or nonlinear\n(4,4,0) multiplets. In particular, the conformally invariant (3,4,1)\nsuperpotential is generated by the Fayet-Iliopoulos term of the gauge\nsuperfield. We find a new nonlinear variant of the multiplet (4,4,0), such that\nits simplest superfield action produces the most general 4-dim hyper-K\\\"ahler\nmetric with one triholomorphic isometry as the bosonic target metric. We also\nelaborate on some other instructive examples of N=4 superfield gaugings,\nincluding a non-abelian gauging which relates the free linear (4,4,0) multiplet\nto a self-interacting (1,4,3) multiplet.\n","Comment: 32 pages, minor amendments in Sect. 2, version to appear in Nucl.\n  Phys.
