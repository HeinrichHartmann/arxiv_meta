First, what is the_geography_ of branch curves among\nall nodal-cuspidal curves? Second: what is the_geometry_ of branch curves? In\nother words, how can one distinguish a branch curve from a non-branch curve\nwith the same numerical invariants? For example, a plane sextic curve with six\ncusps is known to be a branch curve of a generic projection iff its six cusps\nlie on a conic curve, i.e., form a special 0-cycle on the plane.\n  We start with reviewing what is known about the answers to these two\nquestions, mentioning both simple and some non-trivial results. We continue\nwith study of classical work of Beniamino Segre which gives a complete answer\nto the second question in the case when S is a smooth surface in a\nthree-dimensional projective space. We give an interpretation of Segre's work\nin terms of a study of Picard group of 0-cycles on a singular plane curve B.\n  We also review examples of small degree.\n  The Appendix written by Eugenii Shustin shows the existence of many new\nZariski pairs of plane curves.\n  We hope to continue this paper with a generalization to the case of smooth\nsurfaces in a projective space of any dimension.\n","Comment: Minor changes.

An outstanding question is whether the\nwidely-installed TCP Reno is compatible with adaptive CSMA and can achieve the\nsame result.

Any\ncognitive process is based on (at least) two time scales: precognitive time\nscale (which is very fine) and cognitive time scale (which is essentially\ncoarser).\n  To couple our model to physiology, behavioral science, and psychology, we\nconsider a number of known fundamental time scales in the brain.
