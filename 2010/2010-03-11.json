Our results justify the (ultra)slow\nfluctuating rate view of the corresponding bistable non-Markovian dynamics\nwhich displays bursting and anti-correlation of the residence times in two\npotential wells. The transition kinetics is asymptotically\nstretched-exponential when the potential barrier $V_0$ several times exceeds\nthermal energy $k_BT$ ($V_0\\sim 2 - 10 k_BT$) and it cannot be described by the\nnon-Markovian rate theory (NMRT). The well-known NMRT result approximates,\nhowever, ever better with the increasing barrier height, the most probable\nlogarithm of the residence times. Moreover, the rate description is gradually\nrestored when the barrier height exceeds a fuzzy borderline which depends on\nthe power law exponent of free subdiffusion $\\alpha$. Such a potential-free\nsubdiffusion is ergodic. Surprisingly, in periodic potentials it is not\nsensitive to the barrier height in the long time asymptotic limit. However, the\ntransient to this asymptotic regime is extremally slow and it does profoundly\ndepend on the barrier height. The time-scale of such subdiffusion can exceed\nthe mean residence time in a potential well, or in a finite spatial domain by\nmany orders of magnitude. All these features are in sharp contrast with an\nalternative subdiffusion mechanism involving jumps among traps with the\ndivergent mean residence time in these traps.\n"]}]

Despite the low SNR, the data show that the intensity of the three\nmost prominent emission lines, already detected in 2001, varies with the phase.\nThese lines are detected at phases 0.2-0.6 where the optical emission peaks,\nand marginally detected or not detected at all elsewhere. Moreover, the FWHM of\nthe emission lines in the phase resolved spectra is smaller, by almost a factor\n2, than that in the the phase-averaged 2001 spectrum. Our results are\nconsistent with both the pulsed optical component and emission lines\noriginating in the same region which we identify with the irradiated surface of\nthe secondary.

The description of energy state of a gas\nparticle was completed with the term corresponding with the potential-type\nenergy. The necessity of such the term is set by the demand of convergence of\nthe relativistic particle-impulse distribution law to its Maxwell-Boltzmann\nform in the classical limit.\n  The identity of the ES and RETE, both applied to the gas in the object's\nsurface layer, becomes perfect, yielding the stable object, when the object's\nphysical radius is identical to its gravitational radius. In this state, the\ninternal energy of gas particles in a volume of the object's surface layer\nincreases over all limits in the frame of the volume and this opens the\nquestion if the horizon of events actually is an insuperable barrier. It seems\nto be possible that some matter can be temporarily lifted above the surface or,\nso far, be ejected from the object and can emit a radiation detectable by a\ndistant observer.\n  In our contribution, we demonstrate a general validity of the functional form\nof the potential-type energy found in our previous work. The consistency of the\nRETE with its non-relativistic approximation can occur only for this functional\nform. We also point out some observational consequences of the approximate\nidentity of ES and RETE before the object collapses, in the proper time, to its\ngravitational radius as well as the possible observational consequences of the\ninfinitely high internal energy in the surface layer of already collapsed\nobject. In general, we propagate the idea that a lot of phenomena observed at\nthe stellar-sized or supermassive black holes (or not-yet black holes) can be\nnot necessarily related to the structures in a vicinity of the black hole, e.g.\nto an accretion disk, but they can be linked directly to the behaviour of the\ncentral, ultra-compact object.\n","Comment: The poster presented at the conference \"Probing Strong Gravity near\n  Black Holes\" held in Prague, February 15-18, 2010.

Any process which leads to emission of fragments\nor $\\gamma$'s breaks coherence in diffractive processes. Therefore this is\nequivalent to non-detection of rapidity gaps in pp collisions. For example, in\ncoherent photoproduction of vector mesons their 4-momentum transfer\ndistribution would image the \"gluon charge\" in the nucleus in the same way that\nHofstadter measured its charge structure using elastic scattering of $\\sim$100\nMeV electrons. Whereas he could measure the $\\sim$4 MeV energy loss by the\nelectron due to excitation of nuclear energy levels (Figure 1), even the energy\nspread of the incident beam would prevent such an inclusive selection of\nquasielastic events at an eIC. The only available tool is fragment detection.\nSince, in our example, one finds that $\\sim100$ of deexcitations go through\n$\\gamma$'s or 1 neutron, rarely to 2 neutron and never to protons(due to\nCoulomb barrier suppression), the eIC design should emphasize their detection.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 6 figures"]}]

This is\nof practical experimental relevance; to avoid a selection of the relative\nimpulse length by trial and error, it is advised to investigate whether the\nused control scheme itself shows systematic limitations on the choice of the\nimpulse length. To investigate this point, a Floquet analysis is performed. For\nOGY control the influence of the impulse length is marginal.
