If this\nconservation law is broken by some non-standard interactions, electron\nneutrinos are converted to muon and tau-neutrinos, and electrons -- to muons.\nThis affects the supernova dynamics and the supernova neutrino signal in\nseveral ways.

This effect may have important consequences as the increase of the\nneutrino luminosity is known to facilitate the explosion.

The serial release of these data to partner institutions or\ndata analysis centers is a common situation. In this paper we show that, in\nmost domains, correlations among sensitive values associated to the same\nindividuals in different releases can be easily mined, and used to violate\nusers' privacy by adversaries observing multiple data releases. We provide a\nformal model for privacy attacks based on this sequential background knowledge,\nas well as on background knowledge on the probability distribution of sensitive\nvalues over different individuals. We show how sequential background knowledge\ncan be actually obtained by an adversary, and used to identify with high\nconfidence the sensitive values associated with an individual. A defense\nalgorithm based on Jensen-Shannon divergence is proposed, and extensive\nexperiments show the superiority of the proposed technique with respect to\nother applicable solutions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nwork that systematically investigates the role of sequential background\nknowledge in serial release of transaction data.\n"]}]

This\nnetwork information flow is termed a MIMO Gaussian $K$-way relay channel. For\nthis channel, we show that $\\frac{K}{2}$ degrees of freedom is achievable if\n$M=K-1$.

If a sensor node fails\nduring data aggregation then the aggregation tree is disconnected.

For this purpose we introduce a certain\nquasi-estimator that, in contrast to usual estimator, produces two alternative\nestimates. It is proved that, in comparison to the least squares estimate, one\nalternative has a significantly smaller quadratic risk, retaining at the same\ntime unbiasedness and consistency. These properties hold true for\none-dimensional, multi-dimensional, orthogonal and non-orthogonal problems.\nMoreover, a Monte-Carlo simulation confirms high robustness of the\nquasi-estimator to violations of the initial assumptions. Therefore, at the\nfirst stage of the estimation we calculate mentioned two alternative estimates.\nAt the second stage we choose the better estimate out of these alternatives. In\norder to do so we use additional information, among it but not exclusively of a\npriori nature. In case of two alternatives the volume of such information\nshould be minimal. Furthermore, the additional information is not built-in into\nthe quasi-estimator structure, so that any kind of information, even intuitive\none, can be used. These features, in combination with decrease of the quadratic\nrisk, provide a great advantage of our method. A variety of types of the\nadditional information for choosing the better estimate is considered.
