At thermal equilibrium\nsuperdiffusive behavior can emerge if the total integral of the memory kernel\nvanishes. Such a situation of vanishing static friction is caused by a\nsuper-Ohmic thermal bath. One of the simplest models of ballistic\nsuperdiffusion is determined by a bi-exponential memory kernel that was\nproposed by Bao [J.-D. Bao, J. Stat. Phys. 114, 503 (2004)]. We show that this\nnon-Markovian model has infinitely many different 4-dimensional Markovian\nembeddings. Implementing numerically the simplest one, we demonstrate that (i)\nthe presence of a periodic potential with arbitrarily low barriers changes the\nasymptotic large time behavior from free ballistic superdiffusion into normal\ndiffusion; (ii) an additional biasing force renders the asymptotic dynamics\nsuperdiffusive again. The development of transients that display a\nqualitatively different behavior compared to the true large-time asymptotics\npresents a general feature of this non-Markovian dynamics. These transients\nthough may be extremely long. As a consequence, they can be even mistaken as\nthe true asymptotics.
