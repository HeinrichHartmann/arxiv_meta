We also present a CXRB spectral model in a wider energy band\n(1.5-200 keV), obtained by combining these data with the recently published\nSwift-BAT measurement. From the XRT archive we collect a complete sample of 126\nhigh Galactic latitude gamma-ray burst (GRB) follow-up observations. This\nprovides a total exposure of 7.5 Ms and a sky-coverage of 7 square degrees\nwhich represents a serendipitous survey, well suited for a direct measurement\nof the CXRB in the 1.5-10 keV interval. Our work is based on a complete\ncharacterization of the instrumental background and an accurate measurement of\nthe stray-light contamination and vignetting calibration. We find that the CXRB\nspectrum in the 1.5-7 keV energy band can be equally well fitted by a single\npower-law with photon index Gamma=1.47+/-0.07 or a single power-law with photon\nindex Gamma=1.41+/-0.06 and an exponential roll-off at 41 keV. The measured\nflux in the 2-10 keV energy band is 2.18+/-0.13 E-11 erg/(cm2 s deg2) in the\n2-10 keV band. Combining Swift-XRT with Swift-BAT (15-200 keV) we find that, in\nthe 1.5-200 keV band, the CXRB spectrum can be well described by two\nsmoothly-joined power laws with the energy break at 29.0+/-0.5 keV\ncorresponding to a nu F_nu peak located at 22.4+/-0.4 keV. Taking advantage of\nboth the Swift high energy instruments (XRT and BAT), we produce an analytical\ndescription of the CXRB spectrum over a wide (1.5-200 keV) energy band. This\nmodel is marginally consistent with the HEAO1 measurement (~10% higher at\nenergies higher than 20 keV, while it is significantly (30%) higher at low\nenergies (2-10 keV).\n","Comment: Accepted for publication by A&A; 9 pages, 11 figures.

Kondo at zero momentum between the\nZwanziger's horizon function, the ghost dressing function and Kugo's functions\n$u$ and $w$. We agree with this result as far as bare quantities are\nconsidered.

We find that the stellar disk\nout to 5.4 kpc is primarily old, in contrast with the outwardly similar galaxy\nM33. We determine the scale length as a function of age and find evidence for\ninside-out growth of the stellar disk: the scale length has increased from 1.1\n+/- 0.1 kpc 10 Gyr ago to 1.3 +/- 0.1 kpc at present, indicating a buildup in\nthe fraction of young stars at larger radii. As the scale length of M33 has\nrecently been shown to have increased much more dramatically with time, our\nresults demonstrate that two galaxies with similar sizes and morphologies can\nhave very different histories. With an N-body simulation of a galaxy designed\nto be similar to NGC 300, we determine that the effects of radial migration\nshould be minimal.

It uses electrical scattering matrices and\nnoise wave vectors to describe receiver architectures of arbitrary topology and\ncomplexity. It differs from existing freely-available software mainly in that\nthe scattering matrices used to describe the receiver and its components are\nanalytic rather than numeric. This allows different types of modeling and\nanalysis of receivers to be performed. Non-ideal behavior of receiver\ncomponents can be parameterized in their scattering matrices. SNS enables the\ninstrument designer to then derive analytic expressions for the signal and\nnoise at the receiver outputs in terms of parameterized component\nimperfections, and predict their contribution to receiver systematic errors\nprecisely. This can drive the receiver design process by, for instance,\nallowing the instrument designer to identify which component imperfections\ncontribute most to receiver systematic errors, and hence place firm\nspecifications on individual components. Using SNS to perform this analysis is\npreferable to traditional Jones matrix-based analysis as it includes internal\nreflections and is able to model noise: two effects which Jones matrix analysis\nis unable to describe. SNS can be used to model any receiver in which the\ncomponents can be described by scattering matrices. Of particular interest to\nthe sub-mm and terahertz frequency regime is the choice between coherent and\ndirect detection technologies. Steady improvements in mm and sub-mm Low Noise\nAmplifiers (LNAs) mean that coherent receivers with LNAs as their first active\nelement are becoming increasingly competitive, in terms of sensitivity, with\nbolometer-based receivers at frequencies above ~100 GHz. As an example of the\nutility of SNS, we use it to compare two polarimeter architectures commonly\nused to perform measurements of the polarized Cosmic Microwave Background:\ndifferencing polarimeters, an architecture commonly used in polarization\nsensitive bolometer-based polarimeters; and pseudo-correlation polarimeters, an\narchitecture commonly used in coherent, LNA-based, polarimeters. We\nparameterize common sources of receiver systematic errors in both architectures\nand compare them through their Mueller matrices, which encode how well the\ninstruments measure the Stokes parameters of the incident radiation. These\nanalytic Mueller matrices are used to demonstrate the different sources of\nsystematic errors in differencing and correlation polarimeters.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 7 figures, to be presented at the 21st International\n  Symposium on Space Terahertz Technology"]}]

Its measured fluence in the 0.2-10\nkeV band was ~1.4x10^-8 erg cm^-2, which corresponds to 1-15% of the prompt\nfluence. We present indications of spectral variations during the flare. We\nargue that the producing mechanism is late internal shocks, which implies that\nthe central engine is still active at 210s, though with a reduced power with\nrespect to the prompt emission. The X-ray light curve flattens to a very\nshallow slope with decay index of ~0.5 after ~4400s, which also supports\ncontinued central engine activity at late times.

This challenges the conventional central engine models\nand calls for new ideas to re-start the central engine. We further show that\nthe on-set time of the late central engine activity does not depend on the GRB\nduration.

Numerical\nsimulations are carried out using the plaquette gauge action and the Wilson\nquark action at $\\beta = 5.8$ ($a^{-1} \\simeq 3.2\\gev$). The spatial extension\nof the $24^3 \\times 48$ lattice is about 1.5 fm. Configurations have been\ngenerated at four values of the sea quark masses, for which the ratio of\npseudoscalar over vector meson masses is in the range $M_P/M_V \\simeq 0.60 \\div\n0.75$. An important feature of the present study is the use of non-perturbative\nrenormalization, performed with the $\\ri$ method. The effects of dynamical sea\nquarks in the determination of light quark masses have been investigated by\nperforming a quenched calculation on a similar lattice. Our results for the\naverage up-down and strange quark masses are $m_{ud}^{MS} (2\\gev) = 4.3(4)\n(^{+1.1}_{-0.4})\\mev$ and $m_s^{MS}(2\\gev)=101(8)(^{+25}_{-9}) \\mev$. These\nvalues are larger than those obtained by evaluating the quark mass\nrenormalization constants with one-loop (boosted) perturbation theory.
