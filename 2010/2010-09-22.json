The turbulent mixing is modelled by the\nKazantsev-Kraichnan \"rapid-change\" ensemble: time-decorrelated Gaussian\nvelocity field with the power-like spectrum k^{-d-\\xi}.

Barring very specialized models such as product-form\ntype queueing networks, there exist very few results which provide provable\nnon-asymptotic upper and lower bounds on key performance measures. In this\npaper we propose a new performance analysis method, which is based on the\nrobust optimization. The basic premise of our approach is as follows: rather\nthan assuming that the stochastic primitives of a queueing model satisfy\ncertain probability laws, such as, for example, i.i.d. interarrival and service\ntimes distributions, we assume that the underlying primitives are deterministic\nand satisfy the implications of such probability laws. These implications take\nthe form of simple linear constraints, namely, those motivated by the Law of\nthe Iterated Logarithm (LIL).\n  Using this approach we are able to obtain performance bounds on some key\nperformance measures. Furthermore, these performance bounds imply similar\nbounds in the underlying stochastic queueing models.\n  We demonstrate our approach on two types of queueing networks: a) Tandem\nSingle Class queue- ing network and b) Multiclass Single Server queueing\nnetwork. In both cases, using the proposed robust optimization approach, we are\nable to obtain explicit upper bounds on some steady-state performance measures.\nFor example, for the case of TSC system we obtain a bound of the form\n$\\frac{C}{1-\\rho} \\ln \\ln(1/(1-\\rho))$ on the expected steady-state sojourn\ntime, where C is an explicit constant and $\\rho$ is the bottleneck traffic\nintensity.

MCs can start out as cold atomic clouds formed by\ncompressive motions in the warm neutral medium (WNM) of galaxies. Such motions\ncan be driven by large-scale instabilities, or by local turbulence. The\ncompressions induce a phase transition to the cold neutral medium (CNM) to form\ngrowing cold atomic clouds, which in their early stages may constitute thin CNM\nsheets. Several dynamical instabilities soon destabilize a cloud, rendering it\nturbulent. For solar neighborhood conditions, a cloud is coincidentally\nexpected to become molecular, magnetically supercritical, and gravitationally\ndominated at roughly the same column density, $N \\sim 1.5 \\times 10^21 \\psc\n\\approx 10 \\Msun$ pc$^{-2}$. At this point, the cloud begins to contract\ngravitationally. However, before its global collapse is completed ($\\sim 10^7$\nyr later), the nonlinear density fluctuations within the cloud, which have\nshorter local free-fall times, collapse first and begin forming stars, a few\nMyr after the global contraction started. Large-scale fluctuations of lower\nmean densities collapse later, so the formation of massive star-forming regions\nis expected to occur late in the evolution of a large cloud complex, while\nscattered low-mass regions are expected to form earlier.

This paper investigates\nhow channel coding can be used to reduce the failure rate. We propose and\ninvestigate a decoding scheme that incorporates the exploitation of the\naforementioned symbol misalignment into the channel decoding process. This is a\nfine-grained integration at the symbol level. In particular, collision\nresolution and channel decoding are applied in an integrated manner. Simulation\nresults indicate that our method outperforms other schemes, including the\nstraightforward method in which collision resolution and channel coding are\napplied separately.\n"]}]

These resonances lead to strong enhancement of\nthe annihilation rates. They also provide evidence that positrons bind to many\nmolecular species. A quantitative theory of VFR-mediated attachment to small\nmolecules is presented.

These enhancements increase rapidly with\nthe number of vibrational degrees of freedom. While the details are as yet\nunclear, intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution to states that do not\ncouple directly to the positron continuum appears to be responsible for these\nenhanced annihilation rates. Downshifts of the VFR from the vibrational mode\nenergies have provided binding energies for thirty species.
