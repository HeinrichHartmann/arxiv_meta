We find that the\nmotor dynamics can be characterized by two time scales: the moving-time\ninterval for the mechanical rotation of the rotor and the waiting-time interval\ndetermined by the chemical transitions of the stators. We show that these two\ntime scales depend differently on the load, and that their crossover provides\nthe microscopic explanation for the existence of two regimes in the\ntorque-speed curves observed experimentally. We also analyze the speed\nfluctuation for a single motor using our model. We show that the motion is\nsmoothed by having more stator units. However, the mechanism for such\nfluctuation reduction is different depending on the load. We predict that the\nspeed fluctuation is determined by the number of steps per revolution only at\nlow load and is controlled by external noise for high load.

In the double detonation scenario for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) a\ndetonation initiates in a shell of He-rich material accreted from a companion\nstar by a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass White Dwarf (WD). This shell detonation drives\na shock front into the carbon-oxygen (C/O) WD that triggers a secondary\ndetonation in the core. The core detonation results in a complete disruption of\nthe WD. Earlier studies concluded that this scenario has difficulties in\naccounting for the observed properties of SNe Ia since the explosion ejecta are\nsurrounded by the products of explosive He burning in the shell. Recently, it\nwas proposed that detonations might be possible for much less massive He shells\nthan previously assumed. Moreover, it was shown that even detonations of these\nminimum He shell masses robustly trigger detonations of the C/O core. Here we\npresent time-dependent multi-wavelength radiative transfer calculations for\nmodels with minimum He shell mass and derive synthetic observables for both the\noptical and {\\gamma}-ray spectral regions. These differ strongly from those\nfound in earlier simulations of sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions in which more\nmassive He shells were considered. Our models predict light curves which cover\nboth the range of brightnesses and the rise and decline times of observed SNe\nIa. However, their colours and spectra do not match the observations. In\nparticular, their B-V colours are generally too red. We show that this\ndiscrepancy is mainly due to the composition of the burning products of the He\nshell of our models which contain significant amounts of Ti and Cr. Using a toy\nmodel, we also show that the burning products of the He shell depend crucially\non its initial composition. This leads us to conclude that good agreement\nbetween sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions and observed SNe Ia may still be\nfeasible but further study of the shell properties is required.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 13 figures.

Even though it is observed countless\ntimes in the course of a day, drop splashing is highly non-intuitive: for\nexample, it is surprising that the surrounding air pressure determines whether\na drop will splash when hitting a smooth surface. Here we describe a discovery\nwith significant practical ramifications: the direction, as well as the number,\nof the ejected droplets can be controlled by the texture of a surface.\n","Comment: 2 pages, 2 figures"]}]
