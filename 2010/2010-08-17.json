In\nparticular, the receivers in many wireless networks need to estimate the\nchannel gains by means of a training sequence. This paper studies the scaling\nlaw (on the network size) of the overhead for channel gain monitoring in\nwireless network. We first investigate the scenario in which a receiver needs\nto track the channel gains with respect to multiple transmitters. To be\nconcrete, suppose that there are n transmitters, and that in the current round\nof channel-gain estimation, no more than k channels suffer significant\nvariations since the last round.

The content of the subject evaluations\nthemselves suggest one mechanism for peer effects: workers readily punished\nother workers whose work product exhibited low output/effort. However,\nnon-compliance with employer expectations did not, by itself, trigger\npunishment: workers would not punish non-complying workers so long as the\nevaluated worker still exhibited high effort. A worker's willingness to punish\nwas strongly correlated with their own productivity, yet this relationship was\nnot the result of innate differences---productivity-reducing manipulations also\nresulted in reduced punishment.

The first\npart is devoted to the study of the inner flow. CAD and CFD software are used\nin order to determine the most important parameters of the flow at the exit of\nnozzle. An important conclusion is the existence of two flow regions: one in\nrelatively slow motion (the boundary layer) and a second nearly in solid\nrotation at a very high angular rate (about 100 000 rad/s) with a thickness of\nabout 4/5th of the nozzle section. Then, a theoretical and experimental\nanalysis of the flow outside the nozzle is carried out. In the theoretical\nsection, the size of the biggest drops is successfully compared to results\nstemming from linear instability theory. However, it is also shown that this\ntheory cannot explain the occurrence of small drops observed in the stability\ndomain whose size are close to the Kolmogorov and Taylor turbulent length\nscale. A Phase Doppler Particle Analyser (PDPA) is used to characterize the\ndroplet size and velocity distribution. Due to centrifugal force, the smaller\ndroplets tend to prevail on the spray axis and a peak close to the Taylor\nlength scale appears progressively in the PDF when increasing the distance from\nthe nozzle. It is then assumed that these small droplets are the results of a\nturbulent cascading atomization process and that in the near nozzle area, since\ncentrifugal segregation is small, PDF can therefore be fitted with a log-stable\nlaw (Rimbert and S\\'ero-Guillaume, 2004). The value of the stability index is\nfound to be 1.35 very close to a previous experimental result of 1.39 (Rimbert\nand Delconte, 2007) but far from a known theoretical value of 1.70 (Rimbert,\n2010).

We used the first 21 months of Fermi/LAT data\nto extract gamma-ray (0.2-100 GeV) images, spectra and light-curves, then\ncombined them with multi-wavelength observations to model the non-thermal\nspectral energy distribution. A bright gamma-ray source is detected at the\nposition of eta Carinae. Its flux at a few 100 MeV corresponds very well to the\nextrapolation of the hard X-ray spectrum towards higher energies. The spectral\nenergy distribution features two distinct components. The first one extends\nover the keV to GeV energy range, and features an exponential cutoff at ~ 1\nGeV. It can be understood as inverse Compton scattering of ultraviolet photons\nby electrons accelerated up to gamma~1E4 in the colliding wind region. The\nexpected synchrotron emission is compatible with the existing upper limit on\nthe non-thermal radio emission. The second component is a hard gamma-ray tail\ndetected above 20 GeV. It could be explained by pi0-decay of accelerated\nhadrons interacting with the dense stellar wind. The ratio between the fluxes\nof the pi0 and inverse Compton components is roughly as predicted by\nsimulations of colliding wind binaries.

The energy\ntransferred to the accelerated particles (~5% of the collision mechanical\nenergy) is comparable to that of the thermal X-ray emission.

Different oscillation\nmechanisms based on cooperative effects between Min-proteins and on the\nexchange of Min-proteins between the cytoplasm and the cytoplasmic membrane\nhave been proposed. The parameters characterizing the dynamics of the\nMin-proteins in vivo are not known. It has therefore been difficult to compare\nthe models quantitatively with experiments. Here, we present in vivo\nmeasurements of the mobility of MinD and MinE using fluorescence correlation\nspectroscopy. Two distinct time-scales are clearly visible in the correlation\ncurves. While the faster time-scale can be attributed to cytoplasmic diffusion,\nthe slower time-scale could result from diffusion of membrane-bound proteins or\nfrom protein exchange between the cytoplasm and the membrane. We determine the\ndiffusion constant of cytoplasmic MinD to be approximately 16\\mu^{2}/s, while\nfor MinE we find about 10\\mu^{2}/s, independently of the processes responsible\nfor the slower time-scale.
