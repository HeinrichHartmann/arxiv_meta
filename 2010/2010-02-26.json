The absence of this causal structure in the Euclidean framework makes it\nnecessary to modify the original construction of Epstein and Glaser at two\npoints. First, the whole construction has to be performed with an only\npartially defined product on (interaction-) functionals. This is due to the\nfact that the fundamental solutions of the Helmholtz operator of EQFT have a\nunique singularity structure, i.e. they are unique up to a smooth part.

To a divide, that is a\nproper generic immersion of a finite number of copies of the unit interval and\ncircles in a 2-disc, one can associate a strongly invertible link in the\n3-sphere. This can be generalized to signed divides : divides with + or - sign\nassignment to each crossing point. Conversely, to any link $L$ that is strongly\ninvertible for an involution $j$, one can associate a signed divide. Two\nstrongly invertible links that are isotopic through an isotopy respecting the\ninvolution are called strongly equivalent. Such isotopies give rise to moves on\ndivides. In a previous paper of the author, one can find an exhaustive list of\nmoves that preserves strong equivalence, together with a polynomial invariant\nfor these moves, giving therefore an invariant for strong equivalence of the\nassociated strongly invertible links. We prove in this paper that this\npolynomial can be seen as the graded Euler characteristic of a graded complex\nof vector spaces. Homology of such complexes is invariant for the moves on\ndivides and so is invariant through strong equivalence of strongly invertible\nlinks.\n"]}]

We first present an $O(N^{2})$\ndistributed algorithm for discovering the shortest CDC-path between given\nsource and destination. This improves the running time of the $O(N^{3})$\ncentralized algorithm of Ahuja et al. for finding the minimum-weight CDC-path.\nOur second result is a generalized $t$-spanner for CDC-path; For any $\\theta>0$\nwe show how to construct a sub-network containing only $O(\\frac{N}{\\theta})$\nedges, such that that length of shortest CDC-paths between arbitrary sources\nand destinations increases by only a factor of at most\n$(1-2\\sin{\\tfrac{\\theta}{2}})^{-2}$. We propose a novel algorithm to compute\nthe spanner in a distributed manner using only $O(n\\log{n})$ messages. An\nimportant conclusion of this scheme is in the case of directional antennas are\nused. In this case, it is enough to consider only the two closest nodes in each\ncone.\n"]}]

The input to the problem\nis a rooted, balanced binary tree of height h, whose internal nodes are labeled\nwith binary functions on [k] = {1,...,k} (each given simply as a list of k^2\nelements of [k]), and whose leaves are labeled with elements of [k].

In the present\npaper, these notions are developed further and partially reworked. For\ninstance, although no analogue of a long exact sequence arises from a short\nstably phantom exact sequence of complexes, we provide a method for recovering\nthe kind of information obtainable from such a long sequence. Also, we give\nalternate characterizations of the notion of phantom depth, including one based\non Koszul homology which we use to show that with very mild conditions on a\nfinitely generated module $M$, any two maximal phantom $M$-regular sequences in\nan ideal $I$ have the same length. In order to do so, we prove a \"Nakayama\nlemma for tight closure\" which is of independent interest. We strengthen the\nconnection of phantom depth with minheight, we explore several analogues of\n\"associated prime\" in tight closure theory, and we discuss a connection with\nthe problem of when tight closure commutes with localization.\n","Comment: 35 pages"]}]
