If the pair obeys the cut condition, then the flow-cut gap for this instance\nis the minimum value C such that there is a feasible multiflow for H if each\nedge of G is given capacity C. The flow-cut gap can be greater than 1 even when\nG is the (series-parallel) graph K_{2,3}. In this paper we are primarily\ninterested in the \"integer\" flow-cut gap. What is the minimum value C such that\nthere is a feasible integer valued multiflow for H if each edge of G is given\ncapacity C? We conjecture that the integer flow-cut gap is quantitatively\nrelated to the fractional flow-cut gap. This strengthens the well-known\nconjecture that the flow-cut gap in planar and minor-free graphs is O(1) to\nsuggest that the integer flow-cut gap is O(1). We give several results on\nnon-trivial special classes of graphs supporting this conjecture and further\nexplore the \"primal\" method for understanding flow-cut gaps. Our results\ninclude:\n  - Let G be obtained by series-parallel operations starting from an edge st,\nand consider orienting all edges in G in the direction from s to t. A demand is\ncompliant if its endpoints are joined by a directed path in the resulting\noriented graph. If the cut condition holds for a compliant instance and G+H is\nEulerian, then an integral routing of H exists.\n  - The integer flow-cut gap in series-parallel graphs is 5. We also give an\nexplicit class of instances that shows via elementary calculations that the\nflow-cut gap in series-parallel graphs is at least 2-o(1); this simplifies the\nproof by Lee and Raghavendra.\n  - The integer flow-cut gap in k-Outerplanar graphs is c^{O(k)} for some fixed\nconstant c.\n  - A simple proof that the flow-cut gap is O(\\log k^*) where k^* is the size\nof a node-cover in H; this was previously shown by G\\\"unl\\\"uk via a more\nintricate proof.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 10 figures.

Some methods have been\nproposed to solve the problem of determining the resonance frequencies and\ntheir dependence on the stress caused by forces applied on the membrane\nsurface. The problem of the vibrating rectangular membrane under a stress\ncaused by a uniform in-plane force is well known. However, the resonance\nfrequency behaviour when the force is out-of-plane instead of in-plane, is not\nso well understood and documented. A gradiometer which uses a silicon square\nmembrane with a magnet fixed on it as a sensor head has been developed in a\nprevious work. This device reports a quadratic dependence of the frequency on\nthe out-of-plane magnetic force. In this work, simulations to obtain the\ndependence of the frequency of the fundamental flexural mode on the stress have\nbeen performed. It has been studied the influence of in-plane and out-of-plane\nforces applied to the membrane. As expected, a square root dependence has been\nfound for in-plane forces. Nevertheless, the problem is more complex when\nout-of plane forces are considered. Out-of-plane forces gives rise to an\ninitial quadratic dependence which turns into a square root dependence from a\ncertain stress value. The quadratic range increases and the rate of change of\nthe frequency decreases as the surface of the magnet fixed on the membrane\nincreases.

In a \"power-stroke\" model the observed independence\nof the speed at low load on the number of stators is explained by a\ntorque-dependent stepping mechanism independent of the strength of the stator\ntethering spring. On the other hand, in models that depend solely on the stator\nspring to explain the observed behavior, exceedingly small stator spring\nconstants are required. To study the dynamics of the motor driven by external\nforces (such as those exerted by an optical tweezer), back-stepping is\nintroduced when stators are driven far out of equilibrium. Our model with\nback-stepping reproduces the observed absence of a barrier to backward\nrotation, as well the behaviors in the high-speed negative-torque regime.\nRecently measured temperature dependence of the motor speed near zero load\n(Yuan & Berg 2010 Biophys J) is explained quantitatively by the thermally\nactivated stepping rates in our model. Finally, we suggest that the general\nmechanical properties of all molecular motors (linear and rotary),\ncharacterized by their force(torque)-speed curve, can be determined by their\npower-stroke potentials and the dependence of the stepping rates on the\nmechanical state of the motor (force or speed). The torque-speed curve for the\nclockwise rotating flagellar motor has been observed for the first time\nrecently (Yuan et al. 2010 PNAS). Its quasi-linear behavior is quantitatively\nreproduced by our model. In particular, we show that concave and convex shapes\nof the torque-speed curve can be achieved by changing the interaction potential\nfrom linear to quadratic form.

Many-body nodes\nof fermion states and their properties have therefore become one of the\nimportant topics for further progress in predictive power and efficiency of QMC\ncalculations.

This includes analysis of\nfew-electron systems and descriptions of exact and approximate nodes using\ntransformations and projections of the highly-dimensional nodal hypersurfaces\ninto the 3D space. Studies of fermion nodes offer new insights into topological\nproperties of eigenstates such as explicit demonstrations that generic\nfermionic ground states exhibit the minimal number of two nodal domains.\nRecently proposed trial wave functions based on Pfaffians with pairing orbitals\nare presented and their nodal properties are tested in calculations of first\nrow atoms and molecules.

This possibility was\ninvestigated extensively in a series of phenomenological papers during\n1984-1985 in connection with the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC). The work\nwas mainly based on a model independent systematic parametrization of\nscattering amplitudes and cross sections, for Standard Model particles, quarks\nand leptons, that were assumed to behave like strings, while gluons, photons,\n$W^{\\pm},Z$ were taken as elementary. By using Veneziano type beta functions\nconsistent with crossing symmetry, duality and Regge behavior, bosonic or\nfermionic resonances in each channel were included, while the low energy\nbehavior was matched to effective field theory non-renormalizable interactions\nconsistent with the Standard Model SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) gauge symmetry as well as\nglobal flavor and family symmetries. The motivation for this approach at that\ntime was the possible compositeness of quarks and leptons but the same\nphenomenological approach would apply effectively with the modern additional\nmotivations for TeV scale strings, such as the hypothesis of D-branes with\nlarge extra dimensions. Because some of the main theoretical and\nphenomenological work of that time appeared only in the 1984 Snowmass and other\nproceedings, the results of the investigations have been inaccessible to most\nresearchers and consequently have been largely forgotten.
