The 88 micron line can also be generated in the narrow\nline region of the AGN if gas densities are around a few 1000 cm-3.

Quenching from high rates produces a fluid state, G\">G', with small,\nfast relaxing residual stresses and rapid, sigmoidal aging of the complex\nmodulus. Conversely, quenching from lower shear rates produces increasingly\njammed states featuring slowly relaxing stresses and a slow increase of the\ncomplex modulus with system age. Flow cessation from a fixed shear rate with\nvarying quench durations shows that slower quenches produce smaller residual\nstresses at short times which relax at long times by smaller extents, by\ncomparison with faster quenches. These smaller stresses are correlated with a\nhigher modulus but slower physical aging of the system. The characteristic time\nfor the residual stress relaxation scales inversely with the quench rate. This\nimplies a frustrated approach to any ideal stress-free state that succinctly\nreflects the frustrated nature of these glassy systems.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 14 figures; Submitted to Journal of Rheology"]}]

Nevertheless, it could influence directly some long-period\ncomets of Epsilon Eridani. The duration of mutual transit of two star systems\nwithin 1 ly from each other is $\\gtrsim$ 4.6 kyr.
