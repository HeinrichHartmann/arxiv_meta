We use the\nLandau-Lifshitz field-theory-in-flat-spacetime formulation of general\nrelativity to define and compute the density of field energy and field momentum\noutside horizons and the energy and momentum contained within horizons, and we\ndefine the effective velocity of each apparent and event horizon as the ratio\nof its enclosed momentum to its enclosed mass-energy. We find surprisingly good\nagreement between the horizons' effective and coordinate velocities. To\ninvestigate the gauge dependence of our results, we compare pseudospectral and\nmoving-puncture evolutions of physically similar initial data; although\nspectral and puncture simulations use different gauge conditions, we find\nremarkably good agreement for our results in these two cases.

To demonstrate this\nidea, we generate 3-dimensional hyperspace bases using 2 Gaussian noises as\nsources for neuro-bits, respectively. In such a scenario, the detection of\ndifferent hyperspace basis elements may have vastly differing delays. We show\nthat it is possible to provide an identical speed for all the hyperspace bases\nelements using correlated noise sources, and demonstrate this for the 2\nneuro-bits situations. The key impact of this paper is to demonstrate that a\nlogic design approach using such neuro-bits can yield a fast, low power\nprocessing and environmental variation tolerant means of designing computer\ncircuitry.

Although the plant response to\nenvironmental stresses is characterized by both architectural and functional\nplasticity, recent attempts to integrate biological knowledge into genetics\nmodels have mainly concerned specific physiological processes or crop models\nwithout architecture, and thus may prove limited when studying genotype x\nenvironment interactions. Consequently, this paper presents a simulation study\nintroducing genetics into a functional-structural growth model, which gives\naccess to more fundamental traits for quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection\nand thus to promising tools for yield optimization. Methods: The GreenLab model\nwas selected as a reasonable choice to link growth model parameters to QTL.\nVirtual genes and virtual chromosomes were defined to build a simple genetic\nmodel that drove the settings of the species-specific parameters of the model.\nThe QTL Cartographer software was used to study QTL detection of simulated\nplant traits. A genetic algorithm was implemented to define the ideotype for\nyield maximization based on the model parameters and the associated allelic\ncombination. Key Results and Conclusions: By keeping the environmental factors\nconstant and using a virtual population with a large number of individuals\ngenerated by a Mendelian genetic model, results for an ideal case could be\nsimulated. Virtual QTL detection was compared in the case of phenotypic traits\n- such as cob weight - and when traits were model parameters, and was found to\nbe more accurate in the latter case. The practical interest of this approach is\nillustrated by calculating the parameters (and the corresponding genotype)\nassociated with yield optimization of a GreenLab maize model. The paper\ndiscusses the potentials of GreenLab to represent environment x genotype\ninteractions, in particular through its main state variable, the ratio of\nbiomass supply over demand.\n"]}]

Increasingly, however, cooperation is\nbeing studied in continuous games that feature a continuum of strategies\ndetermining the level of cooperative investment. For the continuous snowdrift\ngame, it has been shown that a gradually evolving monomorphic population may\nundergo evolutionary branching, resulting in the emergence of a defector\nstrategy that coexists with a cooperator strategy. This phenomenon has been\ndubbed the 'tragedy of the commune'. Here we study the effects of fluctuating\ngroup size on the tragedy of the commune and derive analytical conditions for\nevolutionary branching. Our results show that the effects of fluctuating group\nsize on evolutionary dynamics critically depend on the structure of payoff\nfunctions. For games with additively separable benefits and costs, fluctuations\nin group size make evolutionary branching less likely, and sufficiently large\nfluctuations in group size can always turn an evolutionary branching point into\na locally evolutionarily stable strategy. For games with multiplicatively\nseparable benefits and costs, fluctuations in group size can either prevent or\ninduce the tragedy of the commune. For games with general interactions between\nbenefits and costs, we derive a general classification scheme based on second\nderivatives of the payoff function, to elucidate when fluctuations in group\nsize help or hinder cooperation.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 5 figures"]}]

An abundance matching technique is used\nto link galaxy luminosity to the host halo mass. The shape of the mass - light\nrelation at 60 micron is different from those derived at r-, K- and B-band.\nThis is because the 60 micron LF can not be fitted by a Schechter function with\na sharp exponential cutoff. We then seek the parameters in the CLFs that best\nfit the LF and power spectrum. We find that the predicted galaxy bias as a\nfunction of L60 from the best-fit model agrees well with the clustering\nmeasurements.

The zeroth order of this\nperturbation preserves the number of $s$ - channel gluons. The eigenstates have\na natural interpretation in terms of the $t$ - channel exchanges. Studying the\nsingle $s$ - channel gluon sector we find the eigenstates which include the\nreggeized gluon and five other colored Reggeons. In the two ($s$ - channel)\ngluon sector we study only singlet color exchanges. We find five charge\nconjugation even states. The bound state of two reggeized gluons is the\nstandard BFKL Pomeron. The intercepts of the other Pomerons in the large $N$\nlimit are $1+\\omega_P=1+2\\omega$ where $1+\\omega$ is the intercept of the BFKL\nPomeron, but their coupling in perturbation theory is suppressed by at least\n$1/N^2$ relative to the double BFKL Pomeron exchange. For the $[27,27]$ Pomeron\nwe find $\\omega_{[27,27]}=2\\omega+O(1/N)>2\\omega$. We also find three charge\nconjugation odd exchanges, one of which is the unit intercept\nBartels-Lipatov-Vacca Odderon, while another one has an interecept greater than\nunity.

It is quite remarkable that in the USY case, only two complex\nphases of definite value +-Pi/2 are sufficient to generate the known neutrino\nmass differences, while at same time, permitting large leptonic mixing in\nagreement with experiment.\n","Comment: 11 pages"]}]

Both versions of the see-saw mechanism explain naturally small\nneutrino masses, but the type II scenario offers interesting additional\npossibilities to explain large or almost maximal or vanishing mixings which are\ndiscussed in this paper. We first introduce ``type II enhancement'' of neutrino\nmixing, where moderate cancellations between the two terms can lead to large\nneutrino mixing even if all individual mass matrices and terms generate small\nmixing. However, nearly maximal or vanishing mixings are not naturally\nexplained in this way, unless there is a certain initial structure (symmetry)\nwhich enforces certain elements of the matrices to be identical or related in a\nspecial way. We therefore assume that the leading structure of the neutrino\nmass matrix is the triplet term and corresponds to zero U_{e3} and maximal\ntheta_{23}. Small but necessary corrections are generated by the conventional\nsee-saw term. Then we assume that one of the two terms corresponds to an\nextreme mixing scenario, such as bimaximal or tri-bimaximal mixing. Deviations\nfrom this scheme are introduced by the second term. One can mimic Quark-Lepton\nComplementarity in this way.

We\nstudy these constraints at the linear and non-linear level for a pure\ngeometrical setting and in the presence of p-form field strengths. We find that\ncertain spaces admit several super-extensions and we give a parameterization in\na simple case of d bosonic coordinates and two fermionic coordinates.

This is to be contrasted with the situation in models of inflation in\nwhich the accelerated expansion of space is driven by the potential energy of a\nscalar field, and in which the fluctuations are of quantum vacuum type. We find\nthat, in the limit that the expansion of space is almost exponential, the\nspectrum of fluctuations is scale-invariant with a slight red tilt. The\nmagnitude of the tilt is different from what is obtained in a usual\ninflationary model with the same expansion rate during the period of inflation.\nThe amplitude also differs, and can easily be adjusted to agree with\nobservations.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 1 figure"]}]

It allows one\nto estimate the Coulomb energy and the short range inter-cluster bond energy in\ndependence on the number of clusters.

Unlike the Weizsacker formula in this model the\nbinding energies of alpha-clusters and excess neutrons are estimated\nseparately.
