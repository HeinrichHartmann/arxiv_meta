In\nthis paper we provide a general framework for the analysis of outage\nprobabilities in the high-reliability regime.

We study outage probabilities under the signal-to-interference\nratio (SIR) model, Rayleigh fading, and power-law path loss, and explain how\nthe two parameters depend on the network model.

Dynamical decoupling (DD) is\none of the most effective experimental methods for maintaining coherence,\nespecially when one can access only the qubit-system and not its environment\n(bath). It involves the application of pulses to the system whose net effect is\na reversal of the system-environment interaction. In any real system, however,\nthe environment is not static, and therefore the reversal of the\nsystem-environment interaction becomes imperfect if the spacing between\nrefocusing pulses becomes comparable to or longer than the correlation time of\nthe environment. The efficiency of the refocusing improves therefore if the\nspacing between the pulses is reduced. Here, we quantify the efficiency of\ndifferent DD sequences in preserving different quantum states. We use 13C\nnuclear spins as qubits and an environment of 1H nuclear spins as the\nenvironment, which couples to the qubit via magnetic dipole-dipole couplings.\nStrong dipole-dipole couplings between the proton spins result in a rapidly\nfluctuating environment with a correlation time of the order of 100 us. Our\nexperimental results show that short delays between the pulses yield better\nperformance if they are compared with the bath correlation time. However, as\nthe pulse spacing becomes shorter than the bath correlation time, an optimum is\nreached.

By using a\nsimilar idea for a two-user discrete memoryless (DM) multiple-access channel\n(MAC), three lower bounds on the reliability function are derived.

However, it is quite challenging to use experimental\nor clinical data to estimate the unknown parameters (both constant and\ntime-varying parameters) in complex nonlinear differential equation models.\nTherefore, investigators usually fix some parameter values, from the literature\nor by experience, to obtain only parameter estimates of interest from clinical\nor experimental data. However, when such prior information is not available, it\nis desirable to determine all the parameter estimates from data. In this paper\nwe intend to combine the newly developed approaches, a multi-stage\nsmoothing-based (MSSB) method and the spline-enhanced nonlinear least squares\n(SNLS) approach, to estimate all HIV viral dynamic parameters in a nonlinear\ndifferential equation model. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first attempt to propose a comparatively thorough procedure, accounting\nfor both efficiency and accuracy, to rigorously estimate all key kinetic\nparameters in a nonlinear differential equation model of HIV dynamics from\nclinical data. These parameters include the proliferation rate and death rate\nof uninfected HIV-targeted cells, the average number of virions produced by an\ninfected cell, and the infection rate which is related to the antiviral\ntreatment effect and is time-varying. To validate the estimation methods, we\nverified the identifiability of the HIV viral dynamic model and performed\nsimulation studies.\n","Comment: Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/09-AOAS290 the Annals of\n  Applied Statistics (http://www.imstat.org/aoas/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)"]}]

For example, hadrons can be produced at large transverse\nmomentum directly within a hard higher-twist QCD subprocess, rather than from\njet fragmentation. Such \"direct\" processes can explain the deviations from\nperturbative QCD predictions in measurements of inclusive hadron cross sections\nat fixed x_T= 2p_T/\\sqrt s, as well as the \"baryon anomaly\", the anomalously\nlarge proton-to-pion ratio seen in high centrality heavy ion collisions.\nInitial-state and final-state interactions of the struck quark lead to\nBjorken-scaling single-spin asymmetries, diffractive deep inelastic scattering,\nthe breakdown of the Lam-Tung relation in Drell-Yan reactions, as well as\nnuclear shadowing and antishadowing. The Gribov-Glauber theory predicts that\nantishadowing of nuclear structure functions is not universal, but instead\ndepends on the flavor quantum numbers of each quark and antiquark, thus\nexplaining the anomalous nuclear dependence measured in deep-inelastic neutrino\nscattering. One cannot attribute such phenomena to the structure of the hadron\nor nucleus itself. It is thus important to distinguish \"static\" structure\nfunctions computed from the square of the target light-front wavefunctions,\nversus \"dynamical\" structure functions which include the effects of the\nfinal-state rescattering of the struck quark. The importance of the J=0\nphoton-quark QCD contact interaction in deeply virtual Compton scattering is\nemphasized. The scheme-independent BLM method for setting the renormalization\nscale is discussed. Eliminating the renormalization scale ambiguity greatly\nimproves the precision of QCD predictions and increases the sensitivity of\nsearches for new physics at the LHC. Other novel features of QCD are discussed,\nincluding the consequences of confinement for quark and gluon condensates.\n","Comment: Invited talk, presented at the Gribov-80 Memorial Workshop on Quantum\n  Chromodynamics and Beyond, May, 2010, Abdus Salam International Centre for\n  Theoretical Physics.

Rev. Lett. {\\bf 64},\n1955 (1990)], have demonstrated that the liquid undergoes a dynamical crossover\nfrom super-Arrhenius, or ``fragile'' behavior, to Arrhenius, or ``strong''\nbehavior, as temperature $T$ is decreased. From extensive MD simulations, we\nshow that this fragile-to-strong crossover (FSC) can be connected to changes in\nthe properties of the potential energy landscape, or surface (PES), of the\nliquid. To achieve this, we use thermodynamic integration to evaluate the\nabsolute free energy of the liquid over a wide range of density and $T$. We use\nthis free energy data, along with the concept of ``inherent structures'' of the\nPES, to evaluate the absolute configurational entropy $S_c$ of the liquid. We\nfind that the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient and of $S_c$\nare consistent with the prediction of Adam and Gibbs, including in the region\nwhere we observe the FSC to occur. We find that the FSC is related to a change\nin the properties of the PES explored by the liquid, specifically an inflection\nin the $T$ dependence of the average inherent structure energy. In addition, we\nfind that the high $T$ behavior of $S_c$ suggests that the liquid entropy might\napproach zero at finite $T$, behavior associated with the so-called Kauzmann\nparadox. However, we find that the change in the PES that underlies the FSC is\nassociated with a change in the $T$ dependence of $S_c$ that elucidates how the\nKauzmann paradox is avoided in this system. Finally, we also explore the\nrelation of the observed PES changes to the recently discussed possibility that\nBKS silica exhibits a liquid-liquid phase transition, a behavior that has been\nproposed to underlie the observed polyamorphism of amorphous solid silica.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 18 figures"]}]
