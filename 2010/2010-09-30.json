The evolution of the galaxy stellar\nmass function (GSMF) in high and low density regions provides a tool to study\nthe mass assembly evolution in different environments; moreover, the\ncontributions to the GSMF from different galaxy types, as defined by their SEDs\nand their morphologies, can be quantified. At redshift z~1, the GSMF is only\nslightly dependent on environment, but at lower redshifts the shapes of the\nGSMFs in high- and low-density environments become extremely different, with\nhigh density regions exhibiting a marked bimodality. As a result, we infer that\ngalaxy evolution depends on both the stellar mass and the environment, the\nlatter setting the probability of a galaxy to have a given mass: all the galaxy\nproperties related to the stellar mass show a dependence on environment,\nreflecting the difference observed in the mass functions. The shapes of the\nGSMFs of early- and late-type galaxies are almost identical for the extremes of\nthe density contrast we consider. The evolution toward z=0 of the mass at which\nthe early- and late-type GSMFs match each other is more rapid in high density\nenvironments. The comparison of the observed GSMFs to the same quantities\nderived from a set of mock catalogues shows that blue galaxies in sparse\nenvironments are overproduced in the semi-analytical models at intermediate and\nhigh masses, because of a deficit of star formation suppression, while at z<0.5\nan excess of red galaxies is present in dense environments at intermediate and\nlow masses, because of the overquenching of satellites.

The observations cover 228 square degrees of the southern sky,\nin a 4.2-degree-wide strip centered on declination 53 degrees South.

The power beyond the Silk damping tail of\nthe CMB is consistent with models of the emission from point sources.

The maximum value of Tc and magnetic moment for Sr based sample is most\nlikely due to the closer ionic sizes of La and Sr as compared to the other\ndopants (Ca, Pb, Ba). The decrease in the transition temperature and magnetic\nmoment is due to the deviation of Mn-O-Mn angle from 1800 caused by the size\nmismatch of the A site cations. This deviation leads to weakening of the FM\ndouble exchange (DE). We observed a spin freezing type effect in the Pb doped\nsample below 120 K in resistivity, AC susceptibility and in magnetization.

The main contribution of this paper is to\npropose Unlocking CSMA (U-CSMA) policy that enables to obtain high throughput\nwith low (average) packet delay for large wireless networks. In particular, the\ndelay under U-CSMA policy becomes order-optimal. For one-hop traffic, delay is\ndefined to be order-optimal if it is O(1), i.e., it stays bounded, as the\nnetwork-size increases to infinity. Using mean field theory techniques, we\nanalytically show that for torus (grid-like) interference topologies with\none-hop traffic, to achieve a network load of $\\rho$, the delay under U-CSMA\npolicy becomes $O(1/(1-\\rho)^{3})$ as the network-size increases, and hence,\ndelay becomes order optimal.

We suggest that the resulting\nearly ingress is caused by a bow shock ahead of the planetary orbital motion.\nIn this Letter we investigate the conditions that might lead to the formation\nof such a bow shock. We consider two scenarios: (1) the stellar magnetic field\nis strong enough to confine the hot coronal plasma out to the planetary orbit\nand (2) the stellar magnetic field is unable to confine the plasma, which\nescapes in a wind. In both cases, a shock capable of compressing plasma to the\nobserved densities will form around the planet for plasma temperatures T < (4 -\n5) x 10^6 K. In the confined case, the shock always forms directly ahead of the\nplanet, but in the wind case the shock orientation depends on the wind speed\nand hence on the plasma temperature. For higher wind temperatures, the shock\nforms closer to the line of centers between the planet and the star. We\nconclude that shock formation leading to an observable early UV ingress is\nlikely to be a common feature of transiting systems and may prove to be a\nuseful tool in setting limits on planetary magnetic field strengths Bp.
