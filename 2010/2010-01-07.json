However, the effect of compressibility is found to extend the\nsingle-scaling multi-fractal regime further into the dissipative range. In the\nultimate compressibility limit, thanks to the shock waves which are the\nappropriate dissipative structures, the single-scaling regime is found to\nextend indeed all the way into the full viscous regime. This result appears to\nbe consistent with the physical fact that vortices stretch stronger in a\ncompressible fluid hence postponing viscous intervention. The consequent\ngeneration of enhanced velocity gradients in a compressible fluid appears to\nprovide an underlying physical basis for the previous results indicating that\nfully-developed compressible turbulence is effectively more dissipative than\nits incompressible counterpart.\n"]}]

We show here that if indeed UHECRs\nare largely heavy nuclei, then nearby radio quiet AGNs can also be viable\nsources of UHECRs. We derive constraints on the acceleration sites which enable\nacceleration of UHECRs to 10^{20} eV without suffering losses. We show that the\nacceleration of UHECRs and the survival of energetic heavy nuclei are possible\nin the parsec scale weak jets that are typically observed in these objects, the\nmain energy loss channel being photodisintegration. On this scale, energy\ndissipation by shock waves resulting from interactions inside a jet or of the\njet with surrounding material are expected, which may accelerate the particles\nup to very high energies. We discuss the possible contribution of radio-quiet\nAGNs to the observed UHECR flux, and show that the required energy production\nrate in UHECRs by a single object could be as low as ~ 3*10^{39} erg/s, which\nis less than a percent of the bolometric luminosity, and thus energetically\nconsistent. We discuss consequences of this model, the main one being the\ndifficulty in detecting energetic secondaries (\\gamma-rays and neutrinos) from\nthe same sources.\n","Comment: One reference added; Reference style changed to conform Phys.

The\ntwo gaps with non-eccentric inner edges lie near first-order Inner Lindblad\nResonances (ILRs) with moons. One such edge is close to the 5:4 ILR with\nPrometheus. The other resonantly confined edge is the outer edge of the B ring,\nwhich lies near the 2:1 Mimas ILR.

The pattern speeds of the eccentric edges in\nthe Cassini Division can potentially be generated from various combinations of\nthe pattern speeds of structures observed on the edge of the B ring.
