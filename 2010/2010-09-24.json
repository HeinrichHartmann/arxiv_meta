Therefore, the\ngravity on large scales should be dominant by the distribution of dark matter\nin the universe. However, a series of observations incontrovertibly show that\nthe velocity and density fields of baryonic matter are decoupling from\nunderlying dark matter field. This paper shows our attemps to unveil the\nphysics behind this puzzle. In linear approximation, the dynamics of the baryon\nfluid is completely governed by the gravity of the dark matter. Consequently,\nthe mass density field of baryon matter $\\rho_b({\\bf r},t)$ will be\nproportional to that of dark matter $\\rho_{\\rm dm}({\\bf r},t)$, even though\nthey are different from each other initially. In weak and moderate nonlinear\nregime, the dynamics of the baryon fluid can be sketched by Burgers equation. A\nbasic feature of the Burgers dynamics is to yield shocks. When the Reynolds\nnumber is large, the Burgers fluid will be in the state of Burgers turbulence,\nwhich consists of shocks and complex structures. On the other hand, the\ncollisionless dark matter may not show such shock, but a multivalued velocity\nfield. Therefore, the weak and moderate nonlinear evolution leads to the\nIGM-dark matter deviation. Yet, the velocity field of Burgers fluid is still\nirrotational, as gravity is curl-free. In fully nonlinear regime, the vorticity\nof velocity field developed, and the cosmic baryonic fluid will no longer be\npotential, as the dynamics of vorticity is independent of gravity and can be\nself maintained by the nonlinearity of hydrodynamics. In this case, the cosmic\nbaryon fluid is in the state of fully developed turbulence, which is\nstatistically and dynamically decoupling from dark matter.

As the\nrepertoire of enzymes of an organism (its toolbox) grows larger, it can reuse\nits enzyme tools more often and thus needs to get fewer new ones to master each\nnew task. From this observation, it logically follows that the number of\nfunctional tasks and their regulators increases faster than linearly with the\ntotal number of genes encoding enzymes. Genomes can also shrink, e.g., because\nof a loss of a nutrient from the environment, followed by deletion of its\nregulator and all enzymes that become redundant.

Toolbox\nmodel was recently proposed to explain this scaling for metabolic enzymes and\ntheir regulators. According to its rules the metabolic network of an organism\nevolves by horizontal transfer of pathways from other species. These pathways\nare part of a larger \"universal\" network formed by the union of all\nspecies-specific networks. It remained to be understood, however, how the\ntopological properties of this universal network influence the scaling law of\nfunctional content of genomes. In this study we answer this question by first\nanalyzing the scaling properties of the toolbox model on arbitrary tree-like\nuniversal networks. We mathematically prove that the critical branching\ntopology, in which the average number of upstream neighbors of a node is equal\nto one, is both necessary and sufficient for the quadratic scaling. Conversely,\nthe toolbox model on trees with exponentially expanding, supercritical topology\nis characterized by the linear scaling with logarithmic corrections. We further\ngeneralize our model to include reactions with multiple substrates/products as\nwell as branched or cyclic metabolic pathways. Unlike the original model the\nnew version employs evolutionary optimized pathways with the smallest number of\nreactions necessary to achieve their metabolic tasks. Numerical simulations of\nthis most realistic model on the universal network from the KEGG database again\nproduced approximately quadratic scaling.

The runs reported on\nhere incorporate the dynamical effects of a gas disk, where the Adachi et al.\n(1976) prescription of aerodynamic gas drag is implemented for all bodies. In\nsome cases the Papaloizou and Larwood (2000) prescription of Type-I migration\nfor the planet are implemented, as well as a mass distribution. In the gas-free\ncases, rapid planet migration was observed - at a rate independent of the\nplanet's mass - provided the planet's mass was not large compared to the mass\nin planetesimals capable of entering its Hill sphere. In such cases, both\ninward and outward migrations can be self-sustaining, but there is a strong\npropensity for inward migration. When a gas disk is present, aerodynamic drag\ncan substantially modify the dynamics of scattered planetesimals. For\nsufficiently large or small mono-dispersed planetesimals, the planet typically\nmigrates inward. However, for a range of plausible planetesimal sizes (i.e.\n0.5-5.0 km at 5.0 AU in a minimum mass Hayashi disk) outward migration is\nusually triggered, often accompanied by substantial planetary mass accretion.\nThe origins of this behaviour are explained in terms of a toy model. The\neffects of including a size distribution and torques associated with Type-I\nmigration are also discussed.\n","Comment: 37 pages, 17 figures, Accepted for publication in Icarus"]}]

This model is sampled while the robot is tracking reference\ntrajectories that excite the system dynamics. This allows using linear\nleast-squares techniques to estimate the parameters. The efficiency of this\nmethod has been proved through the experimental identification of many\nprototypes and industrial robots. However, this method requires the joint\nforce/torque and position measurements and the estimate of the joint velocity\nand acceleration, through the bandpass filtering of the joint position at high\nsampling rates.

The optimal parameters minimize the 2-norm of\nthe error between the actual force/torque and the simulated force/torque.

But it is very difficult to control the initial data\ndistribution because every user has the freedom to share any data with other\nusers. The system scalability can be improved by distributing the load across\nmultiple servers which is proposed by replication. The large scale content\ndistribution systems were improved broadly using the replication techniques.\nThe demanded contents can be brought closer to the clients by multiplying the\nsource of information geographically, which in turn reduce both the access\nlatency and the network traffic. In addition to this, due to the intrinsic\ndynamism of the P2P environment, static data distribution cannot be expected to\nguarantee good load balancing. If the hot peers become bottleneck, it leads to\nincreased user response time and significant performance degradation of the\nsystem. Hence an effective load balancing mechanism is necessary in such cases\nand it can be attained efficiently by intelligent data replication. In this\npaper, we propose a cluster based replication architecture for load-balancing\nin peer-to-peer content distribution systems. In addition to an intelligent\nreplica placement technique, it also consists of an effective load balancing\ntechnique. In the intelligent replica placement technique, peers are grouped\ninto strong and weak clusters based on their weight vector which comprises\navailable capacity, CPU speed, access latency and memory size. In order to\nachieve complete load balancing across the system, an intracluster and\ninter-cluster load balancing algorithms are proposed.

Even though there is basically just one number to look at, the\nelectron-positron pair distribution function at zero distance, it is exactly\nthis number that dictates how the full pair distribution behaves: In most\ncases, it falls off monotonously towards unity as the distance increases. Cases\nwhere the electron-positron pair distribution exhibits a dip are precursors to\nthe formation of bound electron--positron pairs. The formation of\nelectron-positron pairs is indicated by a divergence of the FHNC-EL equations,\nfrom this we can estimate the density regime where positrons must be localized.\nThis occurs in our calculations in the range 9.4 <= r_s <=10, where r_s is the\ndimensionless density parameter of the electron liquid.\n","Comment: To appear in Phys.

It is based on a\ngeometric evolution from Finsler to Riemann structures defined in ${\\bf TM}$.\nQuantum states are generated and interpreted as equivalence classes, composed\nby the configurations that evolve through an internal dynamics, to the same\nfinal state. The existence of an hermitian scalar product in an associated\nlinear space is discussed and related with the quantum pre-Hilbert space. This\nhermitian product emerges from geometric and statistical considerations. Our\nscheme recovers the main ingredients of the usual Quantum Mechanics. Several\ntestable consequences of our scheme are discussed and compared with usual\nQuantum Mechanics. A tentative solution of the cosmological constant problem is\nproposed, as well as a mechanism for the absence of quantum interferences at\nclassical scales.\n","Comment: paper withdrawn"]}]
