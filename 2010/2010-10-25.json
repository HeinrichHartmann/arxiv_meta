For a given core mass, a\nlower bound has been determined on the mass of the helium shell required for\ndynamical burning during a helium flash, which is a necessary prerequisite for\ndetonation. For a range of core and corresponding minimum helium shell masses,\nwe investigate whether an assumed surface helium detonation is capable of\ntriggering a subsequent detonation in the core even for this limiting case. We\ncarried out hydrodynamic simulations on a co-expanding Eulerian grid in two\ndimensions assuming rotational symmetry.

Some scholars have proposed that information\nshould provide the central explanatory principle in biology, in the sense that\nany behavioral strategy that is optimal for an organism's survival must\nnecessarily involve efficient information processing. We challenge this view by\nproviding a counterexample. We present an analytically tractable model for a\nparticular instance of a perception-action loop: a creature searching for a\nfood source confined to a one-dimensional ring world. The model incorporates\nthe statistical structure of the creature's world, the effects of the\ncreature's actions on that structure, and the creature's strategic decision\nprocess. The model takes the form of a Markov process on an infinite\ndimensional state space. To analyze it we construct an exact coarse graining\nthat reduces the model to a Markov process on a finite number of \"information\nstates\". This technique allows us to make quantitative comparisons between the\nperformance of an information-theoretically optimal strategy with other\ncandidate strategies on a food gathering task. We find that: 1. Information\noptimal search does not necessarily optimize utility (expected food gain). 2.\nThe rank ordering of search strategies by information performance does not\npredict their ordering by expected food obtained. 3. The relative advantage of\ndifferent strategies depends on the statistical structure of the environment,\nin particular the variability of motion of the source.

The\nratio $G=D/F$ is found to have a strong influence on the polymer film\nmorphology. Spatial and temporal behavior of kinetic roughening has been\nextensively studied using finite-length scaling and height-height correlations\n$H(r,t)$. The scaling analysis has been performed within the no-overhang\napproximation and the scaling behaviors at local and global length scales were\nfound to be very different. The global and local scaling exponents for\nmorphological evolution have been evaluated for varying free-monomer diffusion\nby growing the films at $G$ = $10$, $10^2$, $10^3$, and $10^4$ and fixing the\ndeposition flux $F$. With an increase in $G$ from $10$ to $10^4$, the average\ngrowth exponent $\\beta \\approx 0.50$ was found to be invariant, where as the\nglobal roughness exponent $\\alpha_{g}$ decreased from $0.87(1)$ to $0.73(1)$\nalong with a corresponding decrease in the global dynamic exponent $z_g$ from\n$1.71(1)$ to $1.38(2)$. The global scaling exponents were observed to follow\nthe dynamic scaling hypothesis, $z_g=\\alpha_{g}/\\beta$. With a similar increase\nin $G$ however, the average local roughness exponent ${\\alpha_{l}}$ remained\nclose to $0.46$ and the anomalous growth exponent ${\\beta}_{\\ast}$ decreased\nfrom 0.23(4) to 0.18(8). The interfaces display anomalous scaling and\nmultiscaling in the relevant height-height correlations.

At zero doping there exists a quantum\ncritical point at the dimensionless coupling J/t = 1.91 and the s- and d-wave\nsolutions are degenerate for low temperatures. At finite doping the d-wave\nsolution has a significantly higher Tc than the s-wave solution. By using\ndensity functional theory we show that the doping induced from sulfur\nabsorption on a graphite layer is enough to cause an electronically driven\nd-wave superconductivity at graphite-sulfur interfaces.
