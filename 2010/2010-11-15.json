In regular bipartite graphs, however, a matching is\nknown to be computable in O(m) time (due to Cole, Ost and Schirra). In a recent\nline of work by Goel, Kapralov and Khanna the O(m) time algorithm was improved\nfirst to \\tilde O(min{m, n^{2.5}/d}) and then to \\tilde O(min{m, n^2/d}). It\nwas also shown that the latter algorithm is optimal up to polylogarithmic\nfactors among all algorithms that use non-adaptive uniform sampling to reduce\nthe size of the graph as a first step.\n  In this paper, we give a randomized algorithm that finds a perfect matching\nin a d-regular graph and runs in O(n\\log n) time (both in expectation and with\nhigh probability). The algorithm performs an appropriately truncated random\nwalk on a modified graph to successively find augmenting paths.

Methods: Data from Swift-BAT, -XRT and -UVOT together with data from\na number of different ground-based optical/NIR and millimeter telescopes\nallowed us to follow the afterglow evolution from about a minute from the\nhigh-energy event down to the host galaxy limit. We discuss the physical\nparameters required to model these emissions. Results: The prompt emission of\nGRB060908 was characterized by two main periods of activity, spaced by a few\nseconds of low intensity, with a tight correlation between activity and\nspectral hardness. Observations of the afterglow began less than one minute\nafter the high-energy event, when it was already in a decaying phase, and it\nwas characterized by a rather flat optical/NIR spectrum which can be\ninterpreted as due to a hard energy-distribution of the emitting electrons. On\nthe other hand, the X-ray spectrum of the afterglow could be fit by a rather\nsoft electron distribution. Conclusions: GRB060908 is a good example of a\ngamma-ray burst with a rich multi-wavelength set of observations. The\navailability of this dataset, built thanks to the joint efforts of many\ndifferent teams, allowed us to carry out stringent tests for various\ninterpretative scenarios showing that a satisfactorily modeling of this event\nis challenging. In the future, similar efforts will enable us to obtain\noptical/NIR coverage comparable in quality and quantity to the X-ray data for\nmore events, therefore opening new avenues to progress gamma-ray burst\nresearch.\n","Comment: A&A, in press. 11 pages, 5 figures"]}]

On this basis, aging can be understood in terms of a progressive loss\nof complexity with age; this suggests that complexity in living systems would\nevolve with age. In general, aging dynamics is mathematically depicted by a\nsurvival function, which monotonically changes from 1 to 0 with age.

The key challenges are due to run time vs.\naccuracy tradeoffs of the imaging models used for the computational\nlithography.

In the online step, the RBM model\ncan be solved very fast for arbitrary illumination and geometrical parameters,\nsuch as dimensions of OPC features, line widths, etc. This approach\ndramatically reduces computational costs of the optimization procedure while\nproviding accuracy superior to the approaches involving simplified mask models.\nRBM furthermore provides rigorous error estimators, which assure the quality\nand reliability of the reduced basis solutions.

After some comments on the nature and\nnecessity of decoherence in open systems and its absence in closed ones, we\nprove sharp, state-independent inequalities reflecting the Heisenberg\nprinciple, the necessity of decoherence and the impossibility of perfect joint\nmeasurement. These bounds are used to judge how far a particular measurement is\nremoved from the optimal one. We do this for a qubit interacting with the\nquantized EM field, continually probed using homodyne detection. We calculate\nto which extent this joint measurement is optimal. We then propose a two-step\nstrategy to determine the (possibly mixed) state of n identically prepared\nqubits, and prove that it is asymptotically optimal in a local minimax sense,\nusing `Quantum Local Asymptotic Normality' for qubits. We propose a physical\nimplementation of QLAN, based on interaction with the quantized EM field.

We slightly extend this notion to\n`infinitesimal naturality', requiring only vector fields (infinitesimal\ndiffeomorphisms) to lift. We classify these bundles. Physical fields that\ntransform under (infinitesimal) space-time transformations must be described in\nterms of (infinitesimally) natural bundles. All spin structures are\ninfinitesimally natural. Our framework thus encompasses Fermionic fields, for\nwhich the notion of a natural bundle is too restrictive. Interestingly,\ngeneralized spin structures (e.g. spin-c structures) are not always\ninfinitesimally natural. We classify the ones that are.

Accurate knowledge of these energies is of primary importance to set\nthe absolute energy scale for the measurement of the W boson mass. The beam\nenergy between 80 and 104 GeV is derived from continuous measurements of the\nmagnetic bending field by 16 NMR probes situated in a number of the LEP\ndipoles.

Moreover, in the cases of unit arc capacities and\nunit ``node capacities'' the blocking skew-symmetric flow algorithm has time\nbounds similar to those established in Even and Tarjan (1975) and Karzanov\n(1973) for Dinits' algorithm. In particular, this implies an algorithm for\nfinding a maximum matching in a nonbipartite graph in $O(\\sqrt{n}m)$ time,\nwhich matches the time bound for the algorithm of Micali and Vazirani. Finally,\nextending a clique compression technique of Feder and Motwani to particular\nskew-symmetric graphs, we speed up the implied maximum matching algorithm to\nrun in $O(\\sqrt{n}m\\log(n^2/m)/\\log{n})$ time, improving the best known bound\nfor dense nonbipartite graphs.\n  Also other theoretical and algorithmic results on skew-symmetric flows and\ntheir applications are presented.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 3 figures, to appear in Mathematical Programming, minor\n  stylistic corrections and shortenings to the original version"]}]
