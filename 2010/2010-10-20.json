If the system in equilibrium is subject to the\nconservation constraint of some extensive property (e.g. volume, material, or\nenergy conservation), the Euler equation determining the stationary point\ncorresponding to the equilibrium alters according to the method of Lagrange\nmultipliers. Here, the question as to how the effects of constraints can be\ntaken into account in a stability analysis based on second functional\nderivatives is examined. It is shown that the concept of constrained second\nderivatives incorporates all the effects due to constraints; therefore\nconstrained second derivatives provide the proper tool for the stability\nanalysis of equilibria under constraints. For a physically important type of\nconstraints, it is demonstrated how the presented theory works. Further, the\nrigorous derivation of a recently obtained stability condition for a special\ncase of equilibrium of ultrathin-film binary mixtures is given, presenting a\nguide for similar analyses.

The narrow extraction of the GRAPES data around the galaxy center\nenables us to study the spectrum of the bulges in these late-type galaxies,\nminimizing the contamination from the disk of the galaxy. We use the low\nresolution (R~50) spectral energy distribution (SED) around the 4000A break to\nestimate redshifts and stellar ages. The SEDs are compared with models of\ngalactic chemical evolution to determine the stellar mass, and to characterize\nthe age distribution. We find that, (1) the average age of late-type bulges in\nour sample is ~1.3 Gyr with stellar masses in the range log(M)=6.5-10 solar.\n(2) Late-type bulges are younger than early-type galaxies at similar redshifts\nand lack a trend of age with respect to redshift, suggesting a more extended\nperiod of star formation. (3) Bulges and inner disks in these late-type\ngalaxies show similar stellar populations, and (4) late-type bulges are better\nfitted by exponential surface brightness profiles.

Under magnetic fields,\nferromagnetic quantum critical fluctuations develop around the\nantiferromagnetic QTCP in addition to antiferromagnetic ones, which is in sharp\ncontrast with the conventional antiferromagnetic quantum critical point.

The procedure starts\nwith dividing the Hilbert space into two subspaces, the low-energy part (\"$d$\nspace'') and the rest of the space (\"$r$ space''). The low-energy model is\nconstructed for the $d$ space by eliminating the degrees of freedom of the $r$\nspace. The thus derived model contains the strength of electron correlation\nexpressed by a partially screened Coulomb interaction, calculated in the\nconstrained random-phase-approximation (cRPA) where screening channels within\nthe $d$ space, $P_d$, are subtracted. One conceptual problem of this\nestablished downfolding method is that for entangled bands it is not clear how\nto cut out the $d$ space and how to distinguish $P_d$ from the total\npolarization. Here, we propose a simple procedure to overcome this difficulty.\nIn our scheme, the $d$ subspace is cut out from the Hilbert space of the Kohn\nSham eigenfunctions with the help of a procedure to construct a localized\nWannier basis. The $r$ subspace is constructed as the complementary space\northogonal to the $d$ subspace. After this disentanglement, $P_d$ becomes well\ndefined. Using the disentangled bands, the effective parameters are uniquely\ndetermined in the cRPA. The method is successfully applied to 3$d$ transition\nmetals.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 4 figures"]}]

It relies on\nMAC burst repetitions and on interference cancellation to increase the\nnormalized throughput of a classic slotted ALOHA access scheme. CRDSA allows\nachieving a larger throughput than slotted ALOHA, at the price of an increased\naverage transmitted power. A way to trade-off the increment of the average\ntransmitted power and the improvement of the throughput is presented in this\npaper. Specifically, it is proposed to divide each MAC burst in k sub-bursts,\nand to encode them via a (n,k) erasure correcting code. The n encoded\nsub-bursts are transmitted over the MAC channel, according to specific\ntime/frequency-hopping patterns. Whenever n-e>=k sub-bursts (of the same burst)\nare received without collisions, erasure decoding allows recovering the\nremaining e sub-bursts (which were lost due to collisions). An interference\ncancellation process can then take place, removing in e slots the interference\ncaused by the e recovered sub-bursts, possibly allowing the correct decoding of\nsub-bursts related to other bursts. The process is thus iterated as for the\nCRDSA case.\n","Comment: Presented at the Future Network and MobileSummit 2010 Conference,\n  Florence (Italy), June 2010"]}]

Use of wider bandwidths that increase signal-to-noise ratios will\ndegrade timing precision if nondispersive chromatic effects are not mitigated.\nThe allowable region in the DM-frequency plane depends on how chromatic timing\nperturbations are addressed. Without mitigation, observations at 1.4~GHz or\n5~GHz are restricted to $\\DM\\lesssim 30$ and $\\lesssim 100~\\DMu$, respectively.\nWith aggressive mitigation of interstellar scattering and use of large\ntelescopes to provide adequate sensitivity at high frequencies (e.g. Arecibo,\nFAST, phase 1 of the SKA, and the SKA), pulsars with DMs up to 500~$\\DMu$ can\nbe used in precision timing applications. We analyze methods that fit arrival\ntimes vs. frequency at a given epoch prior to multi-epoch fitting. While the\nterms of greatest astrophysical interest are achromatic (e.g. orbital and\ngravitational wave perturbations), measurements may ultimately be limited by\nsimilarly achromatic stochasticity in a pulsar's spin rate.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 9 figures, to be submitted to the Astrophysical Journal"]}]

We exemplify our\napproach by studying the dilemma of cooperation in growing populations and show\nthat genuinely stochastic events can ease the dilemma by leading to a transient\nbut robust increase in cooperation\n","Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures and 2 pages supplementary information"]}]

These simulations are\ndriven with synthetic solar wind input conditions, where idealized ULF dynamic\npressure fluctuations are embedded in the upstream solar wind. In three of the\nsimulations, a monochromatic, sinusoidal ULF oscillation is introduced into the\nsolar wind dynamic pressure time series. In the fourth simulation, a continuum\nof ULF fluctuations over the 0-50 mHz frequency band is introduced into the\nsolar wind dynamic pressure time series. In this numerical experiment, the\nidealized solar wind input conditions allow us to study only the effect of a\nfluctuating solar wind dynamic pressure, while holding all of the other solar\nwind driving parameters constant. We show that the monochromatic solar wind\ndynamic pressure fluctuations drive toroidal mode field line resonances (FLRs)\non the dayside, at locations where the upstream driving frequency matches a\nlocal field line eigenfrequency. In addition, we show that the continuum of\nupstream solar wind dynamic pressure fluctuations drives a continuous spectrum\nof toroidal mode FLRs on the dayside. The characteristics of the simulated FLRs\nagree well with FLR observations, including a phase reversal radially across a\npeak in wave power, a change in the sense of polarization across the noon\nmeridian, and a net flux of energy into the ionosphere.\n","Comment: 10 figures, in press"]}]

We find surface\nwaves near the dawn and dusk flank magnetopause and show that these waves are\ngenerated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability. We also find that two KH\nmodes are generated near the magnetopause boundary. One mode, the magnetopause\nKH mode, propagates tailward along the magnetopause boundary. The other mode,\nthe inner KH mode, propagates tailward along the inner edge of the boundary\nlayer (IEBL). We find large vortical structures associated with the inner KH\nmode that are centered on the IEBL. The phase velocities, wavelengths, and\nfrequencies of the two KH modes are computed. The KH waves are found to be\nfairly monochromatic with well defined wavelengths. In addition, the inner and\nmagnetopause KH modes are coupled and lead to a coupled oscillation of the\nlow-latitude boundary layer. The boundary layer thickness, $d$, is computed and\nwe find maximum wave growth for $kd$ = 0.5--1.0, where $k$ is the wave number,\nconsistent with the linear theory of the KH instability.

We show\nthat a soft edge coloring approach to both problems gives rigorous\napproximation guarantees. In the channel assignment problem arising in wireless\nnetworks a pair of edges incident to a vertex are said to be conflicting if the\nchannels assigned to them are the same. Our goal is to assign channels (color\nedges) so that the number of conflicts is minimized. The problem is NP-hard by\na reduction from Edge coloring and we present two combinatorial algorithms for\nthis case. The first algorithm is based on a distributed greedy method and\ngives a solution with at most $2(1-\\frac{1}{k})|E|$ more conflicts than the\noptimal solution.The approximation ratio if the second algorithm is $1 +\n\\frac{|V|}{|E|}$, which gives a ($1 + o(1)$)-factor for dense graphs and is the\nbest possible unless P = NP.

In such systems, data layouts may need to be\nreconfigured over time for load balancing or in the event of system\nfailure/upgrades. It is critical to migrate data to their target locations as\nquickly as possible to obtain the best performance of the system. Most of the\nprevious results on data migration assume that each storage node can perform\nonly one data transfer at a time. However, storage devices tend to have\nheterogeneous capabilities as devices may be added over time due to storage\ndemand increase. We develop algorithms to minimize the data migration time. We\nshow that it is possible to find an optimal migration schedule when all $c_v$'s\nare even. Furthermore, though the problem is NP-hard in general, we give an\nefficient soft edge coloring algorithm that offers a rigorous $(1 +\no(1))$-approximation guarantee.\n"]}]

The\nchallenge of the representation is that it must not only capture the\ncharacteristics of the shape but also be invariant to relevant transformations.\nInvariance to geometric transformations, such as translation, rotation, and\nscale, has received attention in the past, usually under the assumption that\nthe points are previously labeled, i.e., that the shape is characterized by an\nordered set of landmarks. However, in many practical scenarios, the points\ndescribing the shape are obtained from automatic processes, e.g., edge or\ncorner detection, thus without labels or natural ordering. Obviously, the\ncombinatorial problem of computing the correspondences between the points of\ntwo shapes in the presence of the aforementioned geometrical distortions\nbecomes a quagmire when the number of points is large. We circumvent this\nproblem by representing shapes in a way that is invariant to the permutation of\nthe landmarks, i.e., we represent bags of unlabeled 2D points. Within our\nframework, a shape is mapped to an analytic function on the complex plane,\nleading to what we call its analytic signature (ANSIG). To store an ANSIG, it\nsuffices to sample it along a closed contour in the complex plane. We show that\nthe ANSIG is a maximal invariant with respect to the permutation group, i.e.,\nthat different shapes have different ANSIGs and shapes that differ by a\npermutation (or re-labeling) of the landmarks have the same ANSIG. We further\nshow how easy it is to factor out geometric transformations when comparing\nshapes using the ANSIG representation.
