Central to the idea of typicality is that a sequence $x_1, x_2,\n..., x_n$ that is $P_X$-typical should, loosely speaking, have an empirical\ndistribution that is in some sense close to the distribution $P_X$. The two\nmost common notions of typicality are that of strong (letter) typicality and\nweak (entropy) typicality. While weak typicality allows one to apply many\narguments that can be made with strongly typical arguments, some arguments for\nstrong typicality cannot be generalized to weak typicality. In this paper, we\nconsider an alternate definition of typicality, namely one based on the weak*\ntopology and that is applicable to Polish alphabets (which includes\n$\\reals^n$). This notion is a generalization of strong typicality in the sense\nthat it degenerates to strong typicality in the finite alphabet case, and can\nalso be applied to mixed and continuous distributions. Furthermore, it is\nstrong enough to prove a Markov lemma, and thus can be used to directly prove a\nmore general class of results than weak typicality. As an example of this\ntechnique, we directly prove achievability for Gel'fand-Pinsker channels with\ninput constraints for a large class of alphabets and channels without first\nproving a finite alphabet result and then resorting to delicate quantization\narguments. While this large class does not include Gaussian distributions with\npower constraints, it is shown to be straightforward to recover this case by\nconsidering a sequence of truncated Gaussian distributions.\n","Comment: Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory. 29 pages."]}]
