Secondly, for\npulsars with significant magnetospheric activities, the pulsar spindown\nluminosities may have been as the sources of the thermal energy via reversing\nplasma current flows. A phenomenological study between pulsar bolometric X-ray\nluminosities and the spin energy loss rates presents the probable existence of\na 1/2-law or a linear law, i.e. $L_{\\rm bol}^{\\infty}\\propto\\dot{E}^{1/2}$ or\n$L_{\\rm bol}^{\\infty}\\propto\\dot{E}$. This result together with the thermal\nproperties of solid quark stars allow us to calculate the thermal evolution of\nsuch stars. Thermal evolution curves, or cooling curves, are calculated and\ncompared with the `temperature-age' data obtained from 17 active X-ray pulsars.\nIt is shown that the bolometric X-ray observations of these sources are\nconsistent with the solid quark star pulsar model.\n","Comment: Astroparticle Physics Accepted"]}]

Nevertheless, many industrial\nfluids and consumer products are non-Newtonian, and their rheological\nproperties affect their flow behavior. The present work aims at studying the\ndynamics of cylindrical jets of a viscoelastic, shear-thinning solution of\ncetylpyridinium salt (CPyCl). In concentrated solutions, CPyCl surfactant\nmolecules have been shown to assemble in long wormlike micellar structures,\nwhich gives the fluid its non-Newtonian properties. Jets of this fluid show\nnovel features compared to their Newtonian counterparts, including a type of\nmotion, in which the jet folds back and forth on itself in a fashion similar to\nsheets of viscous fluids, instead of coiling around the vertical axis as\ncylindrical Newtonian jets do. Another novel feature of CPyCl micellar fluid\njets is a widening of the jet above the plate reminiscent of the die-swell\nphenomenon that we call \\emph{reverse swell}. We propose physical mechanisms\nfor both folding and reverse swell, and compare theoretical predictions to\nexperimental measurements. In addition, we systematically explore different\nflow regimes in the parameter space of the height of fall and flow rate and\ncompare regime maps of a CPyCl micellar solution and a Newtonian silicone oil.\n","Comment: 55 pages, 15 figures"]}]

UBVRI\n  Photometry of Stars in Seven Dwarfs and a Comparison of the Entire Sample"],"description":["  We have obtained UBVRI images with the Kitt Peak and Cerro Tololo 4-m\ntelescopes and Mosaic cameras of seven dwarfs in (or near) the Local Group, all\nof which have known evidence of recent star formation: IC10, NGC 6822, WLM,\nSextans B, Sextans A, Pegasus,and Phoenix. We construct color-magnitude\ndiagrams (CMDs) of these systems, as well as neighboring regions that can be\nused to evaluate the degree of foreground contamination by stars in the Milky\nWay. Inter-comparison of these CMDs with those of M31, M33, the LMC, and the\nSMC permits us to determine improved reddening values for a typical OB star\nfound within these galaxies. All of the CMDs reveal a strong or modest number\nof blue supergiants. All but Pegasus and Phoenix also show the clear presence\nof red supergiants in the CMD, although IC10 appears to be deficient in these\nobjects given its large WR population. The bright stars of intermediate color\nin the CMD are badly contaminated by foreground stars (30-100%), and\nconsiderable spectroscopy is needed before statistics on the yellow supergiants\nin these systems will be known. This study is intended to serve both as the\nimpetus and \"finding charts\" for further space-based imaging, and for many\nspectroscopic programs at large aperture.\n","Comment: Added Erratum.

Moreover, we restrict the set of possible lengths of\nthe cycles of the $s_i(n)$'s: we fix sets $A_1,..., A_k$ of positive integers\nand suppose that for all $n$, for all $i$, $s_i(n)$ is uniformly distributed on\nthe set of permutations of $\\{1,..., n\\}$ which have all their cycle lengths in\n$A_i$. For all positive integer $l$, we are going to give asymptotics, as $n$\ngoes to infinity, on the number $N_l(\\sigma_n)$ of cycles of length $l$ of\n$\\sigma_n$. We shall also consider the joint distribution of the random vectors\n$(N_1(\\sigma_n),..., N_l(\\sigma_n))$. We first prove that the order of $w$ in a\ncertain quotient of the free group with generators $g_1,..., g_k$ determines\nthe rate of growth of the random variables $N_l(\\sigma_n)$ as $n$ goes to\ninfinity. We also prove that in many cases, the distribution of $N_l(\\sigma_n)$\nconverges to a Poisson law with parameter $1/l$ and that the random variables\n$N_1(\\sigma_n),N_2(\\sigma_n), ...$ are asymptotically independent. We notice\nthe surprising fact that from this point of view, many things happen as if\n$\\sigma_n$ were uniformly distributed on the $n$-th symmetric group.\n","Comment: 28 pages"]}]

The\nvariation of the function F is proportional to the variation of the entropy\ngeneration, the maxima and minima of F has been evaluated in a previous paper\nwithout giving the physical foundation of the method.
