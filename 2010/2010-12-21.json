In this thesis,\nwe argue however that these signals are plagued by irreducible astrophysical\nbackgrounds and show how plausible conventional physics can mimic the alleged\ndark matter signals. In particular, we consider the possibility that the rise\nin the positron fraction observed by the PAMELA satellite is due to the\nproduction through (hadronic) cosmic ray spallation and subsequent acceleration\nof positrons, in the same sources as the primary cosmic rays. We present a new\nanalytical estimate of the range of possible fluctuations in the high energy\nelectron flux due to the discreteness of plausible cosmic ray sources. Fitting\nour result for the total electron-positron flux measured by the Fermi satellite\nallows us to fix the only free parameter of the model and make an independent\nprediction for the positron fraction. This model can be tested by considering\nsimilar effects expected for nuclear secondary-to-primary ratios such as B/C. A\nrise predicted above O(100) GeV/n would be an unique confirmation of our\nexplanation for a rising positron fraction and rule out the dark matter\nexplanation. Furthermore, we review the assumptions made in the extraction of\nthe `WMAP haze' which has also been claimed to be due to electrons and\npositrons from dark matter annihilation in the Galactic centre region. We argue\nthat the energy-dependence of their diffusion makes the extraction of the haze\nthrough template fitting unreliable. The systematic effects introduced by this\ncan, under specific circumstances, reproduce the residual, suggesting that the\n`haze' may be just an artefact of the template subtraction.\n","Comment: 161 pages, 50 figures, D.Phil. thesis, University of Oxford (2010)"]}]

In these rather simple\nsystems, it is well-known that TDDFT methods using conventional hybrid\nfunctionals surprisingly fail in describing the low-lying La and Lb valence\nstates, resulting in large, growing errors for the La state and an incorrect\nenergetic ordering as a function of molecular size. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that the range-separated formalism largely eliminates both of these\nerrors and also provides a consistent description of excitonic properties in\nthese systems. We further demonstrate that re-optimizing the percentage of\nHartree-Fock exchange in conventional hybrids to match wavefunction-based\nbenchmark calculations still yields serious errors, and a full 100%\nHartree-Fock range separation is essential for simultaneously describing both\nof the La and Lb transitions. Based on an analysis of electron-hole transition\ndensity matrices, we finally show that conventional hybrid functionals\noverdelocalize excitons and underestimate quasiparticle energy gaps in the\nacene systems.

The gravitational\nvector potential produced by a moving gravitational source can be obtained by\napplying Lorentz transformations in local gravitational field. Although\ninertial and non-inertial frames are equally valid in describing the motion of\nbodies in gravitational field, we still regard inertial frame, i.e. center of\nmass of the system, as the preferred frame of reference. This is because\nNewton's laws of motion only hold for inertial frames.
