The MMPC algorithm is the first stage of the Maximum Minimum\nHill Climbing algorithm for learning the directed acyclic graph of a Bayesian\nnetwork, introduced by previous authors. The MMHC algorithm runs in two phases;\nfirstly, the MMPC algorithm to locate the skeleton and secondly an edge\norientation phase. The computationally expensive part is the edge orientation\nphase.\n  The first modification introduced to the MMPC algorithm, which requires\nlittle additional computational cost, is to obtain the immoralities and hence\nthe essential graph. This renders the edge orientation phase, the\ncomputationally expensive part, unnecessary, since the entire Markov structure\nthat can be derived from data is present in the essential graph.\n  Secondly, the MMPC algorithm can accept independence statements that are\nlogically inconsistent with those rejected, since with tests for independence,\na `do not reject' conclusion for a particular independence statement is taken\nas `accept' independence. An example is given to illustrate this and a\nmodification is suggested to ensure that the conditional independence\nstatements are logically consistent.\n  Thirdly, the MMHC algorithm makes an assumption of faithfulness. An example\nof a data set is given that does not satisfy this assumption and a modification\nis suggested to deal with some situations where the assumption is not\nsatisfied. The example in question also illustrates problems with the\n`faithfulness' assumption that cannot be tackled by this modification.\n","Comment: 55 pages"]}]

Although various modeling approaches exist, they are\ngenerally not compatible and mutually consistent, and empirical data often do\nnot allow one to decide what model is the right one, the best one, or most\nappropriate one. Moreover, as the recent financial and economic crisis shows,\nrelying on a single, idealized model can be very costly. This contribution\ntries to shed new light on problems that arise when complex systems are\nmodeled. While the arguments can be transferred to many different systems, the\nrelated scientific challenges are illustrated for social, economic, and traffic\nsystems. The contribution discusses issues that are sometimes overlooked and\ntries to overcome some frequent misunderstandings and controversies of the\npast.

Using the epoch-folding method, we successfully detected\na pulsed period of 407.69(2) sec in the outburst of January and of 407.26(1)\nsec after the flare detection in March. We find that the spectral detection for\nthe source during outburst can be described by a blackbody model with a high\ntemperature (kT ~ 1-3 keV) and a small radius (R ~ 1 km), indicating that the\nemission results from the polar cap of the neutron star. On the other hand, the\nspectra obtained after the outburst can further be described by adding an\nadditional component with a lower temperature (kT ~ 0.1-0.2 keV) and a larger\nemission radius (R ~ 10-500 km), which indicates the emission from around the\ninner region of an accretion disk. We find that the thermal emission from the\nhot spot of the accreting neutron star dominates the radiation in outburst; the\nexistence of both this X-ray contribution and the additional soft component\nsuggest that the polar cap and the accretion disk emission might co-exist after\nthe outburst. Because the two-blackbody signature at the flaring stage is a\nunique feature of 1A 1118-615, our spectral results may provide a new insight\nto interpret the X-ray emission for the accreting neutron star.
