Mutants appear as a result of mutation of the resident\nspecies, while migrants have no correlation with the resident species.

In contrast to mutation models, which\nshow intermittent dynamics of quasi-steady states interrupted by sudden\nreorganizations of the community, migration models show smooth and gradual\nrenewal of the community. As a consequence, instead of the $1/f$ diversity\nfluctuations found for the mutation models, $1/f^2$, random-walk like\nfluctuations are observed for the migration models. In addition, a\ncharacteristic species-lifetime distribution is found: a power law that is cut\noff by a \"skewed\" distribution in the long-lifetime regime. The latter has a\nlonger tail than a simple exponential function, which indicates an\nage-dependent species-mortality function.

In some situations, the demands may become too high\nfor a person. This article has a three-fold goal. First, it presents and\ncritiques methods to measure cognitive load. Second, it explores the\ndistribution of load across search task stages. Finally, it seeks to improve\nour understanding of factors affecting cognitive load levels in information\nsearch. To this end, a controlled Web search experiment with forty-eight\nparticipants was conducted. Interaction logs were used to segment search tasks\nsemi-automatically into task stages. Cognitive load was assessed using a new\nvariant of the dual-task method. Average cognitive load was found to vary by\nsearch task stages. It was significantly higher during query formulation and\nuser description of a relevant document as compared to examining search results\nand viewing individual documents. Semantic information shown next to the search\nresults lists in one of the studied interfaces was found to decrease mental\ndemands during query formulation and examination of the search results list.\nThese findings demonstrate that changes in dynamic cognitive load can be\ndetected within search tasks. Dynamic assessment of cognitive load is of core\ninterest to information science because it enriches our understanding of\ncognitive demands imposed on people engaged in the search process by a task and\nthe interactive information retrieval system employed.\n","Comment: To appear in the Journal of the American Society for Information\n  Science & Technology (JASIST)"]}]

It can thus give information on the\nstar formation history of the universe. However, it is difficult to measure\ndirectly due to foreground radiation fields from the Galaxy and solar system.\nGamma-rays from extragalactic sources at cosmological distances (blazars and\ngamma-ray bursts) interact with EBL photons creating electron-positron pairs,\nabsorbing the gamma-rays. Given the intrinsic gamma-ray spectrum of a source\nand its redshift, the EBL can in principle be measured. However, the intrinsic\ngamma-ray spectra of blazars and GRBs can vary considerably from source to\nsource and the from the same source over short timescales. A maximum intrinsic\nspectrum can be assumed from theoretical grounds, to give upper limits on the\nEBL absorption from blazars at low redshift with very high energy (VHE)\ngamma-ray observations with ground-based Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The\nFermi-LAT observations of blazars and GRBs can probe EBL absorption at higher\nredshifts. The lower energy portion of the LAT spectrum of these sources is\nunattenuated by the EBL, so that extrapolating this to higher energies can give\nthe maximum intrinsic spectrum for a source. Comparing this to the observed\nhigher energy LAT spectrum will then give upper limits on the EBL absorption.\nFor blazars which have been detected by both the Fermi-LAT and at higher\nenergies by Cherenkov telescopes, combined LAT-VHE observations can put more\nstringent constraints on the low redshift EBL. These procedures above can also\nbe reversed: for sources with an unknown redshift, a given EBL model and\ngamma-ray spectrum can lead to an upper limit on the source's redshift.\n","Comment: 4 page, 1 figure.

In many cases, the released\nenergy seems to take the form of large numbers of electrons accelerated to high\nenergies or alternatively plasma heated to very high temperatures. The\ntransport of this energy into the remaining portion of the atmosphere results\nin violent mass motion and strong emission across the electromagnetic spectrum.\nOne important phenomenon observed during flares is the appearance in coronal\nmagnetic loops of large amounts of upflowing, soft X-ray emitting plasma. It is\nbelieved that this is due to chromospheric evaporation, the process of heating\ncool chromospheric material beyond its ability to radiate. The pressure\nincrease in the evaporated plasma leads to a number of interesting phenomena in\nthe flare chromosphere. The sudden pressure increase initiates a downward\nmoving \"chromospheric condensation\", an overdense region which gradually\ndecelerates as it accretes material and propagates into the gravitationally\nstratified chromosphere. Solutions to an equation of motion for this\ncondensation shows that its motion decays after about one minute of propagation\ninto the chromosphere. When the front of this downflowing region is supersonic\nrelative to the atmosphere ahead of it, a radiating shock will form. If the\ndownflow is rapid enough, the shock strength should be sufficient to excite UV\nradiation normally associated with the transition region, and furthermore, the\nradiating shock will be brighter than the transition region. These results lead\nto a number of observationally testable relationships between the optical and\nultraviolet spectra from the condensation and radiating shock.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 6 figures; Radiation Hydrodynamics in Stars and Compact\n  Objects, Ed.

In many types of\nelectron spin qubits, the primary source of decoherence is the interaction\nbetween the electron spins and nuclear spins of the host lattice. For electrons\nin gate defined GaAs quantum dots, previous spin echo measurements have\nrevealed coherence times of about 1 $\\mu$s at low magnetic fields below 100 mT.\nHere, we show that coherence in such devices can actually survive to much\nlonger times, and provide a detailed understanding of the measured nuclear spin\ninduced decoherence. At fields above a few hundred millitesla, the coherence\ntime measured using a single-pulse spin echo extends to 30 $\\mu$s. At lower\nmagnetic fields, the echo first collapses, but then revives at later times\ngiven by the period of the relative Larmor precession of different nuclear\nspecies. This behavior was recently predicted, and as we show can be\nquantitatively accounted for by a semi-classical model for the electron spin\ndynamics in the presence of a nuclear spin bath. Using a multiple-pulse\nCarr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill echo sequence, the decoherence time can be extended\nto more than 200 $\\mu$s, which represents an improvement by two orders of\nmagnitude compared to previous measurements. This demonstration of effective\nmethods to mitigate nuclear spin induced decoherence puts the quantum error\ncorrection threshold within reach.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures.
