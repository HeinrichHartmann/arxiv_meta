In particular, we characterize the first three\nleading terms in the asymptotic expression of the joint probability density\nfunction (p.d.f.) of the random shear tensor at a general point in the lens\nplane due to point masses in the limit of an infinite number of stars.

As a consequence, the p.d.f.s of the shear\ncomponents are seen to converge, in the limit of an infinite number of stars,\nto shifted Cauchy distributions, which shows that the shear components have\nheavy tails in that limit. The asymptotic p.d.f. of the shear magnitude in the\nlimit of an infinite number of stars is also presented. Extending to general\nrandom distributions of the lenses, we employ the Kac-Rice formula and Morse\ntheory to deduce general formulas for the expected total number of images and\nthe expected number of saddle images.

Our focus is on the effect of nuclear dissociation below\nthe shock on the linear growth, and non-linear saturation, of non-radial\noscillations of the shocked fluid. We combine two-dimensional, time-dependent\nhydrodynamic simulations using FLASH2.5 with a solution to the linear\neigenvalue problem, and demonstrate the consistency of the two approaches.\nPrevious studies of this `Standing Accretion Shock Instability' (SASI) have\nfocused either on zero-energy accretion flows without nuclear dissociation, or\nmade use of a detailed finite-temperature nuclear equation of state and\nincluded strong neutrino heating. Our main goal in this and subsequent papers\nis to introduce equations of state of increasing complexity, in order to\nisolate the various competing effects. In this work we employ an ideal gas\nequation of state with a constant rate of nuclear dissociation below the shock,\nand do not include neutrino heating. We find that a negative Bernoulli\nparameter below the shock significantly lowers the real frequency, growth rate,\nand saturation amplitude of the SASI. A decrease in the adiabatic index has\nsimilar effects. The non-linear development of the instability is characterized\nby an expansion of the shock driven by turbulent kinetic energy at nearly\nconstant internal energy. Our results also provide further insight into the\ninstability mechanism: the rate of growth of a particular mode is fastest when\nthe radial advection time from the shock to the accretor overlaps with the\nperiod of a standing lateral sound wave. The fastest-growing mode can therefore\nbe modified by nuclear dissociation.\n","Comment: Version accepted by ApJ.

For the alignment without high-J attractors,\nbeside the earlier studied attractors with low angular momentum (low-J\nattractors), there appears new low-J attractors. The former and later cases\ncorrespond to the alignment with long axes perpendicular and parallel to the\nangular momentum, respectively. In addition, we study the alignment of grains\nin the presence of strong internal relaxation, but induced not by a radiation\nbeam as in earlier studies, instead, induced by a complex radiation field, that\ncan be decomposed into dipole and quadrupole components. We find that in this\nsituation, the parameter space $q^{max}$, for the existence of high-$J$\nattractors is more extended, which entails higher degrees of polarization\nexpected. Our obtained results are useful for modeling polarization arising\nfrom aligned grains in molecular clouds and accretion disks.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 19 figures, submitted to Astrophysical Journal, comments by\n  the referee included"]}]

In such processes, pQCD not only\npredicts the hard reaction itself, but also the subsequent evolution in terms\nof parton branching and radiation, leading to a parton shower and ultimately to\nan observable jet of hadrons. If the hard process occurs in a heavy-ion\ncollision, a large part of this evolution takes place in the soft medium\ncreated along with the hard reaction. An observation of jets in heavy-ion\ncollision thus allows a study of medium-modified QCD shower evolution. In\nvacuum, Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations are well established tools to describe\nsuch showers. For jet studies in heavy-ion collisions, MC models for in-medium\nshowers are currently being developed. However, the shower-medium interaction\ndepends on the nature of the microscopic degrees of freedom of the medium\ncreated in a heavy-ion collision which is the very object one would like to\ninvestigate.

Motivated by the\ngeneral idea of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we consider a simple construction:\nthe Randall-Sundrum 2 (single brane) setup with the Standard Model fields on\nthe brane and a massive vector field in the warped bulk. We show that in this\nmodel the known properties of vector unparticles -- the nontrivial phase of the\nCFT propagator, the necessity and dominance of contact interactions, the\nunitarity constraint on the conformal dimension of the operator, and the tensor\nstructure dictated by conformal symmetry -- follow by simple inspection of the\nbrane-to-brane propagator. The phase has a physical interpretation as\ncontrolling the rate of escape of unparticles into the extra dimension.\nRequiring the correct sign for the imaginary part of the longitudinal\npolarization of the propagator, we obtain the unitarity condition m_5^2 >= 0,\nwhich, unlike in the scalar case, is unchanged from flat space. This condition\nresults in the unitarity bound d_V >= 3, or, more generally, d_V >= D-1 for a\nvector unparticle in D-dimensional space. It is instructive to consider the RS\n2 propagator in (Euclidean) position space: at large distances it behaves as a\npure CFT propagator, while at short distances it turns into the 5d flat space\npropagator. The latter is softer than the former, thus regulating the would-be\ndivergences of the spectral integral and turning the \"contact\" terms seen at\nlow energies into finite-range interactions. Upon Fourier transforming to\nmomentum space, one finds that at low momenta the CFT piece is subdominant to\nthe \"contact\" interactions.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 2 figures; references added, presentation tweaked, results\n  unchanged"]}]

Our main conclusions are: (1) A dark region with absence of\nstrong vertical magnetic fields broadens and then narrows in Ca \\textsc{ii}\nH-line filtergrams. This phenomenon is consistent with the emergence of the\nhelical flux rope as photospheric counterparts. The size of the flux rope is\nroughly 30,000 km long and 10,000 km wide. The width is larger than that of the\nprominence. (2) No shear motion or converging flows are detected, but we find\ndiverging flows such as mesogranules along the polarity inversion line. The\npresence of mesogranules may be related to the emergence of the helical flux\nrope. (3) The emerging helical flux rope reconnects with magnetic fields of the\npre-existing prominence to stabilize the prominence for the next several days.\nWe thus conjecture that prominence coronal magnetic fields emerge in the form\nof helical flux ropes that contribute to the formation and maintenance of the\nprominence.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 12 figures.

Weak lensing\nobservables are sensitive to both the distance-redshift relation and the growth\nof structure in the Universe. If the cause of accelerated cosmic expansion is\ndark energy within general relativity (GR), both cosmic distances and structure\ngrowth are governed by the properties of dark energy. Consequently, one may use\nlensing to check for this consistency and test GR. After reviewing the\nphenomenology of such tests, we address one major challenge to such a program.\nThe evolution of the baryonic component of the Universe is highly uncertain and\ncan influence lensing observables, manifesting as modified structure growth for\na fixed cosmic distance scale. Using two proposed methods, we show that one\ncould be led to reject the null hypothesis of GR when it is the true theory if\nthis uncertainty in baryonic processes is neglected. Recent simulations suggest\nthat we can correct for baryonic effects using a parametrized model in which\nthe halo mass-concentration relation is modified. The correction renders biases\nsmall compared to statistical uncertainties. We study the ability of future\nweak lensing surveys to constrain the internal structures of halos and test the\nnull hypothesis of GR simultaneously. Compared to nulling information from\nsmall-scales to mitigate sensitivity to baryonic physics, this internal\ncalibration program should provide limits on deviations from GR that are\nseveral times more constraining.

In this paper we propose a new\nmethod to derive bounds in the mchi - <sigmaA*v> plane by using radio continuum\nobservations of Messier 33, paying particular attention to a low emitting Radio\nCavity. The comparison of the expected radio emission due to the galactic dark\nmatter distribution with the observed one provides bounds which are comparable\nto those obtained from a similar analysis of the Milky Way. Remarkably, the\npresent results are simply based on archival data and thus largely improvable\nby means of specifically tailored observations. The potentiality of the method\ncompared with more standard searches is discussed by considering the optimistic\nsituation of a vanishing flux (within the experimental sensitivity) measured\ninside the cavity by a high resolution radio telescope like ALMA. Under the\nbest conditions our technique is able to produce bounds which are comparable to\nthe ones expected after five years of Fermi LAT data taking for an hadronic\nannihilation channel.

A key difference between SN2006gy and other SNeIIn is that, owing to its\nlarge CSM mass, the interaction region remained opaque much longer. At early\ntimes, H-alpha widths suggest that the photosphere is ahead of the shock, and\nphotons diffuse out through the opaque CSM. The pivotal transition to optically\nthin emission begins around day 110, when we start to see a decrease in the\nblackbody radius and strengthening tracers of the post-shock shell.

Dwarf galaxy models initially consist of an exponential\nstellar disk embedded in an extended spherical dark matter halo.

The least evolved dwarf is\ntriaxial and retains a significant amount of rotation. The more evolved dwarfs\nare prolate spheroids with little rotation. We show that the final density\ndistribution of stars can be approximated by a simple modification of the\nPlummer law. The kinematics of the dwarfs is significantly different depending\non the line of sight which has important implications for mapping the observed\nstellar velocity dispersions of dwarfs to subhalo circular velocities. When the\ndwarfs are observed along the long axis, the measured velocity dispersion is\nhigher and decreases faster with radius. In the case where rotation is\nsignificant, when viewed perpendicular to the long axis, the effect of minor\naxis rotation is detected, as expected for triaxial systems. We model the\nvelocity dispersion profiles and rotation curves of the dwarfs by solving the\nJeans equations for spherical and axisymmetric systems and adjusting different\nsets of free parameters. We find that the mass is typically overestimated when\nthe dwarf is seen along the long axis and underestimated when the observation\nis along the short or intermediate axis.

We simulate GC\npopulations including both a mass-metallicity scaling relation and nonlinear\ncolor-metallicity relations motivated by theory and observations. Depending on\nthe assumed range of metallicities and the width of the GC luminosity function\n(GCLF), we find that the simulated populations can have bimodal color\ndistributions with a \"blue tilt\" similar to observations, even though the\nmetallicity distribution appears unimodal. The models that produce these\nfeatures have the relatively high mean GC metallicities and nearly equal blue\nand red peaks characteristic of giant elliptical galaxies.

The spectral evolution model\nof the Crab Nebula shows that the flux ratio of TeV gamma-rays to X-rays\nincreases with time, which implies that old PWNe are faint at X-rays, but not\nat TeV gamma-rays.

Recently, we proposed a local neighborhood search algorithm,\nnamely `reactive tabu search' (RTS) algorithm, as well as a factor-graph based\n`belief propagation' (BP) algorithm for low-complexity large-MIMO detection.\nThe motivation for the present work arises from the following two observations\non the above two algorithms: $i)$ RTS works for general M-QAM. Although RTS was\nshown to achieve close to optimal performance for 4-QAM in large dimensions,\nsignificant performance improvement was still possible for higher-order QAM\n(e.g., 16- and 64-QAM). ii) BP also was shown to achieve near-optimal\nperformance for large dimensions, but only for $\\{\\pm 1\\}$ alphabet. In this\npaper, we improve the large-MIMO detection performance of higher-order QAM\nsignals by using a hybrid algorithm that employs RTS and BP. In particular,\nmotivated by the observation that when a detection error occurs at the RTS\noutput, the least significant bits (LSB) of the symbols are mostly in error, we\npropose to first reconstruct and cancel the interference due to bits other than\nLSBs at the RTS output and feed the interference cancelled received signal to\nthe BP algorithm to improve the reliability of the LSBs. The output of the BP\nis then fed back to RTS for the next iteration. Our simulation results show\nthat in a 32 x 32 V-BLAST system, the proposed RTS-BP algorithm performs better\nthan RTS by about 3.5 dB at $10^{-3}$ uncoded BER and by about 2.5 dB at\n$3\\times 10^{-4}$ rate-3/4 turbo coded BER with 64-QAM at the same order of\ncomplexity as RTS.

The spectra of dimensions of short\nand long bursts indicate that the two populations have two different angular\ndistributions.

They represent a class of new physics, which\nhas the potential to change the parameters of the $Z$ boson and at the same\ntime interferes with their determination from the data. We show that in the\npresence of such operators the $Z$ parameters obtained from lineshape fits can\nchange significantly. Another important property of these operators is that\nthey spoil the factorization of the expression for the left-right asymmetry,\n$A_{LR}$, into initial and final state couplings. Factorization and subsequent\ncancellation of the final state coupling occurs in the Standard Model (after\ncorrecting for photonic amplitudes) and is crucial for the interpretation of\n$A_{LR}$ as a measurement of the effective weak mixing angle. Four-Fermi\noperators may thus provide an explanation for the high value of the\npolarization asymmetry as observed at SLC. However, the data from lower energy\n$e^+$ $e^-$ annihilation severely constrains this class of operators and\nvirtually closes this possible loophole on how new physics might explain the\nSLC/LEP discrepancy. We point out that if the surplus of observed $b$-pairs at\nLEP is real and caused by these operators, there may be a significant effect on\nthe forward-backward asymmetry into $b$-quarks.
