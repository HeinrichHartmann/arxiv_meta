My strong interest in the above theorem is motivated by the fact\nthat it contradicts some of my isospectrality examples constructed on geodesic\nspheres and balls of certain harmonic manifolds. The authors overlooked that\nthe Lichnerowicz identity is not determined by the given spectral data, and so\nis the final crucial equation obtained by eliminating with the Lichnerowicz\nidentity. In short, the above theorem has falsely been established by\nspectrally undetermined identities which can not be computed (determined) by\nthe spectra of local geodesic spheres.

To test this claim, we have, for the first time, combined\nhigh-resolution 3-D hydrodynamic simulations of isolated and merging massive,\ngas-rich galaxies, radiative transfer, and a semi-empirical merger rate model\nto predict the number density of SMGs. Our model can reproduce the observed SMG\nnumber density even when using a standard (Kroupa) IMF. The agreement is due to\na combination of relatively long sub-mm duty cycles for mergers (a few times\n10^8 years for our most massive models), which owe to our combination of\nhigh-resolution 3-D hydrodynamic simulations and dust radiative transfer;\nsufficient number densities of massive, gas-rich mergers; and the decrease in\nsub-mm counts observed by recent deep/wide surveys (e.g., Austermann et al.\n2010) relative to previous surveys.
