For this purpose one preferably uses observed stars that\nhave never experienced strong binary interaction, i.e. \"true single stars\".\nHowever, the binary fraction among massive stars is high and identifying \"true\nsingle stars\" is not straight forward. Binary interaction affects systems in\nsuch a way that the initially less massive star becomes, or appears to be,\nsingle. For example, mass transfer results in a widening of the orbit and a\ndecrease of the luminosity of the donor star, which makes it very hard to\ndetect.

Besides, an\nambiguity in high-energy behavior of pion and especially kaon production cross\nsections for nucleon-nucleus collisions may affect essentially the calculated\nneutrino flux.

A new calculation presented here reveals sizable differences, up\nto the factor of 1.8 above 1 TeV, in muon neutrino flux predictions obtained\nwith usage of known hadronic models, SIBYLL 2.1 and QGSJET-II. The atmospheric\nneutrino flux in the energy range $10-10^7$ GeV was computed within the 1D\napproach to solve nuclear cascade equations in the atmosphere, which takes into\naccount non-scaling behavior of the inclusive cross-sections for the particle\nproduction, the rise of total inelastic hadron-nucleus cross-sections and\nnonpower-law character of the primary cosmic ray spectrum.

The decays can be classified according to the\ntype of the anomaly (triangle or box) that governs the corresponding amplitude\nwhen it is extrapolated to the chiral point. In order to take the momentum\ndependencies of the form factors into account, the actual calculations are\nperformed in the frame work of vector meson dominance (VMD) models, namely in\nterms of the original hidden gauge model and modern generalized models.

The volume is measured by the\nd-dimensional Hausdorff measure, which coincides with the Lebesgue measure for\nLebesgue measurable sets. We bound the volume of the symmetric difference of A\nand f(A) in terms of the (d-1)-dimensional volume of the boundary of A and the\nmaximal distance of a boundary point to its image under f. The boundary is\nmeasured by the (d-1)-dimensional Hausdorff measure, which matches the surface\narea for sufficiently nice sets. In the case of translations, our bound is\nsharp. In the case of rotations, we get a sharp bound under the assumption that\nthe boundary is sufficiently nice. The motivation to study these bounds comes\nfrom shape matching. For two shapes A and B in IR^d and a class of\ntransformations, the matching problem asks for a transformation f such that\nf(A) and B match optimally. The quality of the match is measured by some\nsimilarity measure, for instance the volume of overlap. Let A and B be bounded\nsubsets of IR^d, and let F be the function that maps a rigid motion r to the\nvolume of overlap of r(A) and B. Maximizing this function is a shape matching\nproblem, and knowing that F is Lipschitz continuous helps to solve it.
