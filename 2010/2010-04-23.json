We establish that the\nenvironment sensitivity is far less pronounced in the case of the decuplet\nbaryons compared to that in the octet baryons. A surprising result is that the\ncharge radii of the decuplet baryons are generally smaller than that of the\noctet baryons. The magnetic moment of the Delta^+ reveals a turn over in the\nlow quark mass region, making it smaller than the proton magnetic moment. These\nresults are consistent with the expectations of quenched chiral perturbation\ntheory. A similar turn over is also noticed in the magnetic moment of the\nSigma^*0, but not for Xi^* where only kaon loops can appear in quenched QCD.\nThe electric quadrupole moment of the Omega^- baryon is positive when the\nnegative charge factor is included, and is equal to 0.86 +- 0.12 x 10^-2 fm^2,\nindicating an oblate shape.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 32 figures"]}]

We identify quite different dielectric response in\neither case; while InN shows a significant shift in the absorption edge due to\nn-type doping, this is masked for GaN due to efficient cancellation of the\nBurstein-Moss effect by the band gap renormalization. For high doping levels\nthe intraband absorption becomes significant in InN. Furthermore, we observe\nthat the free-carrier plasma contribution to refractive index change becomes\nmore important than both band filling and the band gap renormalization for\nelectron densities above 10$^{19}$~cm$^{-3}$ in GaN, and 10$^{20}$~cm$^{-3}$ in\nInN. As a result of the two different characteristics mentioned above, the\noverall change in the refractive index due to n-type doping is much higher in\nInN compared to GaN, which in the former exceeds 4\\% for a doping of\n10$^{19}$~cm$^{-3}$ at 1.55~$\\mu$m wavelength. Finally, we consider intrinsic\nInN under strong photoexcitation which introduces equal density of electron and\nholes thermalized to their respective band edges. The change in the refractive\nindex at 1.55~$\\mu$m is observed to be similar to the n-doped case up to a\ncarrier density of 10$^{20}$~cm$^{-3}$. However, in the photoexcited case this\nis now accompanied by a strong absorption in this wavelength region due to\n$\\Gamma^v_5 \\to \\Gamma^v_6$ intravalence band transition.

In this paper, the exact effective\nHamiltonian for evolution of the spins' state in a rotating frame is derived,\nboth under irradiation of a single peak (on-transition) as well as between the\npeaks of the doublet (on-resonance). The accuracy of these effective\nHamiltonians is validated by comparing the observable product operator\ncomponents of the density matrix obtained by simulation to those obtained by\nfitting the corresponding experiments. It is further shown how both the\non-transition and on-resonance fields can be used to implement the\ncontrolled-NOT gate exactly up to conditional phases, and analytic expressions\nfor these phases are derived. In Appendices, the on-resonance Hamiltonian is\nanalytically diagonalized, and proofs are given that, in the weak-coupling\napproximation, off-resonance effects can be neglected whenever the\nradio-frequency field power is small compared to the difference in resonance\nfrequencies of the two spins.\n","Comment: LaTeX2e (iopart.cls), 18 pages, 5 figures, submitted J.
