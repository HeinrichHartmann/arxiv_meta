In both the normal and superconducting (SC)\nstates, the spectrum lacks the 42/m screw symmetry around the (1/2 1/2 L) axis\nthat is implied by the I4/mmm space group. This is manifest both in the\nin-plane anisotropy of the normal- and SC-state spin dynamics and in the\nout-of-plane dispersion of the spin-resonance mode.

This raises the important question of how\nsensitive such models might be to real-world effects that violate the\nassumptions. We show how the consequences of rational behavior caused by\nperverse incentives, as well as various irrational tendencies identified by\nbehavioral economists, can be systematically and consistently introduced into\nan agent-based model for a financial asset. This generates a class of models\nwhich, in the special case where such effects are absent, reduces to geometric\nBrownian motion --- the usual equilibrium pricing model. Thus we are able to\nnumerically perturb a widely-used equilibrium pricing model market and\ninvestigate its stability. The magnitude of such perturbations in real markets\ncan be estimated and the simulations imply that this is far outside the\nstability region of the equilibrium solution, which is no longer observed.\nIndeed the price fluctuations generated by endogenous dynamics, are in good\ngeneral agreement with the excess kurtosis and heteroskedasticity of actual\nasset prices. The methodology is presented within the context of a financial\nmarket. However, there are close links to concepts and theories from both\nmicro- and macro-economics including rational expectations, Soros' theory of\nreflexivity, and Minsky's theory of financial instability.\n"]}]

As\na consequence one obtains a generalization of the following theorem of Youngs:\nIf a quadrangulation of the projective plane is not bipartite it has chromatic\nnumber four. The generalization states that in this case the local chromatic\nnumber is also four. Both papers [1] and [13] generalize Youngs's result to\narbitrary non-orientable surfaces replacing the condition of the graph being\nnot bipartite by a more technical condition of an odd quadrangulation. This\npaper investigates when these general results are true for the local chromatic\nnumber instead of the chromatic number. Surprisingly, we find out that (unlike\nin the case of the chromatic number) this depends on the genus of the surface.\nFor the non-orientable surfaces of genus at most four, the local chromatic\nnumber of any odd quadrangulation is at least four, but this is not true for\nnon-orientable surfaces of genus 5 or higher.
