Using\ntwo-dimensional device simulation, the performance of the proposed device has\nbeen evaluated in detail by comparing its characteristics with those of the\ncompatible Lateral Conventional Schottky (LCS) and Lateral Trench Sidewall\nSchottky (LTSS) rectifiers on 4H-SiC. From our simulation results, it is\nobserved that the proposed LDSS rectifier acts as a low-barrier LTSS rectifier\nunder forward bias conditions and as a high-barrier LTSS rectifier under\nreverse bias conditions making it an ideal rectifier. The LDSS rectifier\nexhibits an on/off current ratio (at 1 V / -500 V) of 5.5x10e7 for an epitaxial\nlayer doping of 1x10e17 /cm^3. Further, the proposed LDSS structure exhibits a\nvery sharp breakdown similar to that of a PiN diode in spite of using only\nSchottky junctions in the structure.

The resulting rates region is denoted crystallized rates region.\nBy treating the interference as noise, the n-user rates region frontiers has\nbeen found in the literature to be the convex hull of n hyper-surfaces. The\nrates region bounded by these hyper-surfaces is not necessarily convex, and\nthereby a convex hull operation is imposed through the strategy of\ntime-sharing. This paper simplifies this rates region in the n-dimensional\nspace by having only an On/Off binary power control. This consequently leads to\n2^n-1 corner points situated within the rates region. A time-sharing convex\nhull is imposed onto those corner points, forming the crystallized rates\nregion. The paper focuses on game theoretic concepts to achieve that\ncrystallized convex hull via correlated equilibrium. In game theory, the\ncorrelated equilibrium set is convex, and it consists of the time-sharing mixed\nstrategies of the Nash equilibriums. In addition, the paper considers a\nmechanism design approach to carefully design a utility function, particularly\nthe Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction utility, where the solution point is situated\non the correlated equilibrium set. Finally, the paper proposes a self learning\nalgorithm, namely the regret-matching algorithm, that converges to the solution\npoint on the correlated equilibrium set in a distributed fashion.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 9 figures, Proc.

Its\nrealization is geared by the fundamental goal of effective management of demand\nload. In this work, we envision a scenario with real-time communication between\nthe operator and consumers. The grid operator controller receives requests for\npower demands from consumers, with different power requirement, duration, and a\ndeadline by which it is to be completed. The objective is to devise a power\ndemand task scheduling policy that minimizes the grid operational cost over a\ntime horizon. The operational cost is a convex function of instantaneous power\nconsumption and reflects the fact that each additional unit of power needed to\nserve demands is more expensive as demand load increases.First, we study the\noff-line demand scheduling problem, where parameters are fixed and known. Next,\nwe devise a stochastic model for the case when demands are generated\ncontinually and scheduling decisions are taken online and focus on long-term\naverage cost. We present two instances of power consumption control based on\nobserving current consumption. First, the controller may choose to serve a new\ndemand request upon arrival or to postpone it to the end of its deadline.\nSecond, the additional option exists to activate one of the postponed demands\nwhen an active demand terminates. For both instances, the optimal policies are\nthreshold based. We derive a lower performance bound over all policies, which\nis asymptotically tight as deadlines increase. We propose the Controlled\nRelease threshold policy and prove it is asymptotically optimal. The policy\nactivates a new demand request if the current power consumption is less than a\nthreshold, otherwise it is queued. Queued demands are scheduled when their\ndeadline expires or when the consumption drops below the threshold.\n","Comment: submitted to INFOCOM 2011; 9 pages, 4 figures"]}]
