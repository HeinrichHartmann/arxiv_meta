We argue\nthat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that\ninitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation\ndriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the\nobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central\nconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in\nwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by\n-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known\ninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal\n``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant\nvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven\ncluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.\nOur conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend\ninstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal\nradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative\nprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties\n(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as\nrho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF\nimplies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values\n(although falling towards the low end of this range).

Such intermediate mass\nratio inspirals (IMRIs) are most likely to be found in globular clusters. We\nanalyze four possible IMRI formation mechanisms: (1) hardening of an NS-IMBH or\nBH-IMBH binary via three-body interactions, (2) hardening via Kozai resonance\nin a hierarchical triple system, (3) direct capture, and (4) inspiral of a\ncompact object from a tidally captured main-sequence star; we also discuss\ntidal effects when the inspiraling object is an NS. For each mechanism we\npredict the typical eccentricities of the resulting IMRIs. We find that IMRIs\nwill have largely circularized by the time they enter the sensitivity band of\nground-based detectors. Hardening of a binary via three-body interactions,\nwhich is likely to be the dominant mechanism for IMRI formation, yields\neccentricities under 10^-4 when the GW frequency reaches 10 Hz. Even among\nIMRIs formed via direct captures, which can have the highest eccentricities,\naround 90% will circularize to eccentricities under 0.1 before the GW frequency\nreaches 10 Hz.

The self-regulating\nmechanism is based on the interplay of two effects. First, plasma density\ncontrols coronal energy release via the transition between the slow collisional\nSweet-Parker regime and the fast collisionless reconnection regime. This\ntransition takes place when the Sweet--Parker layer becomes thinner than the\ncharacteristic collisionless reconnection scale. I present a simple criterion\nfor this transition in terms of the upstream plasma density (n_e), the\nreconnecting (B_0) and guide (B_z) magnetic field components, and the global\nlength (L) of the reconnection layer: L < 6.10^9 cm [n_e/(10^{10}/cm^3)]^(-3)\n(B_0/30G)^4 (B_0/B_z)^2. Next, coronal energy release by reconnection raises\nthe ambient plasma density via chromospheric evaporation and this, in turn,\ntemporarily inhibits subsequent reconnection involving the newly-reconnected\nloops. Over time, however, radiative cooling gradually lowers the density again\nbelow the critical value and fast reconnection again becomes possible. As a\nresult, the density is highly inhomogeneous and intermittent but,\nstatistically, does not deviate strongly from the critical value which is\ncomparable with the observed coronal density. Thus, in the long run, the\ncoronal heating process can be represented by repeating cycles that consist of\nfast reconnection events (i.e., nanoflares), followed by rapid evaporation\nepisodes, followed by relatively long periods (1-hour) during which magnetic\nstresses build up and simultaneously the plasma cools down and precipitates.\n","Comment: 17 pages, no figures; accepted to the Astrophysical Journal; replaced\n  to match the accepted version"]}]

As\nthe jet material expands due to internal pressure gradients, it runs into the\nambient medium resulting in a pile-up of material along the jet boundary, while\nthe magnetic field acts to produce a magnetic pinch along the axis of the jet.\nSuch jets can be in a lateral pressure equilibrium only if their opening angle\n\\theta_j at distance z is smaller than about 1/\\gamma, where \\gamma is the\ncharacteristic bulk Lorentz-factor at this distance; otherwise, different parts\nof the jet cannot maintain causal contact. We construct maps of optically thin\nsynchrotron emission from our self-similar models. We suggest that the boundary\npile-up may be the reason for the limb-brightening of the sub-parsec jet of\nM87. We find that if the synchrotron emissivity falls with the distance from\nthe jet axis, the polarization fraction rises toward the edge, as seen in 3C273\nand Mkn501. Projection effects and the emissivity pattern of the jet have a\nstrong effect on the observed polarization signal, so the interpretation of the\npolarization data in terms of the geometry of magnetic fields is rather\nuncertain. For example, jets with toroidal magnetic fields display the\n`spine-sheath' polarization angle pattern seen in some BL Lac objects.\n","Comment: 23 pages, including 1 color figure and 4 b/w figures.

However, any\nresulting {\\em post}-calibration shift in luminosity between the components\nwill cause a redshift-dependent systematic shift in the Hubble diagram.\nUtilizing an existing sample of 192 SNe Ia, we find that the average luminosity\ndifference between prompt and delayed SNe is constrained to be $(4.5 \\pm\n8.9)%$. If the absolute difference between the two populations is 0.025 mag,\nand this is ignored when fitting for cosmological parameters, then the dark\nenergy equation of state (EOS) determined from a sample of 2300 SNe Ia is\nbiased at $\\sim1\\sigma$.

However, assuming no prior on the\nstrength of the two-population effect, the uncertainty in the best-fit EOS is\nincreased by a factor of 2.5, when compared to the equivalent sample with no\nunderlying two-population systematic. To avoid introducing a bias in the EOS\nparameters, or significantly degrading the measurement accuracy, it is\nnecessary to control the post-calibration luminosity difference between prompt\nand delayed SN populations to better than 0.025 mag.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 4 figures; New figures added, some old figures removed; The\n  effect of the uncertainty in the two population model on parameter estimation\n  discussed; Reflects version accepted for publication in Astrophys.

We measure a consistent steepening of the\nSb(r) profile moving outward from 0.4 R200, where an average slope of -3.6\n(sigma=0.8) is estimated. At R200, we evaluate a slope of -4.3 (sigma=0.9) that\nimplies a slope in the gas density profile of -2.6 and a predicted mean value\nof the surface brightness in the 0.5-2 band of 2e-12 erg/s/cm2/deg2.

This provides\nevidence for slow magnetoacoustic waves propagating upwards from the transition\nregion into the corona. We find that the oscillations detected in the five\ncoronal lines are highly correlated, and the amplitude decreases with\nincreasing temperature. The amplitude of Doppler shift oscillations decrease by\na factor of about 3, while that of relative intensity decreases by a factor of\nabout 4 from Fe X to Fe XV. These oscillations may be caused by the leakage of\nthe photospheric p-modes through the chromosphere and transition region into\nthe corona, which has been suggested as the source for intensity oscillations\npreviously observed by TRACE. The temperature dependence of the oscillation\namplitudes can be explained by damping of the waves traveling along the loop\nwith multithread structure near the footpoint. Thus, this property may have\npotential value for coronal seismology in diagnostic of temperature structure\nin a coronal loop.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 11 color figures, 4 tables, Astrophys.J, May 2009 - v696\n  issue, (in press)"]}]

All the compositions show\nferromagnetic/metal to paramagnetic/insulator transition except the Pb doped\nsample which is insulating and ferromagnetic in the entire temperature range.\nThe simultaneous occurrence of ferromagnetism and insulating behavior in Pb\ndoped compound is most likely due to the presence of FM clusters separated by\nFe and Mn ions that are coupled AFM and hence prevent the current from crossing\nthe inter-domain region. The magnetization and Tc are decreased by decreasing\nthe Cation size on La site. We observed that (for a fixed Fe content of 5%) the\ntransition temperature and magnetic moment at 77 K is a maximum for Sr doped\nsample and is decreasing if we increase or decrease the cation size from Sr\nsize. The maximum value of Tc and magnetic moment for Sr based sample is most\nlikely due to the closer ionic sizes of La and Sr as compared to the other\ndopants (Ca, Pb, Ba). The decrease in the transition temperature and magnetic\nmoment is due to the deviation of Mn-O-Mn angle from 1800 caused by the size\nmismatch of the A site cations. This deviation leads to weakening of the FM\ndouble exchange (DE). We observed a spin freezing type effect in the Pb doped\nsample below 120 K in resistivity, AC susceptibility and in magnetization. This\nsuggests that the AFM interactions introduced by the Fe are most effective in\nthe Pb doped composition leading to increased competition between the FM and\nAFM interactions.

However, even\nsophisticated MCMC methods dedicated to SSSM can prove quite inefficient as\nthey update potentially strongly correlated discrete-valued latent variables\none-at-a-time (Carter and Kohn, 1996; Gerlach et al., 2000; Giordani and Kohn,\n2008). Particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) methods are a recently\ndeveloped class of MCMC algorithms which use particle filters to build\nefficient proposal distributions in high-dimensions (Andrieu et al., 2010).

For lenses in groups, the group centroid\nposition is consistent with the direction of the external tidal shear required\nby lens models.

Previous studies considered only pure luminosity evolution\n(PLE) or pure density evolution, but we introduce the luminosity dependent\ndensity evolution (LDDE) model, which is favored from the evolution of X-ray\nluminosity function (XLF) of AGNs. The model parameters are constrained by\nlikelihood analyses about the observed redshift and gamma-ray flux\ndistributions of the EGRET blazars. We find that the LDDE model gives a better\nfit to the observed distributions than the PLE model, indicating that the LDDE\nmodel is also appropriate for gamma-ray blazars, and that the jet activity is\nuniversally correlated with the accretion history of AGNs. The normalization\nbetween the GLF and XLF is consistent with the unified picture of AGNs, when\nthe beaming and a reasonable duty cycle of jet activity are taken into account.\nWe then find that only 25--50% of the EGRB can be explained by unresolved\nblazars with the best-fit LDDE parameters. Unresolved blazars can account for\nall the EGRB only with a steeper index of the faint-end slope of the GLF, which\nis marginally consistent with the EGRET data but inconsistent with that of the\nXLF. Therefore unresolved AGNs cannot be the dominant source of the EGRB,\nunless there is a new population of gamma-ray emitting AGNs that evolves\ndifferently from the XLF of AGNs.

We trace the circumnuclear dust morphology and amount of dust\nstructure with structure maps generated from visible-wavelength HST data,\nfinding that tightly wound nuclear dust spirals are primarily found in weakly\nbarred galaxies. While strongly barred galaxies sometimes exhibit grand design\nstructure within the central 10 percent of D25, this structure rarely extends\nto within ~10 pc of the galaxy nucleus. In some galaxies, these spiral arms\nterminate at a circumnuclear starburst ring. Galaxies with circumnuclear rings\nare generally more strongly barred than galaxies lacking rings. Within these\nrings, the dust structure is fairly smooth and usually in the form of a loosely\nwound spiral. These data demonstrate that multiple nuclear morphologies are\npossible in the most strongly barred galaxies: chaotic central dust structure\ninconsistent with a coherent nuclear spiral, a grand design spiral that loses\ncoherence before reaching the nucleus, or a grand design spiral that ends in a\ncircumnuclear ring.

The arc has a spectrum\nand a redshift remarkably similar to those of the previous record-holder for\nbrightest LBG (MS 1512-cB58, a.k.a \"cB58\"), but, with an estimated total\nmagnitude of (g,r,i) = (20.0,19.2,19.0) and surface brightness of\n(mu_g,mu_r,mu_i) = (23.3, 22.5, 22.3) mag/arcsec^2, the 8 o'clock arc is thrice\nas bright. The 8 o'clock arc, which consists of three lensed images of the LBG,\nis 162deg (9.6arcsec) long and has a length-to-width ratio of 6:1. A fourth\nimage of the LBG -- a counter-image -- can also be identified in the ARC 3.5m\ng-band images.

This recipe yields a much faster increase with galactic age of\nattenuation in more massive galaxies, endowed with higher star formation rates.\nThese objects have therefore shorter lifetimes in the LAE and LBG phases, and\nare more easily detected in the dusty submillimeter bright phase. The short UV\nbright lifetimes of massive objects strongly mitigate the effect of the fast\nincrease of the massive halo density with decreasing redshift, thus accounting\nfor the weaker evolution of the LBG LF, compared to that of the halo mass\nfunction, and the even weaker evolution between z~6 and z~3 of the LAE LF.

Since the progenitors\nof long gamma-ray bursts have been identified as massive stars, this event\noffers a unique opportunity to investigate star formation environments at this\nepoch. Apart from its record redshift, the burst is remarkable in two respects:\nfirst, it exhibits fast-evolving X-ray and optical flares that peak\nsimultaneously at t~470 s in the observer frame, and may thus originate in the\nsame emission region; and second, its afterglow exhibits an accelerated decay\nin the near-infrared (NIR) from t~10^4 s to t~3 10^4 s after the burst,\ncoincident with repeated and energetic X-ray flaring activity. We make a\ncomplete analysis of available X-ray, NIR, and radio observations, utilizing\nafterglow models that incorporate a range of physical effects not previously\nconsidered for this or any other GRB afterglow, and quantifying our model\nuncertainties in detail via Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. In the process,\nwe explore the possibility that the early optical and X-ray flare is due to\nsynchrotron and inverse Compton emission from the reverse shock regions of the\noutflow. We suggest that the period of accelerated decay in the NIR may be due\nto suppression of synchrotron radiation by inverse Compton interaction of X-ray\nflare photons with electrons in the forward shock; a subsequent interval of\nslow decay would then be due to a progressive decline in this suppression.

Here we revisit the kinematics and dynamics of null hypersurfaces by\nmaking use of some 3+1 slicing of spacetime.

We also reformulate previous works, such as\nDamour's black hole mechanics, and make the link with a previous 3+1 approach\nof black hole horizon, namely the membrane paradigm. We explicit all\ngeometrical objects in terms of 3+1 quantities, putting a special emphasis on\nthe conformal 3+1 formulation.

The introduction of the equivalence being\nconsistent with the mathematical definition is possible only in theories\nconstructed on non-standard number spaces by taking the experimental errors as\ninfinitesimal numbers of the non-standard spaces. Following the idea for the\nequivalence (the physical equivalence), a new description of space-time in\nterms of infinitesimal-lattice points on non-standard real number space $\\SR$\nis proposed. The infinitesimal-lattice space, $^*{\\cal L}$, is represented by\nthe set of points on $\\SR$ which are written by $l_n=n\\SE$, where the\ninfinitesimal lattice-spacing $\\SE$ is determined by a non-standard natural\nnumber $^*N$ such that $\\SE\\equiv ^*N^{-1}$.
