The Eguchi-Kawai reduction relates gauge theories in\ndifferent numbers of dimensions in the large $N$ limit provided that certain\nconditions are met. In principle, this relation opens up the possibility of\nlearning about the dynamics of 4D gauge theories through techniques only\navailable in lower dimensions. Dimensional reduction can be understood as a\nspecial case of large $N$ equivalence between theories related by an orbifold\nprojection. In this work, we focus on the simplest case of dimensional\nreduction, relating a 4D gauge theory to a 3D gauge theory via an orbifold\nprojection. A necessary condition for the large N equivalence between the 4D\nand 3D theories to hold is that certain discrete symmetries in the two theories\nmust not be broken spontaneously. In pure 4D Yang-Mills theory, these\nsymmetries break spontaneously as the size of one of the spacetime dimensions\nshrinks. An analysis of the effect of adjoint fermions on the relevant\nsymmetries of the 4D theory shows that the fermions help stabilize the\nsymmetries. We consider the same problem from the point of view of the lower\ndimensional 3D theory and find that, surprisingly, adjoint fermions are not\ngenerally enough to stabilize the necessary symmetries of the 3D theory. In\nfact, a rich phase diagram arises, with a complicated pattern of symmetry\nbreaking. We discuss the possible causes and consequences of this finding.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 3 figures.

By systematically changing the\nratio of excitation/inhibition (E/I) in vitro and in a network model, we\ndiscovered that both information capacity and information transmission are\nmaximized at a particular intermediate E/I, at which ongoing activity emerges\nas neuronal avalanches. Next, we used our in vitro and model results to\ncorrectly predict in vivo information capacity and interactions between\nneuronal groups during ongoing activity. Close agreement between our\nexperiments and model suggest that neuronal avalanches and peak information\ncapacity arise due to criticality and are general properties of cortical\nnetworks with balanced E/I.\n"]}]
