We compute the shear viscosity in the semi-QGP by\nusing the Boltzmann equation in the presence of this background field.

For simplicity we also\nassume that both the number of colors and flavors are large. Near the critical\ntemperature T_c, where the expectation value of the Polyakov loop is small, the\noverall density of colored fields decreases according to their color\nrepresentation, with the density of quarks vanishes linearly with the loop, and\nthat of gluons, quadratically. This decrease in the overall density dominates\nchanges in the transport cross section. As a result, relative to that in the\nperturbative QGP, near T_c the shear viscosity in the semi-QGP is suppressed by\ntwo powers of the Polyakov loop.

From the experimental results, the approach of using\nthe proposed hierarchical SVM model by integrating current page with\nneighboring pages via the topic model yielded the best performance with the\naccuracy equal to 90.33% and the F1 measure of 90.14%; an improvement of 5.12%\nand 5.13% over the original SVM model, respectively.\n","Comment: Pages IEEE format, International Journal of Computer Science and\n  Information Security, IJCSIS, Vol. 7 No. 2, February 2010, USA.

Image denoising is a common procedure in digital\nimage processing aiming at the removal of noise, which may corrupt an image\nduring its acquisition or transmission, while retaining its quality. This\nprocedure is traditionally performed in the spatial or frequency domain by\nfiltering. The aim of image enhancement is to reconstruct the true image from\nthe corrupted image. The process of image acquisition frequently leads to\ndegradation and the quality of the digitized image becomes inferior to the\noriginal image. Filtering is a technique for enhancing the image. Linear filter\nis the filtering in which the value of an output pixel is a linear combination\nof neighborhood values, which can produce blur in the image. Thus a variety of\nsmoothing techniques have been developed that are non linear. Median filter is\nthe one of the most popular non-linear filter. When considering a small\nneighborhood it is highly efficient but for large window and in case of high\nnoise it gives rise to more blurring to image. The Centre Weighted Median (CWM)\nfilter has got a better average performance over the median filter [8]. However\nthe original pixel corrupted and noise reduction is substantial under high\nnoise condition. Hence this technique has also blurring affect on the image. To\nillustrate the superiority of the proposed approach by overcoming the existing\nproblem, the proposed new scheme (AMF) Adaptive Median Filter has been\nsimulated along with the standard ones and various performance measures have\nbeen compared.\n","Comment: Pages IEEE format, International Journal of Computer Science and\n  Information Security, IJCSIS, Vol. 7 No. 2, February 2010, USA.

The feedback between massive stars and the interstellar medium is\none of the most important processes in the evolution of dwarf galaxies.

However, their\norigin and fate are still poorly understood. We here present new HI and optical\ndata of two nearby irregular dwarf galaxies: IC 4662 and NGC 5408. The HI line\ndata were obtained with the ATCA and are part of the Local Volume HI Survey.\nThey are complemented by optical images and spectroscopic data obtained with\nthe ESO NTT and the ESO 3.6m telescope. Our main aim is to study the kinematics\nof the neutral and ionised gas components in order to search for outflowing gas\nstructures and to make predictions about their fate. We find the HI gas\nenvelopes of both galaxies to extend well beyond the optical discs. The optical\ndisc is embedded into the central HI maximum in both galaxies. However, higher\nresolution HI maps show that the HI intensity peaks are typically offset from\nthe prominent HII regions. While NGC 5408 shows a fairly regular HI velocity\nfield, which allows us to derive a rotation curve, IC 4662 reveals a rather\ntwisted HI velocity field, possibly caused by a recent merger event. We detect\noutflows with velocities between 20 and 60 km/s in our Halpha spectra of both\ngalaxies, sometimes with HI counterparts of similar velocity. We suggest the\nexistence of expanding superbubbles, especially in NGC 5408. This is also\nsupported by the detection of FWHMs as high as 70 km/s in Halpha. In case of\nNGC 5408, we compare our results with the escape velocity of the galaxy, which\nshows that the measured expansion velocities are in all cases too low to allow\nthe gas to escape from the gravitational potential of NGC 5408.

This paper examines the above development on the noise-disturbance\nuncertainty principle in the model-independent approach based on the\nmeasurement operator formalism, which is widely accepted to describe a class of\ngeneralized measurements in the field of quantum information. We obtain\nexplicit formulas for the noise and disturbance of measurements given by the\nmeasurement operators, and show that projective measurements do not satisfy the\nHeisenberg-type noise-disturbance relation that is typical in the gamma-ray\nmicroscope thought experiments. We also show that the disturbance on a Pauli\noperator of a projective measurement of another Pauli operator constantly\nequals the square root of 2, and examine how this measurement violates the\nHeisenberg-type relation but satisfies the new noise-disturbance relation.\n","Comment: 11 pages.
