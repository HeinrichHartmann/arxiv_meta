Current estimates are that the true mean redshift of the objects\nin each photo-z bin must be known to better than 0.002(1+z) if errors in\ncosmological measurements are not to be degraded. A conventional approach is to\ncalibrate these photometric redshifts with large sets of spectroscopic\nredshifts. However, at the depths probed by Stage III surveys (such as DES),\nlet alone Stage IV (LSST, JDEM, Euclid), existing large redshift samples have\nall been highly (25-60%) incomplete. A powerful alternative approach is to\nexploit the clustering of galaxies to perform photometric redshift\ncalibrations. Measuring the two-point angular cross-correlation between objects\nin some photometric redshift bin and objects with known spectroscopic redshift\nallows the true redshift distribution of a photometric sample to be\nreconstructed in detail, even if it includes objects too faint for spectroscopy\nor if spectroscopic samples are highly incomplete.

We find that star formation rate and efficiency are twice as\nhigh in the spiral arms as in the bar. We discuss this difference in the\ncontext of the Kennicutt-Schimidt (KS) law, which indicates a constant star\nformation rate at a given gas surface density.
