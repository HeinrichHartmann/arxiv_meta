In the case of good decoherence, that is, after the\npointer states have been unambiguously selected, the mutual information between\nthe system, S, and an environment fragment, F, is given solely by F's entropy\nincrease. This demonstrates that the environment's capacity for recording the\nstate of S is directly related to its ability to increase its entropy.\nEnvironments that remain nearly invariant under the interaction with S, either\nbecause they have a large initial entropy or a misaligned initial state,\ntherefore have a diminished ability to acquire information. To elucidate the\nconcept of good decoherence, we show that - when decoherence is not complete -\nthe deviation of the mutual information from F's entropy change is quantified\nby the quantum discord, i.e., the excess mutual information between S and F is\ninformation regarding the initial coherence between pointer states of S.

In particular we allow the dimension of time\nseries $p$ to be as large as, or even larger than, the sample size $n$. The\nestimation for the factor loading matrix and the factor process itself is\ncarried out via an eigenanalysis for a $p\\times p$ non-negative definite\nmatrix.

This\nresult exhibits clearly that the `curse' is canceled out by the `blessings' in\ndimensionality. We also establish the asymptotic properties of the estimation\nwhen not all factors are strong.

Effects of some small exotic R^4's,\nwhen localized on S^3, correspond to stringy geometries of B-fields on S^3.\nExotic smoothness of R^4 acts as a non-vanishing B-field on S^3.

Also, tuning formulae for\nan integrating process with dead time, which is a special case of a first order\nplus dead time process, is given. The design problem considers three essential\nrequirements of control problems, namely load disturbance rejection, setpoint\nregulation and robustness of closed-loop system against model uncertainties.\nThe primary design goal is to optimize load disturbance rejection. Robustness\nis guaranteed by requiring that the maximum sensitivity is less than or equal\nto a specified value. In the first step, PI controller parameters are\ndetermined such that the IAE criterion to a load disturbance step is minimized\nand the robustness constraint on maximum sensitivity is satisfied. Using a\nstructure with two degrees of freedom which introduces an extra parameter, the\nsetpoint weight, good setpoint regulation is achieved in the second step. The\nmain advantage of the proposed method is its simplicity. Once the equivalent\nfirst order plus dead time model is determined, the PI parameters are\nexplicitly given by a set of tuning formulae. In order to show the performance\nand effectiveness of the proposed tuning formulae, they are applied to three\nsimulation examples.\n","Comment: Submitted to Journal of Computer Science and Engineering, see\n  http://sites.google.com/site/jcseuk/volume-1-issue-1-may-2010"]}]

We exploit our methodology to achieve two types of results.\nFirst, we construct Monte Carlo estimators that are strongly efficient (i.e.\nhave bounded relative mean squared error as the event of interest becomes\nrare). These estimators are used to estimate both rare-event probabilities of\ninterest and associated conditional expectations. We emphasize that our\ntechniques allow us to control the expected termination time of the Monte Carlo\nalgorithm even if the conditional expected stopping time (under the original\ndistribution) given the event of interest is infinity -- a situation that\nsometimes occurs in heavy-tailed settings. Second, the mixture family serves as\na good approximation (in total variation) of the conditional distribution of\nthe whole process given the rare event of interest. The convenient form of the\nmixture family allows us to obtain, as a corollary, functional conditional\ncentral limit theorems that extend classical results in the literature. We\nillustrate our methodology in the context of the ruin probability $P(\\sup_n S_n\n>b)$, where $S_n$ is a random walk with heavy-tailed increments that have\nnegative drift.
