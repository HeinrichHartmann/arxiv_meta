The neutrinos emitted from the remnant at the\ncenter, the protoneutron star (PNS), heat the material above the PNS surface.\nThis heat is partly converted into kinetic energy and the material accelerates\nto an outflow that is known as the neutrino driven wind. For the first time, we\nsimulate the collapse, bounce, explosion and the neutrino driven wind phases\nconsistently over more than 20 seconds. Our numerical model is based on\nspherically symmetric general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics using\nspectral three flavor Boltzmann neutrino transport. In simulations where no\nexplosions are obtained naturally, we model neutrino driven explosions for low\nand intermediate mass Fe-core progenitor stars by enhancing the charged current\nreaction rates. In the case of a special progenitor star, the O-Ne-Mg-core, the\nexplosion in spherical symmetry was obtained without enhanced opacities. The\npost explosion evolution is in qualitative agreement with static steady-state\nand parametrized dynamic models of the neutrino driven wind. On the other hand,\nwe find generally smaller neutrino luminosities and mean neutrino energies as\nwell as a different evolutionary behavior of the neutrino luminosities and mean\nneutrino energies. The neutrino driven wind is proton-rich for more than 10\nseconds and the contraction of the PNS differs from the assumptions made for\nthe conditions at the inner boundary in previous neutrino driven wind studies.\nDespite the moderately large entropies per baryon of about 100 and the fast\nexpansion timescale, the conditions found in our model are unlikely to favor...\n","Comment: 26 pages, 19 figures"]}]

But not a single\nexample of a maximal set is known if the dimension is another composite number\n($N=6,10,12,...$). In this review, we present a unified approach in which the\nbasis states are labeled by numbers ${0,1,2,...,N-1}$ that are both elements of\na Galois field and ordinary integers. This dual nature permits a compact\nsystematic construction of maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases when they\nare known to exist but throws no light on the open existence problem in other\ncases. We show how to use the thus constructed mutually unbiased bases in\nquantum-informatics applications, including dense coding, teleportation,\nentanglement swapping, covariant cloning, and state tomography, all of which\nrely on an explicit set of maximally entangled states (generalizations of the\nfamiliar two--q-bit Bell states) that are related to the mutually unbiased\nbases. There is a link to the mathematics of finite affine planes. We also\nexploit the one-to-one correspondence between unbiased bases and the complex\nHadamard matrices that turn the bases into each other.

Conversely, the heat kernel constructed from its\neigenvalues and eigenfunctions determines the Riemannian metric. This work\nproves the analogy on Euclidean polyhedral surfaces (triangle meshes), that the\ndiscrete Laplace-Beltrami operator and the discrete Riemannian metric (unique\nup to a scaling) are mutually determined by each other. Given an Euclidean\npolyhedral surface, its Riemannian metric is represented as edge lengths,\nsatisfying triangle inequalities on all faces. The Laplace-Beltrami operator is\nformulated using the cotangent formula, where the edge weight is defined as the\nsum of the cotangent of angles against the edge. We prove that the edge lengths\ncan be determined by the edge weights unique up to a scaling using the\nvariational approach. First, we show that the space of all possible metrics of\na polyhedral surface is convex. Then, we construct a special energy defined on\nthe metric space, such that the gradient of the energy equals to the edge\nweights. Third, we show the Hessian matrix of the energy is positive definite,\nrestricted on the tangent space of the metric space, therefore the energy is\nconvex. Finally, by the fact that the parameter on a convex domain and the\ngradient of a convex function defined on the domain have one-to-one\ncorrespondence, we show the edge weights determines the polyhedral metric\nunique up to a scaling.

The\nvector equilibrium problem is defined for three measures, with external fields\non the first and third measures and an upper constraint on the second measure.\nThe proof is based on a steepest descent analysis of a 4 x 4 matrix valued\nRiemann-Hilbert problem that characterizes the correlation kernel for the\neigenvalues of M_1. Our results generalize earlier results for the case\nalpha=0, where the external field on the third measure was not present.\n","Comment: 123 pages, 15 figures"]}]

The\nelectrons are coupled by exchange interaction with randomly distributed\nmagnetic ions polarized by magnetic field. This coupling leads to both spin\nrelaxation and spin decoherence. We demonstrate that even very small spatial\nfluctuations of quantum well width dramatically increase rate of decoherence.\nDepending on the strength of exchange interaction and the amplitude of the\nfluctuations the decoherence can be homogeneous or inhomogeneous. In the\nhomogeneous regime, the transverse (with respect to magnetic field) component\nof the electron spin decays on the short time scale exponentialy, while the\nlong-time spin dynamics is non-exponential demonstrating long-lived power law\ntail.

A general method is outlined for obtaining corresponding\nbounds when approximating the distribution of a sum of general discrete random\nvariables by an infinitely divisible distribution.\n  Second, in the particular case when the $X_i$ are independent, the following\nsharper bound is established, \\ben D(P_{S_n}\\|\\Pol)\\leq \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\n\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{p_i^3}{1-p_i}, % \\label{eq:abs2} \\een and it is also\ngeneralized to the case when the $X_i$ are general integer-valued random\nvariables.
