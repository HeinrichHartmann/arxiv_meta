The case is made by\nshowing that all the observed N and Delta resonances with masses below 2500 MeV\ndistribute fairly well each over the first levels of a unitary representation\nof the conformal group, a representation that covers the spectrum of a\nquark-diquark system, placed directly on the AdS_5 cone, conformally\ncompactified to R^1*S^3. The free geodesic motion on the S^3 manifold is\ndescribed by means of the scalar conformal equation there, which is of the\nKlein-Gordon type. The equation is then gauged by the \"curved\" Coulomb\npotential that has the form of a cotangent function. Conformal symmetry is not\nexact, this because the gauge potential slightly modifies the conformal\ncentrifugal barrier of the free geodesic motion. Thanks to this, the degeneracy\nbetween P11-S11 pairs from same level is relaxed, while the remaining states\nbelonging to same level remain practically degenerate. The model describes the\ncorrect mass ordering in the P11-S11 pairs through the nucleon spectrum as a\ncombined effect of the above conformal symmetry breaking, on the one side, and\na parity change of the diquark from a scalar at low masses, to a pseudoscalar\nat higher masses, on the other. The quality of the wave functions is\nillustrated by calculations of realistic mean-square charge radii and electric\ncharge form-factors on the examples of the proton, and the protonic P11(1440),\nand S11(1535) resonances.

In this model, DLAs typically arise a few kpc away from galaxies that\nwould be identified in emission. Narrow DLAs can arise from any halo and galaxy\nmass, but wide ones only arise in halos with mass >10^11 Mo, from either large\ncentral or small satellite galaxies. This implies that the success of this\noutflow model originates from being most efficient at pushing gas out from\nsmall satellite galaxies living in larger halos. This increases the\ncross-section for large halos relative to smaller ones, thereby yielding wider\nkinematics. Our simulations do not include radiative transfer effects or\ndetailed metal tracking, and outflows are modeled heuristically, but they\nstrongly suggest that galactic outflows are central to understanding DLA\nkinematics.

Often the\nrecruits for the group come from one country or countries, while the targets of\nthe operations are in another. Stopping such attacks is difficult because\nintervention in any region or route might merely shift the terrorists\nelsewhere. Here we propose a model of transnational terrorism based on the\ntheory of activity networks. The model represents attacks on different\ncountries as paths in a network. The group is assumed to prefer paths of lowest\ncost (or risk) and maximal yield from attacks. The parameters of the model are\ncomputed for the Islamist-Salafi terrorist movement based on open source data\nand then used for estimation of risks of future attacks. The central finding is\nthat the USA has an enduring appeal as a target, due to lack of other nations\nof matching geopolitical weight or openness. It is also shown that countries in\nAfrica and Asia that have been overlooked as terrorist bases may become highly\nsignificant threats in the future. The model quantifies the dilemmas facing\ncountries in the effort to cut such networks, and points to a limitation of\ndeterrence against transnational terrorists.\n"]}]
