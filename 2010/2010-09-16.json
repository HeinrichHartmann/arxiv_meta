One crucial step when studying the structure and dynamics of\nnetworks is to identify communities: groups of related nodes that correspond to\nfunctional subunits such as protein complexes or social spheres. Communities in\nnetworks often overlap such that nodes simultaneously belong to several groups.\nMeanwhile, many networks are known to possess hierarchical organization, where\ncommunities are recursively grouped into a hierarchical structure. However, the\nfact that many real networks have communities with pervasive overlap, where\neach and every node belongs to more than one group, has the consequence that a\nglobal hierarchy of nodes cannot capture the relationships between overlapping\ngroups. Here we reinvent communities as groups of links rather than nodes and\nshow that this unorthodox approach successfully reconciles the antagonistic\norganizing principles of overlapping communities and hierarchy. In contrast to\nthe existing literature, which has entirely focused on grouping nodes, link\ncommunities naturally incorporate overlap while revealing hierarchical\norganization. We find relevant link communities in many networks, including\nmajor biological networks such as protein-protein interaction and metabolic\nnetworks, and show that a large social network contains hierarchically\norganized community structures spanning inner-city to regional scales while\nmaintaining pervasive overlap.

Such methods will\nhave difficulty in sharing graphs since the number of graphs increases\nexponentially with the number of nodes. We propose a secret sharing scheme for\ngraphs where we use graph intersection for reconstructing the secret which is\nhidden as a sub graph in the shares. Our method does not rely on heavy\ncomputational operations such as modular arithmetic or polynomial interpolation\nbut makes use of very basic operations like assignment and checking for\nequality, and graph intersection can also be performed visually. In certain\ncases, the secret could be reconstructed using just pencil and paper by\nauthorised parties but cannot be broken by an adversary even with unbounded\ncomputational power. The method achieves perfect secrecy for (2, n) scheme and\nrequires far fewer operations compared to Shamir's algorithm. The proposed\nmethod could be used to share objects such as matrices, sets, plain text and\neven a heterogeneous collection of these. Since we do not require a previously\nagreed upon encoding scheme, the method is very suitable for sharing\nheterogeneous collection of objects in a dynamic fashion.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 6 figures"]}]

At least for the EVN, it is argued\nthat at some point all VLBI operations should be done in e-VLBI mode. This\nambition is based on the scientific case that is described in the EVN2015\nscience vision. At the same time, it should be taken into account that the\nlong-term future of radio astronomy is connected to the development of the SKA.\nThe consensus in the community is that there is a scientific case for Very Long\nBaseline Interferometry in the next decade, and synergy with the technology\ndevelopment for the SKA and its pathfinders should be explored to enhance the\nVLBI capabilities. It is noteworthy that e- VLBI has been recognised as a SKA\npathfinder. Here, I review the progress with e-VLBI, and the options to enhance\nthe sensitivity and operational efficiency of the EVN and global VLBI arrays,\nincluding the options for future correlators. In the coming years, through the\nnew NEXPReS effort, new ways are about to get introduced to enhance e-VLBI\noperations further to the level that all experiments can benefit from an e-VLBI\ncomponent.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Proceedings of Science\n  [PoS(ISKAF2010)072].
