It has been proposed that\nthe transition from primordial to modern initial mass functions occurs due to\nthe onset of effective metal line cooling at a metallicity Z/Z_sun = 10^{-3.5}.\nHowever, these simulations neglected molecular hydrogen cooling. We perform\nsimulations using the same initial conditions, but including molecular cooling,\nusing a complex network that follows molecular hydrogen formation and also\ndirectly follows carbon monoxide and water. We find that molecular hydrogen\ncooling allows roughly equivalent fragmentation to proceed even at zero\nmetallicity for these initial conditions. The apparent transition just\nrepresents the point where metal line cooling becomes more important than\nmolecular cooling. In all cases, the fragments are massive enough to be\nconsistent with models of primordial stellar masses, suggesting that the\ntransition to the modern initial mass function may be determined by other\nphysics such as dust formation. We conclude that such additional cooling\nmechanisms, combined with the exact initial conditions produced by cosmological\ncollapse are likely more important than metal line cooling in determining the\ninitial mass function, and thus that there is unlikely to be a sharp transition\nin the initial mass function at Z/Z_sun = 10^{-3.5}.\n","Comment: 41 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

These include photometric and astrometric\nmeasurements from Hubble Space Telescope, as well as constraints from higher\norder effects extracted from the ground-based light curve, such as microlens\nparallax, planetary orbital motion and finite-source effects. Our primary\nanalysis leads to the conclusion that the host of Jovian planet\nOGLE-2005-BLG-071Lb is an M dwarf in the foreground disk with mass M= 0.46 +/-\n0.04 Msun, distance D_l = 3.3 +/- 0.4 kpc, and thick-disk kinematics v_LSR ~\n103 km/s. From the best-fit model, the planet has mass M_p = 3.8 +/- 0.4 M_Jup,\nlies at a projected separation r_perp = 3.6 +/- 0.2 AU from its host and so has\nan equilibrium temperature of T ~ 55 K, i.e., similar to Neptune. A degenerate\nmodel less favored by \\Delta\\chi^2 = 2.1 (or 2.2, depending on the sign of the\nimpact parameter) gives similar planetary mass M_p = 3.4 +/- 0.4 M_Jup with a\nsmaller projected separation, r_\\perp = 2.1 +/- 0.1 AU, and higher equilibrium\ntemperature T ~ 71 K. These results from the primary analysis suggest that\nOGLE-2005-BLG-071Lb is likely to be the most massive planet yet discovered that\nis hosted by an M dwarf. However, the formation of such high-mass planetary\ncompanions in the outer regions of M-dwarf planetary systems is predicted to be\nunlikely within the core-accretion scenario. There are a number of caveats to\nthis primary analysis, which assumes (based on real but limited evidence) that\nthe unlensed light coincident with the source is actually due to the lens, that\nis, the planetary host. However, these caveats could mostly be resolved by a\nsingle astrometric measurement a few years after the event.\n","Comment: 51 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables, Published in ApJ"]}]

However, to a real astrophysical\nobserver within a finite time, this problem should be discussed in the point of\nview of the distant rest-observer, which is the main purpose of this paper.\nFollowing the seminal work of Oppenheimer and Snyder (1939), we present the\nexact solution for one or two dust shells collapsing towards a pre-existing\nblack hole. We find that the metric of the inner region of the shell is\ntime-dependent and the clock inside the shell becomes slower as the shell\ncollapses towards the pre-existing black hole. This means the inner region of\nthe shell is influenced by the property of the shell, which is contrary to the\nresult in Newtonian theory. It does not contradict the Birkhoff's theorem,\nsince in our case we cannot arbitrarily select the clock inside the shell in\norder to ensure the continuity of the metric. This result in principle may be\ntested experimentally if a beam of light travels across the shell, which will\ntake a longer time than without the shell. It can be considered as the\ngeneralized Shapiro effect, because this effect is due to the mass outside, but\nnot inside as the case of the standard Shapiro effect. We also found that in\nreal astrophysical settings matter can indeed cross a black hole's horizon\naccording to the clock of an external observer and will not accumulate around\nthe event horizon of a black hole, i.e., no \"frozen star\" is formed for an\nexternal observer as matter falls towards a black hole.

The latter consists of de Sitter interior region and exterior\nReissner-Nordstroem region glued together along their common horizon (it is the\ninner horizon from the Reissner-Nordstroem side). The matching horizon is\nautomatically occupied by the LL-brane as a result of its world-volume\nlagrangian dynamics, which dynamically generates the cosmological constant in\nthe interior region and uniquely determines the mass and charge parameters of\nthe exterior region. Using similar techniques we construct a self-consistent\nwormhole solution of Einstein-Maxwell system coupled to electrically neutral\nLL-brane, which describes two identical copies of a non-singular black hole\nregion being the exterior Reissner-Nordstroem region above the inner horizon,\nglued together along their common horizon (the inner Reissner-Nordstroem one)\noccupied by the LL-brane. The corresponding mass and charge parameters of the\ntwo black hole \"universes\" are explicitly determined by the dynamical LL-brane\ntension. This also provides an explicit example of Misner-Wheeler \"charge\nwithout charge\" phenomenon. Finally, this wormhole solution connecting two\nnon-singular black holes can be transformed into a special case of\nKantowski-Sachs bouncing cosmology solution.\n","Comment: 26 pages, more references and comments added"]}]

This paper studies the\n2-dimensional achievable rate region for such a two-way relay network with\ndistributed beamforming. With different assumptions of channel reciprocity\nbetween the source-relay and relay-source channels, the achievable rate region\nis characterized under two setups. First, with reciprocal channels, we\ninvestigate the achievable rate regions when the relay cluster is subject to a\nsum-power constraint or individual-power constraints.

Second, with the non-reciprocal channels, the achievable rate\nregions are also characterized for both the sum-power constraint case and the\nindividual-power constraint case.

When the hydrostatic gravitational contraction sets in, we find a\ntransient increase in electron flavor neutrino luminosities due to a change in\nthe accretion rate.

We rediscuss here several subtle issues\ninvolved in this work. So far only the scientific critique to this work was due\nto Tereno (astro-ph/9905144, astro-ph/9905298) and which was answered in Mitra\n(astro-ph/9905175, astro-ph/9905175, astro-ph/9905329). Now Tereno\n(gr-qc/0111073) has also admitted that the local 3-speed of a free particle as\nconventionally defined by all previous authors and as measured in any\ncoordinate system, is indeed c at the EH. Further since the acceleration SCALAR\nBLOWS UP at the EH, our result that there cannot be any EH at a finite R is\nreconfirmed. We explicitly show here that the final state of spherical collapse\nof very massive stars corresponds to a zero mass BH with 2M/R ->0. But at any\nfinite epoch there would be a Eternally Collapsing Objects (ECO) of finite\nmass. However, if quantum back reaction in the strong gravity regime would\ncause a phase transition p ~ rho, there could be static ultracompact objects\n(UCO) of ~ 10 M (solar). Further, if the phase transition goes proceeds to p=\n-rho, there could be UCOs of arbitrary high mass (Mazur & Mottola,\nastro-ph/0109035). Both ECOs and UCOs are expected to possess strong internal\nmagnetic field whereas the the same for a BH is zero. Robertson & Leiter (ApJ\n565, 447, 2002, astro-ph/0102381) have shown that the BH candiadates may indeed\npossess such strong intrinsic mag field. Thus the BHCs are likely to ECOs/UCOs\nrather than BHs.

We find that our data can be described by a broken power-law decay\nperturbed by a complex variable component. The early- and late-time decay\nslopes are determined to be ~1.1 and ~2, respectively. Assuming this single\npower-law model, we constrain the break to lie between ~3 and ~8 days after the\nburst. This simple, singly-broken power-law model, derived only from the\nanalysis of our optical observations, may also account for available multi-band\ndata, provided that the break happened ~8 days after the burst. The more\ncomplex double-jet model of Berger et al. provides a comparable fit to the\noptical, X-ray, mm and radio observations of this event. We detect a\nsignificant change in optical colors during the first day. Our color analysis\nis consistent with a cooling break frequency sweeping through the optical band\nduring the first day. The light curves of GRB 030329 reveal a rich array of\nvariations, superposed over the mean power-law decay. We find that the early\nvariations are asymmetric, with a steep rise followed by a relatively slower\n(by a factor of about two) decline. The variations maintain a similar time\nscale during the first four days, and then get significantly longer.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ with minor\n  changes.

This is only the second GRB host to date,\nwhich is classified as an ERO. The spectral energy distribution is typical of a\ndusty starburst galaxy, with a redshift, z~1.9, a luminosity, L~5L*, and an\ninferred stellar mass of ~10^11-10^12 Msun, two orders of magnitude more\nmassive than typical GRB hosts. A comparison to the z~2 mass-metallicity (M-Z)\nrelation indicates that the host metallicity is about 0.5 Zsun. This result\nshows that at least some GRBs occur in massive, metal-enriched galaxies, and\nthat the proposed low metallicity bias of GRB progenitors is not as severe as\npreviously claimed. Instead we propose that the blue colors and sub-L*\nluminosities of most GRB hosts reflect their young starburst populations. This,\nalong with the locally increased fraction of starbursts at lower stellar mass,\nmay in fact be the underlying reason for the claimed low metallicity bias of\nz<0.2 GRB hosts. Consequently, GRBs and their host galaxies may serve as a\nreliable tracer of cosmic star formation, particularly at z>1 where the M-Z\nrelation is systematically lower, and the star formation rate is dominated by\nsub-L* galaxies.\n","Comment: Submitted to ApJ; 9 pages, 4 figures"]}]
