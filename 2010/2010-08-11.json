Results: The distribution of the\nplanetary masses with X-ray flux suggests that erosion has taken place: most\nsurviving massive planets, (M_p sin i >1.5 M_J), have been exposed to lower\naccumulated irradiation. Heavy erosion during the initial stages of stellar\nevolution is followed by a phase of much weaker erosion.

We find no\nevidence for any such material, contradicting an earlier and surprising\ninference that Rhea, the second-largest moon of Saturn, possesses a system of\nnarrow rings embedded in a broad circum-satellite disk or cloud (Jones et al.\n2008, Science). If one accepts the calculations of the previous authors, our\nresults would require any narrow rings around Rhea to be composed of objects no\nsmaller than 10 meters in radius, in order to be massive enough to account for\nthe observed charged-particle absorptions but diffuse enough to evade detection\nin our images. Such a particle-size distribution is unrealistic given that\nerosion processes will break down 10-meter objects to smaller sizes, which\nwould then have been seen in our images. Furthermore, Jones et al. (2008)\nassumed that the absorption of electrons by hypothetical circum-Rhea particles\nis proportional to the volume of the particles, even when they are much larger\nthan the electron penetration depth (van Allen 1983, 1987, JGR). If we assume\ninstead that large particles can only absorb electrons efficiently near their\nsurfaces, then our results rule out any solid material orbiting Rhea as the\nexplanation for the absorptions detected by Jones et al.
