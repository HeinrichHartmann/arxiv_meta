These properties,\nwhich include a quasi two-dimensional conducting electron gas, low temperature\nsuperconductivity, and magnetism, are not present in the bulk materials,\ngenerating a great deal of interest in the fundamental physics of their\norigins. While it is generally accepted that the novel behavior arises as a\nresult of a combination of electronic and atomic reconstructions and\ngrowth-induced defects, the complex interplay between these effects remains\nunclear.
