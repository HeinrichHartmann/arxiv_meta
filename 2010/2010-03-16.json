Currently, the favoured model involves the accumulation of meter-sized\nobjects within a turbulent disc, followed by a phase of gravitational\ninstability. At best one can simulate a few million particles numerically as\nopposed to the several trillion meter-sized particles expected in a real\nprotoplanetary disc. Therefore, single particles are often used as\nsuper-particles to represent a distribution of many smaller particles. It is\nassumed that small scale phenomena do not play a role and particle collisions\nare not modeled. The super-particle approximation can only be valid in a\ncollisionless or strongly collisional system, however, in many recent numerical\nsimulations this is not the case.\n  In this work we present new results from numerical simulations of\nplanetesimal formation via gravitational instability. A scaled system is\nstudied that does not require the use of super-particles. We find that the\nscaled particles can be used to model the initial phases of clumping if the\nproperties of the scaled particles are chosen such that all important\ntimescales in the system are equivalent to what is expected in a real\nprotoplanetary disc. Constraints are given for the number of particles needed\nin order to achieve numerical convergence.\n  We compare this new method to the standard super-particle approach. We find\nthat the super-particle approach produces unreliable results that depend on\nartifacts such as the gravitational softening in both the requirement for\ngravitational collapse and the resulting clump statistics.

Although ionized astrophysical objects, like stars and\ngalactic disks, are almost perfectly conducting, they show indications of\nchanges in topology, `magnetic reconnection', on dynamical time scales.\nReconnection can be observed directly in the solar corona, but can also be\ninferred from the existence of large scale dynamo activity inside stellar\ninteriors. Solar flares and gamma ray busts are usually associated with\nmagnetic reconnection. Previous work has concentrated on showing how\nreconnection can be rapid in plasmas with very small collision rates. Here we\npresent numerical evidence, based on three dimensional simulations, that\nreconnection in a turbulent fluid occurs at a speed comparable to the rms\nvelocity of the turbulence, regardless of the value of the resistivity. In\nparticular, this is true for turbulent pressures much weaker than the magnetic\nfield pressure so that the magnetic field lines are only slightly bent by the\nturbulence. These results are consistent with the proposal by Lazarian and\nVishniac (1999) that reconnection is controlled by the stochastic diffusion of\nmagnetic field lines, which produces a broad outflow of plasma from the\nreconnection zone. This work implies that reconnection in a turbulent fluid\ntypically takes place in approximately a single eddy turnover time, with broad\nimplications for dynamo activity and particle acceleration throughout the\nuniverse.

In fact, according to the current transformation of quantum field\ntheory, creation operator of spinor particle is still creation operator and\nannihilation operator is also still annihilation operator. This result does not\nrepresent the real meaning of time reversal. In the interaction process, a\nparticle's creation operator should become the annihilation operator and its\nannihilation operator should become the creation operator after time reversal.\nIt is proved that when the reversion of creation and annihilation processes is\nconsidered in momentum space, under the condition of high energy, a great\nsymmetry violation of time reversal would be caused in some low order processes\nof electromagnetic interaction just as the Compton scattering in which the\npropagation lines of fermions are contained. This result contradicts with the\nexperiments of particle physics and is impossible. Meanwhile, it is proved that\nthe normalization processes of the third order vertex angles of electromagnetic\ninteraction also violate time reversal symmetry, no matter in the coordinate\nspace or in the momentum space. But the symmetry violation is small with a\nmagnitude order about 10(-5). The similar problems exist in the current C\ntransformation of quantum field theory. The C transformation of creation and\nannihilation operator can not be consistent with the C transformation of spinor\nparticle's wave functions in momentum space. We can obtain the correct C\ntransformation of creation and annihilation operator, but can not obtain the\ncorrect C transformation of wave functions in momentum space. Therefore, the\ncurrent rules of C,T transformations in quantum field theory has serious defect\nand should be redefined.\n"]}]

The so-called\n\"Ising-type\" non-Abelian topological order is likely to be physically realized\nin a number of systems, but it can only provide a universal gate set (a\nrequisite for quantum computation) if one has the ability to perform certain\ndynamical topology-changing operations on the system. Until now, practical\nmethods of implementing these operations were unknown. Here we show how the\nnecessary operations can be physically implemented for Ising-type systems\nrealized in the recently proposed superconductor-semiconductor and\nsuperconductor-topological insulator heterostructures. Furthermore, we specify\nroutines employing these methods to generate a computationally universal gate\nset. We are consequently able to provide a schematic blueprint for a fully\ntopologically-protected Ising based quantum computer using currently available\nmaterials and techniques. This may serve as a starting point for attempts to\nconstruct a fault-tolerant quantum computer, which will have applications to\ncryptanalysis, drug design, efficient simulation of quantum many-body systems,\nsolution of large systems of linear equations, searching large databases,\nengineering future quantum computers, and -- most importantly -- those\napplications which no one in our classical era has the prescience to foresee.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 5 figures"]}]
