Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is a\nwidely used approach that allows polarization enhancement by two-four orders of\nmagnitude without an increase in the polarizing field strength. In this work,\nthe first implementation of microtesla MRI with Overhauser DNP and SQUID signal\ndetection is described.

The experiments were performed at the\nmeasurement field of 96 microtesla with Overhauser enhancement at 3.5 - 5.7 mT\nfield. The Overhauser DNP enabled nuclear polarization enhancement by factor as\nhigh as -95 for protons and as high as -200 for carbon-13, corresponding to\nthermal polarizations at 0.33 T and 1.1 T fields, respectively. These results\ndemonstrate that SQUID-based microtesla MRI can be naturally combined with\nOverhauser DNP in one system, and that its signal-to-noise performance is\ngreatly improved in this case.

Two CB\nalgorithms based on cooperative feedback are proposed: one restricts the SU\ntransmit beamformer to be orthogonal to the quantized SU-to-PU channel\ndirection and the other relaxes such a constraint. In addition, cooperative\nfeedforward of the SU CDI from the SU transmitter to the PU receiver is\nexploited to allow more efficient cooperative feedback.

In this paper we study the influence of the ionizing cluster mass on\nthe emission line spectrum of Hii regions in order to determine the influence\nof low mass clusters on the integrated emission line spectra of galaxies.\nMethods. For this purpose, we present a grid of photoionization models that\ncovers metallicities from Z = 0.001 to Z = 0.040, ages from 0.1 to 10 Ma (with\na time step of 0.1 Ma), and cluster initial masses from 1 to 107 Mo. The\nstellar masses follow a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) in an\ninstantaneous burst mode of star formation. We obtain power-law scale-relations\nbetween emission-line luminosities and ionizing cluster masses from the grids\nand we evaluate the dependences on the ionizing cluster mass for some line\nluminosities, equivalent widths and line ratios. Results. Power-law\nscale-relations are shown to be useful tools to obtain robust diagnostics, as\nexamples: (a) H?/H? ratio varies from the usually assumed value of 2.86, these\nvariations imply the existence of a lower limit to the attainable precision in\nextinction estimations of ?E(B - V) ~ 0.1.; (b) EW(H?) is a good age indicator\nwith a small dependence on cluster mass, while EW([O iii] 5007) shows a\nnoteworthy mass dependence; (c) abundance estimations from R23 are practically\nunaffected by variations of the cluster mass; (d) estimations from S 23 and ?'\nwould improve if the cluster mass dependences were considered and (e) [Oii]\n3727/H? is a good star formation rate indicator for ages older than -4.5 Ma. We\nalso show that the ionizing cluster mass dependence explains why empirical\ncalibrations produce more reliable diagnostics of some emission lines than\nphotoionization models grids. Finally, we show preliminary results about the\ncontribution of low mass clusters (M < 104 Mo) to the integrated emission line\nspectra of galaxies, which can be as high as 80% for some relevant lines.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 10 Figs, published in A&A"]}]
