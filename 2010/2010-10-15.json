The approach uses classical and quantum versions of normal form\ntheory and the perspective of dynamical systems theory.

This has led to the understanding that a new\n(to reaction dynamics) type of phase space structure, a {\\em normally\nhyperbolic invariant manifold} (or, NHIM) is the \"anchor\" on which the phase\nspace structures governing reaction dynamics are built. The quantum normal form\ntheory provides a method for quantizing these phase space structures through\nthe use of the Weyl quantization procedure. We show that this approach provides\na solution of the time-independent Schr\\\"odinger equation leading to a (local)\nS-matrix in a neighborhood of the saddle point governing the reaction. It\nfollows easily that the quantization of the directional flux through the\ndividing surface with the properties noted above is a flux operator that can be\nexpressed in a \"closed form\". Moreover, from the local S-matrix we easily\nobtain an expression for the cumulative reactio probability (CRP).\nSignificantly, the expression for the CRP can be evaluated without the need to\ncompute classical trajectories. The quantization of the NHIM is shown to lead\nto the activated complex, and the lifetimes of quantum states initialized on\nthe NHIM correspond to the Gamov-Siegert resonances.

It has\nresisted a both global and precise physical interpretation despite a consequent\nnumber of works, observational, theoretical or using numerical simulations. It\nappears that its precise properties depend on the population of galaxies in\nstudy. Instead of selecting a priori these populations, we propose to\nobjectively construct homologous populations from multivariate analyses. We\nhave undertaken multivariate cluster and cladistic analyses of a sample of 56\nlow-redshift galaxy clusters containing 699 early-type galaxies, using four\nparameters: effective radius, velocity dispersion, surface brightness averaged\nover effective radius, and Mg2 index. All our analyses are consistent with\nseven groups that define separate regions on the global fundamental plane, not\nacross its thickness. In fact, each group shows its own fundamental plane,\nwhich is more loosely defined for less diversified groups. We conclude that the\nglobal fundamental plane is not a bent surface, but made of a collection of\nseveral groups characterizing several fundamental planes with different\nthicknesses and orientations in the parameter space. Our diversification\nscenario probably indicates that the level of diversity is linked to the number\nand the nature of transforming events and that the fundamental plane is the\nresult of several transforming events. We also show that our classification,\nnot the fundamental planes, is universal within our redshift range (0.007 -\n0.053). We find that the three groups with the thinnest fundamental planes\npresumably formed through dissipative (wet) mergers. In one of them, this(ese)\nmerger(s) must have been quite ancient because of the relatively low\nmetallicity of its galaxies, Two of these groups have subsequently undergone\ndry mergers to increase their masses. In the k-space, the third one clearly\noccupies the region where bulges (of lenticular or spiral galaxies) lie and\nmight also have formed through minor mergers and accretions. The two least\ndiversified groups probably did not form by major mergers and must have been\nstrongly affected by interactions, some of the gas in the objects of one of\nthese groups having possibly been swept out. The interpretation, based on\nspecific assembly histories of galaxies of our seven groups, shows that they\nare truly homologous. They were obtained directly from several observables,\nthus independently of any a priori classification. The diversification scenario\nrelating these groups does not depend on models or numerical simulations, but\nis objectively provided by the cladistic analysis. Consequently, our\nclassification is more easily compared to models and numerical simulations, and\nour work can be readily repeated with additional observables.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS; Monthly Notices of the Royal\n  Astronomical Society (2010)"]}]

Recently it has\nbeen introduced into evolutionary game theory. In evolutionary game dynamics,\nthe probability to be imitated or to reproduce depends on the performance in a\ngame. The influence of the game on the stochastic dynamics in finite\npopulations is governed by the intensity of selection. In many models of both\nunstructured and structured populations, a key assumption allowing analytical\ncalculations is weak selection, which means that all individuals perform\napproximately equally well. In the weak selection limit many different\nmicroscopic evolutionary models have the same or similar properties. How\nuniversal is weak selection for those microscopic evolutionary processes? We\nanswer this question by investigating the fixation probability and the average\nfixation time not only up to linear, but also up to higher orders in selection\nintensity.

Interfaces should capture as faithfully as possible the service\nbehaviour to make their automated analysis possible while not exhibiting\nimplementation details. In this position paper, we choose Labelled Transition\nSystems to specify the behavioural part of service interfaces. In particular,\nwe show that internal behaviours (tau transitions) are necessary in these\ntransition systems in order to detect subtle errors that may occur when\ncomposing a set of services together. We also show that tau transitions should\nbe handled differently in the compatibility and substitutability problem: the\nformer problem requires to check if the compatibility is preserved every time a\ntau transition is traversed in one interface, whereas the latter requires a\nprecise analysis of tau branchings in order to make the substitution preserve\nthe properties (e.g., a compatibility notion) which were ensured before\nreplacement.\n","Comment: In Proceedings WCSI 2010, arXiv:1010.2337"]}]

Our aim is to illustrate that the underlying solution\nstructure might be very complex as in the case of epitaxial growth but can be\nbetter understood when comparing to the much simpler results for the dewetting\nliquid film.

Nevertheless, it is shown that linear\nlong-wavelength density perturbations on a stationary flow are generically\nstable. Consequently, linear sound obeys a wave equation with analogy to\ngravity.

The study presents a systematic large-scale analysis\nof such conformational changes in the side chains. The results indicate that\nshort and long side chains have different propensities for the conformational\nchanges. Long side chains with three or more dihedral angles are often subject\nto large conformational transition. Shorter residues with one or two dihedral\nangles typically undergo local conformational changes not leading to a\nconformational transition. The relationship between the local readjustments and\nthe equilibrium fluctuations of a side chain around its unbound conformation is\nsuggested.

Stochastic parametric\nperturbations, modelling phenotypic variability, lead to a Langevin system with\ntwo sources of multiplicative noise. The stationary probability distributions\nhave two characteristic power-law scales. Numerical simulations show that noise\nsuppresses the explosion of the growth rate which occurs in the deterministic\ncounterpart. Instead, in different parameter regimes populations will grow with\n``anomalous'' stochastic rates and (i) stabilise at ``random carrying\ncapacities'', or (ii) go extinct in random times. Using logistic fits to\nreconstruct the simulated data, we find that even highly significant\nestimations do not recover or reflect information about the deterministic part\nof the process. Therefore, the logistic interpretation is not biologically\nmeaningful. These results have implications for distinct model-aided\ncalculations in biological situations because these kinds of estimations could\nlead to spurious conclusions.\n","Comment: Accepted in Physica A.
