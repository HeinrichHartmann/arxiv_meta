The first transition separates a continuous\nmotion regime at comparatively low packing fractions and large dragging force\nfrom an intermittent motion one at high packing fraction and low dragging\nforce.

A second transition is observed within the intermittent\nregime, when the intruder's motion is made of intermittent bursts separated by\nlong waiting times. We observe a peak in the relative fluctuations of the\nintruder's displacements and a critical scaling of the burst amplitudes\ndistributions. This transition occurs at the jamming point characterized in a\nprevious study and defined as the point where the static pressure (i.e. the\npressure measured in the absence of vibration) vanishes. Investigating the\nmotion of the surrounding grains, we show that below the fluidisation\ntransition, there is a permanent wake of free volume behind the intruder. This\ntransition is marked by the evolution of the reorganization patterns around the\nintruder, which evolve from compact aggregates in the flowing regime to\nlong-range branched shapes in the intermittent regime, suggesting an increasing\nrole of the stress fluctuations.

In fact, this data/model mismatch has inspired many attempts to\nmodify or replace HMMs with alternative models that are better able to take\ninto account the statistical dependence of frames. However it is fair to say\nthat in 2010 the HMM is the consensus model of choice for speech recognition\nand that HMMs are at the heart of both commercially available products and\ncontemporary research systems.

In this work we first combine\nthe sparsity-inducing property of the Lasso model, at the individual feature\nlevel, with the block-sparsity property of the group Lasso model, where sparse\ngroups of features are jointly encoded, obtaining a sparsity pattern\nhierarchically structured. This results in the hierarchical Lasso, which shows\nimportant practical modeling advantages. We then extend this approach to the\ncollaborative case, where a set of simultaneously coded signals share the same\nsparsity pattern at the higher (group) level but not necessarily at the lower\none. Signals then share the same active groups, or classes, but not necessarily\nthe same active set. This is very well suited for applications such as source\nseparation. An efficient optimization procedure, which guarantees convergence\nto the global optimum, is developed for these new models.
