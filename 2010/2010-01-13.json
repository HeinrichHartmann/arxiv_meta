Among the\nproposed methods in the literature, the generalized profiling estimation method\ndeveloped by Ramsay and colleagues is particularly promising for its\ncomputational efficiency and good performance. In this approach, the ODE\nsolution is approximated with a linear combination of basis functions. The\ncoefficients of the basis functions are estimated by a penalized smoothing\nprocedure with an ODE-defined penalty. However, the statistical properties of\nthis procedure are not known. In this paper, we first give an upper bound on\nthe uniform norm of the difference between the true solutions and their\napproximations. Then we use this bound to prove the consistency and asymptotic\nnormality of this estimation procedure. We show that the asymptotic covariance\nmatrix is the same as that of the maximum likelihood estimation. Therefore,\nthis procedure is asymptotically efficient. For a fixed sample and fixed basis\nfunctions, we study the limiting behavior of the approximation when the\nsmoothing parameter tends to infinity. We propose an algorithm to choose the\nsmoothing parameters and a method to compute the deviation of the spline\napproximation from solution without solving the ODEs.\n","Comment: Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/09-AOS724 the Annals of\n  Statistics (http://www.imstat.org/aos/) by the Institute of Mathematical\n  Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)"]}]

In this work, the\nanyons are pinned to precise spatial configurations by using specific external\npotentials. Such external potentials break the translational symmetry and it\nappears that one will be forced to simulate the braidings on the entire\nmany-body Hilbert space, an absolutely prohibitive scenario. We demonstrate how\nto overcome this difficulty and obtain the exact braidings for fairly large\nHall systems. For this, we show that the incompressible state of a general\n$(k,m)$ fractional Hall sequence can be viewed as the unique zero mode of a\nspecific Hamiltonian $H^{(k,m)}$, whose form is explicitly derived by using\nk-particles creation operators. The compressible Hall states corresponding to\n$n$$\\times$$k$ anyons fixed at $w_1$,...,$w_{nk}$ are shown to be the zero\nmodes of a pinning Hamiltonian $H^{(k,m)}_{w_1,...,w_{nk}}$, which is also\nexplicitly derived. The zero modes of $H^{(k,m)}_{w_1,...,w_{nk}}$ are shown to\nbe contained in the space of the zero modes of $H^{(k,m)}$. Therefore, the\ncomputation of the braidings can be done entirely within this space, which we\nmap out for a number of Hall systems. Using this efficient computational\nmethod, we study various properties of the Moore-Read states.

It is unique among planimeters in that it measures\nsomething more subtle than area, combining the area, centroid and other moments\nof the region being measured, with weights depending on the length of the\nplanimeter. As a tool for measuring area, it is most accurate for regions that\nare small relative to its length.\n  The configuration space of the planimeter is a non-principal circle bundle\nacted on by SU(1,1), (isom. to SL(2,R)). The motion of the planimeter is\nrealized as parallel translation for a connection on this bundle and for a\nconnection on a principal SU(1,1)-bundle. The holonomy group is SU(1,1). As a\nconsequence, the planimeter is an example of a system with a phase shift on the\ncircle that is not a simple rotation.\n  There is a qualitative difference in the holonomy when tracing large regions\nas opposed to small ones. Generic elements of SU(1,1) act on S^1 with two fixed\npoints or with no fixed points. When tracing small regions, the holonomy acts\nwithout fixed points. Menzin's conjecture states (roughly) that if a planimeter\nof length L traces the boundary of a region with area A > pi L^2, then it\nexhibits an asymptotic behavior and the holonomy acts with two fixed points,\none attracting and one repelling. This is obvious if the region is a disk, and\nintuitively plausible if the region is convex and A >> pi L^2. A proof of this\nconjecture is given for a special case, and the conjecture is shown to imply\nthe isoperimetric inequality.\n","Comment: AmS-TeX, 23 pages, 12 figures in 2 *.gif files.
