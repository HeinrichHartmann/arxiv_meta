In this paper we put forward\na fundamentally different approach that links such large-scale magnetic fields\nto the cosmological vacuum energy. In our scenario the dark energy is due to\nthe Veneziano ghost (which solves the $U(1)_A$ problem in QCD). The Veneziano\nghost couples through the triangle anomaly to the electromagnetic field with a\nconstant which is unambiguously fixed in the standard model. While this\ninteraction does not produce any physical effects in Minkowski space, it\ntriggers the generation of a magnetic field in an expanding universe at every\nepoch.

Accurate stellar\nabundances require the determinations of reliable physical parameters, namely\nthe effective temperature, surface gravity, microturbulent velocity, and\nmetallicity. This work presents the homogeneous derivation of such parameters\nfor a large sample of stars hosting planets (N=117), as well as a control\nsample of disk stars not known to harbor giant, closely orbiting planets\n(N=145). Stellar parameters and iron abundances are derived from an automated\nanalysis technique developed for this work. As previously found in the\nliterature, the results in this study indicate that the metallicity\ndistribution of planet hosting stars is more metal-rich by ~0.15 dex when\ncompared to the control sample stars. A segregation of the sample according to\nplanet mass indicates that the metallicity distribution of stars hosting only\nNeptunian-mass planets (with no Jovian-mass planets) tends to be more\nmetal-poor in comparison with that obtained for stars hosting a closely\norbiting Jovian planet. The significance of this difference in metallicity\narises from a homogeneous analysis of samples of FGK dwarfs which do not\ninclude the cooler and more problematic M dwarfs. This result would indicate\nthat there is a possible link between planet mass and metallicity such that\nmetallicity plays a role in setting the mass of the most massive planet.\nFurther confirmation, however, must await larger samples.\n","Comment: 41 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables, accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

In this paper we\nformulate a systematic examination of the variations in electron-phonon\ncoupling to oxygen phonons in the cuprates, incorporating a number of effects\narising from several aspects of chemical composition and doping across cuprate\nfamilies. It is argued that the electron-phonon coupling is a very sensitive\nprobe of the material-dependent variations of chemical structure, affecting the\norbital character of the band crossing the Fermi level, the strength of local\nelectric fields arising from structural-induced symmetry breaking, doping\ndependent changes in the underlying band structure, and ionicity of the crystal\ngoverning the ability of the material to screen $c$-axis perturbations. Using\nelectrostatic Ewald calculations and known experimental structural data, we\nestablish a connection between the material's maximal T$_c$ at optimal doping\nand the strength of coupling to $c$-axis modes. We demonstrate that materials\nwith the largest coupling to the out-of-phase bond-buckling (``$B_{1g}$\")\noxygen phonon branch also have the largest T$_c$'s. In light of this\nobservation we present model T$_c$ calculations using a two-well model where\nphonons work in conjunction with a dominant pairing interaction, presumably due\nto spin fluctuations, indicating how phonons can generate sizeable enhancements\nto T$_c$ despite the relatively small coupling strengths.

The\nblack-box method is used for the synchronization of the clocks and the space\naxes between two inertial systems or two accelerated systems and for the\nderivation of the transformations between them. There are two consistent ways\nof defining the inputs and outputs to describe the transformations and relative\nmotion between the systems. The standard approach uses a mixture of the two\nways. By formulating the principle of special and general relativity as a\nsymmetry principle we are able to specify these transformations to depend only\non a constant.\n  The transformations become Galilean if the constant is zero. Validity of the\nClock Hypothesis for uniformly accelerated systems implies zero constant. If\nthe constant is not zero, we can introduce a metric under which the\ntransformations become self adjoint. In case of inertial systems, the metric is\nthe Minkowski metric and we obtain a unique invariant maximal velocity. The\nball of the relativistically admissible velocities is a bounded symmetric\ndomain under projective maps.

By this principle, the\nrelativistic dynamic equation is defined by an element of the Lie algebra of\nthe above representation.
