We focus on the\norganization of the system into modules, i.e., neuronal groups having\nrelatively higher connection density compared to that of the overall network.\nWe show that this mesoscopic feature cannot be explained exclusively in terms\nof considerations, such as optimizing for resource constraints (viz., total\nwiring cost) and communication efficiency (i.e., network path length).\nComparison with other complex networks designed for efficient transport (of\nsignals or resources) implies that neuronal networks form a distinct class.\nThis suggests that the principal function of the network, viz., processing of\nsensory information resulting in appropriate motor response, may be playing a\nvital role in determining the connection topology. Using modular spectral\nanalysis, we make explicit the intimate relation between function and structure\nin the nervous system.

The computations of the\nCasimir free energy and pressure are performed for the configurations of two\nplates made of ferromagnetic metals (Co and Fe), for one plate made of\nferromagnetic metal and the other of nonmagnetic metal (Au), for two\nferromagnetic dielectric plates (on the basis of polystyrene), and for a\nferromagnetic dielectric plate near a nonmagnetic metal plate. The dielectric\npermittivity of metals is described using both the Drude and the plasma model\napproaches. It is shown that the Casimir repulsion through the vacuum gap can\nbe realized in the configuration of a ferromagnetic dielectric plate near a\nnonmagnetic metal plate described by the plasma model. In all cases considered,\nthe respective analytical results in the asymptotic limit of large separations\nbetween the plates are obtained. The impact of the magnetic phase transition\nthrough the Curie temperature on the Casimir interaction is considered. In\nconclusion, we propose several experiments allowing to determine whether the\nmagnetic properties really influence the Casimir interaction and to\nindependently verify the Drude and plasma model approaches to the thermal\nCasimir force.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 13 figures; to appear in Phys.

Recent research suggests that B\ncells can acquire antigen in membrane-bound form on the surface of\nantigen-presenting cells (APCs), with signaling being initiated within a few\nseconds of B cell/APC contact. During the earliest stages of B cell/APC\ncontact, B cell receptors (BCRs) on protrusions of the B cell surface bind to\nantigen on the APC surface and form micro-clusters of 10-100 BCR/Antigen\ncomplexes. In this study, we use computational modeling to show that B cell\naffinity discrimination at the level of BCR-antigen micro-clusters requires a\nthreshold antigen binding time, in a manner similar to kinetic proofreading. We\nfind that if BCR molecules become signaling-capable immediately upon binding\nantigen, there is a loss in serial engagement due to the increase in bond\nlifetime as koff decreases. This results in decreasing signaling strength as\naffinity increases. A threshold time for antigen to stay bound to BCR before\nthe latter becomes signaling-capable favors high affinity BCR-antigen bonds, as\nthese long-lived bonds can better fulfill the threshold time requirement than\nlow-affinity bonds. A threshold antigen binding time of ~10 seconds results in\nmonotonically increasing signaling with affinity, replicating the affinity\ndiscrimination pattern observed in B cell activation experiments. This time\nmatches well (within order of magnitude) with the experimentally observed time\n(~ 20 seconds) required for the BCR signaling domains to undergo antigen and\nlipid raft-mediated conformational changes that lead to association with Syk.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 11 figures"]}]

Hence,\nresearchers, for so long, have been examining ways to utilize biometric\nfeatures of the user instead of a memorable password or passphrase, in an\neffort to generate strong and repeatable cryptographic keys. Our objective is\nto incorporate the volatility of the user's biometric features into the\ngenerated key, so as to make the key unguessable to an attacker lacking\nsignificant knowledge of the user's biometrics. We go one step further trying\nto incorporate multiple biometric modalities into cryptographic key generation\nso as to provide better security. In this article, we propose an efficient\napproach based on multimodal biometrics (Iris and fingerprint) for generation\nof secure cryptographic key. The proposed approach is composed of three modules\nnamely, 1) Feature extraction, 2) Multimodal biometric template generation and\n3) Cryptographic key generation. Initially, the features, minutiae points and\ntexture properties are extracted from the fingerprint and iris images\nrespectively. Subsequently, the extracted features are fused together at the\nfeature level to construct the multi-biometric template. Finally, a 256-bit\nsecure cryptographic key is generated from the multi-biometric template. For\nexperimentation, we have employed the fingerprint images obtained from publicly\navailable sources and the iris images from CASIA Iris Database. The\nexperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n","Comment: Pages IEEE format, International Journal of Computer Science and\n  Information Security, IJCSIS February 2010, ISSN 1947 5500,\n  http://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/"]}]

Previous measurements in atomic-scale metal\njunctions at cryogenic temperatures have shown suppression of the shot noise at\nparticular conductance values. This suppression demonstrates that transport in\nthese structures proceeds via discrete quantum channels. Using a high frequency\ntechnique, we simultaneously acquire noise data and conductance histograms in\nAu junctions at room temperature and ambient conditions. We observe noise\nsuppression at up to three conductance quanta, with possible indications of\ncurrent-induced local heating and $1/f$ noise in the contact region at high\nbiases.

The challenge is to understand why in savanna ecosystems\ntrees and grasses coexist in a robust way with large spatio-temporal\nvariability. We propose a simple model, a variant of the Contact Process (CP),\nwhich includes two key extra features: varying external\n(environmental/rainfall) conditions and tree age. The system fluctuates locally\nbetween a woodland and a grassland phase, corresponding to the active and\nabsorbing phases of the underlying pure contact process. This leads to a highly\nvariable stable phase characterized by patches of the woodland and grassland\nphases coexisting dynamically. We show that the mean time to tree extinction\nunder this model increases as a power-law of system size and can be of the\norder of 10,000,000 years in even moderately sized savannas. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that while local interactions among trees may influence tree\nspatial distribution and the order of the transition between woodland and\ngrassland phases, they do not affect dynamical coexistence. We expect dynamical\ncoexistence to be relevant in other contexts in physics, biology or the social\nsciences.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 7 figures.

This notion is more economical than the usual notion in\nterms of left-right constraints, and is motivated by higher category theory. To\nstart, we describe the semi-monoidal category of all possible unit structures\non a given semi-monoidal category and observe that it is contractible (if\nnonempty). Then we prove that the two notions of units are equivalent in a\nstrong functorial sense. Next, it is shown that the unit compatibility\ncondition for a (strong) monoidal functor is precisely the condition for the\nfunctor to lift to the categories of units, and it is explained how the notion\nof Saavedra unit naturally leads to the equivalent non-algebraic notion of fair\nmonoidal category, where the contractible multitude of units is considered as a\nwhole instead of choosing one unit. To finish, the lax version of the unit\ncomparison is considered. The paper is self-contained. All arguments are\nelementary, some of them of a certain beauty.\n","Comment: Comments: LaTeX, 29 pages.

Stochastic centre manifold theory provides novel support for\ncoarse grained, macroscale, spatial discretisations of nonlinear stochastic\npartial differential or difference equations such as the example of the\nstochastically forced Burgers' equation. Dividing the physical domain into\nfinite length overlapping elements empowers the approach to resolve fully\ncoupled dynamical interactions between neighbouring elements. The crucial\naspect of this approach is that the underlying theory organises the resolution\nof the vast multitude of subgrid microscale noise processes interacting via the\nnonlinear dynamics within and between neighbouring elements. Noise processes\nwith coarse structure across a finite element are the most significant noises\nfor the discrete model. Their influence also diffuses away to weakly correlate\nthe noise in the spatial discretisation. Nonlinear interactions have two\nfurther consequences: additive forcing generates multiplicative noise in the\ndiscretisation; and effectively new noise processes appear in the macroscale\ndiscretisation.
