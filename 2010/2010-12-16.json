The formation of Langmuir solitons through the coupling of\nhigh-frequency (hf) Langmuir and low-frequency (lf) ion-acoustic waves, is one\nof the most interesting features in the context of turbulence in modern plasma\nphysics.

By\nRashba-like systems we refer to the Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit coupled\nphases; spin-split systems have spin-up and spin-down Fermi surfaces shifted\nrelative to each other. Both systems break parity but preserve time-reversal\nsymmetry. They belong to a class of symmetry-breaking ground states that\nsatisfy: (i) electron crystal momentum is a good quantum number (ii) these\nstates have no net magnetic moment and (iii) their distribution of `polarized\nspin' in momentum space breaks the lattice symmetry. In this class, the\nrelevant Coulomb matrix elements are found to be nearest-neighbor exchange $J$,\npair-hopping $J'$ and nearest-neighbor repulsion $V$.

The relevant scales are discussed and an effective chiral power\nexpansion scheme, which is constructed to work around the nuclear saturation\ndensity, is presented. A realistic equation-of-state is obtained by adjusting\none free parameter, when the leading and subleading terms in the expansion are\nincluded. The saturation mechanism is due to correlations induced by the\none-pion-exchange interaction. Furthermore, we find a substantial deviation\nfrom the Fermi-gas estimate of the quark condensate in nuclear matter already\nat the saturation density.\n","Comment: revised version, with minor corrections, 13 pages, 3 Postscript\n  figures"]}]

One needs\n(a) tilt, and (b) to go beyond the single-particle ground state in each well,\ni.e., to two or more energy levels. For (a), we show that a small potential\ndifference between the wells, or tilt, causes the decoherence of Schrodinger\ncat states. However, these states reappear when the tilt can be compensated by\natom-atom interactions; these tilted cat states constitute partial cats that\nare protected from decoherence by the many body wavefunction. For (b), we\nprovide explicit criteria for when two energy levels are needed to describe the\nstate space. For typical experimental parameters, two levels are indeed\nrequired for creation of cat states.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures"]}]
