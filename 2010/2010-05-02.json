Moreover, stability measurements helps in a correct\ndata understanding. It is, indeed, realistic to think that environmental\ncondition can introduce casual errors in the working good system. Discrepancies\nin the working good condition, under stochastic variability (environment), have\nto be related to systematic errors introduced by the set of pre and/or\npost-processing operations and/or by any forms of MRS bad-working tool that\ndiffers from the previous. The quality control minimal protocol has been\nexecuted on a Philips-Achieva MRS system utilizing a phantom supplied by the\nmanufacturer. The minimal protocol consists of two steps: reproducibility and\nperformance tests. The reproducibility of the MRS measurements helps in\nquantifying the stability of the system.

In this case there is a correspondence $K \\leftrightarrow\n\\Omega(K)$ such that the poset $K$ can be reconstructed from its incidence\nalgebra up to an isomorphism -- due to Stanley theorem. In the meantime, a\nmonotone mapping between two posets in general induces no homomorphism of their\nincidence algebras.\n  In this paper I show that if the class of posets is confined to simplicial\ncomplexes then their incidence algebras acquire the structure of differential\nmoduli and the correspondence $K\\leftrightarrow\\Omega(K)$ is a contravariant\nfunctor.\n","Comment: LaTex2e, 14 pages"]}]
