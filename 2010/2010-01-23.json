Such theorems have been proved for various general\nclasses of continuous-time deterministic and stochastic processes, but always\nunder the assumption that the forces driving the system are time independent,\nand often relying on the existence of a limiting ergodic distribution. In this\npaper we extend the asymptotic fluctuation theorem for the first time to\ninhomogeneous continuous-time processes without a stationary distribution,\nconsidering specifically a finite state Markov chain driven by periodic\ntransition rates. We find that for both entropy production and heat\ndissipation, the usual Gallavotti-Cohen symmetry of the rate function is\ngeneralized to an analogous relation between the rate functions of the original\nprocess and its corresponding backward process, in which the trajectory and the\ndriving protocol have been time-reversed. The effect is that spontaneous\npositive fluctuations in the long time average of each quantity in the forward\nprocess are exponentially more likely than spontaneous negative fluctuations in\nthe backward process, and vice-versa, revealing that the distributions of\nfluctuations in universes in which time moves forward and backward are related.\nAs an additional result, the asymptotic time-averaged entropy production is\nobtained as the integral of a periodic entropy production rate that generalizes\nthe constant rate pertaining to homogeneous dynamics.\n"]}]

Given a pair (q,g) and an integer N, we determine\nthe possible zeta functions of genus-g curves over F_q with N points, and then\ndeduce properties of the curves from their zeta functions. In many cases we can\nshow that a genus-g curve over F_q with N points must have a low-degree map to\nanother curve over F_q, and often this is enough to give us a contradiction. In\nparticular, we able to provide eight previously unknown values of N_q(g),\nnamely: N_4(5) = 17, N_4(10) = 27, N_8(9) = 45, N_{16}(4) = 45, N_{128}(4) =\n215, N_3(6) = 14, N_9(10) = 54, and N_{27}(4) = 64. Our arguments also allow us\nto give a non-computer-intensive proof of the recent result of Savitt that\nthere are no genus-4 curves over F_8 having exactly 27 rational points.\nFurthermore, we show that there is an infinite sequence of q's such that for\nevery g with 0 < g < log_2 q, the difference between the Weil-Serre bound on\nN_q(g) and the actual value of N_q(g) is at least g/2.\n","Comment: LaTex, 40 pages.
