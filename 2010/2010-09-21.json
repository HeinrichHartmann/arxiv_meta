A broad-band excitation seems the\nnatural choice to drive the series of excitation and deexcitation steps\nrequired to form a molecule in its vibronic ground state from two scattering\natoms. First attempts at femtosecond photoassociation were, however, hampered\nby the requirement to eliminate the atomic excitation leading to trap\ndepletion. On the other hand, molecular levels very close to the atomic\ntransition are to be excited. The broad bandwidth of a femtosecond laser then\nappears to be rather an obstacle. To overcome the ostensible conflict of\ndriving a narrow transition by a broad-band laser, we suggest a two-photon\nphotoassociation scheme. In the weak-field regime, a spectral phase pattern can\nbe employed to eliminate the atomic line. When the excitation is carried out by\nmore than one photon, different pathways in the field can be interfered\nconstructively or destructively. In the strong-field regime, a temporal phase\ncan be applied to control dynamic Stark shifts. The atomic transition is\nsuppressed by choosing a phase which keeps the levels out of resonance. We\nderive analytical solutions for atomic two-photon dark states in both the\nweak-field and strong-field regime. Two-photon excitation may thus pave the way\ntoward coherent control of photoassociation. Ultimately, the success of such a\nscheme will depend on the details of the excited electronic states and\ntransition dipole moments.

The energy of the photons is converted into\nelectronic one via electronic excitations changing the cohesive energy. This\nchanges the chemical potential controlling the phase transition. In view of the\nadvances in laser optics photon induced transitions are expected to become an\nactive area in non-equilibrium physics and phase transition dynamics.\nConservation laws like energy or angular momentum conservation control the time\nduring which the transitions occur. Since the photon induced effects result\nlargely from weakening or strenghtening of the bonding between the atoms or\nmolecules transitions like solid/liquid etc. can be shifted in both directions.\nPhotoinduced transitions will be discussed from an unified point of view.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 10 figures"]}]

We also propose the idea of Layered Fault\nTolerant Specification (LFTS) to make the method extensible to dependable\nsystems. The principle is layering the specification, for the sake of clarity,\nin (at least) two different levels, the first one for the normal behavior and\nthe others (if more than one) for the abnormal. The abnormal behavior is\ndescribed in terms of an Error Injector (EI) which represents a model of the\nerroneous interference coming from the environment. This structure has been\ninspired by the notion of idealized fault tolerant component but the\ncombination of LFTS and EI using rely guarantee thinking to describe\ninterference can be considered one of the main contributions of this work.
