We obtain this estimate\nproving a stronger result: using some estimates for the probability that Ito\nprocesses remain around a deterministic curve from Bally et al. '09, we lower\nbound the probability that the couple (X,V) remains around a two-dimensional\ncurve up to a given maturity, X being the log-return process and V its\ninstantaneous variance. Then we find the optimal curve leading to the bounds on\nthe terminal cdf. The method we rely on does not require inversion of\ncharacteristic functions but works for general coefficients of the underlying\nSDE (in particular, no affine structure is needed). Even though the involved\nconstants are less sharp than the ones derived for stochastic volatility models\nwith a particular structure, our lower bounds entail moment explosion, thus\nimplying that Black-Scholes implied volatility always displays wings in the\nconsidered class of models. In a second part of this paper, using Malliavin\ncalculus techniques, we show that an analogous estimate holds for the density\nof the log-returns as well.\n"]}]

The second one is the\ncollective localisation of free charge at macroscopic interfaces like surfaces,\nelectrodes and grain boundaries in ceramics. Polarons have been observed in\nmany oxide perovskites mostly when cations having several stable electronic\nconfigurations are present. In manganites, the density of such polarons is so\nhigh as to drive a net lattice of interacting polarons. On the other hand, in\nferroelectric materials like BaTiO3 and LiNbO3, the density of polarons is\nusually very small but they can influence strongly the macroscopic\nconductivity. The contribution of such polarons to the dielectric spectra of\nferroelectric materials is described. Even residual impurities as for example\nIron can induce well defined anomalies at very low temperatures. This is mostly\nresulting from the interaction between localised polarons and the highly\npolarisable ferroelectric network in which they are embedded. The case of such\nresidual polarons in SrTiO3 will be described in more details, emphasizing the\nquantum polaron state at liquid helium temperatures. Recently, several\nnon-ferroelectric oxides have been shown to display giant effective dielectric\npermittivity.
