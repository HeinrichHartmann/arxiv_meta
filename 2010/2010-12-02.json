They induce\nboth area and angular distortions. If the angular distortion is bounded, the\nmapping is called a {\\it quasi-conformal} map. Many surface maps in our\nphysical world are quasi-conformal. The angular distortion of a quasi-conformal\nmap can be represented by Beltrami differentials. According to quasi-conformal\nTeichm\\\"uller theory, there is an 1-1 correspondence between the set of\nBeltrami differentials and the set of quasi-conformal surface maps. Therefore,\nevery quasi-conformal surface map can be fully determined by the Beltrami\ndifferential and can be reconstructed by solving the so-called Beltrami\nequation.\n  In this work, we propose an effective method to solve the Beltrami equation\non general Riemann surfaces. The solution is a quasi-conformal map associated\nwith the prescribed Beltrami differential. We firstly formulate a discrete\nanalog of quasi-conformal maps on triangular meshes. Then, we propose an\nalgorithm to compute discrete quasi-conformal maps. The main strategy is to\ndefine a discrete auxiliary metric of the source surface, such that the\noriginal quasi-conformal map becomes conformal under the newly defined discrete\nmetric. The associated map can then be obtained by using the discrete Yamabe\nflow method. Numerically, the discrete quasi-conformal map converges to the\ncontinuous real solution as the mesh size approaches to 0. We tested our\nalgorithm on surfaces scanned from real life with different topologies.\nExperimental results demonstrate the generality and accuracy of our auxiliary\nmetric method.\n"]}]

In fact, for establishing a multicast\nsession, an MI node could be crosswise visited more than once to switch a light\nsignal towards several destinations with only one wavelength through different\ninput and output pairs. This is called Cross Pair Switching (CPS). Thus, a new\nmulticast routing structure light-hierarchy is proposed for all-optical\nmulticast routing, which permits the cycles introduced by the CPS capability of\nMI nodes. We proved that the optimal structure for minimizing the cost of\nmulticast routing is a set of light-hierarchies rather than the light-trees in\nsparse splitting WDM networks.

Resonant systems are of\nparticular interest because their dynamical configuration provides constraints\non the unobservable formation and migration phase. In this thesis, formation\nscenarios for the planetary systems HD128311 and HD45364 are presented. N-body\nsimulations of two planets and two dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of\nproto-planetary discs are used to model the migration phase and the capture\ninto resonance. The results indicate that the proto-planetary disc has a larger\nsurface density than previously thought. Proto-planets are exposed to\nstochastic forces, generated by density fluctuations in the disc. A generic\nmodel of both a single planet, and two planets in resonance, being\nstochastically forced is presented. The system GJ876, for example, is stable\nfor reasonable strengths of the stochastic forces, but systems with lighter\nplanets can get disrupted. Even if they are not disrupted completely,\nstochastic forces create characteristic, observable libration patterns.\nTurbulence plays also an important role during the early phases of the planet\nformation process. Due to the large separation of scales, the gravitational\ncollapse in the core accretion model is very hard to model numerically. A\nscaled method is presented, that allows for the correct treatment of\nself-gravity in a marginally collisional system by taking into account the\nrelevant small scale processes.
