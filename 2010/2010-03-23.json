Our study focused on the kinetics of phase transition\nrather than the nucleation of a seed of a new phase that was introduced into\nthe matrix of the old phase when the relative stability of the three phases\nwere changed. We found dynamical as well as kinetically arrested static\nscenarios in the appearance of the macroscopic metastable phase. A few other\ninteresting scenarios of the kinetics of phase transition in this three-phase\nsystem will be demonstrated and discussed.\n","Comment: 4 pages 8 figures, conference (ISMANAM2009) paper, to be published in\n  Jouranl of Alloys and Compounds"]}]

We focus on\nthe occurrence of Stommel's retention zones, and on the splitting of their\nseparatrices. The goal of this paper is to analyze under which conditions these\nretention zones can form, and under which conditions they can break and induce\nchaotic particle settling. The terminal velocity of the particle in still fluid\nis of the order of the typical velocity of the flow, and the particle response\ntime is much smaller than the typical flow time-scale. It is observed that if\nthe flow is steady and has an upward streamline where the vertical velocity has\na strict local maximum, then inertialess particle trajectories can take locally\nthe form of elliptic Stommel cells, provided the particle terminal velocity is\nclose enough to the local peak flow velocity. These structures only depend on\nthe local flow topology and do not require the flow to have closed streamlines\nor stagnation points. If, in addition, the flow is submitted to a weak\ntime-periodic perturbation, classical expansions enable one to write the\nparticle dynamics as a hamiltonian system with one degree of freedom, plus a\nperturbation containing both the dissipative terms of the particle motion\nequation and the flow unsteadiness. Melnikov's method therefore provides\naccurate criteria to predict the splitting of the separatrices of the elliptic\ncell mentioned above, leading to chaotic particle trapping and chaotic\nsettling. The effect of particle inertia and flow unsteadiness on the\noccurrence of simple zeros in Melnikov's function is discussed.

Salas and Sokal have given a computer assisted proof of strong\nspatial mixing on the kagome lattice for q>=6 under any temperature, including\nzero temperature. It is believed that there is strong spatial mixing for q>=4.\nHere we give a computer assisted proof of strong spatial mixing for q=5 and\nzero temperature. It is commonly known that strong spatial mixing implies that\nthere is a unique infinite-volume Gibbs measure and that the Glauber dynamics\nis rapidly mixing. We give a proof of rapid mixing of the Glauber dynamics on\nany finite subset of the vertices of the kagome lattice, provided that the\nboundary is free (not coloured). The Glauber dynamics is not necessarily\nirreducible if the boundary is chosen arbitrarily for q=5 colours. The Glauber\ndynamics can be used to uniformly sample proper 5-colourings. Thus, a\nconsequence of rapidly mixing Glauber dynamics is that there is fully\npolynomial randomised approximation scheme for counting the number of proper\n5-colourings.\n","Comment: 34 pages, 11 figures"]}]

In this paper we\nintroduce hierarchical models for such tasks, in which the points in the\nconfigurations are either unlabelled, or have at most a partial labelling\nconstraining the matching, and in which some points may only appear in one of\nthe configurations. We derive procedures for simultaneous inference about the\nmatching and the transformation, using a Bayesian approach.
