We\nhave assembled a catalog of high-resolution HST spectra of the emission lines\nof unobscured low-redshift quasars, and have characterized the variance in the\nshapes of their lines. We then add simulated absorption from the high-redshift\nIGM to these quasar spectra in order to determine the corresponding\nuncertainties in reionization constraints using current and future samples of z\n> 6 quasar spectra. We find that, if the redshift of the Lyman-alpha emission\nline is presumed to coincide with the systemic redshift determined from metal\nlines, the inferred IGM neutral fraction is systematically biased to low values\ndue to a systematic blueshift of the Lyman-alpha line relative to the metal\nlines. If a similar blueshift persists in quasars at z > 6, this bias\nstrengthens previous claims of a significant neutral hydrogen fraction at z ~\n6.

A particular situation which favours the formation of exotic\nphases of the electron liquid in complex materials is that where a quantum\ncritical point (QCP) is present the phase diagram. Neighbouring regions in\nparameter space reveal unusual physical properties, described as non-Fermi\nliquid behaviour.\n  One of the important problems in quantum criticality is to find out how the\nFermi surface (FS) of a material evolves near a QCP. The traditional method for\nstudying the FS of materials is the de Haas van Alphen effect (dHvA). A quantum\ncritical end point (QCEP) has been reported in the highly correlated metal\nSr3Ru2O7, which is tuned using a magnetic field high enough to perform the dHvA\nexperiment. It moreover features a new emergent phase in the vicinity of the\nQCEP, a nematic type of electron ordering.\n  The subject of this thesis is the study of the FS of Sr3Ru2O7 using the dHvA\neffect. Three aspects were explored. The first was the determination of the FS\nat fields both above and below that where the QCEP arises. The second was the\nsearch for quantum oscillations inside the nematic phase. The third was a\nreinvestigation of the behaviour of the quasiparticle effective masses near the\nFS.\n  A complete robust model for the FS of Sr3Ru2O7 at zero fields was determined.\nMoreover, the new measurements of the quasiparticle masses revealed that no\nmass enhancements exist anywhere around the QCEP. Finally, we report dHvA\noscillations inside the nematic phase, which suggests that the carriers consist\nof Landau quasiparticles.\n","Comment: PhD Thesis, University of St. Andrews"]}]

Based on this theory, the dielectric\nfunctions of mono- and multi-layer graphenes are deduced and compared with\nthose of terrestrial graphite. The resonance width of an ordered stack of\ngraphenes is found to increase with the number of layers while the central\nfrequency stays constant. This is the basis of the polycrystalline model of the\ncarrier of the 2175 Angstrom interstellar extinction band. In this model, the\ncarrier dust grains derive from parent hydrocarbon grains. As a grain ages in\nthe IS medium, the light atoms are expelled, hexagonal carbon rings lump\ntogether into compact planar clusters, which then assemble into stacks of\nparallel, equidistant, graphene-like layers. This so-called graphitization is\nwell known to occur in the earth or under strong heating. As the number of\nlayers in each stack increases and their relative orientational order improves,\nthe pi resonance width increases asymptotically towards that of terrestrial\ngraphite. Because of the initial random structure of the parent grains, many\nrandomly oriented stacks may coexist in the same grain. Calculations of the\ndielectric response of this composite medium show that, for such a grain, the\nwidth of the extinction efficiency peak follows the same trend as the pi\nresonance of the average stack, and thus covers the observed range of IS\nfeature widths, at very nearly constant peak frequency.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 3 figures"]}]

This sample\nconsists of two subsamples of 61 non-interacting galaxies (control sample) and\nof 49 interacting galaxies/minor merging candidates.

We show that the distribution of\nmorphological types of both subsamples is almost indistinguishable, covering\nthe range between 0 <= T <= 9. An improved, 3-dimensional disk modelling- and\nfitting procedure is described in order to analyze and to compare the disk\nstructure of our sample galaxies by using characteristic parameters. We find\nthat the vertical brightness profiles of galactic disks respond very sensitive\neven to small deviations from the perfect edge-on orientation.
