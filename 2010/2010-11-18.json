This is in\nqualitative agreement with computer models which predict that variations in\nradioactive nickel yield have less impact on the rise than on the spread of the\ndecline rates. The differences we find in the rise and fall properties suggest\nthat a single 'stretch' correction to the light curve phase does not properly\nmodel the range of SN Ia light curve shapes. We select a subset of 105 light\ncurves well-observed in both rise and fall portions of the light curves and\ndevelop a '2-stretch' fit algorithm which estimates the rise and fall times\nindependently. We find the average time from explosion to B-band peak\nbrightness is 17.38 +/- 0.17 days.

However, the\nphysical processes that initiate and govern the birth of massive stars remain\npoorly understood. Two widely discussed models are monolithic collapse of\nmolecular cloud cores and competitive accretion. To learn more about massive\nstar formation, we perform simulations of the collapse of rotating, massive,\ncloud cores including radiative heating by both non-ionizing and ionizing\nradiation using the FLASH adaptive mesh refinement code. These simulations show\nfragmentation from gravitational instability in the enormously dense accretion\nflows required to build up massive stars. Secondary stars form rapidly in these\nflows and accrete mass that would have otherwise been consumed by the massive\nstar in the center, in a process that we term fragmentation-induced starvation.\nThis explains why massive stars are usually found as members of high-order\nstellar systems that themselves belong to large clusters containing stars of\nall masses. The radiative heating does not prevent fragmentation, but does lead\nto a higher Jeans mass, resulting in fewer and more massive stars than would\nform without the heating. This mechanism reproduces the observed relation\nbetween the total stellar mass in the cluster and the mass of the largest star.\nIt predicts strong clumping and filamentary structure in the center of\ncollapsing cores, as has recently been observed. We speculate that a similar\nmechanism will act during primordial star formation.\n","Comment: extended version, ApJ in press"]}]

These four macroscopics are\nenough to accurately describe the dynamics of the trait mean and of its genetic\nvariance (and in principle of any other quantity). Unlike previous approaches\nthat were based on an infinite series of moments or cumulants, which had to be\ntruncated arbitrarily, our calculations provide a well-defined approximation\nprocedure. We apply the framework to abrupt and gradual changes in the optimum,\nas well as to changes in the strength of stabilizing selection.
