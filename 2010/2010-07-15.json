Our\ncalculations concerning selectivity (93% in favor of NO over N2) are in very\nclose agreement with experiment (95%).

The significantly reduced N\ndiffusion caused by various intermediates present on the RuO2(110) surface\nseverely inhibits the recombination site for N+N -> N2, but interferes with\nthat for N + O -> NO far less owing to the nearby availability of O from\ndissociation of O2.\n","Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the authors. it's just been\n  submitted to a journal"]}]

A dynamical model, consistent with the van der Waals equation near the\nAndrews critical point, is derived. With this model, we deduce two physical\nparameters, which interact exactly at the Andrews critical point, and which\ndictate the dynamic transition behavior near the Andrews critical point. In\nparticular, it is shown that 1) the Andrews critical point is a switching point\nwhere the phase transition changes from the first order to the third order, 2)\nthe gas-liquid co-existence curve can be extended beyond the Andrews critical\npoint, and 3) the liquid-gas phase transition going beyond Andrews point is of\nthe third order. This clearly explains why it is hard to observe the gas-liquid\nphase transition beyond the Andrews critical point. Furthermore, the analysis\nleads naturally the introduction of a general asymmetry principle of\nfluctuations and the preferred transition mechanism for a thermodynamic system.\n"]}]

The Earth's electric field,\nafter its processing by de-noising techniques, was used, in conjunction with\nappropriate physical models, for the determination of the epicenter by\ntriangulation. The time of occurrence was determined in very short-term mode by\nthe use of the tidal waves (M1, K1) and the \"strange attractor like\" seismic\nelectric precursor, while its magnitude was calculated by the application of\nthe \"lithospheric seismic energy flow model\" applied on the past seismicity of\nthe Andravida EQ regional seismogenic area. The quite accurate obtained results\ncorroborate the validity of the methodology and suggest its use as a valuable\ntool for predicting large earthquakes. Key words: earthquake prediction,\nepicenter area, time of occurrence, earthquake magnitude, seismic potential,\ntidal waves.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 33 figures, URL: http://www.earthquakeprediction.gr"]}]
