Nevertheless, the efficiency most of them is still based on the\nfundamental physical phenomena, such as resonances. Thus, the understanding of\nthe resonance phenomena will be beneficial. One of the well-known examples is\nthe resonant enhancement of the transmission known as Breit-Wigner resonances,\nwhich can be described by a Lorentzian function. But, in many physical systems\nthe scattering of waves involves propagation along different paths, and, as a\nconsequence, results in interference phenomena, where constructive interference\ncorresponds to resonant enhancement and destructive interference to resonant\nsuppression of the transmission. Recently, a variety of experimental and\ntheoretical work has revealed such patterns in different branches of physics.\nThe purpose of this Review is to demonstrate that this kind of resonant\nscattering is related to the Fano resonances, known from atomic physics. One of\nthe main features of the Fano resonances is the asymmetric profile. The\nasymmetry comes from the close coexistence of resonant transmission and\nresonant reflection. Fano successfully explained such a phenomenon in his\nseminal paper in 1961 in terms of interaction of a discrete (localized) state\nwith a continuum of propagation modes. It allows to describe both resonant\nenhancement and resonant suppression in a unified manner.

Our understanding of stellar evolution and the final explosive\nendpoints such as supernovae or hypernovae or gamma-ray bursts relies on the\ncombination of magneto-hydrodynamics, energy generation due to nuclear\nreactions accompanying composition changes, radiation transport, and\nthermodynamic properties (such as the equation of state of stellar matter).\nNuclear energy production includes all nuclear reactions triggered during\nstellar evolution and explosive end stages, also among unstable isotopes\nproduced on the way. Radiation transport covers atomic physics (e.g. opacities)\nfor photon transport, but also nuclear physics and neutrino nucleon/nucleus\ninteractions in late phases and core collapse. Here we want to focus on the\nastrophysical aspects, i.e. a description of the evolution of massive stars and\ntheir endpoints, with a special emphasis on the composition of their ejecta (in\nform of stellar winds during the evolution or of explosive ejecta). Low and\nintermediate mass stars end their evolution as a white dwarf with an unburned C\nand O composition. Massive stars evolve beyond this point and experience all\nstellar burning stages from H over He, C, Ne, O and Si-burning up to core\ncollapse and explosive endstages. In this chapter we discuss the\nnucleosynthesis processes involved and the production of radioactive nuclei in\nmore detail.\n","Comment: 79 pages; Chapter of \"Astronomy with Radioactivities\", a book in\n  Springer's 'lecture notes in physics series, Vol. 812, Eds.
