However, weaker domain knowledge can\nbenefit from prior knowledge while being cost effective. Weak knowledge in the\nform of feature relative importance (FRI) is presented and explained. Feature\nrelative importance is a real valued approximation of a feature's importance\nprovided by experts. Advantage of using this knowledge is demonstrated by IANN,\na modified multilayer neural network algorithm. IANN is a very simple\nmodification of standard neural network algorithm but attains significant\nperformance gains. Experimental results in the field of molecular biology show\nhigher performance over other empirical learning algorithms including standard\nbackpropagation and support vector machines. IANN performance is even\ncomparable to a theory refinement system KBANN that uses stronger domain\nknowledge. This shows Feature relative importance can improve performance of\nexisting empirical learning algorithms significantly with minimal effort.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 1 figures, 3 tables"]}]

The solution of the\nproblem is obtained by calculating the Green's function which links the\npressure distribution to the normal displacements at the interface. The problem\nis then formulated in the form of a Fredholm integral equation of the first\nkind with a logarithmic kernel, and the boundaries of the contact area are\ncalculated by requiring that the energy of the system is stationary. The\nmethodology has been employed to study the adhesive contact between an elastic\nsemi-infinite solid and a randomly rough rigid profile with a self-affine\nfractal geometry. We show that, even in presence of adhesion, the true contact\narea still linearly depends on the applied load. The numerical results are then\ncritically compared with the prediction of an extended version of the Persson's\ncontact mechanics theory, able to handle anisotropic surfaces, as 1D\ninterfaces. It is shown that, for any given load, Persson's theory\nunderestimates the contact area of about 50% in comparison with our numerical\ncalculations. We find that this discrepancy is larger than what is found for 2D\nrough surfaces in case of adhesionless contact. We argue that this increased\ndifference might be explained, at least partially, by considering that\nPersson's theory is a mean field theory in spirit, so it should work better for\n2D rough surfaces rather than for 1D rough surfaces. We also observe, that the\npredicted value of separation is in very good agreement with our numerical\nresults as well as the exponent of the power spectral density of the contact\npressure distribution and of the elastic displacement of the solid. Therefore,\nwe conclude that Persson's theory captures almost exactly the main qualitative\nbehavior of the rough contact phenomena.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 9 figures"]}]
