Motivated\nby the recent discovery of extended UV (XUV) disks around many nearby spiral\ngalaxies, we use the observed stellar population to derive the recent star\nformation histories of five ~0.5 kpc-sized regions within this field.

We estimate our effective SFR\ndetection limit at ~2 x 10^-4 Msun/yr, which is lower than that of GALEX for\nregions of this size. As expected, the HII regions contain massive main\nsequence stars (in the mass range 18-27 Msun, based on our best extinction\nestimates), while similar massive main sequence stars are lacking in the\nUV-bright/Halpha-faint regions. The observations are consistent with stellar\nages <10 Myr in the HII regions, and >16 Myr in the UV-bright/Halpha-faint\nregions. All regions but the control have formed ~10^4 Msun of stars over the\npast ~65 Myr. Thus, our results, for at least one small area in the outer disk\nof M81, are consistent with an age difference being sufficient to explain the\nobserved discrepancy between star-forming regions detected in Halpha and those\ndetected exclusively in UV.

The power\nloss is due to the inherent energy dissipation when SCC operate between or\noutside their output target voltages. This drawback was alleviated in this work\nby developing two new classes of SCC providing binary and arbitrary resolution\nof closely spaced target voltages. Special attention is paid to SCC topologies\nof binary resolution. Namely, SCC systems that can be configured to have a\nno-load output to input voltage ratio that is equal to any binary fraction for\na given number of bits. To this end, we define a new number system and develop\nrules to translate these numbers into SCC hardware that follows the algebraic\nbehavior. According to this approach, the flying capacitors are automatically\nkept charged to binary weighted voltages and consequently the resolution of the\ntarget voltages follows a binary number representation and can be made higher\nby increasing the number of capacitors (bits). The ability to increase the\nnumber of target voltages reduces the spacing between them and, consequently,\nincreases the efficiency when the input varies over a large voltage range. The\nthesis presents the underlining theory of the binary SCC and its extension to\nthe general radix case. Although the major application is in step-down SCC, a\nsimple method to utilize these SCC for step-up conversion is also described, as\nwell as a method to reduce the output voltage ripple. In addition, the generic\nand unified model is strictly applied to derive the SCC equivalent resistor,\nwhich is a measure of the power loss.
