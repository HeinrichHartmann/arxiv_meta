In this paper, we consider a new threat to this type of\nprotocol: if a server's high entropic secret gets compromised (e.g., due to\ncryptanalysis, virus attack or a poor management), the adversary might {\\em\nquickly} break lots of passwords and cause uncountable damage. In this case,\none should not expect the protocol to be secure against an off-line dictionary\nattack since, otherwise, the protocol is in fact a secure password-only key\nexchange where the server also only has a password (by making the server high\nentropic secret public). Of course a password-only key exchange does not suffer\nfrom this threat as the server does not have a high entropic secret at all.\nHowever, known password-only key exchange are not very efficient (note: we only\nconsider protocols without random oracles). This motivates us to study\nefficient and secure asymmetric password key exchange that avoids the new\nthreat.

We numerically calculate the\ntunneling rate from a laterally confined, few-channel external lead into the\nlowest orbital state of a spin-orbit coupled quantum dot. We find two\nmechanisms leading to a spin-dependent tunneling rate. The first originates\nfrom different electronic $g$-factors in the lead and in the dot, and favors\nthe tunneling into the spin ground (excited) state when the $g$-factor\nmagnitude is larger (smaller) in the lead. The second is triggered by\nspin-orbit interactions via the opening of off-diagonal spin-tunneling\nchannels. It systematically favors the spin excited state. For physical\nparameters corresponding to lateral GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures and the\nexperimentally reported tunneling rates, both mechanisms lead to a discrepancy\nof $\\sim$10% in the spin up vs spin down tunneling rates. We conjecture that\nthe significantly larger discrepancy observed experimentally originates from\nthe enhancement of the $g$-factor in laterally confined lead.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 9 figures"]}]

This process (commonly known as the Babcock-Leighton\nmechanism) is usually modeled as a near-surface, spatially distributed\n$\\alpha$-effect in kinematic mean-field dynamo models. However, this\nformulation leads to a relationship between polar field strength and meridional\nflow speed which is opposite to that suggested by physical insight and\npredicted by surface flux-transport simulations. With this in mind, we present\nan improved double-ring algorithm for modeling the Babcock-Leighton mechanism\nbased on active region eruption, within the framework of an axisymmetric dynamo\nmodel. Using surface flux-transport simulations we first show that an\naxisymmetric formulation -- which is usually invoked in kinematic dynamo models\n-- can reasonably approximate the surface flux dynamics. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that our treatment of the Babcock-Leighton mechanism through\ndouble-ring eruption leads to an inverse relationship between polar field\nstrength and meridional flow speed as expected, reconciling the discrepancy\nbetween surface flux-transport simulations and kinematic dynamo models.\n","Comment: Published in ApJL"]}]
