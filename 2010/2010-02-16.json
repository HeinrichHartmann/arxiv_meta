With increasing redshift, the ratio Gamma=MBH/Mbulge relative to z=0\nalso seems to be larger for MBH >~ 10^{8.5} Msol. This study looks more closely\nat statistics to better understand the creation and observations of the\nMBH-Mbulge correlation. It is possible to show that if galaxy merging\nstatistics can drive the correlation, minor mergers are responsible for causing\na *convergence to linearity* most evident at high masses, whereas major mergers\nhave a central limit convergence that more strongly *reduces the scatter*. This\nstatistical reasoning is agnostic about galaxy morphology. Therefore, combining\nstatistical prediction (more major mergers ==> tighter correlation) with\nobservations (bulges = tightest correlation), would lead one to conclude that\nmore major mergers (throughout an entire merger tree, not just the primary\nbranch) give rise to more prominent bulges. With regard to controversial\nfindings that Gamma increases with redshift, this study shows why the\nluminosity function (LF) bias argument, taken correctly at face value,\nstrengthens rather than weakens the results. However, correcting for LF bias is\nunwarranted because the BH mass scale for quasars is bootstrapped to the\nMBH-Sigma* correlation in normal galaxies at z=0, and quasar-quasar comparisons\nare internally consistent. In Monte-Carlo simulations, high Gamma objects are\n\"under-merged\" galaxies that take longer to converge to linearity via minor\nmergers.

First, we\nbriefly review results obtained using an extended Dirac equation, which\nconclusively showed that, as a consequence of quantum relativistic corrections\narising from the time-dependence of the rest-energy, the electron gyromagnetic\nfactors are corrected. It is next demonstrated, using the data of Kusch & Foley\non the measurement of deltaS minus 2 deltaL together with the modern precise\nmeasurements of the electron deltaS where deltaS identically equal to gS minus\n2, that deltaL may be a small, non-zero quantity, where we have assumed\nRussel-Saunders LS coupling and proposed, along with Kusch and Foley, that gS =\n2 plus deltaS and gS = 1 plus deltaL. Therefore, there is probable evidence\nfrom experimental data that gS is not exactly equal to 1; the expectation that\nquantum effects will significantly modify the classical value of the orbital g\nis therefore reasonable. Finally, we show that if, as suggested by the results\nobtained from the modified Dirac theory, deltaS and deltaL depend linearly on a\ndimensionless parameter DELTA such that the gyromagnetic factors are considered\ncorrected as follows; gS = 2 plus 2 DELTA and gL = 1 minus DELTA, then the\nKusch-Foley data implies that the correction DELTA approximately equals 1.0\ntimes 10-3 . Modern, high precision measurements of the electron and muon\norbital gL are therefore required, in order to properly determine by\nexperiments the true value of gL minus 1, perhaps to about one part in a\ntrillion as was recently done for gS minus 2.\n","Comment: 16 pages"]}]
