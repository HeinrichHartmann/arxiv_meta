In particular we present a set\nof criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from the\nextensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discuss\nthe properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such\nobjects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An\nadditional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified\nfrom the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of\nresults, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with\nthose of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling\nof the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects\nexhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with\nactively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly\ndebris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends\ndown to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.\nThe lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from\nextra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.\nA spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are\nmore highly clustered than the later stages and that the background\nextra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function\nas seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches\nbetween several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO\npopulation and our Spitzer data set.\n"]}]

In order to achieve the large dynamical range required\nfor the charge measurement, the recently developed techniques of the emulsion\ncontrolled fading are used. The nuclear emulsions are inspected using fast\nautomated microscopes recently developed. A charge assignment efficiency of\nmore than 99% is achieved. The separation of Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium,\nBerillium, Boron and Carbon can be achieved at two standard deviations or\nconsiderably more, according to the track length available for the measurement.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 8 figures"]}]

In cases such as the former, we show that the pseudo mode theory for\nsingle quantum reservoir excitations can be obtained by applying the Fano\ndiagonalisation method to a system in which the atomic transitions are coupled\nto a discrete set of (cavity) quasimodes, which in turn are coupled to a\ncontinuum set of (external) quasimodes with slowly varying coupling constants\nand continuum mode density. Each pseudomode can be identified with a discrete\nquasimode, which gives structure to the actual reservoir of true modes via the\nexpressions for the equivalent atom-true mode coupling constants. The quasimode\ntheory enables cases of multiple excitation of the reservoir to now be treated\nvia Markovian master equations for the atom-discrete quasimode system.\nApplications of the theory to one, two and many discrete quasimodes are made.\nFor a simple photonic band gap model, where the reservoir structure is\nassociated with the true mode density rather than the coupling constants, the\nsingle quantum excitation case appears to be equivalent to a case with two\ndiscrete quasimodes.\n"]}]

Initially the atom is in its\nupper state and the cavity mode empty of photons. Following Glauber, the\nspectrum is defined via the response of a detector atom. Spectra are calculated\nfor the detector located inside the cavity (case A), outside the cavity end\nmirror (Case B-end emission), or placed for emission out the side of the cavity\n(Case C). The spectra for case A and case B are found to be essentially the\nsame. In all the cases the predicted lineshapes are free of instrumental\neffects and only due to cavity decay. Spectra are presented for intermediate\nand strong coupling regime situations (where both atomic transitions are\nresonant with the cavity frequency), for cases of non-zero cavity detuning, and\nfor cases where the two atomic transition frequencies differ. The spectral\nfeatures for Cases B(A) and C are qualitatively similar, with six spectral\npeaks for resonance cases and eight for detuned cases. These general features\nof the spectra can be understood via the dressed atom model. However, Case B\nand C spectra differ in detail, with the latter exhibiting a deep spectral hole\nat the cavity frequency due to quantum interference effects.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 14 figures; v2: very minor correction to two equations,\n  thicker lines in some figures"]}]
