Here we analyze the performance of\nRandom Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected\nfrom a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed\nentries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,\nwhich relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the\ntransmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of\nbeamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system\nrefers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go\nto infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,\ni.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The\nperformance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar\nquantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random\nsubspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and\napproximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers\n(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show\nthat these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size\nsystems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples\nshow that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only\nslightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched\nfilter can require significantly more feedback.\n"]}]

We find the spatial correlation lengths\nro ~ 3-6 Mpc/h, in agreement with the observations. Finally, we estimate the\nfield-to-field variation ~ 30% for current volume and flux limited surveys,\nagain consistent with observations.

These fringes are due to an\ninterference phenomenon occurring from straylight effects inside an\ninterferometric instrument. We developed an analytical approach to better\nunderstand this phenomenon when straylight causes crosstalk between beams.\n  We deduced that the parasitic interference significantly affects the\ninterferometric phase and thus the associated observables including the\ndifferential phase and the closure phase. The amount of parasitic flux coupled\nto the piston between beams appears to be very influential in this degradation.\nFor instance, considering a point-like source and a piston ranging from\n$\\lambda/500$ to $\\lambda/5$ in L band ($\\lambda=3.5\\:\\mu$m), a parasitic flux\nof about 1\\% of the total flux produces a parasitic phase reaching at most one\nthird of the intrinsic phase. The piston, which can have different origins\n(instrumental stability, atmospheric perturbations, ...), thus amplifies the\neffect of parasitic interference.\n  According to specifications of piston correction in space or at ground level\n(respectively $\\lambda/500\\approx 2$nm and $\\lambda/30\\approx 100$nm), the\ndetection of hot Jupiter-like planets, one of the most challenging aims for\ncurrent ground-based interferometers, limits parasitic radiation to about 5\\%\nof the incident intensity. This was evaluated by considering different types of\nhot Jupiter synthetic spectra.\n  Otherwise, if no fringe tracking is used, the detection of a typical hot\nJupiter-like system with a solar-like star would admit a maximum level of\nparasitic intensity of 0.01\\% for piston errors equal to $\\lambda$/15. If the\nfringe tracking specifications are not precisely observed, it thus appears that\nthe allowed level of parasitic intensity dramatically decreases and may prevent\nthe detection. In parallel, the calibration of the parasitic phase by a\nreference star, at this accuracy level, seems very difficult. Moreover, since\nparasitic phase is an object-dependent quantity, the use of a hypothetical\nphase abacus, directly giving the parasitic phase from a given parasitic flux\nlevel, is also impossible. Some instrumental solutions, implemented at the\ninstrument design stage for limiting or preventing this parasitic interference,\nappears to be crucial and are presented in this paper.\n"]}]
