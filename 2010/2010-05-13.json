First, motivated by sampling algorithms, we\nconsider probability distributions given in the form of an oracle\n$f:[n]\\to[m]$. Here the probability $\\PP_f(j)$ of an outcome $j\\in[m]$ is the\nfraction of its domain that $f$ maps to $j$. We give quantum algorithms for\ntesting whether two such distributions are identical or $\\epsilon$-far in\n$L_1$-norm. Recently, Bravyi, Hassidim, and Harrow \\cite{BHH10} showed that if\n$\\PP_f$ and $\\PP_g$ are both unknown (i.e., given by oracles $f$ and $g$), then\nthis testing can be done in roughly $\\sqrt{m}$ quantum queries to the\nfunctions. We consider the case where the second distribution is known, and\nshow that testing can be done with roughly $m^{1/3}$ quantum queries, which we\nprove to be essentially optimal. In contrast, it is known that classical\ntesting algorithms need about $m^{2/3}$ queries in the unknown-unknown case and\nabout $\\sqrt{m}$ queries in the known-unknown case. Based on this result, we\nalso reduce the query complexity of graph isomorphism testers with quantum\noracle access. While those examples provide polynomial quantum speed-ups, our\nthird example gives a much larger improvement (constant quantum queries vs\npolynomial classical queries) for the problem of testing periodicity, based on\nShor's algorithm and a modification of a classical lower bound by Lachish and\nNewman \\cite{lachish&newman:periodicity}.

The\ndelocalization mode is solitary wave along the 8 orders of geodesic. Solitary\nwave is derived from the balance between inverse cascade and cascade.\nIncreasing temperature only increases the number of inverse cascade and\ncascade. This model provides a unified mechanism to interpret ripplon,\nreptation, Boson peak, Ising model, non-ergodic, free volume, hard-sphere,\ntunneling, cage, compacting cluster, jamming behaviors, breaking solid lattice,\ngeometrical frustration, potential energy landscape, flow-percolation,\nthermo-disorder-induced localized energy, average energy of cooperative\nmigration along one direction, critical entanglement chain length, and Reynolds\nnumber, solitary wave, heteroclinic orbit in hydrodynamics. This model also\ndirectly deduces the Lindemann ratio, the famous 3.4 power law of viscosity of\nentangled macromolecules and the well-known WLF equation and shows that the\nClapeyron equation governing all first order phase transitions in\nthermodynamics only holds true in each subsystem, instead of the system in\nglass transition.\n","Comment: 76 pages; Key words: glass transition (theory); mosaic structure\n  (theory); solitary wave (theory); entangled polymer dynamics (theory);\n  statistical thermodynamics in glass transition"]}]
