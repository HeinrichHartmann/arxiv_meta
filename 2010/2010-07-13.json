A careful\nstudy in the magnetic properties has been carried out by the measurement of ac\nsusceptibility. The temperature range of CMR is greatly broadened with the\naddition of Fe. Substitution of Fe induces a gradual transition from a metallic\nferromagnetic with a high Curie temperature (Tc=270 K) to a ferromagnetic\ninsulator with low Tc=79 K. Increased spin disorder and decrease of Tc with\nincreasing Fe content are evident. The variations in the critical temperature\nTc and magnetic moment show a rapid change at about 4-5% Fe. The effect of Fe\nis seen to be consistent with the disruption of the Mn-Mn exchange possibly due\nto the formation of magnetic clusters. An extra-ordinary behavior in the out of\nphase part (x\") of ac susceptibility, characterized by double bump (shoulder),\nwas observed around x=0.01 and 0.02. The shoulder in x\" disappears at x>0.04 Fe\nconcentration. With increasing Fe concentration the x\" peak shift to T<T1/2\n(mid point of the transition temperature) and becomes broader. The x\" peak\nmoves to 8 or 10 K higher temperature on the application of a dc field, for 3 &\n4% samples. We also see increasing low temperature dissipation in more strongly\nFe doped samples i.e. increasing the Fe, leads to increased spin disorder and\ndissipation at low temperature. The effect of the dc field is discussed in\nterms of the suppression of spin fluctuations close to Tc. The same ionic radii\nof Fe3+ and Mn3+ cause no structure changes in either series, yet\nferromagnetism has been consistently suppressed by Fe doping. Doping with Fe\nbypasses the usually dominant lattice effects, but depopulate the hopping\nelectrons and thus weakens the double exchange.

This theory has been proposed in\nour previous works. In our previous studies, the energy gradient theory was\ndemonstrated to be applicable for wall-bounded parallel flows. It was found\nthat the critical value of the energy gradient parameter Kmax at turbulent\ntransition is about 370-389 for wall-bounded parallel flows (which include\nplane Poiseuille flow, pipe Poiseuille flow and plane Couette flow) below which\nno turbulence occurs. In this paper, the detailed derivation for the\ncalculation of the energy gradient parameter in the flow between concentric\nrotating cylinders is provided. The calculated results for the critical\ncondition of primary instability (with semi-empirical treatment) are found to\nbe in very good agreement with the experiments in the literature. A possible\nmechanism of spiral turbulence generation observed for counter-rotation of two\ncylinders can also be explained using the energy gradient theory. The energy\ngradient theory can serve to relate the condition of transition in\nTaylor-Couette flow to that in plane Couette flow. The latter reasonably\nbecomes the limiting case of the former when the radii of cylinders tend to\ninfinity. It is our contention that the energy gradient theory is possibly\nfairly universal for analysis of flow instability and turbulent transition, and\nis found valid for both pressure and shear driven flows in parallel and\nrotating flow configurations.\n","Comment: 38 pages; 12 figures"]}]

In a (genetically)\nuniform population a typically very small subpopulation becomes metabolically\ninactive whereas the majority subpopulation remains active and grows. Bacteria\nsuch as E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA-superbug), Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [1-3] show persistence. It can render\nbacteria less vulnerable in adverse environments [1, 4, 5] and their effective\neradication through medication more difficult [2, 3, 6]. Here we show that\nmedication treatment regimes may have to be modified when persistence is taken\ninto account and characterize optimal approaches assuming that the total\nmedication dose is constrained. The determining factors are cumulative\ntoxicity, eradication power of the medication and bacterial response\ntimescales. Persistent organisms have to be fought using tailored eradication\nstrategies which display two fundamental characteristics. Ideally, the\ntreatment time should be significantly longer than in the case of persistence\nwith the medication uniformly spread out over time; however, if treatment time\nhas to be limited, then the application of medication has to be concentrated\ntowards the beginning and end of the treatment. These findings deviate from\ncurrent clinical practice, and may therefore help to optimize and simplify\ntreatments. Our use of multi-objective optimization [7] to map out the optimal\nstrategies can be generalized to other related problems.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 6 figures"]}]
