Heterogeneous SN debris formed the planets.\nThe Sun formed on the neutron (n) rich SN core. The ground-state masses of\nnuclei reveal repulsive n-n interactions that trigger n-emission and a series\nof nuclear reactions that generate solar luminosity, the solar wind, and the\nmeasured flux of solar neutrinos. The location of the Sun's high-density core\nshifts relative to the solar surface as gravitational forces exerted by the\nmajor planets cause the Sun to experience abrupt acceleration and deceleration,\nlike a yoyo on a string, in its orbit about the ever-changing centre-of-mass of\nthe solar system. Solar cycles (surface magnetic activity, solar eruptions, and\nsunspots) and major climate changes arise from changes in the depth of the\nenergetic SN core remnant in the interior of the Sun.\n","Comment: Fingerprints of the supernova that gave birth to the Solar System are\n  shown in 38 pages, 14 figures, 89 references.

The United Nation Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\nassumed that solar influence on our climate is limited to changes in solar\nirradiance and adopted the consensus opinion of a Hydrogen-filled Sun, the\nStandard Solar Model (SSM). They did not consider the alternative solar model\nand instead adopted another consensus opinion: Anthropogenic greenhouse gases\nplay a dominant role in climate change. The SSM fails to explain the solar\nwind, solar cycles, and the empirical link of solar surface activity with Earth\nchanging climate. The alternative solar model, that was molded from an\nembarrassingly large number of unexpected observations revealed by space-age\nmeasurements since 1959, explains not only these puzzles but also how closely\nlinked interactions between the Sun and its planets and other celestial bodies\ninduce turbulent cycles of secondary solar characteristics that significantly\naffect Earth climate.\n","Comment: The way that the Sun controls Earth's climate is explained in 15\n  pages, 7 figures, and 56 references"]}]
