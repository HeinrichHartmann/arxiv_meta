In this regard, we consider different\nconnectivity parameters called {\\it minimum normalized cuts}/{\\it isoperimteric\nnumbers} defined through taking minimum of the maximum or the mean of the\nnormalized outgoing flows from a set of subdomains of vertices, where these\nsubdomains constitute a {\\it partition}/{\\it subpartition}. Following the main\nresult of [A. Daneshgar, {\\it et. al.}, {\\it On the isoperimetric spectrum of\ngraphs and its approximations}, JCTB, (2010)], it is known that the\nisoperimetric number and the minimum normalized cut both can be described as\n$\\{0,1\\}$-optimization programs, where the latter one does {\\it not} admit a\nrelaxation to the reals. We show that the decision problem for the case of\ntaking $k$-partitions and the maximum (called the max normalized cut problem\n{\\rm NCP}$^M$) as well as the other two decision problems for the mean version\n(referred to as {\\rm IPP}$^m$ and {\\rm NCP}$^m$) are $NP$-complete problems. On\nthe other hand, we show that the decision problem for the case of taking\n$k$-subpartitions and the maximum (called the max isoperimetric problem {\\rm\nIPP}$^M$) can be solved in {\\it linear time} for any weighted tree and any $k\n\\geq 2$. Based on this fact, we provide polynomial time $O(k)$-approximation\nalgorithms for all different versions of $k$th isoperimetric numbers\nconsidered. Moreover, when the number of partitions/subpartitions, $k$, is a\nfixed constant, as an extension of a result of B. Mohar (1989) for the case\n$k=2$ (usually referred to as the Cheeger constant), we prove that max and mean\nisoperimetric numbers of weighted trees as well as their max normalized cut can\nbe computed in polynomial time. We also prove some hardness results for the\ncase of simple unweighted graphs and trees.\n"]}]
