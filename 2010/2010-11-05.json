This result is based on additional MOST\n(Microvariability & Oscillations of STars) observations in 2004 and 2005, to\ncomplement the 2003 observations discussed in Paper I. Using StarSpotz, a\nprogram developed specifically to analyze MOST photometry, we have solved for\nk, the differential rotation coefficient, and P_{EQ}, the equatorial rotation\nperiod using the light curves from all three years. The spots range in latitude\nfrom 10 to 75 degrees and k = 0.090^{+0.006}_{-0.005} -- less than the solar\nvalue but consistent with the younger age of the star. k is also well\nconstrained by the independent spectroscopic estimate of vsini. We demonstrate\nindependently that the pattern of differential rotation with latitude in fact\nconforms to solar.\n  Details are given of the parallel tempering formalism used in finding the\nmost robust solution which gives P_{EQ} = 8.77^{+0.03}_{-0.04} days -- smaller\nthan that usually adopted, implying an age < 750 My. Our values of P_{EQ} and k\ncan explain the range of rotation periods determined by others by spots or\nactivity at a variety of latitudes. Historically, Ca II activity seems to occur\nconsistently between latitudes 50 and 60 degrees which might indicate a\npermanent magnetic feature. Knowledge of k and P_{EQ} are key to understanding\nthe dynamo mechanism and rotation structure in the convective zone as well\nassessing age for solar-type stars.

Substructure typically leads to an increase in the degree of\nclumpiness of the tidal debris in sky projection, and in some cases a more\ncompact distribution in line-of-sight velocity.

First, we observe the well-established correlation\nbetween iron depletion and <n_H> and also find trends between iron depletion\nand other line of sight parameters (e.g. f(H_2), E_(B-V), and A_V), and examine\nthe significance of these trends. Of note, a few of our lines of sight probe\nlarger densities than previously explored and we do not see significantly\nenhanced depletion effects. Second, we present two detections of an extremely\nweak Fe II line at 1901.773 A in the archival STIS spectra of two lines of\nsight (HD 24534 and HD 93222). We compare these detections to the column\ndensities derived through FUSE spectra and comment on the line's f-value and\nutility for future studies of Fe II. Lastly, we present strong anecdotal\nevidence that the Fe II f-values derived empirically through FUSE data are more\naccurate than previous values that have been theoretically calculated, with the\nprobable exception of f_1112.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ, 669, 378; see ApJ version for small\n  updates. 53 total pages (preprint format), 7 tables, 11 figures"]}]

We find that the occurrence of eruption (or\nconfinement) is sensitive to the displacement of the location of the energy\nrelease, defined as the distance between the flare site and the flux-weighted\nmagnetic center of the source active region. The displacement is 6 - 17 Mm for\nconfined events but as large as 22 - 37 Mm for eruptive events. This means that\nconfined events occur closer to the magnetic center, while the eruptive events\ntend to occur close to the edge of active regions.

In this context it is important to study supersymmetric\nlarge-N gauge theories in the strongly coupled regime. I will summarize the\nresults and insights obtained so far by non-lattice simulations. A simple\nexample of the gauge-gravity duality is the one between 1d U(N) gauge theory\nwith 16 supercharges and the so-called black 0-brane solution in type IIA\nsupergravity. In order for this duality to be valid, one has to take the 't\nHooft large-N limit and to take the strong coupling limit on the gauge theory\nside. The gauge theory can be regularized by fixing the gauge completely thanks\nto one dimension, and by introducing a Fourier mode cutoff. One can then use\nthe standard RHMC algorithm to simulate the system. The energy calculated as a\nfunction of the temperature was compared with the results obtained from the\ngravity side based on the black hole thermodynamics. This confirmed the\ngauge-gravity duality with high accuracy and provided the microscopic origin of\nthe black hole thermodynamics. From the calculation of the Wilson loop, one\nobtains the Schwarzschild radius of the dual geometry. One can actually use the\npresent 1d model with supersymmetric mass deformation to study \\mathcal{N}=4\nsuper Yang-Mills theory on R \\times S^3 based on a novel large-N reduction,\nwhich generalizes the original idea of Eguchi and Kawai. It is remarkable that\nwe can now simulate the 4d superconformal field theory, which appears in the\nmost typical case of the gauge-gravity duality known as the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence.

In\nnon-premixed flows the beta distribution has been a convenient choice to\nrepresent the mixture fraction in binary mixtures or a progress variable in\ncombustion. Here the beta-pdf approach is extended to variable-density mixing:\nmixing between materials that have very large density differences and thus the\nscalar fields are active. As a consequence, new mixing phenomena arise due to\n1) cubic non-linearities in the Navier-Stokes equation, 2) additional\nnon-linearities in the molecular diffusion terms and 3) the appearance of the\nspecific volume as a dynamical variable. The assumed beta-pdf approach is\nextended to transported pdf methods by giving the associated stochastic\ndifferential equation (SDE). The beta distribution is shown to be a realizable,\nconsistent and sufficiently general representation of the marginal pdf of the\nfluid density, an active scalar, in non-premixed variable-density turbulent\nmixing. The moment equations derived from mass conservation are compared to the\nmoment equations derived from the governing SDE. This yields a series of\nrelations between the non-stationary coefficients of the SDE and the mixing\nphysics. Our treatment of this problem is general: the mixing is mathematically\nrepresented by the divergence of the velocity field which can only be specified\nonce the problem is defined.

To demonstrate this, we introduce a new simple point charge model\nfor liquid water, q-TIP4P/F, in which the O--H stretches are described by\nMorse-type functions. We have parameterized this model to give the correct\nliquid structure, diffusion coefficient, and infra-red absorption frequencies\nin quantum (path integral-based) simulations.

This effect is much smaller than that\nobserved in all previous simulations of simple empirical water models, which\nhave found a quantum effect of at least 1.4 regardless of the quantum\nsimulation method or the water model employed. The small quantum effect in our\nmodel is a result of two competing phenomena. Intermolecular zero point energy\nand tunneling effects destabilize the hydrogen bonding network, leading to a\nless viscous liquid with a larger diffusion coefficient.

However,\nsingle forces cannot be accurately determined as they are very sensitive to\nuncertainties in the velocity model. Constrained inversions for a crack, a pipe\nor an explosion then allow us to accurately determine the structural\norientations of the source mechanisms.

The evolution of the\nphotospheric magnetic field is described and used to estimate how much flux is\nreconnected into the flux rope. About one third of the active region flux\ncancels at the internal polarity inversion line in the 2.5~days leading up to\nthe eruption. In this period, the coronal structure evolves from a weakly to a\nhighly sheared arcade and then to a sigmoid that crosses the inversion line in\nthe inverse direction. These properties suggest that a flux rope has formed\nprior to the eruption. The amount of cancellation implies that up to 60% of the\nactive region flux could be in the body of the flux rope. We point out that\nonly part of the cancellation contributes to the flux in the rope if the arcade\nis only weakly sheared, as in the first part of the evolution. This reduces the\nestimated flux in the rope to $\\sim\\!30%$ or less of the active region flux. We\nsuggest that the remaining discrepancy between our estimate and the limiting\nvalue of $\\sim\\!10%$ of the active region flux, obtained previously by the flux\nrope insertion method, results from the incomplete coherence of the flux rope,\ndue to nonuniform cancellation along the polarity inversion line. A hot linear\nfeature is observed in the active region which rises as part of the eruption\nand then likely traces out field lines close to the axis of the flux rope. The\nflux cancellation and changing magnetic connections at one end of this feature\nsuggest that the flux rope reaches coherence by reconnection shortly before and\nearly in the impulsive phase of the associated flare.

Up to now, in calculation of\nthe turbulent dynamo, it has been customary to assume that there is no back\nreaction of the magnetic field on the turbulence, as long as the magnetic\nenergy is less than the turbulent kinetic energy. This assumption leads to the\nkinematic dynamo theory. However, the applicability of this theory to\nprotogalaxies is rather limited. The reason is that in protogalaxies the\ntemperature is very high, and the viscosity is dominated by magnetized ions. As\nthe magnetic field strength grows in time, the ion cyclotron time becomes\nshorter than the ion collision time, and the plasma becomes strongly\nmagnetized. As a result, the ion viscosity becomes the Braginskii viscosity.\nThus, in protogalaxies the back reaction sets in much earlier, at field\nstrengths much lower than those which correspond to field-turbulence energy\nequipartition, and the turbulent dynamo becomes what we call the magnetized\nturbulent dynamo. In this paper we lay the theoretical groundwork for the\nmagnetized turbulent dynamo. In particular, we predict that the magnetic energy\ngrowth rate in the magnetized dynamo theory is up to ten time larger than that\nin the kinematic dynamo theory.

This line of research entered a qualitatively new\nphase recently, wherein the space-time structure (at least for some quantities)\ncan be directly observed in configurations dominating the QCD path integral,\ni.e. without any subjective processing of typical configurations. This approach\nto QCD vacuum structure does not rely on any proposed picture of QCD vacuum but\nrather attempts to characterize this structure in a model-independent manner,\nso that a coherent physical picture of the vacuum can emerge when such unbiased\nnumerical information accumulates to a sufficient degree. An important part of\nthis program is to develop a set of suitable quantitative characteristics\ndescribing the space-time structure in a meaningful and physically relevant\nmanner. One of the basic pertinent issues here is whether QCD vacuum dynamics\ncan be understood in terms of localized vacuum objects, or whether such objects\nbehave as inherently global entities. The first direct studies of vacuum\nstructure strongly support the latter. In this paper, we develop a formal\nframework which allows to answer this question in a quantitative manner. We\ndiscuss in detail how to apply this approach to Dirac eigenmodes and to basic\nscalar and pseudoscalar composites of gauge fields (action density and\ntopological charge density).

Focusing on the ground state wave function before the\ntransformation, we calculate the density matrix \\rho_0(\\theta) and find that\nits traces {\\rm Tr}(\\rho_{0}(\\theta)) and {\\rm Tr}(\\rho_0^2(\\theta)) are not\naffected by the non-commutativity. Evaluating the Wigner function on\n\\RR^2_{\\theta} confirms this. The uncertainty relation is explicitly determined\nand found to depend on \\theta. For small values of \\theta, the relation is\nshifted by a \\theta^2 term, which can be interpreted as a quantum correction.\nThe calculated entropy does not change with respect to the normal case. We\nconsider the limits \\alpha=1 and \\alpha={\\pi\\over 2}. In first case, by\nidentifying \\theta to the squared magnetic length, one can recover basic\nfeatures of the Hall system.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 1 figure"]}]

We propose a systematic new way to introduce NC geometry\ninto commutative systems, based mainly on the symplectic approach. Further, as\nexample, this formalism describes precisely how to obtain a Lagrangian\ndescription for the NC version of some systems reproducing well known theories.\n","Comment: 6 pages, Revtex4.

We also discuss\nthe stability and structure of the effective vacuum state of the approximation.\n","Comment: 41 Pages, 1 Figure, pdf-format"]}]
