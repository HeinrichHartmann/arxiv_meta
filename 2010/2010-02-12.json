This notion doesnt\nhold in wireless parts of the network. Wireless links are highly unreliable and\nthey lose segments all the time due to a number of factors. Very few papers are\navailable which uses TCP for MANET. In this paper, an attempt have been made to\njustify the use of TCP variants (Tahoe and Reno) for loss of packet due to\nrandom noise introduces in the MANET. For the present analysis the simulation\nhas been carried out for TCP variants (Tahoe and Reno) by introduces 0, 10, 20\nand 30 percent noise. The comparison of TCP variants is made by running\nsimulation for 0, 10, 20 and 30 percent of data packet loss due to noise in the\ntransmission link and the effect of throughput and congestion window has been\nexamined. During the simulation we have observed that throughput has been\ndecreased when a drop of multiple segments happens, further we have observed in\nthe case of TCP variant (Reno) throughput is better at 1 percent (Figure 5)\nwhich implies a network with short burst of error and low BER, causing only one\nsegment to be lost. When multiple segments are lost due to error prone nature\nof link, Tahoe perform better than Reno (Figure 13), that gives a significant\nsaving of time (64.28 percent) in comparison with Reno (Table 4).

This fact requires researches on new hiding methods and\ncover objects which hidden information is embedded in. It is the result from\nthe researches to embed information in executable files, but when will use the\nexecutable file for cover they have many challenges must be taken into\nconsideration which is any changes made to the file will be firstly detected by\nuntie viruses, secondly the functionality of the file is not still functioning.\nIn this paper, a new information hiding system is presented. The aim of the\nproposed system is to hide information (data file) within image page of\nexecution file (EXEfile) to make sure changes made to the file will not be\ndetected by universe and the functionality of the exe.file is still functioning\nafter hiding process. Meanwhile, since the cover file might be used to identify\nhiding information, the proposed system considers overcoming this dilemma by\nusing the execution file as a cover file.\n","Comment: IEEE format, International Journal of Computer Science and\n  Information Security, IJCSIS January 2010, ISSN 1947 5500,\n  http://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/"]}]

The key idea is to interconnect various\ncomputation modules (IP cores) in a network fashion and transport packets\nsimultaneously across them, thereby gaining performance. In addition to\nimproving performance by having multiple packets in flight, NoCs also present a\nhost of other advantages including scalability, power efficiency, and component\nreuse through modular design. This work focuses on design and development of\nhigh performance communication architectures for FPGAs using NoCs Once\ncompletely developed, the above methodology could be used to augment the\ncurrent FPGA design flow for implementing multicore SoC applications. We design\nand implement an NoC framework for FPGAs, MultiClock OnChip Network for\nReconfigurable Systems (MoCReS). We propose a novel microarchitecture for a\nhybrid two layer router that supports both packetswitched communications,\nacross its local and directional ports, as well as, time multiplexed\ncircuitswitched communications among the multiple IP cores directly connected\nto it. Results from place and route VHDL models of the advanced router\narchitecture show an average improvement of 20.4 percent in NoC bandwidth\n(maximum of 24 percent compared to a traditional NoC). We parameterize the\nhybrid router model over the number of ports, channel width and bRAM depth and\ndevelop a library of network components (MoClib Library).

It has been showed by X. Dai, D. R. Larson, and D. M. Speegle in\n[11] that for any $d\\times d$ real-valued expansive matrix M, a homogeneous\northonormal M-wavelet basis can be generated by a single wavelet function. On\nthe other hand, it has been demonstrated in [21] that nonhomogeneous wavelet\nsystems, though much less studied in the literature, play a fundamental role in\nwavelet analysis and naturally link many aspects of wavelet analysis together.\nIn this paper, we are interested in nonhomogeneous wavelet systems in high\ndimensions with a minimum number of generators. As we shall see in this paper,\na nonhomogeneous wavelet system naturally leads to a homogeneous wavelet system\nwith almost all properties preserved. We also show that a nonredundant\nnonhomogeneous wavelet system is naturally connected to refinable structures\nand has a fixed number of wavelet generators. Consequently, it is often\nimpossible for a nonhomogeneous orthonormal wavelet basis to have a single\nwavelet generator. However, for redundant nonhomogeneous wavelet systems, we\nshow that for any $d\\times d$ real-valued expansive matrix M, we can always\nconstruct a nonhomogeneous smooth tight M-wavelet frame in $L_2(R^d)$ with a\nsingle wavelet generator whose Fourier transform is a compactly supported\n$C^\\infty$ function. Moreover, such nonhomogeneous tight wavelet frames are\nassociated with filter banks and can be modified to achieve directionality in\nhigh dimensions. Our analysis of nonhomogeneous wavelet systems employs a\nnotion of frequency-based nonhomogeneous wavelet systems in the distribution\nspace. Such a notion allows us to separate the perfect reconstruction property\nof a wavelet system from its stability in function spaces.\n"]}]
