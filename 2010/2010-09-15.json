We use a one-dimensional energy\nbalance climate model (EBM) to examine how obliquity, spin rate, orbital\neccentricity, and ocean coverage might influence the onset of such a snowball\nstate. For an exoplanet, these parameters may be strikingly different from the\nvalues observed for Earth. Since, for constant semimajor axis, the annual mean\nstellar irradiation scales with (1-e^2)^(-1/2), one might expect the greatest\nhabitable semimajor axis (for fixed atmospheric composition) to scale as\n(1-e^2)^(-1/4). We find that this standard ansatz provides a reasonable lower\nbound on the outer boundary of the habitable zone, but the influence of\nobliquity and ocean fraction can be profound in the context of planets on\neccentric orbits. For planets with eccentricity 0.5, our EBM suggests that the\ngreatest habitable semimajor axis can vary by more than 0.8 AU (78%!) depending\non obliquity, with higher obliquity worlds generally more stable against\nsnowball transitions. One might also expect that the long winter at an\neccentric planet's apoastron would render it more susceptible to global\nfreezing. Our models suggest that this is not a significant risk for Earth-like\nplanets around Sun-like stars since such planets are buffered by the thermal\ninertia provided by oceans covering at least 10% of their surface. Since\nplanets on eccentric orbits spend much of their year particularly far from the\nstar, such worlds might turn out to be especially good targets for direct\nobservations with missions such as TPF-Darwin. Nevertheless, the extreme\ntemperature variations achieved on highly eccentric exo-Earths raise questions\nabout the adaptability of life to marginally or transiently habitable\nconditions.\n","Comment: References added, text and figures updated, accepted by ApJ"]}]

These relations are a\ncharacteristic property of unified flavour models and can reduce the large\nnumber of free parameters related to the flavour sector of the SM. The Yukawa\ncouplings of the down-type quarks and charged leptons are affected within SUSY\nmodels by tan beta-enhanced threshold corrections. We analyse these corrections\nand give simple analytic expressions and numerical estimates for them. The\nthreshold corrections sensitively depend on the soft SUSY breaking parameters.\nEspecially, they determine if the affected Yukawa couplings are enhanced or\nsuppressed. In a first approach, we make some plausible assumptions about the\nsoft SUSY parameters. In a second, more sophisticated approach we use three\ncommon breaking schemes in which all the soft breaking parameters at the\nelectroweak scale can be calculated from only a handful of parameters. Within\nthis approach, we apply various phenomenological constraints on the\nsupersymmetric parameters and find in this way new viable Yukawa coupling\nrelations, for example y_mu/y_s = 9/2 or 6 or y_tau/y_b = 3/2 in SU(5).\nFurthermore, we study a special class of quark mass matrix textures for small\ntan beta where theta_13^u = theta_13^d = 0.

To complement the\naforementioned considerations, we give two explicit examples in an SU(5)\ncontext, one for large and one for small tan beta which implement the Yukawa\ncoupling relations mentioned before.

While there are several\nworks that emphasize the effect of social influence in understanding fashion\ntrends, in this paper we show how boredom plays a strong role in both\nindividual and social choices. We show how boredom can be used to explain the\ncyclic choices in several scenarios such as an individual who has to pick a\nrestaurant to visit every day, or a society that has to repeatedly `vote' on a\nsingle fashion style from a collection. We formally show that a society that\nvotes for a single fashion style can be viewed as a single individual cycling\nthrough different choices.\n  In our model, the utility of an item gets discounted by the amount of boredom\nthat has accumulated over the past; this boredom increases with every use of\nthe item and decays exponentially when not used. We address the problem of\noptimally choosing items for usage, so as to maximize over-all satisfaction,\ni.e., composite utility, over a period of time. First we show that the simple\ngreedy heuristic of always choosing the item with the maximum current composite\nutility can be arbitrarily worse than the optimal. Second, we prove that even\nwith just a single individual, determining the optimal strategy for choosing\nitems is NP-hard.

We propose two consistent and\ncomputationally efficient algorithms for learning minimal latent trees, that\nis, trees without any redundant hidden nodes. Unlike many existing methods, the\nobserved nodes (or variables) are not constrained to be leaf nodes. Our first\nalgorithm, recursive grouping, builds the latent tree recursively by\nidentifying sibling groups using so-called information distances. One of the\nmain contributions of this work is our second algorithm, which we refer to as\nCLGrouping. CLGrouping starts with a pre-processing procedure in which a tree\nover the observed variables is constructed. This global step groups the\nobserved nodes that are likely to be close to each other in the true latent\ntree, thereby guiding subsequent recursive grouping (or equivalent procedures)\non much smaller subsets of variables. This results in more accurate and\nefficient learning of latent trees. We also present regularized versions of our\nalgorithms that learn latent tree approximations of arbitrary distributions. We\ncompare the proposed algorithms to other methods by performing extensive\nnumerical experiments on various latent tree graphical models such as hidden\nMarkov models and star graphs.

These graphs have important\napplications in communication network theory, allowing the construction of\nsuperconcentrators and nonblocking networks, coding theory and cryptography. As\nmany of these applications depend on the size of the largest non-trivial\npositive and negative eigenvalues, it is natural to investigate their\ndistributions. We show these are well-modeled by the beta=1 Tracy-Widom\ndistribution for several families. If the observed growth rates of the mean and\nstandard deviation as a function of the number of vertices holds in the limit,\nthen in the limit approximately 52% of d-regular graphs from bipartite families\nshould be Ramanujan, and about 27% from non-bipartite families (assuming the\nlargest positive and negative eigenvalues are independent).\n","Comment: 23 pages, version 2 (MAJOR correction: see footnote 7 on page 7: the\n  eigenvalue program unkowingly assumed the eigenvalues of the matrix were\n  symmetric, which is only true for bipartite graphs; thus the second largest\n  positive eigenvalue was returned instead of the largest non-trivial\n  eigenvalue).
