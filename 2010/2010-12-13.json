We constrain a\nmass-to-'observed' light ratio, M_h/L_band. For narrow-band surveys, L_band is\nsimply related to the intrinsic Ly-alpha luminosity with a survival fraction of\nLy-alpha photons, alpha_esc. The mass-to-'bolometric light', M_h/L_bol, can\nalso be deduced, once the metallicity and stellar mass spectrum are given. The\ninferred M_h/L_bol is more sensitive to metallicity than to the mass spectrum.\nWe find the following constraints on a mass-to-light ratio of Ly-alpha emitters\nfrom 5.7 < z < 7: (M_h/L_bol)(alpha_{esc}epsilon^{1/gamma})^{-1}=21-38, 14-26,\nand 9-17 for Z=0, 1/50, and 1 Z_sun, respectively, where epsilon is the 'duty\ncycle' of Ly-alpha emitters, and gamma ~ 2 is a local slope of the cumulative\nluminosity function. Only weak lower limits are obtained for z=8.8. Therefore,\nLy-alpha emitters are consistent with either starburst galaxies M_h/L_bol ~\n0.1-1 with a smaller Ly-alpha survival fraction, alpha_{esc}epsilon^{1/gamma}\n~0.01-0.05, or normal populations (M_h/L_bol ~ 10) if a good fraction of\nLy-alpha photons survived, alpha_{esc}epsilon^{1/gamma} ~ 0.5-1. We find no\nevidence for the end of reionization in the luminosity functions of Ly-alpha\nemitters discovered in the current Ly-alpha surveys, including recent discovery\nof one Ly-alpha emitter at z=7. The data are consistent with no evolution of\nintrinsic properties of Ly-alpha emitters or neutral fraction in the\nintergalactic medium up to z=7. No detection of sources at z=8.8 does not yield\na significant constraint yet.

The main goal of this\ncollaboration is to develop an updated and unified nuclear reaction database\nfor modeling a wide variety of stellar nucleosynthesis scenarios. Presently a\nlarge number of different reaction libraries (REACLIB) are used by the\nastrophysics community. The \"JINA Reaclib Database\" on\nhttp://www.nscl.msu.edu/\\~nero/db/ aims to merge and fit the latest\nexperimental stellar cross sections and reaction rate data of various\ncompilations, e.g. NACRE and its extension for Big Bang nucleosynthesis,\nCaughlan and Fowler, Iliadis et al., and KADoNiS. The KADoNiS (Karlsruhe\nAstrophysical Database of Nucleosynthesis in Stars,\nhttp://nuclear-astrophysics.fzk.de/kadonis) project is an online database for\nneutron capture cross sections relevant to the s process. The present version\nv0.2 is already included in a REACLIB file from Basel university\n(http://download.nucastro.org/astro/reaclib). The present status of\nexperimental stellar $(n,\\gamma)$ cross sections in KADoNiS is shown. A \"high\npriority list\" for measurements and evaluations for light charged-particle\nreactions set up by the JINA-CARINA collaboration is presented. The central web\naccess point to submit and evaluate new data is provided by the Oak Ridge group\nvia the http://www.nucastrodata.org homepage. \"Workflow tools\" aim to make the\nevaluation process transparent and allow users to follow the progress.\n","Comment: Proceedings 10th Int.

This contrasts our earlier\ntheory/data comparison where it was demonstrated that diffusive transport in\nhighly turbulent fields according to kinetic theory can successfully account\nfor both the proton distributions and upstream ramp scales, using a single\nturbulence parameter. The principal conclusion here is that, in a FLW scenario,\nthe transport of ions across the mean magnetic field is slightly less efficient\nthan is required to effectively trap energetic ions within a few Larmor radii\nof the shock layer and thereby precipitate efficient acceleration.

This motivates us to study an extended form of the\ncongestion game where a user's payoff for using a resource is a function of the\nnumber of its interfering users sharing it.

The majority of\nphages contain a double-stranded DNA genome packaged in a capsid at a density\nof ~500 mg/ml. This high density requires substantial compression of the normal\nB form helix, leading to the conjecture that DNA in mature phage virions is\nunder significant pressure, and that pressure is used to eject the DNA during\ninfection. A large number of theoretical, computer simulation and in vitro\nexperimental studies surrounding this conjecture has revealed many --- though\noften isolated and/or contradictory --- aspects of packaged DNA. This prompts\nus to present a unified view of the statistical physics and thermodynamics of\nDNA packaged in phage capsids. We argue that the DNA in a mature phage is in a\n(meta)stable state, wherein electrostatic self-repulsion is balanced by\ncurvature stress due to confinement in the capsid. We show that in addition to\nthe osmotic pressure associated with the packaged DNA and its counterions,\nthere are four different pressures within the capsid: pressure on the DNA,\nhydrostatic pressure, the pressure experienced by the capsid, and the pressure\nassociated with the chemical potential of DNA ejection. Significantly, we\nanalyze the mechanism of force transmission in the packaged DNA, and\ndemonstrate that the pressure on DNA is not important for ejection. We derive\nequations showing a strong hydrostatic pressure difference across the capsid\nshell. We propose that when a phage is triggered to eject by interaction with\nits receptor in vitro, the (thermodynamic) incentive of water molecules to\nenter the phage capsid flushes the DNA out of the capsid. In vivo, the\ndifference between the osmotic pressures in the bacterial cell cytoplasm and\nthe culture medium similarly results in a water flow that drags the DNA out of\nthe capsid and into the bacterial cell.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 6 figures, invited article to Physical Biology, to appear"]}]

Both the bound-state spectrum and the corresponding relativistic\nwavefunctions can be obtained by matrix diagonalization and related techniques.\nEmphasis is put on the construction of the light-cone Fock basis and on how to\nreduce the many-body problem to an effective Hamiltonian. The usual divergences\nare avoided by cut-offs and subsequently removed by the renormalization group.\nFor the first time, this programme is carried out within a Hamiltonian\napproach, from the beginning to the end. Starting with the QCD-Lagrangian, a\nregularized effective interaction is derived and renormalized, ending up with\nan almost solvable integral equation.Its eigenvalues yield the mass spectrum of\nphysical mesons, its eigenfunctions yield their wavefunctions including the\nhigher Fock-space components. An approximate but analytic mass formula is\nderived for all physical mesons.\n","Comment: 62 pages, 13 figures, 11 tables, 41 references, Latex2e"]}]
