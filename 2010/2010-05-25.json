This anti-correlation of matter with negative pressure\nperturbations induces a mild amplification of matter perturbations by about 10%\non sub-Hubble scales. 4. The evolution of scalar field perturbations on\nsub-Hubble scales, is scale independent and therefore it corresponds to a\nvanishing effective speed of sound (c_{s\\Phi}=0).

We then consider the system consisting of\ntwo orbiting charges with magnetic dipole moment and spin at a level of\napproximation corresponding to 1.5 post-Newtonian order.

We found that in general, the GGA\nresults are closer to the experimental values than those of the local spin\ndensity approximation. The calculated formation enthalpy data indicate the\nimportance of a systematic study on the ternary Fe-C-$X$ systems rather than\nthe binary Fe-$X$ systems, in steel design. The lattice parameters are\noptimized and the conditions for spin polarization at the impurity sites are\ndiscussed in terms of the local Stoner model. Our calculations, which are\nconsistent with previous work, imply that the local spin-polarizations at Sc,\nTi, V, Cu, and Zn are induced by the host Fe atoms. The early transition-metal\natoms couple antiferromagnetically, while the late transition-metal atoms\ncouple ferromagnetically, to the host Fe atoms. The calculated total\nmagnetization ($M$) of bcc Fe is reduced by impurity elements from Sc to Cr as\na result of the antiferromagnetic interaction, with the opposite effect for\nsolutes which couple ferromagnetically. The changes in $M$ are attributed to\nnearest neighbor interactions, mostly between the impurity and host atoms. The\natom averaged magnetic moment is shown to follow generally the well-known\nSlater-Pauling curve, but our results do not follow the linearity of the\nSlater-Pauling curve. We attribute this discrepancy to the weak ferromagnetic\nnature of bcc Fe. The calculated Fermi contact hyperfine fields follow the\ntrend of the local magnetic moments.

We propose a simple technique for\nconstraining this mass flux using the volume corrected number density in the\nextinction-corrected UV-optical color magnitude distribution, the stellar age\nindexes H-delta-a and D_n(4000), and a simple prescription for spectral\nevolution using a quenched star formation history. We exploit the excellent\nseparation of red and blue sequences in the NUV-r band color-magnitude diagram.\nThe final value we measure, 0.033 M_sun yr^-1 Mpc^-3, is strictly speaking an\nupper limit due to the possible contributions of bursting, composite, and\nextincted galaxies. However, it compares favorably with estimates of the\naverage mass flux that we make based on the red luminosity function evolution\nderived from the DEEPII and COMBO-17 surveys (Bell et al 2004; Faber et al.\n2005), 0.034 M_sun yr^-1 Mpc^-3. We find that the blue sequence mass has\nremained roughly constant since z=1 (mass flux 0.01 M_sun yr^-1 Mpc^-3) but the\naverage on-going star formation of 0.037$ M_sun yr^-1 Mpc^-3 over 0<z<1 is\nbalanced by mass flux off the blue sequence. We explore the nature of the\ngalaxies in the transition zone with particular attention to the frequency and\nimpact of AGNs. The AGN fraction peaks in the transition zone. We find\ncircumstantial, albeit weak evidence that the quench rates are higher in higher\nluminosity AGNs.\n","Comment: Accepted for Publication in the Special GALEX Ap. J.

The temperature of a disk component should\nvary with luminosity as $L\\propto T^4$. However, upon investigating the\nspectral evolution with multiple XMM-Newton observations, we found that the\ncool disk component failed to follow this relation with a confidence level of\n0.999964. Indeed, the luminosity decreases as the temperature increases, and\nthe luminosities at high temperatures are more than an order of magnitude less\nthan expected from the $L\\propto T^4$ extrapolation of luminosities at low\ntemperatures. This places a strong constraint against the validity of modeling\nthe X-ray spectra of NGC 1313 X-2 as emission from the accretion disk of an\nIMBH. The decrease in luminosity with increasing temperature of the soft\ncomponent follows the trend suggested by a model in which the soft emission\narises from an outflow from a stellar-mass black hole with super-Eddington\naccretion viewed along the symmetry axis. Alternatively, the spectra can be\nadequately fitted by a p-free disk model with kT=~2 keV and p=~0.5. The\nspectral evolution is consistent with the $L\\propto T^4$ relation and appears\nto be a high luminosity extension of the L-kT relation of Galactic black holes.\nThis, again, would suggest that the emission is from a super-Eddington\naccreting stellar mass black hole.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures, ApJ Letter in press; minor changes in v2 to match\n  the published version"]}]

The redshift space\ncorrelation function for the magnitude-limited SSRS2 is given by xi(s)=(s/5.85\nh-1 Mpc)^{-1.60} for separations between 2 < s < 11 h-1 Mpc, while our best\nestimate for the real space correlation function is xi(r) = (r/5.36 h-1\nMpc)^{-1.86}. Both are comparable to previous measurements using surveys of\noptical galaxies over much larger and independent volumes. By comparing the\ncorrelation function calculated in redshift and real space we find that the\nredshift distortion on intermediate scales is small. This result implies that\nthe observed redshift-space distribution of galaxies is close to that in real\nspace, and that beta = Omega^{0.6}/b < 1, where Omega is the cosmological\ndensity parameter and b is the linear biasing factor for optical galaxies. We\nalso use the SSRS2 to study the dependence of xi on the internal properties of\ngalaxies. We confirm earlier results that luminous galaxies (L>L*) are more\nclustered than sub-L* galaxies and that the luminosity segregation is\nscale-independent. We find that early types are more clustered than late types,\nbut that in the absence of rich clusters, the relative bias between early and\nlate types in real space, is not as strong as previously estimated.\nFurthermore, both morphologies present a luminosity-dependent bias, with the\nearly types showing a slightly stronger dependence on luminosity. We also find\nthat red galaxies are significantly more clustered than blue ones, with a mean\nrelative bias stronger than that seen for morphology.
