Finally, we introduce an alternative\ncavity configuration that is less sensitive to material imperfections and still\nexhibits deep subwavelength modes combined with high quality factor, even if\nconsiderable material losses are included.

In 1992, Taylor,\none of the discoverers of this source, together with his collaborators proposed\na model of a compact object in an eccentric orbit accreting from the equatorial\nwind of the Be star primary. The application of this model by Marti & Paredes\n(1995) predicts one ejection at periastron and a second more displaced ejection\nalong the orbit. The first ejection should correspond to weak radio emission,\nbecause of strong inverse Compton losses of the emitting electrons due to the\nproximity to the hot Be star, whereas the second ejection, quite displaced from\nthe star, would correspond to a strong radio outburst, that one indeed\nobserved. Corroborated along the years by numerical computations, simulations\nand gamma-ray observations, until now this two-peak model could not be proved\nin the radio band, because of the negligible emission around periastron.
