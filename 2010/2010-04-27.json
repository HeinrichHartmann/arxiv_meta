It is known that when the mean degree is below the critical value of\n2 log 2, the cutsize is zero with high probability. We study how the minimum\ncutsize increases with mean degree above this critical threshold, finding a new\nanalytical upper bound that improves considerably upon previous bounds.\nCombined with recent results on expander graphs, our bound suggests the unusual\nscenario that random graph bisection is replica symmetric up to and beyond the\ncritical threshold, with a replica symmetry breaking transition possibly taking\nplace above the threshold. An intriguing algorithmic consequence is that\nalthough the problem is NP-hard, we can find near-optimal cutsizes (whose ratio\nto the optimal value approaches 1 asymptotically) in polynomial time for\ntypical instances near the phase transition.\n","Comment: substantially revised section 2, changed figures 3, 4 and 6, made\n  minor stylistic changes and added references"]}]

Here we report on a deeper (78 ks) Chandra\nobservation and a few additional XMM-Newton observations of the Geminga PWN.\nThe new Chandra observation has shown that the axial tail, which includes up to\nthree brighter blobs, extends at least 50\" (i.e., 0.06 d_{250} pc) from the\npulsar.

The X-ray PWN is the synchrotron radiation from relativistic\nparticles of the pulsar wind; its morphology is connected with the supersonic\nmotion of Geminga. We speculate that the outer tails are either (1) a sky\nprojection of the limb-brightened boundary of a shell formed in the region of\ncontact discontinuity, where the wind bulk flow is decelerated by shear\ninstability, or (2) polar outflows from the pulsar bent by the ram pressure\nfrom the ISM.

[STOC 2010] that gives an\nefficient algorithm for learning mixtures of two Gaussians by considering a\nseries of projections down to one dimension, and applying the method of moments\nto each univariate projection. A major technical hurdle in Kalai et al. is\nshowing that one can efficiently learn univariate mixtures of two Gaussians. In\ncontrast, because pathological scenarios can arise when considering univariate\nprojections of mixtures of more than two Gaussians, the bulk of the work in\nthis paper concerns how to leverage an algorithm for learning univariate\nmixtures (of many Gaussians) to yield an efficient algorithm for learning in\nhigh dimensions. Our algorithm employs hierarchical clustering and rescaling,\ntogether with delicate methods for backtracking and recovering from failures\nthat can occur in our univariate algorithm. Finally, while the running time and\ndata requirements of our algorithm depend exponentially on the number of\nGaussians in the mixture, we prove that such a dependence is necessary.\n","Comment: 43 pages, 2 figures"]}]

A non-supersymmetric state with robust\nstability is constructed, and its exact stability is proven in a large region\nof moduli space of T^4 against all the possible decay mechanisms allowed by\ncharge conservation. Using string-string duality, the results are interpreted\nin terms of Dirichlet-branes in type IIA string theory compactified on an\norbifold limit of a K3 surface.

This problem\nis especially acute for integrated groundwater models which are implicitly\ncoupled to another model, such as surface water models, and resolve both\nmultiple scales of flow and temporal interaction terms, giving rise to linear\nsystems with variable scaling.\n  This article uses the theory of 'forward error bound estimation' to show how\nrescaling the linear system affects the correspondence between the residual\nerror in the preconditioned linear system and the solution error. Using\nexamples of linear systems from models developed using the USGS GSFLOW package\nand the California State Department of Water Resources' Integrated Water Flow\nModel (IWFM), we observe that this error bound guides the choice of a practical\nmeasure for controlling the error in rescaled linear systems.

The electronic Multistage Interconnection Networks (EMINs) and\nthe Optical Multistage Interconnection Networks (OMINs) have many similarities,\nbut there are some fundamental differences between them such as the\noptical-loss during switching and the crosstalk problem in the optical\nswitches.

Whereas\nquantization of the magnetic flux with hc/2e prevails in sufficiently thick\nloops with current free interior, the supercurrent in narrow loops is either\nhc/2e or hc/e periodic with the external magnetic flux. The periodicity depends\non the properties of the condensate state, in particular on the Doppler shift\nof the energy spectrum. For an s-wave superconductor in a loop with diameter\nlarger than the coherence length, the Doppler shift is small with respect to\nthe energy gap, and the hc/2e periodic behavior of its flux dependent\nthermodynamic properties is maintained. However, for smaller s-wave loops and,\nmore prominently, narrow d-wave loops of any diameter R, the Doppler shift has\na strong effect on the supercurrent carrying state; as a consequence, the\nfundamental flux periodicity is in fact hc/e. It is shown analytically and\nnumerically that the hc/e periodic component in the supercurrent decays only\nalgebraically as 1/R for large d-wave loops. For nodal superconductors the\ndiscrete nature of the eigenergies close to the Fermi energy has to be\nrespected in the evaluation of the Doppler shift. Furthermore, we investigate,\nwhether the Doppler shift modifies the supercurrent through Josephson junctions\nwith d-wave superconductors. For transparent junctions, the Josephson current\nbehaves similar to the persistent supercurrent in a loop. These distinct\nphysical phenomena can be compared, if the magnetic flux in units of hc/e is\nidentified with the phase variation of the order parameter divided by 4 pi.\n","Comment: 37 pages, 37 figures"]}]

Considering that usually we record the passage of particles at some\npoint in space, a common detector is described e.g. for one-dimensional systems\nas a narrow strip in phase space. We generalize this concept allowing this\nstrip to be transformed by some, possibly non-linear, canonical transformation,\nintroducing thus a canonically transformed detector. We show such detectors to\nbe useful in the context of the inverse scattering problem in situations where\nrecently discovered scattering echoes could not be seen without their help.\nMore relevant applications in quantum systems are suggested.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 15 figures.

RMT based Portfolio Theory and Portfolio\n  Selection"],"description":["  Portfolio theory is a very powerful tool in the modern investment theory. It\nis helpful in estimating risk of an investor's portfolio, which arises from our\nlack of information, uncertainty and incomplete knowledge of reality, which\nforbids a perfect prediction of future price changes. Despite of many\nadvantages this tool is not known and is not widely used among investors on\nWarsaw Stock Exchange. The main reason for abandoning this method is a high\nlevel of complexity and immense calculations. The aim of this paper is to\nintroduce an automatic decision - making system, which allows a single investor\nto use such complex methods of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). The key tool in\nMPT is an analysis of an empirical covariance matrix. This matrix, obtained\nfrom historical data is biased by such a high amount of statistical\nuncertainty, that it can be seen as random. By bringing into practice the ideas\nof Random Matrix Theory (RMT), the noise is removed or significantly reduced,\nso the future risk and return are better estimated and controlled. This\nconcepts are applied to the Warsaw Stock Exchange Simulator http://gra.onet.pl.\nThe result of the simulation is 18 % level of gains in comparison for\nrespective 10 % loss of the Warsaw Stock Exchange main index WIG.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 7 figures.
