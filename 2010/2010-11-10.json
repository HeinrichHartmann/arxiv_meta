The challenge here is computational. In a complete market, in\nwhich one security is offered for each outcome, the market institution can not\nefficiently keep track of the transaction history or calculate security prices\nwhen the outcome space is large. The natural solution is to restrict the space\nof securities to be much smaller than the outcome space in such a way that\nsecurities can be priced efficiently. Recent research has focused on searching\nfor spaces of securities that can be priced efficiently by existing mechanisms\ndesigned for complete markets. While there have been some successes, much of\nthis research has led to hardness results. In this paper, we take a drastically\ndifferent approach. We start with an arbitrary space of securities with bounded\npayoff, and establish a framework to design markets tailored to this space. We\nprove that any market satisfying a set of intuitive conditions must price\nsecurities via a convex potential function and that the space of reachable\nprices must be precisely the convex hull of the security payoffs. We then show\nhow the convex potential function can be defined in terms of an optimization\nover the convex hull of the security payoffs. The optimal solution to the\noptimization problem gives the security prices. Using this framework, we\nprovide an efficient market for predicting the landing location of an object on\na sphere. In addition, we show that we can relax our \"no-arbitrage\" condition\nto design a new efficient market maker for pair betting, which is known to be\n#P-hard to price using existing mechanisms. This relaxation also allows the\nmarket maker to charge transaction fees so that the depth of the market can be\ndynamically increased as the number of trades increases.\n"]}]

In particular, for a tensor of a particular algebraic type, the\nassociated operator will have a restricted eigenvector structure, and this can\nthen be used to determine necessary conditions for a particular algebraic type.\nWe shall present an analysis of the discriminants of the associated\ncharacteristic equation for the eigenvalues of an operator to determine the\nconditions on (the associated) curvature tensor for a given algebraic type. We\nwill describe an algorithm which enables us to completely determine the\neigenvalue structure of the curvature operator, up to degeneracies, in terms of\na set of discriminants.

In particular, we can use the\ntechniques described to study the necessary conditions in arbitrary dimensions\nfor the Weyl and Ricci curvature operators (and hence the higher dimensional\nWeyl and Ricci tensors) to be of algebraic type II or D, and create syzygies\nwhich are necessary for the special algebraic type to be fulfilled. We are\nconsequently able to determine the necessary conditions in terms of simple\nscalar polynomial curvature invariants in order for the higher dimensional Weyl\nand Ricci tensors to be of type II or D. We explicitly determine the scalar\npolynomial curvature invariants for a Weyl or Ricci tensor to be of type II or\nD in 5D.
