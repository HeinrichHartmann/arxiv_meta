This paper presents methods of sensitivity analysis to\nadjust interval estimates of treatment effect---both the point estimate and\nstandard error---obtained using multiple linear regression. Central to our\napproach is what we term benchmarking, the use of data to establish reference\npoints for speculation about omitted confounders. The method adapts to\ntreatment effects that may differ by subgroup, to scenarios involving omission\nof multiple variables, and to combinations of covariance adjustment with\npropensity score stratification. We illustrate it using data from an\ninfluential study of health outcomes of patients admitted to critical care.\n","Comment: Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/09-AOAS315 the Annals of\n  Applied Statistics (http://www.imstat.org/aoas/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)"]}]

No assumption on\nthe existence of a braided symmetry or on amenability is made. Our assumptions\nare motivated by the remark that these categories often contain non-full tensor\nC*-subcategories with conjugates and the same objects admitting an embedding\ninto the Hilbert spaces. Such an embedding defines a compact quantum group by\nWoronowicz duality. An important example is the Temperley--Lieb category\ncanonically contained in a tensor C*-category generated by a single real or\npseudoreal object of dimension bigger than 2. The associated quantum groups are\nthe universal orthogonal quantum groups of Wang and Van Daele. Our main result\nasserts that there is a full and faithful tensor functor from M to a category\nof Hilbert bimodule representations of the compact quantum group. In the\nclassical case, these bimodule representations reduce to the G-equivariant\nHermitian bundles over compact homogeneous G-spaces, with G a compact group.\nOur structural results shed light on the problem of whether there is an\nembedding functor of M into the Hilbert spaces. We show that this is related to\nthe problem of whether a classical compact Lie group can act ergodically on a\nnon-type I von Neumann algebra.

The challenge here is computational. In a complete market, in\nwhich one security is offered for each outcome, the market institution can not\nefficiently keep track of the transaction history or calculate security prices\nwhen the outcome space is large. The natural solution is to restrict the space\nof securities to be much smaller than the outcome space in such a way that\nsecurities can be priced efficiently. Recent research has focused on searching\nfor spaces of securities that can be priced efficiently by existing mechanisms\ndesigned for complete markets. While there have been some successes, much of\nthis research has led to hardness results. In this paper, we take a drastically\ndifferent approach. We start with an arbitrary space of securities with bounded\npayoff, and establish a framework to design markets tailored to this space. We\nprove that any market satisfying a set of intuitive conditions must price\nsecurities via a convex potential function and that the space of reachable\nprices must be precisely the convex hull of the security payoffs. We then show\nhow the convex potential function can be defined in terms of an optimization\nover the convex hull of the security payoffs. The optimal solution to the\noptimization problem gives the security prices. Using this framework, we\nprovide an efficient market for predicting the landing location of an object on\na sphere. In addition, we show that we can relax our \"no-arbitrage\" condition\nto design a new efficient market maker for pair betting, which is known to be\n#P-hard to price using existing mechanisms. This relaxation also allows the\nmarket maker to charge transaction fees so that the depth of the market can be\ndynamically increased as the number of trades increases.\n"]}]

We\nwill describe an algorithm which enables us to completely determine the\neigenvalue structure of the curvature operator, up to degeneracies, in terms of\na set of discriminants. We then express these conditions (discriminants) in\nterms of these polynomial curvature invariants. In particular, we can use the\ntechniques described to study the necessary conditions in arbitrary dimensions\nfor the Weyl and Ricci curvature operators (and hence the higher dimensional\nWeyl and Ricci tensors) to be of algebraic type II or D, and create syzygies\nwhich are necessary for the special algebraic type to be fulfilled. We are\nconsequently able to determine the necessary conditions in terms of simple\nscalar polynomial curvature invariants in order for the higher dimensional Weyl\nand Ricci tensors to be of type II or D. We explicitly determine the scalar\npolynomial curvature invariants for a Weyl or Ricci tensor to be of type II or\nD in 5D. A number of simple examples are presented and, in particular, we\npresent a detailed analysis of the important example of a 5D rotating black\nring.\n","Comment: 31 pages, 1 figure"]}]
