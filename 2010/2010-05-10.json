A subsurface ocean frictionally decouples the shell\nfrom the interior. This has led to proposals that a weak tidal or atmospheric\ntorque might cause the shell to rotate differentially with respect to the\nsynchronously rotating interior. As a result of centrifugal and tidal forces,\nthe ocean would assume an ellipsoidal shape with its long axis aligned toward\nthe parent planet. Any displacement of the shell away from its equilibrium\nposition would induce strains thereby increasing its elastic energy and giving\nrise to an elastic restoring torque. We compare the elastic torque with the\ntidal torque acting on Europa and the atmospheric torque acting on Titan. For\nEuropa, the tidal torque is far too weak to produce stresses that could\nfracture the ice shell, thus refuting a widely advocated idea. Instead, we\nsuggest that cracks arise from time-dependent stresses due to non-hydrostatic\ngravity anomalies from tidally driven, episodic convection in the interior. Two\nyears of Cassini RADAR observations of Titan's surface are interpreted as\nimplying an angular displacement of ~0.24 degrees relative to synchroneity.\nCompatibility of the amplitude and phase of the observed non-synchronous\nrotation with estimates of the atmospheric torque requires that Titan's shell\nbe decoupled from its interior. We find that the elastic torque balances the\natmospheric torque at an angular displacement <0.05 degrees, thus coupling the\nshell to the interior. Moreover, if Titan's surface were spinning faster than\nsynchronous, the tidal torque tending to restore synchronous rotation would\ncertainly be larger than the atmospheric torque. There must either be a problem\nwith the interpretation of the radar observations, or with our understanding of\nTitan's atmosphere and/or interior.\n","Comment: Icarus, in press"]}]

We wonder whether and which\nkinds of HYPERcomputation allow for the effective evaluation of also\ndiscontinuous f:R->R. More precisely the present work considers the following\nthree super-Turing notions of real function computability:\n  * relativized computation; specifically given oracle access to the Halting\nProblem 0' or its jump 0'';\n  * encoding real input x and/or output y=f(x) in weaker ways also related to\nthe Arithmetic Hierarchy;\n  * non-deterministic computation.\n  It turns out that any f:R->R computable in the first or second sense is still\nnecessarily continuous whereas the third type of hypercomputation does provide\nthe required power to evaluate for instance the discontinuous sign function.\n","Comment: previous version (extended abstract) has appeared in pp.562-571 of\n  \"Proc. 1st Conference on Computability in Europe\" (CiE'05), Springer LNCS\n  vol.3526"]}]

One of the main virtues of\nT-duality is that h_1-twisted K-theory of E_1 is isomorphic to h_2-twisted\nK-theory of E_2. In this paper, a new, very topological concept of T-duality is\nintroduced. We construct a classifying space for pairs as above with additional\n\"dualizing data\", with a forgetful map to the classifying space for pairs (also\nconstructed in the paper). On the first classifying space, we have an\ninvolution which corresponds to passage to the dual pair, i.e. to each pair\nwith dualizing data exists a well defined dual pair (with dualizing data). We\nshow that a pair (E,h) can be lifted to a pair with dualizing data if an only\nif h belongs to the second step of the Leray-Serre filtration of E (i.e. not\nalways), and that in general many different lifts exist, with topologically\ndifferent dual bundles.
