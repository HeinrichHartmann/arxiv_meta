Given bandwidth constraints, the goal is to minimize the\nnumber of rounds required to obtain a random walk sample. We first present a\nfast sublinear time distributed algorithm for performing random walks whose\ntime complexity is sublinear in the length of the walk. Our algorithm performs\na random walk of length $\\ell$ in $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\ell D})$ rounds (with high\nprobability) on an undirected network, where $D$ is the diameter of the\nnetwork. This improves over the previous best algorithm that ran in\n$\\tilde{O}(\\ell^{2/3}D^{1/3})$ rounds (Das Sarma et al., PODC 2009). We further\nextend our algorithms to efficiently perform $k$ independent random walks in\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{k\\ell D} + k)$ rounds. We then show that there is a\nfundamental difficulty in improving the dependence on $\\ell$ any further by\nproving a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\ell}{\\log \\ell}} + D)$ under a\ngeneral model of distributed random walk algorithms.

The sensitivity of such experiment is determined by the\ncollecting area, scattering and detection efficiency, X-ray detector\nbackground, and the modulation factor.

Usually the environment involves a relatively large\nnumber of degrees of freedom, this making the problem numerically intractable\nfrom a purely quantum-mechanical point of view. To overcome this drawback, a\nnew class of quantum trajectories is proposed. These trajectories, based on the\nsame grounds as Bohmian ones, are solely associated to the system reduced\ndensity matrix, since the evolution of the environment degrees of freedom is\nnot considered explicitly. Within this approach, environment effects come into\nplay through a time-dependent damping factor that appears in the system\nequations of motion. Apart from their evident computational advantage, this\ntype of trajectories also results very insightful to understand the system\ndecoherence. In particular, here we show the usefulness of these trajectories\nanalyzing decoherence effects in interference phenomena, taking as a working\nmodel the well-known double-slit experiment.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 3 figures"]}]

This lack of\ndifferentiability has been used as an argument to deny the general validity of\nBohmian mechanics (and other trajectory--based approaches) in providing a\ncomplete interpretation of quantum mechanics. Here, this assertion is overcome\nby means of a formal extension of Bohmian mechanics based on a limiting\napproach.
