There are\nnumerous applications for DPC, including coding for broadcast channels.\nRecently, lattice-based coding techniques have provided several designs for\nDPC. In lattice-based DPC, there are two codes - a convolutional code that\ndefines a lattice used for shaping and an error correction code used for\nchannel coding. Several specific designs have been reported in the recent\nliterature using convolutional and graph-based codes for capacity-approaching\nshaping and coding gains. In most of the reported designs, either the encoder\nworks on a joint trellis of shaping and channel codes or the decoder requires\niterations between the shaping and channel decoders. This results in high\ncomplexity of implementation. In this work, we present a lattice-based DPC\nscheme that provides good shaping and coding gains with moderate complexity at\nboth the encoder and the decoder. We use a convolutional code for sign-bit\nshaping, and a low-density parity check (LDPC) code for channel coding. The\ncrucial idea is the introduction of a one-codeword delay and careful parsing of\nthe bits at the transmitter, which enable an LDPC decoder to be run first at\nthe receiver. This provides gains without the need for iterations between the\nshaping and channel decoders. Simulation results confirm that at high rates the\nproposed DPC method performs close to capacity with moderate complexity. As an\napplication of the proposed DPC method, we show a design for superposition\ncoding that provides rates better than time-sharing over a Gaussian broadcast\nchannel.\n","Comment: 5 pages, submitted to ISIT 2010"]}]

The partial localization of the\nsingle-particle excitations results in a fractionation of the Fermi surface as\nthe strength of the exchange coupling between itinerant fermions and partially\nlocalized fermion pairs increases upon moving from the nodal to the anti-nodal\npoint. This is also the reason why, upon hole doping, bound fermion pairs\npredominantly accumulate near the anti-nodal points and ultimately condense in\nan anisotropic fashion, tracking the gap in the single particle spectrum.\n","Comment: 11 pages 5figures"]}]

The result is presented in analytical form and\napplied to the phenomenology of $t\\bar{t}$, $b\\bar{b}$ and $c\\bar{c}$ systems.\nThe use of the nonrelativistic renormalization group considerably improves the\nbehaviour of the perturbative expansion and is crucial for accurate theoretical\nanalysis. For bottomonium decays we predict $\\Gamma(\\eta_b(1S) \\to\n\\gamma\\gamma)=0.659\\pm 0.089 ({\\rm th.}) {}^{+0.019}_{-0.018} (\\delta\n\\alpha_{\\rm s})\\pm 0.015 ({\\rm exp.}) {\\rm keV}$. Our results question the\naccuracy of the existing extractions of the strong coupling constant from the\nbottomonium annihilation. As a by-product we obtain novel corrections to the\nratio of the ortho- and parapositronium decay rates: the corrections of order\n$\\alpha^4\\ln^2\\alpha$ and $\\alpha^5\\ln^3\\alpha$.\n","Comment: Appendices A.4, A.5 and B corrected"]}]
