It is a\nlikelihood-free method that relies exclusively on numerical simulations. ABC\nconsists in computing a distance between simulated and observed summary\nstatistics and weighting the simulations according to this distance. We propose\nan original extension of ABC to path-valued summary statistics, corresponding\nto the cumulated number of detections as a function of time. For a standard\ncompartmental model with Suceptible, Infectious and Recovered individuals\n(SIR), we show that the posterior distributions obtained with ABC and MCMC are\nsimilar. In a refined SIR model well-suited to the HIV contact-tracing data in\nCuba, we perform a comparison between ABC with full and binned detection times.\nFor the Cuban data, we evaluate the efficiency of the detection system and\npredict the evolution of the HIV-AIDS disease.

While\nmany efforts have been made to prove that the Lasso behaves like a variable\nselection procedure at the price of strong (though unavoidable) assumptions on\nthe geometric structure of these variables, much less attention has been paid\nto the analysis of the performance of the Lasso as a regularization algorithm.\nOur first purpose here is to provide a conceptually very simple result in this\ndirection. We shall prove that, provided that the regularization parameter is\nproperly chosen, the Lasso works almost as well as the deterministic Lasso.\nThis result does not require any assumption at all, neither on the structure of\nthe variables nor on the regression function.

This estimator is constructed as an l0-penalized estimator among\na sequence of Lasso estimators associated to a dyadic sequence of growing\ntruncated dictionaries. The selection procedure automatically chooses the best\nlevel of truncation of the dictionary so as to make the best tradeoff between\napproximation, l1-regularization and sparsity.

The oracle inequalities established for the Lasso and the selected\nLasso estimators shall enable us to derive rates of convergence on a wide class\nof functions, showing that these estimators perform at least as well as greedy\nalgorithms.

Finally, some theoretical\nresults about the performance of the Lasso for infinite uncountable\ndictionaries will be studied in the specific framework of neural networks. All\nthe oracle inequalities presented in this paper are obtained via the\napplication of a single general theorem of model selection among a collection\nof nonlinear models which is a direct consequence of the Gaussian concentration\ninequality.

Proto-stars that benefit from this accretion\nare those situated at the centre of a cluster's potential well, which is the\nfocal point of the contraction of the cluster gas. Given that most of the mass\nwhich makes up a massive star in this model comes from the cluster environment\nrather than the core, it is important to model the molecular cloud environment\naccurately. Preliminary results of a simulation which accurately treats the\nchemistry and time-dependent thermodynamics of a molecular cloud show\nquantitatively similar star formation to previous models, but allow a true\ncomparison to be made between simulation and observations. This method can also\nbe applied to cases with varying metallicities allowing star formation in\nprimordial gas to be studied. In general, these numerical studies of clustered\nstar formation yield IMFs which are compatible with the Salpeter mass function.\nThe only possible exception to this is in low density unbound regions of\nmolecular clouds which lack very low and high mass stars.\n","Comment: Conference Proceedings: UP2010, Have Observations Revealed a Variable\n  Upper End of the Initial Mass Function? 8 pages"]}]

However, it transpires from the present analysis that the Ising\nmodel might be a rather weak approximation. Indeed, the Gibbs potential (the\nformal \"Hamiltonian\") is the log of the so-called \"conditional intensity\" (the\nprobability that a neuron fires given the past of the whole network). But, in\nthe present example, this probability has an infinite memory, and the\ncorresponding process is non-Markovian (resp. the Gibbs potential has infinite\nrange). Moreover, causality implies that the conditional intensity does not\ndepend on the state of the neurons at the \\textit{same time}, ruling out the\nIsing model as a candidate for an exact characterization of spike trains\nstatistics. However, Markovian approximations can be proposed whose degree of\napproximation can be rigorously controlled.

This phenomenon has been used to\nvisualize vortices pinned in SQUIDs using low-temperature scanning electron\nmicroscopy. In this paper I develop a quantitative theory to calculate the\ndisplacement of the vortex-generated magnetic-flux distribution as a function\nof the distance of the beam spot from the vortex core.

Such flux domes have been explained as\narising from a combination of strong geometric barriers and weak bulk pinning.\nIn this paper we predict that, even in films with bulk pinning, flux domes also\noccur when vortices and antivortices are produced far from the film edges\nunderneath current-carrying wires, coils, or permanent magnets placed above the\nfilm. Vortex-antivortex pairs penetrating through the film are generated when\nthe magnetic field parallel to the surface exceeds H_{c1}+K_c, where H_{c1} is\nthe lower critical field and K_c = j_c d is the critical sheet-current density\n(the product of the bulk critical current density j_c and the film thickness\nd). The vortices and antivortices move in opposite directions to locations\nwhere they join others to create separated vortex and antivortex flux domes. We\nconsider a simple arrangement of a pair of current-carrying wires carrying\ncurrent I_0 in opposite directions and calculate the magnetic-field and\ncurrent-density distributions as a function of I_0 both in the\nbulk-pinning-free case (K_c = 0) and in the presence of bulk pinning,\ncharacterized by a field-independent critical sheet-current density (K_c > 0).\n","Comment: 15 pages, 23 figures"]}]
