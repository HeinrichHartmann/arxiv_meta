RAId_aPS features four different modes: (i) compute the total number\nof possible peptides for a given molecular mass range, (ii) generate the score\nhistogram given a MS/MS spectrum and a scoring function, (iii) reassign\nE-values for a list of candidate peptides given a MS/MS spectrum and the\nscoring functions chosen, and (iv) perform database searches using selected\nscoring functions.

This method, however, encounters its own difficulty when applied to\nthe quantum Boltzmann equation.

The unified picture of CVA and liquidity introduced by Morini &\nPrampolini 2010 has contributed to understanding this. However, there are two\nsignificant omissions for practical implementation that come from the same\nsource, i.e. positions not booked in usual position-keeping systems. The first\nomission is firm-level positions that change value upon firm default. An\nexample is Goodwill which is a line item on balance sheets and typically\nwritten down to zero on default. Another example would be firm Equity. The\nsecond omission relates to collateralized positions. When these positions are\nout of the money in future, which has a positive probability, they will require\nfunding that cannot be secured using the position itself.

Prior works focused almost exclusively on equilibrium starvation.\nIn this paper, we show that links in CSMA wireless networks are also\nsusceptible to temporal starvation. Specifically, although some links have good\nequilibrium throughputs and do not suffer from equilibrium starvation, they can\nstill have no throughput for extended periods from time to time. Given its\nimpact on quality of service, it is important to understand and characterize\ntemporal starvation. To this end, we develop a \"trap theory\" to analyze\ntemporal throughput fluctuation. The trap theory serves two functions. First,\nit allows us to derive new mathematical results that shed light on the\ntransient behavior of CSMA networks. For example, we show that the duration of\na trap, during which some links receive no throughput, is insensitive to the\ndistributions of the backoff countdown and transmission time (packet duration)\nin the CSMA protocol. Second, we can develop analytical tools for computing the\n\"degrees of starvation\" for CSMA networks to aid network design. For example,\ngiven a CSMA network, we can determine whether it suffers from starvation, and\nif so, which links will starve. Furthermore, the likelihood and durations of\ntemporal starvation can also be computed. We believe that the ability to\nidentify and characterize temporal starvation as established in this paper will\nserve as an important first step toward the design of effective remedies for\nit.\n","Comment: 27 pages"]}]

The angular distribution of\nprojectile fragments alpha in terms of transverse momentum could not be\nexplained by a straight and clean-cut collision geometry hypothesis of\nParticipant - Spectator (PS) Model. Therefore, it is assumed that projectile\nfragments alpha were produced from two separate sources that belong to the\nprojectile spectator region differing drastically in their temperatures. It has\nbeen clearly observed that the emission of projectile fragments alpha are from\ntwo different sources. The contribution of projectile fragments alpha from\ncontact layer or hot source is a few percent of the total emission of\nprojectile fragments alphas.

The basic problem is to design optimal\nlinear transceivers (or beamformers) that can maximize system throughput. The\nrecent work [1] suggests that optimal beamformers should maximize the total\ndegrees of freedom and achieve interference alignment in high SNR. In this\npaper we first consider the interference alignment problem in spatial domain\nand prove that the problem of maximizing the total degrees of freedom for a\ngiven MIMO interference channel is NP-hard. Furthermore, we show that even\nchecking the achievability of a given tuple of degrees of freedom for all\nreceivers is NP-hard when each receiver is equipped with at least three\nantennas. Interestingly, the same problem becomes polynomial time solvable when\neach transmit/receive node is equipped with no more than two antennas. Finally,\nwe propose a distributed algorithm for transmit covariance matrix design, while\nassuming each receiver uses a linear MMSE beamformer. The simulation results\nshow that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing interference\nalignment algorithms in terms of system throughput.\n"]}]
