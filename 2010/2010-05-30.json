We study another important aspect of resource allocations in CAS, namely\nfairness. We present two important notions of fairness in CAS, extended\nfairness and basic fairness. We give an algorithm that works by incorporating a\nmetric to ensure fairness in a CAS that uses the Vickrey-Clark-Groves (VCG)\nmechanism, and uses an algorithm of Sandholm to achieve optimality.\nMathematical formulations are given to represent measures of extended fairness\nand basic fairness.\n","Comment: 18 pages; AAAI Spring Symposium on Game Theoretic and Decision\n  Theoretic Agents, Stanford University, CA, March 2007"]}]

One\nsuch multi-agent system (MAS) that plays an important role in auctions is the\ncombinatorial auctioning system (CAS). We use this framework to define our\nconcept of fairness in terms of what we call as \"basic fairness\" and \"extended\nfairness\". The assumptions of quasilinear preferences and dominant strategies\nare taken into consideration while explaining fairness. We give an algorithm to\nensure fairness in a CAS using a Generalized Vickrey Auction (GVA). We use an\nalgorithm of Sandholm to achieve optimality. Basic and extended fairness are\nthen analyzed according to the dominant strategy solution concept.\n","Comment: 22 pages; extended version of arXiv:0809.2168"]}]
