This mechanism is the vibrational instability of weakly interacting\nharmonic modes. Below some frequency w_c << w_0 (where w_0 is of the order of\nDebye frequency) the instability, controlled by the anharmonicity, creates a\nnew stable universal spectrum of harmonic vibrations with a Boson peak feature\nas well as double-well potentials with a wide distribution of barrier heights.\nBoth are determined by the strength of the interaction I ~ w_c between the\noscillators. Our theory predicts in a natural way a small value for the\nimportant dimensionless parameter C ~ 10^{-4} for two-level systems in glasses.\nWe show that C ~ I^{-3} and decreases with increasing of the interaction\nstrength I.

Quantum fluctuations, deeply rooted in Heisenberg's uncertainty\nprinciple, and not thermal fluctuations, drive the system from one phase to\nanother. Typically, the relative strength of two competing terms in the\nsystem's Hamiltonian is changed across a finite critical value. A well-known\nexample is the Mott-Hubbard quantum phase transition from a superfluid to an\ninsulating phase, which has been observed for weakly interacting bosonic atomic\ngases. However, for strongly interacting quantum systems confined to\nlower-dimensional geometry a novel type of quantum phase transition may be\ninduced for which an arbitrarily weak perturbation to the Hamiltonian is\nsufficient to drive the transition. Here, for a one-dimensional (1D) quantum\ngas of bosonic caesium atoms with tunable interactions, we observe the\ncommensurate-incommensurate quantum phase transition from a superfluid\nLuttinger liquid to a Mott-insulator. For sufficiently strong interactions, the\ntransition is induced by adding an arbitrarily weak optical lattice\ncommensurate with the atomic granularity, which leads to immediate pinning of\nthe atoms. We map out the phase diagram and find that our measurements in the\nstrongly interacting regime agree well with a quantum field description based\non the exactly solvable sine-Gordon model. We trace the phase boundary all the\nway to the weakly interacting regime where we find good agreement with the\npredictions of the 1D Bose-Hubbard model.

Analyzing a\nnew sample of PCEBs we derive constraints on one of the most important\nparameters in the field of close compact binary formation, i.e. the CE\nefficiency alpha. After reconstructing the post-CE evolution and based on fits\nto stellar evolution calculations as well as a parametrized energy equation for\nCE evolution that incorporates realistic approximations of the binding energy\nparameter lambda, we determine the possible evolutionary histories of the\nobserved PCEBs. We also reconstruct CE evolution replacing the classical energy\nequation with a scaled angular momentum equation and compare the results\nobtained with both algorithms. We find that all PCEBs in our sample can be\nreconstructed with the energy equation if the internal energy of the envelope\nis included. Although most individual systems have solutions for a broad range\nof values for alpha, only for alpha=0.2-0.3 do we find simultaneous solutions\nfor all PCEBs in our sample. If we adjust alpha to this range of values, the\nvalues of the angular momentum parameter gamma cluster in a small range of\nvalues. In contrast if we fix gamma to a small range of values that allows us\nto reconstruct all our systems, the possible ranges of values for alpha remains\nbroad for individual systems. The classical parametrized energy equation seems\nto be an appropriate prescription of CE evolution and turns out to constrain\nthe outcome of the CE evolution much more than the alternative angular momentum\nequation. If there is a universal value of the CE efficiency, it should be in\nthe range of alpha=0.2-0.3.

This raises the old possibility of using high energy protons to make\nneutrons which are then absorbed by fertile uranium or thorium to make a\nfissionable material like plutonium that can be burned in a nuclear reactor.\nThe Energy Doubler/Saver being constructed at Fermilab is to be a\nsuperconducting accelerator that will produce 1000 GeV protons. The expected\nintensity of about $10^{12}$ protons per second corresponds to a beam power of\nabout 0.2 MW. The total power requirements of the Doubler will be about 20 MW\nof which the injector complex will use approximately 13 MW, and the\nrefrigeration of the superconducting magnets will use about 7 MW. Thus the beam\npower as projected is only a few orders of magnitude less than the accelerator\npower. But each 1000 GeV proton will produce about 60,000 neutrons in each\nnuclear cascade shower that is releaseq in a block of uranium, and then most of\nthese neutrons will be absorbed to produce 60,000 plutonium a toms.
