Intensive study throughout the last three\ndecades has yielded a rigorous understanding of the spectral-gap of the\ndynamics on $\\Z^2$ everywhere except at criticality.

At the static\nphase-transition for Ising, the dynamics is conjectured to undergo a critical\nslowdown: At high temperature the inverse-gap is O(1), at the critical\n$\\beta_c$ it is polynomial in the side-length and at low temperature it is\nexponential in it.
