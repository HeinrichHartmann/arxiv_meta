One such difficulty is the\ncusp/core problem. High resolution observations of the rotation curves for dark\nmatter dominated low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies imply that galactic dark\nmatter halos have a density profile with a flat central core, whereas N-body\nstructure formation simulations predict a divergent (cuspy) density profile at\nthe center. It has been proposed that this problem can be resolved by stellar\nfeedback driving turbulent gas motion that erases the initial cusp. However,\nstrong gravitational lensing prefers a cuspy density profile for galactic\nhalos. In this paper, we use the most recent high resolution observations of\nthe rotation curves of LSB galaxies to fit the core size as a function of halo\nmass, and compare the resultant lensing probability to the observational\nresults for the well defined combined sample of the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey\n(CLASS) and Jodrell Bank/Very Large Array Astrometric Survey (JVAS). The\nlensing probabilities based on such density profiles are too low to match the\nobserved lensing in CLASS/JVAS. High baryon densities in the galaxies that\ndominate the lensing statistics can reconcile this discrepancy, but only if\nthey steepen the mass profile rather than making it more shallow.

In\n\\cite{Fri03}, Friedman has shown that almost every $n$-lift of $G$ has all of\nits new eigenvalues bounded by $O(\\lambda_1^{1/2}\\rho^{1/2})$. In \\cite{LP10},\nLinial and Puder have improved this bound to $O(\\lambda_1^{1/3}\\rho^{2/3})$.\nFriedman had conjectured that this bound can actually be improved to $\\rho +\no_n(1)$ (e.g., see \\cite{Fri03,HLW06}).\n  In \\cite{LP10}, Linial and Puder have formulated two new categorizations of\nformal words, namely $\\phi$ and $\\beta$, which assign a non-negative integer or\ninfinity to each word. They have shown that for every word $w$, $\\phi(w) = 0$\niff $\\beta(w) = 0$, and $\\phi(w) = 1$ iff $\\beta(w) = 1$. They have conjectured\nthat $\\phi(w) = \\beta(w)$ for every word $w$, and have run extensive numerical\nsimulations that strongly suggest that this conjecture is true. This\nconjecture, if proven true, gives us a very promising approach to proving a\nslightly weaker version of Friedman's conjecture, namely the bound $O(\\rho)$ on\nthe new eigenvalues (see \\cite{LP10}).\n  In this paper, we make further progress towards proving this important\nconjecture by showing that $\\phi(w) = 2$ iff $\\beta(w) = 2$ for every word $w$.\n","Comment: 24 pages"]}]

Results: The sources are all somewhat extended on mas\nscales, but compact enough to be detected at both frequencies.

Besides analyzing the performance of strong\nrecovery where l_p-minimization needs to recover all the sparse vectors up to\ncertain sparsity, we also for the first time analyze the performance of\n``weak'' recovery of l_p-minimization (0<=p<1) where the aim is to recover all\nthe sparse vectors on one support with fixed sign pattern. When m/n goes to 1,\nwe provide sharp thresholds of the sparsity ratio that differentiates the\nsuccess and failure via l_p-minimization. For strong recovery, the threshold\nstrictly decreases from 0.5 to 0.239 as p increases from 0 to 1. Surprisingly,\nfor weak recovery, the threshold is 2/3 for all p in [0,1), while the threshold\nis 1 for l_1-minimization. We also explicitly demonstrate that l_p-minimization\n(p<1) can return a denser solution than l_1-minimization. For any m/n<1, we\nprovide bounds of sparsity ratio for strong recovery and weak recovery\nrespectively below which l_p-minimization succeeds with overwhelming\nprobability. Our bound of strong recovery improves on the existing bounds when\nm/n is large. Regarding the recovery threshold, l_p-minimization has a higher\nthreshold with smaller p for strong recovery; the threshold is the same for all\np for sectional recovery; and l_1-minimization can outperform l_p-minimization\nfor weak recovery. These are in contrast to traditional wisdom that\nl_p-minimization has better sparse recovery ability than l_1-minimization since\nit is closer to l_0-minimization. We provide an intuitive explanation to our\nfindings and use numerical examples to illustrate the theoretical predictions.\n"]}]

It is seen that a\nspectrum including a large peak around the HI ionization energy due to decaying\nneutrinos is too soft in the region up to the HeI edge to explain the\nrelatively small observed ratio of neutral He and H densities in Lyman-limit\nsystems if their size is of the kpc order. The recently proposed decrease of\nthe contribution from unstable neutrinos solves this problem but tends to spoil\nthe consistence between IGM and Lyman-$\\alpha$ clouds, which requires a large\nratio of fluxes for the HI and HeII ionization frequencies, unless there is a\nvery fast decline of quasars above $z = 3$. On the other hand, the addition of\nstars to quasars may produce a spectrum sufficiently hard between HI and HeI\nand thereafter soft up to HeII to allow a reasonable agreement of the\nproperties of denser absorbers with those of IGM. This model seems to favour\ncold dark matter with additional cosmological constant.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 1 figure, 1 table, accepted for publication in Astronomy &\n  Astrophysics"]}]

We reinterpret the Harada-Yamawaki\nresult obtained in a Wilsonian renormalization-group approach to hidden local\nsymmetry theory matched to QCD at near the chiral scale in terms of the\nNambu-Jona-Lasinio model and predict that the vector meson mass in medium\nshould scale $m_\\rho^\\star/m_\\rho\\sim\n(\\la\\bar{q}q\\ra^\\star/\\la\\bar{q}q\\ra)^{1/2}$ from $n=0$ up to $\\sim n=n_0$\n(where $n_0$ is nuclear matter density) and then go over to the linear scaling\n$m_\\rho^\\star/m_\\rho\\sim \\la\\bar{q}q\\ra^\\star/\\la\\bar{q}q\\ra$ up to the chiral\ntransition density $n_c$ at which the mass is to vanish (in the chiral limit)\naccording to the vector manifestation fixed point. In the regime of the linear\nscaling above $n_0$, the (vector) gauge coupling constant should fall linearly\nin $\\la\\bar{q}q\\ra^\\star$, vanishing at the critical point, with the width of\nthe vector meson becoming steeply narrower. We suggest the in-medium vector\nmeson mass, {\\em both} parametric and pole, which goes smoothly to zero with\nincreasing density, to be an order parameter for chiral symmetry restoration.\nSome issues related to recent RHIC observations are qualitatively discussed in\nthe appendices. Our main conclusion that follows from these considerations is\nthat the movement towards chiral restoration can be reliably described in\nNambu-Jona-Lasinio mean field, with constituent quarks as variables, although\nthere is probably density discontinuity following chiral restoration.\n","Comment: Contribution to the Hidenaga Yamagishi Commemorative Volume edited by\n  E.
