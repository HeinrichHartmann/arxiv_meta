In this paper we show, using a Hamiltonian\nclassical-field formalism, that temporal correlations can be used to\ncharacterize familiar properties of a finite-temperature degenerate Bose gas.\nThe temporal coherence of a Bose-Einstein condensate is limited only by the\nslow diffusion of its phase, and thus the presence of a condensate is indicated\nby a sharp feature in the temporal power spectrum of the field. We show that\nthe condensate mode can be obtained by averaging the field for a short time in\nan appropriate phase-rotating frame, and that for a wide range of temperatures,\nthe condensate obtained in this approach agrees well with that defined by the\nPenrose-Onsager criterion based on one-body (spatial) correlations. For time\nperiods long compared to the phase diffusion time, the field will average to\nzero, as we would expect from the overall U(1) symmetry of the Hamiltonian. We\nidentify the emergence of the first moment on short time scales with the\nconcept of U(1) symmetry breaking that is central to traditional mean-field\ntheories of Bose condensation.

This work presents a\nperspective of progress in the field of control over quantum phenomena, tracing\nthe evolution of theoretical concepts and experimental methods from early\ndevelopments to the most recent advances. The current experimental successes\nwould be impossible without the development of intense femtosecond laser\nsources and pulse shapers. The two most critical theoretical insights were (1)\nrealizing that ultrafast atomic and molecular dynamics can be controlled via\nmanipulation of quantum interferences and (2) understanding that optimally\nshaped ultrafast laser pulses are the most effective means for producing the\ndesired quantum interference patterns in the controlled system. Finally, these\ntheoretical and experimental advances were brought together by the crucial\nconcept of adaptive feedback control, which is a laboratory procedure employing\nmeasurement-driven, closed-loop optimization to identify the best shapes of\nfemtosecond laser control pulses for steering quantum dynamics towards the\ndesired objective. Optimization in adaptive feedback control experiments is\nguided by a learning algorithm, with stochastic methods proving to be\nespecially effective. Adaptive feedback control of quantum phenomena has found\nnumerous applications in many areas of the physical and chemical sciences, and\nthis paper reviews the extensive experiments. Other subjects discussed include\nquantum optimal control theory, quantum control landscapes, the role of\ntheoretical control designs in experimental realizations, and real-time quantum\nfeedback control.

We provide an explicit construction to represent\nan arbitrary many-body Hamilton operator in terms of a one-dimensional tensor\nnetwork, i.e. as a matrix product operator. For pairwise interactions, we show\nthat such a representation is always efficient and requires a tensor dimension\ngrowing only linearly with the number of particles. For systems obeying certain\nsymmetries or restrictions we find optimal representations with minimal tensor\ndimension. We discuss the analytic and numerical approximation of operators in\nterms of low-dimensional tensor operators. We demonstrate applications for time\nevolution and ground-state approximation, in particular for long-range\ninteraction with inhomogeneous couplings. The operator representations are also\ngeneralized to other geometries such as trees and 2D lattices, where we show\nhow to obtain and use efficient tensor network representations respecting a\ngiven geometry.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 13 figures"]}]

This trend likely follows from properties of the\nprogenitor white dwarf (WD), such as central density, that follow from\nproperties of the host stellar population. We present a statistically\nwell-controlled, systematic study utilizing a suite of multi-dimensional SNeIa\nsimulations investigating the influence of central density of the progenitor WD\non the production of Fe-group material, particularly radioactive Ni-56, which\npowers the light curve. We find that on average, as the progenitor's central\ndensity increases, production of Fe-group material does not change but\nproduction of Ni-56 decreases. We attribute this result to a higher rate of\nneutronization at higher density. The central density of the progenitor is\ndetermined by the mass of the WD and the cooling time prior to the onset of\nmass transfer from the companion, as well as the subsequent accretion heating\nand neutrino losses. The dependence of this density on cooling time, combined\nwith the result of our central density study, offers an explanation for the\nobserved age-luminosity correlation: a longer cooling time raises the central\ndensity at ignition thereby producing less Ni-56 and thus a dimmer event. While\nour ensemble of results demonstrates a significant trend, we find considerable\nvariation between realizations, indicating the necessity for averaging over an\nensemble of simulations to demonstrate a statistically significant result.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, accepted to ApJL"]}]

This modeling scheme takes into\naccount the fact that the system is composed of two time-varying compartments:\nthe extracellular medium, where Pel enzymes cleave pectin into oligomers, and\nthe bacterial cytoplasm where, after internalization, oligomers are converted\nto KDG. Using the quasi-stationary state approximations, the model consists of\nsome nonlinear differential equations for which most of the parameters could be\nestimated from the literature or from independent experiments. The few\nremaining unknown parameters were obtained by fitting the model equations\nagainst a set of Pel activity data.

The time-dependent\noccupation probabilities p_i(t) are assumed to obey the nonlinear rate\nequations tau dp_i/dt=-p_i ln p_i+ alpha(t)p_i-beta(t)e_ip_i where alpha(t) and\nbeta(t) are functionals of the p_i(t)'s that maintain invariant the mean energy\nE=sum_i e_ip_i(t) and the normalization condition 1=sum_i p_i(t). The entropy\nS(t)=-k sum_i p_i(t) ln p_i(t) is a non-decreasing function of time until the\ninitially nonzero occupation probabilities reach a Boltzmann-like canonical\ndistribution over the occupied energy eigenstates. Initially zero occupation\nprobabilities, instead, remain zero at all times. The solutions p_i(t) of the\nrate equations are unique and well-defined for arbitrary initial conditions\np_i(0) and for all times. Existence and uniqueness both forward and backward in\ntime allows the reconstruction of the primordial lowest entropy state.
