An\non-shell renormalisation scheme is worked out for the chargino-neutralino\nsector that properly takes account of imaginary parts arising from complex\nparameters and from absorptive parts of loop integrals. The genuine vertex\ncontributions to the neutralino decay amplitudes are combined with two-loop\npropagator-type corrections for the outgoing Higgs boson. In this way the\ncurrently most precise prediction for this class of processes is obtained. The\nnumerical impact of the genuine vertex corrections is studied for several\nexamples of CP-conserving and CP-violating scenarios. We find that significant\neffects on the decay widths and branching ratios are possible even in the\nCP-conserving MSSM. In the CP-violating CPX benchmark scenario the corrections\nto the decay width are found to be particularly large, namely, of order 45% for\na Higgs mass of 40 GeV. This parameter region of the CPX scenario where a very\nlight Higgs boson is unexcluded by present data is analysed in detail. We find\nthat in this parameter region, which will be difficult to cover by standard\nHiggs search channels at the LHC, the branching ratio for the decay\nchi^0_2->chi^0_1 h_1 is large.

This model can be seen as the discrete version of\nthe \\emph{Random Trip} Model including all variants of the \\emph{Random\nWay-Point} Model \\cite{L06}.\n  We derive fundamental properties and \\emph{explicit} analytical formulas for\nthe \\emph{stationary distributions} yielded by the Markov Trace Model. Such\nresults can be exploited to compute formulas and properties for concrete cases\nof the Markov Trace Model by just applying counting arguments.\n  We apply the above general results to the discrete version of the\n\\emph{Manhattan Random Way-Point} over a square of bounded size.\n  We get formulas for the total stationary distribution and for two important\n\\emph{conditional} ones: the agent spatial and destination distributions. Our\nmethod makes the analysis of complex mobile systems a feasible task.\n  As a further evidence of this important fact, we first model a complex\nvehicular-mobile system over a set of crossing streets. Several concrete issues\nare implemented such as parking zones, traffic lights, and variable vehicle\nspeeds. By using a \\emph{modular} version of the Markov Trace Model, we get\nexplicit formulas for the stationary distributions yielded by this\nvehicular-mobile model as well.\n","Comment: 34 pages, 4 figures, submitted paper"]}]

This formalism, which includes a set of Grassmann parameters\ndefined as the BRS variations of the gauge-fixing parameters, allows us to\nderive in a quick and unambiguous way the related Nielsen identities, which\nexpress the physical gauge independence, in a class of generalized 't Hooft\ngauges, of the effective potential. We show in particular that the validity of\nthe Nielsen identities does not require any constraint on the gauge-fixing\nparameters, to the contrary of some claims found in the literature. We use the\nmethod of algebraic renormalization, which leads to results independent of the\nparticular renormalization scheme used.\n","Comment: 13 pages, no figures, Latex, final version published in NPB"]}]
