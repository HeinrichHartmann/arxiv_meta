Therefore we are\nin the position to invoke modern methods of operator algebras, e.g. topological\nstable rank of Banach algebras, to exploit the deeper properties of Gabor\nframes. Furthermore we are able to extend results due to Connes and Rieffel on\nprojective modules over noncommutative tori to Banach algebras, which arise in\na natural manner in Gabor analysis. The main goal of this investigation is\ntwofold: (i) an interpretation of projective modules over noncommutative tori\nin terms of Gabor analysis and (ii) that the Morita-Rieffel equivalence between\nnoncommutative tori is the natural framework for the duality theory of Gabor\nframes. More concretely, we interpret generators of projective modules over\nnoncommutative tori as the Gabor atoms of multi-window Gabor frames for\nmodulation spaces. Moreover, we show that this implies the {\\it existence} of\ngood multi-window Gabor frames for modulation spaces with Gabor atoms in\nFeichtinger's algebra and in Schwartz space.\n","Comment: Many minor changes in the presentation and several typos fixed,\n  Theorem 2.5 and Theorem 4.2. are extended to the higher-dimensional case"]}]

Oancea, the same authors have\nrecently computed the Rabinowitz-Floer homology of the cotangent disk bundle\nD^*M of a closed manifold M, by establishing a long exact sequence. The first\naim of this paper is to present a chain level construction of this exact\nsequence. In fact, we show that this sequence is the long homology sequence\ninduced by a short exact sequence of chain complexes, which involves the Morse\nchain complex and the Morse differential complex of the energy functional for\nclosed geodesics on M. These chain maps are defined by considering spaces of\nsolutions of the Rabinowitz-Floer equation on half-cylinders, with suitable\nboundary conditions which couple them with the negative gradient flow of the\ngeodesic energy functional. The second aim is to generalize this construction\nto the case of a fiberwise uniformly convex compact subset W of T^*M whose\ninterior part contains a Lagrangian graph. Equivalently, W is the energy\nsublevel associated to an arbitrary Tonelli Lagrangian L on TM and to any\nenergy level which is larger than the strict Mane' critical value of L. In this\ncase, the energy functional for closed geodesics is replaced by the free period\nLagrangian action functional associated to a suitable calibration of L.

Early sensors were solid-state\ndetector (SSD) telescopes, with conical fields of view, often swept through a\ncircle by virtue of the spin motion of the spacecraft (e.g., IMP 7 and 8, ISEE\n1 and 2). In the 1980s and 1990s, foil/microchannel plate (MCP) time-of-flight\n(TOF) measurements were added to the energy measurement provided by the SSD\n(eg, AMPTE/CCE MEPA, Geotail EPIC/ICS, Galileo EPD). The resulting energy and\nvelocity uniquely identified ion mass. More recently, we have developed a 2-D\nfan acceptance angle sensor that includes both energy and TOF. When mounted on\na spinning spacecraft, this 160^\\circ x 12^\\circ FOV sweeps out nearly 4\\pi\nsteradians in one spin.

His philosophy was\na variety of Platonism, in which Pauli's affiliation with Carl Jung formed an\nintegral part, but Pauli's philosophical explorations in physics appeared\nbefore he met Jung. Jung validated Pauli's psycho-philosophical perspective.\nThus, the roots of Pauli's physics and philosophy are important in the history\nof modern physics. In his early physics, Pauli attempted to ground his\ntheoretical physics in positivism. He then began instead to trust his intuitive\nvisualizations of entities that formed an underlying reality to the sensible\nphysical world. These visualizations included holistic kernels of\nmathematical-physical entities that later became for him synonymous with Jung's\nmandalas. I have connected Pauli's visualization patterns in physics during the\nperiod 1900 to 1930 to the psychological philosophy of Jung and displayed some\nexamples of Pauli's creativity in the development of quantum mechanics. By\nlooking at Pauli's early physics and philosophy, we gain insight into Pauli's\ncontributions to quantum mechanics. His exclusion principle, his influence on\nWerner Heisenberg in the formulation of matrix mechanics, his emphasis on firm\nlogical and empirical foundations, his creativity in formulating electron\nspinors, his neutrino hypothesis, and his dialogues with other quantum\nphysicists, all point to Pauli being the dominant genius in the development of\nquantum theory. Because Pauli was in a difficult individuation process during\nhis early years, his own writings on philosophy tend to be sparse and often\ncontradictory. My analysis of Pauli's physics and philosophy is based upon\npublished and unpublished sources, and Pauli's later reflections. A pattern has\nemerged. Pauli changed his mind from relying on high rationality and\nempiricism, to valuing intuitive metaphysical visualizations. This coupled with\ndisturbing events in his life precipitated a breakdown and led Pauli to seek\ntreatment at the Jung Clinic. Pauli's psychological tension diminished after\n1932. His physics consistently involved symmetry and invariants. His philosophy\nallied with Jung's resembled a Platonism of combined psyche and physics. Pauli\nsought a rational unification and foundation for his philosophy, but that goal\nwas cut short by his untimely death at the age of 58.\n"]}]
