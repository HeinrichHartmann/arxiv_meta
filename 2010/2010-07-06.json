One of the basic\narguments supporting this point of view is the fact that vortex tangle decays\nat zero temperature, when the apparent mechanism of dissipation (mutual\nfriction) is absent. Since the all possible mechanisms of dissipation of the\nvortex energy, discussed in the literature, are related to the small scales, it\nis natural to suggest that the Kolmogorov cascade takes the place with the flow\nof the energy, just as in the classical turbulence. In a series of recent\nexperiment attenuation of vortex line density was observed and authors\nattribute this decay to the properties of the Kolmogorov turbulence. In the\npresent work we discuss alternative possibility of decay of the vortex tangle,\nwhich is not related to dissipation at small scales.

It is now known that\nparticles have internal space-time structures. Particles, such as photons and\nelectrons, have spin variables. Protons and other hadrons are regarded as bound\nstates of more fundamental particles called quarks which have their internal\nvariables. It is still one of the most outstanding problems whether these\ninternal space-time variables are transformed according to Einstein's law of\nLorentz transformations. It is noted that Wigner, Dirac, and Feynman made\nimportant contributions to this problem. By integrating their efforts, it is\nthen shown possible to construct a picture of the internal space-time symmetry\nconsistent with Einstein's Lorentz covariance.\n","Comment: Latex 15 pages, 2 figures, to be presented at the Petrov Centennial\n  Conference to be held in Kazan, Russia (November 2010)"]}]

The analysis is based on well-known\nperformance metrics, such as service ability, elapsed time, and throughput:\nfrom these metrics estimates of R(s) are derived analytically. Results.\nCritical points indicating congestion are obtained: these are limits on the\nnumber of admissible requests and the number of connected users.

When R(s) is within normal limits,\nusers should appreciate the benefits from using the services offered by their\nKB host. When bottlenecks are formed, R(s) declines, and the whole\ncommunication system heads for saturation. Flow balancing procedures are\nnecessary for the elimination of bottlenecks, which leads to a better resource\nmanagement.\n"]}]

The use of\nbasic symmetry principles (such as the cosmological principle) permits us to do\na considerable amount, without ever having to address the vexatious issues of\njust how much \"dark energy\", \"dark matter\", \"quintessence\", and/or \"phantom\nmatter\" is needed in order to satisfy the Einstein equations.
