In particular, this weak convergence holds\nunder broad conditions and even when the observations arrival rate is below the\ncritical probability for mean stability. We apply the weak-Feller property of\nthe Markov process governing the RARE to characterize the support of the\nlimiting invariant distribution as the topological closure of a countable set\nof points, which, in general, is not dense in the set of positive semi-definite\nmatrices.

However, British physicist E.\nA. Milne pointed in 1943 that the same equation could be deduced simply based\non the Newtonian theory of gravity. It means that the Friedmann equation, in\nstead of the motion equation of relativity, is actually the Newtonian one in\nessence. The reason is that two simplified conditions are used in the deduction\nof the Friedmann equation. One is the Robertson-Walker metric and another is\nstatic energy momentum tensor. It is proved that in light of the R-W metric,\nthe velocity of light emitted by celestial bodies in the expansive universe\nwould satisfy the Galileo's addition rule. So what the R-W metric describes is\nunsuitable to be taken as the space-time structure of relativity cosmology. On\nthe other hand, because there are relative velocities between observer and\nmaterial in the expensive universe actually, we should consider dynamic energy\nmomentum tensor in cosmology. The Friedmann equations need relativity revision.\nIn this way, some deductions of current cosmology, such as the values of Hubble\nconstant, dark material and dark energy densities and so on, should be\nre-estimated. The possible form of relativity metric for cosmology is proposed\nat last. It is proved strictly based on the Einstein's equation of gravity that\nthe space-time of the expansive universe can not be flat.

We are particularly interested in whether the\ndoping-induced transition between the two states is first order, or the two\npure phases are separated by an intermediate phase with coexisting SC and SDW\norders. For perfect nesting, the two orders do not coexist, because SDW order,\nwhich comes first, gaps the full Fermi surface leaving no space for SC to\ndevelop. When nesting is not perfect due to either ellipticity of electron\nbands or doping-induced difference in chemical potentials for holes and\nelectrons, SDW order still leaves modified Fermi surfaces for not too strong\nSDW magnetism and the SC order may develop.

We propose a very natural\nasymptotic notion of consistency, and show that simple consistent algorithms\nexist, under most general non-parametric assumptions. The notion of consistency\nis as follows: two samples should be put into the same cluster if and only if\nthey were generated by the same distribution. With this notion of consistency,\nclustering generalizes such classical statistical problems as homogeneity\ntesting and process classification. We show that, for the case of a known\nnumber of clusters, consistency can be achieved under the only assumption that\nthe joint distribution of the data is stationary ergodic (no parametric or\nMarkovian assumptions, no assumptions of independence, neither between nor\nwithin the samples). If the number of clusters is unknown, consistency can be\nachieved under appropriate assumptions on the mixing rates of the processes.\n(again, no parametric or independence assumptions). In both cases we give\nexamples of simple (at most quadratic in each argument) algorithms which are\nconsistent.\n","Comment: in proceedings of ICML 2010. arXiv-admin note: for version 2 of this\n  article please see: arXiv:1005.0826v1"]}]

This place was a\nsocial theater in which two kinds of collective phenomena took place:\ninterpersonal interactions (small group discussion and negotiation, etc.) and\nglobal collective phenomena, such as flowing and jamming. In this paper, we\nfocus on the second type of collective human phenomena, called non-deliberative\nemergent crowd phenomena. This is a typical case of collective emergent\nself-organization. When a great number of individuals move within a confined\nenvironment and under a common fate, collective structures appear\nspontaneously: jamming with inner collapses, organized flowing with queues,\ncurls, and vortices, propagation effects, etc. These are particularly relevant\nfeatures to enhance the realism - more precisely the \"truthfulness\" - of models\nof this kind of collective phenomena.

The evolutions are not repetitive, and evolve on the basis\nof small changes.

The rapidly growing volume of solar\nimages, however, makes it increasingly impractical to process them for\nscientific purposes. This situation has prompted the development of novel\nprocessing techniques for doing feature recognition, image tracking, knowledge\nextraction, etc. Here we focus on two particular concepts and list some of\ntheir applications. The first one is Blind Source Separation (BSS), which has a\ngreat potential for condensing the information that is contained in\nmultispectral images. The second one is multiscale (multiresolution, or\nwavelet) analysis, which is particularly well suited for capturing\nscale-invariant structures in solar images.

This change in the source of the\nempirical data allows the scientific method to be applied to several aspects of\nphysical reality that previously resisted systematic interrogation. Under the\nnew method, scientific theories are compared by instantiating them as\ncompression programs, and examining the codelengths they achieve on a database\nof measurements related to a phenomenon of interest. Because of the\nimpossibility of compressing random data, \"real world\" data can only be\ncompressed by discovering and exploiting the empirical structure it exhibits.\nThe method also provides a new way of thinking about two longstanding issues in\nthe philosophy of science: the problem of induction and the problem of\ndemarcation.\n  The second part of the paper proposes to reformulate computer vision as an\nempirical science of visual reality, by applying the new method to large\ndatabases of natural images. The immediate goal of the proposed reformulation\nis to repair the chronic difficulties in evaluation experienced by the field of\ncomputer vision. The reformulation should bring a wide range of benefits,\nincluding a substantially increased degree of methodological rigor, the ability\nto justify complex theories without overfitting, a scalable evaluation\nparadigm, and the potential to make systematic progress. A crucial argument is\nthat the change is not especially drastic, because most computer vision tasks\ncan be reformulated as specialized image compression techniques.

However, this seminal concept is still not enough to cope\nwith some effective problems: for instance, giving a bound on the maximum\nnumber of blowing--ups to be performed on a surface before its multiplicity\ndecreases. This short note shows why such a bounding is not possible, at least\nwith the original definitions.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 1 figure"]}]
