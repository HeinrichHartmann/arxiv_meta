Once such a logic is fixed, a natural next\nquestion is how we might prove theorems about specifications written in it. We\npropose to use a second logic, called a reasoning logic, for this purpose. A\nsatisfactory reasoning logic should be able to completely encode the\nspecification logic. Associated with the specification logic are various\nnotions of binding: for quantifiers within formulas, for eigenvariables within\nsequents, and for abstractions within terms. To provide a natural treatment of\nthese aspects, the reasoning logic must encode binding structures as well as\ntheir associated notions of scope, free and bound variables, and\ncapture-avoiding substitution. Further, to support arguments about provability,\nthe reasoning logic should possess strong mechanisms for constructing proofs by\ninduction and co-induction. We provide these capabilities here by using a logic\ncalled G which represents relations over lambda-terms via definitions of atomic\njudgments, contains inference rules for induction and co-induction, and\nincludes a special generic quantifier.

To test the barrier nucleosome model, we quantitatively\nanalyze yeast nucleosome positioning data both up- and downstream from NFRs.\nOur analysis is based on the Tonks model of statistical physics which\nquantifies the interplay between the excluded-volume interaction of nucleosomes\nand their positional entropy.

The inferred boundary conditions suggest that the first nucleosome\ndownstream from the NFR (the +1 nucleosome) is typically directly positioned\nwhile the first nucleosome upstream is statistically positioned via a\nnucleosome-repelling DNA region. These boundary conditions, which can be\nlocally encoded into the genome sequence, significantly shape the statistical\ndistribution of nucleosomes over a range of up to ~1000 bp to each side.\n","Comment: includes supporting material"]}]

End\nuser business intelligence tools are added on top of the materialized\nmultidimensional schemas to drive decision making in an organization.\nUnfortunately, this bottom-up approach is costly both in terms of the skilled\nusers needed and the sheer size of the warehouses. This paper proposes a\ntop-down framework in which data warehousing is driven by a conceptual model.\nThe framework offers both design time and run time environments. At design\ntime, a business user first uses the conceptual modeling language as a\nmultidimensional object model to specify what business information is needed;\nthen she maps the conceptual model to a pre-existing logical multidimensional\nrepresentation. At run time, a system will transform the user conceptual model\ntogether with the mappings into views over the logical multidimensional\nrepresentation. We focus on how the user can conceptually abstract from an\nexisting data warehouse, and on how this conceptual model can be mapped to the\nlogical multidimensional representation. We also give an indication of what\nquery language is used over the conceptual model. Finally, we argue that our\nframework is a step along the way to allowing automatic generation of the data\nwarehouse.\n","Comment: Technical report, 18 pages"]}]
