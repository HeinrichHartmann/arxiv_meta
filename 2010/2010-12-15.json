To progress in the understanding of evolution of massive stars one\nneeds to constrain the mass-loss and determine the phenomenon responsible for\nthe ejection of matter an its reorganization in the circumstellar environment\nAims. In order to test various mass-ejection processes, we probed the geometry\nand kinematics of the dust and gas surrounding the A[e] supergiant HD 62623.\nMethods. We used the combined high spectral and spatial resolution covered by\nthe VLTI/AMBER instrument.

We\nmanaged to disentangle the dust and gas emission in the HD 62623 circumstellar\ndisc.We measured the dusty disc inner inner rim, i.e. 6 mas, constrained the\ninclination angle and the position angle of the major-axis of the disc.We also\nmeasured the inner gaseous disc extension (2 mas) and probed its velocity field\nthanks to AMBER high spectral resolution. We find that the expansion velocity\nis negligible, and that Keplerian rotation is a favoured velocity field. Such a\nvelocity field is unexpected if fast rotation of the central star alone is the\nmain mechanism of matter ejection. Conclusions. As the star itself seems to\nrotate below its breakup-up velocity, rotation cannot explain the formation of\nthe dense equatorial disc. Moreover, as the expansion velocity is negligible,\nradiatively driven wind is also not a suitable explanation to explain the disc\nformation.

(i) We report a comprehensive characterization of\nIP traffic on smartphones using traces collected from 27 iPhone 3GS users for\nthree months. (ii) Driven by the findings from the characterization, we devise\ntwo novel system mechanisms for mobile devices to sup-port seamless flow\nmigration without network support, and extensively evaluate their effectiveness\nusing our field collected traces of real-life usage. Wait-n-Migrate leverages\nthe fact that most flows are short lived. It establishes new flows on newly\navailable networks but allows pre-existing flows on the old network to\nterminate naturally, effectively decreasing, or even eliminating, connectivity\ngaps during network switches. Resumption Agent takes advantage of the\nfunctionality integrated into many modern protocols to securely resume flows\nwithout application intervention. When combined, Wait-n-Migrate and Resumption\nAgent provide an unprecedented opportunity to immediately deploy performance\nand efficiency-enhancing policies that leverage multiple networks to improve\nthe performance, efficiency, and connectivity of mobile devices. (iii) Finally,\nwe report an iPhone 3GS based implementation of these two system mechanisms and\nshow that their overhead is negligible. Furthermore, we employ an example\nnetwork switching policy, called AutoSwitch, to demonstrate their performance.\nAutoSwitch improves the Wi-Fi user experience by intelligently migrating TCP\nflows between Wi-Fi and cellular networks.

Calculations using the\nthermo-acoustic conversion model, agree well with the experimental data, as\ndemonstrated by the specific variation of the excitation strengths with the\nabsorbed energy, and with the traversing particles' track positions. For the\nfirst longitudinal mode of the cylindrical resonator we measured a conversion\nfactor of 7.4 +- 1.4 nm/J, confirming the model value of 10 nm/J. Also, for the\nspherical resonator, we found the model values for the L=2 and L=1 mode\namplitudes to be consistent with our measurement. We thus have confirmed the\napplicability of the model, and we note that calculations based on the model\nhave shown that next generation resonant mass gravitational wave detectors can\nonly be expected to reach their intended ultra high sensitivity if they will be\nshielded by an appreciable amount of rock, where a veto detector can reduce the\nbackground of remaining impinging cosmic rays effectively.\n","Comment: Tex-Article with epsfile, 34 pages including 13 figures and 5 tables.\n  To be published in Rev.
