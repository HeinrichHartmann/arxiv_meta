The main role of\nthe BH-disc magnetic connection is to provide the source of energy for the jets\nwhen the mass accretion rate is very low. We assume that the jets are launched\nfrom the disc inside the BH ergosphere, where the rotational effects of the\nspace-time become much stronger, being further accelerated by magnetic\nprocesses. The rotation of the space-time channels a fraction of the disc\nenergy (i.e., the gravitational energy of the disc plus the rotational energy\nof the BH which is deposited into the disc by magnetic connection) into a\npopulation of particles that escape from the disc surfaces, carrying away mass,\nenergy and angular momentum in the form of jets, allowing the remaining disc\ngas to accrete. In the limit of the spin-down power regime, the model proposed\nhere can be regarded as a variant of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, where the\nBH rotational energy is transferred to the disc inside the ergosphere and then\nused to drive the jets.

From the opposite limit of x=0 (La end),\nthe Fermi surface broadens quickly as x increases, but stays at the same\nposition as that of the La end. With increasing magnetic field, a metamagnetic\ntransition occurs, and the Fermi surface above the critical field changes\ncontinuously across the whole range of x.

I\ndescribe observational progress towards testing these predictions by measuring\nmasses, shapes, profiles and substructure in real halos, using baryonic tracers\nor gravitational lensing. An important property of simulated halos (possibly\nthe most important property) is their dynamical 'age', or degree of internal\nrelaxation. The age of a halo may have almost as much effect as its mass in\ndetermining the state of its baryonic contents, so halo ages are also worth\ntrying to measure observationally. I review recent gravitational lensing\nstudies of galaxy clusters which should measure substructure and relaxation in\na large sample of individual cluster halos, producing quantitative measures of\nage that are well-matched to theoretical predictions.

The following\nchapter points out a problem with a divergent integral in a common approach and\nproposes an improvement. Numerical comparisons are shown that indicate that the\nimprovements allow for a superior image quality. Thereafter the problem of\nlimited data is analyzed. In a realistic SAR-measurement the data gathered from\nthe electromagnetic waves reflected from the surface can only be collected from\na limited area. However the reconstruction formula requires data from an\ninfinite distance. The chapter gives an analysis of the artifacts which can\nobscure the reconstructed images due to this problem. Additionally, some\nnumerical examples are shown that point to the severity of the problem. In\nchapter 4 the fact that data is available only from a limited area is used to\npropose a new inversion formula.

This leads to the fact that only symmetric images\ncan be obtained.

The approach is based on C-HiLasso, a\nconvex collaborative hierarchical sparse model, and proceeds as follows. First,\nwe build a structured dictionary for mixed signals by concatenating a set of\nsub-dictionaries, each one of them learned to sparsely model one of a set of\npossible classes. Then, the coding of the mixed signal is performed by\nefficiently solving a convex optimization problem that combines standard\nsparsity with group and collaborative sparsity. The present sources are\nidentified by looking at the sub-dictionaries automatically selected in the\ncoding. The collaborative filtering in C-HiLasso takes advantage of the\ntemporal/spatial redundancy in the mixed signals, letting collections of\nsamples collaborate in identifying the classes, while allowing individual\nsamples to have different internal sparse representations. This collaboration\nis critical to further stabilize the sparse representation of signals, in\nparticular the class/sub-dictionary selection. The internal sparsity inside the\nsub-dictionaries, as naturally incorporated by the hierarchical aspects of\nC-HiLasso, is critical to make the model consistent with the essence of the\nsub-dictionaries that have been trained for sparse representation of each\nindividual class.
