Polystyrene in particular has been reported to be\nstrongly affected when nanoconfined as a thin film and specifically its glass\ntransition temperature (Tg) is reported to decrease with decreasing film\nthickness. Tremendous effort has been dedicated to developing methods for\nquantifying the large-scale dynamic of nanoconfined polymers: film dewetting,\nfilm contraction, nanobubble inflation, nanoparticle imbedding and healing of\ndeformed surfaces etc. In this work we describe a novel method to study the\nlarge scale dynamic and nanomechanical properties of nanoconfined polymers in\nnanoparticles in nanoblends. Nanoblends of dPS/PBMA were prepared from a\nmixture of colloidal suspensions of cross-linked PBMA and traces of dPS\nnanoparticles via water evaporation. The polymer blends were prepared at\ntemperatures well below the glass transition of PS (TgPS) and above the Tg of\ncross-linked PBMA particles (TgPBMA). In these conditions we expect the PBMA\nparticles to deform under capillary pressure to fill the interstices between\nthem and the glassy PS nanoparticles to remain spherical. During the\npreparation of the nanoblends the elastic energy is stored within the deformed\ncross-linked PBMA nanoparticles. Upon annealing the films above TgPS, the PBMA\nnanoparticles regain their spherical shape and release the stored elastic\nenergy, which induces the deformation of the PS nanoparticles. Small angle\nneutron scattering is then used to monitor the shape evolution of the PS\nnanoparticles and to quantify the relaxation dynamics of the polystyrene\nnanoparticles.\n"]}]

In this\npaper, we propose a BitTorrent-like protocol that replaces the peer selection\nmechanisms in the regular BitTorrent protocol with a novel reinforcement\nlearning (RL) based mechanism. Due to the inherent opration of P2P systems,\nwhich involves repeated interactions among peers over a long period of time,\nthe peers can efficiently identify free-riders as well as desirable\ncollaborators by learning the behavior of their associated peers. Thus, it can\nhelp peers improve their download rates and discourage free-riding, while\nimproving fairness in the system. We model the peers' interactions in the\nBitTorrent-like network as a repeated interaction game, where we explicitly\nconsider the strategic behavior of the peers. A peer, which applies the\nRL-based mechanism, uses a partial history of the observations on associated\npeers' statistical reciprocal behaviors to determine its best responses and\nestimate the corresponding impact on its expected utility. The policy\ndetermines the peer's resource reciprocations with other peers, which would\nmaximize the peer's long-term performance, thereby making foresighted\ndecisions. We have implemented the proposed reinforcement-learning based\nmechanism and incorporated it into an existing BitTorrent client.

As\nsuch, designers currently focus on constructing surfaces that are an integral\npart of the function of the tribo-system. Inspirations for such constructs come\nfrom studying natural systems and from implementing natural design rules. One\nspecies that may serve as an analogue for design is the Ball python.

As such, studying these features and how do they\ncontribute to the control of friction and wear is very attractive for design\npurposes. In this work we apply a multi scale surface characterization approach\nto study surface design features of the Python regius that are beneficial to\ndesign high quality lubricating surfaces (such as those obtained through\nplateau honing).

Despite the significant effect that Rubisco has on\nthe fitness of plants and other photosynthetic organisms, this enzyme is known\nto have a remarkably low catalytic rate and a tendency to confuse its\nsubstrate, carbon dioxide, with oxygen. This apparent inefficiency is puzzling\nand raises questions regarding the roles of evolution versus biochemical\nconstraints in shaping Rubisco. Here we examine these questions by analyzing\nthe measured kinetic parameters of Rubisco from various organisms in various\nenvironments. The analysis presented here suggests that the evolution of\nRubisco is confined to an effectively one-dimensional landscape, which is\nmanifested in simple power law correlations between its kinetic parameters.\nWithin this one dimensional landscape, which may represent biochemical and\nstructural constraints, Rubisco appears to be tuned to the intracellular\nenvironment in which it resides such that the net photosynthesis rate is nearly\noptimal. Our analysis indicates that the specificity of Rubisco is not the main\ndeterminant of its efficiency but rather the tradeoff between the carboxylation\nvelocity and CO2 affinity. As a result, the presence of oxygen has only\nmoderate effect on the optimal performance of Rubisco, which is determined\nmostly by the local CO2 concentration. Rubisco appears as an experimentally\ntestable example for the evolution of proteins subject both to strong selection\npressure and to biochemical constraints which strongly confine the evolutionary\nplasticity to a low dimensional landscape.\n","Comment: http://www.pnas.org/content/107/8/3475.short\n  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20142476\n  http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/tlusty/papers/PNAS2010.pdf"]}]

The aggregates can then order\ninto liquid-crystal phases if the density is high enough, and liquid-crystal\nordering promotes increased growth of aggregates. Systems that display coupled\naggregation and liquid-crystal ordering include wormlike micelles, chromonic\nliquid crystals, DNA and RNA, and protein polymers and fibrils. Coarse-grained\nmolecular models that capture key features of coupled aggregation and\nliquid-crystal ordering common to many different systems are lacking; in\nparticular, the role of monomer aspect ratio and aggregate flexibility in\ncontrolling the phase behavior are not well understood. Here we study a minimal\nsystem of sticky cylinders using Monte Carlo simulations and analytic theory.\nCylindrical monomers interact primarily by hard-core interactions but can stack\nand bind end to end. We present results for several different cylinder aspect\nratios and a range of end-to-end binding energies. The phase diagrams are\nqualitatively similar to those of chromonic liquid crystals, with an\nisotropic-nematic-columnar triple point. The location of the triple point is\nsensitive to the monomer aspect ratio.We find that the aggregate persistence\nlength varies with temperature in a way that is controlled by the interaction\npotential; this suggests that the form of the interaction potential affects the\nphase behavior of the system. Our analytic theory shows improvement compared to\nprevious theory in quantitatively predicting the I-N transition for relatively\nstiff aggregates, but requires a better treatment of aggregate flexibility.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 16 figures"]}]

The yields and the $p_{T}$ spectra are presented and discussed\nin terms of chemical and thermal freeze-out conditions and compared to model\npredictions.
