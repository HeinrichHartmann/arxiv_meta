When interactions\nbetween the particles compete with their mobility through a tunnel junction,\nintriguing novel dynamical behaviour can arise where particles do not tunnel\nindependently. In single-electron or Bloch transistors, for example, the\ntunnelling of an electron or Cooper pair can be enabled or suppressed by the\npresence of a second charge carrier due to Coulomb blockade. Here we report on\nthe first direct and time-resolved observation of correlated tunnelling of two\ninteracting atoms through a barrier in a double well potential. We show that\nfor weak interactions between the atoms and dominating tunnel coupling,\nindividual atoms can tunnel independently, similar to the case in a normal\nJosephson junction. With strong repulsive interactions present, two atoms\nlocated on one side of the barrier cannot separate, but are observed to tunnel\ntogether as a pair in a second order co-tunnelling process. By recording both\nthe atom position and phase coherence over time, we fully characterize the\ntunnelling process for a single atom as well as the correlated dynamics of a\npair of atoms for weak and strong interactions. In addition, we identify a\nconditional tunnelling regime, where a single atom can only tunnel in the\npresence of a second particle, acting as a single atom switch. Our work\nconstitutes the first direct observation of second order tunnelling events with\nultracold atoms, which are the dominating dynamical effect in the strongly\ninteracting regime.

It has also\nrecently been found that electromagnetic radiative corrections in some cases\nmay boost the gamma-ray yield from supersymmetric dark matter annihilations in\nthe galactic halo by up to three or four orders of magnitude, providing\ndistinct spectral signatures for indirect dark matter searches to look for.\nHere, we investigate whether the same type of corrections can also lead to\nsizeable enhancements in the positron yield.

My method utilizes two\nexpansions: an inner expansion that keeps the size of the body fixed, and an\nouter expansion that lets the body shrink while holding its worldline fixed. By\nimposing the Lorenz gauge, I express the global solution to the Einstein\nequation in the outer expansion in terms of an integral over a worldtube of\nsmall radius surrounding the body. Appropriate boundary data on the tube are\ndetermined from a local-in-space expansion in a buffer region where both the\ninner and outer expansions are valid. This buffer-region expansion also results\nin an expression for the self-force in terms of irreducible pieces of the\nmetric perturbation on the worldline. Based on the global solution, these\npieces of the perturbation can be written in terms of a tail integral over the\nbody's past history. This approach can be applied at any order to obtain a\nself-consistent approximation that is valid on long timescales, both near and\nfar from the small body.

Precise observations of orbital\nmotion near candidate black holes have the potential to determine if they have\nthe spacetime structure that general relativity demands. As a means of\nformulating measurements to test the black hole nature of these objects,\nCollins and Hughes introduced \"bumpy black holes\": objects that are almost, but\nnot quite, general relativity's black holes. The spacetimes of these objects\nhave multipoles that deviate slightly from the black hole solution, reducing to\nblack holes when the deviation is zero. In this paper, we extend this work in\ntwo ways. First, we show how to introduce bumps which are smoother and lead to\nbetter behaved orbits than those in the original presentation. Second, we show\nhow to make bumpy Kerr black holes -- objects which reduce to the Kerr solution\nwhen the deviation goes to zero. This greatly extends the astrophysical\napplicability of bumpy black holes. Using Hamilton-Jacobi techniques, we show\nhow a spacetime's bumps are imprinted on orbital frequencies, and thus can be\ndetermined by measurements which coherently track a small orbiting body's\norbital phase. We find that weak-field orbits of bumpy black holes are modified\nexactly as expected from a Newtonian analysis of a body with a prescribed\nmultipolar structure, reproducing well-known results from the celestial\nmechanics literature. The impact of bumps on strong-field orbits is especially\nstrong, suggesting that this framework will allow observations to set robust\nlimits on the extent to which a spacetime's multipoles deviate from the black\nhole expectation.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 3 figures, accepted to Phys.

The specific role of mesons with different\nvalues for J(PC) is analyzed. We show that the pi(0) exchange amplitude and its\ninterference terms with eta(eta') and f1 exchanges dominate in the transverse\npart of the cross section sigmaT. The main role plays the pi(0) to rho(0) M1\nspin transition when coupling the virtual photons to the nucleon. In contrast,\nthe longitudinal cross section sigmaL is generated by a series of scalar meson\nexchanges. To extract the dominant term more detailed information on the inner\nstructure of scalar mesons is required. It turns out that recent data of the\nCLAS Collaboration on sigmaL and sigmaT can be described with reasonable\naccuracy if one proposes the quarkonium structure for the heavy scalar mesons\n(M > 1.3 GeV). On this basis the differential cross sections dsigmaL/dt and\ndsigmaT/dt are calculated and compared with the latest CLAS data.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 8 figures"]}]

In large spiral galaxies, the rate of transformation of H2 into\nstars (hereafter SFE) varies little. However, the SFE in distant objects (z~1)\nis much higher than in the large spiral disks that dominate the local universe.\nSome small local group galaxies share at least some of the characteristics of\nintermediate-redshift objects, such as size or color. Recent work has suggested\nthat the Star Formation Efficiency (SFE, defined as the SFRate per unit H2) in\nlocal Dwarf galaxies may be as high as in the distant objects.

Despite the much lower metallicity, we\nfind no clear difference in the properties of the GMCs in NGC 6822 and those in\nthe Milky Way except lower CO luminosities for a given mass. Several\nindependent methods indicate that the total H2 mass in NGC 6822 is about 5 x\n10^6 Msun in the area we mapped and less than 10^7 Msun in the whole galaxy.\nThis corresponds to a NH2/ICO ~ 4 x 10^{21} cm^-2 /(Kkm/s) over large scales,\nsuch as would be observed in distant objects, and half that in individual GMCs.\nNo evidence was found for H2 without CO emission. Our simulations of the\nradiative transfer in clouds are entirely compatible with these NH2/ICO values.\nThe SFE implied is a factor 5 - 10 higher than what is observed in large local\nuniverse spirals.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 13 figures.

Using numerical exact diagonalization we investigate the important\nquestion of whether this system supports a FQHE described by the non-Abelian\nMoore-Read Pfaffian state in the strong tunneling regime. In the lowest Landau\nlevel, we find that although in principle, increasing (decreasing) tunneling\nstrength (layer separation) could lead to a transition from the Abelian\ntwo-component Halperin 331 to non-Abelian one-component Moore-Read Pfaffian\nstate, the FQHE excitation gap is relatively small in the lowest Landau level\nPfaffian regime--we establish that all so far observed FQHE states in\nhalf-filled lowest Landau level bilayers are most likely described by the\nAbelian Halperin 331 state. In the second Landau level we make the prediction\nthat bilayer structures would manifest two distinct branches of incompressible\nFQHE corresponding to the Abelian 331 state (at moderate to low tunneling and\nlarge layer separation) and the non-Abelian Moore-Read Pfaffian state (at large\ntunneling and small layer separation). The observation of these two FQHE\nbranches and the possible quantum phase transition between them will be\ncompelling evidence supporting the existence of the non-Abelian Moore-Read\nPfaffian state in the second Landau level.

Properties of nuclear matter that are especially crucial are\nthe symmetry energy and the nuclear specific heat. The nuclear\nincompressibility, and the supernuclear EOS, play supporting roles. In a\nsimilar way, although the maximum masses of neutron stars are entirely\ndependent upon the supernuclear EOS, other important structural aspects are\nmore sensitive to the equation of state at nuclear densities. The radii,\nmoments of inertia, and the relative binding energies of neutron stars are, in\nparticular, sensitive to the behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy.

Emission-line contributions are\ncommonly seen in these actively star-forming regions. Models without gaseous\nemission cannot explain their observed colors at all, or lead to wrong age\nestimates. We use up-to-date Lyman continuum emission rates and decided to use\nrecent empirical determinations of emission line ratios relative to Hbeta for\nsubsolar metallicities.

We have performed about 100 simulations for\nclusters with a wide variety of initial conditions, varying systematically the\ncluster density profile, stellar IMF, and number of stars. We also considered\nthe effects of initial mass segregation and stellar evolution mass loss.

The widths are high, ranging from\n130-240 km/s, and by combining data for LBGs and DRGs we find significant\ncorrelations between linewidth and restframe U-V color, and between linewidth\nand stellar mass.

The mass distribution of close-in\nplanets generally has two peaks at about Neptune mass and Jupiter mass. The\nlower-mass peak takes the maximum frequency for M dwarfs. Around more massive\nsolar-type stars (G dwarfs), the higher-mass peak is much more pronounced.\nThese are because planets tend to undergo type II migration after fully\naccreting gas around G dwarfs while they tend to migrate faster than gas\naccretion around M stars. Close-in Neptune-mass planets may also exist around G\ndwarfs, though they tend to be mostly composed of silicates and iron cores and\ntheir frequency is expected to be much smaller than that of Neptune-mass\nplanets around M dwarfs and that of gas giants around G dwarfs.

From a subsample of 56 galaxies, for which metallicity of the\ninterstellar medium is also measured, we identified a strong correlation\nbetween mass and metallicity, for the first time in the distant Universe. This\nwas possible because of the larger base line spanned by the sample in terms of\nmetallicity (a factor of 7) and mass (a factor of 400) than in previous works.\nThis correlation is much stronger and tighter than the luminosity-metallicity,\nconfirming that stellar mass is a more meaningful physical parameter than\nluminosity. We find clear evidence for temporal evolution in the M-Z relation\nin the sense that at a given mass, a galaxy at z=0.7 tends to have lower\nmetallicity than a local galaxy of similar mass. We use the z=0.1 SDSS M-Z\nrelation, and a small sample of z=2.3 Lyman break galaxies with known mass and\nmetallicity, to propose an empirical redshift-dependent M-Z relation, according\nto which the stellar mass and metallicity in small galaxies evolve for a longer\ntime than in massive galaxies.

The\nobserved redshift evolution of the M-Z relation can be reproduced remarkably\nwell by a simple closed-box model where the key assumption is an e-folding time\nfor star formation which is higher or, in other words, a period of star\nformation that lasts longer in less massive galaxies than in more massive\ngalaxies.

For Gaussian initial conditions, when the\ndensity fluctuation amplitude is small, tree-level (leading order) perturbation\ntheory predicts a characteristic dependence of the bispectrum on the shape of\nthe triangle formed by the three wave vectors. This configuration dependence\nprovides a signature of gravitational instability, and departures from it in\ngalaxy catalogs can be interpreted as due to bias, that is, non-gravitational\neffects. On the other hand, N-body simulations indicate that the reduced\nthree-point function becomes relatively shape-independent in the strongly\nnon-linear regime. In order to understand this non-linear transition and assess\nthe domain of reliability of shape-dependence as a probe of bias, we calculate\nthe one-loop (next-to-leading order) corrections to the bispectrum in\nperturbation theory.

It is interesting to find that, within the linear\napproximation, such degrees of freedom show {\\it graviton-like} features: they\nsatisfy a wave equation and propagate with a velocity related to the scalar\nNewtonian potential.\n","Comment: 29 pages , compress, uuencode LaTex file, gr-qc/95050xx"]}]

Within this\nframework, flat-space limit and general form of the one-loop effective\npotential are studied in detail by using analytic and numerical methods. It\nturns out that, as far as the absolute-minimum direction is concerned, the\nflat-space limit of the one-loop calculation about a de Sitter background does\nnot change the results previously obtained in the literature, where the\ntree-level potential in flat space-time was studied. Moreover, when curvature\neffects are no longer negligible in the one-loop potential, it is found that\nthe early universe remains bound to reach only the SO(6)xSO(4) absolute\nminimum.\n","Comment: 25 pages, plain Tex, plus Latex file of the tables appended at the\n  end.

We then give an analytic treatment of quantum\nmechanical reflection in the thin wall regime, in which interactions with the\nplasma can be neglected as a particle propagates across the wall. We focus on\nleptons because of their much weaker coupling to the plasma. We argue that they\nare likely to be accurately described by this calculation, but quarks are not.\nThe relative magnitude of the baryon asymmetry produced for different fermions\ndepends on their relative Yukawa couplings ({\\it not} their zero temperature\nmasses), their transport properties and their interactions. We calculate the\nbaryon asymmetry for various parameter ranges and conclude that asymmetries\ncomparable with observations can be generated.\n","Comment: Final version to appear in Phys. Rev.

Quantum spacetime points with no extension make up more complex\nlink units with microscopic extension, which make up networks with macroscopic\nextension. Such a multilevel quantum theory implies parastatistics for the\nlowest level entities without additional physical assumptions.
