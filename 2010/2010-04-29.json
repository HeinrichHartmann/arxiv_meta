Within growing neutrino\nmodels the coupling becomes effective only in recent times, when neutrinos\nbecome non-relativistic, stopping the evolution of the cosmon. This can explain\nwhy dark energy dominates the universe only in a rather recent epoch by\nrelating the present dark energy density to the small mass of neutrinos. Such\nmodels predict the presence of stable neutrino lumps at supercluster scales\n(~200 Mpc and bigger), caused by an attractive force between neutrinos which is\nstronger than gravity and mediated by the cosmon. We present a method to follow\nthe initial non-linear formation of neutrino lumps in physical space, by\nintegrating numerically on a 3D grid non-linear evolution equations, until\nvirialization naturally occurs. As a first application, we show results for\ncosmologies with final large neutrino average mass ~2 eV: in this case,\nneutrino lumps indeed form and mimic very large cold dark matter structures,\nwith a typical gravitational potential 10^{-5} for a lump size ~10 Mpc, and\nreaching larger values for lumps of about 200 Mpc. A rough estimate of the\ncosmological gravitational potential at small k in the non-linear regime,\nPhi_nu = 10^{-6} (k/k_0)^{-2}, 1.2x10^{-2} h/Mpc < k_0 < 7.8x10^{-2} h/Mpc,\nturns out to be many orders of magnitude smaller than an extrapolation of the\nlinear evolution of density fluctuations.

The comparison of\nresults with the existing calculations in the bare 2+1 quark meson linear sigma\nmodel, shows that the restoration of chiral symmetry becomes sharper due to the\ninfluence of the Polyakov loop potential. We find that inclusion of the\nPolyakov loop in quark meson linear sigma model together with the presence of\naxial anomaly, triggers an early and significant melting of the strange\ncondensate. We have examined how the inclusion of the Polyakov loop\nqualitatively and quantitatively affects the convergence in the masses of the\nchiral partners in pseudoscalar ($\\pi$, $\\eta$, $\\eta'$, $K$) and scalar\n($\\sigma$, $a_0$, $f_0$,$\\kappa$) meson nonets as the temperature is varied on\nthe reduced temperature scale. The role of $U_A(1)$ anomaly in determining the\nisoscalar masses and mixing angles for the pseudoscalar ($\\eta$ and $\\eta'$)\nand scalar ($\\sigma$ and $f_0$)meson complex, has also been investigated in the\nPolyakov quark meson linear sigma model. The interplay of chiral symmetry\nrestoration effects and the setting up of $U_A(1)$ restoration trend has been\ndiscussed and analyzed in the framework of the presented model calculations.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables"]}]

It is found that the Langmuir wave electric field, indeed, increases\nby the effect of ion-wave nonlinearity (IWN). Use of a low-dimensional model,\nbased on three Fourier modes shows that a transition to temporal chaos is\npossible, when the length scale of the linearly excited modes is larger than\nthat of the most unstable ones. The chaotic behaviors of the unstable modes are\nidentified by the analysis of Lyapunov exponent spectra. The space-time\nevolution of the coupled LWs and IAWs shows that the IWN can cause the\nexcitation of many unstable harmonic modes, and can lead to strong IAW\nemission. This occurs when the initial wave field is relatively large or the\nlength scale of IAWs is larger than the soliton characteristic size. Numerical\nsimulation also reveals that many solitary patterns can be excited and\ngenerated through the modulational instability (MI) of unstable harmonic modes.\nAs time goes on, these solitons are seen to appear in the spatially partial\ncoherence (SPC) state due to the free ion-acoustic radiation as well as in the\nstate of spatiotemporal chaos (STC) due to collision and fusion in the\nstochastic motion.

Away from linear response, however, this symmetry is not\nfulfilled and the conductance phase of the interferometer when a quantum dot is\ninserted in one of its arms can be a continuous function of the bias voltage.\nSuch magnetoasymmetries have been investigated in related mesoscopic systems\nand arise as a consequence of the asymetric response of the internal potential\nof the conductor out of equilibrium. Here we discuss magnetoasymmetries in\nquantum-dot Aharonov-Bohm interferometers when strong electron-electron\ninteractions are taken into account beyond the mean-field approach. We find\nthat at very low temperatures the asymmetric element of the differential\nconductance shows an abrupt change for voltages around the Fermi level. At\nhigher temperatures we recover a smooth variation of the magnetoasymmetry as a\nfunction of the bias. We illustrate our results with the aid of the electron\noccupation at the dot, demonstrating that its nonequilibrium component is an\nasymmetric function of the flux even to lowest order in voltage. We also\ncalculate the magnetoasymmetry of the current-current correlations (the noise)\nand find that it is given, to a good extent, by the magnetoasymmetry of the\nweakly nonlinear conductance term. Therefore, both magnetoasymmetries (noise\nand conductance) are related to each other via a higher-order\nfluctuation-dissipation relation.
