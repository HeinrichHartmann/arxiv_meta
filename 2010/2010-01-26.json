The radio lobes in these\nsystems have created visible cavities in the surrounding hot, X-ray-emitting\ngas, which allow direct measurement of the mechanical jet power of radio\nsources over six decades of radio luminosity, independently of the radio\nproperties themselves. Using these measurements, we examine the ratio between\nradio power and total jet power (the radiative efficiency). We find that jet\n(cavity) power increases with radio synchrotron power approximately as P_jet ~\n(L_radio)^beta, where 0.35 < beta < 0.70 depending on the bandpass of\nmeasurement and state of the source. However, the scatter about these relations\ncaused by variations in radiative efficiency spans more than four orders of\nmagnitude. After accounting for variations in synchrotron break frequency\n(age), the scatter is reduced by ~ 50%, yielding the most accurate scaling\nrelation available between the lobe bolometric radio power and the jet (cavity)\npower. We place limits on the magnetic field strengths and particle content of\nthe radio lobes using a variety of X-ray constraints. We find that the lobe\nmagnetic field strengths vary between a few to several tens of microgauss\ndepending on the age and dynamical state of the lobes. If the cavities are\nmaintained in pressure balance with their surroundings and are supported by\ninternal fields and particles in equipartition, the ratio of energy in\nelectrons to heavy particles (k) must vary widely from approximately unity to\n4000, consistent with heavy (hadronic) jets.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 11 figures.

Ruin occurs when the total of the value of the risky and riskless\nassets and the surrender value of the life annuity reaches zero. We find the\noptimal investment strategy and optimal annuity purchase and surrender\nstrategies in two situations: (i) the value of the risky and riskless assets is\nallowed to be negative, with the imputed surrender value of the life annuity\nkeeping the total positive; or (ii) the value of the risky and riskless assets\nis required to be non-negative.

The additional\ncapability of tracking in realtime - with minimal latency - opens up the\nexperimental possibility of manipulating sensory feedback, thus allowing\ndetailed explorations of the neural basis for control of behavior. Here we\ndescribe a new system capable of tracking the position and body orientation of\nanimals such as flies and birds. The system operates with less than 40 msec\nlatency and can track multiple animals simultaneously. To achieve these\nresults, a multi target tracking algorithm was developed based on the Extended\nKalman Filter and the Nearest Neighbor Standard Filter data association\nalgorithm. In one implementation, an eleven camera system is capable of\ntracking three flies simultaneously at 60 frames per second using a gigabit\nnetwork of nine standard Intel Pentium 4 and Core 2 Duo computers. This\nmanuscript presents the rationale and details of the algorithms employed and\nshows three implementations of the system. An experiment was performed using\nthe tracking system to measure the effect of visual contrast on the flight\nspeed of Drosophila melanogaster. At low contrasts, speed is more variable and\nfaster on average than at high contrasts. Thus, the system is already a useful\ntool to study the neurobiology and behavior of freely flying animals. If\ncombined with other techniques, such as `virtual reality'-type computer\ngraphics or genetic manipulation, the tracking system would offer a powerful\nnew way to investigate the biology of flying animals.\n","Comment: pdfTeX using libpoppler 3.141592-1.40.3-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.6), 18 pages\n  with 9 figures"]}]

Reducing all the\navailable IBIS data up to April 2008 we have produced a 5 years full sky 511\nkeV map with 10 Ms exposure in the Galactic Center. We did not find any\nsignificant signal at this energy. The lack of detection of 511 keV galactic\npoint sources is in agreement with the idea that a significant part of the\ngalactic positrons originates in compact objects and then propagates in the\ninterstellar medium.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 2 figures.

Motivated by\nthe concepts of gauge group and projective symmetry group in the\nslave-particle/projective construction, and by the low-dimensional gauge-like\nsymmetries of some exactly solvable Hamiltonians, we study the $d$-dimensional\ngauge structure and the $d$-dimensional symmetry structure of a tensor network\nstate, where $d\\leq d_{space}$ with $d_{space}$ the dimension of space. The\n$d$-dimensional gauge structure and $d$-dimensional symmetry structure allow us\nto calculate the string operators and $d$-brane operators of the tensor network\nstate.
