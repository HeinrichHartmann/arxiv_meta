Variability of the neutral hydrogen column density over\nthe orbital period was observed, which we attribute to the line of sight motion\nof the neutron star through the dense circumstellar environment. A reduction in\nthe power law photon index was observed during the orbital maximum, which we\nspeculate is due to absorption effects as the neutron star passes behind a\nheavily absorbing region near the base of the supergiant companion's wind. No\nsignificant variability of the column density was observed over the\nsuper-orbital period, indicating that variable obscuration by a precessing warp\nin an accretion disc is not the mechanism behind the super-orbital modulation.\nIn contrast, a significant increase in the power law photon index was observed\nduring the super-orbital minimum.

The interaction of\nvery-high-energy (VHE: E>100 GeV) gamma-rays, emitted by sources located at\ncosmological distances, with the intervening EBL results in electron-positron\npair production that leads to energy-dependent attenuation of the observed VHE\nflux.

In this paper we propose a method\nto measure the EBL photon number density. It relies on using simultaneous\nobservations of blazars in the optical, X-ray, high-energy (HE: E>100 MeV)\ngamma-ray (from the Fermi telescope), and VHE gamma-ray (from Cherenkov\ntelescopes) bands. For each source, the method involves best-fitting the\nspectral energy distribution (SED) from optical through HE gamma-rays (the\nlatter being largely unaffected by EBL attenuation as long as z<1) with a\nSynchrotron Self-Compton (SSC) model. We extrapolate such best-fitting models\ninto the VHE regime, and assume they represent the blazars' intrinsic emission.\nContrasting measured versus intrinsic emission leads to a determination of the\ngamma-gamma opacity to VHE photons - hence, upon assuming a specific cosmology,\nwe derive the EBL photon number density.

The maximum in Toomre's stability\ndiagram, which separates gravitationally stable and unstable states with\nrespect to axisymmetric perturbations, can be treated as a critical point for\nthis transition. Static perturbations of stellar density are explored and the\nmean perturbation amplitude is considered as the order parameter of the theory.\nThe disc's state is assumed to change as the disc passes through the critical\npoint. Since the disc tends to retain hydrostatic equilibrium, structures can\nbe formed spontaneously, identifiable with a seed spiral structure. A power-law\nscaling of the order parameter in the vicinity of the critical point has been\nfound. The susceptibility and other Landau--Weiss exponents similar to those in\nthe Van der Waals theory are calculated. The critical behaviour of marginally\nstable discs at the initial stage of their evolution occurs in numerical\nsimulations where snapshots of stellar positions reveal stellar splinters and\ncrescents diverging from the disc centre. These structures can be a result of\nthe phase transition. In numerical simulations, these structures eventually\nreduce to decaying worm-type features because of the `heating' most likely\nresulting from instability of stellar orbits due to resonances. Under\nfavourable conditions the critical behaviour leading to the establishment of\norder in a stellar disc can result in the generation of a spiral structure.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 1 figure"]}]

In this review we summarize recent theoretical advances along these\nlines. Particularly, we are concerned with nonequilibrium situations created by\nexternal electric fields and by temperature or velocity gradients. These\nconstraints pump energy into a system, hence there must be some thermal\nreservoir that prevents the system from heating up. About twenty years ago a\ndeterministic and time-reversible modeling of such thermal reservoirs was\nproposed in form of Gaussian and Nose-Hoover thermostats. This approach yielded\nsimple relations between fundamental quantities of nonequilibrium statistical\nmechanics and of dynamical systems theory. The main theme of our review is to\ncritically assess the universality of these results. As a vehicle of\ndemonstration we employ the driven periodic Lorentz gas, which is a toy model\nfor the classical dynamics of an electron in a metal under application of an\nelectric field. Applying different types of thermal reservoirs to this system\nwe compare the resulting nonequilibrium steady states with each other. Along\nthe same lines we discuss an interacting many-particle system under shear and\nheat. Finally, we outline an unexpected relationship between deterministic\nthermostats and active Brownian particles modeling biophysical cell motility.\n","Comment: review, 103 pages (revtex) with 24 figures (postscript); some figures\n  are in reduced quality, see alternatively\n  http://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/~rklages"]}]
