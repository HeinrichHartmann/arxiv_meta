The bar\nfraction in very massive, luminous spirals is about constant out to z ~ 0.84\nwhereas for the low mass, blue spirals it declines significantly with redshift\nbeyond z=0.3.

Surprisingly, the standard derivation of the response wave detectors\nmakes several unjustifiable assumptions, both conceptual and quantitative,\nregarding the coordinate trajectory and coordinate velocity of the null\ngeodesic the light travels along. These errors, which appear to have remained\nunrecognized for at least 35 years, render the \"standard\" derivation inadequate\nand misleading as an archetype calculation. Here we identify the flaws in the\nexisting derivation and provide, in full detail, a correct derivation of the\nresponse of a single-bounce Michelson interferometer to gravitational waves,\nfollowing a procedure that will always yield correct results; compare it to the\n\"standard\", but incorrect, derivation; show where the earlier mistakes were\nmade; and identify the general conditions under which the \"standard\" derivation\nwill yield correct results.

Enhancement of charged lepton flavor\nviolation by the large mixing angle observed in leptonic charged currents,\nwhich is present for the minimal choice of representations where the LH charged\nlepton and neutrino mixing angles are similar, can thus be avoided in these\nmodels.

We find that, for multipole regime corresponding to \\theta <~ 5 deg,\nthe angular power spectrum is dominated by a noise-like term, with suppression\ndue to internal structure of relevant subhalos. If the mass spectrum extends\ndown to Earth-mass scale, then the subhalos would be detected in the anisotropy\nwith Fermi at angular scales of ~10 deg, if their contribution to the gamma-ray\nbackground is larger than ~20%. If the minimum mass is around 10^4 M_{sun}, on\nthe other hand, the relevant angular scale for detection is ~1 deg, and the\nanisotropy detection requires that the subhalo contribution to the gamma-ray\nbackground intensity is only ~4%. These can be achieved with a modest boost for\nparticle physics parameters. We also find that the anisotropy analysis could be\na more sensitive probe for the subhalos than individual detection. We also\nstudy dependence on model parameters, where we reach the similar conclusions\nfor all the models investigated. The analytic approach should be very useful\nwhen Fermi data are analyzed and the obtained angular power spectrum is\ninterpreted in terms of subhalo models.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 13 figures; improved subhalo modeling; accepted for\n  publication in Physical Review D"]}]

It allows us to\ncorrectly treat the zero mode problem. The quantum theory is invariant under\nSO(5), the symmetry group of $S^4$, and the associated two-point functions have\nno infrared divergence. The well-known infrared divergence which appears by\ntaking the massless limit of the massive scalar field propagator is therefore a\ngauge artifact. By contrast, the massless scalar field theory on de Sitter\nspace $dS^4$ - the lorentzian version of $S^4$ - is not invariant under the\nsymmetry group of that spacetime SO(1,4). Here, the infrared divergence is\nreal. Therefore, the massless scalar quantum field theories on $S^4$ and $dS^4$\ncannot be linked by analytic continuation. In this case, because of zero modes,\nthe euclidean approach to quantum field theory does not work. Similar\nconsiderations also apply to massive scalar field theories for exceptional\nvalues of the mass parameter (corresponding to the discrete series of the de\nSitter group).\n","Comment: This paper has been published under the title \"Zero modes,\n  euclideanization and quantization\" [Phys.

We show that, under quite mild\nrestrictions on the time dependence of the mass, the specific Fock\nrepresentation of the canonical commutation relations which is naturally\nassociated with a massless free field provides a unitary dynamics even when the\ntime varying mass is present. Moreover, we demonstrate that this Fock\nrepresentation is the only acceptable one, up to unitary equivalence, if the\nvacuum has to be SO(4)-invariant (i.e., invariant under the symmetries of the\nfield equation) and the dynamics is required to be unitary. In particular, the\nanalysis and uniqueness of the quantization can be applied to the treatment of\ncosmological perturbations around Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetimes with\nthe spatial topology of the three-sphere, like e.g. for gravitational waves\n(tensor perturbations). In addition, we analyze the extension of our results to\nfree fields with a time dependent mass defined on other compact spatial\nmanifolds. We prove the uniqueness of the Fock representation in the case of a\ntwo-sphere as well, and discuss the case of a three-torus.\n","Comment: 30 pages"]}]

The size of the amplitude\nsuppression is 13+-2 per cent for the velocity and 9+-2 per cent for the\nintensity observations. Over the range 4.5mHz <nu< 5.5mHz the findings hint\nwithin the errors to a null change both in the velocity and intensity\namplitudes.

For a given input distribution, the MMSE is found to be infinitely\ndifferentiable at all positive SNR, and in fact a real analytic function in SNR\nunder mild conditions. The key to these regularity results is that the\nposterior distribution conditioned on the observation through Gaussian channels\nalways decays at least as quickly as some Gaussian density. Furthermore, simple\nexpressions for the first three derivatives of the MMSE with respect to the SNR\nare obtained. It is also shown that, as functions of the SNR, the curves for\nthe MMSE of a Gaussian input and that of a non-Gaussian input cross at most\nonce over all SNRs.

Their effective line formation region is located in\nthe central parts of granules, which make the major contribution to the\nabsorption of spatially unresolved lines. The cores of strong lines are formed\nin upper photospheric layers where is formed reversed granulation due to\nconvection reversal and physical conditions change drastically there. As a\nconsequence the depression contributions in the strong line from intergranular\nlanes with downflows substantially increase. This accounts for smaller blue\nshifts of strong lines. In infrared spectrum the observed decrease in the blue\nline shifts is explained by the fact that their effective line formation\nregions lie higher in the photosphere and extend much further into the reversed\ngranulation region due to the line opacity rise with the increase of line\nwavelength. Additionally the effective line formation depths of the synthesized\nvisible and infrared Fe I lines and their dependence on line parameters is\ndiscussed.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 5 figures, pudlished in Kinematika i Fizika Nebesnykh Tel\n  (in Russian), Kinematics Phys.

The different formation times\nof bars and rings suggest an interpretation of these differences. Bars form\nrelatively quickly, and indicate that material is recently being transported\n(by redistribution of angular momentum) to the center of the galaxy, where it\nis likely to trigger a short (e.g., $\\lesssim 10^8$ yrs) burst of star\nformation.

It is most likely that more than half of molecular gas within the\ncentral kpc of a barred galaxy was transported there from outside by the bar.\nThe supply of gas has exceeded the consumption of gas by star formation in the\ncentral kpc, resulting in the excess gas in the centers of barred systems.
