A halo sample is defined\nusing the maximum circular velocity, which is both well defined for subhalos\nand closely correlated with galaxy luminosity. Subhalos, including the\nprecursors of major mergers, are severely tidally stripped. Major mergers\nbetween subhalos are therefore extremely rare.

The RR flux encodes how the\nM-theory circle is fibered over the IIA geometry. The theories on N D2 branes\nprobing X3 are the well-known quiver theories with N=2 supersymmetry in three\ndimensions. We show that turning on fluxes, and fibering the X3 over a\ndirection transverse to the branes, corresponds to turning on N=2 Chern-Simons\ncouplings. String duality implies that, in the strong coupling limit, the N D2\nbranes on X3 in this background become N M2 branes on X4.

Since games are a popular means of entertainment, our hypothesis is\nthat they may serve as an incentive to users and make the pairing process\nenjoyable for them, thus improving the usability, as well as the security, of\nthe pairing process. We consider an emerging use case of pairing whereby two\ndifferent users are involved, each in possession of his or her own device\n(e.g., Alice and Bob pairing their smartphones for social interactions).

For network planners\nwho are deploying VoIP over WLANs, one of the important issues is the VoIP\ncapacity. VoIP bandwidth consumption over a WAN is one of the most important\nfactors to consider when building a VoIP infrastructure. Failure to account for\nVoIP bandwidth requirements will severely limit the reliability of a VoIP\nsystem and place a huge burden on the WAN infrastructure. Less bandwidth\nutilization is the key reasons for reduced number of channel accesses in VOIP.\nBut in the QoS point of view the free bandwidth of atleast 1-5% will improve\nthe voice quality. This proposal utilizes the maximum bandwidth by leaving 1-5%\nfree bandwidth. A Bandwidth Data rate Moderation (BDM) algorithm has been\nproposed which correlates the data rate specified in IEEE802.11b with the free\nbandwidth. At each time BDM will calculate the bandwidth utilization before\nsending the packet to improve performance and voice quality of VoIP. The\nbandwidth calculation in BDM can be done by using Erlang and VOIP bandwidth\ncalculator. Finally, ns2 experimental study shows the relationship between\nbandwidth utilization, free bandwidth and data rate.
