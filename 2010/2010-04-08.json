We argue that a requirement of\nquasi-separability should play a critical role in such an analysis.

We find that any random Hamiltonian\n(constructed in a sufficiently large space) can yield a ``good enough''\napproximation to a local field theory.

Methods: The fluxes of the far-infrared [O i] and [O iii] lines are\nextracted from the previously unpublished archival ISO data. The archival\nSpitzer data are used to determine the fluxes of the O, Ne, Si, S, Ar and Fe\nion fine-structure lines originating in the FMKs. The ratios of these line\nfluxes are used for the plasma diagnostics. We also determine the infrared line\nflux ratios to the optical [O iii] 5007 A line in the knots having previously\nmeasured reddening. Additionally, we analyze several optical and near-infrared\nobservations of the FMKs to obtain clearer insight into the post-shock\nphotoionized region (PIR) structure. Results: We show that the infrared oxygen\nline flux predictions of all existing theoretical models are correct only to\nwithin a factor of several. For the models to reproduce the observations it is\nessential to include the electron conductivity and effects of the dust.\nDetailed analysis of the diagnostic line flux ratios allows us to qualitatively\nconfirm the general model of the FMK emission and to determine observationally\nthe physical conditions in the PIR after the shock front. We infer that the\npre-shock cloud densities most probably constitute several hundred particles\nper cm^3. We also determine the Cas A luminosities in the infrared continuum\nand lines.

That is to say, there is no effective field that\nlocally drives the spin current.

In a Rashba spin-orbit system, the local part of the\ncharge current is proportional to the spin relaxation torque, and the local\nspin current, which does not arise from the spin accumulation, does not play\nany role in the conversion. In contrast, the diffusive spin current contributes\nto the diffusive charge current. Alternatively, for spin-orbit interactions\narising from random impurities, the local charge current is proportional to the\nlocal spin current that constitutes only a small fraction of the total spin\ncurrent. Clearly, the dominant spin current (diffusive spin current) is not\nconverted into a charge current.

Improper setting of\nuncertain constraints can result in overfitting or underfitting. To solve this\nproblem, a generalization of Maxent, under Tsallis entropy framework, is\nproposed.

The technique\nutilizes the fact that Monte Carlo simulations track individual photon packets,\nso we may easily determine where their energy is absorbed. When a packet is\nabsorbed, it heats a particular cell within the envelope, raising its\ntemperature. To enforce radiative equilibrium, the absorbed packet is\nimmediately re-emitted. To correct the cell temperature, the frequency of the\nre-emitted packet is chosen so that it corrects the temperature of the spectrum\npreviously emitted by the cell. The re-emitted packet then continues being\nscattered, absorbed, and re-emitted until it finally escapes from the envelope.\nAs the simulation runs, the envelope heats up, and the emergent spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) relaxes to its equilibrium value, without iteration. This\nimplies that the equilibrium temperature calculation requires no more\ncomputation time than the SED calculation of an equivalent pure scattering\nmodel with fixed temperature. In addition to avoiding iteration, our method\nconserves energy exactly, because all injected photon packets eventually\nescape. Furthermore, individual packets transport energy across the entire\nsystem because they are never destroyed. This long-range communication, coupled\nwith the lack of iteration, implies that our method does not suffer the\nconvergence problems commonly associated with lambda-iteration.

Single\ngrain size models are studied for a wide range of grain sizes in three optical\ndepth regimes. In this study, we find limits for the cases where the IR SED is\nand is not capable of conveying information about grain sizes, and to what\nextent it does so. We find that approximate invariance occurs for a much larger\nrange of grain sizes than previously believed, and, when approximate invariance\nholds, the SED is controlled mainly by one parameter, the reprocessing optical\ndepth, a quantity that measures the fraction of starlight that is absorbed by\nthe dust grains. Models with a grain size distribution are studied as well. For\nthese models, we find that, in many instances, the concept of approximate\ninvariance may be extended from the IR SED to all wavelengths. This means that,\nfor a wide range of optical depths, models with different grain size\ndistributions will produce very similar SEDs and, hence, the reprocessing\noptical depth is the only quantity that can be unambiguously obtained from the\nSED.
