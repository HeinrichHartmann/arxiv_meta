We analyze the resolution of the image\nof a line source radiating in the Maxwell fisheye and the Veselago-Pendry slab\nlens. The former optical medium is deduced from the stereographic projection of\na virtual sphere and displays a heterogeneous refractive index n(r) which is\nproportional to the inverse of 1+r^2. The latter is described by a homogeneous,\nbut negative, refractive index. It has been suggested that the fisheye makes a\nperfect lens without negative refraction [Leonhardt, Philbin\narxiv:0805.4778v2]. However, we point out that the definition of\nsuper-resolution in such a heterogeneous medium should be computed with respect\nto the wavelength in a homogenized medium, and it is perhaps more adequate to\ntalk about a conjugate image rather than a perfect image (the former does not\nnecessarily contains the evanescent components of the source). We numerically\nfind that both the Maxwell fisheye and a thick silver slab lens lead to a\nresolution close to lambda/3 in transverse magnetic polarization (electric\nfield pointing orthogonal to the plane). We note a shift of the image plane in\nthe latter lens. We also observe that two sources lead to multiple secondary\nimages in the former lens, as confirmed from light rays travelling along\ngeodesics of the virtual sphere.

The goal\nof this paper is to understand and characterize the impact of social influence\non the complexity of computing and approximating market equilibria.\n  We present complexity-theoretic and algorithmic results for approximating\nmarket equilibria in this model with focus on two concrete influence models\nbased on the traditional linear utility functions. Recall that an Arrow-Debreu\nmarket equilibrium in a conventional exchange market with linear utility\nfunctions can be computed in polynomial time by convex programming.

The main\nconclusions of these scenarios are: the performance of probabilistic algorithm\nsuffers in presence of noise.

The nodes' speed has no or insignificant effect\non the performance.\n","Comment: 13 Pages, 13 Figures, Journal"]}]

The 'true' (or myopic) self-avoiding walk model (TSAW) was\nintroduced in the physics literature by Amit, Parisi and Peliti. This is a\nnearest neighbor non-Markovian random walk in Z^d which prefers to jump to\nthose neighbors which were less visited in the past. The self-repelling\nBrownian polymer model (SRBP), initiated in the probabilistic literature by\nDurrett and Rogers (independently of the physics community), is the continuous\nspace-time counterpart: a diffusion in R^d pushed by the negative gradient of\nthe (mollified) occupation time measure of the process. In both cases, similar\nlong memory effects are caused by a pathwise self-repellency of the\ntrajectories due to a push by the negative gradient of (softened) local time.\nWe investigate the asymptotic behaviour of TSAW and SRBP in the non-recurrent\ndimensions. First, we identify a natural stationary (in time) and ergodic\ndistribution of the environment (the local time profile) as seen from the\nmoving particle. The main results are diffusive limits. In the case of TSAW,\nfor a wide class of self-interaction functions, we establish diffusive lower\nand upper bounds for the displacement and for a particular, more restricted\nclass of interactions, we prove full CLT for the finite dimensional\ndistributions of the displacement. In the case of SRBP, we prove full CLT\nwithout restrictions on the interaction functions. These results settle part of\nthe conjectures, based on non-rigorous renormalization group arguments (equally\n'valid' for the TSAW and SRBP cases). The proof of the CLT follows the\nnon-reversible version of Kipnis-Varadhan theory.
