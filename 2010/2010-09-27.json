We say that a\nplanar set is cover-decomposable if there is a constant m such that any m-fold\ncovering of the plane with its translates is decomposable into two disjoint\ncoverings of the whole plane. Pach conjectured that every convex set is\ncover-decomposable. We verify his conjecture for polygons. Moreover, if m is\nlarge enough, we prove that any m-fold covering can even be decomposed into k\ncoverings. Then we show that the situation is exactly the opposite in 3\ndimensions, for any polyhedron and any $m$ we construct an m-fold covering of\nthe space that is not decomposable. We also give constructions that show that\nconcave polygons are usually not cover-decomposable.

The slope number of a graph G is the smallest\nnumber s with the property that G has a straight-line drawing with edges of at\nmost s distinct slopes and with no bends. We examine the slope number of\nbounded degree graphs. Our main results are that if the maximum degree is at\nleast 5, then the slope number tends to infinity as the number of vertices\ngrows but every graph with maximum degree at most 3 can be embedded with only\nfive slopes.
