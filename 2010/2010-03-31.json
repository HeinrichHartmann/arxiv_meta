The\nrotating reference system is constructed as an infinite set of Frenet-Seret\ntetrads defined so that the detector is at rest in a tetrad at each proper\ntime. Correlation functions, more exactly their frequency spectrum, contain the\nPlanck thermal factor, and the energy density the rotating detector observes is\nproportional to the sum of energy densities of Planck's spectrum at the\ntemperature T_rot = \\hbar \\Omega / (2 \\pi k_B) and zero-point radiation. The\nproportionality factor is (2/3)(4\\gamma^2 - 1) for an electromagnetic field and\n(2/9)(4\\gamma^2 - 1) for a massless scalar field, where \\gamma = (1 - (\\Omega\nr/c)^2)^(-1/2), and r is a detector rotation radius. The origin of these\nthermal effects is the periodicity of the correlation functions and their\ndiscrete spectrum, both following rotation with angular velocity \\Omega. The\nthermal energy can also be interpreted as a source of a vacuum force, f_vac,\napplied to the rotating detector from the vacuum field. The f_vac depends on\nthe size of neither the charge nor the mass, like the force in the Casimir\nmodel for a charged particle, but, contrary to the last one, it is directed to\nthe center of the circular orbit. The f_vac infinitely grows by magnitude when\nr \\to r_0 = c/\\Omega, with a fixed \\Omega. The orbits with a radius greater\nthan r_0 do not exist simply because the returning vacuum force becomes\ninfinite. On the uttermost orbit with the radius r_0, a linear velocity of the\nrotating particle would have become c. The f_vac becomes very small and\nproportional to r when r is small, r << c/\\aOmega.

Assuming explicit volume growth lower bounds in the limit, we show that\nif $\\lim_{r \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\nu(B_p(r))}{\\omega_n r^n} > \\alpha(k,n)$, then\nthe $k$-th group of $(Y,p)$ is trivial.

The event rate depends on the dark matter density in the sun, which in\nturn is dictated by the cross section of WIMPs with nucleons. This however is\nbounded by direct detection experiments. We use the constraints from these\nexperiments to place model-independent upper bounds on the event rates in\nneutrino telescopes that apply to any elastic dark matter model. Since the\nspin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross section is much more tightly constrained\nthan the corresponding spin-dependent cross section, the bounds are much\nstronger in the former case and are competitive with the current limits from\nIceCube. If the number of events observed in neutrino telescopes exceeds the\nupper bound corresponding to spin-independent interactions, the implication is\nthat the cross section of dark matter with nucleons is dominated by\nspin-dependent interactions. In such a scenario the natural dark matter\ncandidates are Majorana fermions and real vector bosons, so that dark matter\nparticles are their own anti-particles.
