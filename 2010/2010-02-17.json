A key issue in that theory is to extract the gauge\ninvariant degrees of freedom which allow unambiguous comparison between theory\nand experiment. When one goes beyond first (linear) order, the task of writing\nthe Einstein equations expanded to n'th order in terms of quantities that are\ngauge invariant up to terms of higher orders becomes highly non-trivial and\ncumbersome. This fact has prevented progress for instance on the issue of the\nstability of linear perturbation theory and is a subject of current debate in\nthe literature. In this series of papers we circumvent these difficulties by\npassing to a manifestly gauge invariant framework. In other words, we only\nperturb gauge invariant, i.e. measurable quantities, rather than gauge variant\nones. Thus, gauge invariance is preserved non perturbatively while we construct\nthe perturbation theory for the equations of motion for the gauge invariant\nobservables to all orders. In this first paper we develop the general framework\nwhich is based on a seminal paper due to Brown and Kuchar as well as the\nrealtional formalism due to Rovelli. In the second, companion, paper we apply\nour general theory to FRW cosmologies and derive the deviations from the\nstandard treatment in linear order. As it turns out, these deviations are\nnegligible in the late universe, thus our theory is in agreement with the\nstandard treatment.

While these methods do not guarantee precise results, they can be vastly\nmore efficient than approaches that rely on exact counting. However, for many\nsimilarity measures no such methods have been known.

We\ndemonstrate theoretically that our method is superior to exact methods when the\nthreshold for \"interesting similarity/confidence\" is above the average pairwise\nsimilarity/confidence, and the average support is not too low. Our method is\nparticularly good when transactions contain many items. We confirm in\nexperiments on standard association mining benchmarks that this gives a\nsignificant speedup on real data sets (sometimes much larger than the\ntheoretical guarantees). Reductions in computation time of over an order of\nmagnitude, and significant savings in space, are observed.\n","Comment: This is an extended version of a paper that appeared at the IEEE\n  International Conference on Data Mining, 2009.

Substantial charge symmetry violation [CSV]\ncould affect current tests of flavor symmetry. In this review we examine the\npossibility of CSV for parton distributions. We first give definitions for\nstructure functions without making the usual assumption of charge symmetry.\nNext we make estimates of CSV for both valence and sea quark distributions. We\nlist a set of relations which must hold if charge symmetry is valid, and review\ncurrent experimental limits on CSV. We propose a series of experimental tests\nof charge symmetry. These tests could either detect CSV, or they could provide\nstronger upper limits on CSV effects. We discuss CSV contributions to sum\nrules, and we propose sum rules which could differentiate between flavor\nsymmetry, and charge symmetry violation in nuclear systems.\n","Comment: 74 pages, including 26 figures"]}]

In\nQMC the coupling constant between the scalar ($\\sigma$) meson and the nucleon\nis expected to decrease with increasing nuclear density, because of the\nself-consistent modification of the structure of the nucleon. The reduction of\nthe coupling constant then leads to a smaller contribution from relativistic\nRPA than in the Walecka model. However, since the electromagnetic form factors\nof the in-medium nucleon are modified at the same time, the longitudinal\nresponse function and the Coulomb sum are reduced by a total of about 20% in\ncomparison with the Hartree contribution. We find that the relativistic RPA and\nthe nucleon structure variation both contribute about fifty-fifty to the\nreduction of the longitudinal response.\n","Comment: 14 pages, including 3 ps files"]}]
