Many\nprevious studies have investigated this topic, particularly in relation to the\nnon-linear regime of structure formation. However, no careful pre-selection of\nviable quintessence models with high precision cosmological data was performed.\nHere we show that this has led to a misinterpretation (and underestimation) of\nthe imprint of quintessence on the distribution of large scale structures. To\nthis purpose we perform a likelihood analysis of the combined Supernova Ia\nUNION dataset and WMAP5-years data to identify realistic quintessence models.\nDifferences from the vanilla LambdaCDM are especially manifest in the predicted\namplitude and shape of the linear matter power spectrum, though these remain\nwithin the uncertainties of the SDSS data. We use these models as benchmark for\nstudying the clustering properties of dark matter halos by performing a series\nof high resolution N-body simulations. We find that realistic quintessence\nmodels allow for relevant differences of the dark matter distribution with the\nrespect to the LambdaCDM scenario well into the non-linear regime, with\ndeviations up to 40% in the non-linear power spectrum. Such differences are\nshown to depend on the nature of DE, as well as the scale and epoch considered.\nAt small scales (k~1-5 h Mpc^{-1}, depending on the redshift) the structure\nformation process is about 20% more efficient than in LambdaCDM.

Frame dragging is shown herein to\nbe a universal causal agent for producing multi-messenger emissions. We discuss\nhigh energy emissions produced by gravitational spin-orbit coupling along the\naxis of rotation and low energy emissions from surrounding matter via a torus\nmagnetosphere. Model results point to ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs)\nfrom supermassive black holes at about the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) energy\nthreshold from low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN), and to high-energy\nphoton emissions from stellar mass black holes in ultra-relativistic capillary\njets. The former compares favorably with recent results by the Pierre Auger\nObservatory (PAO). The latter compares favorably with gamma-ray burst data from\nthe High Energy Transient Exporer (HETE) II, {\\em Swift} and the Burst and\nTransient Source Experiment (BATSE), wherein a finite lifetime of black hole\nspin is found to improve the correlation between peak energies and true\nenergies in gamma-rays.

We conclude that long GRBs are spin powered, not\naccretion powered, from core-collapse supernovae and merger events such as\nGRB060614.

The control of transcription is the\nmost dominant type of regulation mediated by a complex of molecules such as\ntranscription factors. In general, regulatory molecules are of two types:\nactivator and repressor. Activators promote the initiation of transcription\nwhereas repressors inhibit transcription. In many cases, they regulate the gene\ntranscription on binding the promoter mutually exclusively and the observed\ngene expression response is either graded or binary. In experiments, the gene\nexpression response is quantified by the amount of proteins produced on varying\nthe concentration of an external inducer molecules in the cell. In this paper,\nwe study a gene regulatory network where activators and repressors both bind\nthe same promoter mutually exclusively. The network is modeled by assuming that\nthe gene can be in three possible states: repressed, unregulated and active. An\nexact analytical expression for the steady-state probability distribution of\nprotein levels is then derived. The exact result helps to explain the\nexperimental observations that in the presence of activator molecules the\nresponse is graded at all inducer levels whereas in the presence of both\nactivator and repressor molecules, the response is graded at low and high\ninducer levels and binary at an intermediate inducer level.\n","Comment: 12 pages, Accepted for publication in Physical Review E"]}]

The method we employ is\nbased on an exact renormalization group equation for the free energy. Truncated\nnonperturbative flow equations are derived at nonzero chemical potential and\ntemperature. Whereas the renormalization group flow leads to spontaneous chiral\nsymmetry breaking in vacuum, we find a chiral symmetry restoring first order\ntransition at high density. Combined with previous investigations at nonzero\ntemperature, the result implies the presence of a tricritical point with\nlong--range correlations in the phase diagram.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 2 figures, LaTex"]}]

Computing resources required to analyze these\ndata far exceed capabilities of any one institution. Moreover, the widely\nscattered geographical distribution of D0 collaborators poses further serious\ndifficulties for optimal use of human and computing resources. These\ndifficulties will exacerbate in future high energy physics experiments, like\nthe LHC. The computing grid has long been recognized as a solution to these\nproblems. This technology is being made a more immediate reality to end users\nin D0 by developing a grid in the D0 Southern Analysis Region (D0SAR),\nD0SAR-Grid, using all available resources within it and a home-grown local task\nmanager, McFarm. We will present the architecture in which the D0SAR-Grid is\nimplemented, the use of technology and the functionality of the grid, and the\nexperience from operating the grid in simulation, reprocessing and data\nanalyses for a currently running HEP experiment.\n","Comment: 3 pages, no figures, conference proceedings of DPF04 talk"]}]
