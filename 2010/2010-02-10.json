However, WLAN localization systems\nusually require constructing a radio map, which is a major barrier of WLAN\nlocalization systems' deployment. The radio map stores information about the\nsignal strength from different signal strength streams at selected locations in\nthe site of interest. Typical construction of a radio map involves measurements\nand calibrations making it a tedious and time-consuming operation. In this\npaper, we present the AROMA system that automatically constructs accurate\nactive and passive radio maps for both device-based and device-free WLAN\nlocalization systems. AROMA has three main goals: high accuracy, low\ncomputational requirements, and minimum user overhead. To achieve high\naccuracy, AROMA uses 3D ray tracing enhanced with the uniform theory of\ndiffraction (UTD) to model the electric field behavior and the human shadowing\neffect. AROMA also automates a number of routine tasks, such as importing\nbuilding models and automatic sampling of the area of interest, to reduce the\nuser's overhead. Finally, AROMA uses a number of optimization techniques to\nreduce the computational requirements. We present our system architecture and\ndescribe the details of its different components that allow AROMA to achieve\nits goals. We evaluate AROMA in two different testbeds. Our experiments show\nthat the predicted signal strength differs from the measurements by a maximum\naverage absolute error of 3.18 dBm achieving a maximum localization error of\n2.44m for both the device-based and device-free cases.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 17 figures"]}]
