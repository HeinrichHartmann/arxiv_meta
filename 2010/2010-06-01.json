A class of quantum many-body systems such as neutron\nmatter and cold Fermi gases share the same universal thermodynamic properties\nwhen interactions reach the maximum effective value allowed by quantum\nmechanics, the so-called unitary limit [1,2]. It is then possible to simulate\nsome astrophysical phenomena inside the highly controlled environment of an\natomic physics laboratory. Previous work on the thermodynamics of a\ntwo-component Fermi gas led to thermodynamic quantities averaged over the trap\n[3-5], making it difficult to compare with many-body theories developed for\nuniform gases. Here we develop a general method that provides for the first\ntime the equation of state of a uniform gas, as well as a detailed comparison\nwith existing theories [6,14]. The precision of our equation of state leads to\nnew physical insights on the unitary gas. For the unpolarized gas, we prove\nthat the low-temperature thermodynamics of the strongly interacting normal\nphase is well described by Fermi liquid theory and we localize the superfluid\ntransition. For a spin-polarized system, our equation of state at zero\ntemperature has a 2% accuracy and it extends the work of [15] on the phase\ndiagram to a new regime of precision. We show in particular that, despite\nstrong correlations, the normal phase behaves as a mixture of two ideal gases:\na Fermi gas of bare majority atoms and a non-interacting gas of dressed\nquasi-particles, the fermionic polarons [10,16-18].\n","Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures"]}]
