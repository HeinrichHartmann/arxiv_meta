Such extensions have been carried out along with the development of\nefficient methods for obtaining nondiffracting beams and pulses in the\nsubluminal, luminal and superluminal regimes[11-18]. This paper (partly a\nreview) addresses some theoretical methods related to nondiffracting solutions\nof the linear wave equation in unbounded homogeneous media, as well as to some\ninteresting applications of such waves. In section II we analyze the general\nstructure of the Localized Waves, develop the so called Generalized\nBidirectional Decomposition, and use it to obtain several luminal and\nsuperluminal (especially X-shaped) nondiffracting solutions of the wave\nequation. In section III we develop a space-time focusing method by a\ncontinuous superposition of X-Shaped pulses of different velocities. Section IV\naddresses the properties of chirped optical X-Shaped pulses propagating in\nmaterial media without boundaries. Finally, in Section V, we show how a\nsuitable superposition of Bessel beams can be used to obtain stationary\nlocalized wave fields, with a static envelope and a high transverse\nlocalization, and whose longitudinal intensity pattern can assume any desired\nshape within a chosen interval of the propagation axis.\n","Comment: Article (mainly a review) with 37 pages and 8 Figures.

We find that\nthere are two \"supersolidon\" longitudinal modes (one upper branch and one lower\nbranch) inside the ESS, while the transverse mode in the ESS stays the same as\nthat inside a ENS. We also work out various experimental signatures of these\nnovel elementary excitations by evaluating the Debye-Waller factor,\ndensity-density correlation, specific heat and vortex -vertex interactions. For\nthe meta-stable supersolid generated by photon pumping, we show that the angle\nresolved spectrum is dominated by the macroscopic super-radiance from its\nsuperfluid component, even it is just a very small percentage of the the whole\nsystem.
