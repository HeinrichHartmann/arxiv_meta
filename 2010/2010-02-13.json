In\nthis paper, we discuss singularities and several global properties of maximal\nsurfaces, and give explicit examples of such surfaces of arbitrary genus. When\nthe genus is one, our examples are embedded outside a compact set. Moreover, we\ndeform such examples to CMC-1 faces (mean curvature one surfaces with\nadmissible singularities in de Sitter 3-space) and obtain \"cousins\" of those\nmaximal surfaces.\n  Cone-like singular points on maximal surfaces are very important, although\nthey are not stable under perturbations of maximal surfaces. It is interesting\nto ask if cone-like singular points can appear on a maximal surface having\nother kinds of singularities. Until now, no such examples were known. We also\nconstruct a family of complete maximal surfaces with two complete ends and with\nboth cone-like singular points and cuspidal edges.\n","Comment: 36 pages, 12 figures"]}]
