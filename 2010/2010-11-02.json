Since much of\nthe cosmological information comes from scales affected by nonlinear\nclustering, measurements of the lensing power spectrum can be degraded by\nnon-Gaussian covariances. Recently there have been conflicting studies about\nthe level of this degradation. We use the halo model to estimate it and include\nnew contributions related to the finite size of lensing surveys, following\nRimes and Hamilton's study of 3D simulations. We find that non-Gaussian\ncorrelations between different multipoles can degrade the cumulative\nsignal-to-noise for the power spectrum amplitude by up to a factor of 2 (or 5\nfor a worst-case model that exceeds current N-body simulation predictions).\nHowever, using an eight-parameter Fisher analysis we find that the marginalized\nerrors on individual parameters are degraded by less than 10% (or 20% for the\nworst-case model). The smaller degradation in parameter accuracy is primarily\nbecause: individual parameters in a high-dimensional parameter space are\ndegraded much less than the volume of the full Fisher ellipsoid; lensing\ninvolves projections along the line of sight, which reduce the non-Gaussian\neffect; some of the cosmological information comes from geometric factors which\nare not degraded at all. We contrast our findings with those of Lee & Pen\n(2008) who suggested a much larger degradation in information content.

We discuss whether\nthis displays features that could have a physical meaning in terms of the\nproposed QPO models. METHOD: We consider the difference in rms amplitude\nbetween the upper and lower kHz QPOs, as a function of the frequency ratio R.\nWe compare two data sets. Set I is a collection taken from published data. Set\nII has rms amplitude values obtained by automatic fitting of continuous\nsegments of RXTE-PCA observations. RESULTS: For each of the six sources, we\nfind that there is a point in the R domain around which the amplitudes of the\ntwo twin kHz QPOs are the same. We find such a point located inside a narrow\ninterval R=1.5 +-3%. Further investigation is needed in the case of two sources\nto explore this finding, since we have not determined this point in Set II.\nThere is evidence of a similar point close to R = 1.33 or R = 1.25 in the four\nsources. We suggest that some of these points may correspond to the documented\nclustering of the twin kHz QPO frequency ratios. CONCLUSIONS: For the sources\nstudied, the rms amplitudes of the two kHz peaks become equal when the\nfrequencies of the oscillations pass through a certain ratio R, which is\nroughly the same for each of the sources. In terms of the orbital QPO models,\nwith some assumptions concerning the QPO modulation, this finding implies the\nexistence of a specific orbit at a common value of the dimensionless radius, at\nwhich the oscillations corresponding to the two peaks come into balance. In a\nmore general context, the amplitude difference behaviour suggests the possible\nexistence of an energy interchange between the upper and lower QPO modes.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 2 figures, proofreaded version"]}]

This alters the galaxy power spectrum in a way that is different for\nFourier modes parallel to and perpendicular to the line of sight.

If galaxy\norientations are affected only by the local tidal field, then the tidal\nalignment effect has exactly the same scale and angular dependence as the\nredshift space distortions in the linear regime, so it cannot be projected out\nor removed by masking small scales in the analysis.

The model is based on predator-prey\ninteractions between a host plants and their pathogens. Such interactions are\noften frequency-dependent, so that pathogen attack is focused on the most\nabundant plant phenotype, while rare plant types may escape pathogen attack.\nThus, frequency dependence can generate disruptive selection, which can give\nrise to speciation if distant phenotypes become reproductively isolated. Based\non recent experimental evidence from {\\it Arabidopsis}, we assume that at the\nmolecular level, incompatibility between strains is caused by epistatic\ninteractions between two proteins in the plant immune system, the guard and the\nguardee. Within each plant strain, immune reactions occur when the guardee\nprotein is modified by a pathogen effector, and the guard subsequently binds to\nthe guardee, thus precipitating an immune response. However, when guard and\nguardee proteins come from phenotypically distant parents, a hybrid's immune\nsystem can be triggered by erroneous interactions between these proteins even\nin the absence of pathogen attack, leading to severe autoimmune reactions in\nhybrids.

Using a Monte Carlo approach, we select the\nphysical parameters of the binary lens system, a star hosting a planet, and we\ncalculate the pixel-lensing light curve taking into account the finite source\neffects. Indeed, their inclusion is crucial since the sources in M31\nmicrolensing events are mainly giant stars. Light curves with detectable\nplanetary features are selected by looking for significant deviations from the\ncorresponding Paczy\\'{n}ski shapes. We find that the time scale of planetary\ndeviations in light curves increase (up to 3-4 days) as the source size\nincreases. This means that only few exposures per day, depending also on the\nrequired accuracy, may be sufficient to reveal in the light curve a planetary\ncompanion.

The spectrum should steepen and the\ncharacteristic frequency should increase, proportionally, with increasing\naccretion rate.

Thus the concept of an\nexact BH is in contradiction of QM and quantum gravity (QG). It is also\nreminded that the mass of a BH actually appears as an INTEGRATION CONSTANT of\nEinstein equations. And it has been shown that the value of this integration\nconstant is actually zero. Thus even classically, there cannot be finite mass\nBHs though zero mass BH is allowed. It has been further shown that during\ncontinued gravitational collapse, radiation emanating from the contracting\nobject gets trapped within it by the runaway gravitational field. As a\nconsequence, the contracting body attains a quasi-static state where outward\ntrapped radiation pressure gets balanced by inward gravitational pull and the\nideal classical BH state is never formed in a finite proper time. In other\nwords, continued gravitational collapse results in an \"Eternally Collapsing\nObject\" which is a ball of hot plasma and which is asymptotically approaching\nthe true BH state with M=0 after radiating away its entire mass energy.

In the first paper we presented the kinematic results from\nthe line modelling and reported fast outflows in the circumnuclear gas.

We find evidence for large\nelectron densities and high reddening in the nuclear regions, particularly in\nthe broader, blueshifted components. These results are consistent with the idea\nthat the young, recently triggered radio sources still reside in dense and\ndusty cocoons deposited by the recent activity triggering event. In addition,\nwe find that the quiescent nuclear and extended narrow components are\nconsistent with AGN photoionisation. For the nuclear broader and shifted\ncomponents the results are less clear. Whilst there are suggestions that the\nbroader components may be closer to shock plus precursor models on the\ndiagnostic diagrams (with high electron temperatures and densities), we are\nunable to unambiguously distinguish the dominant ionisation mechanism using the\noptical emission line ratios. This is surprising given the strong evidence for\njet-cloud interactions (broad emission lines, large outflow velocities and\nstrong radio-optical alignments), which favours the idea that the warm gas has\nbeen accelerated in shocks driven by the radio lobes expanding through a dense\ncocoon of gas deposited during the triggering event.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS - Full paper (including Appendices)\n  available at http://www.astron.nl/~morganti/Papers/Holt_MNRAS2009.ps"]}]

We call this the bouncing barrier which is an\nadditional obstacle during the already complex formation process of\nplanetesimals. The absence of the growth-fragmentation cycle and the halted\ngrowth has two important consequences for planet formation. 1) It is observed\nthat disk atmospheres are dusty throughout their lifetime. Previous models\nconcluded that the small, continuously produced fragments can keep the disk\natmospheres dusty. We however show that small fragments are not produced\nbecause bouncing prevents fragmentation. 2) As particles do not reach the\nfragmentation barrier, their sizes are smaller compared to the sizes reached in\nprevious dust models.

Particle engulfment involves\nparticle recognition by cell-surface receptors, signaling and remodeling of the\nactin cytoskeleton to guide the membrane around the particle in a zipper-like\nfashion. Despite the signaling complexity, phagocytosis also depends strongly\non biophysical parameters, such as particle shape, and the need for\nactin-driven force generation remains poorly understood. Here, we propose a\nnovel, three-dimensional and stochastic biophysical model of phagocytosis, and\nstudy the engulfment of particles of various sizes and shapes, including spiral\nand rod-shaped particles reminiscent of bacteria. Highly curved shapes are not\ntaken up, in line with recent experimental results. Furthermore, we\nsurprisingly find that even without actin-driven force generation, engulfment\nproceeds in a large regime of parameter values, albeit more slowly and with\nhighly variable phagocytic cups. We experimentally confirm these predictions\nusing fibroblasts, transfected with immunoreceptor FcyRIIa for engulfment of\nimmunoglobulin G-opsonized particles. Specifically, we compare the wild-type\nreceptor with a mutant receptor, unable to signal to the actin cytoskeleton.\nBased on the reconstruction of phagocytic cups from imaging data, we indeed\nshow that cells are able to engulf small particles even without support from\nbiological actin-driven processes. This suggests that biochemical pathways\nrender the evolutionary ancient process of phagocytic highly robust, allowing\ncells to engulf even very large particles.

R-duality is a\ngeneralization of the chiral-dual on shell symmetry of N=2 pure supergravity\nand of the R-symmetry of N=2 super Yang-Mills theory. Thanks to this, the\ntheory can be topologically twisted and topologically shifted, precisely as\npure N=2 supergravity, to yield a natural coupling of topological gravity to\ntopological Yang-Mills theory. The gauge-fixing condition that emerges from the\ntwisting is the self- duality condition on the gauge field-stength and on the\nspin connection. Hence our theory reduces to intersection theory in the\nmoduli-space of gauge instantons living in gravitational instanton backgrounds.\nWe remark that the topological Yang-Mills theory we obtain by taking the flat\nspace limit of our gravity coupled Lagrangian is different from the Donaldson\ntheory constructed by Witten. Whether this difference is substantial and what\nits geometrical implications may be is yet to be seen. We also discuss the\ntopological twist of the hypermultiplets leading to topological quaternionic\n$\\sigma$-models. The instantons of these models, named by us hyperinstantons,\ncorrespond to a notion of triholomorphic mappings discussed in the paper.\n","Comment: 44 pages, SISSA 217/92/EP"]}]

This exposition clarifies some points\nuntouched in earlier expositions. We then focus on the main ingredient in these\nattacks: Length functions.\n  After a self-contained introduction to Garside groups, we describe length\nfunctions induced by the greedy normal form and by the rational normal form in\nthese groups, and compare their worst-case performances.\n  Our main concern is Artin's braid groups, with their two known Garside\npresentations, due to Artin and due to Birman-Ko-Lee (BKL). We show that in\n$B_3$ equipped with the BKL presentation, the (efficiently computable) rational\nnormal form of each element is a geodesic, i.e., is a representative of minimal\nlength for that element. (For Artin's presentation of $B_3$, Berger supplied in\n1994 a method to obtain geodesic representatives in $B_3$.)\n  For an arbitrary number of strands, finding the geodesic length of an element\nis NP-hard, by a 1991 result of by Paterson and Razborov. We show that a good\nestimation of the geodesic length of a braid in Artin's presentation is\nmeasuring the length of its rational form in the \\emph{BKL} presentation. This\nis proved theoretically for the worst case, and experimental evidence is\nprovided for the generic case.\n"]}]
