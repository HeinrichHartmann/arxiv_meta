Traditionally, the most widely\nused schemes for 3D structure determination of an object are implemented by\nacquiring multiple measurements over various sample orientations, as in the\ncase of crystallography and tomography (1,2), or by scanning a series of thin\nsections through the sample, as in confocal microscopy (3).

We demonstrate that when the diffraction pattern of a finite object is\nsampled at a sufficiently fine scale on the Ewald sphere, the 3D structure of\nthe object is determined by the 2D spherical pattern. We confirm the\ntheoretical analysis by performing 3D numerical reconstructions of a sodium\nsilicate glass structure at 2 Angstrom resolution and a single poliovirus at 2\n- 3 nm resolution from 2D spherical diffraction patterns alone. Using\ndiffraction data from a soft X-ray laser, we demonstrate that ankylography is\nexperimentally feasible by obtaining a 3D image of a test object from a single\n2D diffraction pattern. This approach of obtaining complete 3D structure\ninformation from a single view is anticipated to find broad applications in the\nphysical and life sciences. As X-ray free electron lasers (X-FEL) and other\ncoherent X-ray sources are under rapid development worldwide, ankylography\npotentially opens a door to determining the 3D structure of a biological\nspecimen in a single pulse and allowing for time-resolved 3D structure\ndetermination of disordered materials.\n","Comment: 30 pages"]}]

If every\nintersecting pair does cross, the arrangement is affine. The number of regions\nformed by an arrangement of topological hyperplanes has the same formula as for\narrangements of affine hyperplanes.
