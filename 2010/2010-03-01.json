The Coulomb matrix is a central\ningredient in implementations of many-body perturbation theory, such as the\nHartree-Fock and GW approximations for the electronic self-energy or the\nrandom-phase approximation for the dielectric function. It is represented in\nthe mixed product basis, which combines numerical muffin-tin functions and\ninterstitial plane waves that are here expanded with the Rayleigh formula. The\nresulting algorithm is very efficient in terms of both computational cost and\naccuracy and is superior to an implementation with the Fourier transform of the\nstep function. In order to allow an analytic treatment of the divergence at k=0\nin reciprocal space, we expand the Coulomb matrix analytically around this\npoint without resorting to a projection onto plane waves. We then apply a basis\ntransformation that diagonalizes the Coulomb matrix and confines the divergence\nto a single eigenvalue. At the same time, response matrices like the dielectric\nfunction separate into head, wings, and body with the same mathematical\nproperties as in a plane-wave basis. As an illustration we apply the formulas\nto electron-energy-loss spectra for nickel at different k vectors including\nk=0.

Most of the lens galaxies are\npassively evolving early-type galaxies, with a few spirals. The colors, scale\nlengths, and ellipticities of lens galaxies are similar to those of the general\npopulation of early-type galaxies, although there may be a deficit of\napparently round lens galaxies produced by the inclination dependence of\nlensing cross sections. The projected mass distributions are aligned with the\nprojected light distributions to <~ 10 deg, except in the presence of a strong\nexternal tidal perturbation, suggesting that dark matter halos have orbits that\nare significantly modified by interactions with the baryonic component and are\nnot far out of alignment with the stars. Lens galaxies obey image\nseparation/lens luminosity correlations analogous to the Faber-Jackson and\nTully-Fisher relations, which are consistent with standard dark matter lens\nmodels. The lens galaxy mass-to-light ratios decrease with redshift as d(log\nM/L_B)/dz = -0.3\\pm0.1 (-0.5\\pm0.1) for Omega_0=1 (0.1), thus providing direct\nevidence of passive evolution for a sample of early-type galaxies in\nlow-density environments. The evolution-corrected mass-to-light ratios are\ngenerally larger than predicted by constant M/L dynamical models, although\nthere is significant scatter; with improved photometry, lens galaxy\nmass-to-light ratios would better distinguish between constant M/L and dark\nmatter models. These conclusions are limited primarily by the quality of lens\ngalaxy photometry.\n","Comment: 40 pages, 6 tables, 8 figures"]}]

Then, a\ndetailed parameter study delineates the influence of the disc viscosity and\npressure on the magnitude of the accretion rate.\n  We find that, even after the formation of a gap in the disc, the planet is\nstill able to accrete more mass from the disc. This accretion occurs from\nregions of the disc which are radially exterior and interior to the planet's\norbital radius. The rate depends on the magnitude of the viscosity and vertical\nthickness of the disc. For a disc viscosity alpha=10^{-3} and vertical\nthickness H/r=0.05 we estimate the time scale for the accumulation of one\nJupiter mass to be of order hundred thousand years. For a larger(smaller)\nviscosity and disc thickness this accretion rate is increasing(decreasing).\n  For a very small viscosity (alpha < 5 10^{-4}) the mass accretion rate\nthrough the gap onto the planet is markedly reduced, and the corresponding\naccretion time scale becomes larger than the viscous evolution time of the\ndisc.\n","Comment: 15 pages, Latex, uses MN Latex style v1.4, accepted by MN.

The planet is assumed to be\nin a circular orbit about the central star and is not allowed to migrate. A gap\nis formed about the orbit of the planet, but there is a nonaxisymmetric flow\nthrough the gap and onto the planet. The gap partitions the disk into an inner\n(outer) disk that extends inside (outside) the planet's orbit. For a 1 M_J\nplanet and typical disk parameters, the accretion through the gap onto the\nplanet is highly efficient. For typical disk parameters, the mass doubling time\nscale is less than 10^5 years, considerably shorter than the disk lifetime.\nFollowing shocks near the L1 and L2 Lagrange points, disk material enters the\nRoche lobe in the form of two gas streams. Shocks occur within the Roche lobe\nas the gas streams collide, and shocks lead to rapid inflow towards the planet\nwithin much of planet's Roche lobe. Shocks also propagate in the inner and\nouter disks that orbit the star. For higher mass planets (of order 6 M_J), the\nflow rate onto the planet is considerably reduced, which suggests an upper mass\nlimit to planets in the range of 10 M_J. This rate reduction is related to the\nfact that the gap width increases relative to the Roche (Hill sphere) radius\nwith increasing planetary mass. The flow in the gap affects planetary\nmigration. For the 1 M_J planet case, mass can penetrate from the outer disk to\nthe inner disk, so that the inner disk is not depleted. The results suggest\nthat most of the mass in gas giant planets is acquired by flows through gaps.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]
