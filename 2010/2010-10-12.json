The 3D shears $U(y,z)$ in a neighborhood of these oscillatory\nshears are linearly unstable too. Under the Navier-Stokes dynamics, these\noscillatory shears are not steady rather drifting slowly. When these\noscillatory shears are viewed as frozen, the corresponding Orr-Sommerfeld\noperator has unstable eigenvalues which approach the corresponding inviscid\neigenvalues when the Reynolds number tends to infinity.

In other words exploring the aberration effect may\ngive us a clue to the horizon-scale physics perhaps related to the cosmic\nacceleration. In this paper we develop a method to explore the dipole angular\nmodulation from the pixelized galaxy data on the sky properly taking into\naccount the covariances due to the shot noise and the intrinsic galaxy\nclustering contamination as well as the partial sky coverage.

The observed\ninflation sustains for 8.7 +/- 4.1 h, with the arcade rising from 1.15 +/- 0.06\nRsun to 1.36 +/- 0.07 Rsun within the EIT field of view (FOV). The rising speed\nis less than 5 km s-1 for most of the time. Only at the end of this\nquasi-static stage, it increases to tens of kilometers per second over tens of\nminutes. The arcade then erupts out of the EIT FOV as a CME with similar\nmorphology. This pre-CME structure is apparently unaffected by the flares\noccurring during its quasi-static inflation phase, but is closely coupled with\nthe flare occurring during its acceleration phase. For four events that were\nobserved on the disk, it is found that the gradual inflation of the arcade is\naccompanied by significant helicity injection from photosphere. In particular,\na swirling structure, which is reminiscent of a magnetic flux rope, was\nobserved in one of the arcades over 4 h prior to the subsequent CME, and the\ngrowth of the arcade is associated with the injection of helicity of opposite\nsense into the active region via flux emergence.

We investigate if the softness of bursts plays a role in the\nconventional classification of the objects. We employ the BATSE (Burst and\nTransient Source Experiment) catalog and analyze the duration distributions of\ndifferent groups of GRBs associated with distinct softness. Our analysis\nreveals that the conventional classification of GRBs with the duration of\nbursts is influenced by the softness of the objects. There exits a bimodality\nin the duration distribution of GRBs for each group of bursts and the time\nposition of the dip in the bimodality histogram shifts with the softness\nparameter. Our findings suggest that the conventional classification scheme\nshould be modified by separating the two well-known populations in different\nsoftness groups, which would be more reasonable than doing so with a single\nsample. According to the relation between the dip position and the softness\nparameter, we get an empirical function that can roughly set apart the\nshort-hard and long-soft bursts: $SP = (0.100 \\pm 0.028) T_{90}^{-(0.85 \\pm\n0.18)}$, where $SP$ is the softness parameter adopted in this paper.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 10 figures"]}]
