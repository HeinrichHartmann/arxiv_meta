In this\npaper, the first of a series describing and analysing this large data set, we\npresent the resulting stellar yields. Many of the models experience violent\nnuclear burning episodes not seen at higher metallicities. We refer to these\nevents as `Dual Flashes'. These events have also been reported by previous\nstudies. Some of the material processed by the Dual Flashes is dredged up\ncausing significant surface pollution with a distinct chemical composition. We\nalso analyse the yields in terms of C and N, comparing them to the observed\nCEMP abundances. At the lowest metallicities ([Fe/H] < -4.0) we find the yields\nto contain ~1 to 2 dex too much carbon, in agreement with all previous studies.\nAt higher metallicities ([Fe/H] = -3.0), where the observed data set is much\nlarger, all our models produce yields with [C/Fe] values consistent with those\nobserved in the most C-rich CEMPs. However it is only the low-mass models that\nundergo the Dual Shell Flash (which occurs at the start of the TPAGB) that can\nbest reproduce the C and N observations. Normal Third Dredge-Up can not\nreproduce the observations because at these metallicities intermediate mass\nmodels (M > 2 Msun) suffer HBB which converts the C to N thus lowering [C/N]\nwell below the observations, whilst if TDU were to occur in the low-mass (M < 1\nMsun) models (we do not find it to occur in our models), the yields would be\nexpected to be C-rich only, which is at odds with the `dual pollution' of C and\nN generally observed in the CEMPs.\n","Comment: 8 pages, Published in Astronomy & Astrophysics.

This has led\nnaturally to proposals that a correct approach is to instead use a type of\n\"generalized\" transverse momentum dependent factorization in which the basic\nfactorized structure is assumed to remain valid, but with transverse momentum\ndependent parton distribution functions that contain non-standard, process\ndependent Wilson line structures.

Since a proof of generalized transverse\nmomentum dependent factorization should apply generally to any hard\nhadro-production process, a single counter-example suffices to show that a\ngeneral proof does not exist. Therefore, to make the counter-argument clear and\nexplicit, we illustrate with a specific calculation for a double spin asymmetry\nin a spectator model with a non-Abelian gauge field.

The difficulty lies in the fact\nthat the space of all surface diffeomorphisms is a complicated functional\nspace, making exhaustive search for the best mapping challenging. To tackle\nthis problem, we propose a simple representation of bijective surface maps\nusing Beltrami coefficients (BCs), which are complex-valued functions defined\non surfaces with supreme norm less than 1. Fixing any 3 points on a pair of\nsurfaces, there is a 1-1 correspondence between the set of surface\ndiffeomorphisms between them and the set of BCs. Hence, every bijective surface\nmap can be represented by a unique BC. Conversely, given a BC, we can\nreconstruct the unique surface map associated to it using the Beltrami\nHolomorphic flow (BHF) method. Using BCs to represent surface maps is\nadvantageous because it is a much simpler functional space, which captures many\nessential features of a surface map. By adjusting BCs, we equivalently adjust\nsurface diffeomorphisms to obtain the optimal map with desired properties. More\nspecifically, BHF gives us the variation of the associated map under the\nvariation of BC. Using this, a variational problem over the space of surface\ndiffeomorphisms can be easily reformulated into a variational problem over the\nspace of BCs. This makes the minimization procedure much easier. More\nimportantly, the diffeomorphic property is always preserved. We test our method\non synthetic examples and real medical applications.

At such small excess energies, the ejectiles possess low\nrelative momenta and are predominantly produced with the relative angular\nmomentum equal to zero. Taking advantage of these conditions we have performed\ninvestigations aiming to determine the mechanism of the production of eta and\neta' mesons in the collision of hadrons as well as the hadronic interaction of\nthese mesons with nucleons and nuclei. In this proceedings we address the\nongoing studies of the spin and isospin dependence for the production of the\neta and eta' mesons in free and quasi-free nucleon-nucleon collisions. New\nresults on the spin observables for the vec(p)p --> pp eta reaction, combined\nwith the previously determined total cross section isospin dependence, reveal a\nstatistically significant indication that the excitation of the nucleon to the\nS11(1535) resonance, the process which intermediates the production of the eta\nmeson in the nucleon-nucleon interactions, is predominantly due to the exchange\nof the pi meson between the colliding nucleons.\n","Comment: Invited talk at MESON 2006: 9th International Workshop on Meson\n  Production, Properties and Interactions, Cracow, Poland, 9-13 Jun 2006"]}]

The N = 1 supersymmetric Born-Infeld action is a member of this\nfamily. Such dynamical systems have a more complicated structure, especially in\nthe presence of supergravity, as compared with well-studied effective\nsupersymmetric theories containing at most two derivatives (including nonlinear\nKahler sigma-models). As a result, when deriving their canonically normalized\ncomponent actions, it becomes impractical and cumbersome to follow the\ntraditional approach of (i) reducing to components; and then (ii) applying a\nfield-dependent Weyl and local chiral transformation. It proves to be more\nefficient to follow the Kugo-Uehara scheme which consists of (i) extending the\nsuperfield theory to a super-Weyl invariant system; and then (ii) applying a\nplain component reduction along with imposing a suitable super-Weyl gauge\ncondition. Here we implement this scheme to derive the bosonic action of\nself-dual supersymmetric electrodynamics coupled to the dilaton-axion chiral\nmultiplet and a Kahler sigma-model. In the fermionic sector, the action\ncontains higher derivative terms. In the globally supersymmetric case, a\nnonlinear field redefinition is explicitly constructed which eliminates all the\nhigher derivative terms and brings the fermionic action to a one-parameter\ndeformation of the Akulov-Volkov action for the Goldstino.
