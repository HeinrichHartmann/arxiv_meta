Such structure is often thought to pose a dynamical puzzle, because\ngrand-design spiral structure is traditionally interpreted as the result of\ndensity waves carried mostly in the stellar disk. Aims. Here we argue that the\nouter spiral arms in the cold gas outside the bright optical disk actually have\na natural interpretation as the manifestation of the mechanism that excites\ngrand-design spiral structure in the main, star-dominated body of the disk: the\nexcitation is driven by angular momentum transport to the outer regions,\nthrough trailing density waves outside the corotation circle that can penetrate\nbeyond the Outer Lindblad Resonance in the gaseous component of the disk.\n  Methods: Because of conservation of the density wave action, these outgoing\nwaves are likely to become more prominent in the outer disk and eventually\nreach non-linear amplitudes.

The method developed here can be used to\nstudy other physically-based choices for the halo distribution function and the\ncase of a disk accompanied by a bulge. In a preliminary investigation we note\nthe existence of a fine tuning between the scalelengths R_{\\Omega} and h,\nrespectively characterizing the rise of the rotation curve and the luminosity\nprofile of the disk, which surprisingly applies to both high surface brightness\nand low surface brightness galaxies. This empirical correlation identifies a\nmuch stronger conspiracy than the one required by the smoothness and flatness\nof the rotation curve (disk-halo conspiracy). The self-consistent models are\ncharacterized by smooth and flat rotation curves for very different\ndisk-to-halo mass ratios, hence suggesting that conspiracy is not as dramatic\nas often imagined. For a typical rotation curve, with asymptotically flat\nrotation curve at V_{\\infty} (the precise value of which can also be treated as\na free parameter), and a typical density profile of the disk, self-consistent\nmodels are characterized by two dimensionless parameters, which correspond to\nthe dimensional scales (the disk mass-to-light ratio M/L and the halo central\ndensity) of standard disk-halo decompositions.

At this point its evolution\ndramatically slows down, with an emptying time-scale proportional to 1/M_0,\nwhich significantly increases the disk's lifetime compared to the case with\nconstant viscosity. We show also that the disk's width scales like t^{1/4} with\nthe realistic viscosity model, while it scales like t^{1/2} in the case of\nconstant viscosity, resulting in much larger evolutionary time-scales in our\nmodel.

All categories of partial maps are restriction categories;\nconversely, a restriction category is a category of partial maps if and only if\nthe restriction idempotents split. Restriction categories facilitate reasoning\nabout partial maps as they have a purely algebraic formulation.\n  In this paper we consider colimits and limits in restriction categories. As\nthe notion of restriction category is not self-dual, we should not expect\ncolimits and limits in restriction categories to behave in the same manner. The\nnotion of colimit in the restriction context is quite straightforward, but\nlimits are more delicate. The suitable notion of limit turns out to be a kind\nof lax limit, satisfying certain extra properties.\n  Of particular interest is the behaviour of the coproduct both by itself and\nwith respect to partial products. We explore various conditions under which the\ncoproducts are ``extensive'' in the sense that the total category (of the\nrelated partial map category) becomes an extensive category. When partial\nlimits are present, they become ordinary limits in the total category. Thus,\nwhen the coproducts are extensive we obtain as the total category a lextensive\ncategory.
