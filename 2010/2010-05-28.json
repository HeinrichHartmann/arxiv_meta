Complex solutions to the classical\nequations of motion exhibit a remarkably analogous behavior. Furthermore,\nclassical solutions come in two varieties, which resemble the even-parity and\nodd-parity quantum-mechanical bound states. For the cubic potential, a quantum\nwave packet that is initially in the quadratic portion of the potential near\nthe origin will tunnel through the barrier and give rise to a probability\ncurrent that flows out to infinity. The complex solutions to the corresponding\nclassical equations of motion exhibit strongly analogous behavior. For the\nperiodic potential a quantum particle whose energy lies between -1 and 1 can\ntunnel repeatedly between adjacent classically allowed regions and thus execute\na localized random walk as it hops from region to region. Furthermore, if the\nenergy of the quantum particle lies in a conduction band, then the particle\ndelocalizes and drifts freely through the periodic potential. A classical\nparticle having complex energy executes a qualitatively analogous local random\nwalk, and there exists a narrow energy band for which the classical particle\nbecomes delocalized and moves freely through the potential.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 12 figures"]}]

We present an analysis strategy of reconstructing open charm\nmesons with ALICE via the hadronic decay of D0 and D* mesons. Heavy flavours,\nproduced at the The Large Hadron Collider, are excellent tools to investigate\nthe properties of the QCD medium produced in heavy-ion collisions. Baseline\nmeasurements of heavy flavour production mechanisms in pp collisions are\nnecessary in order to understand the production in the medium as well as medium\ninduced effects. The study shows that for one year of data taking we will be\nable to measure charmed mesons with very large significances (78 for D0 and 33\nfor D?). Both yields allow a measurement in one month of data taking (about 100\nmillion events) with a D? significance of 10. The reconstruction of the charged\nmesons is more difficult than for the neutral mesons due to kinematic\nconstraints on the soft pion in case of the D* decay. Most of these pions have\nmomenta lower than 0.4 GeV/c which makes them difficult to detect and therefore\nthe reconstruction efficiency is very low. However, by using the ALICE Inner\nTracking System as a standalone detector, the reconstruction efficiencies for\nkaons and pions at very low momenta are improved. Due to selection criteria\nimposed on the tracks the overall efficiency increase for the D* with the\nITS-standalone procedure is reported to be 7%. Note that after applying the\ncuts on the D mesons, the contamination with D0 from beauty decays becomes\nslightly larger (10%). For analyses where high efficiency is preferred over\nhigh purity, the cuts on the D* and D0 can be loosened in order to have as many\nparticles as possible. In this case, a review of the contamination from B\ndecays is needed.\n"]}]

In this analysis, we take into account the relevant\ncosmological and collider bounds, as well as electric dipole moment\nconstraints. In the unconstrained model, there are portions of the parameter\nspace yielding a large CP asymmetry at leading order (LO).

In the\nconstrained minimal supersymmetric standard model based on minimal\nsupergravity, we find that the decay rate is sensitive to the phase of the\nuniversal trilinear coupling.

Our statistical\nanalysis shows that a pure NSI mechanism is now ruled out at 99%, while the\nstandard nu_mu -> nu_tau OSC mechanism provides a quite remarkably good\ndescription of the anomaly. We therefore study an extended mechanism of\nneutrino propagation which combines both oscillation and non-standard\nneutrino-matter interactions, in order to derive limits on flavour-changing\n(FC) and non-universal (NU) neutrino interactions.

For large\nnumber of flavors these theories have two groups of vacua. The first exhibits\ndynamical breaking of flavor symmetry \\USp(2n_f) \\to U(n_f) and arises as a\nrelevant deformation of a non-trivial superconformal theory. These are in the\nconfined phase. The second group, in an IR-free phase with unbroken flavor\nsymmetry, is produced from a Coulomb branch singularity with Seiberg's dual\ngauge symmetry. In the large-\\mu regime both groups of vacua are well-described\nby dual quarks and mesons, and dynamical symmetry breaking in the first group\noccurs via meson condensation. We follow the description of these vacua from\nweak to strong coupling and demonstrate a nontrivial agreement between the\nphases and the number of vacua in the two regimes. We construct the\nsemiclassical monopole flavor multiplets and argue that their multiplicity is\nconsistent with the number of N=1 vacua.\n","Comment: 67 pages, harvmac; Typos corrected, section 4.1 reworded"]}]
