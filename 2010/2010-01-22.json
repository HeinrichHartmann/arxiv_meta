From these developments a number\nof different applications have spun off, most notably for biomedical imaging.\nBeyond hybrid pixels, a number of trends and possibilities with yet improved\nperformance in some aspects have appeared and presently developed to greater\nmaturity. Among them are monolithic or semi-monolithic pixel detectors which do\nnot require complicated hybridization but come as single sensor/IC entities.\nThe present state in hybrid pixel detector development for the LHC experiments\nas well as for some imaging applications is reviewed and new trends towards\nmonolithic or semi-monolithic pixel devices are summarized.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 16 figures"]}]

As a result, the differential\nequations of motion in Newtonian physics are replaced by functional\ndifferential equations, where the delay associated with the finite propagation\nspeed is taken into account. Newtonian equations of motion, with\npost--Newtonian corrections, are often used to approximate the functional\ndifferential equations. In ``On the origin of quantum mechanics'', preprint,\nphysics/0505181, May 2005, a simple atomic model based on a functional\ndifferential equation which reproduces the quantized Bohr atomic model was\npresented.
