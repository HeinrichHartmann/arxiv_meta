The spectrum shows prominent\nLyman-alpha absorption with N_HI = 10^(21.73 +/- 0.07) cm^-2 and a multitude of\nmetal lines at a common redshift of z=2.1062 +/- 0.0004, which we associate\nwith the redshift of the GRB. The metallicity derived from SII is log(Z/Z_sun)\n~ -1.9, one of the lowest values ever found in a GRB Damped Lyman-alpha (DLA)\nsystem. This confirms that the spread of metallicity in GRB-DLAs at z~2 is at\nleast two orders of magnitude. We argue that this spread in metallicity does\nnot require a similar range in abundances of the GRB progenitors, since the\nneutral interstellar medium probed by the DLA is expected to be at a\nsignificant distance from the explosion site. The hydrogen column density\nderived from Swift/XRT afterglow spectrum (assuming log(Z/Z_sun) ~ -1.9) is\napprox. 100 times higher than the N_HI obtained from the Lyman-alpha\nabsorptions. This suggests either a large column density of ionized gas or a\nhigher metallicity of the circum-burst medium compared to the gas traced by the\nDLA. We also discuss the afterglow light curve evolution and energetics. The\nabsence of a clear jet-break like steeping until at least 21 days post-burst\nsuggests a beaming corrected energy release of E_gamma>3.5x10^52erg, indicating\nthat GRB090926A may have been one of the most energetic bursts ever detected.\n","Comment: ApJ accepted for submission, revised for referee comments, 11 pages,\n  7 figures"]}]

As more and more people become the active users of\nonline social networks, one may ponder questions such as: (1) Do OSNs indeed\nimprove our sociability? (2) To what extent can we expand our offline social\nspectrum in OSNs? (3) Can we identify some interesting user behaviors in OSNs?\nOur work in this paper just aims to answer these interesting questions. To this\nend, we pay a revisit to the well-known Dunbar's number in online social\nnetworks. Our main research contributions are as follows. First, to our best\nknowledge, our work is the first one that systematically validates the\nexistence of the online Dunbar's number in the range of [200,300]. To reach\nthis, we combine using local-structure analysis and user-interaction analysis\nfor extensive real-world OSNs. Second, we divide OSNs users into two\ncategories: rational and aggressive, and find that rational users intend to\ndevelop close and reciprocated relationships, whereas aggressive users have no\nconsistent behaviors.

A King profile with a larger tidal radius produces a reasonable fit,\nhowever a power law with index -3 provides a better fit for radii > 20'. The\nexistence of UMi stars at large distances from the core of the galaxy, the\npeculiar morphology of the dSph within its tidal radius, and the shape of its\nsurface density profile all suggest that UMi is evolving significantly due to\nthe tidal influence of the Milky Way.

In this approach the partition function is approximated by\nrestricting the summation over all states to a (small) subclass which is chosen\nsuch as to well represent the important states. This procedure generalizes mean\nfield theory and can be systematically improved by including more states or\nfluctuations. We analyze in detail the simplest of these approximations which\ncorresponds to summing over states with local antiferromagnetic (AF) order. If\nin the states considered the AF order changes sufficiently little in space and\ntime, the path integral becomes a finite dimensional integral for which the\nsaddle point evaluation is exact. This leads to generalized mean field\nequations allowing for the possibility of more than one relevant saddle points.\nIn a big parameter regime (both in temperature and filling), we find that this\nintegral has {\\em two} relevant saddle points, one corresponding to finite AF\norder and the other without. These degenerate saddle points describe a phase of\nAF ordered fermions coexisting with free, metallic fermions.

Precisely, let $s$ be a proper\nrandom mass-partition i.e. a random sequence $(s_i, i\\in\\N)$ such that $s_1\\geq\ns_2\\geq ...$ and $\\sum_i s_i=1$ a.s. Consider ${W_i}_{i\\in\\N}$, an iid sequence\nof positive random variables with a density and such that $E[W^\\lambda]$ is\nfinite for all $\\lambda\\in\\R$. It is shown that if the law of $s$ is invariant\nunder a random multiplicative shift $s_i W_i$ of the atoms followed by a\nrenormalization, then it must be a mixture of Poisson-Dirichlet distribution\n$PD(a,0)$, $a\\in (0,1)$.\n","Comment: 8 pages; final version accepted for publication"]}]

For small initial population imbalances,\ncoherent superpositions of almost equally spaced energy eigenstates lead to\nJosephson oscillations. The suppression of tunneling at population imbalance\nbeyond a critical value is related to a high concentration of initial state\npopulation in the region of the energy spectrum with quasi-degenerate doublets\nresulting in imbalance oscillations with a very small amplitude. For\nunaccessible long times, however, the system recovers the regime of Josephson\noscillations.\n"]}]
