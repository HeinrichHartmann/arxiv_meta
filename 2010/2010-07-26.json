We show that in a singly charged\nsemiconductor quantum dot with inhomogeneous hyperfine coupling, the nuclear\nspins relatively strongly coupled to the electron spin form a polarized core\nduring the dynamical polarization process. The polarized core provides a\nprotection effect against the electron spin relaxation, reducing the decay rate\nby a factor of $N_1$, the number of the nuclear spins in the polarized core, at\na relatively small total polarization. This protection effect may occur in\nquantum dots and solid-state spin systems defect centers, such as NV centers in\ndiamonds, and could be harnessed to fabricate in a relatively simple way\nlong-lived qubits and quantum memories.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 3 color eps figures."]}]

The model reproduces the magnetic reconnection\nprocess just by given the right initial equlibrium conditions in the\nmagnetotail, without any assumption on the resistivity in the diffusive region.\nIn this model, the plasma is handled like two fluids with an interaction term,\neach one with distribution functions associated to a cubic lattice with 19\nvelocities (D3Q19). The electromagnetic fields are considered like a third\nfluid with an external force on a cubic lattice with 13 velocities (D3Q13). The\nmodel can simulate either viscous fluids in the incompressible limit or\nnon-viscous compressible fluids, and sucessfully reproduces both the Hartmann\nflow and the magnetic reconnection in the magnetotail. The reconnection rate\nobtained with this model is R=0.109, which is in excellent agreement with the\nobservations.\n","Comment: Submitted to PRE, Computational Physics. 11 pages and 9 figures"]}]
