Projected rotational velocities vsini are\nmeasured for about 120 of the sample stars. Differential rotation produces a\ncuspy line shape which is best measured in inverse wavelength space by the\nfirst two zeros of its Fourier transform. Rigid and differential rotation can\nbe distinguished for more than 50 rapid rotators (vsini > 12 km/s) among the\nsample stars from the available spectra. Ten stars with significant\ndifferential rotation rates of 10-54 % are identified, which add to the few\nknown rapid differential rotators.

The fundamental reason for this was attributed to a \"threshold\nsaturation\" phenomena derived by Kudekar, Richardson and Urbanke. In\nparticular, it was shown that the belief propagation (BP) threshold of the\nspatially coupled codes is equal to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding\nthreshold of the underlying constituent codes. In this sense, the BP threshold\nis saturated to its maximum value. Moreover, it has been empirically observed\nthat the same phenomena also occurs when transmitting over more general classes\nof BMS channels. In this paper, we show that the effect of spatial coupling is\nnot restricted to the realm of channel coding. The effect of coupling also\nmanifests itself in compressed sensing. Specifically, we show that\nspatially-coupled measurement matrices have an improved sparsity to sampling\nthreshold for reconstruction algorithms based on verification decoding. For\nBP-based reconstruction algorithms, this phenomenon is also tested empirically\nvia simulation.

When a solid body is\ndragged through a viscous fluid at constant velocity, the presence of a wall\nincreases fluid drag, and thus the net force required to maintain speed has to\nincrease. In contrast, recent optical trapping experiments have revealed that\nthe propulsive force generated by human spermatozoa is decreased by the\npresence of boundaries. Here, we use a series of simple models to analytically\nelucidate the propulsive effects of a solid boundary on passively actuated\nfilaments and model flagella. For passive flexible filaments actuated\nperiodically at one end, the presence of the wall is shown to increase the\npropulsive forces generated by the filaments in the case of displacement-driven\nactuation, while it decreases the force in the case of force-driven actuation.\nIn the case of active filaments as models for eukaryotic flagella, we\ndemonstrate that the manner in which a solid wall affects propulsion cannot be\nknown a priori, but is instead a nontrivial function of the flagellum\nfrequency, wavelength, its material characteristics, the manner in which the\nmolecular motors self-organize to produce oscillations (prescribed activity\nmodel or self-organized axonemal beating model), and the boundary conditions\napplied experimentally to the tethered flagellum. In particular, we show that\nin some cases, the increase in fluid friction induced by the wall can lead to a\nchange in the waveform expressed by the flagella which results in a decrease in\ntheir propulsive force.\n"]}]
