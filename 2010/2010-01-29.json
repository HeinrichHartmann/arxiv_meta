The\nstandard scenario to form planetary commensurabilities is convergent migration\nof two planets embedded in a protoplanetary disc. When the planets are\ninitially separated by a period ratio larger than two, convergent migration\nwill most likely lead to a very stable 2:1 resonance for moderate migration\nrates. To avoid this fate, formation of the planets close enough to prevent\nthis resonance may be proposed. However, such a simultaneous formation of the\nplanets within a small annulus, seems to be very unlikely.\n  Rapid type III migration of the outer planet crossing the 2:1 resonance is\none possible way around this problem. In this paper, we investigate this idea\nin detail. We present an estimate for the required convergent migration rate\nand confirm this with N-body and hydrodynamical simulations. If the dynamical\nhistory of the planetary system had a phase of rapid inward migration that\nforms a resonant configuration, we predict that the orbital parameters of the\ntwo planets are always very similar and hence should show evidence of that.\n  We use the orbital parameters from our simulation to calculate a radial\nvelocity curve and compare it to observations. Our model can explain the\nobservational data as good as the previously reported fit. The eccentricities\nof both planets are considerably smaller and the libration pattern is\ndifferent.

By mollifying the density of\nstates we obtain an approximate free energy and an adaptive bias potential that\nis computed directly from the population along the coordinates of the free\nenergy. Because of the mollifier, the bias potential is \"nonlocal\" and its\ngradient admits a simple analytic expression. A single observation of the\nreaction coordinate can thus be used to update the approximate free energy at\nevery point within a neighborhood of the observation. This greatly reduces the\nequilibration time of the adaptive bias potential. This approximation\nintroduces two parameters: strength of mollification and the zero of energy of\nthe bias potential. While we observe that the approximate free energy is a very\ngood estimate of the actual free energy for a large range of mollification\nstrength, we demonstrate that the errors associated with the mollification may\nbe removed via deconvolution. The zero of energy of the bias potential, which\nis easy to choose, influences the speed of convergence but not the limiting\naccuracy. This method is simple to apply to free energy or mean force\ncomputation in multiple dimensions and does not involve second derivatives of\nthe reaction coordinates, matrix manipulations nor on-the-fly adaptation of\nparameters. For the alanine dipeptide test case, the new method is found to\ngain as much as a factor of ten in efficiency as compared to two common\nadaptive biasing force formulations and it is shown to be as efficient as\nwell-tempered metadynamics with the post-process deconvolution giving a clear\nadvantage to the mollified density of states method.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 1 figure"]}]

In this review, I focus on the possible\ncentral engines of long-duration GRBs, and the constraints that present\nobservations place on these models. Long GRBs are definitively associated with\nthe deaths of massive stars, but whether the central engine is an accreting\nblack hole or a rapidly-spinning, highly-magnetized neutron star (a\n\"proto-magnetar\") remains unsettled. This distinction has been brought into\nparticular focus by recent MHD simulations of the core-collapse of massive,\nrotating \"collapsar progenitors,\" which suggest that powerful\nmagneto-centrifugal outflows from the proto-neutron star may stave off black\nhole formation entirely. Although both black hole and magnetar GRB models\nremain viable, I argue that the magnetar model is more mature in the sense that\nit provides quantitative explanations for the durations, energies, Lorentz\nfactors, and collimation of long GRB outflows. Given these virtues, one\npromising strategy to break the present stalemate is to further develop the\nmagnetar model until inescapable (and falsifiable) predictions emerge.

To\nachieve this, we made the first recorded attempt to discriminate BPs and\nfaculae, using a statistical classification approach based on Linear\nDiscriminant Analysis(LDA). This paper gives a detailed description of our\nmethod, and shows its application on high-resolution images of active regions\nto retrieve a center-to-limb distribution of BPs and faculae. Bright \"magnetic\"\nfeatures were detected at various disk positions by a segmentation algorithm\nusing simultaneous G-band and continuum information. By using a selected sample\nof those features to represent BPs and faculae, suitable photometric parameters\nwere identified in order to carry out LDA. We thus obtained a Center-to-Limb\nVariation (CLV) of the relative number of BPs and faculae, revealing the\npredominance of faculae at all disk positions except close to disk center (mu >\n0.9). Although the present dataset suffers from limited statistics, our results\nare consistent with other observations of BPs and faculae at various disk\npositions.
