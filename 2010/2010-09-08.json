Understanding how microscopic dynamics\ndetermines the averages and fluctuations of these currents is one of the main\nopen problems in nonequilibrium statistical physics. The additivity principle\nis a theoretical proposal that allows to compute the current distribution in\nmany one-dimensional nonequilibrium systems. Using simulations, we confirm this\nconjecture in a simple and general model of energy transport, both in the\npresence of a temperature gradient and in canonical equilibrium. In particular,\nwe show that the current distribution displays a Gaussian regime for small\ncurrent fluctuations, as prescribed by the central limit theorem, and\nnon-Gaussian (exponential) tails for large current deviations, obeying in all\ncases the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation theorem. In order to facilitate a given\ncurrent fluctuation, the system adopts a well-defined temperature profile\ndifferent from that of the steady state, and in accordance with the additivity\nhypothesis predictions. System statistics during a large current fluctuation is\nindependent of the sign of the current, which implies that the optimal profile\n(as well as higher-order profiles and spatial correlations) are invariant upon\ncurrenst inversion.

Gravitational energy fluctuations -- gravitons -- are\nresponsible for elastic scattering of subatomic particles. Such scattering\ncorresponds to complimentary force -- graviton scattering force -- arising in\ngravitational interaction in addition to Newtonian gravity. The strength of the\ngraviton scattering force is proportional to the graviton scattering\nprobability. Unlike Newtonian gravity the graviton scattering force follows the\n1/r law and dominates the former on cosmological scale in the limit of low\norbital accelerations. Similarly to Modified Newtonian Dynamics the quantum\ngravity accounts for variations in observed M/L ratios of diverse stellar\nsystems ranging from dwarf spheroid galaxies to X-ray galaxy clusters without\nrequiring an invisible matter (which is still required by MOND in X-Ray cluster\ncores). Unlike MOND the presented theory neither violates cornerstone Newton\nLaws nor suffers from the ambiguity of acceleration frames while enjoying vast\nexperimental evidence usually cited in favor of MOND. To ascertain the validity\nof the presented theory I have examined the predictions of quantum gravity for\ndwarf spheroid, ordinary and giant elliptic galaxies, and X-ray clusters. In\nall cases quantum gravity yields M/L ratios and scaling relations consistent\nwith observations. Quantum gravity accounts for the tilt of the Fundamental\nPlane of elliptical galaxies erasing the differences in M/L vs. luminosity\nrelations for faint and bright ellipticals, which cannot be easily explained by\nCDM model. Lastly, by analyzing the behavior of the gravitational energy\nfluctuations in the limit of high matter density expected in the early Universe\nI show that primordial inflation and dark energy (i.e. non-zero cosmological\nconstant) arise as natural effects of quantum gravity in the expanding\nUniverse.\n","Comment: 18 pages"]}]
