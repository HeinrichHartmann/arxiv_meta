Its X-ray spectrum is thermal, and is reproduced remarkably well by a\nblack-body, but its interpretation has remained puzzling. One reason is that\nthe source did not exhibit pulsations, and hence a magnetic field\nstrength--vital input to atmosphere models--could not be estimated. Recently,\nhowever, very weak pulsations were discovered. Here, we analyze these in\ndetail, using all available data from the XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray\nobservatories. From frequency measurements, we set a 2-sigma upper limit to the\nfrequency derivative of \\dot\\nu<1.3e-14 Hz/s. Trying possible phase-connected\ntiming solutions, we find that one solution is far more likely than the others,\nand we infer a most probable value of \\dot\\nu=(-5.98+/-0.14)e-16 Hz/s. The\ninferred magnetic field strength is 1.5e13 G, comparable to what was found for\nsimilar neutron stars. From models, the field seems too strong to be consistent\nwith the absence of spectral features for non-condensed atmospheres. It is\nsufficiently strong, however, that the surface could be condensed, but only if\nit is consists of heavy elements like iron. Our measurements imply a\ncharacteristic age of about 4 Myr. This is longer than the cooling and\nkinematic ages, as was found for similar objects, but at almost a factor ten,\nthe discrepancy is more extreme. A puzzle raised by our measurement is that the\nimplied rotational energy loss rate of about 3e30 erg/s is orders of magnitude\nsmaller than what was inferred from the H-alpha nebula surrounding the source.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables; accepted for publication in\n  Astrophysical Journal (Letters)"]}]

In this short note we\npoint out the consequences of the most straightforward embedding of this simple\npicture within low-energy SUSY, in which G_Dark breaking at the GeV scale\narises naturally through radiative corrections, or Planck-suppressed operators.\nThe theory predicts major additions to SUSY signals at the LHC. A completely\ngeneric prediction is that G_Dark particles can be produced in cascade decays\nof MSSM superpartners, since these end with pairs of MSSM LSP's that in turn\ndecay into the true LSP and other particles in the dark sector. In turn, the\nlightest GeV-scale dark Higgses and gauge bosons eventually decay back into\nlight SM states, and dominantly into leptons. Therefore, a large fraction of\nall SUSY events will contain at least two ``lepton jets'': collections of n>= 2\nleptons, with small angular separations and GeV scale invariant masses.\nFurthermore, if the Dark Matter sector is directly charged under the Standard\nModel, the success of gauge coupling unification implies the presence of new\nlong-lived colored particles that can be copiously produced at the LHC.\n","Comment: v2 references updated; added discussion of B-factory searches"]}]

In the case that each transmit\nantenna has its own power amplifier which has individual power limit, it has\nbeen known that only phase steering information is necessary to form the\noptimal transmit beamforming vector. Since temporal correlation exists for\nwireless fading channels, one can utilize the previous reported feedback\nmessages as prior information to efficiently encode the current feedback\nmessage. Thus, phase tracking information, difference between two phase\nsteering information in adjacent feedback slots, is sufficient as a feedback\nmessage.

At large separations, Y-shape flux-tube\nformation is observed. T-shaped paths are observed to relax towards a Y-shaped\ntopology, whereas L-shaped paths give rise to a large potential energy.
