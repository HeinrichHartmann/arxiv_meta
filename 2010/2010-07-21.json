It is shown that, if the zero point energies for\nthe cosmic microwave background and for all the rest of the universe that is\nnot cosmic microwave background are introduced into this model as two entities,\ntheir separate values appear within this theory in the form of a numerical\ndifference. It is this difference that gives the numerical value for the zero\npoint value of Einstein's dark energy density. Consequently, although the two\nzero point energies may be large, their difference can give the known small\ndark energy value from cosmology for dark energy density. Issues relating to\ninterpretation, calculation and measurement associated with this result and an\ninterpretation of dark energy as a measure of polarisation of the vacuum are\ndiscussed.

The existence of the Local Void (LV) has a systematic\neffect on these measurements. If the ZoA is randomly filled with mock galaxies,\nthen the calculated acceleration of the Local Group of galaxies (LG) has a\nspurious component, resulting from the lack of real galaxies in the\nintersection of the LV with the ZoA. This component affects both the\nmisalignment angle between the clustering dipole and the CMB dipole, and the\ninferred value of mean matter density Omega_m. We calculate the amplitude of\nthe spurious acceleration acting on the LG due to the LV. Its value depends on\nthe geometry and size of the LV, as well as on its density contrast. However,\nunder the simplest assumption of the LV being spherical and completely empty,\nwithin the linear theory this amplitude amounts only to about 45 km/s in units\nof velocity. The resulting change in the misalignment angle is smaller than 1\ndegree, and the fractional change in the deduced value of Omega_m is about 5%.\nAccounting for observationally indicated elongation of the LV and maintaining\nthe maximising assumption of a complete lack of galaxies inside increases these\nnumbers only moderately. Specifically, the amplitude of the spurious\nacceleration rises to about 60 km/s, the misalignment angle remains still\nsmaller than 1 degree, and the fractional change in the deduced value of\nOmega_m is enhanced to about 7%.

A particular class of\nmolecules will be directly observable; light diatomic hydrides and their ions\n(CH, OH, SH, NH, CH+, OH+, SH+, NH+). These simple constituents are important\nboth for the chemical evolution of the region and as tracers of high-energy\nradiation. If outflows of a forming star erode cavities in the envelope,\nprotostellar far UV (FUV; 6 < E_gamma < 13.6 eV) radiation may escape through\nsuch low-density regions. Depending on the shape of the cavity, the FUV\nradiation then irradiates the quiescent envelope in the walls along the\noutflow. The chemical composition in these outflow walls is altered by\nphotoreactions and heating via FUV photons in a manner similar to photo\ndominated regions (PDRs).\n  In this work, we study the effect of cavity shapes, outflow density, and of a\ndisk with the two-dimensional chemical model of a high-mass young stellar\nobject introduced in the second paper in this series.\n  We find that the shape of the cavity is particularly important in the\ninnermost part of the envelope, where the dust temperatures are high enough (>\n100 K) for water ice to evaporate. If the cavity shape allows FUV radiation to\npenetrate this hot-core region, the abundance of FUV destroyed species (e.g.\nwater) is decreased. In particular, diatomic hydrides and their ions CH$+, OH+\nand NH+ are enhanced by many orders of magnitude in the outflow walls due to\nthe combination of high gas temperatures and rapid photodissociation of more\nsaturated species. The enhancement of these diatomic hydrides is sufficient for\na detection using the HIFI and PACS instruments onboard Herschel. The effect of\nX-ray ionization on the chemistry is found to be small, due to the much larger\nluminosity in FUV bands compared to X-rays.\n","Comment: Accepted by ApJ. 23 pages, 10 figures.

The present work posits the possibility of building\nthis connection by postulating a Yukawa-like scalar potential, with non\ngravitational origin. This potential comes from a simple reflection speculate\nof the well-know potential of Yukawa and it is intended to describe the\nfollowing physics scenarios: null in very near solar system, slightly\nattractive in ranges of interstellar distances, very attractive in distance\nranges comparable to galaxies cluster, and repulsive to cosmic scales.
