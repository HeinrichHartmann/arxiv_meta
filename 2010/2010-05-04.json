In the study of spline\napproximation, wavelet analysis, time-frequency analysis, and sampling, there\nare many localized operators of non-convolution type whose stability is one of\nthe basic assumptions. In this paper, we consider the stability of those\nlocalized operators including infinite matrices in the Sj\\\"ostrand class,\nsynthesis operators with generating functions enveloped by shifts of a function\nin the Wiener amalgam space, and integral operators with kernels having certain\nregularity and decay at infinity. We show that the $\\ell^p$- stability (or\n$L^p$-stability) of those three classes of localized operators are equivalent\nto each other, and we also prove that the left inverse of those localized\noperators are well localized.\n"]}]

A similar result is obtained if we\nstart from the path integral expression of the partition function, an equation\nof motion is introduced. In both cases a parameter has to be identified with\nthe physical time. Several arguments are presented showing that it is so. By\ninvestigating the dynamics for short times we introduce an equilibrium\ncondition from which a natural unit of time appears. The equation of motion is\nextended to non equilibrium situations for which a H-theorem can be derived.\nThe equation of motion can be transformed into a quantum Smoluchovski equation,\nits solution is a probability having a clear physical meaning. The relaxation\nof this probability towards its equilibrium value requires a time during which\na thermodynamic description is possible or not. A standard bistable model is\ninvestigated and the chemical rate $k(t)$ is calculated as a function of time,\nit appears to be a non monotonic function of time. In some conditions the\nstationary value of $k(t)$ can be identified with the Kramers result. Finally\nwe compare our approach which is naturally irreversible with an analysis based\non the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation which is reversible.

A prototype chip is manufactured in hard,\ntransparent polymer with the ability to completely filter gas plugs out of a\nsegmented flow at rates up to 7.4 microliter/s per mm2 of membrane area.

The system has been successfully modeled and four necessary operating\ncriteria have been determined to achieve a complete separation of the gas from\nthe liquid. The first criterion is that the bubble length needs to be larger\nthan the channel diameter. The second criterion is that the gas plug should\nstay on the membrane for a time sufficient to transport all the gas through the\nmembrane. The third criterion is that the gas plug travel speed should be lower\nthan a critical value: otherwise a stable liquid film between the bubble and\nthe membrane prevents mass transfer.

In some applications, the signals of interest can have further\nstructure, so that they can be well approximated by a union of a small number\nof subspaces (e.g., face recognition and motion segmentation). This implies the\nexistence of a dictionary which enables block-sparse representations of the\ninput signals once its atoms are properly sorted into blocks.

In the social\ninteractions test, sociable behavior toward unfamiliar partner and exploratory\nactivity were dramatically decreased in defeated male mice. Avoidance of\napproaching partner was significantly increased. Demonstration of self-grooming\nbehavior was increased in defeated males. Chronic diazepam treatment (0.5\nmg/kg, i.p., 2 weeks) led to significant decrease of anxiety level estimated in\nthe elevated plus maze test and to improvement of communication in the\npartition test. In the social interaction test diazepam completely restored the\nlevel of sociability and exploratory activity and reduced avoidance behavior of\napproaching partner.

Furthermore, the MLE estimate is incompatible with error\nbars, so conclusions drawn from it are suspect. I propose an alternative\nprocedure, Bayesian mean estimation (BME). BME never yields zero eigenvalues,\nits eigenvalues provide a bound on their own uncertainties, and it is the most\naccurate procedure possible.
