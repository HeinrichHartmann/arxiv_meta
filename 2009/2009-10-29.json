Despite their distinct theoretical origin, due to a\nfundamental identity relating various of the ingredients appearing in their\nrespective definitions, the two effective charges are almost identical in the\nentire range of physical momenta, and coincide exactly in the deep infrared,\nwhere they freeze at a common finite value. Specifically, the dressing function\nof the ghost propagator is related to the two form factors in the Lorentz\ndecomposition of a certain Green's function, appearing in a variety of\nfield-theoretic contexts. The central identity, which is valid only in the\nLandau gauge, is derived from the Schwinger-Dyson equations governing the\ndynamics of the aforementioned quantities. The renormalization procedure that\npreserves the validity of the identity is carried out, and various relevant\nkinematic limits and physically motivated approximations are studied in detail.\nA crucial ingredient in this analysis is the infrared finiteness of the gluon\npropagator, which is inextricably connected with the aforementioned freezing of\nthe effective charges. Some important issues related to the consistent\ndefinition of the effective charge in the presence of such a gluon propagator\nare resolved. We finally present a detailed numerical study of a special set of\nSchwinger-Dyson equations, whose solutions determine the non-perturbative\ndynamics of the quantities composing the two effective charges.\n","Comment: 34 pages, 14 figures"]}]

The\ntransition from Fermi-liquid to non-Fermi-liquid behavior for decreasing hole\ndoping is studied as a function of Coulomb energy, next-nearest neighbor\nhopping, and temperature.

From the point\nof view of semiclassical analysis, our setting corresponds to performing the\nsemiclassical limit at times of order 1/h, as the characteristic wave-length h\nof the initial data tends to zero. It turns out that, in spite that for fixed h\nevery Wigner distribution satisfies a Liouville equation, their limits are no\nlonger uniquely determined by those of the Wigner distributions of the initial\ndata. We characterize them in terms of a new object, the resonant Wigner\ndistribution, which describes high-frequency effects associated to the fraction\nof the energy of the sequence of initial data that concentrates around the set\nof resonant frequencies in phase-space T^{*}T^{d}.

We characterize the correlations in the\ninitial state in terms of its quantum discord [H. Ollivier and W. H. Zurek,\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 88, 017901 (2001)]. We prove that initial states that have\nonly classical correlations lead to completely positive reduced dynamics. The\ninduced maps can be not completely positive when quantum correlations\nincluding, but not limited to, entanglement are present. We outline the\nimplications of our results to quantum process tomography experiments.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 1 figure"]}]
