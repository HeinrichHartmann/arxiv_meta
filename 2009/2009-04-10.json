The layers are\nsp2 hybridized honeycomb networks with strong in plane sigma and weaker pi\nbonds to the substrate and to the adsorbates. This hierarchy in bond strength\ncauses anisotropic elastic properties, where the sp2 layers are stiff in plane\nand soft out of plane. A corrugation of these layers imposes a third hierarchy\nlevel in bond energies, with lateral bonding to molecular objects with sizes\nbetween 1 and 5 nanometer. This extra bond energies are in the range of thermal\nenergies kT at room temperature and are particularly interesting for\nnanotechnology. The concomitant template function will be discussed. The\npeculiar bond hierarchy also imposes intercalation as another property of sp2\nlayer systems. Last but not least sp2 layer systems are particularly robust,\ni.e. survive immersion into liquids, which is a promise for sp2 layers being\nuseful outside ultra high vacuum. The Chapter shortly recalls the synthesis,\ndescribes the atomic and electronic structure, is followed by a discussion of\nproperties like intercalation and the use of sp2 layers on metals as tunneling\njunctions or as templates. The Chapter ends with an Appendix that summarizes\nthe basics of atomic and electronic structure of honeycomb lattices. Of course\nthe Chapter does not cover all aspects of sp2 single layers.

Utilizing this Green's function yields an explicit expression for\nthe vibrational mode density. Despite of its simplicity the model reflects some\ncharacteristics of the dynamics of a 1D exponentially graded elastic material.\nAs a special case the well-known expressions for the Green's function and\noscillator density of the homogeneous linear chain are contained in the model.\nThe width of the frequency band is determined by the grading parameter which\ncharacterizes the exponential spatial dependence of the properties. In the\nlimiting case of large grading parameter, the frequency band is localized\naround a single finite frequency where the band width tends to zero inversely\nwith the grading parameter.

The strain was\ngradually varied over a wide range from tensile to compressive by growing a\nseries of (Ga,Mn)As layers with 5% Mn on relaxed graded (In,Ga)As/GaAs\ntemplates with different In concentration. The hole density, the Curie\ntemperature, and the relaxed lattice constant of the as-grown and annealed\n(Ga,Mn)As layers turned out to be essentially unaffected by the strain.\nAngle-dependent magnetotransport measurements performed at different magnetic\nfield strengths were used to probe the magnetic anisotropy. The measurements\nreveal a pronounced linear dependence of the uniaxial out-of-plane anisotropy\non both strain and hole density. Whereas the uniaxial and cubic in-plane\nanisotropies are nearly constant, the cubic out-of-plane anisotropy changes\nsign when the magnetic easy axis flips from in-plane to out-of-plane. The\nexperimental results for the magnetic anisotropy are quantitatively compared\nwith calculations of the free energy based on a mean-field Zener model. An\nalmost perfect agreement between experiment and theory is found for the\nuniaxial out-of-plane and cubic in-plane anisotropy parameters of the as-grown\nsamples. In addition, magnetostriction constants are derived from the\nanisotropy data.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Physical Review B"]}]
