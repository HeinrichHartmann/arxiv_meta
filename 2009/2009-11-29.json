The linear\nconstraints, like mass conservation constraint, reversibility constraint,\nbiological capacity constraint, can be imposed on linear algorithms. However,\nrecently a non-linear constraint based on the second thermodynamic law, known\nas \"loop law\", has emerged and challenged the existing algorithms. Proven to be\nunfeasible with linear solutions, this non-linear constraint has been\nsuccessfully imposed on the sampling process.

The sampling method has also been employed to\noptimize a non-linear objective function, the Biomass synthetic rate, which is\nunified by the total income number of reducible electrons. To verify whether a\nsample contains internal loops, an automatic solution has been developed based\non solving a set of inequalities. In addition, a new type of pathway has been\nproposed here, the Futile Pathway, which has three properties: 1) its mass flow\ncould be self-balanced; 2) it has exchange reactions; 3) it is independent to\nthe biomass synthesis. To eliminate the fluxes of the Futile Pathways in the\nsampling results, a linear programming based method has been suggested and the\nresults have showed improved correlations among the reaction fluxes in the\npathways related to Biomass synthesis.\n","Comment: 31 pages including 13 figures and 1 table, in preparation"]}]

People have long before\nnoticed the weakness of the convex $l_1$-constraint (or the soft-thresholding)\nin wavelets and have designed many different forms of nonconvex penalties to\nincrease model sparsity and accuracy. But for a nonorthogonal regression\nmatrix, there is great difficulty in both investigating the performance in\ntheory and solving the problem in computation. TISP provides a simple and\nefficient way to tackle this so that we successfully borrow the rich results in\nthe orthogonal design to solve the nonconvex penalized regression for a general\ndesign matrix. Our starting point is, however, thresholding rules rather than\npenalty functions. Indeed, there is a universal connection between them. But a\ndrawback of the latter is its non-unique form, and our approach greatly\nfacilitates the computation and the analysis. In fact, we are able to build the\nconvergence theorem and explore theoretical properties of the selection and\nestimation via TISP nonasymptotically. More importantly, a novel Hybrid-TISP is\nproposed based on hard-thresholding and ridge-thresholding. It provides a\nfusion between the $l_0$-penalty and the $l_2$-penalty, and adaptively achieves\nthe right balance between shrinkage and selection in statistical modeling.

In particular, it presents a plausible\ndefinition of what a \"fractal group\" should be, and gives many examples of such\ngroups.\n  A particularly interesting class of examples, derived from monodromy groups\nof iterated branch coverings, or equivalently from Galois groups of iterated\npolynomials, is presented. This class contains interesting groups from an\nalgebraic point of view (just-non-solvable groups, groups of intermediate\ngrowth, branch groups,...), and at the same time the geometry of the group is\napparent in that a limit of the group identifies naturally with the Julia set\nof the covering map.\n  In its survey, the paper discusses finite-state transducers, growth of groups\nand languages, limit spaces of groups, hyperbolic spaces and groups, dynamical\nsystems, Hecke-type operators, C^*-algebras, random matrices, ergodic theorems\nand entropy of non-commuting transformations. Self-similar groups appear then\nas a natural weaving thread through these seemingly different topics.\n","Comment: about 75 pages, with many postscript figures"]}]
