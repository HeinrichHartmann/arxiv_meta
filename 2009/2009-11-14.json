In doing so we are able to\nexplicitly check previous conjectures about the behavior of this theory made by\nLuty, Schmaltz, and Terning. We then compare this to an analysis of the first\ntwo 'deconfined' dual descriptions based on the gauge groups Sp(2N_f+2) x\nSO(2N_c+5) and Sp(2N_f+2) x SO(4N_f+4) x Sp(2N_c+2), finding precise agreement.\nIn particular, we find no evidence for non-obvious accidental symmetries or the\nappearance of a mixed phase in which one of the dual gauge groups becomes free.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 2 figures; v2: added references to match JHEP version"]}]

Our control experiments on consumer-grade and\ndedicated-GPGPU hardware in a controlled environment found no errors. However,\nour survey over cards on Folding@home finds that, in their installed\nenvironments, two-thirds of tested GPUs exhibit a detectable, pattern-sensitive\nrate of memory soft errors.

Within\nthis context, the approach of choice for many researchers is the so-called\nreplicator equation, that describes mathematically the idea that those\nindividuals performing better have more offspring and thus their frequency in\nthe population grows. While very many interesting results have been obtained\nwith this equation in the three decades elapsed since it was first proposed, it\nis important to realize the limits of its applicability. One particularly\nrelevant issue in this respect is that of non-mean-field effects, that may\narise from temporal fluctuations or from spatial correlations, both neglected\nin the replicator equation. This review discusses these temporal and spatial\neffects focusing on the non-trivial modifications they induce when compared to\nthe outcome of replicator dynamics. Alongside this question, the hypothesis of\nlinearity and its relation to the choice of the rule for strategy update is\nalso analyzed. The discussion is presented in terms of the emergence of\ncooperation, as one of the current key problems in Biology and in other\ndisciplines.\n","Comment: Review, 48 pages, 26 figures"]}]
