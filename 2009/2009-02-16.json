Years worth of time\nordered data (TOD) from thousands of detectors will need to be compressed into\nmaps of the T, Q and U Stokes parameters. Fundamental to the science goal of\nthese experiments, the observation of B-modes, is the ability to control noise\nand systematics. In this paper, we consider an alternative to the\nmaximum-likelihood method, called destriping, where the noise is modelled as a\nset of discrete offset functions and then subtracted from the time-stream. We\ncompare our destriping code (Descart: the DEStriping CARTographer) to a full\nmaximum-likelihood map-maker, applying them to 200 Monte-Carlo simulations of\ntime-ordered data from a ground based, partial-sky polarisation modulation\nexperiment. In these simulations, the noise is dominated by either detector or\natmospheric 1/f noise. Using prior information of the power spectrum of this\nnoise, we produce destriped maps of T, Q and U which are negligibly different\nfrom optimal. The method does not filter the signal or bias the E or B-mode\npower spectra. Depending on the length of the destriping baseline, the method\ndelivers between 5 and 22 times improvement in computation time over the\nmaximum-likelihood algorithm. We find that, for the specific case of single\ndetector maps, it is essential to destripe the atmospheric 1/f in order to\ndetect B-modes, even though the Q and U signals are modulated by a half-wave\nplate spinning at 5-Hz.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 17 figures, MNRAS accepted v2: content added (inc: table\n  2), typos corrected"]}]

We implement observationally-normalized\nrelations between dark matter halo mass, stellar mass, and cold gas mass to\nexplore these mappings, with specific emphasis on the correlation between\ndifferent definitions of a major galaxy merger. We always define a major merger\nby a mass ratio m/M>0.3, but allow the masses used to compute this ratio to be\ndefined in one of three ways: dark matter halo masses, galaxy stellar masses,\nor galaxy baryonic masses (stars and cold gas). We find that the merger ratio\nassigned to any particular merger event depends strongly on which of these\nmasses is used, with the mapping between different mass ratio definitions\nshowing strong evolution with halo mass and redshift. For example, major dark\nmatter mergers (>0.3) in small galaxies (M_DM < 10^11 Msun) typically\ncorrespond to very minor stellar mergers (<1/20). These mergers contain\nsignificant dark matter mass, and should cause noticable morphological\ndisruption to the primary galaxy, even though there is no observable bright\ncompanion. In massive galaxies, there is an opposite effect, with bright\ncompanion galaxies corresponding to only minor dark matter mergers.

Method: We analyse a 48h high-resolution time sequence of the quiet Sun\nphotosphere at the disk center obtained with the Solar Optical Telescope\nonboard Hinode. The observations, which have a field of view of 100\n\\arcsec$\\times$ 100 \\arcsec, typically contain four supergranules.

The\n3 sigma upper limit on the effective temperature of the ionizing star is 42500\nK. We favor a luminosity appropriate for star with a mass in excess of about 60\nsolar masses. The limit on the temperature and luminosity exclude stars on the\nZAMS and stars within 10^6 yr of the ZAMS. Since the age of the UC HII region\nis estimated to be only about 10^5 yr, we suggest that this is direct evidence\nthat the stellar birth line for massive stars at twice solar metallicity must\nbe significantly redder than the ZAMS.\n","Comment: 42 pages; LaTex; 11 Postscript figures; accepted for publication in\n  ApJ"]}]

SN 1989B in\n  NGC 3627"],"description":["  (Abridged) Repeated imaging observations have been made of NGC 3627 with the\nHST in 1997/98, over an interval of 58 days. Images were obtained on 12 epochs\nin the F555W band and on five epochs in the F814W band. The galaxy hosted the\nprototypical, `Branch normal', type Ia supernova SN 1989B. A total of 83\nvariables have been found, of which 68 are definite Cepheid variables with\nperiods ranging from 75 days to 3.85 days. The de-reddened distance modulus is\ndetermined to be (m-M)_0= 30.22+/-0.12 (internal uncertainty) using a subset of\nthe Cepheid data whose reddening and error parameters are secure.\n  The photometric data of Wells et al. (1994), combined with the Cepheid data\nfor NGC 3627 give M_B(max)= -19.36+/-0.18 and M_V(max)= -19.34+/-0.16 for SN\n1989B. Combined with the previous six calibrations in this program, plus two\nadditional calibrations determined by others gives the mean absolute magnitudes\nat maximum of <M_B>= -19.48+/-0.07 and <M_V>= -19.48 +/-0.07 for `Branch\nnormal' SNe Ia at this interim stage in the calibration program.\n  The second parameter correlations of M(max) of blue SNe Ia with decay rate,\ncolor at maximum, and Hubble type are re-investigated. The dependence of\n<M(max)> on decay rate is non-linear, showing a minimum for decay rates between\n1.0< Delta m_15 <1.6. Magnitudes corrected for decay rate show no dependence on\nHubble type, but a dependence on color remains. Correcting both the fiducial\nsample of 34 SNe Ia with decay-rate data and the current 8 calibrating SNe Ia\nfor the correlation with decay rate as well as color gives H_0= 60+/-2\n(internal) km/s/Mpc, in both B and V. The same value to within 4% is obtained\nif only the SNe Ia in spirals (without second parameter corrections) are\nconsidered.\n","Comment: 32 pages (with 7 tables and 14 figures) LaTeX, uses emulateapj.sty; a\n  full-resolution version with complete figs. 4 and 5 is available at\n  http://www.astro.unibas.ch/cosmology/papers.html ; accepted for publication\n  in ApJ"]}]
