Via the $L_1$\npolynomial regression algorithm of Kalai et al. \\cite{KKMS:08}, our bounds on\nGaussian and Boolean noise sensitivity yield polynomial-time agnostic learning\nalgorithms for the broad class of constant-degree PTFs under these input\ndistributions.\n  The main ingredients used to obtain our bounds on both average and noise\nsensitivity of PTFs in the Gaussian setting are tail bounds and\nanti-concentration bounds on low-degree polynomials in Gaussian random\nvariables \\cite{Janson:97,CW:01}. To obtain our bound on the Boolean average\nsensitivity of PTFs, we generalize the ``critical-index'' machinery of\n\\cite{Servedio:07cc} (which in that work applies to halfspaces, i.e. degree-1\nPTFs) to general PTFs. Together with the \"invariance principle\" of\n\\cite{MOO:05}, this lets us extend our techniques from the Gaussian setting to\nthe Boolean setting. Our bound on Boolean noise sensitivity is achieved via a\nsimple reduction from upper bounds on average sensitivity of Boolean PTFs to\ncorresponding bounds on noise sensitivity.\n","Comment: added proofs for non-multilinear PTFs over Gaussian random variables,\n  added discussion section"]}]

The principal result of this study is that the great majority of the\nbands in the catalog are very weak and fairly narrow.

Examples are integral and attached membrane proteins, viruses, and\nlipid domains. We propose an analytical model to study budding and vesiculation\nof the lipid bilayer membrane, which is based on the membrane bending energy\nand the translational entropy of the inclusions. If the inclusions are placed\non a membrane with similar curvature radius, their repulsive membrane-mediated\ninteraction is screened. Therefore, for high inclusion density the inclusions\naggregate, induce bud formation, and finally vesiculation. Already with the\nbending energy alone our model allows the prediction of bud radii. However, in\ncase the inclusions induce a single large vesicle to split into two smaller\nvesicles, bending energy alone predicts that the smaller vesicles have\ndifferent sizes whereas the translational entropy favors the formation of\nequal-sized vesicles. Our results agree well with those of recent computer\nsimulations.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 12 figures"]}]

The numerical method is based on\nan immersed boundary method (Kim et al., 2001).

A strong downward motion\ninduced by this vortex decreases the lift force in the following downstroke\n(Kweon and Choi, 2008). When the fore-wing leads the hind-wing (phi=90 degree),\nthe hind-wing is submerged in the vortices generated by the fore-wing and\nsuffers from their induced downwash flow throughout the downstroke, resulting\nin a significant reduction of lift force. On the other hand, when the hind-wing\nleads the fore-wing (phi=-90 degree), the e-WTV is found only near the start of\nhind-wing upstroke.

These\nviolations are most pronounced for correlations for a pair of qubits,\nconditioned on specific measurement results for the remaining (N-2) qubits. The\nconsiderations provide us with a qualitative difference between the W state and\nGHZ state in the situation when they are separately sent via depolarizing\nchannels. For sufficiently high amount of noise in the depolarizing channel,\nthe GHZ states cannot produce a distillable state between two qubits, whereas\nthe W states can still produce a distillable state in a similar situation.\n","Comment: v3: 7 pages, 2 figures, REVTeX4; v2: result on comparative yield of\n  singlets added, 1 new figure"]}]
