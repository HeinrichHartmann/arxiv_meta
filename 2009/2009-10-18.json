Cand\\`{e}s and Tao showed that sparse reconstruction is\npossible if the sensing matrix acts as a near isometry on all\n$\\boldsymbol{k}$-sparse signals. This property holds with overwhelming\nprobability if the entries of the matrix are generated by an iid Gaussian or\nBernoulli process. There has been significant recent interest in an alternative\nsignal processing framework; exploiting deterministic sensing matrices that\nwith overwhelming probability act as a near isometry on $\\boldsymbol{k}$-sparse\nvectors with uniformly random support, a geometric condition that is called the\nStatistical Restricted Isometry Property or StRIP. This paper considers a\nfamily of deterministic sensing matrices satisfying the StRIP that are based on\n\\srm codes (binary chirps) and a $\\boldsymbol{k}$-sparse reconstruction\nalgorithm with sublinear complexity. In the presence of stochastic noise in the\ndata domain, this paper derives bounds on the $\\boldsymbol{\\ell_2}$ accuracy of\napproximation in terms of the $\\boldsymbol{\\ell_2}$ norm of the measurement\nnoise and the accuracy of the best $\\boldsymbol{k}$-sparse approximation, also\nmeasured in the $\\boldsymbol{\\ell_2}$ norm.
