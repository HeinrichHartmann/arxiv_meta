We report on these\nobservations which, for the first time, allow us to study the broad-band\nspectrum from soft to hard X-rays of this source. No X-ray spectral information\nwas available on this source before the Swift monitoring. The spectrum can be\ndeconvolved well with models usually adopted to describe the emission from High\nMass X-ray Binary X-ray pulsars, and is characterized by a very high\nabsorption, a flat power law (photon index ~0.1-0.5) and a cutoff at about 7-12\nkeV. Alternatively, the SAXJ1818.6-1703 emission can be described with a\nComptonized emission from a cold and optically thick corona, with an electron\ntemperature kTe=5-7 keV, a hot seed photon temperature, kT0, of 1.3-1.4 keV,\nand an optical depth for the Comptonizing plasma of about 10. The 1-100 keV\nluminosity at the peak of the flare is 3E36 erg/s (assuming the optical\ncounterpart distance of 2.5 kpc). These properties of SAXJ1818.6-1703 resemble\nthose of the prototype of the SFXT class, XTEJ1739-302. The monitoring with\nSwift/XRT reveals an outburst duration of about 5 days, similarly to other\nmembers of the class of SFXTs, confirming SAXJ1818.6-1703 as a member of this\nclass.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS.
