Inverse problems are those where a set of measured data is\nanalysed in order to get as much information as possible on a model which is\nassumed to represent a system in the real world. We study two inverse problems\nin the fields of classical and quantum physics: QCD condensates from tau-decay\ndata and the inverse conductivity problem. We use a functional method which\nallows us to extract within rather general assumptions phenomenological\nparameters of QCD (the condensates) from a comparison of the time-like\nexperimental data with asymptotic space-like results from theory. The price to\nbe paid for the generality of assumptions is relatively large errors in the\nvalues of the extracted parameters. Although we do not claim that our method is\nsuperior to other approaches, we hope that our results lend additional\nconfidence to the numerical results obtained with the help of methods based on\nQCD sum rules. In this thesis, also two approaches of EIT image reconstruction\nare proposed. The first is based on reformulating the inverse problem in terms\nof integral equations. This method uses only a single set of measurements for\nthe reconstruction. The second approach is an algorithm based on linearisation\nwhich uses more then one set of measurements. A promising result is that one\ncan qualitatively reconstruct the conductivity inside the cross-section of a\nhuman chest.
