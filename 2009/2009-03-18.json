Over an\nensemble of universes the true CMB and foreground are indeed expected to be\nuncorrelated, but any particular sky pattern (such as the one we happen to\nobserve) will generate non-zero measured correlations simply by chance. We call\nthis effect \"cosmic covariance\" and it is a possible source of bias in the CMB\nmaps cleaned using the MVO technique. We show that the presence of cosmic\ncovariance is expected to artificially suppress the variance of the Internal\nLinear Combination (ILC) map obtained via MVO. It also propagates into the\nmultipole expansion of the ILC map, generating a quadrupole deficit with more\nthan 90% confidence. Since we do not know the CMB and the foregrounds a priori,\nthere is therefore an unknown contribution to the uncertainty in the measured\nquadrupole power, over and above the usual cosmic variance contribution. Using\nthe MVO on a series of Monte Carlo simulations that assume Gaussian CMB\nfluctuations, we estimate that the real quadrupole power of the CMB lies in the\nrange [305.16,400.40] microKelvin^2 (at the 1-sigma level).\n","Comment: 3 figures, submitted to ApJ"]}]

In a\ncase of frogs, described in the paper, two parental species - Rana lessonae and\nRana ridibunda can form fertile hybrid individuals - Rana esculenta. Hybrid\nindividuals eliminate one parental haplotype from their germ line cells before\nmeiosis (end before recombination) which implicates clonal reproduction of the\nhaplotype transferred to the gametes. All three \"species\" are called \"complex\nspecies\". To study the evolution of genomes in the hybridogenetic fraction of\nthis complex species we have used the Monte Carlo based model rendering the age\nstructured populations. The model enables the analysis of distribution of\ndefective alleles in the individual genomes as well as in the genetic pool of\nthe whole populations.\n  Results: We have shown that longer isolation of hybrids' populations leads to\nthe speciation through emerging the specific sets of complementing haplotypes\nin their genetic pool. The fraction of defective alleles increases but the\ndefects are complemented in the heterozygous loci. Nevertheless, even small\nsupply of new hybrids generated by the two parental species or crossbreeding\nbetween hybrids and one of the parental species prevents the speciation and\nchanges the strategy of the genome evolution from the complementing to the\npurifying Darwinian selection.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 5 figures"]}]

Using CCD observations our results corroborate\nthe accuracy of the photometry of both catalogs, which have an overall\ndispersion of about 0.2 mag in the range 17 <= b_J <= 21.5. The SSC presents\nexternally calibrated galaxy magnitudes that follow a linear relation, while\nthe APM instrumental magnitudes of galaxies, only internally calibrated by the\nuse of stellar profiles, require second-order corrections. The completeness of\nboth catalogs in a general field falls rapidly fainter than b_J = 20.0, being\nslightly better for APM. The 90% completeness level of the SSC is reached\nbetween b_J = 19.5 and 20.0, while for APM this happens between b_J = 20.5 and\n21.0. Both SSC and APM are found to be less complete in a galaxy cluster field.\nGalaxies misclassified as stars in the SSC receive an incorrect magnitude\nbecause the stellar ones take saturation into account besides using a different\ncalibration curve. In both cases, the misclassified galaxies show a large\ndiversity of colors that range from typical colors of early-types to those of\nblue star-forming galaxies. A possible explanation for this effect is that it\nresults from the combination of low sampling resolutions with properties of the\nimage classifier for objects with characteristic sizes close to the\ninstrumental resolution. We find that the overall contamination by stars\nmisclassified as galaxies is < 5% to b_J = 20.5, as originally estimated for\nboth catalogs. Although our results come from small areas of the sky, they are\nextracted from two different plates and are based on the comparison with two\nindependent datasets.\n","Comment: 14 pages of text and tables, 8 figures; to be published in the\n  Astronomical Journal; for a single postscript version file see\n  ftp://danw.on.br/outgoing/caretta/caretta.ps"]}]
