Considering an (anti-)D3-brane\nsitting at the throat tip as a prototype standard model brane, we show that the\nbrane's position in the isometry directions can play the role of curvatons. The\nbasic picture is that the fluctuations of the (anti-)D3-brane in the angular\nisometry directions during inflation eventually turns into the primordial\ncurvature perturbations, and subsequently the brane's oscillation excites other\nopen string modes on the brane and reheat the universe. We find in the explicit\ncase of the KS throat that a wide range of parameters allows a consistent\ncurvaton scenario.

In this paper we use the\nJeans equation to argue that (1) and (2) cannot both be true at all radii. We\nexamine the implied radial dependence of rho/sigma3 over 12 orders of magnitude\nin radius by solving the Jeans equation for a broad range of input rho and\nvelocity anisotropy beta. Independent of beta, we find that rho/sigma3 is\napproximately a power law only over the limited range of halo radius resolvable\nby current simulations (down to ~0.1% of the virial radius), and rho/sigma3\ndeviates significantly from a power-law below this scale for both the Einasto\nand NFW rho.

Conversely, when we enforce\nrho/sigma^3 r^{-eta} as an input, none of the physically allowed rho (occurring\nfor the narrow range 1.8<eta<1.9444) follows the Einasto form. We expect the\nnext generation simulations with better spatial resolution to settle the\ndebate: either the Einasto profile will continue to hold and rho/sigma3 will\ndeviate from a power law, or rho/sigma3 will continue as a power law and rho\nwill deviate from its current parameterizations.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures"]}]
