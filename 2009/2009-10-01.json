A\none-dimensional cascade develops along the line-of-sight if the deflections of\npairs induced by the surrounding magnetic field can be neglected.

We are able to prove local existence and\nuniqueness of solution to the geodesic equation for both kinds of Sobolev\nmetrics.\n  We are interested in all conserved quantities, so the paper starts with the\nHamiltonian setting and computes conserved momenta and geodesics in general on\nthe space of immersions. For each metric we compute the geodesic equation on\nshape space. In the end we sketch in some examples the differences between\nthese metrics.\n","Comment: 46 pages, some misprints corrected"]}]
