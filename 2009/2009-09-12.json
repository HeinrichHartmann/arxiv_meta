Pressure application leads to a\ntransitional change from a spin-gapped state to a Fermi-liquid state at\ntemperatures higher than $T_c$. The relaxation rate $1/T_1$ shows\nactivated-type behavior at an onset pressure, whereas Korringa-like behavior\nbecomes predominant at the optimal pressure, suggesting that an increase in the\ndensity of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy leads to enhancement of $T_c$.\nNuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectra suggest that pressure application\ncauses transfer of holes from the chain to the ladder sites. The transfer of\nholes increases DOS below the optimal pressure. A dome-shaped $T_c$ versus\npressure curve arises from naive balance between the transfer of holes and\nbroadening of the band width.\n"]}]

This model is general enough to accommodate\nstray-photon noise along the propagation, as well as amplitude attenuation. An\nexplicit analytical expression for the density matrix as a function of\npropagation distance is obtained for completely general input states with\nbounded photon number in each mode. The result is analyzed numerically for\nvarious examples of input states. For N00N state input, the loss of coherence\nand entanglement is super exponential as predicted by a number of previous\nstudies. However, for generic input states, where the coefficients are\ngenerated randomly, the decay of coherence is very different; in fact no worse\nthan the classical Beer-Lambert law. More surprisingly, there is a plateu at a\nmid-range interval in propagation distance where the loss is in fact\nsub-classical, following which it resumes the classical rate. The qualitative\nbehavior of the decay of entanglement for two-mode propagation is also analyzed\nnumerically for ensembles of random states using the behavior of negativity as\na function of propagation distance.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 6 eps figures"]}]
