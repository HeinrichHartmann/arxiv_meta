By using a derivative expansion of the response functions, we derive\nthe most general form of this Lagrangian at the next to leading order in the\nmomentum expansion in terms of four coefficient functions. This involves the\nelimination of all the higher order time derivatives by careful use of the\nleading order field equations. In the infinite scattering length limit where\nconformal invariance is realized, we show that the effective Lagrangian must\ncontain an unnoticed invariant combination of higher spatial gradients of the\nGoldstone mode, while explicit couplings to spatial gradients of the trapping\npotential are absent. Across the whole crossover, we determine all the\ncoefficient functions at the one-loop level, taking into account the dependence\nof the gap parameter on the chemical potential in the mean-field approximation.\nThese results are analytically expressed in terms of elliptic integrals of the\nfirst and second kind. We discuss the form of these coefficients in the extreme\nBCS and BEC regimes and around the unitary limit, and compare with recent work\nby other authors.\n","Comment: 27 pages. 4 references added, typos corrected, expanded Section III B"]}]

Themes range from\nastro-particle physics to chemical evolution in the Galaxy to cosmic\nnucleosynthesis and chemistry in an anticipation of a full account of matter in\nthe Universe. Studies of chemical evolution in the early Universe will answer\nquestions about when and where the majority of metals were formed, how they\nspread and why they appar today as they are. The evolution of matter in our\nUniverse cannot be characterized as a simple path of development. In fact the\nstate of matter today tells us that mass and matter is under constant\nreformation through on-going star formation, nucleosynthesis and mass loss on\nstellar and galactic scales. X-ray absorption studies have evolved in recent\nyears into powerful means to probe the various phases of interstellar and\nintergalactic media. Future observatories such as IXO and Gen-X will provide\nvast new opportunities to study structure and distribution of matter with high\nresolution X-ray spectra. Specifically the capabilities of the soft energy\ngratings with a resolution of R=3000 onboard IXO will provide ground breaking\ndeterminations of element abundance, ionization structure, and dispersion\nvelocities of the interstellar and intergalactic media of our Galaxy and the\nLocal Group\n","Comment: A White Paper Submitted to the Astro2010 Decadal Survey"]}]
