Perhaps surprisingly, it is controversial\nhow much a protein's functional importance affects its rate of evolution. In\nmost studies, functional importance has been measured on the coarse scale of\nprotein knock-outs, while evolutionary rate has been measured on the fine scale\nof amino acid substitutions. Here we introduce dynamical influence, a finer\nmeasure of protein functional importance. To measure dynamical influence, we\nfirst use detailed biochemical models of particular reaction networks to\nmeasure the influence of each reaction rate constant on network dynamics. We\nthen define the dynamical influence of a protein to be the average influence of\nthe rate constants for all reactions it is involved in.\n  Using models of a dozen biochemical systems and sequence data from\nvertebrates, we show that dynamical influence and evolutionary rate are\nnegatively correlated; proteins with greater dynamical influence evolve more\nslowly. We also show that proteins with greater dynamical influence are not\nmore likely to be essential. This suggests that there are many cellular\nreactions whose presence is essential for life, but whose quantitative rate is\nrelatively unimportant to fitness. We also provide evidence that the effect of\ndynamical influence on evolutionary rate is independent of protein expression\nlevel, expression specificity, gene compactness, and reaction degree.
