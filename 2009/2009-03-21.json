The\nfrequency $\\nu_m$ of the mass current is approximately given by the Kepler\nfrequency, whereas the frequencies of $Q_i$ and $Q_o$, $\\nu_i$ and $\\nu_o$,\nrespectively, are calculated from classical mechanics and Coulomb's law.\n  For the explanation of the low frequency QPOs in pulsars and black holes a\nspecial interpretation of the gravitomagnetic theory may be essential. From the\nlatter theory four new gravitomagnetic precession frequencies are deduced,\nwhich may be identified with the observed low frequency QPOs.\n  Predictions of the presented model are compared with observed high frequency\nand low frequency QPOs of the pulsars SAX J1808.4--3658, XTE J1807--294, IGR\nJ00291+5934, SGR 1806--20 and the black hole XTE J1550--564. In addition,\ncharge flow near the pole of pulsars may explain frequency drift of burst\noscillations. Moreover, charge flow at the equator of SAX J1808.4--3658 may be\nthe cause of the enigmatic 410 kHz QPO. Furthermore, the Lense-Thirring\nfrequency is discussed and a modified formula is compared with data of the\npulsars.\n  Contrary to pulsars and black holes, the low frequency QPOs of white dwarfs\nmight be attributed to electromagnetic precession frequencies, deduced in this\nwork.

Ordinary QCD is a SU(n) gauge theory with n_f Dirac\nquarks in the fundamental representation. Changing the representation of quarks\nleads to different and interesting theories, which are not as well studied as\nordinary QCD. In order to be able to have a consistent asymptotically free\nlarge n limit, we must limit ourselves to three cases: two-index representation\n(symmetric or anti-symmetric) and adjoint representation. Skyrmions of the\nlow-energy effective Lagrangian shall be the main subject of this review. There\nare puzzling aspects, both in orientifold and adjoint QCD, regarding the\nidentification of the Skyrmion and its quantum stability, that have not yet\nbeen understood. We shall explain these problems and the solution we proposed\nfor them. The first part is dedicated to the two-index representation. Here the\nchallenge is to identify the correct particle in the spectrum that has to be\nidentified with the Skyrmion. It turns out not to be the simplest baryon (as in\nordinary QCD) but a baryonic state with higher charge, precisely composed by\nn(n\\pm 1)/2 quarks. Although not the simplest among the baryons, it is the one\nthat minimizes the mass per unit of baryonic charge and thus is the most stable\namong them. The second part is devoted to the quarks in the adjoint\nrepresentation. The task here assume a different perspective. We do not have a\nbaryon charge, like in ordinary QCD. An important role is now played by a\nmassive fermion that must be considered in the low-energy effective Lagrangian.\nThrough this fermion, the Skyrmion acquires an anomalous fermionic number\n(-1)^F and, as a consequence, an odd relationship between the latter and its\nspin/statistic. This implies a Z_2 stability of the Skyrmion.\n","Comment: 38 pages; 15 figures. v2: ref added"]}]

The diffraction-limited focused beam has unexpected properties,\nresulting from a strong interplay between the angular spatial structure and the\nlocal polarization in the non-paraxial regime. In the region near the beam\naxis, and provided that $|\\ell|\\ge 2$ and $\\ell$ and $\\sigma$ have opposite\nsigns, the energy locally counter-propagates and the projection of the electric\nfield onto the focal plane counter-rotates with respect to the circular\npolarization of the incident beam. We explicitly show that the total angular\nmomentum flux per unit power is conserved after focusing, as expected by\nrotational symmetry, but the spin and orbital separate contributions change.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 9 figures"]}]

The\nsource of the beat-like signal is most likely the cellular nucleus, which is a\nspheroidal particle with an optically sharp edge, low relative index of\nrefraction, and a size parameter in the resonant range; another possible source\nis an agglomeration of cell organelles of a similar size. Using Mie theory\ncomputer simulations for a dielectric sphere with biological nucleus-like\nparameters, we have shown that backscattering as a function of size parameter\nhas a beat-like pattern. The high frequency periodic oscillation is the single\nscattering contribution, while multiple scattering events give slowly varying\noscillatory contributions. With increasing contrast, the backscattering signal\nchanges from a pure sinusoid to that of a beat signal. The beat-like pattern in\nscattering from a low contrast particle does not depend on any particular\nfeatures of the sphere; a similar pattern is observable in scattering from\nstar-like non-spherical objects with a sharp optical contrast and smooth shape;\nin this case, the high frequency of oscillations depends on the object\norientation relative to incident light\n","Comment: 14 pages, 4 figures"]}]
