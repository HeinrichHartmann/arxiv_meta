Solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation within the rime\nAnsatz which are maximally different from the standard one we call \"strict\nrime\". A strict rime non-unitary solution is parameterized by a projective\nvector. We show that this solution transforms to the Cremmer-Gervais R-matrix\nby a change of basis with a matrix containing symmetric functions in the\ncomponents of the parameterizing vector. A strict unitary solution (the rime\nAnsatz is well adapted for taking a unitary limit) is shown to be equivalent to\na quantization of a classical \"boundary\" r-matrix of Gerstenhaber and\nGiaquinto. We analyze the structure of the elementary rime blocks and find, as\na by-product, that all non-standard R-matrices of GL(1|1)-type can be uniformly\ndescribed in a rime form.\n  We discuss then connections of the classical rime solutions with the Bezout\noperators. The Bezout operators satisfy the (non-)homogeneous associative\nclassical Yang--Baxter equation which is related to the Rota-Baxter operators.\n  We classify the rime Poisson brackets: they form a 3-dimensional pencil.

Nonetheless, there\nis evidence that knowledge of how confinement modifies static behavior can aid\nin forecasting dynamics. Specifically, molecular simulation studies have shown\nthat the relationship between excess entropy and self diffusivity of a bulk\nequilibrium fluid changes only modestly when the fluid is isothermally\nconfined, indicating that knowledge of the former might allow semi-quantitative\npredictions of the latter. Do other static measures, such as those that\ncharacterize free or available volume, also strongly correlate with\nsingle-particle dynamics of confined fluids? Here, we study this issue for both\nthe single-component hard-sphere fluid and hard-sphere mixtures. Specifically,\nwe use molecular simulations and fundamental measure theory to study these\nsystems at approximately $10^3$ equilibrium state points. We examine three\ndifferent confining geometries (slit pore, square channel, and cylindrical\npore) and the effects of packing fraction and particle-boundary interactions.\nAlthough density fails to predict some key qualitative trends for the dynamics\nof confined fluids, we find that a new generalized measure of available volume\nfor inhomogeneous fluids strongly correlates with the self diffusivity across a\nwide parameter space in these systems, approximately independent of the degree\nof confinement. An important consequence, which we demonstrate here, is that\ndensity functional theory predictions of this static property can be used\ntogether with knowledge of bulk fluid behavior to estimate the diffusion\ncoefficient of confined fluids under equilibrium conditions.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 6 figures"]}]

It is explicitly shown that Lewis'\nontological doctrine of Humean supervenience incorporates at its foundation the\nso-called separability principle of classical physics. In view of the\nsystematic violation of the latter within quantum mechanics, it is argued that\ncontemporary physical science posits non-supervenient relations over and above\nthe spatiotemporal ones.

A method of transit-time optical stochastic cooling has been\nproposed which would employ high-gain, high-bandwidth, solid-state lasers to\namplify the spontaneous radiation from the charged particle bunch in a\nstrong-field magnetic wiggler.
