The global\ndefinitions of these special Finsler manifolds are introduced. Various\nrelationships between the different types of the considered special Finsler\nmanifolds are found. Many local results, known in the literature, are proved\nglobally and several new results are obtained. As a by-product, interesting\nidentities and properties concerning the torsion tensor fields and the\ncurvature tensor fields are deduced.

The m-value is\nassociated with the difference in the surface area between the native (N) and\nthe denatured (D) state, which should be a function of DR_g^2, the difference\nin the square of the radius of gyration between the D and N states.

We resolve the conundrum between constant m-values and\n[C]-dependent changes in Rg using molecular simulations of a coarse-grained\nrepresentation of protein L, and the Molecular Transfer Model, for which the\nequilibrium folding can be accurately calculated as a function of denaturant\nconcentration. We find that over a large range of denaturant concentration (> 3\nM) the m-value is a constant, whereas under strongly renaturing conditions (< 3\nM) it depends on [C].

The\nburial of the backbone gives rise to substantial surface area changes below\n[C]< 3 M, leading to collapse in the denatured state.

In the present work,\nthe scheme for this process is shown where white light from a black and white\nobject is diffracted at a diffraction grating and then photographed on colour\nfilm. Two rays of different wavelengths reaching the plane of the color\nphotographic film determine the stereo representation of an object point. Since\nthe wavelength may have any value within the continuous visible spectrum, this\ncase constitutes a new situation of continuous stereo photography. A natural\nprocess of decoding is represented where a diffusing white light source was\nadded from the side of the developed photographic film. One white light ray\nthat matches the former position of an incident ray receives the spectral\ncharacteristics of the registered point when traversing the photographic slide.\nIt characterizes a situation of light path reversal, and the ideal result\ncorresponds to a projected white light point being focused at the original\nobject position. This situation generates a pseudoscopic image of the object,\nas seen from a certain distance, whose colour depends on the horizontal\nposition of the observer.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 5 figures"]}]

Based on morphological and spectral\ncharacteristics of these sources, currently a strong contender to explain the\nnature of these sources is the `alternative' model of Lal & Rao (2007), in\nwhich these sources consist of two pairs of jets, which are associated with two\nunresolved AGNs. Detailed morphological and spectral results on\nmilliarcsecond-scales (mas) provide a crucial test of this model, and hence\nthese sources are excellent candidates to study on mas; {\\it i.e.}, to detect\nhe presence/absence of double nuclei/AGNs, signs of helical/disrupted jets,\nthereby, to investigate spatially resolved/unresolved binary AGN systems and\nproviding clues to understanding the physics of merging of AGNs on mas. We\nconducted a systematic study of a large sample of known X-shaped, comparison FR\nII radio galaxies, and newly discovered X-shaped candidate sources using Giant\nMetrewave Radio Telescope and Very Large Array at several radio frequencies. In\nour new observations of `comparison' FR II radio galaxies we find that almost\nall of our targets show standard spectral steepening as a function of distance\nfrom the hotspot. However, one source, 3C 321, has a low-surface-brightness\nextension that shows a flatter spectral index than the high-surface-brightness\nhotspots$ / $lobes, as found in `known' X-shaped sources.\n","Comment: To appear in the proceedings of the Conference \"The Central\n  Kiloparsec: Active Galactic Nuclei and Their Hosts\", Ierapetra 4-6 June 2008,\n  Greece, Memorie della Societa Astronomica Italiana"]}]
