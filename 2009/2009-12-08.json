The mechanism by which spin-up is regulated as\nyoung stars contract has been one of the longest-standing problems in star\nformation. Attempts to observationally confirm the prevailing theory that\nmagnetic interaction between the star and its circumstellar disk regulates\nthese rotation periods have produced mixed results.

There are, however, turbulent\ndynamo mechnisms that may complement the alpha effect or may be an alternative\nto it. Aims: We investigate models of solar-type dynamos where the alpha effect\nis completely replaced by two other turbulent dynamo mechanisms, namely the\nOmega x J effect and the shear-current effect, which both result from an\ninhomogeneity of the mean magnetic field. Methods: We studied axisymmetric\nmean-field dynamo models containing differential rotation, the Omega x J and\nshear-current effects, and a meridional circulation. The model calculations\nwere carried out using the rotation profile of the Sun as obtained from\nhelioseismic measurements and radial profiles of other quantities according to\na standard model of the solar interior. Results: Without meridional flow, no\nsatisfactory agreement of the models with the solar observations can be\nobtained. With a sufficiently strong meridional circulation included, however,\nthe main properties of the large-scale solar magnetic field, namely, its\noscillatory behavior, its latitudinal drift towards the equator within each\nhalf cycle, and its dipolar parity with respect to the equatorial plane, are\ncorrectly reproduced.

Conventional cooperation techniques require sharing large\namounts of information over finite-capacity backhaul links and assume that base\nstations have full channel state information (CSI) of all the active users in\nthe system. In this paper, a new limited feedback strategy is proposed for\nmulticell beamforming where cooperation is restricted to sharing only the CSI\nof active users among base stations. The system setup considered is a linear\narray of cells based on the Wyner model. Each cell contains single-antenna\nusers and multi-antenna base stations. Closed-form expressions for the\nbeamforming vectors that approximately maximize the sum-rates in a multicell\nsystem are first presented, assuming full CSI at the transmitter. For the more\npractical case of a finite-bandwidth feedback link, CSI of the desired and\ninterfering channels is quantized at the receiver before being fed back to the\nbase station. An upper bound on the mean loss in sum rate due to random vector\nquantization is derived. A new feedback-bit allocation strategy, to partition\nthe available bits between the desired and interfering channels, is developed\nto approximately minimize the mean loss in sum-rate due to quantization. The\nproposed feedback-bit partitioning algorithm is shown, using simulations, to\nyield sum-rates close to the those obtained using full CSI at base stations.\n","Comment: 28 pages, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing"]}]

Program packages have been developed for a spatially variable PSF, but\nthey require that a sufficient number of bright, isolated stars in the image\nare present to adequately sample the PSF. Imaging the Galactic center is\nparticularly challenging. We present two ways of dealing with spatially\nvariable PSFs when only one or very few suitable PSF reference stars are\npresent in the field. Local PSF fitting with the StarFinder algorithm is\napplied to the data. Satisfying results can be found in two ways: (a) creating\nlocal PSFs by merging locally extracted PSF cores with the PSF wings estimated\nfrom the brightest star in the field; (b) Wiener deconvolution of the image\nwith the PSF estimated from the brightest star in the field and subsequent\nestimation of local PSFs on the deconvolved image. The methodology is tested on\nreal, and on artificial images. The method involving Wiener deconvolution of\nthe image prior to local PSF extraction and fitting gives excellent results. It\nlimits systematic effects to ~2-5% in point source photometry and ~10% in\ndiffuse emission on fields-of-view as large as 28\" x 28\" and observed through\nthe H-band filter. Particular attention is given to how deconvolution changes\nthe noise properties of the image. It is shown that mean positions and fluxes\nof the stars are conserved by the deconvolution. However, the estimated\nuncertainties of the PSF fitting algorithm are too small if the presence of\ncovariances is ignored in the PSF fitting as has been done here.

In view of the new atmospheric, solar and the LSND neutrino\noscillation data, the Pontecorvo $\\nu - K^0$ oscillation analogy is generalized\nto the notion of neutrino duality with substantially different physical meaning\nascribed to the long-baseline and the short-baseline neutrino oscillations. At\nthe level of CP-invariance, the suggestion of dual neutrino properties defines\nthe symmetric two-mixing-angle form of the widely discussed four-neutrino\n$(2+2)$-mixing scheme, as a result of the lepton charge conservation selection\nrule and a minimum of two Dirac neutrino fields. With neutrino duality, the\ntwo-doublet structure of the Majorana neutrino mass spectrum is a vestige of\nthe two-Dirac-neutrino origin. The fine neutrino mass doublet structure is\nnatural because it is produced by a lepton charge symmetry violating\nperturbation on a zero-approximation system of two twofold mass-degenerate\nDirac neutrino-antineutrino pairs. A set of inferences related to the neutrino\noscillation phenomenology in vacuum is considered.\n","Comment: 13 pages, LaTeX. Minor modifications, new references added"]}]

We study also Confinement Physics\nusing lattice QCD. In the maximally abelian (MA) gauge, the off-diagonal gluon\namplitude is strongly suppressed, and then the off-diagonal gluon phase shows\nstrong randomness, which leads to a large effective off-diagonal gluon mass,\n$M_{\\rm off} \\simeq 1.2 {\\rm GeV}$. Due to the large off-diagonal gluon mass in\nthe MA gauge, infrared QCD is abelianized like nonabelian Higgs theories. In\nthe MA gauge, there appears a macroscopic network of the monopole world-line\ncovering the whole system. From the monopole current, we extract the dual gluon\nfield $B_\\mu$, and examine the longitudinal magnetic screening. We obtain $m_B\n\\simeq$ 0.5 GeV in the infrared region, which indicates the dual Higgs\nmechanism by monopole condensation. From infrared abelian dominance and\ninfrared monopole condensation, low-energy QCD in the MA gauge is described\nwith the dual Ginzburg-Landau (DGL) theory.\n","Comment: Invited talk given at International Symposium on Hadrons and Nuclei,\n  Seoul, Korea, 20-22 Feb 2001"]}]
