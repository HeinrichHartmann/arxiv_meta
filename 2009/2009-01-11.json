The system consists of ``electrode/quantum\nwell(QW)/dot/QW/electrode\" junctions, in which the left QW has an energy level\nof conduction electrons with only up-spin. We consider a situation in which\nup-spin electrons are sequentially injected from the left electrode into the\ndot through the QW and an exchange interaction acts between the electrons and\nthe localized spin. To describe the sequentially injected electrons, we propose\na simple method based on approximate solutions from the time-dependent\nSchr$\\ddot{\\rm o}$dinger equation. Using this method, it is shown that the spin\nreversal occurs when the right QW has energy levels of conduction electrons\nwith only down-spin. In particular, the expression of the reversal time of a\nlocalized spin is derived and the upper and lower limits of the time are\nclearly expressed. This expression is expected to be useful for a rough\nestimation of the minimum relaxation time of the localized spin to achieve the\nreversal. We also obtain analytic expressions for the expectation value of the\nlocalized spin and the electrical current as a function of time.
