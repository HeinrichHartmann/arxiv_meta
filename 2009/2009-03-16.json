The current and density spin polarizations as well as the\nmagnetoresistance are each obtained as the sum of an equilibrium term\ndetermined by the spin-relaxed chemical potential, and an off-equilibrium\ncontribution expressed in terms of a spin transport function that is related to\nthe splitting of the spin-resolved chemical potentials.

Stochastic\nsimulation of cell movement shows that the positive feedback mechanism of\ncortical factors stabilizes or destabilizes modes of movement and determines\nthe cell migration pattern.

First, a new\ninterpretation on the fundamental tradeoff between the transmission rate and\noutage probability in multi-antenna relay networks is given. It follows that\nmultiplexing gains can be obtained at any finite SNR, in full-duplex\nmulti-antenna relay networks. Thus relaying can offer not only stronger link\nreliability, but also higher spectral efficiency.\n  Specifically, the decode-and-forward protocol is applied and networks that\nhave one source, one destination, and multiple relays are considered. A receive\npower gain at the relays, which captures the network large scale fading\ncharacteristics, is also considered. It is shown that this power gain can\nsignificantly affect the system diversity-multiplexing tradeoff for any finite\nSNR value. Several relaying protocols are proposed and are shown to offer\nnearly the same outage probability as if the transmit antennas at the source\nand the relay(s) were co-located, given certain SNR and receive power gains at\nthe relays. Thus a higher multiplexing gain than that of the direct link can be\nobtained if the destination has more antennas than the source.\n  Much of the analysis in the paper is valid for arbitrary channel fading\nstatistics.

First we display a\nnonlocal map that commutes with the de Sitter isometries, transforms the\nbulk-boundary propagator and solutions of free wave equations in de Sitter onto\nthe same quantities in Euclidean anti-de Sitter (EAdS), and takes the two\nboundaries of dS to the single EAdS boundary via an antipodal identification.\nSecond we compute the action of scalar fields on dS as a functional of boundary\ndata. Third, we display a family of solutions to 3d gravity with a positive\ncosmological constant in which the equal time sections are arbitrary genus\nRiemann surfaces, and compute the action of these spaces as a functional of\nboundary data from the Einstein gravity and Chern-Simons gravity points of\nview. These studies suggest that if de Sitter space is dual to a Euclidean\nconformal field theory (CFT), this theory should involve two disjoint, but\npossibly entangled factors. We argue that these CFTs would be of a novel form,\nwith unusual hermiticity conditions relating left movers and right movers.\nAfter exploring these conditions in a toy model, we combine our observations to\npropose that a holographic dual description of de Sitter space would involve a\npure entangled state in a product of two of our unconventional CFTs associated\nwith the de Sitter boundaries. This state can be constructed to preserve the de\nSitter symmetries and and its decomposition in a basis appropriate to antipodal\ninertial observers would lead to the thermal properties of static patch.\n","Comment: LaTeX, v2: references added"]}]
