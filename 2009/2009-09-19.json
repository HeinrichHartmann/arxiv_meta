The spectral\nmethod exploits the natural eigenfunctions of the master equation of\nbirth-death processes to solve for the joint distribution of modules within the\nnetwork, which then inform each other and facilitate calculation of the entire\njoint distribution. We illustrate the method on a ubiquitous case in nature:\nlinear regulatory cascades. The efficiency of the method makes possible\nnumerical optimization of the input and regulatory parameters, revealing design\nproperties of, e.g., the most informative cascades. We find, for threshold\nregulation, that a cascade of strong regulations converts a unimodal input to a\nbimodal output, that multimodal inputs are no more informative than bimodal\ninputs, and that a chain of up-regulations outperforms a chain of\ndown-regulations.
