This\nalso seems to be the case of Sagittarius A* in the Galactic Center, where the\nbroad-band radiation is produced, likely via the synchrotron self-Compton\nmechanism. It has been proposed that strong-field gravitational lensing\nmagnifies the flares. The effect of lensing is generally weak and requires a\nfine-tuned geometrical arrangement, which occurs with only a low probability.\nHowever, there are several aspects that make Sagittarius A* a promising target\nto reveal strong gravity effects. Unlike type II (obscured) active galaxies,\nchances are that a flare is detected at high inclination, which would be\nfavourable for lensing. Time delays can then significantly influence the\nobserved flare duration and the form of light-curve profiles. Here we discuss\nan idea that the impact of lensing amplification should be considerably\nenhanced when the shape of the flaring clump is appropriately elongated in the\nform of a spiral wave or a narrow filament, rather than a simple (circular)\nspot which we employed previously within the phenomenological `orbiting spot\nmodel'. By parameterizing the emission region in terms of the spiral shape and\ncontrast, we are able to extend the spot model to more complicated sources. In\nthe case of spirals, we notice a possibility that more photons reach a distant\nobserver at the same moment because of interplay between lensing and\nlight-travel time. The effect is not symmetrical with respect to leading versus\ntrailing spirals, so in principle the source geometry can be constrained. In\nspite of this, the spot model seems to provide entirely adequate framework to\nstudy the currently available data.\n","Comment: Proceedings of the Workshop on the Black Holes and Neutron Stars,\n  eds.

The presented device was tested in several\n1.5-T MR systems from different companies in combination with different phased\narrays. One of the authors was enrolled as volunteer for the experiments. In\nthese experiments his knees were imaged by using a dual phased array. The\ndevice was placed between the knees to check that the penetration depth of the\ncoils was improved by this passive device. In all the experiments the presented\ndevice was successfully tested and it was checked that the knees of the\nvolunteer can be imaged at deeper distances and that the signal-to-noise-ratio\n(SNR) in the obtained MR images was improved by the presence of the lens. The\npresented device has proven to increase the penetration depth of MR phased\narrays of surface coils. The lens was tested by means of the MR imaging of the\nknees but it can be used to image any pair of joints simultaneously by placing\nit between the joints. The positive results suggest the possibility of using\nthe lens to image the female breast.

To network CRs\nrequires spectrum sensing at CR transmitter and further information regarding\nthe spectrum availability at CR receiver. Redefining the spectrum sensing along\nwith statistical inference suitable for cognitive radio networks (CRN), we\nmathematically derive conditions to allow CR transmitter forwarding packets to\nCR receiver under guaranteed outage probability, and prove that the correlation\nof localized spectrum availability between a cooperative node and CR receiver\ndetermines effectiveness of the cooperative scheme. Applying our novel\nmathematical model to potential hidden terminals in CRN, we illustrate that the\nallowable transmission region of a CR, defined as neighborhood, is no longer\ncircular shape even in a pure path loss channel model. This results in\nasymmetric CR links to make bidirectional links generally inappropriate in CRN,\nthough this challenge can be alleviated by cooperative sensing. Therefore,\nspectrum sensing capability determines CRN topology.

Alternatively, they satisfy a different, higher-order,\n``*-eigen-* equation'', locally, i.e. away from the walls [Kryukov-Walton].\nHere we show that this substitute equation can be written in a very simple\nform, even in the presence of an additional, arbitrary, but regular potential.\nThe more general applicability of the -eigen- equation is then demonstrated.\nFirst, using an idea from [Fairlie-Manogue], we extend it to a dynamical\nequation describing time evolution. We then show that also for general contact\ninteractions, the -eigen- equation is satisfied locally. Specifically, we treat\nthe most general possible (Robin) boundary conditions at an infinite wall,\ngeneral one-dimensional point interactions, and a finite potential jump.\nFinally, we examine a smooth potential, that has simple but different\nexpressions for x positive and negative. We find that the -eigen- equation is\nagain satisfied locally.
