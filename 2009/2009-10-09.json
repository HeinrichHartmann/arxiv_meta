A straightforward generalization of it to the case\nof an open universe is possible but it is not adequate for quantizing\nperturbations in the one bubble universe, because of the lack of Cauchy\nsurfaces inside the bubble. Therefore we perform the reduction of the action\noutside the lightcone emanating from the center of the bubble or nucleation\nevent, where the natural time constant hypersurfaces are no longer homogeneous\nand isotropic and as a result the conventional classification of perturbations\nin terms of scalar and tensor modes is not possible. Nevertheless, after\nreduction of the action we find three decoupled actions for three independent\ndegrees of freedom, one of which corresponds to the scalar mode and the other\ntwo to the tensor modes. Implications for the one bubble open inflationary\nmodels are briefly discussed. As an application of our formalism, the spectrum\nof long wavelength gravity waves is simply obtained in terms of the real part\nof the reflection amplitude for a one dimensional scattering problem, where the\npotential barrier is given in terms of the bubble profile.\n","Comment: 23 pages revtex file, submitted to Nucl.

Photons are emitted throughout the expansion\nhistory. Contrary to hadron elliptic flow, which hydrodynamics predicts to\nincrease monotonically with pT, the elliptic flow of thermal photons is\npredicted to first rise and then fall again as pT increases. Photon elliptic\nflow at high pT is shown to reflect the quark momentum anisotropy at early\ntimes when it is small, whereas at low pT it is controlled by the much larger\npion momentum anisotropy during the late hadronic emission stage. An\ninteresting structure is predicted at intermediate pT ~ 0.4 GeV/c where photon\nelliptic flow reflects the momenta and the (compared to pions) reduced v2 of\nheavy vector mesons in the late hadronic phase.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 4 figures.

The analysis includes a\nfull model parameter scan with chi^2 confidence levels. A comparison of\ndifferent transverse density profiles for the particle emission region allows\nfor a quantitative discussion of possible model dependencies of the results.\nOur fit results suggest a low thermal freeze-out temperature T approximately 95\n+- 15 MeV and a large average transverse flow velocity of about 0.55c +- 0.07c.\nMoreover, the fit favours a box-shaped transverse density profile over a\nGaussian one. We discuss the origins and the consequences of these results in\ndetail. In order to reproduce the measured pion multiplicity our model requires\na positive pion chemical potential. A study of the pion phase-space density\nindicates \\mu_\\pi approximately 60 MeV for T = 100 MeV.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 16 figures included via epsf, RevTeX, needs bbox.sty\n  (provided)"]}]
