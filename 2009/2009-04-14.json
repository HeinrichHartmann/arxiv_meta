We clarify the response of extrasolar planetary systems in a 2:1 mean\nmotion commensurability with masses ranging from the super Jovian range to the\nterrestrial range to stochastic forcing that could result from protoplanetary\ndisk turbulence. The behaviour of the different libration modes for a wide\nrange of system parameters and stochastic forcing magnitudes is investigated.\nThe growth of libration amplitudes is parameterized as a function of the\nrelevant physical parameters. The results are applied to provide an explanation\nof the configuration of the HD128311 system.\n  Methods. We first develop an analytic model from first principles without\nmaking the assumption that both eccentricities are small. We also perform\nnumerical N-body simulations with additional stochastic forcing terms to\nrepresent the effects of putative disk turbulence.\n  Results. Systems are quickly destabilized by large magnitudes of stochastic\nforcing but some stability is imparted should systems undergo a net orbital\nmigration. The slow mode, which mostly corresponds to motion of the angle\nbetween the apsidal lines of the two planets, is converted to circulation more\nreadily than the fast mode which is associated with oscillations of the\nsemi-major axes. This mode is also vulnerable to the attainment of small\neccentricities which causes oscillations between periods of libration and\ncirculation.\n  Conclusions. Stochastic forcing due to disk turbulence may have played a role\nin shaping the configurations of observed systems in mean motion resonance.

The metal-poor star HE 1523-0901 serves as\nan example for this group of objects. It displays in its spectrum the strongest\noverabundance of neutron-capture elements associated with the r-process.

The orientation of the inner jet regions is fully consistent with\nthe result of 10deg-19deg to the line of sight suggested by previous Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST) proper motion studies of the M87 jet. The outer jet,\nhowever, shows systematic deflection off the inner jet to much smaller\ninclination (<<10deg).

The\nsingular perturbation analysis is more involved than that of finite element\nbecause all the subblocks in the discretization matrix depend on the diffusion\ncoefficient. However, that dependence is eliminated asymptotically. This allows\nthe same preconditioner to be utilized due to similar limiting behaviours of\nthe submatrices; leading to a narrowing family of preconditioners that can be\nused for different discretizations--a desirable preconditioner design goal. We\ncompare our numerical results to standard cell-centered multigrid and observe\nthat performance of our preconditioner is independent of the utilized\nprolongation operators and smoothers.\n  As a side result, we also prove that the solution over the highly-diffusive\nisland becomes constant asymptotically.

Diagonal scaling is probably the most basic\npreconditioner for high-contrast coefficients.

Its restriction to graphs has been\ninvestigated in the literature for it allows to concentrate on the\ncombinatorial problem abstracting from geometric considerations. In this paper,\nwe consider motion planning over directed graphs, which are of interest for\nasymmetric communication networks. Directed graphs generalize undirected\ngraphs, while introducing a new source of complexity to the motion planning\nproblem: moves are not reversible. We first consider the class of acyclic\ndirected graphs and show that the feasibility can be solved in time linear in\nthe product of the number of vertices and the number of arcs. We then turn to\nstrongly connected directed graphs. We first prove a structural theorem for\ndecomposing strongly connected directed graphs into strongly biconnected\ncomponents.Based on the structural decomposition, we give an algorithm for the\nfeasibility of motion planning on strongly connected directed graphs, and show\nthat it can also be decided in time linear in the product of the number of\nvertices and the number of arcs.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 9 figures, algorithm2e.sty"]}]

Calculations have been\nperformed for nS, nP and nD states of Na and Rb, which are commonly used in a\nvariety of experiments, at principal quantum numbers n=8-65 and at three\nambient temperatures of 77, 300 and 600 K. A peculiarity of our calculations is\nthat we take into account the contributions of BBR-induced redistribution of\npopulation between Rydberg states prior to photoionization and field ionization\nby extraction electric field pulses. The obtained results show that these\nphenomena affect both the magnitude of measured ionization rates and shapes of\ntheir dependencies on n. The calculated ionization rates are compared with the\nresults of our earlier measurements of BBR-induced ionization rates of Na nS\nand nD Rydberg states with n=8-20 at 300 K. A good agreement for all states\nexcept nS with n>15 is observed. We also present the useful analytical formulae\nfor quick estimation of BBR ionization rates of Rydberg atoms.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables in Appendix"]}]
