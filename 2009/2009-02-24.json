We\nmotivate degravitation-- where Netwon's constant is promoted to a scale\ndependent filter function-- as arising from either a small (resonant) mass for\nthe graviton, or as an effect in semi-classical gravity. After addressing how\nthe Bianchi identities are to be satisfied in such a set up, we turn our\nattention towards the cosmological consequences of degravitation. By\nconsidering the example filter function corresponding to a resonantly massive\ngraviton (with a filter scale larger than the present horizon scale), we show\nthat slow roll inflation, hybrid inflation and old inflation remain\nquantitatively unchanged.

This switching of the polarization occurs not because of a conventional\nmagnetically induced phase transition, but because of dynamic effects:\nIncreasing H lengthens the relaxation time by x500 from <200 ns to >100 ?s, and\nit couples strongly the polarization relaxation and spin relaxations.

However, surprisingly, there has been little work that characterizes\nthe fundamental tradeoff between the communication reliability and transmission\nrate across all signal-to-noise ratios.

As applications of the error exponent analysis, we\npresent two optimal resource allocations to maximize the bottleneck error\nexponent: i) the optimal rate allocation under a sum-rate constraint and its\nclosed-form quasi-optimal solution that requires only knowledge of the capacity\nand cutoff rate of each link; and ii) the optimal power allocation under a\ntotal power constraint, which is formulated as a quasi-convex optimization\nproblem.

The first is a\nmodified Kahn-Woltjer model which gives a value of the Local Group mass via the\nparticular motions of the two largest members, the Milky Way and M31.

The masses of subhaloes at their time of accretion are\nobtained from a standard merger tree. During the subsequent evolution, the\nsubhaloes experience mass loss due to the combined effect of dynamical\nfriction, tidal stripping, and tidal heating. Rather than integrating these\neffects along individual subhalo orbits, we consider the average mass loss\nrate, where the average is taken over all possible orbital configurations. This\nallows us to write the average mass loss rate as a simple function that depends\nonly on redshift and on the instantaneous mass ratio of subhalo and parent\nhalo. After calibrating the model by matching the subhalo mass function (SHMF)\nof cluster-sized dark matter haloes obtained from numerical simulations, we\ninvestigate the predicted mass and redshift dependence of the SHMF.We find\nthat, contrary to previous claims, the subhalo mass function is not universal.\nInstead, both the slope and the normalization depend on the ratio of the parent\nhalo mass, M, and the characteristic non-linear mass M*. This simply reflects a\nhalo formation time dependence; more massive parent haloes form later, thus\nallowing less time for mass loss to operate. We analyze the halo-to-halo\nscatter, and show that the subhalo mass fraction of individual haloes depends\nmost strongly on their accretion history in the last Gyr.

The different solutions can\nbe represented by trajectories on a sphere and we find that quintessence\nhappens within the \"arctic circle\" of the sphere.\n  Furthermore, we obtain multi-exponential potentials from 3D group manifold\nreductions of gravity, implying that such potentials can be embedded in gauged\nsupergravities with an M-theory origin. We relate the double exponential case\nto flux compactifications on maximally symmetric spaces and S-branes. In the\ntriple exponential case our analysis suggests the existence of two exotic\nS(D-3)-branes in D dimensions.\n","Comment: 31 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables. v2: minor corrections, references\n  added. v3: references and minor clarifications added"]}]

It\nprovides an alternative framework in which to study uncertain interconnections\nor systems with external inputs, where it offers several significant advantages\nwhen compared with traditional Lyapunov analysis. Contraction-based methods are\nparticularly useful for analyzing systems with uncertain parameters and for\nproving synchronization properties of nonlinear oscillators. Existence of a\ncontraction metric for a given system is a necessary and sufficient condition\nfor global exponential convergence of system trajectories. For systems with\npolynomial or rational dynamics, the search for contraction metrics can be made\nfully algorithmic through the use of convex optimization and sum of squares\n(SOS) programming. The search process is made computationally tractable by\nrelaxing matrix definiteness constraints, whose feasibility indicate existence\nof a contraction metric, into SOS constraints on polynomial matrices.
