Especially we focus on the mass loss-metallicity dependence and\non the so-called bi-stability jump.\n  Subsequently we concentrate on two urgent problems, weak winds and wind\nclumping, that have been identified from various diagnostics and that challenge\nour present understanding of radiation driven winds. We discuss the problems of\n``measuring'' mass-loss rates from weak winds and the potential of the near\ninfrared, Br-alpha line as a tool to enable a more precise quantification, and\ncomment on physical explanations for mass-loss rates that are much lower than\npredicted by the standard model.\n  Wind clumping, conventionally interpreted as the consequence of a strong\ninstability inherent to radiative line-driving, has severe implications for the\ninterpretation of observational diagnostics, since derived mass-loss rates are\nusually overestimated when clumping is present but ignored in the analyses.\nSimplified techniques to account for clumping indicate overestimates by factors\nof 2 to 10, or even more. If actually true, these results would have a dramatic\nimpact on the evolution of, and the feedback from, massive stars. We discuss\nongoing attempts (including own work) to interprete the corresponding\nobservations in terms of more sophisticated models. By allowing for porosity in\ndensity and velocity space, and for a non-void inter-clump medium, such models\nmight require only moderate reductions of mass-loss rates.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 2 figures, to appear in: Recent Directions in Astrophysical\n  Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiation Hydrodynamics, edited by I.

AGB star outflows inject a significant\namount of material into the interstellar medium (ISM), seeding new star\nformation. AGB mass loss is thus a crucial component of galactic chemical\nevolution. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is an excellent site for AGB\nstudies. Over 40,000 AGB candidates have been identified using photometric data\nfrom the Spitzer Space Telescope Surveying The Agents of a Galaxy's Evolution\n(SAGE) mid-infrared (MIR) survey, including about 35,000 oxygen-rich, 7000\ncarbon-rich and 1400 \"extreme\" sources.

This work aims to\nquantify the mass-loss return from AGB stars to the LMC, a rough estimate for\nwhich is derived from the amount of MIR dust emission in excess of that from\nstarlight.

The traditional view on how to enable CSIT has\nbeen as follows so far: In time-division duplexed (TDD) systems, uplink (UL)\nand downlink (DL) channel reciprocity allows the use of a training sequence in\nthe UL direction, which is exploited to obtain an UL channel estimate. This\nestimate is in turn recycled in the next downlink slot. In frequency-division\nduplexed (FDD) systems, which lack the UL and DL reciprocity, the CSIT is\nprovided via the use of a dedicated feedback link of limited capacity between\nthe receivers and the transmitter. In this paper, we focus on TDD systems and\nput this classical approach in question. In particular, we show that the\ntraditional TDD setup above fails to fully exploit the channel reciprocity in\nits true sense. In fact, we show that the system can benefit from a combined\nCSIT acquisition strategy mixing the use of limited feedback and that of a\ntraining sequence. This combining gives rise to a very interesting joint\nestimation and detection problem for which we propose two iterative algorithms.\nAn outage rate based framework is also developed which gives the optimal\nresource split between training and feedback.

A good fit\nto the data, in particular the reproduction of the double dip structure\nobserved in the analyzing powers, requires quark wave functions for proton,\nantiproton, and pions with radii slightly larger than the respective measured\ncharge radii. This corresponds to an increase in range of the annihilation\nmechanisms and consequently the amplitudes for total angular momentum J=2 and\nhigher are much larger than in previous approaches.
