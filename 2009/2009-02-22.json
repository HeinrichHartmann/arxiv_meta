Distinguished examples\ninclude Ba-doped La$_2$CuO$_4$ (the first high temperature superconductor),\nK-doped BaBiO$_3$, K-doped C$_{60}$ and Na$_{x}$CoO$_{2}\\cdot y$H$_{2}$O. The\nmost recent example is F-doped LaFeAsO, which leads to a new class of high\ntemperature superconductors. One notes that all the above dopants are\nnon-magnetic, because magnetic atoms generally break superconducting Cooper\npairs. In addition, the doping site was out of the (super)conducting structural\nunit (layer or framework). Here we report that superconductivity was realized\nby doping magnetic element cobalt into the (super)conducting-active\nFe$_2$As$_2$ layers in LaFe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$AsO. At surprisingly small Co-doping\nlevel of $x$=0.025, the antiferromagnetic spin-density-wave transition in the\nparent compound is completely suppressed, and superconductivity with $T_c\\sim $\n10 K emerges. With increasing Co content, $T_c$ shows a maximum of 13 K at\n$x\\sim 0.075$, and then drops to below 2 K at $x$=0.15.
