Both are based on the cross correlation between a sample of\ngalaxies with orientations and a reference sample which represents the\nlarge-scale structure. Applied to the SDSS galaxy catalog the alignment\ncorrelation function reveals an overabundance of reference galaxies along the\nmajor axes of red, luminous (L > L*) galaxies out to projected separations of\n60 Mpc/h. No alignment signal is detected for blue galaxies. The\ncos(2\\theta)-statistic yields very similar results.

Using the halo\norientations overestimates the observed alignment by more than a factor of 2.\nThe large volume of the MS allows to generate two-dimensional maps of the\nalignment correlation function which show the reference galaxy distribution to\nbe flattened parallel to the orientations of red luminous galaxies with axis\nratios of ~0.5 and ~0.75 for halo and central orientations,respectively.

The nuclear X-ray emission emerges\nabove ~7 keV, through an absorber with column density N_H ~ a few 10^24/cm/cm.\nIts remarkable variability (doubling/halving timescale ~10^4 s) is not\nassociated with any appreciable spectral changes, ruling out variations of the\ninterposed absorber or changes in the primary continuum shape. The intense iron\nK-ALPHA fluorescent emission line is likely to be produced by the same nuclear\nabsorbing matter. Our estimate of the intrinsic nuclear power suggests that the\nactive nucleus dominates the bolometric energy output of NGC4945, if its\nnucleus has a typical quasar L_X/L(bol) ratio. This supports the idea that\nX-rays are the best energy band to search for absorbed AGN. The 0.1-5 keV\nemission is extended along the plane of the galaxy, and most likely due to a\npopulation of unresolved binaries, as believed to happen in several early-type\ngalaxies.

The observed structure of the debris disk in the solar system, i.e.,\nthe zodiacal cloud, also contains asymmetries: it has an offset center of\nsymmetry, it is warped, and there is an asymmetric ring of dust co-orbiting\nwith the Earth. Since the zodiacal cloud's asymmetries have been shown to be\nsignatures of the gravitational perturbations of the solar system's planets, it\nis hoped that it may be possible to indirectly detect extrasolar planetary\nsystems by their signatures in debris disk observations.

The CBs are heated by their collision with the\nsupernova shell. The GRB is the boosted surface radiation the CBs emit as they\nreach the transparent outskirts of the shell. The exiting CBs further\ndecelerate by sweeping up interstellar matter (ISM). The early X-ray afterglow\nis dominated by thermal bremsstrahlung from the cooling CBs, the optical\nafterglow by synchrotron radiation from the ISM electrons swept up by the CBs.\nWe show that this model fits simply and remarkably well all the measured\noptical afterglows of the 15 GRBs with known redshift, including that of GRB\n990123, for which unusually prompt data are available.

Lowering $\\Omnu$ would appear to\nproduce close agreement with all measures, save one: for all simulations,\nmedian group sizes are x1.4-1.7 larger than equivalently selected CfA1 groups.\n(3) The standard group M/L method gives $\\Omega\\simeq 0.1$ for CHDM and CfA1,\nand $\\Omega\\simeq 0.35$ for CDM. A conspiracy of three effects produce these\nvery low values, and we conclude that low observed $\\Omega$'s need not argue\nfor a low $\\Omega$ universe. When overmergers are broken up, the median virial-\nto-DM mass of 3D selected groups is $\\sim1$ for all simulations.\n$M_{DM}>10^{14}\\Msun$ groups appear virialized in all simulations.

The algorithm resolves gravitational forces\ninto a long range component computed by discretizing the mass distribution and\nsolving Poisson's equation on a grid using an FFT convolution method, and a\nshort range component computed by direct force summation for sufficiently close\nparticle pairs. The code consists primarily of a particle-particle computation\nparallelized by domain decomposition over blocks of neighbor-cells, a more\nregular mesh calculation distributed in planes along one dimension, and several\ntransformations between the two distributions.

The 300 Hz and 0.1 Hz QPOs appear only at the\nhighest observed luminosities (Lx > 0.15 Ledd), where the power-law component\ndominates the X-ray spectrum. At lower luminosity, the disk flux exceeds the\npower-law flux and only two of the QPOs are observed: the spectrally \"soft\" 9\nHz QPO, and the narrow, \"hard\" QPO that varies from 14-28 Hz as the hard flux\ndecreases. The 300 Hz QPO is likely to be analogous to the stationary QPO at 67\nHz seen in the microquasar GRS1915+105. We discuss models of these\nhigh-frequency QPOs which depend on effects due to general relativity.

The former tend to heat the\nstellar disc while the latter primarily produce a coherent tilt. Thus, disc\ngalaxies may accrete quite massive satellites without destroying the disc,\nparticularly, if the orbits are retrograde. We also find that a massive bulge\nmay play a role in reducing these effects. We have quantified the importance of\nthe responsiveness of the halo by replacing it by a rigid potentia l in several\nsimulations. In these cases, the increase of the vertical scale length is\nlarger by a factor of $1.5-2$, indicating that a self-consistent treatment is\nessential to get realistic results. A frequent by-product of the accretion\nprocess is the formation of weak stellar warps and asymmetric discs.

This analysis provides the basis for a\nclassification of binary lens microlensing events, especially of planetary\nevents, and an understanding of present ambiguities.\n","Comment: 20 pages in LaTeX2e format with 9 embedded PostScript figures;\n  figures modified and embedded; accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

Using a\nrepresentation that makes the relevant features explicit is a prerequisite for\nsuccessful learning and understanding. Therefore, I chose to represent\nrelations between individual words explicitly in my model. Lexical attraction\nis defined as the likelihood of such relations. I introduce a new class of\nprobabilistic language models named lexical attraction models which can\nrepresent long distance relations between words and I formalize this new class\nof models using information theory.\n  Within the framework of lexical attraction, I developed an unsupervised\nlanguage acquisition program that learns to identify linguistic relations in a\ngiven sentence. The only explicitly represented linguistic knowledge in the\nprogram is lexical attraction. There is no initial grammar or lexicon built in\nand the only input is raw text.

This structure enables the learner to detect higher level\nregularities. Using this bootstrapping procedure, the program was trained on\n100 million words of Associated Press material and was able to achieve 60%\nprecision and 50% recall in finding relations between content-words.

Second, the presence of a large\nnumber of counter-ions increases the osmotic pressure of polyelectrolyte\nsolutions, making such polymers water soluble as is of great importance to many\napplications. At surfaces, the same interplay between monomer-monomer repulsion\nand counter-ion degrees of freedom leads to a number of special properties.

The NMTO method allows one to solve the single-electron Schroedinger\nequation for a MT-potential -in which the MT-wells may overlap- using basis\nsets which are arbitrarily minimal. The substantial increase in accuracy over\nthe LMTO-ASA method is achieved by substitution of the energy-dependent partial\nwaves by so-called kinked partial waves, which have tails attached to them, and\nby using these kinked partial waves at N+1 arbitrary energies to construct the\nset of NMTOs.

In general, CBP has been demonstrated to improve\nperformance over generative (from-scratch) planning. However, the performance\nimprovements it provides are dependent on adequate judgements as to problem\nsimilarity. In particular, although CBP may substantially reduce planning\neffort overall, it is subject to a mis-retrieval problem. The success of CBP\ndepends on these retrieval errors being relatively rare. This paper describes\nthe design and implementation of a replay framework for the case-based planner\nDERSNLP+EBL.

On the other hand, we study the classical limit for\nscalar-tensorial models in two dimensions. We consider different couplings\nbetween the dilaton and the scalar field. We discuss the Hawking radiation\nprocess and, from an exact evaluation of the influence functional, we study the\nconditions by which decoherence ensures the validity of the semiclassical\napproximation in cosmological metrics.

Fitting the\nstrength of this amplitude to $I=0$ $\\pi\\pi$ and $I=1/2$ $K\\pi$ S-wave data\ngives a result consistent with this expectation. We find good agreement with\nexperimental phase shifts from threshold to 0.9 GeV in $\\pi\\pi$ and 1.6 GeV in\n$K\\pi$ using this approach. We conclude that the most important contribution to\nlow energy S-wave scattering in these channels arises from the nonresonant\nquark Born diagrams, but that the low-energy wings of the broad $s$-channel\nresonances $f_0(1400)$ and $K^*_0(1430)$ also give important contributions near\nthreshold.

The most\nimportant issue is that of the overall normalization of the hadronic spectral\nfunctions should not be fixed by assuming complete resonance dominance of the\ncontinuum threshold region as it can overestimate the resonance contributions\nto spectral integrals by factors as large as $\\sim 5$. The second important\nuncertainty comes from the assumed location, $s_0$, of the onset of duality\nwith perturbative QCD, as the extracted quark masses depend very sensitively on\nthis parameter. The assumption of duality and the requirement of positivity of\n$\\rho_5(s)$ imposes very severe constraints on the shape of the relevant\nspectral function in the dual region, and leads to rigorous lower bounds for\n$m_u+m_d$ as a function of $s_0$. In the extractions of $m_s$ we find that the\nconventional choice of the value of $s_0$ is not physical. For a more\nreasonable choice of $s_0$ we are not able to find a solution that is stable\nwith respect to variations of the Borel transform parameter. This problem can\nbe overcome only if the hadronic spectral function is determined up to\nsignificantly larger values of $s$ than is currently possible. Finally, we also\nestimate the error associated with the convergence of perturbative QCD\nexpressions used in the sum rule analyses. Our conclusion is that, taking all\nof these issues into account, the resulting sum rule estimates for both\n$m_u+m_d$ and $m_s$ could easily have uncertainties as large as a factor of 2.\n","Comment: 28 pages.

We use selected sum\nrules in conjunction with other calculations to obtain explicit expressions for\nthe scale-independent coupling constants $\\bar l_i$ of chiral perturbation\ntheory in the combination $\\bar l_i+\\ln(m^2_\\pi/\\mu^2)$, to evaluate the\nDas-Guralnik-Mathur-Low-Young current algebra expression for the\nelectromagnetic mass difference of the pion, and to compute the pion electrical\npolarizability $\\alpha_E$.

It is a fundamental quantity which has\njustly attracted a great deal of theoretical as well as experimental work. Its\ndetermination may answer the question of whether CP violation is present only\nin the mass matrix of neutral kaons (the superweak scenario) or also at work\ndirectly in the decays. After a brief historical summary, we discuss the\npresent and expected experimental sensitivities. In the light of these, we come\nto the problem of estimating epsilon'/epsilon in the standard model. We review\nthe present (circa 1998) status of the theoretical predictions of\nepsilon'/epsilon. The short-distance part of the computation is now known to\nthe next-to-leading order in QCD and QED and therefore well under control. On\nthe other hand, the evaluation of the hadronic matrix element of the relevant\noperators is where most of the theoretical uncertainty still resides. We\nanalyze the results of the currently most developed calculations. The values of\nthe B_i parameters in the various approaches are discussed, together with the\nallowed range of the relevant combination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa\nentries Im V_{td}V^*_{ts}. We conclude by summarizing and comparing all\nup-to-date predictions of epsilon'/epsilon. Because of the intrinsic\nuncertainties of the long-distance computations, values ranging from 10^{-4} to\na few times 10^{-3} can be accounted for in the standard model.

We\ndiscuss three supersymmetric extensions of the KP hierarchy (MRSKP, \\SKP2, and\nJSKP). We define and compute their additional symmetries and we find that the\nalgebra of additional symmetries are in all three cases isomorphic to the Lie\nalgebra of superdifferential operators. We discuss a new reduction of \\SKP2 and\nthe relation between MRSKP and \\SKP2 is clarified. Finally we consider the (so\nfar) only integrable hierarchy to have played a role in noncritical superstring\ntheory (sKdV-B). We identify it, prove its bihamiltonian integrability, and\nextend it by odd flows. We close with a discussion of new integrable\nsupersymmetrizations of the KdV-like hierarchies suggested by the study of\nsKdV-B.

After\na short introduction on strings in Minkowski and curved spacetimes, we focus on\nstrings in cosmological spacetimes. The classical behaviour of strings in FRW\nand inflationary spacetimes is now understood in a large extent from various\ntypes of explicit string solutions. Three different types of behaviour appear\nin cosmological spacetimes: {\\bf unstable, dual} to unstable and {\\bf stable}.\nFor the unstable strings, the energy and size grow for large scale factors $R\n\\to \\infty$, proportional to $R$. For the dual to unstable strings, the energy\nand size blow up for $R\\to 0$ as $1/R$. For stable strings, the energy and\nproper size are bounded. (In Minkowski spacetime, all string solutions are of\nthe stable type).Recent progress on self-consistent solutions to the Einstein\nequations for string dominated universes is reviewed. The energy-momentum\ntensor for a gas of strings is then considered as source of the spacetime\ngeometry and from the above string behaviours the string equation of state is\ndetermined. The self-consistent string solution exhibits the realistic matter\ndominated behaviour $R \\sim (X^0)^{2/3}\\; $ for large times and the radiation\ndominated behaviour $R \\sim (X^0)^{1/2}\\;$ for early times. Finally, we report\non the exact integrability of the string equations plus the constraints in de\nSitter spacetime that allows to systematically find {\\bf exact} string\nsolutions by soliton methods and the multistring solutions. {\\bf Multistring\nsolutions} are a new feature in curved spacetimes. That is, a single\nworld-sheet simultaneously describes many different and independent strings.\nThis phenomenon has no analogue in flat spacetime and follows to the coupling\nof the strings with the geometry.\n","Comment: A few minor corrections.

To make this possible, we use light-front\nfield theory to isolate vacuum effects, and we place a smooth cutoff on the\nHamiltonian to force its free-state matrix elements to quickly decrease as the\ndifference of the free masses of the states increases. The cutoff violates a\nnumber of physical principles of light-front field theory, including Lorentz\ncovariance and gauge covariance. This means that the operators in the\nHamiltonian are not required to respect these physical principles. However, by\nrequiring the Hamiltonian to produce cutoff-independent physical quantities and\nby requiring it to respect the unviolated physical principles of the theory, we\nare able to derive recursion relations that define the Hamiltonian to all\norders in perturbation theory in terms of the fundamental parameters of the\nfield theory. We present two applications of this method. First we work in\nmassless phi-cubed theory in six dimensions. We derive the recursion relations\nthat determine the Hamiltonian and demonstrate how they are used by computing\nand analyzing some of its second- and third-order matrix elements.

In this paper, we use techniques from soliton theory to study\nsubmanifolds in space forms whose Gauss-Codazzi equations are gauge equivalent\nto the G_{m,n}-system or the G_{m,n}^1-system. These include submanifolds with\nconstant sectional curvatures, isothermic surfaces, and submanifolds admitting\nprincipal curvature coordinates. The dressing actions of simple elements on the\nspace of solutions of the G_{m,n} and G_{m,n}^1 systems correspond to\nB\\\"acklund, Darboux and Ribaucour transformations for submanifolds.\n","Comment: 104 pages, 7 figures"]}]

This circle is intimately bound up\nwith the extrinsic geometry of the leaves of F. In particular, for any pair of\nleaves m,l of the universal cover of F with m>l, the leaf l is asymptotic to m\nin a dense set of directions at infinity, where the leaf space is co-oriented\nso that the foliation branches in the negative direction. This is a macroscopic\nversion of an infinitesimal result of Thurston's and gives much more drastic\ncontrol over the topology and geometry of F.\n  The pair of laminations can be used to produce a pseudo-Anosov flow\ntransverse to F which is regulating in the non-branching direction. Rigidity\nresults for these laminations in the R-covered case are extended to the case of\none-sided branching. In particular, an R-covered foliation can only be deformed\nto a foliation with one-sided branching along one of the two laminations\ncanonically associated to the R-covered foliation in math.GT/9903173, and these\nlaminations become exactly the laminations constructed for the new branched\nfoliation.\n  Other corollaries include that the ambient manifold is d-hyperbolic in the\nsense of Gromov, and that a self-homeomorphism of this manifold homotopic to\nthe identity is isotopic to the identity.\n","Comment: 49 pages, 9 figures; v4: final revision; to appear in Geom.

In this latter\ncategory, isomorphism classes of objects are exactly higher dimensional\nautomata up to deformations leaving invariant their computer scientific\nproperties as presence or not of deadlocks (or everything similar or related).\nSome hints to study the algebraic structure of dihomotopy types are given, in\nparticular a rule to decide whether a statement/notion concerning dihomotopy\ntypes is or not the lifting of another statement/notion concerning homotopy\ntypes. This rule does not enable to guess what is the lifting of a given\nnotion/statement, it only enables to make the verification, once the lifting\nhas been found.\n","Comment: 28 pages ; LaTeX2e + 4 figures ; Expository paper ; Minor typos\n  corrections ; To appear in GETCO'01 proceedings"]}]

These methods are based on direct constructions of increasing\nsequences of partitions through a simple exhaustion procedure rather than on\nthe construction of well separated ultrametric subspaces. The first scheme of\nconstruction provides a simple unified proof of the Majorizing Measure Theorem\nfor Gaussian processes and of the following fact. If $A,B$ are balanced convex\nsets in a vector space, and if $A$ is sufficiently convex, a control of the\ncovering numbers $N(A,\\varepsilon B)$ for all $\\varepsilon>0$ implies the (a\npriori stronger) existence of a majorizing measure on $A$ provided with the\ndistance induced by $B$. This establishes, apparently for the first time, a\nclear link between geometry and majorizing measures, and generalizes the\nearlier results on majorizing measures on ellipsoids in Hilbert space, that\nwere obtained by specific methods. Much of the rest of the paper is concerned\nwith the structure of bounded Bernoulli (=Radmacher) processes. The main\nconjecture on their structure is reformulated in several ways, that are shown\nto be equivalent, and to be equivalent to the existence of certain majorizing\nmeasures.

In particular, we give three infinite versions of the\n3-colorability problem that vary considerably in their recursion theoretic and\nproof theoretic complexity.

In particular, these spaces are the subject of a\nremarkable conjecture of E. Witten relating their intersection theory to the\nGelfand-Dikii (rth KdV) heirarchy.

One\nmethod for deriving such equations is the classification-of-diagrams technique\nof Taylor. However, as we shall explain in this paper, there are certain points\nof Taylor's method which require clarification. Firstly, it is not clear\nwhether Taylor's original method is equivalent to the simpler\nclassification-of-diagrams scheme used by Thomas, Rinat, Afnan and Blankleider\n(TRAB). Secondly, when the Taylor method is applied to certain problems in a\ntime-dependent perturbation theory it leads to the over-counting of some\ndiagrams. This paper first restates Taylor's method, in the process uncovering\nreasons why certain diagrams might be double-counted in the Taylor method. It\nthen explores how far Taylor's method is equivalent to the simpler TRAB method.\nFinally, it examines precisely why the double-counting occurs in Taylor's\nmethod, and derives corrections which compensate for this double-counting.\n","Comment: 50 pages, RevTeX.

Based on\nthese results, Henneck suggests that the strength of the $\\rho$-meson tensor\ncoupling to the nucleon may be weaker than used in present day NN interactions,\nlike the Paris or Bonn potentials. We point out that at low energies ( < 100\nMeV ) there is very little sensitivity to the strength of the $\\rho$ coupling,\ndue to the compensating effect of the second order tensor term. In order to\nestablish sensitivity, one has to go to energies > 200 MeV, where the second\norder contribution has gone out. As it happens, the $\\epsilon_1$ mixing\nparameter is well determined in the region of energies 200--300 MeV, and there\nis agreement with the predictions by the Paris and Bonn potentials; whereas the\nweak-$\\rho$ model is about 50\\% above the data.

The dependence of the higher-order coefficients\nlike curvature and Gauss curvature on the coupling $\\beta_c$ between the bulk\nand surface parts of the monopole vibrations is analytically studied. It is\nshown that the $K_A -$ expansion including the dynamical effect ( $A-$\ndependence of $\\beta_c$ ) shows an `up-turn' behaviour below mass number about\n120, suggesting the inapplicability of the LDM expansion of $K_A$ over this\nmass region.\n","Comment: 30 latex pages, five figures available on request ( to appear in Phy.\n  Rev.

This\nsuggests that such measurements could be very useful in probing the strangeness\ncontent in the proton. The orbitally excited quark-cluster configurations in\nthe proton are included in the calculation and found to have little effect.\n","Comment: 42 pages, REVTeX, epsfig.sty, amssymb.sty, 17 figures (25 eps files),\n  revised version to appear in Phys.

A survey of textbooks on quantum mechanics by authors such as Dicke\nand Witke (1960), Eisberg and Resnick (1985), Gasiorowicz (1974), Goswami\n(1992), and Liboff (1993) supports this point.
