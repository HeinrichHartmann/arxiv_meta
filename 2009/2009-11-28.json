Weak convergence is usually expressed in terms\nof the convergence of expected values of test functions of the trajectories.\nHere we present an alternative formulation of weak convergence in terms of the\nwell-known Prokhorov metric on spaces of random variables. For a general class\nof methods, we establish bounds on the rates of convergence in terms of the\nProkhorov metric. In doing so, we revisit the original proofs of weak\nconvergence and show explicitly how the bounds on the error depend on the\nsmoothness of the test functions. As an application of our result, we use the\nStrassen - Dudley theorem to show that the numerical approximation and the true\nsolution to the system of SDEs can be re-embedded in a probability space in\nsuch a way that the method converges there in a strong sense. One corollary of\nthis last result is that the method converges in the Wasserstein distance,\nanother metric on spaces of random variables. Another corollary establishes\nrates of convergence for expected values of test functions assuming only local\nLipschitz continuity. We conclude with a review of the existing results for\npathwise convergence of weakly converging methods and the corresponding strong\nresults available under re-embedding.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 2nd revision for IMA J Numerical Analysis.
