In the case of multi-input single-output\n(MISO)/single-input multi-output (SIMO) channels with K transmit/receive\nantennas, one can achieve a diversity gain of d(r)=K(1-r+K\\alpha) at spatial\nmultiplexing gain r, where \\alpha is the CSIT quality defined in this paper.\nFor general MIMO channels with M (M>1) transmit and N (N>1) receive antennas,\nwe show that depending on the value of \\alpha, different DMT can be derived and\nthe value of \\alpha has a great impact on the achievable diversity, especially\nat high multiplexing gains. Specifically, when \\alpha is above a certain\nthreshold, one can achieve a diversity gain of d(r)=MN(1+MN\\alpha)-(M+N-1)r;\notherwise, the achievable DMT is much lower and can be described as a\ncollection of discontinuous line segments depending on M, N, r and \\alpha.

APEX-SZ has mapped 0.8 square degrees\nof sky at a frequency of 150 GHz with an angular resolution of 1'. These new\nmeasurements significantly improve the constraints on anisotropy power at 150\nGHz over the range of angular multipoles 3000 < l < 10,000, limiting the total\nastronomical signal in a flat band power to be less than 105 microK^2 at 95%\nCL. We expect both submillimeter-bright, dusty galaxies and to a lesser extent\nsecondary CMB anisotropies from the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) to\nsignificantly contribute to the observed power. Subtracting the SZE power\nspectrum expected for sigma_8=0.8 and masking bright sources, the best fit\nvalue for the remaining power is C_l = 1.1^{+0.9}_{-0.8} x 10^{-5} micro K^2\n(1.7^{+1.4}_{-1.3} Jy^2 sr^{-1}). This agrees well with model predictions for\npower due to submillimeter-bright, dusty galaxies. Comparing this power to the\npower detected by BLAST at 600 GHz, we find the frequency dependence of the\nsource fluxes to be S_nu ~ nu^{2.6^{+0.4}_{-0.2}} if both experiments measure\nthe same population of sources. Simultaneously fitting for the amplitude of the\nSZE power spectrum and a Poisson distributed point source population, we place\nan upper limit on the matter fluctuation amplitude of sigma_8 < 1.18 at 95%\nconfidence.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 3 figures, updated to match accepted ApJ version"]}]
