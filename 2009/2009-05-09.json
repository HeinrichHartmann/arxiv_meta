As a consequence,\nwe obtain the sharp estimate of the mapping norm $\\|\\chi_\\l\\|_{L_2\\to C^\\d}$\n($0<\\d<1$), where $C^\\d(M)$ is the space of H{\\\" o}lder continuous functions\nwith exponent $\\d$ on $M$. Moreover, we show a geometric property of the\neigenfunction $e_\\l$: $\\D_M e_\\l+\\l^2 e_\\l=0$, which says that $1/\\l$ is\ncomparable to the distance between the nodal set of $e_\\l$ (where $e_\\l$\nvanishes) and the concentrating set of $e_\\l$ (where $e_\\l$ attains its maximum\nor minimum) as $\\l\\to\\infty$.\n","Comment: 20 pages, misprints corrected. to appear in the Proceedings of\n  Harmonic Analysis and its Applications at Osaka"]}]
