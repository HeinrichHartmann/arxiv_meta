We present a technique for\nCBsIR that explores relevance feedback, i.e., the user's input on intermediary\nresults, in order to improve retrieval efficiency. Upon modeling images as a\nset of overlapping and recursive tiles, we use a tile re-weighting scheme that\nassigns penalties to each tile of the database images and updates the tile\npenalties for all relevant images retrieved at each iteration using both the\nrelevant and irrelevant images identified by the user. Each tile is modeled by\nmeans of its color content using a compact but very efficient method which can,\nindirectly, capture some notion of texture as well, despite the fact that only\ncolor information is maintained.

In the BCS regime the pair breaking and phase coherence\ntemperature scales are essentially the same allowing strong correlations\nbetween the amplitude and phase of the order parameter. As non-pair breaking\ndisorder is introduced the largely overlapping Cooper pairs conspire to\nmaintain phase coherence such that the critical temperature remains essentially\nunchanged. However, in the BEC regime the pair breaking and phase coherence\ntemperature scales are very different such that non-pair breaking disorder can\naffect dramatically phase coherence, and thus the critical temperature, without\nthe requirement of breaking tightly-bound fermion pairs simultaneously.\nFinally, we find that the superfluid is more robust against weak disorder in\nthe intermediate region between the two regimes.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures"]}]
