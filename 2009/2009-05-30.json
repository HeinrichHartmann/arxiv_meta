In this system the restriction of the long--ranged interface\nfluctuations by particles gives rise to fluctuation--induced forces which are\nequivalent to interactions of Casimir type and which are anisotropic in the\ninterface plane. Since the position and the orientation of the colloids with\nrespect to the interface normal may also fluctuate, this system is an example\nfor the Casimir effect with fluctuating boundary conditions. In the approach\ntaken here, the Casimir interaction is rewritten as the interaction between\nfluctuating multipole moments of an auxiliary charge density--like field\ndefined on the area enclosed by the contact lines. These fluctuations are\ncoupled to fluctuations of multipole moments of the contact line position (due\nto the possible position and orientational fluctuations of the colloids). We\nobtain explicit expressions for the behavior of the Casimir interaction at\nlarge distances for arbitrary ellipsoid aspect ratios. If colloid fluctuations\nare suppressed, the Casimir interaction at large distances is isotropic,\nattractive and long ranged (double--logarithmic in the distance). If, however,\ncolloid fluctuations are included, the Casimir interaction at large distances\nchanges to a power law in the inverse distance and becomes anisotropic. The\nleading power is 4 if only vertical fluctuations of the colloid center are\nallowed, and it becomes 8 if also orientational fluctuations are included.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 6 figures"]}]

Apart from Ep and the lower luminosity, the\nproperties of XRFs are typical of the classical GRBs. Yet, the nature of XRFs\nand the differences from that of GRBs are not understood. In addition, there is\nno consensus on the interpretation of the shallow decay phase observed in most\nX-ray afterglows of both XRFs and GRBs. We examine in detail the case of XRF\n080330 discovered by Swift at the redshift of 1.51. This burst is\nrepresentative of the XRF class and exhibits an X-ray shallow decay. The rich\nand broadband (from NIR to UV) photometric data set we collected across this\nphase makes it an ideal candidate to test the off-axis jet interpretation\nproposed to explain both the softness of XRFs and the shallow decay phase. We\npresent prompt gamma-ray, early and late IR/visible/UV and X-ray observations\nof the XRF 080330. We derive a SED from NIR to X-ray bands across the plateau\nphase with a power-law index of 0.79 +- 0.01 and negligible rest-frame dust\nextinction. The multi-wavelength evolution of the afterglow is achromatic from\n~10^2 s out to ~8x10^4 s. We describe the temporal evolution of the\nmulti-wavelength afterglow within the context of the standard afterglow model\nand show that a single-component jet viewed off-axis explains the observations\n(abriged).\n","Comment: accepted to A&A, 19 pages, 11 figures"]}]
