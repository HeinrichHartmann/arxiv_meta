However, their\npremise is hinged upon an accurate mass-observable relationship, which could be\naffected by the (rather poorly understood) physics of the intracluster gas. In\nthis letter, using a semi-analytic model of the intracluster gas that\naccommodates various theoretical uncertainties, I develop a Fundamental Plane\nrelationship between the observed size, thermal energy, and mass of galaxy\nclusters. In particular, I find that M ~ (Y_{SZ}/R_{SZ,2})^{3/4}, where M is\nthe mass, Y_{SZ} is the total SZ flux or thermal energy, and R_{SZ,2} is the SZ\nhalf-light radius of the cluster. I first show that, within this model, using\nthe Fundamental Plane relationship reduces the (systematic+random) errors in\nmass estimates to 14%, from 22% for a simple mass-flux relationship. Since\nmeasurement of the cluster sizes is an inevitable part of observing the SZ\nclusters, the Fundamental Plane relationship can be used to reduce the error of\nthe cluster mass estimates by ~ 34%, improving the accuracy of the resulting\ncosmological constraints without any extra cost. I then argue why our\nFundamental Plane is distinctly different from the virial relationship that one\nmay naively expect between the cluster parameters. Finally, I argue that while\nincluding more details of the observed SZ profile cannot significantly improve\nthe accuracy of mass estimates, a better understanding of the impact of\nnon-gravitational heating/cooling processes on the outskirts of the\nintracluster medium (apart from external calibrations) might be the best way to\nreduce these errors.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 1 figure, added an analytic derivation of the Fundametal\n  Plane relation (which is distinctly different from the virial relation),\n  submitted to ApJ"]}]

Measurements have\ncontinued with only a few brief interruptions since that time. We give here the\nexperimental improvements in SAGE since its last published data summary in Dec.\n2001. Assuming the solar neutrino production rate was constant during the\nperiod of data collection, combined analysis of 168 extractions through Dec.\n2007 gives a capture rate of solar neutrinos with energy more than 233 keV of\n65.4 (+3.1)(-3.0) (stat) (+2.6)(-2.8) (syst) SNU. The weighted average of the\nresults of all three Ga solar neutrino experiments, SAGE, Gallex, and GNO, is\nnow 66.1 +/- 3.1 SNU, where statistical and systematic uncertainties have been\ncombined in quadrature. During the recent period of data collection a new test\nof SAGE was made with a reactor-produced 37Ar neutrino source. The ratio of\nobserved to calculated rates in this experiment, combined with the measured\nrates in the three prior 51Cr neutrino-source experiments with Ga, is 0.87 +/-\n0.05. A probable explanation for this low result is that the cross section for\nneutrino capture by the two lowest-lying excited states in 71Ge has been\noverestimated. If we assume these cross sections are zero, then the standard\nsolar model including neutrino oscillations predicts a total capture rate in Ga\nin the range of 63-66 SNU with an uncertainty of about 4%, in good agreement\nwith experiment. We derive the current value of the neutrino flux produced in\nthe Sun by the proton-proton fusion reaction to be (6.0 +/- 0.8) x\n10^(10)/(cm^2 s), which agrees well with the pp flux predicted by the standard\nsolar model.
