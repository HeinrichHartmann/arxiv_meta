Capping with\ncoinage-metal (Cu, Ag, Au) elements modifies the SRT depending on the Co and\noverlayer thickness and on the overlayer material, resulting in an expanded\nrange of structures with high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The origin of\nthe SRT can be explained in terms of ab-initio calculations of the\nlayer-resolved contributions to the magnetic anisotropy energy. Besides the\nchanges in the SRT introduced by the capping, a quantitative enhancement of the\nmagnetic anisotropy is identified. A detailed analysis of the interplay between\nstrain and purely electronic effects allows us to identify the conditions that\nlead to a high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in thin hcp Co films.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 10 figures.

Optimization problems in the\nNP-complete class are particularly difficult, it is believed that the number of\noperations required to minimize the cost function is in the most difficult\ncases exponential in the system size. However, even in an NP-complete problem\nthe practically arising instances might, in fact, be easy to solve. The\nprincipal question we address in this thesis is: How to recognize if an\nNP-complete constraint satisfaction problem is typically hard and what are the\nmain reasons for this? We adopt approaches from the statistical physics of\ndisordered systems, in particular the cavity method developed originally to\ndescribe glassy systems. We describe new properties of the space of solutions\nin two of the most studied constraint satisfaction problems - random\nsatisfiability and random graph coloring. We suggest a relation between the\nexistence of the so-called frozen variables and the algorithmic hardness of a\nproblem. Based on these insights, we introduce a new class of problems which we\nnamed \"locked\" constraint satisfaction, where the statistical description is\neasily solvable, but from the algorithmic point of view they are even more\nchallenging than the canonical satisfiability.\n","Comment: PhD thesis"]}]

Classical physics proceeds from\nthe hypothesis that immediate values of all the physical quantities,\ncharacterizing system's state, exist and can be accurately measured in\nprinciple. Non-relativistic quantum mechanics does not reject the existence of\nthe immediate values of the classical physical quantities, nevertheless not\neach of them can be simultaneously measured (the uncertainty principle).\nRelativistic quantum mechanics rejects the existence of the immediate values of\nany physical quantity in principle, and consequently the notion of the system\nstate, including the notion of the wave function, which becomes rigorously\nnondefinable.\n  The task of this work consists in econophysical analysis of the conceptual\nfundamentals and mathematical apparatus of the classical physics, relativity\ntheory, non-relativistic and relativistic quantum mechanics, subject to the\nhistorical, psychological and philosophical aspects and modern state of the\nsocio-economic modeling problem. We have shown that actually and, virtually, a\nlong time ago, new paradigms of modeling were accepted in the quantum theory,\nwithin the bounds of which the notion of the physical quantity operator becomes\nthe primary fundamental conception, description of the system dynamics becomes\ndiscrete and approximate in its essence, prediction of the future, even in the\nrough, is actually impossible when setting aside the aftereffect i.e. the\nmemory.\n","Comment: 23 pages, PDFLaTex"]}]

However, even this relatively simple requirement is beyond the\ncapacity of today's average RFID tag. A recently proposed solution, Fingerprint\nExtraction and Random Number Generation in SRAM (FERNS) [14, 15], involves the\nuse of onboard RAM as the source of \"true\" randomness. Unfortunately, practical\nconsiderations prevent this approach from reaching its full potential. First,\nthis method must compete with other system functionalities for use of memory.\nThus, the amount of uninitialized RAM available for utilization as a randomness\ngenerator may be severely restricted. Second, RAM is subject to data remanence;\nthere is a time period after losing power during which stored data remains\nintact in memory. This means that after a portion of memory has been used for\nentropy collection once it will require a relatively extended period of time\nwithout power before it can be reused. In a usable RFID based security\napplication, which requires multiple or long random numbers, this may lead to\nunacceptably high delays.\n  In this paper, we show that data remanence negatively affects RAM based\nrandom number generation. We demonstrate the practical considerations that must\nbe taken into account when using RAM as an entropy source.
