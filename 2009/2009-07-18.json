We obtained essentially\nthe same estimate in our previous paper \\cite{CF} independent of Halburd et al\n\\cite{HK-1}. We continue our study in this paper by establishing complete\nasymptotic relations amongst the logarithmic differences, difference quotients\nand logarithmic derivatives for finite order meromorphic functions. In addition\nto the potential applications of our new estimates in integrable systems, they\nare also of independent interest. In particular, our findings show that there\nare marked differences between the growth of meromorphic functions with\nNevanlinna order smaller and greater than one. We have established a\n\"difference\" analogue of the classical Wiman-Valiron type estimates for\nmeromorphic functions with order less than one, which allow us to prove all\nentire solutions of linear difference equations (with polynomial coefficients)\nof order less than one must have positive rational order of growth. We have\nalso established that any entire solution to a first order algebraic difference\nequation (with polynomial coefficients) must have a positive order of growth,\nwhich is a \"difference\" analogue of a classical result of P\\'olya.\n","Comment: Accepted by \"Trans.
