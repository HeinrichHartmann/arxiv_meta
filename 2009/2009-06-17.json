In fact, in the context of the\nSchwarzschild solution, the hydrogen atom is described in a completely new way\n: instead of following the usual approach to describe the electron under the\nCoulomb potential by using the minimal coupling, the \"proton-electron\"\ninteraction is rather incorporated in the metric. In this context, we reproduce\nin this dissertation the same equations as predicted in Dirac theory for the\nweak potential approximation. Contrary to the statement made by Barros,\nclaiming that he brought an insignificant correction to the electron levels, at\nthe end of our analysis, we assert that this new approach has the merit of\nreproducing the relativistic spectrum as known in the Dirac theory. These\nspectacular results incite us to wonder about the role of the Principle of\nEquivalence in the foundations of the general theory of relativity.\n","Comment: 104 pages, 3 figures, Magister Thesis, text in french, University of\n  Bejaia (Algeria)"]}]
