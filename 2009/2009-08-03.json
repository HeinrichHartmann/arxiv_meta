As a refinement of their result, we show\nthat the asymptotic order (called \"pitch\" p) of the end determines the limiting\nshape, even when the singular set does accumulate at the end. If the singular\nset is bounded away from the end, we have -1<p<=0. If the singular set\naccumulates at the end, the pitch p is a positive rational number not equal to\n1. Choosing appropriate positive integers n and m so that p=n/m, suitable\nslices of the end by horospheres are asymptotic to d-coverings (d-times wrapped\ncoverings) of epicycloids or d-coverings of hypocycloids with 2n_0 cusps and\nwhose normal directions have winding number m_0, where n=n_0d, m=m_0d (n_0, m_0\nare integers or half-integers) and d is the greatest common divisor of m-n and\nm+n.

The\nsystems, referred to as the nonlinear quantum scissors devices, comprise two\ncoupled nonlinear oscillators (Kerr nonlinear coupler) with one or two of them\npumped by external classical fields. It is shown that the quantum evolution of\nthe pumped couplers can be closed in a two-qubit Hilbert space spanned by\nvacuum and single-photon states only. Thus, the pumped couplers can behave as a\ntwo-qubit system. Analysis of time evolution of the quantum entanglement shows\nthat Bell states can be generated.
