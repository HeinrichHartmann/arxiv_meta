First, we consider the averaging attack where a random\ncoding argument is used to show that the rate 1/2 is achievable with t=2\npirates. Our study is then extended to the general case of arbitrary $t$\nhighlighting the underlying complexity-performance tradeoff. Overall, these\nresults establish the significant performance gains offered by minimum distance\ndecoding as compared to other approaches based on orthogonal codes and\ncorrelation detectors. In the second scenario, we characterize the achievable\nrates, with minimum distance decoding, under any collusion attack that\nsatisfies the marking assumption.

The thin disk models are\nconstructed by taking different values of the wormhole's angular velocity, and\nthe time averaged energy flux, the disk temperature and the emission spectra of\nthe accretion disks are obtained. Comparing the mass accretion in a rotating\nwormhole geometry with the one of a Kerr black hole, we verify that the\nintensity of the flux emerging from the disk surface is greater for wormholes\nthan for rotating black holes with the same geometrical mass and accretion\nrate. We also present the conversion efficiency of the accreting mass into\nradiation, and show that the rotating wormholes provide a much more efficient\nengine for the transformation of the accreting mass into radiation than the\nKerr black holes. Therefore specific signatures appear in the electromagnetic\nspectrum of thin disks around rotating wormholes, thus leading to the\npossibility of distinguishing wormhole geometries by using astrophysical\nobservations of the emission spectra from accretion disks.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 26 figures.

While optimal complementation techniques for finite\nautomata are simple - it suffices to determinize them using a simple subset\nconstruction and to dualize the acceptance condition of the resulting automaton\n- B\\\"uchi complementation is more involved. Indeed, the construction of an\nEXPTIME complementation procedure took a quarter of a century from the\nintroduction of B\\\"uchi automata in the early 60s, and stepwise narrowing the\ngap between the upper and lower bound to a simple exponent (of (6e)n for\nB\\\"uchi automata with n states) took four decades. While the distance between\nthe known upper (O'(0.96 n)n') and lower ('(0.76 n)n') bound on the required\nnumber of states has meanwhile been significantly reduced, an exponential\nfactor remains between them. Also, the upper bound on the size of the\ncomplement automaton is not linear in the bound of its state space. These gaps\nare unsatisfactory from a theoretical point of view, but also because B\\\"uchi\ncomplementation is a useful tool in formal verification, in particular for the\nlanguage containment problem. This paper proposes a B\\\"uchi complementation\nalgorithm whose complexity meets, modulo a quadratic (O(n2)) factor, the known\nlower bound for B\\\"uchi complementation. It thus improves over previous\nconstructions by an exponential factor and concludes the quest for optimal\nB\\\"uchi complementation algorithms.\n"]}]

The colours of\nthese halos are too red to be reconciled with any hitherto known type of\nstellar population, and instead indicative of a very bottom-heavy stellar\ninitial mass function (IMF). Due to the large mass-to-light ratios of such\nstellar halos, they could contribute substantially to the baryonic masses of\ngalaxies while adding very little to their overall luminosities. The red halos\nof galaxies therefore constitute potential reservoirs for some of the baryons\nstill missing from inventories in the low-redshift Universe. While most studies\nof red halos have focused on disk galaxies, a red excess has also been reported\nin the faint outskirts of blue compact galaxies (BCGs). A bottom-heavy IMF can\nexplain the colours of these structures as well, but due to model degeneracies,\nstellar populations with standard IMFs and abnormally high metallicities have\nalso been demonstrated to fit the data. Here, we show that due to recent\ndevelopments in the field of spectral synthesis, the metallicities required in\nthis alternative scenario may be less extreme than previously thought. This\nsuggests that the red excess seen in the outskirts of BCGs may stem from a\nnormal, intermediate-metallicity host galaxy rather than a red halo of the type\nseen around disk galaxies. The inferred host metallicity does, however, still\nrequire the host to be more metal-rich than the gas in the central starburst of\nBCGs, in contradiction with current simulations of how BCGs form.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures.

In the strong\ncorrelation limit, $S[\\gamma^*,\\gamma;{\\bf\\Omega}]$ can be truncated to quartic\norder in the fermionic fields and used as the starting point of a\nstrong-coupling diagrammatic expansion in $t/U$ ($t$ being the intersite\nhopping amplitude and $U$ the on-site Coulomb repulsion).

We introduce tools for analyzing the geometry of\n`projection' maps from these spaces to curve complexes of subsurfaces; from\nthis we obtain information concerning the topology of their asymptotic cones.\nWe deduce several applications of this analysis. One of which is that the\nasymptotic cone of the mapping class group of any surface is tree-graded in the\nsense of Drutu and Sapir; this tree-grading has several consequences including\nanswering a question of Drutu and Sapir concerning relatively hyperbolic\ngroups. Another application is a generalization of the result of Brock and Farb\nthat for low complexity surfaces Teichmueller space, with the Weil-Petersson\nmetric, is delta-hyperbolic. Although for higher complexity surfaces these\nspaces are not delta-hyperbolic, we establish the presence of previously\nunknown negative curvature phenomena in the mapping class group and\nTeichmueller space for arbitrary surfaces.\n","Comment: This is the version published by Geometry & Topology on 21 October\n  2006"]}]
