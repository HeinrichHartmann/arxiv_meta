Rotation leads to the formation of quantized vortices\nwhich order into a vortex array, in close analogy with the behaviour of\nsuperfluid helium. Under conditions of rapid rotation, when the vortex density\nbecomes large, atomic Bose gases offer the possibility to explore the physics\nof quantized vortices in novel parameter regimes. First, there is an\ninteresting regime in which the vortices become sufficiently dense that their\ncores -- as set by the healing length -- start to overlap. In this regime, the\ntheoretical description simplifies, allowing a reduction to single particle\nstates in the lowest Landau level. Second, one can envisage entering a regime\nof very high vortex density, when the number of vortices becomes comparable to\nthe number of particles in the gas. In this regime, theory predicts the\nappearance of a series of strongly correlated phases, which can be viewed as\n{\\it bosonic} versions of fractional quantum Hall states. This article\ndescribes the equilibrium properties of rapidly rotating atomic Bose gases in\nboth the mean-field and the strongly correlated regimes, and related\ntheoretical developments for Bose gases in lattices, for multi-component Bose\ngases, and for atomic Fermi gases.

However in the ballistic limit,\ntheory predicts the existence of chirality-dependent quantum Hall plateaus in a\npn junction. We show that two distinctively separate processes are required for\nthis ballistic-Ohmic plateau transition, namely (i) hole/electron Landau states\nequilibration and (ii) valley iso-spin dilution of the incident Landau edge\nstate. These conclusions are obtained by a simple scattering theory argument,\nand confirmed numerically by performing ensembles of quantum magneto-transport\ncalculations on a 0.1um-wide disordered graphene pn junction within the\ntight-binding model. The former process is achieved by pn interface roughness,\nwhere a pn interface disorder with a root-mean-square roughness of 10nm was\nfound to suffice under typical experimental conditions. The latter process is\nmediated by extrinsic edge roughness for an armchair edge ribbon and by\nintrinsic localized intervalley scattering centers at the edge of the pn\ninterface for a zigzag ribbon. In light of these results, we also examine why\nhigher Ohmic type plateaus are less likely to be observable in experiments.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures"]}]

One of the main challenges in compressed\nsensing is to find the support of a sparse signal. In the literature, several\nbounds on the scaling law of the number of measurements for successful support\nrecovery have been derived where the main focus is on random Gaussian\nmeasurement matrices. In this paper, we investigate the noisy support recovery\nproblem from an estimation theoretic point of view, where no specific\nassumption is made on the underlying measurement matrix. The linear\nmeasurements are perturbed by additive white Gaussian noise. We define the\noutput of a support estimator to be a set of position values in increasing\norder. We set the error between the true and estimated supports as the\n$\\ell_2$-norm of their difference. On the one hand, this choice allows us to\nuse the machinery behind the $\\ell_2$-norm error metric and on the other hand,\nconverts the support recovery into a more intuitive and geometrical problem.\nFirst, by using the Hammersley-Chapman-Robbins (HCR) bound, we derive a\nfundamental lower bound on the performance of any \\emph{unbiased} estimator of\nthe support set. This lower bound provides us with necessary conditions on the\nnumber of measurements for reliable $\\ell_2$-norm support recovery, which we\nspecifically evaluate for uniform Gaussian measurement matrices. Then, we\nanalyze the maximum likelihood estimator and derive conditions under which the\nHCR bound is achievable. This leads us to the number of measurements for the\noptimum decoder which is sufficient for reliable $\\ell_2$-norm support\nrecovery.

In particular, kinetics were derived from experi-ments.\nThe current version is suited to the reduction with pure hydrogen, but an\nextension of the model to CO is planned so that it will also be adapted to the\nsimulation and optimisation of the current DR processes. First re-sults have\nconfirmed that the reduction with hydrogen is much faster than that with CO,\nmaking it possible to design a hydrogen-operated shaft reactor quite smaller\nthan current MIDREX and HYL.\n"]}]

Special attention is paid to the canonical\nrate-distortion function of a source word which returns the minimal Kolmogorov\ncomplexity of all distortion balls containing that word subject to a bound on\ntheir cardinality. This canonical rate-distortion function is related to the\nmore standard algorithmic rate-distortion function for the given distortion\nmeasure. Examples are given of list distortion, Hamming distortion, and\nEuclidean distortion. The algorithmic rate-distortion function can behave\ndifferently from Shannon's rate-distortion function. To this end, we show that\nthe canonical rate-distortion function can and does assume a wide class of\nshapes (unlike Shannon's); we relate low algorithmic mutual information to low\nKolmogorov complexity (and consequently suggest that certain aspects of the\nmutual information formulation of Shannon's rate-distortion function behave\ndifferently than would an analogous formulation using algorithmic mutual\ninformation); we explore the notion that low Kolmogorov complexity distortion\nballs containing a given word capture the interesting properties of that word\n(which is hard to formalize in Shannon's theory) and this suggests an approach\nto denoising; and, finally, we show that the different behavior of the\nrate-distortion curves of individual source words to some extent disappears\nafter averaging over the source words.\n","Comment: LaTex, 31 pages, 2 figures.
