Many previous\ntheoretical studies of flux emergence use a twisted cylindrical tube in the\nsolar interior as the initial condition. Important insights can be gained from\nthis model, however, it does have shortcomings. The axis of the tube never\nfully emerges as dense plasma becomes trapped in magnetic dips and restrains\nits ascent. Also, since the entire tube is buoyant, the main photospheric\nfootpoints (sunspots) continually drift apart. These problems make it difficult\nto produce a convincing sunspot pair. We aim to address these problems by\nconsidering a different initial condition, namely a toroidal flux tube. We\nperform numerical experiments and solve the 3D MHD equations. The dynamics are\ninvestigated through a range of initial field strengths and twists. The\nexperiments demonstrate that the emergence of toroidal flux tubes is highly\ndynamic and exhibits a rich variety of behaviour. In answer to the aims,\nhowever, if the initial field strength is strong enough, the axis of the tube\ncan fully emerge. Also, the sunspot pair does not continually drift apart.\nInstead, its maximum separation is the diameter of the original toroidal tube.\n","Comment: Accepted by A&A: 09 September 2009"]}]

These solutions saturate\nBogomol'ny-Prasad-Sommerfield bounds on their energy densities and are the\ncarriers of the $p$-form charges that appear in the supersymmetry algebra. The\nsimplest such solutions have the character of $(p+1)$-dimensional\nPoincar\\'e-invariant hyperplanes in spacetime, i.e. $p$-branes. Topics covered\ninclude the relations between mass densities, charge densities and the\npreservation of unbroken supersymmetry; interpolating-soliton structure;\ndiagonal and vertical Kaluza-Klein reduction families; multiple-charge\nsolutions and the four D=11 elements; duality-symmetry multiplets; charge\nquantisation; low-velocity scattering and the geometry of worldvolume\nsupersymmetric $\\sigma$-models; and the target-space geometry of BPS instanton\nsolutions obtained by the dimensional reduction of static $p$-branes.\n","Comment: 99 pages, 7 figures, LaTeX, uses epsf.sty.

In the regular\ncase this groupoid coincides with the usual holonomy groupoid of Winkelnkemper\n(1983); the same holds in the singular cases of Bigonnet and Pradines (1985)\nand Debord (2001), which from our point of view can be thought of as being\n\"almost regular\". In the general case, the holonomy groupoid can be quite an\nill behaved geometric object. On the other hand it often has a nice\nlongitudinal smooth structure. Nonetheless, we use this groupoid to generalize\nto the singular case Connes' construction of the C*-algebra of the foliation.\nWe also outline the construction of a longitudinal pseudo-differential\ncalculus; the analytic index of a longitudinally elliptic operator takes place\nin the K-theory of our C*-algebra.\n  In our construction, the key notion is that of a bi-submersion which plays\nthe role of a local Lie groupoid defining the foliation. Our groupoid is the\nquotient of germs of these bi-submersions with respect to an appropriate\nequivalence relation.\n","Comment: 30 pages.
