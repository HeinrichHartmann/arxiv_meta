When $\\alpha<1/2$, the holographic Ricci dark energy\nwill exhibit a quintomlike behavior; i.e., its equation of state will evolve\nacross the cosmological-constant boundary $w=-1$. The parameter $\\alpha$ can be\ndetermined only by observations. Thus, in order to characterize the evolving\nfeature of dark energy and to predict the fate of the universe, it is of\nextraordinary importance to constrain the parameter $\\alpha$ by using the\nobservational data. In this paper, we derive constraints on the holographic\nRicci dark energy model from the latest observational data including the Union\nsample of 307 type Ia supernovae, the shift parameter of the cosmic microwave\nbackground given by the five-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe\nobservations, and the baryon acoustic oscillation measurement from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey. The joint analysis gives the best-fit results (with\n1$\\sigma$ uncertainty): $\\alpha=0.359^{+0.024}_{-0.025}$ and $\\Omega_{\\rm\nm0}=0.318^{+0.026}_{-0.024}$. That is to say, according to the observations,\nthe holographic Ricci dark energy takes on the quintom feature. Finally, in\nlight of the results of the cosmological constraints, we discuss the issue of\nthe scalar-field dark energy reconstruction, based on the scenario of the\nholographic Ricci vacuum energy.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 10 figures; published in Phys.

Finding ways for distinct CDNs to coordinate and cooperate\nwith other CDNs is necessary to achieve better overall service, as perceived by\nend-users, at lower cost. In this paper, we present an architecture to support\npeering arrangements between CDNs, based on a Virtual Organization (VO) model.\nOur approach promotes peering among providers, while upholding user perceived\nperformance.
