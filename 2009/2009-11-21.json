Several\ncritical exponents obtained by finite size scaling analysis are the same as\nthose in the 1D transverse field Ising model, suggesting the same universality\nclass. A logarithmic divergence of the entanglement entropy of a block at the\nquantum critical point is also observed.

In this paper, we investigate a simple stochastic\nprocess--trapping problem, a random walk with a perfect trap fixed at a given\nlocation, performed on a family of hierarchical networks that exhibit\nsimultaneously striking scale-free and modular structure. We focus on a\nparticular case with the immobile trap positioned at the hub node having the\nlargest degree. Using a method based on generating functions, we determine\nexplicitly the mean first-passage time (MFPT) for the trapping problem, which\nis the mean of the node-to-trap first-passage time over the entire network. The\nexact expression for the MFPT is calculated through the recurrence relations\nderived from the special construction of the hierarchical networks. The\nobtained rigorous formula corroborated by extensive direct numerical\ncalculations exhibits that the MFPT grows algebraically with the network order.\nConcretely, the MFPT increases as a power-law function of the number of nodes\nwith the exponent much less than 1. We demonstrate that the hierarchical\nnetworks under consideration have more efficient structure for transport by\ndiffusion in contrast with other analytically soluble media including some\npreviously studied scale-free networks. We argue that the scale-free and\nmodular topologies are responsible for the high efficiency of the trapping\nprocess on the hierarchical networks.\n","Comment: Definitive version accepted for publication in Physical Review E"]}]
