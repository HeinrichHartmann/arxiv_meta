We report new observations of the shell with HST. The knots in the shell\nare expanding with velocities 500-715 km/s, for a distance of 3500 pc. The\nfractional expansion of the knots is constant, and this implies no significant\ndeceleration. Hence, the knots were ejected by an eruption close to the year\n1866. Knots have turned on after 1995, and this demonstrates that the knots are\npowered by shocks from the collision of the 1866 ejecta with fast ejecta from\nlater RN eruptions. The 1866 ejecta has a total mass of 10^-4.5 Msun, which\nwith the low ejection velocity shows that the 1866 event was an ordinary nova\neruption, not a RN eruption. The accretion rate before the ordinary nova event\nmust have been low (around the 4x10^-11 Msun/yr expected for gravitational\nradiation alone) and the matter accumulated on the surface of the white dwarf\nfor ~750,000 years. The current accretion rate (>10^-8 Msun/yr) is 1000X higher\nthan expected for a system below the period gap, with the plausible reason\nbeing that the 1866 event started a continuing supersoft source that drives the\naccretion. A key fact about T Pyx is that its accretion rate has been secularly\ndeclining since before the 1890 eruption, with the current rate being only 3%\nof its earlier rate. The decline in the observed accretion rate shows that the\nsupersoft source is not self-sustaining, and we calculate that the accretion in\nT Pyx will effectively stop in upcoming decades. With this, T Pyx will enter a\nstate of hibernation, lasting for an estimated 2,600,000 years, before\ngravitational radiation brings the system into contact again. Thus, T Pyx has\nan evolutionary cycle going from an ordinary CV state, to its current RN state,\nto a future hibernation state, and then repeating this cycle.\n","Comment: Astrophysical Journal in press, 62 pages, 11 figures (accepted\n  version; minor changes and shortening)"]}]

An important process in neuron-glia\ncommunications is astrocyte encoding of synaptic information transfer: the\nmodulation of intracellular calcium dynamics in astrocytes in response to\nsynaptic activity. Here, we derive and investigate a concise mathematical model\nfor glutamate-induced astrocytic intracellular Ca2+ dynamics that captures the\nessential biochemical features of the regulatory pathway of inositol\n1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). Starting from the well-known two-state Li-Rinzel\nmodel for calcium-induced-calcium release, we incorporate the regulation of the\nIP3 production and phosphorylation. Doing so we extended it to a three-state\nmodel (referred as the G-ChI model), that could account for Ca2+ oscillations\ntriggered by endogenous IP3 metabolism as well as by IP3 production by external\nglutamate signals. Compared to previous similar models, our three-state models\ninclude a more realistic description of the IP3 production and degradation\npathways, lumping together their essential nonlinearities within a concise\nformulation. Using bifurcation analysis and time simulations, we demonstrate\nthe existence of new putative dynamical features. The cross-couplings between\nIP3 and Ca2+ pathways endows the system with self-consistent oscillator\nproperties and favor mixed frequency-amplitude encoding modes over pure\namplitude modulation ones.

This completes\nthe first stage of the calculation, whereby the low-energy ab-initio problem is\ntransformed into an effective tight-binding form. The second stage only\ninvolves Fourier transforms and unitary transformations of the small matrices\nset up in the first stage. With these inexpensive operations, the quantities of\ninterest are interpolated onto a dense k-point mesh and used to evaluate the\nanomalous Hall conductivity as a Brillouin zone integral. The present scheme,\nwhich also avoids the cumbersome summation over all unoccupied states in the\nKubo formula, is applied to bcc Fe, giving excellent agreement with\nconventional, less efficient first-principles calculations.
