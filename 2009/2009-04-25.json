Under certain hypotheses on F^+, we show that Jacquet-Langlands\ncorrespondences between certain automorphic representations of G and\nrepresentations of a group G' isomorphic to G except at infinity can be\nrealized in the cohomology of Shimura varieties attached to G and G'.\n  We obtain these Jacquet-Langlands correspondences by studying the bad\nreduction of a Shimura variety X attached to G at a prime p for which X has\nmaximal parabolic level structure.

This identifies a piece of this weight\nfiltration with a space of algebraic modular forms for G'.
