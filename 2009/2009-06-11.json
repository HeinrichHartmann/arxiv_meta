Very recently, however, meaningful experimental studies of the problem\nhave finally become possible, stimulating theoretical interest as well.\nProgress in this field is perhaps most urgently needed in the foundations of\nquantum statistical mechanics. This is so because in generic isolated systems,\none expects nonequilibrium dynamics on its own to result in thermalization: a\nrelaxation to states where the values of macroscopic quantities are stationary,\nuniversal with respect to widely differing initial conditions, and predictable\nthrough the time-tested recipe of statistical mechanics. However, it is not\nobvious what feature of many-body quantum mechanics makes quantum\nthermalization possible, in a sense analogous to that in which dynamical chaos\nmakes classical thermalization possible. For example, dynamical chaos itself\ncannot occur in an isolated quantum system, where time evolution is linear and\nthe spectrum is discrete. Underscoring that new rules could apply in this case,\nsome recent studies even suggested that statistical mechanics may give wrong\npredictions for the outcomes of relaxation in such systems. Here we demonstrate\nthat an isolated generic quantum many-body system does in fact relax to a state\nwell-described by the standard statistical mechanical prescription. Moreover,\nwe show that time evolution itself plays a merely auxiliary role in relaxation\nand that thermalization happens instead at the level of individual eigenstates,\nas first proposed by J.M. Deutsch and M. Srednicki. A striking consequence of\nthis eigenstate thermalization scenario is that the knowledge of a single\nmany-body eigenstate suffices to compute thermal averages-any eigenstate in the\nmicrocanonical energy window will do, as they all give the same result.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 6 figures, as published"]}]

The main challenge in identifying energetic top quarks is that the\ndecay products become increasingly collimated. This reduces the efficacy of\nconventional methods that exploit the topology of the top decay chain. We focus\non the cases where the decay products of the top quark are reconstructed as a\nsingle jet, a \"top-jet\". The most basic \"top-tag\" method based on jet mass\nmeasurement is considered in detail. To analyze the top-tagging method,\ntheoretical and experimental aspects of the QCD jet background are examined.\nBased on QCD factorization, we derive a simple analytic approximation for the\nshape of the QCD jet mass spectrum.

We consider high-p_T t\\bar{t} production in the Standard\nModel as an example, and show that our theoretical QCD jet mass distributions\ncan efficiently characterize the background via sideband analyses. We show that\nwith 25 fb^{-1} of data, our approach allows us to resolve top-jets with p_T\n$\\ge$ 1 TeV from the QCD background, and about 1.5 TeV top-jets with 100\nfb^{-1}, without relying on b-tagging. To further improve the significance we\nconsider jet shapes (analyzed in 0807.0234 [hep-ph]), which resolve the\nsubstructure of energy flow inside cone jets. A method of measuring top quark\npolarization by using the b-quark p_T is also presented. The main advantages of\nour approach are: (i) the mass distributions are driven by first principle\ncalculations, instead of relying solely on Monte Carlo simulation; (ii) for\nhigh p_T jets (p_T $\\ge$1 TeV), IR-safe jet shape variables are robust against\ndetector resolution effects.

We observed two distinct types of diffuse scattering. The first is\nweak, relatively temperature independent, persists to at least 900 K, and forms\nbow-tie-shaped patterns in reciprocal space centered on (h00) Bragg peaks. We\nassociate this primarily with chemical short-range order. The second is strong,\ntemperature dependent, and forms butterfly-shaped patterns centered on (h00)\nBragg peaks. This diffuse scattering has been attributed to the PNR because it\nresponds to an electric field and vanishes near Td ~ 620K when measured with\nthermal neutrons. Surprisingly, it vanishes at 420K when measured with cold\nneutrons, which provide ~4 times superior energy resolution.

The energy width of the diffuse scattering is resolution limited,\nindicating that the PNR are static on timescales of at least 2 nsec. Transverse\nacoustic (TA) phonon lifetimes are temperature independent up to 900K for q <\n0.2 1/A. This motivates a physical picture in which sufficiently\nlong-wavelength TA phonons average over the PNR; only those TA phonons having\nwavelengths comparable to the size of the PNR are affected. The PMN lattice\nconstant changes by less than 0.001 Angstroms below 300K, but expands rapidly\nat a rate of 2.5x10^-5 1/K at high temperature. The regimes of low and high\nthermal expansion bracket the revised value of Td, which suggests the anomalous\nthermal expansion results from the condensation of static PNR.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in Physical Review B"]}]

The ACS imaging in the F814W filter covered 85\nLAEs of the 119 LAEs identified in the full two square degree field, and 47\nLAEs of them are detected in the ACS images. Nearly half of them are spatially\nextended with a size larger than 0.15 arcsec (~0.88 kpc at z=5.7) up to 0.4\narcsec (~2.5 kpc at z=5.7). The others are nearly unresolved compact objects.\nTwo LAEs show double-component structures, indicating interaction or merging of\nbuilding components to form more massive galaxies.

UV\ncontinuum sizes tend to be larger for LAEs with larger Ly\\alpha emission\nregions as traced by the NB816 imaging. The non-detection of 38 LAEs in the ACS\nimages is likely due to the fact that their surface brightness is even too low\nboth in the UV continuum and Lyalpha emission. Estimating I_814 for the LAEs\nwith ACS non-detection from the z' and NB816 magnitudes, we find that 16 of\nthese are probably LAEs with a size larger than 0.15 arcsec in UV continuum.\nAll these results suggest that our LAE sample contains systematically larger\nLAEs in UV continuum size than those previously studied at z~6.\n","Comment: 71 pages, 18 figures.

The picture is\nparticularly complete if the disorder is 'relevant' or 'irrelevant' in the\nHarris criterion sense: the question addressed is whether quenched disorder\nleads to a critical behavior which is different from the one observed in the\npure, i.e. annealed, system. The Harris criterion prediction is based on the\nsign of the specific heat exponent of the pure system, but it yields no\nprediction in the case of vanishing exponent. This case is called 'marginal',\nand the physical literature is divided on what one should observe for marginal\ndisorder, notably there is no agreement on whether a small amount of disorder\nleads or not to a difference between the critical point of the quenched system\nand the one for the pure system. In a previous work (arXiv:0811.0723) we have\nproven that the two critical points differ at marginality of at least\nexp(-c/beta^4), where c>0 and beta^2 is the disorder variance, for beta in\n(0,1) and Gaussian IID disorder. The purpose of this paper is to improve such a\nresult: we establish in particular that the exp(-c/beta^4) lower bound on the\nshift can be replaced by exp(-c(b)/beta^b), c(b)>0 for b>2 (b=2 is the known\nupper bound and it is the result claimed in [Derrida, Hakim, Vannimenus, JSP\n1992]), and we deal with very general distribution of the IID disorder\nvariables.
