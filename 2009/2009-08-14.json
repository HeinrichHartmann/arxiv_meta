Recently, experiments and\ntheoretical efforts have provided strong evidence for both two- and\nthree-dimensional topological insulators and their novel edge and surface\nstates in semiconductor quantum well structures and several Bi-based compounds.\nA key characteristic of these spin-textured boundary states is their\ninsensitivity to spin-independent scattering, which protects them from\nbackscattering and localization.

For this purpose, the Gibbs extremal conditions\nare slightly modified in order to be applied to a wide class of non-equilibrium\nstates. As usual, it is assumed that the system maximizes the entropy\nfunctional $S$, subjected to the standard conditions; i.e., constant energy and\nnormalization of the probability distribution. However, an extra conserved\nconstraint function $F$ is also assumed to exist, which forces the system to\nremain in the metastable configuration. Further, after assuming additivity for\ntwo quasi-independent subsystems, and that the new constraint commutes with\ndensity matrix $\\rho$, it is argued that F should be an homogeneous function of\nthe density matrix, at least for systems in which the spectrum is sufficiently\ndense to be considered as continuous. The explicit form of $F$ turns to be\n$F(p_{i})=p_{i}^{q}$, where $p_i$ are the eigenvalues of the density matrix and\n$q$ is a real number to be determined. This $q$ number appears as a kind of\nTsallis parameter having the interpretation of the order of homogeneity of the\nconstraint $F$. The procedure is applied to describe the results of the plasma\nexperiment of Huang and Driscoll. The experimentally measured density is\npredicted with a similar precision as it is done with the use of the extremum\nof the enstrophy and Tsallis procedures. However, the present results define\nthe density at all the radial positions. In particular, the smooth tail shown\nby the experimental distribution turns to be predicted by the procedure. In\nthis way, the scheme avoids the non-analyticity of the density profile at large\ndistances arising in both of the mentioned alternative procedures.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 3 figures"]}]

The old controversy\nabout the ambiguities involving terms in the Hamiltonian of order hbar^2\nmultiplying the Gaussian curvature is addressed. We set out to clarify the\nmatter by considering constraints to be the limits of large restoring forces as\nthe constraint coordinates deviate from their constrained values. We find\nadditional ambiguous terms of order hbar^2 involving freedom in the\nconstraining potentials, demonstrating that the classical constrained\nHamiltonian or Lagrangian cannot uniquely specify the quantization: the\nambiguity of directly quantizing a constrained system is inherently\nunresolvable. However, there is never any problem with a physical quantum\nsystem, which cannot have infinite constraint forces and always fluctuates\naround the mean constraint values. The issue is addressed from the perspectives\nof adiabatic approximations in quantum mechanics, Feynman path integrals, and\nsemiclassically in terms of adiabatic actions.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 2 figures"]}]
