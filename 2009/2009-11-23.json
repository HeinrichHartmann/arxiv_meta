This is a new result. Within the\nsemiclassical (WKB) approximation the temperature of the spectrum is given by\nthe semiclassical Hawking temperature. Beyond the semiclassical approximation\nthe thermal nature of the spectrum does not change but the temperature\nundergoes some higher order corrections.

This is interpreted by saying that there exists some kind of agent\n(called dark energy), which exerts an overall repulsive effect on ordinary\nmatter. Dark energy contributes today in the amount of about 73 % to the total\nenergy content of the universe, and its spatial distribution is compatible with\nperfect uniformity. The simplest possible explanation for dark energy is to\nassume that it is just a universal constant, the so called cosmological\nconstant. This would mean that the background arena for all natural phenomena,\nonce all physical matter-energy has been ideally removed, is the de Sitter\nspace time. Thus, the Poincar\\'e group should be replaced by the de Sitter\ngroup, and one is naturally led to a reformulation of the theory of special\nrelativity on these grounds. The absence of a privileged class of equivalent\nframes (inertial frames) suggests that, in de Sitter relativity it would be\ndesirable, to characterize significant physical quantities in an intrinsic way,\nnamely in a manner independent of the choice of any particular coordinate\npatch. In this talk we would like to show how this can be accomplished for any\nset of independent conserved quantities along the geodesic motion of a free de\nSitter particle. These quantities allow for a natural discussion of classical\npointlike scattering and decay processes.\n","Comment: Talk presented to the XVIII SIGRAV Conference, Cosenza (Italy),\n  September 22-25, 2008"]}]

Starting from direct\nelectrostatic field acceleration in the vicinity of the black hole up to\nFermi-type particle acceleration in the jet and beyond, possible efficiency\nconstraints on the energization of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) are\nevaluated. When paradigmatically applied to Cen A, the following results are\nobtained: (i) Proton acceleration to energies of $E_c = 5\\times 10^{19}$ eV and\nbeyond remains challenging and most likely requires the operation of an\nadditional mechanism capable of boosting energetic seed protons up by a factor\nof $\\sim$ten. It is argued that shear acceleration along the large-scale jet in\nCen A could be a promising candidate for this. (ii) Heavier elements, like iron\nnuclei, are more easily accelerated (by, e.g., shocks or direct electrostatic\nfields) and may not need additional boosting to reach $E \\geq E_c$; (iii) If\nCen A indeed proves to be an UHECR source, the cosmic ray composition might\nthus be expected to become heavier above energies of a few times $10^{19}$ eV.\n","Comment: 8 pages, one figure; based on invited talk at the JEM-EUSO Workshop,\n  Torino/Italy, December 2008.

Its principle is to use the fairly short and sparse history of the\nhedge fund returns to identify relevant risk factors among a very broad set of\npossible risk sources. This risk profile is obtained by calibrating a\ncollection of nonlinear single-factor models as opposed to a single\nmulti-factor model. We then use the risk profile and the very long and rich\nhistory of the factors to asses the possible impact of known past crises on the\nfunds, unveiling their hidden risks and so called \"black swans\".\n  In backtests using data of 1060 hedge funds we demonstrate that the SVaR has\nbetter or comparable properties than several common VaR measures - shows less\nVaR exceptions and, perhaps even more importantly, in case of an exception, by\nsmaller amounts.\n  The ultimate test of the StressVaR however, is in its usage as a fund\nallocating tool.

In 6 cases a bright X-ray source was found within the\nINTEGRAL localization region, which permitted to unambigously identify 5 of the\nobjects with nearby galaxies, implying that they have an active galactic\nnucleus (AGN), whereas one source is likely an X-ray binary in LMC. 4 of the 5\nnewly discovered AGNs have measured redshifts in the range 0.025-0.055. The\nX-ray spectra reveal the presence of significant amounts of absorbing gas (NH\nin the range 10^22-10^24 cm^-2) in all 5 AGNs, demonstrating that INTEGRAL is\nstarting to fill in the sample of nearby obscured AGNs.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures, corrected Fig. 2"]}]

We investigate quantitatively\nhow these effects contribute to reducing the acceleration time over the whole\nrange of magnetic field inclinations. It is shown that, for quasi-perpendicular\ninclination, the mirror effect plays a remarkable role in reducing the\nacceleration time; whereas, at relatively small inclination, the anisotropic\ndiffusion effect is dominant in reducing that time.
