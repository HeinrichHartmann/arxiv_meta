Our main results are as follows:\n  * The tropical determinant (i.e., permanent) is multiplicative when all the\ndeterminants involved are tangible.\n  * There exists an adjoint matrix $\\adj{A}$ such that the matrix $A \\adj{A}$\nbehaves much like the identity matrix (times $|A|$).\n  * Every matrix $A$ is a supertropical root of its Hamilton-Cayley polynomial\n$f_A$. If these roots are distinct, then $A$ is conjugate (in a certain\nsupertropical sense) to a diagonal matrix.\n  * The tropical determinant of a matrix $A$ is a ghost iff the rows of $A$ are\ntropically dependent, iff the columns of $A$ are tropically dependent.\n  * Every root of $f_A$ is a \"supertropical\" eigenvalue of $A$ (appropriately\ndefined), and has a tangible supertropical eigenvector.\n","Comment: 24 pages"]}]

B0943+10's\nother mode is well known for its highly regular drifting subpulses that are\napparently produced by a rotating carousel system of 20 beamlets.

We survey our 18 hours of B0943+10 observations and find\nthat the sideband-modulation features, from which the carousel-rotation time\ncan be directly determined, occur rarely--less than 5% of the time--but always\nindicating 20 beamlets.

The spectacular\nsuccesses of ground-based transit surveys (more than 60 transiting systems\nknown to-date) and the host of multi-wavelength, spectro-photometric follow-up\nstudies, carried out in particular by HST and Spitzer, have paved the way to\nthe next generation of transit search projects, which are currently ongoing\n(CoRoT, Kepler), or planned. The possibility of detecting and characterizing\ntransiting Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone of their parent stars\nappears tantalizingly close. In this contribution we briefly review the power\nof the transit technique for characterization of extrasolar planets, summarize\nthe state of the art of both ground-based and space-borne transit search\nprograms, and illustrate how the science of planetary transits fits within the\nBlue Dots perspective.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 3 figures, to be published in the proceedings (ASP Conf.\n  Ser.) of the \"Pathways Towards Habitable Planets\" conference, held in\n  Barcelona (14-18 Sep 2009)"]}]

The inequality holds for\nradial functions if the parameter is larger than -1. Without symmetry\nassumption, it holds if and only if the parameter is in the interval (-1,0].\nThe inequality gives us some insight on the symmetry breaking phenomenon for\nthe extremal functions of the Hardy-Sobolev inequality, as established by\nCaffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg, in two space dimensions. In fact, for suitable sets\nof parameters (asymptotically sharp) we prove symmetry or symmetry breaking by\nmeans of a blow-up method. In this way, the weighted Moser-Trudinger inequality\nappears as a limit case of the Hardy-Sobolev inequality.\n"]}]
