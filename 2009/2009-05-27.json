Extending our previous work on ZrSiO4, the Gibbs free\nenergy has been calculated using a transferable interatomic potential in\nvarious phases over a range of P and T.

However, for both USiO4 and HfSiO4 the huttonite phase is\ndynamically unstable and the scheelite phase is stable as the high pressure\nphase. In fact, the calculations reveal that the stability of the huttonite\nphase is determined by the ionic size of the M-atom; this phase is unstable for\nthe silicate with the smaller Hf and U ions and stable with the larger Th ion.\nThe calculated phase diagrams are in fair agreement with the reported\nexperimental observations.

Specifically, we formulate this problem as a finite-horizon\nMarkov decision process (MDP) by explicitly considering the users'\nheterogeneous multimedia traffic characteristics (e.g. delay deadlines,\ndistortion impacts and dependencies etc.), time-varying network conditions as\nwell as, importantly, their ability to adapt their cross-layer transmission\nstrategies in response to these dynamics. Based on the heterogeneous\ncharacteristics of the media packets, we are able to express the transmission\npriorities between packets as a new type of directed acyclic graph (DAG). This\nDAG provides the necessary structure for determining the optimal cross-layer\nactions in each time slot: the root packet in the DAG will always be selected\nfor transmission since it has the highest positive marginal utility; and the\ncomplexity of the proposed cross-layer solution is demonstrated to linearly\nincrease w.r.t. the number of disconnected packet pairs in the DAG and\nexponentially increase w.r.t. the number of packets on which the current\npackets depend on. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\nsolution significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art cross-layer\nsolutions.

The purpose of this paper is to establish a variety of\nresults concerning odd weight two representations of totally real fields in as\ngreat a generality as we are able. Most of these results are improvements upon\nexisting results. Three of our main results are as follows. (1) We prove a\nmodularity lifting theorem for odd weight two representations, extending a\ntheorem of Kisin to include representations which are not potentially\ncrystalline. (2) We show that essentially any odd weight two representation is\npotentially modular, following the ideas of Taylor. (3) We show that one can\nlift essentially any odd residual representation to a minimally ramified weight\ntwo p-adic representation, using some ideas of Khare-Wintenberger. As an\napplication of these results we show that if rho is a sufficiently irreducible\nodd weight two p-adic representation of a totally real field F and either F has\nodd degree or rho is indecomposable at some finite place away from p then rho\noccurs as the Tate module of a GL_2-type abelian variety.
