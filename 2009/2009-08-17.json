In the limit of fixed $Q^2$ and $x\\to 0$ we found the increase with\nenergy of transverse momenta of quark(antiquark) within q$\\bar q$ pair produced\nby strongly virtual photon. The average $p^2_t$ is evaluated analytically\nwithin the double logarithmic approximation. We demonstrate that the invariant\nmass$^2$ of the q$\\bar q$ pair increases with the energy as\n$M^2_0(x_0/x)^{\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda\\sim 0.4\\alpha_sN_c/\\pi$ for transverse\nphotons, and as $\\sim M^2_0 \\exp{0.17[(4\\alpha_sN_c/\\pi)\\log(x_0/x)]^{1/2}}$\nfor longitudinal photons, where $M^2_0 \\approx 0.7Q^2$ at the energies of the\norder $s_0\\sim 10^4$ GeV$^2$ ($x_0\\sim 10^{-2}$). The magnitude of the effect\ndepends strongly on the small $x$ behavior of the gluon distribution. Similar\npattern of the energy dependence of $M^2$ is found in the LO DGLAP\napproximation generalized to account for $k_t$ factorization. We discuss the\nimpact of the found phenomenon on the dependence of the coherence length on the\ninitial energy and demonstrate that the shape of final hadron state in DIS has\nbiconcave form instead of pancake.

By utilizing measurements of the redshift evolution of the\nmass-metallicity (M-Z) relationship for galaxies, along with a sharp host\nmetallicity cut-off suggested by Modjaz and collaborators, we estimate an upper\nlimit on the stellar mass of a galaxy that can efficiently produce a GRB as a\nfunction of redshift.

At higher redshifts, as the average\nmetallicity of galaxies in the Universe falls, the mass range of galaxies\ncapable of hosting a GRB broadens, with an upper bound approaching the mass of\neven the largest spiral galaxies. We compare these predicted limits to the\ngrowing number of published GRB host masses and find that extremely low\nmetallicity cut-offs of 0.1 to 0.5 solar are effectively ruled out by a large\nnumber of intermediate mass galaxies at low redshift. A mass function that\nincludes a smooth decrease in the efficiency of producing GRBs in galaxies of\nmetallicity above 12+log(O/H)_(KK04) ~ 8.7 can, however, accommodate a majority\nof the measured host galaxy masses.

We have found that the\nnumber density of simulated minihaloes in the early universe is well described\nby the Sheth & Tormen function and consequently the signal powers of simulated\nminihaloes are far greater than the Press & Schechter prediction presented by\nFurlanetto (2006b).

Higher preheating temperature (or\nhigher background entropy) makes the power spectrum of signals more flattened\nbecause the hotter IGM signals are more thermally broadened and minihalo\nfluctuations dominating on small scales are more severely suppressed by the\nhigher background entropy.

The observed optical colors are best fit by composite\nstellar populations which have had approximately constant star formation rates\nfor at least 10 Gyr. The galaxies span a range of central surface brightness,\nfrom 20.5 to 25.0 mag arcsec^{-2}; there is no correlation between surface\nbrightness and star formation history. Although the current star formation\nrates are low, it is possible to reproduce the observed luminosities without a\nmajor starburst episode. The derived gas depletion timescales are long,\ntypically ~20 Gyr. These results indicate that dwarf irregular galaxies will be\nable to continue with their slow, but constant, star formation activity for at\nleast another Hubble time.\n  The sample of isolated dIs is compared to a sample of star bursting dwarf\ngalaxies taken from the literature. The star bursting dwarf galaxies have many\nsimilar properties; the main difference between these two types of gas-rich\ndwarf galaxies is that the current star formation is concentrated in the center\nof the star bursting systems while it is much more distributed in the quiescent\ndIs. This results in pronounced color gradients for the starbursting dwarf\ngalaxies, while the majority of the quiescent dwarf irregular galaxies have\nminor or non-existent color gradients. Thus, the combination of low current\nstar formation rates, blue colors, and the lack of significant color gradients\nindicates that star formation percolates slowly across the disk of normal dwarf\ngalaxies in a quasi-continuous manner.\n","Comment: 16 pages, uses emulateapj, to appear in The Astronomical Journal\n  (April 2001)"]}]

The color of the red\nenvelope is similar from galaxy to galaxy and is consistent with a relatively\nold (>6Gyr) stellar population that is not particularly metal-poor. The color\ndifference between the thin disk and the envelope varies systematically with\nrotation speed, indicating a younger thin disk relative to the red envelope in\nlower mass galaxies. The red stellar envelopes are similar to the MW thick\ndisk, having common surface brightnesses, spatial distributions, mean ages, and\nmetallicities. The ubiquity of the red stellar envelopes implies that the\nformation of the thick disk is a nearly universal feature of disk formation and\nneed not be associated with bulge formation.

Finally, we find that our data and the observed properties of the\nMW thick disk argue in favor of a merger origin for the thick disk population.\nIf so, then the age of the thick disk marks the end of the epoch of major\nmerging, and the age difference between the thin and thick disks can become a\nstrong constraint on cosmological constants and models of galaxy and/or\nstructure formation.\n","Comment: accepted to the September 2002 Astronomical Journal, LaTeX, 31 pages\n  including figures"]}]
