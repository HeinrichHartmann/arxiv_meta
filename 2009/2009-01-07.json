As\nexpected, we find long-range string order both in the longitudinal and in the\ntransverse channel in the Haldane phase, while in the Neel phase only the\nlongitudinal order survives.

In this situation,\nthe standard method used to determine the behavior of cosmological\nperturbations breaks down. We present a generic method, based on the uniform\napproximation, to analytically derive the power spectra of scalar and tensor\nperturbations. For this purpose, a simple hierarchy of parameters, related to\nthe sound speed of the cosmological fluctuations and its successive\nderivatives, is introduced in a k-inflation analogue of the Hubble flow\nfunctions. The scalar spectral index and its running are obtained up to next to\nnext to leading order for all k-inflationary models. This result relies on the\nexistence of a well-motivated initial state, which is not trivial in the\npresent context: having the wavelength of the Fourier mode smaller than the\nsonic horizon is indeed not enough and some conditions on the dynamics of the\nsound speed are also required. Our method is then applied to various models\nencountered in the literature. After deriving a generic slow-roll trajectory\nvalid for any DBI model, simple formulae for the cosmological observables are\nobtained. In particular, the running, as the spectral index, for the so-called\nUV and IR brane inflationary models is found to be uniquely determined by the\n't Hooft coupling.

Another important feature of the presented\nbounds is that they may be used in the case when the parametric set is\nunbounded and non-compact. These bounds do not rely on the entropy or covering\nnumbers and can be easily computed. The most important statistical fact\nresulting from the exponential bonds is a concentration inequality which claims\nthat minimum contrast estimators concentrate with a large probability on the\nlevel set of the rate function.

Therefore, if the SO(10) gauge coupling is to remain\nperturbative up the Planck scale(=2x10^{18} GeV), the scale $M_U$ of GUT\nsymmetry breaking is to be bounded from below. The bound depends upon specific\nHiggs representations used for SO(10) symmetry breaking but, as we find, can\nnot be lower than $1.5x10^{17}$ GeV.
