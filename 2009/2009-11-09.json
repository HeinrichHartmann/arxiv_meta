Later, Geweke has generalized this concept to a multivariate Granger\ncausality, i.e., n variables Granger-cause another variable. Although Granger\ncausality is not \"effective causality\", this concept is useful to infer\ndirectionality and information flow in observational data. Granger causality is\nusually identified by using VAR models due to their simplicity. In the last few\nyears, several VAR-based models were presented in order to model gene\nregulatory networks. Here, we generalize the multivariate Granger causality\nconcept in order to identify Granger causalities between sets of gene\nexpressions, i.e., whether a set of n genes Granger-causes another set of m\ngenes, aiming at identifying and quantifying the flow of information between\ngene networks (or pathways). The concept of Granger causality for sets of\nvariables is presented. Moreover, a method for its identification with a\nbootstrap test is proposed. This method is applied in simulated and also in\nactual biological gene expression data in order to model regulatory networks.\nThis concept may be useful to understand the complete information flow from one\nnetwork or pathway to the other, mainly in regulatory networks. Linking this\nconcept to graph theory, sink and source can be generalized to node sets.\nMoreover, hub and centrality for sets of genes can be defined based on total\ninformation flow. Another application is in annotation, when the functionality\nof a set of genes is unknown, but this set is Granger caused by another set of\ngenes which is well studied. Therefore, this information may be useful to infer\nor construct some hypothesis about the unknown set of genes.\n"]}]

We contribute substantially\nto this area of research by investigating the circumstances under which\ntechnological development may break-out of a trajectory. We argue that for this\nto happen, a third selection mechanism--beyond those of the market and of\ntechnology--needs to upset the lock-in. We model the interaction, or mutual\nshaping among three selection mechanisms, and thus this paper also allows for a\nbetter understanding of when a technology will lock-in into a trajectory, when\na technology may break-out of a lock-in, and when competing technologies may\nco-exist in a balance. As a system is conceptualized to gain a (third) degree\nof freedom, the possibility of bifurcation is introduced into the model. The\nequations, in which interactions between competition and selection mechanisms\ncan be modeled, allow one to specify conditions for lock-in, competitive\nbalance, and break-out.\n"]}]
