In bulk,\nelectronic conduction in these materials takes place mainly through the $s$ and\n$p$ electrons, whereas the magnetic moments are mostly in the narrow\n$d$-electron bands, where they tend to align. This general picture may change\nat the nanoscale because electrons at the surfaces of materials experience\ninteractions that differ from those in the bulk. Here we show direct evidence\nfor such changes: electronic transport in atomic-scale contacts of pure\nferromagnets (iron, cobalt and nickel), despite their strong bulk\nferromagnetism, unexpectedly reveal Kondo physics, that is, the screening of\nlocal magnetic moments by the conduction electrons below a characteristic\ntemperature. The Kondo effect creates a sharp resonance at the Fermi energy,\naffecting the electrical properties of the system;this appears as a Fano-Kondo\nresonance in the conductance characteristics as observed in other artificial\nnanostructures. The study of hundreds of contacts shows material-dependent\nlognormal distributions of the resonance width that arise naturally from Kondo\ntheory. These resonances broaden and disappear with increasing temperature,\nalso as in standard Kondo systems. Our observations, supported by calculations,\nimply that coordination changes can significantly modify magnetism at the\nnanoscale.

For this scheme, we provide the achievable rate\nregion, i.e. the rate-tuple of the common and confidential messages, and\ncharacterize the optimal covariance inputs for some special cases of interest.\nIt is proved that the proposed scheme achieves the optimal degree of freedom\n(d.o.f) region. More specifically, it enables to send l <= L confidential\nmessages and N-l common messages simultaneously over a block of N+L symbols.\nInterestingly, the proposed scheme can be applied to secured multiuser\nscenarios such as the K+1-user frequency-selective BCC with K confidential\nmessages and the two-user frequency-selective BCC with two confidential\nmessages. For each scenario, we provide the achievable secrecy degree of\nfreedom (s.d.o.f.) region of the corresponding frequency-selective BCC and\nprove the optimality of the Vandermonde precoding. One of the appealing\nfeatures of the proposed scheme is that it does not require any specific\nsecrecy encoding technique but can be applied on top of any existing powerful\nencoding schemes.\n","Comment: To appear in EURASIP journal on Wireless Communications and\n  Networking, special issue on Wireless Physical Security, 2009"]}]
