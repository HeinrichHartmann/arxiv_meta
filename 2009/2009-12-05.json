Over the time of deployment, sensors are\nexposed to harsh conditions, causing some of them to fail or to deliver less\naccurate data. If such a degradation remains undetected, the usefulness of a\nsensor network can be greatly reduced. We present an approach that learns\nspatio-temporal correlations between different sensors, and makes use of the\nlearned model to detect misbehaving sensors by using distributed computation\nand only local communication between nodes. We introduce SODESN, a distributed\nrecurrent neural network architecture, and a learning method to train SODESN\nfor fault detection in a distributed scenario. Our approach is evaluated using\ndata from different types of sensors and is able to work well even with\nless-than-perfect link qualities and more than 50% of failed nodes.\n","Comment: 10 pages"]}]

The second class of tools is rather\nphysical: the use of astrophysical observations to crack the degeneracy of\nclasses of dark energy models. In this last case the observations related with\nstructure formation are emphasized both in the linear and non-linear regimes.\nWe exemplify several studies based on our research, such as quintom and\nquinstant dark energy ones. Quintom dark energy paradigm is a hybrid\nconstruction of quintessence and phantom fields, which does not suffer from\nfine-tuning problems associated to phantom field and additionally it preserves\nthe scaling behavior of quintessence. Quintom dark energy is motivated on\ntheoretical grounds as an explanation for the crossing of the phantom divide,\ni.e. the smooth crossing of the dark energy state equation parameter below the\nvalue -1. On the other hand, quinstant dark energy is considered to be formed\nby quintessence and a negative cosmological constant, the inclusion of this\nlater component allows for a viable mechanism to halt acceleration. We comment\nthat the quinstant dark energy scenario gives good predictions for structure\nformation in the linear regime, but fails to do that in the non-linear one, for\nredshifts larger than one.
