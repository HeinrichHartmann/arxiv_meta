Reasoning about the evaluation of an opinion is fundamentally\ndifferent from reasoning about the opinion itself: rather than asking, \"What\ndid Y think of X?\", we are asking, \"What did Z think of Y's opinion of X?\" Here\nwe develop a framework for analyzing and modeling opinion evaluation, using a\nlarge-scale collection of Amazon book reviews as a dataset. We find that the\nperceived helpfulness of a review depends not just on its content but also but\nalso in subtle ways on how the expressed evaluation relates to other\nevaluations of the same product. As part of our approach, we develop novel\nmethods that take advantage of the phenomenon of review \"plagiarism\" to control\nfor the effects of text in opinion evaluation, and we provide a simple and\nnatural mathematical model consistent with our findings. Our analysis also\nallows us to distinguish among the predictions of competing theories from\nsociology and social psychology, and to discover unexpected differences in the\ncollective opinion-evaluation behavior of user populations from different\ncountries.\n"]}]

The model describes nematic liquid\ncrystalline self-assembly of rigid fibers on an arbitrarily curved fluid\nmembrane. The mechanics of the fluid membrane is described by the Helfrich\nbending-torsion model, the fiber self-assembly is described by the 2D Landau-de\nGennes quadrupolar Q-tensor order parameter model, and the fiber-membrane\ninteractions (inspired by an extension of the 2D Maier-Saupe model to curved\nsurfaces) include competing curvo-philic (curvature-seeking) and curvo-phobic\n(curvature-avoiding) effects. Analysis of the free energy reveals three fiber\norientation regimes: (a) along the major curvature, (b) along the minor\ncurvature, (c) away from the principal curvatures, according to the competing\ncurvo-philic and curvo-phobic interactions. The derived shape equation (normal\nstress balance) now includes curvature-nematic ordering contributions, with\nboth bending and torsion renormalizations. Integration of the shape and nematic\norder equations gives a complete model whose solution describes the coupled\nmembrane shape/fiber order state. Applications to cylindrical membranes,\nrelevant to the plant cell wall, shows how growth decreases the fiber order\nparameter and moves the fiber's director from the axial direction towards the\nazimuthal orientation, eventually leading to a state of stress predicted by\npure membranes. The ubiquitous 54.7o cellulose fibril orientation in a\ncylindrical plant cell wall is shown to be predicted by the preset model when\nthe ratio of curvo-phobic and curvo-philic interactions is in the range of the\ncylinder radius.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 4 figures, Submitted to 'Continuum Mechanics and\n  Thermodynamics'"]}]

It is shown that the large width of the QGP bags not only explains the\nobserved deficit in the number of hadronic resonances, but also clarifies the\nreason why the heavy QGP bags cannot be directly observed as metastable states\nin a hadronic phase. I show how the model allows one to estimate the minimal\nvalue of the width of QGP bags being heavier than 2.5 GeV from a variety of the\nlattice QCD data and to get the minimal resonance width at zero temperature of\nabout 600 MeV. The Regge trajectories of large and heavy QGP bags are\nestablished both in a vacuum and in a strongly interacting medium. It is shown\nthat at high temperatures the average mass and width of the QGP bags behave in\naccordance with the upper bound of the Regge trajectory asymptotics (the linear\nasymptotics), whereas at low temperatures (below a half of the Hagedorn\ntemperature T_H [1] they obey the lower bound of the Regge trajectory\nasymptotics (the square root one). Thus, for temperatures below T_H/2 the spin\nof the QGP bags is restricted from above, whereas for temperatures above T_H/2\nthese bags demonstrate the typical Regge behavior consistent with the string\nmodels.\n","Comment: Invited talk given at International School-Seminar on New Physics and\n  Quantum Chromodynamics of External Conditions (NPQCD 2009), Dnipropetrovsk,\n  Ukraine, 3-6 May 2009"]}]
