These findings offer a new null model for the most\nprobable degree distributions in food webs. Having an appropriate null\nhypothesis in place allows informative study of the deviations from it; for\nexample these results suggest that there is relatively little pressure favoring\ngeneralist versus specialist consumption strategies but that there is more\npressure driving the consumer distribution away from the MaxEnt form.
