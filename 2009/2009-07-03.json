We detect the average SZE at a very high significance\nlevel. The average cluster signal is spatially resolved in the W band. This\nmean signal is compared with the expected signal from the same clusters\ncalculated on the basis of archival ROSAT data. From the comparison we conclude\nthat the observed SZE seems to be less than the expected signal derived from\nX-ray measurements when a standard beta-model is assumed for the gas\ndistribution. This conclusion is model dependent. Our predictions depend mostly\non the assumptions made about the core radius of clusters and the slope of the\ngas density profile. Models with steeper profiles are able to simultaneously\nfit both X-ray and WMAP data better than a beta-model. However, the agreement\nis not perfect and we find that it is still difficult to make the X-ray and SZE\nresults agree. A model assuming point source contamination in SZE clusters\nrenders a better fit to the one-dimensional SZE profiles thus suggesting that\ncontamination from point sources could be contributing to a diminution of the\nSZE signal. Selecting a model that better fits both X-ray and WMAP data away\nfrom the very central region, we estimate the level of contamination and find\nthat on average, the point source contamination is on the level of 16 mJy (at\n41 GHz), 26 mJy (at 61 GHz) and 18 mJy (at 94 GHz).

A probabilistically motivated definition of the\nmultiplicative boolean convolution of probability measures on the positive\nhalf-line is proposed.
