We present a theory of\nspin-dependent scattering in the two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) of field\neffect transistors. Our theory shows that the scattering mechanism is dominated\nby virtual transitions to negatively ionized donor levels. This effect\ntranslates into a source-drain current that always gets reduced when donor\nspins are at resonance with a strong microwave field. We propose a model for\ndonor impurities interacting with conduction electrons in a silicon transistor,\nand compare our explicit numerical calculations to electrically detected\nmagnetic resonance (EDMR) experiments. Remarkably, we show that EDMR is optimal\nfor donors placed into a sweet spot located at a narrow depth window quite far\nfrom the 2DEG interface. This allows significant optimization of spin signal\nintensity for the minimal number of donors placed into the sweet spot, enabling\nthe development of single spin readout devices. Our theory reveals an\ninteresting dependence on conduction electron spin polarization p_c. As p_c\nincreases upon spin injection, the EDMR amplitude first increases as p_{c}^{2},\nand then saturates when a polarization threshold p_T is reached. These results\nshow that it is possible to use EDMR as an in-situ probe of carrier spin\npolarization in silicon and other materials with weak spin-orbit coupling.\n"]}]

Dimensional analysis shows that\nthe Planck length l_P - and through it \\hbar and \\Gamma - enters the gauge\nfield action linking ID and gravity in a natural way. Noting that the ID gauge\nfield couples solely through derivatives acting on \"inner\" space variables all\nID fields are Taylor-expanded in \"inner\" space. Integrating out the \"inner\"\nspace variables yields an effective field theory for the coefficient fields\nwith l_P^2 emerging as the expansion parameter. For \\hbar goint to zero only\nthe leading order field does not vanish. This classical field couples to the\nmatter Noether currents and charges related to the translation invariance in\n\"inner\" space. A model coupling this leading order field to a matter point\nsource is established and solved. Interpreting the matter Noether charge in\nterms of gravitational mass Newton's inverse square law is finally derived for\na static gauge field source and a slowly moving test particle. Gravity emerges\nas potentially related to field variations over \"inner\" space and might\nmicroscopically be described by the ID gauge field or equivalently by an\ninfinite string of coefficient fields only the leading term of which is related\nto the macroscopical effects of gravity.\n","Comment: 24 pages"]}]

Our own\nansatz leads to an antiferromagnetic ground state at half filling with a\nslightly reduced staggered order parameter (as compared to simple mean-field\ntheory). Away from half filling, we find d-wave superconductivity, but confined\nto densities where the Fermi surface passes through the antiferromagnetic zone\nboundary (if hopping between both nearest-neighbour and next-nearest-neighbour\nsites is considered). Our results agree surprisingly well with recent numerical\nstudies using the Quantum Cluster method. An interesting trend is found by\ncomparing gap parameters (antiferromagnetic or superconducting) obtained with\ndifferent variational wave functions. They vary by an order of magnitude and\nthus cannot be taken as a characteristic energy scale. In contrast, the order\nparameter is much less sensitive to the degree of sophistication of the\nvariational schemes, at least at and near half filling.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 4 figures, to be published in New J.
