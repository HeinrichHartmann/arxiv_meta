This method is\nused to obtain information about the spin-flavor structure of the quark\ninteraction Hamiltonian from the spectrum of the negative parity L=1 excited\nbaryons. Assuming the most general 2-body quark Hamiltonian, we derive two\ncorrelations among the masses and mixing angles of these states which should\nhold in any quark model.

It\naccounts for most of the heterotrophic soil respiration and results in\nformation of more stable soil organic carbon (SOC) which is the largest\nterrestrial carbon stock. Litter decomposition may induce remarkable feedbacks\nto climate change because it is a climate-dependent process. To investigate the\nglobal patterns of litter decomposition, we developed a description of this\nprocess and tested the validity of this description using a large set of foliar\nlitter mass loss measurements (nearly 10 000 data points derived from\napproximately 70 000 litter bags). We applied the Markov chain Monte Carlo\nmethod to estimate uncertainty in the parameter values and results of our model\ncalled Yasso07. The model appeared globally applicable. It estimated the\neffects of litter type (plant species) and climate on mass loss with little\nsystematic error over the first 10 decomposition years, using only initial\nlitter chemistry, air temperature and precipitation as input variables.\nIllustrative of the global variability in litter mass loss rates, our example\ncalculations showed that a typical conifer litter had 68% of its initial mass\nstill remaining after two decomposition years in tundra while a deciduous\nlitter had only 15% remaining in the tropics. Uncertainty in these estimates, a\ndirect result of the uncertainty of the parameter values of the model, varied\naccording to the distribution of the litter bag data among climate conditions\nand ranged from 2% in tundra to 4% in the tropics.

In multi path time varying environments, it is\nnecessary to estimate time-shifts, scale-shifts (the wideband equivalent of\nDoppler-shifts), and the gains/phases of each of the multiple paths. With\nrecent advances in sparse estimation (or \"compressive sensing\"), new estimation\ntechniques have emerged which yield more accurate estimates of these channel\nparameters than traditional strategies. These estimation strategies, however,\nrestrict potential estimates of time-shifts and scale-shifts to a finite set of\nvalues separated by a choice of grid spacing. A small grid spacing increases\nthe number of potential estimates, thus lowering the quantization error, but\nalso increases complexity and estimation time. Conversely, a large grid spacing\nlowers the number of potential estimates, thus lowering the complexity and\nestimation time, but increases the quantization error. In this thesis, we\nderive an expression which relates the choice of grid spacing to the\nmean-squared quantization error. Furthermore, we consider the case when\nscale-shifts are approximated by Doppler-shifts, and derive a similar\nexpression relating the choice of the grid spacing and the quantization error.\nUsing insights gained from these expressions, we further explore the effects of\nthe choice and grid spacing, and examine when a wideband model can be well\napproximated by a narrowband model.\n","Comment: M.S.

Because it is\nbased on a generalized perturbation theory and the important new emphasis is on\nthe self-consistency of all the dynamical variables involved we call it a\ngravitational perturbation theory with self-consistent backreaction (GP-SCB).\n  As an illustration of how this formalism is implemented we construct\nperturbatively a self-consistent set of equations of motion for an inspiraling\ngravitational binary, which does not require extra assumptions such as slow\nmotion, weak-field or small mass ratio for its formulation. This case should\nencompass the inspiral and possibly the plunge and merger phases of binaries\nwith otherwise general parameters (e.g., mass ratio and relative velocity)\nthough more investigation is needed to substantiate it.\n  In the second part, we discuss how the mass ratio can be treated as a\nperturbation parameter in the post-Newtonian effective field theory (PN-EFT)\napproach, thus extending the work of Goldberger and Rothstein for equal mass\nbinaries to variable mass ratios.
