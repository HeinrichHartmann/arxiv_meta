We discuss conditions for supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking\nand vacuum structures of R-symmetric SUSY models. Especially we find the\nconditions for R-symmetry breaking and runway vacua in global supersymmetric\ntheories. We introduce explicit R-symmetry breaking terms into such models in\nglobal and local supersymmetric theories. We classify explicit R-symmetry\nbreaking terms by the structure of newly appeared SUSY stationary points as a\nconsequence of the R-breaking effect. Based on the generic argument, we propose\nthe scenario that conformal dynamics causes approximate R-symmetry and\nmetastable SUSY breaking vacua at a low energy scale. Furthermore, we find that\nconformal dynamics also leads approximate R-symmetry in softly SUSY breaking\ntheories, even in more complicated models such as the duality cascade. We\ninvestigate the RG flow of SUSY breaking terms as well as supersymmetric\ncouplings in the duality cascade of softly broken supersymmetric theories. We\nalso show the possibility that cascading would be terminated by the gauge\nsymmetry breaking, which is induced by the so-called B-term. Finally, we find\nsome models to arrive at standard-model-like models and to cause gauge symmetry\nbreaking corresponding to electro-weak symmetry breaking.\n","Comment: 96 page, 6 figures.
