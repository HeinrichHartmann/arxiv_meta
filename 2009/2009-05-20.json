While it\nis well known that the MFL of asymptotic flat black hole is equivalent to its\nthermodynamical first law, however we do not know the detail of MFL of black\nhole spacetimes with cosmological constant which possess black hole and\ncosmological event horizons. Then this paper aims to formulate an MFL of the\ntwo-horizon spacetimes. For this purpose, we try to include the effects of two\nhorizons in the MFL. To do so, we make use of the Iyer-Wald formalism and\nextend it to regard the mass parameter and the cosmological constant as two\nindependent variables which make it possible to treat the two horizons on the\nsame footing. Our extended Iyer-Wald formalism preserves the existence of\nconserved Noether current and its associated Noether charge, and gives the\nabstract form of MFL of black hole spacetimes with cosmological constant. Then,\nas a representative application of that formalism, we derive the MFL of\nSchwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime. Our MFL of SdS spacetime relates the\nvariations of three quantities; the mass parameter, the total area of two\nhorizons and the volume enclosed by two horizons. If our MFL is regarded as a\nthermodynamical first law of SdS spacetime, it offers a thermodynamically\nconsistent description of SdS black hole evaporation process: The mass\ndecreases while the volume and the entropy increase.

High-sensitivity microwave surface\nimpedance measurements of the in-plane penetration depth in single crystals of\nelectron-doped PrFeAsO1-y (y~0.1) and hole-doped Ba1-xKxFe2As2 (x~0.55) are\npresented. In clean crystals of Ba1-xKxFe2As2, as well as in PrFeAsO1-y\ncrystals, the penetration depth shows flat temperature dependence at low\ntemperatures, indicating that the superconducting gap opens all over the Fermi\nsurface. The temperature dependence of superfluid density in both systems is\nmost consistent with the existence of two different gaps. In Ba1-xKxFe2As2, we\nfind that the superfluid density is sensitive to degrees of disorder inherent\nin the crystals, implying unconventional impurity effect. We also determine the\nlower critical field $H_{c1}$ in PrFeAsO1-y by using an array of micro-Hall\nprobes. The temperature dependence of $H_{c1}$ saturates at low temperatures,\nfully consistent with the superfluid density determined by microwave\nmeasurements. The anisotropy of $H_{c1}$ has a weak temperature dependence with\nsmaller values than the anisotropy of upper critical fields at low\ntemperatures, which further supports the multi-gap superconductivity in\nFe-arsenide systems. The quasiparticle conductivity shows an enhancement in the\nsuperconducting state, which suggests the reduction of quasiparticle scattering\nrate due to the gap formation below $T_c$.

The new\nobservations show clear evidence of extended features coincident with compact\nand bright masers, the best example of which is a coherent feature over a scale\nof about 20 pc surrounding the shell of the SNR G357.7+0.3. We argue that this\nremarkable feature is an OH maser and is physically associated with the\nremnant. This implies that the ambient molecular cloud is uniform in its\ndensity and temperature with restricted range of pumping conditions and\nsurvives the passage of a large-scale shock front.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 5 figures, one table, Astrophysical Journal (in press)"]}]
