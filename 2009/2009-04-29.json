The simplified, fluctuating point-conductance model of synaptic\nactivity provides the starting point of a variety of methods for the analysis\nof intracellular Vm recordings. In this model, the synaptic excitatory and\ninhibitory conductances are described by Gaussian-distributed stochastic\nvariables, or colored conductance noise. The matching of experimentally\nrecorded Vm distributions to an invertible theoretical expression derived from\nthe model allows the extraction of parameters characterizing the synaptic\nconductance distributions.
