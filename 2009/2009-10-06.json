Measurements have been typically expressed in terms of the\npositron fraction, which exhibits an increase above 10 GeV. Many scenarios have\nbeen proposed to explain this feature, among them some additional primary\npositrons originating from dark matter annihilation in the Galaxy. The PAMELA\nsatellite has provided high quality data that has enabled high accuracy\nstatistical analyses to be made, showing that the increase in the positron\nfraction extends up to about 100 GeV. It is therefore of paramount importance\nto constrain theoretically the expected secondary positron flux to interpret\nthe observations in an accurate way. We find the secondary positron flux to be\nreproduced well by the available observations, and to have theoretical\nuncertainties that we quantify to be as large as about one order of magnitude.\nWe also discuss the positron fraction issue and find that our predictions may\nbe consistent with the data taken before PAMELA. For PAMELA data, we find that\nan excess is probably present after considering uncertainties in the positron\nflux, although its amplitude depends strongly on the assumptions made in\nrelation to the electron flux.

This hole pockets should be present if the\nFermi surface reconstruction is due to a commensurate density wave, assuming\nthat Luttinger sum rule relating the area of the pockets and the total number\nof charge carriers holds. Here we provide possible resolutions of these\napparent paradoxes from the commensurate $d$-density wave theory. To address\nthe first paradox we have computed the ARPES spectral function subject to\ncorrelated disorder, natural to a class of experiments relevant to the\nmaterials studied in quantum oscillations. The intensity of the spectral\nfunction is significantly reduced for the electron pockets for an intermediate\nrange of disorder correlation length, and typically less than half the hole\npocket is visible, mimicking Fermi arcs. Next we show from an exact transfer\nmatrix calculation of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation that the usual disorder\naffects the electron pocket more significantly than the hole pocket. However,\nwhen, in addition, the scattering from vortices in the mixed state is included,\nit wipes out the frequency corresponding to the hole pocket.

Rev. Lett. {\\bf 101}, 206802\n(2008)]. The momentum maps of the LDOS for different types of impurities are\ngiven. In the case of the vacancy, $2q_F$ features are seen in these maps. In\nall momentum space maps, $K$ and $K+K^\\prime$ features are seen. The\n$K+K^\\prime$ features are different from what is seen around zero momentum. An\ninterpretation for these features is given. The calculations reported here are\nvalid for chemical substitution impurities, such as boron and nitrogen atoms,\nas well as for vacancies. It is shown that the density of states close to the\nimpurity is very sensitive to type of disorder: diagonal, non-diagonal, or\nvacancies. In the case of weakly coupled (to the carbon atoms) impurities, the\nlocal density of states presents strong resonances at finite energies, which\nleads to steps in the scanning tunneling currents and to suppression of the\nFano factor.\n","Comment: 21 pages.

So, this\nwork is concerned with the creation, investigation, and optimisation of Digital\nEcosystems, exploiting the self-organising properties of biological ecosystems.\nFirst, we created the Digital Ecosystem, a novel optimisation technique\ninspired by biological ecosystems, where the optimisation works at two levels:\na first optimisation, migration of agents which are distributed in a\ndecentralised peer-to-peer network, operating continuously in time; this\nprocess feeds a second optimisation based on evolutionary computing that\noperates locally on single peers and is aimed at finding solutions to satisfy\nlocally relevant constraints. We then investigated its self-organising aspects,\nstarting with an extension to the definition of Physical Complexity to include\nevolving agent populations. Next, we established stability of evolving agent\npopulations over time, by extending the Chli-DeWilde definition of agent\nstability to include evolutionary dynamics. Further, we evaluated the diversity\nof the software agents within evolving agent populations. To conclude, we\nconsidered alternative augmentations to optimise and accelerate our Digital\nEcosystem, by studying the accelerating effect of a clustering catalyst on the\nevolutionary dynamics. We also studied the optimising effect of targeted\nmigration on the ecological dynamics, through the indirect and emergent\noptimisation of the agent migration patterns. Overall, we have advanced the\nunderstanding of creating Digital Ecosystems, the self-organisation that occurs\nwithin them, and the optimisation of their Ecosystem-Oriented Architecture.\n","Comment: 206 Pages, 73 figures, PhD"]}]

Starting from the\nbound-state Hamiltonian equation of motion in QCD, we derive relativistic\nlight-front wave equations in terms of an invariant impact variable zeta which\nmeasures the separation of the quark and gluonic constituents within the hadron\nat equal light-front time. These equations of motion in physical space-time are\nequivalent to the equations of motion which describe the propagation of spin-J\nmodes in anti--de Sitter (AdS) space. Its eigenvalues give the hadronic\nspectrum, and its eigenmodes represent the probability distribution of the\nhadronic constituents at a given scale. Applications to the light meson and\nbaryon spectra are presented. The predicted meson spectrum has a string-theory\nRegge form M^2 = 4 kappa^2(n+L+S/2); i.e., the square of the eigenmass is\nlinear in both L and n, where n counts the number of nodes of the wavefunction\nin the radial variable zeta. The space-like pion form factor is also well\nreproduced. One thus obtains a remarkable connection between the description of\nhadronic modes in AdS space and the Hamiltonian formulation of QCD in physical\nspace-time quantized on the light-front at fixed light-front time.

A defining\ncharacteristic of the proposed framework is that it is based on two separate\nbut closely intertwined logics: a specification logic that facilitates the\ndescription of computational structure and another logic that exploits the\nspecial characteristics of the specification logic to support reasoning about\nthe computational behavior of systems that are described using it. Both logics\nembody a natural treatment of binding structure by using the lambda-calculus as\na means for representing objects and by incorporating special mechanisms for\nworking with such structure. By using this technique, they lift the treatment\nof binding from the object language into the domain of the relevant meta logic,\nthereby allowing the specification or analysis components to focus on the more\nessential logical aspects of the systems that are encoded.

We argue that the non-LTE corrections for\nabundances derived from atomic features are overestimated in the recent\nabundance studies, while systematic errors in the absolute abundances are\nunderestimated. If we adopt the internal consistency between different\nindicators as a measure of goodness of fit, we obtain intermediate abundances\n[C/H] = 8.44 +/- 0.06, [N/H] = 7.96 +/- 0.10 and [O/H] = 8.75 +/- 0.08. The\nerrors are too large to conclude that there is a solar abundance problem, and\npermit both the high and low scales. However, the center-to-limb continuum flux\nvariations predicted in the simulations appear to be inconsistent with solar\ndata, which would favor the traditional thermal structure and lead to high CNO\nabundances of (8.52, 7.96, 8.80) close to the seismic scale. We argue that\nfurther empirical tests of non-LTE corrections and the thermal structure are\nrequired for precise absolute abundances. The implications for beryllium\ndepletion and possible sources of error in the numerical simulations are\ndiscussed.\n","Comment: 36 pages, 4 figures, submitted ApJ"]}]

Giant eruptions of Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) like the\n19th century event of $\\eta$ Carinae can remove large quantities of mass almost\ninstantaneously, making them significant in stellar evolution. They can\npotentially remove more mass from the star than line-driven winds, especially\nif winds are clumped such that O star mass-loss rates need to be revised\ndownward. When seen in other galaxies as ``supernova impostors'', these\neruptions typically last for less than a decade, and they can remove of order\n10 M$_{\\odot}$ as indicated by massive nebulae around LBVs. Such extreme\nmass-loss rates cannot be driven by radiation pressure on spectral lines.\nInstead, these outbursts must either be continuum-driven super-Eddington winds\nor outright hydrodynamic explosions, both of which are insensitive to\nmetallicity. As such, this eruptive mode of mass loss could play a pivotal role\nfor massive metal-poor stars in the early universe.\n","Comment: 9 pages; to appear in \"Mass Loss from Massive Stars and Stellar\n  Clusters\", meeting in Lunteren, The Netherlands"]}]
