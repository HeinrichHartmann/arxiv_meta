A tachyonic instability in AdS_5 has been proposed\nas the bulk dual of double-trace running. In this paper we make this\ncorrespondence more precise. By standard field theory methods, we show that the\ndouble-trace beta function is quadratic in the coupling, to all orders in\nplanar perturbation theory. Tuning the double-trace coupling to its (complex)\nfixed point, we find conformal dimensions of the form 2 + i b, as formally\nexpected for operators dual to bulk scalars that violate the stability bound.\nWe also show that conformal invariance is broken in perturbation theory if and\nonly if dynamical symmetry breaking occurs. Our analysis is applicable to a\ngeneral large N field theory with vanishing single-trace beta functions.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 6 figures. v3: small changes, version published on JHEP6"]}]

As a consequence, the \"gravitational\" mass and the\n\"inertial\" mass of a star are equal to each other. However, theories that\nenvision our world as embedded in a larger universe, with more than four\ndimensions, permit a number of possible non-Schwarzschild 4D exteriors, which\ntypically lead to {\\it different} masses, violating the weak equivalence\nprinciple of ordinary general relativity. Therefore, the question arises of\nwhether the violation of this principle, i.e., the equality of gravitational\nand inertial mass, is a necessary consequence of the existence of extra\ndimensions. In this paper, in the context of Kaluza-Klein gravity in 5D, we\nshow that the answer to this question is negative. We find a one-parameter\nfamily of asymptotically flat non-Schwarzschild static exteriors for which the\ninertial and gravitational masses are equal to each other, and equal to the\nDeser-Soldate mass. This family is consistent with the Newtonian weak-field\nlimit as well as with the general-relativistic Schwarzschild limit. Thus, we\nconclude that the existence of an extra dimension, and the corresponding\nnon-Schwarzschild exterior, does not necessarily require different masses.\nHowever, to an observer in 4D, it does affect the motion of test particles in\n4D, which is a consequence of the departure from the usual $(4D)$ law of\ngeodesic motion.\n","Comment: V3: The abstract and the Introduction section are improved.

The question\nwe address is whether this sum can be consistently truncated at a given order\nin the derivative expansion, and systematically improved by going to higher\norders. Regularizing the Lippmann-Schwinger equation using a cutoff we find\nthat the cutoff can be taken to infinity only if the effective range is\nnegative.

Comparison of cutoff schemes and dimensional\nregularization reveals that the physical scattering amplitude is sensitive to\nthe choice of regulator. Moreover, we show that the presence of some regulator\nscale, a feature absent in dimensional regularization, is essential if the\neffective field theory of NN scattering is to be useful. We also show that one\ncan define a procedure where finite cutoff dependence in the scattering\namplitude is removed order by order in the effective potential.

Sessler and A.\nTollestrup, Proceedings of the 1996 DPF/DPB Summer Study on High-Energy Physics\n(Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, Menlo Park, CA, 1997)].\n","Comment: 95 pages, 75 figures.
