Upon introducing a degree of nonconformality comparable to\nthat seen in lattice calculations of QCD at temperatures a few times that of\nthe crossover to quark-gluon plasma, we find that the jet quenching parameter\nis affected by the nonconformality by at most 30%, the screening length is\naffected by at most 20%, but the drag and diffusion coefficients for a slowly\nmoving heavy quark can be modified by as much as 80%.

The extremum arises due to the k_t-odd nature of the polarization\ndependent fragmentation function, which probes approximately the derivative of\nthe dipole scattering amplitude. The amplitude changes most strongly around the\nsaturation scale, resulting in a peak in the polarization.

Since a range of x and therefore Q_s values is probed\nat a given transverse momentum and rapidity, this result is a priori not\nexpected. Moreover, the measurement of Lambda polarization over a range of x_F\nvalues actually provides a direct probe of the x dependence of the saturation\nscale. This novel feature is demonstrated for typical LHC kinematics and for\nseveral phenomenological models of the dipole scattering amplitude.
