Taking a stream-computing\nperspective, we can think of each user's performance profile as a stream of\nnumbers (such as response times), and the aggregate performance profile of the\nshared infrastructure as a \"braid\" of these intermixed streams. The monitoring\nsystem's goal then is to untangle this braid sufficiently to track the top k\noutliers. This paper investigates the space complexity of one-pass algorithms\nfor approximating outliers of this kind, proves lower bounds using multi-party\ncommunication complexity, and proposes small-memory heuristic algorithms. On\none hand, stream outliers are easily tracked for simple measures, such as max\nor min, but our theoretical results rule out even good approximations for most\nof the natural measures such as average, median, or the quantiles. On the other\nhand, we show through simulation that our proposed heuristics perform quite\nwell for a variety of synthetic data.\n"]}]
