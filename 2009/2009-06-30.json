Each of these systematic effects can mimic the effective\nprojected matter power spectrum and hence contaminate the lensing\nreconstruction. To demonstrate the effect of these instrumental systematics, we\nconsider two types of experiments, one with a detector noise level for\npolarization of 9.6 uK-arcmin and FWHM of 8.0', typical of upcoming ground and\nballoon-based CMB experiments, and a CMBPol-like instrument with a detector\nnoise level for polarization of 2.0 uK-arcmin and FWHM of 4.0', typical of\nfuture space-based CMB experiments.

The objectives of adopting this concept are to address the several\nmajor difficulties in the application of Active Contours. Primarily, a\ntechnique is developed to realize the topological changes of Parametric Active\nContours (Snakes). The key strategy is to imitate the process of a balloon\nexpanding and filling in a closed space with several objects. After removing\nthe touched balloon surfaces, the objects can be identified by surrounded\nremaining balloon surfaces. A burned region swept by Snakes is utilized to\ntrace the contour and to give a criterion for stopping the movement of Snake\ncurve. When the Snakes terminates evolution totally, through ignoring this\ncriterion, it can form a connected area by evolving the Snakes again and\ncontinuing the region burning. The contours extracted from the boundaries of\nthe burned area can represent the child snake of each object respectively.\nSecondly, a novel scheme is designed to solve the problems of leakage of the\ncontour from the large gaps, and the segmentation error in Geometric Active\nContours (GAC). It divides the segmentation procedure into two processing\nstages. By simulating the wave propagating in the isotropic substance at the\nfinal stage, it can significantly enhance the effect of image force in GAC\nbased on Level Set and give the satisfied solutions to the two problems.\nThirdly, to support the physical models for active contours above, we introduce\na general image force field created on a template plane over the image plane.\nThis force is more adaptable to noisy images with complicated geometric shapes.\n"]}]

In pores satisfying such a condition, but having a\nsignificant spatial variation of surface relaxivity (rho), one can show that\nthe one-to-one mapping may break down.

In this paper, we give a specific condition on Coxeter\npresentations that implies FA_n and show that this condition is in fact\nequivalent to FA_n for n=1 and 2. As part of the proof, we compute the\nGersten-Stallings angles between special subgroups of Coxeter groups.\n","Comment: This is the version published by Algebraic & Geometric Topology on 19\n  November 2006"]}]

If K has unknotting\nnumber one, we show that an unknotting arc for K can always be found which is\ndisjoint from T(K), unless either K is an EM-knot (of Eudave-Munoz) or (S^3,K)\ncontains an EM-tangle after cutting along T(K). As a consequence, we describe\nexactly which large algebraic knots (ie algebraic in the sense of Conway and\ncontaining an essential Conway sphere) have unknotting number one and give a\npractical procedure for deciding this (as well as determining an unknotting\ncrossing). Among the knots up to 11 crossings in Conway's table which are\nobviously large algebraic by virtue of their description in the Conway\nnotation, we determine which have unknotting number one. Combined with the work\nof Ozsvath-Szabo, this determines the knots with 10 or fewer crossings that\nhave unknotting number one. We show that an alternating, large algebraic knot\nwith unknotting number one can always be unknotted in an alternating diagram.\n  As part of the above work, we determine the hyperbolic knots in a solid torus\nwhich admit a non-integral, toroidal Dehn surgery. Finally, we show that having\nunknotting number one is invariant under mutation.\n","Comment: This is the version published by Algebraic & Geometric Topology on 19\n  November 2006"]}]
