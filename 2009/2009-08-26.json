This emerges\nby minimizing the cost of producing a desired effective isotropic radiated\npower, which in turn determines the maximum range of detectability of a\ntransmitted signal. We derive general relations for cost-optimal aperture and\npower.

In particular quantum gravity vacuum fluctuations\nshould represent a universal source of decoherence. To study this problem we\nemploy a stochastic approach that models spacetime fluctuations close to the\nPlanck scale by means of a classical, randomly fluctuating metric (random\ngravity framework). We enrich the classical scheme for metric perturbations\nover a curved background by also including matter fields and metric conformal\nfluctuations.

Finally we argue that a different result follows\nwithin scalar-tensor theories of gravity such as e.g. Brans-Dicke theory. In\nthis case a conformal modulation of the metric arises naturally as a result of\nthe fluctuations in the Brans-Dicke field and quantum dephasing of a test\nparticle is expected to occur.

Are\npresent-day electronic structure techniques able to describe, or -- eventually\neven predict -- such a kind of behavior ? How far are we from materials design\nusing correlated oxides ? These are the central questions we try to address in\nthis article. We review recent attempts of calculating optical properties of\ncorrelated materials within dynamical mean field theory, and summarize results\nfor vanadium dioxide obtained within a novel scheme aiming at particularly\nsimple and efficient calculations of optical transition matrix elements within\nlocalized basis sets. Finally, by optimizing the geometry of \"intelligent\nwindows\", we argue that this kind of technique can in principle be used to\nprovide guidance for experiments, thus giving a rather optimistic answer to the\nabove questions.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 4 figures, Phys.

The dynamical\nperturbation on the inner pair pumps up the eccentricity in a cyclic manner, a\nphenomenon known as Kozai cycling. At times of close periapsis, tidal friction\nreduces the angular momentum of the binary, causing it to shrink. When the\norbital period of the inner pair drops to a few days, fast surface rotation of\nthe companions is driven by tidal forces, boosting activity by a few orders of\nmagnitude.

This problem has been addressed under global error criteria related to\nthe symmetric set difference. However, in certain applications a spatially\nuniform mode of convergence is desirable to ensure that the estimated set is\nclose to the target set everywhere. The Hausdorff error criterion provides this\ndegree of uniformity and, hence, is more appropriate in such situations. It is\nknown that the minimax optimal rate of error convergence for the Hausdorff\nmetric is $(n/\\log n)^{-1/(d+2\\alpha)}$ for level sets with boundaries that\nhave a Lipschitz functional form, where the parameter $\\alpha$ characterizes\nthe regularity of the density around the level of interest. However, the\nestimators proposed in previous work are nonadaptive to the density regularity\nand require knowledge of the parameter $\\alpha$. Furthermore, previously\ndeveloped estimators achieve the minimax optimal rate for rather restricted\nclasses of sets (e.g., the boundary fragment and star-shaped sets) that\neffectively reduce the set estimation problem to a function estimation problem.\nThis characterization precludes level sets with multiple connected components,\nwhich are fundamental to many applications.

Among the\nthree, mixins can be thought of as a generalization of the two others in the\nsense that mixins can incorporate features of ML modules and objects with a set\nof primitive operators with clean semantics. Much work has been devoted to\nbuild mixin-based module systems for practical programming languages. In\nrespect of the operational semantics, previous work notably investigated mixin\ncalculi in call-by-name and call-by-value evaluation settings. In this paper we\nexamine a mixin calculus in a call-by-need, or lazy, evaluation setting. We\ndemonstrate how lazy mixins can be interesting in practice with a series of\nexamples, and formalize the operational semantics by adapting Ancona and\nZucca's concise formalization of call-by-name mixins. We then extend the\nsemantics with constraints to control the evaluation order of components of\nmixins in several ways. The main motivation for considering the constraints is\nto produce side effects in a more explicit order than in a purely lazy,\ndemand-driven setting.
