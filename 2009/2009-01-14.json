The calculated current density at a certain position is found to\ndepend on the magnetic induction. In this way the average field dependence of\nthe critical current density Jc(B) is obtained also at low fields, which is not\naccessible to magnetisation measurements due to the self-field of the sample.\nIt is further shown that an evaluation of magnetisation loops, taking the\nself-field into account, results in a similar dependence in the field range\naccessible to this experiment.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Arbitrary communication channels that can be\ndescribed by linear compact channel operators mapping between normed spaces are\nexamined in this paper. The (well-known) notions of degrees of freedom at level\n$\\epsilon$ and essential dimension of such channels are developed in this\ngeneral setting. We argue that the degrees of freedom at level $\\epsilon$ and\nthe essential dimension fundamentally limit the number of independent signals\nthat can be exchanged between the transmitter and the receiver. We also\ngeneralise the concept of singular values of compact operators to be applicable\nto compact operators defined on arbitrary normed spaces which do not\nnecessarily carry a Hilbert space structure. We show how these generalised\nsingular values can be used to calculate the degrees of freedom at level\n$\\epsilon$ and the essential dimension of compact operators that describe\ncommunication channels. We describe physically realistic channels that require\nsuch general channel models.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 2 figures. Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information\n  Theory"]}]
