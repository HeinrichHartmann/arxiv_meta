The predominant explanation for\nthis is the difficulty of estimating expected returns accurately. In this\npaper, we modify the $n$ stock Black--Scholes model by introducing a new\nparametrization of the drift rates. We solve Markowitz' continuous time\nportfolio problem in this framework. The optimal portfolio weights correspond\nto keeping $1/n$ of the wealth invested in stocks in each of the $n$ Brownian\nmotions. The strategy is applied out-of-sample to a large data set. The\nportfolio weights are stable over time and obtain a significantly higher Sharpe\nratio than the classical $1/n$ strategy.\n","Comment: Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.3150/08-BEJ163 the Bernoulli\n  (http://isi.cbs.nl/bernoulli/) by the International Statistical\n  Institute/Bernoulli Society (http://isi.cbs.nl/BS/bshome.htm)"]}]

Our aim is\nto resolve this controversy by an independent investigation of the reaction\nscheme for a range of H-atom fluxes and different ice temperatures and\nthicknesses. Reaction rates are determined by using a state-of-the-art ultra\nhigh vacuum experimental setup to bombard an interstellar CO ice analog with\nroom temperature H atoms. The reaction of CO + H into H2CO and subsequently\nCH3OH is monitored by a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer in a reflection\nabsorption mode. In addition, after each completed measurement a temperature\nprogrammed desorption experiment is performed to identify the produced species.\nDifferent H-atom fluxes, morphologies, and ice thicknesses are tested. The\nformation of both formaldehyde and methanol via CO hydrogenation is confirmed\nat low temperature (12-20 K). We confirm, as proposed by Hidaka et al., that\nthe discrepancy between the two Japanese studies is mainly due to a difference\nin the applied hydrogen atom flux. The production rate of formaldehyde is found\nto decrease and the penetration column to increase with temperature. In order\nto fully understand the laboratory data, the experimental results are\ninterpreted using Monte Carlo simulations. This technique takes into account\nthe layered structure of CO ice.

Observations of\nyoung, rapidly rotating stars indicate that many possess substantial magnetic\nactivity and strong axisymmetric magnetic fields. We conduct simulations of\ndynamo action in rapidly rotating suns with the 3-D MHD anelastic spherical\nharmonic (ASH) code to explore the complex coupling between rotation,\nconvection and magnetism. Here we study dynamo action realized in the bulk of\nthe convection zone for two systems, rotating at three and five times the\ncurrent solar rate. We find that substantial organized global-scale magnetic\nfields are achieved by dynamo action in these systems. Striking wreathes of\nmagnetism are built in the midst of the convection zone, coexisting with the\nturbulent convection. This is a great surprise, for many solar dynamo theories\nhave suggested that a tachocline of penetration and shear at the base of the\nconvection zone is a crucial ingredient for organized dynamo action, whereas\nthese simulations do not include such tachoclines. Some dynamos achieved in\nthese rapidly rotating states build persistent global-scale fields which\nmaintain amplitude and polarity for thousands of days. In the case at five\ntimes the solar rate, the dynamo can undergo cycles of activity, with fields\nvarying in strength and even changing polarity. As the magnetic fields wax and\nwane in strength, the primary response in the convective flows involves the\naxisymmetric differential rotation, which begins to vary on similar time\nscales. Bands of relatively fast and slow fluid propagate toward the poles on\ntime scales of roughly 500 days.

We\ndetect correlations between the temperature and polarization maps significant\nat more than 10 standard deviations. The correlations are present in all WMAP\nfrequency bands with similar amplitude from 23 to 94 GHz, and are consistent\nwith a superposition of a CMB signal with a weak foreground. The fitted CMB\ncomponent is robust against different data combinations and fitting techniques.\nOn small angular scales theta < 5 deg, the WMAP data show the\ntemperature-polarization correlation expected from adiabatic perturbations in\nthe temperature power spectrum. The data for l > 20 agree well with the signal\npredicted solely from the temperature power spectra, with no additional free\nparameters. We detect excess power on large angular scales (theta > 10 deg)\ncompared to predictions based on the temperature power spectra alone. The\nexcess power is well described by reionization at redshift 11 < z_r < 30 at 95%\nconfidence, depending on the ionization history. A model-independent fit to\nreionization optical depth yields results consistent with the best-fit\nLambdaCDM model, with best fit value tau = 0.17 +- 0.04 at 68% confidence,\nincluding systematic and foreground uncertainties. This value is larger than\nexpected given the detection of a Gunn-Peterson trough in the absorption\nspectra of distant quasars, and implies that the universe has a complex\nionization history: WMAP has detected the signal from an early epoch of\nreionization.\n","Comment: Replaced with version accepted by ApJ; Fig. 9 caption fixed.

If tau is estimated with a single sharp transition we show that there can\nbe a significant bias in the derived value (and therefore a bias in sigma8 as\nwell). For WMAP noise levels the bias in tau is smaller than the statistical\nuncertainty, but for Planck or a cosmic variance limited experiment the tau\nbias could be much larger than the statistical uncertainties. This bias can be\nreduced in the ionization models we consider by fitting a slightly more\ncomplicated ionization history, such as a two-step ionization process.

We point out\nthat the well-known correlation between temperature and polarization\nanisotropies of the CMB further constrains the low multipole anisotropy data.\nThis correlation originates from the fact that the low-multipole polarization\nsignal is sourced by the CMB quadrupole as seen by free electrons during the\nrelatively recent cosmic history. Consequently, the large-angle temperature\nanisotropy data make restrictive predictions for the large-angle polarization\nanisotropy, which depend primarily on the optical depth for electron scattering\nafter cosmological recombination, tau. We show that if current cosmological\nmodels for the generation of large angle anisotropy are correct and the\nCOBE/WMAP data are not significantly contaminated by non-CMB signals, then the\nobserved C_te amplitude on the largest scales is discrepant at the 99.8% level\nwith the observed C_tt for the concordance LCDM model with tau=0.10.

Since 21 cm fluctuations are significantly contaminated by\nforegrounds, such as galactic synchrotron or low-frequency radio point sources,\nthe lack of a significant non-Gaussianity in the signal suggests that any\nsignificant detection of a non-Gaussianity can be due to foregrounds.\nSimilarly, in addition to frequency information that is now proposed to\nseparate 21 cm fluctuations from foregrounds, if the non-Gaussian structure of\nforegrounds is a priori known, one can potentially use this additional\ninformation to further reduce the confusion.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 3 figures"]}]
