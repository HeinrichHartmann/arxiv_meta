The main emphasis will be then on two\nparadigmal neural network architectures showing continuously ongoing\ntransient-state dynamics: saddle point networks and networks of attractor\nrelics.\n  Self-active neural networks are confronted with two seemingly contrasting\ndemands: a stable internal dynamical state and sensitivity to incoming stimuli.\nWe show, that this dilemma can be solved by networks of attractor relics based\non competitive neural dynamics, where the attractor relics compete on one side\nwith each other for transient dominance, and on the other side with the\ndynamical influence of the input signals. Unsupervised and local Hebbian-style\nonline learning then allows the system to build up correlations between the\ninternal dynamical transient states and the sensory input stream. An emergent\ncognitive capability results from this set-up. The system performs online, and\non its own, a non-linear independent component analysis of the sensory data\nstream, all the time being continuously and autonomously active. This process\nmaps the independent components of the sensory input onto the attractor relics,\nwhich acquire in this way a semantic meaning.\n","Comment: keynote review.

The 1D walls are modeled by the error function and the\ntransition from hard to soft walls can be analyzed continuously by varying the\nsoftness parameter $\\sigma$. For $\\sigma\\to 0$ the 1D hard wall limit is\nobtained and the corresponding wall force on the particles is the\n$\\delta$-function. In this limit the interacting particle dynamics agrees with\nprevious results obtained for the 1D hard walls. We show that the two\ninteracting particles in the 1D soft walls model is equivalent to one particle\ninside a soft right triangular billiard. Very small values of $\\sigma$\nsubstantiously change the dynamics inside the billiard and the mean finite-time\nLyapunov exponent decreases significantly as the consequence of regular islands\nwhich appear due to the low-energy double collisions (simultaneous\nparticle-particle-1D wall collisions). The rise of regular islands and sticky\ntrajectories induced by the 1D wall softness is quantified by the number of\noccurrences of the most probable finite-time Lyapunov exponent. On the other\nhand, chaotic motion in the system appears due to the high-energy double\ncollisions. In general we observe that the mean finite-time Lyapunov exponent\ndecreases when $\\sigma$ increases, but the number of occurrences of the most\nprobable finite-time Lyapunov exponent increases, meaning that the phase-space\ndynamics tends to be more ergodiclike. Our results suggest that the transport\nefficiency of interacting particles and heat conduction in periodic structures\nmodeled by billiards will strongly be affected by the smoothness of physically\nrealizable walls.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 20 figures"]}]

Thousands of\nlower-mass pre-main sequence stars accompany the massive stars, and the\nexpanding HII regions paradoxically trigger new star formation as they destroy\ntheir natal clouds. While this schematic picture is established, our\nunderstanding of the complex astrophysical processes involved in clustered star\nformation have only just begun to be elucidated. The technologies are\nchallenging, requiring both high spatial resolution and wide fields at\nwavelengths that penetrate obscuring molecular material and remove\ncontaminating Galactic field stars. We outline several important projects for\nthe coming decade: the IMFs and structures of YSCs; triggered star formation\naround YSC; the fate of OB winds; the stellar populations of Infrared Dark\nClouds; the most massive star clusters in the Galaxy; tracing star formation\nthroughout the Galactic Disk; the Galactic Center region and YSCs in the\nMagellanic Clouds. Programmatic recommendations include: developing a 30m-class\nadaptive optics infrared telescope; support for high-resolution and wide field\nX-ray telescopes; large-aperture sub-millimeter and far-infrared telescopes;\nmulti-object infrared spectrographs; and both numerical and analytical theory.\n","Comment: Science Working Paper for the Astro2010 Decadal Survey.

One motivation for considering this is to give insight into the fairly\ninscrutable Virtual Fibration Conjecture. For the special class of 3-manifolds\nwith tunnel number one, we provide compelling theoretical and experimental\nevidence that fibering is a very rare property. Indeed, in various precise\nsenses it happens with probability 0. Our main theorem is that this is true for\na measured lamination model of random tunnel number one 3-manifolds.\n  The first ingredient is an algorithm of K Brown which can decide if a given\ntunnel number one 3-manifold fibers over the circle.
