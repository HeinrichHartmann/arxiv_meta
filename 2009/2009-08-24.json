Novel structures and materials have\nbeen studied in order to improve the performance of the magnetic tunnel\njunctions (MTJs) performances and understand the fundamental physics in spin\ntorque transfer. The adiabatic spin torque effect, which is due to the spatial\nnon-uniformity of magnetic properties, has been predicted in theory and\ndemonstrated experimentally in magnetic nanowires. However, this important spin\ntorque has been rarely concerned in the magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) because\nof its extremely weak effect in conventional MTJs. This paper reports for the\nfirst time a giant adiabatic spin torque in MTJ devices with a hybrid free\nlayer structure. The generation of the giant adiabatic spin torque was realized\nthrough the introduction of a spatial magnetic non-uniformity in a hybrid free\nlayer along the current direction. It is observed that the giant adiabatic spin\ntorque can substantially promote the current-induced switching process in the\nMTJ devices: the adiabatic spin torque can be larger than the in-plane spin\ntorque, which allows for the switching with a single-polar current under\ndifferent bias fields. Moreover, the adiabatic spin torque, which is\nproportional to the level of spatial non-uniformity, increases during the\nswitching process. The observed effects are confirmed by numerical simulations.\nThese results have far-reaching implications for the future of high-density\nSTT-MRAM devices.\n","Comment: Total 26 pages with 7 figures.

This starburst galaxy (log L_FUV = 10.3 L_sun) is\nconsidered a nearby analogue of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at high redshift.\nThe study of the numerous star clusters in the systems is an effective way to\ninvestigate the formation and evolution of the starburst phase. In fact, the\nSED fitting models have revealed a surprisingly young star cluster population,\nwith ages between 0.5 and 40 Myr, and estimated masses between 10^3 and 10^7\nsolar masses. An independent age estimation has been done with the EW(Halpha)\nanalysis of each cluster. This last analysis has confirmed the young ages of\nthe clusters. We noticed that the clusters with ages between 1 and 10 Myr show\na flux excess in H (NIC3/F160W) and/or I (WFPC2/F814W) bands with respect to\nthe evolutionary models.

However, these studies seldom control for the intrinsic \"quality\" of\npapers or of researchers--\"better\" (however defined) papers or researchers\ncould receive higher citation rates because they are indeed of better quality.\nUsing an original method for controlling the intrinsic value of\npapers--identical duplicate papers published in different journals with\ndifferent impact factors--this paper shows that the journal in which papers are\npublished have a strong influence on their citation rates, as duplicate papers\npublished in high impact journals obtain, on average, twice as much citations\nas their identical counterparts published in journals with lower impact\nfactors. The intrinsic value of a paper is thus not the only reason a given\npaper gets cited or not; there is a specific Matthew effect attached to\njournals and this gives to paper published there an added value over and above\ntheir intrinsic quality.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 2 tables"]}]
