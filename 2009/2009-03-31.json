The first one depends on the information about the current\nphase space distribution of DM particles only, while the second one uses both\nthe initial and final distributions. We discuss the recent data on dSphs as\nwell as astronomical uncertainties in relevant parameters. As an application,\nwe present lower bounds on the mass of DM particles, coming from various dSphs,\nusing both methods. The model-independent bound holds for any type of fermionic\nDM. Stronger, model-dependent bounds are quoted for several DM models (thermal\nrelics, non-resonantly and resonantly produced sterile neutrinos, etc.). The\nlatter bounds rely on the assumption that baryonic feedback cannot\nsignificantly increase the maximum of a distribution function of DM particles.\nFor the scenario in which all the DM is made of sterile neutrinos produced via\nnon-resonant mixing with the active neutrinos (NRP) this gives m_nrp > 1.7 keV.\nCombining these results in their most conservative form with the X-ray bounds\nof DM decay lines, we conclude that the NRP scenario remains allowed in a very\nnarrow parameter window only. This conclusion is independent of the results of\nthe Lyman-alpha analysis. The DM model in which sterile neutrinos are\nresonantly produced in the presence of lepton asymmetry remains viable. Within\nthe minimal neutrino extension of the Standard Model (the nuMSM), both mass and\nthe mixing angle of the DM sterile neutrino are bounded from above and below,\nwhich suggests the possibility for its experimental search.\n","Comment: 20 pages, published in JCAP"]}]

To pursue the proposition in a systematic way we resort to\nthe rotation curves of spiral galaxies. They have non classical features.\nFirst, we design a spacetime metric around the galaxy to accommodate these\nfeatures. Next we calculate the density and pressure of a hypothetical dark\nmatter that could generate such a spacetime. In the weak field regime and for a\nspherical distribution of mass $M$, we are able to assign a dark perfect gas\ncompanion, whose density is almost proportional to $M^{1/2}$ and fades away\nalmost as $r^{-2}$. However, in view of this orderly relation between the\nobservable mass and its dark companion, one may choose to interpret the whole\nscenario as an alternative theory of gravitation.\n","Comment: 4 pages"]}]

Until now, these ideas have been transmitted to different\nin part non-commutative and non-Noetherian algebras. Most of these approaches\nrequire an admissible ordering on terms. In this Ph.D.thesis, the concept of\nGroebner bases is generalized to finitely generated monoid and group rings.\nReduction methods are applied to represent monoid and group elements and to\ndescribe the right-ideal congruence in the corresponding monoid and group\nrings, respectively.

On the other hand, reduction steps are not\ncompatible with multiplication anymore, so that the reduction relation does not\nnecessarily generate a right-ideal congruence. In this thesis, several\npossibilities of defining reduction relations are presented and evaluated\nw.r.t. the described problems. The concept of saturation (i.e. the extension of\na set of polynomials in such a way that the right-ideal congruence it generates\ncan be captured by reduction) is applied to characterize Groebner bases\nrelatively to the different reductions by s-polynomials. Using these concepts\nand special structural properties, it was possible to define special reduction\nrelations for special classes of monoids (e.g., finite, commutative, or free)\nand for different classes of groups (e.g., finite, free, plain, context-free,\nor nilpotent) and to develop terminating algorithms for computing Groebner\nbases w.r.t. these reduction relations.\n","Comment: vi + 225 pages.
