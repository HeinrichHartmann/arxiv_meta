Contrary to claims in the literature, the simulations show that\nthe TRIUMF measurement and those performed at Yale and Mainz originate from the\nsame underlying spectrum. The simulations suggests that the discrepancies\nbetween the Yale and TRIUMF final results can be attributed to incorrect\ndeconvolution methods applied in the former case.

For Gaussian channels with secrecy constraints, however, efforts to\ndate rely on random codes. In this work, we advocate that structured codes are\nuseful for providing secrecy, and show how to compute the secrecy rate when\nstructured codes are used. In particular, we solve the problem of bounding\nequivocation rates with one important class of structured codes, i.e., nested\nlattice codes. Having established this result, we next demonstrate the use of\nstructured codes for secrecy in two-user Gaussian channels. In particular, with\nstructured codes, we prove that a positive secure degree of freedom is\nachievable for a large class of fully connected Gaussian channels as long as\nthe channel is not degraded. By way of this, for these channels, we establish\nthat structured codes outperform Gaussian random codes at high SNR. This class\nof channels include the two-user multiple access wiretap channel, the two-user\ninterference channel with confidential messages and the two-user interference\nwiretap channel. A notable consequence of this result is that, unlike the case\nwith Gaussian random codes, using structured codes for both transmission and\ncooperative jamming, it is possible to achieve an arbitrary large secrecy rate\ngiven enough power.\n","Comment: 50 pages.
