The seller\nsets the prices on individual items. Each buyer buys a subset of yet unsold\nitems that maximizes her utility. Our goal is to design pricing strategies that\nguarantee an expected revenue that is within a small factor $\\alpha$ of the\nmaximum possible social welfare -- an upper bound on the maximum revenue that\ncan be generated. Most earlier work has focused on the unlimited supply\nsetting, where selling items to some buyer does not affect their availability\nto the future buyers. Balcan et. al. (EC 2008) studied the limited supply\nsetting, giving a randomized strategy that assigns a single price to all items\n(uniform strategy), and never changes it (static strategy), that gives an\n$2^{O(\\sqrt{\\log n \\log \\log n})}$-approximation, and moreover, no static\nuniform pricing strategy can give better than $2^{\\Omega(\\log^{1/4} n)}$-\napproximation. We improve this lower bound to $2^{\\Omega(sqrt{\\log n})}$.\n  We consider dynamic uniform strategies, which can change the price upon the\narrival of each buyer but the price on all unsold items is the same at all\ntimes, and static non-uniform strategies, which can assign different prices to\ndifferent items but can never change it after setting it initially. We design\nsuch pricing strategies that give a poly-logarithmic approximation to maximum\nrevenue. Thus in the limited supply setting, our results highlight a strong\nseparation between the power of dynamic and non-uniform pricing versus static\nuniform pricing. To our knowledge, this is the first non-trivial analysis of\ndynamic and non-uniform pricing schemes for revenue maximization.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 0 figure"]}]

We\nidentify the most general (universal) TQFT that can be used to create link\nhomology and find that it is \"smaller\" than the TQFT previously reported by\nKhovanov as the universal link homology theory. We give a new method of\nextracting all other link homology theories (including Khovanov's universal\nTQFT) directly from the universal geometric complex, along with new homology\ntheories that hold a controlled amount of information. We achieve these goals\nby making a classification of surfaces (with boundaries) modulo the 4TU/S/T\nrelations, a process involving the introduction of genus generating operators.\nThese operators enable us to explore the relation between the geometric complex\nand its algebraic structure.\n","Comment: This is the version published by Algebraic & Geometric Topology on 1\n  November 2006"]}]
