We define the bimeromorphic {\\it\ncategory} of geometric orbifolds. These interpolate between (compact K\\\" ahler)\nmanifolds and such manifolds with logarithmic structure. These geometric\norbifolds are considered from the point of view of their geometry, and thus\nequipped with the usual invariants of varieties: morphisms and bimeromorphic\nmaps, differential forms, fundamental groups and universal covers, fields of\ndefinition and rational points. The most elementary properties, directly\nadapted from the case of varieties without orbifold structure, are established\nhere. The arguments of [Ca01] can then be directly adapted to extend the main\nstructure results to this orbifold category. We hope to come back to deeper\naspects later. The motivation is that the natural frame for the theory of\nclassification of compact K\\\" ahler (and complex projective) manifolds includes\nat least the category of orbifolds, as shown in [Ca01] by the fonctorial\ndecomposition of {\\it special} manifolds as tower of orbifolds with either\n$\\kappa_+=-\\infty$ or $\\kappa=0$, and also, seemingly, by the minimal model\nprogram, in which most proofs work only after the adjunction of a \"boundary\".\n  Also, fibrations enjoy in the bimeromorphic category of geometric orbifolds\nextension properties not satisfied in the category of varieties without\norbifold structure, permitting to express invariants of the total space from\nthose of the generic fibre and of the base. For example, the natural sequence\nof fundamental groups is exact there; also the total space is special if so are\nthe generic fibre and the base.

However, computably random sequences can\nhave properties that one may consider to be incompatible with being random, in\nparticular, there are computably random sequences that are highly compressible.\nThe concept of Martin-Loef randomness is much better behaved in this and other\nrespects, on the other hand its definition in terms of martingales is\nconsiderably less natural.
