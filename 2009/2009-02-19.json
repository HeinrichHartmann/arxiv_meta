Within the next 10 years, the European space astrometry mission\nGaia, to be launched by 2011, will permit determination of the extragalactic\nreference frame directly in the visible for the first time. Aligning these two\nframes with the highest accuracy will therefore be very important in the future\nfor ensuring consistency between the measured radio and optical positions. This\npaper is aimed at evaluating the current astrometric suitability of the\nindividual ICRF radio sources which are considered appropriate for the\nalignment with the future Gaia frame. To this purpose, we cross-identified the\nICRF and the optical catalog V\\'eron-Cetty and V\\'eron (2006), to identify the\noptically-bright ICRF sources that will be positioned with the highest accuracy\nwith Gaia. Then we investigated the astrometric suitability of these sources by\nexamining their VLBI brightness distribution. We identified 243 candidate ICRF\nsources for the alignment with the Gaia frame (with an optical counterpart\nbrighter than the apparent magnitude 18), but only 70 of these (10% of the ICRF\nsources) are found to have the necessary high astrometric quality (i.e. a\nbrightness distribution that is compact enough) for this link. Additionally, it\nwas found that the QSOs that will have the most accurate positions in the Gaia\nframe tend to have less-accurate VLBI positions, most probably because of their\nphysical structures. Altogether, this indicates that identifying other\nhigh-quality VLBI radio sources suitable for the alignment with the future Gaia\nframe is mandatory.\n","Comment: To be published in A&A (2008) p"]}]

While there have been numerous studies correlating the architecture\nof cellular reaction networks with noise tolerance, only a limited effort has\nbeen made to understand the dynamic role of protein-protein interactions. Here\nwe have developed a fully stochastic model for the positive feedback control of\na single gene, as well as a pair of genes (toggle switch), integrating\nquantitative results from previous in vivo and in vitro studies.

For the toggle switch, we additionally find that\nthe presence of a protein dimer, either homodimer or heterodimer, may\nsignificantly reduce its random switching rate. Hence, the dimer promotes the\nrobust function of bistable switches by preventing the uninduced (induced)\nstate from randomly being induced (uninduced). The specific binding between\nregulatory proteins provides a buffer that may prevent the propagation of\nfluctuations in genetic activity. The capacity of the buffer is a non-monotonic\nfunction of association-dissociation rates.

Therefore, such a\nclose-in extrasolar planet is not protected by an extended magnetosphere. (b)\nThe small orbital distance of the planet exposes it to a much denser stellar\nwind than that prevailing at larger orbital distances. This dense stellar wind\nleads to additional compression of the magnetosphere, which can further reduce\nthe shielding efficiency against GCRs.

Instead, the weak\nshielding of M star planets can be attributed to their small magnetic moment.\nWe further analyse how the planetary mass and composition influence the\nplanetary magnetic moment, and thus modify the cosmic ray shielding efficiency.\nWe show that more massive planets are not necessarily better protected against\ngalactic cosmic rays, but that the planetary bulk composition can play an\nimportant role.\n","Comment: 7 figures"]}]

The processing causing the extreme asymmetry\nof the profiles are characterized by one or several polarity reversal along the\nline of sight as well as by complicated velocity and field strength gradients.\nThe greater the number of profile lobes, the greater is the probability of the\nfield gradient sign change. Hence it follows that the magnetic field should be\nvery complicated in the regions of formation of extremely asymmetric $V$\nprofiles.

Our GMRT survey provides a\nrepresentative sample of systems that can be used in combination with various\nfollow-up observations: (1) for investigating the physical conditions in the\nabsorbing gas using spin temperature measurements, (2) for investigating the\neffect of metallicity and dust content on the detectability of 21-cm\nabsorption, (3) for studying the morphology of the absorbing gas and (4) for\nprobing the time evolution of various fundamental constants. Results from the\nfirst phase of our survey are presented in Gupta et al. (2007). Detailed\ndescription of the entire sample and results from the survey are presented in\nGupta et al.

Barkhausen noise (BN) is generated by the\ndiscontinuous motion of magnetic domains as they interact with impurities and\ndefects. BN is one of the many examples of crackling noise, arising in a\nvariety of contexts with remarkably similar features, and occurring when a\nsystem responds in a jerky manner to a smooth external forcing. Among all\ncrackling system, we focus on BN, where a complete and consistent picture\nemerges thanks to an exactly solvable model of avalanche dynamics, known as the\nABBM model, which ultimately describes the system in terms of a Langevin\nequation for the velocity of the avalanche front. Despite its simplicity, the\nABBM model is able to accurately reproduce the phenomenology observed in the\nexperiments on a large class of magnetic materials, as long as universal\nproperties are involved. To complete the picture and to understand the\nlong-standing discrepancy between the ABBM theory and the experiments, which\notherwise agree exceptionally well, consisting of the puzzling asymmetric shape\nof the noise pulses, microscopic details must be taken into account, namely the\neffects of eddy current retardation. These effects can be incorporated in the\nmodel, and result, to a first-order approximation, in a negative effective mass\nassociated with the wall. The progress made in understanding BN is potentially\nrelevant for other crackling systems: on the one hand, the ABBM model turns out\nto be a paradigmatic model for the universal behaviour of avalanche dynamics;\non the other hand, the microscopic explanation of the asymmetry in the noise\npulses suggests that inertial effects may also be at the origin of pulses\nasymmetry observed in other crackling systems.\n","Comment: 91 pages, 36 figures"]}]

In this paper, we calculate the CMB\ntemperature anisotropies generated by including a power-law magnetic field at\nthe photon last-scattering surface (PLSS). We then deduce an upper limit on the\nPMF based on our theoretical analysis of the power excess on small angular\nscales. We have taken into account several important effects such as the\nmodified matter sound speed in the presence of a magnetic field. An upper limit\nto the field strength of $|B_\\lambda|\\lesssim$ 4.7 nG at the present scale of 1\nMpc is deduced. This is obtained by comparing the calculated theoretical result\nincluding the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect with recent observed data on the\nsmall-scale CMB anisotropies from the $Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe$\n(WMAP), the Cosmic Background Imager (CBI), and the Arcminute Cosmology\nBolometer Array Receiver (ACBAR). We discuss several possible mechanisms for\nthe generation and evolution of the PMF.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 4 figures, accepted to ApJ April 10, 2006"]}]

We analyze the equilibrium\nbehaviour of this model, both in the forward and in the backward direction of\ntime; the backward point of view emerges if the ancestry of individuals chosen\nrandomly from the present population is traced back into the past.\n  The second approach is the Moran model with selection. Here, the population\nhas constant size N. Individuals reproduce (at rates depending on their types),\nthe offspring inherits the parent's type, and replaces a randomly chosen\nindividual (to keep population size constant). Independently of the\nreproduction process, individuals can change type. As in the branching model,\nwe consider the ancestral lines of single individuals chosen from the\nequilibrium population. We use analytical results of Fearnhead (2002) to\ndetermine the explicit properties, and parameter dependence, of the ancestral\ndistribution of types, and its relationship with the stationary distribution in\nforward time.\n","Comment: minor changes, updated references; Banach Center Publications, in\n  press"]}]
