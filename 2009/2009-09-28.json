For black holes that are active, we\ndistinguish between two distinct modes of feedback, depending on the black hole\naccretion rate itself. Black holes that accrete at high rates are assumed to be\nin a `quasar regime', where we model their feedback by thermally coupling a\nsmall fraction of their bolometric luminosity to the surrounding gas.

From the point of virialization, we\nfollow the protostellar collapse up to densities of $\\sim10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$ in\na one-zone model. In the intergalactic medium (IGM), comoving field strengths\nof $\\gtrsim0.1$ nG lead to Jeans masses of $10^8 M_\\odot$ or more and thus\ndelay gravitational collapse in the first halos until they are sufficiently\nmassive. During protostellar collapse, we find that the temperature minimum at\ndensities of $\\sim10^3$ cm$^{-3}$ does not change significantly, such that the\ncharacteristic mass scale for fragmentation is not affected. However, we find a\nsignificant temperature increase at higher densities for comoving field\nstrengths of $\\gtrsim0.1$ nG.

After the formation of the protostar, the\nincreased gas temperatures may enhance the protostellar accretion rate. Our\nmodel confirms that initial weak magnetic fields may be amplified considerably\nduring gravitational collapse and become dynamically relevant.

We find that tidal evolution has two effects. First,\nplanets start their evolution at larger semi-major axis, allowing them to\ncontract more efficiently at earlier times. Second, tidal heating can\nsignificantly inflate the radius when the orbit is being circularized, but this\neffect on the radius is short-lived thereafter.

The\nfractional change in the resistance is as much as 70 % at room temperature for\nEth = 95 V/cm.

A thread can write to an address only if\nno other thread owns it, and can read from an address only if it owns it or it\nis shared and the thread has flushed its store buffer since it last wrote to an\naddress it did not own. This discipline covers both coarse-grained concurrency\n(where data is protected by locks) as well as fine-grained concurrency (where\natomic operations race to memory).\n  We formalize this discipline in Isabelle/HOL, and prove that if every\nexecution of a program in a system without store buffers follows the\ndiscipline, then every execution of the program with store buffers is\nsequentially consistent.

Its application\nto the Virgo cluster has subsequently led to the claim that the Virgo dEs are\nnot lying in the cluster core but are distributed in a prolate structure\nstretching from 8 to 20 Mpc distance (Young & Currie 1995). This claim is\nrefuted here. We have fitted a Sersic law to the surface brightness profiles of\n128 Virgo cluster dEs and dS0s from the photometry of Binggeli & Cameron\n(1991). The dispersion of the n-M relation is indeed large. However, we argue\nthat this scatter is not due to the depth of the Virgo cluster, but is\nessentially intrinsic. Contrary to what one would expect from the cluster depth\nhypothesis, there is no clear velocity-``distance'' relation for a sample of 43\nVirgo dEs and dS0s with known redshifts. The analysis of Young & Currie (1995)\nis hampered by the use of low-resolution photometry and flawed by the\nassumption that the n-M and n-R relations can be used independently. By\ncombining different Sersic law parameters, the scatter of the scaling relations\ncan be reduced somewhat, but never below sigma_{rms} approx 0.7 mag, at least\nfor the Virgo cluster. For the purpose of distance measurements, this is\ncomparable to what one can get already from the <mu>_{eff}-M relation for dEs,\nwhich does not require any profile modelling.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 11 figures, accepted by A&A, December 1997"]}]
