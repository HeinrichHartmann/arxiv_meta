For SPJ\nqueries, the semantics of the SQL standard treat query answers as multisets\n(a.k.a. bags), whereas the stored relations may be treated either as sets,\nwhich is called bag-set semantics for query evaluation, or as bags, which is\ncalled bag semantics. (Under set semantics, both query answers and stored\nrelations are treated as sets.)\n  In the context of the above Query-Reformulation Problem, we develop a\ncomprehensive framework for equivalence of CQ queries under bag and bag-set\nsemantics in presence of embedded dependencies, and make a number of conceptual\nand technical contributions. Specifically, we develop equivalence tests for CQ\nqueries in presence of arbitrary sets of embedded dependencies under bag and\nbag-set semantics, under the condition that chase [9] under set semantics\n(set-chase) on the inputs terminates. We also present equivalence tests for\naggregate CQ queries in presence of embedded dependencies. We use our\nequivalence tests to develop sound and complete (whenever set-chase on the\ninputs terminates) algorithms for solving instances of the Query-Reformulation\nProblem with CQ queries under each of bag and bag-set semantics, as well as for\ninstances of the problem with aggregate queries.\n","Comment: Correction of the previous version as described in the last sentence\n  of the Abstract"]}]
