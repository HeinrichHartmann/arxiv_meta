Although various dynamical\nprocesses have been investigated in scale-free small-world networks, analytical\nresearch about random walks on such networks is much less. In this paper, we\nwill study analytically the scaling of the mean first-passage time (MFPT) for\nrandom walks on scale-free small-world networks. To this end, we first map the\nclassical Koch fractal to a network, called Koch network. According to this\nproposed mapping, we present an iterative algorithm for generating the Koch\nnetwork, based on which we derive closed-form expressions for the relevant\ntopological features, such as degree distribution, clustering coefficient,\naverage path length, and degree correlations. The obtained solutions show that\nthe Koch network exhibits scale-free behavior and small-world effect. Then, we\ninvestigate the standard random walks and trapping issue on the Koch network.\nThrough the recurrence relations derived from the structure of the Koch\nnetwork, we obtain the exact scaling for the MFPT. We show that in the infinite\nnetwork order limit, the MFPT grows linearly with the number of all nodes in\nthe network. The obtained analytical results are corroborated by direct\nextensive numerical calculations. In addition, we also determine the scaling\nefficiency exponents characterizing random walks on the Koch network.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 8 figures.

The topological entropy is used to measure the behavior\nof the topological order. Topological order in color code arises from the\ncolored string-net structures. By imposing the hard constrained limit the exact\nsolution of the entanglement entropy becomes possible. For finite size systems,\nby raising the temperature, one type of string-net structure is thermalized and\nthe associative topological entropy vanishes. In the thermodynamic limit the\nunderlying topological order is fragile even at very low temperatures. Taking\nfirst the thermodynamic limit and then the zero-temperature limit and vice\nversa does not commute, and their difference is related only to the topology of\nregions.

Examples include age of disease onset,\nrates of amino acid substitutions, and composition of ecological communities.\nThe macroscopic patterns in each problem often vary around a characteristic\nshape that can be generated by neutral processes. A neutral generative model\nassumes that each microscopic process follows unbiased stochastic fluctuations:\nrandom connections of network nodes; amino acid substitutions with no effect on\nfitness; species that arise or disappear from communities randomly. These\nneutral generative models often match common patterns of nature. In this paper,\nI present the theoretical background by which we can understand why these\nneutral generative models are so successful. I show how the classic patterns\nsuch as Poisson and Gaussian arise. Each classic pattern was often discovered\nby a simple neutral generative model. The neutral patterns share a special\ncharacteristic: they describe the patterns of nature that follow from simple\nconstraints on information. For example, any aggregation of processes that\npreserves information only about the mean and variance attracts to the Gaussian\npattern; any aggregation that preserves information only about the mean\nattracts to the exponential pattern; any aggregation that preserves information\nonly about the geometric mean attracts to the power law pattern. I present an\ninformational framework of the common patterns of nature based on the method of\nmaximum entropy. This framework shows that each neutral generative model is a\nspecial case that helps to discover a particular set of informational\nconstraints; those informational constraints define a much wider domain of\nnon-neutral generative processes that attract to the same neutral pattern.\n","Comment: Published version freely available at DOI listed here"]}]
