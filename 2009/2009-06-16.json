I describe a bright-light regime suitable for attacking a quantum key\ndistribution system containing such detectors. In this regime, all single\nphoton detectors in the receiver Bob are uniformly blinded by continuous\nillumination coming from the eavesdropper Eve. When Eve needs a certain\ndetector in Bob to produce a click, she modifies polarization (or other\nparameter used to encode quantum states) of the light she sends to Bob such\nthat the target detector stops receiving light while the other detector(s)\ncontinue to be illuminated. The target detector regains single photon\nsensitivity and, when Eve modifies the polarization again, produces a single\nclick. Thus, Eve has full control of Bob and can do a successful\nintercept-resend attack. To check the feasibility of the attack, 3 different\nmodels of passively-quenched detectors have been tested. In the experiment, I\nhave simulated the intensity diagrams the detectors would receive in a real\nquantum key distribution system under attack. Control parameters and side\neffects are considered.

The E+A spectrum is thus a signpost to galaxies in the process\nof evolution. We quantify the local environments, clustering properties and\nluminosity function of the E+A galaxies.

However, the luminosity distribution of galaxies selected using three\nBalmer absorption lines H-delta-gamma-beta appears more typical of ellipticals.\nIndeed, morphologically these galaxies are preferentially spheroidal (E/S0)\nsystems. In a small but significant number we find evidence for recent major\nmergers, such as tidal tails. We infer that major mergers are one important\nformation mechanism for E+A galaxies, as suggested by previous studies. At low\nredshift the merger probability is high in the field and low in clusters, thus\nthese recently-formed spheroidal systems do not follow the usual\nmorphology-density relation for ellipticals.

Most\nimportantly, this mass dependence is smooth and persists over the entire mass\nrange probed, without any break or feature at any mass scale. We argue that the\nprevious claim of a characteristic feature on galaxy group scales is an\nartefact of the environment estimators used. At fixed halo mass, the luminosity\ndependence of the type fractions is surprisingly weak: galaxy type depends more\nstrongly on halo mass than on luminosity. We also find that the early type\nfraction decreases with increasing halo-centric radius. Contrary to previous\nstudies, we find that this radial dependence is also present in low mass\nhaloes. The properties of satellite galaxies are strongly correlated with those\nof their central galaxy. In particular, the early type fraction of satellites\nis significantly higher in a halo with an early type central galaxy than in a\nhalo of the same mass but with a late type central galaxy. This phenomenon,\nwhich we call `galactic conformity', is present in haloes of all masses and for\nsatellites of all luminosities.

We present 850-micron\ncounts between 0.5 and 8 mJy. The most accurate count is determined at 1 mJy:\n7900 +- 3000 deg^-2, including both Poisson and systematic errors. These are\nthe deepest sub-mm counts published, and are not subject to source confusion\nbecause the detected galaxies are separated and magnified by the lens. Down to\nthe 0.5-mJy limit, the resolved 850-micron background radiation intensity is\n(0.5 +- 0.2) nW m^{-2} sr^{-1}, comparable to the current COBE estimate of the\nbackground, and so the bulk of the 850-micron background radiation originated\nin distant ultraluminous galaxies.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures, uses psfig.sty and emulateapj.sty.

In order to\nperform an accurate comparison with observations, we have computed grids of\natmosphere models and synthetic spectra for different metallicities, covering\nthe range of effective temperatures and gravities relevant for Cepheids. The\nmodels are compared to recent observations of galactic and Magellanic Clouds\nCepheids. Unprecedented level of agreement is found between models and\nobservations. We show that within the range of metallicity for the Galaxy and\nthe Magellanic Clouds, a change of slope in the period - luminosity (PL)\nrelationship is predicted at low periods, due to the reduction of the blue loop\nduring core He burning. The minimum mass undergoing a blue loop and\nconsequently the critical period at which this change of slope occurs depend on\nthe metallicity Z and on the convection treatment in the stellar models.\nHowever, besides this change of slope, we do not find any significant effect of\nmetallicity on period - magnitude relationships from V to K bands, and on\nperiod - color relationships in IR colors.

These new results are also\ncompared to published results from F-K supergiant analyses, and found to be in\ngood agreement when both sets of data are carefully examined as differential\n(SMC minus Galactic standard) abundances.\n  With the exception of nitrogen, very small star-to-star abundance variations\nare found for all elements in this analysis. The N variations are not predicted\nby standard stellar evolution models. Instead, the results support the new\npredictions reported from rotating stellar models, where the range in nitrogen\nis the result of partial mixing of CN-cycled gas from the stellar interior due\nto main-sequence rotation at different rates (c.f., Langer & Heger 1998). The\noverall overabundance of nitrogen in the sampled stars also implies these stars\nhave undergone the first dredge-up in addition to having been mixed while on\nthe main-sequence.\n  The alpha-elements (O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti) have similar underabundances to Fe,\nwhich is not the same as seen in metal-poor stars in the solar neighborhood of\nthe Galaxy.

These include using\ndifferent galaxy luminosity functions to normalize the excess galaxy counts,\ncounting galaxies to different absolute magnitude limits, and counting galaxies\nto different cluster-centric radii. These tests show that with a properly\nnormalized luminosity function, the Bgc parameter is relatively insensitive (at\nbetter than 1/2 of an Abell Richness class) to magnitude limit, areal coverage,\nand photometric errors of up to about 0.25 mag. We compare the Bgc values to\nboth the Abell Richness Class (ARC) and Abell count numbers (N_A). It is found\nthat there is a good correlation between Bgc and N_A for Abell clusters with\nz<~0.1, with a dispersion of about one ARC; whereas the Abell Richness\nclassifications for Abell clusters at z>~0.1 are much less well correlated with\nthe true cluster richness.

The method defines an interface growth process\nwhich depends on height differences between neighbors. The growth rule assigns\na probability $p_{i}(t)=\\rho$ exp$[\\kappa \\Gamma_{i}(t)]$ for a site $i$ to\nreceive one particle at a time $t$ and all the sites are updated\nsimultaneously. Here $\\rho$ and $\\kappa$ are two parameters and $\\Gamma_{i}(t)$\nis a function which depends on height of the site $i$ and its neighbors. Its\nfunctional form is specified through discretization of the deterministic part\nof the growth equation associated to a given deposition process. In particular,\nwe apply this method to study two linear equations - the Edwards-Wilkinson (EW)\nequation and the Mullins-Herring (MH) equation - and a non-linear one - the\nKardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. Through simulations and statistical\nanalysis of the height distributions of the profiles, we recover the values for\nroughening exponents, which confirm that the processes generated by the method\nare indeed in the universality classes of the original growth equations.
