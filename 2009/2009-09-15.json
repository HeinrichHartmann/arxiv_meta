Dembski claims to have established a robust decision process\nthat can determine when observed structures in the natural world can be\nattributed to design. Dembski's decision process first asks whether a structure\nas an outcome can be explained by the regularity of natural laws. If not, and\nthe outcome can be \"specified\", a randomness test is devised to determine\nwhether an observed low probability outcome indicates design. It is argued in\nthis paper that the Dembski test is unworkable and is better formulated in\nterms of a Martin Loef universal randomness test. A universal randomness test\nwill show that most observed outcomes in the natural world are non random; they\nare highly ordered. However this does not necessarily demonstrate design, as\nthe decision is not between chance and design, but between natural laws and\ndesign. The Dembski decision template, which eliminates natural processes in\nthe first decision step, is flawed, forcing a design outcome when none is\nwarranted. Dembski also introduces a 4th law of thermodynamics, the law of\nconservation of information to argue information cannot emerge from random\nprocesses. However if a more robust measure of information based on algorithmic\nentropy is used, the so called 4th law is seen to contain no more than the\nsecond law of thermodynamics.\n  In conclusion, despite the good intentions, the approach fails to offer any\nnew insights into the adequacy of evolutionary theory and should not be\nregarded as demonstrable science.\n","Comment: 1.

We investigate two\nkinds of dynamics for the players to update their strategies (that can be\nunconditional cooperator or defector).

Both economical and environmental\nfactors now require that DBMSs pay close attention to energy consumption. In\nthis paper we approach this issue by considering energy consumption as a\nfirst-class performance goal for query processing in a DBMS. We present two\nconcrete techniques that can be used by a DBMS to directly manage the energy\nconsumption. Both techniques trade energy consumption for performance. The\nfirst technique, called PVC, leverages the ability of modern processors to\nexecute at lower processor voltage and frequency. The second technique, called\nQED, uses query aggregation to leverage common components of queries in a\nworkload. Using experiments run on a commercial DBMS and MySQL, we show that\nPVC can reduce the processor energy consumption by 49% of the original\nconsumption while increasing the response time by only 3%. On MySQL, PVC can\nreduce energy consumption by 20% with a response time penalty of only 6%. For\nsimple selection queries with no predicate overlap, we show that QED can be\nused to gracefully trade response time for energy, reducing energy consumption\nby 54% for a 43% increase in average response time.

The Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization method and the\ngeneral formalism of algebraic renormalization are introduced, and the\nall-order generalization of the PT is thoroughly examined. The extension of the\nPT to the non-perturbative domain of the QCD Schwinger-Dyson equations is\npresented systematically, and the main advantages of the resulting\nself-consistent truncation scheme are discussed. A plethora of physical\napplications relying on the PT are reviewed, such as the definition of\ngauge-independent off-shell form-factors, the construction of non-Abelian\neffective charges, the gauge-invariant treatment of resonant transition\namplitudes and unstable particles, and the dynamical generation of an effective\ngluon mass.\n","Comment: 245 pages, 92 figures"]}]

Experiments have been\nperformed in a channel mounted in the large-scale 'Coriolis' rotating platform,\nand measurements have been carried out in the planes normal and parallel to the\nrotation axis using particle image velocimetry. After a short period of about\n0.4 tank rotation where the energy decays as $t^{-6/5}$, as in classical\nisotropic turbulence, the energy follows a shallower decay law compatible with\n$t^{-3/5}$, as dimensionally expected for energy transfers governed by the\nlinear timescale $\\Omega^{-1}$. The crossover occurs at a Rossby number $Ro\n\\simeq 0.25$, without noticeable dependence with the grid Rossby number. After\nthis transition, anisotropy develops in the form of vertical layers where the\ninitial vertical velocity remains trapped. These layers of nearly constant\nvertical velocity become thinner as they are advected and stretched by the\nlarge-scale horizontal flow, producing significant horizontal gradient of\nvertical velocity which eventually become unstable. After the $Ro \\simeq 0.25$\ntransition, the vertical vorticity field first develops a cyclone-anticyclone\nasymmetry, reproducing the growth law of the vorticity skewness, $S_\\omega(t)\n\\simeq (\\Omega t)^{0.7}$, reported by Morize, Moisy & Rabaud [{\\it Phys.\nFluids} {\\bf 17} (9), 095105 (2005)].

Using the\nobserved set of galactic open clusters and theoretical considerations regarding\ncluster formation, we estimate the fraction of star formation that takes place\nwithin clusters. We find that less than 10% of the stellar population\noriginates from star forming regions destined to become open clusters,\nconfirming earlier estimates. The smallest clusters included in the\nobservational surveys (having at least N=100 members) roughly coincide with the\nsmallest stellar systems that are expected to evolve as clusters in a dynamical\nsense. We show that stellar systems with too few members N < N_\\star have\ndynamical relaxation times that are shorter than their formation times (1-2\nMyr), where the critical number of stars N_\\star \\approx 100. Our results\nsuggest that star formation can be characterized by (at least) three principal\nmodes: I. isolated singles and binaries, II. groups (N<N_\\star), and III.\nclusters (N>N_\\star). Many -- if not most -- stars form through the\nintermediate mode in stellar groups with 10<N<100. Such groups evolve and\ndisperse much more rapidly than open clusters; groups also have a low\nprobability of containing massive stars and are unaffected by supernovae and\nintense ultraviolet radiation fields. Because of their short lifetimes and\nsmall stellar membership, groups have relatively little effect on the star\nformation process (on average) compared to larger open clusters.\n","Comment: accepted to The Astrophysical Journal"]}]
