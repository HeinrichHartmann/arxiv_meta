Any attempt to eavesdrop on the protocol introduces errors\ndetectable by the legitimate parties.\n  This Licentiate Thesis studies the recently introduced EEQKD protocol which\nbuilds on BB84. In EEQKD, the qubits sent individually in BB84 are entangled\nand thus not directly available to an eavesdropper who is, in this protocol,\nprovided only one-by-one access to the transmission. The maximal information an\neavesdropper can gain using a straightforward intercept-resend (IR) attack, is\nobtained for a given error rate. The secure key generation rate of EEQKD is\nestimated in practical scenarios including qubit loss and quantum channel\nnoise.
