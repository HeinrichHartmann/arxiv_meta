We start by deriving a reduced PDE, the GGG model,\nconsisting of only wave-mode interactions. In principle, comparing this model\nto the full rotating Boussinesq system allows us to gauge the importance of\nwave-vortical-wave vs. wave-wave-wave interactions in determining the transfer\nand distribution of wave-mode energy. As in many atmosphere-ocean phenomena we\nwork in a skewed aspect ratio domain (H/L) with Fr = Ro < 1 such that Bu = 1.\nOur focus is on the equilibration of wave-mode energy and its spectral scaling\nunder the influence of random large-scale forcing. As anticipated, when forcing\nis applied to all modes, with Fr=Ro ~ 0.05 and H/L=1/5, the wave-mode energy\nequilibrates and its spectrum scales as a power-law. For the same parameters,\nwhen forcing is restricted to only wave modes, the energy fails to equilibrate\nin both the full system as well as the GGG subsystem at resolutions we can\nachieve. This cleary demonstrates the importance of the vortical mode in\ndetermining the wave-mode energy distribution. Proceeding to the second set of\nsimulations, i.e. for the larger Fr=Ro ~ 0.1 in a less skewed aspect ratio\ndomain with H/L=1/3, we observe that the energy of the GGG subsystem\nequilibrates. Further, the full system with forcing restricted to wave modes\nalso equilbrates and both yield identical energy spectra. Thus it is clear that\nthe wave-wave-wave interactions play a role in the overall dynamics at moderate\nRo, Fr and aspect ratios. Apart from theoretical concerns, these results\nhighlight the difficulty in properly resolving wave-mode interactions when\nsimulating realistic geophysical phenomena.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 9 figs.
