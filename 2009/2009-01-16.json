It is based on a microscopic model for pion production\noff the nucleon that, besides the dominant Delta pole contribution, takes into\naccount the effect of background terms required by chiral symmetry. Moreover,\nthe model uses a reduced nucleon-to-Delta resonance axial coupling, which leads\nto coherent pion production cross sections around a factor two smaller than\nmost of the previous theoretical estimates. In the coherent production, the\nmain nuclear effects, namely medium corrections on the Delta propagator and the\nfinal pion distortion, are included. We have improved on previous similar\nmodels by taking into account the nucleon motion and employing a more\nsophisticated optical potential.

We draw the following conclusions: Low redshift collisionless\nor gaseous mergers of present day Milky Way like disc galaxies do not form\npresent day elliptical galaxies. Binary mergers of the progenitors of present\nday Milky Way like disc galaxies can have evolved into intermediate mass\nelliptical galaxies ($M < M_*$) if they have merged earlier than $\\approx$ 3-4\nGyrs ago. Assuming that most present day disk galaxies formed in a similar way\nto the Milky Way model presented here, more massive giant ellipticals in\ngeneral can not have formed from binary mergers of the progenitors of present\nday disc galaxies.
