The solutions can be used as 5D\nembeddings for a great variety of 4D homogeneous cosmological models, with and\nwithout matter, including the Kasner universe. Since the extra dimension is\nspacelike, the 5D solutions are invariant under the exchange of spatial\ncoordinates. Therefore they also embed a family of spatially {\\it\ninhomogeneous} models in 4D.

For example,\nit would provide new information about gas and magnetic field interactions in\ndynamical spacetimes as well as a combination of redshift and luminosity\ndistance that would enable precise cosmological tests. A proposal first made by\nBode & Phinney (2007) is that because radiation of gravitational waves during\nthe final inspiral and merger of the holes is abrupt and decreases the mass of\nthe central object by a few percent, there will be waves in the disk that can\nsteepen into shocks and thus increase the disk luminosity in a characteristic\nway. We evaluate this process analytically and numerically. We find that shocks\nonly occur when the fractional mass loss exceeds the half-thickness (h/r) of\nthe disk, hence significant energy release only occurs for geometrically thin\ndisks which are thus at low Eddington ratios. This strongly limits the\neffective energy release, and in fact our simulations show that the natural\nvariations in disk luminosity are likely to obscure this effect entirely.\nHowever, we demonstrate that the reduction of luminosity caused by the retreat\nof the inner edge of the disk following mass loss is potentially detectable.\nThis decrease occurs even if the disk is geometrically thick, and lasts for a\nduration on the order of the viscous time of the modified disk.\nObservationally, the best prospect for detection would be a sensitive future\nX-ray instrument with a field of view of on the order of a square degree, or\npossibly a wide-field radio array such as the Square Kilometer Array, if the\ndisk changes produce or interrupt radio emission from a jet.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 5 figures.

Previous studies suggest a power-law\nform, with a \"universal\" value of the exponent, although some recent\nobservations indicate that significant sight line-to-sight line variability may\nexist. We show that a power-law model provides an excellent fit to most NIR\nextinction curves, but that the value of the power, beta, varies significantly\nfrom sight line-to-sight line. Therefore, it seems that a \"universal NIR\nextinction law\" is not possible. Instead, we find that as beta decreases, R(V)\n[=A(V)/E(B-V)] tends to increase, suggesting that NIR extinction curves which\nhave been considered \"peculiar\" may, in fact, be typical for different R(V)\nvalues. We show that the power law parameters can depend on the wavelength\ninterval used to derive them, with the beta increasing as longer wavelengths\nare included. This result implies that extrapolating power law fits to\ndetermine R(V) is unreliable. To avoid this problem, we adopt a different\nfunctional form for NIR extinction. This new form mimics a power law whose\nexponent increases with wavelength, has only 2 free parameters, can fit all of\nour curves over a longer wavelength baseline and to higher precision, and\nproduces R(V) values which are consistent with independent estimates and\ncommonly used methods for estimating R(V). Furthermore, unlike the power law\nmodel, it gives R(V)'s that are independent of the wavelength interval used to\nderive them. It also suggests that the relation R(V) = -1.36 E(K-V)/E(B-V) -\n0.79 can estimate R(V) to +/-0.12. Finally, we use model extinction curves to\nshow that our extinction curves are in accord with theoretical expectations.\n","Comment: To appear in the Astrophysical Journal"]}]

We extend these considerations to the case where the\ninterstellar gas pressure in the inner galaxy is dominated by outflows from a\ncentral AGN. During massive spheroid formation, AGN-driven winds trigger star\nformation, resulting in enhanced supernova feedback and outflows. The outflows\nare comparable to the AGN-boosted star formation rate and saturate in the\nsuper-Eddington limit.

The second\nresult shows that the amplitude of the glitches is modulated by a periodic\nlarge-scale sawtooth-like function. As a result of this modulation, the glitch\namplitude varies discretely from glitch to glitch with a step of 1.5x10^{-9} Hz\nin the range (2.4-6.9)x10^{-9} Hz. The post-glitch time interval also varies\ndiscretely with a step of about 600 days in the range 900-2700 days.

The\nparent body of this family, Haumea, is one of the largest objects in the Kuiper\nbelt and is orbited by two satellites. It has been proposed that the Haumea\nfamily was created from dispersed fragments that resulted from a giant impact.\nThis proposed origin of the Haumea family is however in conflict with the\nobserved velocity dispersion between the family members (\\sim 140 m/s) which is\nsignificantly less than the escape velocity from Haumea's surface (\\sim 900\nm/s). In this paper we propose a different formation scenario for Haumea's\ncollisional family. In our scenario the family members are ejected while in\norbit around Haumea. This scenario, therefore, gives naturally rise to a lower\nvelocity dispersion among the family members than expected from direct ejection\nfrom Haumea's surface. In our scenario Haumea's giant impact forms a single\nmoon that tidally evolves outward until it suffers a destructive collision from\nwhich the family is created. We show that this formation scenario yields a\nvelocity dispersion of \\sim 190m/s among the family members which is in good\nagreement with the observations. The probability for Haumea's initial giant\nimpact in todays Kuiper belt is less than 10^{-3}. In our scenario, however,\nHaumea's giant impact can occur before the excitation of the Kuiper belt and\nthe ejection of the family members afterwards. This has the advantage that one\ncan preserve the dynamical coherence of the family and explain Haumea's\noriginal giant impact, which is several orders of magnitude more likely to have\noccurred in the primordial dynamically cold Kuiper belt compared to the\ndynamically excited Kuiper belt today.

In this paper we show\nthat the senses and amplitudes of these departures can be naturally accounted\nfor by a simple distribution function constructed on the basis of statistical\nmechanics of violent relaxation. As a consequence, detailed light-profiles can\nbe used to infer about the central potentials of E galaxies (the only free\nshape parameter of our model). Furthermore, the small deviations have recently\nbeen shown to correlate with luminosity, L. This observation entails a slight\nbreaking of the generally assumed structural homology between E galaxies. Using\nour model we parametrize this broken homology by establishing a correlation\nbetween a suitably normalized central potential and luminosity. The\nnon-homology means that a basic assumption in the interpretation of the\nFundamental Plane (FP) breaks down, and with it the conclusions derived from\nit. Instead, by assuming that M/L is independent of luminosity, we derive a\nrelation akin to the FP directly from our correlation. This implies that the FP\nmay have a simple stellar dynamical origin. We can reproduce the observed\nCarlberg-Kormendy relation for the central phase-space densities (f_c) of E\ngalaxies of identical structure, f_c = L^-2.35, but non-homology changes it to\na much weaker dependence (f_c = L^-1.5 for constant M/L) which would imply that\nthe central phase-space densities of ellipticals are comparable to those of\nspiral galaxies.

The importance\nof lower Dirac bispinor component, yielding 18% to the wave function\nnormalization is stressed.
