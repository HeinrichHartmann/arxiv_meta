The data used is from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). I show that\nwith three bands only ({\\it gri}) it is possible to achieve results as accurate\nas the ones obtained by other techniques, generally based on more filters. In\nparticular, the use of the $(g-i)$ color helps improving the final redshifts\n(especially for clusters), as this color monotonically increases up to $z \\sim\n0.8$. For the LRGs I generate a catalog of $\\sim 1.5$ million objects at $z <\n0.70$. The accuracy of this catalog is $\\sigma = 0.027$ for $z \\le 0.55$ and\n$\\sigma = 0.049$ for $0.55 < z \\le 0.70$. The photometric redshift technique\nemployed for clusters is independent of a cluster selection algorithm. Thus, it\ncan be applied to systems selected by any method or wavelength, as long as the\nproper optical photometry is available. When comparing the redshift listed in\nliterature to the photometric estimate, the accuracy achieved for clusters is\n$\\sigma = 0.024$ for $z \\le 0.30$ and $\\sigma = 0.037$ for $030 < z \\le 0.55$.\nHowever, when considering the spectroscopic redshift as the mean value of SDSS\ngalaxies on each cluster region, the accuracy is at the same level as found by\nother authors: $\\sigma = 0.011$ for $z \\le 0.30$ and $\\sigma = 0.016$ for $030\n< z \\le 0.55$.

However, there is no rigorous proof thereof\nat present, because the afore mentioned operators are not gauge invariant, they\ndo not commute with the quantum constraints. The relational formalism in the\nincarnation of Rovelli's partial and complete observables provides a possible\nmechanism for turning a non gauge invariant operator into a gauge invariant\none.

We find, even in those simpler cases, that kinematical discreteness of\nthe spectrum does not necessarily survive at the gauge invariant level. Whether\nor not this happens depends crucially on how the gauge invariant completion is\nperformed. This indicates that ``fundamental discreteness at Planck scale in\nLQG'' is far from established.

I\ntrace the possible history of this supposition and test it in a simulation\nstudy of both continuous and binary health outcomes under a classical\nmultiplicative measurement error model. A Bayesian measurement adjustment\nmethod is used. The main conclusion is that adjustment for the presumed\nmeasurement error does not 'induce' positive associations, especially if the\nfocus of the interpretation of the result is taken away from the point\nestimate. This is in line with properties of earlier measurement error\nadjustment methods introduced to epidemiologists in the 1990s. An heuristic\nargument is provided to support the generalizability of this observation in the\nBayesian framework. I find that when there is no true association, positive\nbias can only be induced by indefensible manipulation of the priors, such that\nthey dominate the data. The misconception about bias induced by measurement\nerror adjustment should be more clearly explained during the training of\nepidemiologists to ensure the appropriate (and wider) use of measurement error\ncorrection procedures. The simple message that can be derived from this paper\nis: 'Do not focus on point estimates, but mind the gap between boundaries that\nreflect variability in the estimate'. And of course: 'Treat measurement error\nas a tractable problem that deserves much more attention than just a\nqualitative (throw-away) discussion'.\n","Comment: Area of application: epidemiology; 9 pages; 3 tables"]}]

The lemma also enables a broad\ntopological classification of fading MARCs into one of three types. The first\ntype is the set of partially clustered MARCs where a user is clustered either\nwith the relay or with the destination such that the users waterfill on their\nbottle-neck links to the distant receiver.
