(PNAS 101, 1822 (2004)).\nThe model and its solution are extended in several respects: a) an analytical\nsolution is given for the cascade equilibria, exploiting a parameter-based\nsymmetry of the rate equations; b) we discuss the cooperativity (Hill\ncoefficients) of the cascade and show that a feedforward loop within the\ncascade increases its cooperativity. The relevance of this result for the\nnotion of modularity is discussed; c) the feedback model for cascade\nbistability by Angeli et al. is reconsidered. We argue that care must be taken\nin modeling the interactions and a biologically realistic phenomenological\nmodel cannot be too reductionist. The inclusion of a time-dependent degradation\nrate is needed to account for a switching of the cascade.\n"]}]
