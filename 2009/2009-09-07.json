The\ntheory is constructed as follows: Faddeev-Popov-De Witt gauged path integral ->\nfactorization of classical and quantum variables -> transition to the 1-loop\napproximation -> choice of ghost sector, satisfying 1-loop finiteness of the\ntheory off the mass shell. The Bogolyubov-Born-Green-Kirckwood-Yvon (BBGKY)\nchain for the spectral function of gravitons renormalized by ghosts is used to\nbuild a theory of gravitons in the isotropic Universe. We found three exact\nsolutions of the equations that describe virtual graviton and ghost condensates\nas well as condensates of instanton fluctuations. Exact solutions correspond to\nvarious condensates with different graviton-ghost compositions. The formalism\nof the BBGKY chain takes into account the contribution of non-relativistic\nmatter in the formation of a common self-consistent gravitational field.

The results show that the transverse force (perpendicular to the\nstem) can reach the order of the axial force; thus it should not be ignored. We\nalso observed that it depends very weakly on the cavitation levels. Videos made\nwith a high-speed camera allow an interesting understanding of the fluid flow\nand the cavitation creation.

The desynchronization could be caused by a coupling between\nthe background gravitation and the quantum vacuum. Therefore, the standard\nargument for the incompatibility of the Pioneer acceleration and the values of\nthe planets' orbits radii cannot be applied. Second, this proposal gives\nexactly the same results for radar ranging observations as standard physics.\nHence, it cannot be in conflict with the very precise cartography of the solar\nsystem determined by NASA's Viking mission. Otherwise stated, while this\nproposal predicts apparent changes in the velocities of the spaceships and in\nthe frequencies of Doppler observations, as really observed, it does not affect\nthe values of the distances in any way whatsoever.

We introduce an algorithmic\nframework for simulating charged particles which modifies the dynamics so as to\nallow equilibration using a local Hamiltonian. The method introduces an\nauxiliary field with constrained dynamics so that the equilibrium distribution\nis determined by the Coulomb interaction. We demonstrate the efficiency of the\nmethod by simulating a simple, charged lattice gas.\n","Comment: Last figure changed to improve demonstration of numerical efficiency"]}]
