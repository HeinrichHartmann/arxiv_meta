Using a recently developed experimental method\nof in vivo cytotoxicity we investigated quantitative aspects of killing of\npeptide-pulsed targets by effector and memory CD8$^+$T cells, specific to three\nepitopes of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), in the mouse spleen. By\nanalyzing data on killing of targets with varying number of epitope-specific\neffector and memory CD8$^+$T cells, we find that killing of targets by\neffectors follows the law of mass-action, that is the death rate of\npeptide-pulsed targets is proportional to the frequency of CTLs in the spleen.\nIn contrast, killing of targets by memory CD8$^+$T cells does not follow the\nmass action law because the death rate of targets saturates at high frequencies\nof memory CD8$^+$T cells.

Why some viruses establish\nchronic infections while other do not is poorly understood. One possibility is\nthat the host's immune response is impaired during chronic infections and is\nunable to clear the virus from the host. In this report we use a recently\nproposed framework to estimate the per capita killing efficacy of CD8$^+$ T\ncells, specific for the MT389 epitope of polyoma virus (PyV), which establishes\na chronic infection in mice. Surprisingly, the estimated per cell killing\nefficacy of MT389-specific effector CD8$^+$ T cells during the acute phase of\nthe infection was very similar to the previously estimated efficacy of effector\nCD8$^+$ T cells specific to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus\n(LCMV-Armstrong), which is cleared from the host. We also find that during the\nchronic phase of the infection the killing efficacy of PyV-specific CD8$^+$ T\ncells was only half of that of cells in the acute phase. This decrease in the\nkilling efficacy is again surprisingly similar to the change in the killing\nefficacy of LCMV-specific CD8$^+$ T cells from the peak of the response to the\nmemory phase. Interestingly, we also find that PyV-specific CD8$^+$ T cells in\nthe chronic phase of the infection require lower doses of antigen to kill a\ntarget cell. In summary, we find little support for the hypothesis that\npersistence of infections is caused by inability of the host to mount an\nefficient immune response, and that even in the presence of an efficient\nCD8$^+$ T cell response, some viruses can still establish a persistent\ninfection.\n"]}]
