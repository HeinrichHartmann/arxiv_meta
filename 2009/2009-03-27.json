Arbitrary combinations\nof Dirichlet and Neumann conditions on the four sides can be treated. The total\nenergy is also investigated, path by path. These results are used in an attempt\nto clarify the physical reality of the repulsive (outward) force on the sides\nof the box predicted by calculations that neglect both boundary divergences and\nthe exterior of the box. Previous authors have studied \"piston\" geometries that\navoid these problems and have found the force to be attractive. We consider a\n\"pistol\" geometry that comes closer to the original problem of a box with a\nmovable lid. We find again an attractive force, although its origin and\ndetailed behavior are somewhat different from the piston case. However, the\npistol (and the piston) model can be criticized for extending idealized\nboundary conditions into short distances where they are physically implausible.\nTherefore, it is of interest to see whether leaving the ultraviolet cutoff\nfinite yields results that are more plausible. We then find that the force\ndepends strongly on a geometrical parameter; it can be made repulsive, but only\nby forcing that parameter into the regime where the model is least convincing\nphysically.\n","Comment: 45 pages, 12 figures.

In end-to-end error\ncorrection, it is known that we can correct up to the min-cut between the\nsource and destinations.

We consider\nthe cosmic inflation driven by a multiple number of the inflaton fields, which\ndecay into both radiation and pressureless matter components. We present a\ncomplete set of the exact background and perturbation equations which describe\nthe evolution of the universe throughout its history. By applying these\nequations to the simple but reasonable model of multi-field chaotic inflation,\nwe explicitly show that the total curvature perturbation is continuously\nvarying because of the non-adiabatic components of the curvature perturbation\ngenerated by the multiple inflaton fields throughout the whole evolution of the\nuniverse. We also provide an useful analytic estimation of the total as well as\nmatter and radiation curvature perturbations, assuming that matter is\ncompletely decoupled from radiation from the beginning. The resulting\nisocurvature perturbation between matter and radiation is at most sub-percent\nlevel when the masses of the inflaton fields are distributed between\n$10^{-6}m_{pl}$ and $10^{-5}m_{pl}$. We find that this result is robust unless\nwe use non-trivial decay rates, and that thus, in general, it is hard to obtain\nlarge matter-radiation isocurvature perturbation. Also, by using the\n$\\delta{N}$ formalism, we point out that the inflationary calculation,\nespecially when involving multiple inflaton fields, is likely to lose the\npotentially important post-inflationary evolution which can modify the\nresulting curvature perturbation.\n","Comment: 31 pages, 6 figures, Final version to appear in JCAP.

A difference between the ensemble CCE and single-sample CCE\nis that the mean-field treatment in the latter formalism of the diagonal part\nof the spin-spin interaction in the bath is not possible in the former case.\nThe ensemble CCE can be applied to non-factorizable initial states.
