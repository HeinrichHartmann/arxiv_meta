A distinctive feature of\nthis study is that the spin-rich $qqq$ force is generated by a $ggg$ vertex (a\ngenuine part of the QCD Lagrangian) wherein the 3 radiating gluon lines end on\nas many quark lines, giving rise to a (Mercedes-Benz type) $Y$-shaped diagram.\nThe dynamics is that of a Salpeter-like equation (3D support for the kernel)\nformulated covariantly on the light front, a la Markov-Yukawa Transversality\nPrinciple (MYTP) which warrants a 2-way interconnection between the 3D and 4D\nBethe-Salpeter (BSE) forms for 2 as well as 3 fermion quarks. With these\ningredients, the differential equation for the 3D wave function $\\phi$ receives\nwell-defined contributions from the $qq$ and $qqq$ forces. In particular a\n$negative$ eigenvalue of the spin operator $i \\sigma_1.\\sigma_2\\times \\sigma_3$\nwhich is an integral part of the $qqq$ force, causes a characteristic\nsingularity in the differential equation, signalling the dynamical effect of a\nspin-rich $qqq$ force not yet considered in the literature.

Smaller galaxies (Vrot ~100 km/s) have much\nsmaller stellar envelopes, but depending on geometry, they could still be more\nluminous than expected from satellite remnants in hierarchical galaxy formation\nmodels. Alternatively, they could be created by disk heating through the\nbombardment of small dark matter sub-halos. The halos we fit are highly\nflattened, with minor- over-ma jor axis ratios c/a=0.6. The halos are somewhat\nmore compact than hierarchical model predictions. The halos show small\nmetallicity gradient out to 30 kpc and the massive galaxies have typical\n[Fe/H]~-0.8. We find indications of halo substructure in many galaxies, but\nsome halos seem remarkable smooth.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 9 figures.

The constrained method with time dependent coupling appears\nto have benefits in synchronizing long datasets with minimal impact, while the\ninitial value method with time independent coupling tends to be substantially\nfaster, more flexible and easier to use.

In the\nframework of our recently-proposed flavour permutation symmetry, we consider\nthe similarities between the quark and lepton mixing matrices, V and U, arguing\nthat the relative smallness of one element in each suggests common constraints.\nThese constraints link the smallness of V_ub and U_e3 with each other, and with\nthe approximate mu-tau symmetry observed in leptonic mixing, together with a\nprediction of a large Dirac CP phase in both the quark and lepton sectors. In\nthe quark case, we predict alpha=(89.0\\pm 0.2) degrees, in agreement with data\nand suggesting that the unitarity triangle is in fact very nearly, but not\nexactly right.\n","Comment: Talk given at the International Conference on Particles And Nuclei\n  (PANIC08), Eilat, Israel, 13th November 2008. 4 pages"]}]
