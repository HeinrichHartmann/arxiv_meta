First, we make\nexplicit (in the form of a Boolean matrix) some negative implicit information\nin rules. This matrix (called nihilation matrix) contains the elements that, if\npresent, forbid the application of the rule (i.e. potential dangling edges, or\nnewly added edges, which cannot be already present in the simple digraph).\nSecond, we introduce a novel notion of application condition, which combines\ngraph diagrams together with monadic second order logic.

We demonstrate that these application conditions\ncan be embedded into rules (i.e. in the left hand side and the nihilation\nmatrix), and show that the applicability of a rule with arbitrary application\nconditions is equivalent to the applicability of a sequence of plain rules\nwithout application conditions. Therefore, the analysis of the former is\nequivalent to the analysis of the latter, showing that in our framework no\nadditional results are needed for the study of application conditions.\nMoreover, all analysis techniques of [21, 22] for the study of sequences can be\napplied to application conditions.\n","Comment: 38 pages, 23 figures.

As it is unpractical to follow every particle to its end,\nparticles below a certain energy ($E_{Cut}$) are discarded from the simulation.\nIn this article we study in detail the influence that this cut has on the total\nenergy deposited in the atmosphere by the particle cascade in AIRES\nsimulations. The energy deposit is directly related to the emission of\nfluorescence light and is critical for the accurate simulation of shower\nsignals in fluorescence detectors. Not correcting for the discarded particles\nintroduces a bias on several shower observables related to the energy deposit\nthat can range from 3 to 30% or more depending on the $E_{Cut}$ value used. A\nprescription for the correct treatment of these particles is proposed, and the\nresulting corrections to the total energy deposit are addressed, including a\nnew universal parametrization of the mean energy deposit per particle. The low\nenergy cut is introduced in the simulations to reduce the required CPU time per\nshower at the expense of simulation accuracy. We find that a 0.4 MeV cut for\nelectrons and 0.9 MeV cut for gammas is an adequate compromise, and that the\nproposed prescription is capablable of removing the bias introduced by this\ncut.

Since every shower has a fraction of\ninvisible energy, the energy determined using the fluorescence technique is\nalways less than the primary energy and a correction needs to be applied. This\ncorrection, usually referred to as the \"missing energy\", can only be estimated\nusing Monte Carlo simulations.\n  In this article we study in detail the influence that discarding low energy\nparticles from the simulation has on the estimation of the missing and\ninvisible energies. We found that although the effect is not important for the\ninvisible energy,an important bias on the missing energy is introduced that can\nreach 30% or more depending on the low energy cut value.\n  We present a prescription on how to correct for this bias in AIRES\nsimulations and give a novel missing energy parametrization including results\nfor photons and for the QGSJET-II hadronic model.

More\nspecifically, it is shown that, in a large n-dimensional hyperbolic ball B of\nradius R viewed as a roughly similar model of a Gromov hyperbolic network, the\nproportion of traffic paths transiting through a small ball near the center is\nindependent of the radius R whereas, in a Euclidean ball, the same proportion\nscales as 1/R^{n-1}. This discrepancy persists for the traffic load, which at\nthe center of the hyperbolic ball scales as the square of the volume, whereas\nthe same traffic load scales as the volume to the power (n+1)/n in the\nEuclidean ball. This provides a theoretical justification of the experimental\nexponent discrepancy observed by Narayan and Saniee between traffic loads in\nGromov-hyperbolic networks from the Rocketfuel data base and synthetic\nEuclidean lattice networks.

We find that during the first epoch GRS\n1758-258 displayed another of its peculiar dim soft states like the one\nobserved in 2001, increasing the number of observed occurrences of this state\nto three. During the other epochs the source was in the hard state. The hard\nX-ray emission component in the epoch-summed spectra can be well described\neither by phenomenological models, namely a cutoff power law in the hard state\nand a pure power law in the dim soft state, or by thermal Comptonization\nmodels. A soft thermal component is clearly present in the dim soft state and\nmight also contribute to the softer hard state spectra. We argue that in the\nrecently emerging picture of the hardness-intensity evolution of black hole\ntransient outbursts in which hard and soft states are observed to occur in a\nlarge overlapping range of luminosities (hysteresis), the dim soft state is not\npeculiar. As noted before for the 2001 dim soft state, these episodes seem to\nbe triggered by a sudden decrease (within days) of the hard emission, with the\nsoft spectral component decaying on a longer time scale (weeks). We discuss\nthis behavior in terms of the existence of two independent accretion flows, the\nmodel previously suggested for the 2001 episode.

The London approximation and method of images is used\nto estimate the shape of the potential well in superconducting HTSC quantum\ndot. To calculate the escape rate we use the instanton technique.
