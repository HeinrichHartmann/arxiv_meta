We have seen that the fractional calculation is able to\nenhance the quality of images, with interesting possibilities in edge detection\nand image restoration. Here, we want to discuss more deeply its role as a tool\nfor the processing of astronomical images. In particular, the fractional\ndifferentiation can help produce a 'content-matter' based image from a pretty\nastronomical image that can be used for more research and scientific purposes,\nfor instance to reveal faint objects galactic matter, nebulosity, more stars\nand planetary surface detail.\n"]}]

We examine this situation by drawing analogies to Bosons in a\ntwo-dimensional box, where the thermodynamic limit is well-defined. We show\nthat in both systems although the ground state populations show sharp onsets at\nthe critical temperature, the behaviour of the specific heat is analytic, which\nproves the absence of a phase transition in these systems.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures.

Our analysis in terms of classical trajectories shows that the\nsemiclassical approaches developed for ballistic transport can be adapted to\ndeal with the case where tunneling is present. Peaks in the Fourier transform\nof the energy-dependent transmission and reflection spectra exhibit a\nnonmonotonic behaviour as a function of the barrier height in the quantum\nmechanical numerical calculations. Semiclassical analysis provides a simple\nqualitative explanation of this behaviour, as well as a quantitative agreement\nwith the exact calculations.
