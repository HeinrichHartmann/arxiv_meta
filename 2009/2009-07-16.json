First\nthe mind-brain system is a quantum coherent, but reversibly decohering and\nrecohering system. This allows me to answer 1) above, mind does not act\ncausally on brain at all, rather it acausally decohers to classicity (for all\npractical purposes), hence has consequences for brain and body as matter.\nEpiphenomenalism is averted. A quantum mind, because it is acausal on\nCopenhagen including Born, yields a free will, but a merely random free will,\nnot a responsible free will. Second, the most radical part of this article\nproposes that the quantum classical interface is not always describable by a\nlaw: specifically in a special relativity setting, no function, F, maps the\npresent state of the system mind-brain into its future. In its place is a\nnonrandom yet lawless process. I seek in this non-random yet lawless process a\nsource for a responsible free will. Finally, if the quantum-classical boundary\ncan be non-random yet lawless, then no algorithmic simulation of the world or\nourselves can calculate the real world, hence the evolutionary selective\nadvantages for evolving consciousness to know it may be great.

The state vector of a baryon is defined on the\nlight front of general position \\omega . x=0, where \\omega is an arbitrary\nlight-like four vector. It is then decomposed in Fock components including an\nincreasing number of pions. The maximal number of particles in the state vector\nis mapped out to the order of decomposition of the chiral effective Lagrangian\nto have a consistent calculation of both the state vector and the effective\nLagrangian. An adequate Fock sector dependent renormalization scheme is used in\norder to restrict all contributions within the truncated Fock space. To\nillustrate our formalism, we calculate the anomalous magnetic moment of a\nfermion in the Yukawa model in the three-body truncation.
