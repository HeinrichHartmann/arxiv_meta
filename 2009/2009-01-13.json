The reliability of this transmission may suffer\nfrom bursty packet losses - the predominant type of failures in today's\nInternet. An effective and well studied solution to this problem is to protect\nthe data by a Forward Error Correction (FEC) code and send the FEC packets over\nmultiple paths.\n  In this paper we show that the performance of such a multipath FEC scheme can\noften be further improved. Our key observation is that the propagation times on\nthe available paths often significantly differ, typically by 10-100ms.\n  We propose to exploit these differences by appropriate packet scheduling that\nwe call `Spread'. We evaluate our solution with a precise, analytical\nformulation and trace-driven simulations. Our studies show that Spread\nsubstantially outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions. It typically achieves\ntwo- to five-fold improvement (reduction) in the effective loss rate. Or\nconversely, keeping the same level of effective loss rate, Spread significantly\ndecreases the observed delays and helps fighting the delay jitter.\n","Comment: 12 pages"]}]

Starting with defining entities and their evolutionary\nrelationships observed during the simulations of the model, the framework\nprescribes a series of definitions, followed by the axioms (conditions) that\nmust be met in order to establish the level of evolutionary behavior in the\nmodel.

We\nalso present new higher order corrections to the local solution for the mode\nconversion problem which allow better asymptotic matching to the WKB solutions.\nThe phase space tools used in Part I rely on the Weyl symbol calculus, which\ngives a way to relate operators to functions on phase space. In Part II of this\ndissertation, we explore the mathematical foundations of the theory of symbols.\nWe go on to present the group theoretical formulation of symbols, as developed\nrecently by Zobin. This defines the symbol of an operator in terms of a double\nFourier transform on a non-commutative group. We then show how the path\nintegral arises when calculating the symbol of a function of an operator.
