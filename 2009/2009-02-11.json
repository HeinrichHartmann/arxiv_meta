In more detail, our results\nare as follows: For any graph $G=(V,E)$ of size $n$ and minimum degree\n$\\delta$, we have $\\mathcal{R}(G)= \\Oh(\\frac{|E|}{\\delta} \\cdot \\log n)$, where\n$\\mathcal{R}(G)$ denotes the quotient of the cover time and broadcast time.\nThis bound is tight for binary trees and tight up to logarithmic factors for\nmany graphs including hypercubes, expanders and lollipop graphs.
