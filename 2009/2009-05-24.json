With this conditioning it\nis also true that $\\{s\\to b\\}$ and $\\{a\\to t\\}$ are negatively correlated.\n  A concept of increasing events in random orientations is defined and a\ngeneral inequality corresponding to Harris inequality is given.\n  The results are obtained by combining a very useful lemma by Colin McDiarmid\nwhich relates random orientations with edge percolation, with results by van\nden Berg, H\\\"aggstr\\\"om, Kahn on correlation inequalities for edge percolation.\n  The results are true also for another model of randomly directed graphs.\n","Comment: 7 pages.

The\nelectron-vibration coupling gives rise to small drops in the conductance at\nvoltages corresponding to energies of some of the vibrational modes.

In contrast to previous\ncalculations, we find that typically there are several close-lying drops due to\ndifferent longitudinal modes. In the experiments, only a single drop is usually\nvisible, but its width is too large to be accounted for by temperature.\nTherefore, to explain the experimental results, we find it necessary to\nintroduce a finite broadening to the vibrational modes, which makes the\nseparate drops merge into a single, wide one.
