Using a\nlarge sample of 37 short and 421 long GRBs, we find a strong correlation\nbetween the afterglow brightness measured after 11 hours and the observed\nfluence of the prompt emission. Both the optical (R band) and X-ray flux\ndensities (F_R and F_X) scale with the gamma-ray fluence, F_gamma. For bursts\nwith a known redshift, a tight correlation exists between the afterglow flux\ndensities at 11 hours (rest-frame) and the total isotropic gamma-ray energy,\nEgi: F_{R,X} ~ Egi^{alpha}, with alpha ~ 1. The constant of proportionality is\nnearly identical for long and short bursts, when Egi is obtained from the Swift\ndata. Additionally, we find that for short busts with F_gamma >10^{-7} erg\ncm^{-2}, optical afterglows are nearly always detected by reasonably deep early\nobservations. Finally, we show that the ratio F_R/F_X has very similar values\nfor short and long bursts. These results are difficult to explain in the\nframework of the standard scenario, since they require that either (1) the\nnumber density of the surrounding medium of short bursts is typically\ncomparable to, or even larger than the number density of long bursts; (2) short\nbursts explode into a density profile, n(r)\\alpha r^{-2} or (3) the prompt\ngamma-ray fluence depends on the density of the external medium. We therefore\nfind it likely that either basic assumptions on the properties of the\ncircumburst environment of short GRBs or else the standard models of GRB\nemission must be re-examined. We believe that the most likely solution is that\nthe ambient density surrounding typical short bursts is higher than has\ngenerally been expected: a typical value of ~1 per cm^{-3} is indicated.\n","Comment: main: 42 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables; online table: 63 pages; accepted\n  to ApJ, abstract is truncated"]}]

This is the first attempt to test a model of fast\nmagnetic reconnection in the presence of weak turbulence proposed by Lazarian &\nVishniac (1999). This model predicts that weak turbulence, generically present\nin most of astrophysical systems, enhances the rate of reconnection by reducing\nthe transverse scale for reconnection events and by allowing many independent\nflux reconnection events to occur simultaneously. As a result the reconnection\nspeed becomes independent of Ohmic resistivity and is determined by the\nmagnetic field wandering induced by turbulence. To quantify the reconnection\nspeed we use both an intuitive definition, i.e. the speed of the reconnected\nflux inflow, as well as a more sophisticated definition based on a formally\nderived analytical expression.

In our\nmodels, we see no dependence on the guide field when its strength is comparable\nto the reconnected component.

Using\nthe generalization of the Ripley, Besag, and the pair correlation functions for\nnon-stationary point patterns, I estimate these transition scales for a set of\n1,000 Monte Carlo realizations of the Cl 0024+17 field, corrected for\ncompleteness up to the outskirts. The results point out the presence of at\nleast two physical scales in this field at 31.4 and 112.9 arcseconds. The\nsecond one is statistically consistent with the dark matter ring radius (about\n75 arcseconds) previously identified by Jee et al. (2007). However, morphology\nand anisotropy tests point out that a clump at about 120 arcseconds NW from the\ncluster center could be the responsible for the second transition scale. These\nresults do not indicate the existence of a galaxy counterpart of the dark\nmatter ring, but the methodology developed to study the galaxy field as a\nspatial point pattern provides a good statistical evaluation of the physical\nscales around the cluster. I briefly discuss the usefulness of this approach to\nprobe features in galaxy distribution and N-body dark matter simulation data.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in New Astronomy. 14 pages. 8 figures"]}]

We have found that the magnetic field\ncan be locally amplified in this case, forming long-lived structures whose\nmaximum amplitude can be up to ~2.5 times larger at the tachocline and up to ~2\ntimes larger at the center of the convection zone than in models without\nquenching. However, this amplification leads to unobservable effects and to a\nworse distribution of the magnetic field in the butterfly diagram. Since the\ndynamo cycle period increases when the efficiency of the quenching increases,\nwe have also explored whether the eta-quenching can cause a diffusion-dominated\nmodel to drift into an advection-dominated regime. We have found that models\nundergoing a large suppression of the diffusivity produce a strong segregation\nof magnetic fields that may lead to unsteady dynamo-oscillations. On the other\nhand, an initially diffusion-dominated model undergoing a small suppression in\neta remains in the diffusion-dominated regime.\n","Comment: 36 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

Since the population is finite, the epidemic will eventually\ngo extinct, i.e., have no more infectives in the population. We study the\neffects of population size and within household transmission upon the time to\nextinction. This is done through two approximations. The first approximation is\nsuitable for all levels of within household transmission and is based upon an\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process approximation for the diseases fluctuations about an\nendemic level relying on a large population. The second approximation is\nsuitable for high levels of within household transmission and approximates the\nnumber of infectious households by a simple homogeneously mixing SIS model with\nthe households replaced by individuals. The analysis, supported by a simulation\nstudy, shows that the mean time to extinction is minimized by moderate levels\nof within household transmission.\n"]}]

We find that the S^1 x S^1\nbosonic reduction of (1,0) 6d supergravity to 4d gravity coupled to 2 scalars\nand a gauge field is consistent only provided that the gauge field obeys a\nconstraint (F \\wedge F=0). This is to be contrasted to the case of the S^3 x\nS^3 bosonic reduction of type IIB supergravity to 4d gravity, 2 scalars and a\ngauge field, where consistency is achieved without imposing any such\nconstraints. Therefore, in the case of (1,0) 6d supergravity we are able to\nconstruct 1/2 BPS solutions, similar to those derived in type IIB, provided\nthat this additional constraint is satisfied. This ultimately prohibits the\nconstruction of a family of 1/2 BPS solutions corresponding to a bubbling AdS_3\nx S^3 geometry. Returning to type IIB solutions, by turning on an axion-dilaton\nfield we construct a family of bubbling 1/4 BPS solutions.
