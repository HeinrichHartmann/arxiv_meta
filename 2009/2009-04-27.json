This notion of graphene as a giant flat molecule that\ncan be altered chemically is supported by the observation of so-called graphene\noxide, that is graphene densely covered with hydroxyl and other groups.\nUnfortunately, graphene oxide is strongly disordered, poorly conductive and\ndifficult to reduce to the original state. Nevertheless, one can imagine atoms\nor molecules being attached to the atomic scaffold in a strictly periodic\nmanner, which should result in a different electronic structure and,\nessentially, a different crystalline material. A hypothetical example for this\nis graphane, a wide-gap semiconductor, in which hydrogen is bonded to each\ncarbon site of graphene. Here we show that by exposing graphene to atomic\nhydrogen, it is possible to transform this highly-conductive semimetal into an\ninsulator. Transmission electron microscopy reveals that the material retains\nthe hexagonal lattice but its period becomes markedly shorter than that of\ngraphene, providing direct evidence for a new graphene-based derivative. The\nreaction with hydrogen is found to be reversible so that the original metallic\nstate and lattice spacing are restored by annealing and even the quantum Hall\neffect recovers. Our work proves the concept of chemical modification of\ngraphene, which promises a whole range of new two-dimensional crystals with\ndesigned electronic and other properties.\n"]}]

Using a\nsimple model of the orbit-averaged effects of tidal friction, we study the\nevolution of close-in planets on inclined orbits, due to tides. We analyse the\neffects of the inclusion of stellar magnetic braking by performing a\nphase-plane analysis of a simplified system of equations, including the braking\ntorque. The inclusion of magnetic braking is found to be important, and its\nneglect can result in a very different system history.

The main result of our integrations is that for\ntypical Hot Jupiters, tidal friction aligns the stellar spin with the orbit on\na similar time as it causes the orbit to decay. This means that if a planet is\nobserved to be aligned, then it probably formed coplanar. This reinforces the\nimportance of Rossiter-McLaughlin effect observations in determining the degree\nof spin-orbit alignment in transiting systems. We apply these results to the\nXO-3 system, and constrain the tidal quality factors Q' in both the star and\nplanet in this system.
