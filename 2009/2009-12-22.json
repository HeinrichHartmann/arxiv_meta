However, hyperaccretion disks around\nneutron stars may exist in some GRB formation scenarios. We study the structure\nand neutrino emission of a hyperaccretion disk around a neutron star. We\nconsider a steady-state hyperaccretion disk, and as a reasonable approximation,\ndivide it into two regions, the inner and outer disks. The outer disk is\nsimilar to that of a black hole. The inner disk has a self-similar structure,\nsuch as the entropy-conservation or the advection structure, depending on the\nenergy transfer and emission in the disk. We see that the neutron star disk can\ncool more efficiently, produce much higher neutrino luminosity and neutrino\nannihilation luminosity than a black hole disk. The neutrino emission from the\nneutron star surface boundary layer could increase the neutrino annihilation\nluminosity.\n  Moreover, we study the effects of a global magnetic field on\nviscously-rotating and vertically-integrated accretion disks around compact\nobjects using a self-similar treatment, and use two methods to study magnetized\nflows with convection.

By employing a\nsimple model for the self-energy Sigma of a MH state, we show that the\nfinite-size-scaling approach of the type utilised by KP is not reliable for the\nsystem sizes considered by KP. On the basis of the equivalence of the model\nunder consideration (at half-filling and for t'/t << 1) and the XXZ spin-chain\nHamiltonian for SU(2) spins, we further show that for V > V_c(t,t') the system\nunder consideration has a charge-density-wave (CDW) ground state (GS) in the\nthermodynamic limit, corresponding to a doubling of the unit cell in comparison\nwith that specific to the underlying lattice. Although this GS is also\ninsulating, its spectral gap is due to the broken translational symmetry of the\nGS; it is not a correlation-induced MH gap. The LT is therefore a priori valid\nfor this GS. This fact establishes that the conclusion by KP is indeed\nerroneous. Finally, we present a heuristic argument due to Volovik that sheds\nlight on the mechanism underlying the robustness of the LT.

We\ndesign a system, which we call MultiTrack, that consists of an overlay of\nmultiple \\emph{mTrackers} whose purpose is to align these goals. mTrackers\nsplit demand from users among different ISP domains while trying to minimize\ntheir individual costs (delay plus transit cost) in their ISP domain. We design\nthe signals in this overlay of mTrackers in such a way that potentially\ncompetitive individual optimization goals are aligned across the mTrackers. The\nmTrackers are also capable of doing admission control in order to ensure that\nusers who are from different ISP domains have a fair chance of being admitted\ninto the system, while keeping costs in check. We prove analytically that our\nsystem is stable and achieves maximum utility with minimum cost. Our design\ndecisions and control algorithms are validated by Matlab and ns-2 simulations.\n"]}]

Benchmarking of filter feature selection\nmethod is subsequently carried out by deploying different classifier models.\nThe result of the present study effectively supports the well known fact of\nincrease in the predictive accuracy with the existence of minimum number of\nfeatures.

Here,\nwe show that random unitary matrix multiplication at the relay nodes empowers\nthe RS scheme to achieve a better Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff (DMT) as\ncompared to the traditional AF relaying. First, we study the case of a\nmulti-antenna full-duplex single-relay two-hop network, for which we show that\nthe RS achieves the optimum DMT. Applying this result, we derive a new\nachievable DMT for the case of multi-antenna half-duplex parallel relay\nnetwork. Interestingly, it turns out that the DMT of the RS scheme is optimum\nfor the case of multi-antenna two parallel non-interfering half-duplex relays.\nNext, we show that random unitary matrix multiplication also improves the DMT\nof the Non-Orthogonal AF relaying scheme in the case of a multi-antenna single\nrelay channel. Finally, we study the general case of multi-antenna full-duplex\nrelay networks and derive a new lower-bound on its DMT using the RS scheme.\n","Comment: Submitted to the IEEE transaction on Information Theory in Dec. 2009"]}]

For example, we may only have\naccess to noisy measurements of the functions or statistical estimates provided\nthrough Monte Carlo sampling.

The most crucial results are: (i) some short\nGRBs occur in elliptical galaxies; (ii) the majority of short GRBs occur in\nstar forming galaxies; (iii) the star forming hosts of short GRBs are distinct\nfrom the host galaxies of long GRBs in terms of star formation rates,\nluminosities, and metallicities, and instead appear to be drawn from the\ngeneral field galaxy population; (iv) the physical offsets of short GRBs\nrelative to their host galaxy centers are significantly larger than for long\nGRBs; (v) the observed offset distribution agrees well with predictions for the\nlocations of NS-NS binary mergers; and (vi) unlike long GRBs, which tend to\noccur in the brightest regions of their hosts, the environments of short GRBs\ngenerally under-represent the light distribution of their host galaxies. Taken\ntogether, these observations suggest that short GRB progenitors have a wide age\ndistribution and generally track stellar mass rather than star formation\nactivity.

People can define DRFs to\nretrieve abstract values from interconnected concrete data objects. The\ndefinition of the corresponding MSF of a DRF can be derived syntactically from\nthe definition of the DRF. This MSF computes the set of memory units accessed\nwhen the DRF retrieves an abstract value. This memory unit set is called the\nmemory scope of the abstract value. Finally, the proof rule of assignment\nstatements in Hoare's logic is modified to deal with pointers. The basic idea\nis that a virtual value keeps unmodified as long as no memory unit in its scope\nis over-written. Another proof rule is added for memory allocation statements.\nThe consequence rule and the rules for control-flow statements are slightly\nmodified. They are essentially same as their original version in Hoare logic.\n  An example is presented to show the efficacy of this logic.

For several highly demanded destinations, recently fake\nvendors appeared in the market offering voice termination but providing only\nfalse answer supervision. The answered signal is returned immediately and calls\nare being charged without being connected. Different techniques are used to\nkeep the calling party on the line. One of these techniques is to play a record\nof a ring back tone (while the call is already being charged). Another, more\nsophisticated technique is to play a human voice randomly picked up from a set\nof records containing contents similar to: hello, hello, I cannot hear you\nApart the fact that the fallaciously established calls are charged at rates of\nreal calls, such malicious routes seriously handicap the switching process. The\nsystem does not detect a failure on signaling level and is unable to attempt\nthe call via backup routes, the call technically being already connected. Once\nthe call flow falls into such trap, the calls will continue being routed via\nthe fraudulent route until a manual intervention.\n"]}]

We present an asymptotic theory of the study\nof meandering (quasiperiodic spiral wave solutions) spiral waves which are\ndrifting due to symmetry breaking perturbations. This theory is based on\nearlier theories: the 1995 Biktashev et al theory of drift of rigidly rotating\nspirals, and the 1996 Biktashev et al theory of meander of spirals in\nunperturbed systems. We combine the two theories by first rewriting the 1995\ndrift theory using the symmetry quotient system method of the 1996 meander\ntheory, and then go on to extend the approach to meandering spirals by\nconsidering Floquet theory and using a singular perturbation method. We\ndemonstrate the work of the newly developed theory on simple examples. We also\ndevelop a numerical implementation of the quotient system method, demonstrate\nits numerical convergence and its use in calculations which would be difficult\nto do by the standard methods, and also link this study to the problem of\ncalculation of response functions of spiral waves.\n","Comment: PhD Thesis, University of Liverpool, Finalised March 2009, 282 pages,\n  many figures, pdf file size 5Mb"]}]
