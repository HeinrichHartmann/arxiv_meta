These\nsimulations include a prescription for star formation allowing us to track the\nfate of the stellar component as well. We investigate the effect of tidal\nstripping on cluster galaxies hosted in these dark matter subhalos as a\nfunction of cluster-centric radius. To quantify the extent of the dark matter\nhalos of cluster galaxies, we introduce the half mass radius r_half as a\ndiagnostic, and study its evolution with projected cluster-centric distance R\nas a function of redshift. We find a well defined trend for (r_half,R): the\ncloser the galaxies are to the center of the cluster, the smaller the half mass\nradius. Interestingly, this trend is inferred in all redshift frames examined\nin this work ranging from z=0 to z=0.7. At z=0, galaxy halos in the central\nregions of clusters are found to be highly truncated, with the most compact\nhalf mass radius of 10 kpc. We also find that r_half depends on luminosity and\nwe present scaling relations of r_half with galaxy luminosity. The\ncorresponding total mass of the cluster galaxies is also found to increase with\nprojected cluster-centric distance and luminosity, but with more scatter than\nthe (r_half,R) trend. Comparing the distribution of stellar mass to total mass\nfor cluster galaxies, we find that the dark matter component is preferentially\nstripped, whereas the stellar component remains protected by the halo and is\nmuch less affected by tidal forces. We compare these results with galaxy-galaxy\nlensing probes of r_half and find qualitative agreement. (Abridged)\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

We introduce a succinct\nabstract representation of these constraint atoms in which a constraint atom is\nrepresented compactly. We show two applications. First, under this\nrepresentation of constraint atoms, we generalize the Gelfond-Lifschitz\ntransformation and apply it to define stable models (also called answer sets)\nfor logic programs with arbitrary constraint atoms. The resulting semantics\nturns out to coincide with the one defined by Son et al., which is based on a\nfixpoint approach. One advantage of our approach is that it can be applied, in\na natural way, to define stable models for disjunctive logic programs with\nconstraint atoms, which may appear in the disjunctive head as well as in the\nbody of a rule. As a result, our approach to the stable model semantics for\nlogic programs with constraint atoms generalizes a number of previous\napproaches. Second, we show that our abstract representation of constraint\natoms provides a means to characterize dependencies of atoms in a program with\nconstraint atoms, so that some standard characterizations and properties\nrelying on these dependencies in the past for logic programs with ordinary\natoms can be extended to logic programs with constraint atoms.\n","Comment: 34 pages.

We point out that a process like reheating at the end of\ninflation will inevitably generate perturbations, even on superhorizon scales,\nby the local diffusion of energy. Provided that the reheating temperature is of\norder the GUT scale, the density contrast $\\delta_R$ for spheres of radius $R$\nwill be of order $10^{-5}$ at horizon entry, consistent with the values\nmeasured by \\texttt{WMAP}. If this were a purely classical process,\n$\\delta_R^2$ would fall as $1/R^4$ beyond the horizon, and the resulting\nprimordial density power spectrum would be $P(k) \\propto k^n$ with $n=4$.\nHowever, as shown by Gabrielli et al, a quantum diffusion process can generate\na power spectrum with any index in the range $0<n\\leq 4$, including values\nclose to the observed $n=1$ ($\\delta_R^2$ will then be $\\propto 1/R^{3+n}$ for\n$n<1$ and $1/R^4$ for $n>1$). Thus, the two characteristic parameters that\ndetermine the appearance of present day structures could be natural\nconsequences of this mechanism.
