It has been suggested that this WMAP haze emission could potentially be\nsynchrotron emission from relativistic electrons and positrons produced in the\nannihilations of one (or more) species of dark matter particles. In this paper\nwe re-calculate the intensity and morphology of the WMAP haze using a\nmulti-linear regression involving full-sky templates of the dominant forms of\ngalactic foreground emission, using two different CMB sky signal estimators.\nThe first estimator is a posterior mean CMB map, marginalized over a general\nforeground model using a Gibbs sampling technique, and the other is the ILC map\nproduced by the WMAP team. Earlier analyses of the WMAP haze used the ILC map,\nwhich is more contaminated by galactic foregrounds than the Gibbs map. In\neither case, we re-confirm earlier results that a statistically significant\nresidual emission remains after foreground subtraction that is concentrated\naround the galactic centre. However, we find that the significance of this\nemission can be significantly reduced by allowing for a subtle spatial\nvariation in the frequency dependence of soft synchrotron emission in the inner\nand outer parts of the galaxy. We also re-investigate the prospect of a\nneutralino dark matter interpretation of the origin of the haze, and find that\nsignificant boosting in the dark matter annihilation rate is required, relative\nto that obtained with a smooth galactic dark matter distribution, in order to\nreproduce the inferred residual emission, contrary to that deduced in several\nrecent studies.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 13 figures, 1 table"]}]

This first layer\ninterprets the collected instructions, API calls and arguments and classifies\nthese operations as well as the involved objects according to their purpose in\nthe malware lifecycle.

This layer\nrelies on parallel automata parsing attribute-grammars where semantic rules are\nused for object typing (object classification) and object binding (data-flow).\nTo feed detection and to experiment with our approach we have developed two\ndifferent abstraction components: one processing system call traces from native\ncode and one processing the VBScript interpreted language.

Computing\nbeamforming vectors relies on quantized channel state information (CSI)\nfeedback (limited feedback) from mobiles. Define the stability region for SDMA\nas the set of multiuser packet-arrival rates for which the steady-state queue\nlengths are finite. Given perfect CSI feedback and equal power allocation over\nscheduled queues, the stability region is proved to be a convex polytope having\nthe derived vertices. For any set of arrival rates in the stability region,\nmultiuser queues are shown to be stabilized by a joint queue-and-beamforming\ncontrol policy that maximizes the departure-rate-weighted sum of queue lengths.\nThe stability region for limited feedback is found to be the perfect-CSI region\nmultiplied by one minus a small factor. The required number of feedback bits\nper mobile is proved to scale logarithmically with the inverse of the above\nfactor as well as linearly with the number of transmit antennas minus one. The\neffects of limited feedback on queueing delay are also quantified. For Poisson\narrival processes, CSI quantization errors are shown to multiply average\nqueueing delay by a factor larger than one. This factor can be controlled by\nadjusting the number of feedback bits per mobile following the derived\nrelationship. For general arrival processes, CSI errors are found to increase\nKingman's bound on the tail probability of the instantaneous delay by one plus\na small factor. The required number of feedback bits per mobile is shown to\nscale logarithmically with this factor.\n","Comment: 26 pages"]}]
