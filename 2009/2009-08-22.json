An affine\nembedding of the homogeneous space G/H is an affine G-variety with an open\nG-orbit isomorphic to G/H. We start with some basic properties of affine\nembeddings and consider the cases, where the theory is well-developed: toric\nvarieties, normal SL(2)-embeddings, S-varieties, and algebraic monoids. We\ndiscuss connections between the theory of affine embeddings and Hilbert's 14th\nProblem via a theorem of Grosshans. We characterize affine homogeneous spaces\nG/H such that any affine embedding of G/H contains a finite number of G-orbits.\nThe maximal value of modality over all affine embeddings of a given affine\nhomogeneous space is computed and the group of equivariant automorphisms of an\nembedding is studied.
