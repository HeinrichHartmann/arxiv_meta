The spectral index ($\\alpha$) of these point sources in\n3.6--8.0mum bands display large values of $\\alpha$=2--5. A color-magnitude\nanalog plot was used to identify 79 infrared counterparts to the HMPOs. Compact\nnebulae are found in 75% of the detected sources with morphologies that can be\nwell described by core-halo, cometary, shell-like and bipolar geometries\nsimilar to those observed in ultra-compact HII regions.
