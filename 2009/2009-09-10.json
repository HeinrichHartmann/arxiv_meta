The goal is to do this in o(n) space, where n\nis the total number of identities.

Fractal dimensions of\nmatter distribution is a parameter that can be used to test the hypothesis of\nhomogeneity. In this method, galaxies are used as tracers of the distribution\nof matter and samples derived from various galaxy redshift surveys have been\nused to determine the scale of homogeneity in the Universe. Ideally, for\nhomogeneity, the distribution should be a mono-fractal with the fractal\ndimension equal to the ambient dimension. While this ideal definition is true\nfor infinitely large point sets, this may not be realised as in practice, we\nhave only a finite point set. The correct benchmark for realistic data sets is\na homogeneous distribution of a finite number of points and this should be used\nin place of the mathematically defined fractal dimension for infinite number of\npoints (D) as a requirement for approach towards homogeneity.

By developing hyperk\\\"ahler analogues of symplectic\ntechniques developed by Goldin, Holm, and Knutson, we give an explicit\ncombinatorial description of the Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology of an orbifold\nhypertoric variety in terms of the combinatorial data of a rational cooriented\nweighted hyperplane arrangement.
