This note introduces a\ndynamic programming algorithm that finds the optimal solution in polynomial\ntime and space, and shows that methods traditionally used to improve the speed\nof optimizations in related problems, such as the Hu-Tucker procedure, fail for\nthis problem. This note thus also introduces two approximation algorithms which\ncan find a suboptimal solution in linear time (for one) or $\\order(n \\log n)$\ntime (for the other), with associated coding redundancy bounds.\n","Comment: 7 pages, submitted to Elsevier"]}]

Galileo argued that in a\nvacuum all bodies fall at the same rate relative to the earth, independent of\ntheir mass. Aristotle seemed to consider all media to be viscous, and argued\nthat heavier bodies fall faster. Aristotle was challenged by Philoponus, who\nargued that light and heavy weights fall about equally fast in air, eleven\nhundred years before Galileo. As we shall see, the problem is more subtle than\nmeets the eye -- even in a frictionless medium. Philoponus and Galileo are\nright part of the time, and Aristotle is partly right some of the time. In fact\nthey are all wrong the rest of the time, with the lightest body falling fastest\nwhen two bodies fall toward the earth. In principle the results of a free fall\nexperiment depend on whether falling masses originate on earth, are\nextraterrestrial, are sequential or concurrent, or are simultaneous for\ncoincident or separated bodies, etc. When single falling bodies originate from\nthe earth, all bodies (light and heavy) fall at the same rate relative to the\nearth in agreement with Galileo's view. Einstein's General Relativity (EGR), in\nwhich gravity is due to space-time curvature, was motivated by the Galilean\nnotion that free-fall is independent of the mass and properties of a falling\nbody, and is just due to the properties of the milieu it finds itself in.\nQuantum mechanics is found to violate the Equivalence Principle of EGR.\n","Comment: In the 3-body rectilinear problem, an interesting comparison is made\n  between a purely center of mass consideration without introducing an\n  attraction force, and analysis of this problem using the gravitational force"]}]
