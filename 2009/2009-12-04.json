Despite this, the nature of some of\nthese systems, and of the accelerated particles producing the VHE emission, is\nunclear. To answer some of these open questions, we conducted a multiwavelength\ncampaign of the VHE gamma-ray emitting X-ray binary LS I +61 303 including the\nMAGIC telescope, XMM-Newton, and Swift during 60% of an orbit in 2007\nSeptember. We detect a simultaneous outburst at X-ray and VHE bands, with the\npeak at phase 0.62 and a similar shape at both wavelengths. A linear fit to the\nsimultaneous X-ray/VHE pairs obtained during the outburst yields a correlation\ncoefficient of r=0.97, while a linear fit to all simultaneous pairs provides\nr=0.81. Since a variable absorption of the VHE emission towards the observer is\nnot expected for the data reported here, the correlation found indicates a\nsimultaneity in the emission processes. Assuming that they are dominated by a\nsingle particle population, either hadronic or leptonic, the X-ray/VHE flux\nratio favors leptonic models. This fact, together with the detected photon\nindices, suggests that in LS I +61 303 the X-rays are the result of synchrotron\nradiation of the same electrons that produce VHE emission as a result of\ninverse Compton scattering of stellar photons.\n","Comment: To appear in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. 6 pages, 2 figures"]}]

The source displayed activity at all the\nobserved wavelengths: a general decreasing trend from optical to gamma-ray\nfrequencies was followed by an increase of radio emission after less than two\nmonths from the peak of the gamma-ray emission. The largest flux change, about\na factor of about 4, occurred in the X-ray band. The smallest was at\nultraviolet and near-infrared frequencies, where the rate of the detected\nphotons dropped by a factor 1.6-1.9. At optical wavelengths, where the sampling\nrate was the highest, it was possible to observe day-scale variability, with\nflux variations up to a factor of about 3. The behavior of PMN J0948+0022\nobserved in this campaign and the calculated power carried out by its jet in\nthe form of protons, electrons, radiation and magnetic field are quite similar\nto that of blazars, specifically of flat-spectrum radio quasars.

The parameters can be related to\nquantities that can be measured independently, like step length and frequency.\nThe microscopic behavior is, however, only poorly reproduced in many\nsituations, a person approaching a standing or slow obstacle will e.g. show\noscillations in position, and the trajectories of two persons meeting in a\ncorridor in opposite direction will be far from realistic and somewhat erratic.\nThis is inpart due to the assumption of instantaneous reaction on the momentary\nsituation. Obviously, persons react with a small time lag, while on the other\nhand they will anticipate changing situations for at least a short time. Thus\nbasing the repulsive interaction on a (linear) extrapolation over a short time\n(e.g. 1 s) eliminates the oscillations at slowing down and smoothes the\npatterns of giving way to others to a more realistic behavior. A second problem\nis the additive combination of binary interactions. It is shown that combining\nonly a few relevant interactions gives better model performance.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 5 figures, Preprint from PED 2008 (Wuppertal)"]}]
