Recognizing that the periodic erasure scheme usually used in the\ntechnical literature turns out to be quite inefficient when using real traffic\ntraces over a long period of time, we introduce a simple adaptive scheme that\nclosely follows the variations of traffic. When tested against real traffic\ntraces, the proposed on-line algorithm performs well in the sense that the\ndetection ratio of long flows by the algorithm over a long time period is quite\nhigh. Beyond the identification of elephants, this same class of algorithms is\napplied to the closely related problem of detection of anomalies in IP traffic,\ne.g., SYN flood due for instance to attacks. An algorithm for detecting SYN and\nvolume flood anomalies in Internet traffic is designed.

This behaviour is attributed to the fact\nthat anatomical elements act depending on the direction. Viscoelastic behaviour\nof reaction wood differs from that of normal or opposite wood. Compression wood\nof spruce, which has higher lignin content, is denser and stiffer in transverse\ndirections than normal wood, and has lower softening temperature (Tg). In\ntension wood, the G-layer is weakly attached to the rest of the wall layers.\nThis may explain why the storage modulus and the softening temperature of\ntension wood are lower than those for the opposite wood. In this work, we also\npoint out that the time-temperature equivalence fits only around the transition\nregion, i.e. between Tg and Tg + 30\\degree C. Apart from these regions, the\nwood response combines the effect of all constitutive polymers, so that the\nequivalence is not valid anymore.\n"]}]

The nonlinearity is local but rather\ngeneral encompassing for the first time both subcritical and supercritical (in\nL2) nonlinearities. We show that the center manifold formed by localized in\nspace periodic in time solutions (bound states) is an attractor for all\nsolutions with a small initial data. The proof hinges on dispersive estimates\nthat we obtain for the time dependent, Hamiltonian, linearized dynamics around\na one parameter family of bound states that \"shadows\" the nonlinear evolution\nof the system. The methods we employ are an extension to higher dimensions,\nhence different linear dispersive behavior, and to rougher nonlinearities of\nour previous results [10, 11, 7].\n","Comment: 40 pages"]}]
