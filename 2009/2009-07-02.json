We start from exact\nexpressions for shear-dependent steady-state averages, such as correlation and\nstructure functions, in the form of generalized Green-Kubo relations. To these\nwe apply approximations inspired by the mode coupling theory (MCT) for the\nquiescent system, accessing steady-state properties by integration through the\ntransient dynamics after startup of steady shear. Exact equations of motion,\nwith memory effects, for the required transient density correlation functions\nare derived next; these can also be approximated within an MCT-like approach.\nThis results in closed equations for the non-equilibrium stationary state of\nsheared dense colloidal dispersions, with the equilibrium structure factor of\nthe unsheared system as the only input. In three dimensions, these equations\ncurrently require further approximation prior to numerical solution. However,\nsome universal aspects can be analyzed exactly, including the discontinuous\nonset of a yield stress at the ideal glass transition predicted by MCT. Using\nthese methods we additionally discuss the distorted microstructure of a sheared\nhard-sphere colloid near the glass transition, and consider how this relates to\nthe shear stress. Time-dependent fluctuations around the stationary state are\nthen approximated, and compared to data from experiment and simulation; the\ncorrelators for yielding glassy states obey a `time-shear-superposition'\nprinciple. The work presented here fully develops an approach first outlined\npreviously (M. Fuchs and M. E. Cates, Phys. Rev.

Many a studies have been performed on the nature of these inter-atomic\ninteractions and the change of profile of atomic fluctuations that they cause.\nHowever, we still do not know, under a given context, for a given duration of\ntime, how does a macroscopic biophysical property emerge from the cumulative\ninter-atomic interactions. An exact answer to that question will involve\nbridging the gap between nano-scale distinguishable atomic description and\nmacroscopic indistinguishable (statistical) measures, along the mesoscopic\nscale of observation. In this work we propose a computationally implementable\nmathematical model that derives expressions for observability of emergence of a\nmacroscopic biophysical property from a set of interacting (fluctuating) atoms.\nSince most of the aforementioned interactions are non-linear in nature;\nobservability criteria are derived for both linear and the non-linear\ndescriptions of protein interior. The study assumes paramount importance in\n21st-century biology, from both the theoretical and practical utilitarian point\nof view.\n","Comment: A mathematical model, 25 pages"]}]

For this reason the actual\nformalism of QFT is partly based on a suitable generalization of the one\nalready used for systems of point particles. This circumstance gives rise to a\nnumber of conceptual problems, stemming essentially from the fact that the\nexistence within QFT of non-equivalent representations implies the existence of\nfield theories allowing, within the same theory, different, inequivalent,\ndescriptions of particles. This led some authors to claim that in QFT the\nconcept itself of particle should be abandoned. In this paper we will shortly\ndiscuss the validity of this claim, as well as the possibilities, so far\nexisting, of building alternative versions of QFT, not designed in advance to\nallow some kind of particle representation. We will also spend some words about\nthe generalizations of the concept itself of particle which could grant for a\nbetter cohabitation of particles and fields within a wider formulation of QFT.\nThe latter is indispensable if we want to extend the range of application of\nQFT from particle physics or simple condensed matter physics to other domains\nof scientific research.\n","Comment: 17 pages"]}]

It is based on an ensemble of dipole vortex tubes taken\nas quasi-particles and realized in form of rings, hairpins or filament couples\nof potentially finite length. In a not necesserily planar cross sectional area\nthrough a vortex tangle, taken locally orthogonal through each individual tube,\nthe dipoles are moving with the classical dipole velocity. The vortex radius is\ndirectly related with Prandtl's classical mixing length. The quasi-particles\nperform dipol chaos which reminds of molecular chaos in real gases. Collisions\nbetween quasi-particles lead either to particle annihilation (turbulent\ndissipation) or to particle scattering (turbulent diffusion). These ideas\nsuffice to develop a closed theory of shear-generated turbulence without\nempirical parameters, with analogies to birth and death processes of\nmacromolecules. It coincides almost perfectly with the well-known K-Omega\nturbulence closure applied in many branches of science and technology. In the\ncase of free homogeneous decay the TKE is shown to follow 1/t.
