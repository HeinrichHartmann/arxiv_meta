The data reveal\nthat there is only one transition observed over the entire range of variables\nexplored, which is a combined magnetic and structural transformation between\nthe paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phases (Tc~255 K for this composition). The\nstructural part of the transition is associated with an expansion of the\nhexagonal unit cell in the direction of the a- and b-axes and a contraction of\nthe c-axis as the FM phase is formed, which originates from an increase in the\nintra-layer metal-metal bond distance. The application of pressure is found to\nhave an adverse effect on the formation of the FM phase since pressure opposes\nthe expansion of the lattice and hence decreases Tc. The application of a\nmagnetic field, on the other hand, has the expected effect of enhancing the FM\nphase and increasing Tc.

Many proposals have been put forth to\nexplain these data, usually relying on a single particle to annihilate or decay\nto produce e+e-. In this paper, we consider models with multiple species of\nWIMPs with significantly different masses. We show if such dark matter\ncandidates chi_i annihilate into light bosons, they naturally produce equal\nannihilation rates, even as the available numbers of pairs for annihilation\nn_chi_i^2 differ by orders of magnitude. We argue that a consequence of these\nmodels can be to add additional signal naturally at lower (~100 GeV) versus\nhigher (~ TeV) energies, changing the expected spectrum and even adding bumps\nat lower energies, which may alleviate some of the tension in the required\nannihilation rates between PAMELA and Fermi. These spectral changes may yield\nobservable consequences in the microwave Haze signal observed at the upcoming\nPlanck satellite. Such a model can connect to other observable signals such as\nDAMA and INTEGRAL by having the lighter (heavier) state be a pseudo-Dirac\nfermion with splitting 100 keV (1 MeV). We show that variations in the halo\nvelocity dispersion can alleviate constraints from final state radiation in the\ngalactic center and galactic ridge. If the lighter WIMP has a large\nself-interaction cross section, the light-WIMP halo might collapse,\ndramatically altering expectations for direct and indirect detection\nsignatures.\n"]}]

We consider these questions here,\nproviding eventually a virtual machine and compilation based realization. A key\nidea is the orientation of the computation model of Lambda Prolog around a\nrestricted version of higher-order unification with nice algorithmic properties\nand appearing to encompass most interesting applications. Our virtual machine\nembeds a treatment of this form of unification within the structure of the\nWarren Abstract Machine that is used in traditional Prolog implementations.\nAlong the way, we treat various auxiliary issues such as the low-level\nrepresentation of lambda terms, the implementation of reduction on such terms\nand the optimized processing of types in computation. We also develop an actual\nimplementation of Lambda Prolog called Teyjus Version 2. A characteristic of\nthis system is that it realizes an emulator for the virtual machine in the C\nlanguage a compiler in the OCaml language. We present a treatment of the\nsoftware issues that arise from this kind of mixing of languages within one\nsystem and we discuss issues relevant to the portability of our virtual machine\nemulator across arbitrary architectures. Finally, we assess the the efficacy of\nour various design ideas through experiments carried out using the system.\n"]}]
