Furthermore, if we take into\nconsideration both the left-handed and right-handed components of the neutrino\n(included in a lepton triplet along with their corresponding left-handed\ncharged partner) then we are in the position to propose an original method for\nthe neutrino to acquire a very small but non-zero mass without spoiling the\npreviously achieved results in the exact solution of the model. In order to be\ncompatible with the existing phenomenological data, the range of that sole\nparameter imposes in our method a large order of magnitude for the VEV\n$<\\phi>\\sim10^{6}$ TeV. Consequently, the new bosons of the model have to be\nvery massive.\n  PACS numbers: 14.60.St; 12.60.Cn; 12.60.Fr\n","Comment: 15 pages, no figures"]}]
