We find that for the same rms Mach number, compressive\nforcing produces much stronger density enhancements and larger voids compared\nto solenoidal forcing. Consequently, the Fourier spectra of density\nfluctuations are significantly steeper. This result is confirmed using the\nDelta-variance analysis, which yields power-law exponents beta~3.4 for\ncompressive forcing and beta~2.8 for solenoidal forcing.

Although\nordinary Hex is famously difficult to analyze, Random-Turn Hex--in which\nplayers toss a coin before each turn to decide who gets to place the next\nstone--has a simple optimal strategy. It belongs to a general class of\nrandom-turn games--called selection games--in which the expected payoff when\nboth players play the random-turn game optimally is the same as when both\nplayers play randomly. We also describe the optimal strategy and study the\nexpected length of the game under optimal play for Random-Turn Hex and several\nother selection games.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 7 figures"]}]

The first example is a family $\\mu_P^{s,t}$ of measures on a\nspace of functions on the two-torus, parametrized by a polynomial $P$ (the\nWess-Zumino-Landau-Ginzburg model). The second is a family $\\mu_\\cG^{s,t}$ of\nmeasures on a space $\\cG$ of maps from $\\P^1$ to a Lie group (the\nWess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model). Finally we study a family $\\mu_{M,G}^{s,t}$\nof measures on the product of a space of connection s on the trivial principal\nbundle with structure group $G$ on a three-dimensional manifold $M$ with a\nspace of $\\fg$-valued three-forms on $M.$\n  We show that these measures are positive, and that the measures\n$\\mu_\\cG^{s,t}$ are Borel probability measures. As an application we show that\nformulas arising from expectations in the measures $\\mu_\\cG^{s,1}$ reproduce\nformulas discovered by Frenkel and Zhu in the theory of vertex operator\nalgebras. We conjecture that a similar computation for the measures\n$\\mu_{M,SU(2)}^{s,t},$ where $M$ is a homology three-sphere, will yield the\nCasson invariant of $M.$\n","Comment: Minor corrections"]}]
