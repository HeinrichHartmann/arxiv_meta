Each codeword\ndefines a skeleton of a basis for a subspace in reduced row echelon form. This\nskeleton contains a Ferrers diagram on which we design a rank-metric code. Each\nsuch rank-metric code is lifted to a constant dimension code. The union of\nthese codes is our final constant dimension code. In particular the codes\nconstructed recently by Koetter and Kschischang are a subset of our codes. The\nrank-metric codes used for this construction form a new class of rank-metric\ncodes. We present a decoding algorithm to the constructed codes in the\nprojective space. The efficiency of the decoding depends on the efficiency of\nthe decoding for the constant weight codes and the rank-metric codes.

The main purpose of the present paper is to prove\nthis axiom for {\\it nondegenerate} Hamiltonian functions in {\\it irrational}\nsymplectic manifolds $(M,\\omega)$. We also prove that the spectral invariant\nfunction $\\rho_a: H \\mapsto \\rho(H;a)$ can be pushed down to a {\\it continuous}\nfunction defined on the universal ({\\it \\'etale}) covering space\n$\\widetilde{Ham}(M,\\omega)$ of the group $Ham(M,\\omega)$ of Hamiltonian\ndiffeomorphisms on general $(M,\\omega)$. For a certain generic homotopy, which\nwe call a {\\it Cerf homotopy} $\\HH = \\{H^s\\}_{0 \\leq s\\leq 1}$ of Hamiltonians,\nthe function $\\rho_a \\circ \\HH: s \\mapsto \\rho(H^s;a)$ is piecewise smooth away\nfrom a countable subset of $[0,1]$ for each non-zero quantum cohomology class\n$a$.\n  The proof of this nondegenerate spectrality relies on several new ingredients\nin the chain level Floer theory, which have their own independent interest: a\nstructure theorem on the Cerf bifurcation diagram of the critical values of the\naction functionals associated to a generic one-parameter family of Hamiltonian\nfunctions, a general structure theorem and the handle sliding lemma of Novikov\nFloer cycles over such a family and a {\\it family version} of new\ntransversality statements involving the Floer chain map, and many others. We\ncall this chain level Floer theory as a whole the {\\it Floer mini-max theory}.\n","Comment: 74 pages; An incorrect statement in Theorem 3.7 corrected which\n  results in partial rewriting of section 8 and 9.

Dinur and Friedgut later showed that this statement also\nholds if we replace the discrete domain $\\{0,1\\}^n$ with the continuous domain\n$[0,1]^n$, under the extra assumption that $f$ is increasing. They conjectured\nthat the condition of monotonicity is unnecessary and can be removed.\n  We show that certain constant-depth decision trees provide counter-examples\nto Dinur-Friedgut conjecture. This suggests a reformulation of the conjecture\nin which the function $g:[0,1]^n \\to \\{0,1\\}$ instead of depending on a small\nnumber of variables has a decision tree of small depth. In fact we prove this\nreformulation by showing that the depth of the decision tree of $g$ can be\nbounded by $e^{O(I_f/\\epsilon^2)}$.\n  Furthermore we consider a second notion of the influence of a variable, and\nstudy the functions that have bounded total influence in this sense. We use a\ntheorem of Bourgain to show that these functions have certain properties. We\nalso study the relation between the two different notions of influence.\n","Comment: Final version"]}]
