The z-measures live on the Thoma simplex, an\ninfinite-dimensional compact space which is a kind of dual object to the\ninfinite symmetric group. The aim of the paper is to introduce stochastic\ndynamics related to the z-measures. Namely, we construct a family of diffusion\nprocesses in the Toma simplex indexed by the same parameter z. Our diffusions\nare obtained from certain Markov chains on partitions of natural numbers n in a\nscaling limit as n goes to infinity. These Markov chains arise in a natural\nway, due to the approximation of the infinite symmetric group by the increasing\nchain of the finite symmetric groups. Each z-measure P_z serves as a unique\ninvariant distribution for the corresponding diffusion process, and the process\nis ergodic with respect to P_z. Moreover, P_z is a symmetrizing measure, so\nthat the process is reversible. We describe the spectrum of its generator and\ncompute the associated (pre)Dirichlet form.\n","Comment: AMSTex, 33 pages.
