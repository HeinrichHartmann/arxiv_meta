Though the most famous example\nis the confinement of quarks to form baryons and mesons in (3+1)-dimensional\nQuantum Chromodynamics, confinement can also be realized in the systems of\ncondensed matter physics such as spin-ladders which consist of two spin-1/2\nantiferromagnetic chains coupled together by spin exchange interactions.\nExcitations of individual chains (spinons) carrying spin S=1/2, are confined\neven by an infinitesimal interchain coupling. The realizations studied so far\ncannot illustrate this process due to the large strength of their interchain\ncoupling which leaves no energy window for the spinon excitations of individual\nchains. Here we present neutron scattering experiments for a weakly-coupled\nladder material. At high energies the spectral function approaches that of\nindividual chains; at low energies it is dominated by spin 0,1 excitations of\nstrongly-coupled chains.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 4 figures, references added"]}]

If G is a word\nhyperbolic group which is delta hyperbolic with respect to a symmetric\ngenerating set S, then there is a positive constant C depending only on delta\nand on |S| such that every element of G either has a power which is conjugate\nto its inverse, or else the stable commutator length is at least equal to C.
