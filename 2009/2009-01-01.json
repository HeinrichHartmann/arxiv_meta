The model\nrepresents the acoustic energy dissipated in terms of Rayleigh dissipation\nfunctional that depends on the local strain rate. We show that the nature of\nthe peel front exhibits rich spatiotemporal patterns ranging from smooth,\nrugged and stuck-peeled configurations that depend on three parameters, namely,\nthe ratio of inertial time scale of the tape mass to that of the roller, the\ndissipation coefficient and the pull velocity. The stuck-peeled configurations\nare reminiscent of fibrillar peel front patterns observed in experiments. We\nshow that while the intermittent peeling is controlled by the peel force\nfunction, the model acoustic energy dissipated depends on the nature of the\npeel front and its dynamical evolution. Even though the acoustic energy is a\nfully dynamical quantity, it can be quite noisy for a certain set of parameter\nvalues suggesting the deterministic origin of acoustic emission in experiments.\nTo verify this suggestion, we have carried out a dynamical analysis of\nexperimental acoustic emission time series for a wide range of traction\nvelocities.
