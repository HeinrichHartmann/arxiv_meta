Over the past several years, a number of supernova identification\nschemes have been proposed that rely on photometric information only. Some of\nthese schemes use color-color or color-magnitude diagrams; others simply fit\nsupernova data to models. Both of these approaches suffer a number of drawbacks\npartially addressed in the so-called Bayesian-based supernova classification\ntechniques. However, Bayesian techniques are also problematic in that they\ntypically require that the supernova candidate be one of a known set of\nsupernova types. This presents a number of problems, the most obvious of which\nis that there are bound to be objects that do not conform to any presently\nknown model in large supernova candidate samples. We propose a new photometric\nclassification scheme that uses a Bayes factor based on color in order to\nidentify supernovae by type. This method does not require knowledge of the\ncomplete set of possible astronomical objects that could mimic a supernova\nsignal. Further, as a Bayesian approach, it accounts for all systematic and\nstatistical uncertainties of the measurements in a single step.
