However,\nit is not clear whether such activity states are specific to simple IF models,\nor if they also exist in networks where neurons are endowed with complex\nintrinsic properties similar to electrophysiological measurements. Here, we\ninvestigate the occurrence of AI states in networks of nonlinear IF neurons,\nsuch as the adaptive exponential IF (Brette-Gerstner-Izhikevich) model. This\nmodel can display intrinsic properties such as low-threshold spike (LTS),\nregular spiking (RS) or fast-spiking (FS). We successively investigate the\noscillatory and AI dynamics of thalamic, cortical and thalamocortical networks\nusing such models. AI states can be found in each case, sometimes with\nsurprisingly small network size of the order of a few tens of neurons. We show\nthat the presence of LTS neurons in cortex or in thalamus, explains the robust\nemergence of AI states for relatively small network sizes. Finally, we\ninvestigate the role of spike-frequency adaptation (SFA). In cortical networks\nwith strong SFA in RS cells, the AI state is transient, but when SFA is\nreduced, AI states can be self-sustained for long times. In thalamocortical\nnetworks, AI states are found when the cortex is itself in an AI state, but\nwith strong SFA, the thalamocortical network displays Up and Down state\ntransitions, similar to intracellular recordings during slow-wave sleep or\nanesthesia. Self-sustained Up and Down states could also be generated by\ntwo-layer cortical networks with LTS cells.

That\ngenerating function is rational: the numerator has degree four and the\ndenominator has degree three. Let a column-duplex polyomino be a polyomino\nwhose columns can have either one or two connected components. A simplex-duplex\npolyomino is a column-duplex polyomino in which there is no occurrence of two\nadjacent columns each having two connected components. Simplex-duplex\npolyominoes are not easy to deal with, but their area generating function can\nstill be found. To find this generating function, we use an upgraded version of\nthe Temperley method. Though that technique is widely used in these times, our\napplication presents two interesting features. Firstly, we add one or two\ncolumns at a time, thus bypassing those simplex-duplex polyominoes which end\nwith a two-component column. (It is somewhat more usual to add just one column\nat a time.) Secondly, we obtain a functional equation that involves both the\nfirst and the second derivatives of the sought-for generating function. (Such\nequations usually involve the first derivative only. In some cases, no\nderivative is involved at all.) Right because of this latter interesting\nfeature, the Temperley method produces a very complicated formula for the\ngenerating function. Anyway, from that formula it is easy to compute Taylor\npolynomials. Thus we get plenty of evidence that the number of n-celled\nsimplex-duplex polyominoes behaves asymptotically as 0.119443*3.522020^n. For\ncomparison, the number of n-celled column-convex polyominoes behaves\nasymptotically as 0.180916*3.205569^n.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 5 figures"]}]

A Late Minoan clay disk has\nbeen identified as a ritual calendrical object showing the most important\ncelestial cycles, especially the lunar octaeteris. The disk, as well as the\nMinoan stone kernoi, were probably used in relation to the Minoan festival\ncalendar. The orientations of the central courts of the palaces of Knossos,\nPhaistos, Mallia and Gournia were to the rising sun, whereas the Eastern\npalaces Zakros and Petras were oriented to the southernmost and the\nnorthernmost risings of the moon, respectively. The E-W axes of the courts of\nKnossos and Phaistos were oriented to the sunrise five days before the vernal\nequinox.

The two encoders\nmake distinct partial observations of a Markov source. Each encoder must encode\nits observations into a sequence of discrete symbols. The symbols are\ntransmitted over noisy channels to a finite memory receiver that attempts to\nreconstruct some function of the state of the Markov source. Encoding and\ndecoding must be done in real-time, that is, the distortion measure does not\ntolerate delays. Under the assumption that the encoders' observations are\nconditionally independent Markov chains given an unobserved time-invariant\nrandom variable, results on the structure of optimal real-time encoders and the\nreceiver are obtained. It is shown that there exist finite-dimensional\nsufficient statistics for the encoders. The problem with noiseless channels and\nperfect memory at the receiver is then considered. A new methodology to find\nthe structure of optimal real-time encoders is employed. A sufficient statistic\nwith a time-invariant domain is found for this problem. This methodology\nexploits the presence of common information between the encoders and the\nreceiver when communication is over noiseless channels.\n"]}]
