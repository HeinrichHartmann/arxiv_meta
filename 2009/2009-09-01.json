Both reservoirs consist of $N$ possible ball locations.\nThe upper reservoir contains initially $n_h\\le N$ weight-1 balls and the lower\nreservoir contains initially $n_l\\le N$ weight-1 balls. Empty locations are\ntreated as weight-0 balls. These reservoirs are being shaken up so that all\npossible ball configurations are equally likely to occur. A cycle consists of\nexchanging a ball randomly picked from the higher reservoir and a ball randomly\npicked from the lower reservoir. It is straightforward to show that the\nefficiency, defined as the ratio of the average work produced to the average\nenergy lost by the higher reservoir is $\\eta=1-E_l/E_h$. We then relate this\nsystem to a heat engine. This thermal interpretation is applicable only when\nthe number of balls is large. We define the entropy as the logarithm of the\nnumber of ball configurations in a reservoir, namely $S(n)=\\ln[N!/n!(N-n)!]$,\nwith subscripts $h,l$ appended to $S$ and to $n$. When $n_l$ does not differ\nmuch from $n_h$, the system efficiency quoted above is found to coincide with\nthe maximum efficiency $\\eta=1-T_l/T_h$, where the $T$ are absolute\ntemperatures defined from the above expression of $S$.

We show that the ejecta chemistry does not reach a steady\nstate within the relevant time-span for molecule formation. The primary species\nformed are O2, CO, SiS, and SO. The SiO, formed as early as 200 days after\nexplosion, is rapidly depleted by the formation of silica molecular precursors\nin the ejecta. The rapid conversion of CO to C2 and its thermal fractionation\nat temperatures above 5000 K allow for the formation of carbon chains in the\noxygen-rich zone of the unmixed models, providing an important pathway for the\nformation of carbon dust in hot environments where the C/O ratio is less than\n1.

The pseudogap opens around the ($\\pi$,0)\nantinodes below a temperature $T^*$ leaving Fermi arcs across the remnant Fermi\nsurface\\cite{Kanigel} on which the superconducting gap forms at $T_c$.

We investigate two characteristics\nof randomness, the stochastic and algorithmic complexity of the binary sequence\nof mistakes. A learner with a Markov model of order $k$ is trained on a finite\nbinary sequence produced by a Markov source of order $k^{*}$ and is tested on a\ndifferent random sequence. As a measure of learner's complexity we define a\nquantity called the \\emph{sysRatio}, denoted by $\\rho$, which is the ratio\nbetween the compressed and uncompressed lengths of the binary string whose\n$i^{th}$ bit represents the maximum \\emph{a posteriori} decision made at state\n$i$ of the learner's model. The quantity $\\rho$ is a measure of information\ndensity. The main result of the paper shows that this ratio is crucial in\nanswering the above posed question. The result indicates that there is a\ncritical threshold $\\rho^{*}$ such that when $\\rho\\leq\\rho^{*}$ the sequence of\nmistakes possesses the following features: (1)\\emph{}low divergence $\\Delta$\nfrom a random sequence, (2) low variance in algorithmic complexity. When\n$\\rho>\\rho^{*}$, the characteristics of the mistake sequence changes sharply\ntowards a\\emph{}high\\emph{$\\Delta$} and high variance in algorithmic\ncomplexity.\n"]}]

At unit rate, independently for\neach site, the mass at the site is split into two parts by choosing a random\nproportion distributed according to some specified probability measure on\n$[0,1]$ and dividing the mass in that proportion. One part then moves to each\nof the two adjacent sites. This paper considers a continuous analogue of this\nevolution, which may be described by means of a stochastic flow of kernels, the\ntheory of which was developed by Le Jan and Raimond. One of their results is\nthat such a flow is characterized by specifying its $N$ point motions, which\nform a consistent family of Brownian motions. This means for each dimension $N$\nwe have a diffusion in ${\\mathbf{R}}^N$, whose $N$ coordinates are all Brownian\nmotions. Any $M$ coordinates taken from the $N$-dimensional process are\ndistributed as the $M$-dimensional process in the family. Moreover, in this\nsetting, the only interactions between coordinates are local: when coordinates\ndiffer in value they evolve independently of each other. In this paper we\nexplain how such multidimensional diffusions may be constructed and\ncharacterized via martingale problems.\n","Comment: Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/08-AOP431 the Annals of\n  Probability (http://www.imstat.org/aop/) by the Institute of Mathematical\n  Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)"]}]
