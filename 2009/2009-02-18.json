Such a decay is allowed in\nextensions of the MSSM with CP-violating interactions and in the NMSSM, and can\ndominate Higgs boson final states, thereby evading the LEP constraints on\nstandard Higgs boson production. The light spin-zero state decays primarily via\na to bb and tau+tau-, so this signal channel retains features distinct from the\nmain backgrounds. Our study shows that at the Tevatron, there may be potential\nto observe a few events in the bb tau+tau- or bbbb channels with relatively\nsmall background, although this observation would be statistically limited. At\nthe LHC, the background problem is more severe, but with cross sections and\nintegrated luminosities orders of magnitude larger than at the Tevatron, the\nobservation of a Higgs boson in this decay mode would be possible. The channel\nh to aa to bbbb would provide a large statistical significance, with a\nsignal-to-background ratio on the order of 1:2. In these searches, the main\nchallenge would be to retain the adequate tagging efficiency of b's and tau's\nin the low p_T region.\n","Comment: Version to be published in JHEP. 20 pages, 5 figures"]}]

In the case of massive neutrinos, the contributions to FCNCs\nin the charged lepton sector are highly suppressed, due to the smallness of\nneutrino masses.

This paper\nexamines two tradeoffs in applying RNC: The first studies how the performance\nof RNC varies with a node's randomizing capabilities. Specifically, a limited\nrandomized network coding (L-RNC) scheme - in which intermediate nodes perform\nrandomized encoding based on only a limited number of random coefficients - is\nproposed and its performance bounds are analyzed. Such a L-RNC approach is\napplicable to networks in which nodes have either limited computation/storage\ncapacity or have ambiguity about downstream edge connectivity (e.g., as in ad\nhoc sensor networks). A second tradeoff studied here examines the relationship\nbetween the reliability and the capacity gains of generalized RNC, i.e., how\nthe outage probability of RNC relates to the transmission rate at the source\nnode. This tradeoff reveals that significant reductions in outage probability\nare possible when the source transmits deliberately and only slightly below\nnetwork capacity. This approach provides an effective means to improve the\nfeasibility probability of RNC when the size of the finite field is fixed.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Communications"]}]

In this paper, we report the detailed analysis of X-ray\nand infrared observations of the transient and its surroundings. Chandra\nbservations detect the source at a flux of F_X = 2e-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (2-8\nkeV). After accounting for absorption both in the interstellar medium and in\nmaterial local to the source, the implied luminosity of the source is only L_X\n= 4e34 erg/s (2-8 keV; D=8 kpc). However, the diffuse X-ray emission near the\nsource also brightened by a factor of 2. The enhanced diffuse X-ray emission\nlies on top of a known ridge of dust and ionized gas that is visible infrared\nimages. We interpret the X-ray emission as scattered flux from the outburst,\nand determine that the peak luminosity of CXOGC J174540.0-290031 was >2e36\nerg/s. We suggest that the relatively small observed flux results from the fact\nthat the system is observed nearly edge-on, so that the accretion disk\nintercepts most of the flux emitted along our line of sight. We compare the\ninferred peak X-ray luminosity to that of the radio jet. The ratio of the X-ray\nto radio luminosities, L_X/L_R<1e4, is considerably smaller than in other known\nLMXBs (> 1e5). This is probably because the jets are radiating with unusually\nhigh efficiency at the point where they impact the surrounding interstellar\nmedium. This hypothesis is supported by a comparison with mid-infrared images\nof the surrounding dust. Finally, we find that the minimum power required to\nproduce the jet, L_jet~1e37 erg/s, is comparable to the inferred peak X-ray\nluminosity. This is the most direct evidence yet obtained that LMXBs accreting\nat low rates release about half of their energy as jets.\n","Comment: 11 pages, including 9 figures (6 color). submitted to ApJ"]}]

LGS-AO has dramatically improved the\nquality, robustness, and versatility with which high angular resolution\ninfrared images of the Galactic center can be obtained with the W. M. Keck II\n10-meter telescope. Specifically, Strehl ratios of 0.7 and 0.3 at L'[3.8\nmicron] and K'[2.1 micron], respectively, are achieved in these LGS-AO images.\nDuring our observations, the infrared counterpart to the central supermassive\nblack hole, Sgr A*-IR, showed significant infrared intensity variations, with\nobserved L' magnitudes ranging from 12.6 to 14.5 mag. The faintest end of our\nL' detections, 1.3 mJy (dereddened), is the lowest level of emission yet\nobserved for this source by a factor of 3. No significant variation in the\nlocation of SgrA*-IR is detected as a function of either wavelength or\nintensity. Near a peak in its intensity, we obtained the first measurement of\nSgrA*-IR's K'-L' color (3.0 +- 0.2 mag, observed), which corresponds to an\nintrinsic spectral index of -0.5 +- 0.3.

Because our measurement was taken at a time when\nSgr A* was ~6 times brighter in the infrared than the other measurements, we\nposit that the spectral index of the emission arising from the vicinity of our\nGalaxy's central black hole may depend on the strength of the flare, with\nstronger flares giving rise to a higher fraction of high energy electrons in\nthe emitting region.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ (to appear in 20 Dec 2005, vol. 635\n  issue), 9 pages and 5 figures"]}]
