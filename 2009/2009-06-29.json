The quest for ultra-compact laser that can\ndirectly generate coherent optical fields at the nano-scale, far beyond the\ndiffraction limit of light, remains a key fundamental challenge. Microscopic\nlasers based on photonic crystals, micro-disks, metal clad cavities and\nnanowires can now reach the diffraction limit, which restricts both the optical\nmode size and physical device dimension to be larger than half a wavelength.\nWhile surface plasmons are capable of tightly localizing light, ohmic loss at\noptical frequencies has inhibited the realization of truly nano-scale lasers.\nRecent theory has proposed a way to significantly reduce plasmonic loss while\nmaintaining ultra-small modes by using a hybrid plasmonic waveguide. Using this\napproach, we report an experimental demonstration of nano-scale plasmonic\nlasers producing optical modes 100 times smaller than the diffraction limit,\nutilizing a high gain Cadmium Sulphide semiconductor nanowire atop a Silver\nsurface separated by a 5 nm thick insulating gap. Direct measurements of\nemission lifetime reveal a broad-band enhancement of the nanowire's spontaneous\nemission rate by up to 6 times due to the strong mode confinement and the\nsignature of apparently threshold-less lasing. Since plasmonic modes have no\ncut-off, we show down-scaling of the lateral dimensions of both device and\noptical mode.

These results have\npreviously been obtained in two quite different ways. Either by a\n``scalarization of the sources'', where the relevant scalar quantities are\nessentially vector potential components and where the derivation was limited to\nisotropic media; or alternatively by using the ``scalar Hertz potentials'', and\nthis method has been applied to more general media. In this paper it is shown\nthat both methods are equivalent for gyrotropic media.

It is shown that the\nmethod based on the vector potential, which previously used a non-traditional\ndefinition of the vector potentials, can also be obtained using the traditional\ndefinition provided a proper gauge condition is applied and this method is then\nextended from isotropic to gyrotropic media. It is shown that the 2 basic\nscalar Hertz potentials occurring in the second method are invariant under the\nsource scalarization transformations of the first method and therefore are the\nnatural potentials for obtaining scalarization.
