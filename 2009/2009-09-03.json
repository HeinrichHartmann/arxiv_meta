Basic\nidentities from probability theory and previously unnoticed conditional\ndependencies of the propositions involved are used to decide among the\nalternatives. In the case of cosmic fine-tuning, information about the\nobservation is not independent of the hypothesis. It follows that the\nobservation should be used as data when comparing hypotheses.

The \"some\nuniverse\" (SU) approach is found wanting. Several reasons are given on why the\n\"this universe\" (TU) approach seems to be correct. Lastly, the converse\nselection effect by White is clarified by showing formally that the converse\ncondition leads to SU and its absence to TU. The overall result is that,\nbecause multiverse hypotheses do not predict the fine-tuning for this universe\nany better than a single universe hypothesis, the multiverse hypotheses fail as\nexplanations for cosmic fine-tuning.

This rate is proportional to the clumping factor C\n= <rho_b^2> / avg(rho_b)^2, where rho_b and avg(rho_b) are the local and cosmic\nmean baryon density, respectively, and the brackets < > indicate spatial\naveraging over the recombining gas in the IGM.

We focus on the effect of photo-ionisation heating by a\nuniform ultra-violet background and find that photo-heating strongly reduces\nthe clumping factor because the increased pressure support smoothes out\nsmall-scale density fluctuations. Photo-ionisation heating is often said to\nprovide a negative feedback on the reionisation of the IGM because it\nsuppresses the cosmic star formation rate by boiling the gas out of low-mass\nhalos. However, because of the reduction of the clumping factor it also makes\nit easier to keep the IGM ionised. Photo-heating therefore also provides a\npositive feedback which, while known to exist, has received much less\nattention. We demonstrate that this positive feedback is in fact very strong.\nUsing conservative assumptions, we find that if the IGM was reheated at z >~ 9,\nthe observed population of star-forming galaxies at z = 6 may be sufficient to\nkeep the IGM ionised, provided that the fraction of ionising photons that\nescape the star-forming regions to ionise the IGM is larger than 0.2.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables.

Penalized loss function\nminimization has been shown to be effective for this task both theoretically\nand empirically. With the virtues of both regularization and sparsity, the\n$L_1$-penalized squared error minimization method Lasso has been popular in\nregression models and beyond. In this paper, we combine different norms\nincluding $L_1$ to form an intelligent penalty in order to add side information\nto the fitting of a regression or classification model to obtain reasonable\nestimates. Specifically, we introduce the Composite Absolute Penalties (CAP)\nfamily, which allows given grouping and hierarchical relationships between the\npredictors to be expressed. CAP penalties are built by defining groups and\ncombining the properties of norm penalties at the across-group and within-group\nlevels. Grouped selection occurs for nonoverlapping groups. Hierarchical\nvariable selection is reached by defining groups with particular overlapping\npatterns. We propose using the BLASSO and cross-validation to compute CAP\nestimates in general. For a subfamily of CAP estimates involving only the $L_1$\nand $L_{\\infty}$ norms, we introduce the iCAP algorithm to trace the entire\nregularization path for the grouped selection problem.

In this paper, we prove a combinatorial version of\nthis theorem for hypercubes. It is not hard to show that for any cover of the\nfacets of a d-cube by d sets of facets, at least one such set contains a pair\nof antipodal ridges. However, we show that for any cover of the ridges of a\nd-cube by d sets of ridges, at least one set must contain a pair of antipodal\nk-faces, and we determine the maximum k for which this must occur, for all\ndimensions except d=5.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 2 figures.

The isovalent substitution of Te for Se such as in FeSe0.5Te0.5\nincreases Tc by twofold in comparison to a-FeSe without changing the carrier\nconcentration but, on average, decreases the chalcogen-Fe bond angle. However,\nwe find that the local symmetry is lower than the average P4/nmm crystal\nsymmetry, because the Se and Te ions do not share the same site, leading to two\ndistinct z-coordinates that exhibit two types of bond angles with Fe. The angle\nindeed increases from ~ 104.02o in FeSe to ~105.20o in FeSe0.5Te0.5 between Fe\nand Se. Simultaneously, ab-initio calculations based on spin density function\ntheory yielded an optimized structure with distinct z-coordinates for Se and\nTe, in agreement with the experiment. The valence charge distribution in the\nFe-Se bonds was found to be different from that in the Fe-Te bonds.
