One science goal of the upcoming Planck mission is to perform a\nfull-sky cluster survey based on the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, which\nleads to the question of how such a survey would be affected by cosmological\nmodels with a different history of structure formation than LCDM. One class of\nthese models are early dark energy (EDE) cosmologies, where the dark energy\ncontribution does not vanish at early times.\n  Aims. Since structures grow slower in the presence of EDE, one expects an\nincrease in the number of galaxy clusters compared to LCDM at intermediate and\nhigh redshifts, which could explain the reported excess of the angular CMB\npower spectrum on cluster scales via an enhanced SZ contribution. We study the\nimpact of EDE on Planck's expected cluster sample.\n  Methods. To obtain realistic simulations, we constructed full-sky SZ maps for\nEDE and LCDM cosmologies, taking angular cluster correlation into account.\nUsing these maps, we simulated Planck observations with and without Galactic\nforegrounds and fed the results into our filter pipeline based on the spherical\nmulti-frequency matched filters.\n  Results. For the case of EDE cosmologies, we clearly find an increase in the\ndetected number of clusters compared to the fiducial LCDM case. This shows that\nthe spherical multi-frequency matched filter is sensitive enough to find\ndeviations from the LCDM sample, being caused by EDE. In addition we find an\ninteresting effect of EDE on the completeness of the cluster sample, such that\nEDE helps to obtain cleaner samples.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in A&A, minor language\n  corrections.
