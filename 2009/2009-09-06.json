The text of the book includes definition of geometrical object,\nconcept of reference frame, geometry of metric-affinne manifold. Using this\nconcept I learn few physical applications: dynamics and Lorentz transformation\nin gravitational fields, Doppler shift.\n  A reference frame in event space is a smooth field of orthonormal bases.\nEvery reference frame is equipped by anholonomic coordinates. Using anholonomic\ncoordinates allows to find out relative speed of two observers and appropriate\nLorentz transformation. Synchronization of a reference frame is an anholonomic\ntime coordinate. Simple calculations show how synchronization influences time\nmeasurement in the vicinity of the Earth. Measurement of Doppler shift from the\nstar orbiting the black hole helps to determine mass of the black hole.\n  We call a manifold with torsion and nonmetricity the metric\\hyph affine\nmanifold. The nonmetricity leads to a difference between the auto parallel line\nand the extreme line, and to a change in the expression of the Frenet transport\nand moving basis. The torsion leads to a change in the Killing equation. We\nalso need to add a similar equation for the connection.\n  The analysis of the Frenet transport leads to the concept of the Cartan\ntransport and an introduction of the connection compatible with the metric\ntensor. The dynamics of a particle follows to the Cartan transport. We need\nadditional physical constraints to make a nonmetricity observable. Learning how\ntorsion influences on tidal force reveals similarity between tidal equation for\ngeodesic and the Killing equation of second type.\n","Comment: English text - 85 pages; Russian text - 90 pages"]}]
