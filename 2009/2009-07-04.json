Starting from any initial guess, h(r) evolves (in a manner\ndictated by the spin hamiltonian under consideration) toward a steady-state\ndistribution representing an approximation to the true ground state. Unknown\ntransition coefficients in the master equation are treated as variational\nparameters. We illustrate the method by applying it to the J1-J2\nantiferromagnetic Heisenberg model. Without frustration (J2=0), the amplitudes\nare radially symmetric and fall off as 1/r^3 in the bond length. As the\nfrustration increases, there are precursor signs of columnar or plaquette VBS\norder: the bonds preferentially align along the axes of the square lattice and\nweight accrues in the nearest-neighbour bond amplitudes. The Marshall sign rule\nholds over a large range of couplings, J2/J1 < 0.418. It fails when the r=(2,1)\nbond amplitude first goes negative, a point also marked by a cusp in the ground\nstate energy. A nonrigourous extrapolation of the staggered magnetic moment\n(through this point of nonanalyticity) shows it vanishing continuously at a\ncritical value J2/J1 = 0.447. This may be preempted by a first-order transition\nto a state of broken translational symmetry.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 7 figures"]}]
