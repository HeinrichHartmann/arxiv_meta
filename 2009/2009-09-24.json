The successive evolution of\nquasar luminosities follows a universal light curve form: an initial\nexponential growth at constant Eddington ratio of order unity until it reaches\nthe peak luminosity, followed by a power-law decay. Assuming that the peak\nluminosity correlates with the post-merger halo mass, we convolve the light\ncurve with the triggering rate of quasar activity to predict the quasar\nluminosity function (LF). Our model reproduces the observed LF at 0.5<z<4.5 for\nthe full luminosity ranges probed by current optical and X-ray surveys. Our\nmodel reproduces both the observed redshift evolution and luminosity dependence\nof the linear bias of quasar/AGN clustering. Due to the scatter between\ninstantaneous luminosity and halo mass, quasar/AGN clustering weakly depends on\nluminosity at low to intermediate luminosities; but the linear bias rises\nrapidly with luminosity at the high luminosity end and at high redshift. In our\nmodel, the Eddington ratio distribution is roughly log-normal, which broadens\nand shifts to lower mean values from high luminosity quasars (L_bol>~10^46 erg\ns^-1) to low luminosity AGNs (L_bol<~ 10^45 erg s^-1), in good agreement with\nobservations.\n","Comment: Matched to the accepted version; ApJ in press"]}]

First, we study the multiple-input\nsingle-output (MISO) finite state compound broadcast channel (BC) with\narbitrary number of users and antennas at the transmitter. In prior work,\nWeingarten et. al. have found inner and outer bounds on the DoF with 2 users.\nThe bounds have a different character. While the inner bound collapses to unity\nas the number of states increases, the outer bound does not diminish with the\nincreasing number of states beyond a threshold value. It has been conjectured\nthat the outer bound is loose and the inner bound represents the actual DoF. In\nthe complex setting (all signals, noise, and channel coefficients are complex\nvariables) we solve a few cases to find that the outer bound -and not the inner\nbound- of Weingarten et. al. is tight. For the real setting (all signals, noise\nand channel coefficients are real variables) we completely characterize the\nDoF, once again proving that the outer bound of Weingarten et. al. is tight. We\nalso extend the results to arbitrary number of users. Second, we characterize\nthe DoF of finite state scalar (single antenna nodes) compound X networks with\narbitrary number of users in the real setting. Third, we characterize the DoF\nof finite state scalar compound interference networks with arbitrary number of\nusers in both the real and complex setting. The key finding is that scalar\ninterference networks and (real) X networks do not lose any DoF due to channel\nuncertainty at the transmitter in the finite state compound setting. The finite\nstate compound MISO BC does lose DoF relative to the perfect CSIT scenario.\nHowever, what is lost is only the DoF benefit of joint processing at transmit\nantennas, without which the MISO BC reduces to an X network.\n"]}]
