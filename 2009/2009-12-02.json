Even though samples are\ngrowing at redshifts z = 3 - 6, the nature of these galaxies is still poorly\nknown. Aims: To study the properties of z = 2.25 LAEs and compare those with\nthe properties of z > 3 LAEs. Methods: We present narrow-band imaging made with\nthe MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope with the WFI detector. We have made a selection for\nemission-line objects and find 170 candidate typical LAEs and 17 candidates\nwhich we regard as high UV-transmission LAEs. We have derived the magnitudes of\nthese objects in 8 bands from u* to Ks, and studied if they have X-ray and/or\nradio counterparts. Results: We show that there has been significant evolution\nin the properties of LAEs between redshift z ~ 3 and z = 2.25. The spread in\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) at the lower redshift is larger and we\ndetect a significant AGN contribution in the sample. The distribution of the\nequivalent widths is narrower than at z ~ 3, with only a few candidates with\nrest-frame equivalent width above the predicted limit of 240 A. The star\nformation rates derived from the Ly-alpha emission compared to that derived\nfrom the UV emission are lower by on average a factor of ~ 1.8, indicating a\nlarge absorption of dust. Conclusion: LAEs at redshift z = 2.25 may be more\nevolved than LAEs at higher redshift. The red SEDs imply more massive, older\nand/or more dusty galaxies at lower redshift than observed at higher redshifts.\nThe decrease in equivalent widths and star formation rates indicate more\nquiescent galaxies, with in general less star formation than in higher redshift\ngalaxies. At z = 2.25, AGN appear to be more abundant and also to contribute\nmore to the LAE population.

This is an important issue since random\ninstances are a good model for hard instances that can not be solved by current\nclassical solvers, for which an efficient quantum algorithm would therefore be\ndesirable. Here, we will show that because of a phenomenon similar to Anderson\nlocalization, an exponentially small eigenvalue gap appears in the spectrum of\nthe adiabatic Hamiltonian for large random instances, very close to the end of\nthe algorithm. This implies that unfortunately, adiabatic quantum optimization\nalso fails for these instances by getting stuck in a local minimum, unless the\ncomputation is exponentially long.\n","Comment: 34 pages, 5 color figures.

Null\npoints appear as the reconnection begins and persist throughout the rest of the\nemergence, where they can be found mostly in the model photosphere and\ntransition region, forming two loose clusters on either side of the emerging\nflux tube.

In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap in the literature\nby analyzing the behavior of $k$-means on well-clustered data. In particular,\nwe study the case when each cluster is distributed as a different Gaussian --\nor, in other words, when the input comes from a mixture of Gaussians.\n  We analyze three aspects of the $k$-means algorithm under this assumption.\nFirst, we show that when the input comes from a mixture of two spherical\nGaussians, a variant of the 2-means algorithm successfully isolates the\nsubspace containing the means of the mixture components. Second, we show an\nexact expression for the convergence of our variant of the 2-means algorithm,\nwhen the input is a very large number of samples from a mixture of spherical\nGaussians. Our analysis does not require any lower bound on the separation\nbetween the mixture components.\n  Finally, we study the sample requirement of $k$-means; for a mixture of 2\nspherical Gaussians, we show an upper bound on the number of samples required\nby a variant of 2-means to get close to the true solution. The sample\nrequirement grows with increasing dimensionality of the data, and decreasing\nseparation between the means of the Gaussians. To match our upper bound, we\nshow an information-theoretic lower bound on any algorithm that learns mixtures\nof two spherical Gaussians; our lower bound indicates that in the case when the\noverlap between the probability masses of the two distributions is small, the\nsample requirement of $k$-means is {\\em near-optimal}.\n"]}]

The\nproposed scheme is given both in a centralized as well as in a decentralized\napproach. In the centralized approach, the cluster head controls and adapts the\ndistribution of the cluster sensing nodes according to the monitored spectrum\nstate. While in the decentralized approach, each of the cluster nodes decides\nwhich spectrum it should monitor, according to the past local sensing decisions\nof the cluster nodes. The centralized and decentralized schemes can be combined\nto achieve a more robust cooperative spectrum sensing scheme. The proposed\nscheme performance is evaluated through a framework, which allows measuring the\naccuracy of the spectrum sensing cooperative scheme by measuring the error in\nthe estimation of the monitored spectrum state.

Recall that here H\nis said to be an (r, cr, p, q)-sensitive hash family if all pairs x, y in\n{0,1}^d with dist(x,y) at most r have probability at least p of collision under\na randomly chosen h in H, whereas all pairs x, y in {0,1}^d with dist(x,y) at\nleast cr have probability at most q of collision. Typically, one considers d\ntending to infinity, with c fixed and q bounded away from 0.\n  For its applications to approximate nearest neighbor search in high\ndimensions, the quality of an LSH family H is governed by how small its \"rho\nparameter\" rho = ln(1/p)/ln(1/q) is as a function of the parameter c. The\nseminal paper of Indyk and Motwani showed that for each c, the extremely simple\nfamily H = {x -> x_i : i in d} achieves rho at most 1/c.
