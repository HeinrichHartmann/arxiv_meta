We show that if $k= \\lceil n^d \\rceil$ for any fixed real d>0, then the\nproblem is NP-hard, meaning that no polynomial-time algorithm in n exists\nprovided that P is not NP, a widely believed conjecture in computer science. On\nthe other hand, when k is a constant independent of n, then it is known that\nthe problem may be solved in polynomial time in n. Using these results and the\nmethod of measurable switching rules, we prove our main statement: verifying\nthe absolute asymptotic stability of a continuous-time switched linear system\nwith more than n^d matrices A_i in R^{n x n} satisfying 0 >= A_i + A_i^{T} is\nNP-hard.\n","Comment: journal version"]}]
