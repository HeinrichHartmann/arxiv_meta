Then we study $S^1$-bundles and $S^1$-gerbes over differentiable\nstacks. In particular, we establish the relationship between $S^1$-gerbes and\ngroupoid $S^1$-central extensions. We define connections and curvings for\ngroupoid $S^1$-central extensions extending the corresponding notions of\nBrylinski, Hitchin and Murray for\n  $S^1$-gerbes over manifolds. We develop a Chern-Weil theory of characteristic\nclasses in this general setting by presenting a construction of Chern classes\nand Dixmier-Douady classes in terms of analogues of connections and curvatures.\nWe also describe a prequantization result for both $S^1$-bundles and\n$S^1$-gerbes extending the well-known result of Weil and Kostant. In\nparticular, we give an explicit construction of $S^1$-central extensions with\nprescribed curvature-like data.\n","Comment: 48 pages, minor revision, examples added, references added and\n  updated"]}]
