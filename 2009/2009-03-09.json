We also present a preliminary determination of the galaxy-mass\ncorrelation function finding a correlation length similar to the galaxy\nautocorrelation function and consistency with a low matter density universe\nwith modest bias. The full SDSS will cover an area 44 times larger and provide\nspectroscopic redshifts for the foreground galaxies, making it possible to\ngreatly improve the precision of these constraints, measure additional\nparameters such as halo shape, and measure the properties of dark matter halos\nseparately for many different classes of galaxies.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 11 figures, submitted to AJ"]}]
