In contrast, this ratio should decrease according to the standard\nscenario, in which CR positrons are secondaries formed by hadronic interactions\nbetween the primary CR protons and the interstellar medium (ISM). The positron\nexcess is therefore interpreted as evidence for either an annihilation/decay of\nweakly interacting massive particles, or for a direct astrophysical source of\npairs. The common feature of all proposed models is that they invoke new\nphysics or new astrophysical sources. However, this line of argumentation\nrelies implicitly on the assumption of a relatively homogeneous CR source\ndistribution. Inhomogeneity of CR sources on a scale of order a kpc, can\nnaturally explain this anomaly. If the nearest major CR source is about a kpc\naway, then low energy electrons (~GeV) can easily reach us. At higher energies\n(> 10 GeV), the source electrons cool via synchrotron and inverse-Compton\nbefore reaching the solar vicinity. Pairs formed in the local vicinity through\nthe proton/ISM interactions can reach the solar system also at high energies,\nthus increasing the positron/electron ratio. A natural origin of source\ninhomogeneity is the strong concentration of supernovae to the galactic spiral\narms.
