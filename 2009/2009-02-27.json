A standard way of probing such heterogeneities is by\nmonitoring the fluctuations of correlation and susceptibility, coarse-grained\nover mesoscopic regions. We discuss how to define fluctuating coarse-grained\ncorrelations (C) and susceptibilities (Chi) in models where no quenched\ndisorder is present. Our focus for the spherical model is on coarse-graining\nover the whole volume of $N$ spins, which requires accounting for N^{-1/2}\nnon-Gaussian fluctuations of the spin. The latter are treated as a perturbation\nabout the leading order Gaussian statistics. We obtain exact results for these\nquantities, which enable us to characterise the joint distribution of C and Chi\nfluctuations. We find that this distribution is qualitatively different, even\nfor equilibrium above criticality, from the spin-glass scenario where C and Chi\nfluctuations are linked in a manner akin to the fluctuation-dissipation\nrelation between the average C and Chi. Our results show that coarsening at\ncriticality is clearly heterogeneous for d>4 and suggest that, as in other\nglassy systems, there is a well-defined timescale on which fluctuations across\nthermal histories are largest. Surprisingly, however, neither this timescale\nnor the amplitude of the heterogeneities increase with the age of the system,\nas would be expected from the growing correlation length. For d<4, the strength\nof the fluctuations varies on a timescale proportional to the age of the\nsystem; the corresponding amplitude also grows with age, but does not scale\nwith the correlation volume as might have been expected naively.\n","Comment: 39 pages, 9 figures, version for publication in J.
