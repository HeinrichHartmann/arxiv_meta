In this paper, we examine the\ncosmological expansion in terms of observer-dependent coordinates, in addition\nto the more conventional co-moving coordinates. This procedure explicitly\nreveals the role played by the radius R_h of our cosmic horizon in the\ninterrogation of the data.

The mixing between Frenkel excitons (FEs) and\ncharge-transfer excitons (CTEs) is very essential for the excitonic and\nvibronic spectra of both crystals.

The basic Hamiltonian\ndescribes the FE--CTEs mixing in the molecular stack (point group $C_i$) caused\nby two transfer mechanisms, notably of the electron and the hole on the\nneighbor molecules. The vibronic spectra consist of mixed excitons and one\nvibrational mode of an intramolecular vibration linearly coupled with FE and\nCTEs. Using the vibronic approach, we calculate the linear optical\nsusceptibility in the excitonic and one-phonon vibronic regions of the\nmolecular stack, as well as of a crystal which contains two types of\nnonequivalent stacks.

The starting point is the five loop\nperturbative expansion of the effective potential (or free energy) in the\nframework of renormalized $\\phi^4_3$ field theory. The 3D perturbative\nexpansion is summed, using a Borel transformation and a mapping based on large\norder behaviour results. It is known that the equation of state has parametric\nrepresentations which incorporate in a simple way its scaling and regularity\nproperties. We show that such a representation can be used to accurately\ndetermine it from the knowledge of the few first coefficients of the expansion\nfor small magnetization. Revised values of amplitude ratios are deduced.\nFinally we compare the 3D values with the results obtained by the same method\nfrom the $\\epsilon=4-d$ expansion.\n","Comment: TeX file, 4 eps figures included, all macros included.

As an independent way to check the reliability of the\nclassification, we propose a statistical approach to test if two sets of\nprotein domain sequences coming from two families of the Pfam database are\nsignificantly different. We model protein sequences as realizations of Variable\nLength Markov Chains (VLMC) and we use the context trees as a signature of each\nprotein family. Our approach is based on a Kolmogorov--Smirnov-type\ngoodness-of-fit test proposed by Balding et al. [Limit theorems for sequences\nof random trees (2008), DOI: 10.1007/s11749-008-0092-z]. The test statistic is\na supremum over the space of trees of a function of the two samples; its\ncomputation grows, in principle, exponentially fast with the maximal number of\nnodes of the potential trees. We show how to transform this problem into a\nmax-flow over a related graph which can be solved using a Ford--Fulkerson\nalgorithm in polynomial time on that number. We apply the test to 10 randomly\nchosen protein domain families from the seed of Pfam-A database (high quality,\nmanually curated families). The test shows that the distributions of context\ntrees coming from different families are significantly different. We emphasize\nthat this is a novel mathematical approach to validate the automatic clustering\nof sequences in any context. We also study the performance of the test via\nsimulations on Galton--Watson related processes.\n","Comment: Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/08-AOAS218 the Annals of\n  Applied Statistics (http://www.imstat.org/aoas/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)"]}]
