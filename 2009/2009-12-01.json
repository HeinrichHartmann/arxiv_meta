The total density of states\nconsists of several pronounced peaks, the number of which in the negative\nenergy range coincides with the number of electrons M_e per lattice site, as\nfor the case of electron-solid phases in the conventional two-dimensional\nelectron gas. Analyzing the local density of states at the peak energies, we\nfind particular scaling properties of the density patterns if one fixes the\nratio nu_N/M_e between the filling factor nu_N of the last partially filled\nLandau level and the number of electrons per bubble. Although the total density\nprofile depends explicitly on M_e, the local density of states of the lowest\npeaks turns out to be identical regardless the number of electrons M_e. Whereas\nthese electron-solid phases are reminiscent to those expected in the\nconventional two-dimensional electron gas in GaAs heterostructures in the\nquantum Hall regime, the local density of states and the scaling relations we\nhighlight in this paper may be, in graphene, directly measured by spectroscopic\nmeans, such as e.g. scanning tunneling microscopy.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 7 figures; minor corrections"]}]

Here we introduce a means to realize a highly efficient\nsolid state source of indistinguishable single photons using cavity-assisted\nadiabatic Raman passage in a single quantum dot - cavity system.

In this paper we\nstudy this trade-off in private Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning. We\npresent two efficient mechanisms, one for the case of finite-dimensional\nfeature mappings and one for potentially infinite-dimensional feature mappings\nwith translation-invariant kernels. For the case of translation-invariant\nkernels, the proposed mechanism minimizes regularized empirical risk in a\nrandom Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space whose kernel uniformly approximates the\ndesired kernel with high probability. This technique, borrowed from large-scale\nlearning, allows the mechanism to respond with a finite encoding of the\nclassifier, even when the function class is of infinite VC dimension.\nDifferential privacy is established using a proof technique from algorithmic\nstability. Utility--the mechanism's response function is pointwise\nepsilon-close to non-private SVM with probability 1-delta--is proven by\nappealing to the smoothness of regularized empirical risk minimization with\nrespect to small perturbations to the feature mapping. We conclude with a lower\nbound on the optimal differential privacy of the SVM.

The resulting\neffective theory is a one-dimensional N=2 super-mechanics model that exhibits\npeculiar features of one-dimensional supersymmetry, such as the appearance of\nfermion-only super-multiplets. The latter necessitates reducing also the\nfermionic sector of M-theory, which is not normally included in the\ncompactification literature and is thus presented, together with the required\ntechnology, in detail. The one-dimensional effective theory is most elegantly\ndescribed in superspace and therefore, a detailed account of one-dimensional\nflat and curved N=2 superspace is provided. This includes developing the theory\nof fermionic multiplets and the study of cross-couplings between 2a and 2b\nmultiplets. Another important aspect is the inclusion of flux. We study its\nconsistency conditions, its relation to supersymmetry and the way it gives rise\nto a potential in the one-dimensional effective action. It is also explained\nhow the supersymmetry-preserving part of the potential can be obtained from a\nGukov-type superpotential. The main motivation of this compactification\nscenario is rooted in the realm of cosmology. Its virtue is a democratic\ntreatment of spatial dimensions. As opposed to the artificial 3+7 split in most\nstring compactifications, the early universe starts out with all spatial\ndimensions compact and small in our approach. One then seeks for dynamical ways\nin which three dimensions grow large at late times. Possible realisations of\nthis idea are discussed both at the classical and at the quantum level.\nFinally, preliminary work on Calabi-Yau five-fold compactifications of F-theory\nand the resulting two-dimensional string-like actions is presented.\n","Comment: 177 pages, PhD thesis"]}]
