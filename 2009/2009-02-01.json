The\npurpose of this paper is to continue the structure theory of finite dimensional\nquasi-Hopf algebras started in math.QA/0310253 (p=2) and math.QA/0402159 (p>2).\nMore specifically, we completely describe the class RG(p) for p>2. Namely, we\nshow that if H\\in RG(p) has a nontrivial associator, then the rank of H[1] over\nH[0] is \\le 1. This yields the following classification of H\\in RG(p), p>2, up\nto twist equivalence: (a) Duals of pointed Hopf algebras with p grouplike\nelements, classified in math.QA/9806074. (b) Group algebra of Z_p with\nassociator defined by a 3-cocycle. (c) The algebras A(q), introduced in\nmath.QA/0402159. This result implies, in particular, that if p>2 is a prime\nthen any finite tensor category over C with exactly p simple objects which are\nall invertible must have Frobenius-Perron dimension p^N, N=1,2,3,4,5 or 7. In\nthe second half of the paper we construct new examples of finite dimensional\nquasi-Hopf algebras H, which are not twist equivalent to a Hopf algebra. They\nare radically graded, and H/Rad(H)=C[Z_n^m], with a nontrivial associator. For\ninstance, to every finite dimensional simple Lie algebra g and an odd integer\nn, coprime to 3 if g=G_2, we attach a quasi-Hopf algebra of dimension\nn^{dim(g)}.\n","Comment: Latex; 8 pages"]}]
