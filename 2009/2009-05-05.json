It consists of correlating the lensing\nsignal (either shear or magnification) of a background galaxy/quasar sample\nwith the number density of a foreground galaxy sample. However, the foreground\ngalaxy density is inevitably altered by the magnification bias due to the mass\nbetween the foreground and the observer, leading to a correction to the\nobserved galaxy-lensing signal. The aim of this paper is to quantify this\ncorrection. The single most important determining factor is the foreground\nredshift z: the correction is small if the foreground galaxies are at low\nredshifts but can become non-negligible for sufficiently high redshifts. For\ninstance, we find that for the multipole l=1000, the correction is above\n1%*(5s-2)/b for z<0.37, and above 5%*(5s-2)/b for z<0.67, where s is the number\ncount slope of the foreground sample, and b its galaxy bias. These\nconsiderations are particularly important for geometrical measures, such as the\nJain and Taylor ratio or its generalization by Zhang et al. Assuming\n(5s-2)/b=1, we find that the foreground redshift should be limited to z<0.45 in\norder to avoid biasing the inferred dark energy equation of state w by more\nthan 5%, and that even for a low foreground redshift (< 0.45), the background\nsamples must be well separated from the foreground to avoid incurring a bias of\nsimilar magnitude. Lastly, we briefly comment on the possibility of obtaining\nthese geometrical measures without using galaxy shapes, using instead\nmagnification bias itself.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 7 figures; v2: minor revisions, as accepted for publication\n  in Physical Review D"]}]

However, the evolution of the core magnetic field is\nsubstantially different for a binary neutron star. While for a single neutron\nstar the fluxoids of the proton superconductor always move outward through the\ncore, in a binary neutron star in the accretion phase fluxoids move back into\nthe core.

From\nthe measured average FRET efficiency, <E>, the distance distribution P(R) is\ninferred by assuming that the DSE can be described as a polymer. The single\nparameter in the appropriate polymer model (Gaussian chain, Wormlike chain, or\nSelf-avoiding walk) for P(R) is determined by equating the calculated and\nmeasured <E>. In order to assess the accuracy of this \"standard procedure,\" we\nconsider the generalized Rouse model (GRM), whose properties [<E> and P(R)] can\nbe analytically computed, and the Molecular Transfer Model for protein L for\nwhich accurate simulations can be carried out as a function of guanadinium\nhydrochloride (GdmCl) concentration. Using the precisely computed <E> for the\nGRM and protein L, we infer P(R) using the standard procedure. We find that the\nmean end-to-end distance can be accurately inferred (less than 10% relative\nerror) using <E> and polymer models for P(R). However, the value extracted for\nthe radius of gyration (Rg) and the persistence length (lp) are less accurate.\nThe relative error in the inferred R-g and lp, with respect to the exact\nvalues, can be as large as 25% at the highest GdmCl concentration. We propose a\nself-consistency test, requiring measurements of <E> by attaching dyes to\ndifferent residues in the protein, to assess the validity of describing DSE\nusing the Gaussian model. Application of the self-consistency test to the GRM\nshows that even for this simple model the Gaussian P(R) is inadequate. Analysis\nof experimental data of FRET efficiencies for the cold shock protein shows that\nat there are significant deviations in the DSE P(R) from the Gaussian model.\n","Comment: 31 pages, 9 figures"]}]

This model is quite simple and can be treated\nanalytically since the buyers evaluate the quality of a certain good taking\ninto account only the quality of the last good purchased plus her perceptive\ncapacity \\beta . As a consequence the system evolves according to a stationary\nMarkovian stochastic process. The value of a product offered by the seller\nincreases with quality according to the exponent \\alpha, which is a measure of\ntechnology. It incorporates all the technological capacity of production\nsystems such as education, scientific development and techniques that change\nthe productivity growth. The technological level plays an important role to\nexplain how the asymmetry of information may affect the market evolution in\nthis model. We observe that, for high technological levels, the market can\ncontrol adverse selection. The model allows us to compute the maximum\nasymmetric information degree before market collapse. Below this critical point\nthe market evolves during a very limited time and then dies out completely.\nWhen \\beta is closer to 1(symmetric information), the market becomes more\nprofitable for high quality goods, although high and low quality markets\ncoexist. All the results we obtained from the model are analytical and the\nmaximum asymmetric information level is a consequence of an ergodicity\nbreakdown in the process of quality evaluation.\n","Comment: 13 pages and 4 figures"]}]
