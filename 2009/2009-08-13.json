We find the fully relativistic motion of a\nprobe Dp'-brane in the presence of source Dp-branes is integrable by\nquadratures. Keplerian conic sections are obtained for special choices for p\nand p' and the systems are shown to be equivalent to nonrelativistic systems.\nTheir quantum behaviour is also equivalent to the corresponding\nnon-relativistic limit. In particular the p=6, p'=0 case is equivalent to a\nnon-relativistic dyon in a magnetic monopole background, with the trajectories\nin the surface of a cone. We also show that the motion of the probe branes\nabout D6-branes in IIA theory is equivalent to the motion of the corresponding\nprobes in the uplift to M-theory in 11 dimensions, for which there are no\nD6-branes but their fields are replaced by a particular Taub-NUT geometry.
