It is very important to note that the scale of the planned\ndetector is such that even for accelerator neutrino detection (which allows one\nto use the accelerator duty factor to eliminate cosmics) a minimum depth is\nneeded to reduce risk of contamination from cosmic rays. After consideration of\nthe science and the practical issues regarding the Homestake site, we strongly\nrecommend that the geotechnical studies be commenced at the 4850ft level in a\ntimely manner.\n","Comment: 64 pages, prepared to be part of the DUSEL design reviews 8/9/2009\n  corrected author list, removed extra file"]}]

Comparison to the predictions of Milgrom's\nmodified dynamics (MOND) provide a best-fit and experimentally determined\nuniversal value of the MOND acceleration parameter. The predictions of the\nmodified gravity theories are compared to the predictions of cold non-baryonic\ndark matter (CDM), including a constant density core-modified fitting formula,\nwhich produces excellent fits to galaxy rotation curves including the low\nsurface brightness and dwarf galaxies.\n  Upon analysing the mass profiles of clusters of galaxies inferred from X-ray\nluminosity measurements, from the smallest nearby clusters to the largest of\nthe clusters of galaxies, it is shown that while MOG provides consistent fits,\nMOND does not fit the observed shape of cluster mass profiles for any value of\nthe MOND acceleration parameter. Comparison to the predictions of CDM confirm\nthat whereas the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) fitting formula does not fit the\nobserved shape of galaxy cluster mass profiles, the core-modified dark matter\nfitting formula provides excellent best-fits, supporting the hypothesis that\nbaryons are dynamically important in the distribution of dark matter halos.\n","Comment: Ph.D. Thesis. 251 pages, 22 figures, 17 tables"]}]

Matter made of solutions of Lorentz-invariant\nequations would feel a relativistic space-time even if the actual space-time\nhad a quite different geometry (i.e. a galilean space-time). A typical example\nis provided by sine-Gordon solitons in a galilean world. A \"sub-world\"\nrestricted to such solitons would be \"relativistic\", with the critical speed of\nsolitons playing the role of the speed of light. Only the study of the deep\nstructure of matter will unravel the actual geometry of space and time, which\nwe expect to be scale-dependent and determined by the properties of matter\nitself. If Lorentz invariance is a property of equations describing a sector of\nmatter at a given scale, an absolute frame (the \"vacuum rest frame\") may exist\nwithout contradicting the minkowskian sctructure of the space-time felt by\nordinary particles. But c, the speed of light, will not necessarily be the only\ncritical speed in vacuum: for instance, a superluminal sector of matter may\nexist related to new degrees of freedom not yet discovered experimentally. Such\nparticles would not be tachyons: they may feel a different minkowskian\nspace-time with a critical speed larger than c and behave kinematically like\nordinary particles apart from the difference in critical speed. At speed larger\nthan c , they are expected to release \"Cherenkov\" radiation (ordinary\nparticles) in vacuum. We present a discussion of possible physical (theoretical\nexperimental) and cosmological implications of such a scenario, assuming that\nthe superluminal sector couples weakly to ordinary matter.\n","Comment: 6 pages, E-mail gonzalez@lapphp.in2p3.fr , lgonzalz@vxcern.cern.ch"]}]
