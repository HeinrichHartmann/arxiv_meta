For an arbitrary\nfinite-energy signal the frequency localization is performed by a prefilter\nrealizing a crosscorrelation with a function of prescribed properties. The\nrange of the filter, the so-called localization space, is described in some\ndetail. Regular sampling is applied and a reconstruction formula is given.
