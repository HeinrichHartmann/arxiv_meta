For an understanding of the model structure and the\nmechanism(s) of symmetry breaking, it is important to know the masses of the\nnew particles precisely. In this article the measurement of the mass of the\nscalar partner of the top quark (stop) at an e+e- collider is studied. A\nrelatively light stop is motivated by attempts to explain electroweak\nbaryogenesis and can play an important role in dark matter relic density. A\nmethod is presented which makes use of cross-section measurements near the\npair-production threshold as well as at higher center-of-mass energies. It is\nshown that this method not only increases the statistical precision, but also\ngreatly reduces the systematic uncertainties, which can be important. Numerical\nresults are presented, based on a realistic event simulation, for two signal\nselection strategies: using conventional selection cuts, and using an Iterative\nDiscriminant Analysis (IDA). Our studies indicate that a precision of\n$\\Delta\\mstop = 0.42$ GeV can be achieved, representing a major improvement\nover previous studies. While the analysis of stops is particularly challenging\ndue to the possibility of stop hadronization, the general procedure could be\napplied to the mass measurement of other particles as well. We also comment on\nthe potential of the IDA to discover a stop quark in this scenario, and we\nrevisit the accuracy of the theoretical predictions for the neutralino relic\ndensity\n","Comment: 41 pages, 14 figures, in JHEP format"]}]

It is done just by taking a constant-bounded number of random\nvertex samplings only one time (thus, iteration-free). It is independent from\nthe definition of quasi-randomness and yields a new elementary proof of a\nstrong hypergraph regularity lemma. Consequently, as an example of its\napplications, we have a new self-contained proof of Szemer\\'edi's classic\ntheorem on arithmetic progressions (1975) as well as its multidimensional\nextension by Furstenberg-Katznelson (1978).\n","Comment: 16 pages"]}]

This paper proves a reduction theorem which\nstates that the canonical variables on the Lie group can be eliminated, if and\nonly if the velocity map is a Lie algebra action, thereby producing the\nEuler-Poincar\\'e (EP) equation for the vector space variables. In this case,\nthe map from the canonical variables on the Lie group to the vector space is\nthe standard momentum map defined using the diamond operator. We apply the\nClebsch method in examples of the rotating rigid body and the incompressible\nEuler equations. Along the way, we explain how singular solutions of the EP\nequation for the diffeomorphism group (EPDiff) arise as momentum maps in the\nClebsch approach. In the case of finite dimensional Lie groups, the Clebsch\nvariational principle is discretised to produce a variational integrator for\nthe dynamical system. We obtain a discrete map from which the variables on the\ncotangent bundle of a Lie group may be eliminated to produce a discrete EP\nequation for elements of the vector space. We give an integrator for the\nrotating rigid body as an example. We also briefly discuss how to discretise\ninfinite-dimensional Clebsch systems, so as to produce conservative numerical\nmethods for fluid dynamics.\n"]}]
