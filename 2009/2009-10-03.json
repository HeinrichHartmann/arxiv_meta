Among other things, our result implies that the\nvariant of the unique games conjecture where we allow the provers to share\nentanglement is false. Our proof is based on a novel `quantum rounding\ntechnique', showing how to take a solution to an SDP and transform it to a\nstrategy for entangled provers.
