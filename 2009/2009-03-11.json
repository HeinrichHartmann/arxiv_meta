Adaptation comes from\nlearning and the information for the learning process comes from interacting\nwith other neighboring agents and trying to change the internal state in order\nto concur with their opinions. The change in the internal state is driven by\nthe information contained in the issue and in the opinion of the other agent.\nWe present results in a simple yet rich context where each agent uses a Boolean\nPerceptron to state its opinion.

The\ncurious result is that it is learning from those that hold the same opinions\nthat drives the emergence of factions. This results follows from the fact that\nfactions are prevented by not learning at all from those agents that hold the\nsame opinion.

A striking molecular realization of this\nself-assembly, using DNA tiles a few nanometers long and verifying the results\nby atomic-force microscopy, was achieved by Rothemund, Papadakis, and Winfree\n(2004). Precisely speaking, the above self-assemblies tile completely\nfilled-in, two-dimensional regions of the plane, with labeled subsets of these\ntiles representing discrete Sierpinski triangles. This paper addresses the more\nchallenging problem of the strict self-assembly of discrete Sierpinski\ntriangles, i.e., the task of tiling a discrete Sierpinski triangle and nothing\nelse. We first prove that the standard discrete Sierpinski triangle cannot\nstrictly self-assemble in the Tile Assembly Model.

In contrast with the simple XOR algorithm of the earlier,\nnon-strict self-assemblies, our strict self-assembly algorithm makes extensive,\nrecursive use of optimal counters, coupled with measured delay and\ncorner-turning operations.
