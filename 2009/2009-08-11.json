This paper presents the\nfirst detailed analysis of a frontside, large-scale CME that has no obvious\ncounterparts in the low corona. The event was observed by the SECCHI\ninstruments. The COR2A coronagraph observed a slow flux-rope type CME, while an\nextremely faint partial halo was observed in COR2B. The event evolved very\nslowly and is typical of the streamer-blowout CME class. EUVI A 171 images show\na concave feature above the east limb, relatively stable for about two days\nbefore the eruption, when it rises into the coronagraphic fields and develops\ninto the core of the CME. None of the typical low corona signatures of a CME\nwere observed in the EUVI-B images, which we attribute to the unusually large\nheight from which the flux-rope lifted off. This interpretation is supported by\nthe CME mass measurements and estimates of the expected EUV dimming intensity.\nOnly thanks to the availability of the two viewpoints we were able to identify\nthe likely source region. The event originated along a neutral line over the\nquiet sun. No active regions were present anywhere on the visible (from STEREO\nB) face of the disk. Leaving no trace behind on the solar disk, this\nobservation shows unambiguously that a CME eruption does not need to have clear\non-disk signatures.\n","Comment: accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

First, because there are very elegant and\ndifficult questions in it. Second, because some of the greatest figures in\nmathematics so far had spent time working on problems in number theory. In\nparticular, Descartes spent time looking for (and finding) a pair of amicable\nnumbers that previously in Europe had been unknown. Euler also mentions the\nwork of Frans van Schooten. Then Euler explains the form of the amicable\nnumbers that were then known, which were $2^n xy$ and $2^n z$, where $x,y,z$\nare prime, and the two conditions i) $z=xy+x+y$ and ii) $2^n(x+y+2)=xy+x+y+1$\nare satisfied. Euler says that to find more amicable numbers different forms\nshould be tried. He gives 30 pairs of amicable numbers but does not explain how\nhe found them. This is discussed in Ed Sandifer's November 2005 \"How Euler did\nit\". One of the pairs (pair XIII) Euler lists is incorrect.\n","Comment: 3 pages; E100"]}]
