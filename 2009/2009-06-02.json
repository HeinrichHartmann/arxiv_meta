Often the responses are suspected to share a common underlying\nstructure, in which case it may be advantageous to share information across\nthem; this is known as multitask learning. As a special case, we can use\nmultiple responses to better identify shared predictive features -- a project\nwe might call multitask feature selection.\n  This thesis is organized as follows. Section 1 introduces feature selection\nfor regression, focusing on ell_0 regularization methods and their\ninterpretation within a Minimum Description Length (MDL) framework. Section 2\nproposes a novel extension of MDL feature selection to the multitask setting.\nThe approach, called the \"Multiple Inclusion Criterion\" (MIC), is designed to\nborrow information across regression tasks by more easily selecting features\nthat are associated with multiple responses. We show in experiments on\nsynthetic and real biological data sets that MIC can reduce prediction error in\nsettings where features are at least partially shared across responses. Section\n3 surveys hypothesis testing by regression with a single response, focusing on\nthe parallel between the standard Bonferroni correction and an MDL approach.\nMirroring the ideas in Section 2, Section 4 proposes a novel MIC approach to\nhypothesis testing with multiple responses and shows that on synthetic data\nwith significant sharing of features across responses, MIC sometimes\noutperforms standard FDR-controlling methods in terms of finding true positives\nfor a given level of false positives.

These classical models lend themselves to a simple\ninterpretation in which a single history (a single element of the sample space)\nis deemed to be 'real'; we require only that this real history should not be\nruled out by the dynamics, the axioms of which ensure that not all histories\nare precluded. However, applying this interpretation naively to quantum measure\ntheory we can find experimentally realisable systems (notably the\nPeres-Kochen-Specker system) in which every history is ruled out by the\ndynamics, challenging us to formulate a deeper realist framework.\n  Our first response is to hold on to our existing interpretative framework and\nattempt a revision of the dynamics that would reduce quantum measure theory to\na classical dynamics. We explore this approach by examining the histories\nformulation of a stochastic-collapse model on a simple (discrete) null-lattice,\nconcluding that the drawbacks of this approach outweigh the benefits.\n  Our second response is to abandon our classically inspired interpretation in\nfavour of Sorkin's 'co-events', a more general ontology that still allows for\nstrict realism. In this case the 'potentially real' objects of the theory (the\n'beables' in Bell's language) are not individual histories but truth valuation\nmaps, or co-events. We develop & evaluate various co-event schemes that have\nbeen suggested to date, finally adopting the multiplicative scheme; the current\nworking model of co-event theory and a promising interpretation of quantum\nmeasure theory, though still a work in progress. We conclude by exploring the\nexpression of the dynamics & predictions in this new framework.\n","Comment: Thesis, 155 pages"]}]
