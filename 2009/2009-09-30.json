Indeed, even in the situations where simple\nsingle-electron calculations predict a metallic dispersion, the system is\nunstable with respect to the deformation of the carbon-carbon bonds dangling at\nthe edges of the armchair nanoribbon. The edge bonds' deformation couples\nelectron and hole states with equal momentum. This coupling opens a gap at the\nFermi level. In a realistic sample, however, it is unlikely that this\ninstability could be observed in its pure form. Namely, since chemical\nproperties of the dangling carbon atoms are different from chemical properties\nof the atoms inside the sample (for example, the atoms at the edge have only\ntwo neighbours, besides additional non-carbon atoms might be attached to\npassivate unpaired covalent carbon bonds), it is very probable that the bonds\nat the edge are deformed due to chemical interactions. This chemically-induced\nmodification of the nanoribbon's edges can be viewed as an effective field\nbiasing our predicted instability in a particular direction. Yet by disordering\nthis field (e.g., through random substitution of the radicals attached to the\nedges) we may tune the system back to the critical regime and vary the\nelectronic properties of the system.

These parton distributions supersede the previously available \"MRST\"\nsets and should be used for the first LHC data-taking and for the associated\ntheoretical calculations. New data sets fitted include CCFR/NuTeV dimuon cross\nsections, which constrain the strange quark and antiquark distributions, and\nTevatron Run II data on inclusive jet production, the lepton charge asymmetry\nfrom W decays and the Z rapidity distribution. Uncertainties are propagated\nfrom the experimental errors on the fitted data points using a new dynamic\nprocedure for each eigenvector of the covariance matrix. We discuss the major\nchanges compared to previous MRST fits, briefly compare to parton distributions\nobtained by other fitting groups, and give predictions for the W and Z total\ncross sections at the Tevatron and LHC.\n","Comment: 157 pages, 70 figures.

On\nthe basis of the hierarchical structure of the codon levels two scenarios are\nclassified into two different routes of the evolutional process. In the case of\nthe ambiguous intermediate scenario we perform a simulation implemented cost\nselection of amino acids and confirm a rapid transition of the code change.\nSuch rapidness reduces uncomfortableness of the non-unique translation of the\ncode at intermediate state that is the weakness of the scenario.\n"]}]

Rather than first finding a set of trees which are optimal according\nto a phylogenetic criterion (e.g. likelihood or parsimony) and then attempting\nto fit them into a network, constNJ estimates the trees while enforcing\nspecified rSPR distance constraints. The primary input for constNJ is a\ncollection of distance matrices derived from sequence blocks which are assumed\nto have evolved in a tree-like manner, such as blocks of an alignment which do\nnot contain any recombination breakpoints. The other input is a set of rSPR\nconstraints for any set of pairs of trees.

The precise mechanism of this\nforeign-self-distinction, though one of the major tasks of the immune system,\ncontinues to be a fundamental puzzle. Recent progress has been made by van den\nBerg, Rand, and Burroughs (2001), who modelled the \\emph{probabilistic} nature\nof the interaction between the relevant cell types, namely, T-cells and\nantigen-presenting cells (APCs). Here, the stochasticity is due to the random\nsample of antigens present on the surface of every APC, and to the random\nreceptor type that characterises individual T-cells. It has been shown\npreviously that this model, though highly idealised, is capable of reproducing\nimportant aspects of the recognition phenomenon, and of explaining them on the\nbasis of stochastic rare events. These results were obtained with the help of a\nrefined large deviation theorem and were thus asymptotic in nature. Simulations\nhave, so far, been restricted to the straightforward simple sampling approach,\nwhich does not allow for sample sizes large enough to address more detailed\nquestions. Building on the available large deviation results, we develop an\nimportance sampling technique that allows for a convenient exploration of the\nrelevant tail events by means of simulation. With its help, we investigate the\nmechanism of statistical recognition in some depth. In particular, we\nillustrate how a foreign antigen can stand out against the self background if\nit is present in sufficiently many copies, although no \\emph{a priori}\ndifference between self and nonself is built into the model.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 14 figures; J.

Using H-1's unique combination of flexibility and\nadvanced diagnostics, RF-generated plasma in H-1 is shown to have a very\ncomplex dependence on configuration of both the electron density and\nfluctuations in the MHD Alfven range. Magnetic fluctuations range from highly\ncoherent, often multi-frequency, to approaching broad-band (df/f ~ 0.02-0.5),\nin the range 1-200 kHz. Application of datamining techniques to a wide range of\nconfigurations classifies these fluctuations and extracts poloidal and toroidal\nmode numbers, revealing that a significant class of fluctuations exhibit\nscaling which is i) Alfvenic with electron density (within a constant factor)\nand ii) shear Alfvenic in rotational transform. This is confirmed by scans\nwithin a single pulse, which can follow mode conversions. An array of optical\nand interferometric diagnostics is combined with the magnetic probe arrays to\nprovide initial information on the internal structure of the MHD modes, and\nassociated 3D effects. The configurational dependence is closely related to the\npresence of low order rational surfaces; density falls to very low values near,\nbut not precisely at these rational values. Results from a uniquely accurate\nmagnetic field mapping system, combined with a comprehensive model of the\nvacuum magnetic field in H-1 show that magnetic islands should not dominate the\nconfinement of the configuration, and indicate that the dependence of density\non configuration may be attributable to plasma generation effects.\n","Comment: Expanded form of paper Ex/P9-11 presented at the 22nd IAEA Fusion\n  Energy Conference, Geneva, Switzerland, 2008, and submitted to Nuclear Fusion\n  for Publication"]}]

The similar process was discussed in\narXiv:hep-ph/9905347v2. The TC2 model, as we discussed in the introduction part\nremedies some shortcomings and loophole of the old version. The top-Higgs in\nthe TC2 model is a mixture of the top-Higgs of the toptechnicolor model and\nthat of the ETC model, thus a parameter $\\epsilon$ is introduced to denote the\nmixture. Moreover, we vary the mass range of the top-Higgs within 300 to 800\nGeV while in arXiv:hep-ph/9905347v2, the mass range was taken as 200 to 400\nGeV.

This is analogous\nto the concept of an $A$-group: a finite group with the property that all of\nits Sylow subgroups are abelian. These groups were first studied in the 1940s\nby Philip Hall, and are still studied today. Rather less is known about\n$A$-algebras, though they have been studied and used by a number of authors.\nThe purpose of this paper is to obtain more detailed results on the structure\nof solvable Lie $A$-algebras. It is shown that they split over each term in\ntheir derived series. This leads to a decomposition of $L$ as $L = A_{n}\n\\dot{+} A_{n-1} \\dot{+} ... \\dot{+} A_0$ where $A_i$ is an abelian subalgebra\nof $L$ and $L^{(i)} = A_{n} \\dot{+} A_{n-1} \\dot{+} ... \\dot{+} A_{i}$ for each\n$0 \\leq i \\leq n$. It is shown that the ideals of $L$ relate nicely to this\ndecomposition: if $K$ is an ideal of $L$ then $K = (K \\cap A_n) \\dot{+} (K \\cap\nA_{n-1}) \\dot{+} ... \\dot{+} (K \\cap A_0)$. When $L^2$ is nilpotent we can\nlocate the position of the maximal nilpotent subalgebras: if $U$ is a maximal\nnilpotent subalgebra of $L$ then $U = (U \\cap L^2) \\oplus (U \\cap C)$ where $C$\nis a Cartan subalgebra of $L$. If $L$ has a unique minimal ideal $W$ then $N =\nZ_L(W)$. If, in addition, $L$ is strongly solvable the maximal nilpotent\nsubalgebras of $L$ are $L^2$ and the Cartan subalgebras of $L$ (that is, the\nsubalgebras that are complementary to $L^2$.) Necessary and sufficient\nconditions are given for such an algebra to be an $A$-algebra. Finally, more\ndetailed structure results are given when the underlying field is algebraically\nclosed.\n"]}]

As an application, we give a procedure to encode a triangulation of genus\n$g$ and $n$ vertices in $4n+O(g \\log(n))$ bits. This matches the worst-case\nencoding rate of Edgebreaker in positive genus. All the algorithms presented\nhere have execution time $O((n+g)g)$, hence are linear when the genus is fixed.\n","Comment: 27 pages, to appear in a special issue of Discrete and Computational\n  Geometry"]}]

In\nNature, this behaviour is known as random mating. However, non-random schemes -\nin which individuals mate according to their kinship or likeness - are more\ncommon in natural systems. Previous studies indicate that, when applied to GAs,\nnegative assortative mating (a specific type of non-random mating, also known\nas dissortative mating) may improve their performance (on both speed and\nreliability) in a wide range of problems. Dissortative mating maintains the\ngenetic diversity at a higher level during the run, and that fact is frequently\nobserved as an explanation for dissortative GAs ability to escape local optima\ntraps. Dynamic problems, due to their specificities, demand special care when\ntuning a GA, because diversity plays an even more crucial role than it does\nwhen tackling static ones. This paper investigates the behaviour of\ndissortative mating GAs, namely the recently proposed Adaptive Dissortative\nMating GA (ADMGA), on dynamic trap functions. ADMGA selects parents according\nto their Hamming distance, via a self-adjustable threshold value. The method,\nby keeping population diversity during the run, provides an effective means to\ndeal with dynamic problems. Tests conducted with deceptive and nearly deceptive\ntrap functions indicate that ADMGA is able to outperform other GAs, some\nspecifically designed for tracking moving extrema, on a wide range of tests,\nbeing particularly effective when speed of change is not very fast. When\ncomparing the algorithm to a previously proposed dissortative GA, results show\nthat performance is equivalent on the majority of the experiments, but ADMGA\nperforms better when solving the hardest instances of the test set.\n","Comment: Technical report complementing Carlos Fernandes' PhD"]}]

The\nmost critical part of the modeling process is to ensure geometric compatibility\nand a complete transfer of surface tractions between the different components\nat the connecting interfaces. Popular contact modeling techniques rely on\ngeometric projections to detect and resolve overlapping or mass\ninterpenetration between two or more contacting bodies. Such approaches have\nbeen shown to have two major drawbacks: they are not suitable for contact at\nhighly nonlinear surfaces and sharp corners where smooth normal projections are\nnot feasible, and they fail to guarantee a complete and accurate transfer of\npressure across the interface. This dissertation presents a novel formulation\nfor the modeling of contact problems that possesses the ability to resolve\ncomplicated contact scenarios effectively, while being simpler to implement and\nmore widely applicable than currently available methods. We show that the\nformulation boils down to a node-to-surface gap function that works effectively\nfor non-smooth contact.

The suppression is achieved by altering the\ndynamics of an imperfect quantum memory with the help of a sequence of local\nunitary operations applied to the qudits. Whereas up to now the operations of\nsuch decoupling sequences have been constructed in a deterministic fashion,\nstrategies are developed in this thesis which construct the operations by\nrandom selection from a suitable set. Furthermore, it is investigated if and\nhow the discussed decoupling strategies can be employed to protect a quantum\ncomputation running on the quantum memory.\n  The second part of the thesis deals with quantum error-correcting codes and\nprotocols for quantum key distribution. The focus is on the BB84 and the\n6-state protocol making use of only one-way communication during the error\ncorrection and privacy amplification steps. It is shown that by adding\nadditional errors to the preliminary key (a process called noisy preprocessing)\nfollowed by the use of a structured block code, higher secure key rates may be\nobtained. For the BB84 protocol it is shown that iterating the combined\npreprocessing leads to an even higher gain.\n","Comment: PhD thesis, 223 pages, TU Darmstadt;\n  http://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/1389/"]}]

This measurement is of primordial importance for the LHC\nexperimental program, both as a direct test of the charge sign independent\ncoupling of the W bosons to the fermions and as a mandatory preliminary step\ntowards the precision measurement of the charge averaged W boson mass. This\nlast pragmatic point can be understood since the LHC specific collisions will\nprovide unprecedented kinematics for the positive and negative channels while\nthe SPS and Tevatron collider produced W+ and W- on the same footing. For that\nreason, the study of the asymmetries between W+ and W- in Drell--Yan like\nprocesses (production of single W decaying into leptons), studied to extract\nthe properties of the W boson, is described thoroughly in this document. Then,\nthe prospect for a measurement of MW+ - MW- at the LHC is addressed in a\nperspective intending to decrease as much as possible the systematic errors\nthat will inevitably comes from the misunderstanding of both phenomenological\nand apparatus modeling. For that matter strategies have been devised\nspecifically for the present measurement to display robustness with respect to\nthe main uncertainties.

The multiple temperature model is a\nnatural generalization of Winfree's abstract tile assembly model, where the\ntemperature of a tile system is allowed to be shifted up and down as\nself-assembly proceeds. We first exhibit two constant-size tile sets in which\nscaled-up versions of arbitrary shapes self-assemble. Our first tile set has\nthe property that each scaled shape self-assembles via an asymptotically\n\"Kolmogorov-optimum\" temperature sequence but the scaling factor grows with the\nsize of the shape being assembled.

The low-energy electronic states of graphene have two\nnon-equivalent massless Dirac spectrum. The relative distance between these two\nDirac points in the momentum space and edge states due to the existence of the\nzigzag type graphene edges are decisive to the electronic and transport\nproperties of graphene nanoribbons. In graphene nanoribbons with zigzag edges,\ntwo valleys related to each Dirac spectrum are well separated in momentum\nspace. The propagating modes in each valley contain a single chiral mode\noriginating from a partially flat band at band center. This feature gives rise\nto a perfectly conducting channel in the disordered system, if the impurity\nscattering does not connect the two valleys, i.e. for long-range impurity\npotentials. On the other hand, the low-energy spectrum of graphene nanoribbons\nwith armchair edges is described as the superposition of two non-equivalent\nDirac points of graphene. In spite of the lack of well-separated two valley\nstructures, the single-channel transport subjected to long-ranged impurities is\nnearly perfectly conducting, where the backward scattering matrix elements in\nthe lowest order vanish as a manifestation of internal phase structures of the\nwavefunction. Symmetry considerations lead to the classification of disordered\nzigzag ribbons into the unitary class for long-range impurities, and the\northogonal class for short-range impurities.

Among other results, they proved a characterization of\nmaximal Tutte sets in terms of maximal independent sets in the graph $D(G)$ and\nmaximal extreme sets in $G$.

The 2006 data set had five additional frequencies with\namplitudes less than 1.5 mmag, and the 2007 data had one additional frequency.\nAnalysis of the full 2006-2007 data set yields 22 of the 25 frequencies found\nin the individual seasons of data. There are no significant peaks in the\nspectrum other than these between 0 and 60 c/d. The frequencies of the two main\npulsation modes derived from the 2006 and 2007 observing seasons individually\ndo not differ at the level of 3-sigma, and thus we find no conclusive evidence\nfor period change over the span of these observations. However, the amplitude\nof f(1) = 5.7898 c/d changed significantly between the two seasons, while the\namplitude of f(0) = 4.4765 c/d remained constant; amplitudes of the Fourier\nharmonics and beat frequencies of f(1) also changed. Similar behavior was seen\nin the 1950s, and it is clear that VX Hydrae undergoes significant amplitude\nchanges over time.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 5 figures, published in Publications of the Astronomical\n  Society of the Pacific, v.121, p.1076 (October 2009)"]}]

In this paper we present two strategies to\nsolve the primal LapSVM problem, in order to overcome some issues of the\noriginal dual formulation. Whereas training a LapSVM in the dual requires two\nsteps, using the primal form allows us to collapse training to a single step.\nMoreover, the computational complexity of the training algorithm is reduced\nfrom O(n^3) to O(n^2) using preconditioned conjugate gradient, where n is the\ncombined number of labeled and unlabeled examples. We speed up training by\nusing an early stopping strategy based on the prediction on unlabeled data or,\nif available, on labeled validation examples. This allows the algorithm to\nquickly compute approximate solutions with roughly the same classification\naccuracy as the optimal ones, considerably reducing the training time. Due to\nits simplicity, training LapSVM in the primal can be the starting point for\nadditional enhancements of the original LapSVM formulation, such as those for\ndealing with large datasets. We present an extensive experimental evaluation on\nreal world data showing the benefits of the proposed approach.\n","Comment: 39 pages, 14 figures"]}]
