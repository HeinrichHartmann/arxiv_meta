We construct\nseveral examples of the modified gravity which produces accelerating\ncosmologies ending at the finite-time future singularity of all four known\ntypes by applying the reconstruction program. Some scenarios to resolve the\nfinite-time future singularity are presented. Among these scenarios, the most\nnatural one is related with additional modification of the gravitational action\nin the early universe. In addition, late-time cosmology in the non-minimal\nMaxwell-Einstein theory is considered. We investigate the forms of the\nnon-minimal gravitational coupling which generates the finite-time future\nsingularities and the general conditions for this coupling in order that the\nfinite-time future singularities cannot emerge. Furthermore, it is shown that\nthe non-minimal gravitational coupling can remove the finite-time future\nsingularities or make the singularity stronger (or weaker) in modified gravity.\n","Comment: 25 pages, no figure, title changed, accepted in JCAP"]}]

One goal is to test\nmagnetospheric accretion model predictions. Observational evidence previously\npublished supporting the model, such as emission line asymmetry and a high\nfrequency of redshifted absorption components, are considered. We also discuss\nthe relation between different line forming regions and search for good\naccretion rate indicators.\n  In this work we confirm several important points of the models, such as the\ncorrelation between accretion and outflow, broad emission components that are\nmostly central or slightly blueshifted and only the occasional presence of\nredshifted absorption. We also show, however, that the broad emission\ncomponents supposedly formed in the magnetospheric accretion flow only\npartially support the models. Unlike the predictions, they are sometimes\nredshifted, and are mostly found to be symmetric. The published theoretical\nprofiles do not have a strong resemblance to our observed ones. We emphasize\nthe need for accretion models to include a strong turbulent component before\ntheir profiles will match the observations. The effects of rotation, and the\noutflow components, will also be needed to complete the picture.\n","Comment: 25 pages including 9 figures, 3 tables, accepted for publication in\n  the Astronomical Journal"]}]

The time-averaged broad iron K line is\nwell-described by disk emission near a Schwarzschild black hole, confirming the\nresults of earlier analyses on the ASCA 1994 and 1997 data. The time-resolved\niron-line profile is remarkably stable over a factor of three change in source\nflux, and the line and continuum fluxes are uncorrelated. Detailed fits to the\nvariable iron-line profile suggest that the active region (parametrized by the\nbest-fit inner and outer radii of the accretion disk) responsible for iron line\nemission actually narrows with increasing flux to a region around 4--5 r_g. In\ncontrast to the iron line, the power-law continuum exhibits significant\nvariability during the 1999 observation. Time-resolved spectral analysis\nreveals a new feature in the well-known photon index (Gamma) vs. flux\ncorrelation: Gamma appears to approach a limiting value of Gamma ~ 2.1 at high\nflux. Two models are proposed to explain both the new feature in the Gamma vs.\nflux correlation and the uncorrelated iron-line flux: a phenomenological two\npower-law model, and the recently proposed ``thundercloud'' model of Merloni &\nFabian (2001). Both models are capable of reproducing the data well, but\nbecause they are poorly constrained by the observed Gamma vs. flux relation,\nthey cannot at present be tested meaningfully by the data. The various\nimplications and the physical interpretation of these models are discussed.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

If it is assumed that Mrk 766 shows a\npower spectrum similar in form to that of Cyg X-1, and that the break timescale\nscales linearly with black hole mass, then the mass of the black hole in Mrk\n766 is inferred to be < 5 x 10^5 M_sun. This rather low mass would mean Mrk 766\nradiates above the Eddington limit. The coherence between different energy\nbands is significantly below unity implying that variations in the different\nenergy bands are rather poorly correlated. The low coherence can be explained\nin the framework of standard Comptonisation models if the properties of the\nComptonising medium are rapidly variable or if there are several distinct\nemission sites.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS Letters"]}]

This results in\na picture analogous to the one recently proposed by Polyakov (hep-th/9809057).\nOne of the serious problems that needs to be resolved is the closed string\ntachyon mode which couples to the D-branes and appears to cause an instability.\nWe study the tachyon terms in the type 0 effective action and argue that the\nbackground R-R flux provides a positive shift of the (mass)^2 of the tachyon.\nThus, for sufficiently large flux, the tachyonic instability may be cured,\nremoving the most basic obstacle to constructing the type 0 duals of\nnon-supersymmetric gauge theories. We further find that the tachyon acquires an\nexpectation value in presence of the R-R flux. This effect is crucial for\nbreaking the conformal invariance in the dual description of the 3+1\ndimensional non-supersymmetric gauge theory.\n","Comment: 30 pages, harvmac, v2: references added; v3: section 2 revised; v4:\n  minor corrections"]}]

In particular, we discuss the\ncase of a D5-brane wrapped on AdS_3 x S^3, a solution interpolating between\nAdS_3 x S^3 x R^5 and AdS_3 x S^3 x S^3 x R, and a D3-brane wrapped over S^3 x\nR or AdS_2 x S^2. Another class of solutions we discuss involves NS5-branes\nintersecting over a 3-space and NS5-branes intersecting over a line. These\nsolutions are similar to D7-brane or cosmic string backgrounds.\n","Comment: 21 pages, harvmac; misprint corrected"]}]
