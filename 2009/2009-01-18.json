Methods\navailable in the literature are, however, typically not stringent enough in\nidentifying such genes, particularly when the profile requires equivalence of\ngene expression levels at certain time points. In this paper, the authors\nintroduce a new methodology, called gene profiling, that uses simultaneous\ndifferential and equivalent gene expression level testing to rank genes\naccording to a pre-specified gene expression profile. Gene profiling treats the\nvector of true gene expression levels as a linear combination of appropriate\nvectors, i.e., vectors that give the required criteria for the profile. This\ngene-profile model is fitted to the data and the resultant parameter estimates\nare summarized in a single test statistic that is then used to rank the genes.\nThe theoretical underpinnings of gene profiling (equivalence testing,\nintersection-union tests) are discussed in this paper, and the gene profiling\nmethodology is applied to our motivating stem cell experiment.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 6 figures, final version of the paper is now published\n  online in Biostatistics"]}]
