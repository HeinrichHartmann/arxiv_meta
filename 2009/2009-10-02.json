One-dimensional calculations using the\nLinear Eddy Model of Kerstein (1991) elucidate three regimes of turbulent\nburning. In the simplest case, large scale turbulence folds and deforms thin\nlaminar flamelets to produce a flame brush with a total burning rate given\napproximately by the speed of turbulent fluctuations on the integral scale,\nU_L. This is the regime where the supernova explosion begins and where most of\nits pre-detonation burning occurs. As the density declines, turbulence starts\nto tear the individual flamelets, making broader structures that move faster.\nFor a brief time, these turbulent flamelets are still narrow compared to their\nspacing and the concept of a flame brush moving with an overall speed of U_L\nremains valid. However, the typical width of the individual flamelets, which is\ngiven by the condition that their turnover time equals their burning time,\ncontinues to increase as the density declines. Eventually, mixed regions almost\nas large as the integral scale itself are transiently formed. At that point, a\ntransition to detonation can occur. The conditions for such a transition are\nexplored numerically and it is estimated that the transition will occur for\ndensities near 1 x 10**7 g/cm**3, provided the turbulent speed on the integral\nscale exceeds about 15% sonic.

For the\nperiod 300-795 days past explosion, we argue that the spectral energy\ndistribution of SN 2004et comprises (a) a hot component due to emission from\noptically thick gas, as well as free-bound radiation, (b) a warm component due\nto newly formed, radioactively heated dust in the ejecta, and (c) a cold\ncomponent due to an IR echo from the interstellar-medium dust of the host\ngalaxy, NGC 6946. There may also have been a small contribution to the IR SED\ndue to free-free emission from ionised gas in the ejecta. We reveal the\nfirst-ever spectroscopic evidence for silicate dust formed in the ejecta of a\nsupernova. This is supported by our detection of a large, but progressively\ndeclining, mass of SiO. However, we conclude that the mass of directly detected\nejecta dust grew to no more than a few times 10^(-4)Msun. We also provide\nevidence that the ejecta dust formed in comoving clumps of fixed size. We argue\nthat, after about two years past explosion, the appearance of wide, box-shaped\noptical line profiles was due to the impact of the ejecta on the progenitor\ncircumstellar medium and that the subsequent formation of a cool, dense shell\nwas responsible for a later rise in the MIR flux.

Pushed by recent evolution calculations of\nGRB progenitors, we focus on lower angular momentum of the central core than\nthe ones taken mostly in previous studies. By performing special relativistic\nsimulations including both realistic equation of state and neutrino coolings,\nwe follow a unprecedentedly long-term evolution of the slowly rotating\ncollapsars up to $\\sim$ 10 s, accompanied by the formation of jets and\naccretion disks. Our results show that for the GRB progenitors to function as\ncollapsars, there is a critical initial angular momentum, below which matter is\nquickly swallowed to the central objects, no accretion disks and no MHD\noutflows are formed. When larger than the criteria, we find the launch of the\nMHD jets in the following two ways. For models with stronger initial magnetic\nfields, the magnetic pressure amplified inside the accretion disk can drive the\nMHD outflows, which makes the strong magnetic explosions like a 'magnetic\ntower' (type II). For the models with weaker initial magnetic fields, the\nmagnetic tower stalls first and the subsequent MHD outflows are produced by\nsome eventual inflows of the accreting material from the equator to the polar\nregions (type I). Regardless of type I or II, the jets can attain only mildly\nrelativistic speeds with the explosion energy less than $10^{49} \\erg$, which\ncould possibly be related to the X-ray flashes.

The pulsations\nthemselves are evanescent in the stellar photosphere, but they may be unstable\nto the generation of resonant oscillations at the acoustic cutoff frequency.

We have used the long\nwavelength (LWS3) low resolution (LR) spectroscopic mode of the ISAAC camera at\nthe VLT in the spectral range of the M filter from 4.4micron to 5.1micron. The\nuse of a slit width of 0.6\" implied a spectral resolution of R=l/Dl=800 (Dv=375\nkm/s). These observations resulted in M-band spectra of 15 bright sources in\nthe central stellar cluster of the Milky Way. In addition to gaseous 12^CO\n(4.666 micron) and 13^CO (4.77 micron) vibration-rotational absorptions, we\ndetect a strong absorption due to a mixture of polar and apolar CO ice\n(centered at 4.675 micron). In the shorter wavelength absorption wing there is\nan absorption feature due to XCN at 4.62 micron. The XCN absorption is\nstrongest toward the M2 supergiant IRS7. We find that the extinctions due to\nmaterial traced by the CO ice and the CO gas absorptions may be of comparable\nimportance. Using the spectra of IRS2L and IRS16C we perform a first order\ncorrection of the line of sight absorption due to CO-ice and 13^CO gas. In\ncombination with published hydrogen number density estimates from sub-mm\nCO(7-6) and FIR [OI] line data we obtain gas masses of the circumstellar shells\nof the order of 10^-3 and 10^-2 solar masses. This implies that in future\nspectra taken at high spectral and angular resolution the bright and dust\nembedded Galactic Center sources should show a substantial line absorption due\nto source intrinsic absorption.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 9 figures, Accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

Hence, its time evolution\ndepends (functionally) solely on the same PDF.
