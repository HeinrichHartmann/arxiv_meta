We outline the\nevidence that the parent compounds, while metallic, have electron interactions\nthat are sufficiently strong to produce incipient Mott physics. In other words,\nin terms of the strength of electron correlations compared to the kinetic\nenergy, the iron pnictides are closer to intermediately-coupled systems lying\nat the boundary between itinerancy and localization, such as V2O3 or Se-doped\nNiS2, rather than to simple antiferromagnetic metals like Cr.
