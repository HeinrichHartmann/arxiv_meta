Nevertheless, the prospect of life on a planet located within\nthe HZ of a red dwarf is moderately high, based on the longevity of these stars\n(>50 Gyr), their constant luminosities and high space densities. Here we\ndescribe the aims and early results of the \"Living with a Red Dwarf\" Program -\na study of dM stars that we have been carrying out over the last few years. The\nprimary focus of our research on dM stars is the study of their magnetic\ndynamos and resulting star spots & coronal X-ray and chromospheric UV emissions\nas a function of age, rotation and spectral type. This program will provide\ndatasets that can be used as inputs for the study of all aspects of dM stars,\nalong with the planets already discovered hosted by them and the probable\nhundreds (thousands?) of planets expected to be uncovered in the near future by\nmissions such as Kepler & Darwin/TPF. These datasets will be invaluable to\nthose who model exo-planetary atmospheres, as well as exobiologists &\nastrobiologists who are studying the possibilities of life elsewhere in the\nuniverse. A significant element of our program is the determination of accurate\nstellar magnetic-driven X-ray-UV (X-UV) irradiances that are generated by the\ndM stars' vigorous magnetic dynamos. These X-UV irradiances (and flare\nfrequencies) are strongly dependent on rotation, and thus age, and diminish as\nthe stars lose angular momentum and spin-down over time via magnetic braking.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 6 figures; to be published in the proceedings of the 8th\n  Pacific Rim Conference on Stellar Astrophysics, 5-9 May 2008, Phuket,\n  Thailand - ASP Conference Series"]}]
