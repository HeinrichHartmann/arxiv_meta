Here, we give the\nmicroscopic derivation. The solution reveals a new mechanism of confinement in\nQCD(adj) in the regime where we have control over both perturbative and\nnonperturbative aspects. In particular, consider SU(2) QCD(adj) theory with $1\n\\leq n_f \\leq 4$ Majorana fermions, a theory which undergoes gauge symmetry\nbreaking at small $S^1$. If the magnetic charge of the BPS monopole is\nnormalized to unity, we show that confinement occurs due to condensation of\nobjects with magnetic charge 2, not 1. Because of index theorems, we know that\nsuch an object cannot be a two identical monopole configuration. Its net\ntopological charge must vanish, and hence it must be topologically\nindistinguishable from the perturbative vacuum. We construct such non-self-dual\ntopological excitations, the magnetically charged, topologically null molecules\nof a BPS monopole and ${\\bar{\\rm KK}}$ antimonopole, which we refer to as\nmagnetic bions. An immediate puzzle with this proposal is the apparent Coulomb\nrepulsion between the BPS-${\\bar{\\rm KK}}$ pair. An attraction which overcomes\nthe Coulomb repulsion between the two is induced by $2n_f$-fermion exchange.\nBion condensation is also the mechanism of confinement in $\\N=1$ SYM on the\nsame four-manifold.

With real-time traffic data regarding travel times, it is important\nto analyze how to use the information provided. In particular, can a Wardrop\nequilibrium be realized? Simulations using the three-phase model on a two-route\nexample are presented to answer this question. One route (the main line) is a\ntwo-lane highway with a stalled vehicle in the right lane and the other route\nis a low-speed bypass. For a critical incoming flow, a phase transition between\nfree flow and congested flow near the stalled vehicle is observed, making this\na challenging example. In the first scenario, drivers choose routes selfishly\non the basis of current travel times. The result is strong oscillations in\ntravel time because of the inherent delay in the information provided. The\nsecond scenario involves a hypothetical control system that limits the number\nof vehicles on the main line to prevent the free-flow to congested-flow phase\ntransition by diverting sufficient flow to the bypass. The resulting steady\nstate is neither a Wardrop equilibrium nor a system optimum, but an\nintermediate state in which the main-line travel time is less than on the\nbypass but the average for all vehicles is close to a minimum. In a third\nscenario, anticipation is used as a driver-advice system to provide a fair\nindicator of which route to take. Prediction is based on real-time data\ncomparing the number of vehicles on the main line at the time a vehicle leaves\nthe origin to the actual travel time when it reaches the destination.

The theory of\ngravitational aether is an alternative to general relativity that does not\nsuffer from this fine-tuning problem, as it decouples the quantum field theory\nvacuum from geometry, while remaining consistent with other tests of gravity.\nIn this paper, we study static black hole solutions in this theory and show\nthat it manifests a UV-IR coupling: Aether couples the spacetime metric close\nto the black hole horizon, to metric at infinity. We then show that using the\nTrans-Planckian ansatz (as a quantum gravity effect) close to the black hole\nhorizon, leads to an accelerating cosmological solution, far from the horizon.\nInterestingly, this acceleration matches current observations for stellar mass\nblack holes. Based on our current understanding of the black hole accretion\nhistory in the Universe, we then make a prediction for how the effective dark\nenergy density should evolve with redshift, which can be tested with future\ndark energy probes.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 3 figures"]}]

These couplings will be generically misaligned with respect to the\nfermion mass matrix, producing large and potentially dangerous flavor changing\nneutral currents (FCNC's). As recently pointed out in [arXiv:0906.1542], a\nsimilar effect is expected from the point of view of a composite Higgs sector,\nwhich corresponds to a 4D theory dual to the 5D setup by the AdS-CFT\ncorrespondence. We also point out that the effect is independent of the\ngeographical nature of the Higgs (bulk or brane localized), and specifically\nthat it does not go away as the Higgs is pushed towards the IR boundary. The\nFCNC's mediated by a light enough Higgs (specially their contribution to\n$\\epsilon_K$) could become of comparable size as the ones coming from the\nexchange of Kaluza-Klein (KK) gluons. Moreover, both sources of flavor\nviolation are complementary since they have inverse dependence on the 5D Yukawa\ncouplings, such that we cannot decouple the flavor violation effects by\nincreasing or decreasing these couplings. We also find that for KK scales of a\nfew TeV, the Higgs couplings to third generation fermions could experience\nsuppressions of up to 40% while the rest of diagonal couplings would suffer\nmuch milder corrections. Potential LHC signatures like the Higgs flavor\nviolating decays $h\\to\\mu\\tau$ or $h\\to tc$, or the exotic top decay channel\n$t\\to c h$, are finally addressed.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 6 figures, revtex4"]}]
