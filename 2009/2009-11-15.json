Theorem 5.1 gives simple\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for an isotropic objective function to be\nrank one convex on the set of matrices with positive determinant. Theorem 6.2\ndescribes a class of possible non-polyconvex but multiplicative quasiconvex\nisotropic functions. This class is not contained in a well known theorem of\nBall (6.3 in this paper) which gives sufficient conditions for an isotropic and\nobjective function to be polyconvex. We show here that there is a new way to\nprove directly the quasiconvexity (in the multiplicative form). Relevance of\nSchur convexity for the description of rank one convex hulls is explained.\n","Comment: 13 pages"]}]
