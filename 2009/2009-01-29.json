These results suggest that major-merger candidate pairs in the\n0$<$z$<$0.1 universe are developed from $\\sim$1.6% of the galaxy population\nwithout dependance on galaxy mass for pair components below 10$^{11}$\nM$_{\\sun}$. The derived LF combined with merger model time scales give local\nmerger rates per unit volume which decrease with masses greater than 10$^{11}$\nM$_{\\sun}$ .\n","Comment: 20 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication by Astrophysical\n  Journal"]}]
