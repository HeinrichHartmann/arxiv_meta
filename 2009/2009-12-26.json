Several geometries have been considered: a linear array of rings\nconnected with short or long wires compared to the phase coherence length,\nsquare networks and hollow cylinders. Compared to the well-known case of the\nisolated ring, we show that for connected rings, the winding of the Brownian\ntrajectories around the rings is modified, leading to a different harmonics\ncontent of the quantum oscillations. We relate this harmonics content to the\ndistribution of winding numbers. We consider the limits where coherence length\n$L_\\varphi$ is small or large compared to the perimeter $L$ of each ring\nconstituting the network. In the latter case, the coherent diffusive\ntrajectories explore a region larger than $L$, whence a network dependent\nharmonics content. Our analysis is based on the calculation of the spectral\ndeterminant of the diffusion equation for which we have a simple expression on\nany network. It is also based on the hypothesis that the time dependence of the\ndephasing between diffusive trajectories can be described by an exponential\ndecay with a single characteristic time $\\tau_\\varphi$ (model A) .\n  At low temperature, decoherence is limited by electron-electron interaction,\nand can be modelled in a one-electron picture by the fluctuating electric field\ncreated by other electrons (model B). It is described by a functional of the\ntrajectories and thus the dependence on geometry is crucial. Expressions for\nthe magnetoconductance oscillations are derived within this model and compared\nto the results of model A. It is shown that they involve several\ntemperature-dependent length scales.\n","Comment: 35 pages, revtex4, 25 figures (34 pdf files)"]}]

Hence, methods to remove noise become most significant in EMG\nsignal analysis. White Gaussian noise (WGN) is used to represent interference\nin this paper. Generally, WGN is difficult to be removed using typical\nfiltering and solutions to remove WGN are limited. In addition, noise removal\nis an important step before performing feature extraction, which is used in\nEMG-based recognition. This research is aimed to present a novel feature that\ntolerate with WGN. As a result, noise removal algorithm is not needed. Two\nnovel mean and median frequencies (MMNF and MMDF) are presented for robust\nfeature extraction. Sixteen existing features and two novelties are evaluated\nin a noisy environment. WGN with various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), i.e.\n20-0 dB, was added to the original EMG signal.

The\nerror of MMNF in weak EMG signal with very high noise, 0 dB SNR, is about 5-10\npercent and closed by MMDF and Histogram, whereas the error of other features\nis more than 20 percent. While in strong EMG signal, the error of MMNF is\nbetter than those from other features. Moreover, the combination of MMNF,\nHistrogram of EMG and Willison amplitude is used as feature vector in\nclassification task.
