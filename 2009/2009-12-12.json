The bounds in [GLV] are based on a \"coloring\" of the query\nvariables. In order to extend the previous bounds to the setting of arbitrary\nfunctional dependencies, we leverage tools from information theory to formalize\nthe original intuition that each color used represents some possible entropy of\nthat variable, and bound the maximum possible size increase via a linear\nprogram that seeks to maximize how much more entropy is in the result of the\nquery than the input. This new view allows us to precisely characterize the\nentropy structure of worst-case instances for conjunctive queries with simple\nfunctional dependencies (keys), providing new insights into the results of\n[GLV]. We extend these results to the case of general functional dependencies,\nproviding upper and lower bounds on the worst-case size increase.

The resulting magnetic field depends strongly on the electrical\nconductivity of the white dwarf, the lifetime of the convective envelope and\nthe variability of the magnetic dynamo. We assess the various energy sources\navailable and estimate necessary lifetimes of the common envelope.

Only in the case where there is some preferential direction to the\ndynamo-generated field can an induced field, that avoids rapid decay, be\nproduced.
