To do so, we\ninvestigate the magnetic properties of a microscopic model of Tb2Ti2O7 in an\nindependent tetrahedron approximation in a finite ${\\bm B}$ along $[111]$. Such\na model describes semi-quantitatively the collective paramagnetic regime where\nnontrivial spin correlations start to develop at the shortest lengthscale, that\nis over a single tetrahedron, but where no long range order is yet present. Our\nresults show that a magnetization plateau develops at low temperatures as the\nsystem develops ${\\bm B}=0$ ferromagnetic spin-ice-like \"two-in/two-out\"\ncorrelations at the shortest lengthscale.

At interpretation of\nexperimental data it was artificially considered only the difference of losses\nrate 1/tau(T)= 1/tau_exp(T)- 1/tau_exp(10K), (tau - UCN storage time in the\ntrap). It has been accepted for temperature dependence of losses which changes\nfrom 0 to 3.3*10-4 per one collision of UCN with a trap surface. However, the\nanalysis of raw experimental data shows that in a trap at temperature 10 K\nthere is losses 1.0*10-3 per collision. They are considerably (in 3 times) more\nthan discussed temperature dependence and almost 10 times more than losses due\nto capture cross section on copper. It is the most probable that these losses\nare connected with leakage of UCN through a slit of trap shutter. Change of the\nsize of a slits on 25% at change of temperature from 300K to 10K can quite\nexplain discussed temperature dependence. Certainly, hydrogen is present on a\nsurface, but as it was shown at work [2] (V.P.Alfimenkov et al., JETP., Vol.\n55, No. 2 25 Jan.1992) temperature dependence in 3 times lower, even on the\nundegased surfaces than on the degassed and deuterated surface in work [1]. At\nlast, deuteration of a trap surface allows almost completely to suppress\ntemperature dependence connected with presence of hydrogen [2]. The conclusion\nof work [1] is that hydrogen is localized on a surface in the form of a film,\ninstead of distribution in the surface substance. This conclusion contradicts\nresults of measurement of energy dependence of UCN losses in work [2].

Poincare\nrecurrence is studied: in the free non-interacting system, a fast Poincare\nrecurrence occurs for regular arrays of line vortices. The recurrence period is\nused to demarcate dynamics driving the nonlinear quantum fluid towards\nturbulence, since fast recurrence is an approximate symmetry of the nonlinear\nquantum fluid at early times. This class of quantum algorithms is useful for\nstudying BEC superfluid dynamics over a broad range of wave numbers, from\nquantum flow to a pseudo-classical inviscid flow regime to a Kolmogorov\ninertial subrange.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 6 figures"]}]

An overdensity of them in one region of the sky (the SSA 22 field)\ntraces out a filamentary structure in the early Universe at a redshift of z =\n3.1 (equivalent to 15 per cent of the age of the Universe) and is believed to\nmark a forming protocluster. Galaxies that are bright at (sub)millimetre\nwavelengths are undergoing violent episodes of star formation, and there is\nevidence that they are preferentially associated with high-redshift radio\ngalaxies, so the question of whether they are also associated with the most\nsignificant large-scale structure growing at high redshift (as outlined by\nLyman-alpha emitters) naturally arises. Here we report an imaging survey of\n1,100-um emission in the SSA 22 region. We find an enhancement of submillimetre\ngalaxies near the core of the protocluster, and a large-scale correlation\nbetween the submillimetre galaxies and the low-mass Lyman-alpha emitters,\nsuggesting synchronous formation of the two very different types of\nstar-forming galaxy within the same structure at high redshift. These results\nare in general agreement with our understanding of the formation of cosmic\nstructure.\n","Comment: Published in Nature (7th May 2009 issue).

This is a novel approach, that\ncan be of general utility in all high precision radial velocity surveys based\non iodine cell data.

It exploited the most natural and frequently used approximation\nscheme within the NPRG framework, namely the derivative expansion (DE).\nHowever, the latter approximation turned out to yield unphysical critical\nexponents in dimensions $d\\ge 2$ and, furthermore, hinted at very poor\nconvergence properties of the DE. The author has since realized that in fact,\nthis approximation may not be valid for the KPZ problem, because of the very\nnature of the KPZ interaction, which is not {\\em potential} but {\\em\nderivative}. The probable failure of the DE is a very unusual -- and\ninstructive -- feature within the NPRG framework. As such, the original work,\nunpublished, is left available on the arXiv and can be found below.\n  Added note: the key to deal with the KPZ problem using NPRG lies in not\ntruncating the momentum dependence of the correlation functions, which is\ninvestigated in a recent work {\\em arXiv:0905.1025}.}\n  We present a new approach to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation based on\nthe non-perturbative renormalisation group (NPRG). The NPRG flow equations\nderived here, at the lowest order of the derivative expansion, provide a stable\nstrong-coupling fixed point in all dimensions $d$, embedding in particular the\nexact results in $d=0$ and $d=1$. However, it yields at this order unreliable\ndynamical and roughness exponents $z$ and $\\chi$ in higher dimensions, which\nsuggests that a richer approximation is needed to investigate the property of\nthe rough phase in $d \\ge 2$.\n","Comment: Revised version, see abstract"]}]
