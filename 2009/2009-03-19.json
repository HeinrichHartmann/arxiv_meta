In this scheme the factorized amplitude admits a\npowerful symmetry: it is invariant under rescaling of individual Wilson-line\nvelocities.

We show that the cancellation of these cusp\nanomalies in any multi-leg amplitude imposes all-order constraints on the\nkinematic dependence of the corresponding soft anomalous dimension, relating it\nto the cusp anomalous dimension. For amplitudes with two or three hard partons\nthe solution is unique: the constraints fully determine the kinematic\ndependence of the soft function.

In its simplest form,\nthe problem is to recover a matrix from a small sample of its entries, and\ncomes up in many areas of science and engineering including collaborative\nfiltering, machine learning, control, remote sensing, and computer vision to\nname a few.\n  This paper surveys the novel literature on matrix completion, which shows\nthat under some suitable conditions, one can recover an unknown low-rank matrix\nfrom a nearly minimal set of entries by solving a simple convex optimization\nproblem, namely, nuclear-norm minimization subject to data constraints.\nFurther, this paper introduces novel results showing that matrix completion is\nprovably accurate even when the few observed entries are corrupted with a small\namount of noise. A typical result is that one can recover an unknown n x n\nmatrix of low rank r from just about nr log^2 n noisy samples with an error\nwhich is proportional to the noise level.

The presence of neutron-rich large Z nuclei\n(40,95) < (Z,A) < (70,177), the large neutron-to-seed ratio, and the low\nelectron fraction Ye ~ 0.03 in the decompressing ejecta present favorable\nconditions for the r-process. We perform network calculations that are adapted\nto the quark-nova conditions, and which mimic usual (n-gamma) equilibrium\nr-process calculations during the initially cold decompression phase. They\nmatch to dynamical r-process calculations at densities below neutron drip\n(4.10^11 g cm-3). We present results for the final element abundance\ndistribution with and without heating from nuclear reactions, and compare to\nthe solar abundance pattern of r-process elements. We highlight the\ndistinguishing features of quark-novae by contrasting it with conventional\nnucleosynthetic sites such as type II supernovae and neutron star mergers,\nespecially in the context of heavy-element compositions of extremely\nmetal-deficient stars.\n","Comment: journal version; contains additional figure, sub-sections and\n  references"]}]
