We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (UV) and SDSS\n(optical) photometry to a library of population synthesis models that include\ndust attenuation. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare\nremarkably well with those derived from SDSS H alpha. Deviations from perfect\nagreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dust\nattenuation estimates. In contrast to H alpha, UV provides reliable SFRs for\ngalaxies with weak or no H alpha emission, and where H alpha is contaminated\nwith an emission from an AGN. We use full-SED SFRs to calibrate a simple\nprescription that uses GALEX UV magnitudes to produce good SFRs for normal\nstar-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar\nmass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGN, (2) those hosting an AGN, and\nfor (3) galaxies without H alpha emission. We find that the three have distinct\nstar formation histories, with AGN lying intermediate between the star-forming\nand the quiescent galaxies. Normal star forming galaxies (without an AGN) lie\non a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong\nAGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. Weak AGN,\nwhile also massive, have lower SFR, sometimes extending to the realm of\nquiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies\nthat smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent (red sequence)\ngalaxies via strong and weak AGN.

This\nfollows that the information rate of the communication system is alternatively\ngiven by the decay rate of the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the estimation system\nand by the Bode integral (BI) of the control system. Furthermore, the optimal\ntradeoff between the channel input power and information rate in feedback\ncommunication is alternatively characterized by the optimal tradeoff between\nthe (causal) one-step prediction mean-square error (MSE) and (anti-causal)\nsmoothing MSE (of an appropriate form) in estimation, and by the optimal\ntradeoff between the regulated output variance with causal feedback and the\ndisturbance rejection measure (BI or degree of anti-causality) in feedback\ncontrol.

The reason for such a proposal is claimed to be\nthe widespread perception among quantum physicists, according to which 'those\nsympathetic to the pilot-wave ontology no doubt expected that, for a system of\nN particles moving in three spatial dimensions, the theoretical description\nwould be of N wave-particle pairs - each pair consisting of a point particle\nguided in some way by an associated wave propagating in 3-space. But\nSchroedinger's wave function for such an N-particle system was emphatically not\na set of N (interacting) waves, each propagating in 3-space. It was, rather, a\nsingle wave propagating in the 3N-dimensional configuration space for the\nsystem', [2, p. 5]. In the present paper it is argued that the mentioned\nwidespread expectation need not be seen as being betrayed by what actually\nhappens.

From the location of stars in the (b-y),m_1 diagram metallicities have\nbeen determined. These have been used to estimate ages of different\nsub-populations in the color-magnitude diagram. The metal-poor population\naround -1.7 dex is the oldest population found. More metal-rich stars between\n[Fe/H]=-1.5 and -1.0 dex tend to be 1-3 Gyr younger. These stars are more\nconcentrated towards the center than the metal-poor ones. The most-metal rich\nstars (-0.7 dex) might be up to 6 Gyr younger than the oldest population. They\nare asymmetrically distributed around the center with an excess of stars\ntowards the South.

From a\ncomparison with spectroscopic element abundances, we find the best correlation\nwith the sum C+N. The high Stroemgren metallicities, if interpreted by strong\nCN-bands, result from progressively higher N and perhaps C abundances in\ncomparison to iron.

Using several different analytical mass loss formulae for RGB\nstars, we derive relative \"HB morphology ages.\" We compare them with the\nrelative main-sequence turnoff ages derived by application of the \"bridge test\"\nby Bellazzini et al.

The correlation found between (FUV-NUV) color\nand K-band luminosity (with lower luminosity objects being bluer than more\nluminous ones) can be explained as due to an increase in the dust content with\ngalaxy luminosity.\n  The images in this Atlas along with the profiles and integrated properties\nare publicly available through a dedicated web page at\nhttp://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/GALEX_Atlas/\n","Comment: 181 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in ApJS (abstract\n  abridged)"]}]

At\nintermediate energies of ions (from 1 to 10 MeV) the efficiency of each of\nthese types of a focusing is reduced. The authors offer to utilize for this\npurpose the \"hybrid\" type of focusing systems consisting of sequence of\nelectrical and magnetic quadrupole lenses, which are localized in the same\nspace. For making fields of electrical quadrupole lenses it is offered to\nutilize RF quadrupoles. The RF electrical quadrupoles are created due to the\nrelevant configuration of drift tubes in the vicinity of an accelerating gap.\nAs a result of the general theoretical analysis and calculation of concrete\nversions of practical realizations it is shown that the given system has\nadvantage as contrasted to by known analogs in the field of medium energies.\nThe velocity band of ions, in which the stable motion is ensured, is\nessentially changed, and the focusing becomes \"achromatic\". The calculations\nhave been performed for protons with velocities 0.5-1.0 % of light velocity, at\nthe gradients of electrical field up to 50 kV per square cm, and the gradients\nof magnetic field up to 1 T/m.
