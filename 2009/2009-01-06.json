The GaAs/AlGaAs\nheterostructure devices consist of two constrictions defined by etch trenches\nin 2D electron layer, enclosing an approximately circular island. Front gates\ndeposited in etch trenches allow to fine-tune the device for symmetry and to\nchange the constriction filling, relative to the bulk. The low-field\nlongitudinal and Hall magnetotransport shows Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and\ninteger quantum Hall plateaus. A systematic variation of front-gate voltage\naffects the constriction and the island electron density, while the bulk\ndensity remains unaffected. This results in quantized plateaus in longitudinal\nresistance, while the Hall resistance is dominated by the low-density,\nlow-filling constriction. At lower fields, when the quantum Hall plateaus fail\nto develop, we observe bulk Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in series\ncorresponding to an integer filling of the magnetoelectric subbands in the\nconstrictions.
