[...] METHODS: We fit GRB060614 light curves\nin Swift's BAT (15-150keV) and XRT (0.2-10keV) energy bands. Within the\nfireshell model, light curves are formed by two well defined and different\ncomponents: the Proper-GRB (P-GRB), emitted at the fireshell transparency, and\nthe extended afterglow, due to the interaction between the leftover accelerated\nbaryonic and leptonic shell and the CBM.
