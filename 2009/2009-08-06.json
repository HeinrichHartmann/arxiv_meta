Our model\nfocuses on estimating the expected average search time of the random walk by\napplying network queuing theory. To do this, we must provide first the expected\naverage search length. This is computed by means of estimations of the expected\naverage coverage at each step of the random walk.

Since the atomic hydrogen gas is the\nbuilding block of these disks, it should trace their formation accurately.\nMorphology of HI disks can now equally be quantified over Cosmic time. In\nstudies of HST deep fields, the optical or UV morphology of high-redshift\ngalaxy disks have been characterized using a few quantities: concentration (C),\nasymmetry (A), smoothness (S), second-order-moment (M20), the GINI coefficient\n(G), and Ellipticity (E). We have applied these parameters across wavelengths\nand compared them to the HI morphology over the THINGS sample. NGC 3184, an\nunperturbed disk, and NGC 5194, the canonical 3:1 interaction, serve as\nexamples for quantified morphology. We find that morphology parameters\ndetermined in HI are as good or better a tracer of interaction compared to\nthose in any other wavelength, notably in Asymmetry, Gini and M20. This opens\nthe possibility of using them in the parameterization pipeline for SKA\nprecursor catalogues to select interacting or harassed galaxies from their HI\nmorphology. Asymmetry, Gini and M20 may be redefined for use on data-cubes\nrather than HI column density image.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures, proceeding of the conference \"Panoramic Radio\n  Astronomy: Wide-field 1-2 GHz research on galaxy evolution\", June 02 - 05\n  2009, Groningen, update after small edits"]}]

The main aim of this work is to derive model-independent\nconstraints on the origin of the X-ray emission and on the nature of the\ncentral engine in 3C 390.3. On timescales of the order of few hours, probed by\nuninterrupted XMM light curves, the flux of 3C 390.3 is consistent with being\nconstant in all energy bands. On longer timescales, probed by the 2-day RXTE\nand Suzaku observations, the flux variability becomes significant. The latter\nobservation confirms that the spectral variability behavior of 3C 390.3 is\nconsistent with the spectral evolution observed in radio-quiet Seyfert\ngalaxies: the spectrum softens as the source brightens. The correlated\nvariability between soft and hard X-rays, observed during the Suzaku exposure\nand between the 2 XMM pointings, taken 1 week apart, argues against scenarios\ncharacterized by the presence of two distinct variable components in the 0.5-10\nkeV X-ray band. A detailed PSD analysis carried out over five decades in\nfrequency suggests the presence of a break at T_br~43 days at a 92% confidence\nlevel. This is the second tentative detection of a PSD break in a radio-loud,\nnon-jet dominated AGN, after the BLRG 3C120, and appears to be in general\nagreement with the relation between T_br, M_BH, and L_bol, followed by Seyfert\ngalaxies. Our results indicate that the X-ray variability properties of 3C\n390.3 are broadly consistent with those of radio-quiet AGN, suggesting that the\nX-ray emission mechanism in 3C 390.3 is similar to that of nearby Seyfert\ngalaxies without any significant contribution from a jet component.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

Multipath routing protocols have been proposed in the literature to\nmake use of these S-T paths in enhancing the survivability of the S-T\ninformation flow. This is usually accomplished by using a subset of these paths\nto forward redundant data units or combinations (if network coding is allowed)\nfrom S to T. Therefore, this enhancement in survivability reduces the useful\nS-T information rate. In this paper we present a new way to enhance the\nsurvivability of the S-T information flow without compromising the maximum\nachievable S-T information rate. To do this, bottleneck links (in the min-cut)\nshould only forward useful information, and not redundant data units. We\nintroduce the idea of extra source or destination connectivity with respect to\na certain S-T max-flow, and then we study two problems: namely, pre-cut\nprotection and post-cut protection. Although our objective in both problems is\nthe same, where we aim to maximize the number of protected paths, our analysis\nshows that the nature of these two problems are very different, and that the\npre-cut protection problem is much harder. Specifically, we prove the hardness\nof the pre-cut protection problem, formulate it as an integer linear program,\nand propose a heuristic approach to solve it. Simulations show that the\nperformance of the heuristic is acceptable even on relatively large networks.\nIn the post-cut problem we show that all the data units, forwarded by the\nmin-cut edges not incident to T, can be post-cut-protected.\n","Comment: 9 pages, submitted to INFOCOM 2010"]}]
