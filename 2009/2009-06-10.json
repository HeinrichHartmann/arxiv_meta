However, in many practical scenarios, only a noisy estimate\nof the channel is available, which may strongly differ from the true channel.\nThis imperfect CSI scenario is addressed by introducing the notion of\nestimation-induced outage (EIO) capacity. We derive a single-letter\ncharacterization of the maximal EIO rate and prove an associated coding theorem\nand its strong converse for discrete memoryless channels (DMCs). The\ntransmitter and the receiver rely on the channel estimate and the statistics of\nthe estimate to construct codes that guarantee reliable communication with a\ncertain outage probability. This ensures that in the non-outage case the\ntransmission meets the target rate with small error probability, irrespective\nof the quality of the channel estimate. Applications of the EIO capacity to a\nsingle-antenna (non-ergodic) Ricean fading channel are considered. The EIO\ncapacity for this case is compared to the EIO rates of a communication system\nin which the receiver decodes by using a mismatched ML decoder.

A separate strand of the literature has\npursued the possibility of an alternate, purely algebraic, polynomial-time\napproximation scheme. These schemes work by replacing each 1 with a random\nelement of an algebra A, and considering the determinant of the resulting\nmatrix. When A is noncommutative, this determinant can be defined in several\nways. We show that for estimators based on the conventional determinant, the\ncritical ratio of the second moment to the square of the first--and therefore\nthe number of trials we need to obtain a good estimate of the permanent--is (1\n+ O(1/d))^n when A is the algebra of d by d matrices. These results can be\nextended to group algebras, and semi-simple algebras in general. We also study\nthe symmetrized determinant of Barvinok, showing that the resulting estimator\nhas small variance when d is large enough. However, for constant d--the only\ncase in which an efficient algorithm is known--we show that the critical ratio\nexceeds 2^{n} / n^{O(d)}. Thus our results do not provide a new polynomial-time\napproximation scheme for the permanent. Indeed, they suggest that the algebraic\napproach to approximating the permanent faces significant obstacles.\n  We obtain these results using diagrammatic techniques in which we express\nmatrix products as contractions of tensor products. When these matrices are\nrandom, in either the Haar measure or the Gaussian measure, we can evaluate the\ntrace of these products in terms of the cycle structure of a suitably random\npermutation.

Rebinding of MinE to depolymerizing MinD filament tips controls\nMinE ring formation through a scaled cell shape parameter $\\tilde{r}$. We find\ntwo types of E-ring profiles near the filament tip: a strong plateau-like\nE-ring controlled by 1D diffusion of MinE along the bacterial length, or a weak\ncusp-like E-ring controlled by 3D diffusion near the filament tip. While the\nwidth of a strong E-ring depends on $\\tilde{r}$, the occupation fraction of\nMinE at the MinD filament tip is saturated and hence the depolymerization speed\ndo not depend strongly on $\\tilde{r}$. Conversely, for weak E-rings both\n$\\tilde{r}$ and the MinE to MinD stoichiometry strongly control the tip\noccupation and hence the depolymerization speed. MinE rings {\\em in vivo} are\nclose to the threshold between weak and strong, and so MinD-filament\ndepolymerization speed should be sensitive to cell shape, stoichiometry, and\nthe MinE-rebinding rate. We also find that the transient to MinE-ring formation\nis quite long in the appropriate open geometry for assays of ATPase activity\n{\\it in vitro}, explaining the long delays of ATPase activity observed for\nsmaller MinE concentrations in those assays without the need to invoke\ncooperative MinE activity.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures"]}]
