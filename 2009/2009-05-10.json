In our previous study (H. Kitano et al.,\nPhys. Rev. B 73, 092504 (2006).), the 2D-XY critical dynamics for underdoped\nLSCO and the 3D-XY critical dynamics for optimally doped LSCO were reported. In\nthis study, we observed a novel two-dimensional unknown critical charge\ndynamics for overdoped thin films from x=0.17 to 0.20, which is clearly\ndistinguished from the 2D-XY critical dynamics. Through the systematic\nmeasurements by changing the film thickness or by applying small magnetic\nfield, it was confirmed that this unusual behavior, which is referred as 2D-\"U\"\nbelow, was not induced by the finite size effect but was intrinsic to the\noverdoped LSCO. Thus, it was found that the critical behavior in the phase\ndiagram of LSCO is classified into the following three types; (i) 2D-XY for\nunderdoped region, (ii) 3D-XY for optimally doped region, and (iii) 2D-\"U\" for\noverdoped region. In other words, the dimensionality in the critical charge\ndynamics is changed twice with hole doping. We discuss possible origins of such\nanomalous dimensional crossovers with hole doping, including an interpretation\nbased on the possible existence of a hidden quantum critical point near the\noptimally doped region.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 1 table, 24 figures"]}]
