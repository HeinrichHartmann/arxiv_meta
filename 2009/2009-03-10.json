In semiconductors with a strong spin-orbit coupling the\nspin accumulation is interpreted as a superposition of coherent eigenstates.\nBoth views can be reconciled by taking into account the electron-electron\ninteraction: a sufficiently strong self-consistent exchange field reduces a\nspin accumulation to a chemical potential difference between the two spin bands\neven in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate the idea on a clean\ntwo-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) by showing how the exchange field protects\na spin accumulation from dephasing and introduces an easy-plane anisotropy.\n","Comment: 3 figures"]}]

Comparing this new set of orbital parameters and, in particular,\nthe value of the time of ascending-node passage with the orbital parameters\nderived for the previous four X-ray outbursts of SAX J1808.4-3658 observed by\nthe PCA on board RXTE, we find an updated value of the orbital period\nderivative, which turns out to be $\\dot P_{\\rm orb} = (3.89 \\pm 0.15) \\times\n10^{-12}$ s/s. This new value of the orbital period derivative agrees with the\npreviously reported value, demonstrating that the orbital period derivative in\nthis source has remained stable over the past ten years. Although this timespan\nis not sufficient yet for confirming the secular evolution of the system, we\nagain propose an explanation of this behavior in terms of a highly\nnon-conservative mass transfer in this system, where the accreted mass (as\nderived from the X-ray luminosity during outbursts) accounts for a mere 1% of\nthe mass lost by the companion.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures.

The\nsignificant rms value in power density spectrum implies that the oscillation\ninvolves in the dynamical and non-linear variation of certain region of the\naccretion disk itself. The nature of the energy dependence implies that the\nregion which produces Comptonized hard tail is also responsible for QPOs.\nSimilarly, the occurrences of the QPOs are strongly related to the jet\nformation and the spectral states. These features are the natural consequences\nof the advective disk paradigm that we are advocating. In the mid 90s, some of\nthe present authors first pointed out that the QPOs in all possible types of\nblack holes may be simply due to the oscillations of the CENBOL, the\nCENtrifugal pressure supported BOundary Layer which is formed in the\nsub-Keplerian flows around a black hole. This CENBOL could be axi-symmetric as\nwell as non-axisymteric in nature since its boundary, namely, the centrifugally\ndriven shocks could be axi-symmetric or non-axisymmetric. In addition, we\npointed out that the transition radius where the flow becomes Keplerian to\nsub-Keplerian, as well as the location of the inner sonic point can also\noscillate and produce the QPOs. Since the shock locations are functions of the\nspecific angular momentum ($\\lambda$) and specific energy (${\\cal E}$) of the\nflow, our model naturally predicts that the QPO frequency should vary with\nmass, spin, $\\lambda$ and ${\\cal E}$. The QPO frequencies with specific ratios,\nsuch as, 2:3 must be due to non-axisymmetric effects when the shock switches\nbetween the two-armed and the three-armed spirals.

These models arise in situations that involve a very\nlarge number of agents moving from state to state according to certain\noptimality criteria. The mean field approach for optimal control and\ndifferential games (continuous state and time) was introduced by Lasry and\nLions. Here we consider a discrete version of the problem. Our setting is the\nfollowing: we assume that there is a very large number of identical agents\nwhich can be in a finite number of states. Because the number of agents is very\nlarge, we assume the mean field hypothesis, that is, that the only relevant\ninformation for the global evolution is the fraction $\\pi^n_i$ of players in\neach state $i$ at time $n$. The agents look for minimizing a running cost,\nwhich depends on $\\pi$, plus a terminal cost $V^N$. In contrast with optimal\ncontrol, where usually only the terminal cost $V^N$ is necessary to solve the\nproblem, in mean-field games both the initial distribution of agents $\\pi^0$\nand the terminal cost $V^N$ are necessary to determine the solutions, that is,\nthe distribution of players $\\pi^n$ and value function $V^n$, for $0\\leq n\\leq\nN$. Because both initial and terminal data needs to be specified, we call this\nproblem the initial-terminal value problem. Existence of solutions is\nnon-trivial. Nevertheless, following the ideas of Lasry and Lions, we were able\nto establish existence and uniqueness, both for the stationary and for the\ninitial-terminal value problems. In the last part of the paper we prove the\nmain result of the paper, namely the exponential convergence to a stationary\nsolution of $(\\pi^0, V^0)$, as $N\\to \\infty$, for the initial-terminal value\nproblem with (fixed) data $\\pi^{-N}$ and $V^N$.\n"]}]

In particular, we find values for which\n$f_{a,b}$ is an automorphism of positive entropy but no invariant curve. The\nMain Theorem: If $f_{a,b}$ is an automorphism with an invariant curve and\npositive entropy, then either (1) $(a,b)$ is real, and the restriction of $f$\nto the real points has maximal entropy, or (2) $f_{a,b}$ has a rotation\n(Siegel) domain.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 7 figures, A companion Mathematica notebook is available\n  at: http://www.math.fsu.edu/~kim/"]}]

The Haar weight restricted to certain\nsubalgebras are explicitly determined in terms of an infinitely supported\nJackson integral and in terms of an infinitely supported Askey-Wilson type\nmeasure. For the evaluation the spectral analysis of explicit unbounded doubly\ninfinite Jacobi matrices and some new summation formulas for basic\nhypergeometric series are needed. The spherical functions are calculated in\nterms of Askey-Wilson functions and big q-Jacobi functions.
