Two\nquite different criteria are likely to be appropriate candidates: the minimum\neffort cost (or sthenic criterion) and the minimum energy cost. The paper is\naimed at clarifying the dynamic effects of these two fundamental criteria when\nconsidering movements executed with liveliness as they are in gymnastic. It is\nwell known that the former cost generates movements with smooth dynamics. A\nspecial attention is devoted to the latter. The optimal control theory shows\nthat minimizing the energy consumption results in actuating inputs of\nbang-off-bang type producing momentum impulses. When achieving dynamic\nsynthesis, this criterion makes necessary to account for bounds set on driving\ntorques. Moreover, when dealing with one-sided contacts, as in floor\nhandstands, the unilaterality of contact forces must be explicitly accounted\nfor since it tends to be infringed by impulsive efforts. Numerical simulations\nof these formal properties are carried out using a parametric optimization\ntechnique, and considering the raising phase of floor handstands. It is shown\nthat the energetic criterion tends to generate movements which exhibit\nsimilarities with their real counterpart performed by an expert gymnast.\nConversely, the sthenic criterion produces movements quite different.

The constraint of unitary evolution for non-dissipative quantum\nsystems imposes kinematical bounds on the optimization of arbitrary\nobservables. We summarize our previous results on kinematical bounds and show\nthat these bounds are dynamically realizable for completely controllable\nsystems. Moreover, we establish improved bounds for certain partially\ncontrollable systems. Finally, the question of dynamical realizability of the\nbounds for arbitary partially controllable systems is shown to depend on the\naccessible sets of the associated control system on the unitary group U(N) and\nthe results of a few control computations are discussed briefly.\n","Comment: 5 pages, orginal June 30, 2000, revised September 28, 2000"]}]

The signal amplitude can be much\nless compared to the field of the static barrier. This phenomenon can be called\nthe Euclidean resonance since the under-barrier motion occurs in imaginary\ntime. The resonance may stimulate chemical and biochemical reactions in a\nselective way by adapting the signal to a certain particular chemical bond.

Such a procedure enables unique\ndefinition of scattering observables and is equal to an absorption (creation)\nof particles in the origin. It is shown, that suggested regularization is an\nanalytical continuation of the scattering amplitudes of repulsive singular\npotential in interaction constant $\\alpha_{s}$. The nearthreshold properties of\nregularized in a mentioned way singular potential are examined. We obtain\nexpressions for the scattering lengths, which turn to be complex even for\ninfinitesimal imaginary part of interaction constant. The problem of\nperturbation of nearthreshold states of regular potential by a singular one is\ntreated, the expressions for level shifts and widths are obtained. We show,\nthat the physical sense of suggested regularization is that the scattering\nobservables are insensitive to any details of the short range modification of\nsingular potential, if there exists sufficiently strong inelastic short range\ninteraction. In this case the scattering observables are determined by\nsolutions of Schrodinger equation with regularized potential $-(\\alpha_{s}\\pm\ni0)/r^{s}$.
