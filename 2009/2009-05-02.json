The fundamental uncertainty that is inherently present at this scale\nmanifests itself in the unavoidable presence of noise, making this a novel\nfield of application for stochastic estimation and control theory. In this\nexpository paper we demonstrate estimation and feedback control of quantum\nmechanical systems in what is essentially a noncommutative version of the\nbinomial model that is popular in mathematical finance. The model is extremely\nrich and allows a full development of the theory, while remaining completely\nwithin the setting of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces (thus avoiding the\ntechnical complications of the continuous theory). We introduce discretized\nmodels of an atom in interaction with the electromagnetic field, obtain\nfiltering equations for photon counting and homodyne detection, and solve a\nstochastic control problem using dynamic programming and Lyapunov function\nmethods.\n","Comment: 76 pages, 12 figures.
