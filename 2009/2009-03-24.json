The non-trivial features\nof the potential arise from radiative corrections which give a simple\nlogarithmic dependence on the inflaton field, making the models very\npredictive. We also consider a modified scenario with new physics beyond a\ncertain high-energy cut-off showing up as non-renormalizable operators (NRO) in\nthe inflaton field. We find that both kinds of models fit remarkably well CMB\nand LSS data, with very few free parameters. Besides, a large part of these\nmodels naturally predict a reasonable number of e-folds. A robust feature of\nthese scenarios is the smallness of tensor perturbations (r < 10^{-3}). The NRO\ncase can give a sizeable running of the spectral index while achieving a\nsufficient number of e-folds. We use Bayesian model comparison tools to assess\nthe relative performance of the models. We believe that these scenarios can be\nconsidered as a standard physical class of inflationary models, on a similar\nfooting with monomial potentials.\n","Comment: 42 LaTeX pages, 8 figures"]}]

For finite\nsystems, each stationary point is found to cause a nonanalyticity in the\nmicrocanonical entropy, and the functional form of this nonanalytic term can be\nderived explicitly.

At the money (X= K) for American options, the expected payoff of\nboth the call and put options is zero. Shepp investigated several stochastic\noptimization problems using martingale and stopping time theories [2,5,6]. One\nof the problems he investigated was how to optimize the stock price using both\nthe Black-Scholes (multiplicative) and the Bachelier (additive) models [7,6]\nfor the American option above the strike price K (exercise price) to a stopping\npoint. In order to explore the non-relativistic quantum effect on the expected\npayoff for both the call and put options at the money, we assumed the stock\nprice to undergo a stochastic process governed by the Bachelier (additive)\nmodel [4]. Further, using Ito calculus and martingale theory, we obtained a\ndifferential equation for the expected payoff for both the call and put options\nin terms of delta and gamma. We also obtained the solution to the\nnon-relativistic Schroedinger equation as the expected payoff for both the call\nand put options. Then, we expressed the stochastic process that is the expected\npayoff for both the call and put options at the money in terms of the solution\nto the Schroedinger equation. We concluded the stochastic process that is the\nexpected payoff at the money for both options to be an oscillatory function\nwith quantized interest rates.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 1 figure.

Peer-to-peer\nsystems for geographic or multidimensional range queries built on existing DHTs\nsuffer from the inaccuracy in linearization of the multidimensional space.\nOther overlay structures that are based on hierarchical partitioning of the\nsearch space are not scalable because they use special super-peers to represent\nthe nodes in the hierarchy.

GeoP2P provides such\nadaptive features with minimum perturbation of the system state. Such\nadaptation makes both the routing delay and the state size of each peer\nlogarithmic to the total number of peers, irrespective of the size of the\nmultidimensional space.
