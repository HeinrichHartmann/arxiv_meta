Observations and analysis of solar-type oscillations in red-giant\nstars is an emerging aspect of asteroseismic analysis with a number of open\nquestions yet to be explored.

The\nquality and quantity of photometric data as provided by the CoRoT satellite is\nnecessary to provide a breakthrough in observing p-mode oscillations in red\ngiants.

As the\nCoRoT exofield targets are relatively faint (11-16 mag) there are no (or only\nweak) constraints on the star's location in the H-R diagram.

As PAH destruction process we consider\nunimolecular dissociation and present a simplified scheme to estimate the\nlocation from the star where the molecules become photo-stable. We find that\nsoft photons with energies below ~20eV dissociate PAHs only up to short\ndistances from the star (r < 1AU); whereas dissociation by hard photons (EUV\nand X-ray) is so efficient that it would destroy all PAHs (from regions in the\ndisk where they could be excited). As a possible path for PAH survival we\nsuggest turbulent motions in the disk. They can replenish PAHs or remove them\nfrom the reach of hard photons. For standard disk models, where the surface\ndensity changes like 1/r and the mid plane temperature like 1/r^{0.5}, the\ncritical vertical velocity for PAH survival is proportional to r^{-3/4} and\nequals ~5m/s at 10AU which is in the range of expected velocities in the\nsurface layer.

The greatest improvement is in the reproduction of the cyclic\nvariation of the open flux, including the amplitudes of individual cycles.\nFurthermore, we found that approximately 25% of the modeled open flux values\nsince the end of the Maunder Minimum are lower than the averaged value during\nthe current low minimum. The same proportion is observed in reconstructions of\nthe open flux during the Holocene based on cosmogenic isotopes, which suggests\nthat the present solar minimum conditions are below average, but not\nexceptional in terms of the magnetic flux.\n"]}]

On the other hand,\nfrom a practical point of view, it would also be desirable to identify the\ncases where such an encoder design may not improve communication rates. This\nquestion is particularly interesting for the case where the transmitted\nmessages and the feedback signals are subject to eavesdropping. In this work,\nwe investigate the question of how much impact the feedback has on the secrecy\ncapacity by studying two fundamental models. First, we consider the Gaussian\ntwo-way wiretap channel and derive an outer bound for its secrecy capacity\nregion. We show that the secrecy rate loss can be unbounded when feedback\nsignals are not utilized except for a special case we identify, and thus\nconclude that utilizing feedback can be highly beneficial in general. Second,\nwe consider a half-duplex Gaussian two-way relay channel where the relay node\nis also an eavesdropper, and find that the impact of feedback is less\npronounced compared to the previous scenario. Specifically, the loss in secrecy\nrate, when ignoring the feedback, is quantified to be less than 0.5 bit per\nchannel use when the relay power goes to infinity. This achievable rate region\nis obtained with simple time sharing along with cooperative jamming, which,\nwith its simplicity and near optimum performance, is a viable alternative to an\nencoder that utilizes feedback signals.\n","Comment: 51 pages.

Stellar rotation\ncauses magnetic field lines anchored at the surface to form a spiral pattern\nand magneto-rotational winds can be driven. If the structure is a magnetically\ndominated, fast MHD waves generated at the surface can propagate almost\nradially outward and cross the field lines. The propagating waves undergo\ncollisionless damping owing to interactions with particles surfing on magnetic\nmirrors that are formed by the waves themselves. The damping is especially\neffective where the angle between the wave propagation and the field lines\nbecomes moderately large ($\\sim 20$ to $80^{\\circ}$). The angle tends naturally\nto increase into this range because the field in magneto-rotational winds\ndevelops an increasingly large azimuthal component. The dissipation of the wave\nenergy produces heating and acceleration of the outflow.
