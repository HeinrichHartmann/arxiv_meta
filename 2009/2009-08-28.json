In our model, the network is assumed to be one dimensional for\nthe sake of analysis. We also assume that a certain part of the available\nbandwidth is likely to be reused by different base stations while that the\nother part of the bandwidth is shared in an orthogonal way between these base\nstations. The optimal resource allocation characterized in Part I is obtained\nby minimizing the total power spent by the network under the constraint that\nall users rate requirements are satisfied. When optimal resource allocation is\nused, any user receives data either in the reused bandwidth or in the protected\nbandwidth, but not in both (except for at most one pivot-user in each cell). We\nalso proposed an algorithm that determines the optimal values of users resource\nallocation parameters. The optimal allocation algorithm proposed in Part I\nrequires a large number of operations. In the present paper, we propose a\ndistributed practical resource allocation algorithm with low complexity. We\nstudy the asymptotic behavior of both this simplified resource allocation\nalgorithm and the optimal resource allocation algorithm of Part I as the number\nof users in each cell tends to infinity. Our analysis allows to prove that the\nproposed simplified algorithm is asymptotically optimal. As a byproduct of our\nanalysis, we characterize the optimal value of the frequency reuse factor.\n"]}]

Using multi-spectral data, we analyze a\ncombination of the two events. Each of the events exhibited an evolving\ncusp-like feature. We have revealed that these apparent ``cusps'' were most\nlikely mimicked by twisted magnetic flux ropes, but unlikely to be related to\nthe inverted Y-like magnetic configuration in the standard flare model. The\nropes originated inside a funnel-like magnetic domain whose base was bounded by\nan EUV ring structure, and the top was associated with a coronal null point.\nThe ropes appear to be the major drivers for the events, but their rise was not\ntriggered by reconnection in the coronal null point. We propose a scenario and\na three-dimensional scheme for these events in which the filament eruptions and\nflares were caused by interaction of the ropes.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 11 figures"]}]

We construct such a Markov chain by transforming the standard Markov\nchain, which is obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings method. We call this\nnovel transformation pseudo-lifting. We apply our method to graphs with\ngeometry, or graphs with doubling dimension. Specifically, the convergence time\nof our algorithm (equivalently, the mixing time of our Markov chain) is\nproportional to the diameter of the network graph and hence optimal. As a\nbyproduct, our result provides the fastest mixing Markov chain given the\nnetwork topological constraints, and should naturally find their applications\nin the context of distributed optimization, estimation and control.\n"]}]
