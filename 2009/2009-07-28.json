The sample consists of 130 faint, broad-line AGN\nwith redshift up to z=5 and 17.5< I <24.0, selected on the basis of their\nspectra. In this paper we present the measurement of the Optical Luminosity\nFunction up to z=3.6 derived from this sample, we compare our results with\nprevious results from brighter samples both at low and at high redshift. Our\ndata, more than one magnitude fainter than previous optical surveys, allow us\nto constrain the faint part of the luminosity function up to high redshift. By\ncombining our faint VVDS sample with the large sample of bright AGN extracted\nfrom the SDSS DR3 (Richards et al., 2006b) and testing a number of different\nevolutionary models, we find that the model which better represents the\ncombined luminosity functions, over a wide range of redshift and luminosity, is\na luminosity dependent density evolution (LDDE) model, similar to those derived\nfrom the major X-surveys. Such a parameterization allows the redshift of the\nAGN space density peak to change as a function of luminosity and explains the\nexcess of faint AGN that we find at 1.0< z <1.5. On the basis of this model we\nfind, for the first time from the analysis of optically selected samples, that\nthe peak of the AGN space density shifts significantly towards lower redshift\ngoing to lower luminosity objects. This result, already found in a number of\nX-ray selected samples of AGN, is consistent with a scenario of \"AGN cosmic\ndownsizing\", in which the density of more luminous AGN, possibly associated to\nmore massive black holes, peaks earlier in the history of the Universe, than\nthat of low luminosity ones.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 10 figures, submitted to A&A"]}]

In\nthe first step, a combination of two methods is used to identify the centers of\npotential groups and to estimate their characteristic luminosity. Using an\niterative approach, the adaptive group finder then uses the average\nmass-to-light ratios of groups, obtained from the previous iteration, to assign\na tentative mass to each group. This mass is then used to estimate the size and\nvelocity dispersion of the underlying halo that hosts the group, which in turn\nis used to determine group membership in redshift space. Finally, each\nindividual group is assigned two different halo masses: one based on its\ncharacteristic luminosity, and the other based on its characteristic stellar\nmass. Applying the group finder to the SDSS DR4, we obtain 301237 groups in a\nbroad dynamic range, including systems of isolated galaxies. We use detailed\nmock galaxy catalogues constructed for the SDSS DR4 to test the performance of\nour group finder in terms of completeness of true members, contamination by\ninterlopers, and accuracy of the assigned masses.

We revisit this issue by analyzing both the 2dFGRS and SDSS DR5\ncatalogues using essentially identical techniques. We confirm that the 2dFGRS\nexhibits relatively more large scale power than the SDSS, or, equivalently,\nSDSS has more small scale power. We demonstrate that this difference is due to\nthe r-band selected SDSS catalogue being dominated by more strongly clustered\nred galaxies, which have a stronger scale dependent bias. The power spectra of\ngalaxies of the same rest frame colours from the two surveys match well. If not\naccounted for, the difference between the SDSS and 2dFGRS power spectra causes\na bias in the obtained constraints on cosmological parameters which is larger\nthan the uncertainty with which they are determined. We also found that the\ncorrection developed by Cole et al.(2005) to model the distortion in the shape\nof the power spectrum due to non-linear evolution and scale dependent bias is\nnot able to reconcile the constraints obtained from the 2dFGRS and SDSS power\nspectra. Intriguingly, the model is able to describe the differences between\nthe 2dFGRS and the much more strongly clustered LRG sample, which exhibits\ngreater nonlinearities. This shows that more work is needed to understand the\nrelation between the galaxy power spectrum and the linear perturbation theory\nprediction for the power spectrum of matter fluctuations. It is therefore\nimportant to accurately model these effects to get precise estimates of\ncosmological parameters from these power spectra and from future galaxy surveys\nlike Pan-STARRS, or the Dark Energy Survey, which will use selection criteria\nsimilar to the one of SDSS.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 10 figures; minor changes to match version accepted for\n  publication in MNRAS"]}]

We show that the peculiar velocity of the BCM is\nindependent of cluster richness and only slightly dependent on the Bautz-Morgan\ntype.

The strongest dependence is with the morphological\ntype of the BCM: cD galaxies tend to have lower relative peculiar velocities\nthan elliptical galaxies. This result points to a connection between the\nformation of the BCMs and that of their clusters. Our data are qualitatively\nconsistent with the merging-groups scenario, where BCMs in clusters formed\nfirst in smaller subsystems comparable to compact groups of galaxies.

Our simulations have yielded a\nnew model for quasar lifetimes where the lifetime depends on both the\ninstantaneous and peak quasar luminosities. This motivates a new interpretation\nof the QLF in which the bright end consists of quasars radiating at nearly\ntheir peak luminosities, but the faint end is mostly made up of quasars in less\nluminous phases of evolution. The faint-end QLF slope is then determined by the\nfaint-end slope of the quasar lifetime for quasars with peak luminosities near\nthe observed break. We determine this slope from the quasar lifetime as a\nfunction of peak luminosity, based on a large set of simulations spanning a\nwide variety of host galaxy, merger, BH, and ISM gas properties. Brighter peak\nluminosity (higher BH mass) systems undergo more violent evolution, and expel\nand heat gas more rapidly in the final stages of quasar evolution, resulting in\na flatter faint-end slope (as these objects fall below the observed break in\nthe QLF more rapidly). Therefore, as the QLF break luminosity moves to higher\nluminosities with increasing redshift, implying a larger typical quasar peak\nluminosity, the faint-end QLF slope flattens. From the quasar lifetime as a\nfunction of peak luminosity and this interpretation of the QLF, we predict the\nfaint-end QLF slope and its evolution with redshift in good agreement with\nobservations. Although BHs grow anti-hierarchically (with lower-mass BHs formed\nprimarily at lower redshifts), the observed change in slope and differential or\nluminosity dependent density evolution in the QLF is completely determined by\nthe luminosity-dependent quasar lifetime and physics of quasar feedback.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 4 figures, submitted to ApJ (Replacement with minor\n  revisions and changed sign convention)"]}]
