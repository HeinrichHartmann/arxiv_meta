When\napplied on a multi-dimensional database (i.e., on a multi-attribute table), the\ntraditional skyline operator selects all database objects that are not\ndominated by other objects.

Such a large discrepancy may be the result of a mixing of the bottom\nquark with heavy mirror fermions with masses of the order of the weak scale.

How, then, can such theories be\ntested? It has been variously asserted that in a future measurement we should\nobserve the a priori most probable set of predicted properties (the\n``bottom-up'' approach), or the most probable set compatible with all current\nobservations (the ``top-down'' approach), or the most probable set consistent\nwith the existence of observers (the ``anthropic'' approach). These inhabit a\nspectrum of levels of conditionalization and can lead to qualitatively\ndifferent predictions. For example, in a context in which the densities of\nvarious species of dark matter vary among members of an ensemble of otherwise\nsimilar regions, from the top-down or anthropic viewpoints -- but not the\nbottom-up -- it would be natural for us to observe multiple types of dark\nmatter with similar contributions to the observed dark matter density. In the\nanthropic approach it is also possible in principle to strengthen this argument\nand the limit the number of likely dark matter sub-components. In both cases\nthe argument may be extendible to dark energy or primordial density\nperturbations. This implies that the anthropic approach to cosmology,\nintroduced in part to explain \"coincidences\" between unrelated constituents of\nour universe, predicts that more, as-yet-unobserved coincidences should come to\nlight.\n","Comment: 18 JCAP-style pages, accepted by JCAP.

The triangle suggests the circularity of the\nwidespread view that math arises from the mind, the mind arises out of matter,\nand that matter can be explained in terms of math. Non-physicists should be\nwary of any claim that modern physics leads us to any particular resolution of\nthis circularity, since even the sample of three theoretical physicists writing\nthis paper hold three divergent views. Some physicists believe that current\nphysics has already found the basic framework for a complete description of\nreality, and only has to fill in the details. Others suspect that no single\nframework, from physics or other sources, will ever capture reality. Yet others\nguess that reality might be approached arbitrarily closely by some form of\nfuture physics, but probably based on completely different frameworks. We will\ndesignate these three approaches as the fundamentalist, secular and mystic\nviews of the world, as seen by practicing physicists. We present and contrast\neach of these views, which arguably form broad categories capturing most if not\nall interpretations of physics. We argue that this diversity in the physics\ncommunity is more useful than an ontological monoculture, since it motivates\nphysicists to tackle unsolved problems with a wide variety of approaches.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 7 figs.
