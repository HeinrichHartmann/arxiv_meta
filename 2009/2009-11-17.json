However, the gas in this regime is also subject to significant\nthree-body loss. We adopt an extended Hertz-Millis theory to account for the\neffect of loss on the transition and on the ferromagnetic state. We find that\nthe losses damp quantum fluctuations and thereby significantly increase the\ncritical interaction strength needed to induce ferromagnetism. This effect may\nresolve a discrepancy between the experiment and previous theoretical\npredictions of the critical interaction strength. We further illuminate the\nimpact of loss by studying the collective spin excitations in the ferromagnet.\nEven in the fully polarized state, where loss is completely suppressed, spin\nwaves acquire a decay rate proportional to the three-body loss coefficient.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 1 figure"]}]

Soft condensed matter physics was transformed by\nmicroscopies that allowed imaging of real-space structures and patterns. A\ncandidate technique for obtaining equivalent data in the purely electronic\nsystems is Spectroscopic Imaging Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (SI-STM). The\ncore challenge is to detect the tenuous but 'heavy' k-space components of the\nmany-body electronic state simultaneously with its r-space constituents.\nSr3Ru2O7 provides a particularly exciting opportunity to address these issues.\nIt possesses (i) a very strongly renormalized 'heavy' d-electron Fermi liquid\nand (ii) exhibits a field-induced transition to an electronic liquid\ncrystalline phase. Finally, as a layered compound, it can be cleaved to present\nan excellent surface for SI-STM.\n","Comment: Some errors fixed"]}]

In this study, we assess the practice of peer-review\nbased project selection. The basic question is \"do the best researchers get the\nfunding\"? In other words, do peer review based quality indicators predict\nsuccess in receiving funding? The next question to be answered is about the\npeer review. Do peer reviewers indeed recognize the best researchers, and\nsubsequently, is the decision of the research council based on the outcomes of\npeer review? Finally, we answer the question whether other factors influence\nthe probability of receiving funding, such as the role of co-applicants, the\neffects of gender, and the effect of the discipline of the application.\n"]}]

This leads us to build two types of n-dimensional global\nbilinear correspondences of Langlands by taking into account the irreducibility\nor the reducibility of the representations of the considered bilinear algebraic\nsemigroups. The major outcome of this global approach is the generation of\ngeneral algebraic symmetric structures, consisting of double symmetric towers\nof conjugacy class representatives of algebraic groups,so that the analytic\ntoroidal representations of these conjugacy classes are the cuspidal conjugacy\nclass representatives of these bilinear algebraic semigroups.\n","Comment: 143 pages"]}]
