The algorithm is based on the excursion set approach with moving\nbarriers whose shape is motivated by the ellipsoidal collapse model of halo\nformation. In contrast to most other merger-tree algorithms, ours takes\ndiscrete steps in mass rather than time. This allows us to quantify effects\nwhich arise from the fact that outputs from numerical simulations are usually\nin discrete time bins. In addition, it suggests a natural set of scaling\nvariables for describing the abundance of halo progenitors; this scaling is not\nas general as that associated with a spherical collapse. We test our algorithm\nby comparing its predictions with measurements in numerical simulations. The\nprogenitor mass fractions and mass functions are in good agreement, as is the\npredicted scaling law. We also test the formation-redshift distribution, the\nmass distribution at formation, and the redshift distribution of the most\nrecent major merger; all are in reasonable agreement with N-body simulation\ndata, over a broad range of masses and redshifts. Finally, we study the effects\nof sampling in discrete time snapshots. In all cases, the improvement over\nalgorithms based on the spherical collapse assumption is significant.\n","Comment: MNRAS accepted, 15 pages, 12 figures"]}]
