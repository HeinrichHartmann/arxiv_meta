The nodes know their locations, and\nthey sleep-wake cycle, waking up periodically but not synchronously. In this\nsituation, when a node has a packet to forward to the sink, there is a\ntrade-off between how long this node waits for a suitable neighbor to wake up\nand the progress the packet makes towards the sink once it is forwarded to this\nneighbr. Hence, in choosing a relay node, we consider the problem of minimizing\naverage delay subject to a constraint on the average progress. By constraint\nrelaxation, involving a Lagrange multiplier, we formulate this next hop relay\nselection problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). The exact optimal\nsolution (BF (Best Forward)) can be found, but is computationally intensive.\nNext, we consider a mathematically simplified model for which the optimal\npolicy (SF (Simplified Forward)) turns out to be a simple one-step-look-ahead\nrule. Simulations show that SF is very close in performance to BF, even for\nreasonably small node density. We then study the end-to-end performance of SF\nin comparison with two extremal policies: Max Forward (MF), which makes the\nmaximum possible progress per hop and thus reduces network energy consumption,\nand First Forward (FF), which forwards the packet to the first node to wake up,\nand thus tends to make end-to-end forwarding delays small.

Three blazars (3C 454.3, QSO 0454$-$234,\nand PKS 1510$-$089) tended to be redder when they were brighter, only during\ntheir faint states. This color behavior suggests that the contribution of a\nthermal component is strong in the faint states for those objects. Excluding\nthis \"redder-when-brighter\" phase, we found that 24 blazars tended to be bluer\nwhen they were brighter. This number corresponds to 83% among well-observed\nobjects which we observed for $>10$ nights. Thus, we conclude that the\n\"bluer-when-brighter\" trend is a universal feature for blazars. On the other\nhand, the correlation of the flux and the polarization degree is relatively\nweak; only 10 objects showed a significant positive correlation.

The single crystal and thin-film transistors employ\nthe organic gate dielectric Cytop(TM). This fluoropolymer is highly water\nrepellent and shows a remarkable electrical breakdown strength. The single\ncrystal transistors are consistently of very high electrical quality: near zero\nonset, very steep subthreshold swing (average: 1.3 nF V/(dec cm2)) and\nnegligible current hysteresis. Furthermore, extended gate bias stress only\nleads to marginal changes in the transfer characteristics.

We\nhave splitted the long last paper of the previous version in two parts to make\nit easier to understand. The results are essentially the same, although the\npresentation has changed substantially. The first three papers have not\nchanged.\n  This is a collection of five papers on the foundation of triangulated\ncategories in the context of groupoid-enriched categories, termed track\ncategories, and characteristic cohomology classes. As a main result it is shown\nthat given an additive category A with a translation functor t: A --> A and a\nclass V in translation cohomology H^3(A,t) then two simple properties of V\nimply that (A,t) is a triangulated category. The cohomology class V yields an\nequivalence class (B,[s]) where B is a track category with homotopy category A\nand [s] is the homotopy class of a pseudofunctor s: B --> B inducing t. The two\nproperties of V correspond to natural axioms on B and s which again imply that\n(A,t) is a triangulated category.\n  The five papers of this volume depend on each other by cross references, but\neach paper can be read independently of the others so that the reader is free\nto choose one of the papers to start.
