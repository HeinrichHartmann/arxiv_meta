From the dynamical\npoint of view, the transition signals the emergence of nonuniform\nhyperbolicity, so the dependence of the Lyapunov exponent with respect to\nparameters plays a central role in the analysis. Though often ill-behaved by\nconventional measures, we show that the Lyapunov exponent is in fact remarkably\nregular in a ``stratified sense'' which we define: the irregularity comes from\nthe matching of nice (analytic or smooth) functions along sets with complicated\ngeometry. This result allows us to stablish that the ``critical set'' for the\ntransition has at most codimension one, so for a typical potential the set of\ncritical energies is at most countable, hence typically not seen by spectral\nmeasures. Key to our approach are two results about the dependence of the\nLyapunov exponent of one-frequency $\\SL(2,\\C)$ cocycles with respect to\nperturbations in the imaginary direction: on one hand there is a severe\n``quantization'' restriction, and on the other hand ``regularity'' of the\ndependence characterizes uniform hyperbolicity when the Lyapunov exponent is\npositive.

Robots are\noblivious-- they do not recall the past computations -- and are allowed to move\nin a one-dimensional space. Additionally, robots cannot communicate directly,\ninstead they obtain system related information only via visual sensors. We draw\na connection between the convergence problem in robot networks, and the\ndistributed \\emph{approximate agreement} problem (that requires correct\nprocesses to decide, for some constant $\\epsilon$, values distance $\\epsilon$\napart and within the range of initial proposed values). Surprisingly, even\nthough specifications are similar, the convergence implementation in robot\nnetworks requires specific assumptions about synchrony and Byzantine\nresilience. In more details, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for\nthe convergence of mobile robots despite a subset of them being Byzantine (i.e.\nthey can exhibit arbitrary behavior). Additionally, we propose a deterministic\nconvergence algorithm for robot networks and analyze its correctness and\ncomplexity in various synchrony settings. The proposed algorithm tolerates f\nByzantine robots for (2f+1)-sized robot networks in fully synchronous networks,\n(3f+1)-sized in semi-synchronous networks. These bounds are optimal for the\nclass of cautious algorithms, which guarantee that correct robots always move\ninside the range of positions of the correct robots.\n"]}]

Thanks to the work of many authors, the problem\nremains open only when Sigma is the sphere, in which case exceptions to\nexistence are known to occur. In this paper we describe new infinite series of\nexceptions, in particular previously unknown exceptions with Sigma~ not the\nsphere and with more than three branching points. All our series come with\nsystematic explanations, based on several different techniques (including\ndessins d'enfants and decomposability) that we exploit to attack the problem,\nbesides Hurwitz's classical technique based on permutations.
