A precise determination of their resonance\nfrequencies and widths is crucial for their design. Most microlasers have a\nflat cylindrical geometry, and a two-dimensional approximation, the so-called\nmethod of the effective index of refraction, is commonly employed for numerical\ncalculations. Our aim has been an experimental test of the precision and\napplicability of a model based on this approximation. We performed very\nthorough and accurate measurements of the resonance frequencies and widths of\ntwo passive circular dielectric microwave resonators and found significant\ndeviations from the model predictions.

Active\nattempts are under way to commence the era of precision neutrino measurement\nscience which will surely widen the horizon of our knowledge about neutrinos. A\nnumber of high-precision neutrino oscillation experiments have been contrived\nto sharpen our understanding about these tiny particles.
