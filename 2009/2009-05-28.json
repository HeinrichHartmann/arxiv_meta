For this they accept to move\non a longer path with some distance to the corner, to avoid large densities and\nby this succeed in maintaining a comparatively high speed. In many models of\npedestrian dynamics the basic rule of motion is often either \"move as far as\npossible toward the destination\" or - reformulated - \"of all coordinates\naccessible in this time step move to the one with the smallest distance to the\ndestination\".

Also, we investigate the\nimpact of erroneous detection of spectrum holes and thereof missing\ncommunication opportunities on the capacity of the secondary channel.
