We can use two cameras to estimate the location of a target. We are\nthen interested in forming $n$ camera pairs where each camera belongs to\nexactly one pair, followed by forming a matching between the targets and camera\npairs so as to best estimate the locations of each of the targets. We consider\na special case of this problem where each of the cameras are placed along a\nhorizontal line $l$, and we consider two objective functions which have been\nshown to give good estimates of the locations of the targets when the distances\nbetween the targets and the cameras are sufficiently large. In the first\nobjective, the value of an assignment of a camera pair to a target is the\ntracking angle formed by the assignment. Here, we are interested in maximizing\nthe sum of these tracking angles. A polynomial time 2-approximation is known\nfor this problem. We give a quasi-polynomial time algorithm that returns a\nsolution whose value is at least a $(1-\\epsilon)$ factor of the value of an\noptimal solution for any $\\epsilon > 0$. In the second objective, the cost of\nan assignment of a camera pair to a target is the ratio of the vertical\ndistance between the target and $l$ to the horizontal distance between the\ncameras in the camera pair. In this setting, we are interested in minimizing\nthe sum of these ratios. A polynomial time 2-approximation is known for this\nproblem. We give a quasi-polynomial time algorithm that returns a solution\nwhose value is at most a $(1+\\epsilon)$ factor of the value of an optimal\nsolution for any $\\epsilon > 0$.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 10 figures"]}]
