It may be possible to identify such GW-driven\ninspirals statistically in an electromagnetic (EM) survey for variable sources.\nA GW-driven binary spends a characteristic time T_GW at each orbital separation\nr_orb < r_GW that scales with the corresponding orbital time t_orb as T_GW =\n(const) t_orb^{8/3}. If the coalescing binary produces variations in the EM\nemission on this timescale, then it could be identified as a variable source\nwith a characteristic period t_var = t_orb. The incidence rate of sources with\nsimilar inferred BH masses, showing near-periodic variability on the time-scale\nt_var, would then be proportional to t_var^{8/3}.

These fields may either be static\nmagnetic fields comparable in magnitude with the magnetic field of the earth or\nweak ultra-low frequency time-dependent fields. So far, a generally accepted\ntheoretical model allowing one to understand the effect of magnetic and\nelectric fields on biological processes is not available. By this reason, it is\nnot clear which characteristics of the fields, like magnetic and electric field\nstrength, frequency of change of the field, shape of the electromagnetic wave,\nthe duration of the magnetic or electric influence or some particular\ncombination of them, are responsible for the biological effect. In the present\nanalysis it is shown that external time-independent magnetic fields may cause a\nresonance amplification of ionic electric currents in biological tissues and,\nin particular, in the vasculature system due to a Brownian motion of charges.\nThese resonance electric currents may cause necrotic changes in the tissues or\nblood circulation and in this way significantly affect the biological organism.\nThe magnitude of the magnetic fields leading to resonance effects is estimated,\nit is shown that it depends significantly on the radius of the blood\ncapillaries.\n","Comment: 11 pages"]}]
