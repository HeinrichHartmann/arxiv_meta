The channel state information (CSI) on the link of the\nSU is assumed to be perfectly known at the SU transmitter (SU-Tx). However, due\nto loose cooperation between the SU and the PU, only partial CSI of the link\nbetween the SU-Tx and the PU is available at the SU-Tx. With the partial CSI\nand a prescribed transmit power constraint, our design objective is to\ndetermine the transmit signal covariance matrix that maximizes the rate of the\nSU while keeping the interference power to the PU below a threshold for all the\npossible channel realization within an uncertainty set. This problem, termed\nthe robust cognitive beamforming problem, can be naturally formulated as a\nsemi-infinite programming (SIP) problem with infinitely many constraints. This\nproblem is first transformed into the second order cone programming (SOCP)\nproblem and then solved via a standard interior point algorithm. Then, an\nanalytical solution with much reduced complexity is developed from a geometric\nperspective. It is shown that both algorithms obtain the same optimal solution.\nSimulation examples are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed\nalgorithms.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 7 figures"]}]

More specifically, in\nthis paper we seek to answer the following question: Given a network in which\nthe majority of nodes are controlled by a malicious adversary and whose\ntopology is changing every round, is it possible to develop a protocol with\npolynomially-bounded memory per processor that guarantees throughput-efficient\nand correct end-to-end communication? We answer the question affirmatively for\nextremely general corruption patterns: we only request that the topology of the\nnetwork and the corruption pattern of the adversary leaves at least one path\neach round connecting the sender and receiver through honest nodes (though this\npath may change at every round). Out construction works in the public-key\nsetting and enjoys bounded memory per processor (that does not depend on the\namount of traffic and is polynomial in the network size.) Our protocol achieves\noptimal transfer rate with negligible decoding error. We stress that our\nprotocol assumes no knowledge of which nodes are corrupted nor which path is\nreliable at any round, and is also fully distributed with nodes making\ndecisions locally, so that they need not know the topology of the network at\nany time.\n","Comment: Corrected typos.
