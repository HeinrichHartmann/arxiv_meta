In this paper one of the fundamental decision\nproblems on translations, namely the \"translation membership problem\" is\nstudied for mtts. For a fixed translation, the translation membership problem\nasks whether a given input/output pair is element of the translation. For\ncall-by-name mtts this problem is shown to be NP-complete. The main result is\nthat translation membership for call-by-value mtts is in polynomial time. For\nseveral extensions, such as addition of regular look-ahead or the\ngeneralization to multi-return mtts, it is shown that translation membership\nstill remains in PTIME.\n","Comment: 9 pages, appeared at International Workshop on Programming Language\n  Techniques for XML (PLAN-X 2009)"]}]
