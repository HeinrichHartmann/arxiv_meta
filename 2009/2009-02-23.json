We\nwant to examine, however, the physical basis for setting up a comoving\nreference frame and, in particular, what could be meant by a standard clock.\nFor this purpose we introduce the concept of a `core' of a clock (which, for a\nstandard clock in cosmology, is a scale-setting physical process) and we ask if\nsuch a core can--in principle--be found in the available physics contemplated\nin the various `stages' of the early universe.

Measurements using bispectrum of cosmic microwave background\nanisotropies are limited by the cosmic variance, i.e. available number of\nmodes. Recent work has emphasized the possibility to probe non-gaussianity of\nlocal type using the scale dependence of large scale bias from highly biased\ntracers of large scale structure. However, this power spectrum method is also\nlimited by cosmic variance, finite number of structures on the largest scales,\nand by the partial degeneracy with other cosmological parameters that can mimic\nthe same effect. Here we propose an alternative method that solves both of\nthese problems. It is based on the idea that on large scales halos are biased,\nbut not stochastic, tracers of dark matter: by correlating a highly biased\ntracer of large scale structure against an unbiased tracer one eliminates the\ncosmic variance error, which can lead to a high signal to noise even from the\nstructures comparable to the size of the survey. The square of error\nimprovement on non-gaussianity parameter f_nl relative to the power spectrum\nmethod scales as Pn/2, where P and n is the power spectrum and the number\ndensity of the biased tracer, respectively.

SAR-derived\nestimates of swell height, and energy-weighted peak period and direction, are\nvalidated against buoy observations, and the peak directions are used to\nproject the peak periods in one dimension along the corresponding great circle\nroute, both forward and back in time, using the peak period group velocity.

The methodology is\nfound to be consistent with the dispersive arrival of peak swell periods at a\nmid-ocean buoy. The simple great circle propagation method cannot project the\nswell heights in space like the peak periods, because energy evolution along a\ngreat circle is a function of the source storm characteristics and the unknown\nswell dissipation rate. A more general geometric optics model is thus proposed\nfor the far field of the storms. This model is applied here to determine the\nattenuation over long distances. For one of the largest recorded storms,\nobservations of 15 s period swells are consistent with a constant dissipation\nrate that corresponds to a 3300 km e-folding scale for the energy.

The stationary type distribution of the reversed process, the so-called\nancestral distribution, turns out as a key for the study of mutation-selection\nbalance. This balance can be expressed in the form of a variational principle\nthat quantifies the respective roles of reproduction and mutation for any\npossible type distribution. It shows that the mean growth rate of the\npopulation results from a competition for a maximal long-term growth rate, as\ngiven by the difference between the current mean reproduction rate, and an\nasymptotic decay rate related to the mutation process; this tradeoff is won by\nthe ancestral distribution.\n  Our main application is the quasispecies model of sequence evolution with\nmutation coupled to reproduction but independent across sites, and a fitness\nfunction that is invariant under permutation of sites. Here, the variational\nprinciple is worked out in detail and yields a simple, explicit result.\n","Comment: 45 pages,8 figures"]}]
