(Aims) The evolution of dark matter halos in phase-space, and using the\nphase-space density indicator Q=rho/sigma^3 as a tracer, is discussed.\n(Methods) We have performed cosmological N-body simulations from which we have\ncarried a detailed study of the evolution of ~35 dark halos in the interval\n0<z<10. (Results)The follow up of individual halos indicates two distinct\nevolutionary phases. First, an early and fast decrease of Q associated to\nvirialization after the gravitational collapse takes place. The nice agreement\nbetween simulated data and theoretical expectations based on the spherical\ncollapse model support such a conjecture. The late and long period where a slow\ndecrease of the phase-space density occurs is related to accretion and merger\nepisodes. The study of some merger events in the phase-space (radial velocity\nversus radial distance) reveals the formation of structures quite similar to\ncaustics generated in secondary infall models of halo formation. After mixing\nin phase-space, halos in quasi-equilibrium have flat-topped velocity\ndistributions (negative kurtosis) with respect to Gaussians. The effect is more\nnoticiable for captured satellites and/or substructures than for the host halo.\n","Comment: submitted to A&A"]}]
