In the incompressible limit, the\nLB equation is proved to be equivalent to the linearized Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook\n(BGK) equation. Therefore, when the same Gauss-Hermite quadrature is used, LB\nmethod closely assembles the discrete velocity method (DVM). In addition, the\norder of Hermite expansion for the equilibrium distribution function is found\nnot to be correlated with the approximation order in terms of the Knudsen\nnumber to the BGK equation, which was previously suggested by\n\\cite{2006JFM...550..413S}.

The numerical simulation results confirm that\nthe high-order terms in the discrete equilibrium distribution function play a\nnegligible role. Meanwhile, appropriate Gauss-Hermite quadrature has the most\nsignificant effect on whether LB models can describe the essential flow physics\nof rarefied gas accurately. For the same order of the Gauss-Hermite quadrature,\nthe exact abscissae will also modestly influence numerical accuracy. Using the\nsame Gauss-Hermite quadrature, the numerical results of both LB and DVM methods\nare in excellent agreement for flows across a broad range of the Knudsen\nnumbers, which confirms that the LB simulation is similar to the DVM process.\nTherefore, LB method can offer flexible models suitable for simulating\ncontinuum flows at Navier Stokes level and rarefied gas flows at the linearized\nBoltzmann equation level.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 15 figures"]}]

The\npurpose of this paper is to examine the applicable domains for the most general\nqubit-interchange symmetric three-qubit states. First, we compute the\neigenvalues of the non-linear eigenvalue equations and the nearest separable\nstates for the permutation invariant three-qubit states with a fixed phase.\nNext, we compute the geometric entanglement measure, deduce the boundaries of\nall subspaces, and find allocations of highly and slightly entangled states. It\nis shown that there are three applicable domains when the phase factor is\n$\\pi/2$ while other cases have only two domains. The emergence of the three\ndomains is due to the appearance of the additional W-state. We show that most\nof highly entangled states reside near the boundaries of the domains and states\nlocated far from the boundaries become less-entangled and eventually go to the\nproduct states. The neighbors of W-state are generally more entangled than the\nneighbors of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger(GHZ) state from the aspect of the\ngeometric measure. However, the range of the GHZ-neighbors is much more wider\nthan the range of the W-neighbors.\n","Comment: 31 pages, 5 figures: fig.5 is not included due to file size limit.\n  Full version can be downloaded from http://qubit.kyungnam.ac.kr"]}]

They need the ability to gain rapid and\nscalable access to high-end computing capabilities. Cloud computing promises to\ndeliver such a computing infrastructure using data centers so that HPC users\ncan access applications and data from a Cloud anywhere in the world on demand\nand pay based on what they use. However, the growing demand drastically\nincreases the energy consumption of data centers, which has become a critical\nissue. High energy consumption not only translates to high energy cost, which\nwill reduce the profit margin of Cloud providers, but also high carbon\nemissions which is not environmentally sustainable. Hence, energy-efficient\nsolutions are required that can address the high increase in the energy\nconsumption from the perspective of not only Cloud provider but also from the\nenvironment. To address this issue we propose near-optimal scheduling policies\nthat exploits heterogeneity across multiple data centers for a Cloud provider.\nWe consider a number of energy efficiency factors such as energy cost, carbon\nemission rate, workload, and CPU power efficiency which changes across\ndifferent data center depending on their location, architectural design, and\nmanagement system. Our carbon/energy based scheduling policies are able to\nachieve on average up to 30% of energy savings in comparison to profit based\nscheduling policies leading to higher profit and less carbon emissions.\n"]}]

A detailed quantitative comparison of our\nexperimental measurements with a theoretical study of the diffusive Johnson\nSegalman model leads to excellent agreement. Our study clarifies the nature of\nshear banding flow instabilities, and shows that, despite the challenging\ncomplexity of the situation and the uncertainty regarding their molecular\nstructure, shear banding flows in confined geometries are amenable to\nquantitative modelling, a feature that opens pathways to their practical\nutilization.\n"]}]

They can\nbe produced by several channels, namely as by products of hadronic interactions\nat the sources, as the main products of the decay of super massive particles\nand, in a guaranteed way, as the result of the propagation of UHECR through the\nbath of microwave relic photons. A new era of very large exposure space\nobservatories, of which the JEM-EUSO mission is a prime example, is on the\nhorizon and, with it, it is even larger the possibility of astrophysical\nneutrino detection at the highest energies. In the present work we use a\ncombination of the PYTHIA interaction code with the CONEX shower simulation\npackage in order to produce fast one-dimensional simulations of neutrino\ninitiated showers in air. We make a detail study of the structure of the\ncorresponding longitudinal profiles, but focus our physical analysis mainly on\nthe development of showers at mid and high altitudes, where they can be an\ninteresting target for space fluorescence observatories.\n","Comment: Proceedings of the 31st ICRC, Lodz, Poland, July 2009"]}]

At the highest energies the detailed simulation of air showers is very\ncostly in processing time and disk space due to the large number of secondary\nparticles generated in interactions with the atmosphere, e.g. $\\sim 10^{11}$\nfor $10^{20}$ eV proton shower. Therefore, in order to increase the statistics,\nit is quite common to recycle single showers many times to simulate the\ndetector response. In this work we present a detailed study of the artificial\neffects introduced by the multiple use of single air showers for the detector\nsimulations. In particular, we study the effects introduced by the repetitions\nin the kernel density estimators which are frequently used in composition\nstudies.\n","Comment: Proceedings of the 31st ICRC, Lodz, Poland, July 2009"]}]
