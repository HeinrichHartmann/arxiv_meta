In particular, the cosmic variances\nare found to be much larger than that for Gaussian models. On the other hand,\nthe anisotropic structure is vastly erased if one averages the fluctuations at\na number of different observing points because of the Gaussian\npseudo-randomness of the eigenmodes. Thus the dominant contribution to the\ntwo-point correlation functions comes from the isotropic terms described by the\nangular power spectra C_l.

Here we inquire what experimental constraints can be\nset on Delta for various solar system objects when this assumption is relaxed.\nExtending an analysis originally due to Nordtvedt, we obtain upper limits on\nlinearly independent combinations of Delta for two or more bodies from Kepler's\nthird law, the position of Lagrange libration points, and the phenomenon of\norbital polarization. Combining our results, we extract numerical upper bounds\non Delta for the Sun, Moon, Earth and Jupiter, using observational data on\ntheir orbits as well as those of the Trojan asteroids. These are applied as a\ntest case to the theory of higher-dimensional (Kaluza-Klein) gravity.

Nevertheless, it is easy to show\nby using a simple scaling argument that ANEC as stated cannot hold generically\nin curved four-dimensional spacetime, and this scaling argument has been widely\ninterpreted as a death-blow for averaged energy conditions in quantum field\ntheory. In this note I propose a simple generalization of ANEC, in which the\nright-hand-side of the ANEC inequality is replaced by a finite (but in general\nnegative) state-independent lower bound. As long as attention is focused on\nasymptotically well-behaved spacetimes, this generalized version of ANEC is\nsafe from the threat of the scaling argument, and thus stands a chance of being\ngenerally valid in four-dimensional curved spacetime. I argue that when\ngeneralized ANEC holds, it has implications for the non-negativity of total\nenergy and for singularity theorems similar to the implications of ANEC. In\nparticular, I show that if generalized ANEC is satisfied in static traversable\nwormhole spacetimes (which is likely but remains to be shown), then macroscopic\nwormholes (but not necessarily microscopic, Planck-size wormholes) are ruled\nout by quantum field theory.\n","Comment: 12 pages"]}]

In pre-Maxwell electrodynamics -- the local gauge theory associated\nwith this framework -- events induce five local off-shell fields, which mediate\ninteractions between instantaneous events, not between the worldlines which\nrepresent entire particle histories. The fifth field, required to compensate\nfor dependence of gauge transformations on the evolution parameter, enables the\nexchange of mass between particles and fields. In the equilibrium limit, these\npre-Maxwell fields are pushed onto the zero-mass shell, but during interactions\nthere is no mechanism regulating the mass that photons may acquire, even when\nevent trajectories evolve far into the spacelike region. This feature of the\noff-shell formalism requires the application of some ad hoc mechanism for\ncontrolling the photon mass in low energy classical Coulomb scattering of\ncharged events, and in the renormalization of off-shell quantum\nelectrodynamics. We discuss a nonlocal, higher derivative correction to the\nphoton kinetic term, which provides regulation of the photon mass in a manner\nthat preserves the gauge invariance and Poincare covariance of the original\ntheory.
