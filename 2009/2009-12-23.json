One set of particles functions as the\nquantum information processor, whose evolution is controlled by a\ntime-dependent external field. The other particles are not directly controlled\nand serve as an effective environment, coupling to which is the source of\ndecoherence. The control objective is to generate target one- and two-qubit\nunitary gates in the presence of strong environmentally-induced decoherence and\nunder physically motivated restrictions on the control field. The quantum-gate\nfidelity, expressed in terms of a novel state-independent distance measure, is\nmaximized with respect to the control field using combined genetic and gradient\nalgorithms. The resulting high-fidelity gates demonstrate the feasibility of\nprecisely guiding the quantum evolution via optimal control, even when the\nsystem complexity is exacerbated by environmental coupling. It is found that\nthe gate duration has an important effect on the control mechanism and\nresulting fidelity. An analysis of the sensitivity of the gate performance to\nrandom variations in the system parameters reveals a significant degree of\nrobustness attained by the optimal control solutions.\n","Comment: IOP LaTeX, 10 figures, 29 pages; Accepted for publication in the\n  Special Issue of the Journal of Physics B on Dynamical Control of\n  Entanglement and Decoherence by Field-Matter Interactions"]}]
