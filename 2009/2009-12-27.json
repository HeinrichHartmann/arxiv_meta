Quantum correlations are determined by a global entanglement measure\n$Q$, which quantifies the degree of entanglement of multipartite pure states.\nOur studies apply analogously to a one-dimensional system of interacting\nspinless fermions, hard-core bosons, or yet to an XXZ Heisenberg spin-1/2\nchain. Disorder is characterized by both: uncorrelated and long-range\ncorrelated random on-site energies. Dilute and half-filled chains are analyzed.\nIn half-filled clean chains, delocalization is maximum when the particles do\nnot interact, whereas multi-partite entanglement is largest when they do. In\nthe presence of uncorrelated disorder, NPC and Q show a non-trivial behavior\nwith interaction, peaking in the chaotic region.
