The first step to\nbuilding merger histories of dark matter haloes and their subhaloes is to\nidentify these structures in each of the time outputs (snapshots) produced by\nthe simulation.

We find that the best approach to (sub)halo merging\nhistories is through an analysis that goes back and forth between\nidentification and tree building rather than one which conducts a\nstraightforward sequential treatment of these two steps.

In order to\ndelineate and adapt to dynamic changes in the pervasive computing environment,\ncontext-aware applications often need to specify and check behavioral\nconsistency constraints over the contexts. This problem is challenging mainly\ndue to the distributed and asynchronous nature of pervasive computing\nenvironments. Specifically, the critical issue in checking behavioral\nconstraints is the temporal ordering of contextual activities. The contextual\nactivities usually involve multiple context collecting devices, which are\nfully-decentralized and interact in an asynchronous manner. However, existing\ncontext consistency checking schemes do not work in asynchronous environments,\nsince they implicitly assume the availability of a global clock or relay on\nsynchronized interactions.\n  To this end, we propose the Ordering Global Activity (OGA) algorithm, which\ndetects the ordering of the global activities based on predicate detection in\nasynchronous environments. The essence of our approach is the message causality\nand its on-the-fly coding as logic vector clocks in asynchronous environments.\nWe implement the Middleware Infrastructure for Predicate detection in\nAsynchronous environments (MIPA), over which the OGA algorithm is implemented\nand evaluated.

One\nof the main questions in this area is the \\emph{parallel repetition question}:\nIf the game is played $\\ell$ times in parallel, does the maximum winning\nprobability decay exponentially in $\\ell$? In the classical setting, this\nquestion was answered in the affirmative by Raz. More recently the question\narose whether the decay is of the form $(1-\\Theta(\\eps))^\\ell$ where $1-\\eps$\nis the value of the game and $\\ell$ is the number of repetitions. This question\nis known as the \\emph{strong parallel repetition question} and was motivated by\nits connections to the unique games conjecture. It was resolved by Raz who\nshowed that strong parallel repetition does \\emph{not} hold, even in the very\nspecial case of games known as XOR games.\n  This opens the question whether strong parallel repetition holds in the case\nwhen the provers share entanglement. Evidence for this is provided by the\nbehavior of XOR games, which have strong (in fact \\emph{perfect}) parallel\nrepetition, and by the recently proved strong parallel repetition of linear\nunique games. A similar question was open for games with so-called\nnon-signaling provers. Here the best known parallel repetition theorem is due\nto Holenstein, and is of the form $(1-\\Theta(\\eps^2))^\\ell$.\n  We show that strong parallel repetition holds neither with entangled provers\nnor with non-signaling provers. In particular we obtain that Holenstein's bound\nis tight. Along the way we also provide a tight characterization of the\nasymptotic behavior of the entangled value under parallel repetition of unique\ngames in terms of a semidefinite program.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 2 figures"]}]

The model assumes the\nformation of hot and dense regions moving along the beam axis with increasing\nrapidities, yFB. It has been earlier shown that this model can explain the net\nproton flow i.e. p minus pbar, ratio pbar/p and the pion rapidity spectra. In\nthis paper we have attempted to show that in addition to these quantities, this\nmodel can also successfully describe the individual rapidity spectra of\nprotons, antiprotons, Kaons, antiKaons, pions, the ratios lambdabar/lambda and\ncascadebar/cascade. The experimental data set on p, pbar, K, Kbar and Pion\nprovided by BRAHMS collaboration at the highest energy of Relativistic Heavy\nIon Collider, sqrt(SNN) = 200 GeV are used. The theoretical results fit quite\nwell with mid-rapidity data (for y < 1) of the lambdabar/lambda and the\ncascadebar/cascade ratios available (from STAR). We have used single set of\nmodel parameters including single value of the temperature parameter T for all\nthe regions of the hot and dense matter formed. The chemical potentials are\nhowever assumed to be dependent on the fireball rapidity yFB. We have analyzed\nthe contribution of the decay of the heavier resonances to the proton\n(antiproton) rapidity spectra. It is found that the rapidity spectrum of the\nproduct hadron is nearly same as that of the parent hadron. We have also\nimposed the criteria of exact strangeness conservation in every (local) region\nof the dense matter separately, which is necessary.

Wavelet analysis locally separates signal components in\nfrequency space, causing many structures to become evident that are difficult\nto observe with the naked eye. Density waves, generated at resonances with\nsaturnian satellites orbiting outside (or within) the rings, are particularly\namenable to such analysis. We identify a number of previously unobserved weak\nwaves, and demonstrate the wavelet transform's ability to isolate multiple\nwaves superimposed on top of one another. We also present two wave-like\nstructures that we are unable to conclusively identify.\n  In a multi-step semi-automated process, we recover four parameters from\nclearly observed weak spiral density waves: the local ring surface density, the\nlocal ring viscosity, the precise resonance location (useful for pointing\nimages, and potentially for refining saturnian astrometry), and the wave\namplitude (potentially providing new constraints upon the masses of the\nperturbing moons). Our derived surface densities have less scatter than\nprevious measurements that were derived from stronger non-linear waves, and\nsuggest a gentle linear increase in surface density from the inner to the mid-A\nRing. We show that ring viscosity consistently increases from the Cassini\nDivision outward to the Encke Gap. Meaningful upper limits on ring thickness\ncan be placed on the Cassini Division (3.0 m at r~118,800 km, 4.5 m at\nr~120,700 km) and the inner A Ring (10 to 15 m for r<127,000 km).\n","Comment: 43 pages, 21 figures; To appear in Icarus"]}]

A misread codon will commonly code either for the\nsame amino acid or for a similar one in terms of its biochemical properties, so\nthe structure and function of the coded protein remain relatively unaltered.\nPrevious studies have attempted to address this question more quantitatively,\nnamely by statistically estimating the fraction of randomly generated codes\nthat do better than the genetic code regarding its overall robustness. In this\npaper, we extend these results by investigating the role of amino acid\nfrequencies in the optimality of the genetic code. When measuring the relative\nfitness of the natural code with respect to a random code, it is indeed natural\nto assume that a translation error affecting a frequent amino acid is less\nfavorable than that of a rare one, at equal mutation cost. We find that taking\nthe amino acid frequency into account accordingly decreases the fraction of\nrandom codes that beat the natural code, making the latter comparatively even\nmore robust. This effect is particularly pronounced when more refined measures\nof the amino acid substitution cost are used than hydrophobicity. To show this,\nwe devise a new cost function by evaluating with computer experiments the\nchange in folding free energy caused by all possible single-site mutations in a\nset of known protein structures. With this cost function, we estimate that of\nthe order of one random code out of 100 millions is more fit than the natural\ncode when taking amino acid frequencies into account. The genetic code seems\ntherefore structured so as to minimize the consequences of translation errors\non the 3D structure and stability of proteins.\n","Comment: 31 pages, 2 figures, postscript file"]}]
