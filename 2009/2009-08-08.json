Samples of\nthe plenoptic function (POF) are seen in video and in general visual content,\nand represent large amounts of information. In this paper we propose a\nstochastic model to study the compression limits of the plenoptic function. In\nthe proposed framework, we isolate the two fundamental sources of information\nin the POF: the one representing the camera motion and the other representing\nthe information complexity of the \"reality\" being acquired and transmitted. The\nsources of information are combined, generating a stochastic process that we\nstudy in detail. We first propose a model for ensembles of realities that do\nnot change over time. The proposed model is simple in that it enables us to\nderive precise coding bounds in the information-theoretic sense that are sharp\nin a number of cases of practical interest. For this simple case of static\nrealities and camera motion, our results indicate that coding practice is in\naccordance with optimal coding from an information-theoretic standpoint. The\nmodel is further extended to account for visual realities that change over\ntime. We derive bounds on the lossless and lossy information rates for this\ndynamic reality model, stating conditions under which the bounds are tight.\nExamples with synthetic sources suggest that in the presence of scene dynamics,\nsimple hybrid coding using motion/displacement estimation with DPCM performs\nconsiderably suboptimally relative to the true rate-distortion bound.\n","Comment: submitted to IEEE Transactions in Information Theory"]}]
