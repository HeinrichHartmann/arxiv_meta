The first explanation, known as the\nmany-worlds interpretation, does not require any modification of quantum\nmechanics, and asserts that at the time of measurement the Universe splits into\nmany branches, one branch for every possible alternative. The various branches\ndo not interfere with each other because of decoherence, thus providing a\npicture broadly consistent with the observed Universe. The second explanation,\nwhich requires quantum mechanics to be modified from its presently known form,\nis that at the time of measurement the wave-function collapses into one of the\npossible alternatives. The two explanations are mutually exclusive, and up\nuntil now, no theoretical reasoning has been put forward to choose one\nexplanation over the other. In this article, we provide an argument which\nimplies that the collapse interpretation is favored over the many-worlds\ninterpretation. Our starting point is the assertion (which we justify) that\nthere ought to exist a reformulation of quantum mechanics which does not refer\nto a classical spacetime manifold. The need for such a reformulation implies\nthat quantum theory becomes non-linear on the Planck mass/energy scale.\nStandard linear quantum mechanics is an approximation to this non-linear\ntheory, valid at energy scales much smaller than the Planck scale. Using ideas\nbased on noncommutative differential geometry, we develop such a reformulation\nand derive a non-linear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation, which can explain collapse of\nthe wave-function. We also obtain an expression for the lifetime of a quantum\nsuperposition. We suggest ideas for an experimental test of this model.\n","Comment: 23 pages.

A long standing puzzle has\nbeen the extreme enrichments of 3He ions. The most extreme enrichments are\nobserved in low fluence, the so-called impulsive, events which are believed to\nbe produced at the flare site in the solar corona with little scattering and\nacceleration during transport to the Earth. In two earlier papers (Liu et al.\n2004 and 2006) we showed how such extreme enrichments can result in the model\ndeveloped by Petrosian and Liu (2004), where ions are accelerated\nstochastically by plasma waves or turbulence. In this paper we address the\nrelative distributions of the fluences of 3He and 4He ions presented by Ho et\nal. (2005) which show that while the distribution of 4He fluence like many\nother extensive characteristics of solar flare, is fairly broad, the 3He\nfluence is limited to a narrow range. Moreover, the ratio of the fluences shows\na strong correlation with the 4He fluence. One of the predictions of our model\nwas presence of steep variation of the fluence ratio with the level of\nturbulence or the rate of acceleration. We show here that this feature of the\nmodel can reproduce the observed distribution of the fluences with very few\nfree parameters. The primary reason for the success of the model in both fronts\nis because fully ionized 3He ion, with its unique charge to mass ratio, can\nresonantly interact with more plasma modes and accelerate more readily than\n4He. Essentially in most flares, all background 3He ions are accelerated to few\nMeV/nucleon range, while this happens for 4He ions only in very strong events.\nA much smaller fraction of 4He ions reach such energies in weaker events.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 5 figures, submitted to ApJ"]}]

Here, we present a model in which electrons\nare accelerated once at the base of the jet, and are cooled by synchrotron\nemission and possible adiabatic energy losses. The accelerated electrons assume\na Maxwellian distribution at low energies and possible energetic power law\ntail. These assumptions yield to a wealth of spectra, which we study in\ndetails. We identify critical values of the magnetic field, and five transition\nfrequencies in the spectra. In particular, we show that: (I) the decay of the\nmagnetic field along the jet enables, for wide jets, production of flat radio\nspectra without the need for electrons re-acceleration along the jet. (II) An\nincrease of the magnetic field above a critical value of ~10^5 G leads to a\nsharp decrease in the flux at the radio band, while the flux at higher\nfrequencies saturates to a constant value. (III) For strong magnetic field, the\nflux decays in the optical/UV band as F_nu ~ nu^{-1/2}, irrespective of the\nelectrons initial distribution. (IV) For B_0 ~ 10^4 G, the X-ray flux gradually\nsteepens.

The optical spectrum of\nSDSSJ0952+2143 exhibits several peculiarities: an exceptional ratio of [FeVII]\ntransitions over [OIII], a dramatic decrease by a factor of 10 of the\nhighest-ionization lines, a very unusual and variable Balmer line profile\nincluding a triple-peaked narrow component with two unresolved horns, and a\nlarge Balmer decrement.

The IRS\nspectrum shows a bump around ~11mu and an increase towards longer wavelengths,\nreminiscent of silicate emission.

In this field, computer-aided design (CAD) is necessary in order\nto bridge the gap between computational modeling and biological data. An\napplication named TinkerCell has been created in order to serve as a CAD tool\nfor synthetic biology. TinkerCell is a visual modeling tool that supports a\nhierarchy of biological parts. Each part in this hierarchy consists of a set of\nattributes that define the part, such as sequence or rate constants. Models\nthat are constructed using these parts can be analyzed using various C and\nPython programs that are hosted by TinkerCell via an extensive C and Python\nAPI. TinkerCell supports the notion of a module, which are networks with\ninterfaces. Such modules can be connected to each other, forming larger modular\nnetworks. Because TinkerCell associates parameters and equations in a model\nwith their respective part, parts can be loaded from databases along with their\nparameters and rate equations. The modular network design can be used to\nexchange modules as well as test the concept of modularity in biological\nsystems. The flexible modeling framework along with the C and Python API allows\nTinkerCell to serve as a host to numerous third-party algorithms.

We find that the charge dependence of the bulk binding\nenergy of eight A=48 nuclei is reasonably described with an effective\nHamiltonian derived from the CD-Bonn interaction while there is an overall\nunderbinding by about 0.4 MeV/nucleon. However, the resulting spectra exhibit\ndeficiencies that are anticipated due to: (1) basis space limitations and/or\nthe absence of effective many-body interactions; and, (2) the absence of\ngenuine three-nucleon interactions. We then introduce additive\nisospin-dependent central terms plus a tensor force to our Hamiltonian and\nachieve accurate binding energies and reasonable spectra for all three nuclei.\nThe resulting no-core shell model opens a path for applications to the\ndouble-beta ($\\beta\\beta$) decay process.\n","Comment: Revised content and added references"]}]
