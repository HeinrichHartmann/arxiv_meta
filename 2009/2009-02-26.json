We investigate this problem in a\nmodel-independent way by following quintessence field trajectories in `energy'\nphase-space. Attractor dynamics in this phase-space leads to two classes of\nacceptable models: 1) models with flat potentials, i.e. an effective\ncosmological constant, and 2) models with potentials that suddenly flatten with\na characteristic kink. The prospect of further constraining the second class of\nmodels from distance measurements and fluctuation growth rates at low redshift\n(z<3) seems poor. However, in some models of this second class, the dark energy\nmakes a significant contribution to the total energy density at high redshift.\nSuch models can be further constrained from observation of the cosmic microwave\nbackground anisotropies and from primordial nucleosynthesis. It is possible,\ntherefore, to construct models in which the dark energy at high redshift causes\nobservable effects, even if future dark energy surveys constrain w at low\nredshift to be consistent with -1 to high precision.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 6 figures.
