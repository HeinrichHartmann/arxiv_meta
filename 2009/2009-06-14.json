We will start by analyzing the linear stability of traffic models, which\nis a widely established approach to study the ability of traffic models to\ndescribe emergent traffic jams. Besides deriving a collection of useful\nformulas for stability analyses, the main attention is put on the\ncharacteristic speeds, which are related to the group velocities of the\nlinearized model equations. Most macroscopic traffic models with a dynamic\nvelocity equation appear to predict two characteristic speeds, one of which is\nfaster than the average velocity. This has been claimed to constitute a\ntheoretical inconsistency. We will carefully discuss arguments for and against\nthis view. In particular, we will shed some new light on the problem by\ncomparing Payne's macroscopic traffic model with the Aw-Rascle model and\nmacroscopic with microscopic traffic models.\n","Comment: For related work see http://www.helbing.org"]}]
