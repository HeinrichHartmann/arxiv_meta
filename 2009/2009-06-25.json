We detected 303 distinct X-ray sources by analysing six EPIC/pn\nobservations; 194 of them are members of the cluster. Stars of all spectral\ntypes, from the early-types to the late-M dwarfs, were detected. The\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test applied to the X-ray photon time series shows that, on\nshort time scales, only a relatively small fraction (ranging from 6% to 31% for\ndG and dF, respectively) of the members of NGC2516 are variable with a\nconfidence level $\\geq$99%; however, it is possible that the fraction is small\nonly because of the poor statistics. The time X-ray amplitude distribution\nfunctions (XAD) of a set of dF7-dK2 stars, derived on short (hours) and medium\n(months) time scales, seem to suggest that medium-term variations, if present,\nhave a much smaller amplitude than those on short time scales; a similar result\nis also obtained for dK3-dM stars. The amplitude variations of late-type stars\nin NGC2516 are consistent with those of the coeval Pleiades stars. Comparing\nthese data with those of ROSAT/PSPC, collected 7-8 years earlier, and of\nROSAT/HRI, just 4-5 years earlier, we find no evidence of significant\nvariability on the related time scales, suggesting that long-term variations\ndue to activity cycles similar to the solar cycle are not common among young\nstars. Indications of spectral variability was found in one star whose spectra\nat three epochs were available.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 8 figures, published in A&A"]}]

Using an analytic\nsource-surface model to calculate the magnetic topology of a small bipolar\nregion embedded in a global magnetic dipole field, we demonstrate that although\ncommon in closed-field regions close to the solar equator, bald patches are\nunlikely to occur in the open-field topology of a coronal hole.

In\naddition, feedback due to mechanical and thermal deposition of energy from jets\nand winds emitted by the accretion disk around the central SMBH is also\nexpected to occur. In this paper we improve and extend the accretion and\nfeedback physics explored in our previous papers to include also a physically\nmotivated mechanical feedback. We study the evolution of an isolated elliptical\ngalaxy with the aid of a high-resolution 1-D hydrodynamical code, where the\ncooling and heating functions include photoionization and Compton effects, and\nrestricting to models which include only radiative or only mechanical feedback.\nWe confirm that for Eddington ratios above 0.01 both the accretion and\nradiative output are forced by feedback effects to be in burst mode, so that\nstrong intermittencies are expected at early times, while at low redshift the\nexplored models are characterized by smooth, very sub-Eddington mass accretion\nrates punctuated by rare outbursts. However, the explored models always fail\nsome observational tests. If we assume the high mechanical efficiency of\n10^{-2.3}, we find that most of the gas is ejected from the galaxy, the\nresulting X-ray luminosity is far less than is typically observed and little\nSMBH growth occurs. But models with low enough mechanical efficiency to\naccomodate satisfactory SMBH growth tend to allow too strong cooling flows and\nleave galaxies at z=0 with E+A spectra more frequently than is observed.

Our results, based upon a new CCF\nmethodology for determining the time-resolved spectral lag, are summarized as\nfollows. First, the evolution in the arrival offset of prompt gamma-ray photon\ncounts between Swift-BAT 15-25 keV and 50-100 keV energy bands (intrinsic\ngamma-ray spectral lag) appears to be anti-correlated with the arrival offset\nbetween prompt 15-350 keV gamma-rays and the optical emission observed by\nTORTORA (extrinsic optical/gamma-ray spectral lag), thus effectively\npartitioning the burst into two main episodes at ~T+28+/-2 sec. Second, the\nrise and decline of prompt optical emission at ~T+10+/-1 sec and ~T+50+/-1 sec,\nrespectively, both coincide with discontinuities in the hard to soft evolution\nof the photon index for a power law fit to 15-150 keV Swift-BAT data at\n~T+8+/-2 sec and ~T+48+/-1 sec. These spectral energy changes also coincide\nwith intervals whose time-resolved spectral lag values are consistent with\nzero, at ~T+12+/-2 sec and ~T+50+/-2 sec. These results, which are robust\nacross heuristic permutations of Swift-BAT energy channels and varying temporal\nbin resolution, have also been corroborated via independent analysis of\nKonus-Wind data. This potential discovery may provide the first observational\nevidence for an implicit connection between spectral lags and GRB emission\nmechanisms in the context of canonical fireball phenomenology. Future work\nincludes exploring a subset of bursts with prompt optical emission to probe the\nunique or ubiquitous nature of this result.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures.

We find no\nsignificant increase in the central concentration of the star formation as a\nresult of the presence of a close companion.

We conclude that no one starburst definition can be devised\nwhich is objective and generally discriminant.

What is the role played by gas\nand/or stars in braking the black holes, and on which timescale does\ncoalescence occur? Can the black holes accrete on flight and shine during their\npathway to coalescence? N-Body/hydrodynamical codes have proven to be vital\ntools for studying their evolution, and progress in this field is expected to\ngrow rapidly in the effort to describe, in full realism, the physics of stars\nand gas around the black holes, starting from the cosmological large scale of a\nmerger. If detected in the new window provided by the upcoming gravitational\nwave experiments, binary black holes will provide a deep view into the process\nof hierarchical clustering which is at the heart of the current paradigm of\ngalaxy formation. They will also be exquisite probes for testing General\nRelativity, as the theory of gravity. The waveforms emitted during the\ninspiral, coalescence and ring-down phase carry in their shape the sign of a\ndynamically evolving space-time and the proof of the existence of an horizon.\n","Comment: Invited Review to appear on Advanced Science Letters (ASL), Special\n  Issue on Computational Astrophysics, edited by Lucio Mayer"]}]

The\nmutual perturbations between the embryos, combined with gravitational stirring\nby Jupiter, lead to orbital crossings and collisions that drive the growth to\nEarth-sized planets on a timescale of 10-100 million years.

This is a generic\nfeature of many models where neutrino masses arise from the spontaneous\nbreaking of ungauged lepton number at relatively low scales, such as\nspontaneously broken R-parity models. Taking these models as framework, we\nreanalyze this striking suggestion in view of the recent data on neutrino\noscillations that indicate non-zero neutrino masses. We show that, despite the\nsmallness of neutrino masses, the Higgs boson can decay mainly to the invisible\nGoldstone boson associated to the spontaneous breaking of lepton number. This\nrequires a gauge singlet superfield coupling to the electroweak doublet\nHiggses, as in the Next to Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM)\nscenario for solving the $\\mu$-problem.

We discuss how\nthe presence of the additional scalar singlet states affects the Higgs\nproduction cross sections, both for the Bjorken process and the \"associated\nproduction\". The main phenomenological novelty with respect to the MSSM comes\nfrom the fact that the spontaneous breaking of lepton number leads to the\nexistence of the majoron, denoted J, which opens new decay channels for\nsupersymmetric Higgs bosons.
