The average parton momentum for the recoil jet is\nshown to be always larger than that of the trigger jet for fixed p_T^{trig} and\ncentrality and for any measurable p_T^{assoc}(away).

We show that the expected\nutility that will actually be achieved by the agent is given by the negative\ncross-entropy from the input-output (I/O) distribution of the coupled\ninteraction system and the agent's I/O distribution. Thus, our results allow\nfor an information-theoretic interpretation of the notion of utility and the\ncharacterization of agent-environment interactions in terms of entropy\ndynamics.\n","Comment: AGI-2010. 6 pages, 1 figure"]}]

The theory admits a Veneziano\nexpansion of large N_c and large N_f, with N_f/N_c and lambda = g^2 N_c kept\nfixed. The topological structure of large N diagrams motivates a general\nconjecture: the flavor-singlet sector of a gauge theory in the Veneziano limit\nis dual to a closed string theory; single closed string states correspond to\n\"generalized single-trace\" operators, where adjoint letters and\nflavor-contracted fundamental/antifundamental pairs are stringed together in a\nclosed chain. We look for the string dual of N = 2 superconformal QCD from two\nfronts. From the bottom-up, we perform a systematic analysis of the protected\nspectrum using superconformal representation theory. We also evaluate the\none-loop dilation operator in the scalar sector, finding a novel spin chain.\n  From the top-down, we consider the decoupling limit of known brane\nconstructions.

A consistent picture emerges. We conclude\nthat the string dual is a sub-critical background with seven \"geometric\"\ndimensions, containing both an AdS_5 and an S^1 factor.

The necessary and\nsufficient conditions that guarantee weightedness were obtained by Elgot (1961)\nand refined by Taylor and Zwicker (1992). If a simple game does not have\nweights, then rough weights may serve as a reasonable substitute (see their use\nin Taylor and Zwicker, 1992). A simple game is roughly weighted if there exists\na system of weights and a threshold such that all coalitions whose combined\nweight is above the threshold are winning and all coalitions whose combined\nweight is below the threshold are losing and a tie-breaking is needed to\nclassify the coalitions whose combined weight is exactly the threshold. Not all\nsimple games are roughly weighted, and the class of projective games is a prime\nexample.\n  In this paper we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a simple game\nto have rough weights. We define two functions f(n) and g(n) that measure the\ndeviation of a simple game from a weighted majority game and roughly weighted\nmajority game, respectively.

In the past years,\nconsiderable attention has been devoted to the problem of finding efficient\ndata structures to support these searches, aiming at optimizing the encoders in\nterms of speed and memory. Hash tables, binary search trees and suffix trees\nhave been widely used for this purpose, as they allow fast search at the\nexpense of memory. Some recent research has focused on suffix arrays (SA), due\nto their low memory requirements and linear construction algorithms. Previous\nwork has shown how the LZ77 decomposition can be computed using a single SA or\nan SA with an auxiliary array with the longest common prefix information. The\nSA-based algorithms use less memory than the tree-based encoders, allocating\nthe strictly necessary amount of memory, regardless of the contents of the text\nto search/encode. In this paper, we improve on previous work by proposing\nfaster SA-based algorithms for LZ77 encoding and sub-string search, keeping\ntheir low memory requirements. For some compression settings, on a large set of\nbenchmark files, our low-memory SA-based encoders are also faster than\ntree-based encoders.

It determines amplitude of such sufficiently strong\nclassical elastic force that forbids escape of a Planck mass particle moving by\nspeed of light from end of corresponding classical elastic spring, simply\ncalled dark spring. Also, by use of a formal identity between given elastic\nforce and Schwarzschild gravitational \"force\", we introduce phenomenologically\na simple quantization rule. It states that circumference (corresponding to\nelastic force amplitude equivalent formally to Schwarzschild radius) holds\nnatural number of corresponding reduced Compton's wave length. (It is deeply\nanalogous to Bohr's quantization postulate in Bohr's atomic theory interpreted\nby de Broglie relation.) Then, very simply (by simple algebraic equations only)\nand surprisingly, we obtain such dark spring characteristics corresponding to\nbasic thermodynamical characteristics (Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and Hawking\ntemperature) for corresponding Schwarzschild black hole. Finally, simple\ncomparison between obtained dark spring characteristics and\nSusskind-Horowitz-Polchinski correspondence, a simple correspondence between\nstrings and dark spring, i.e. classical linear harmonic oscillator follows.\nSquare root of the elasticity coefficient of the dark spring corresponds to\nquotient of one string coupling g and Newtonian gravitational constant, or,\nclassical elasticity coefficient of the dark spring corresponds to reciprocal\n(inverse) value of the square root of a string state excitation level N.\n","Comment: 5 pages, no figures"]}]

The idea is to monitor directly the\nthermally-induced motion of a small portion of (a ``point'' on) each suspension\nfiber, thereby recording the random forces driving the test-mass motion close\nto each violin-mode frequency. One can then suppress the thermal noise by\noptimally subtracting the recorded fiber motions from the measured motion of\nthe test mass, i.e., from the LIGO output. The proposed method is a\nmodification of an analogous but more technically difficult scheme by\nBraginsky, Levin and Vyatchanin for reducing broad-band suspension thermal\nnoise. The efficiency of our method is limited by the sensitivity of the sensor\nused to monitor the fiber motion. If the sensor has no intrinsic noise (i.e.\nhas unlimited sensitivity), then our method allows, in principle, a complete\nremoval of violin spikes from the thermal-noise spectrum. We find that in\nLIGO-II interferometers, in order to suppress violin spikes below the\nshot-noise level, the intrinsic noise of the sensor must be less than\n\\~2*10^{-13}cm/sqrt(Hz). This sensitivity is two orders of magnitude greater\nthan that of currently available sensors.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 3 figures"]}]

The strong\ninteractions are generated by vector meson exchange within the framework of the\nstandard $SU(3)_V\\times SU(3)_A$ invariant effective Lagrangian. In the atomic\nsector, the energy levels and decay widths of kaonium are determined by an\neigenvalue equation of the Kudryavtsev--Popov type, with the strong interaction\neffects entering through the complex scattering length for $K\\bar K$ scattering\nand annihilation. The presence of two scalar mesons, $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$,\nleads to a ground state energy for the kaonium atom that is shifted above the\npoint Coulomb value by a few hundred eV.

These methods seem particularly useful to the study of chaos since\nno analytical chaotic solution is currently available. Using the well-known\nLorenz equations as an example, it is demonstrated that numerically computed\nresults and their associated statistical properties are time-step dependent.\nThere are two reasons for this behavior. First, chaotic differential equations\nare unstable so that any small error is amplified exponentially near an\nunstable manifold. The more serious and lesser-known reason is that stable and\nunstable manifolds of singular points associated with differential equations\ncan form virtual separatrices. The existence of a virtual separatrix presents\nthe possibility of a computed trajectory actually jumping through it due to the\nfinite time-steps of discrete numerical methods. Such behavior violates the\nuniqueness theory of differential equations and amplifies the numerical errors\nexplosively. These reasons imply that, even if computed results are bounded,\ntheir independence on time-step should be established before accepting them as\nuseful numerical approximations to the true solution of the differential\nequations. However, due to these exponential and explosive amplifications of\nnumerical errors, no computed chaotic solutions of differential equations\nindependent of integration-time step have been found. Thus, reports of computed\nnon-periodic solutions of chaotic differential equations are simply\nconsequences of unstably amplified truncation errors, and are not approximate\nsolutions of the associated differential equations.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 9 figures"]}]
