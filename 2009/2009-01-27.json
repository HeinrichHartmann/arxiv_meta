This\nmarker can be used to assess the ARV potency of therapies, but is easily\naffected by drug exposures, drug resistance and other factors during the\nlong-term treatment evaluation process. HIV dynamic studies have significantly\ncontributed to the understanding of HIV pathogenesis and ARV treatment\nstrategies. However, the models of these studies are used to quantify\nshort-term HIV dynamics ($<$ 1 month), and are not applicable to describe\nlong-term virological response to ARV treatment due to the difficulty of\nestablishing a relationship of antiviral response with multiple treatment\nfactors such as drug exposure and drug susceptibility during long-term\ntreatment. Long-term therapy with ARV agents in HIV-infected patients often\nresults in failure to suppress the viral load. Pharmacokinetics (PK), drug\nresistance and imperfect adherence to prescribed antiviral drugs are important\nfactors explaining the resurgence of virus. To better understand the factors\nresponsible for the virological failure, this paper develops the\nmechanism-based nonlinear differential equation models for characterizing\nlong-term viral dynamics with ARV therapy. The models directly incorporate drug\nconcentration, adherence and drug susceptibility into a function of treatment\nefficacy and, hence, fully integrate virologic, PK, drug adherence and\nresistance from an AIDS clinical trial into the analysis. A Bayesian nonlinear\nmixed-effects modeling approach in conjunction with the rescaled version of\ndynamic differential equations is investigated to estimate dynamic parameters\nand make inference. In addition, the correlations of baseline factors with\nestimated dynamic parameters are explored and some biologically meaningful\ncorrelation results are presented.

Of particular interest is a\nconcept interpreted as an operator generalization of usual Lipschitz conditions\nwhich allows to describe the behavior of solutions to the corresponding initial\nvalue problem. In particular, we present, in the most general case, existence\nof self similar solutions and study, in the sense of probability measures, the\nconvergence of dynamically scaled solutions associated with the Cauchy problem\nto those self-similar solutions, as time goes to infinity. In addition we show\nthat the properties of these self-similar solutions lead to non classical\nequilibrium stable states exhibiting power tails. These results apply to\ndifferent specific problems related to the Boltzmann equation (with elastic and\ninelastic interactions) and show that all physically relevant properties of\nsolutions follow directly from the general theory developed in this\npresentation.\n","Comment: 34 pages"]}]
