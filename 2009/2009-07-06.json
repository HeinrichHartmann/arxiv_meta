It is assumed that mutation-selection\nbalance is reached in the presence of a fixed background concentration of\nantibiotic, to which the population must become resistant in order to survive.\nWe analyze the behavior of the model in the limit of low and high\nantibiotic-induced first-order death rate constants, and find that the highest\nmean fitness is obtained at low rates of bacterial conjugation. As the rate of\nconjugation crosses a threshold, the mean fitness decreases to a minimum, and\nthen rises asymptotically to a limiting value as the rate of conjugation\nbecomes infinitely large. However, this limiting value is smaller than the mean\nfitness obtained in the limit of low conjugation rate. This dependence of the\nmean fitness on the conjugation rate is fairly small for the parameter ranges\nwe have considered, and disappears as the first-order death rate constant due\nto the presence of antibiotic approaches zero. For large values of the\nantibiotic death rate constant, we have obtained an analytical solution for the\nbehavior of the mean fitness that agrees well with the results of simulations.\nThe results of this paper suggest that conjugation-mediated HGT has a slightly\ndeleterious effect on the mean fitness of a population at mutation-selection\nbalance. Therefore, we argue that HGT confers a selective advantage by allowing\nfor faster adaptation to a new or changing environment. The results of this\npaper are consistent with the observation that HGT can be promoted by\nenvironmental stresses on a population.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 4 figures"]}]

One is two-dimensional MHD code that are performed using the\nNewtonian (ZEUS-2D) code where realistic equation of state, neutrino cooling\nand heating processes are taken into account. The other one is two-dimensional\ngeneral relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) code. I have performed\nnumerical simulations of collapsars using these codes and realistic progenitor\nmodels. In the Newtonian code, it is found that neutrino heating processes are\nnot efficient enough to launch a jet in this study. It is also found that a jet\nis launched mainly by toroidal fields that are amplified by the winding-up\neffect. However, since the ratio of total energy relative to the rest-mass\nenergy in the jet is not as high as several hundred, we conclude that the jets\nseen in this study are not GRB jets. In the GRMHD simulation, it is shown that\na jet is launched from the center of the progenitor. We also find that the mass\naccretion rate after the launch of the jet shows rapid time variability that\nresembles to a typical time profile of a GRB. We find that the energy flux per\nunit rest-mass flux is as high as 10^2 at the bottom of the jet. Thus we\nconclude that the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet can be potentially high when\nit propagates outward. We also performed two-dimensional relativistic\nhydrodynamic simulations of the collapsar model to investigate the explosive\nnucleosynthesis happened there. It is found that the amount of 56Ni is very\nsensitive to the energy deposition rate. Thus the synthesized 56Ni can be\nlittle even if the total explosion energy is as large as 10^52 erg.

It can be defined for a smooth field as the ensemble of pairs of\nfield lines departing from saddle points, initially aligned with the major axis\nof local curvature and connecting them to local maxima. This definition is thus\nnon local and makes analytical predictions difficult, so we propose a local\napproximation: the local skeleton is given by the set of points where the\ngradient is aligned with the local curvature major axis and where the second\ncomponent of the local curvature is negative.\n  We perform a statistical analysis of the length of the total local skeleton,\nchosen for simplicity as the set of all points of space where the gradient is\neither parallel or orthogonal to the main curvature axis. In all our numerical\nexperiments, which include Gaussian and various non Gaussian realizations such\nas \\chi^2 fields and Zel'dovich maps, the differential length is found within a\nnormalization factor to be very close to the probability distribution function\nof the smoothed field. This is in fact explicitly demonstrated in the Gaussian\ncase.\n  This result might be discouraging for using the skeleton as a probe of non\nGausiannity, but our analyses assume that the total length of the skeleton is a\nfree, adjustable parameter.

Under some (relatively mild)\nadditional assumptions on A, we reduce the problem of classifying such rings\n(in the sense explained in the paper) to the following geometric question,\nwhich we believe to be of independent interest.\n  Let X is a smooth irreducible projective variety. An automorphism f: X -> X\nis called wild if it X has no proper f-invariant subvarieties. We conjecture\nthat if X admits a wild automorphism then X is an abelian variety. We prove\nseveral results in support of this conjecture; in particular, we show that the\nconjecture is true if X is a curve or a surface. In the case where X is an\nabelian variety, we describe all wild automorphisms of X.\n  In the last two sections we show that if A is projectively simple and admits\na balanced dualizing complex, then Proj(A) is Cohen-Macaulay and Gorenstein.\n","Comment: Some new material has been added in Section 1; to appear in Advances\n  in Mathematics"]}]
