We find a new\nmode associated with lattice point diffusion (and thus vacancy diffusion); it\nmay explain the absence of supersolid behavior in low-frequency pressure-driven\nflow. (2) The observed upper limit for the NCRI fraction (NCRIf) of about 20%,\nin disordered samples, is more-or-less the same as the already predicted upper\nlimit for the superfluid fraction of a well-ordered crystal; we argue that this\nmay not be a coincidence. (3) The negative experimental evidence for a second\npropagating hydrodynamic mode (expected to be fourth sound-like) may be due to\nthe long relaxation times $\\tau$ at low temperature $T$; only for frequencies\nsatisfying $\\omega\\tau\\ll1$ does the hydrodynamic theory apply. (4) The\nfundamental principles of quantum mechanics imply that Bose-Einstein\ncondensation is not necessary to define a quantum-mechanical phase; therefore\nthe absence of a finite condensate fraction $f_{0}$ does not necessarily imply\nthe absence of superfluidity. (5) Just as vortices should avoid occupied\nlattice sites to provide a vortex-lattice interaction, the lattice should\ninteract with the vortices to provide a lattice-vortex interaction; thus\ndislocations should interact with vortices, whose motion is affected by\nrotation.

In addition to point predictions,\nquantifications of uncertainty are also needed. One way to accomplish this is\nto provide multiple simulations of the relevant meteorological quantities\nconditional on the observed data taking into account the various uncertainties\nin predicting a space-time process at locations with no monitoring data. Using\na high-quality dataset of minute-by-minute measurements of atmospheric pressure\nin north-central Oklahoma, this work describes a statistical approach to\ncarrying out these conditional simulations. Based on observations at 11\nstations, conditional simulations were produced at two other sites with\nmonitoring stations. The resulting point predictions are very accurate and the\nmultiple simulations produce well-calibrated prediction uncertainties for\ntemporal changes in atmospheric pressure but are substantially overconservative\nfor the uncertainties in the predictions of (undifferenced) pressure.\n","Comment: Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/08-AOAS208 the Annals of\n  Applied Statistics (http://www.imstat.org/aoas/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)"]}]

The inflationary\nparadigm, inspired in part by the extreme isotropy of the CMB, is now a\ncornerstone in modern cosmology. Inflation has passed a series of rigorous\nexperimental tests, but we still do not understand the physical mechanism or\nenergy scale behind inflation. A general prediction of inflation and one that\ncan provide certain insights into inflationary physics is a background of\nprimordial gravitational waves. These perturbations leave a distinct signature\nin the CMB B-modes of polarization. The EPIC (Experimental Probe of\nInflationary Cosmology) study team has investigated several CMB polarization\nmission concepts to carry out a definitive measurement of the inflationary\nB-mode polarization spectrum. In this report we study a mission with an\naperture intermediate between the two missions discussed in our previous\nreport. EPIC-IM's increased aperture allows access to a broader science case\nthan the small EPIC-Low Cost mission. In addition to the search for\ninflationary gravitational waves, the increase aperture allows us to mine the\nscale polarization and lensing shear polarization signals down to cosmological\nlimits, so that we extract virtually all the cosmological information available\nfrom the CMB. In addition, a modest number of channels operating at higher\nfrequencies allows for an all-sky measurement of polarized Galactic dust, which\nwill provide a rich dataset for Galactic science related to magnetic fields.\nUsing a combination of a large sensitivity focal plane with a new optical\ndesign, and an efficient 4K mechanical cooler, EPIC-IM realizes higher\nsensitivity than EPIC-Comprehensive Science mission.\n","Comment: 157 pages.

Incident spectra from parent star\nflares, supernovae, and gamma-ray bursts are modeled and compared to energetic\nparticles in importance. We find that terrestrial-like exoplanets with\natmospheres thinner than about 100 g cm^-2 transmit and reprocess a significant\nfraction of incident gamma-rays, producing a characteristic, flat surficial\nspectrum. Thick atmospheres (>~ 100 g cm^-2) efficiently block even gamma-rays,\nbut nearly all incident energy is redistributed into diffuse UV and visible\naurora-like emission, increasing the effective atmospheric transmission by many\norders of magnitude. Depending on the presence of molecular UV absorbers and\natmospheric thickness, up to 10% of the incident energy can reach the surface\nas UV reemission. For the Earth, between 2 x 10^-3 and 4 x 10^-2 of the\nincident flux reaches the ground in the biologically effective 200--320 nm\nrange, depending on O_2/O_3 shielding.
