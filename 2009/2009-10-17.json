Using this\nprocedure, the Lorentz force is no longer separate from Maxwell's equations.\nThe Lorentz transformations are shown to be related to the convective\nderivative, which is introduced in the electrodynamics of moving bodies. The\nnew formulation is in complete agreement with the actual set of Maxwell's\nequations for bodies at rest, the only novel feature is a new kind of\nelectromotive force. Heinrich Hertz was the first to propose a similar\nelectrodynamic theory of moving bodies, although its interpretation was based\non the existence of the so called \"aether\". Examining the problem of a moving\ncircuit with this procedure, it is shown that a new force of induction should\nact on a circuit moving through an inhomogeneous vector potential field. This\noverlooked induction force is related to the Aharanov-Bohm effect, but can also\nbe related to the classical electromagnetic field when an external magnetic\nfield is acting on the system. Technological issues, such as the so called\nMarinov motor are also addressed.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 2 figures; typos, 2 figures and 1 reference added. Submitted\n  to review"]}]
