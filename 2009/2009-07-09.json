What\nis important is that, contrary to the Nielsen--Kempe majorization criterion and\nentropic inequalities, our criteria allow for the detection of entangled states\nwith positive partial transposition when using indecomposable positive maps. We\nalso point out that if a state with at least one maximally mixed subsystem is\ndetected by some necessary criterion based on the positive map $\\Lambda$, then\nthere exist entropic inequalities derived from $\\Lambda$ (by both procedures)\nthat also detect this state.

The latter\ninvolves point-like brane defects (D-particles), which provide the\ntopologically non-trivial foamy structures of space-time. A stochastic Langevin\nequation for the velocity recoil of D-particles can be derived from the pinched\napproximation for a sum over genera in the calculation of the partition\nfunction of a bosonic string in the presence of heavy D-particles. The string\ncoupling in standard perturbation theory is related to the exponential of the\nexpectation of the dilaton. Inclusion of fluctuations of the dilaton itself and\nuncertainties in the string background will then necessitate fluctuations in\n$g_{s}$. The fluctuation in the string coupling in the sum over genera\ntypically leads to a generic structure of the Langevin equation where the\ncoefficient of the noise term, dependent on the string coupling $g_{s}$,\nfluctuates.

In its linear regime, angular momentum transport in\nMHD turbulent accretion flow involves the generation of radial magnetic field\nconnecting plasma in a differentially rotating flow. We take a first principles\napproach, highlighting the constraint that limits the generation and\namplification of radial magnetic fields, stemming from the transfer of energy\nfrom mechanical to magnetic form. Because the energy transferred in magnetic\nform is ultimately constrained by gravitational potential energy or Killing\nenergy, the spin-dependence of the latter allows us to derive spin-dependent\nconstraints on the success of the accreting plasma to expel its angular\nmomentum and accrete. We find an inverse relationship between this ability and\nblack hole spin. If this radial magnetic field generation forms the basis for\nangular momentum transfer in accretion flows, accretion rates involving Kerr\nblack holes are expected to be lower as the black hole spin increases in the\nprograde sense.\n","Comment: Phys.RevD accepted"]}]

In total, abundance measurements or upper\nlimits have been determined for 57 elements, far more than previously possible.\nNew Be and Li detections in CS 22892-052 indicate that the abundances of both\nthese elements are significantly depleted compared to unevolved main-sequence\nturnoff stars of similar metallicity. Abundance comparisons show an excellent\nagreement between the heaviest n-capture elements (Z >= 56) and scaled solar\nsystem r-process abundances, confirming earlier results for CS 22892-052 and\nother metal-poor stars. New theoretical r-process calculations also show good\nagreement with CS 22892-052 abundances as well as the solar r-process abundance\ncomponents.The abundances of lighter elements (40<= Z <= 50), however, deviate\nfrom the same scaled abundance curves that match the heavier elements,\nsuggesting different synthesis conditions or sites for the low-mass and\nhigh-mass ends of the abundance distribution. The detection of Th and the upper\nlimit on the U abundance together imply a lower limit of 10.4 Gyr on the age of\nCS 22892-052, quite consistent with the Th/Eu age estimate of 12.8 +/- ~= 3\nGyr.

In particular, our results indicate that asymptotic\nsilence holds, i.e., that particle horizons along all timelines shrink to zero\nfor generic solutions. Moreover, we provide evidence that spatial derivatives\nbecome dynamically insignificant along generic timelines, and that the\nevolution into the past along such timelines is governed by an asymptotic\ndynamical system which is associated with an invariant set -- the silent\nboundary.
