This explains why the slower signs\ncan produce sentences in the same time as speaking; the low redundancy\ncompensates for the slow rate of sign production. In addition to this precise\nquantification, this work is also novel in its approach towards quantifying an\naspect of the ASL alphabet.

In\nthis way we make precise and concrete the notion of a non-perturbative gauge\ninvariant continuum Wilsonian effective action. Manifestly gauge invariant\ncalculations may be performed, without gauge fixing, and receive a natural\ninterpretation in terms of fluctuating Wilson loops. Regularization is achieved\nby covariant higher derivatives and by embedding in a spontaneously broken\nSU(N|N) supergauge theory; the resulting heavy fermionic vectors are\nPauli-Villars fields. We prove the finiteness of this method to one loop and\nany number of external gauge fields. A duality is uncovered that changes the\nsign of the squared coupling constant. As a test of the basic formalism we\ncompute the one loop beta function, for the first time without any gauge\nfixing, and prove its universality with respect to cutoff function.\n","Comment: TeX, harvmac, epsf; 73 pages, 25 figs; several clarifying sentences\n  added"]}]
