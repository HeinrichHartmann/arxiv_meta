The analysis of\nfrequency-rank distributions shows that the text sizes are enough to observe\nstatistical properties. The power-law character of these distributions (Zipf's\nlaw) holds in the region of rank variable r=20 - 3000 with an exponent\n$\\alpha\\simeq 1$. This substantiates the choice of the above texts to analyse\ntypical properties of the language complex network on their basis. Besides, an\napplicability of the Simon model to describe non-asymptotic properties of word\ndistributions is evaluated.\n  In describing language as a complex network, usually the words are associated\nwith nodes, whereas one may give different meanings to the network links.

The system has two\ndifferent types of ground states. The 1st type of ground state is a 1/3-factor\nLaughlin function, and has the property of chiral - anti-chiral interchange\nantisymmetry, while the 2nd type is shown to be a 1/4-factor wave function with\nchiral - anti-chiral symmetry. The fractional statistics corresponding to the\nfractional spin Hall states are studied in detail, and are discovered to be\ndifferent from that corresponding to the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states.\nTherefore the present FSHE can be distinguished from FQH regime in the\nmeasurement.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 2 figures, to appear in Phys.

The answer given here is in the form of an\nobstruction theory, of somewhat wider application, formulated in terms of\ngeneralized Pi-algebras. This extends a program begun in [J. Pure Appl. Alg.\n103 (1995) 167-188] and [Topology 43 (2004) 857-892] to study the realization\nof a single Pi-algebra.
