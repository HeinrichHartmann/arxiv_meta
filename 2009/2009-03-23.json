In this problem, each of two separate\ntransmitters observes a different component of a memoryless bivariate Gaussian\nsource as well as the feedback from the channel output of the previous\ntime-instants. Based on the observed source sequence and the feedback, each\ntransmitter then describes its source component to the common receiver via an\naverage-power constrained Gaussian multiple-access channel. From the resulting\nchannel output, the receiver wishes to reconstruct both source components with\nthe least possible expected squared-error distortion. We study the set of\ndistortion pairs that can be achieved by the receiver on the two source\ncomponents.\n  We present sufficient conditions and necessary conditions for the\nachievability of a distortion pair. These conditions are expressed in terms of\nthe source correlation and of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the channel.\nIn several cases the necessary conditions and sufficient conditions coincide.\nThis allows us to show that if the channel SNR is below a certain threshold,\nthen an uncoded transmission scheme that ignores the feedback is optimal.

We examine the locality assumption in Bell-type\nproofs for entangled qubits, i.e. the outcome of a qubit at one end is\nindependent of the basis choice at the other end. It has recently been claimed\nthat in order to properly incorporate the phenomenon of self-observation, the\nHeisenberg picture with time going backwards provides a consistent description.\nWe show that, if this claim holds true, the assumption in nonlocality proofs\nthat basis choices at two ends are independent of each other may no longer be\ntrue, and may pose a threat to the validity of Bell-type proofs.\n","Comment: 6 pages"]}]
