According to these behaviors, polyelectrolytes of fixed chain\nlength are classified into three categories: flexible chain, semiflexible\nchain, and rigid chain.

The chain\nstiffness influences both the local and the global chain structures.

The second general\nset of methodology addresses the combination of multiple levels of data to\ndetermine system reliability. We then present developments for complex systems\nbeyond traditional series/parallel representations through the use of Bayesian\nnetworks and flowgraph models. We also include methodological contributions to\nresource allocation considerations for system relability assessment. We\nillustrate each method with applications primarily encountered at Los Alamos\nNational Laboratory.\n","Comment: Published at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/088342306000000439 in the\n  Statistical Science (http://www.imstat.org/sts/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)"]}]

It is shown that deep\ninside the thermal boundary layer, horizontal heat-fuxes exceed the average\nvertical heat-fux by a factor 3 due to the interaction between the wind and the\nmean temperature field. These large horizontal heat-fluxes are responsible for\nspatial temperature differences that drive the wind by creating pressure\ngradients. The wall fluxes and turbulent mixing in the bulk provide damping.\nUsing the DNS results to parameterise the unclosed terms, a simple model\ncapturing the essential processes governing the wind structure is derived. The\nmodel consists of two coupled differential equations for wind velocity and\ntemperature amplitude. The equations indicate that the formation of a wind\nstructure is inevitable due to the positive feedback resulting from the\ninteraction between the wind and temperature field. Furthermore, the wind\nvelocity is largely determined by the turbulence in the bulk rather than by the\nwall-shear stress.

We do this by proving a tight bound of Theta(sqrt(n)) on\nthe space needed for so-called pebbling contradictions over pyramid graphs of\nsize n. This yields the first polynomial lower bound on space that is not a\nconsequence of a corresponding lower bound on width, another well-studied\nmeasure in resolution, as well as an improvement of the weak separation in\n(Nordstrom 2006) of space and width from logarithmic to polynomial.\n  Also, continuing the line of research initiated by (Ben-Sasson 2002) into\ntrade-offs between different proof complexity measures, we present a simplified\nproof of the recent length-space trade-off result in (Hertel and Pitassi 2007),\nand show how our ideas can be used to prove a couple of other exponential\ntrade-offs in resolution.\n"]}]

The details of the construction of the torsion\nbalance apparatus, the experimental procedure and the analysis to obtain the\nCasimir force as a function of separation are described. There are indications\nof the finite temperature effects which become important for separations\ngreater than ~ 3microns. The combined import of this experiment with others at\nshorter distances is to favor the finite temperature theory of Casimir forces.\nThe contributions of this experiment towards bounding the strength of inverse\nsquare law short-range violating interactions are presented.\n","Comment: Graduate thesis work done in Indian Institute of Astrophysics,\n  submitted in May 2004"]}]

Here, the eigenvectors of the precoder matrix\ncorrespond to the dominant eigenvectors of the transmit covariance matrix,\nwhereas the power allocation across the modes is fixed, known at both the ends,\nand is of low-complexity. A particular case of the proposed scheme (semiunitary\nprecoding), where the spatial modes are excited with equal power, is shown to\nbe near-optimal in matched channels. A matched channel is one where the\ndominant eigenvalues of the transmit covariance matrix are well-conditioned and\ntheir number equals the number of independent data-streams, and the receive\ncovariance matrix is also well-conditioned. In mismatched channels, where the\nabove conditions are not met, it is shown that the loss in performance with\nsemiunitary precoding when compared with a perfect channel information\nbenchmark is substantial.

The model also suggests that at small strains,\ncross-link deformation is the main contributer to network stiffness whereas at\nlarge strains, fiber stretching dominates.

This\npaper explores the use of metaphor in information visualization, advancing the\ntheory previously argued by Johnson, Lakoff, Tversky et al. that many\ninformation graphics are metaphorically understood in terms of cognitively\nentrenched spatial patterns known as image schemas. These patterns serve to\nstructure and constrain abstract reasoning processes via metaphorical\nprojection operations that are grounded in everyday perceptual experiences with\nphenomena such as containment, movement, and force dynamics. Building on\nprevious research, I argue that information graphics promote comprehension of\ntheir target information through the use of graphical patterns that invoke\nthese preexisting schematic structures. I further theorize that the degree of\nstructural alignment of a particular graphic with one or more corresponding\nimage schemas accounts for its perceived degree of intuitiveness. Accordingly,\nimage schema theory can provide a powerful explanatory and predictive framework\nfor visualization research. I review relevant theories of analogy and metaphor,\nand discuss the image schematic properties of several common types of\ninformation graphic.

Towards\nthis goal, we consider a frame coefficient space over which minimaxity is\nproved. The choice of this space is inspired by the characterization provided\nin \\cite{BorupNielsen} of family of smoothness spaces on $\\mathbb{R}^d$, a\nsubclass of so-called decomposition spaces \\cite{Feichtinger}. These smoothness\nspaces cover the classical case of Besov spaces, as well as smoothness spaces\ncorresponding to curvelet-type constructions. Our main theoretical result\ninvestigates the minimax rates over these decomposition spaces, and shows that\nour block estimator can achieve the optimal minimax rate, or is at least\nnearly-minimax (up to a $\\log$ factor) in the least favorable situation.\nAnother contribution is that the minimax rates given here are stated for a\ngeneral noise sequence model in the transform coefficient domain beyond the\nusual i.i.d.

We provide a simple, fast\nand a practical procedure. We also report a comprehensive simulation study to\nsupport our theoretical findings.

We also show\nthat the method always finds a kernel matrix that linearly separates the\ntraining data exactly without projecting them in infinite dimensional spaces.\nIn traditional SVMs we choose a kernel and hope that the data become linearly\nseparable in the kernel space. In this paper we show how the hyperplane can be\nchosen ad-hoc and the kernel is trained so that data are always linearly\nseparable. Comparisons with Large Margin SVMs show comparable performance.\n","Comment: Submitted to the NIPS workshop on Kernel Learning:Automatic Selection\n  Of Kernels and now presented in MLSP 2009"]}]

In nonlinear electrokinetic phenomena, such as AC\nor induced-charge electro-osmosis (ACEO, ICEO) and induced-charge\nelectrophoresis (ICEP), several Volts $\\approx 100 kT/e$ are applied to\npolarizable surfaces in microscopic geometries, and the resulting electric\nfields and induced surface charges are large enough to violate the assumptions\nof the classical theory. In this article, we review the literature, highlight\ndiscrepancies between theory and experiment, introduce possible modifications\nof the theory, and analyze their consequences. We argue that, in response to a\nlarge applied voltage, the \"compact layer\" and \"shear plane\" effectively\nadvance into the liquid, due to the crowding of counter-ions. Using simple\ncontinuum models, we predict two general trends, each enhanced by dielectric\nresponse: (i) ionic crowding against a blocking surface expands the diffuse\ndouble layer and thus decreases its differential capacitance, and (ii) a\ncharge-induced viscosity increase near the surface reduces the electro-osmotic\nmobility. The first effect is able to predict high-frequency flow reversal in\nACEO pumps, while the second may explain the decay of ICEO flow with increasing\nsalt concentration. Through examples, such as ICEP of an uncharged metal sphere\nin an asymmetric electrolyte, we show that ICEO flows are ion-specific. Similar\nissues arise in nanofluidics (due to confinement) and ionic liquids (due to the\nlack of solvent), so the paper concludes with a general framework of modified\nelectrokinetic equations for finite-sized ions.\n","Comment: Review with original material, expanded v2: 83 pages, 24 figs, 345\n  refs"]}]

Only interferometric observations provide the necessary\nangular resolution to resolve the nuclear dust and to study its distribution\nand properties. The investigation of dust in AGN cores is hence one of the main\nscience goals for the MID-infrared Interferometric instrument MIDI at the VLTI.\nAs the first step, the feasibility of AGN observations was verified and the\nmost promising sources for detailed studies were identified. This was carried\nout in a \"snapshot survey\" with MIDI using Guaranteed Time Observations. In the\nsurvey, observations were attempted for 13 of the brightest AGN in the\nmid-infrared which are visible from Paranal. The results of the three\nbrightest, best studied sources have been published in separate papers. Here we\npresent the interferometric observations for the remaining 10, fainter AGN. For\n8 of these, interferometric measurements could be carried out. Size estimates\nor limits on the spatial extent of the AGN-heated dust were derived from the\ninterferometric data of 7 AGN. These indicate that the dust distributions are\ncompact, with sizes on the order of a few parsec. The derived sizes roughly\nscale with the square root of the luminosity in the mid-infrared, s ~ sqrt(L),\nwith no clear distinction between type 1 and type 2 objects.

For three sources, the 10 micron feature due to silicates is tentatively\ndetected either in emission or in absorption.

Our analysis is based on postulates about a physical\nmeaning of the magnetostatic-potential function as a complex scalar wave\nfunction, which presumes the long-range phase correlations. An important\nfeature of the MDM oscillations in a ferrite disk concerns the fact that a\nstructure with symmetric parameters and symmetric basic equations goes into\neigenstates that are not space-time symmetric.

Two-way ranging time\ncarries along with it information about light's dynamical transformation, thus\na comparison of distance measured by ranging with that by parallax, a\ngeometrical method can reveal the correctness of assumptions underlying the\ndynamical behaviour of light. Two-way ranging times unaffected by the 370 kms-1\nvelocity indicate null results and further buttress Einstein's relativity\ntheory, while ranging times affected by this velocity indicate non-null results\nand will manifest as a general increase of ranging distance above actual\ngeometric lunar distance, up to 500 metres in RA 11h 11.649m and 23h 11.649m\ncoordinate directions.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 9 figures"]}]

Previously noted anomalies, such as drifts toward lower frequencies\nas the oscillations disappear (``spin-down'' episodes) and instances of two\nsignals present simultaneously at frequencies separated by a few Hz, occur in\n5% of oscillations. Having verified the generally accepted description of burst\noscillations, we proceed to study the coherence of the oscillations during\nindividual bursts, and the dispersion in the asymptotic frequencies in bursts\nobserved over five years. On short time scales, we find that 30% of the\noscillation trains do not appear to evolve smoothly in phase. This suggests\neither that two signals are present simultaneously with a frequency difference\ntoo small to resolve (< 1 Hz), that the frequency evolution is discontinuous,\nor that discrete phase jumps occur. On time scales of years, the maximum\nfrequencies of the oscillations exhibit fractional dispersions of < 0.004. In\nthe case of 4U 1636-536, this dispersion is uncorrelated with the known orbital\nphase, which indicates that a mechanism besides orbital Doppler shifts prevents\nthe oscillations from appearing perfectly stable.

On average, galaxies with optical classifications from Sa\nthrough Scd appear about one T-type earlier in the H-band than in the B-band,\nbut with large scatter. This result does not support recent claims made in the\nliterature that the optical and near-IR morphologies of spiral galaxies are\nuncorrelated.

We apply the first two of the methods to Sgr A*,\nthe super massive black hole in our Galactic Center. Using the orbital\nparameters of the close star S2, we strongly rule out a disk optically thick in\nthe near infrared unless it has a relatively large inner hole. For disks with\nno inner holes, we estimate that the data permit a disk with infrared optical\ndepth no larger than about 0.01. Such a disk could also be responsible for the\ndetected 3.8 microns excess in the spectrum of S2. The constraints on the disk\nthat we obtain here can be reconciled with the disk parameters needed to\nexplain the observed X-ray flares if dust particles in the disk have sizes\ngreater than ~ 30 microns. The destruction of small dust particles by strong UV\nheating and shocks from star passages through the disk, and grain growth during\n\"quiescent\" times, are mentioned as possible mechanisms of creating the unusual\ngrain size distribution.

We start by looking at the\nproperties of galaxies in the cores of rich clusters. We have focused on the\noverall picture: star formation in clusters is strongly suppressed relative to\nfield galaxies at the same redshift. We will argue that the increasing activity\nand blue populations of clusters with redshift results from a greater level of\nactivity in field galaxies rather than a change in the transformation imposed\nby the cluster environment. With this in mind, we travel out from the cluster\nfocussing firstly on the properties of galaxies in the outskirts of clusters\nand then on galaxies in isolated groups. At low redshift, we are able to\nefficiently probe these environments using the Sloan and 2DF redshift surveys.\nThese allow an accurate comparison of galaxy star formation rates in different\nregions. The current results show a strong suppression of star formation above\na critical threshold in local density. The threshold seems similar regardless\nof the overall mass of the system. At low redshift at least, only galaxies in\nclose, isolated pairs have their star formation rate boosted above the global\naverage. At higher redshift, work on constructing homogeneous catalogues of\ngalaxies in groups and in the infall regions of clusters is still at an early\nstage. In the final section, we draw these strands together, summarising what\nwe can deduce about the mechanisms that transform star forming field galaxies\ninto their quiescent cluster counter-parts. We discuss what we can learn about\nthe impact of environment on the global star formation history of the universe.\n","Comment: Invited review talk to be published in the Carnegie Observatories\n  Astrophysics Series, Vol. 3: Clusters of Galaxies: Probes of Cosmological\n  Structure and Galaxy Evolution, ed.

The derivation of plasma\nredshift is based entirely on conventional axioms of physics. When photons\npenetrate a cold and dense plasma, they lose energy through ionization and\nexcitation, Compton scattering on the individual electrons, and Raman\nscattering on the plasma frequency. But in sparse hot plasma, such as in the\nsolar corona, the photons lose energy also in plasma redshift. The energy loss\nper electron in the plasma redshift is about equal to the product of the\nphoton's energy and one half of the Compton cross-section per electron. In\nquiescent solar corona, this heating starts in the transition zone to the\ncorona and is a major fraction of the coronal heating.

Our purpose is to test the Cold Dark\nMatter (CDM) model at small and highly non-linear scales where it has been\nclaimed that the CDM model may confront several difficulties. We concentrate\nour attention on the statistics of strong gravitational lenses. We use two\ncomplementary statistics, lensed arcs and quasars, to probe the mass\ndistributions. First, we construct a triaxial lens model, and develop a new\nmethod to include triaxiality of dark halos in the lens statistics. We find\nthat the effect of triaxiality is significant; it enhances lensing\nprobabilities by a factors of a few to ten, assuming the degree of triaxiality\npredicted in the CDM model. In particular, we argue that both central\nconcentration and large triaxiality of dark halos are required to reproduce the\nobserved number of arcs in clusters; thus the result can be interpreted as a\nstrong evidence for the cold and collisionless dark matter. One of the most\nnotable advantages of the triaxial modeling is that the triaxial modeling\nallows us to predict image multiplicities. We find that the CDM halos predict\nsignificant fraction (more than 20%) of naked cusp lenses. In addition, we\npoint out the image multiplicities depend strongly on the central concentration\nof dark halos. Therefore we propose image multiplicities as a new powerful test\nof the CDM model. Finally we searched for large-separation lensed quasars from\nthe data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and succeeded in discovering the\nfirst large-separation lensed quasar SDSS J1004+4112.

I find that the density of the source\nenvironment is a strong function of the source radio-luminosity but is\ninsensitive to changes in redshift. The jet power is also a strong function of\nradio-luminosity but also a weak function of redshift. This indicates that the\nmass of the black-hole powering FRII sources is epoch dependent. In general, I\nfind that the source environment is dominated by changes in the\nradio-luminosity but is relatively unaffected by changes in cosmic epoch.\n","Comment: Full version can be found at\n  http://www.astro.soton.ac.uk/~jag/Thesis.zip Thesis published November 2004\n  Full version can be found at http://www.astro.soton.ac.uk/~jag/Thesis.zip\n  Thesis published November 2004.

We find that the local relaxation dynamics is a\nstrong function of z, the distance of the particles from the wall, and that\nclose to the surface the typical relaxation times are orders of magnitude\nlarger than the ones in the bulk. Because of the cooperative nature of the\nparticle dynamics, the slow dynamics also affects the dynamics of the particles\nfor large values of z.

A variety of experiments are discussed, focusing on the region\nof the phase diagram close to the Mott insulator (the underdoped region) where\nthe behavior is most anomalous. We introduce Anderson's idea of the resonating\nvalence bond (RVB) and argue that it gives a qualitative account of the data.\nThe importance of phase fluctuation is discussed, leading to a theory of the\ntransition temperature which is driven by phase fluctuation and thermal\nexcitation of quasiparticles. We then describe the numerical method of\nprojected wavefunction which turns out to be a very useful technique to\nimplement the strong correlation constraint, and leads to a number of\npredictions which are in agreement with experiments. The remainder of the paper\ndeals with an analytic treatment of the t-J model, with the goal of putting the\nRVB idea on a more formal footing. The slave-boson is introduced to enforce the\nconstraint of no double occupation. The implementation of the local constraint\nleads naturally to gauge theories. We give a rather thorough discussion of the\nrole of gauge theory in describing the spin liquid phase of the undoped Mott\ninsulator.

By defining a low-energy Hubbard\nHamiltonian in the basis of Wannier functions for the t2g LDA band and solving\nit in the single-site DMFT approximation, it was recently shown[1] that\nsimultaneously with the Mott transition there occurs a strong suppression of\norbital fluctuations due to splitting of the t2g levels. The present paper\nreviews and expands this work, in particular in the direction of exposing the\nunderlying chemical mechanisms by means of ab initio LDA Wannier functions\ngenerated with the NMTO method. The Wannier functions for the t2g band exhibit\ncovalency between the transition-metal t2g, the large cation-d, and the\noxygen-p states; this covalency, which increases along the series, turns out to\nbe responsible not only for the splittings of the t2g levels, but also for\nnon-cubic perturbations of the hopping integrals, both of which are decisive\nfor the Mott transition. We find good agreement with the optical and\nphotoemission spectra, with the crystal-field splittings and orbital\npolarizations recently measured for the titanates, and with the metallization\nvolume for LaTiO3. The metallization volume for YTiO3 is predicted. Using\nsuper-exchange theory, we reproduce the observed magnetic orders in LaTiO3 and\nYTiO3, but the results are sensitive to detail, in particular for YTiO3 which,\nwithout the Jahn-Teller distortion, would be AFM C- or A-type, rather than FM.\nFinally, we show that it possible to unfold the orthorhombic t2g LDA\nbandstructure to a pseudocubic zone. In this zone, the lowest band is separated\nfrom the two others by a direct gap and has a width, W_I, which is\nsignificantly smaller than that, W, of the entire t2g band. The progressive\nGdFeO3-type distortion favours electron localization by decreasing W, by\nincreasing the splitting of the t2g levels and by decreasing W_I. Our\nconclusions concerning the roles of GdFeO3-type and JT distortions agree with\nthose of Mochizuki and Imada [2].\n","Comment: Published version, final.

Memory saving was reached by an IFT algorithm simplification,\nwhich stores more elements in temporary structures but these elements are\nsimpler and thus need less memory.\n  The best presented modification allows segmentation of large 3D medical\ndatasets (up to 512x512x680 voxels) with 12-or 16-bits per voxel on currently\navailable PC based workstations.\n","Comment: v1: 10 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables EUROGRAPHICS conference,\n  Manchester, UK, 2001. v2: 12 pages, reformated for letter, corrected IFT to\n  \"Image Foresting Tranform\""]}]

However, motivating the agents to abide to a\nsolution requires careful analysis: only some of the solutions are stable in\nthe sense that no group of agents is motivated to break off and form a new\ncoalition. This constraint has been studied extensively in cooperative game\ntheory. However, the computational questions around this constraint have\nreceived less attention. When it comes to coalition formation among software\nagents (that represent real-world parties), these questions become increasingly\nexplicit.\n  In this paper we define a concise general representation for games in\ncharacteristic form that relies on superadditivity, and show that it allows for\nefficient checking of whether a given outcome is in the core.

The running time of the\nparticle-swarm algorithm is $O(|P|+|P|t)$ where $|P|$ is the size of the\nparticle population and $t$ is the number of particle propagation iterations.\nThe particle-swarm method is shown to be useful due to its ease of extension\nand running time.\n","Comment: 17 pages, currently in peer-review"]}]

Slepton mass squareds, however, are predicted to\nbe negative. This can be solved by adding D-terms for U(1)_Y and U(1)_{B-L}\nwhile retaining the UV insensitivity. In this paper we consider electroweak\nsymmetry breaking via UV insensitive anomaly mediation in several models.

It turns\nout that in order to achieve m_a < 2 m_b with A_\\lambda(m_Z), A_\\kappa(m_Z) of\norder the typical radiative corrections, the required tuning of trilinear\ncouplings need not be larger than 5-10 %. Further, the necessity for this\ntuning can be eliminated in specific SUSY breaking scenarios. Quite\ninterestingly, Br(h -> aa) is typically above 70 % in this region of parameter\nspace and thus an appropriately large value requires no additional tuning.\n","Comment: 33 pages, 25 figures"]}]

Naively, one might expect the field $\\phi$ to fall from the top of the\neffective potential and then experience a long stage of oscillations with\namplitude O(v) near the minimum of the effective potential at $\\phi = v$ until\nit gives its energy to particles produced during these oscillations. However,\nit was recently found that the tachyonic instability rapidly converts most of\nthe potential energy V(0) into the energy of colliding classical waves of the\nscalar field.

Recently, with generalized complex\ngeometry, a new mathematical framework was developed that is especially suited\nto discuss the target space geometry of sigma models in a Hamiltonian\nformulation. Bi-hermitian geometry is so-called generalized Kaehler geometry\nbut the relation is involved. We discuss various amounts of supersymmetry in\nphase space and show that this relation can be established by considering the\nequivalence between the Hamilton and Lagrange formulation of the sigma model.\nIn the study of generalized supersymmetric sigma models, we find objects that\nfavor a geometrical interpretation beyond generalized complex geometry.\n","Comment: 87 Pages, PhD Thesis"]}]

One could hope that this problem\ndisappears if one represents the global symmetry of a pseudoscalar axion field\nas a gauge symmetry of the Ogievetsky-Polubarinov-Kalb-Ramond antisymmetric\ntensor field. We will show, however, that this gauge symmetry does not protect\nthe axion mass from quantum corrections. The amplitude of gravitational effects\nviolating global symmetries could be strongly suppressed by e^{-S}, where S is\nthe action of a wormhole which may eat the global charge. Unfortunately, in a\nwide variety of theories based on the Einstein theory of gravity the action\nappears to be fairly small, S = O(10). However, we have found that the\nexistence of wormholes and the value of their action are extremely sensitive to\nthe structure of space on the nearly Planckian scale. We consider several\nexamples (Kaluza-Klein theory, conformal anomaly, R^2 terms) which show that\nmodifications of the Einstein theory on the length scale l ~ 10 M_P^{-1} may\nstrongly suppress violation of global symmetries. We have found also that in\nstring theory there exists an additional suppression of topology change by the\nfactor e^{-{8\\pi^2\\over g^2}}. This effect is strong enough to save the axion\ntheory for the natural values of the stringy gauge coupling constant.\n","Comment: 56 pages, a reference to the pioneering paper of Ogievetsky and\n  Polubarinov on the antisymmetric tensor field is added"]}]

The\nplayers communicate and function in a way that resembles some real-life\nsituations. We consider two types of operations. First, there are operations\nthat follow an open democratic discussion. Second, some subgroups of players\nwho may have different interests make decisions based on their own group\ninterest. A key ingredient here is that the identity of each subgroup is known\nonly to the members of that group. In this paper, we are interested in the best\nstrategies for the different groups in such scenarios and in evaluating their\nrelative power. The main focus of the paper is the question: How large and\nstrong should a subgroup be in order to dominate the game? The concrete model\nstudied here is based on the popular game ``Mafia.'' In this game, there are\nthree groups of players: Mafia, detectives and ordinary citizens. Initially,\neach player is given only his/her own identity, except the mafia, who are given\nthe identities of all mafia members. At each ``open'' round, a vote is made to\ndetermine which player to eliminate. Additionally, there are collective\ndecisions made by the mafia where they decide to eliminate a citizen. Finally,\neach detective accumulates data on the mafia/citizen status of players. The\ncitizens win if they eliminate all mafia members. Otherwise, the mafia wins. We\nfirst find a randomized strategy that is optimal in the absence of detectives.\nThis leads to a stochastic asymptotic analysis where it is shown that the two\ngroups have comparable probabilities of winning exactly when the total\npopulation size is $R$ and the mafia size is of order $\\sqrt{R}$. We then show\nthat even a single detective changes the qualitative behavior of the game\ndramatically. Here, the mafia and citizens have comparable winning\nprobabilities only for a mafia size linear in $R$.

Four families of critical points are\nborn in distinct bifurcations, each corresponding to a novel anharmonic mode.\nThese modes are visualized with custom computer-generated animations.\n  The same analysis is extended for the first time to the acetylene stretchbend\nsystem, which has never been analyzed classically with all the resonance\ncouplings. Preliminary results are obtained for the polyad series containing\nthe C-H stretch overtones.\n","Comment: Ph.D. dissertation, University of Oregon (March 2004), 196 pages.

Flow instability and turbulence transition have been\nchallenging subjects for fluid dynamics for a century. The critical condition\nof turbulent transition from theory and experiments differs largely from each\nother for Poiseuille flows. In this paper, a new mechanism of flow instability\nand turbulence transition is presented for parallel shear flows and the energy\ngradient theory of hydrodynamic instability is proposed. It is stated that the\ntotal energy gradient in the transverse direction and that in the streamwise\ndirection of the main flow dominate the disturbance amplification or decay. A\nnew dimensionless parameter K for characterizing flow instability is proposed\nfor wall bounded shear flows, which is expressed as the ratio of the energy\ngradients in the two directions. It is thought that flow instability should\nfirst occur at the position of Kmax which may be the most dangerous position.\nThis speculation is confirmed by Nishioka et al's experimental data. Comparison\nwith experimental data for plane Poiseuille flow and pipe Poiseuille flow\nindicates that the proposed idea is really valid. It is found that the\nturbulence transition takes place at a critical value of Kmax of about 385 for\nboth plane Poiseuille flow and pipe Poiseuille flow, below which no turbulence\nwill occur regardless the disturbance. More studies show that the theory is\nalso valid for plane Couette flows and Taylor-Couette flows between concentric\nrotating cylinders.\n","Comment: 21 pages; 10 figures.

We start with an overview of current experimental\nand theoretical issues in Relativistic heavy ion physics. We then introduce\nstatistical hadronization, and show how it gives a description of particle\nabundances and spectra through covariance and entropy maximization. We argue\nthat a distinction can be made between equilibrated staged freeze-out in which\npost-formation hadron interactions play an important role in determining\nfinal-state observables, and non-equilibrium sudden freeze-out where spectra\nand abundances get determined at the same time and further interactions are\nnegligible. We attempt to falsify sudden freeze-out by examining whether\nparticle abundances and spectra can be described using the same formation\ntemperature. This is done both in the equilibrium framework, and using a\nchemical non-equilibrium ansatz. Our fits to experimental data suggest that the\nsudden freeze-out model explains both the particle abundances and spectra. We\nthen try to extract the particle formation temperature, and quantify\npost-freeze-out hadronic interactions using experimentally observable\nresonances. We discuss observed resonances and suggest further measurements\nthat have the potential to distinguish between the possible freeze-out\nscenarios experimentally. Finally, we infer from experimental data how particle\nformation proceeds in spacetime, in particular whether freeze-out dynamics\nagrees with the sudden freeze-out expectation.

To check against the above\nstudy of Kornath et al., as a by-product we have made the same approximations\nfor n=6 and 8 as we have for n=10.

The role\nof electron correlation in distinguishing between low-lying isomers is plainly\ncrucial, and will need a combination of experiment and theory to obtain\ndecisive results such as that of Kornath et al. for Li_8.

The wall modes display coherent vorticity structures near the\nwall, the lift modes display coherent vorticity structures that lift away from\nthe wall, the asymmetric modes break the symmetry about the axis, and the ring\nmodes display rings of coherent vorticity. Together, the propagating modes form\na wave packet, as found from a circular normal speed locus. The energy transfer\nmechanism in the flow is a four step process. The process begins with energy\nbeing transferred from mean flow to the shear modes, then to the roll modes.\nEnergy is then transfer ed from the roll modes to the wall modes, and then\neventually to the lift modes.

It is shown that the mathematics of two coupled\noscillators enables us to carry out this job. We are then led to the question\nof whether the concept of localized probability distribution is consistent with\nLorentz covariance.\n","Comment: Latex 11 pages, 7 figures; invited paper presented at the\n  International Conference on Foundations of Probability and Physics (Vaxjo,\n  Sweden, June 2006); to be published in the proceedings (AIP Conference\n  Proceedings Series); Minor corrections"]}]

These quantities will be\ncrucial values when teleportation becomes common in daily life, perhaps\ncenturies from now.\n  Assume that Alice desires to send a singing Japanese cricket to her friend\nBob in America, and that Alice and Bob already share a quantum entanglement.\nFirst, Alice sends Bob a mass of information bits resulting from the\ninteraction between the cricket she holds in her hand and half of the\nentanglement. Subsequently, Bob receives the information bits and manipulates\nthe other half of the entanglement, transforming them back into the original\ncricket. Examining this situation from an instrumental engineering viewpoint,\nquantifying the amount of the quantum entanglement and the number of\ninformation bits is crucial for this transmission. If both values are enough,\nAlice could even send herself to Bob's place instead of the tiny cricket.\n  The topics of this thesis therefore are: (1) the mathematical properties of\nthe entanglement cost, such as whether it is an additive measure similar to\nnormal length or weight; and (2) how to calculate the Holevo capacity, an\nultimately achievable limit of the information conveyance capacity of an\ninformation channel, such as of a single photon passing through an optical\nfiber or space. These two distinct quantities are magically tied together by\nseveral ``additive or not'' hypotheses, which await mathematical proof.\n","Comment: A doctoral dissertation, the University of Tokyo, 112 pages, 65\n  figure files"]}]
