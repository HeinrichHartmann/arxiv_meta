To overcome this limitation, two different\ntechniques, the information spectrum method and the smooth entropy framework,\nhave been developed independently. They are based on new entropy measures,\ncalled spectral entropy rates and smooth entropies, respectively, that\ngeneralize Shannon entropy (in the classical case) and von Neumann entropy (in\nthe more general quantum case). Here, we show that the two techniques are\nclosely related. More precisely, the spectral entropy rate can be seen as the\nasymptotic limit of the smooth entropy. Our results apply to the quantum\nsetting and thus include the classical setting as a special case.\n"]}]
