In fact, for diameter not larger than 3 the problem can be\nshown to be polynomially solvable using a dynamic programming approach.\n  In addition we prove that the problem is NP-complete even for the class of\ntrees of maximum degree at most 16. To the best of our knowledge, the only\nknown result in this direction is that the tree search problem is solvable in\nO(|V| log|V|) time for trees with degree at most 2 (paths).\n  We match the above complexity results with a tight algorithmic analysis. We\nfirst show that a natural greedy algorithm attains a 2-approximation.\nFurthermore, for the bounded degree instances, we show that any optimal\nstrategy (i.e., one that minimizes the expected number of queries) performs at\nmost O(\\Delta(T) (log |V| + log w(T))) queries in the worst case, where w(T) is\nthe sum of the likelihoods of the nodes of T and \\Delta(T) is the maximum\ndegree of T. We combine this result with a non-trivial exponential time\nalgorithm to provide an FPTAS for trees with bounded degree.\n"]}]

In the first\nscenario, the proposed scheme can better exploit the \\textit{multi-relay\ndiversity} in the sense that with $K$ fixed relays and a cost of\n$\\mathcal{O}(K)$ average end-to-end packet delay, it could achieve the same\noptimal asymptotic average throughput as the existing designs (such as regular\ndecode-and-forward relay schemes) with $K^2$ fixed relays.

This system throughput\nis unattainable for the existing designs with low relay mobility, the proposed\nrelay scheme can exploit the relays' mobility more efficiently.\n"]}]

It is shown that the residual entropy loss conjecture (ELC) at\nthe glass transition, which results in a discontinuous entropy violates many\nfundamental principles of classical thermodynamics, and also contradicts some\nexperimental facts. Assuming, as is common in the field, that glasses are in\ninternal equilibrium, we show that the continuity of enthalpy and volume at the\nglass transition require the continuity of the Gibbs free energy and the\nentropy, which contradicts ELC. It is then argued that ELC is founded on an\nincorrect understanding of what it means for a glass to be kinetically trapped\nin a basin and of the concept of probability and entropy. Once this\nmisunderstanding is corrected in our approach by the proper identification of\nentropy as the ensemble entropy, which is in accordance with the principle of\nreproducibility (see Sect. II), it follows immediately that the residual\nentropy does not disappear in a kinetically frozen glassy state and all the\nviolations of thermodynamics disappear.
