METHODS: To study the characteristics of the stellar populations\nand the metallicity distribution in the Galactic bulge, we compared the output\nof the galaxy model TRILEGAL, which implements the Binney et al. (1997) bulge\nmodel, with observations from 2MASS and OGLE-II. A minimisation procedure has\nbeen set up to retrieve the best fitting model with different stellar\npopulations and metallicity distributions. RESULTS: Using the TRILEGAL code we\nfind that the best model resembling the characteristics of the Galactic bulge\nis a model with the distance to the Galactic centre $R_0 =\n8.7\\pm^{0.57}_{0.43}$ kpc, the major axis ratios of the bar $1:\\eta:\\zeta = 1 :\n0.68\\pm_{0.19}^{0.05} : 0.31\\pm_{0.04}^{0.06}$, and the angle between the\nSun-centre line and the bar $\\phi = 15\\deg\\pm_{12.7}^{13.3}$. Using these\nparameters the best model is found for a burst of 8 Gyr, although it is almost\nindistinguishable from models with ages of 9 and 10 Gyr. The metallicity\ndistribution found is consistent with metallicity distributions in the\nliterature based on spectroscopic results.\n","Comment: A&A accepted"]}]

This class of models\nincludes as limiting cases the familiar serial double quantum dot and triple\nquantum dot nanostructures. By extracting the quasiparticle scattering phase\nshifts, we compute the low-temperature conductance as a function of the\ninter-impurity tunneling-coupling. We point out that due to the existence of\nexponentially low temperature scales, there is a parameter range where the\nstable \"zero-temperature\" fixed point is essentially never reached (not even in\nnumerical renormalization group calculations). The \"zero-temperature\"\nconductance is then of no interest and it may only be meaningful to compute the\nconductance at finite temperature. This illustrates the perils of studying the\nconductance in the ground state and considering thermal fluctuations only as a\nsmall correction.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 13 figures"]}]
