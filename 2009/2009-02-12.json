A distinctly different\nquantum behavior is found compared to that of circular single quantum dots. As\na function of the magnetic field, the energy spectra exhibit a low-energy band\nconsisting of a group of six states, with the number six being a consequence of\nthe conservation of the total spin of the four electrons and the ensuing spin\ndegeneracies. These six states appear to cross at a single value of the\nmagnetic field, with the crossing point becoming sharper for larger interdot\ndistances. As the strength of the Coulomb repulsion increases, the six states\ntend to become degenerate and a well defined energy gap separates them from the\nhigher-in-energy excited states.\n  The appearance of the low-energy band is a consequence of the formation of a\nWigner supermolecule, with the four electrons (two in each dot) being localized\nat the vertices of a rectangular parallelogram.

We address this question using the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor\n(nAChR) as the exemplar. The nAChR is an integral membrane protein which forms\na cation selective channel gated by neurotransmitter binding to its\nextracellular domain. A hydrophobic gating model has been proposed for the\nnAChR, whereby the pore is incompletely occluded in the closed state channel,\nwith a narrow hydrophobic central gate region which presents an energetic\nbarrier to ion permeation. The nAChR pore is lined by a parallel bundle of five\nM2 alpha-helices, with the gate formed by three rings of hydrophobic sidechains\n(9', 13', and 17' of M2). A number of models have been proposed to describe the\nnature of the conformational change underlying the closed to open transition of\nthe nAChR. These models involve different degrees of M2 helix displacement,\nrotation, and/or kinking. In this study, we use a simple pore expansion method\n(previously used to model opening of potassium channels) to generate a series\nof progressively wider models of the nAChR transmembrane domain. Continuum\nelectrostatics calculations are used to assess the change in the barrier height\nof the hydrophobic gate as a function of pore expansion. The results suggest\nthat an increase in radius of Delta r ~ 1.5 angstrom is sufficient to\nfunctionally open the pore without, for example, a requirement for rotation of\nthe M2 helices.

An element being in a\nsubset is analogous to a partition p on U making a distinction, i.e., if u and\nu' were in different blocks of p. Subset logic leads to finite probability\ntheory by taking the (Laplacian) probability as the normalized size of each\nsubset-event of a finite universe. The analogous step in the logic of\npartitions is to assign to a partition the number of distinctions made by a\npartition normalized by the total number of ordered pairs |UxU| from the finite\nuniverse.

For chains of finite length, an\nimportant difference of crossovers between conformational (pseudo)phases is,\nhowever, that these transitions are typically rather smooth processes, i.e.,\nthermodynamic activity is not necessarily signalized by strong entropic or\nenergetic fluctuations.

But to operationally study the topology and to coordinatize the region\nof spacetime, the use of radars (to send and receive electromagnetic signals)\nis required.
