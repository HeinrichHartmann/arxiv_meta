Eleven new radio\ngalaxies are added to our previous sample of nineteen sources, forming a sample\nof thirty objects with redshifts between 0 and 1.8. This sample of radio\ngalaxies are used to obtain the best fit cosmological parameters in a\nquintessence model in a spatially flat universe, a cosmological constant model\nthat allows for non-zero space curvature, and a rolling scalar field model in a\nspatially flat universe. Results obtained with radio galaxies are compared with\nthose obtained with different supernova samples, and with combined radio galaxy\nand supernova samples. Results obtained with different samples are consistent,\nsuggesting that neither method is seriously affected by systematic errors. Best\nfit radio galaxy and supernovae model parameters determined in the different\ncosmological models are nearly identical, and are used to determine\ndimensionless coordinate distances to supernovae and radio galaxies, and\ndistance moduli to the radio galaxies. The distance moduli to the radio\ngalaxies can be combined with supernovae samples to increase the number of\nsources, particularly high-redshift sources, in the samples. The constraints\nobtained here with the combined radio galaxy plus supernovae data set in the\nrolling scalar field model are quite strong. The best fit parameter values\nsuggest a value of omega is less than about 0.35, and the model parameter alpha\nis close to zero; that is, a cosmological constant provides a good description\nof the data.

In this\npaper, we explore the feasibility of engineering such a migration over a long\ntime period. The basic mechanism uses gravitational assists to (in effect)\ntransfer orbital energy from Jupiter to the Earth, and thereby enlarges the\norbital radius of Earth. This transfer is accomplished by a suitable\nintermediate body, either a Kuiper Belt object or a main belt asteroid. The\nobject first encounters Earth during an inward pass on its initial highly\nelliptical orbit of large (~ 300 AU) semimajor axis. The encounter transfers\nenergy from the object to the Earth in standard gravity-assist fashion by\npassing close to the leading limb of the planet. The resulting outbound\ntrajectory of the object must cross the orbit of Jupiter; with proper timing,\nthe outbound object encounters Jupiter and picks up the energy it lost to\nEarth. With small corrections to the trajectory, or additional planetary\nencounters (e.g., with Saturn), the object can repeat this process over many\nencounters. To maintain its present flux of solar energy, the Earth must\nexperience roughly one encounter every 6000 years (for an object mass of 1E22\ng).

Ultracold neutrons were trapped in a\nmaterial bottle covered with perfluoropolyether. The neutron lifetime was\ndeduced from comparison of UCN losses in the traps with different\nsurface-to-volume ratios. The precise value of the neutron lifetime is of\nfundamental importance to particle physics and cosmology. In this experiment,\nthe UCN storage time is brought closer to the neutron lifetime than in any\nexperiments before:the probability of UCN losses from the trap was only 1% of\nthat for neutron beta decay. The neutron lifetime\nobtained,878.5+/-0.7stat+/-0.3sys s, is the most accurate experimental\nmeasurement to date.\n","Comment: 38 pages, 19 figures,changed content"]}]
