The results are used\nto check the applicability of two basic analytic ansatze of mean-field\nmagnetohydrodynamics - the second order correlation approximation (SOCA) and\nthe tau approximation. In the numerical simulations the effective Reynolds\nnumber Re is 2-20, while the magnetic Prandtl number varies from 0.1 to\n$10^{7}$. We present evidence that the $\\tau$ approximation may be appropriate\nin dynamical regimes where there is a small-scale dynamo. Catastrophic\nquenching of the $\\alpha$ effect is found for high $P_{m}$. Our results\nindicate that for high $P_{m}$ SOCA gives a very large value of the $\\alpha$\ncoefficient compared with the ``exact'' solution. The discrepancy depends on\nthe properties of the random force that drives the flow, with a larger\ndifference occuring for $\\delta$-correlated force compared with that for a\nsteady random force.\n","Comment: submitted to MNRAS"]}]

The origin of\ngenetic robustness, whether it evolves directly by natural selection or it is a\ncorrelated byproduct of other phenotypic traits, is, however, unresolved.\nExamining microRNA (miRNA) genes of several eukaryotic species, Borenstein and\nRuppin (Borenstein et al. 2006, PNAS 103: 6593), showed that the structure of\nmiRNA precursor stem-loops exhibits significantly increased mutational\nrobustness in comparison with a sample of random RNA sequences with the same\nstem-loop structure. The observed robustness was found to be uncorrelated with\ntraditional measures of environmental robustness -- implying that miRNA\nsequences show evidence of the direct evolution of genetic robustness. These\nfindings are surprising as theoretical results indicate that the direct\nevolution of robustness requires high mutation rates and/or large effective\npopulation sizes only found among RNA viruses, not multicellular eukaryotes.\nIntroducing a novel measure of environmental robustness based on the\nequilibrium thermodynamic ensemble of secondary structures of the miRNA\nprecursor sequences we demonstrate that the biophysics of RNA folding, induces\na high level of correlation between genetic (mutational) and environmental\n(thermodynamic) robustness, as expected from the theory of plastogenetic\ncongruence introduced by Ancel and Fontana (Ancel et al. 2000, J.
