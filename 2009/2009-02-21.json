Automatic measurement of\nemission-line fluxes and equivalent widths have been performed on the full\nspectroscopic sample. This sample is divided into two sub-samples depending on\nthe apparent magnitude selection: wide ($I_{\\mathrm{AB}}<22.5$) and deep\n$I_{\\mathrm{AB}}<24$). These two samples span two different ranges of stellar\nmasses. Emission-line galaxies have been separated into star-forming galaxies\nand active galactic nuclei using emission line ratios. For the star-forming\ngalaxies the emission line ratios have also been used to estimate gas-phase\noxygen abundance, using empirical calibrations renormalized in order to give\nconsistent results at low and high redshifts. The stellar masses have been\nestimated by fitting the whole spectral energy distributions with a set of\nstellar population synthesis models. We assume at first order that the shape of\nthe mass-metallicity relation remains constant with redshift. Then we find a\nstronger metallicity evolution in the wide sample as compared to the deep\nsample. We thus conclude that the mass-metallicity relation is flatter at\nhigher redshift. The observed flattening of the mass-metallicity relation at\nhigh redshift is analyzed as an evidence in favor of the open-closed model.\n","Comment: 21 pages, revised version submitted to A&A"]}]

Strong gravitational lensing furnishes a powerful method to probe\ngravity in the central regions of galaxies. It can (1) provide a unique\ndetection-channel of dark-matter substructure beyond the local galaxy group,\n(2) constrain dark-matter physics, complementary to direct-detection\nexperiments, as well as metric theories of gravity, (3) probe central\nsuper-massive black holes, and (4) provide crucial insight into galaxy\nformation processes from the dark matter point of view, independently of the\nnature and state of dark matter.

To answer these\nfundamental questions through strong gravitational lensing, a strong investment\nin large radio and optical-IR facilities is therefore critical in the coming\ndecade.
