Of particular importance is the fate of the\ninitial value problem. Under what circumstances do infinite order differential\nequations possess a well-defined initial value problem and how many initial\ndata are required? In this paper we study the initial value problem for\ninfinite order differential equations in the mathematical framework of the\nformal operator calculus, with analytic initial data. This formalism allows us\nto handle simultaneously a wide array of different nonlocal equations within a\nsingle framework and also admits a transparent physical interpretation.

It contains mini-reviews of the relevant\nobservational cosmology, of elementary field theory and of supersymmetry, that\nmay be of interest in their own right. The spectral index $n(k)$, specifying\nthe scale-dependence of the spectrum of the curvature perturbation, will be a\npowerful discriminator between models, when it is measured by Planck with\naccuracy $\\Delta n\\sim 0.01$. The usual formula for $n$ is derived, as well as\nits less familiar extension to the case of a multi-component inflaton; in both\ncases the key ingredient is the separate evolution of causally disconnected\nregions of the Universe. Primordial gravitational waves will be an even more\npowerful discriminator if they are observed, since most models of inflation\npredict that they are completely negligible. We treat in detail the new wave of\nmodels, which are firmly rooted in modern particle theory and have\nsupersymmetry as a crucial ingredient. The review is addressed to both\nastrophysicists and particle physicists, and each section is fairly homogeneous\nregarding the assumed background knowledge.\n","Comment: 156 pages, after final proof corrections and additions"]}]
