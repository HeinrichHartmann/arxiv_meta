The main predictions are the\nexistence of a power-law distribution for the interevent time of human actions\nand two decay exponents $\\alpha=1$ and $\\alpha=3/2$. Current models lack,\nhowever, a key aspect of human dynamics, i.e. several tasks require, or are\ndetermined by, interactions between individuals. Here we introduce a minimal\nqueueing model of human dynamics that already takes into account human-human\ninteractions. To achieve large scale simulations we obtain a coarse-grained\nversion of the model, allowing us to reach large interevent times and reliable\nscaling exponents estimations. Using this we show that the interevent\ndistribution of interacting tasks exhibit the scaling exponents $\\alpha=2$, 3/2\nand a series of numerable values between 3/2 and 1. This work demonstrates\nthat, within the context of queueing models of human dynamics, interactions\nchange the exponent of the power-law distributed interevent times. Beyond the\nstudy of human dynamics, these results are relevant to systems where the event\nof interest consists of the simultaneous occurrence of two (or more) events.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures, changes in abstract and text.
