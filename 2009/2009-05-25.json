We also consider the situation where the magnetic\nfield consists of an oscillatory as well as a linearly varying component, i.e.,\n$h(t) = h_0\\cos{\\omega t} + t/\\tau$. Our purpose is to estimate the defect\ndensity and the local entropy density in the final state if the system is\ninitially prepared in its ground state. For a single crossing through the\nquantum critical point with $h = h_0\\cos{\\omega t}$, the density of defects in\nthe final state is calculated by mapping the dynamics to an equivalent Landau\nZener problem by linearizing near the crossing point, and is found to vary as\n$\\sqrt{\\omega}$ in the limit of small $\\omega$. On the other hand, the local\nentropy density is found to attain a maximum as a function of $\\omega$ near a\ncharacteristic scale $\\omega_0$. Extending to the situation of multiple\ncrossings, we show that the non-trivial interference effects of certain\nresonance modes solely contribute to the production of defects. Kink density as\nwell as the diagonal entropy density show oscillatory dependence on the number\nof full cycles of oscillation. Finally, the inclusion of a linear term in the\ntransverse field on top of the oscillatory component, results to a kink density\nwhich decreases continuously with $\\tau$ and $\\omega$. The entropy density\nshows monotonous growth with both $\\tau$ and $\\omega$, in sharp contrast to the\nsituations studied earlier.

Instead of\nrelying on the general notions of real numbers, limits and continuity, we treat\nfunctions as the primary objects of our theory, and view differentiation as\ndivision of f(x)-f(a) by x-a in a certain class of functions. When f is a\npolynomial the division can be carried out explicitly. To see why a polynomial\nwith a positive derivative is increasing (the monotonicity theorem), we use the\nestimate |f(x)-f(a)-f'(a)(x-a)|<=K(x-a)^2. By making it into a definition we\narrive at the notion of uniform Lipschitz differentiability (ULD), and see that\nthe derivative of a ULD function is Lipschitz. Taking different moduli of\ncontinuity instead of |.|, we get different flavors of calculus, each rather\nelementary, but all together covering the total range of continuously\ndifferentiable functions. Using functions continuous at a, we recapture the\nclassical definition of differentiability at a point.

Mathematical optimization can be used as a computational tool to\nobtain the optimal solution to a given problem in a systematic and efficient\nway. For example, in twice-differentiable functions and problems with no\nconstraints, the optimization consists of finding the points where the gradient\nof the objective function is zero and using the Hessian matrix to classify the\ntype of each point. Sometimes, however it is impossible to compute these\nderivatives and other type of techniques must be employed such as the steepest\ndescent/ascent method and more sophisticated methods such as those based on the\nevolutionary algorithms. Aims. We present a simple algorithm based on the idea\nof genetic algorithms (GA) for optimization. We refer to this algorithm as AGA\n(Asexual Genetic Algorithm) and apply it to two kinds of problems: the\nmaximization of a function where classical methods fail and model fitting in\nastronomy. For the latter case, we minimize the chi-square function to estimate\nthe parameters in two examples: the orbits of exoplanets by taking a set of\nradial velocity data, and the spectral energy distribution (SED) observed\ntowards a YSO (Young Stellar Object). Methods. The algorithm AGA may also be\ncalled genetic, although it differs from standard genetic algorithms in two\nmain aspects: a) the initial population is not encoded, and b) the new\ngenerations are constructed by asexual reproduction. Results. Applying our\nalgorithm in optimizing some complicated functions, we find the global maxima\nwithin a few iterations. For model fitting to the orbits of exoplanets and the\nSED of a YSO, we estimate the parameters and their associated errors.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 8 figures, Astronomy and Astrophysics (in press)"]}]

Different authors call this property particle, but according to the\nterminology of this hypothesis, the term full wave is used in this text. The\npresent article discusses the validity of the empty/full waves hypothesis. It\nis shown that the energy conservation principle imposes for a full wave a\ncontinuous trajectory from the source to the detector. That gives legitimacy to\nthe question -- in case the wave function consists in a couple of\nspace-separated branches -- which wave-packet was a full wave before the click\nin the detector, or, in other authors' terminology, where was the particle\nbefore the detector clicked. This question is a counterfactual question. In\nsome multi-particle experiments, e.g. Hardy's thought-experiment with an\nelectron and a positron, the combination of the empty/full waves hypothesis and\ncounterfactual reasoning leads to a contradiction with the predictions of the\nquantum theory. However, it is shown here that this contradiction is solvable\nif the locality requirement is relaxed. To the difference from the local hidden\nvariables, it is not possible to prove or disprove the idea of empty/ full\nwaves, at least at present. But it is possible to ask whether this hypothesis\noffers a solution to the quantum puzzles. The answer is negative. For instance\nit offers no solution to the before-before loop. The question remains open\nwhether the empty/full waves hypothesis is correct, or \"God plays dice\".\n","Comment: 6 pages, 2 figures Conceptual changes, the preparation of the\n  experiment was simplified, new arguments in favor and against the main\n  hypothesis"]}]
