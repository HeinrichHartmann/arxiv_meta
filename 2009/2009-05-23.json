We describe a similar relationship between\ngroups of type E_6 and groups of type E_7 and use it to give explicit\ndescriptions of the homogeneous projective varieties associated to groups of\ntype E_7 with trivial Tits algebras. The underlying algebraic structure for the\nrelationship considered here are a sort of 56-dimensional structurable algebra\nwhich are forms of an algebra constructed from an exceptional Jordan algebra.\n","Comment: 35 pages, AMSLaTeX -- error in final section corrected"]}]
