The rationale for\nthis method is from the standard fireball model: if the optical flux decay\nindex equals to that of the X-ray flux, then there is no break frequency\nbetween the optical and X-ray bands, therefore we can derive the intrinsic\noptical flux from the X-ray spectra. We apply this method to three GRBs of\nwhich the optical and X-ray fluxes have the same decay indices and another one\nwith inferred cooling break frequency, and obtain the rest-frame extinction\ncurves of their host galaxies. The derived extinction curves are gray and do\nnot resemble any extinction curves of local galaxies (e.g. the Milk Way, the\nSmall/Large Magellanic Clouds, or nearby starburst galaxies). The amount of\nextinction is rather large (with visual extinction $A_V$ $\\sim$\n1.6--3.4$\\magni$). We model the derived extinction curves in terms of the\nsilicate-graphite interstellar grain model. As expected from the ``gray''\nnature of the derived extinction curve, the dust size distribution is skewed to\nlarge grains. We determine, for the first time, the local dust-to-gas ratios of\nGRB host galaxies using the model-derived dust parameters and the hydrogen\ncolumn densities determined from X-ray absorptions.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 2 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

We begin\nin this paper with a derivation of the self-force on a compact object moving in\nthe background spacetime of a supermassive black hole. The EFT approach\nutilizes the disparity between two length scales, which in this problem are the\nsize of the compact object and the radius of curvature of the background\nspacetime, to treat the orbital dynamics of the compact object, described as an\neffective point particle, separately from its tidal deformations. Ultraviolet\ndivergences are regularized using Hadamard's {\\it partie finie} to isolate the\nnon-local finite part from the quasi-local divergent part. The latter is\nconstructed from a momentum space representation for the graviton retarded\npropagator and is evaluated using dimensional regularization in which only\nlogarithmic divergences are relevant for renormalizing the parameters of the\ntheory. As a first important application of this framework we explicitly derive\nthe first order self-force given by Mino, Sasaki, Tanaka, Quinn and Wald. Going\nbeyond the point particle approximation, to account for the finite size of the\nobject, we demonstrate that for extreme mass ratio inspirals the motion of a\ncompact object is affected by tidally induced moments at $O(\\epsilon^4)$, in\nthe form of an Effacement Principle. The relatively large radius-to-mass ratio\nof a white dwarf star allows for these effects to be enhanced until the white\ndwarf becomes tidally disrupted, a potentially $O(\\epsilon^2)$ process, or\nplunges into the supermassive black hole.

A formalism allowing to take into account Coulomb-nuclear interference\neffects in polarized pbar-d cross sections is developed. Numerical calculations\nfor the polarized total pbar-d cross sections are performed at beam energies\n20-300 MeV using the Nbar-N interaction models developed by the Julich group.\nDouble-scattering effects are estimated within the Glauber approach and found\nto be in the order of 10-20%. Existing experimental data on differential pbar-d\ncross sections are in good agreement with the performed Glauber calculations.\nIt is found that for the used Nbar-N models the total longitudinal and\ntransversal pbar-d cross sections are comparable in absolute value to those for\npbar-p scattering.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 8 figures; typos in appendix removed, Section about\n  Coulomb-nuclear interference re-structured, figures improved; accepted for\n  publication in Phys.

Examples of such problems\ninclude partial differential equations (in particular, the Schrodinger\nequation) very high dimensional integration, approximation, continuous\noptimization, and path integration. Because the computer has only partial\ninformation about the continuous mathematical problem adversary arguments at\nthe information level often lead to tight complexity bounds.

Most of these modes are adequately damped by the manifolds. However,\nthe modes towards the high frequency end of the lower dipole band are not\nadequately damped because the last few cells are, due to mechanical fabrication\nrequirements, not coupled to the manifolds. To mitigate this problem in the\npresent RDDS1 design, the output coupler for the accelerating mode has been\ndesigned so as to also couple out those dipole modes which reach the output\ncoupler cell. In order to couple out both dipole mode polarizations, the output\ncoupler has four ports. We also report on the results of a study of the\nbenefits which can be achieved by supplementing manifold damping with local\ndamping for a limited number of cells at the downstream end of the structure.\n","Comment: For Linac2000 (TUA09)"]}]

The fabrication issues covered are ultra-precision cell\nmachining with micron accuracy, assembly and diffusion bonding technologies to\nsatisfactorily meet bookshelf, straightness and cell rotational alignment\nrequirements.
