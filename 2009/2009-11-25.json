The former problem is of interest both\npractically and theoretically, and the latter one is a classical problem being\nwell understood in ordinary hydrodynamics. The first analogy is the formation\nin the MHD flow of an impenetrable region -- core of the magnetic obstacle --\nas the interaction parameter $N$, i.e. strength of the applied magnetic field,\nincreases significantly. The core of the magnetic obstacle is streamlined both\nby the upstream flow and by the induced cross stream electric currents, like a\nforeign insulated insertion placed inside the ordinary hydrodynamic flow. In\nthe core, closed streamlines of the mass flow resemble contour lines of\nelectric potential, while closed streamlines of the electric current resemble\ncontour lines of pressure. The second analogy is the breaking away of attached\nvortices from the recirculation pattern produced by the magnetic obstacle when\nthe Reynolds number $Re$, i.e. velocity of the upstream flow, is larger than a\ncritical value. This breaking away of vortices from the magnetic obstacle is\nsimilar to that occurring past a real solid obstacle.

Second, we address the situation where the queries are\npartitioned into groups, and an algorithm may suggest a group of queries to a\nhuman user, who then selects the actual query. Third, we consider the problem\nof query learning in the presence of persistent query noise, and relate it to\ngroup identification. To address these problems we show that a standard\nalgorithm for query learning, known as the splitting algorithm or generalized\nbinary search, may be viewed as a generalization of Shannon-Fano coding. We\nthen extend this result to the group-based settings, leading to new algorithms.\nThe performance of our algorithms is demonstrated on simulated data and on a\ndatabase used by first responders for toxic chemical identification.\n","Comment: 25 pages"]}]

This was based on a variety of metal-ion\ntransitions which, if alpha varies, experience different relative velocity\nshifts. This result is yet to be robustly contradicted, or confirmed, by\nmeasurements on other telescopes and spectrographs; it remains crucial to do\nso. It is also important to consider new possible instrumental systematic\neffects which may explain the Keck/HIRES results. Griest et al. (2009,\narXiv:0904.4725v1) recently identified distortions in the echelle order\nwavelength scales of HIRES with typical amplitudes +/-250m/s. Here we\ninvestigate the effect such distortions may have had on the Keck/HIRES varying\nalpha results. We demonstrate that they cause a random effect on da/a from\nabsorber to absorber because the systems are at different redshifts, placing\nthe relevant absorption lines at different positions in different echelle\norders. The typical magnitude of the effect on da/a is ~0.4x10^{-5} per\nabsorber which, compared to the median error on da/a in the sample,\n~1.9x10^{-5}, is relatively small. Consequently, the weighted mean value\nchanges by less than 0.05x10^{-5} if the corrections we calculate are applied.\nNevertheless, we urge caution, particularly for analyses aiming to achieve high\nprecision da/a measurements on individual systems or small samples, that a much\nmore detailed understanding of such intra-order distortions and their\ndependence on observational parameters is important if they are to be avoided\nor modelled reliably.

In\ncontrast, the host galaxies of a significant fraction of low-power compact\nradio sources contain enormous discs/rings of HI gas (with sizes up to 190 kpc\nand masses up to 2 x 10E10 M_sun). This segregation in HI mass with radio\nsource size likely indicates that these compact radio sources are either\nconfined by large amounts of gas in the central region, or that their fueling\nis inefficient and different from the fueling process of classical FR-I radio\nsources. To a first order, the overall HI properties of our complete sample\n(detection rate, mass and morphology) appear similar to those of radio-quiet\nearly-type galaxies.
