Because the qubit's state\nkeeps evolving while being probed and because the measurement data is mixed\nwith a detector-related background noise, one might expect the detector to fail\nin this case.

We discuss the relation between our analysis and the\nstochastic master equation that describes the evolution of the qubit's state\nunder the influence of measurement and decoherence.
