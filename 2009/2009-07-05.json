Unlike many existing\nnetwork generating models, our method does not use link probabilities to\nachieve modularity. Instead, it utilizes a user-specified topology to determine\nrelatedness between pairs of nodes in terms of edge distances and links are\nswitched to increase edge distances. To measure the modular-ness of a network\nas a whole, a new metric called Q2 is proposed. Comparisons are made between\nthe Q [15] and Q2 measures. We also comment on the effect of our modularization\nmethod on other network characteristics such as clustering, hierarchy, average\npath length, small-worldness, degree correlation and centrality. An application\nof this method is reported elsewhere [12]. Briefly, the generated networks are\nused as test problems to explore the effect of modularity and degree\ndistribution on evolutionary search algorithms.\n","Comment: Appendix B"]}]
