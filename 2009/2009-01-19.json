In the process of anisotropic quenching, the\nsystem crosses all the quantum critical lines of the phase diagram where the\nrelaxation time diverges. The evolution is non-adiabatic in the time interval\nwhen the parameters are close to their critical values, and is adiabatic\notherwise. The density of defects produced due to non-adiabatic transitions is\ncalculated by mapping the many-particle system to an equivalent Landau-Zener\nproblem and is generally found to vary as $1/\\sqrt{\\tau}$, where $\\tau$ is the\ncharacteristic time scale of quenching, a scenario that supports the\nKibble-Zurek mechanism.

The\nmodel shows there is a maximum possible disk mass at a given age, since more\nmassive primordial disks process their mass faster. The corresponding maximum\ndust luminosity is f_max=0.00016r^(7/3)/t_age. The majority (4/7) of the hot\ndisks exceed this limit by >1000 and so cannot be the products of massive\nasteroid belts, rather the following systems must be undergoing transient\nevents characterized by an unusually high dust content near the star: eta\nCorvi, HD69830, HD72905 and BD+20307. It is also shown that the hot dust cannot\noriginate in a recent collision in an asteroid belt, since there is also a\nmaximum rate at which collisions of sufficient magnitude to reproduce a given\ndust luminosity can occur. Further it is shown that the planetesimal belt\nfeeding the dust in these systems must be located further from the star than\nthe dust, typically at >2AU.

Our approach is based on a particular approximation of $\\log(V(K_1, ...,\nK_n))$ by a solution of some convex minimization problem. We prove the mixed\nvolume analogues of the Van der Waerden and Schrijver-Valiant conjectures on\nthe permanent. These results, interesting on their own, allow us to justify the\nabovementioned approximation by a convex minimization, which is solved using\nthe ellipsoid method and a randomized poly-time time algorithm for the\napproximation of the volume of a convex set.\n","Comment: a journal version, accepted to Discrete and Computational Geometry"]}]
