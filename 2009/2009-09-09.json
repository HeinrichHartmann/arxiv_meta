Combinations of various reactor measurements\nwith the expected J-PARC (T2K) and NuMI offaxis (Nova) data, both with and\nwithout the increased flux associated with proton driver upgrades, are\nconsidered. The studies show how combinations of reactor and offaxis data can\nresolve degeneracies (e.g. the theta23 degeneracy) and give more precise\ninformation on the oscillation parameters. A primary purpose of this\ninvestigation is to establish the parameter space regions where CP violation\ncan be discovered and where the mass hierarchy can be determined. It is found\nthat such measurements, even with the augmented flux from proton driver\nupgrades, demand sin^2 (2 theta13) be fairly large and in the range where it is\nmeasurable by reactor experiments.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 13 figures, fixed typos; 25 pages, 13 figures, updated\n  content, references; previous 22 pages, 12 figures, added references and\n  fixed reference display problem"]}]
