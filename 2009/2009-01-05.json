Two popular\nscenarios - the tidal splitting of passing comets and the collisional\ndestruction of a satellite - rely on a high cometary flux in the past. In the\npresent paper we attempt to quantify the cometary flux during the Late Heavy\nBombardment (LHB) to assess the likelihood of both scenarios. Our analysis\nrelies on the so-called Nice model of the origin of the LHB (Tsiganis et al.,\n2005; Morbidelli et al., 2005; Gomes et al., 2005) and on the size distribution\nof the primordial trans-Neptunian planetesimals constrained in Charnoz &\nMorbidelli (2007). We find that the cometary flux on Saturn during the LHB was\nso high that both scenarios for the formation of Saturn rings are viable in\nprinciple. However, a more detailed study shows that the comet tidal disruption\nscenario implies that all four giant planets should have comparable ring\nsystems whereas the destroyed satellite scenario would work only for Saturn,\nand perhaps Jupiter. This is because in Saturn\\'s system, the synchronous orbit\nis interior to the Roche Limit, which is a necessary condition for maintaining\na satellite in the Roche zone up to the time of the LHB. We also discuss the\napparent elimination of silicates from the ring parent body implied by the\npurity of the ice in Saturn \\' s rings. The LHB has also strong implications\nfor the survival of the Saturnian satellites: all satellites smaller than Mimas\nwould have been destroyed during the LHB, whereas Enceladus would have had from\n40% to 70% chance of survival depending on the disruption model. In conclusion,\nthese results suggest that the LHB is the sweet moment for the formation of a\nmassive ring system around Saturn.\n","Comment: 39 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables.

Also, at a critical incidence coherent superposition can\nforce both the transmitted and reflected waves to graze the scattering surface\nthus synergistically reinforcing the diffractive process in a behavior\nreminiscent of critical internal reflection of ray optics.
