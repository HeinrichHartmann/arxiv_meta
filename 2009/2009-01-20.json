We begin by adding to the Hamiltonian of\ninterest a symmetry breaking source term. Using time-dependent perturbation\ntheory, we then expand the grand-canonical free energy as a double power series\nin both the tunneling and the source term. From here, an order parameter field\nis introduced in the standard way, and the underlying effective action is\nderived via a Legendre transformation. Determining the Ginzburg-Landau\nexpansion to first order in the tunneling term, expressions for the Mott\ninsulator-superfluid phase boundary, condensate density, average particle\nnumber, and compressibility are derived and analyzed in detail. Additionally,\nexcitation spectra in the ordered phase are found by considering both\nlongitudinal and transverse variations of the order parameter. Finally, these\nresults are applied to the concrete case of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian on a\nthree dimensional cubic lattice, and compared with the corresponding results\nfrom mean-field theory. Although both approaches yield the same Mott insulator\n- superfluid phase boundary to first order in the tunneling, the predictions of\nour effective action theory turn out to be superior to the mean-field results\ndeeper into the superfluid phase.\n"]}]

The transfer of\nmomentum from beads to the fluid creates an effective bead-bead interaction\nthat greatly aids capturing. We demonstrate that for a given inlet flow speed a\ncritical density of beads exists above which complete capturing takes place.\n","Comment: 4 pages including 5 figures"]}]

This seemed to undermine the original Axelrod theory that\nhomophily preserves diversity. We show that cultural diversity is surprisingly\nrobust if we increase the tendency towards homophily as follows. First, we\nraised the threshold of similarity below which influence is precluded. Second,\nwe allowed agents to be influenced by all neighbors simultaneously, instead of\nonly one neighbor as assumed in the orginal model. Computational experiments\nshow how both modifications strongly increase the robustness of diversity\nagainst mutation. We also find that our extensions may reverse at least one of\nthe main results of Axelrod. While Axelrod predicted that a larger number of\ncultural dimensions (features) reduces diversity, we find that more features\nmay entail higher levels of diversity.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 8 figures, Submitted for presentation in Mathematical\n  Sociology Session, Annual Meeting of the American Sociological Association\n  (ASA), 2007"]}]

For this purpose I propose an epistemological criterion to decide\nwhether or not a physical theory is holistic, namely: a physical theory is\nholistic if and only if it is impossible in principle to infer the global\nproperties, as assigned in the theory, by local resources available to an\nagent. I propose that these resources include at least all local operations and\nclassical communication. This approach is contrasted with the well-known\napproaches to holism in terms of supervenience. The criterion for holism\nproposed here involves a shift in emphasis from ontology to epistemology. I\napply this epistemological criterion to classical physics and Bohmian mechanics\nas represented on a phase and configuration space respectively, and for quantum\nmechanics (in the orthodox interpretation) using the formalism of general\nquantum operations as completely positive trace non-increasing maps.\nFurthermore, I provide an interesting example from which one can conclude that\nquantum mechanics is holistic in the above mentioned sense, although, perhaps\nsurprisingly, no entanglement is needed.\n","Comment: Published version"]}]

In particular, the following\nspecial case plays an important role in quantum cryptographic protocols in the\nbounded storage model: Given a string x encoded in an unknown basis chosen from\na set of mutually unbiased bases, you may perform any measurement, but then\nstore at most q qubits of quantum information. Later on, you learn which basis\nwas used. How well can you compute a function f(x) of x, given the initial\nmeasurement outcome, the q qubits and the additional basis information? We\nfirst show a lower bound on the success probability for any balanced function,\nand any number of mutually unbiased bases, beating the naive strategy of simply\nguessing the basis. We then show that for two bases, any Boolean function f(x)\ncan be computed perfectly if you are allowed to store just a single qubit,\nindependent of the number of possible input strings x. However, we show how to\nconstruct three bases, such that you need to store all qubits in order to\ncompute f(x) perfectly. We then investigate how much advantage the additional\nbasis information can give for a Boolean function. To this end, we prove\noptimal bounds for the success probability for the AND and the XOR function for\nup to three mutually unbiased bases. Our result shows that the gap in success\nprobability can be maximal: without the basis information, you can never do\nbetter than guessing the basis, but with this information, you can compute f(x)\nperfectly.
