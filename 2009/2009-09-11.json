Specifically, we find a hot metastable phase for the bulk string\nUniverse soon after the brane collision in which supersymmetry is broken, which\nwe describe by means of a subcritical world-sheet sigma model dressed by a\nspace-like Liouville field, representing finite temperature (Euclidean time).\nThis phase is followed by an inflationary phase for the brane Universe, in\nwhich the bulk string excitations are cold. This is described by a\nsuper-critical Liouville string with a time-like Liouville mode, whose zero\nmode is identified with the Minkowski target time. Finally, we speculate on\npossible ways of exiting the inflationary phase, either by means of subsequent\ncollisions or by deceleration of the brane Universe due to closed-string\nradiation from the brane to the bulk. While phase transitions from hot to cold\nconfigurations occur in the bulk string universe, stringy excitations attached\nto the brane world remain thermalized throughout, at a temperature which can be\nrelatively high. The late-time behaviour of the model results in\ndilaton-dominated dark energy and present-day acceleration of the expansion of\nthe Universe, asymptoting eventually to zero.\n","Comment: 59 pages LaTeX, 4 figures"]}]

We consider Liouville field theory on world sheets whose boundaries\nare the Wilson loops of gauge theory, which exhibit vortex and spike defects.\nWe show that world-sheet vortex condensation occurs when the Wilson loop is\nembedded in four target space-time dimensions, and show that this corresponds\nto the condensation of gauge magnetic monopoles in target space. We also show\nthat vortex condensation generates a effective string tension corresponding to\nthe confinement of electric degrees of freedom. The tension is independent of\nthe string length in a gauge theory whose electric coupling varies\nlogarithmically with the length scale. The Liouville field is naturally\ninterpreted as an extra target dimension, with an anti-de-Sitter (AdS)\nstructure induced by recoil effects on the gauge monopoles, interpreted as D\nbranes of the effective string theory. Black holes in the bulk AdS space\ncorrespond to world-sheet defects, so that phases of the bulk gravitational\nsystem correspond to the different world-sheet phases, and hence to different\nphases of the four-dimensional gauge theory. Deconfinement is associated with a\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of vortices on the Wilson-loop world\nsheet, corresponding in turn to a phase transition of the black holes in the\nbulk AdS space.\n","Comment: 29 pages LATEX, three eps figures incorporated"]}]
