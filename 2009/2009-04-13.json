In such a dynamic context, where\nthe evolution of a domain over time is considered, the idea of a causal law as\nsomething which guides this evolution is quite natural. In our formalization, a\nset of probabilistic causal laws can be used to represent a class of\nprobability trees in a concise, flexible and modular way. In this way, our work\nextends Shafer's by offering a convenient logical representation for his\nsemantical objects.\n  Second, this language also has relevance for the area of probabilistic logic\nprogramming. In particular, we prove that the formal semantics of a theory in\nour language can be equivalently defined as a probability distribution over the\nwell-founded models of certain logic programs, rendering it formally quite\nsimilar to existing languages such as ICL or PRISM. Because we can motivate and\nexplain our language in a completely self-contained way as a representation of\nprobabilistic causal laws, this provides a new way of explaining the intuitions\nbehind such probabilistic logic programs: we can say precisely which knowledge\nsuch a program expresses, in terms that are equally understandable by a\nnon-logician. Moreover, we also obtain an additional piece of knowledge\nrepresentation methodology for probabilistic logic programs, by showing how\nthey can express probabilistic causal laws.\n","Comment: To be published in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)"]}]

This is the\nfirst detection of the relativistic orbital decay of a low-mass, circular\nbinary pulsar system. The measured rate of change in orbital period, corrected\nfor acceleration biases, is dP_b/dt=(-6.4+-0.9)x10^-14. Interpreted in the\ncontext of general relativity, and combined with measurement of Shapiro delay,\nit implies a pulsar mass of 2.1+-0.2 solar masses, the most massive pulsar\nmeasured. This adds to the emerging trend toward relatively high neutron star\nmasses in neutron star--white dwarf binaries. Additionally, there is some\nevidence for an inverse correlation between pulsar mass and orbital period in\nthese systems. We consider alternatives to the general relativistic analysis of\nthe data, and we use the pulsar timing data to place limits on violations of\nthe strong equivalence principle.\n","Comment: 9 pages, Submitted to ApJ"]}]
