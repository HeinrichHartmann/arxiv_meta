The first approach is\nbased on a formal solution of the stress transport equation in which the\nproduction terms can be integrated exactly in terms of matrix exponentials.\nThis formal solution of the subgrid-scale stress transport equation is shown to\nbe useful to explore special cases, such as the response to constant velocity\ngradient, but neglecting pressure-strain correlations and diffusion effects.\nThe second approach is based on an Eulerian-Lagrangian change of variables,\ncombined with the assumption of isotropy for the conditionally averaged\nLagrangian velocity gradient tensor and with the `Recent Fluid Deformation'\n(RFD) approximation. It is shown that both approaches lead to the same basic\nclosure in which the stress tensor is expressed as the product of the matrix\nexponential of the resolved velocity gradient tensor multiplied by its\ntranspose. Short-time expansions of the matrix exponentials are shown to\nprovide an eddy-viscosity term and particular quadratic terms, and thus allow a\nreinterpretation of traditional eddy-viscosity and nonlinear stress closures.\nThe basic feasibility of the matrix-exponential closure is illustrated by\nimplementing it successfully in Large Eddy Simulation of forced isotropic\nturbulence. The matrix-exponential closure employs the drastic approximation of\nentirely omitting the pressure-strain correlation and other `nonlinear\nscrambling' terms. But unlike eddy-viscosity closures, the matrix exponential\napproach provides a simple and local closure that can be derived directly from\nthe stress transport equation with the production term, and using physically\nmotivated assumptions about Lagrangian decorrelation and upstream isotropy.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures, published version"]}]

Employing the dynamical cluster\napproximation (DCA) with a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) cluster solver for a\n4-site cluster, we observe that without phonons, the long-range hoppings, t'\nand t'', generally suppress Tc. We argue that this trend remains valid for\nlarger clusters. In the presence of the Holstein phonons, a finite t' enhances\nTc in the under-doped region for the hole-doped system, consistent with\nlocal-density approximation (LDA) calculations and experiment. This is\ninterpreted through the suppression of antiferromagnetic (AF) correlations and\nthe interplay between polaronic effects and the antiferromagnetism.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures"]}]
