Functionally\nsimilar proteins can differ substantially in their robustness to mutations and\ncapacity to evolve new functions, but it has remained unclear whether any of\nthese differences might be due to evolutionary selection for these properties.\n  RESULTS: Here we use laboratory experiments to demonstrate that evolution\nfavors protein mutational robustness if the evolving population is sufficiently\nlarge. We neutrally evolve cytochrome P450 proteins under identical selection\npressures and mutation rates in populations of different sizes, and show that\nproteins from the larger and thus more polymorphic population tend towards\nhigher mutational robustness. Proteins from the larger population also evolve\ngreater stability, a biophysical property that is known to enhance both\nmutational robustness and evolvability. The excess mutational robustness and\nstability is well described by existing mathematical theories, and can be\nquantitatively related to the way that the proteins occupy their neutral\nnetwork.\n  CONCLUSIONS: Our work is the first experimental demonstration of the general\ntendency of evolution to favor mutational robustness and protein stability in\nhighly polymorphic populations. We suggest that this phenomenon may contribute\nto the mutational robustness and evolvability of viruses and bacteria that\nexist in large populations.\n"]}]

We also want to determine physical quantities through the modeling of\nthe object's broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED). Methods: VHE\nobservations (~25h live time) of the BL Lac 1ES 0347-121 (redshift z=0.188)\nwere conducted with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) between\nAugust and December 2006. Contemporaneous X-ray and UV/optical observations\nfrom the SWIFT satellite are used to interpret the SED of the source in terms\nof a synchrotron self Compton (SSC) model. Results: An excess of 327 events,\ncorresponding to a statistical significance of 10.1 standard deviations, is\ndetected from 1ES 0347-121. Its photon spectrum, ranging from ~250GeV to ~3TeV,\nis well described by a power law with a photon index of Gamma = 3.10 +/-\n0.23_stat +/- 0.10_sys. The integral flux above 250GeV corresponds to ~2% of\nthe flux of the Crab Nebula above the same threshold. No VHE flux variability\nis detected within the data set. Conclusions: Constraints on the EBL density at\noptical to near-infrared wavelengths derived from the photon spectrum of 1ES\n0347-121 are close to the strongest limits derived previously. The strong EBL\nlimits confirm earlier findings, that the EBL density in the near-infrared is\nclose to the lower limits from source counts. This implies that the universe is\nmore transparent to VHE gamma-rays than previously believed.

The\nmain computational overhead of this method is in inverting the Hessian matrix\nof the Newton iteration. In this contribution, we propose the application of\nthe Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) algorithm as part of an efficient and\ndistributed LP solver that exploits the sparse and symmetric structure of the\nHessian matrix and avoids the need for direct matrix inversion. This approach\nshifts the computation from realm of linear algebra to that of probabilistic\ninference on graphical models, thus applying GaBP as an efficient inference\nengine. Our construction is general and can be used for any interior-point\nalgorithm which uses the Newton method, including non-linear program solvers.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 1 figure, appeared in the 46th Annual Allerton Conference on\n  Communication, Control and Computing, Allerton House, Illinois, Sept. 2008"]}]

Our previous findings indicate that\nthe orientation of a halo CME elongation may correspond to the orientation of\nthe underlyig flux rope. Here we revisit these preliminary reports by comparing\norientation angles of elongated LASCO CMEs, both full and partial halos, to the\npost eruption arcades. Based on 100 analysed events, it was found that the\noverwhelming majority of halo CMEs are elongated in the direction of the axial\nfield of the post eruptio arcades. Moreover, this conclusion also holds for\npartial halo CMEs as well as for events that originate further from the disk\ncenter. This suggests that the projection effect does not drastically change\nthe appearance of full and partial halos and their imagesstill bear reliable\ninformation about the underlying magnetic fields. We also compared orientations\nof the erupted fields near the Sun and in the interplanetary space and found\nthat the local tiltof the coronal neutral line at 2.5 solar radii is well\ncorrelated with the magnetic cloud axis measured near the Earth.
