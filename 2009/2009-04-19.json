In the\ncoming decade, non-Gaussianity, i.e., the study of non-Gaussian contributions\nto the correlations of cosmological fluctuations, will become an important\nprobe of both the early and the late Universe. Specifically, it will play a\nleading role in furthering our understanding of two fundamental aspects of\ncosmology and astrophysics: (i) the physics of the very early universe that\ncreated the primordial seeds for large-scale structures, and (ii) the\nsubsequent growth of structures via gravitational instability and gas physics\nat later times. To date, observations of fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) and the Large-Scale Structure of the Universe (LSS) have\nfocused largely on the Gaussian contribution as measured by the two-point\ncorrelations (or the power spectrum) of density fluctuations. However, an even\ngreater amount of information is contained in non-Gaussianity and a large\ndiscovery space therefore still remains to be explored. Many observational\nprobes can be used to measure non-Gaussianity, including CMB, LSS,\ngravitational lensing, Lyman-alpha forest, 21-cm fluctuations, and the\nabundance of rare objects such as clusters of galaxies and high-redshift\ngalaxies.
