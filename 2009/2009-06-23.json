Spin-modulated radial\nvelocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first\ntime in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600\nkm/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the\nouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion\ncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler\ntomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending\nfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the\ntheoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and\nNorton et al.

The first is ignition in a layer containing a mixture of heavier\nelements from the ashes. If ignition occurs at the base of the mixed layer,\nrecurrence times as short as ~5-30 minutes are possible. This may explain the\nshort recurrence time of some bursts, but incomplete burning is still needed to\nexplain these bursts' energetics. When mixing is sufficiently strong, a second\nregime is found where accreted helium mixes deep enough to burn stably,\nquenching X-ray bursts. We speculate that the observed change in X-ray burst\nproperties near one-tenth the Eddington accretion rate is from this mechanism.\nThe carbon-rich material produced by stable helium burning would be important\nfor triggering and fueling superbursts.

Applied to\nthe Milky Way and M31 this gives V_{vir}^{MW}=109 +/- 22$ km/s and\nV_{vir}^{M31} = 138 +/- 35 km/s, respectively, substantially lower than the\nrotation speed of their disk components. The detailed kinematics of simulated\nsatellites and dark matter are also in good agreement. By contrast, the stellar\nhalo of the simulated galaxies is kinematically and spatially distinct from the\npopulation of surviving satellites. This is because the survival of a satellite\ndepends on mass and on time of accretion; surviving satellites are biased\ntoward low-mass systems that have been recently accreted by the galaxy. Our\nresults support recent proposals for the origin of the systematic differences\nbetween stars in the Galactic halo and in Galactic satellites: the elusive\n``building blocks'' of the Milky Way stellar halo were on average more massive,\nand were accreted (and disrupted) earlier than the population of dwarfs that\nhas survived self-bound until the present.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 11 figures, MNRAS in press.

The first model represents a stochastically-perturbed flux\ntransport dynamo. Here even very weak stochastic perturbations can give rise to\nsignificant modulation in the activity cycle. This modulation leads to a loss\nof predictability.

This phenomenon has been termed ``standing accretion shock\ninstability'' (SASI). It is shown here that the SASI oscillations can trigger\nconvective instability and like the latter they lead to an increase of the\naverage shock radius and of the mass in the gain layer. Both hydrodynamic\ninstabilities in combination stretch the advection time of matter through the\nneutrino-heating layer and thus enhance the neutrino energy deposition in\nsupport of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. A rapidly contracting and\nmore compact nascent NS turns out to be favorable for explosions, because the\naccretion luminosity and neutrino heating are larger and the growth rate of the\nSASI is higher. Moreover, we show that the oscillation period of the SASI and a\nvariety of other features in our simulations agree with estimates for the\nadvective-acoustic cycle (AAC), in which perturbations are carried by the\naccretion flow from the shock to the neutron star and pressure waves close an\namplifying global feedback loop.

The resulting shock has\nsubsequently produced steadily brightening radio synchrotron emission, which is\nresolved by the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) into an expanding\nlimb-brightened shell. Here we present 15 years of ATCA imaging of Supernova\n1987A, at an effective angular resolution of 0.4 arcsec. We find that the radio\nremnant has accelerated in its expansion over this period, from approx 3600\nkm/s in 1992 to approx 5200 km/s at the end of 2006. The published diameters of\nthe evolving X-ray shell have been ~15% smaller than the corresponding radio\nvalues, but a simultaneous Fourier analysis of both radio and X-ray data\neliminates this discrepancy, and yields a current diameter for the shell in\nboth wave-bands of approx 1.7 arcsec. An asymmetric brightness distribution is\nseen in radio images at all ATCA epochs: the eastern and western rims have\nhigher fluxes than the northern and southern regions, indicating that most of\nthe radio emission comes from the equatorial plane of the system, where the\nprogenitor star's circumstellar wind is thought to be densest. The eastern lobe\nis brighter than and further from the supernova site than the western lobe,\nsuggesting an additional asymmetry in the initial distribution of supernova\nejecta.\n","Comment: 10 pages, including 7 b/w + 1 color embedded EPS figures; uses\n  aipproc.cls .

The wake distribution is thus asymmetric, giving\nrise to the drag forces in both opposite (azimuthal) and lateral (radial)\ndirections to the motion of the perturber, although the latter does not\ncontribute to orbital decay much.

We argue\nthat a standard disk dominates the radiative output for radii larger than a\ncharacteristic transition radius R_c ~ mdot x R_{ISCO}, where mdot is the\naccretion rate in Eddington units and R_{ISCO} is the innermost stable orbit.\nFor R_{ISCO} < R < R_c, most of the accretion power is released via non-thermal\nprocesses. We predict the location of such sources in a luminosity-temperature\nplot. We conclude that black holes with masses ~ 50-100 Msun accreting at mdot\n~ 10-20 may explain the X-ray properties of many ULXs.\n","Comment: 14 pages, accepted for publication on Advances in Space Research.\n  Based on work presented at the 2006 Cospar Scientific Assembly"]}]

Radio continuum observations of the galaxy were carried out at 320\nMHz, 610 MHz and 1.4 GHz. Continuum emission was detected and mapped in the\ngalaxy. The emission appears extended over the inner disk at all three\nfrequencies. At 1.4 GHz and 610 MHz it appears to have two distinct lobes.

We find\na CIV 1549 BC profile blueshift that is strongly concentrated among (largely\nradio-quiet: RQ) sources with FWHM(H beta BC) < 4000 km/s (which we call\nPopulation A). Narrow line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1, with FWHM H beta < 2000 km/s)\nsources belong to this population but do not emerge as a distinct class. The\nsystematic blueshift, widely interpreted as arising in a disk wind/outflow, is\nnot observed in broader lined AGN which we call Population B.

We show that these planetesimals generally cannot pass through\nthe mean motion resonances of the cores, and the suppression of planetesimal\nbombardment rate enables the cores to accrete gas with little interruption.\nDuring growth from the cores to protoplanets, as the resonances overlap with\neach other, the trapped planetesimals become dynamically unstable and their\neccentricity excitation is strongly enhanced. Subsequent gas drag induces the\nplanetesimals to migrate and collide with the protoplanet. This process leads\nto the resumption and a surge of planetesimal bombardment during the advanced\nstage of the protoplanet growth. This mechanism may account for the diversity\nof the core-envelope structure between Jupiter, Saturn and the metallicity\ndispersion inferred from the transiting extra solar planets.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 12 figures, accpeted for publication in ApJ"]}]

The emission line ratios, luminosities and PAH EWs are\nconsistent with the starbursts and AGN in ULIRGs being more extincted, and for\nthe starbursts more compact, versions of those in lower luminosity systems. The\nexcitations and electron densities in the NLRs of ULIRGs appear comparable to\nthose of lower luminosity starbursts, though there is evidence that the NLR gas\nin ULIRGs is more dense. We show that the combined luminosity of the 12.81um\n[NeII] and 15.56um [NeIII] lines correlates with both IR luminosity and the\nluminosity of the 6.2 micron and 11.2 micron PAH features in ULIRGs, and use\nthis to derive a calibration between PAH luminosity and star formation rate.\nFinally, we show that ULIRGs with 0.8 < S_sil < 2.4 are likely to be powered\nmainly by star formation, but that ULIRGs with S_sil < 0.8, and possibly those\nwith S_sil > 2.4, contain an IR-luminous AGN.\n","Comment: 62 pages in preprint format, 4 tables, 23 figures.

A similar result is found for gas with Z = 10^-6 Zsun. Gas with Z <=\n10^-6 Zsun behaves roughly isothermally at these densities (with polytropic\nexponent gamma ~ 1.06) and the massive disk-like structures that form due to\nangular momentum conservation will be marginally unstable. As fragmentation is\nless efficient, we expect stars with Z <= 10^-6 Zsun to be massive, with masses\nin excess of several tens of solar masses, consistent with the results from\nprevious studies.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures.

The\nradial velocity information can be used to construct an effective photometric\nfollow-up strategy which will provide optimal detection of possible transits.\nSince the planet-harbouring stars are already known in this case, one is only\nlimited by the photometric precision achieveable by the chosen\ntelescope/instrument. The radial velocity modelling code presented here\nautomatically produces a transit ephemeris for each planet dataset fitted by\nthe program. Since the transit duration is brief compared with the fitted\nperiod, we calculate the maximum window for obtaining photometric transit\nobservations after the radial velocity data have been obtained, generalising\nfor eccentric orbits. We discuss a typically employed survey strategy which may\ncontribute to a possible radial velocity bias against detection of the very hot\nJupiters which have dominated the transit discoveries. Finally, we describe how\nthese methods can be applied to current and future radial velocity surveys.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS, minor\n  correction"]}]

All the X-ray data can be\nfit using the same model (with no systematic evolution or short-term\nvariability) but this has a surprising requirement: the X-ray emitting regions\nhave a very large abundance of helium. This would be consistent with the X-ray\nemitting shocks being located in a helium-rich layer that was ejected by the\nprogenitor star, or helium-rich material was ejected in the supernova\nexplosion.

Both long term X-ray light curves, X-ray spectra, the rapid\nX-ray variability and the radio jet behaviour are consistent with a model where\na standard outer accretion disc is truncated at low luminosities, being\nreplaced by a hot, inner flow which also acts as the launching site of the jet.\nDecreasing the disc truncation radius leads to softer spectra, as well as\nhigher frequencies (including QPO's) in the power spectra, and a faster jet.\nThe collapse of the hot flow when the disc reaches the last stable orbit\ntriggers the dramatic decrease in radio flux, as well as giving a qualitative\n(and often quantitative) explanation for the major hard--soft spectral\ntransition seen in black holes and neutron stars.\n  After collapse of the hot inner flow, the spectrum in black hole systems can\nbe dominated by the disc emission. Its behaviour is consistent with the\nexistence of a last stable orbit, and such data can be used to estimate the\nblack hole spin. These systems can also show very different spectra at these\nhigh luminosities, in which the disc spectrum is strongly distorted by\nComptonization. The structure of the accretion flow becomes increasingly\nuncertain as the luminosity approaches (and exceeds) the Eddington luminosity,\nthough there is growing evidence that winds play an important role. We stress\nthat these high Eddington fraction flows are key to understanding many\ndisparate and currently very active fields such as ULX, Narrow Line Seyfert\n1's, and the growth of the first black holes in the Early Universe.\n","Comment: 76 pages, accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics\n  Reviews"]}]

Galaxy morphology is found to depend critically on the local\nenvironment set up by the nearest neighbor galaxy in addition to luminosity and\nthe large scale density. When a galaxy is located farther than the virial\nradius from its closest neighbor, the probability for the galaxy to have an\nearly morphological type is an increasing function only of luminosity and the\nlocal density due to the nearest neighbor ($\\rho_n$). The tide produced by the\nnearest neighbor is thought to be responsible for the morphology transformation\ntoward the early type at these separations. When the separation is less than\nthe virial radius, i.e. when $\\rho_n > \\rho_{\\rm virial}$, its morphology\ndepends also on the neighbor's morphology and the large-scale background\ndensity over a few Mpc scales ($\\rho_{20}$) in addition to luminosity and\n$\\rho_n$. The early type probability keeps increasing as $\\rho_n$ increases if\nits neighbor is an early type. But the probability decreases as $\\rho_n$\nincreases when the neighbor is a late type. The cold gas streaming from the\nlate type neighbor can be the reason for the morphology transformation toward\nlate type. The overall early-type fraction increases as $\\rho_{20}$ increases\nwhen $\\rho_n > \\rho_{\\rm virial}$. This can be attributed to the hot halo gas\nof the neighbor which is confined by the pressure of the ambient medium held by\nthe background mass.

But even though ansae have been known for a long time, no\nstatistical analysis of their relative frequency of occurrence has been\nperformed yet. Similarly, there has been no study of the varieties in\nmorphology of ansae even though significant morphological variations are known\nto characterise the features. In this paper, we make a quantitative analysis of\nthe occurrence of ansae in barred galaxies, making use of {\\it The de\nVaucouleurs Atlas of Galaxies} by Buta and coworkers. We find that $\\sim 40%$\nof SB0's show ansae in their bars, thus confirming that ansae are common\nfeatures in barred lenticulars. The ansa frequency decreases dramatically with\nlater types, and hardly any ansae are found in galaxies of type Sb or later.\nThe bars in galaxies with ansae are stronger in the median than those in\ngalaxies without ansae, but the presence of inner and outer rings is not\nrelated to the presence of ansae. Implications of these results and theories\nfor the possible origin of ansae are discussed briefly.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, accepted for publication in AJ"]}]

The field binary fraction in the same\nrange is a factor 1.5 higher. Within the range 150 AU to 675 AU we find that T\nTauri associations have a factor 2.2 more binaries than the ONC. The binary\nseparation distribution function of the ONC shows unusual structure, with a\nsudden steep decrease in the number of binaries as the separation increases\nbeyond 0.5\", corresponding to 225 AU. We have measured the ratio of binaries\nwider than 0.5\" to binaries closer than 0.5\" as a function of distance from the\nTrapezium, and find that this ratio is significantly depressed in the inner\nregion of the ONC. The deficit of wide binaries in the central part of the\ncluster is likely due to dissolution or orbital change during their passage\nthrough the potential well of the inner cluster region. Many of the companions\nare likely to be brown dwarfs.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables, accepted by the Astronomical Journal"]}]

We also study how our results depend on the merger orbit and the\nsize of the core radius of the initial GC density distribution. We find that a\nmajor dry merger makes the GC profile flatter, and the steeper initial GC\nprofile leads to more significant flattening, especially if the initial slope\nis steeper than $\\alpha\\sim3.5$. Our result suggests that if there is a major\ndry merger of elliptical galaxies whose red GCs have a steeper radial profile\nthan the blue GCs, as currently observed, and their slopes are steeper than\n$\\alpha\\sim3.5$, the difference in the slopes between two populations becomes\nsmaller after dry mergers. Therefore, the observed slopes of red and blue GCs\ncan be a diagnostic of the importance of dry merger.

These may arise in the aftermath of events like mergers, accretion,\nand tidal interactions. These events are key in the evolution of galaxies. In\nthis paper we quantify the large-scale lopsidedness of light distributions in\n25155 galaxies at z < 0.06 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4\nusing the m = 1 azimuthal Fourier mode. We show that the lopsided distribution\nof light is primarily due to a corresponding lopsidedness in the stellar mass\ndistribution. Observational effects, such as seeing, Poisson noise, and\ninclination, introduce only small errors in lopsidedness for the majority of\nthis sample. We find that lopsidedness correlates strongly with other basic\ngalaxy structural parameters: galaxies with low concentration, stellar mass,\nand stellar surface mass density tend to be lopsided, while galaxies with high\nconcentration, mass, and density are not. We find that the strongest and most\nfundamental relationship between lopsidedness and the other structural\nparameters is with the surface mass density. We also find, in agreement with\nprevious studies, that lopsidedness tends to increase with radius. Both these\nresults may be understood as a consequence of several factors. The outer\nregions of galaxies and low-density galaxies are more susceptible to tidal\nperturbations, and they also have longer dynamical times (so lopsidedness will\nlast longer). They are also more likely to be affected by any underlying\nasymmetries in the dark matter halo.\n","Comment: 42 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables, accepted to ApJ"]}]

After subtracting off\na mild excess of OVI arising from the Local Bubble, combining our new results\nwith earlier surveys of OVI, and eliminating stars that show conspicuous\nlocalized X-ray emission, we find an average OVI mid-plane density n_0 = 1.3e-8\ncm^-3. The density decreases away from the plane of the Galaxy in a way that is\nconsistent with an exponential scale height of 3.2 kpc at negative latitudes or\n4.6 kpc at positive latitudes. Average volume densities of OVI along different\nsight lines exhibit a dispersion of about 0.26 dex, irrespective of the\ndistances to the target stars. This indicates that OVI does not arise in\nrandomly situated clouds of a fixed size and density, but instead is\ndistributed in regions that have a very broad range of column densities, with\nthe more strongly absorbing clouds having a lower space density. Line widths\nand centroid velocities are much larger than those expected from differential\nGalactic rotation, but they are nevertheless correlated with distance and\nN(OVI), which reinforces our picture of a diverse population of hot plasma\nregions that are ubiquitous over the entire Galactic disk. The velocity\nextremes of the OVI profiles show a loose correlation with those of very strong\nlines of less ionized species, supporting a picture of a turbulent, multiphase\nmedium churned by shock-heated gas from multiple supernova explosions.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJS.

In the dipole\nspin-down formalism, the 2-sigma upper limits on their period derivatives, <\n2E-16 for both pulsars, implies surface magnetic field strengths of B_s < 3E11\nG and spin periods at birth equal to their present periods to three significant\ndigits.

STAGE 2 is accretion\nonto a quark-star, launching an ultrarelativistic jet generating the prompt\nGRB. This jet also creates the afterglow as the jet interacts with the\nsurrounding medium creating an external shock. Slower shells ejected from the\nquark star (during accretion), can re-energize the external shock leading to a\nflatter segment in the X-ray afterglow. STAGE 3, which occurs only if the\nquark-star collapses to form a black-hole, consists of an accreting black-hole.\nThe jet launched in this accretion process interacts with the preceding quark\nstar jet, and could generate the flaring activity frequently seen in early\nX-ray afterglows. Alternatively, a STAGE 2b can occur in our model if the quark\nstar does not collapse to a black hole.

We stress that there exist modes that\ndo not satisfy the WKB condition during the shear-dominated regime and for\nwhich the amplitude at the end of inflation depends on unknown initial\nconditions. On such scales, inflation loses its predictability. This study\npaves the way to the determination of the cosmological signature of a\nprimordial shear, whatever the Bianchi I spacetime. It thus stresses the\nimportance of the WKB regime to draw inflationary predictions and demonstrates\nthat when the number of e-folds is large enough, the predictions converge\ntoward those of inflation in a Friedmann-Lemaitre spacetime but that they are\nless robust in the case of an inflationary era with a small number of e-folds.\n","Comment: 48 pages"]}]

For several locally isotropic but inhomogeneous\ndiffusion coefficients, the steady-state turbulence spectra are nearly\nisotropic in the absence of damping and can be fitted by a single power-law\nfunction.

The vertical grid spacing in all\nthe model is non-uniform, and is less in the upper region so that the flows are\nbetter resolved in the region of interest. We find that the penetration\ndistance increases as the rotation rate increases for the case when the\nrotation vector is aligned with the vertical axis. However, with the increase\nin the stability of the upper stable layer, the upward penetration distance\ndecreases. Since we are not able to afford computations with finer resolution\nfor all the models, we compute a number of models to see the effect of\nincreased resolution on the upward penetration. In addition, we estimate the\nupper limit on the upward convective penetration from stellar convective cores.\n","Comment: Accepted for Publication in Asttrophysics & Space Science"]}]

Major difficulties with the dynamo\nparadigm are considered. It is particularly important to understand the\nnonlinear saturation of dynamos, and whether the fields produced are coherent\nenough on large-scales to explain the observed fields in galaxies and clusters.\nAt the same time the alternative possibility of a primordial field lacks firm\ntheoretical support but can have very interesting observational consequences.\n","Comment: 16 pages, To appear in the proceedings of \"From Planets to Dark\n  Energy: the Modern Radio Universe\", eds.

We infer a mean ``visible'' accretion rate of cold\ngas in galaxies of at least 0.2 Msol/yr.

An ADAF is a poor radiator, and the ion temperature can approach\n10^{12} K near the center, although the electrons are cooler, with their\ntemperature typically capped at ~10^{9-11} K. The foundational papers predicted\nthat the large thermal energy in an ADAF would drive strong winds and jets, as\nlater observed and also confirmed in computer simulations. Of chief interest,\nhowever, is the accreting gas that races inward. It carries the bulk of the\naccretion energy as stored thermal energy, which vanishes without a trace as\nthe gas passes through the hole's event horizon. One thus expects black holes\nin the ADAF regime to be unusually faint. Indeed, this is confirmed by a\ncomparison of accreting stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars, which\nreside in very similar transient X-ray binary systems. The black holes are on\naverage observed to be fainter by a factor of ~100-1000. The natural\nexplanation is that a neutron star must radiate the advected thermal energy\nfrom its surface, whereas a black hole can hide the energy behind its event\nhorizon. The case for an event horizon in Sagittarius A*, which is immune to\ncaveats on jet outflows and is furthermore independent of the ADAF model, is\nespecially compelling.

These photons thus can heat or cool electrons at other\nradii via Compton scattering. This effect has been ignored in most previous\nworks on hot accretion flows and is the focus of this paper. If the mass\naccretion rate is described by $\\dot{M}=\\dot{M}_0(r/r_{\\rm out})^{0.3}$ and\n$r_{\\rm out}=10^4r_{\\rm s}$, we find that the Compton scattering will play a\ncooling and heating role at $r\\la 5\\times 10^3 r_{\\rm s}$ and $r\\ga 5\\times\n10^3 r_{\\rm s}$, respectively. Specifically, when $\\dot{M}_0>0.1L_{\\rm\nEdd}/c^2$, the Compton cooling rate is larger than the local viscous heating\nrate at certain radius; therefore the cooling effect is important. When\n$\\dot{M}_0>2L_{\\rm Edd}/c^2$, the heating effect at $r_{\\rm out}$ is important.\nWe can obtain the self-consistent steady solution with the global Compton\neffect included only if $\\dot{M}_0\\la L_{\\rm Edd}/c^2$ for $r_{\\rm\nout}=50r_{\\rm s}$, which corresponds to $L\\la 0.02L_{\\rm Edd}$.

Indeed, it allows a consistent\ncombination of angular and linear diameters of the star. We aim to determine\nconsistent projection factors that include the dynamical structure of the\nCepheids' atmosphere. Methods. Hydrodynamical models of delta Cep and l Car\nhave been used to validate a spectroscopic method of determining the projection\nfactor. This method, based on the amplitude of the radial velocity curve, is\napplied to eight stars observed with the HARPS spectrometer. The projection\nfactor is divided into three sub-concepts : (1) a geometrical effect, (2) the\nvelocity gradient within the atmosphere, and (3) the relative motion of the\n\"optical\" pulsating photosphere compared to the corresponding mass elements\n(hereafter fo-g). Both, (1) and (3) are deduced from geometrical and\nhydrodynamical models, respectively, while (2) is derived directly from\nobservations. The Fe I 4896.439 A line is found to be the best one to use in\nthe context of IBW and SB methods. A coherent and consistent period-projection\nfactor relation (hereafter Pp relation) is derived for this specific spectral\nline: p = [0.064 +- 0.020] log P + [1.376 +- 0.023]. This procedure is then\nextended to derive dynamic projection factors for any spectral line of any\nCepheid.

The reliable removal of very weak stellar lines\nfrom the catalog, and of some stellar lines from the less severe blends with\nDIBs, is made generally easy by the highly variable radial velocities of both\nstars.

Given the\nlow S/N ratio of the SBF signal in the blue band images, the reliability of the\nmeasurements is verified both with numerical simulations and experimental data\ntests.\n  This paper presents the first published B- and I-band SBF measurements for\ndistant ($\\geq$ 20 Mpc) galaxies, essential for the comparisons of the models\nto observations of normal ellipticals. By comparing I-band data with our new\nSimple Stellar Population (SSP) models we find an excellent agreement and we\nconfirm that I-band SBF magnitudes are mainly sensitive to the metallicity of\nthe dominant stellar component in the galaxy, and are not strongly affected by\nthe contribution of possible secondary stellar components. As a consequence\nI-band fluctuations magnitudes are ideal for distance studies. On the other\nhand, we show that standard SSP models do not reproduce the B-band SBF\nmagnitudes of red ($(B-I)_0 \\gsim 2.1$) galaxies in our sample. We explore the\ncapability of two non--canonical models in properly reproducing the high\nsensitivity of B SBF to the presence of even small fractions of bright, hot\nstars (metal poor stars, hot evolved stars, etc.). The disagreement is solved\nboth by taking into account hot (Post--AGB) stars in SSP models and/or by\nadopting Composite Stellar Population models. Finally, we suggest a limit value\nof the S/N for the B-band SBF signal required to carry out a detailed study of\nstellar population properties based on this technique.\n","Comment: ApJ accepted"]}]
