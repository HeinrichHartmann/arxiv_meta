A detailed analysis of the effective capacity is carried out in\nthe low-power, wideband, and high--signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. In the\nlow-power analysis, expressions for the first and second derivatives of the\neffective capacity with respect to SNR at SNR= 0 are obtained under various\nassumptions on the degree of channel state information at the transmitter.\nTransmission strategies that are optimal in the sense of achieving the first\nand second derivatives are identified.

This group theoretical property was believed by Einstein to be\na relevant one from a physical standpoint, because the general coordinates\nallowed to introduce reference frames not limited to the inertial reference\nframes that can be associated with the Minkowski coordinate systems, whose\ntransformation group was perceived to be restricted to the Poincar\\'e group.\nTwo years later, however, Kretschmann published a paper in which the physical\nrelevance of the group theoretical achievement in the general relativity of\n1915 was denied. For Kretschmann, since any theory, whatever its physical\ncontent, can be rewritten in a generally covariant form, the group of general\ncoordinate transformations is physically irrelevant. This is not the case,\nhowever, for the group of the infinitesimal motions that bring the metric field\nin itself, namely, for the Killing group.

The graphical structure of\ninternet has been studied extensively to provide efficient solutions to routing\nand other problems. But most of these studies assume a central authority which\ncontrols and manages the internet. In the recent years game theoretic models\nhave been proposed which do not require a central authority and the users are\nassumed to be routing their flows selfishly. The existence of Nash Equilibria,\ncongestion and the amount of inefficiency caused by this selfish routing is a\nmajor concern in this field. A type of paradox in the selfish routing networks,\nBraess' Paradox, first discovered by Braess, is a major contributor to\ninefficiency. Several pricing mechanisms have also been provided which give a\ngame theoretical model between users(consumers) and ISPs ({Internet Service\nProviders} or sellers) for the internet.\n  We propose a novel pricing mechanism, based on real world Internet network\narchitecture, which reduces the severity of Braess' Paradox in selfish routing\ngame theoretic networks.
