In the first part we explain how the study of\nthe probability density function (pdf) of the fluctuations of total energy is\nrelated to the characterization of velocity correlations. Two different regimes\nare addressed: the gas driven at the boundaries and the homogeneously driven\ngas. In a granular gas, due to non-Gaussianity of the velocity pdf or lack of\nhomogeneity in hydrodynamics profiles, even in the absence of velocity\ncorrelations, the fluctuations of total energy are non-trivial and may lead to\nerroneous conclusions about the role of correlations. In the second part of the\nchapter we take into consideration the fluctuations of injected power in driven\ngranular gas models. Recently, real and numerical experiments have been\ninterpreted as evidence that the fluctuations of power injection seem to\nsatisfy the Gallavotti-Cohen Fluctuation Relation. We will discuss an\nalternative interpretation of such results which invalidates the\nGallavotti-Cohen symmetry.

This is a particular problem for image sizes much larger than the\ndiffraction limit, as is likely to be the case if Adaptive Optics systems are\nnot initially able to deliver highly corrected images over the full field of\nthe instrument or if signal/noise considerations require large spatial samples.\nIn this case, there is a potential advantage in image slicing to reduce the\neffective slitwidth and hence the beam size. However, this implies larger\ndetectors and oversizing of the optics which may cancel out the advantage. By\nthe means of a toy model of a spectrograph whose dimensions are calibrated\nusing existing instruments, the size and relative cost of spectrographs for\nELTs have been estimated. Using a range of scaling laws derived from the\nreference instruments, it is possible to estimate the uncertainties in the\npredictions and to explore the consequences of different design strategies. The\nmodel predicts major cost savings (2 - 100x) by slicing with factors of 5-20\ndepending on the type of spectrograph. The predictions suggest that it is\nbetter to accommodate the multiplicity of slices within a single spectrograph\nrather than distribute them among smaller, cheaper replicas in a parallel\narchitecture, but the replication option provides an attractive upgrade path to\nintegral field spectroscopy (IFS) as the input image quality is improved...\n[Full abstract in text]\n","Comment: Published in MNRAS"]}]

The method is very elementary, using the\nsimple unitary matrices introduced by Schwinger in 1960, together with their\ndiagonalizations. The Vandermonde matrix based on the $d$-th roots of unity\nplays a major role. This allows us to show the existence of a set of 3 MUB's in\nany dimension, to give conditions for existence of more than 3 MUB's for $d$\neven or odd number, and to recover the known result of existence of $d+1$ MUB's\nfor $d$ a prime number. Furthermore the construction of these MUB's is very\nexplicit. As a by-product, we recover results about Gauss Sums, known in number\ntheory, but which have apparently not been previously derived from MUB\nproperties.\n","Comment: International Conference on Transport and Spectral Problems in\n  Quantum Mechanics held in Honor of Jean-Michel Combes, Cergy Pontoise :\n  France (2006)"]}]
