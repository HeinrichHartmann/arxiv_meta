The results of the theoretical calculations of ionization\nrates of Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs Rydberg atoms are presented. Calculations have\nbeen performed for nS, nP and nD states which are commonly used in a variety of\nexperiments, at principal quantum numbers n=8-65 and at the three ambient\ntemperatures of 77, 300 and 600 K. A peculiarity of our calculations is that we\ntake into account the contributions of BBR-induced redistribution of population\nbetween Rydberg states prior to photoionization and field ionization by\nextraction electric field pulses. The obtained results show that these\nphenomena affect both the magnitude of measured ionization rates and shapes of\ntheir dependences on n. A Cooper minimum for BBR-induced transitions between\nbound Rydberg states of Li has been found. The calculated ionization rates are\ncompared with our earlier measurements of BBR-induced ionization rates of Na nS\nand nD Rydberg states with n=8-20 at 300 K. A good agreement for all states\nexcept nS with n>15 is observed. Useful analytical formulas for quick\nestimation of BBR ionization rates of Rydberg atoms are presented. Application\nof BBR-induced ionization signal to measurements of collisional ionization\nrates is demonstrated.\n","Comment: 36 pages, 16 figures.

The morphologies of shock front in interplanetary\nspace and MC body behave as a central concave and a smooth arc respectively.\nThe compression and rotation of magnetic field serve as an efficient mechanism\nto cause a large geomagnetic storm. The MC is highly compressed by the the\novertaking shock. Contrarily, the transport time of incidental shock influenced\nby the MC depends on the interval between their commencements. Maximum\ngeoeffectiveness results from that when the shock enters the core of preceding\nMC, which is also substantiated to some extent by a corresponding simplified\nanalytic model. Quantified by $Dst$ index, the specific result gives that the\ngeoeffectiveness of an individual MC is largely enhanced with 80% increment in\nmaximum by an incidental shock.\n","Comment: 45 pages, 9 figures"]}]
