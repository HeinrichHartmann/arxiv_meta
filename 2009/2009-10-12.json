The continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) is one such\ngenerative model whose popularity extends to a variety of disciplines ranging\nfrom computational finance to human genetics and genomics. A common theme among\nthese diverse applications is the need to simulate sample paths of a CTMC\nconditional on realized data that is discretely observed. Here we present a\ngeneral solution to this sampling problem when the CTMC is defined on a\ndiscrete and finite state space. Specifically, we consider the generation of\nsample paths, including intermediate states and times of transition, from a\nCTMC whose beginning and ending states are known across a time interval of\nlength $T$. We first unify the literature through a discussion of the three\npredominant approaches: (1) modified rejection sampling, (2) direct sampling,\nand (3) uniformization. We then give analytical results for the complexity and\nefficiency of each method in terms of the instantaneous transition rate matrix\n$Q$ of the CTMC, its beginning and ending states, and the length of sampling\ntime $T$. In doing so, we show that no method dominates the others across all\nmodel specifications, and we give explicit proof of which method prevails for\nany given $Q,T,$ and endpoints.

Follow-up optical spectra have been obtained for ~900 of these objects. A\nthree step process is used to obtain metal abundances for these galaxies.

Using secondary metallicity indicators R_23 and p_3,\nwe calculate metallicities for an additional 59 galaxies with spectra that\ncover a similar wavelength range but lack [OIII]4363. The results are used to\ncalibrate relations between metallicity and two readily observed emission-line\nratios, which allow us to estimate coarse metallicities for 519 galaxies in\ntotal. The uncertainty in these latter abundance estimates is 0.16 dex. From\nthe large, homogeneously observed sample of star-forming galaxies we identify\nlow metallicity candidates for future study and investigate the\nmetallicity-luminosity relation. We find a linear metallicity-luminosity\nrelation of the following form: 12 + log(O/H) = 4.059 - 0.240 M_B, with an RMS\nscatter of 0.252. This result implies that the slope of the metallicity-\nluminosity relation is steeper than when dwarf galaxies are considered alone,\nand may be evidence that the relationship is not linear over the full\nluminosity range of the sample.\n","Comment: 15 pages, including 7 figures and 4 tables.

The target objects range from deeply\nembedded Class 0 sources to optical T Tauri sources. This is the first\nsub-arcsecond survey of the 2.7 mm dust continuum emission from young, embedded\nstellar systems. The images show a diversity of structure and complexity. The\noptically visible T Tauri stars (DG Tauri, HL Tauri, GG Tauri,and GM Aurigae)\nhave continuum emission dominated by compact, less than 1\", circumstellar\ndisks. The more embedded near-infrared sources (SVS13 and L1551 IRS5) have\ncontinuum emission that is extended and compact. The embedded sources (L1448\nIRS3, NGC1333 IRAS2, NGC1333 IRAS4, VLA1623, and IRAS 16293-2422) have\ncontinuum emission dominated by the extended envelope, typically more than 85%.\nIn fact, in many of the deeply embedded systems it is difficult to uniquely\nisolate the disk emission component from the envelope extending inward to AU\nsize scales. All of the target embedded objects are in multiple systems with\nseparations on scales of 30\" or less. Based on the system separation, we place\nthe objects into three categories: separate envelope (separation > 6500 AU),\ncommon envelope (separation 150-3000 AU), and common disk (separation < 100\nAU). These three groups can be linked with fragmentation events during the star\nformation process: separate envelopes from prompt initial fragmentation and the\nseparate collapse of a loosely condensed cloud, common envelopes from\nfragmentation of a moderately centrally condensed spherical system, and common\ndisk from fragmentation of a high angular momentum circumstellar disk.\n","Comment: 47 Pages, 18 Figures, ApJ accepted"]}]

Moreover, phonon densities of states have been calculated and\ncompared for the insulating, underdoped, optimally doped and overdoped state of\nLaCuO. From our modeling of the normal state a consistent picture of the\nsuperconducting phase also can be extracted qualitatively pointing in the\nunderdoped regime to a phase ordering transition. On the other hand, the\nmodeling of the optimal and overdoped state is consistent with a quasi-particle\npicture with a well defined Fermi surface. Thus, in the latter case a Fermi\nsurface instability with an evolution of pairs of well defined quasiparticles\nis possible and can lead to a BCS-type ordering. So, it is tempting to\nspeculate that optimal $T_C$ in the HTSC's marks a crossover region between\nthese two forms of ordering.\n","Comment: 18 RevTex pages, 10 figures, revised version, references updated,\n  accepted for publication in Physical Review B"]}]
