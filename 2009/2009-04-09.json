The approach combines a non-equilibrium\nGreen's function (NEGF) description of the non-equilibrium junction with a\ngeneralized scattering theory formulation for evaluating the light scattering\nsignal.

There is\nonly a single parameter for this model that is meant to introduce a small\namount of randomness in the otherwise preferential attachment based growth\nprocess. The experiments with this model parameter indicates that the choice of\nconsonants among the languages within a family are far more preferential than\nit is across the families. The implications of this result are twofold -- (a)\nthere is an innate preference of the speakers towards acquiring certain\nlinguistic structures over others and (b) shared ancestry propels the stronger\npreferential connection between the languages within a family than across them.\nFurthermore, our observations indicate that this parameter might bear a\ncorrelation with the period of existence of the language families under\ninvestigation.\n","Comment: In EACL 2009 Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of Computational Language\n  Acquisition"]}]

The first part deals with\npion-nucleon/meson-baryon scattering in the Kadyshevsky formalism. This\nformalism is introduced and discussed. Problems may arise when derivative\ncouplings and/or higher spin fields are used, especially when compared to the\nresults in the Feynman formalism: unwanted contact terms pop-up. These terms\nare cancelled using the Gross and Jackiw or Takahashi and Umezawa method. The\nfinal results in both formalisms are therefore equal, causal and covariant.\nFormal incorporation of pair suppression in the baryon exchange sector is\nachieved using a method based on the Takahashi and Umezawa method. For the\nresulting tree level amplitudes, we have shown, to our knowledge for the first\ntime, that they are causal, covariant and n-independent. Moreover, the\namplitudes are just a factor 1/2 of the usual Feynman expressions. The\namplitudes contain only posititve energy initial and final states, although it\nshould be mentioned that negative energy is present inside an amplitude via the\nDelta propagator. The second part of this thesis deals with higher spin field\nquantization in the framework of Dirac's Constraint analysis. A full constraint\nanalysis and quantization procedure is presented for the free spin 1,3/2 and 2\ncase and for the situation where these fields are coupled to auxiliary fields.\nThe constructed propagators in the former case are shown to be non-covariant,\nas is well-known. Therefore, auxiliary fields coupled to gauge conditions of\nthe free case are introduced in the Lagrangian. Now, the resulting propagators\nare covariant.\n","Comment: 189 pages"]}]
