This surface polariton corresponds to a particular Regge pole of the\nelectric part (TM) of the S matrix of the sphere. From the associated Regge\ntrajectory we can construct semiclassically the spectrum of the complex\nfrequencies of the resonant surface polariton modes which can be considered as\nBreit-Wigner-type resonances. Furthermore, by taking into account the Stokes\nphenomenon, we derive an asymptotic expression for the position in the complex\nangular momentum plane of the surface polariton Regge pole.

The importance sampling is based,\neither on a guiding function or on an initial variational wave function. Here\nwe investigate the need of importance sampling in the case of Path Integral\nGround State (PIGS) Monte Carlo. PIGS is based on a discrete imaginary time\nevolution of an initial wave function with a non zero overlap with the ground\nstate, that gives rise to a discrete path which is sampled via a Metropolis\nlike algorithm. In principle the exact ground state is reached in the limit of\nan infinite imaginary time evolution, but actual computations are based on\nfinite time evolutions and the question is whether such computations give\nunbiased exact results. We have studied bulk liquid and solid 4He with PIGS by\nconsidering as initial wave function a constant, i.e. the ground state of an\nideal Bose gas. This implies that the evolution toward the ground state is\ndriven only by the imaginary time propagator, i.e. there is no importance\nsampling. For both the phases we obtain results converging to those obtained by\nconsidering the best available variational wave function (the Shadow wave\nfunction) as initial wave function. Moreover we obtain the same results even by\nconsidering wave functions with the wrong correlations, for instance a wave\nfunction of a strongly localized Einstein crystal for the liquid phase. This\nconvergence is true not only for diagonal properties such as the energy, the\nradial distribution function and the static structure factor, but also for\noff-diagonal ones, such as the one--body density matrix.

For residential construction, such failures are usually\nassociated with roofs, which see the largest aerodynamic loading. However,\ndetermining aerodynamic loads on different portions of North American houses is\ncomplicated by the lack of clear load paths and non-linear load sharing in wood\nframe roofs. This problem of fluid-structure interaction requires both wind\ntunnel testing and full-scale structural testing.\n  A series of wind tunnel tests have been performed on a house in a simulated\natmospheric boundary layer (ABL), with the resulting wind-induced pressures\napplied to the full-scale structure. The ABL was simulated for flow over open\ncountry terrain where both velocity and turbulence intensity profiles, as well\nas spectra, were matched with available full scale measurements for this type\nof terrain. The first set of measurements was 600 simultaneous surface pressure\nmeasurements over the entire house.\n  A key feature of the surface pressure field is the occurrence of large,\nhighly non-Gaussian, peak uplift (suctions) on the roof. In order to better\nunderstand which flow features cause this, PIV experiments were performed on\nthe wind tunnel model. These experiments were performed with time-resolved PIV\n(sampling rate of 500 Hz) for a duration of 30 seconds. From the fluid dynamics\nvideos (low- and high-resolution) generated from the PIV data it is clear that\nstrong circulation is generated at the windward edge of the roof.

The applications include chemical and metabolic systems, food webs as\nwell as social networks. Lately, it was found that many of these networks\ndisplay some common topological features, such as high clustering, small\naverage path length (small world networks) and a power-law degree distribution\n(scale free networks). The topological features of a network are commonly\nrelated to the network's functionality. However, the topology alone does not\naccount for the nature of the interactions in the network and their strength.\nHere we introduce a method for evaluating the correlations between pairs of\nnodes in the network. These correlations depend both on the topology and on the\nfunctionality of the network. A network with high connectivity displays strong\ncorrelations between its interacting nodes and thus features small-world\nfunctionality. We quantify the correlations between all pairs of nodes in the\nnetwork, and express them as matrix elements in the correlation matrix. From\nthis information one can plot the correlation function for the network and to\nextract the correlation length. The connectivity of a network is then defined\nas the ratio between this correlation length and the average path length of the\nnetwork. Using this method we distinguish between a topological small world and\na functional small world, where the latter is characterized by long range\ncorrelations and high connectivity.

To\noptimize discrimination performance of shower observables combinations we apply\nFisher's discriminant analysis and give statistical estimates of separation of\nthe obtained distributions on Fisher variables for proton and iron primaries.\nAt the final stage we apply Multiparametric Topological Analysis to these\ndistributions to extract composition from prepared mixtures with known\nfractions of showers from different primary particles. It is shown, that due to\nhigh sensitivity of water tanks to muons, combination of signal in them with\n$\\xmax$ looks especially promising for mass composition analysis, provided the\nenergy is determined from longitudinal shower profile.\n","Comment: Proceedings of the 31st ICRC, Lodz, Poland, 2009"]}]
