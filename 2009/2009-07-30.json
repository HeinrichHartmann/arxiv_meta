The high vapor pressure pushes the\ninterface downward and the low one pulls it upward. A set of equations\ndescribing the temporal evolution of the interface of the liquid-vapor layers\nis derived.

The rsa algorithm applicability derives from algorithm\nproperties like confidentiality, safe authentication, data safety and integrity\non the internet. Thus, this kind of networks can have a more easy utilization\nby practical accessing from short, medium, even long distance and from\ndifferent public places. Rsa encryption in the client side is relatively cheap,\nwhereas, the corresponding decryption in the server side is expensive because\nits private exponent is much larger. Thus ssl tls servers become swamped to\nperform public key decryption operations when the simultaneous requests\nincrease quickly .The batch rsa method is useful for such highly loaded web\nserver .In our proposed algorithm by reducing the response time and clients\ntolerable waiting time an improvement in performance of ssl tls servers can be\ndone. The proposed algorithm should provide the reasonable response time and\noptimizes server performance significantly. At Encryption side, to withstand\nmany attacks like brute force attack, subtle attack etc. we also adapted a\nparameter generation method, which sieve all the parameters strictly, and\nfilter out every insecure parameter.\n","Comment: 5 pages, International Journal of Computer Science and Information\n  Security, IJCSIS, Impact Factor 0.423"]}]

We analyze this problem considering a 2D Heisenberg\nmodel with ferromagnetic exchange interactions, dipolar interactions and\nperpendicular anisotropy, relevant e.g. in Fe/Cu(001) films. By extending a\nclassic result of Yafet & Gyorgy (YG) and using Monte Carlo simulations we\ncalculate the complete zero temperature phase diagram of the model. Through\nthis calculation we analyze the correlation between domain walls structure and\nstripe width variation, as the perpendicular anisotropy changes. In particular,\nwe found evidences that the recently detected canted state becomes the ground\nstate of the system close to the Spin Reorientation Transition (SRT) for any\nvalue of the exchange to dipolar couplings ratio. Far away of the SRT the\ncanted ground state is replaced by a saturated stripes state, in which\nin--plane magnetization components are only present inside the walls. We find\nthat the domain wall structure strongly depends on the perpendicular\nanisotropy: close to SRT it is well described by YG approximation, but a strong\ndeparture is observed in the large anisotropy limit.
