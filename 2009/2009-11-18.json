We propose a generalized notion of these\nvacua which reduces to the usual conformal vacuum in the conformally massless\nlimit. When considering the massless discrete series we find that no covariant\nfield obeys the canonical commutation relations. To further analyze this\nsingular case, we consider the massless limit of the complementary scalar\nfields we previously found.

In this paper, we firstly perform an\nanalysis of the underlying principles behind these models aimed at\nunderstanding their computational power. Secondly, we propose an approximate\nsecond order stochastic learning algorithm. The proposed algorithm dynamically\nadapts the learning rate throughout the training phase of the network without\nincurring excessively expensive computational effort. The algorithm operates in\nboth on-line and batch modes. Furthermore, the resulting learning scheme is\nrobust against the vanishing gradients problem. The advantages of the proposed\nalgorithm are demonstrated with a real-world application example.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 4 figures, Recurrent Networks session ICANN 2009"]}]

The evolution of the\ndroplet is described by relativistic hydrodynamics with an equation of state\nsuggested by lattice gauge results. The granular source evolution is obtained\nby superposing all of the evolutions of individual droplets. Pions are assumed\nto be emitted thermally from the droplets at the freeze-out configuration\ncharacterized by a freeze-out temperature $T_f$. We find that the average\nparticle emission time scales with the initial radius of the droplet. Pions\nwill be emitted earlier if the droplet radius is smaller. An earlier emission\ntime will lead to a smaller extracted HBT radius $R_{\\rm out}$, while the\nextracted HBT radius $R_{\\rm side}$ is determined by the scale of the\ndistribution of the droplet centers. However, a collective expansion of the\ndroplets can further decrease $R_{\\rm out}$.
