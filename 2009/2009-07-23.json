In this regime, we calculate the nonlinear conductance, the\nmagnetic susceptibility, the renormalized spin relaxation and dephasing rates,\nand the renormalized g-factor. All quantities are considered up to the first\nlogarithmic contributions at resonance. Up to a redefinition of the Kondo\ntemperature, we confirm previous results for the conductance and the magnetic\nsusceptibility in the isotropic case. In addition, we present a consistent\ncalculation of the line shape at the resonances, including the determination\nwhich rate cuts off the logarithmic divergence.

A necessary condition for the\nreduced Einstein equation to satisfy the vacuum equations is that the initial\ndata satisfy Einstein constraint equations. Hence the data $(h_{ab},K_{ab})$\ncannot serve as initial data for the reduced Einstein equations.\n  Previous results in the case of asymptotically flat spacetimes provide a\nsolution to the constraint equations in one type of Sobolev spaces, while\ninitial data for the evolution equations belong to a different type of Sobolev\nspaces. The goal of our work is to resolve this incompatibility and to show\nthat under the harmonic gauge the vacuum Einstein equations are well-posed in\none type of Sobolev spaces.\n","Comment: 33 pages"]}]

In accordance with earlier scaling\ntheory and stochastic dynamics simulations findings we have identified three\nregimes of extensional deformation: (i) a linear response regime characterized\nby a weakly elongated (ellipsoidal) shape of the globule at small deformations,\n(ii) a tadpole structure with a globular \"head\" coexisting with a stretched\n\"tail\" at intermediate ranges of deformations, and (iii) an uniformly stretched\nchain at strong extensions. The conformational transition from the tadpole to\nthe stretched chain is accompanied by an abrupt unfolding of the depleted\nglobular head and a corresponding jump-wise drop in the intrachain tension. The\nunfolding-refolding cycle demonstrates a hysteresis loop in the vicinity of the\ntransition point. These three regimes of deformation, as well as the\nfirst-order like transition between the tadpole and the stretched chain\nconformations, can be experimentally observable provided that the number of\nmonomer units in the chain is large and/or the solvent quality is sufficiently\npoor.
