Firstly, the flow is expansive: if two\npoints remain close for all times, possibly with time reparametrization, then\ntheir orbits coincide. Secondly, there exists a physical (or\nSinai-Ruelle-Bowen) measure supported on the attractor whose ergodic basin\ncovers a full Lebesgue (volume) measure subset of the topological basin of\nattraction. Moreover this measure has absolutely continuous conditional\nmeasures along the center-unstable direction, is a $u$-Gibbs state and an\nequilibrium state for the logarithm of the Jacobian of the time one map of the\nflow along the strong-unstable direction. This extends to the class of\nsingular-hyperbolic attractors the main elements of the ergodic theory of\nuniformly hyperbolic (or Axiom A) attractors for flows.\n","Comment: 55 pages, extra figures (now a total of 16), major rearrangement of\n  sections and corrected proofs, improved introduction"]}]

As an application we show the polynomial periodicity of Hodge numbers\nof congruence covers in any dimension, generalizing results of E. Hironaka and\nSakuma. We extend the structure theorem and polynomial periodicity to the\nsetting of cohomology of unitary local systems. In particular, we obtain a\ngeneralization of the polynomial periodicity of Betti numbers of unbranched\ncongruence covers due to Sarnak-Adams.
