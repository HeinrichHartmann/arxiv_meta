Roughly\nspeaking, it is the property that the total number of jobs in the network\nremains bounded as a function of time. One of the key questions related to the\nstability issue is how to determine the exact conditions under which a given\nqueueing network operating under a given scheduling policy remains stable.\nWhile there was much initial progress in addressing this question, most of the\nresults obtained were partial at best and so the complete characterization of\nstable queueing networks is still lacking. In this paper, we resolve this open\nproblem, albeit in a somewhat unexpected way. We show that characterizing\nstable queueing networks is an algorithmically undecidable problem for the case\nof nonpreemptive static buffer priority scheduling policies and deterministic\ninterarrival and service times. Thus, no constructive characterization of\nstable queueing networks operating under this class of policies is possible.\nThe result is established for queueing networks with finite and infinite buffer\nsizes and possibly zero service times, although we conjecture that it also\nholds in the case of models with only infinite buffers and nonzero service\ntimes.

The missing piece in the\nDBI action also manifests itself in the open string picture as a mismatch\nbetween the Coleman-Weinberg potential obtained from the effective field theory\nand the corresponding open string calculation.

We give an\nanalogous \"local to global convexity\" theorem when the inclusion map of X to\nR^n is replaced by a map from a topological space X to R^n that satisfies\ncertain local properties.\n  We say that a map from a topological space to R^n is convex if every two\npoints in the space can be connected by a path whose composition with the map\nis a weakly monotone parametrization of a straight line segment. Let X be a\nconnected Hausdorff topological space, let T be a convex subset of R^n, and let\nPsi: X \\to T be a continuous proper map. Suppose that every point in X is\ncontained in an open set U such that the map Psi|_U: U \\to Psi(U) is convex and\nopen. Then the map Psi: X \\to \\Psi(X) is convex and open. Consequently, its\nimage is convex and its level sets are connected.\n  Our motivation comes from the Condevaux-Dazord-Molino proof of the\nAtiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg convexity theorem in symplectic geometry.\n"]}]
