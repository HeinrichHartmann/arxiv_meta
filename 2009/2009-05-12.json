Assuming time-division duplex\n(TDD) based transmission for the PR, cognitive beamforming is then designed and\napplied at CR transceivers to restrict the interference to/from the PR during\nthe subsequent channel training and data transmission stages. In the channel\ntraining stage, the CR transmitter sends training signals to the CR receiver,\nwhich applies the linear-minimum-mean-square-error (LMMSE) based estimator to\nestimate the effective channel. Considering imperfect estimations in both\nlearning and training stages, we derive a lower bound on the ergodic capacity\nachievable for the CR in the data transmission stage. From this capacity lower\nbound, we observe a general learning/training/throughput tradeoff associated\nwith the proposed scheme, pertinent to transmit power allocation between\ntraining and transmission stages, as well as time allocation among learning,\ntraining, and transmission stages.

While increasing\nthe cell level is easy, reducing the level of a cell can be accomplished only\nby erasing an entire block. Since block erasures are highly undesirable, coding\nschemes - known as floating codes or flash codes - have been designed in order\nto maximize the number of times that information stored in a flash memory can\nbe written (and re-written) prior to incurring a block erasure. An (n,k,t)_q\nflash code C is a coding scheme for storing k information bits in n cells in\nsuch a way that any sequence of up to t writes (where a write is a transition 0\n-> 1 or 1 -> 0 in any one of the k bits) can be accommodated without a block\nerasure. The total number of available level transitions in n cells is n(q-1),\nand the write deficiency of C, defined as \\delta(C) = n(q-1) - t, is a measure\nof how close the code comes to perfectly utilizing all these transitions. For k\n> 6 and large n, the best previously known construction of flash codes achieves\na write deficiency of O(qk^2). On the other hand, the best known lower bound on\nwrite deficiency is \\Omega(qk). In this paper, we present a new construction of\nflash codes that approaches this lower bound to within a factor logarithmic in\nk. To this end, we first improve upon the so-called \"indexed\" flash codes, due\nto Jiang and Bruck, by eliminating the need for index cells in the Jiang-Bruck\nconstruction. Next, we further increase the number of writes by introducing a\nnew multi-stage (recursive) indexing scheme. We then show that the write\ndeficiency of the resulting flash codes is O(qk\\log k) if q \\geq \\log_2k, and\nat most O(k\\log^2 k) otherwise.\n"]}]
