Solids possess static shear moduli, while fluids do not. Complex\nfluids such as foams display an intermediate response to shear with nontrivial\nfrequency-dependent shear moduli. In this manuscript, we conduct coordinated\nexperiments and numerical simulations of model foams subjected to\nboundary-driven oscillatory, planar shear. Our studies are performed on bubble\nrafts (experiments) and the bubble model (simulations) in 2D. We focus on the\nlow-amplitude flow regime in which T1 bubble rearrangement events do not occur,\nyet the system transitions from solid- to liquid-like behavior as the driving\nfrequency is increased. In both simulations and experiments, we observe two\ndistinct flow regimes. At low frequencies $\\omega$, the velocity profile of the\nbubbles increases linearly with distance from the stationary wall, and there is\na nonzero total phase shift between the moving boundary and interior bubbles.\nIn this frequency regime, the total phase shift scales as a power-law $\\Delta\n\\sim \\omega^n$ with $n \\approx 3$. In contrast, for frequencies above a\ncrossover frequency $\\omega > \\omega_{p}$, the total phase shift $\\Delta$\nscales linearly with the driving frequency.
