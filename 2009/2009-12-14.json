The pattern of GnRH\nsecretion is mirrored into that of LH (luteinizing hormone) secretion, whose\nplasmatic level can be easily measured. We addressed the question of whether\nthere exists an endogenous circannual rhythm in a tropical sheep population\nthat exhibits clear seasonal ovarian activity when ewes are subjected to\ntemperate latitudes.

It is well known that\nencryption provides secure channels for communicating entities. However, due to\nlack of covertness on these channels, an eavesdropper can identify encrypted\nstreams through statistical tests and capture them for further cryptanalysis.\nIn this paper we propose a new form of steganography, on-line hiding of\ninformation on the output screens of the instrument. This method can be used\nfor announcing a secret message in public place. It can be extended to other\nmeans such as electronic advertising board around sports stadium, railway\nstation or airport. This method of steganography is very similar to image\nsteganography and video steganography. Private marking system using symmetric\nkey steganography technique and LSB technique is used here for hiding the\nsecret information.\n"]}]
