Specific heat and\nmagnetization were investigated in the temperature range 1.8--300 K with a\nmagnetic field up to 8 T. Specific heat, $C(T)$, shows a jump at the\nsuperconducting transition (with onset at $T\\approx 37.5$ K). Below 20 K, a\nSchottky-type anomaly becomes apparent in $C(T)$. This low-temperature anomaly\ncan be attributed to splitting of the ground term ${^8}S_{7/2}$ of paramagnetic\nGd$^{3+}$ ions by internal and external magnetic fields. It is found that\ncurves $C(T)$ taken for different values of magnetic field have the same\ncrossing point (at $T_{\\ast}\\approx 2.7$ K) for all samples studied. At the\nsame time, $C(H)$ curves taken for different temperatures have a crossing point\nat a characteristic field $H_{\\ast}\\approx 3.7$ T.

Contrary to folklore, the\ninterpretation question was not settled at this conference and no consensus was\nreached; instead, a range of sharply conflicting views were presented and\nextensively discussed. Today, there is no longer an established or dominant\ninterpretation of quantum theory, so it is important to re-evaluate the\nhistorical sources and keep the interpretation debate open. In this spirit, we\nprovide a complete English translation of the original proceedings (lectures\nand discussions), and give background essays on the three main interpretations\npresented: de Broglie's pilot-wave theory, Born and Heisenberg's quantum\nmechanics, and Schroedinger's wave mechanics. We provide an extensive analysis\nof the lectures and discussions that took place, in the light of current\ndebates about the meaning of quantum theory. The proceedings contain much\nunexpected material, including extensive discussions of de Broglie's pilot-wave\ntheory (which de Broglie presented for a many-body system), and a \"quantum\nmechanics\" apparently lacking in wave function collapse or fundamental time\nevolution. We hope that the book will contribute to the ongoing revival of\nresearch in quantum foundations, as well as stimulate a reconsideration of the\nhistorical development of quantum physics.
