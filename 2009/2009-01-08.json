The discussion on which is the dominant\neffect, thus on how to improve the stability of the oscillator, has been going\non for years without giving a clear answer. This article tackles the question\nby analyzing the phase noise spectrum of several commercial oscillators and\nlaboratory prototypes, and demonstrates that the fluctuation of the resonator\nnatural frequency is the dominant effect. The investigation method starts from\nreverse engineering the oscillator phase noise in order to show that if the\nLeeson effect was dominant, the resonator merit factor Q would be too low as\ncompared to the available technology.\n","Comment: 20 pages, list of symbols, 1 table, 6 figures, 43 references"]}]

All the\nknown methods make use of a mixer, used either as a saturated phase detector or\nas a linear synchronous detector. Unfortunately, AM noise is taken in through\nthe power-to-dc-offset conversion mechanism that results from the mixer\nasymmetry. The measurement of some mixers indicates that the unwanted\namplitude-to-voltage gain is of the order of 5-50 mV, which is 12-35 dB lower\nthan the phase-to-voltage gain of the mixer. In addition, the trick of setting\nthe mixer at a sweet point -- off the quadrature condition -- where the\nsensitivity to AM nulls, works only with microwave mixers. The HF-VHF mixers\nhave not this sweet point. Moreover, we prove that if the AM noise comes from\nthe oscillator under test, it can not be rejected by correlation. At least not\nwith the schemes currently used. An example shows that at some critical\nfrequencies the unwanted effect of AM noise is of the same order -- if not\ngreater -- than the phase noise. Thus, experimental mistakes are around the\ncorner.\n","Comment: 16 pages, list of symbols, 8 figures, 27 references"]}]
