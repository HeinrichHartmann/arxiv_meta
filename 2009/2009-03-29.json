As an effective low energy theory, the model is unitary. We show that\na relativistic mass m is dynamically generated and derive a gap equation for\nit. By incorporating a finite temperature we study some fundamental properties\nof the model, such as the specific heat and spin response, which clearly show\nnon-Fermi liquid properties. We find that various physical properties are\nsuppressed at temperatures T< T* where the cross-over scale is T* = m. As a\nsimplified, toy model of high Tc superconductivity, we thus identify the\npseudogap energy scale with the zero temperature relativistic mass m, and show\nthat this reproduces some qualitative aspects of the observed phenomenology of\nthe pseudogap. The effects of the pseudogap and finite temperature on the\nd-wave gap equation are analyzed. In this model, the pseudogap is a distinct\nphenomenon from superconductivity and in fact competes with it. Our analysis of\nTc suggests that the quantum critical point of our model, where the pseudogap\nvanishes, occurs inside the superconducting dome near optimal doping.
