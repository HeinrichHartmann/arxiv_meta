Central to these\nefforts is a drive to control the interaction strength between carriers\n(electrons and holes) and the embedded magnetic atoms. In this respect,\ncolloidal nanocrystal heterostructures provide great flexibility via\ngrowth-controlled `engineering' of electron and hole wavefunctions within\nindividual nanocrystals. Here we demonstrate a widely tunable magnetic sp-d\nexchange interaction between electron-hole excitations (excitons) and\nparamagnetic manganese ions using `inverted' core-shell nanocrystals composed\nof Mn-doped ZnSe cores overcoated with undoped shells of narrower-gap CdSe.\nMagnetic circular dichroism studies reveal giant Zeeman spin splittings of the\nband-edge exciton that, surprisingly, are tunable in both magnitude and sign.\nEffective exciton g-factors are controllably tuned from -200 to +30 solely by\nincreasing the CdSe shell thickness, demonstrating that strong quantum\nconfinement and wavefunction engineering in heterostructured nanocrystal\nmaterials can be utilized to manipulate carrier-Mn wavefunction overlap and the\nsp-d exchange parameters themselves.\n","Comment: To appear in Nature Materials; 18 pages, 4 figures + Supp. Info"]}]

In many cases the Euler characteristic,\nfundamental group and Stiefel-Whitney classes together form a complete system\nof invariants for the homotopy type of such manifolds, and the possible values\nof the invariants can be described explicitly. The strongest results are\ncharacterizations of manifolds which fibre homotopically over S^1 or an\naspherical surface (up to homotopy equivalence) and infrasolvmanifolds (up to\nhomeomorphism). As a consequence 2-knots whose groups are poly-Z are determined\nup to Gluck reconstruction and change of orientations by their groups alone.\nThis book arose out of two earlier books \"2-Knots and their Groups\" and \"The\nAlgebraic Characterization of Geometric 4-Manifolds\", published by Cambridge\nUniversity Press for the Australian Mathematical Society and for the London\nMathematical Society, respectively. About a quarter of the present text has\nbeen taken from these books, and I thank Cambridge University Press for their\npermission to use this material. The book has been revised in March 2007. For\ndetails see the end of the preface.\n","Comment: This is the revised version published by Geometry & Topology\n  Monographs in March 2007"]}]

We first construct special\nLagrangian submanifolds of the Ricci-flat Stenzel metric (of holonomy SU(n)) on\nthe cotangent bundle of S^n by looking at the conormal bundle of appropriate\nsubmanifolds of S^n. We find that the condition for the conormal bundle to be\nspecial Lagrangian is the same as that discovered by Harvey-Lawson for\nsubmanifolds in R^n in their pioneering paper. We also construct calibrated\nsubmanifolds in complete metrics with special holonomy G_2 and Spin(7)\ndiscovered by Bryant and Salamon on the total spaces of appropriate bundles\nover self-dual Einstein four manifolds. The submanifolds are constructed as\ncertain subbundles over immersed surfaces. We show that this construction\nrequires the surface to be minimal in the associative and Cayley cases, and to\nbe (properly oriented) real isotropic in the coassociative case. We also make\nsome remarks about using these constructions as a possible local model for the\nintersection of compact calibrated submanifolds in a compact manifold with\nspecial holonomy.\n","Comment: 20 pages; for Revised Version: Minor cosmetic changes, some\n  paragraphs rewritten for improved clarity"]}]
