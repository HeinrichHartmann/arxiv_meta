Moreover, the application of a given technique to a set of\ndata (either simulated or experimental) requires the tuning of one or more\nparameters that unavoidably is a subjective operation. Hence, a reliable\ncomparison is difficult. What is missing is a statistical analysis of the\nproperties of the proposed methodologies. This is the aim of the present paper.\nThe statistical properties of the detection techniques in the context of two\ndifferent criteria, i.e. the Neyman-Pearson criterion and the maximization of\nthe signal-to-noise ratio, are analyzed through an analytical approach. Various\nexamples, techniques and the conditions under which they work satisfactorily\nare shown together with their limits and implementation details. Exploiting\nsome a priori information, it is possible to develop simple algorithms with\nperformances similar to those of more sophisticated but complex techniques. In\nthis respect, a detection algorithm, useful in future ground-based experiments\nas, for example the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, is presented.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 4 figures, typos ad some minor points have been corrected"]}]

However, the standard PCA suffers from the fact that the principal\ncomponents (PCs) are usually linear combinations of all the original variables,\nand it is thus often difficult to interpret the PCs. To alleviate this\ndrawback, various sparse PCA approaches were proposed in literature [15, 6, 17,\n28, 8, 25, 18, 7, 16]. Despite success in achieving sparsity, some important\nproperties enjoyed by the standard PCA are lost in these methods such as\nuncorrelation of PCs and orthogonality of loading vectors. Also, the total\nexplained variance that they attempt to maximize can be too optimistic. In this\npaper we propose a new formulation for sparse PCA, aiming at finding sparse and\nnearly uncorrelated PCs with orthogonal loading vectors while explaining as\nmuch of the total variance as possible. We also develop a novel augmented\nLagrangian method for solving a class of nonsmooth constrained optimization\nproblems, which is well suited for our formulation of sparse PCA. We show that\nit converges to a feasible point, and moreover under some regularity\nassumptions, it converges to a stationary point. Additionally, we propose two\nnonmonotone gradient methods for solving the augmented Lagrangian subproblems,\nand establish their global and local convergence. Finally, we compare our\nsparse PCA approach with several existing methods on synthetic, random, and\nreal data, respectively. The computational results demonstrate that the sparse\nPCs produced by our approach substantially outperform those by other methods in\nterms of total explained variance, correlation of PCs, and orthogonality of\nloading vectors.\n","Comment: 42 pages"]}]

Simply put, DOS involves a process of joint channel probing\nand distributed scheduling for ad-hoc (peer-to-peer) communications. Since, in\npractice, link conditions are estimated with noisy observations, the\ntransmission rate has to be backed off from the estimated rate to avoid\ntransmission outages. Then, a natural question to ask is whether it is\nworthwhile for the link with successful contention to perform further channel\nprobing to mitigate estimation errors, at the cost of additional probing. Thus\nmotivated, this work investigates DOS with two-level channel probing by\noptimizing the tradeoff between the throughput gain from more accurate rate\nestimation and the resulting additional delay. Capitalizing on optimal stopping\ntheory with incomplete information, we show that the optimal scheduling policy\nis threshold-based and is characterized by either one or two thresholds,\ndepending on network settings. Necessary and sufficient conditions for both\ncases are rigorously established. In particular, our analysis reveals that\nperforming second-level channel probing is optimal when the first-level\nestimated channel condition falls in between the two thresholds. Numerical\nresults are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed DOS with\ntwo-level channel probing. We also extend our study to the case with limited\nfeedback, where the feedback from the receiver to its transmitter takes the\nform of (0,1,e).\n","Comment: Submitted to IEEE Trans. Networking"]}]

At the highest level, the effective energy is entirely\nlocal and contains information about the structure of each particle but no\ninformation about their spatial distribution.
