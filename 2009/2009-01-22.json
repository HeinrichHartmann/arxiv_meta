The basic principle behind this approach is called the\nflip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the\nlower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to\nthe positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems):\nspecifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the\nfundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic\ngeometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed\nforms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this\narticle, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that\nthese relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of\nthe preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical\npositivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive\nformulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural\nconstants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These\nturn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the\nKazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the\ncanonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum\ngroups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann\nhypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here,\nin conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs.\nNP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann\nhypothesis over finite fields and related problems.\n","Comment: 139 pages.

We\nfirst consider the possibility of cosmic observers existing at any random time\n(including the future) for constant $\\Lambda$, and take into account the\nsuppression of new structure formation as the universe approaches its eternal\nDeSitter (DS) geometry. Structures that collapse prior to the era of\n$\\Lambda$-domination will lose causal contact with our Hubble volume within a\nfinite (short) conformal time $\\tau_{\\ast}$. Any remnants within our Hubble\nvolume then suffer a cosmological heat death after the universe becomes DS. The\nprobability for finding observers by random measurements in the volume bound by\nthe DeSitter horizon is $P \\simeq 0$, and it is a simple consequence of the\ninformation loss problem for eternal DS spaces resulting from the finite and\nconstant value of its temperature $T_{DS} \\simeq \\Lambda^{-1/2}$ and entropy $S\n= 3/(G\\Lambda)$. By contrast, for geometries with $\\Lambda = 0$, structures can\ncondense and entropy production can continue without bounds at any epoch. The\nprobability of finding observers in $\\Lambda = 0$ geometries is thus\noverwhelming higher than in DS spaces. As a result, anthropic reasoning does\nnot explain the small but nonzero vacuum energy observed in our universe. We\nalso address the case where observers are considered only at a specially chosen\ntime -- like the present epoch -- but relax the allowed values of starting\ndensity fluctuations and hence the redshift of galaxy formation. In this latter\ncase, the bounds on a $\\Lambda$ can be millions of times larger than previous\nestimates -- and the observed value.

In this thesis, the problem of resolving turbulence\nis addressed by developing velocity space resolution diagnostics and an\nadaptive collisionality that allow for the confident simulation of velocity\nspace dynamics using the approximate minimal necessary dissipation. With regard\nto the wide range of scales, a new approach has been developed in which\nturbulence calculations from multiple gyrokinetic flux tube simulations are\ncoupled together using transport equations to obtain self-consistent,\nsteady-state background profiles and corresponding turbulent fluxes and\nheating. This approach is embodied in a new code, Trinity, which is capable of\nevolving equilibrium profiles for multiple species, including electromagnetic\neffects and realistic magnetic geometry, at a fraction of the cost of\nconventional global simulations. Furthermore, an advanced model physical\ncollision operator for gyrokinetics has been derived and implemented, allowing\nfor the study of collisional turbulent heating, which has not been extensively\nstudied.

The\nstar formation efficiency is large and increases monotonically to low masses,\nin disagreement with data. With outflows, the baryon fraction is increasingly\nsuppressed in halos to lower masses. A Milky Way-sized halo at z=0 has about\n60% of the cosmic fraction of baryons, so \"missing\" halo baryons have largely\nbeen evacuated, rather than existing in some hidden form. Large halos (>10^13\nMo) contain 85% of their cosmic share of baryons, which explains the mild\nmissing baryon problem seen in clusters. By comparing results at z=3 and z=0,\nwe show that most of the baryon removal occurs at early epochs in larger halos,\nwhile smaller halos lose baryons more recently. Star formation efficiency is\nmaximized in halos of ~10^13 Mo, dropping significantly to lower masses, which\nhelps reconcile the sub-L* slope of the observed stellar and halo mass\nfunctions. These trends are predominantly driven by differential wind\nrecycling, namely, that wind material takes longer to return to low-mass\ngalaxies than high-mass galaxies.

OFDM, on the\nother hand, is a spectrally efficient physical layer modulation technique for\nbroadband transmission. As a natural consequence of combining OFDM with\nmulti-hop relaying, the allocation of per-hop subcarrier power and per-hop\ntransmission time is crucial in optimizing the network performance. This paper\nis concerned with the end-to-end information outage in an OFDM based linear\nrelay network. Our goal is to find an optimal power and time adaptation policy\nto minimize the outage probability under a long-term total power constraint. We\nsolve the problem in two steps. First, for any given channel realization, we\nderive the minimum short-term power required to meet a target transmission\nrate. We show that it can be obtained through two nested bisection loops. To\nreduce computational complexity and signalling overhead, we also propose a\nsub-optimal algorithm. In the second step, we determine a power threshold to\ncontrol the transmission on-off so that the long-term total power constraint is\nsatisfied.

In the special cases that the input graph has a planted\nclique or biclique (i.e., a single large clique or biclique plus diversionary\nedges), our algorithm successfully provides an exact solution to the original\ninstance. For each problem, we provide two analyses of when our algorithm\nsucceeds. In the first analysis, the diversionary edges are placed by an\nadversary. In the second, they are placed at random.

Lee's work, we give a simple proof of the fact that every\ntautological relation gives rise to a universal relation (which was also proved\nby Y.-P. Lee modulo certain results announced by C. Teleman).\n  In particular, this implies that in any semi-simple Gromov-Witten theory\nwhere arbitrary correlators can be expressed in genus 0 correlators using only\ntautological relations, the formal and the geometric Gromov-Witten potentials\ncoincide.\n  As the most important application, we show that our results suffice to deduce\nthe statement of a 1991 Witten conjecture on r-spin structures from the results\nobtained by Givental for the corresponding formal Gromov-Witten potential.\n  The conjecture in question states that certain intersection numbers on the\nmoduli space of r-spin structures can be arranged into a power series that\nsatisfies the r-KdV (or r-th higher Gelfand-Dikii) hierarchy of partial\ndifferential equations.\n","Comment: 46 pages, 7 figures, A discussion of the analyticity of Gromov-Witten\n  potentials and a more careful description of Givental's group action added in\n  Section 5; minor changes elsewhere"]}]
