The observed upper bound on the relic abundance\nconstrains the moduli-matter and moduli-gravitino couplings since the DM is\nproduced non-thermally within this framework.

We address both\nquestions, by reducing two well-studied models of tile assembly to models of\ndistributed shared memory (DSM), in order to obtain results from the memory\nconsistency systems induced by tile assembly systems when simulated in the DSM\nsetting. The Abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) can be simulated by a DSM\nsystem that obeys causal consistency, and the locally deterministic tile\nassembly systems in the aTAM correspond exactly to the concurrent-write free\nprograms that simulate tile assembly in such a model. Thus, the detection of\nthe failure of local determinism (which had formerly been an open problem)\nreduces to the detection of data races in simulating programs. Further, the\nKinetic Tile Assembly Model can be simulated by a DSM system that obeys GWO, a\nmemory consistency condition defined by Steinke and Nutt. (To our knowledge,\nthis is the first natural example of a DSM system that obeys GWO, but no\nstronger consistency condition.) We combine these results with the observation\nthat self-assembly algorithms are local algorithms, and there exists a fast\nconversion of deterministic local algorithms into deterministic\nself-stabilizing algorithms. This provides an \"immediate\" generalization of a\ntheorem by Soloveichik et al. about the existence of tile assembly systems that\nsimultaneously perform two forms of self-stabilization: proofreading and\nself-healing.

The possible interplay between these two types of\nCP-violation is discussed. The type I see-saw model with three heavy\nright-handed Majorana neutrinos having hierarchical spectrum is considered. The\nanalysis shows that there exist regions in the leptogenesis parameter space\nwhere the relevant \"high energy\" phases have large CP-violating values, but the\npurely \"high energy\" contribution to the baryon asymmetry plays a\nsubdominant/suppressed role in the production of baryon asymmetry compatible\nwith the observations and one can have successful leptogenesis if the requisite\nCP-violation is provided by the Majorana phase(s) in the neutrino mixing\nmatrix.\n","Comment: Submitted to the proceedings of \"The 2009 Europhysics Conference on\n  High Energy Physics\", July 16 - 22, 2009, Krakow, Poland"]}]
