Several approaches have been developed to recover\nthe unknown sparse vectors from the given observations, including thresholding,\nsimultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP), and convex relaxation based on\na mixed matrix norm. Typically, worst-case analysis is carried out in order to\nanalyze conditions under which the algorithms are able to recover any jointly\nsparse set of vectors. However, such an approach is not able to provide\ninsights into why joint sparse recovery is superior to applying standard sparse\nreconstruction methods to each channel individually.

In this paper, our main focus is on analysis of\nconvex relaxation techniques. In particular, we focus on the mixed l_2,1\napproach to multichannel recovery. We show that under a very mild condition on\nthe sparsity and on the dictionary characteristics, measured for example by the\ncoherence, the probability of recovery failure decays exponentially in the\nnumber of channels. This demonstrates that most of the time, multichannel\nsparse recovery is indeed superior to single channel methods.

The origin of this\ndifficulty is that, near a corner formed by smooth parts of the piece-wise\nsmooth boundary, in addition to the solution of the inhomogeneous problem,\nthere is also an eigensolution. For obtuse corner angles this eigensolution (a)\nbecomes dominant and (b) has a singular radial derivative of velocity at the\ncorner. A method is developed that uses the knowledge about the eigensolution\nto remove multivaluedness and nonintegrability of the pressure. The method is\nfirst explained in the simple case of a Stokes flow in a corner region and then\ngeneralised for the full-scale unsteady Navier-Stokes flow in a domain with a\nfree surface.\n","Comment: Under consideration for publication in the Journal of Fluid\n  Mechanics.
