The classical systems are chaotic, and exhibit normal\ndiffusive behavior. In the quantum systems, we found different regimes,\ndepending on the strength of the coupling. For weak coupling, we found quantum\nlocalization similar to that exhibited by single kicked rotors. For strong\ncoupling, we found a quasi-diffusive growth of the width of the momentum\ndistribution, in which the apparent diffusion coefficient decreased as time\nincreased. The behavior in this regime can be described by the scaling theory\nof weak localization for two-dimensional disordered lattices. The weak and\nstrong coupling regimes are separated by a regime of complex intermediate\nbehavior. Thus we explain the apparent contradiction in the literature as being\ndue to qualitatively different regimes of behavior, which we call strong and\nweak quantum localization.\n","Comment: 9 Pages, 8 figures, 5 tables"]}]

Each agent has to choose among a dichotomic option (i.e. agree or\ndisagree) with respect to a given matter and he is driven by external\ninfluences (as media) and peer to peer interactions. These mimic the imitative\nbehavior of the collectivity and may possibly be zero if the two nodes are\ndisconnected. For this scenario we work out both the dynamics and the\ncorresponding equilibria (statics). Once the 2-body theory is completely\nexplored, we analyze, on the same random graph, a \"diffusive strategic\ndynamics\" with pairwise interactions, where detailed balance constraint is\nrelaxed. The dynamic encodes some relevant processes which are expected to play\na crucial role in the approach to equilibrium in social systems, i.e. diffusion\nof information and strategic choices. We observe numerically that such a\ndynamics reaches a well defined steady state that fulfills a \"shift property\":\nthe critical interaction strength for the phase transition is lower with\nrespect to the one expected from canonical equilibrium.\n  Finally, we show how the stationary states obtained with this dynamics can be\ndescribed by statistical mechanics equilibria of a diluted p-spin model, for a\nsuitable non-integer real p>2.

In case of K-user IC with single\npolarization, the maximum achievable MUXG is K regardless of the number of\ntransmit and receive antennas because of the key-hole effect. With\npolarization, a trivial upper bound on the MUXG is 2K. We propose a zero\nforcing (ZF) scheme for the K-user LOS IC, where each user uses one or more\npolarimetric antennas. By using the proposed ZF scheme, we find minimal antenna\nconfigurations that achieve this bound for K <= 5. For K > 5, we show that the\noptimal MUXG of 2K is achieved with M = (K+1)/6 polarimetric antennas at each\nuser.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 5 figures, to appear in Proc.

Sometimes they evolve by adding new\nfeatures, and sometimes by either fixing bugs or replacing outdated\nimplementations with new ones. When software engineers fail to anticipate such\nevolution during development, they will eventually be forced to re-architect or\nre-build from scratch. Therefore, it has been common practice to prepare for\nchanges so that software products are extensible over their lifetimes. However,\nmaking software extensible is challenging because it is difficult to anticipate\nsuccessive changes and to provide adequate abstraction mechanisms over\npotential changes. Such extensibility mechanisms, furthermore, should not\ncompromise any existing functionality during extension. Software engineers\nwould benefit from a tool that provides a way to add extensions in a reliable\nway. It is natural to expect programming languages to serve this role.\nExtensible programming is one effort to address these issues.\n  In this thesis, we present type safe extensible programming using the MLPolyR\nlanguage. MLPolyR is an ML-like functional language whose type system provides\ntype-safe extensibility mechanisms at several levels. After presenting the\nlanguage, we will show how these extensibility mechanisms can be put to good\nuse in the context of product line engineering.

In such\na picture, quasars, the highest luminosity AGNs, are expected to be located in\nregions with a higher density of galaxies on small scales where mergers are\nmore likely to take place. However, in this picture, the activity observed in\nlow-luminosity AGNs is due to secular processes that are less dependent on the\nlocal galaxy density. To test this hypothesis, we compare the local photometric\ngalaxy density on kiloparsec scales around spectroscopic type I and type II\nquasars to the local density around lower-luminosity spectroscopic type I and\ntype II AGNs. To minimize projection effects and evolution in the photometric\ngalaxy sample we use to characterize AGN environments, we place our random\ncontrol sample at the same redshift as our AGNs and impose a narrow redshift\nwindow around both the AGNs and control targets.
