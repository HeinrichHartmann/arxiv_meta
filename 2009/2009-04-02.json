The most common formulation of\nstochastic models for biochemical networks is the chemical master equation\n(CME). While stochastic simulations are a practical way to realise the CME,\nanalytical approximations offer more insight into the influence of noise.\nTowards that end, the two-moment approximation (2MA) is a promising addition to\nthe established analytical approaches including the chemical Langevin equation\n(CLE) and the related linear noise approximation (LNA).

These sources properly account for the dimuons produced in\nproton-nucleus collisions. In this paper, we show that dimuons are also\nproduced in excess in 158 A GeV In-In collisions. We furthermore observe, by\ntagging the dimuon vertices, that this excess is not due to enhanced D meson\nproduction, but made of prompt muon pairs, as expected from a source of thermal\ndimuons specific to high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. The yield of this\nexcess increases significantly from peripheral to central collisions, both with\nrespect to the Drell-Yan yield and to the number of nucleons participating in\nthe collisions. Furthermore, the transverse mass distributions of the excess\ndimuons are well described by an exponential function, with inverse slope\nvalues around 190 MeV. The values are independent of mass and significantly\nlower than those found at masses below 1 GeV/c^2, rising there up to 250 MeV\ndue to radial flow.

It is shown that the\ncontribution to the conductivity from degenerate states in a low or zero\nfrequency external electric field and the contribution from states near\nresonance with a finite frequency external field are finite. The improved\nconductivity expression does not include the familiar \"energy conserving\" delta\nfunction, and no artificial broadening parameter for delta function is required\nfor the DC limit.

Let L_G be the graded abelian group\ndefined by (L_G)_p = oplus_{[g]}H_{p+n}(C_g) where the sum is taken over\nconjugacy classes of elements in G. In this paper we construct a multiplication\non L_G directly in terms of intersection products on the centralizers. This\nmultiplication makes L_G a graded, associative, commutative algebra. When G is\nthe fundamental group of an aspherical, closed oriented n manifold M, then\n(L_G)_* = H_{*+n}(LM), where LM is the free loop space of M. We show that the\nproduct on L_G corresponds to the string topology loop product on H_*(LM)\ndefined by Chas and Sullivan.\n","Comment: This is the version published by Geometry & Topology Monographs on 22\n  February 2008"]}]

As it turns out, especially the tails of the\ndistributions are not well described by the Poissonian or binomial model\nresulting from the assumption of uncorrelated random events. Instead, a good\neffective description of the data is provided by less basic distributions such\nas the negative binomial one or the probability densities of extreme value\nstatistics.
