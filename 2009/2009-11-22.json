At the\nhigh excitation densities and low temperatures of the reported experiments the\nmain spin-flip mechanism of the conduction band electrons is the\nBir-Aronov-Pikus. By means of Monte-Carlo simulations we evidence that\nphase-space filling effects result in the blocking of the spin flip, yielding\nan increase of t_sf with excitation density. These effects obtain values of\nt_sf up to 30 ns at k=0, the longest reported spin-relaxation time in undoped\nGaAs in the absence of a magnetic field.\n","Comment: new author added, major changes in section IV (phenomenological\n  model), minor changes throughout the entire manuscript"]}]

Using both Dirac vector bracket notation\n(VBN) and PBN, we define induced Hilbert space and induced sample space, and\npropose that there exists an equivalence relation between a Hilbert space and a\nsample space constructed from the same base observable(s). Then we investigate\nMarkov transition matrices and their eigenvectors to make diffusion maps with\ntwo examples: a simple graph theory example, to serve as a prototype of\nbidirectional transition operator; a famous text document example in IR\nliterature, to serve as a tutorial of diffusion map in text document space. We\nshow that the sample space of the Markov chain and the Hilbert space spanned by\nthe eigenvectors of the transition matrix are not equivalent. At the end, we\napply our PBN and equivalence proposal to Thermophysics by associating sample\n(phase) space with the Hilbert space of a single particle and the Fock space of\nmany-particle systems.\n","Comment: 25 pages"]}]
