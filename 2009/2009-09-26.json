Selection by individuals' fitness, usually the basic\ndriving force of evolution, quickly eliminates cooperators. However, evolution\nis also governed by fluctuations that can be of greater importance than fitness\ndifferences, and can render evolution effectively neutral. Here, we investigate\nthe effects of selection versus fluctuations in social dilemmas. By studying\nthe mean extinction times of cooperators and defectors, a variable sensitive to\nfluctuations, we are able to identify and quantify an emerging 'edge of neutral\nevolution' that delineates regimes of neutral and Darwinian evolution. Our\nresults reveal that cooperation is significantly maintained in the neutral\nregimes. In contrast, the classical predictions of evolutionary game theory,\nwhere defectors beat cooperators, are recovered in the Darwinian regimes. Our\nstudies demonstrate that fluctuations can provide a surprisingly simple way to\npartly resolve social dilemmas.

Many efforts have been made to understand the physics of\ntheir luminous infrared emission and evolutionary stages. However, a large\nULIRG sample is still needed to study the properties of their central black\nholes (BHs), the BH-host galaxy relation, and their evolution. We identified\n308 ULIRGs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6, and classified\nthem into the NL ULIRGs (with only narrow emission lines) and the Type I ULIRGs\n(with broad emission lines). About 56% of ULIRGs in our total sample show\ninteraction features, and this percentage is 79% for redshift z < 0.2. Optical\nidentifications of these ULIRGs show that the AGN percentage is at least 49%,\nand the percentage increases with the infrared luminosity. We found 62 Type I\nULIRGs, and estimated their BH masses and velocity dispersions from their\noptical spectra. Together with known Type I ULIRGs in the literature, a sample\nof 90 Type I ULIRGs enables us to make a statistical study. We found that the\nBH masses of Type I ULIRGs are typically smaller than those of PG QSOs, and\nmost Type I ULIRGs follow the M_{BH}-sigma relation. However, some ULIRGs with\nlarger Eddington ratio deviate from this relation, even the line width of the\n[OIII] narrow line (NL) core or the [SII] line was used as the surrogate of\nvelocity dispersion. This implies that at least some ULIRGs are probably still\nin the early evolution stage toward QSOs. The anti-correlation between the mass\ndeviation from the M_{BH}-sigma relation and the Eddington ratio supports that\nthe evolution of Type I ULIRGs is probably followed by the building up of the\nM_{BH}-sigma relation and the evolution to the QSO phase.\n","Comment: 46 pages, 15 figures, 2 tables; published by ApJ"]}]
