We focus our attention onto the confining regime, considering the\ninterquark potential and force, and the electric field induced by two\ninfinitely heavy sources. We consider both the zero and finite temperature\nsetting, and compare the theoretical predictions derived from the effective\nstring model and the dual superconductor scenario to the numerical results.\n","Comment: 31 pages, 16 eps figures; v2: references added; v3: footnote added,\n  summation ranges in section 4 made explicit, version published in JHEP"]}]
