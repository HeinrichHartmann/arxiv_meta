In particular, we assume agents optimize a linear\ncombination of personal delay of a strategy and the resulting increase in\nsocial cost. Our model can be embedded in the framework of congestion games\nwith player-specific latency functions. Stable states are the Nash equilibria\nof these games, and we examine their existence and the convergence of\nsequential best-response dynamics. Previous work shows that for symmetric\nsingleton games with convex delays Nash equilibria are guaranteed to exist. For\nconcave delay functions we observe that there are games without Nash equilibria\nand provide a polynomial time algorithm to decide existence for symmetric\nsingleton games with arbitrary delay functions. Our algorithm can be extended\nto compute best and worst Nash equilibria if they exist. For more general\ncongestion games existence becomes NP-hard to decide, even for symmetric\nnetwork games with quadratic delay functions. Perhaps surprisingly, if all\ndelay functions are linear, then there is always a Nash equilibrium in any\ncongestion game with altruists and any better-response dynamics converges. In\naddition to these results for uncoordinated dynamics, we consider a scenario in\nwhich a central altruistic institution can motivate agents to act\naltruistically.

Sink equilibria\nhas been introduced by Goemans, Mirrokni, and Vetta for studying social cost on\nNash dynamics over pure strategies in games. However, they do not address the\ncomplexity of sink equilibria in these games. Recently, Fabrikant and\nPapadimitriou initiated the study of the complexity of Nash dynamics in two\nclasses of games. In order to completely understand the complexity of Nash\ndynamics in a variety of games, we study the following three questions for\nvarious games: (i) given a state in game, can we verify if this state is in a\nsink equilibrium or not? (ii) given an instance of a game, can we verify if\nthere exists any sink equilibrium other than pure Nash equilibria? and (iii)\ngiven an instance of a game, can we verify if there exists a pure Nash\nequilibrium (i.e, a sink equilibrium with one state)?\n  In this paper, we almost answer all of the above questions for a variety of\nclasses of games with succinct representation, including anonymous games,\nplayer-specific and weighted congestion games, valid-utility games, and\ntwo-sided market games. In particular, for most of these problems, we show that\n(i) it is PSPACE-complete to verify if a given state is in a sink equilibrium,\n(ii) it is NP-hard to verify if there exists a pure Nash equilibrium in the\ngame or not, (iii) it is PSPACE-complete to verify if there exists any sink\nequilibrium other than pure Nash equilibria.
