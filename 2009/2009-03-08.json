Such binaries form after major galaxy\nmergers, but their fate is unclear since hardening through stellar scattering\nbecomes very inefficient at sub-parsec distances. Gas discs may dominate binary\ndynamics on these scales, and promote mergers. Using numerical simulations, we\ninvestigate the evolution of the orbits of binaries embedded within\ngeometrically thin gas discs. Our simulations directly resolve angular momentum\ntransport within the disc, which at the radii of interest is likely dominated\nby disc self-gravity. We show that the binary decays at a rate which is in good\nagreement with analytical estimates, while the eccentricity grows. Saturation\nof eccentricity growth is not observed up to values e > 0.35. Accretion onto\nthe black holes is variable, and is roughly modulated by the binary orbital\nfrequency. Scaling our results, we analytically estimate the maximum rate of\nbinary decay that is possible without fragmentation occuring within the\nsurrounding gas disc, and compare that rate to an estimate of the stellar\ndynamical hardening rate. For binary masses in the range 10^5 < M/Msun < 10^8\nwe find that decay due to gas discs may dominate for separations below a ~\n0.01--0.1 pc, where the disc is optically thick. The minimum merger time scale\nis shorter than the Hubble time for M < 10^7 Msun. This implies that gas discs\ncould commonly attend relatively low mass black hole mergers, and that a\nsignificant population of binaries might exist at separations of a few\nhundredths of a pc, where the combined decay rate is slowest.

In these systems,\npropagation failure may occur if either the coupling between nodes is not\nstrong enough or the recovery is too fast.

There are two general methods to construct\nrepresentations of $G$, namely, ordinary parabolic induction and cohomological\nparabolic induction. We define Eisenstein integrals relative to cohomological\ninductions which generalize Flensted-Jensen's fundamental functions for\ndiscrete series. They are analogous to Harish-Chandra's Eisenstein integrals\nrelated to ordinary inductions. We introduce the notion of Li positivity of a\n$K$ type in a representation of $G$ which is extremely useful in the study of\nbranching laws. As an application of our integral, we show that the minimal $K$\ntypes of many interesting representations are Li positive. These include all\nirreducible unitary representations with nonzero cohomology.\n","Comment: 53 pages, submitted to Invent. Math"]}]
