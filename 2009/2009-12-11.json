This grid of models covers most of\nthe expected combinations of stellar parameters, which are made up of the\nstellar temperature, the stellar luminosity, the stellar mass, the abundance of\ncondensible carbon, and the velocity amplitude of the pulsation. The resultant\nmass-loss rates and wind speeds are clearly affected by the choice of stellar\ntemperature, mass, luminosity and the abundance of available carbon. In certain\nparts of the parameter space there is also an inevitable mass-loss threshold,\nbelow which a dust-driven wind is not possible. Contrary to some previous\nstudies, we find a strong dependence on the abundance of free carbon, which\nturns out to be a critical parameter. Furthermore, we have found that the dust\ngrains that form in the atmosphere may grow too large for the commonly used\nsmall particle approximation of the dust opacity to be strictly valid. This may\nhave some bearing on the wind properties, although further study of this\nproblem is needed before quantitative conclusions can be drawn. The wind\nproperties show relatively simple dependences on stellar parameters above the\nmass-loss threshold, while the threshold itself is of a more complicated\nnature. Hence, we chose not to derive any simplistic mass-loss formula, but\nrather provide a mass-loss prescription in the form of an easy-to-use FORTRAN\nroutine. Since this mass-loss routine is based on data coming from an\nessentially self-consistent model of mass loss, it may therefore serve as a\nbetter mass-loss prescription for stellar evolution calculations than empirical\nformulae.

This works as long as the amplitude of modulation of the orbital period\nis greater than its uncertainty, which in practice means that the system should\nnot be too close to exact resonance. Here we provide simple expressions for the\nlibration period and the change in the observed orbital period, these being\nvalid for arbitrary eccentricities and planet masses.
