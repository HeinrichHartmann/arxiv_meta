This limits the cutoff scale in the linear\nmatter power spectrum to k < 35/kpc which can be explained by e.g., warm dark\nmatter. Very near future Fermi observations will strongly constrain the minimum\nmass to be > 10^3 M_sun: if the true substructure cutoff is much smaller than\nthis, the DM interpretation of the Fermi/PAMELA/HESS data must be wrong.

The observed maximum\nspeed distribution is peaked at ~10c, with a tail that extends out to ~50c.\nThis requires a distribution of intrinsic Lorentz factors in the parent\npopulation that range up to ~50.

Accelerations are measured from the apparent motion of individual\njet features or \"components\" which may represent patterns in the jet flow. We\nfind that significant accelerations are common both parallel and perpendicular\nto the observed component velocities. Parallel accelerations, representing\nchanges in apparent speed, are generally larger than perpendicular acceleration\nthat represent changes in apparent direction. The trend for larger parallel\naccelerations indicates that a significant fraction of these changes in\napparent speed are due to changes in intrinsic speed of the component rather\nthan changes in direction to the line of sight. We find an overall tendency for\ncomponents with increasing apparent speed to be closer to the base of their\njets than components with decreasing apparent speed. This suggests a link\nbetween the observed pattern motions and the underlying flow which, in some\ncases, may increase in speed close to the base and decrease in speed further\nout; however, common hydro-dynamical processes for propagating shocks may also\nplay a role. About half of the components show \"non-radial\" motion, or a\nmisalignment between the component's structural position angle and its velocity\ndirection, and these misalignments generally better align the component motion\nwith the downstream emission.

A combination of process\nsimulation, electrostatic simulation, and computer assisted design (CAD)\nlay-out packages are used to develop a three dimensional (3D) classical\ncapacitance model. The agreement of the capacitances of the classical model is\ntested against two different, experimentally measured, topographically complex\nsilicon QD geometries. Agreement with experiment, within 10-20%, is\ndemonstrated for the two structures when the details of the structure are\ntransferred from the CAD to the model capturing the full 3D topography. Small\nuncertainty in device dimensions due to uncontrolled variation in processing,\nlike layer thickness and gate size, are calculated to be sufficient to explain\nthe disagreement. The sensitivity of the capacitances to small variations in\nthe structure also highlights the limits of accuracy of capacitance models for\nQD analysis. We furthermore observe that a critical density, the metal\ninsulator transition, can be used as a good approximation of the metallic edge\nof the quantum dot when electron density in the dot is calculated directly with\na semi-classical simulation.\n"]}]

To answer\nthe question, we will extend our theory of experimental oracles in order to use\nTuring machines to model the experimental procedures that govern the conduct of\nphysical experiments. First, we specify an experiment that measures mass via\ncollisions in Newtonian Dynamics; we examine its properties in preparation for\nits use as an oracle. We start to classify the computational power of\npolynomial time Turing machines with this experimental oracle using non-uniform\ncomplexity classes. Second, we show that modelling an experimenter and\nexperimental procedure algorithmically imposes a limit on what can be measured\nwith equipment.
