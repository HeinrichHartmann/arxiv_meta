In\nparticular, the lift coefficient was assumed to be 1/2, independent of the\nbubble Reynolds number and the local flow field.

In the long term, the property\nof local energy transfer, characteristic of real turbulence, is lost and the\ninput of energy equals the viscous dissipation at all scales. Due to the lack\nof strong vortices the bubbles spread rather uniformly in the flow. The\nmechanism for uniform spreading is as follows: Rising bubbles induce a velocity\nfield behind them that acts on the following bubbles. Owing to the shear, those\nbubbles experience a lift force which make them spread to the left or right,\nthus preventing the formation of vertical bubble clusters and therefore of\nefficient forcing. Indeed, when the lift is artifically put to zero in the\nsimulations, the flow is forced much more efficiently and a more pronounced\nenergy accumulates at large scales is achieved.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 7 figures"]}]

Namely, we reduce such problems to classification (up to homotopy) of\nmaps from BG to classifiying spaces of certain higher groupoids. In particular,\nto every fusion category C we attach the 3-groupoid BrPic(C) of invertible\nC-bimodule categories, called the Brauer-Picard groupoid of C, such that\nequivalence classes of G-extensions of C are in bijection with homotopy classes\nof maps from BG to the classifying space of BrPic(C). This gives rise to an\nexplicit description of both the obstructions to existence of extensions and\nthe data parametrizing them; we work these out both topologically and\nalgebraically.\n  One of the central results of the paper is that the 2-truncation of BrPic(C)\nis canonically the 2-groupoid of braided autoequivalences of the Drinfeld\ncenter Z(C) of C. In particular, this implies that the Brauer-Picard group\nBrPic(C) (i.e., the group of equivalence classes of invertible C-bimodule\ncategories) is naturally isomorphic to the group of braided autoequivalences of\nZ(C). Thus, if C=Vec(A), where A is a finite abelian group, then BrPic(C) is\nthe orthogonal group O(A+A^*). This allows one to obtain a rather explicit\nclassification of extensions in this case; in particular, in the case G=Z/2, we\nrederive (without computations) the classical result of Tambara and Yamagami.\nMoreover, we explicitly describe the category of all (Vec(A1),Vec(A2))-bimodule\ncategories (not necessarily invertible ones) by showing that it is equivalent\nto the hyperbolic part of the category of Lagrangian correspondences.\n","Comment: 70 pages, latex; in the new version, a new Appendix written by Ehud\n  Meir has been added"]}]

It is seen that density of states\nare in general multi-modal, $F_k(E)$'s exhibit variations as function of the\nbasis states energy and $\\xi_2(E)$'s show structures arising from localized\nstates. The sources of these departures from EGOE(1+2) are investigated by\nexamining the partial densities, correlations between $F_k(E)$, $\\xi_2(E)$ and\n$\\lan n_\\alpha \\ran^E$ and also by studying the structure of the Hamiltonian\nmatrices. These studies point out the operation of EGOE(1+2) but at the same\ntime suggest that weak admixing between well separated configurations should be\nincorporated into EGOE(1+2) for more quantitative description of chaos and\nlocalization in NdI, PmI and SmI.\n","Comment: There are 9 figures"]}]
