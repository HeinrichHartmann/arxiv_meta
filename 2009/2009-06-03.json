Graham and D. Vogan proposed a\nmethod of constructing representations from the coadjoint orbits for a complex\nsemisimple Lie group $G$. When the coadjoint orbit $\\calO$ is nilpotent, a\nrepresentation of $G$ is attached to each orbital variety of $\\calO$ in this\nway. In the setting of classical groups, we show that whenever it is possible\nto carry out the Graham-Vogan construction for an orbital variety of a\nspherical $\\mathcal{O}$, its infinitesimal character lies in a set of\ncharacters attached to $\\mathcal{O}$ by W. M. McGovern. Furthermore, we show\nthat it is possible to carry out the Graham-Vogan construction for a sufficient\nnumber of orbital varieties to account for all the infinitesimal characters in\nthis set.\n","Comment: 35 pages"]}]
