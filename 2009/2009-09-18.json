One is a conflict at an exit when\npedestrians evacuate from a room. We use floor field model for simulating such\nbehavior, which is a well-studied pedestrian model using cellular automata. The\nconflicts have been taken into account by the friction parameter. However, the\nfriction parameter so far is a constant and does not depend on the number of\nthe pedestrians conflicting at the same time. Thus, we have improved the\nfriction parameter by the frictional function, which is a function of the\nnumber of the pedestrians involved in the conflict. Second, we have newly\nintroduced the cost of turning of pedestrians at the exit. Since pedestrians\nhave inertia, their walking speeds decrease when they turn, and the pedestrian\noutflow decreases.\n  The validity of the extended model, which includes the frictional function\nand the turning function, is verified by both a mean field theory and\nexperiments. In our experiments, the pedestrian flow increases when we put an\nobstacle in front of an exit. The analytical results clearly explains the\nmechanism of the effect of the obstacle, i.e., the obstacle blocks pedestrians\nmoving to the exit and decreases the average number of pedestrians involved in\nthe conflict.

It is shown that a large number\nof nuclides exhibit the phenomenon of shape-coexistence over a significant\nregion of the superheavy elements. Shape coexistence of a prolate and an oblate\nshape is prevalent in nuclides far below N=184, whilst nuclei in the vicinity\nof N=184 tend to show a shape coexistence between a spherical and an oblate\nshape. The shell structure and 2-neutron separation energies obtained with the\nRMF theory reinforce the neutron number N=184 as a major magic number. It is\nshown that the neutron number N=172 acts akin to a magic number in the deformed\nregion. It is suggested that the combination Z=120 and N=172 has the potential\nof being a doubly magic number in the superheavy region.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 17 figures; Bibliography and citations corrected; To appear\n  in J.
