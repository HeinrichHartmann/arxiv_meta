A weakened form of this conjecture states that for every\n$k\\geq1$, there exist infinitely many primes $p$ and $q$ such that $p-q=2k$.\nClearly, the weakened form of Polignac's conjecture implies that there exists\nan infinite sequence of positive integers $x_1,x_2,...,x_m,...$ such that $x_1\n(2k+x_1),x_2 (2k+x_2),...,x_m (2k+x_m)...$ are pairwise relatively prime. In\nthis note, we obtain a slightly stronger result than this necessary condition.\nThis enables us to find a common property on some special kinds of\nnumber-theoretic functions (such as $2^x -1 $) which likely represent\ninfinitely many primes by rich literatures and a lot of research reports.\nHowever, the function $2^{2^x}+1$ does not have this property. Does it imply\nthat the number of Fermat primes is finite? Hardy and Wright [7] conjectured\nthat the number of Fermat primes is finite. Nevertheless, they did not give any\nreasons and explanations. By factoring Fermat number, many people believe that\nthe conjecture in [7] holds. Does our work explain this phenomenon? We will\nconsider further this problem in another paper. Based on our work, one could\ngive a new sufficient condition that there are an infinite number of twin\nprimes (Sophie-Germain primes or Mersenne primes).\n","Comment: 17 pages; Give a simple proof of theorem 1, see Appendix C"]}]

These approximate\nmaximizers work simultaneously for all intricacies. We also establish some\nproperties of arbitrary approximate maximizers, in particular the existence of\na threshold in the size of subsystems of approximate maximizers: most smaller\nsubsystems are almost equidistributed, most larger subsystems determine the\nfull system.\n  The main ideas are a random construction of almost maximizers with a high\nstatistical symmetry and the consideration of entropy profiles, i.e., the\naverage entropies of sub-systems of a given size.
