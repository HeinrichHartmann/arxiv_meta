Using realistic photometric\nredshift simulations and an artificial neural network photo-z method we\nevaluate the Figure of Merit for the Dark Energy parameters $(w_0, w_a)$. We\nconsider a DUNE-like broad optical filter supplemented with ground-based\nmulti-band optical data from surveys like the Dark Energy Survey, Pan-STARRS\nand LSST. We show that the Dark Energy Figure of Merit would improved by a\nfactor of 1.3 to 1.7 if IR filters are added on board DUNE. Furthermore we show\nthat with IR data catastrophic photo-z outliers can be removed effectively.\nThere is an interplay between the choice of filters, the magnitude limits and\nthe removal of outliers. We draw attention to the dependence of the results on\nthe galaxy formation scenarios encoded into the mock galaxies, e.g the galaxy\nreddening.

We\nconsider briefly a range of phenomena, but concentrate at the extremes of high\nand low gas flow rate, which might represent the more likely behaviors.\nExtremely fast i.e., explosive, expulsion of gas from the surface is\ninvestigated by examining the minimal amount of gas needed to displace a plug\nof regolith above a site of gaseous overpressure at the regolith's base. The\narea and timescale of this disturbance, it is consistent with observed TLPs.\nFurthermore there are several ways in which such an explosion might be expected\nto change the lunar surface appearance in a way consistent with many TLPs,\nincluding production of obscuration, brightening and color changes. At the slow\nend of the volatile flow range, gas seeping from the interior is retained below\nthe surface for extensive times due to the low diffusivity of regolith\nmaterial. A special circumstance arises if the volatile flow contains water\nvapor, because water is uniquely capable of freezing as it passes from the base\nto the surface of the regolith. For a large TLP site, it is plausible to think\nof areas on the square-km scale accumulating significant bodies of water ice.\nFurthermore, as the system evolves over geological time, the ice accumulation\nzone will evolve downwards into the regolith. Since many reactions possible\nbetween the volatiles and regolith, depending on the additional gases besides\nwater, can act to decrease diffusivity in the regolith, it is plausible that\nthe volatiles produce a barrier between the seepage source and vacuum, forcing\nthe ice zone to expand to larger areas.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 2 figures, submitted to ApJ.

We propose to use the fraction of\nLy-alpha emitters (LAEs) in long GRB host galaxies as a function of UV\nluminosity, which can be compared with star-formation-rate weighted LAE\nfraction of Lyman-break galaxies as the standard in the case of no metallicity\ndependence. There are two important effects of metallicity dependence of long\nGRB rate to change the LAE fraction of host galaxies. One is the enhancement of\nintrinsic Ly-alpha equivalent width (EW) by stronger ionizing UV luminosity of\nlow metallicity stellar population, and the other is extinction by interstellar\ndust to change the observable EW. Based on a latest theoretical model of LAEs\nthat reproduce observations, we argue that the latter is likely to work in the\nopposite direction to the former, i.e., to decrease LAE fraction if GRBs\npreferentially occur in low-metallicity environments, because of the clumpy\ninter-stellar medium effect. The high LAE fraction of GRB host galaxies\nindicated by observations is quantitatively be explained by the LAE model if\nGRBs occur when Z < 0.1Z_sun, although this result is still indicative because\nof the limited statistics and theoretical uncertainties.

In cold limit, the specific heat of charged black hole\nis linear in $T$ independent of the dimensionality, which is reminiscent of\nFermi liquids. The shear viscosity per particle is shown to be finite as a\nconsequence of the non-vanishing of the entropy.

For the static and dynamic\ndescription to be consistent we discovered, using a density functional\ndescription without explicit inclusion of quenched random interactions and a\nmean-field theory, that there be an exponentially large number of metastable\nstates at temperatures less than a critical transition temperature, $T_A$. At a\nlower temperature ($T_K < T_A$), which can be associated with the Kauzmann\ntemperature, the number of glassy states is non-extensive. Based on this theory\nwe formulated an entropic droplet picture to describe transport in finite\ndimensions in the temperature range $T_K < T < T_A$. From the finding that\nglasses are trapped in one of many metastable states below $T_A$ we argue that\nduring the SGT law of large numbers is violated. As a consequence in glasses\nthere are sub sample to sub sample fluctuations provided the system is observed\nfor times longer than the typical relaxation time in a liquid. These\nconsiderations, which find support in computer simulations and experiments,\nalso link the notion of dynamic heterogeneity to the violation of law of large\nnumbers.

It slips easily off the tongue, and it would\nbe hard to replace. Recently, however, several workers have postulated types of\nhabitable bodies which might exist outside the classic circumstellar habitable\nzone (HZ). These include not only bodies which orbit at substantial distances\nfrom their parent stars, but also snowball worlds with geothermally-maintained\ninternal oceans and even densely-atmosphered worlds with\ngeothermally-maintained surface oceans, which have been ejected from unstable\nplanetary systems into interstellar space. If habitability is not a unique and\ndiagnostic property of the HZ, then the value of the term has been compromised\nin a fundamental way. At the same time, it has become evident that multiple\nenvironmental states, differing in important ways in their habitability, are\npossible even for geophysically similar planets subject to similar levels of\ninsolation, within the classic HZ. We discuss an approach to investigations of\nplanetary habitability which focuses on planetary-scale ecosystems, which are\nhere termed - ecospheres. This is following a usage popular amongst ecologists,\nsuch as Huggett (1999), rather than that of authors such as Strughold (1953)\nand Dole (1964), who used it as a term for the HZ. This approach emphasizes\necodynamic perspectives, which explore the dynamic interactions between the\nbiotic and abiotic factors which together comprise ecosystems.\n","Comment: 26 pages, no figures"]}]

Explicit-time description methods verify real-time systems\nusing general model constructs found in standard un-timed model checkers.\nLamport proposed an explicit-time description method using a clock-ticking\nprocess (Tick) to simulate the passage of time together with a group of global\nvariables to model time requirements. Two methods, the Sync-based Explicit-time\nDescription Method using rendezvous synchronization steps and the\nSemaphore-based Explicit-time Description Method using only one global variable\nwere proposed; they both achieve better modularity than Lamport's method in\nmodeling the real-time systems. In contrast to timed automata based model\ncheckers like UPPAAL, explicit-time description methods can access and store\nthe current time instant for future calculations necessary for many real-time\nsystems, especially those with pre-emptive scheduling.

The two\npath lengths are accurately controlled to be the same to within a few\nnanometers.

Tests of the formalism are presented and compared with\nproper estimates. We derive the minimum mass of stellar populations which is\nrequired to reach a given confidence limit for a given integrated property. As\nan example of this general formalism, which can be included in any synthesis\ncode, we apply it to the case of young (t < 20 Myr) starburst populations.

The motivation for such an\nanalysis and a further result is the fact that a unitary transformation of this\nkind arises naturally in scattering theory on non-stationary backgrounds.\nIndeed, employing the perturbation theory of the Yang-Feldman equations with a\nfree CCR field in a quasifree state as an initial condition and making use of\nextended Feynman graphs, we are able to calculate the Wightman functions of the\ninteracting and outgoing fields in a $\\phi^p$-theory on arbitrary curved\nspacetimes. A further examination then reveals two major features of the\naforementioned theory: firstly, the interacting Wightman functions fulfil the\nbasic axioms of hermiticity, invariance, spectrality (on stationary\nspacetimes), perturbative positivity, and locality. Secondly, the outgoing\nfield is free and fulfils the CCR, but is in general not in a quasifree state\nin the case of a non-stationary spacetime. In order to obtain a sensible\nparticle picture for the outgoing field and, hence, a description of the\nscattering process in terms of particles (in asymptotically flat spacetimes),\nit is thus necessary to compute a unitary transformation of the abovementioned\ntype.\n","Comment: 33 pages, 9 figures | v2: some remarks on asymptotic conditions added\n  | v3: title changed, new proof of locality valid to all orders included"]}]
