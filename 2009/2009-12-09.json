This paper\nenables nodes to behave as intelligent entities which can proactively gather\ninformation, form internal conjectures on how their competitors would react to\ntheir actions, and update their beliefs according to their local observations.\nIn this way, nodes are capable to autonomously \"learn\" the behavior of their\ncompetitors, optimize their own actions, and eventually cultivate reciprocity\nin the random access network.

The photometric redshifts for these\ngalaxies are derived from three additional Euclid NIR bands (Y,J,H in the range\n0.92-2.0 micron) reaching AB mag 24 (5sigma) in each, complemented by\nphotometry from ground based surveys.
