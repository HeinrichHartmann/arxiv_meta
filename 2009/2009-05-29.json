We observe an unexpected gap-like feature in the graphene tunneling\nspectrum which remains pinned to the Fermi level (E_F) regardless of graphene\nelectron density. This gap is found to arise from a suppression of electronic\ntunneling to graphene states near E_F and a simultaneous giant enhancement of\nelectronic tunneling at higher energies due to a phonon-mediated inelastic\nchannel. Phonons thus act as a \"floodgate\" that controls the flow of tunneling\nelectrons in graphene. This work reveals important new tunneling processes in\ngate-tunable graphitic layers.\n"]}]

We present a two-dimensional relativistic\nhydrodynamic simulation of a GRB outflow during the afterglow phase, which uses\nthe fifth-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme and adaptive mesh\nrefinement. Initially, the jet has a Lorentz factor of 20. We have followed its\nevolution up to 150 years.

We find that the sideways expansion of a\nrelativistic GRB jet is a very slow process and previous analytic works have\noverestimated its rate. In our computed lightcurves, a very sharp jet break is\nseen and the post-break lightcurves are steeper than analytic predictions. We\nfind that the jet break in GRB afterglow lightcurves is mainly caused by the\nmissing flux when the edge of the jet is observed. The outflow becomes\nnonrelativistic at the end of the Blandford-McKee phase. But it is still highly\nnonspherical, and it takes a rather long time for it to become a spherical\nSedov-von Neumann-Taylor blast wave.

In the spirit of a minimalist approach,\nour model includes only the minimum of ingredients necessary to capture the\ngeneric features of this class of compounds as brought to light by experiments.\nWe consider only two kinds of particles: strongly coupled host atoms, which\nform the structural cavities, and guest atoms confined in the cavities. In\nspite of the confinement, for relatively small amplitude vibrations of the\nguest atoms, their interaction with the host particles is assumed to be weaker\nthan between the host atoms. We calculate self-consistently the vibrational\nmode (phonon) line broadenings for the empty and filled (by the guest atoms)\ncavities. We show that the soft phonon dispersion sheet, which appears for\nweakly bonded guest atoms, yields to large mode broadening via three waves\nanharmonic mode coupling. In turn the Umklapp part of this broadening reduces\ndrastically the phonon thermoconductivity coefficient. We conclude that for a\nsystem with a soft mode component in the vibrational spectrum phonon broadening\nis always larger and thermal conductivity is always appreciably smaller than\nfor a system without this soft mode (provided all other characteristics are the\nsame).

The setup can thus be used as a\nhigh-precision current meter for measuring ultra-low currents, with resolution\nseveral orders of magnitude better than that of conventional current meters.\n  In addition to measuring the average current, the counting procedure also\nmakes it possible to investigate correlations between charge carriers. In\nquantum dots, we find that the strong Coulomb interaction makes electrons try\nto avoid each other. This leads to electron anti-bunching, giving stronger\ncorrelations and reduced noise compared to a current carried by statistically\nindependent electrons.\n  The charge detector is implemented by monitoring changes in conductance in a\nnear-by capacitively coupled quantum point contact. We find that the quantum\npoint contact not only serves as a detector but also causes a back-action onto\nthe measured device. Electron scattering in the quantum point contact leads to\nemission of microwave radiation. The radiation is found to induce an electronic\ntransition between two quantum dots, similar to the absorption of light in real\natoms and molecules. Using a charge detector to probe the electron transitions,\nwe can relate a single-electron tunneling event to the absorption of a single\nphoton.

In\nview of this, here we investigate the evolution of metallicity in sub-DLAs. We\nfind that the mean Zn metallicity of the observed sub-DLAs may be higher than\nthat of the observed DLAs, especially at low redshifts, reaching a near-solar\nlevel at z <~ 1. This trend does not appear to be an artifact of sample\nselection, the use of Zn, the use of N_{HI}-weighting, or observational\nsensitivity. While a bias against very low metallicity could be present in the\nsub-DLA sample in some situations, this cannot explain the difference between\nthe DLA and sub-DLA metallicities at low z. The primary reason for the\ndifference between the DLAs and sub-DLAs appears to be the dearth of metal-rich\nDLAs. We estimate the sub-DLA contribution to the total metal budget using\nmeasures of their metallicity and comoving gas density. These calculations\nsuggest that at z <~ 1, the contribution of sub-DLAs to the total metal budget\nmay be several times that of DLAs.

We\nstudy perturbations of Myers-Perry black holes with equal angular momenta in an\nodd number of dimensions (greater than five), allowing for a cosmological\nconstant. We find a class of perturbations for which the equations of motion\nreduce to a single radial equation. In the asymptotically flat case we find no\nevidence of any instability. In the asymptotically anti-de Sitter case, we\ndemonstrate the existence of a superradiant instability that sets in precisely\nwhen the angular velocity of the black hole exceeds the speed of light from the\npoint of view of the conformal boundary.
