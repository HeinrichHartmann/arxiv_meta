When a sharply cut-off Coulomb force with a\ncut-off radius $\\rho$ is introduced at the level of constituent particles,\ntwo-cluster direct potential of the Coulomb force becomes in general a local\nscreened Coulomb potential. The asymptotic Hamiltonian yields two types of\nasymptotic waves; one is an approximate Coulomb wave with $\\rho$ in the\nmiddle-range region, and the other a free (no-Coulomb) wave in the\nlongest-range region. The constant Wronskians of this Hamiltonian can be\ncalculated in either region. We can evaluate the Coulomb-modified nuclear phase\nshifts for the screened Coulomb problem, using the matching condition proposed\nby Vincent and Phatak for the sharply cut-off Coulomb problem. We apply this\nmethod first to an exactly solvable model of the $\\alpha \\alpha$ scattering\nwith the Ali-Bodmer potential and confirm that a complete solution is obtained\nwith a finite $\\rho$. The stability of nuclear phase shifts with respect to the\nchange of $\\rho$ in some appropriate range is demonstrated in the $\\alpha\n\\alpha$ resonating-group method (RGM) using the Minnesota three-range force.

Among those, palladium (Pd) and especially silver (Ag)\nare expected to be key indicators of a possible second r-process, but until\nrecently they have been studied only in a few stars. Therefore we target Pd and\nAg in a large sample of stars and compare these abundances to those of Sr, Y,\nZr, Ba and Eu produced by the slow (s-) and rapid (r-) neutron-capture\nprocesses. Hereby we investigate the nature of the formation process of Ag and\nPd.

The\nabundance ratios of the heavy elements yield correlations and\nanti-correlations. These trends lead to clear indications of the existence of a\nsecond/weak r-process, responsible for the formation of Pd and Ag. By comparing\nto the model predictions, we find that the conditions under which this process\ntakes place differ from the main r-process in needing lower neutron number\ndensities, neutron-to-seed ratios, entropies and/or favour higher electron\nabundances.

In this paper, we propose Pisces, a\ndecentralized protocol for anonymous communications that leverages users'\nsocial links to build circuits for onion routing.

All existing solutions for secure\npeer discovery leverage structured topologies and cannot be applied to\nunstructured social network topologies. In Pisces, we discover peers by using\nrandom walks in the social network graph with a bias away from highly connected\nnodes to prevent a few nodes from dominating the circuit creation process. To\nsecure the random walks, we leverage the reciprocal neighbor policy: if\nmalicious nodes try to exclude honest nodes during peer discovery so as to\nimprove the chance of being selected, then honest nodes can use a tit-for-tat\napproach and reciprocally exclude the malicious nodes from their routing\ntables. We describe a fully decentralized protocol for enforcing this policy,\nand use it to build the Pisces anonymity system.\n  Using theoretical modeling and experiments on real-world social network\ntopologies, we show that (a) the reciprocal neighbor policy mitigates active\nattacks that an adversary can perform, (b) our decentralized protocol to\nenforce this policy is secure and has low overhead, and (c) the overall\nanonymity provided by our system significantly outperforms existing approaches.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 14 figures"]}]

A closed-form mode selection rule is then developed, which depends on\nthe user location and system settings, i.e, the number of cooperating base\nstations and transmit antennas, training overhead and cell-edge signal to noise\nratio. Simulation results show that the proposed downlink transmission mode\nselection method achieves higher throughput than CoMP for cell-center users and\nthan Non-CoMP for cell-edge users after accounting for the overhead.

Theoretical studies and models\nbased on the concepts of collective dynamics in complex systems,\nreaction-diffusion processes and emergent phenomena were proposed to explain\nsome of these behaviors. In the particular case of microtubule spatial\nself-organization, it has been advanced that microtubules could behave like\nants, self-organizing by 'talking to each other' by way of hypothetic (because\nnever observed) concentrated chemical trails of tubulin that are expected to be\nreleased by their disassembling ends. Deterministic models based on this idea\nyielded indeed like-looking spatio-temporal self-organizing behaviors.\nNevertheless the question remains of whether microscopic tubulin trails\nproduced by individual or bundles of several microtubules are intense enough to\nallow microtubule self-organization at a macroscopic level. In the present\nwork, by simulating the diffusion of tubulin in microtubule solutions at the\nmicroscopic scale, we measure the shape and intensity of tubulin trails and\ndiscuss about the assumption of microtubule self-organization due to the\nproduction of chemical trails by disassembling microtubules. We show that the\ntubulin trails produced by individual microtubules or small microtubule arrays\nare very weak and not elongated even at very high reactive rates. Although the\nvariations of concentration due to such trails are not significant compared to\nnatural fluctuations of the concentration of tubuline in the chemical\nenvironment, the study shows that heterogeneities of biochemical composition\ncan form due to microtubule disassembly. They could become significant when\nproduced by numerous microtubule ends located in the same place. Their possible\nformation could play a role in certain conditions of reaction. In particular,\nit gives a mesoscopic basis to explain the collective dynamics observed in\nexcitable microtubule solutions showing the propagation of concentration waves\nof microtubules at the millimeter scale, although we doubt that individual\nmicrotubules or bundles can behave like molecular ants.\n"]}]
