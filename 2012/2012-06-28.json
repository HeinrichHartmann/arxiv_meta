It is shown that this measure of nonadiabaticity applies\nin situations where other criteria, such as the energy gap criterion or the\nextent of population transfer, fail. We further propose to estimate this\nquantum fidelity efficiently with a generalization of the dephasing\nrepresentation to multiple surfaces. Two variants of the multiple-surface\ndephasing representation (MSDR) are introduced, in which the nuclei are\npropagated either with the fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH) or with the\nlocally mean field dynamics (LMFD). The LMFD can be interpreted as the\nEhrenfest dynamics of an ensemble of nuclear trajectories, and has been used\npreviously in the nonadiabatic semiclassical initial value representation. In\naddition to propagating an ensemble of classical trajectories, the MSDR\nrequires evaluating nonadiabatic couplings and solving the Schr\\\"{o}dinger (or\nmore generally, the quantum Liouville-von Neumann) equation for a single\ndiscrete degree of freedom. The MSDR can be also used to measure the importance\nof other terms present in the molecular Hamiltonian, such as diabatic\ncouplings, spin-orbit couplings, or couplings to external fields, and to\nevaluate the accuracy of quantum dynamics with an approximate nonadiabatic\nHamiltonian. The method is tested on three model problems introduced by Tully,\non a two-surface model of dissociation of NaI, and a three-surface model\nincluding spin-orbit interactions.

The largest flare data set of DO Cep in the literature has been\nobtained with 89 flares detected in 67.61 hours of U-band flare patrol. First\nof all, the observations demonstrated that the star is one of the most active\nflare stars in respect to the computed flare frequency. Secondly, using the\nindependent samples t-test, the detected flares were classified into two\nsubtypes, and then they were modelled. Analysing the models demonstrated that\nthe fast and slow flares occurring on the star can be separated with a critical\nvalue of the ratio of their decay time to rise time. The critical value was\ncomputed as 3.40. According to this value, the fast flare rate is 20.22%, while\nthe slow flare rate is 79.78%. Besides, there is a 39.282 times difference\nbetween the energies of these two types of flares. However, the flare\nequivalent durations versus the flare rise times increase in similar ways for\nboth groups. In addition, all all the flares were modelled with the one-phase\nexponential association function. Analysing this model, the plateau value was\nfound to be 2.810. Moreover, the half-life value was computed as 433.1s from\nthe model. The maximum flare rise time was found to be 1164s, while the maximum\nflare total duration was found to be 3472s. The results of the flare timescales\nindicate that the geometry of the flaring loop on the surface of the star might\nbe similar to those seen on analogues of DO Cep. Consequently, considering both\nthe half-life value and flare timescales, the flares detected on the surface of\nDO Cep get maximum energy in longer times, while the geometries of the flaring\nloops or areas get smaller.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables, 2011PASA...28..365D. arXiv admin note:\n  substantial text overlap with arXiv:1206.5794"]}]

The capacity of a gel network\nto crack during drying depends on the existence and significance of a pressure\ngradient in the pore liquid; in addition it depends on the way the gel relaxes\nthe resulting drying stresses. In this paper the effect of a binary mixture of\nsolvents saturating the gel network on the crack patterns formation is\ninvestigated. Indeed, incorporation of a small quantity of non-volatile\ncosolvent, i.e. glycerol, inhibits drying-induced cracks; moreover addition of\na concentration greater than 10% to a colloidal dispersion leads to a crack\nfree coating in room conditions. Mass variation with time reveals that both\nevaporation rate and cracking time are not affected by glycerol, in the range\nof added glycerol contents studied. In addition measurements of mechanical\nproperties show that the elastic modulus is reduced with glycerol content. The\ndecrease of the number of cracks with the glycerol content is related to the\nflattening of the pressure gradient in the pore liquid. The mechanism is shown\nto be due to the combination of two processes: flow driven by the pressure\ngradient and diffusion mechanisms in accordance with Scherer work (1989).\n","Comment: Accepted in Soft Matter"]}]

The most popular\ncumulative measure is the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic; when all probability\ndistributions under consideration are discrete, a natural noncumulative measure\nis the Euclidean distance between the model and the empirical distributions. In\nthe present paper, both mathematical analysis and its illustration via various\ndata sets indicate that the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic tends to be more\npowerful than the Euclidean distance when there is a natural ordering for the\nvalues that the draws can take -- that is, when the data is ordinal -- whereas\nthe Euclidean distance is more reliable and more easily understood than the\nKolmogorov-Smirnov statistic when there is no natural ordering (or partial\norder) -- that is, when the data is nominal.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables"]}]
