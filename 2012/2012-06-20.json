One year of Kepler observations of KIC 1718290 reveals a\nrich spectrum of low-amplitude modes with periods between one and twelve hours,\nmost of which follow a regular spacing of 276.3 s. This mode structure strongly\nresembles that of the V1093Her pulsators, with only a slight shift towards\nlonger periods. Our spectroscopy, however, reveals KIC 1718290 to be quite\ndistinct from the sdB stars that show V1093Her pulsations, which all have\nsurface gravities higher than log g = 5.1 and helium abundances depleted by at\nleast an order of magnitude relative to the solar composition. We find that\nKIC1718290 has T_eff = 22 100K, log g = 4.72, and a super-solar helium\nabundance (log N(He)/N(H) = -0.45). This places it well above the extreme\nhorizontal branch, and rather on the very blue end of the classical horizontal\nbranch, where shell hydrogen burning is present. We conclude that KIC 1718290\nmust have suffered extreme mass loss during its first giant stage, but not\nsufficient to reach the extreme horizontal branch.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJL"]}]

The fraction of close pairs is three times higher in the top density\nquartile than in the lowest one. This environmental variation in pair fractions\nwill translate into merger fractions since merger timescales are shown, based\non Millennium simulation catalogs, to be largely independent of environment.\nWhile galactic properties of close kinematic pairs (morphologies and star\nformation rates) may seem to be non-representative of an underlying galaxy\npopulation, they can be explained by taking into account well-known effects of\nenvironment, and changes caused by interactions. The latter is responsible for\nan increase of irregular galaxies in pairs by a factor of 50-75%, with a\ndisproportionate increase in the number of irregular-irregular pairs (4-8\ntimes), due to disturbance of about 15% of the disk galaxies in pairs.

While significant for paired galaxies, this\ntriggered star-formation due to interactions represents only about 5% of the\nintegrated star-formation activity in our volume-limited sample.

The method that we have\nused is the following. Firstly, the necessary notions of kinetic theory and\ndifferential geometry of second order differential equations are explained.\nThen an averaging procedure is applied to a connection associated with the\nLorentz force equation. The result of this averaging is an affine connection on\nthe space-time manifold. The corresponding geodesic equation defines the\naveraged Lorentz force equation. We prove that for ultra-relativistic beams\ndescribed by narrow distribution functions, the solutions of both equations are\nsimilar. This fact justifies the replacement of the Lorentz force equation by\nthe simpler {\\it averaged Lorentz force equation}. After this, for each of\nthese models we associate the corresponding kinetic model, which are based on\nthe Vlasov equation and {\\it averaged Vlasov equation} respectively. The\naveraged Vlasov equation is simpler than the original Vlasov equation. This\nfact allows us to prove that the differential operation defining the averaged\ncharged cold fluid equation is controlled by the {\\it diameter of the\ndistribution function}, by powers of the {\\it energy of the beam} and by the\ntime of evolution $t$. We show that the Vlasov equation and the averaged Vlasov\nequation have similar solutions, when the initial conditions are the same.\nFinally, as an application of the {\\it averaged Lorentz force equation} we\nre-derive the beam dynamics formalism used in accelerator physics from the\nJacobi equation of the averaged Lorentz force equation.\n","Comment: Thesis PhD in Physics"]}]

However, this paper considers a different\nscenario which does not fit in the Slepian-Wolf framework. We consider two\nidentical but spatially separated sources. We wish to study the universal\ncompression of a sequence of length $n$ from one of the sources provided that\nthe decoder has access to (i.e., memorized) a sequence of length $m$ from the\nother source. Such a scenario occurs, for example, in the universal compression\nof data from multiple mirrors of the same server. In this setup, the\ncorrelation does not arise from symbol-by-symbol dependency of two outputs from\nthe two sources. Instead, the sequences are correlated through the information\nthat they contain about the unknown source parameter. We show that the\nfinite-length nature of the compression problem at hand requires considering a\nnotion of almost lossless source coding, where coding incurs an error\nprobability $p_e(n)$ that vanishes with sequence length $n$. We obtain a lower\nbound on the average minimax redundancy of almost lossless codes as a function\nof the sequence length $n$ and the permissible error probability $p_e$ when the\ndecoder has a memory of length $m$ and the encoders do not communicate. Our\nresults demonstrate that a strict performance loss is incurred when the two\nencoders do not communicate even when the decoder knows the unknown parameter\nvector (i.e., $m \\to \\infty$).\n","Comment: To appear in 2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory\n  (ISIT'2012)"]}]

However, the remote sensing and in situ data of the same CME cannot be\ndirectly compared. Thus, we use several models to parameterize the two data\nsets. With the model results, we are able to compare the arrival time, Earth\nimpact speed, internal magnetic field, size and orientation as derived from the\nremote sensing and in situ methods. From the derived kinematics, we compare the\npredicted arrival times and impact velocities with the in situ data. We find\nthat even with nearly continuous observations and the best available model of\nthe CME structure, there is still a significant error in the predicted values.\nWe estimate the various forces acting on the CME as predicted by three\ntheoretical models of CME propagation and expansion and compare these results\nwith the observational results. We find that the flux rope model of Chen (1989)\nprovides the best agreement with the observations. With the flux rope model, we\nare able to predict the internal magnetic field of the CME near Earth from the\nremote sensing data to an order of magnitude. Finally, we compare the size and\norientation of the CMEs as predicted from the remote sensing and in situ data.\nWe find very little agreement between the values derived from the two data\nsets.\n","Comment: A Dissertation Submitted to George Mason University"]}]

For large potentials, the black hole phase is dominant and\nare preferred over the thermal-AdS space. Local stability is studied by\ncomputing the specific heat for constant potentials. The non-extreme black\nholes have two branches: small black holes are unstable and the large black\nholes are stable. The extreme black holes are shown to be stable both globally\nas well as locally. In addition to the thermodynamics, we also show that the\nphase structure relating the mass $M$ and the charge $Q$ of the black holes is\nsimilar to the liquid-gas-solid phase diagram.\n","Comment: Accepted to be published in Physical Review D.
