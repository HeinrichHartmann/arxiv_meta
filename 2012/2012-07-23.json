In this paper we present a lower bound for squashed entanglement in\nterms of a distance to the set of separable states. This implies that squashed\nentanglement is faithful, that is, strictly positive if and only if the state\nis entangled. We derive the bound on squashed entanglement from a bound on\nquantum conditional mutual information, which is used to define squashed\nentanglement and corresponds to the amount by which strong subadditivity of von\nNeumann entropy fails to be saturated. Our result therefore sheds light on the\nstructure of states that almost satisfy strong subadditivity with equality. The\nproof is based on two recent results from quantum information theory: the\noperational interpretation of the quantum mutual information as the optimal\nrate for state redistribution and the interpretation of the regularised\nrelative entropy of entanglement as an error exponent in hypothesis testing.\nThe distance to the set of separable states is measured by the one-way LOCC\nnorm, an operationally-motivated norm giving the optimal probability of\ndistinguishing two bipartite quantum states, each shared by two parties, using\nany protocol formed by local quantum operations and one-directional classical\ncommunication between the parties. A similar result for the Frobenius or\nEuclidean norm follows immediately. The result has two applications in\ncomplexity theory.

However, the computational power that is currently available\nrestricts the simulations to Reynolds numbers that are significantly smaller\nthan those in astrophysical settings. In order to increase computational\nefficiency and, therefore, probe a larger range of scales, one often takes into\naccount the fundamental anisotropy of field-guided MHD turbulence, with\ngradients being much slower in the field-parallel direction.

In this paper, we generalize some\naspects of this model in the presence of noncommutative Schwarzschild black\nhole by applying the method of coordinate coherent states describing smeared\nstructures. We implement two different distributions: (a) Gaussian and (b)\nLorentzian. Both mass distributions prepare the similar quantitative aspects\nfor the entropic force. Our study shows, the entropic force on the smallest\nfundamental unit of a holographic screen with radius $r_0$ vanishes. As a\nresult, black hole remnants are unconditionally inert even gravitational\ninteractions do not exist therein. So, a distinction between gravitational and\ninertial mass in the size of black hole remnant is observed, i.e. the failure\nof the principle of equivalence. In addition, if one considers the screen\nradius to be less than the radius of the smallest holographic surface at the\nPlanckian regime, then one encounters some unusual dynamical features leading\nto gravitational repulsive force and negative energy. On the other hand, the\nsignificant distinction between the two distributions is conceived to occur\naround $r_0$, and that is worth of mentioning: at this regime either our\nanalysis is not the proper one, or non-extensive statistics should be employed.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 2 figures, new references added, minor revision, Title\n  changed, to appear in EPJ Plus"]}]

Yet, until very recently, most such attempts were underpinned by\nresearch which predominantly regarded linguistic phenomena as separated from\nthe brain and body. This could lead one into believing that to emulate\nlinguistic behaviour, it suffices to develop 'software' operating on abstract\nrepresentations that will work on any computational machine. This picture is\ninaccurate for several reasons, which are elucidated in this paper and extend\nbeyond sensorimotor and semantic resonance. Beginning with a review of\nresearch, I list several heterogeneous arguments against disembodied language,\nin an attempt to draw conclusions for developing embodied multisensory agents\nwhich communicate verbally and non-verbally with their environment. Without\ntaking into account both the architecture of the human brain, and embodiment,\nit is unrealistic to replicate accurately the processes which take place during\nlanguage acquisition, comprehension, production, or during non-linguistic\nactions. While robots are far from isomorphic with humans, they could benefit\nfrom strengthened associative connections in the optimization of their\nprocesses and their reactivity and sensitivity to environmental stimuli, and in\nsituated human-machine interaction. The concept of multisensory integration\nshould be extended to cover linguistic input and the complementary information\ncombined from temporally coincident sensory impressions.\n","Comment: (2012) Developing embodied multisensory dialogue agents.

They must be able to adapt to and\nutilize spare capacity when and where it is available, and ensure that the\nnon-availability of an individual machine does not affect the availability of\nthe system. This thesis focuses on the requirements and design of a\nworkstation-based database system, which is motivated by an analysis of\nexisting database architectures that are typically run over static, specially\nprovisioned sets of machines. A typical clustered database system -- one that\nis run over a number of specially provisioned machines -- executes queries\ninteractively, returning a synchronous response to applications, with its data\nmade durable and resilient to the failure of machines. There are no existing\nworkstation-based databases. Furthermore, other workstation-based systems do\nnot attempt to achieve the requirements of interactivity and durability,\nbecause they are typically used to execute asynchronous batch processing jobs\nthat tolerate data loss -- results can be re-computed. These systems use\nexternal servers to store the final results of computations rather than\nworkstation machines. This thesis describes the design and implementation of a\nworkstation-based database system and investigates its viability by evaluating\nits performance against existing clustered database systems and testing its\navailability during machine failures.\n","Comment: Ph.D. Thesis"]}]

These results\nshow that our sampling algorithm extracts a smaller subgraph than other\nalgorithms while also achieving a closer convergence to the degree\ndistribution, measured by the degree exponent, of the original graph.

For this reason,\ncomparative macroevolutionary studies usually begin with an inferred phylogeny\nthat describes the evolutionary relationships of the organisms of interest. The\nprobability of the observed trait data can be computed by assuming a model for\ntrait evolution, such as Brownian motion, over the branches of this fixed tree.\nHowever, the phylogenetic tree itself contributes statistical uncertainty to\nestimates of other evolutionary quantities, and many comparative evolutionary\nbiologists regard the tree as a nuisance parameter. In this paper, we present a\nframework for analytically integrating over unknown phylogenetic trees in\ncomparative evolutionary studies by assuming that the tree arises from a\ncontinuous-time Markov branching model called the Yule process. To do this, we\nderive a closed-form expression for the distribution of phylogenetic diversity,\nwhich is the sum of branch lengths connecting a set of taxa. We then present a\ngeneralization of phylogenetic diversity which is equivalent to the expected\ntrait disparity in a set of taxa whose evolutionary relationships are generated\nby a Yule process and whose traits evolve by Brownian motion. We derive\nexpressions for the distribution of expected trait disparity under a Yule tree.\nGiven one or more observations of trait disparity in a clade, we perform fast\nlikelihood-based estimation of the Brownian variance for unresolved clades. Our\nmethod does not require simulation or a fixed phylogenetic tree.
