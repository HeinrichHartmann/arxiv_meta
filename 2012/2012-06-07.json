Systems of classical\nself-gravitating particles can be studied with the standard tools of\nequilibrium statistical mechanics, provided the potential is regularized at\nsmall length scales and the system is confined in a box. The confinement\ncondition looks rather unphysical in general, so that it is natural to ask\nwhether what we learn with these studies is relevant to real self-gravitating\nsystems. In order to provide a first answer to this question we consider a\nbasic, simple, yet effective model of globular clusters, the King model. This\nmodel describes a self-consistently confined system, without the need of any\nexternal box, but the stationary state is a non-thermal one. In particular, we\nconsider the King model with a short-distance cutoff on the interactions and we\ndiscuss how such a cutoff affects the caloric curve, i.e. the relation between\ntemperature and energy. We find that the cutoff stabilizes a low-energy phase\nwhich is absent in the King model without cutoff; the caloric curve of the\nmodel with cutoff turns out to be very similar to that of previously studied\nconfined and regularized models, but for the absence of a high-energy gas-like\nphase. We briefly discuss the possible phenomenological as well as theoretical\nimplications of these results.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 13 figures"]}]

The integrated design is formulated as a\nmulti-objective optimisation problem in which the deviation is maximised and\nthe total system mass is minimised.
