By emulating the\nrole of the KZ equation as a connection on a suitable bundle, a difference\nequation version of the notion of connection is developed for which $H(z)$ is a\nflat section. Solving a family of difference equations satisfied by the Hurwitz\npolyzetas leads to the normalized multiple Bernoulli polynomials (NMBPs) as the\ncounterpart to the Hurwitz polyzeta functions, at tuples of negative integers.\nA generating function for these polynomials satisfies a similar difference\nequation to that of $H(z)$, but in contrast to the fact that said polynomials\nhave rational coefficients, the algebraic independence of the Hurwitz polyzeta\nfunctions is proven. The values of the NMBPs at $z=1$ provide a regularization\nof the multiple zeta values at tuples of negative integers, which is shown to\nagree with the regularization given in work of S. Akiyama and collaborators.\nVarious elementary properties of these values are proven.\n","Comment: 22 pages"]}]

The long-duration gravitational-waveforms emitted\nby such systems encode the structure of the strong field region of the massive\nblack hole, in which the inspiral occurs.

In this paper, we explore to what extent EMRI observations with LISA or\neLISA/NGO might be able to distinguish between General Relativity and a\nparticular modification of it, known as Dynamical Chern-Simons Modified\nGravity. Our analysis is based on a parameter estimation study that uses\napproximate gravitational waveforms obtained via a radiative-adiabatic method\nand is restricted to a five-dimensional subspace of the EMRI configuration\nspace.

In\npractice, pre-defined header sequences are used with the purpose of\nsynchronizing the different network nodes. However, in networks where relays\nmust be used for communication, the overhead required for synchronizing the\nentire network may be very significant.\n  In this work, we study the fundamental limits of energy-efficient\ncommunication in an asynchronous diamond network with two relays. We formalize\nthe notion of relay synchronization by saying that a relay is synchronized if\nthe conditional entropy of the arrival time of the source message given the\nreceived signals at the relay is small.

They should exert a\nrandom force on electrons and ions in a plasma, adding a random component to\ntheir motion. Products of randomly fluctuating quantities, such as velocity and\nmagnetic field, which are correlated through the dynamical equations of the\ntwo-fluid model of plasma, should then exhibit non-zero average values.\nInvestigation of such effects requires spatial-spectral representation of the\nnon-linear equations of the two-fluid model. Chandrasekhar-Kendall (CK)\nfunctions, their generating function and its gradient defined over an infinite\ndomain are shown to simultaneously provide orthogonal basis for solenoidal,\nscalar and irrotational fields respectively, facilitating transformation from\ncoordinate space to mode number space and back. This paper constructs a\ntheoretical framework for studying coherent effects of random forces due to\nrandom electromagnetic fields in a two-fluid plasma and discusses some results\nwhich follow from its structure. Azimuthally symmetric modes are shown to be\nthe sole beneficiaries of the cooperation of random modes in generating\nnon-random effects. The formalism also facilitates investigation of the\ninteraction between compressible dynamics, which plays a central role in plasma\ncompression, heating and confinement and incompressible dynamics, which is\ninvolved in phenomena like turbulence and self-organization.\n"]}]

As\nexpected from the analogy with a particle in a double-well potential,\ntransitions between these states become possible either at finite temperature,\nor in the quantum regime due to tunneling. In this analogy, besides local\nstability, one can also discuss global stability by comparing the two potential\nminima. For the Duffing oscillator, the stationary states emerge dynamically so\nthat a priori, a potential-minimum criterion for them does not exist. However,\nglobal stability is still relevant, and definable as the state containing the\nmajority population for long times, low temperature, and close to the classical\nlimit. Further, the crossover point is the parameter value at which global\nstability abruptly changes from one state to the other.\n  For the double-well model, the crossover point is defined by\npotential-minimum degeneracy. Given that this analogy is so effective in other\nrespects, it is thus striking that for the Duffing oscillator, the crossover\npoint turns out to be non-unique. Rather, none of the three aforementioned\nlimits commute with each other, and the limiting behaviour depends on the order\nin which they are taken.

Within our frame-work of this\nmodel, we obtain a threshold of the current in the motion of a single DW with\nthe perturbation theory on kink soliton solution to the corresponding\nferromagnetic system, and the threshold is shown to be dependent on the Gilbert\ndamping term. Also, the motion properties of the DW are discussed for the zero-\nand nonzero-damping cases, which shows that our theory to describe the dynamics\nof the DW are self-consistent.\n","Comment: 7pages, 3figures"]}]

This yields an integral\nvalued function on the m-dimensional torus, where m is the number of colors of\nthe link. The case m=1 corresponds to the Levine-Tristram signature. We show\nthat many remarkable properties of the latter invariant extend to this\nm-variable generalization: it vanishes for achiral colored links, it is\n`piecewise continuous', and the places of the jumps are determined by the\nAlexander invariants of the colored link. Using a 4-dimensional interpretation\nand the Atiyah-Singer G-signature theorem, we also prove that this signature is\ninvariant by colored concordance, and that it provides a lower bound for the\n`slice genus' of the colored link.\n","Comment: 40 pages, 20 figures"]}]
