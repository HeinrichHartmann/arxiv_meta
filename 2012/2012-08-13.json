At z=0, the simulated galaxies exhibit a wide variety of morphologies,\nfrom dispersion-dominated spheroids to pure disk galaxies. Surprisingly, these\nmorphological features are very poorly correlated with their halo properties:\ndisks form in halos with high and low net spin, and mergers play a negligible\nrole in the formation of spheroid stars, most of which form in-situ. More\nimportant to morphology is the coherent alignment of the angular momentum of\nbaryons that accrete over time to form a galaxy. Spheroids tend to form when\nthe spin of newly-accreted gas is misaligned with that of the extant galaxy,\nleading to the episodic formation of stars with different kinematics that\ncancel out the net rotation of the system. Disks, on the other hand, form out\nof gas that flows in with similar angular momentum to that of earlier-accreted\nmaterial. Gas accretion from a hot corona thus favours disk formation, whereas\ngas that flows \"cold\", often along separate, misaligned filaments, favours the\nformation of spheroids. In this scenario, most spheroids consist of\nsuperpositions of stellar components with distinct kinematics, age, and\nmetallicity, an arrangement that might survive to the present day given the\npaucity of major mergers. Since angular momentum is acquired largely at\nturnaround, morphology is imprinted early by the interplay of the tidal field\nand the shape of the material destined to form the galaxy.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 10 figures.

This modern way of \"system identification\"\nis more robust than finding point estimates of a parametric function\nrepresentation. In this article, we present a principled algorithm for robust\nanalytic smoothing in GP dynamic systems, which are increasingly used in\nrobotics and control. Our numerical evaluations demonstrate the robustness of\nthe proposed approach in situations where other state-of-the-art Gaussian\nfilters and smoothers can fail.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 1 figure, draft version of paper accepted at IEEE\n  Transactions on Automatic Control"]}]

The canonical thermally\naveraged cross section for a generic WIMP is usually stated as 3*10^-26\ncm^3s^-1, with unspecified uncertainty, and taken to be independent of WIMP\nmass. Recent searches for annihilation products of DM annihilation have just\nreached the sensitivity to exclude this canonical cross section for 100%\nbranching ratio to certain final states and small WIMP masses. The ultimate\ngoal is to probe all kinematically allowed final states as a function of mass\nand, if all states are adequately excluded, set a lower limit to the WIMP mass.\nProbing the low-mass region is further motivated due to recent hints for a\nlight WIMP in direct and indirect searches. We revisit the thermal relic\nabundance calculation for a generic WIMP and show that the required cross\nsection can be calculated precisely. It varies significantly with mass at\nmasses below 10 GeV, reaching a maximum of 5.2*10^-26 cm^3s^-1 at masses around\n0.3 GeV, and is 2.2*10^-26 cm^3s^-1 with feeble mass-dependence for masses\nabove 10 GeV.

This companion has a mass between 0.4 and 1 Msun and orbits one of the\ntwo main stars with a period of 65.831 \\pm 0.029 days and an eccentricity of\n0.52 \\pm 0.02. The radial velocities of the two stars were derived using a\nmodel of two fast-rotating line profiles. From the residuals, we found a hint\nof the stellar variations seen in the Kepler light curve with an amplitude of\nabout 1.41 km/s and a period close to the rotational period. This signal\nappears to be about three order of magnitude larger than expected for stellar\nactivity. From the analysis of the residuals, we also put a 3-sigma upper-limit\non the mass of the transiting planet KOI-13.01 of 14.8 Mjup and 9.4 Mjup,\ndepending on which star hosts the transit. We found that this new companion has\nno significant impact on the photometric determination of the mass of KOI-13.01\nbut is expected to affect precise infrared photometry. Finally, using dynamical\nsimulations, we infer that the new companion is orbiting around KOI-13B while\nthe transiting planet candidate is expected to orbit KOI-13A. Thus, the\ntransiting planet candidate KOI-13.01 is orbiting the main component of a\nhierarchical triple system.\n","Comment: Accepted in A&A Letters. 4 pages including 4 figures and the RV table"]}]

Already the\nmodelization of such systems is a non-trivial task, let alone their formal\nverification.\n  The purpose of this paper is to discuss the problem of distributed monitoring\non a simple model of finite-state distributed automata based on shared actions,\ncalled asynchronous automata. Monitoring is a question related to runtime\nverification: assume that we have to check a property $L$ against an unknown or\nvery complex system $A$, so that classical static analysis is not possible.\nTherefore instead of model-checking a monitor is used, that checks the property\non the underlying system at runtime.\n  We are interested here in monitoring distributed systems modeled as\nasynchronous automata. It is natural to require that monitors should be of the\nsame kind as the underlying system, so we consider here distributed monitoring.\nA distributed monitor does not have a global view of the system, therefore we\npropose the notion of locally monitorable trace language. Our main result shows\nthat if the distributed alphabet of actions is connected and if $L$ is a set of\ninfinite traces such that both $L$ and its complement $L^c$ are countable\nunions of locally safety languages, then $L$ is locally monitorable.
