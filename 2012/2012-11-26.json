However, in this paper we will\nshow that there are some problems associated with memristive synapses\n(memristive devices which are playing the role of biological synapses). For\nexample, we show that the variation rate of the memristance of memristive\ndevice depends completely on the current memristance of the device and\ntherefore it can change significantly with time during the learning phase. This\nphenomenon can degrade the performance of learning methods like Spike\nTiming-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and cause the corresponding neuromorphic\nsystems to become unstable. Finally, at the end of this paper, we illustrate\nthat using two serially connected memristive devices with different polarities\nas a synapse can somewhat fix the aforementioned problem.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 9 figures"]}]

The obtained virial coefficients depend on the deformation\nparameters p,q in the form symmetric under p<->q, and at p->1, q->1 turn into\nthose known for usual bosons. Besides real parameters, we analyze the case of\ncomplex mutually conjugate p and q and find interesting implications.

This heat transport enhancement is intimately related to a\ntransition in the turbulent flow structure from a regime dominated by a\nlarge-scale circulation (LSC), consisting of a single convection roll, at no or\nweak rotation to a regime dominated by vertically-aligned vortices at strong\nrotation. For a sample with an aspect ratio \\Gamma = D/L = 1 (D is the sample\ndiameter and L its height) the transition between the two regimes is indicated\nby a strong decrease in the LSC strength. In contrast, for \\Gamma = 1/2 Weiss\nand Ahlers [J. Fluid Mech. {\\bf{688}}, 461 (2011)] revealed the presence of a\nLSC-like sidewall temperature signature beyond the critical rotation rate. They\nsuggested that this might be due to the formation of a two-vortex state, in\nwhich one vortex extends vertically from the bottom into the sample interior\nand brings up warm fluid, while another vortex brings down cold fluid from the\ntop; this flow field would yield a sidewall temperature signature similar to\nthat of the LSC. Here we show by direct numerical simulations for \\Gamma= 1/2\nand parameters that allow direct comparison with experiment that the spatial\norganization of the vertically-aligned vortical structures in the convection\ncell do indeed yield (for the time average) a sinusoidal variation of the\ntemperature near the sidewall, as found in the experiment. This is also the\nessential and non-trivial difference with the \\Gamma=1 sample, where the\nvertically-aligned vortices are distributed randomly.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 6 figures"]}]

The model is a phantom burster consisting of\ntwo feedforward coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo systems, with three time scales. The\nforcing system (Regulator) evolves on the slowest scale and acts by moving the\nslow nullcline of the forced system (Secretor). There are three modes of\ndynamics: pulsatility (transient relaxation oscillation), surge (quasi steady\nstate) and small oscillations related to the passage of the slow nullcline\nthrough a fold point of the fast nullcline. We derive a variety of reductions,\ntaking advantage of the mentioned features of the system. We obtain two\nresults; one on the local dynamics near the fold in the parameter regime\ncorresponding to the presence of small oscillations and the other on the global\ndynamics, more specifically on the existence of an attracting limit cycle. Our\nlocal result is a rigorous characterization of small canards and sectors of\nrotation in the case of folded node with an additional time scale, a feature\nallowing for a clear geometric argument. The global result gives the existence\nof an attracting unique limit cycle, which, in some parameter regimes, remains\nattracting and unique even during passages through a canard explosion.\n","Comment: 38 pages, 16 figures"]}]

This dependence limits the overall ability of upcoming large\nweak-lensing surveys to constrain cosmological parameters.\n  We seek to provide a concise overview of the impact of pixel noise on\nweak-lensing measurements, covering the entire path from noisy images to shear\nestimates. We show that there are at least three distinct layers, where pixel\nnoise not only obscures but biases the outcome of the measurements: 1) the\npropagation of pixel noise to the non-linear observable ellipticity; 2) the\nresponse of the shape-measurement methods to limited amount of information\nextractable from noisy images; and 3) the reaction of shear estimation\nstatistics to the presence of noise and outliers in the measured ellipticities.\n  We identify and discuss several fundamental problems and show that each of\nthem is able to introduce biases in the range of a few tenths to a few percent\nfor galaxies with typical significance levels. Furthermore, all of these biases\ndo not only depend on the brightness of galaxies but also on their ellipticity,\nwith more elliptical galaxies often being harder to measure correctly. We also\ndiscuss existing possibilities to mitigate and novel ideas to avoid the biases\ninduced by pixel noise. We present a new shear estimator that shows a more\nrobust performance for noisy ellipticity samples. Finally, we release the\nopen-source python code to predict and efficiently sample from the noisy\nellipticity distribution and the shear estimators used in this work at\nhttps://github.com/pmelchior/epsnoise\n","Comment: integrated the origin of the moment correlation (thanks to Alan\n  Heavens). source code at https://github.com/pmelchior/epsnoise"]}]

In the present calculation, we consider\nnot only the tensor coupling of vector mesons to octet baryons and the form\nfactors at interaction vertexes but also the internal (quark) structure change\nof baryons in dense matter. The relativistic Hartree-Fock calculations are\nperformed in two ways: one is the calculation with the coupling constants\ndetermined by SU(6) (quark model) symmetry, the other is with the coupling\nconstants based on SU(3) (flavor) symmetry. For the latter case, we use the\nlatest Nijmegen (ESC08) model. Then, it is very remarkable that the particle\ncomposition of the core matter in SU(3) symmetry is completely different from\nthat in SU(6) symmetry. In SU(6) symmetry, all octet baryons appear in the\ndensity region below $\\sim 1.2$ fm$^{-3}$, while, in the ESC08 model, only the\n\\Xi^- hyperon is produced. Furthermore, the medium modification of the internal\nbaryon structure hardens the equation of state for the core matter. Taking all\nthese effects into account, we can obtain the maximum neutron-star mass which\nis consistent with the recently observed mass, 1.97 \\pm 0.04 M_\\sun (PSR\nJ1614-2230).

Furthermore,\nthe effects of the form factor at vertex and the Fock contribution including\nthe tensor coupling due to the vector mesons are indispensable to describe the\ncore matter.

If the diffusion regime in a MC is similar to Galactic diffusion, the\nproduced electrons should rapidly escape the cloud and contribute to the\nGalactic CR population at very high energies >100 TeV. However, due to the\nmodest jet luminosity (at the level of 10^35 erg s^-1) and low filling factor\nof MC, these sources cannot make a significant contribution to the spectrum of\ncosmic ray electrons at lower energies. On the other hand, if the diffusion\nwithin MCs operates at a rate close to the Bohm limit, the CR electrons\nescaping from the source should be confined in the cloud, significantly\ncontributing to the local density of CRs. The IC emission of these\nlocally-generated CRs may explain the variety of gamma ray spectra detected\nfrom nearby MCs.\n","Comment: 6 pages, accepted by MNRAS"]}]

The discussion finds important applications in cosmology,\nlike e.g. in the description of test Klein-Gordon fields and scalar\nperturbations in Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime in the observationally\nfavored flat case. Two types of ambiguities in the quantization are analyzed.\nFirst, the infinite ambiguity existing in the choice of a Fock representation\nfor the canonical commutation relations, understandable as the freedom in the\nchoice of inequivalent vacua for a given field. Besides, in cosmological\nsituations, it is customary to scale the fields by time dependent functions,\nwhich absorb part of the evolution arising from the spacetime, which is treated\nclassically. This leads to an additional ambiguity, this time in the choice of\na canonical pair of field variables. We show that both types of ambiguities are\nremoved by the requirements of (a) invariance of the vacuum under the\nsymmetries of the three-torus, and (b) unitary implementation of the dynamics\nin the quantum theory. In this way, one arrives at a unique class of unitarily\nequivalent Fock quantizations for the system.

The spin-orbit interaction responsible for\nthis transition in silicene is much stronger than in graphene, which should\nmake the transition observable experimentally.\n","Comment: 3 pages, 3 figures"]}]

The inclusion of\nanisotropic Coulomb and exchange interactions in the DFT+U approach, defining U\nand J explicitly, corrects these errors and leads to an antiferromagnetic\nground state with a fundamental gap of 0.8 eV consistent with low temperature\nexperiments.

We find that temperature-dependent conformational changes\nassociated with surface melting strongly affect layer nucleation dynamics,\nwhich in turn determines many snow-crystal characteristics. A key feature in\nour model is the substantial role played by structure-dependent attachment\nkinetics, producing a growth instability that is largely responsible for the\nformation of thin plates and hollow columnar forms. Putting these elements\ntogether, we are able to explain the overall growth behavior of atmospheric ice\ncrystals over a broad range of conditions.
