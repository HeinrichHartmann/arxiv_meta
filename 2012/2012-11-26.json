For\nexample, we show that the variation rate of the memristance of memristive\ndevice depends completely on the current memristance of the device and\ntherefore it can change significantly with time during the learning phase. This\nphenomenon can degrade the performance of learning methods like Spike\nTiming-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and cause the corresponding neuromorphic\nsystems to become unstable. Finally, at the end of this paper, we illustrate\nthat using two serially connected memristive devices with different polarities\nas a synapse can somewhat fix the aforementioned problem.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 9 figures"]}]

This heat transport enhancement is intimately related to a\ntransition in the turbulent flow structure from a regime dominated by a\nlarge-scale circulation (LSC), consisting of a single convection roll, at no or\nweak rotation to a regime dominated by vertically-aligned vortices at strong\nrotation. For a sample with an aspect ratio \\Gamma = D/L = 1 (D is the sample\ndiameter and L its height) the transition between the two regimes is indicated\nby a strong decrease in the LSC strength. In contrast, for \\Gamma = 1/2 Weiss\nand Ahlers [J. Fluid Mech. {\\bf{688}}, 461 (2011)] revealed the presence of a\nLSC-like sidewall temperature signature beyond the critical rotation rate. They\nsuggested that this might be due to the formation of a two-vortex state, in\nwhich one vortex extends vertically from the bottom into the sample interior\nand brings up warm fluid, while another vortex brings down cold fluid from the\ntop; this flow field would yield a sidewall temperature signature similar to\nthat of the LSC. Here we show by direct numerical simulations for \\Gamma= 1/2\nand parameters that allow direct comparison with experiment that the spatial\norganization of the vertically-aligned vortical structures in the convection\ncell do indeed yield (for the time average) a sinusoidal variation of the\ntemperature near the sidewall, as found in the experiment. This is also the\nessential and non-trivial difference with the \\Gamma=1 sample, where the\nvertically-aligned vortices are distributed randomly.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 6 figures"]}]

The model is a phantom burster consisting of\ntwo feedforward coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo systems, with three time scales.

There are three modes of\ndynamics: pulsatility (transient relaxation oscillation), surge (quasi steady\nstate) and small oscillations related to the passage of the slow nullcline\nthrough a fold point of the fast nullcline. We derive a variety of reductions,\ntaking advantage of the mentioned features of the system. We obtain two\nresults; one on the local dynamics near the fold in the parameter regime\ncorresponding to the presence of small oscillations and the other on the global\ndynamics, more specifically on the existence of an attracting limit cycle. Our\nlocal result is a rigorous characterization of small canards and sectors of\nrotation in the case of folded node with an additional time scale, a feature\nallowing for a clear geometric argument. The global result gives the existence\nof an attracting unique limit cycle, which, in some parameter regimes, remains\nattracting and unique even during passages through a canard explosion.\n","Comment: 38 pages, 16 figures"]}]

This dependence limits the overall ability of upcoming large\nweak-lensing surveys to constrain cosmological parameters.\n  We seek to provide a concise overview of the impact of pixel noise on\nweak-lensing measurements, covering the entire path from noisy images to shear\nestimates. We show that there are at least three distinct layers, where pixel\nnoise not only obscures but biases the outcome of the measurements: 1) the\npropagation of pixel noise to the non-linear observable ellipticity; 2) the\nresponse of the shape-measurement methods to limited amount of information\nextractable from noisy images; and 3) the reaction of shear estimation\nstatistics to the presence of noise and outliers in the measured ellipticities.\n  We identify and discuss several fundamental problems and show that each of\nthem is able to introduce biases in the range of a few tenths to a few percent\nfor galaxies with typical significance levels. Furthermore, all of these biases\ndo not only depend on the brightness of galaxies but also on their ellipticity,\nwith more elliptical galaxies often being harder to measure correctly. We also\ndiscuss existing possibilities to mitigate and novel ideas to avoid the biases\ninduced by pixel noise. We present a new shear estimator that shows a more\nrobust performance for noisy ellipticity samples. Finally, we release the\nopen-source python code to predict and efficiently sample from the noisy\nellipticity distribution and the shear estimators used in this work at\nhttps://github.com/pmelchior/epsnoise\n","Comment: integrated the origin of the moment correlation (thanks to Alan\n  Heavens). source code at https://github.com/pmelchior/epsnoise"]}]

The events were selected with low latency by the network\nof GW detectors and their candidate sky locations were observed by the Swift\nobservatory. Image transient detection was used to analyze the collected\nelectromagnetic data, which were found to be consistent with background.\nOff-line analysis of the GW data alone has also established that the selected\nGW events show no evidence of an astrophysical origin; one of them is\nconsistent with background and the other one was a test, part of a \"blind\ninjection challenge\". With this work we demonstrate the feasibility of rapid\nfollow-ups of GW transients and establish the sensitivity improvement joint\nelectromagnetic and GW observations could bring.

In the present calculation, we consider\nnot only the tensor coupling of vector mesons to octet baryons and the form\nfactors at interaction vertexes but also the internal (quark) structure change\nof baryons in dense matter. The relativistic Hartree-Fock calculations are\nperformed in two ways: one is the calculation with the coupling constants\ndetermined by SU(6) (quark model) symmetry, the other is with the coupling\nconstants based on SU(3) (flavor) symmetry. For the latter case, we use the\nlatest Nijmegen (ESC08) model. Then, it is very remarkable that the particle\ncomposition of the core matter in SU(3) symmetry is completely different from\nthat in SU(6) symmetry. In SU(6) symmetry, all octet baryons appear in the\ndensity region below $\\sim 1.2$ fm$^{-3}$, while, in the ESC08 model, only the\n\\Xi^- hyperon is produced. Furthermore, the medium modification of the internal\nbaryon structure hardens the equation of state for the core matter. Taking all\nthese effects into account, we can obtain the maximum neutron-star mass which\nis consistent with the recently observed mass, 1.97 \\pm 0.04 M_\\sun (PSR\nJ1614-2230). We therefore conclude that the extension from SU(6) symmetry to\nSU(3) symmetry in the meson-baryon couplings and the internal baryon-structure\nvariation in matter certainly enhance the mass of neutron star. Furthermore,\nthe effects of the form factor at vertex and the Fock contribution including\nthe tensor coupling due to the vector mesons are indispensable to describe the\ncore matter.

Long-term climate evolution simulations\nindicate that in these circumstances, water ice is transported to the highlands\nfrom low-lying regions for a wide range of orbital obliquities, regardless of\nthe extent of the Tharsis bulge. In addition, an extended water ice cap forms\non the southern pole, approximately corresponding to the location of the\nNoachian/Hesperian era Dorsa Argentea Formation. Even for a multiple-bar CO2\natmosphere, conditions are too cold to allow long-term surface liquid water.\nLimited melting occurs on warm summer days in some locations, but only for\nsurface albedo and thermal inertia conditions that may be unrealistic for water\nice. Nonetheless, meteorite impacts and volcanism could potentially cause\nintense episodic melting under such conditions. Because ice migration to higher\naltitudes is a robust mechanism for recharging highland water sources after\nsuch events, we suggest that this globally sub-zero, `icy highlands' scenario\nfor the late Noachian climate may be sufficient to explain most of the fluvial\ngeology without the need to invoke additional long-term warming mechanisms or\nan early warm, wet Mars.\n","Comment: Minor revisions to text, one new table, figs. 1,3 11 and 18 redone"]}]

The discussion finds important applications in cosmology,\nlike e.g. in the description of test Klein-Gordon fields and scalar\nperturbations in Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime in the observationally\nfavored flat case. Two types of ambiguities in the quantization are analyzed.\nFirst, the infinite ambiguity existing in the choice of a Fock representation\nfor the canonical commutation relations, understandable as the freedom in the\nchoice of inequivalent vacua for a given field. Besides, in cosmological\nsituations, it is customary to scale the fields by time dependent functions,\nwhich absorb part of the evolution arising from the spacetime, which is treated\nclassically. This leads to an additional ambiguity, this time in the choice of\na canonical pair of field variables. We show that both types of ambiguities are\nremoved by the requirements of (a) invariance of the vacuum under the\nsymmetries of the three-torus, and (b) unitary implementation of the dynamics\nin the quantum theory. In this way, one arrives at a unique class of unitarily\nequivalent Fock quantizations for the system.

Estimating and testing the model index coefficients\n$\\bolds{\\beta}$ is one of the most important objectives in the statistical\nanalysis.

This work examines evidence of a\ncosmic ray cloud link from a range of sources, including satellite-based cloud\nmeasurements and long-term ground-based climatological measurements.

Although the differences between them are\nconsiderable, neither shows evidence of a solar-cloud link at either long or\nshort timescales. Furthermore, reports of observed correlations between solar\nactivity and cloud over the 1983 to 1995 period are attributed to the chance\nagreement between solar changes and artificially induced cloud trends. It is\npossible that the satellite cloud datasets and analysis methods may simply be\ntoo insensitive to detect a small solar signal.

In addition to its potential as a source, precise measurements\nof betatron emission can reveal crucial information about relativistic\nlaser-plasma interaction.

Moreover,\nthe measurement of the longitudinal extension helps one to determine whether\nthe acceleration is limited by pump depletion or dephasing effects. In the case\nof multiple injections, it is used to retrieve unambiguously the position in\nthe plasma of each injection. This technique is also used to study how, in a\ncapillary discharge, the variations of the delay between the discharge and the\nlaser pulse affect the interaction.

Our model derives in part from empirical measurements of the\nintrinsic ice growth rates as a function of temperature and supersaturation,\nalong with additional observations and analyses of diffusion-driven growth\ninstabilities. We find that temperature-dependent conformational changes\nassociated with surface melting strongly affect layer nucleation dynamics,\nwhich in turn determines many snow-crystal characteristics. A key feature in\nour model is the substantial role played by structure-dependent attachment\nkinetics, producing a growth instability that is largely responsible for the\nformation of thin plates and hollow columnar forms. Putting these elements\ntogether, we are able to explain the overall growth behavior of atmospheric ice\ncrystals over a broad range of conditions. Although our model is complex and\nstill incomplete, we believe it provides a useful framework for directing\nfurther investigations into the physics underlying snow crystal growth.\nAdditional targeted experimental investigations should better characterize the\nmodel, or suggest modifications, and we plan to pursue these investigations in\nfuture publications in this series.
