Although Hall drift does not cause any dissipation in the ambient\nplasma, it can destabilise the flux tubes and magnetic elements in the presence\nof azimuthal shear flow. The physical mechanism of this instability is quite\nsimple: the shear flow twists the radial magnetic field and generates azimuthal\nfield; torsional oscillations of the azimuthal field in turn generates the\nradial field completing feedback loop. The maximum growth rate of Hall\ninstability is proportional to the absolute value of the shear gradient and is\ndependent on the ambient diffusivity. The diffusivity also determines the most\nunstable wavelength which is smaller for weaker fields.\n  We apply the result of local stability analysis to the network and\ninternetwork magnetic elements and show that the maximum growth rate for\nkilogauss field occurs around $0.5 Mm$ and decreases with increasing altitude.\nHowever, for a $120 G$ field, the maximum growth rate remains almost constant\nin the entire photosphere-lower chromosphere except in a small region of lower\nphotosphere.

We have investigated this from a managerial,\norganisational perspective. We found at the study site that there are already\nseveral social network technologies in use, and that these: misalign with and\nproblematize organisational boundaries; blur boundaries between working and\nsocial lives; present differing opportunities for control; have different\nvisibilities; have overlapping functionality with each other and with other\ninformation technologies; that they evolve and change over time; and that their\nuptake is conditioned by existing infrastructure and availability. We find the\norganisational complexity that social technologies are often hoped to cut\nacross is, in reality, something that shapes their uptake and use. We argue the\nidea of a single, central social network site for supporting cooperative work\nwithin an organisation will hit the same problems as any effort of\ncentralisation in organisations. We argue that while there is still plenty of\nscope for design and innovation in this area, an important challenge now is in\nsupporting organisations in managing what can best be referred to as a social\nnetwork site 'ecosystem'.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in JCSCW (The Journal of Computer Supported\n  Cooperative Work)"]}]

For large $V$, it is\nintimately related to an autonomous, nonlinear ordinary differential equation\nas well as a diffusion process. For nonlinear dynamical systems with multiple\nattractors, the quasi-stationary and stationary behavior of such a birth-death\nprocess can be underestood in terms of a separation of time scales by a\n$T^*\\sim e^{\\alpha V}$ $(\\alpha>0)$: a relatively fast, intra-basin diffusion\nfor $t\\ll T^*$ and a much slower inter-basin Markov jump process for $t\\gg\nT^*$.

In\nour proposal, each thread views its tables as private but, at the engine level,\nwe use a common table space where tables are shared among all threads. We\npresent three designs for our common table space approach: No-Sharing (NS)\n(similar to XSB's private tables), Subgoal-Sharing (SS) and Full-Sharing (FS).\nThe primary goal of this work was to reduce the memory usage for the table\nspace but, our experimental results, using the YapTab tabling system with a\nlocal evaluation strategy, show that we can also achieve significant reductions\non running time.\n","Comment: To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming"]}]

My conclusion is that there is little or no evidence for\nsuch objects.\n  Panchromatic properties of all types of radio loud AGN are then reviewed in\ndetail. Radio galaxies usually show subparsec-scale radio core sources, jets,\nand a pair of giant radio lobes. The optical spectra sometimes show only\nrelatively weak lines of low-ionization ionic species, and no clear nuclear\ncontinuum in the optical or UV region of the spectrum. Some show strong\nhigh-ionization narrow lines. Finally, a few radio galaxies add broad bases\nonto the permitted lines. These spectral categories are the same as those for\nradio-quiet AGN and quasars.\n  By the 1980s, data from optical polarization and statistics of the radio\nproperties required that many narrow line radio galaxies do in fact produce\nstrong optical/UV continuum. This continuum and the broad line emission are\nhidden from the line of sight by dusty, roughly toroidal gas distributions, but\nthey are seen in polarized flux.

Substantial\nexperimental evidence has since accumulated in favor of this pairing symmetry,\nincluding several interesting recent results related to broken time reversal\nsymmetry and vortices with half of the usual superconducting flux quantum.\nGreat interest surrounds the possibility of chiral p-wave order in Sr2RuO4,\nsince this state may exhibit topological order analogous to that of a quantum\nHall state, and can support such exotic physics as Majorana fermions and\nnon-Abelian winding statistics, which have been proposed as one route to a\nquantum computer. However, serious discrepancies remain in trying to connect\nthe experimental results to theoretical predictions for chiral p-wave order. In\nthis paper, I review a broad range of experiments on Sr2RuO4 that are sensitive\nto p-wave pairing, triplet superconductivity and time-reversal symmetry\nbreaking and compare these experiments to each other and to theoretical\npredictions. In this context, the evidence for triplet pairing is strong,\nalthough some puzzles remain. The \"smoking gun\" experimental results for chiral\np-wave, those which directly look for evidence of broken time-reversal symmetry\nin the superconducting state of Sr2RuO4, are most perplexing when the results\nare compared to each other and to theoretical predictions. Consequently, the\ncase for chiral p-wave in Sr2RuO4 remains unresolved, suggesting the need to\nconsider either significant modifications to the standard chiral p-wave models\nor possible alternative pairing symmetries.
