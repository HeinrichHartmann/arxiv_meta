This framework, termed Particle Markov\nchain Monte Carlo (PMCMC), was shown to provide powerful methods for joint\nBayesian state and parameter inference in nonlinear/non-Gaussian state-space\nmodels. However, the mixing of the resulting MCMC kernels can be quite\nsensitive, both to the number of particles used in the underlying PF and to the\nnumber of observations in the data. In the discussion following (Andrieu et\nal., 2010), Whiteley suggested a modified version of one of the PMCMC samplers,\nnamely the particle Gibbs (PG) sampler, and argued that this should improve its\nmixing. In this paper we explore the consequences of this modification and show\nthat it leads to a method which is much more robust to a low number of\nparticles as well as a large number of observations.

This memo uses an\nelementary parametric analysis to make a quantitative, first-order cost\ncomparison of representative implementations of a single and dual-band system,\nchosen for comparable performance characteristics. A direct comparison of the\nSKA1-low station costs reveals that those costs are similar, although the\nuncertainties are high. The cost impact on the broader telescope system varies:\nthe deployment and site preparation costs are higher for the dual-band array,\nbut the digital signal processing costs are higher for the single-band array.\nThis parametric analysis also shows that a first stage of analogue tile\nbeamforming, as opposed to only station-level, all-digital beamforming, has the\npotential to significantly reduce the cost of the SKA1-low stations. However,\ntile beamforming can limit flexibility and performance, principally in terms of\nreducing accessible field of view. We examine the cost impacts in the context\nof scientific performance, for which the spacing and intra-station layout of\nthe antenna elements are important derived parameters.

A\ntwo-dimensional (2D) momentum density reconstruction from measured Compton\nprofiles yields a clear FS signature in the third Brillouin zone along [100].\nThe quantitative agreement between density functional theory (DFT) calculations\nand momentum density experiment suggests that Fermi-liquid physics is restored\nin the overdoped regime. In particular the predicted FS topology is found to be\nin good accord with the corresponding experimental data. We find similar\nquantitative agreement between the measured 2D angular correlation of positron\nannihilation radiation (2D-ACAR) spectra and the DFT based computations.\nHowever, 2D-ACAR does not give such a clear signature of the FS in the extended\nmomentum space in either the theory or the experiment.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 8 figures"]}]
