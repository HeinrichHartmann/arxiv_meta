Thus motivated, we explore adaptive NC, where the block size\nis adapted based on the remaining time to the deadline, by casting this\nsequential block size adaptation problem as a finite-horizon Markov decision\nprocess. One interesting finding is that the optimal block size and its\ncorresponding action space monotonically decrease as the deadline approaches,\nand the optimal block size is bounded by the \"greedy\" block size.

It is known that the system of polynomials, orthogonal with\nrespect to this weight, and the associated functions satisfy a linear, first\norder homogeneous matrix equation in the divided-difference operator termed the\nspectral equation. Attached to the spectral equation is a structure which\nconstitutes a number of relations such as those arising from compatibility with\nthe three-term recurrence relation.

Our mixer technology development\nefforts culminate in the first successful operation of a waveguide-based HEB\nmixer at 2.5 THz and deployment for radioastronomy. A significant contribution\nto the success of GREAT is made by technological development, thorough\ncharacterization and performance optimization of the mixer and its IF interface\nfor receiver operation on SOFIA.

SSRFs are defined by means of physically motivated spatial\ninteractions and a small set of free parameters (interaction couplings). This\npaper focuses on the FGC-SSRF model, which is defined on the Euclidean space\n$\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ by means of interactions proportional to the squares of the\nfield realizations, as well as their gradient and curvature. The permissibility\ncriteria of FGC-SSRFs are extended by considering the impact of a\nfinite-bandwidth kernel. It is proved that the FGC-SSRFs are almost surely\ndifferentiable in the case of finite bandwidth. Asymptotic explicit expressions\nfor the Spartan covariance function are derived for $d=1$ and $d=3$; both known\nand new covariance functions are obtained depending on the value of the\nFGC-SSRF shape parameter. Nonlinear dependence of the covariance integral scale\non the FGC-SSRF characteristic length is established, and it is shown that the\nrelation becomes linear asymptotically. The results presented in this paper are\nuseful in random field parameter inference, as well as in spatial interpolation\nof irregularly-spaced samples.\n","Comment: 24 pages; 4 figures Submitted for publication to IEEE Transactions on\n  Information Theory"]}]
