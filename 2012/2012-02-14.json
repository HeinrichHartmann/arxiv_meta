In the first scenario we consider the\nproblem of defining the information leakage in interactive systems where\nsecrets and observables can alternate during the computation and influence each\nother. We show that the information-theoretic approach which interprets such\nsystems as (simple) noisy channels is not valid. The principle can be recovered\nif we consider channels with memory and feedback.

The methodology is pure dual in the sense that it doesn't\nrequire certain input approximations to the Snell envelope.

The calculation\nrequires the value of a multiplicative correction factor to the apparent\ncoefficient of viscosity calculated by substitution of terminal velocity of the\nfalling ball in Stokes formula. This correction factor, the so-called viscosity\nratio, a measure of deviation from Stokes limit, arises from non-vanishing\nvalues of the Reynolds number and the ball/tube radius ratio. The method, valid\nover a very wide range of Reynolds number, is based on the recognition of a\nrelationship between two measures of wall effect, the more widely investigated\nvelocity ratio, defined as the ratio of terminal velocity in a confined medium\nto that in a boundless medium and viscosity ratio. The calculation uses two\nrecently published correlation formulae based on extensive experimental results\non terminal velocity of a falling ball. The first formula relates velocity\nratio to Reynolds number and ball-tube radius ratio. The second formula gives\nan expression of the ratio of the drag force actually sensed by the ball\nfalling in an infinite medium to that in the Stokes limit as a function of\nReynolds number alone. It is shown that appropriate use of this correction\nfactor extends the utility of the technique of falling ball viscometry beyond\nthe very low Reynolds number 'creepy flow' regime, to which its application is\npresently restricted.

We develop improved analysis\ntools for data lying in a binary tree space analogous to classical Principal\nComponent Analysis methods in Euclidean space. Our extensions of PCA are\nanalogs of one dimensional subspaces that best fit the data. Previous work was\nbased on the notion of tree-lines.\n  In this paper, a generalization of the previous tree-line notion is proposed:\nk-tree-lines. Previously proposed tree-lines are k-tree-lines where k=1. New\nsub-cases of k-tree-lines studied in this work are the 2-tree-lines and\ntree-curves, which explain much more variation per principal component than\ntree-lines. The optimal principal component tree-lines were computable in\nlinear time. Because 2-tree-lines and tree-curves are more complex, they are\ncomputationally more expensive, but yield improved data analysis results.\n  We provide a comparative study of all these methods on a motivating data set\nconsisting of brain vessel structures of 98 subjects.\n"]}]

Sticking of H, D, HD, H2, and D2 on\nsilicates grains behaves the same as on icy dust grains. The sticking decreases\nwith the gas temperature, and is dependent on the mass of the impactor.

A unified probability-theoretic approach was\nused to describe bundle under continuous and discrete load increase. It was\nshown that the ratio of distribution D(d) of avalanches of sizes d to the\nnumber of bundle load steps exactly corresponds to burst probability of size d.\nEvolution of s - power law distribution exponent of D(d) was studied as a\nfunction of loading step and bundle size. It was shown that s does not depend\non bundle size. In the numerical experiment, dependence s on loading step was\nobtained with fiber bundle size up to N=10^10. The regions of s values\nconstancy and the transition region were found. A distribution of fiber bursts\non each loading step was recovered in the numerical simulations. It was shown\nthat a change in the type of this distribution is the reason for evolution of s\nvalues in the range of -3 - -5/2.\n"]}]

In this paper, we\nanalyze the outage probability of the multi-relay delay-limited HARQ system\nwith opportunistic relaying scheme in decode-and-forward mode, in which the\n\\emph{best} relay is selected to transmit the source's regenerated signal. A\nsimple and distributed relay selection strategy is proposed for multi-relay\nHARQ channels. Then, we utilize the non-orthogonal cooperative transmission\nbetween the source and selected relay for retransmitting of the source data\ntoward the destination if needed, using space-time codes or beamforming\ntechniques. We analyze the performance of the system. We first derive the\ncumulative density function (CDF) and probability density function (PDF) of the\nselected relay HARQ channels. Then, the CDF and PDF are used to determine the\noutage probability in the $l$-th round of HARQ. The outage probability is\nrequired to compute the throughput-delay performance of this half-duplex\nopportunistic relaying protocol. The packet delay constraint is represented by\n$L$, the maximum number of HARQ rounds. An outage is declared if the packet is\nunsuccessful after $L$ HARQ rounds. Furthermore, closed-form upper-bounds on\noutage probability are derived and subsequently are used to investigate the\ndiversity order of the system. Based on the derived upper-bound expressions, it\nis shown that the proposed schemes achieve the full spatial diversity order of\n$N+1$, where $N$ is the number of potential relays.
