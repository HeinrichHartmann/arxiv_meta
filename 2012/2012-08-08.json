The testing time can\nalso be expensive if a new data point (e.g., a new document or image) has not\nbeen processed, which might be a significant issue in user-facing applications.\n  We develop a very simple solution based on one permutation hashing.\nConceptually, given a massive binary data matrix, we permute the columns only\nonce and divide the permuted columns evenly into k bins; and we simply store,\nfor each data vector, the smallest nonzero location in each bin. The\ninteresting probability analysis (which is validated by experiments) reveals\nthat our one permutation scheme should perform very similarly to the original\n(k-permutation) minwise hashing.

Results using co-spatial and co-temporal data from AIA/SDO do not\nshow any significant peak corresponding to shorter periods, but longer periods\nare clearly observed in both 171 \\AA and 193 \\AA channels. Space-time analysis\nin these fan loops using images from AIA/SDO show alternate slanted ridges of\npositive slope, indicative of outward propagating disturbances. The apparent\npropagation speeds were estimated to be 83.5 $\\pm$ 1.8 \\kms and 100.5 $\\pm$ 4.2\n\\kms, respectively, in the 171 \\AA and 193 \\AA channels. Observed short period\noscillations are suggested to be caused by the simultaneous presence of more\nthan one MHD mode whereas the long periods are suggested as signatures of slow\nmagneto-acoustic waves. In case of shorter periods, the amplitude of\noscillation is found to be higher in EIS lines with relatively higher\ntemperature of formation. Longer periods, when observed from AIA, show a\ndecrease of amplitude in hotter AIA channels which might indicate damping due\nto thermal conduction owing to their acoustic nature.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Solar Physics"]}]

We have found, contrary to previous\nreports, that SmVO3 exists in a single, monoclinic, phase below 200 K. The\nassociated crystallographic distortion is then stabilized through the\nmagnetostriction that occurs below 134 K. The crystal structure has been\nrefined using synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction data measured throughout the\nstructural phase diagram, showing a substantial Jahn-Teller distortion of the\nVO6 octahedra in the monoclinic phase, compatible with the expected G-type\norbital order. Changes in the vanadium ion crystal field due to the structural\nand magnetic transitions have then been probed by resonant x-ray diffraction.\n","Comment: Published in Physical Review B"]}]
