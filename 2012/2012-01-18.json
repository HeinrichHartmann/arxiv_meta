As\nan example, we compute the dust emission of proto-planetary disks. We simulate\nhow a mid-IR instrument mounted at a future 42m ELT will detect such disks. Two\ncases are distinguished: a homogeneous disk and a disk with an outward\nmigrating planet, producing a gap and a spiral density wave. We find that the\nresulting mid-IR spectra of both disks are almost identical. However, they can\nbe distinguished at those wavelengths by coronographic, dual-band imaging.\nFinally, the emission of PAHs exposed to different radiation fields is\ncomputed. We demonstrate that PAH emission depends not only on the strength but\nalso strongly on the hardness of the radiation, a fact which has often been\nneglected in previous models. We find that hard photons (>20eV) easily\ndissociate all PAHs in the disks of T Tauri stars. To explain the low, but not\nnegligible detection rate (<10%) of PAHs in T Tau disks, we suggest that\nturbulent motions act as a possible path for PAH survival.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures"]}]

In the limit as the\npenalty constant tends to $\\infty$, one recovers the constrained solution. In\nthe exact penalty method, squared penalties are replaced by absolute value\npenalties, and the solution is recovered for a finite value of the penalty\nconstant. In practice, the kinks in the penalty and the unknown magnitude of\nthe penalty constant prevent wide application of the exact penalty method in\nnonlinear programming. In this article, we examine a strategy of path following\nconsistent with the exact penalty method. Instead of performing optimization at\na single penalty constant, we trace the solution as a continuous function of\nthe penalty constant. Thus, path following starts at the unconstrained solution\nand follows the solution path as the penalty constant increases. In the\nprocess, the solution path hits, slides along, and exits from the various\nconstraints. For quadratic programming, the solution path is piecewise linear\nand takes large jumps from constraint to constraint. For a general convex\nprogram, the solution path is piecewise smooth, and path following operates by\nnumerically solving an ordinary differential equation segment by segment. Our\ndiverse applications to a) projection onto a convex set, b) nonnegative least\nsquares, c) quadratically constrained quadratic programming, d) geometric\nprogramming, and e) semidefinite programming illustrate the mechanics and\npotential of path following. The final detour to image denoising demonstrates\nthe relevance of path following to regularized estimation in inverse problems.\nIn regularized estimation, one follows the solution path as the penalty\nconstant decreases from a large value.\n"]}]
