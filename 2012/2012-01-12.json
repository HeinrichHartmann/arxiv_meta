One such domain is the\nemergence of statistical regularities in the evolution of collective choice\nfrom individual behavior.

In this paper, we present an\nempirical study of a wide range of popularity distributions, spanning from\nscientific paper citations to movie gross income.

This suggests the existence of some general principles of complex\norganization leading to the emergence of popularity.

These measurements are necessary to determine the\nabsolute cross-sections of reaction processes and are valuable to quantify the\nperformance of the accelerator. Using data taken in 2010, LHCb has applied two\nmethods to determine the absolute scale of its luminosity measurements for\nproton-proton collisions at the LHC with a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. In\naddition to the classic \"van der Meer scan\" method a novel technique has been\ndeveloped which makes use of direct imaging of the individual beams using\nbeam-gas and beam-beam interactions. This beam imaging method is made possible\nby the high resolution of the LHCb vertex detector and the close proximity of\nthe detector to the beams, and allows beam parameters such as positions, angles\nand widths to be determined. The results of the two methods have comparable\nprecision and are in good agreement. Combining the two methods, an overall\nprecision of 3.5% in the absolute luminosity determination is reached. The\ntechniques used to transport the absolute luminosity calibration to the full\n2010 data-taking period are presented.\n","Comment: 48 pages, 19 figures.

But with the considerable debate toward the project's\nabilities, we re-introduce the system after a thorough testing of repeatability\nof colors and reproducibility of the ages and metallicities for six common\ngalaxies in the three A779 data sets. A fair agreement has been found between\nthe modified Str\\\"omgren and Str\\\"omgren filter systems to produce similar\ncolors (with the precision of 0.09 mag in (uz-vz), 0.02 mag in (bz-yz), and\n0.03 mag in (vz-vz)), ages and metallicities (with the uncertainty of 0.36 Gyr\nand 0.04 dex from the PCA and 0.44 Gyr and 0.2 dex using the GALEV models). We\ninfer that the technique is able to relieve the age-metallicity degeneracy by\nseparating the age effects from the metallicity effects, but still unable to\ncompletely break. We further extend this paper to re-study the evolution of\ngalaxies in the low mass, dynamically poor A779 cluster by correlating the\nluminosity (mass), density, radial distance with the estimated age,\nmetallicity, and the star formation history. Our results distinctly show the\nbimodality of the young, low-mass, metal-poor population with the mean age of\n6.7 Gyr (\\pm 0.5 Gyr) and the old, high-mass, metal-rich galaxies with the mean\nage of 9 Gyr (\\pm 0.5 Gyr). The method also observes the color evolution of the\nblue cluster galaxies to red, and the downsizing phenomenon. Our analysis shows\nthat the modified Str\\\"omgren photometry is very well suited for studying low-\nand intermediate-z clusters, as it is capable of observing deeper with better\nspatial resolution at spectroscopic redshift limits, and the narrowband filters\nestimate the age and metallicity with lesser uncertainties compared to other\nmethods that study stellar population scenarios.\n","Comment: 46 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables, Accepted"]}]

From a user's perspective, an ideal\namplifier has very low noise, operates over a broad frequency range, and has a\nhigh dynamic range - it is capable of handling strong signals with little\ndistortion. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain all of these\ncharacteristics simultaneously. For example, modern transistor amplifiers offer\nmulti-octave bandwidths and excellent dynamic range. However, their noise\nremains far above the fundamental limit set by the uncertainty principle of\nquantum mechanics. Parametric amplifiers, which predate transistor amplifiers\nand are widely used in optics, exploit a nonlinear response to transfer power\nfrom a strong pump tone to a weak signal. If the nonlinearity is purely\nreactive, ie. nondissipative, in theory the amplifier noise can reach the\nquantum-mechanical limit. Indeed, microwave frequency superconducting Josephson\nparametric amplifiers do approach the quantum limit, but generally are narrow\nband and have very limited dynamic range. In this paper, we describe a\nsuperconducting parametric amplifier that overcomes these limitations. The\namplifier is very simple, consisting only of a patterned metal film on a\ndielectric substrate, and relies on the nonlinear kinetic inductance of a\nsuperconducting transmission line. We measure gain extending over 2 GHz on\neither side of an 11.56 GHz pump tone, and we place an upper limit on the added\nnoise of the amplifier of 3.4 photons at 9.4 GHz. Furthermore, the dynamic\nrange is very large, comparable to microwave transistor amplifiers, and the\nconcept can be applied throughout the microwave, millimeter-wave and\nsubmillimeter-wave bands.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 4 figures + supplementary information"]}]
