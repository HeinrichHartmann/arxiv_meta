Trying to obtain a\nmore accurate value of the gravitomagnetic field inside and outside the sphere,\nseries expansions for this field are presented in this paper. The calculated\npolar gravitomagnetic field of the sphere and that from the ideal dipole model\nappear to coincide, but the field in the vicinity of the sphere may deviate.\nThe deduced field within the sphere strongly deviates from the ideal dipole\nresult. As an illustration, the gravitomagnetic precession rate (or\nframe-dragging effect) of a gyroscope moving in the gravitomagnetic field from\na large rotating sphere is calculated. For the Gravity Probe B experiment the\nresult may coincide with the prediction from the ideal dipole model and in fair\nagreement with observations.

For both experiments alternative predictions are calculated, when\nthe gravitomagnetic field and the magnetic field from moving charge are\nequivalent. Theoretical and observational indications for such an equivalence\nare summarized. The obtained series expansions for the gravitomagnetic field of\na sphere can also be applied to the calculation of the magnetic field,\ngenerated by a rotating sphere with a homogeneous charge density.

Theoretical calculations have shown that when solar prominences move\naway from the surface of the Sun, their radiative output is affected via the\nDoppler dimming or brightening effects. Aims. In this paper we ask whether\nobservational signatures of the changes in the radiative output of eruptive\nprominences can be found in EUV (extreme ultraviolet) observations of the first\nresonance line of ionised helium at 304 {\\AA}. We also investigate whether\nthese observations can be used to perform a diagnostic of the plasma of the\neruptive prominence. Methods. We first look for suitable events in the SDO/AIA\ndatabase. The variation of intensity of arbitrarily selected features in the\n304 channel is studied as a function of velocity in the plane of the sky. These\nresults are then compared with new non-LTE radiative transfer calculations of\nthe intensity of the He II 304 resonance line. Results. We find that\nobservations of intensities in various parts of the four eruptive prominences\nstudied here are sometimes consistent with the Doppler dimming effect on the He\nII 304 {\\AA} line. However, in some cases, one observes an increase in\nintensity in the 304 channel with velocity, in contradiction to what is\nexpected from the Doppler dimming effect alone. The use of the non-LTE models\nallows us to explain the different behaviour of the intensity by changes in the\nplasma parameters inside the prominence, in particular the column mass of the\nplasma and its temperature. Conclusions. The non-LTE models used here are more\nrealistic than what was used in previous calculations. They are able to\nreproduce qualitatively the range of observations from SDO/AIA analysed in this\nstudy.

Effectively, the authors demand from the start that\nreality must be decided by mathematics, and not by measurements. If this\nunjustified assumption is dropped, the quantum formalism has a natural\nstatistical interpretation that fully explains the paradox presented by the\nauthors. It is therefore possible to conclude that the paradox actually\nsupports the statistical interpretation, demonstrating once more that quantum\nmechanics should not be explained by measurement independent realities that are\nnever observed and therefore lie beyond the reach of empirical tests.\n","Comment: 3 pages, comment on arXiv:1111.3328.

Such patterns, characterized by the concentration of criminal\nactivity in localized spatial regions, are referred to as hot-spot patterns and\nthey occur in a parameter regime far from the Turing point associated with the\nbifurcation of spatially uniform solutions. Singular perturbation techniques\nare used to construct steady-state hot-spot patterns in one and two-dimensional\nspatial domains, and new types of nonlocal eigenvalue problems are derived that\ndetermine the stability of these hot-spot patterns to ${\\mathcal O}(1)$\ntime-scale instabilities.

RBO is a simple and efficient broadcast scheduling of $n =\n2^k$ uniform frames for battery powered radio receivers. Each frame contains a\nkey from some arbitrary linearly ordered universe. The broadcast cycle -- a\nsequence of frames sorted by the keys and permuted by $k$-bit reversal -- is\ntransmitted in a round robin fashion by the broadcaster. At arbitrary time\nduring the transmission, the receiver may start a simple protocol that reports\nto him all the frames with the keys that are contained in a specified interval\nof the key values $[K', K\"]$. RBO receives at most $2 k + 1$ other frames' keys\nbefore receiving the first key from $[K', K\"]$ or noticing that there are no\nsuch keys in the broadcast cycle.

Similarly we define\nsemi-flat generalized complex structures on real n-torus bundles with section\nover an n-dimensional base and establish a similar bijective correspondence\nbetween semi-flat generalized complex structures on pair of dual torus bundles.\nAlong the way, we give methods of constructing generalized complex structures\non the total spaces of vector bundles and torus bundles with sections. We also\nshow that semi-flat generalized complex structures give rise to a pair of\ntransverse Dirac structures on the base manifold. We give interpretations of\nthese results in terms of relationships between the cohomology of torus bundles\nand their duals. We also study the ways in which our results generalize some\nwell established aspects of mirror symmetry as well as some recent proposals\nrelating generalized complex geometry to string theory.\n","Comment: Small additions, references added"]}]

Correspondingly, reference frame dependence and gauge\ndependence are inherited to most of the elements of the usual formulation of\nquantum mechanics (including operators, states and events). If a frame\ndependent and gauge dependent formalism is called, in short, a relative\nformalism, then the aim of the paper is to establish an absolute, i.e., frame\nand gauge free, reformulation of quantum mechanics. To fulfil this aim, we\ndevelop absolute quantities and the corresponding equations instead of the wave\nfunction and the Schr\\\"odinger equation. The absolute quantities have a more\ndirect physical interpretation than the wave function has, and the\ncorresponding equations express explicitly the independent physical aspects of\nthe system which are contained in the Schr\\\"odinger equation in a mixed and\nmore hidden form. Based on the absolute quantities and equations, events,\nstates and physical quantities are introduced also in an absolute way. The\nformalism makes it possible to obtain some sharper versions of the uncertainty\nrelation and to extend the validity of Ehrenfest's theorem. The absolute\nformulation allows wide extensions of quantum mechanics. To give examples, we\ndiscuss two known nonlinear extensions and, in close detail, a dissipative\nsystem. An argument is provided that the absolute formalism may lead to an\nexplanation of the Aharonov-Bohm effect purely in terms of the electromagnetic\nfield strength tensor. At last, on special relativistic and curved spacetimes,\nabsolute quantities and equations instead of the Klein-Gordon wave function and\nequation are given, and their nonrelativistic limit is derived.\n","Comment: Changes: Several small improvements in the text, altered title. 35\n  pages, LaTeX"]}]
