They arise from the difference between the Dirac operator and the\nRarita-Schwinger operators. These operators are called remaining operators.\nThey are based on the Dirac operator and projection operators $I-P_k.$ The\nfundamental solutions of these operators are harmonic polynomials, homogeneous\nof degree $k$. First we study the remaining operators and their representation\ntheory in Euclidean space. Second, we can extend the remaining operators in\nEuclidean space to the sphere under the Cayley transformation.\n","Comment: 20 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1102.1205"]}]

The angular variation of the laser-assisted differential cross\nsection (DCS) for atomic hydrogen by electronic impact is presented at various\nkinetic energies for the incident electron. The use of Darwin wave function as\na semirelativistic state to represent the atomic hydrogen gives interesting\nresults when the condition $z/c\\ll1$ is fulfilled. A comparison with the non\nrelativistic theory and experimental data gives good agreement. It was observed\nthat beyond (2700 $eV$) which represents the limit between the two approaches,\nthe non relativistic theory does not yield close agreement with our theory and\nthat, over certain ranges of energy, it can be in error by several orders of\nmagnitude. The sum rule given by Bunkin and Fedorov and by Kroll and Watson\n\\cite{22} has been verified in both nonrelativistic and relativistic regimes.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 10 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:1211.0483; and text overlap with arXiv:physics/9911033 by other authors\n  without attribution"]}]
