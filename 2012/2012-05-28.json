At the core of the BP message updates, when\napplied to a graphical model with pairwise interactions, lies a matrix-vector\nproduct with complexity that is quadratic in the state dimension $d$, and\nrequires transmission of a $(d-1)$-dimensional vector of real numbers\n(messages) to its neighbors. Since various applications involve very large\nstate dimensions, such computation and communication complexities can be\nprohibitively complex. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity variant of\nBP, referred to as stochastic belief propagation (SBP). As suggested by the\nname, it is an adaptively randomized version of the BP message updates in which\neach node passes randomly chosen information to each of its neighbors. The SBP\nmessage updates reduce the computational complexity (per iteration) from\nquadratic to linear in $d$, without assuming any particular structure of the\npotentials, and also reduce the communication complexity significantly,\nrequiring only $\\log{d}$ bits transmission per edge. Moreover, we establish a\nnumber of theoretical guarantees for the performance of SBP, showing that it\nconverges almost surely to the BP fixed point for any tree-structured graph,\nand for graphs with cycles satisfying a contractivity condition. In addition,\nfor these graphical models, we provide non-asymptotic upper bounds on the\nconvergence rate, showing that the $\\ell_{\\infty}$ norm of the error vector\ndecays no slower than $O(1/\\sqrt{t})$ with the number of iterations $t$ on\ntrees and the mean square error decays as $O(1/t)$ for general graphs.

Next, we model the revenues per user using a\nlogistic function, a standard model for growth in competition. This allows us\nto bracket the valuation of Zynga using three different scenarios: 3.4, 4.0 and\n4.8 billion USD in the base case, high growth and extreme growth scenario\nrespectively. This suggests that Zynga has been overpriced ever since its IPO.\nFinally, we propose an investment strategy (dated April 19th, 2012 on the\narXive), which is based on our diagnostic of a bubble for Zynga and how this\nherding / bubbly sentiment can be expected to play together with two important\ncoming events (the quarterly financial result announcement around April 26th,\n2012 followed by the end of a first lock-up period around April 30th, 2012). On\nthe long term, our analysis indicates that Zynga's price should decrease\nsignificantly. The paper ends with a post-mortem analysis added on May 24th,\n2012, just before going to press, showing that we have successfully predicted\nthe downward trend of Zynga. Since April 27th, 2012, Zynga dropped 25%.\n"]}]

The covariate takes\nvalues in $L^2[0,1]$, the Hilbert space of the square-integrable real-valued\nfunctions on the unit interval. The error term could be directly observed as a\nresponse or \\emph{estimated} from a functional parametric model, like for\ninstance the functional linear regression. Our test is based on the remark that\nchecking the no-effect of the functional covariate is equivalent to checking\nthe nullity of the conditional expectation of the error term given a\nsufficiently rich set of projections of the covariate. Such projections could\nbe on elements of norm 1 from finite-dimension subspaces of $L^2[0,1]$. Next,\nthe idea is to search a finite-dimension element of norm 1 that is, in some\nsense, the least favorable for the null hypothesis. Finally, it remains to\nperform a nonparametric check of the nullity of the conditional expectation of\nthe error term given the scalar product between the covariate and the selected\nleast favorable direction. For such finite-dimension search and nonparametric\ncheck we use a kernel-based approach. As a result, our test statistic is a\nquadratic form based on univariate kernel smoothing and the asymptotic critical\nvalues are given by the standard normal law. The test is able to detect\nnonparametric alternatives, including the polynomial ones. The error term could\npresent heteroscedasticity of unknown form. We do no require the law of the\ncovariate $X$ to be known. The test could be implemented quite easily and\nperforms well in simulations and real data applications.
