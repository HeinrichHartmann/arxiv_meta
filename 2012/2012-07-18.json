They heat the neutron star\nenvelope such that the burning of accreted hydrogen and helium becomes stable,\nand the common shorter X-ray bursts are quenched. Short bursts reappear only\nafter the envelope cools down. We study multi-zone one-dimensional models of\nthe neutron star envelope, in which we follow carbon burning during the\nsuperburst, and we include hydrogen and helium burning in the atmosphere above.\nWe investigate both the case of a solar composition and a helium-rich\natmosphere. This allows us to study for the first time a wide variety of\nthermonuclear burning behavior as well as the transitions between the different\nregimes in a self-consistent manner. For solar composition, burst quenching\nends much sooner than previously expected. This is because of the complex\ninterplay between the 3-alpha, hot CNO, and CNO breakout reactions. Stable\nburning of hydrogen and helium transitions via marginally stable burning (mHz\nQPOs) to less energetic bursts with short recurrence times. We find a\nshort-lived bursting mode where weaker and stronger bursts alternate.\nEventually the bursting behavior changes back to that of the pre-superburst\nbursts. Because of the scarcity of observations, this transition has not been\ndirectly detected after a superburst.

In this\nshort review we argue that the recently proposed class of conformal Gaiotto\nmodels may also be embedded in F-theory. The F-theory constructions help us not\nonly to understand the Gaiotto dualities but also to extend to the\nnon-conformal cases with and without cascading behaviors. For the conformal\ncases, the near horizon geometries in F-theory capture both the UV and IR\nbehaviors succinctly.\n","Comment: 6 pages, LaTeX, Based on the talk given by K.

An analysis of three DAs is performed, where\nprevious studies came to conflicting conclusions as to the stars' nitrogen\nconfigurations. The nitrogen abundances were found to be in keeping with DAs of\nhigher Teff, with a homogeneous distribution. A search for circumstellar gas\ndiscs was performed on eight stars, where circumstellar pollution may explain\nthe differences between predicted and observed metal abundances. No positive\ndetections were made. Already the subject of previous studies, the\ncircumstellar absorption features seen at many hot DAs were again analysed,\nusing a more advanced technique than those implemented in previous studies.\nThis allowed, for the first time, column density measurements for all\nnon-photospheric absorbing material. The derived column density measurements\nare consistent with those predicted to exist in white dwarf Stromgren Spheres,\nand the velocities of the absorbing material are not far from the velocities of\neither the observed ISM or predicted LISM clouds along the stars' sight lines.\nHowever, given the distances to some of the stars, it is unlikely that the\nionised material resides in the LISM in all cases; it may however be loosely\nrelated to it. The observations here could not conclusively rule out the\nionisation of circumstellar material about the stars, though no evidence for\nsuch material has yet been found. The velocity of the circumstellar material at\nWD2218+706 is inconsistent with the expansion velocity of the PN at the star,\nimplying that the circumstellar material does not reside in the PN, though it\nmay have originated there. Once though to be related to these circumstellar\nfeatures, mass loss at the DAs has been ruled out, since the high log g of\nthese stars prohibits the loss of significant mass in a stellar wind.\n","Comment: PhD thesis, University of Leicester, 2012"]}]

This constant must ideally be chosen at every iteration as small as\npossible, while serving in an indispensable upper bound for the value of the\nobjective function. In the previously existing variants of optimal first-order\nmethods, this upper bound inequality was constructed from points computed\nduring the current iteration. It was thus not possible to select the optimal\nvalue for this Lipschitz constant at the beginning of the iteration.\n  In our variant, the upper bound inequality is constructed from points\navailable before the current iteration, offering us the possibility to set the\nLipschitz constant to its optimal value at once. This procedure, even if\nefficient in practice, presents a higher worse-case complexity than standard\noptimal first-order methods. We propose an alternative strategy that retains\nthe practical efficiency of this procedure, while having an optimal worse-case\ncomplexity. We show how our generic scheme can be adapted for smoothing\ntechniques, and perform numerical experiments on large scale eigenvalue\nminimization problems.

Along the way,\nwe study the orthogonal group schemes, which are smooth yet nonreductive, of\nquadratic forms with simple degeneration. Finally, we provide two surprising\napplications: constructing counter-examples to the local-global principle for\nisotropy, with respect to discrete valuations, of quadratic forms over\nsurfaces; and a new proof of the global Torelli theorem for very general cubic\nfourfolds containing a plane.\n","Comment: 26 pages, comments welcome"]}]
