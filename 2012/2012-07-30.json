(See also [Kn99] and [Kn08].)\nThe main goal of this paper is to build on this work by finding more effective\nformulas. More explicitly, given a generic component of the moment map, they\ndefine a canonical class $\\alpha_p$ in the equivariant cohomology of the\nmanifold $M$ for each fixed point $p \\in M$. When they exist, canonical classes\nform a natural basis of the equivariant cohomology of $M$. In particular, when\n$M$ is a flag variety, these classes are the equivariant Schubert classes. It\nis a long standing problem in combinatorics to find positive integral formulas\nfor the equivariant structure constants associated to this basis. Since\ncomputing the restriction of the canonical classes to the fixed points\ndetermines these structure constants, it is important to find effective\nformulas for these restrictions. In this paper, we introduce new techniques for\ncalculating the restrictions of a canonical class $\\alpha_p$ to a fixed point\n$q$. Our formulas are nearly always simpler, in the sense that they count the\ncontributions over fewer paths. Moreover, our formula is manifestly positive\nand integral in certain important special cases.\n","Comment: v2; Significant revision. 52 pages, 1 figure.

The band powers presented here cover\nangular scales 2000 < ell < 9400 in frequency bands centered at 95, 150, and\n220 GHz. At these frequencies and angular scales, a combination of the primary\nCMB anisotropy, thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effects, radio\ngalaxies, and cosmic infrared background (CIB) contributes to the signal. We\ncombine Planck and SPT data at 220 GHz to constrain the amplitude and shape of\nthe CIB power spectrum and find strong evidence for non-linear clustering. We\nexplore the SZ results using a variety of cosmological models for the CMB and\nCIB anisotropies and find them to be robust with one exception: allowing for\nspatial correlations between the thermal SZ effect and CIB significantly\ndegrades the SZ constraints. Neglecting this potential correlation, we find the\nthermal SZ power at 150 GHz and ell = 3000 to be 3.65 +/- 0.69 muK^2, and set\nan upper limit on the kinetic SZ power to be less than 2.8 muK^2 at 95%\nconfidence. When a correlation between the thermal SZ and CIB is allowed, we\nconstrain a linear combination of thermal and kinetic SZ power: D_{3000}^{tSZ}\n+ 0.5 D_{3000}^{kSZ} = 4.60 +/- 0.63 muK^2, consistent with earlier\nmeasurements. We use the measured thermal SZ power and an analytic, thermal SZ\nmodel calibrated with simulations to determine sigma8 = 0.807 +/- 0.016.\nModeling uncertainties involving the astrophysics of the intracluster medium\nrather than the statistical uncertainty in the measured band powers are the\ndominant source of uncertainty on sigma8 . We also place an upper limit on the\nkinetic SZ power produced by patchy reionization; a companion paper uses these\nlimits to constrain the reionization history of the Universe.\n","Comment: 25 pages; 14 figures; Submitted to ApJ (Updated to reflect referee\n  comments)"]}]

The thermal fluctuations of the\nelectromagnetic field give rise to a drag force on an atom provided one allows\nfor dissipation of the field energy via spontaneous emission. The drag force\nexists if the atomic polarizability has a nonvanishing imaginary part. Here, we\nexplore alternative derivations. The damping of the motion of a simple harmonic\noscillator is described by radiative reaction theory (result of Einstein and\nHopf), taking into account the known stochastic fluctuations of the\nelectromagnetic field. Describing the excitations of the atom as an ensemble of\ndamped harmonic oscillators, we identify the previously found expressions as\ngeneralizations of the Einstein-Hopf result. In addition, we present a simple\nexplanation for blackbody friction in terms of a Doppler shift of the thermal\nradiation in the inertial frame of the moving atom: The atom absorbs\nblue-shifted photons from the front and radiates off energy in all directions,\nthereby losing energy. The original plus the two alternative derivations\nprovide for additional confirmation of an intriguing physical effect, and leave\nno doubt regarding its existence.\n","Comment: 5 pages"]}]

Compared to the decoder based on the randomly constructed\nLDPCCC code, the complexity of the proposed LDPCCC decoder is reduced due to\nthe periodicity of the derived LDPCCC and the properties of the quasi-cyclic\nstructure. In our proposed decoder architecture, $\\Gamma$ (a multiple of a\nwarp) codewords are decoded together and hence the messages of $\\Gamma$\ncodewords are also processed together. Since all the $\\Gamma$ codewords share\nthe same Tanner graph, messages of the $\\Gamma$ distinct codewords\ncorresponding to the same edge can be grouped into one package and stored\nlinearly. By optimizing the data structures of the messages used in the\ndecoding process, both the read and write processes can be performed in a\nhighly parallel manner by the GPUs. In addition, a thread hierarchy minimizing\nthe divergence of the threads is deployed, and it can maximize the efficiency\nof the parallel execution. With the use of a large number of cores in the GPU\nto perform the simple computations simultaneously, our GPU-based LDPC decoder\ncan obtain hundreds of times speedup compared with a serial CPU-based simulator\nand over 40 times speedup compared with an 8-thread CPU-based simulator.\n","Comment: 9 figures"]}]

An important issue is to understand\nvarious differences in the physical properties of the spacetime across the\nbounce. We investigate this issue in the context of various geometrical\nstructures, identified by Kasner exponents of the metric, which arise on\napproach to the singularity in the classical theory. Using effective spacetime\ndescription of Bianchi-I model in loop quantum cosmology with dust, radiation\nand stiff matter, we find that as in the classical theory, geometrical\nstructures such as a cigar or a pancake form, but they are finite and\nnon-singular. Depending on the initial conditions of matter and anisotropies,\ndifferent geometric structures are possible in the pre- and post-bounce phases\nin physical evolution. Thus, quantum gravitational effects can cause a Kasner\ntransition in Bianchi-I spacetime, which is not possible at the classical\nlevel. Interestingly, we find that not all transitions are allowed at the level\nof effective dynamics in loop quantum cosmology. We find the selection rules\nand underlying conditions for all allowed and forbidden transitions. Selection\nrules suggest that for a given set of initial conditions on anisotropies,\noccurrence of Kasner transitions follows a distinct pattern, and certain\ntransitions are more favored than others.\n","Comment: Four figures added on Kasner transitions.

The same is true if\nnone of the receivers possess CSIR. This paper shows that an entirely new\nscenario emerges when receivers have unequal CSIR.

Two signaling schemes are constructed\nbased on the multiplicative superposition.

This method works better than orthogonal transmission while\nreception at each receiver is still interference free.

To utilize spectrum resources efficiently, an auction scheme is often\napplied where an operator serves as an auctioneer and accepts spectrum requests\nfrom SUs. Most existing works on spectrum auctions assume that the operator has\nperfect knowledge of PU activities. In practice, however, it is more likely\nthat the operator only has statistical information of the PU traffic when it is\ntrading a spectrum hole, and it is acquiring more accurate information in real\ntime. In this paper, we distinguish PU channels that are under the control of\nthe operator, where accurate channel states are revealed in real-time, and\nchannels that the operator acquires from PUs out of its control, where a\nsense-before-use paradigm has to be followed. Considering both spectrum\nuncertainty and sensing inaccuracy, we study the social welfare maximization\nproblem for serving SUs with various levels of delay tolerance. We first model\nthe problem as a finite horizon Markov decision process when the operator knows\nall spectrum requests in advance, and propose an optimal dynamic programming\nbased algorithm.

Since the usual statistical models for radio signals in a\npropagation environment do not lend themselves easily to a description of the\navailable service rate on a wireless link, the performance analysis of wireless\nnetworks has resorted to higher-layer abstractions, e.g., using Markov chain\nmodels. In this work, we propose a network calculus that can incorporate common\nstatistical models of fading channels and obtain statistical bounds on delay\nand backlog across multiple nodes. We conduct the analysis in a transfer\ndomain, which we refer to as the `SNR domain', where the service process at a\nlink is characterized by the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio at the\nreceiver. We discover that, in the transfer domain, the network model is\ngoverned by a dioid algebra, which we refer to as (min,x)-algebra. Using this\nalgebra we derive the desired delay and backlog bounds. An application of the\nanalysis is demonstrated for a simple multi-hop network with Rayleigh fading\nchannels and for a network with cross traffic.\n","Comment: 26 pages"]}]

In two dimensions, three Minkowski\nfunctionals characterise the morphology of an object, they are: its perimeter\n(L), area (S), and genus. Out of L and S a single dimensionless Shapefinder\nStatistic, F can be constructed (0 <=F <=1). F acquires extreme values on a\ncircle (F = 0) and a filament (F = 1).

Our results unambiguously demonstrate that the LCRS displays a high\ndegree of filamentarity both in the Northern and Southern galactic sections a\nresult that is in general agreement with the visual appearance of the\ncatalogue. It is well known that gravitational clustering from Gaussian initial\nconditions gives rise to the development of non-Gaussianity reflected in the\nformation of a network-like filamentary structure on supercluster scales.\nConsequently the fact that the smoothed LCRS catalogue shows properties\nconsistent with those of a Gaussian random field (Colley 1997) whereas the\nunsmoothed catalogue demonstrates the presence of filamentarity lends strong\nsupport to the conjecture that the large scale clustering of galaxies is driven\nby gravitational instability.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]
