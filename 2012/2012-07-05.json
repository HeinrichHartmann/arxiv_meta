Detection of pair echoes\nis possible as long as the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) in voids is\nweak.

The traditional approach to defining a local\nhardness index, by the derivative of the chemical potential with respect to the\nelectron density subject to the constraint of a fixed external potential, has\nraised several questions, and its chemical applicability has proved to be\nlimited. Here, we point out that the only actual possibility to obtain a local\nhardness measure in the traditional approach emerges if the external potential\nconstraint is dropped; consequently, utilizing the ambiguity of a restricted\nchemical potential derivative is not an option to gain alternative definitions\nof local hardness. At the same time, however, the arising local hardness\nconcept turns out to be fatally undermined by its inherent connection with the\nasymptotic value of the second derivative of the universal density functional.\nThe only other local hardness concept one may deduce from the traditional\ndefinition is the one that gives a constant value, the global hardness itself,\nthroughout an electron system in its ground state. Consequently, the\ntraditional approach is in principle incapable of delivering a local hardness\nindicator. The parallel case of defining a local version of the chemical\npotential itself is also outlined, arriving at a similar conclusion. Namely,\nthe only local chemical potential concept that can be gained from a definition\ndE[n]/dn(r)|v is the one that gives a constant, mu itself, for electron systems\nin their ground state.\n","Comment: 29 pages, to appear in Theor.

Post bounce, after a phase\nof super-inflation, dynamical trajectories evolve towards the classical\nattractor in the inflationary scenarios. Depending on the initial conditions,\nbounce is shown to occur in kinetic as well as potential dominated regimes. We\nanalyze the number of e-foldings resulting from the phase of super-inflation,\nand find the dependence of the maximum possible number of e-foldings on the\nequation of state at the bounce and on the steepness of the potential. We find\nthat if the potential is not steep, this phase can lead to large number of\ne-foldings in power-law inflation. For the assisted inflation scenario, an\nincrease in the number of fields can yield a significant increase in the number\nof e-foldings during super-inflation.\n","Comment: Discussion expanded, references added.

Such games are a commonly used model in many formal methods, as they\nmake the interaction of a system with its environment explicit. Often, a\nwinning strategy for one of the players is used as a certificate or as an\nartefact for further processing in the application. Small such certificates,\ni.e., strategies that can be written down very compactly, are typically\npreferred. For safety games, we only need to consider positional strategies.\nThese map game positions of a player onto a move that is to be taken by the\nplayer whenever the play enters that position. For representing positional\nstrategies compactly, a common goal is to minimize the number of positions for\nwhich a winning player's move needs to be defined such that the game is still\nwon by the same player, without visiting a position with an undefined next\nmove. We call winning strategies in which the next move is defined for few of\nthe player's positions sparse.\n  Unfortunately, even roughly approximating the density of the sparsest\nstrategy for a safety game has been shown to be NP-hard. Thus, to obtain sparse\nstrategies in practice, one either has to apply some heuristics, or use some\nexhaustive search technique, like ILP (integer linear programming) solving. In\nthis paper, we perform a comparative study of currently available methods to\nobtain sparse winning strategies for the safety player in safety games.

Consequently, the transient information of\nmolecules in each particular cell contains significant noise. The DSMC method\nuses the transient values of molecular variables to compute the cell's\nvariables (including number density, flow velocity and temperature) and so the\nstochastic noise in its cell's variables is remarkable particularly in the case\nof low velocity. In the DSBGK simulation, the increments rather than the\ntransient information of molecular variables are used to update the cell's\nvariables based on the mass, momentum and energy conservation principles of\nintermolecular collision process. This updating scheme significantly reduces\nthe noise in cell's variables of DSBGK simulations because the molecular\nvariables are updated smoothly by the extrapolation of acceptance-rejection\nscheme and so their increments contain low noise.

The\nelectron nematicity has been recently observed in the iron-pnictide and cuprate\nhigh-temperature superconductors. Whether such a tendency of electrons to\nself-organise unidirectionally has a common feature in these superconductors\nis, however, a highly controversial issue. In the cuprates, the nematicity has\nbeen suggested as a possible source of the pseudogap phase, whilst in the\niron-pnictides, it has been commonly associated with the\ntetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural phase transition at $T_s$. Here, we\nprovide the first thermodynamic evidence in BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 that the nematicity\ndevelops well above the structural transition and persists to the nonmagnetic\nsuperconducting regime, resulting in a new phase diagram strikingly similar to\nthe pseudogap phase diagram in the cuprates. Our highly sensitive magnetic\nanisotropy measurements using microcantilever torque-magnetometry under\nin-plane field rotation reveal pronounced two-fold oscillations, which break\nthe tetragonal symmetry. Combined with complementary high-resolution\nsynchrotron X-ray and resistivity measurements, our results consistently\nidentify two distinct temperatures - one at $T^{\\ast}$, signifying a true\nnematic transition, and the other at $T_s (< T^{\\ast})$, which we show to be\nnot a true phase transition, but rather what we refer to as a \"meta-nematic\ntransition\", in analogy to the well-known metamagnetic transition in the theory\nof magnetism.
