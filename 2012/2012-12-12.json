If there is no dominant type,\nthere is an unstable 'mixed' fixed point; the population state eventually\noscillates between the three near-pure states.

In\nthis case, the existence of a dominant type renders a point near its pure state\nglobally attracting. If no dominant type exists, a supercritical Hopf\nbifurcation occurs at the unique mixed fixed point, and above a critical\n(typically low) mutation rate, this fixed point becomes globally attracting:\nthe implication is that even very low mutation rates can stabilize a system\nthat would, in the absence of mutations, be unstable.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 6 figures"]}]

Here we use these properties to realize giant\nconductance oscillations in ballistic trilayer graphene Fabry-Perot\ninterferometers, which result from phase coherent transport through resonant\nbound states beneath an electrostatic barrier. We cloak these states by\nselectively decoupling them from the leads, resulting in transport via\nnon-resonant states and suppression of the giant oscillations. Cloaking is\nachieved both classically, by manipulating quasiparticle momenta with a\nmagnetic field, and quantum mechanically, by locally varying the pseudospin\ncharacter of the carrier wavefunctions.

The paper analyzes this\nframework, by focusing in particular on \"minimal\" tree projections, that is, on\ntree projections without useless redundancies. First, it is shown that minimal\ntree projections enjoy a number of properties that are usually required for\nnormal form decompositions in various structural decomposition methods. In\nparticular, they enjoy the same kind of connection properties as (minimal) tree\ndecompositions of graphs, with the result being tight in the light of the\nnegative answer that is provided to the open question about whether they enjoy\na slightly stronger notion of connection property, defined to speed-up the\ncomputation of hypertree decompositions.

Previous attempts to estimate\nthis travel time have assumed that the probe's motion is simple, moving at a\nconstant maximum velocity, with powered flight producing the necessary change\nin velocity required at each star to complete its chosen trajectory. This\napproach ignores lessons learned from interplanetary exploration, where orbital\nslingshot maneouvres can provide significant velocity boosts at little to no\nfuel cost. It is plausible that any attempt to explore the Galaxy would utilise\nsuch economising techniques, despite there being an upper limit to these\nvelocity boosts, related to the escape velocity of the object being used to\nprovide the slingshot.\n  In order to investigate the effects of these techniques, we present multiple\nrealisations of single probes exploring a small patch of the Milky Way. We\ninvestigate 3 separate scenarios, studying the slingshot effect on trajectories\ndefined by simple heuristics. These scenarios are: i) standard powered flight\nto the nearest unvisited star without using slingshot techniques; ii) flight to\nthe nearest unvisited star using slingshot techniques, and iii) flight to the\nnext unvisited star which provides the maximal velocity boost under a slingshot\ntrajectory.\n  We find that adding slingshot velocity boosts can decrease the travel time by\nup to two orders of magnitude over simple powered flight. In the third case,\nselecting a route which maximises velocity boosts also reduces the travel time\nrelative to powered flight, but by a much reduced factor.

State space methods for dependability analysis\nmay suffer of the state space explosion problem in such a kind of situation.\nCombinatorial models, on the other hand, require the simplified assumption of\nstatistical independence; however, in case of redundant systems, this does not\nguarantee a reduced number of modeled elements. In order to provide a more\ncompact system representation, parametric system modeling has been investigated\nin the literature, in such a way that a set of replicas of a given subsystem is\nparameterized so that only one representative instance is explicitly included.\nWhile modeling aspects can be suitably addressed by these approaches,\nanalytical tools working on parametric characterizations are often more\ndifficult to be defined and the standard approach is to 'unfold' the parametric\nmodel, in order to exploit standard analysis algorithms working at the unfolded\n'ground' level.

Specifically, given a co-occurrence matrix of\ntwo variables, one often seeks a compact representation of one variable which\npreserves information about the other variable. We have recently introduced\n``Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction' [GT-2003], a method that extracts\ncontinuous reduced dimensional features whose measurements (i.e., expectation\nvalues) capture maximal mutual information among the variables. However, such\nmeasurements often capture information that is irrelevant for a given task.\nWidely known examples are illumination conditions, which are irrelevant as\nfeatures for face recognition, writing style which is irrelevant as a feature\nfor content classification, and intonation which is irrelevant as a feature for\nspeech recognition. Such irrelevance cannot be deduced apriori, since it\ndepends on the details of the task, and is thus inherently ill defined in the\npurely unsupervised case. Separating relevant from irrelevant features can be\nachieved using additional side data that contains such irrelevant structures.\nThis approach was taken in [CT-2002], extending the information bottleneck\nmethod, which uses clustering to compress the data. Here we use this\nside-information framework to identify features whose measurements are\nmaximally informative for the original data set, but carry as little\ninformation as possible on a side data set. In statistical terms this can be\nunderstood as extracting statistics which are maximally sufficient for the\noriginal dataset, while simultaneously maximally ancillary for the side\ndataset. We formulate this tradeoff as a constrained optimization problem and\ncharacterize its solutions. We then derive a gradient descent algorithm for\nthis problem, which is based on the Generalized Iterative Scaling method for\nfinding maximum entropy distributions.

However, some\nself-directed lymphocytes may evade selection and still be harmless due to a\nmechanism called clonal anergy. As for B lymphocytes, two major explanations\nfor anergy developed over three decades: according to \"Varela theory\", it stems\nfrom a proper orchestration of the whole B-repertoire, in such a way that\nself-reactive clones, due to intensive interactions and feed-back from other\nclones, display more inertia to mount a response. On the other hand, according\nto the `two-signal model\", which has prevailed nowadays, self-reacting cells\nare not stimulated by helper lymphocytes and the absence of such signaling\nyields anergy. The first result we present, achieved through disordered\nstatistical mechanics, shows that helper cells do not prompt the activation and\nproliferation of a certain sub-group of B cells, which turn out to be just\nthose broadly interacting, hence it merges the two approaches as a whole (in\nparticular, Varela theory is then contained into the two-signal model). As a\nsecond result, we outline a minimal topological architecture for the B-world,\nwhere highly connected clones are self-directed as a natural consequence of an\nontogenetic learning; this provides a mathematical framework to Varela\nperspective.

Assuming the users learn their direct and interfering\nchannels perfectly, they can feed back this information to the base stations\n(BSs) over the uplink channels. The BSs then use the channel information to\ndesign their transmission scheme. Two types of feedback are considered: analog\nand digital. In the analog feedback case, the users send their unquantized and\nuncoded CSI over the uplink channels. In this context, given a user's fixed\ntransmit power, we investigate how he/she should optimally allocate it to feed\nback the direct and interfering (or cross) CSI for two types of base station\ncooperation schemes, namely, Multi-Cell Processing (MCP) and Coordinated\nBeamforming (CBf). In the digital feedback case, the direct and cross link\nchannel vectors of each user are quantized separately, each using RVQ, with\ndifferent size codebooks. The users then send the index of the quantization\nvector in the corresponding codebook to the BSs. Similar to the feedback\noptimization problem in the analog feedback, we investigate the optimal bit\npartitioning for the direct and interfering link for both types of cooperation.\nWe focus on regularized channel inversion precoding structures and perform our\nanalysis in the large system limit in which the number of users per cell ($K$)\nand the number of antennas per BS ($N$) tend to infinity with their ratio\n$\\beta=\\frac{K}{N}$ held fixed.\n"]}]

This theorem builds\non an earlier method of hers which was implemented by Albano and Collino to\nprove the same result for a general cubic sevenfold. In fact, Voisin's method\ncan be utilized precisely because the variation of Hodge structure on a cubic\n7-fold behaves just like the variation of Hodge structure of a Calabi-Yau\n3-fold. We explain this relationship concretely using Kontsevitch's\nnoncommutative geometry. Namely, we show that for a cubic 7-fold, there is a\nnoncommutative CY 3-fold which has an isomorphic Griffiths group.\n  Similarly, one can consider other examples of Fano manifolds with with the\nsame type of variation of Hodge structure as a Calabi-Yau threefold (FCYs).\nAmong the complete intersections in weighted projective spaces, there are only\nthree classes of smooth FCY manifolds; the cubic 7-fold, the fivefold quartic\ndouble solid, and the fivefold intersection of a quadric and a cubic. We settle\nthe two remaining cases, following Voisin's method to demonstrate that the\nGriffiths group for a smooth general complete intersection FCY manifolds, is\nalso infinitely generated.\n  In the case of the fivefold quartic double solid, we also show that there is\na noncommutative CY 3-fold with an isomorphic Griffiths group. Finally, for the\nfivefold intersection of a quadric and a cubic there is a noncommutative CY\n3-fold, such that the Griffiths group of the intersection surjects on to the\nGriffiths group of noncommutative 3-fold. We finish by discussing some examples\nof noncommutative covers which relate our noncommutative CYs back to honest\nalgebraic varieties such as products of elliptic curves and K3-surfaces.\n","Comment: 40 pages"]}]
