The field is\nprepared in the Bunch-Davies vacuum state and is constrained to satisfy Robin\nboundary conditions on the sphere. Both the interior and exterior regions are\nconsidered. For the calculation in the interior region, a mode-summation method\nis employed, supplemented with a variant of the generalized Abel-Plana formula.\nThis allows us to explicitly extract the contributions to the expectation\nvalues which come from de Sitter spacetime without boundaries. We show that the\nvacuum energy-momentum tensor is non-diagonal with the off-diagonal component\ncorresponding to the energy flux along the radial direction. With dependence on\nthe boundary condition and the mass of the field, this flux can be either\npositive or negative. Several limiting cases of interest are then studied. In\nterms of the curvature coupling parameter and the mass of the field, two very\ndifferent regimes are realized, which exhibit monotonic and oscillatory\nbehavior of the vacuum expectation values, respectively, far from the sphere.\nThe decay of the boundary induced expectation values at large distances from\nthe sphere is shown to be power-law (monotonic or oscillating), independent of\nthe value of the field mass.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 4 figures, new paragraph about generalizations, discussion\n  and references added, accepted for publication in Phys.

A variety of computational heuristics, some\nwith a long history, have been proposed for the identification of communities\nor, alternatively, of good graph partitions. In most cases, the algorithms\nmaximize a particular objective function, thereby finding the `right' split\ninto communities. Although a thorough comparison of algorithms is still\nlacking, there has been an effort to design benchmarks, i.e., random graph\nmodels with known community structure against which algorithms can be\nevaluated. However, popular community detection methods and benchmarks normally\nassume an implicit notion of community based on clique-like subgraphs, a form\nof community structure that is not always characteristic of real networks.\nSpecifically, networks that emerge from geometric constraints can have natural\nnon clique-like substructures with large effective diameters, which can be\ninterpreted as long-range communities. In this work, we show that long-range\ncommunities escape detection by popular methods, which are blinded by a\nrestricted `field-of-view' limit, an intrinsic upper scale on the communities\nthey can detect. The field-of-view limit means that long-range communities tend\nto be overpartitioned. We show how by adopting a dynamical perspective towards\ncommunity detection (Delvenne et al.

Consequently, the performance of\nalgorithms on inherently low-diameter, clique-like benchmarks may not always be\nindicative of equally good results in real networks with local, sparser\nconnectivity.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 6 figures"]}]

We\nperform the first fully self-consistent Braginskii-MHD simulations of galaxy\nclusters including both of these effects. Specifically, we perform local and\nglobal simulations of the magnetothermal instability (MTI) and the\nheat-flux-driven buoyancy instability (HBI) and assess the effects of viscosity\non their saturation and astrophysical implications. We find that viscosity has\nonly a modest effect on the saturation of the MTI.

At smaller radii in cool-core clusters, viscosity\ncan decrease the linear growth rates of the HBI. However, it has less of an\neffect on the HBI's nonlinear saturation, in part because three-dimensional\ninterchange motions (magnetic flux tubes slipping past each other) are not\ndamped by anisotropic viscosity. In global simulations of cool core clusters,\nwe show that the HBI robustly inhibits radial thermal conduction and thus\nprecipitates a cooling catastrophe.

We argue that viscosity can contribute\nto the global transition of cluster cores from cool-core to non cool-core\nstates: additional sources of intracluster turbulence, such as can be produced\nby AGN feedback or galactic wakes, suppress the HBI, heating the cluster core\nby thermal conduction; this makes the ICM more viscous, which slows the growth\nof the HBI, allowing further conductive heating of the cluster core and a\ntransition to a non cool-core state.\n","Comment: Submitted to MNRAS.

We\nuse the new proof to show inapproximability for the basic $k$-spanner problem,\nwhich is both the simplest problem in graph spanners and one of the few for\nwhich super-logarithmic hardness was not known. Assuming $NP \\not\\subseteq\nBPTIME(2^{polylog(n)})$, we show that for every $k \\geq 3$ and every constant\n$\\epsilon > 0$ it is hard to approximate the basic $k$-spanner problem within a\nfactor better than $2^{(\\log^{1-\\epsilon} n) / k}$ (for large enough $n$). A\nsimilar hardness for basic $k$-spanner was claimed by Elkin and Peleg [ICALP\n2000], but the error in their analysis of Label Cover made this proof fail as\nwell. Thus for the problem of Label Cover with large girth we give the first\nnon-trivial lower bound. For the basic $k$-spanner problem we improve the\nprevious best lower bound of $\\Omega(\\log n)/k$ by Kortsarz [Algorithmica\n1998]. Our main technique is subsampling the edges of 2-query PCPs, which\nallows us to reduce the degree of a PCP to be essentially equal to the\nsoundness desired. This turns out to be enough to essentially guarantee large\ngirth.\n","Comment: 16 pages, revised to add a reference"]}]

In this article,\nI will address fundamental aspects of this algorithmic-statistical disconnect,\nwith an eye to bridging the gap between these two very different approaches. A\nconcept that lies at the heart of this disconnect is that of statistical\nregularization, a notion that has to do with how robust is the output of an\nalgorithm to the noise properties of the input data. Although it is nearly\ncompletely absent from computer science, which historically has taken the input\ndata as given and modeled algorithms discretely, regularization in one form or\nanother is central to nearly every application domain that applies algorithms\nto noisy data. By using several case studies, I will illustrate, both\ntheoretically and empirically, the nonobvious fact that approximate\ncomputation, in and of itself, can implicitly lead to statistical\nregularization. This and other recent work suggests that, by exploiting in a\nmore principled way the statistical properties implicit in worst-case\nalgorithms, one can in many cases satisfy the bicriteria of having algorithms\nthat are scalable to very large-scale databases and that also have good\ninferential or predictive properties.\n","Comment: To appear in the Proceedings of the 2012 ACM Symposium on Principles\n  of Database Systems (PODS 2012)"]}]

This Poisson noise creates a\nsignificant contamination of the resulting ellipticity PDF so that the shape of\nthe original PDF is almost washed-out. Nevertheless, there is a way to overcome\nthe Poisson noise via the Alcock Paczynski test on the shape of stacked voids.\nIn redshift space, since the void is elongated toward the line of sight, the\nstacked void has non-zero ellipticity, which can be a tell-tale of the\nlogarithmic growth rate. Although some useful information of void ellipticity\nwill be lost by stacking, in this way, we can see the effect of redshift space\ndistortion as a source of anisotropy in the stacked void ellipticity. We think\nthat the stacking analysis of the voids in redshift space is potentially a\npowerful tool to probe the cosmology.\n","Comment: 40 pages, 14 figures"]}]
