The fraction of centrals that are\nred does not depend on their environment but only on their stellar masses,\nwhereas that of the satellites depends on both. We define a relative satellite\nquenching efficiency, which is the fraction of blue centrals that are quenched\nupon becoming the satellite of another galaxy. This is shown to be independent\nof stellar mass, but to depend strongly on local overdensity. The red fraction\nof satellites correlate much better with the local overdensity, a measure of\nlocation within the group, than with the richness of the group, i.e. dark\nmatter halo mass. This, and the fact that satellite quenching depends on local\ndensity and not on either the stellar mass of the galaxy or the halo mass gives\nclues as to the nature of the satellite-quenching process. We furthermore show\nthat the action of mass-quenching on satellite galaxies is also independent of\nthe DM mass of the parent halo. We then apply the Peng et al (2010) approach to\npredict the mass functions of central and satellite galaxies, split into\npassive and active galaxies, and show that these match very well the observed\nmass functions from SDSS, further strengthening the validity of this\nphenomenological approach.

While\nnew in the behavioral context, both this test and the Joint Distribution\nCriterion on which it is based have been previously proposed in quantum\nphysics, in dealing with generalizations of Bell inequalities for the quantum\nentanglement problem. The parallels between this problem and that of selective\ninfluences in behavioral sciences is established by observing that noncommuting\nmeasurements in quantum physics are mutually exclusive and can therefore be\ntreated as different levels of one and the same factor.\n","Comment: 12 pages; in the second version some typos were corrected; minor\n  revision in the third version; typos corrected in the fourth version. arXiv\n  admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1108.3074"]}]

The notion has been recently extended\nto the identity-based setting by Bellare et al. (Eurocrypt'12). We provide one\nmore step in this direction, by considering the notion of hierarchical\nidentity-based (lossy) trapdoor functions (HIB-TDFs). Hierarchical\nidentity-based cryptography has proved very useful both for practical\napplications and to establish theoretical relations with other cryptographic\nprimitives.\n  The notion of security for IB-TDFs put forward by Bellare et al. easily\nextends to the hierarchical scenario, but an (H)IB-TDF secure in this sense is\nnot known to generically imply other related primitives with security against\nadaptive-id adversaries, not even IND-ID-CPA secure encryption. Our first\ncontribution is to define a new security property for (H)IB-TDFs. We show that\nfunctions satisfying this property imply secure cryptographic primitives in the\nadaptive identity-based setting: these include encryption schemes with semantic\nsecurity under chosen-plaintext attacks, deterministic encryption schemes, and\n(non-adaptive) hedged encryption schemes that maintain some security when\nmessages are encrypted using randomness of poor quality.\n  Then, we describe the first pairing-based HIB-TDF realization.

We reduce\nthe noise of the observations as much as is feasible by adding single-slit\nmeasurements of the Zeeman-sensitive Fe I 630 nm lines taken by the Hinode\nspectropolarimeter. The integrated Stokes spectra are employed to determine the\nfraction of the field of view covered by linear polarization signals. We find\nthat up to 69% of the quiet solar surface at disk center shows Stokes Q or U\nprofiles with amplitudes larger than 0.032% (4.5 times the noise level of 7 x\n10^{-5} reached by the longer integrations). The mere presence of linear\npolarization in most of the quiet Sun implies that the weak internetwork fields\nmust be highly inclined, but we quantify this by inverting those pixels with\nStokes Q or U signals well above the noise. This allows for a precise\ndetermination of the field inclination, field strength, and field azimuth\nbecause the information carried by all four Stokes spectra is used\nsimultaneously. The inversion is performed for 53% of the observed field of\nview at a noise level of 1.3 x 10^{-4}. The derived magnetic distributions are\nthus representative of more than half of the quiet Sun internetwork. Our\nresults confirm the conclusions drawn from previous analyses using mainly\nStokes I and V: internetwork fields are very inclined, but except in azimuth\nthey do not seem to be isotropically distributed.\n"]}]

In 2009, the monitoring program was\nupgraded to allow for additional targeted measurements of atmospheric\nconditions shortly after the detection of air showers of special interest,\ne.g., showers produced by very high-energy cosmic rays or showers with atypical\nlongitudinal profiles. The former events are of particular importance for the\ndetermination of the energy scale of the Observatory, and the latter are\ncharacteristic of unusual air shower physics or exotic primary particle types.\nThe purpose of targeted (or \"rapid\") monitoring is to improve the resolution of\nthe atmospheric measurements for such events. In this paper, we report on the\nimplementation of the rapid monitoring program and its current status. The\nrapid monitoring data have been analyzed and applied to the reconstruction of\nair showers of high interest, and indicate that the air fluorescence\nmeasurements affected by clouds and aerosols are effectively corrected using\nmeasurements from the regular atmospheric monitoring program. We find that the\nrapid monitoring program has potential for supporting dedicated physics\nanalyses beyond the standard event reconstruction.\n"]}]

In AQFT, one\nassigns to open regions in Minkowski space a C*-algebra, called the local\nalgebra. The local algebras are patched together to form a global algebra\nassociated to the AQFT. The key relativistic assumption is Einstein Causality,\nwhich says that the algebras associated to spacelike separated regions commute\nin the global algebra. Premonoidal categories provide a natural framework for\nlifting such structure from algebras to categories. Thus von Neumann categories\nserve as a basis for extending the abstract quantum mechanics of Abramsky and\nCoecke to include relativistic effects.\n  In this paper, we focus on the structure of von Neumann categories.

This system has two exactly solvable\nlimits, the harmonic oscillator and a particle in a (one-dimensional) box. Each\nof the two limits has a characteristic spectral structure describing the two\ndifferent excitation modes of the system. Near each of these limits, one can\nuse perturbation theory to achieve an accurate description of the eigenstates.\nAway from the exact limits, however, one has to carry out a matrix\ndiagonalization because the basis-state mixing that occurs is typically too\nlarge to be reproduced in any other way. An alternative to casting the problem\nin terms of one or the other basis set consists of using an \"oblique\" basis\nthat uses both sets. Through a study of this alternative in this\none-dimensional problem, we are able to illustrate practical solutions and\ninfer the applicability of the concept for more complex systems, such as in the\nstudy of complex nuclei where oblique-basis calculations have been successful.\nKeywords: one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, particle in a box, exactly\nsolvable models, two-mode system, oblique basis states, perturbation theory,\ncoherent states, adiabatic mixing.\n","Comment: 11 pages and 9 figures; Submitted to American Journal of Physics"]}]
