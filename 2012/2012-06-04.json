The exact diagonalization of the\nspinless AB$_2$ chain is presented in the limiting cases of infinite or zero\nnearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion for any filling. Without interactions, the\nAB$_2$ chain has a flat band even in the presence of magnetic flux. We show\nthat the respective localized states can be written in the most compact form as\nstanding waves in one or two consecutive plaquettes. We show that this result\nis easily generalized to other frustrated lattices such as the Lieb lattice. A\nrestricted Hartree-Fock study of the $V/t$ versus filling phase diagram of the\nAB$_2$ chain has also been carried out.

The ground-state energy as a function of filling and interaction $V$\nis determined using the mean-field approach and exactly for infinite or zero\n$V$.

We find an IA signal consistent with zero, placing tight\nconstraints on both the magnitude of the IA effect and its potential\ncontamination to the lensing signal. While these constraints depend on source\nselection and redshift quality, the method can be applied to any measurement\nthat uses photometric redshifts. We obtain a model-independent upper-limit of\nroughly 10% IA contamination for projected separations of approximately 0.1-100\nMpc/h.

On the other\nhand, the second class of modes is due mainly to the dark-matter fluid. In the\nsmall dark-matter mass fraction limit, these modes are characterized purely by\nthe oscillations of dark matter, while the normal matter is essentially at\nrest. In the intermediate regime where the mass fractions of the two fluids are\ncomparable, the normal matter oscillates with the dark matter due to their\ncoupling through gravity.

However, many probabilistic retrieval models\nrely on fixing one representation and optimizing the other (e.g. fixing the\nsingle information need and tuning the document) but not both. Therefore, it is\ndifficult to use the available related information on both the document and the\nquery at the same time in calculating the probability of relevance. In this\npaper, we address the problem by hypothesizing the relevance as a logical\nrelationship between the two sets of properties; the relationship is defined on\ntwo separate mappings between these properties. By using the hypothesis we\ndevelop a unified probabilistic relevance model which is capable of using all\nthe available information. We validate the proposed theory by formulating and\ndeveloping probabilistic relevance ranking functions for both ad-hoc text\nretrieval and collaborative filtering. Our derivation in text retrieval\nillustrates the use of the theory in the situation where no relevance\ninformation is available. In collaborative filtering, we show that the\nresulting recommender model unifies the user and item information into a\nrelevance ranking function without applying any dimensionality reduction\ntechniques or computing explicit similarity between two different users (or\nitems), in contrast to the state-of-the-art recommender models.\n"]}]

Doing so\ncorresponds to studying the model in its {\\it quantum gravity} form. In the\ncase of percolation, the appropriate choice of random lattice matches with the\nso-called planar maps. b/ Then it remains to get back to the actual {\\it\nEuclidean} setup.
