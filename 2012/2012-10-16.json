In particular, the number of EPs occurring in a\nbare discrete Hamiltonian of dimension $n_\\textrm{D}$ is given by $n_\\textrm{D}\n(n_\\textrm{D} - 1)$; if this discrete Hamiltonian is then coupled to continuum\n(or continua) to form an OQS, the interaction with the continuum generally\nproduces an enlarged discrete solution space that includes a greater number of\nEPs, specifically $2^{n_\\textrm{C}} (n_\\textrm{C} + n_\\textrm{D})\n[2^{n_\\textrm{C}} (n_\\textrm{C} + n_\\textrm{D}) - 1] $, in which $n_\\textrm{C}$\nis the number of (non-degenerate) continua to which the discrete sector is\nattached. Finally, we offer a heuristic quantum phase transition analogy for\nthe emergence of the resonance (giving rise to irreversibility via exponential\ndecay) in which the decay width plays the role of the order parameter; the\nassociated critical exponent is then determined by the above eigenvalue\nexpansion.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 7 figures"]}]

In particular, we develop a nonperturbative\ntheory of weak PPS measurements of an arbitrary system with an arbitrary meter,\nfor arbitrary initial states. New and simple analytical formulas are obtained\nfor the average and the distribution of the meter pointer variable, which hold\nto all orders in the weak value. In the case of a mixed preselected state, in\naddition to the standard weak value, an associated weak value is required to\ndescribe weak PPS measurements. In the linear regime, the theory provides the\ngeneralized Aharonov-Albert-Vaidman formula. Moreover, we reveal two new\nregimes of weak PPS measurements: the strongly-nonlinear regime and the\ninverted region, where the system-dependent contribution to the pointer\ndeflection decreases with increasing the measurement strength. The optimal\nconditions for weak PPS measurements are achieved in the strongly-nonlinear\nregime, where the magnitude of the average pointer deflection is equal or close\nto the maximum. This maximum is independent of the measurement strength, being\ntypically of the order of the pointer uncertainty. We show that the\namplification in the weak PPS measurements is a product of two qualitatively\ndifferent quantities: proper amplification and enhancement. The effects of the\nfree system and meter Hamiltonians are discussed. We also identify optimal\nmeters for weak measurements. Exact solutions are obtained for a certain class\nof the measured observables. These solutions are used for numerical\ncalculations, the results of which agree with the theory.

In this work we offer\nnew insights into the problem by focusing on two types of observational probes:\nSNeIa and GRBs. Our results allow to highlight some of the intrinsic weaknesses\nof the method. One of the directions we follow is to consider updated\nobservational samples. Our results indicate than conclusions on the main dark\nenergy features as drawn from this method are intimately related to the\nfeatures of the samples themselves (which are not quite ideal). This is\nparticularly true of GRBs, which manifest themselves as poor performers in this\ncontext. In contrast to original works, we conclude they cannot be used for\ncosmological purposes, and the state of the art does not allow to regard them\non the same quality basis as SNeIa. The next direction we contribute to is the\nquestion of how the adjusting of some parameters (window width, overlap,\nselection criteria) affect the results.

It is found that\nthe energy extraction operates, and hence a relativistic jet is launched,\npreferentially when the accretion disk consists of an outer Shakura-Sunyaev\ndisk (SSD) and an inner advection-dominated accretion flow. When the entire\naccretion disk type changes into an SSD, the jet is quenched because the\nplasmas brings more rest-mass energy than what is extracted from the hole\nelectromagnetically to stop the extraction.

However, in spite of its great potential and research\nhistory over many decades, these systems are not commonly used. One of the main\nproblems is that existing methods use diffusive jets, which result in scattered\npenetration and severe deceleration of the jets, causing frequent pain and\ninsufficient penetration. Another longstanding challenge is the development of\naccurate small volume injections. In this paper we employ a novel method of\nneedle-free drug injection, using highly-focused high speed microjets, which\naims to solve these challenges. We experimentally demonstrate that these unique\njets are able to penetrate human skin: the focused nature of these microjets\ncreates an injection spot smaller than a mosquito's proboscis and guarantees a\nhigh percentage of the liquid being injected. The liquid substances can be\ndelivered to a much larger depth than conventional methods, and create a\nwell-controlled dispersion pattern. Thanks to the excellent controllability of\nthe microjet, small volume injections become feasible. Furthermore, the\npenetration dynamics is studied through experiments performed on gelatin\nmixtures (human soft tissue equivalent) and human skin, agreeing well with a\nviscous stress model which we develop. This model predicts the depth of the\npenetration into both human skin and soft tissue. The results presented here\ntake needle-free injections a step closer to widespread use.\n"]}]

In this article, we estimate whether it is possible to\nmeasure the radial velocity of WDs astrometrically by the exchange of proper\nmotion into radial velocity during the 5-year mission of the satellite or by\ncombining Hipparcos data with the position measurements at the beginning of the\nGaia mission (the Hundred-Thousand-Proper-Motion project HTPM).\n","Comment: 4 pages, Proceedings of the 18th European White Dwarf Workshop,\n  Krakow, ASP Conference Series (ASPC)"]}]

These calculations are motivated by observations of polars;\ncataclysmic variables containing white dwarfs with magnetic fields sufficiently\nstrong to prevent the formation of an accretion disk. So an accretion stream\nflows from the L1 point and impacts directly onto one or more spots on the\nsurface of the white dwarf. Observations indicate that the white dwarf, in some\nbinaries, possesses a complex (non-dipolar) magnetic field. We perform\nsimulations of 10 polars or equivalently one asynchronous polar at 10 different\nbeat phases. Our models have an aligned dipole plus quadrupole magnetic field\ncentered on the white dwarf primary. We find that for a sufficiently strong\nquadrupole component an accretion spot occurs near the magnetic equator for\nslightly less than half of our simulations while a polar accretion zone is\nactive for most of the rest of the simulations. For one or two configurations;\naccretion at the dominant polar region and at an equatorial zone occurs\nsimultaneously. These are the first 3D MHD calculations to confirm the\nexistence of complex magnetic fields in magnetic CVs. We conclude, that it\nmight be difficult observationally determine if the field is a pure dipole or\nif it is complex for polars, but there will be indications for some systems.\nSpecifically, a complex magnetic field should be considered if the there is an\naccretion zone near the white dwarf's spin equator (orbital plane) or if there\nare two or more accretion regions that cannot be fit by a dipole magnetic\nfield. For asynchronous polars, magnetic field constraints are expected to be\nsubstantially stronger, with clearer indicators of complex field geometry due\nto changes in accretion flow structure as a function of spin-orbit beat phase.\n"]}]

We\npresent here a fluid dynamics video showing experimental results and CFD\nsimulations for droplet break-up at low Weber number where the droplet is\ngenerated with negative momentum. Such droplet generation is characterized by\nthe droplet breaking up and then returning back into the nozzle. This is due to\nthe fact that during the droplet formation the surface tension begins to slow\ndown the flow velocity inside the droplet and then finally inverts the flow\ndirection, while the droplet tail still breaks off from the nozzle. Thus after\nthe break up the droplet momentum is oriented toward the nozzle. It is\ntherefore possible to observe the droplet returning into the bulk fluid.\nHigh-speed images of this particular phenomenon are shown and simulation\nresults are presented to illustrate the break up dynamics and the local\nvelocities in the droplet.\n","Comment: 3 pages, fluid dynamics video (HD, LD), APS-DFD 2012"]}]

Extension springs with a nominal\ndiameter of 0.24 inches and with a wire diameter of 0.018 inches were used. At\nsmall extensions, liquid can be injected into the spring from one side. The\ninjected free-ended liquid columns are stable. Volume-constrained stability can\nbe studied after injecting from both sides until coalescence. Stable states\nexist between lower and upper volume stability limits. The low volume\ninstability is manifested by the growth of a neck that eventually breaks. The\nbreakage sends a wave front; the interface ahead of the front is static while\nthe interface behind the front undergoes oscillations. These oscillations\neventually dampen as the free-ends retract until equilibrium states are\nreached. The upper volume instability causes the interface to blow out creating\na large drop that remains connected to the liquid column supported by the\nspring. After a critical pitch, injection is no longer possible from one end.\nHowever, a liquid column established by injection can be stretched beyond the\ncritical pitch for injection. Beyond this pitch, after breakup and blowout the\ninterface undergoes a pearling instability. The resulting free ends retract and\ngrow into drops from which the liquid column eventually breaks. This pearling\ninstability propagates throughout the entire length of the structure largely\nemptying it.

Water occupies a volume of\n$25\\times 25\\times 10$cm$^3$. By using a stirring-spoon, the stagnant water is\nforced to rotate at a rate of $2\\pi$/sec. Once all the points in the water is\nrotating, it will be drained from a ball valve, with a diameter of 5mm, from\nthe bottom of the tank and the acquisition starts. The formation of the vortex\nis captured with a resolution of $352\\times 824$ pixels at 200 frames per\nseconds (fps) and is exported at 5fps and with a resolution of $1280\\times 720$\nin a \"fluid dynamics video\".

In particular, rather than assuming that\nproprioception or efference copies form the key source of information for\ncomputing eye position information, I use a biological plausible implementation\nof a Kalman filter to optimally combine the two signals, and a simple gain\ncontrol mechanism in order to accommodate the latency of the proprioceptive\nsignal.

Yet, not a single spintronic\ndevice exists today that can lend credence to this claim. Here, I show that no\nspintronic device that clones conventional electronic devices, such as field\neffect transistors and bipolar junction transistors, is likely to reduce power\ndissipation significantly. For that to happen, spin-based devices must forsake\nthe transistor paradigm of switching states by physical movement of charges,\nand instead, switch states by flipping spins of stationary charges. An\nembodiment of this approach is the single spin logic idea proposed more than 10\nyears ago. Here, I revisit that idea and present estimates of the switching\nspeed and power dissipation. I show that the Single Spin Switch is far superior\nto the Spin Field Effect Transistor (or any of its clones) in terms of power\ndissipation. I also introduce the notion of matrix element engineering which\nwill allow one to switch devices without raising and lowering energy barriers\nbetween logic states, thereby circumventing the kTln2 limit on energy\ndissipation. Finally, I briefly discuss single spin implementations of\nclassical reversible (adiabatic) logic.\n","Comment: To appear in Journal of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology"]}]
