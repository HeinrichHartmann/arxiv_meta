In molecular dynamics simulations, the traditional way\nof constructing work distributions is to perform as many pulling simulations as\npossible. But reliable work distributions are not always produced in a finite\nnumber of simulations. The computational cost of using JE is not less than\nother commonly used methods such as Thermodynamic Integration and Umbrella\nSampling methods. Here we first show a different proof of JE based on the idea\nof step-wise pulling procedures that is efficient in computing free energies by\nusing JE. The key point in our proof is that the processes of turning-on/off a\nharmonic potential to perform work are described by double Heaviside functions\nof time. We then show that the distributions of work performed by the potential\ncan be easily generated from the distributions of a reaction coordinate along a\npathway. Based on the proof, we propose sequential and parallel step-wise\npulling protocols for generating work distributions that require suitable\nrelaxation time at each pulling step. The criterion for reliable work\ndistributions is that there must be sufficient mutual overlaps between the\nadjacent distributions of the reaction coordinate along the pathway. We arrive\nat an alternative formula (besides JE) to compute free energy differences from\nthe averaged values of the reaction coordinate. The combination of JE and the\nalternative formula provides a viable way to determine the accuracy of computed\nfree energy differences. For the stretching of a deca-alanine molecule, our\napproach requires 21 parallel simulations and relaxation time as small as 0.4\nns for each simulation to estimate free energy differences with an uncertainty\nof about 13%.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 6 figures, 3 appendices"]}]

Motivated mainly by this idea, in this work, we consider a\nq-deformed Fermi gas model whose statistical properties enable effectively us\nto study interpolating statistics. Starting with a generalized Fermi-Dirac\ndistribution function, we derive several thermostatistical functions of a gas\nof these deformed fermions in the thermodynamical limit. We study the high\ntemperature behavior of the system by analyzing the effects of q-deformation on\nthe most important thermostatistical characteristics of the system such as the\nentropy, specific heat, and equation of state. It is shown that such a deformed\nfermion model in two and three spatial dimensions exhibits the interpolating\nstatistics in a specific interval of the model deformation parameter 0 < q < 1.\nIn particular, for two and three spatial dimensions, it is found from the\nbehavior of the third virial coefficient of the model that the deformation\nparameter q interpolates completely between attractive and repulsive systems,\nincluding the free boson and fermion cases. From the results obtained in this\nwork, we conclude that such a model could provide much physical insight into\nsome interacting theories of fermions, and could be useful to further study the\nparticle systems with intermediate statistics.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 7 figures"]}]

Phys. J. Special Topics in May 2012. We summarize and put in\nperspective the contributions into three main themes: (i) mechanisms for\ndragon-kings, (ii) detection of dragon-kings and statistical tests and (iii)\nempirical evidence in a large variety of natural and social systems. Overall,\nwe are pleased to witness significant advances both in the introduction and\nclarification of underlying mechanisms and in the development of novel\nefficient tests that demonstrate clear evidence for the presence of\ndragon-kings in many systems. However, this positive view should be balanced by\nthe fact that this remains a very delicate and difficult field, if only due to\nthe scarcity of data as well as the extraordinary important implications with\nrespect to hazard assessment, risk control and predictability.\n","Comment: 20 pages"]}]

Those with ages between 30 and 130 Myr are of interest\nbecause their evolution has progressed well beyond that of protoplanetary disks\n(which dissipate with a timescale of order 3 Myr), yet they represent a period\nwhen dynamical models suggest that terrestrial planet building may still be\nprogressing through large, violent collisions that could yield large amounts of\ndebris and large infrared excesses. For example, our Moon was formed through a\nviolent collision of two large proto-planets during this age range. We report\ntwo disks around the solar-like stars ID8 and HD 23514 in this age range where\nthe 24 {\\mu}m infrared excesses vary on timescales of a few years, even though\nthe stars are not variable in the optical. Variations this rapid are difficult\nto understand if the debris is produced by collisional cascades, as it is for\nmost debris disks. It is possible that the debris in these two systems arises\nin part from condensates from silicate-rich vapor produced in a series of\nviolent collisions among relatively large bodies.

As in our\nprevious work reported by Dull et al., we find that a central black hole is not\nneeded. Using local mass-function data from HST studies, we have also inferred\nthe global initial stellar mass function. As a consequence of extreme mass\nsegregation, the local mass functions differs from the global mass function at\nevery location. In addition to reproducing the observed mass functions, the\nmodels also provide good fits to the star-count and velocity-dispersion\nprofiles, and to the millisecond pulsar accelerations. We address concerns\nabout the large neutron star populations adopted in our previous Fokker-Planck\nmodels for M15. We find that good model fits can be obtained with as few as\n1600 neutron stars; this corresponds to a retention fraction of 5% of the\ninitial population for our best fit initial mass function.
