However a major uncertainty is the estimate of the orbital\ninclination angle of an X-ray binary. Here we suggest to measure the black hole\nmass in an X-ray binary by measuring directly the black hole's orbital motion,\nthus obtaining the companion to black hole mass ratio. In this method we assume\nthat accretion disk wind moves with the black hole and thus the black hole's\norbital motion can be obtained from the Doppler velocity of the absorption\nlines produced in the accretion disk wind. We validate this method by analyzing\nthe Chandra/HETG observations of GRO J1655-40, in which the black hole orbital\nmotion with line of sight velocity of 90.8 (+-11.3) km/s, inferred from the\nDoppler velocity of disk-wind absorption lines, is consistent with the\nprediction from its previously measured system parameters. We obtain the black\nhole mass of 5.41 (+0.98, -0.57) solar masses and system inclination of 72.0\n(+7.8, -7.5) degrees in GRO J1655-40. Additional observations of this source\ncovering more orbital phases can improve estimates on its system parameters\nsubstantially. We then apply the method to the black hole X-ray binary LMC X-3\nobserved with HST/COS near orbital phase 0.75. We find that the disk-wind\nabsorption lines of CIV doublet were shifted to about 50 km/s, which yields a\ncompanion-to-black-hole mass ratio of 0.6 for an assumed disk wind velocity of\n-400 km/s. Additional observations covering other orbital phases (0.25 in\nparticular) are crucial to ease this assumption and then to directly constrain\nthe mass ratio. This method in principle can also be applied to any accreting\ncompact objects with detectable accretion disk wind absorption line features.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures, 1 table.

To\nstudy the influence of merger processes on the evolution of dust properties and\ncosmic star formation rate, we investigate a local sample of major merger\ngalaxies and a control sample of isolated galaxies using GALEX ultraviolet (UV)\nand Spitzer infrared (IR) images. Through a statistical study, we find that\ndust attenuation in merger galaxies is enhanced with respect to isolated\ngalaxies. We find this enhancement is contributed mainly by spiral galaxies in\nspiral-spiral (S-S) pairs, and increases with the increasing stellar mass of a\ngalaxy. Combining the IR and UV parts of star formation rates (SFRs), we then\ncalculated the total SFRs and specific star formation rates (SSFRs). We find\nthe SSFRs to be enhanced in merger galaxies. This enhancement depends on galaxy\nstellar mass and the companion's morphology, but depends little on whether the\ngalaxy is a primary or secondary component or on the separation between two\ncomponents. These results are consistent with a previous study based only on IR\nimages. In addition, we investigate the nuclear contributions to SFRs. SFRs in\npaired galaxies are more concentrated in the central part of the galaxies than\nin isolate galaxies.
