For this reason it is\ncurrently widely used, in particular for large scale simulations of neural\nnetworks. This model emulates the dynamics of the membrane potential of a\nneuron together with an adaptation variable. The subthreshold dynamics is\ngoverned by a two-parameter differential equation, and a spike is emitted when\nthe membrane potential variable reaches a given cutoff value. Subsequently the\nmembrane potential is reset, and the adaptation variable is added a fixed value\ncalled the spike-triggered adaptation parameter. We show in this note that when\nthe system does not converge to an equilibrium point, both variables of the\nsubthreshold dynamical system blow up in finite time whatever the parameters of\nthe dynamics. The cutoff is therefore essential for the model to be well\ndefined and simulated. The divergence of the adaptation variable makes the\nsystem very sensitive to the cutoff: changing this parameter dramatically\nchanges the spike patterns produced. Furthermore from a computational\nviewpoint, the fact that the adaptation variable blows up and the very sharp\nslope it has when the spike is emitted implies that the time step of the\nnumerical simulation needs to be very small (or adaptive) in order to catch an\naccurate value of the adaptation at the time of the spike. It is not the case\nfor the similar quartic (Touboul 2008) and exponential (Brette and Gerstner\n2005) models whose adaptation variable does not blow up in finite time, and\nwhich are therefore very robust to changes in the cutoff value.\n"]}]

In order to study such large neuronal assemblies,\none is often led to derive mean-field limits summarizing the effect of the\ninteraction of a large number of neurons into an effective signal. Classical\nmean-field approaches consider the evolution of a deterministic variable, the\nmean activity, thus neglecting the stochastic nature of neural behavior. In\nthis article, we build upon two recent approaches that include correlations and\nhigher order moments in mean-field equations, and study how these stochastic\neffects influence the solutions of the mean-field equations, both in the limit\nof an infinite number of neurons and for large yet finite networks.

We show that, though the solutions of the deterministic\nmean-field equation constitute uncorrelated solutions of the new mean-field\nequations, the stability properties of limit cycles are modified by the\npresence of correlations, and additional non-trivial behaviors including\nperiodic orbits appear when there were none in the mean field. The origin of\nall these behaviors is then explored in finite-size networks where interesting\nmesoscopic scale effects appear.

It is desirable for m to be\nsmall, and for Phi to support fast matrix-vector multiplication. In this work,\nwe give a randomized construction of RIP matrices Phi in C^{m x d}, preserving\nthe L_2 norms of all k-sparse vectors with distortion 1+eps, where the\nmatrix-vector multiply Phi x can be computed in nearly linear time. The number\nof rows m is on the order of eps^{-2}klog dlog^2(klog d).

This bound improves the lower bound of Omega(min{eps^{-2},\neps^{-1}sqrt{log_m d}}) by [Dasgupta-Kumar-Sarlos, STOC 2010], which only held\nagainst the stronger property of distributional JL, and only against a certain\nrestricted class of distributions.

Such sketches have seen a wide range of applications including\nnorm estimation over data streams, compressed sensing, and distributed\ncomputing. In almost any realistic setting, however, a linear sketch faces the\npossibility that its inputs are correlated with previous evaluations of the\nsketch. Known techniques no longer guarantee the correctness of the output in\nthe presence of such correlations. We therefore ask: Are linear sketches\ninherently non-robust to adaptively chosen inputs? We give a strong affirmative\nanswer to this question. Specifically, we show that no linear sketch\napproximates the Euclidean norm of its input to within an arbitrary\nmultiplicative approximation factor on a polynomial number of adaptively chosen\ninputs. The result remains true even if the dimension of the sketch is d = n -\no(n) and the sketch is given unbounded computation time. Our result is based on\nan algorithm with running time polynomial in d that adaptively finds a\ndistribution over inputs on which the sketch is incorrect with constant\nprobability.
