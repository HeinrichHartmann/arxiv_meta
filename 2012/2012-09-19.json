In silicon, we find a $\\sim T^{-3}$\ntemperature dependence of the phonon-limited spin relaxation time T$_1$ and a\nvalue of 4.3 ns at room temperature, in agreement with experiments. For the\nphonon-dominated regime in diamond and graphite, we predict a stronger $\\sim\nT^{-5}$ and $\\sim T^{-4.5}$ dependence that limits $T_1$ (300 K) to 180 and 5.8\nns, respectively. A key aspect of this study is that the parameter-free nature\nof our approach provides a method to study the effect of {\\em any} type of\nimpurity or defect on spin-transport. Furthermore we find that the spin-mix\namplitude in silicon does not follow the $E_g^{-2}$ band gap dependence usually\nassigned to III-V semiconductors but follows a much weaker and opposite\n$E_g^{0.67}$ dependence. This dependence should be taken into account when\nconstructing silicon spin transport models.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures. Phys. Rev. Lett., in press"]}]

The end members\nLa$_{2}$CuRuO$_{6}$ and LaSrCuRuO$_{6}$ form in monoclinic structure while the\nintermediate Sr doped compounds stabilise in triclinic structure. The Cu and Ru\nions sit on alternate B-sites of the perovskite lattice with $\\sim$15%\nanti-site defects in the undoped sample while the Sr doped samples show a\ntendency to higher ordering at B-sites. The undoped (x = 0) compound shows a\nferrimagnetic-like behaviour at low temperatures. In surprising contrast to the\nusual expectation of an enhancement of ferromagnetic interaction on doping, an\nantiferromagnetic-like ground state is realized for all doped samples (x $>$\n0). Heat capacity measurements indicate the absence of any long range magnetic\norder in any of these compounds. The magnetic relaxation and memory effects\nobserved in all compounds suggest glassy dynamical properties associated with\nmagnetic disorder and frustration. We show that the observed magnetic\nproperties are dominated by the competition between the nearest neighbour Ru --\nO -- Cu 180$^\\circ$ superexchange interaction and the next nearest neighbour Ru\n-- O -- O -- Ru 90$^\\circ$ superexchange interaction as well as by the\nformation of anti-site defects with interchanged Cu and Ru positions.

The discrepancy in the covering factor is most likely to be the result\nof either quasars being obscured due to dust, or the consequence of many GRBs\nbeing strongly gravitationally lensed. We analyze observations of GRBs that\nshow strong foreground MgII absorption. We Monte-Carlo the distances between\nforeground galaxies in the HUDF and lines of sight distributed randomly within\na radius derived from the covering factor, and find that galaxies are located\nsystematically closer to the position of the observed GRBs than expected for\nrandom lines of sight. This over-density at small impact parameters is\nstatistically more robust than the well known excess of MgII absorbers among\nGRB afterglow spectra, and presents a new puzzle for MgII absorption studies.\nThe over-density cannot be explained by obscuration in the GRB sample, but is a\nnatural consequence of gravitational lensing. Upon examining the particular\nconfigurations of galaxies near a sample of GRBs with strong MgII absorption,\nwe find several intriguing lensing candidates. Our results suggest that lensing\nprovides a viable contribution to the observed enhancement of strong MgII\nabsorption along lines of sight to GRBs, and we outline the future observations\nrequired to test this hypothesis conclusively.\n","Comment: v2 includes major updates in response to referee's comments. 15\n  pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

As an alternative to\nthe background subtraction proposed in BeadStudio which leads to an important\nloss of information by generating negative values, a background correction\nmethod modeling the observed intensities as the sum of the exponentially\ndistributed signal and normally distributed noise has been developed.\nNevertheless, Wang and Ye (2011) display a kernel-based estimator of the signal\ndistribution on Illumina BeadArrays and suggest that a gamma distribution would\nrepresent a better modeling of the signal density. Hence, the\nnormal-exponential modeling may not be appropriate for Illumina data and\nbackground corrections derived from this model may lead to wrong estimation.\nResults: We propose a more flexible modeling based on a gamma distributed\nsignal and a normal distributed background noise and develop the associated\nbackground correction. Our model proves to be markedly more accurate to model\nIllumina BeadArrays: on the one hand, this model offers a more correct fit of\nthe observed intensities. On the other hand, the comparison of the operating\ncharacteristics of several background correction procedures on spike-in and on\nnormal-gamma simulated data shows high similarities, reinforcing the validation\nof the normal-gamma modeling. The performance of the background corrections\nbased on the normal-gamma and normal-exponential models are compared on two\ndilution data sets. Surprisingly, we observe that the implementation of a more\naccurate parametrisation in the model-based background correction does not\nincrease the sensitivity. These results may be explained by the operating\ncharacteristics of the estimators: the normal-gamma background correction\noffers an improvement in terms of bias, but at the cost of a loss in precision.\n"]}]

We test the geometry, energetics, and charge distribution of\nin-plane and out-of-plane binding of CO2 and CH4 to model zigzag graphene\nnanoribbons edge-functionalized with COOH, OH, NH2, H2PO3, NO2, and CH3.\nAlthough different choices for the exchange-correlation functional lead to a\nspread of values for the binding energy, trends across the functional groups\nare largely preserved for each choice, as are the final orientations of the\nadsorbed gas molecules. We find binding of CO2 to exceed that of CH4 by roughly\na factor of two. However, the two gases follow very similar trends with changes\nin the attached functional group, despite different molecular symmetries. Our\nresults indicate that the presence of NH2, H2PO3, NO2, and COOH functional\ngroups can significantly enhance gas binding with respect to a\nhydrogen-passivated edge, making the edges potentially viable binding sites in\nmaterials with high concentrations of edge carbons.

Because $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals are\nstrongly connected with the Fermi surface topology, the nature of magnetic\nexcitations can be modified significantly due to the presence of either static\nor fluctuating orbital correlations. Within a five-orbital itinerant model, we\nshow that static orbital order generally leads to an enhancement of\ncommensurate magnetic excitations even when the original Fermi surface lacks\nnesting at $(\\pi,0)$ or $(0,\\pi)$. When long-range orbital order is absent,\nGaussian fluctuations beyond the standard random-phase approximation (RPA)\ncapture the effects of fluctuating orbital correlations on the magnetic\nexcitations. We find that commensurate magnetic excitations can also be\nenhanced if the orbital correlations are strong. Our results offer a natural\nexplanation for the incommensurate-to-commensurate transformation observed in a\nrecent neutron scattering measurement (Z. Xu, et. al., arXiv:1201.4404), and we\npropose that this unusual transformation is an important signature to\ndistinguish orbital from spin physics in the normal state of the pnictides.\nImplications for the magnetic and superconducting states are discussed.\n","Comment: 7 pagers, 4 figures"]}]

However,\nto process a job's workload until its deadline the scheduler must invest a\ncertain amount of energy. The cost of a schedule is the sum of lost values and\ninvested energy. In order to finish a job the scheduler has to determine which\nprocessors to use and set their speeds accordingly. A processor's energy\nconsumption is power $\\Power{s}$ integrated over time, where\n$\\Power{s}=s^{\\alpha}$ is the power consumption when running at speed $s$.\nSince we consider the online variant of the problem, the scheduler has no\nknowledge about future jobs. This problem was introduced by\n\\textcite{Chan:2010} for the case of a single processor. They presented an\nonline algorithm which is $\\alpha^{\\alpha}+2e\\alpha$-competitive. We provide an\nonline algorithm for the case of multiple processors with an improved\ncompetitive ratio of $\\alpha^{\\alpha}$.\n","Comment: Extended abstract submitted to STACS 2013"]}]

Thus, these conditions ensure that\nthe memory in durations propagates to the same memory parameter in counts and\ntherefore in realized volatility. We then show that any utoregressive\nConditional Duration ACD(1,1) model with a sufficient number of finite moments\nyields short memory in counts, while any Long Memory Stochastic Duration model\nwith $d>0$ and all finite moments yields long memory in counts, with the same\n$d$.\n"]}]
