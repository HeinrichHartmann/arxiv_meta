The intermittent behaviour\nis characterised by a power-law probability density and the corresponding\ncritical exponent is calculated rigorously by making use of the first-passage\nproperties of the amplitude equation. On the other hand, when the noise is\nacting on the whole subspace of stable modes, the multiplicative noise is\ncorrected by an additive-like term, with the eventual loss of any stabilised\nstate. We also show that the stochastic forcing has no effect on the dominant\nmode dynamics when it is acting on the second stable mode.

In general, if\na large non-Gaussian signal exists at the start of reheating, it will remain\nnon zero at the end of reheating. Unless all isocurvature modes have completely\ndecayed before the start of reheating, we find that the non-linearity\nparameter, f_NL, can be sensitive to the reheating timescale, and that this\ndependence is most appreciable for `runaway' inflationary potentials that only\nhave a minimum in one direction. For potentials with a minimum in both\ndirections, f_NL can also be sensitive to reheating if a mild hierarchy exists\nbetween the decay rates of each field. Within the class of models studied, we\nfind that the spectral index n_s, is fairly insensitive to large changes in the\nfield decay rates, indicating that n_s is a more robust inflationary\nobservable, unlike the non-linearity parameter f_NL. Our results imply that the\nstatistics of \\zeta, especially f_NL, can only be reliably used to discriminate\nbetween models of two-field inflation if the physics of reheating are properly\naccounted for.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 8 figures.
