Presently there is no general\ncharacterization of which polytopal digraphs are LP digraphs, although four\nnecessary properties are known: acyclicity, unique sink orientation(USO), the\nHolt-Klee property and the shelling property.

Ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs) typically consist of a white\ndwarf donor and a neutron star or black hole accretor. The evolution of UCXBs\nand very low mass ratio binaries in general is poorly understood. Aims. We\ninvestigate the evolution of UCXBs in order to learn for which mass ratios and\naccretor types these systems can exist, and if they do, what are their orbital\nand neutron star spin periods, mass transfer rates and evolutionary timescales.\nMethods. For different assumptions concerning accretion disk behavior we\ncalculate for which system parameters dynamical instability, thermal-viscous\ndisk instability or the propeller effect emerge. Results. At the onset of mass\ntransfer, the survival of the UCXB is determined by how efficiently the\naccretor can eject matter in the case of a super-Eddington mass transfer rate.\nAt later times, the evolution of systems strongly depends on the binary's\ncapacity to return angular momentum from the disk to the orbit. We find that\nthis feedback mechanism most likely remains effective. In the case of steady\nmass transfer, the propeller effect can stop accretion onto recycled neutron\nstars completely at a sufficiently low mass transfer rate, based on energy\nconsiderations. However, mass transfer will likely be non-steady because disk\ninstability allows for accretion of some of the transferred matter. Together,\nthe propeller effect and disk instability cause the low mass ratio UCXBs to be\nvisible a small fraction of the time at most, thereby explaining the lack of\nobservations of such systems. Conclusions. Most likely UCXBs avoid late-time\ndynamically unstable mass transfer and continue to evolve as the age of the\nUniverse allows. This implies the existence of a large population of low mass\nratio binaries with orbital periods ~ 70 - 80 min, unless some other mechanism\nhas destroyed these binaries.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 13 figures.

Recently the discovery of PSR J1719-1438, a 5.8 ms pulsar with a\ncompanion in a 2.2 hr orbit, was reported. The combination of this orbital\nperiod and the very low mass function is unique. The discoverers, Bailes et\nal., proposed an ultracompact X-ray binary (UCXB) as the progenitor system.\nHowever, the standard UCXB scenario would not produce this system as the time\nrequired to reach this orbital period exceeds the current estimate of the age\nof the Universe. The detached state of the system aggravates the problem. Aims.\nWe want to understand the evolutionary history of PSR J1719-1438, and determine\nunder which circumstances it could have evolved from an UCXB. Methods. We model\nUCXB evolution varying the donor size and investigate the effect of a wind mass\nloss from the donor, and compare the results with the observed characteristics\nof PSR J1719-1438. Results. An UCXB can reach a 2.2 hr orbit within the age of\nthe Universe, provided that 1) the millisecond pulsar can significantly heat\nand expand the donor by pulsar irradiation, or 2) the system loses extra\norbital angular momentum, e.g. via a fast wind from the donor. Conclusions. The\nmost likely scenario for the formation of PSR J1719-1438 is UCXB evolution\ndriven by angular momentum loss via the usual gravitational wave emission,\nwhich is enhanced by angular momentum loss via a donor wind of ~3x10^-13\nMsun/yr. Depending on the size of the donor during the evolution, the companion\npresently probably has a mass of ~1-3 Jupiter masses, making it a very low mass\nwhite dwarf as proposed by Bailes et al. Its composition can be either helium\nor carbon-oxygen. A helium white dwarf companion makes the long (for an UCXB)\norbital period easier to explain, but the required inclination makes it a\npriori less likely than a carbon-oxygen white dwarf.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures.

X-ray binaries are usually divided in persistent and transient\nsources. For ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs), the mass transfer rate is\nexpected to be a strong function of orbital period, predicting persistent\nsources at short periods and transients at long periods. Aims. For 14 UCXBs\nincluding two candidates, we investigate the long-term variability and average\nluminosity with the purpose of learning how often a source can be expected to\nbe visible above a given luminosity, and we compare the derived luminosities\nwith the theoretical predictions. Methods. We use data from the RXTE All-Sky\nMonitor because of its long-term, unbiased observations. Many UCXBs are faint,\ni.e., they have a count rate at the noise level for most of the time. Still,\ninformation can be extracted from the data, either by using only reliable data\npoints or by combining the bright-end variability behavior with the\ntime-averaged luminosity. Results. Luminosity probability distributions show\nthe fraction of time that a source emits above a given luminosity. All UCXBs\nshow significant variability and relatively similar behavior, though the\ntime-averaged luminosity implies higher variability in systems with a period\nlonger than 40 min. Conclusions. There is no large difference in the\nstatistical luminosity behavior of what we usually call persistent and\ntransient sources. UCXBs with a period below ~30 min have a time-averaged\nbolometric luminosity that is in reasonable agreement with estimates based on\nthe theoretical mass transfer rate. Around 40 min the lower bound on the\ntime-averaged luminosity is similar to the luminosity based on the theoretical\nmass transfer rate, suggesting these sources are indeed faint when not\ndetected. Above 50 min some systems are much brighter than the theoretical mass\ntransfer rate predicts, unless these systems have helium burning donors or lose\nadditional angular momentum.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables.

Once a measurement has been made, observables are subject to the\nlaws of special relativity, and the process of measurement introduces a\npreferred frame. The speed of light can take on different values, both\nsuperluminal and subluminal (with respect to the usual value of the speed of\nlight), without the need for Lorentz-invariance violating operators and without\ntachyons.

The amorphous version studied here differs from the one reported earlier\n[PRB 46, 10917 (1992)] in that it has a much lower carrier concentration. As a\nmeasure of the static disorder we use the dimensionless parameter kFl. Thermal\nannealing is employed as the experimental handle to tune the disorder.

However, in contrast with the results obtained on the\nelectron-rich version of this system, no sign of superconductivity is seen down\nto ~0.3K even for the most metallic sample used in the current study. This\ndemonstrates that using kFl as a disorder parameter for the\nsuperconductor-insulator-transition (SIT) is an ill defined procedure.

During a computational episode,\nactivations are spreading from input neurons through the SLIM NN until the\ncomputation activates a special halt neuron. Weights of the NN's used\nconnections define its program. Halting programs form a prefix code. The reset\nof the initial NN state does not cost more than the latest program execution.\nSince prefixes of SLIM programs influence their suffixes (weight changes\noccurring early in an episode influence which weights are considered later),\nSLIM NN learning algorithms (LAs) should execute weight changes online during\nactivation spreading. This can be achieved by applying AOPS to growing SLIM\nNNs. To efficiently teach a SLIM NN to solve many tasks, such as correctly\nclassifying many different patterns, or solving many different robot control\ntasks, each connection keeps a list of tasks it is used for.

We provide an elementary example of a sutured TQFT,\nwhich comes from taking exterior algebras of certain singular homology groups.\nWe show that this sutured TQFT coincides with that of Honda et al. using\n$\\Z_2$-coefficients. The groups in our theory, being exterior algebras,\nnaturally come with the structure of a ring with unit.

We have\nalso studied the statistics of mode spacings and widths in localized samples.\nThe distribution of mode spacings between adjacent modes is close to the Wigner\nsurmise predicted for diffusive waves, which exhibit strong level repulsion.\nHowever, a deviation from Wigner distribution can be seen in the distribution\nof spacings beyond the nearest ones. A weakening in the rigidity of the modal\nspectrum is also observed as the sample length increases because of reduced\nlevel repulsion for more strongly localized waves. In contrast to residual\ndiffusive behavior for level spacing statistics, the distribution of level\nwidths are log-normal as predicted for localized waves. We also measured the\nsteady state and dynamic fluctuations and correlation of localized wave\ntransmitted through random waveguides. We find the degree of intensity\ncorrelation first increases, and then decays with time delay, before increasing\ndramatically. The variation in the spatial correlation of intensity with time\ndelay is due to the changing effective number of modes that contribute to\ntransmission. A minimum in correlation is reached when the number of modes\ncontributing appreciably to transmission peaks. At long times, the degree of\nintensity correlation and the variance of total transmission increase\ndramatically.
