We argue that to prove post-quantum security one needs to prove\nsecurity in the quantum-accessible random oracle model where the adversary can\nquery the random oracle with quantum states.\n  We begin by separating the classical and quantum-accessible random oracle\nmodels by presenting a scheme that is secure when the adversary is given\nclassical access to the random oracle, but is insecure when the adversary can\nmake quantum oracle queries. We then set out to develop generic conditions\nunder which a classical random oracle proof implies security in the\nquantum-accessible random oracle model. We introduce the concept of a\nhistory-free reduction which is a category of classical random oracle\nreductions that basically determine oracle answers independently of the history\nof previous queries, and we prove that such reductions imply security in the\nquantum model.
