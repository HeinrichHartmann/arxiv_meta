The equations of accretion flow are solved\nin a simplified one-dimensional model that neglects the latitudinal dependence\nof the flow. To solve the integrated equations that govern the dynamical\nbehaviour of the accretion flow, we have used an unsteady self-similar\nsolution. The solution provides some insights into the dynamics of\nquasi-spherical accretion flow and avoids from limits of the steady\nself-similar solution. In comparison to accretion flows without thermal\nconduction, the disc generally becomes cooler and denser. These properties are\nqualitatively consistent with performed simulations in hot accretion flows.\nMoreover, the angular velocity increases with the magnitude of conduction,\nwhile the radial infall velocity decreases. The mass accretion rate onto the\ncentral object is reduced in the presence of thermal conduction. We found that\nthe viscosity and thermal conduction have the opposite effects on the physical\nvariables. Furthermore, the flow represents a transonic point that moves inward\nwith the magnitude of conduction or viscosity.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures, accepted by MNRAS"]}]

Hence,\nclusters are expected to be luminous gamma-ray emitters since they also act as\nenergy reservoirs for additional CR sources, such as active galactic nuclei and\nsupernova-driven galactic winds. To detect the gamma-ray emission from CR\ninteractions with the ambient cluster gas, we conducted the deepest to date\nobservational campaign targeting a galaxy cluster at very high-energy\ngamma-rays and observed the Perseus cluster with the MAGIC Cherenkov telescopes\nfor a total of ~85 hr of effective observing time. This campaign resulted in\nthe detection of the central radio galaxy NGC 1275 at energies E > 100 GeV with\na very steep energy spectrum. Here, we restrict our analysis to energies E >\n630 GeV and detect no significant gamma-ray excess. This constrains the average\nCR-to-thermal pressure ratio to be <= 1-2%, depending on assumptions and the\nmodel for CR emission. Comparing these gamma-ray upper limits to predictions\nfrom cosmological cluster simulations that include CRs constrains the maximum\nCR acceleration efficiency at structure formation shocks to be < 50%.\nAlternatively, this may argue for non-negligible CR transport processes such as\nCR streaming and diffusion into the outer cluster regions. Finally, we derive\nlower limits on the magnetic field distribution assuming that the Perseus radio\nmini-halo is generated by secondary electrons/positrons that are created in\nhadronic CR interactions: assuming a spectrum of E^-2.2 around TeV energies as\nimplied by cluster simulations, we limit the central magnetic field to be > 4-9\nmicroG, depending on the rate of decline of the magnetic field strength toward\nlarger radii.\n","Comment: Corresponding authors are F.

As a string/unitig graph also encodes every valid assembly of reads,\nsuch a graph, provided that it can be constructed correctly, is in fact a\nlossless representation of reads. In principle, every analysis based on\nwhole-genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) data, such as SNP and insertion/deletion\n(INDEL) calling, can also be achieved with unitigs.\n  Results: To explore the feasibility of using de novo assembly in the context\nof resequencing, we developed a de novo assembler, fermi, that assembles\nIllumina short reads into unitigs while preserving most of information of the\ninput reads. SNPs and INDELs can be called by mapping the unitigs against a\nreference genome. By applying the method on 35-fold human resequencing data, we\nshowed that in comparison to the standard pipeline, our approach yields similar\naccuracy for SNP calling and better results for INDEL calling. It has higher\nsensitivity than other de novo assembly based methods for variant calling. Our\nwork suggests that variant calling with de novo assembly be a beneficial\ncomplement to the standard variant calling pipeline for whole-genome\nresequencing. In the methodological aspects, we proposed FMD-index for\nforward-backward extension of DNA sequences, a fast algorithm for finding all\nsuper-maximal exact matches and one-pass construction of unitigs from an\nFMD-index.\n  Availability: http://github.com/lh3/fermi\n  Contact: hengli@broadinstitute.org\n","Comment: Rev2: submitted version with minor improvements; 7 pages"]}]

In this paper, we prove the asymptotic behavior of these moments in\nall cases, and our main result states that while the two families of moment\nfunctions are asymptotically equal, the crank moments are always asymptotically\nlarger than the rank moments.\n  Andrews, Chan, and Kim primarily focused on one case, and proved the stronger\nresult that the first crank moment is strictly larger than the first rank\nmoment for all partitions by showing that the difference is equal to a\ncombinatorial statistic on partitions that they named the ospt-function. Our\nmain results therefore also give the asymptotic behavior of the ospt-function,\nand we further determine its behavior modulo 2 by relating its parity to\nAndrews spt-function.\n","Comment: 20 pages"]}]

The aim of the ORION routing protocol is\ntwofold: on one hand, it enhances the delivery ratio in networks where an\nend-to-end path does not necessarily exist, and on the other hand, it minimizes\nthe routing delay and the network overhead to achieve better performance. In\nORION, nodes are aware of their neighborhood by the mean of actual and\nstatistical estimation of new contacts. ORION makes use of autoregressive\nmoving average (ARMA) stochastic processes for best contact prediction and\ngeographical coordinates for optimal greedy data packet forwarding.

An important model system is the enzyme\ndihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from E. coli, which exhibits characteristic\nconformational changes of the active-site loop during the catalytic step and\nduring unbinding of the product. In this article, we present a general kinetic\nframework that can be used (1) to identify the ordering of events in the\ncoupling of conformational changes, binding and catalysis and (2) to determine\nthe rates of the substeps of coupled processes from a combined analysis of NMR\nR2 relaxation dispersion experiments and traditional enzyme kinetics\nmeasurements. We apply this framework to E. coli DHFR and find that the\nconformational change during product unbinding follows a\nconformational-selection mechanism, i.e. the conformational change occurs\npredominantly prior to unbinding. The conformational change during the\ncatalytic step, in contrast, is an induced change, i.e. the change occurs after\nthe chemical reaction. We propose that the reason for these conformational\nchanges, which are absent in human and other vertebrate DHFRs, is robustness of\nthe catalytic rate against large pH variations and changes to substrate/product\nconcentrations in E. coli.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables"]}]
