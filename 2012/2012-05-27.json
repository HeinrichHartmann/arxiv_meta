In the first topic, we characterize the local structure of\ngeneralized complex manifolds by proving that a generalized complex structure\nnear a complex point arises from a holomorphic Poisson structure. In the proof\nwe use a smoothed Newton's method along the lines of Nash, Moser and Conn.\n  In the second topic, we consider whether a given regular Poisson structure\nand transverse complex structure come from a generalized complex structure. We\ngive cohomological criteria, and we find some counterexamples and some\nunexpected examples, including a compact, regular generalized complex manifold\nfor which nearby symplectic leaves are not symplectomorphic.\n  In the third topic, we consider generalized complex structures with\nnondegenerate type change; we describe a generalized Calabi-Yau structure\ninduced on the type change locus, and prove a local normal form theorem near\nthis locus. Finally, in the fourth topic, we give a classification of\ngeneralized complex principal bundles satisfying a certain transversality\ncondition; in this case, there is a generalized flat connection, and the\nclassification involves a monodromy map to the Courant automorphism group.\n","Comment: 112 pages, thesis"]}]

Using a canonical\ntransformation of the gluon fields to a new set of adapted coordinates (a\nnon-standard type polar decomposition), which Abelianizes the Non-Abelian Gauss\nlaw constraints to be implemented, the corresponding unconstrained Hamiltonian\nand total angular momentum are derived. This reduces the colored spin-1 gluons\nto unconstrained colorless spin-0, spin-1, spin-2 and spin-3 glueball fields.\nThe obtained unconstrained Hamiltonian is then rewritten into a form, which\nseparates the rotational from the scalar degrees of freedom. It is shown that\nthe chromomagnetic potential has classical zero-energy valleys for two\narbitrarily large classical glueball fields, which are the unconstrained\nanalogs of the well-known \"constant Abelian fields\". On the quantum level,\npractically all glueball excitation energy is expected to go into the increase\nof the strengths of these two fields. Finally, as an outlook, the\nstraightforward generalization to low energy SU(3) Yang-Mills quantum theory in\nanalogy to the SU(2) case is indicated, leading to an expansion in the number\nof spatial derivatives, equivalent to a strong coupling expansion, with the\nSU(3) Yang-Mills quantum mechanics constituting the leading order.\n","Comment: 13 pages"]}]
