A new feature of our procedure is that it enables us to extract from the\ndata simultaneously the QCD scale parameter $\\Lambda_{\\bar{\\rm MS}}$ and the\nboundary energy squared $s_{\\rm p}$. We carefully determine the experimental\nerrors on these parameters which come from the errors on the invariant mass\nsquared distribution.

We show that our\nnumerical analysis is more stable against higher-order corrections than the\nstandard one. The extracted value for the duality point $s_{\\rm p}$ is found\nsurprisingly stable against perturbation theory corrections $s_{\\rm d}= 1.71\\pm\n0.05_{\\rm exp}\\pm 0.00_{\\rm th}\\,\\, {\\rm GeV^{2}}$.Additionally, we recalculate\nthe \"experimental\" Adler function in the infrared region using final ALEPH\nresults.

The modeling of the competing electronic\nstates of the cuprates is achieved in terms of consecutive orbital selective\nincompressibility-compressibility transitions for the charge response. We\ndemonstrate that the softening of the OBSM in these states is due to nonlocally\ninduced dynamic charge inhomogenities in form of charge stripes along the CuO\nbonds with different orbital character. Thus, a multi-orbital approach is\nessential for the CuO plane. The dynamic charge inhomogeneities may in turn be\nconsidered as precursors of static charge stripe order as recently observed in\nLa$_{2-x}$Ba$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ in a broad range of doping around x=1/8. The latter\nmay trigger a reconstruction of the Fermi surface into small pockets with\nreduced doping.

An exemplary Gedanken experiment, emphasizing such a\nmeasurement-dependent nature, was suggested by Wheeler using single photons.\nThe subtleness of the idea lies in the fact that the output beam-splitter of a\nMach-Zehnder interferometer is put in or removed after a photon has already\nentered the interferometer, thus performing a delayed test of the wave-particle\ncomplementary behavior. Recently, it was proposed that using a quantum analogue\nof the output beam-splitter would permit carrying out this type of test after\nthe detection of the photon and observing wave-particle superposition. In this\npaper we describe an experimental demonstration of these predictions using\nanother extraordinary property of quantum systems, entanglement. We use a pair\nof polarization entangled photons composed of one photon whose nature (wave or\nparticle) is tested, and of a corroborative photon that allows determining\nwhich one, or both, of these two aspects is being tested. This corroborative\nphoton infers the presence or absence of the beam-splitter and until it is\nmeasured, the beam-splitter is in a superposition of these two states, making\nit a quantum beam-splitter. When the quantum beam-splitter is in the state\npresent or absent, the interferometer reveals the wave or particle nature of\nthe test photon, respectively. Furthermore, by manipulating the corroborative\nphoton, we can continuously morph, via entanglement, the test photon from wave\nto particle behavior even after it was detected.

Thus, wave functions and their\nprobabilities are computed, for different bound-state pole positions\napproaching the $D^0\\bar{D}^{*0}$ threshold from below. We conclude that at the\nPDG X(3872) mass and for reasonable values of $a$, viz. 2.0 to 3.0 GeV$^{-1}$,\nthe $c\\bar{c}$ component remains quite substantial and certainly not\nnegligible, despite accounting for only about 6 to 10% of the total\nwave-function probability, owing to the naturally long tail of the\n$D^0\\bar{D}^{*0}$ component.\n","Comment: Contribution to the International Meeting \"Excited QCD\", Peniche,\n  Portugal, 06 - 12 May 2012; 6 pages, 2 figures (4 plots), 2 tables, Acta\n  Physica Polonica style"]}]

The algorithm mimics the principles of bat sonar in finding\nits targets. The algorithm introduces three search approaches. The first search\napproach considers a single sonar unit (SSU) with a fixed beam length and a\nsingle starting point. In this approach, although the results converge toward\nthe optimum fitness, it is not guaranteed to find the global optimum solution\nespecially for complex problems; it is satisfied with finding 'acceptably good'\nsolutions to these problems. The second approach considers multisonar units\n(MSU) working in parallel in the same state space. Each unit has its own\nstarting point and tries to find the optimum solution. In this approach the\nprobability that the algorithm converges toward the optimum solution is\nsignificantly increased. It is found that this approach is suitable for complex\nfunctions and for problems of wide state space. In the third approach, a single\nsonar unit with a moment (SSM) is used in order to handle the problem of\nconvergence toward a local optimum rather than a global optimum. The momentum\nterm is added to the length of the transmitted beams. This will give the chance\nto find the best fitness in a wider range within the state space. In this paper\na comparison between the proposed algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA) has been\nmade. It showed that both of the algorithms can catch approximately the optimum\nsolutions for all of the testbed functions except for the function that has a\nlocal minimum, in which the proposed algorithm's result is much better than\nthat of the GA algorithm. On the other hand, the comparison showed that the\nrequired execution time to obtain the optimum solution using the proposed\nalgorithm is much less than that of the GA algorithm.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 16 figures, 7 tables; (IJCSIS) International Journal of\n  Computer Science and Information Security,Vol. 10, No. 10, October 2012"]}]

In the noise-free setting we derive a general expression on the\nnumber of measurements needed to ensure that a unique solution can be found in\na stable way, that depends on the set T through a natural complexity parameter.\nThis parameter can be computed explicitly for many sets T of interest. For\nexample, for k-sparse inputs we show that O(k\\log(n/k)) measurements are\nneeded, and when x can be any vector in R^n, O(n) measurements suffice. In the\nnoisy case, we show that if one can find a value for which the empirical risk\nis bounded by a given, computable constant (that depends on the set T), then\nthe error with respect to the true input is bounded above by an another,\nclosely related complexity parameter of the set. By choosing an appropriate\nnumber N of measurements, this bound can be made arbitrarily small, and it\ndecays at a rate faster than N^{-1/2+\\delta} for any \\delta>0. In particular,\nfor k-sparse vectors stable recovery is possible from O(k\\log(n/k)\\log k) noisy\nmeasurements, and when x can be any vector in R^n, O(n \\log n) noisy\nmeasurements suffice. We also show that the complexity parameter for the\nquadratic problem is the same as the one used for analyzing stability in linear\nmeasurements under very general conditions. Thus, no substantial price has to\nbe paid in terms of stability if there is no knowledge of the phase.\n"]}]

We\nstudied ensembles of bound and unbound conformations of six proteins to explore\ntheir binding mechanisms and characterize the energy landscapes in implicit\nsolvent.
