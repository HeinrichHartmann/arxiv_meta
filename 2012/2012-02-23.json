For example, we address the\nfollowing simple question: how many patterns of infinite Kolam can we draw for\na given grid pattern of dots? The simplest way is to draw possible patterns of\nKolam while judging if it is infinite Kolam. Such a search problem seems to be\nNP complete. However, it is certainly not. In this paper, we focus on\ndiamond-shaped grid patterns of dots, (1-3-5-3-1) and (1-3-5-7-5-3-1) in\nparticular.

We demonstrate that these gauge structures are closely\nrelated, and appear as counterparts in either the canonical or\nfield-theoretical language.

In the infinite\npopulation limit, the stochastic dynamics yields a system of deterministic\nevolution equations for population densities; and for very large but finite\nsystem a diffusion process is obtained. We report the emergence of a circular\ndynamics in the diffusion process, with an intrinsic frequency, near the\nendemic steady state. The endemic steady state is represented by a stable node\nin the deterministic dynamics; As a NESS phenomenon, the circular motion is\ncaused by the intrinsic heterogeneity within the subgroups, leading to a broken\nsymmetry and time irreversibility.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 5 figures"]}]

The concept of verifiable\ncomputation enables a weak client to outsource difficult computations to a\npowerful, but untrusted, server. Protocols for verifiable computation aim to\nprovide the client with a guarantee that the server performed the requested\ncomputations correctly, without requiring the client to perform the\ncomputations herself. By design, these protocols impose a minimal computational\nburden on the client. However, existing protocols require the server to perform\na large amount of extra bookkeeping in order to enable a client to easily\nverify the results. Verifiable computation has thus remained a theoretical\ncuriosity, and protocols for it have not been implemented in real cloud\ncomputing systems.\n  Our goal is to leverage GPUs to reduce the server-side slowdown for\nverifiable computation.

The method is motivated by and works for theories with heavy\nsquarks and Wino-like LSPs (with nearly degenerate LSP and chargino). Such\ntheories are well motivated and their gluinos typically have a O(50%) branching\nratio to charged Winos. Observing the track of a long lived charged Wino\nproduced from gluino decay could give a clear identification of a gluino event.\nCharged Wino NLSPs produced in colliders can be long-lived enough to leave a\nreconstructable high pT charged track before decaying into a soft pion (or a\nsoft lepton) and the LSP, a signature with low SM background. By supplementing\nthe canonical gluino search strategy with a search for these stiff chargino\ntracks, our results suggest it will be possible to find gluinos with\nsignificantly less luminosity. In addition, we describe a procedure for\nobtaining a kinematic measurement of the gluino mass using the three momenta of\nthe reconstructed chargino tracks. With measurements of the gluino mass and\ncross section, it will be possible to determine the gluino spin, and confirm\nthat the excess events are indeed due to a spin 1/2 superpartner. It may also\nbe possible to use these stiff Wino tracks to obtain an approximate measurement\nof the chargino mass, and therefore the LSP (dark matter) mass.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 1 figure"]}]

At the MAC layer, nodes may need to\nagree on a new time slot or frequency channel; at the application layer nodes\nmay need to agree on handing over a leader role from one node to another.\nMessage loss caused by interference may break agreement in two different ways:\nnone of the nodes use the new information (time slot, channel, leader) and\nstick with the previous assignment, or - even worse - some nodes use the new\ninformation and some do not. This may lead to reduced performance or failures.\nIn this paper we investigate the problem of agreement under interference and\npoint out the limitations of the traditional message-based n-way handshake\napproach. We propose novel protocols that use jamming instead of message\ntransmissions and show that they outperform the n-way handshake in terms of\nagreement probability, energy consumption, and time-to-completion both in the\nunicast case (two neighboring nodes agree) as well as in the broadcast case\n(any number of neighboring nodes agree).\n"]}]
