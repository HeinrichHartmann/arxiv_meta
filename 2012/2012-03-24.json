The routing problem is modeled as an optimal control problem\nfor a decentralized Markov Decision Process, with links characterized by\nlocally known packet drop probabilities that either remain constant on average\nor change slowly. The equivalence of this optimization problem to that of\nperformance maximization of an explicitly constructed probabilistic automata\nallows us to effectively apply the theory of quantitative measures of\nprobabilistic regular languages, and design a distributed highly efficient\nsolution approach that attempts to minimize source-to-sink drop probabilities\nacross the network. Theoretical results provide rigorous guarantees on global\nperformance, showing that the algorithm achieves near-global optimality, in\npolynomial time. It is also argued that GODDeS is significantly\ncongestion-aware, and exploits multi-path routes optimally.
