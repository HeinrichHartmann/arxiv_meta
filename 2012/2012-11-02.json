However,\nthere is a strong correlation structure among SNPs that need to be taken into\naccount. Hence, increasingly modern computationally expensive regression\nmethods are employed for SNP selection that consider all markers simultaneously\nand thus incorporate dependencies among SNPs.\n  Results: We develop a novel multivariate algorithm for large scale SNP\nselection using CAR score regression, a promising new approach for prioritizing\nbiomarkers. Specifically, we propose a computationally efficient procedure for\nshrinkage estimation of CAR scores from high-dimensional data. Subsequently, we\nconduct a comprehensive comparison study including five advanced regression\napproaches (boosting, lasso, NEG, MCP, and CAR score) and a univariate approach\n(marginal correlation) to determine the effectiveness in finding true causal\nSNPs.\n  Conclusions: Simultaneous SNP selection is a challenging task. We demonstrate\nthat our CAR score-based algorithm consistently outperforms all competing\napproaches, both uni- and multivariate, in terms of correctly recovered causal\nSNPs and SNP ranking.

A conducting fluid of magnetic Prandtl number Pm=0.01 is driven into\nmotion by the counter-rotation of the two hemispheric walls. The resulting flow\nis of von K\\'arm\\'an type, consisting of a layer of zonal velocity close to the\nouter wall and a secondary meridional circulation. Above a certain forcing\nthreshold, the mean flow is unstable to non-axisymmetric motions within an\nequatorial belt. For fixed forcing above this threshold, we have studied the\ndynamo properties of this flow. The presence of a conducting outer wall is\nessential to the existence of a dynamo at these parameters. We have therefore\nstudied the effect of changing the material parameters of the wall (magnetic\npermeability, electrical conductivity, and thickness) on the dynamo. In common\nwith previous studies, we find that dynamos are obtained only when either the\nconductivity or the permeability is sufficiently large. However, we find that\nthe effect of these two parameters on the dynamo process are different and can\neven compete to the detriment of the dynamo. Our self-consistent approach allow\nus to analyze in detail the dynamo feedback loop. The dynamos we obtain are\ntypically dominated by an axisymmetric toroidal magnetic field and an axial\ndipole component. We show that the ability of the outer shear layer to produce\na strong toroidal field depends critically on the presence of a conducting\nouter wall, which shields the fluid from the vacuum outside. The generation of\nthe axisymmetric poloidal field, on the other hand, occurs in the equatorial\nbelt and does not depend on the wall properties.\n","Comment: accepted for publication in Physical Review E"]}]

In S, all definable sets of reals\nare Lebesgue measurable, suggesting that Connes views a theory as being\n\"virtual\" if it is not definable in a suitable model of ZFC.
