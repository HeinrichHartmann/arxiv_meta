This new distribution\nobtained by compounding the exponentiated Weibull and geometric distributions.\nThe EWG distribution includes as special cases the generalized\nexponential-geometric (GEG), complementary Weibull-geometric (CWG),\ncomplementary exponential-geometric (CEG), exponentiated Rayleigh-geometric\n(ERG) and Rayleigh-geometric (RG) distributions.\n  The hazard function of the EWG distribution can be decreasing, increasing,\nbathtub-shaped and unimodal among others. Several properties of the EWG\ndistribution such as quantiles and moments, maximum likelihood estimation\nprocedure via an EM-algorithm, R\\'{e}nyi and Shannon entropies, moments of\norder statistics, residual life function and probability weighted moments are\nstudied in this paper. In the end, we give two applications with real data sets\nto show the flexibility of the new distribution.\n"]}]
