In Section 5, we introduce the concept of bidimension of (global)\nmetric currents on a Banach space and relate it to the behaviour of the finite\ndimensional projections of the currents.

Our calculations show that, at early times, when protons can be\naccelerated to energies E>10^20 eV, the young supernova shell tends to prevent\ntheir escape.

In this context, distributed PSSE\nmethods are treated here under a unified and systematic framework. A novel\nalgorithm is developed based on the alternating direction method of\nmultipliers. It leverages existing PSSE solvers, respects privacy policies,\nexhibits low communication load, and its convergence to the centralized\nestimates is guaranteed even in the absence of local observability. Beyond the\nconventional least-squares based PSSE, the decentralized framework accommodates\na robust state estimator. By exploiting interesting links to the compressive\nsampling advances, the latter jointly estimates the state and identifies\ncorrupted measurements. The novel algorithms are numerically evaluated using\nthe IEEE 14-, 118-bus, and a 4,200-bus benchmarks.

To reduce the labeling cost\nof training a classification model for each individual language, it is\nimportant to transfer the label knowledge gained from one language to another\nlanguage by conducting cross language classification. In this paper we develop\na novel subspace co-regularized multi-view learning method for cross language\ntext classification. This method is built on parallel corpora produced by\nmachine translation. It jointly minimizes the training error of each classifier\nin each language while penalizing the distance between the subspace\nrepresentations of parallel documents. Our empirical study on a large set of\ncross language text classification tasks shows the proposed method consistently\noutperforms a number of inductive methods, domain adaptation methods, and\nmulti-view learning methods.\n","Comment: Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on\n  Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]}]

Many algorithmic and control\ntechniques in current database technology were devised for disk-based systems\nwhere I/O dominated the performance. In this work we take a new look at the\nwell-known sort-merge join which, so far, has not been in the focus of research\nin scalable massively parallel multi-core data processing as it was deemed\ninferior to hash joins. We devise a suite of new massively parallel sort-merge\n(MPSM) join algorithms that are based on partial partition-based sorting.\nContrary to classical sort-merge joins, our MPSM algorithms do not rely on a\nhard to parallelize final merge step to create one complete sort order.

An extensive experimental evaluation on a modern 32-core machine\nwith one TB of main memory proves the competitive performance of MPSM on large\nmain memory databases with billions of objects.

To achieve high performance by best\nutilizing heterogeneous storage devices, we have designed and implemented a\nheterogeneity-aware software framework for DBMS storage management called\nhStorage-DB, where semantic information that is critical for storage I/O is\nidentified and passed to the storage manager.

The main outcome of this analysis is that the distributed\ncomputing setting contrasts significantly with the sequential one as far as\nrandomization is concerned. Indeed, we prove that in some cases, the ability to\nincrease the success probability for deciding distributed languages is rather\nlimited. Informally, a (p,q)-decider for a language L is a distributed\nrandomized algorithm which accepts instances in L with probability at least p\nand rejects instances outside of L with probability at least q. It is known\nthat every hereditary language that can be decided in t rounds by a\n(p,q)-decider, where p^2+q>1, can actually be decided deterministically in O(t)\nrounds. In one of our results we give evidence supporting the conjecture that\nthe above statement holds for all distributed languages. This is achieved by\nconsidering the restricted case of path topologies. We then turn our attention\nto the range below the aforementioned threshold, namely, the case where\np^2+q\\leq1. We define B_k(t) to be the set of all languages decidable in at\nmost t rounds by a (p,q)-decider, where p^{1+1/k}+q>1. It is easy to see that\nevery language is decidable (in zero rounds) by a (p,q)-decider satisfying\np+q=1. Hence, the hierarchy B_k provides a spectrum of complexity classes\nbetween determinism and complete randomization.

Several variations of their\ncurvatures and orientations generate difficulties during their manufacturing or\nthe machining of dies used in moulding, injection and forging. Analysis of\nseveral parts highlights two levels of difficulties between three types of\nshapes: prismatic parts with simple geometrical shapes, aeronautic structure\nparts composed of several shallow pockets and forging dies composed of several\ndeep cavities which often contain protrusions. This paper mainly concerns High\nSpeed Machining (HSM) of these dies which represent the highest complexity\nlevel because of the shapes' geometry and their topology. Five axes HSM is\ngenerally required for such complex shaped parts but 3 axes machining can be\nsufficient for dies. Evolutions in HSM CAM software and machine tools lead to\nan important increase in time for machining preparation. Analysis stages of the\nCAD model particularly induce this time increase which is required for a wise\nchoice of cutting tools and machining strategies. Assistance modules for\nprismatic parts machining features identification in CAD models are widely\nimplemented in CAM software. In spite of the last CAM evolutions, these kinds\nof CAM modules are undeveloped for aeronautical structure parts and forging\ndies. Development of new CAM modules for the extraction of relevant machining\nareas as well as the definition of the topological relations between these\nareas must make it possible for the machining assistant to reduce the machining\npreparation time. In this paper, a model developed for the description of\ncomplex shape parts topology is presented. It is based on machining areas\nextracted for the construction of geometrical features starting from CAD models\nof the parts. As topology is described in order to assist machining assistant\nduring machining process generation, the difficulties associated with tasks he\ncarried out are analyzed at first. The topological model presented after is\nbased on the basic geometrical features extracted. Topological relations which\nrepresent the framework of the model are defined between the basic geometrical\nfeatures which are gathered afterwards in macro-features. Approach used for the\nidentification of these macro-features is also presented in this paper.\nDetailed application on the construction of the topological model of forging\ndies is presented in the last part of the paper.\n"]}]
