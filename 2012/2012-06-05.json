Although SKG\nis easy to implement, there is little understanding of the properties and\nbehavior of this model.\n  We show that the parallel variant of the edge-configuration model given by\nChung and Lu (referred to as CL) is notably similar to the SKG model.

Strong electrical coupling synchronizes activity\nacross cell ensembles. Surprisingly, in the presence of noise synchronous\noscillations generated by an electrically coupled network may differ\nqualitatively from the oscillations produced by uncoupled individual cells\nforming the network. A prominent example of such behavior is the synchronized\nbursting in islets of Langerhans formed by pancreatic \\beta-cells, which in\nisolation are known to exhibit irregular spiking. At the heart of this\nintriguing phenomenon lies denoising, a remarkable ability of electrical\ncoupling to diminish the effects of noise acting on individual cells.\n  In this paper, we derive quantitative estimates characterizing denoising in\nelectrically coupled networks of conductance-based models of square wave\nbursting cells. Our analysis reveals the interplay of the intrinsic properties\nof the individual cells and network topology and their respective contributions\nto this important effect. In particular, we show that networks on graphs with\nlarge algebraic connectivity or small total effective resistance are better\nequipped for implementing denoising.

However, there\nstill remains the crucial challenge of simultaneously closing all major\nloopholes - the locality, freedom-of-choice, and detection loopholes - in a\nsingle experiment. An important sub-class of local realistic theories can be\ntested with the concept of \"steering\". The term steering was introduced by\nSchr\\\"odinger in 1935 for the fact that entanglement would seem to allow an\nexperimenter to remotely steer the state of a distant system as in the\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) argument. Einstein called this \"spooky action at\na distance\". EPR-Steering has recently been rigorously formulated as a quantum\ninformation task opening it up to new experimental tests. Here, we present the\nfirst loophole-free demonstration of EPR-steering by violating three-setting\nquadratic steering inequality, tested with polarization entangled photons\nshared between two distant laboratories. Our experiment demonstrates this\neffect while simultaneously closing all loopholes: both the locality loophole\nand a specific form of the freedom-of-choice loophole are closed by having a\nlarge separation of the parties and using fast quantum random number\ngenerators, and the fair-sampling loophole is closed by having high overall\ndetection efficiency. Thereby, we exclude - for the first time loophole-free -\nan important class of local realistic theories considered by EPR.

Using\nMCS deconvolution on NIC2 HST images, we reached an astrometric accuracy of\nabout 1-2.5 mas and an accurate shape measurement of the lens galaxy. Second,\nwe combined these measurements with those of 14 other systems to present new\nmass models of these lenses.

The EVN data indicate for compact nuclei on 40 pc scales, with\nbrightness temperatures typical for accretion-disk scenarios. Comparison with\nFIRST shows that the 18 cm emission is resolved out up to 50% by MERLIN.\nStar-formation rates based on large aperture SDSS spectra are generally too\nsmall to produce considerable contamination of the nuclear radio emission. We\ncan, therefore, assume the 18 cm flux densities to be produced in the nuclei of\nthe AGN. Together with the ROSAT soft X-ray luminosities and black hole mass\nestimates from the literature, our sample objects follow closely the Merloni et\nal.

Detailed X-ray spectral modeling from deeper hard X-ray observations\nand higher angular resolution at radio wavelengths are required to further\nproceed in the disentangling of jet and accretion related processes.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 7 figures, submitted to A&A"]}]

For instance, some\ncharacterizations of regular partitions, and bounds for some parameters, such\nas the independence and chromatic numbers, the diameter, the bandwidth, etc.,\nhave been obtained. For each parameter of a graph involving the cardinality of\nsome vertex sets, we can define its corresponding weight parameter by giving\nsome \"weights\" (that is, the entries of the positive eigenvector) to the\nvertices and replacing cardinalities by square norms. The key point is that\nsuch weights \"regularize\" the graph, and hence allow us to define a kind of\nregular partition, called \"pseudo-regular,\" intended for general graphs. Here\nwe show how to use interlacing for proving results about some weight parameters\nand pseudo-regular partitions of a graph.

Our method\ncan (i) generate automatically a large number of proper word puzzles of\ndifferent types, including the odd one out, choose the related word and\nseparate the topics puzzle. (ii) It can easily create domain-specific puzzles\nby replacing the corpus component. (iii) It is also capable of automatically\ngenerating puzzles with parameterizable levels of difficulty suitable for,\ne.g., beginners or intermediate learners.\n","Comment: 4 pages"]}]

This paper describes the various components of\nour prototype implementation of a Real-time Passenger Information System\n(RTPIS) for a public transport system like a fleet of buses. Vehicle-mounted\nunits, bus station units and a server located at the transport company premises\ncomprise the system. The vehicle unit reports the current position of the\nvehicle to a central server periodically via General Packet Radio Service\n(GPRS). An Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) algorithm running on the server\npredicts the arrival times of buses at their stops based on real-time\nobservations of the buses' current Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates.\nThis information is displayed and announced to passengers at stops using\nstation units, which periodically fetch the required ETA from the server via\nGPRS. Novel features of our prototype include: (a) a route creator utility\nwhich automatically creates new routes from scratch when a bus is driven along\nthe new route, and (b) voice tagging of stops and points of interest along any\nroute. Besides, the prototype provides: (i) web-based applications for\npassengers, providing useful information like a snapshot of present bus\nlocations on the streets, and (ii) web-based analysis tools for the transport\nauthority, providing information useful for fleet management, like number of\ntrips undertaken by a specific bus. The prototype has been demonstrated in a\ncampus environment, with four-wheelers and two-wheelers emulating buses. The\nautomatic real-time passenger information system has the potential of making\nthe public transport system an attractive alternative for city-dwellers,\nthereby contributing to fewer private vehicles on the road, leading to lower\ncongestion levels and less pollution.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables"]}]

The techniques\ncurrently available in the literature are either too theoretical, applying to\nonly a small number of knots, or are designed to only deal with a specific\nknot. The thesis builds on the results of Herald, Kirk and Livingston [HKL10]\nand Tamulis [Tam02] to give a series of criteria, using twisted Alexander\npolynomials, for determining whether a knot is of infinite order in C.\n  There are two immediate applications of these theorems. The first is to give\nthe structure of the subgroups of the concordance group C and the algebraic\nconcordance group G generated by the prime knots of 9 or fewer crossings. This\nshould be of practical value to the knot-theoretic community, but more\nimportantly it provides interesting examples of phenomena both in the algebraic\nand geometric concordance groups. The second application is to find the\nconcordance orders of all prime knots with up to 12 crossings. At the time of\nwriting of this thesis, there are 325 such knots listed as having unknown\nconcordance order. The thesis includes the computation of the orders of all\nexcept two of these.\n  In addition to using twisted Alexander polynomials to determine the\nconcordance order of a knot, a theorem of Cochran, Orr and Teichner [COT03] is\napplied to prove that the n-twisted doubles of the unknot are not slice for n\nnot 0 or 2. This technique involves analysing the `second-order' invariants of\na knot; that is, slice invariants (in this case, signatures) of a set of\nmetabolising curves on a Seifert surface for the knot.

By\ngeneralizing the traditional concept to also include their time-dependent\nirreversible components allows us to express the first law in a symmetric form\ndE(t)= dQ(t)-dW(t) in which dQ(t) and work dW(t) appear on an equal footing and\npossess the symmetry.

We show\nthat separable infinite-dimensional Hilbertian JC*-triples are completely\nisometric to an element of the set of (infinite) intersections of these spaces.\nThis set includes the operator spaces R, C, their intersection, and the space\nspanned by creation operators on the full anti-symmetric Fock space. In fact,\nwe show that these new spaces are completely isometric to the space of creation\n(resp. annihilation) operators on the anti-symmetric tensors of the Hilbert\nspace. Together with the finite-dimensional case studied in our previous paper,\nthis gives a full operator space classification of all rank-one JC*-triples in\nterms of creation and annihilation operator spaces.\n  We use the above to show that all contractive projections on a C*-algebra A\nwith infinite dimensional Hilbertian range are ``expansions'' (which we define\nprecisely) of normal contractive projections from the second dual of A onto a\nHilbertian space which is completely isometric to one of the four spaces\nmentioned above. This generalizes the well known result, first proved for B(H)\nby Robertson, that all Hilbertian operator spaces that are completely\ncontractively complemented in a C*-algebra are completely isometric to R or C.\nWe also compute various completely bounded Banach-Mazur distances between these\nspaces.\n","Comment: 24 pages, submitted"]}]
