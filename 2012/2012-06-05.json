A prominent example of such behavior is the synchronized\nbursting in islets of Langerhans formed by pancreatic \\beta-cells, which in\nisolation are known to exhibit irregular spiking. At the heart of this\nintriguing phenomenon lies denoising, a remarkable ability of electrical\ncoupling to diminish the effects of noise acting on individual cells.\n  In this paper, we derive quantitative estimates characterizing denoising in\nelectrically coupled networks of conductance-based models of square wave\nbursting cells. Our analysis reveals the interplay of the intrinsic properties\nof the individual cells and network topology and their respective contributions\nto this important effect. In particular, we show that networks on graphs with\nlarge algebraic connectivity or small total effective resistance are better\nequipped for implementing denoising. As a by-product of the analysis of\ndenoising, we analytically estimate the rate with which trajectories converge\nto the synchronization subspace and the stability of the latter to random\nperturbations. These estimates reveal the role of the network topology in\nsynchronization. The analysis is complemented by numerical simulations of\nelectrically coupled conductance-based networks. Taken together, these results\nexplain the mechanisms underlying synchronization and denoising in an important\nclass of biological models.\n"]}]

However, there\nstill remains the crucial challenge of simultaneously closing all major\nloopholes - the locality, freedom-of-choice, and detection loopholes - in a\nsingle experiment. An important sub-class of local realistic theories can be\ntested with the concept of \"steering\". The term steering was introduced by\nSchr\\\"odinger in 1935 for the fact that entanglement would seem to allow an\nexperimenter to remotely steer the state of a distant system as in the\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) argument. Einstein called this \"spooky action at\na distance\". EPR-Steering has recently been rigorously formulated as a quantum\ninformation task opening it up to new experimental tests. Here, we present the\nfirst loophole-free demonstration of EPR-steering by violating three-setting\nquadratic steering inequality, tested with polarization entangled photons\nshared between two distant laboratories. Our experiment demonstrates this\neffect while simultaneously closing all loopholes: both the locality loophole\nand a specific form of the freedom-of-choice loophole are closed by having a\nlarge separation of the parties and using fast quantum random number\ngenerators, and the fair-sampling loophole is closed by having high overall\ndetection efficiency. Thereby, we exclude - for the first time loophole-free -\nan important class of local realistic theories considered by EPR.

To reach these goals, we need\nhigh-accuracy astrometry and morphology measurements of the lens. In this work,\nwe first present new astrometry for 11 lenses with measured time delays. Using\nMCS deconvolution on NIC2 HST images, we reached an astrometric accuracy of\nabout 1-2.5 mas and an accurate shape measurement of the lens galaxy. Second,\nwe combined these measurements with those of 14 other systems to present new\nmass models of these lenses.

We study\nthe cm radio emission of an SDSS/ROSAT/FIRST matched sample of 13 X-raying AGN\nin the redshift range 0.11< z < 0.37 at high angular resolution with the goal\nof searching for jet structures or diffuse, extended emission on sub-kpc\nscales. We use MERLIN at 18 cm for all objects and Western EVN at 18 cm for\nfour objects to study the radio emission on scales of ~500 pc and ~40 pc for\nthe MERLIN and EVN observations, respectively. The detected emission is\ndominated by compact nuclear radio structures. We find no kpc collimated jet\nstructures. The EVN data indicate for compact nuclei on 40 pc scales, with\nbrightness temperatures typical for accretion-disk scenarios. Comparison with\nFIRST shows that the 18 cm emission is resolved out up to 50% by MERLIN.\nStar-formation rates based on large aperture SDSS spectra are generally too\nsmall to produce considerable contamination of the nuclear radio emission. We\ncan, therefore, assume the 18 cm flux densities to be produced in the nuclei of\nthe AGN.

This ground state plays\nan important role in the mathematical treatment of recent experiments on the\nphenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation, and in the study of various types of\nsolutions of nonhomogeneous defocusing nonlinear Schrodinger equations. Many of\nthese applications require delicate estimates for the behavior of the ground\nstate near the boundary of the condensate, as the singular parameter tends to\nzero, in the vicinity of which the ground state has irregular behavior in the\nform of a steep corner layer. In particular, the role of this layer is\nimportant in order to detect the presence of vortices in the small density\nregion of the condensate, understand the superfluid flow around an obstacle,\nand also has a leading order contribution in the energy.

In such a case, a Markovian\napproach (via Fokker-Planck equations) is used to derive analytic formulas of\nthe mean and the variance of the number of proteins at equilibrium.

For instance, some\ncharacterizations of regular partitions, and bounds for some parameters, such\nas the independence and chromatic numbers, the diameter, the bandwidth, etc.,\nhave been obtained. For each parameter of a graph involving the cardinality of\nsome vertex sets, we can define its corresponding weight parameter by giving\nsome \"weights\" (that is, the entries of the positive eigenvector) to the\nvertices and replacing cardinalities by square norms. The key point is that\nsuch weights \"regularize\" the graph, and hence allow us to define a kind of\nregular partition, called \"pseudo-regular,\" intended for general graphs. Here\nwe show how to use interlacing for proving results about some weight parameters\nand pseudo-regular partitions of a graph.

The thesis builds on the results of Herald, Kirk and Livingston [HKL10]\nand Tamulis [Tam02] to give a series of criteria, using twisted Alexander\npolynomials, for determining whether a knot is of infinite order in C.\n  There are two immediate applications of these theorems. The first is to give\nthe structure of the subgroups of the concordance group C and the algebraic\nconcordance group G generated by the prime knots of 9 or fewer crossings. This\nshould be of practical value to the knot-theoretic community, but more\nimportantly it provides interesting examples of phenomena both in the algebraic\nand geometric concordance groups. The second application is to find the\nconcordance orders of all prime knots with up to 12 crossings. At the time of\nwriting of this thesis, there are 325 such knots listed as having unknown\nconcordance order. The thesis includes the computation of the orders of all\nexcept two of these.\n  In addition to using twisted Alexander polynomials to determine the\nconcordance order of a knot, a theorem of Cochran, Orr and Teichner [COT03] is\napplied to prove that the n-twisted doubles of the unknot are not slice for n\nnot 0 or 2. This technique involves analysing the `second-order' invariants of\na knot; that is, slice invariants (in this case, signatures) of a set of\nmetabolising curves on a Seifert surface for the knot.

By\ngeneralizing the traditional concept to also include their time-dependent\nirreversible components allows us to express the first law in a symmetric form\ndE(t)= dQ(t)-dW(t) in which dQ(t) and work dW(t) appear on an equal footing and\npossess the symmetry.

Through the W parameter, the logarithmic derivative of the\nradius with respect to the luminosity, the past values of the solar luminosity\ncan be recovered. The black drop phenomenon affects the evaluation of the\ninstants of internal and external contacts between the planetary disk and the\nsolar limb. With these observed instants compared with the ephemerides the\nvalue of the solar diameter is recovered. The black drop and seeing effects are\novercome with two fitting circles, to Venus and to the Sun, drawn in the\nundistorted part of the image. The corrections of ephemerides due to the\natmospheric refraction will also be taken into account. The forthcoming transit\nof Venus will allow an accuracy on the diameter of the Sun better than 0.01\narcsec, with good images of the ingress and of the egress taken each second.\nChinese solar observatories are in the optimal conditions to obtain valuable\ndata for the measurement of the solar diameter with the Venus transit of 5/6\nJune 2012 with an unprecedented accuracy, and with absolute calibration given\nby the ephemerides.
