A Boltzmann transport equation is employed to describe the\ntime evolution of the charmonium phase space distribution with the loss and\ngain term accounting for charmonium dissociation and regeneration (from charm\nquarks), respectively. The momentum dependence of the charmonium dissociation\nrate is worked out. The dominant process for in-medium charmonium regeneration\nis found to be a 3-to-2 process. Its corresponding regeneration rates from\ndifferent input charm-quark momentum spectra are evaluated. Experimental data\non $J/\\psi$ production at CERN-SPS and BNL-RHIC are compared with our numerical\nresults in terms of both rapidity-dependent inclusive yields and transverse\nmomentum ($p_t$) spectra. Within current uncertainties from (interpreting) lQCD\ndata and from input charm-quark spectra the centrality dependence of $J/\\psi$\nproduction at SPS and RHIC (for both mid- and forward rapidity) is reasonably\nwell reproduced. The $J/\\psi$ $p_t$ data are shown to have a discriminating\npower for in-medium charmonium properties as inferred from different\ninterpretations of lQCD results.\n","Comment: 158 pages, PhD thesis, Texas A&M University, December 2010, Advisor:\n  Prof. R.Rapp"]}]

Single pi0 studies have indicated a large potential for\nimprovement in the energy resolution of pi0's, typically reducing the average\nenergy resolution by a factor of two for 4 GeV pi0's. We apply this method to\nfully simulated multi-hadronic events with multiple pi0's with widely varying\nenergies using the ILD00 detector model. Several methods for identifying the\ncorrect pairings of photons with parent pi0's were explored. The combinatorics\nbecome challenging as the number of pi0's increases and we employ the Blossom V\nimplementation of Edmonds' matching algorithm for handling this. For events\nwhere both photons of the pi0 are detected, the resulting solutions lead to an\nimprovement in the pi0 component of the event energy resolution for 91.2 GeV Z0\nevents from 18.0%/sqrt(E) to 13.9%/sqrt(E) using the ILD00 detector and its\nreconstruction algorithms. This can be compared to a maximum potential\nimprovement to 12.2%/sqrt(E) if all photon pairs are matched correctly using\nthe current photon reconstruction.\n","Comment: LCWS11 Conference Proceedings, 15 pages, 8 figures"]}]
