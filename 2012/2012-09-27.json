This\never-present and pernicious uncertainty is often the Achilles' heel in\ncosmological studies and must be reduced if we are to see the advent of\nprecision cosmology in the late-time Universe. We show that an optimally\ntrained artificial neural network (ANN), when presented with a set of\ncosmological parameters (Omega_m h^2, Omega_b h^2, n_s, w_0, sigma_8, m_nu and\nredshift z), can provide a worst-case error <=1 per cent (for z<=2) fit to the\nnon-linear matter power spectrum deduced through N-body simulations, for modes\nup to k<=0.7 h/Mpc. Our power spectrum interpolator is accurate over the entire\nparameter space. This is a significant improvement over some of the current\nmatter power spectrum calculators. In this paper, we detail how an accurate\ninterpolation of the matter power spectrum is achievable with only a sparsely\nsampled grid of cosmological parameters. Unlike large-scale N-body simulations\nwhich are computationally expensive and/or infeasible, a well-trained ANN can\nbe an extremely quick and reliable tool in interpreting cosmological\nobservations and parameter estimation.

Methods:\nFive cancer cell lines were exposed to ELF-MFs within the range of 0.025 to 5\nmicroT, and the cells were examined for karyotype changes after 6 days.\nResults: All cancer cells lines lost chromosomes from MF exposure, with a\nmostly flat dose-response. Constant MF exposures for three weeks allow a rising\nreturn to the baseline, unperturbed karyotypes. From this point, small MF\nincreases or decreases are again capable of inducing karyotype contractions.\nOur data suggests that the karyotype contractions are caused by MF interference\nwith mitochondria's ATP synthase (ATPS), compensated by the action of\nAMP-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK). The effects of MFs are similar to those of\nthe ATPS inhibitor oligomycin. They are amplified by metformin, an AMPK\nstimulator, and attenuated by resistin, an AMPK inhibitor. Over environmental\nMFs, karyotype contractions of various cancer cell lines show exceptionally\nwide and flat dose-responses, except for those of erythro-leukemia cells, which\ndisplay a progressive rise from 0.025 to 0.4 microT. Conclusions: The\nbiological effects of MFs are connected to an alteration in the structure of\nwater that impedes the flux of protons in ATPS channels. These results may be\nenvironmentally important, in view of the central roles played in human\nphysiology by ATPS and AMPK, particularly in their links to diabetes, cancer\nand longevity.\n","Comment: A new mechanism of interaction between power frequency magnetic\n  fields and living systems.

Next we define stable, semistable and polystable pseudo-real\nprincipal $G$--bundles. Their relationships with the usual stable, semistable\nand polystable principal $G$--bundles are investigated. We then prove that the\nfollowing Donaldson--Uhlenbeck--Yau type correspondence holds: a pseudo-real\nprincipal $G$--bundle admits a compatible Einstein-Hermitian connection if and\nonly if it is polystable. A bijection between the following two sets is\nestablished: 1) The isomorphism classes of polystable pseudo-real principal\n$G$--bundles such that all the rational characteristic classes of the\nunderlying topological principal $G$--bundle vanish. 2) The equivalence classes\nof twisted representations of the extended fundamental group of $X$ in a\n$\\sigma_G$--invariant maximal compact subgroup of $G$. (The twisted\nrepresentations are defined using the central element in the definition of a\npseudo-real principal $G$--bundle.) All these results are also generalized to\nthe pseudo-real Higgs $G$--bundle.\n"]}]

While one-way relay with a single data flow\nintroduces loss in spectral efficiency due to its half-duplex operation,\ntwo-way relaying based on wireless network coding regains part of this loss by\nsimultaneously processing the two data flows. In a broader perspective, the\ntwo-way traffic pattern is rather limited and it is of interest to investigate\nother traffic patterns where such a simultaneous processing of information\nflows can bring performance advantage. In this paper we consider a scenario\nbeyond the usual two-way relaying: a four-way relaying, where each of the two\nMobile Stations (MSs) has a two-way connection to the same Base Station (BS),\nwhile each connection is through a dedicated Relay Station (RS). While both RSs\nare in the range of the same BS, they are assumed to have antipodal positions\nwithin the cell, such that they do not interfere with each other. We introduce\nand analyze a two-phase transmission scheme to serve the four-way traffic\npattern defined in this scenario. Each phase consists of combined broadcast and\nmultiple access. We analyze the achievable rate region of the new schemes for\ntwo different operational models for the RS, Decode-and-Forward (DF) and\nAmplify-and-Forward (AF), respectively. We compare the performance with a\nstate-of-the-art reference scheme, time sharing is used between the two MSs,\nwhile each MS is served through a two-way relaying scheme. The results indicate\nthat, when the RS operates in a DF mode, the achievable rate regions are\nsignificantly enlarged. On the other hand, for AF relaying, the gains are\nrather modest. The practical implication of the presented work is a novel\ninsight on how to improve the spatial reuse in wireless cellular networks by\ncoordinating the transmissions of the antipodal relays.\n","Comment: 20 pages,10 figures"]}]

The goal of\nthe optimized scheme proposed here is to enable experimental simplification and\nperformance improvement. The core of the scheme is composed by soft and hard\nX-ray self-seeding setups. Based on the use of an improved design for both\nmonochromators it is possible to increase the design electron energy up to 17.5\nGeV in photon energy range between 2 keV and 13 keV, which is the most\npreferable for life science experiments. An advantage of operating at such high\nelectron energy is the increase of the X-ray output peak power. Another\nadvantage is that 17.5 GeV is the preferred operation energy for SASE1 and\nSASE2 beamline users. Since it will be necessary to run all the XFEL lines at\nthe same electron energy, this choice will reduce the interference with other\nundulator lines and increase the total amount of scheduled beam time. In this\nwork we also propose a study of the performance of the self-seeding scheme\naccounting for spatiotemporal coupling caused by the use of a single crystal\nmonochromator. Our analysis indicates that this distortion is easily suppressed\nby the right choice of diamond crystal planes and that the proposed undulator\nsource yields about the same performance as in the case for a X-ray seed pulse\nwith no coupling. Simulations show that the FEL power reaches 2 TW in the 3 keV\n- 5 keV photon energy range, which is the most preferable for single\nbiomolecule imaging.\n","Comment: 48 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:1205.6345"]}]
