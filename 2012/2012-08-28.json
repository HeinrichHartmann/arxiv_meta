Here, we obtain a sharp threshold for power law behaviour. Only\nif initial ranks are biased towards lower ranks, or chosen uniformly at random,\nwe obtain a power law degree distribution with exponent 1+1/a. This indicates\nthat the power law degree distribution often observed in nature can be\nexplained by a rank-based attachment scheme, based on a ranking scheme that can\nbe derived from a number of different factors; the exponent of the power law\ncan be seen as a measure of the strength of the attachment.\n"]}]

This makes the method inconsistent, because\nthe MacDonald theory tacitly fixes the rheology by making Q scale as the\ninverse tidal frequency.\n  Spin-orbit coupling can be treated also in an approach called \"the Darwin\ntorque\". While this theory is general enough to accommodate an arbitrary\nfrequency-dependence of Q, this advantage has not yet been exploited in the\nliterature, where Q is assumed constant or is set to scale as inverse tidal\nfrequency, the latter assertion making the Darwin torque equivalent to a\ncorrected version of the MacDonald torque.\n  However neither a constant nor an inverse-frequency Q reflect the properties\nof realistic mantles and crusts, because the actual frequency-dependence is\nmore complex.

We\ndetect a difference of over a 30 per cent in the clustering strength for dark\nmatter haloes of 10^13-10^14 Msun, which is similar to the result of Bett et\nal. We explore whether the dependence of clustering strength on halo spin is\nremoved if we apply the redefinition of overdensity peak height proposed by\nLacerna & Padilla (Paper I) obtained using assembly ages. We find that this is\nnot the case due to two reasons. Firstly, only a few objects of low-virial mass\nare moved into the mass range where the spin introduces an assembly bias after\nusing this redefinition. Secondly, this formalism does not alter the mass of\nmassive objects. We then repeat the process of finding the redefined peak\nheight of Paper I but using the spin. In this case, the new masses show no\nspin-related assembly bias but they introduce a previously absent assembly bias\nwith respect to relative age. From this result, we conclude that the\nassembly-type bias with respect to the halo spin has a different origin than\nwith respect to assembly age. The former may be due to the material from\nfilaments, which is accreted by massive haloes, that is enhanced in\nhigh-density environments, thus causing more extreme spin values without\nsignificantly changing the formation age of the halo. In addition, high-mass\nobjects may correspond, in some cases, to a different peak height than that\nsuggested by their mass in numerical simulations, providing a possible\nexplanation for the assembly bias with respect to spin.

In this\nintroduction paper, at first, it is explicitly explained what is the main\nmisconception in the claim of the unconditional security for QKD theory. In\ngeneral terms, the cause of the misunderstanding on the security claim is the\nLemma in the paper of Renner. It suggests that the generation of the perfect\nrandom key is assured by the probability $ (1-d)$, and its failure probability\nis $d$. Thus, it concludes that the generated key provides the perfect random\nkey sequence when the protocol suceeds. So the QKD provides perfect secrecy to\nthe one time pad. This is the reason for the composition claim. However, the\nquantity of the trace distance (or variational distance) is not the probability\nfor such an event. If $d $ is not small enough, always the generated key\nsequence is not uniform. Now one needs the reconstruction of the evaluation of\nthe trace distance if one wants to use it. One should first go back to the\nindistinguishability theory in the computational complexity based, and to\nclarify the meaning of the value of the variational distance. In addition, the\nsame analysis for the information theoretic case is necessary. The recent\nserial papers by H.P.Yuen have given the answer on such questions. In this\npaper, we show more concise description of Yuen's theory, and clarify that the\nrecent upper bound theories for the trace distance by Tomamichel et al and\nHayashi et al are constructed based on the reasoning of Renner and it is\nunsuitable as the analysis for information theoretic security.

High crystal costs primarily result from property non-uniformity\nthat causes low manufacturing yield.

We introduce two Monte\nCarlo (MC) simulation approaches for studying such systems, with both\napproaches giving the choice between different calculi (in particular, Ito,\nStratonovich, and \"isothermal\"). To demonstrate these approaches, we study the\ndiffusion on a 1D interval of a particle released at an interface (in the\nmiddle of the system) between two media where this particle has different\ndiffusivities (e.g., two fluids with different viscosities). For reflecting\nboundary conditions at the ends of the interval, a discontinuity at the\ninterface in the stationary-state particle distribution is found, except for\nthe isothermal case, as expected. We also study the first-passage problem using\nabsorbing boundary conditions. Good agreement is found when comparing the MC\napproaches to theory as well as Brownian and Langevin dynamics simulations.\nAlso, the results themselves turn out to be interesting. For instance: 1) for\nsome calculi, there are more particles on the low-viscosity side (LVS) at\nearlier times and then fewer particles at later times; 2) there is no\npreference to end up on a particular wall for the Ito variant, but a bias\ntowards the wall on the LVS in all other cases; 3) the mean first-passage time\nto the wall on the LVS grows as the viscosity on the other side is increased,\nexcept for the isothermal case where it approaches a constant; 4) when the\nviscosity ratio is high, the first-passage-time distribution for the wall on\nthe LVS is much broader than for the other wall, with a power-law dependence of\nthe former in a certain time interval whose exponent depends on the calculus.\n","Comment: 31 pages, 12 figures, 1 table"]}]

The analysis of the outermost\nbulge area reveals a well-defined sequence of late K and M dwarfs, seen at\n(J-Ks) ~ 0.7-0.9 mag and Ks~14 mag. The interpretation of the CMD yields\nimportant information about the MW bulge, showing the fingerprint of its\nstructure and content. We report a well-defined red dwarf sequence in the\noutermost bulge, which is important for the planetary transit searches of VVV.\nThe double RC in magnitude seen in the outer bulge is the signature of the\nX-shaped MW bulge, while the spreading of the RC in colour are caused by\nreddening effects.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 8 figures"]}]

Using observational parameters of four historical remnants, we\ncalculate the filament profiles and compare the spectra of the filaments with\nthose of the total non-thermal emission.

Concerning the title's subject, a perfect theory would require\nthat the true vacuum expectation value of the operator associated with pair\nproduction, be compatible with the normalization of the true vacuum. At\npresent, a calculation of the vacuum energy based on Feynman diagrams reveals a\nserious difficulty: if only second order terms of the S-matrix are retained,\nand because there are no external lines, it follows that the space-time\nintegrations over the coordinates, involved in the calculation of the vacuum\nexpectation value of the S-matrix, give rise to two identical delta functions:\nthe amplitude is thus proportional to the space-time volume of integration, L4.\nThe square of the amplitude defies then any physically meaningful\ninterpretation. One is faced here with two evils: modify the interaction\nLagrangian so that the amplitude becomes proportional to L2, or abstain from\nany calculation. It is felt that the first one is the lesser evil. If the\nsquare of the amplitude is proportional to L4 (instead of L8), it, can be\ninterpreted as being the number, N, of events (pairs created), in the volume of\nintegration. In the calculations for N it was assumed that the integral over\nmomentums (rescaled to be dimensionless) was of the order unity, and that\nprocesses with small virtual photon-energy are predominant. The pairs'\ncontribution to the vacuum density is then given by the mass of the particles\nmultiplied, by the number of events per unit volume and unit time, as well as,\nby the pairs lifetime.

Methods: In a previous work, we ran full 3D,\ntwo-fluid Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of a planet\nembedded in a gas+dust T Tauri disk for different planet masses and grain\nsizes. In this work, the resulting dust distributions are passed to the Monte\nCarlo radiative transfer code MCFOST to construct synthetic images in the ALMA\nwavebands. We then use the ALMA simulator to produce images that include\nthermal and phase noise for a range of angular resolutions, wavelengths, and\nintegration times, as well as for different inclinations, declinations and\ndistances. We also produce images which assume that gas and dust are well mixed\nwith a gas-to-dust ratio of 100 to compare with previous ALMA predictions, all\nmade under this hypothesis. Results: Our findings clearly demonstrate the\nimportance of correctly incorporating the dust dynamics. We show that the gap\ncarved by a 1 M_J planet orbiting at 40 AU is visible with a much higher\ncontrast than the well-mixed assumption would predict. In the case of a 5 M_J\nplanet, we clearly see a deficit in dust emission in the inner disk, and point\nout the risk of interpreting the resulting image as that of a transition disk\nwith an inner hole if observed in unfavorable conditions. Planet signatures are\nfainter in more distant disks but declination or inclination to the\nline-of-sight have little effect on ALMA's ability to resolve the gaps.\nConclusions: ALMA has the potential to see signposts of planets in disks of\nnearby star-forming regions.
