We derive the formal structure of the\nLPT series expansion, working to arbitrary order in the initial perturbation\namplitude. The factors that regulate LPT convergence are identified by studying\nthe exact, analytic solution expanded according to this formal structure. The\nkey methodology is to complexify the exact solution, demonstrate that it is\nanalytic and apply well-known convergence criteria for power series expansions\nof analytic functions.This analysis fully explains the previously reported\nobservation that LPT fails to predict the evolution of an underdense, open\nregion beyond a certain time. It also implies the existence of other examples,\nincluding overdense, closed regions, for which LPT predictions should also\nfail. We show that this is indeed the case by numerically computing the LPT\nexpansion in these problematic cases. The formal limitations to the validity of\nLPT expansion are considerably more complicated than simply the first\noccurrence of orbit crossings as is often assumed. Evolution to a future time\ngenerically requires re-expanding the solution in overlapping domains that\nultimately link the initial and final times, each domain subject to its own\nconvergence criterion. We demonstrate that it is possible to handle all the\nproblematic cases by taking multiple steps (LPT re-expansion). We characterize\nhow the leading order numerical error for a solution generated by LPT re-\nexpansion varies with the choice of Lagrangian order and of time step size.\nConvergence occurs when the Lagrangian order increases and/or the time step\nsize decreases in a simple, well-defined manner.

We present the M*-Mh relation for centrals at z~1.\nAt z~1, the dependence of quenching on M* at fixed Mh is somewhat more\npronounced than at z~0, but the quenched fraction is low (10%) and the haloes\nare less massive. For satellites, M*-dependent quenching is noticeable at high\nD, suggesting a quenching dependence on sub-halo mass for recently captured\nsatellites. At small D, where satellites likely fell in more than a few Gyr\nago, quenching strongly depends on Mh, and not on M*. The Mh-dependence of\nquenching is consistent with theoretical wisdom where virial shock heating in\nmassive haloes shuts down accretion and triggers ram-pressure stripping,\ncausing quenching.

Thus, the former predictions of the insulator gap, antiferromagnetic\ncharacter and the existence of a paramagnetic-pseudogap state, become natural\nones to be expected from this more general picture. The effect of hole doping\non the antiferromagnetic-insulator state (AFI) and the paramagnetic-pseudogap\none, is investigated. The results predict a quantum phase transition (QPT) from\nthe AFI state at low doping to a paramagnetic-metallic state (PM) at higher\nhole densities. Therefore, a clear description of the hidden QPT laying beneath\nthe dome in high critical temperature superconducting materials is found. At\nlow doping, the system prefers the AFI state, and at the critical value of the\ndoping density 0.2, the energy of a metallic state becomes lower. The evolution\nwith small doping values of the band spectrum of the AFI state, shows that the\nholes tend to become localized at the middle of the sides of the reduced\nBrillouin zone (BZ). Then, around the critical value, the holes of the AFI\nstate move to become situated at the corners of the same reduced BZ, showing a\nstructural change at the phase transition point. Thus, the PM state appearing\nat the QPT acquires the same behavior with respect to the position of holes as\nthe pseudogap state. In the small doping limit a clear difference between the\ndegree of convergence of the iterative self-consistent solution is associated\nto an even or odd number of electrons.

Consequently, by supplementing the Hamiltonian of\nthe SU(N) model with a perturbation Hamiltonian that removes the GS degeneracy,\nthe LT is to apply also for the SU(N) model in the limit of the coupling\nconstant, \\lambda, of this perturbation approaching zero, where the limit\n\\lambda --> 0 is clearly to be taken subsequent to taking the zero-temperature\nlimit of the thermal single-particle Green function in the expression for the\nLuttinger number N_L. We explicitly establish the validity of this statement\nfor the case of N=4. The details of the relevant calculations being distinctly\ntransparent, one can readily convince oneself that our observation is valid for\narbitrary N. It follows that the issues raised by DPK, such as non-existence of\nthe Luttinger-Ward functional and \"breakdown of the elemental particle picture\nin strongly correlated electron matter\", are all inessential to the observed\nfailure of the LT. As regards the singularity of the self-energy \\Sigma(\\omega)\non the real \\omega-axis, observed by DPK, we demonstrate that this also is a\ndirect consequence of the non-uniqueness of the GS of the SU(N) model for 0 < n\n< N.

Current approaches, whose complexity is so\nhigh that their practical applicability is limited, either require the\nexistence of extra network resources like virtual channels, or they affect the\nperformance of the network during the reconfiguration process. In this paper we\npresent a simple, fast and efficient mechanism for dynamic network\nreconfiguration which is based on regressive deadlock recoveries instead of\navoiding deadlocks.

DBR allows cycles to be formed and in such conditions when\na deadlock occurs, the messages suffer from time-out. Then, this method\nreleases the buffers and channels from the current node and thus the source\nretransmits the message after a random time gap.

Previously explored possible\nexplanations have included a secondary neutron-burst process occurring in the\nHe-shell of a type II supernova (SN), as well as a rapid separation, between\nunstable precursor isobars of a primary r-process, and stable Xe isotopes. Here\nwe present results from the investigation of a rapid neutron-capture scenario\nin core-collapse SNe with different non-standard r-process variants. Our\ncalculations are performed in the framework of the high-entropy-wind (HEW)\nscenario using updated nuclear-physics input. We explore the consequences of\nvarying the wind expansion velocity (Vexp) for selected electron fractions (Ye)\nwith their correlated entropy ranges (S), and neutron-freezeout temperatures\n(T9(freeze)) and timescales (tau-r(freeze). We draw several conclusions: For\nXe-H a \"cold\" r-process with a fast freezeout seems to be the favored scenario.\nFurthermore, eliminating the low-S range (i.e. the \"weak\" r-process component)\nand maintaining a pure \"main\" or even \"strong\" r-process leads to an optimum\noverall agreement with the measured iXe/136Xe abundance ratios. Our results can\nprovide valuable additional insight into overall astrophysical conditions of\nproducing the r-process part of the total SS heavy elements in explosive\nnucleosynthesis scenarios.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 2 figures XII International Symposium on Nuclei in the\n  Cosmos, August 5-12, 2012, Cairns, Australia"]}]
