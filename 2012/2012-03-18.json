Let $S$ be a\ncompact orientable surface, possibly with boundary, and let $\\Diff(S)_0$ denote\nthe identity component of the group of $C^1$ diffeomorphisms of $S$. Our main\nresult is that if $S$ has genus at least two, and $f$ is a distortion element\nin some finitely generated subgroup of $\\Diff(S)_0$, then $\\supp(\\mu) \\subseteq\n\\Fix(f)$ for every $f$-invariant Borel probability measure $\\mu$. Under a small\nadditional hypothesis the same holds in lower genus.\n  For $\\mu$ a Borel probability measure on $S$, denote the group of $C^1$\ndiffeomorphisms that preserve $\\mu$ by $\\Diff_\\mu(S)$. Our main result implies\nthat a large class of higher-rank lattices admit no homomorphisms to\n$\\Diff_{\\mu}(S)$ with infinite image. These results generalize those of Franks\nand Handel to surfaces with boundary.\n","Comment: 13 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:math/0404532"]}]
