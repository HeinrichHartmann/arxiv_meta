The\nchaotic Hamiltonian H\\'{e}non-Heiles system for motion of stars orbiting in a\nplane about the galactic center is used as an example to show its basic ideas\nand validity. Based on Taylor expansion at rather high-order and MP (multiple\nprecision) data in very high accuracy, the CNS approach can provide reliable\ntrajectories of the chaotic system in a finite interval $t\\in[0,T_c]$, together\nwith an explicit estimation of the critical time $T_c$.

In this way, the numerical noises of the CNS can be reduced\nto a required level, i.e. the CNS is a rigorous algorithm.

The family consists of Haumea and at least ten other ~100km-sized\ntrans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) located in the region a = 42 - 44.5 AU. In this\nwork, we model the long-term orbital evolution of an ensemble of fragments\nrepresenting hypothetical post-collision distributions at the time of the\nfamily's birth. We consider three distinct scenarios, in which the kinetic\nenergy of dispersed particles were varied such that their mean ejection\nvelocities (veje) were of order 200 m/s, 300 m/s and 400 m/s, respectively.\nEach simulation considered resulted in collisional families that reproduced\nthat currently observed. The results suggest that 60-75% of the fragments\ncreated in the collision will remain in the trans-Neptunian belt, even after 4\nGyr of dynamical evolution. The surviving particles were typically concentrated\nin wide regions of orbital element space centred on the initial impact\nlocation, with their orbits spread across a region spanning {\\Delta}a ~ 6-12\nAU, {\\Delta}e ~ 0.1-0.15 and {\\Delta}i ~ 7-10{\\deg}. Most of the survivors\npopulated the so-called Classical and Detached regions of the trans-Neptunian\nbelt, whilst a minor fraction entered the Scattered Disk reservoir (<1%), or\nwere captured in Neptunian mean motion resonances (<10%).

Moreover, the conductivity of ~10^4\nohm^-1cm^-1 reached at the latter carrier density is comparable to the highest\nvalue. We attribute the high mobility to several physical properties of\n(Ba,La)SnO3: a small effective mass coming from the ideal Sn-O-Sn bonding,\nsmall disorder effects due to the doping away from the SnO2 conduction channel,\nand reduced carrier scattering due to the high dielectric constant. The\nobservation of a reduced mobility of ~70 cm^2(Vs)^-1 in the film is mainly\nattributed to additional carrier-scatterings which are presumably created by\nthe lattice mismatch between the substrate SrTiO3 and (Ba,La)SnO3. The main\noptical gap of (Ba,La)SnO3 single crystals remained at about 3.33 eV and the\nin-gap states only slightly increased, thus maintaining optical transparency in\nthe visible region.

First, the cascading effect has been simulated on three\nwell known networks: the IEEE 300 bus test system, the IEEE 118 bus test\nsystem, and the WSCC 179 bus equivalent model. To extend the analysis to a\nlarger set of networks, we develop a network generator and generate multiple\ngraphs with characteristics similar to the IEEE test networks but with\ndifferent topologies.

The generated graphs turn out to be more robust\nthan the test graphs, showing the importance of topology in the robust design\nof power grids. The second part of this paper concerns the discussion of two\nnovel mitigation strategies for cascading failures: Targeted Load Reduction and\nIslanding using Distributed Sources. These new mitigation strategies are\ncompared with the Homogeneous Load Reduction strategy. Even though the\nHomogeneous Load Reduction is simpler to implement, the Targeted Load Reduction\nis much more effective.

One property\nof this behavior is that, independent of initial conditions, the minimum radius\nexhibits power law scaling with the time left to breakup tau. Because they have\nadditional structure and shear dependent viscosity, liquid crystals pose an\ninteresting complication to such studies. Here, we investigate the breakup of a\nsynthetic nematic liquid crystal known as MBBA. We determine the phase of the\nsolution by using a cross polarizer setup in situ with the liquid bridge\nbreakup apparatus. Consistent with previous studies of scaling behavior in\nviscous-inertial fluid breakup, when MBBA is in the isotropic phase, the\nminimum radius decreases as tau^{1.03 \\pm 0.04}. In the nematic phase however,\nwe observe very different thinning behavior. Our measurements of the thinning\nprofile are consistent with two interpretations. In the first interpretation,\nthe breakup is universal and consists of two different regimes. The first\nregime is characterized by a symmetric profile with a single minimum whose\nradius decreases as tau^{1.51 \\pm 0.06}. The second and final regime is\ncharacterized by two minima whose radii decrease as tau^{0.52 \\pm 0.11}. These\nresults are in excellent agreement with previous measurements of breakup in the\nnematic phase of liquid crystal 8CB and 5CB. Interestingly, we find that the\nentire thinning behavior can also be fit with an exponential decay such that\nR_{min} \\sim exp((1.2\\times 10^2 Hz) tau). This dependence is more reminiscent\nof breakup in polymers where entropic stretching slows the thinning process. An\nanalogous mechanism for slowing in liquid crystals could arise from the role\nplayed by topological constraints governing defect dynamics. Consistent with\nthis interpretation, crossed polarizer images indicate that significant\nalignment of the liquid crystal domains occurs during breakup.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 9 figures.

The average coefficient of\nthe piezoelectric frequency effect is as low as several hundred nano-Hz per\nmillivolt, implying that the most precise (nano-Hz) yet fast-response\nvoltage-controlled oscillators and phase-locked loops can be built.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures"]}]

It is shown that on unweighted undirected $n$-node\ngraphs, the problem of finding the minimum exposure path connecting a given\npair of vertices is strongly inapproximable, i.e., hard to approximate within a\nfactor of $O(2^{\\log^{1-\\epsilon}n})$ for any $\\epsilon>0$ (under an\nappropriate complexity assumption), but is approximable with ratio\n$\\sqrt{\\Delta}+3$, where $\\Delta$ is the maximum degree in the graph. One of\nour main results concerns the class of bounded-degree graphs, which is shown to\nexhibit the following interesting dichotomy. On the one hand, the minimum\nexposure path problem is NP-hard on node-weighted or directed bounded-degree\ngraphs (even when the maximum degree is 4). On the other hand, we present a\npolynomial algorithm (based on a nontrivial dynamic program) for the problem on\nunweighted undirected bounded-degree graphs. Likewise, the problem is shown to\nbe polynomial also for the class of (weighted or unweighted) bounded-treewidth\ngraphs.\n"]}]

In early 1995, a DSM\npilot initiative has been launched in the french islands of Guadeloupe and\nReunion through a partnership between the French Public Utility EDF,\ninstitutions involved in energy conservation, environment preservation (ADEME)\nand construction quality improvment, the University of Reunion Island and\nseveral other public and private partners (low cost housing institutions,\narchitects, energy consultant, etc...) to set up a standard in the thermal\nconception of buildings in tropical climates. This has led to definition of\noptimized bioclimatic urban planning and architectural design, the use of\npassive cooling architectural components, natural ventilation and energy\nefficient systems. The impact of each technical solution on the thermal comfort\nwithin the building was evaluated with an airflow and thermal building\nsimulation software (CODYRUN). These technical solutions have been edited in a\npedagogical reference document and have been implemented in 300 new pilot\ndwelling projects through the year 1996 in Reunion Island and in Guadeloupe\nisland. An experimental follow up is still in process in the first ECODOM\ndwellings for an experimental validation of the impact of the passive cooling\nsolutions on the comfort of the occupants and to modify them if necessary.\n","Comment: ISES'99, International Solar Energy Society, J\\'erusalem : Israel\n  (1999). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1212.3925,\n  arXiv:1212.5252"]}]

However, applications\nwith input-dependent noise (heteroscedastic residuals) frequently arise in\npractice, as do applications in which the residuals do not have a Gaussian\ndistribution. In this paper, we propose a GP Regression model with a latent\nvariable that serves as an additional unobserved covariate for the regression.\nThis model (which we call GPLC) allows for heteroscedasticity since it allows\nthe function to have a changing partial derivative with respect to this\nunobserved covariate. With a suitable covariance function, our GPLC model can\nhandle (a) Gaussian residuals with input-dependent variance, or (b)\nnon-Gaussian residuals with input-dependent variance, or (c) Gaussian residuals\nwith constant variance. We compare our model, using synthetic datasets, with a\nmodel proposed by Goldberg, Williams and Bishop (1998), which we refer to as\nGPLV, which only deals with case (a), as well as a standard GP model which can\nhandle only case (c). Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are developed for both\nmodelsl. Experiments show that when the data is heteroscedastic, both GPLC and\nGPLV give better results (smaller mean squared error and negative\nlog-probability density) than standard GP regression. In addition, when the\nresidual are Gaussian, our GPLC model is generally nearly as good as GPLV,\nwhile when the residuals are non-Gaussian, our GPLC model is better than GPLV.\n"]}]

First-passage competition is\na stochastic process modeling two infections spreading outward from initially\noccupied disjoint subsets of $Z^d$. Each infecting species transmits its\ninfection at random times from previously infected sites to neighboring\nuninfected sites. The infection times are governed by species-specific\nprobability distributions, and every vertex of $Z^d$ remains permanently\ninfected by whichever species infects it first.\n  We introduce a new, simple construction of first-passage competition that\nworks for an arbitrary pair of disjoint starting sets in $Z^d$, and we\nanalogously define a deterministic first-passage competition process in the\nEuclidean space $R^d$, providing a formal definition for a model of crystal\ngrowth that has previously been studied computationally. We then prove large\ndeviations estimates for the random $Z^d$-process, showing that on large scales\nit is well-approximated by the deterministic $R^d$-process, with high\nprobability. Analyzing the geometry of the deterministic process allows us to\nidentify critical phenomena in the random process when one of the two species\ninitially occupies the entire exterior of a cone and the other species\ninitially occupies a single interior site. Our results generalize those in a\n2007 paper of Deijfen and H\\\"aggstr\\\"om, who considered the case where the cone\nis a half-space. Moreover, we use our results about competition in cones to\nstrengthen a 2000 result of H\\\"aggstr\\\"om and Pemantle about competition from\nfinite starting configurations.\n","Comment: Ph.D. Dissertation (University of Washington, Mathematics), vi+290\n  pages"]}]
