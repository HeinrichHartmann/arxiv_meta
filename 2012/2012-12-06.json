This sharply contrasts the progress of the theory of Tikhonov\nregularization, where a series of new results for regularization in Banach\nspaces has been published in the recent years. The present paper intends to\nbridge the gap between the existing theories as far as possible. We develop a\nstability and convergence theory for the residual method in general topological\nspaces. In addition, we prove convergence rates in terms of (generalized)\nBregman distances, which can also be applied to non-convex regularization\nfunctionals. We provide three examples that show the applicability of our\ntheory. The first example is the regularized solution of linear operator\nequations on $L^p$-spaces, where we show that the results of Tikhonov\nregularization generalize unchanged to the residual method. As a second\nexample, we consider the problem of density estimation from a finite number of\nsampling points, using the Wasserstein distance as a fidelity term and an\nentropy measure as regularization term. It is shown that the densities obtained\nin this way depend continuously on the location of the sampled points and that\nthe underlying density can be recovered as the number of sampling points tends\nto infinity.

By tuning the\nartificial fluxes or in the presence of disorder, the flat band can also\nacquire a bandwidth in energy allowing the coexistence between chiral edge\nmodes and bulk extended states; in this case the chiral modes become fragile\ntowards scattering into the bulk.

The algorithm runs in\nO(n^2/eps^2) time, and approximates Per(A) to within eps*||A||^n additive\nerror. A major advantage of Gurvits's algorithm is that it works for arbitrary\nmatrices, not just for nonnegative matrices. This makes it highly relevant to\nquantum optics, where the permanents of bounded-norm complex matrices play a\ncentral role. Indeed, the existence of Gurvits's algorithm is why, in their\nrecent work on the hardness of quantum optics, Aaronson and Arkhipov (AA) had\nto talk about sampling problems rather than estimation problems.\n  In this paper, we improve Gurvits's algorithm in two ways. First, using an\nidea from quantum optics, we generalize the algorithm so that it yields a\nbetter approximation when the matrix A has either repeated rows or repeated\ncolumns. Translating back to quantum optics, this lets us classically estimate\nthe probability of any outcome of an AA-type experiment---even an outcome\ninvolving multiple photons \"bunched\" in the same mode---at least as well as\nthat probability can be estimated by the experiment itself. (This does not, of\ncourse, let us solve the AA sampling problem.) It also yields a general upper\nbound on the probabilities of \"bunched\" outcomes, which resolves a conjecture\nof Gurvits and might be of independent physical interest.\n  Second, we use eps-biased sets to derandomize Gurvits's algorithm, in the\nspecial case where the matrix A is nonnegative. More interestingly, we\ngeneralize the notion of eps-biased sets to the complex numbers, construct\n\"complex eps-biased sets,\" then use those sets to derandomize even our\ngeneralization of Gurvits's algorithm to the multirow/multicolumn case (again\nfor nonnegative A). Whether Gurvits's algorithm can be derandomized for general\nA remains an outstanding problem.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 1 figure, minor additions"]}]

The proteins having long extensions buried\nwithin ribosomal RNA have more flexible structures than those found on the\nsubunit surface. Thermus thermophilus ribosomal proteins undergo high\nconformational changes compared to those of Escherichia coli, assuring\nstructural stability at high temperature environment. The general stabilization\nstrategy of ribosomal protein-RNA interfaces is shown, where high interface\npolarity ensures high surface density of Hydrogen bonds even with low\nbase/backbone ratio. Polarity is regulated in evolutionary strategy of\nribosomal proteins. Thus, the habitat environmental conditions of the two\nspecies sweet up their ribosomal protein-RNA interfaces to alter its physical\nparameters in order of stabilization.\n","Comment: 9 pages and 1 figure"]}]

In the next\ntwo sections simplified versions of some components are employed to explore the\neffects of various parameters on spiking, using a systematic approach, ending\nup with the following eleven components: a fast sodium current $I_{Na}$, a\ndelayed rectifier potassium current $I_{KDR}$, a transient potassium current\n$I_A$, a low-threshold calcium current $I_T$, two high threshold calcium\ncurrents $I_L$ and $I_N$, small and large conductance potassium currents\n$I_{SK}$ and $I_{BK}$, a hyperpolarization-activated cation current $I_H$, a\nleak current $I_{Leak}$ and intracellular calcium ion concentration $Ca_i$.\nAttention is focused on the properties usually associated with these neurons,\nparticularly long duration of action potential, pacemaker-like spiking and the\nramp-like return to threshold after a spike. In some cases the membrane\npotential trajectories display doublets or have kinks or notches as have been\nreported in some experimental studies. The computed time courses of $I_A$ and\n$I_T$ during the interspike interval support the generally held view of a\ncompetition between them in influencing the frequency of spiking. Spontaneous\nspiking could be obtained with small changes in a few parameters from their\nvalues with driven spiking.\n","Comment: The abstract has been truncated"]}]
