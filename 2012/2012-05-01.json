The discrete maximum principles are established by\nassuming a property on the discrete variational form that is of global nature.\nIn particular, the assumption on the variational form is verified when the\nfinite element partition satisfies some angle conditions.

However, protection of qubit coherence during a multi-qubit gate poses\na non-trivial problem: in general the decoupling disrupts the inter-qubit\ndynamics, and hence conflicts with gate operation. This problem is particularly\nsalient for hybrid systems, wherein different types of qubits evolve and\ndecohere at vastly different rates.

Since spatial organization can significantly affect\nevolutionary dynamics, the need is growing for evolutionary experiments in\nspatially structured environments. The surface of a Petri dish provides such an\nenvironment, but a more detailed understanding of microbial growth on Petri\ndishes is necessary to interpret such experiments. We formulate a simple\ndeterministic reaction-diffusion model, which successfully predicts the spatial\npatterns created by two competing species during colony expansion. We also\nderive the shape of these patterns analytically without relying on microscopic\ndetails of the model. In particular, we find that the relative fitness of two\nmicrobial strains can be estimated from the logarithmic spirals created by\nselective sweeps. The theory is tested with strains of the budding yeast\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae, for spatial competitions with different initial\nconditions and for a range of relative fitnesses. The reaction-diffusion model\nalso connects the microscopic parameters like growth rates and diffusion\nconstants with macroscopic spatial patterns and predicts the relationship\nbetween fitness in liquid cultures and on Petri dishes, which we confirmed\nexperimentally.

The technique exploits the propagation of query bindings and extends\nthe Magic Set (MS) optimization technique.\n  An important feature of disjunctive Datalog is nonmonotonicity, which calls\nfor nondeterministic implementations, such as backtracking search. A\ndistinguishing characteristic of the new method is that the optimization can be\nexploited also during the nondeterministic phase. In particular, after some\nassumptions have been made during the computation, parts of the program may\nbecome irrelevant to a query under these assumptions. This allows for dynamic\npruning of the search space. In contrast, the effect of the previously defined\nMS methods for disjunctive Datalog is limited to the deterministic portion of\nthe process. In this way, the potential performance gain by using the proposed\nmethod can be exponential, as could be observed empirically.\n  The correctness of MS is established thanks to a strong relationship between\nMS and unfounded sets that has not been studied in the literature before. This\nknowledge allows for extending the method also to programs with stratified\nnegation in a natural way.\n  The proposed method has been implemented in DLV and various experiments have\nbeen conducted. Experimental results on synthetic data confirm the utility of\nMS for disjunctive Datalog, and they highlight the computational gain that may\nbe obtained by the new method w.r.t. the previously proposed MS methods for\ndisjunctive Datalog programs. Further experiments on real-world data show the\nbenefits of MS within an application scenario that has received considerable\nattention in recent years, the problem of answering user queries over possibly\ninconsistent databases originating from integration of autonomous sources of\ninformation.\n","Comment: 67 pages, 19 figures, preprint submitted to Artificial Intelligence"]}]
