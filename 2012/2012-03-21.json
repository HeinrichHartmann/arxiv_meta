Giant strain\neffects under external fields are obtained in low symmetric modulated\nmartensitic phases. We outline the origin of modulated phases, their connection\nwith tetragonal martensite and consequences for their functional properties by\nanalysing the martensitic microstructure of epitaxial Ni-Mn-Ga films from the\natomic to macroscale. Geometrical constraints at an austenite-martensite phase\nboundary act down to the atomic scale. Hence a martensitic microstructure of\nnanotwinned tetragonal martensite can form. Coarsening of twin variants can\nreduce twin boundary energy, a process we could follow from the atomic to the\nmillimetre scale. Coarsening is a fractal process, proceeding in discrete steps\nby doubling twin periodicity. The collective defect energy results in a\nsubstantial hysteresis, which allows retaining modulated martensite as a\nmetastable phase at room temperature. In this metastable state elastic energy\nis released by the formation of a 'twins within twins' microstructure which can\nbe observed from the nanometre to millimetre scale. This hierarchical twinning\nresults in mesoscopic twin boundaries which are diffuse, in contrast to the\ncommon atomically sharp twin boundaries of tetragonal martensite. We suggest\nthat observed extraordinarily high mobility of such mesoscopic twin boundaries\noriginates from their diffuse nature which renders pinning by atomistic point\ndefects ineffective.\n","Comment: 34 pages, 8 figures"]}]

The effect of the energy gap to the uncertainties is shown to\nappear via the Compton-like wavelength $\\lambda_c$. The uncertainties in the\ngraphene are mainly contributed by two phenomena, spreading and zitterbewegung.\nWhile the former determines the uncertainties in the long-range of time, the\nlatter gives the highly oscillation to the uncertainties in the short-range of\ntime. The uncertainties in the graphene are compared with the corresponding\nvalues for the usual free Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_{free} = (p_1^2 + p_2^2) / 2 M$.\nIt is shown that the uncertainties can be under control within the quantum\nmechanical law if one can choose the gap parameter $\\lambda_c$ freely.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 11 figures V2: 21 pages, one more author is added. will\n  appear in PRB"]}]

Although the\nnumerically illustrated results from dataset revealed that PCA has explained\nmost of the cumulative variance of data but in reality when the very large\ndimensional cell formation problem based on sequence is available then to\nobtain the clustering structure from PCA projection is become very difficult.\nMost importantly, in the visual clustering of ordinal data, the use of U-matrix\nalone can not be efficient to get the cluster structure but with color\nextraction, hit map, labeling via the SOM node map it becomes a powerful\nclustering visualization methodology and thus the present research contribute\nsignificantly in the research of cellular manufacturing.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 8 tables, 6 figures"]}]

Today, there is limited experience in the deployment of QoS\nfor IPv6 traffic in MPLS backbone networks in conjunction with DiffServ\n(Differentiated Services) support. DiffServ itself does not have the ability to\ncontrol the traffic which has been taken for end-to-end path while a number of\nlinks of the path are congested.

Proton-neutron quasi-particle random phase\napproximation (pn-QRPA) theory has recently being used for a microscopic\ncalculation of stellar weak interaction rates of iron isotopes with success.\nHere I present the detailed calculation of neutrino and antineutrino cooling\nrates due to key iron isotopes in stellar matter using the pn-QRPA theory. The\nrates are calculated on a fine grid of temperature-density scale suitable for\ncore-collapse simulators. The calculated rates are compared against earlier\ncalculations. The neutrino cooling rates due to isotopes of iron are in overall\ngood agreement with the rates calculated using the large-scale shell model.\nDuring the presupernova evolution of massive stars, from oxygen shell burning\ntill around end of convective core silicon burning phases, the calculated\nneutrino cooling rates due to $^{54}$Fe are three to four times larger than the\ncorresponding shell model rates. The Brink's hypothesis used in previous\ncalculations can at times lead to erroneous results. The Brink's hypothesis\nassumes that the Gamow-Teller strength distributions for all excited states are\nthe same. It is, however, shown by the present calculation that both the\ncentroid and total strength for excited states differ appreciably from the\nground state distribution. These changes in the strength distributions of\nthermally populated excited states can alter the total weak interaction rates\nrather significantly. The calculated antineutrino cooling rates, due to\npositron capture and $\\beta$-decay of iron isotopes, are orders of magnitude\nsmaller than the corresponding neutrino cooling rates and can safely be\nneglected specially at low temperatures and high stellar densities.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables"]}]

Well-known GP mechanisms, such as type classes and the C++0x\nconcepts proposal, usually combine two features: 1) a special type of\ninterfaces; and 2) implicit instantiation of implementations of those\ninterfaces.\n  Scala implicits are a GP language mechanism, inspired by type classes, that\nbreak with the tradition of coupling implicit instantiation with a special type\nof interface. Instead, implicits provide only implicit instantiation, which is\ngeneralized to work for any types. This turns out to be quite powerful and\nuseful to address many limitations that show up in other GP mechanisms.\n  This paper synthesizes the key ideas of implicits formally in a minimal and\ngeneral core calculus called the implicit calculus, and it shows how to build\nsource languages supporting implicit instantiation on top of it. A novelty of\nthe calculus is its support for partial resolution and higher-order rules (a\nfeature that has been proposed before, but was never formalized or\nimplemented). Ultimately, the implicit calculus provides a formal model of\nimplicits, which can be used by language designers to study and inform\nimplementations of similar mechanisms in their own languages.\n","Comment: 13 pages, extended report of paper accepted at PLDI 2012"]}]
