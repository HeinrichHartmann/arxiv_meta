Correspondence with the QCD diagrams at the\nboundary rapidities requires pomeron interaction with the participating nuclei\nto be exponential and non-local. Commonly used 'eikonal' boundary conditions,\nlocal and linear in fields, follow in the limit of small QCD pomeron-nucleon\ncoupling. Numerical solution of the classical field equations, which sum all\ntree diagrams for central gold-gold scattering, demonstrates that corrected\nboundary conditions lead to substantially different results, as compared to the\neikonal conditions studied in earlier publications. A breakdown of\nprojectile-target symmetry for particular solutions discovered earlier in\n  \\cite{bom} is found to occur at roughly twice lower rapidity. Most important,\ndue to a high non-linearity of the problem, the found asymmetric solutions are\nnot unique but form a family growing in number with rapidity.

An\naspect of graph algorithms that has hitherto not received much interest is the\neffect of memory hierarchy on accesses. A typical system today has multiple\nlevels in the memory hierarchy with differing units of locality; ranging across\ncache lines, TLB entries and DRAM pages. We postulate that it is possible to\nallocate graph structured data in main memory in a way as to improve the\nspatial locality of the data. Previous approaches to improving cache locality\nhave focused only on a single unit of locality, either the cache line or\nvirtual memory page.

Our motivation comes from our theorem\nthat generalizes the Nordhaus-Gaddum theorem to the distinguishing chromatic\nnumber: for any graph G, the distinguishing chromatic number of G plus the\ndistinguishing chromatic number of G complement is less than or equal to the\nnumber of vertices of G plus the distinguishing number of G. Finally, we\ncharacterize those graphs that achieve equality in the sum upper bounds\nsimultaneously for both the chromatic number and for our distinguishing\nchromatic number analog of the Nordhaus-Gaddum inequality.\n","Comment: 18 pages"]}]

We measure the static piezoelectric response of a quartz tuning\nfork and find it to be highly linear, non-hysteretic and with negligible creep.\nThese performance characteristics, close to those of an ideal transducer, make\nquartz transducers superior to ceramic piezoelectric actuators. Furthermore,\nquartz actuators in the form of a tuning fork have the advantage of yielding\nstatic displacements comparable to those of local probe microscope scanners. We\nuse the static displacement of a quartz tuning fork as a reference to calibrate\nthe three axis displacement of a ceramic piezoelectric scanner. Although this\ncalibration technique is a non-traceable method, it can be more versatile than\nusing calibration grids because it enables to characterize the linear and\nnon-linear response of a piezoelectric scanner in a broad range of\ndisplacements, spanning from a fraction of a nanometer to hundreds of\nnanometers. In addition, the creep and the speed dependent piezoelectric\nresponse of ceramic scanners can be studied in detail.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 3 figures"]}]

One of\nthese conditions is that there exists a known transform that represents the\nsignal with a sufficiently small number of non-zero coefficients. However when\nthe signal to be reconstructed is composed of moving images or volumes, it is\nchallenging to form such regularization constraints with traditional transforms\nsuch as wavelets. In this paper, we present a motion compensating prior for\nsuch signals that is derived directly from the optical flow constraint and can\nutilize the motion information during compressed sensing reconstruction.\nProposed regularization method can be used in a wide variety of applications\ninvolving compressed sensing and images or volumes of moving and deforming\nobjects. It is also shown that it is possible to estimate the signal and the\nmotion jointly or separately. Practical examples from magnetic resonance\nimaging has been presented to demonstrate the benefit of the proposed method.\n","Comment: Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing"]}]
