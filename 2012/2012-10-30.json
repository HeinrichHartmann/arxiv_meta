As a consequence, this\nresult could turn Washington's heuristic arguments, in a certain sense into an\nargument in favor of Vandiver's conjecture.\n","Comment: In sequel to an interesting discussion with a colleague, I decided to\n  add the details of three variants of the proof of the theorem in this paper.\n  The detail may reveal to be helpful for those who are worried to understand\n  the difference between the p-th cyclotomic field and some real quadratic\n  fields in which phenomena of the type investigated in the paper do occur"]}]

However in many practical situations of interest, models are\nconstrained structurally so that they only have a few degrees of freedom\nrelative to their ambient dimension. This paper provides a general framework to\nconvert notions of simplicity into convex penalty functions, resulting in\nconvex optimization solutions to linear, underdetermined inverse problems. The\nclass of simple models considered are those formed as the sum of a few atoms\nfrom some (possibly infinite) elementary atomic set; examples include\nwell-studied cases such as sparse vectors and low-rank matrices, as well as\nseveral others including sums of a few permutations matrices, low-rank tensors,\northogonal matrices, and atomic measures. The convex programming formulation is\nbased on minimizing the norm induced by the convex hull of the atomic set; this\nnorm is referred to as the atomic norm. The facial structure of the atomic norm\nball carries a number of favorable properties that are useful for recovering\nsimple models, and an analysis of the underlying convex geometry provides sharp\nestimates of the number of generic measurements required for exact and robust\nrecovery of models from partial information. These estimates are based on\ncomputing the Gaussian widths of tangent cones to the atomic norm ball. When\nthe atomic set has algebraic structure the resulting optimization problems can\nbe solved or approximated via semidefinite programming. The quality of these\napproximations affects the number of measurements required for recovery. Thus\nthis work extends the catalog of simple models that can be recovered from\nlimited linear information via tractable convex programming.\n"]}]

Therefore the single field stays closest to the hilltop\nsources the non-Gaussianity. In this case most of axions can be replaced by a\nsingle effective field with a quadratic potential. So our potential will\ncontain two fields. The full cosine is responsible for the axion closest to\nhilltop and quadratic term which is a source for Hubble rate [4].

This method consists of three parts: (a) the received signal is\nspatially filtered to get the signal corresponding to each path, and the signal\ncorresponding to each path is compensated for the Doppler frequency shift in\ntime domain, (b) the Doppler frequency shift-compensated signals of all paths\nare summed together, and (c) the desired information is detected by performing\nFFT on the summed signal after excluding the CP. Moreover, we prove that the\nchannel matrix becomes time-invariant after Doppler frequency shift\ncompensation and the ICI is effectively avoided. Finally, simulation results\nare presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method and compare\nit with the conventional method.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 5 figures"]}]

Secondly, the feedback by photo-ionization and\nphoto-dissociation photons in the first objects is explored with radiation\nhydrodynamic simulations, and it is demonstrated that multiple stars can form\nin a 10^5M_sun halo. Thirdly, the fragmentation of an accretion disk around a\nprimordial protostar is explored with photo-dissociation feedback. As a result,\nit is found that the photo-dissociation can reduce the mass accretion rate onto\nprotostars. Also, protostars as small as 0.8M_sun may be ejected and evolve\nwith keeping their mass, which might be detected as \"real first stars\" in the\nGalactic halo. Finally, state-of-the-art radiation hydrodynamic simulations are\nperformed to investigate the internal ionization of first galaxies and the\nescape of ionizing photons. We find that UV feedback by forming massive stars\nenhances the escape fraction even in a halo as massive as > 6* 10^9M_sun, while\nit reduces the star formation rate significantly. This may have a momentous\nimpact on the cosmic reionization.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 14 figures"]}]

In\nMaker-Breaker games there are two players, denoted by Maker and Breaker. In\neach round, Maker claims one previously unclaimed edge of $G$ and Breaker\nresponds by claiming $b$ previously unclaimed edges. We consider the\nHamiltonicity game, the perfect matching game and the $k$-vertex-connectivity\ngame, where Maker's goal is to build a graph which possesses the relevant\nproperty. Avoider-Enforcer games are the reverse analogue of Maker-Breaker\ngames with a slight modification, where the two players claim at least 1 and at\nleast $b$ previously unclaimed edges per move, respectively, and Avoider aims\nto avoid building a graph which possesses the relevant property.\n  Maker-Breaker games are known to be \"bias-monotone\", that is, if Maker wins\nthe $(1,b)$ game, he also wins the $(1,b-1)$ game. Therefore, it makes sense to\ndefine the critical bias of a game, $b^*$, to be the \"breaking point\" of the\ngame. That is, Maker wins the $(1,b)$ game whenever $b\\leq b^*$ and loses\notherwise. An analogous definition of the critical bias exists for\nAvoider-Enforcer games: here, the critical bias of a game $b^*$ is such that\nAvoider wins the $(1,b)$ game for every $b > b^*$, and loses otherwise.\n  We prove that, for every $p=\\omega(\\frac{\\ln n}{n})$, $G\\sim\\gnp$ is\ntypically such that the critical bias for all the aforementioned Maker-Breaker\ngames is asymptotically $b^*=\\frac{np}{\\ln n}$.

The security of these schemes is phrased in\nterms of an extractor which will recover or retrieve the file given any\n\"proving algorithm\" that has a sufficiently high success probability.\n  This paper treats proof-of-retrievability schemes in the model of\nunconditional security, where an adversary has unlimited computational power.\nIn this case retrievability of the file can be modelled as error-correction in\na certain code. We provide a general analytical framework for such schemes that\nyields exact (non-asymptotic) reductions that precisely quantify conditions for\nextraction to succeed as a function of the success probability of a proving\nalgorithm, and we apply this analysis to several archetypal schemes. In\naddition, we provide a new methodology for the analysis of keyed POR schemes in\nan unconditionally secure setting, and use it to prove the security of a\nmodified version of a scheme due to Shacham and Waters under a slightly\nrestricted attack model, thus providing the first example of a keyed POR scheme\nwith unconditional security. We also show how classical statistical techniques\ncan be used to evaluate whether the responses of the prover are accurate enough\nto permit successful extraction. Finally, we prove a new lower bound on storage\nand communication complexity of POR schemes.\n"]}]

On the other hand, no\nuniversal test for the cryptographic one-wayness of functions (or permutations)\nis known, though the existence of cryptographic pseudorandom generators is\nequivalent to that of cryptographic one-way functions. In the quantum\ncomputation model, Kashefi, Nishimura and Vedral gave a sufficient condition of\n(cryptographic) quantum one-way permutations and conjectured that the condition\nwould be necessary. In this paper, we affirmatively settle their conjecture and\ncomplete a necessary and sufficient for quantum one-way permutations. The\nnecessary and sufficient condition can be regarded as a universal test for\nquantum one-way permutations, since the condition is described as a collection\nof stepwise tests similar to the next bit test for pseudorandom generators.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 3 figures.
