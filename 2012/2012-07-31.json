Using the latest results on the cohesive property of magnetic condensed\nmatter, we quantitatively determine the conditions for surface condensation and\nvacuum gap formation in magnetic neutron stars. We find that condensation can\noccur if the thermal energy kT of the neutron star surface is less than about\n8% of its cohesive energy Q_s, and that a vacuum gap can form if the neutron\nstar's rotation axis and magnetic moment point in opposite directions and kT is\nless than about 4% of Q_s. Thus, vacuum gap accelerators may exist for some\nneutron stars. Motivated by this result, we also study the physics of pair\ncascades in the vacuum gap model for photon emission by accelerating electrons\nand positrons due to both curvature radiation and resonant/nonresonant inverse\nCompton scattering. Our calculations of the condition of cascade-induced vacuum\nbreakdown and the related pulsar death line/boundary generalize previous works\nto the superstrong field regime. We find that inverse Compton scatterings do\nnot produce a sufficient number of high energy photons in the gap and thus do\nnot lead to pair cascades for most neutron star parameters.

In this paper, following the Lyubarskii's general\nscheme, we revisit the power spectral density of luminosity fluctuations by\ntaking into account the role of outflows. Our analysis is based on the\nassumption that the coupling between the local outflow and inflow is weak on\nthe accretion rate fluctuations. We find that, for the inflow mass accretion\nrate $\\dot M \\propto r^{s}$, the power spectrum of flicker noise component will\npresent a power-law distribution $p(f) \\propto f^{-(1+4s/3)}$ for\nadvection-dominated flows. We also obtain descriptions of $p(f)$ for both\nstandard thin discs and neutrino-cooled discs, which show that the power-law\nindex of a neutrino-cooled disc is generally larger than that of a\nphoton-cooled disc. Furthermore, the obtained relationship between $p(f)$ and\n$s$ indicates the possibility of evaluating the strength of outflows by the\npower spectrum in X-ray binaries and gamma-ray bursts. In addition, we discuss\nthe possible influence of the outflow-inflow coupling on our results.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 1 figure, accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

It should be possible, in principle, to\ndetect it for Mercury at a precision level of 10^-4. This level is mainly set\nby the unavoidable systematic errors due to the mismodelling in the Keplerian\nperiod which could not be reduced by accumulating a large number of orbital\nrevolutions. Future missions like Messenger and BepiColombo should allow to\nimprove it by increasing our knowledge of the Mercury's orbital parameters. The\nobservational accuracy is estimated to be 10^-4 from the knowledge of the\nInternational Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) axes. It could be improved by\nobserving as many planetary transits as possible. It is not possible to measure\nsuch an effect in the gravitational field of the Earth by analyzing the motion\nof artificial satellites or the Moon because of the unavoidable systematic\nerrors related to the uncertainties in the Keplerian periods. In the case of\nsome recently discovered exoplanets the problems come from the observational\nerrors which are larger than the relativistic effect.\n","Comment: LateX2e, 5 pages, two-column, no figures, 1 table, 22 references.\n  Accepted for publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society\n  (MNRAS)"]}]
