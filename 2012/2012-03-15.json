During the\nsolution of any problem with Newton's Method, it might happen that some of the\nunknowns satisfy the convergence criteria where the others fail. The\nconvergence happens only when all variables reach to the convergence limit. A\nmethod to reduce the dimension of the overall system by excluding some of the\nunknowns that satisfy an intermediate tolerance is introduced. In this\napproach, a smaller system is solved in less amount of time and already\nestablished local solutions are preserved and kept as constants while the other\nvariables that belong to the \"set\" will be relaxed. To realize the idea, an\nalgorithm is given that utilizes applications of pointers to reduce and\nevaluate the sets. Matrix-free Newton-Krylov Techniques are used on a test\nproblem and it is shown that proposed idea improves the overall convergence.\n"]}]

This formula quantifies the effect of the\ndiamond's boundary conditions on the behavior of typical tilings; in addition,\nit yields a new proof of the arctic circle theorem of Jockusch, Propp, and\nShor. Our approach is to use the saddle point method to estimate certain\nweighted sums of squares of Krawtchouk polynomials (whose relevance to domino\ntilings is demonstrated elsewhere), and to combine these estimates with some\nexponential sum bounds to deduce our final result. This approach generalizes\nstraightforwardly to the case in which the probability distribution on the set\nof tilings incorporates bias favoring horizontal over vertical tiles or vice\nversa. We also prove a fairly general large deviation estimate for domino\ntilings of simply-connected planar regions that implies that some of our\nresults on Aztec diamonds apply to many other similar regions as well.\n","Comment: 42 pages, 7 figures"]}]
