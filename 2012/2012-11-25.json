In it we investigate the behavior of the\nsphere packing density function and derive sufficient conditions for local\noptimality. Using these criteria we prove that perfect, strongly eutactic\nlattices cannot be locally improved to yield a periodic sphere packing with\ngreater density. This applies in particular to the densest known lattice sphere\npackings in dimension $d\\leq 8$ and $d=24$.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 1 table; some corrections, incorporated referee suggestions"]}]
