Mean-payoff automata are finite automata with\nnumerical weights on transitions that assign to each infinite path the long-run\naverage of the transition weights. The class of \\emph{mean-payoff automaton\nexpressions}, introduced in [1], is a class of quantitative languages, which is\nrobust: it is closed under the four pointwise operations of max, min, sum and\nnumerical complement.\"[1] In this paper we improve the computational complexity\nfor solving the classical decision problems for mean-payoff automaton\nexpressions: while the previously best known upper bound was 4EXPTIME, and no\nlower bound was known, we give an optimal PSPACE complete bound. As a\nconsequence we also obtain a conceptually simple algorithm to solve the\nclassical decision problems for mean-payoff automaton expressions.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1006.1492"]}]
