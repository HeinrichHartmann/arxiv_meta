When an electric current flows perpendicular to a\nmagnetic field, a Hall voltage develops in the direction transverse to both the\ncurrent and the field. In semiconductors, this behaviour is routinely used to\nmeasure the density and charge of the current carriers (electrons in conduction\nbands or holes in valence bands) -- internal properties of the system that are\nnot accessible from measurements of the conventional resistance. For strongly\ninteracting electron systems, whose behaviour can be very different from the\nfree electron gas, the Hall effect's sensitivity to internal properties makes\nit a powerful tool; indeed, the quantum Hall effects are named after the tool\nby which they are most distinctly measured instead of the physics from which\nthe phenomena originate.

Despite the wide\napplicability of such a detection algorithm, there has been little success in\nthe development of computationally feasible methods with proveable theoretical\nguarantees for general graph topologies. We cast this as a hypothesis testing\nproblem, and first provide a universal necessary condition for asymptotic\ndistinguishability of the null and alternative hypotheses. We then introduce\nthe spanning tree wavelet basis over graphs, a localized basis that reflects\nthe topology of the graph, and prove that for any spanning tree, this approach\ncan distinguish null from alternative in a low signal-to-noise regime. Lastly,\nwe improve on this result and show that using the uniform spanning tree in the\nbasis construction yields a randomized test with stronger theoretical\nguarantees that in many cases matches our necessary conditions. Specifically,\nwe obtain near-optimal performance in edge transitive graphs, $k$-nearest\nneighbor graphs, and $\\epsilon$-graphs.\n"]}]

Such novel ground states cannot be described within the\nconventionally used mean field theory which separates spin and orbital degrees\nof freedom. Even in cases where the ground states are disentangled,\nspin-orbital entanglement occurs in excited states and may become crucial for a\ncorrect description of physical properties at finite temperature. As an\nimportant example of this behaviour we present spin-orbital entanglement in the\n$R$VO$_3$ perovskites, with $R$=La,Pr,...,Yb,Lu, where such finite temperature\nproperties of these compounds can be understood only using entangled states:\n($i$) thermal evolution of the optical spectral weights, ($ii$) the dependence\nof transition temperatures for the onset of orbital and magnetic order on the\nionic radius in the phase diagram of the $R$VO$_3$ perovskites, and ($iii$)\ndimerization observed in the magnon spectra for the $C$-type antiferromagnetic\nphase of YVO$_3$. Finally, it is shown that joint spin-orbital excitations in\nan ordered phase with coexisting antiferromagnetic and alternating orbital\norder introduces topological constraints for the hole propagation and will thus\nradically modify transport properties in doped Mott insulators where hole\nmotion implies simultaneous spin and orbital excitations.\n","Comment: 54 pages, 15 figures, topical review"]}]

In quantum optics, measurements are\ntypically destructive, so that the state is not available afterwards for\nfurther steps - crucial for sequential measurement schemes. The development of\npractical methods for non-destructive measurements on optical fields is\ntherefore an important topic for future practical quantum information\nprocessing systems. Here we show how to measure the presence or absence of the\nvacuum in a quantum optical field without destroying the state, implementing\nthe ideal projections onto the respective subspaces.
