Resonant mode coupling mechanisms are investigated using\nthe drift kinetic HAGIS code [Pinches 1998]. Simulations were performed for\ndifferent plasma equilibria, in particular for different q profiles, employing\nthe availability of improved experimental data. A study was carried out,\ninvestigating double-resonant mode coupling with respect to various overlapping\nscenarios. It was found that, depending on the radial mode distance,\ndouble-resonance is able to enhance growth rates as well as mode amplitudes\nsignificantly. Small radial mode distances, however can also lead to strong\nnonlinear mode stabilization of a linear dominant mode. With the extended\nversion of HAGIS, losses were simulated and directly compared with experimental\nloss measurements. The losses' phase space distribution as well as their\nejection signal is consistent with experimental data. Furthermore, it allowed\nto characterize them as prompt, resonant or stochastic.
