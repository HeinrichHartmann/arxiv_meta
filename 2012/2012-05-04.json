Differences are primarily due to filtering, a fundamental\nintrinsic feature of LES. Filtering the fluid velocity field yields approximate\ncomputation of the forces acting on particles and, in turn, trajectories that\nare inaccurate when compared to those of DNS. In this paper, we focus precisely\non the filtering error for which we quantify a lower bound. To this aim, we use\na DNS database of inertial particle dispersion in turbulent channel flow and we\nperform a-priori tests in which the error purely due to filtering is singled\nout removing error accumulation effects, which would otherwise lead to\nprogressive divergence between DNS and LES particle trajectories. By applying\nfilters of different type and width at varying particle inertia, we\ncharacterize the statistical properties of the filtering error as a function of\nthe wall distance. Results show that filtering error is stochastic and has a\nnon-Gaussian distribution. In addition, the distribution of the filtering error\ndepends strongly on the wall-normal coordinate being maximum in the buffer\nregion.

With advances in\nsequencing technology, researchers are able to investigate the important roles\nof gene duplications and losses in adaptive evolution. Because of gene complex\nevolution, ortholog identification is a basic but difficult task in comparative\ngenomics. A key method for the task is to use an explicit model of the\nevolutionary history of the genes being studied, called the gene (family) tree.\nIt compares the gene tree with the evolutionary history of the species in which\nthe genes reside, called the species tree, using the procedure known as tree\nreconciliation. Reconciling binary gene and specific trees is simple. However,\nboth gene and species trees may be non-binary in practice and thus tree\nreconciliation presents challenging problems.

This type of structures was\ninvestigated by the recent paper of Bille et al. Let n be the size of a\ncontext-free grammar that derives a unique string s of length L. (Note that L\nmight be exponential in n.) Bille et al. showed a data structure that uses\nspace O(n) and allows to query for the i-th character of s using running time\nO(log L). Their data structure works on a word RAM with a word size of logL\nbits. Here we prove that for such data structures, if the space is poly(n),\nthen the query time must be at least (log L)^{1-\\epsilon}/log S where S is the\nspace used, for any constant eps>0. As a function of n, our lower bound is\n\\Omega(n^{1/2-\\epsilon}). Our proof holds in the cell-probe model with a word\nsize of log L bits, so in particular it holds in the word RAM model. We show\nthat no lower bound significantly better than n^{1/2-\\epsilon} can be achieved\nin the cell-probe model, since there is a data structure in the cell-probe\nmodel that uses O(n) space and achieves O(\\sqrt{n log n}) query time. The \"bad\"\nsetting of parameters occurs roughly when L=2^{\\sqrt{n}}. We also prove a lower\nbound for the case of not-as-compressible strings, where, say,\nL=n^{1+\\epsilon}. For this case, we prove that if the space is n polylog(n),\nthen the query time must be at least \\Omega(log n/loglog n).\n  The proof works by reduction to communication complexity, namely to the LSD\nproblem, recently employed by Patrascu and others. We prove lower bounds also\nfor the case of LZ-compression and Burrows-Wheeler (BWT) compression.

In order to convert the\nexpansion speed to radial speed (which is important for space weather\napplications) one can use an empirical relationship between the two that\nassumes an average width for all CMEs. If we have the width information from\nquadrature observations, we can confirm the relationship between expansion and\nradial speeds derived by Gopalswamy et al. (2009a). The STEREO spacecraft were\nin qudrature with SOHO (STEREO-A ahead of Earth by 87o and STEREO-B 94o behind\nEarth) on 2011 February 15, when a fast Earth-directed CME occurred. The CME\nwas observed as a halo by the Large-Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO)\non board SOHO. The sky-plane speed was measured by SOHO/LASCO as the expansion\nspeed, while the radial speed was measured by STEREO-A and STEREO-B. In\naddition, STEREO-A and STEREO-B images provided the width of the CME, which is\nunknown from Earth view. From the SOHO and STEREO measurements, we confirm the\nrelationship between the expansion speed (Vexp) and radial speed (Vrad) derived\npreviously from geometrical considerations (Gopalswamy et al. 2009a): Vrad =\n1/2 (1 + cot w)Vexp, where w is the half width of the CME. STEREO-B images of\nthe CME, we found that CME had a full width of 76o, so w = 38o. This gives the\nrelation as Vrad = 1.14 Vexp. From LASCO observations, we measured Vexp = 897\nkm/s, so we get the radial speed as 1023 km/s. Direct measurement of radial\nspeed yields 945 km/s (STEREO-A) and 1058 km/s (STEREO-B).

The two\nclasses are comprised of: (1) The weak jet sources, corresponding to FR I radio\ngalaxies, having a decelerating or spine-sheath jet with velocity gradients,\nand (2) The strong jet sources, having fast, collimated jets, and typically\ndisplaying strong emission lines.

This goes against widespread simulation practices of\nevolutionary games, where players frequently consider changing their strategy\neven though their payoffs may be marginally different than those of the other\nplayers. Inspired by this observation, we introduce an aspiration-based\nwin-stay-lose-learn strategy updating rule into the spatial prisoner's dilemma\ngame. The rule is simple and intuitive, foreseeing strategy changes only by\ndissatisfied players, who then attempt to adopt the strategy of one of their\nnearest neighbors, while the strategies of satisfied players are not subject to\nchange.
