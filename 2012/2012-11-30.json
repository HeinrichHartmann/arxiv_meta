The combinatorial perspective enables us to obtain\na closed-form formulation for protein inference.\n  Based on our model, we study the impact of unique peptides and degenerate\npeptides on protein probabilities. Here, degenerate peptides are peptides\nshared by at least two proteins. Meanwhile, we also study the relationship of\nour model with other methods such as ProteinProphet. A probability confidence\ninterval can be calculated and used together with probability to filter the\nprotein identification result. Our method achieves competitive results with\nProteinProphet in a more efficient manner in the experiment based on two\ndatasets of standard protein mixtures and two datasets of real samples.\n  We name our program ProteinInfer.

They cause angular momentum to be\nredistributed within the galaxy, emitted mainly from (near-)resonant material\nat the inner Lindblad resonance of the bar, and absorbed mainly by\n(near-)resonant material in the spheroid (i.e., the halo and, whenever\nrelevant, the bulge) and in the outer disk. Spheroids delay and slow down the\ninitial growth of the bar they host, but, at the later stages of the evolution,\nthey strengthen the bar by absorbing angular momentum. Increased velocity\ndispersion in the (near-)resonant regions delays bar formation and leads to\nless strong bars. When bars form they are vertically thin, but soon their inner\nparts puff up and form what is commonly known as the boxy/peanut bulge. This\ngives a complex and interesting shape to the bar which explains a number of\nobservations and also argues that the COBE/DIRBE bar and the Long bar in our\nGalaxy are, respectively, the thin and the thick part of a single bar. The\nvalue of the bar pattern speed may be set by optimising the balance between\nemitters and absorbers, so that a maximum amount of angular momentum is\nredistributed. As they evolve, bars grow stronger and rotate slower. Bars also\nredistribute matter within the galaxy, create a disky bulge (pseudo-bulge),\nincrease the disk scale-length and extent and drive substructures such as\nspirals and rings.

The results show that the density distributions of valence\nneutron significantly influence nucleon-nucleon momentum correlation function\nat large impact parameter and high incident energy. The extended density\ndistribution of valence neutron largely weakens the strength of correlation\nfunction. The size of emission source is extracted by fitting correlation\nfunction using Gaussian source method.

We then examine the coupling of multiple M2-branes to the\nbackground 3-form and 6-form gauge fields of eleven-dimensional supergravity.\nIn particular we show in detail how a natural generalisation of the Myers\nflux-terms, along with the resulting curvature of the background metric, leads\nto mass terms in the effective field theory. Working to lowest nontrivial order\nin fermions, we demonstrate the supersymmetric invariance of the\nfour-derivative order corrected Lagrangian of the Euclidean BLG theory and\ndetermine the theory's higher derivative corrected supersymmetry\ntransformations. The supersymmetry algebra is also shown to close on the scalar\nand gauge fields. We also consider periodic arrays of M2-branes in the ABJM\nmodel in the spirit of a circle compactification to D2-branes in type IIA\nstring theory. The result is a curious formulation of three-dimensional\nmaximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Upon further T-duality on a\ntransverse torus we obtain a non-manifest-Lorentz-invariant description of\nfive-dimensional maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills which can be viewed as an\nM-theory description of M5-branes on $\\mathbb{T}^3$.

Energetic\ncosmic neutrinos can interact inside the rock and produce leptons via a charged\ncurrent interaction. In the case of an incoming electron neutrino undergoing a\ncharged current interaction, the produced UHE electron will induce an\nunderground electromagnetic shower. At high energy (above 7.7 TeV in standard\nrock), such showers are subject to LPM (Landau, Pomeranchuk and Migdal)\nsuppression of the radiative processes cross sections (bremsstrahlung and pair\nproduction). The consequence of this suppression is that showers are elongated.\nThis effect will increase the detection probability of such events allowing\ndeeper showers to emerge with detectable energies. On the other hand, the\nphotonuclear processes which are usually neglected in electromagnetic showers\nwith respect to radiative processes, turn out to become dominant in the LPM\nregime and will reduce the shower length. In this work, we have performed a\ncomplete Monte Carlo study of an underground shower induced by UHE electrons by\ntaking into account both the LPM suppression and the photonuclear interaction.\nWe will discuss the effects of both of these processes on the shower length and\non the detectability of such events by ground arrays or fluorescence\ntelescopes. We show that limits on neutrino fluxes that were obtained using\nsimulations that were obviously neglecting photonuclear processes are\noveroptimistic and should be corrected.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 7 figures"]}]
