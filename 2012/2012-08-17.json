We aim to validate the disintegrating-planet scenario by modeling the\ndetailed shape of the observed light curve, and thereby constrain the cloud\nparticle properties to better understand the nature of this intriguing object.\nMethods. We analysed the six publicly-available quarters of raw Kepler data,\nphase-folded the light curve and fitted it to a model for the trailing dust\ncloud. Constraints on the particle properties were investigated with a\nlight-scattering code. Results. The light curve exhibits clear signatures of\nlight scattering and absorption by dust, including a brightening in flux just\nbefore ingress correlated with the transit depth and explained by forward\nscattering, and an asymmetry in the transit light curve shape, which is easily\nreproduced by an exponentially decaying distribution of optically thin dust,\nwith a typical grain size of 0.1 micron.
