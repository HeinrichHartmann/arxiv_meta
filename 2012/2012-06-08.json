In contrast to the disk-based sensing model in\na traditional sensor network, the detection range of a bistatic radar depends\non the locations of both the radar transmitter and radar receiver, and is\ncharacterized by Cassini ovals. Furthermore, in a network with multiple radar\ntransmitters and receivers, since any pair of transmitter and receiver can\npotentially form a bistatic radar, the detection ranges of different bistatic\nradars are coupled and the corresponding network coverage is intimately related\nto the locations of all transmitters and receivers, making the optimal\ndeployment design highly non-trivial. Clearly, the detectability of an intruder\ndepends on the highest SNR received by all possible bistatic radars. We focus\non the worst-case intrusion detectability, i.e., the minimum possible\ndetectability along all possible intrusion paths. Although it is plausible to\ndeploy radars on a shortest line segment across the field, it is not always\noptimal in general, which we illustrate via counter-examples. We then present a\nsufficient condition on the field geometry for the optimality of shortest line\ndeployment to hold. Further, we quantify the local structure of detectability\ncorresponding to a given deployment order and spacings of radar transmitters\nand receivers, building on which we characterize the optimal deployment to\nmaximize the worst-case intrusion detectability. Our results show that the\noptimal deployment locations exhibit a balanced structure.
