Errors in state estimation for these\noften highly nonlinear systems has been the primary focus of recent research,\nbut as that error has been successfully diminished, the role of model error in\nforecast uncertainty has duly increased.

In each\ncase, the results suggest that the correction procedure is more effective for\nreducing error and prolonging forecast usefulness than parameter tuning.\nHowever, the cost of this increase in average forecast accuracy is the creation\nof substantial qualitative differences between the dynamics of the corrected\nmodel and the true system.

The pulses are used in a scheme of\ndirect-frequency-comb excitation of helium atoms from the ground state to the\n1s4p and 1s5p 1P_1 states. Laser ionization by auxiliary 1064 nm pulses is used\nto detect the excited state population, resulting in a cosine-like signal as a\nfunction of the repetition rate of the frequency comb with a modulation\ncontrast of up to 55%. Analysis of the visibility of this comb structure yields\nan estimated timing jitter between the two upconverted comb laser pulses of 50\nattoseconds, whch indicates that extension to even shorter wavelengths should\nbe feasible.

Particularly,\nprevious works have proven that CHOKe is able to bound both bandwidth share and\nbuffer share of (a possible aggregate) UDP traffic (flow) on a link. However,\nthese studies consider, and pertain only to, a steady state where the queue\nreaches equilibrium in the presence of many (long-lived) TCP flows and an\nunresponsive UDP flow of fixed arrival rate. If the steady state conditions are\nperturbed, particularly when UDP traffic rate changes over time, it is unclear\nwhether the protection property of CHOKe still holds. Indeed, it can be\nexamined, for example, that when UDP rate suddenly becomes 0 (i.e., flow\nstops), the unresponsive flow may assume close to full utilization in sub-RTT\nscales, potentially starving out the TCP flows. To explain this apparent\ndiscrepancy, this paper investigates CHOKe queue properties in a transient\nregime, which is the time period of transition between two steady states of the\nqueue, initiated when the rate of the unresponsive flow changes.

To cope\nwith the increasing demand for content, CPs deploy massively distributed\ninfrastructures. This poses new challenges for CPs as they have to dynamically\nmap end-users to appropriate servers, without being fully aware of network\nconditions within an ISP as well as the end-users network locations.\nFurthermore, ISPs struggle to cope with rapid traffic shifts caused by the\ndynamic server selection process of CPs.\n  In this paper, we argue that the challenges that CPs and ISPs face separately\ntoday can be turned into an opportunity. We show how they can jointly take\nadvantage of the deployed distributed infrastructures to improve their\noperation and end-user performance. We propose Content-aware Traffic\nEngineering (CaTE), which dynamically adapts the traffic demand for content\nhosted on CPs by utilizing ISP network information and end-user location during\nthe server selection process. As a result, CPs enhance their end-user to server\nmapping and improve end-user experience, thanks to the ability of\nnetwork-informed server selection to circumvent network bottlenecks. In\naddition, ISPs gain the ability to partially influence the traffic demands in\ntheir networks. Our results with operational data show improvements in path\nlength and delay between end-user and the assigned CP server, network wide\ntraffic reduction of up to 15%, and a decrease in ISP link utilization of up to\n40% when applying CaTE to traffic delivered by a small number of major CPs.\n","Comment: Also appears as TU-Berlin technical report 2012-3, ISSN: 1436-9915"]}]

Models constructed to explain this\nphenomena have relied on preferential attachment where the networks grow by the\naddition of both vertices and edges, and the edges attach themselves to a\nvertex with a probability proportional to its degree. Simulations hint, though\nnot conclusively, that both growth and preferential attachment are necessary\nfor scale free behavior. We derive analytic expressions for degree\ndistributions for networks that grow by the addition of edges to a fixed number\nof vertices, based on both linear and non-linear preferential attachment, and\nshow that they fall off exponentially as would be expected for purely random\nnetworks.
