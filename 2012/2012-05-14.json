In order to\ncorrectly resemble the realistic case of vertically extended 3D disks the\nsoftening prescription used in 2D needs to be adjusted properly. In this paper\nwe analyze the embedded planet and the self-gravity case and provide a method\nto evaluate the required smoothing in 2D simulations of thin disks. Starting\nfrom the averaged hydrodynamic equations and using a vertically isothermal disk\nmodel, we calculate the force. We compare our results to the often used Plummer\nform of the potential which runs as \\propto 1/(r^2+\\epsilon^2)^{1/2}. For that\npurpose we compute the required smoothing length \\epsilon as a function of\ndistance r to the planet or to a disk element within a self-gravitating disk.\nWe find that for larger distances \\epsilon is determined solely by the vertical\ndisk thickness H. For the planet case we find that outside r\\simH a value of\n\\epsilon = 0.7H describes the averaged force very well, while in the\nself-gravitating disk the value needs to be larger, \\epsilon = 1.2H. For\nsmaller distances the smoothing needs to be reduced significantly. Comparing\ntorque densities of 3D and 2D simulations we show that the modification to the\nvertical density stratification as induced by an embedded planet needs to be\ntaken into account to obtain agreeing results. In disk fragmentation\nsimulations the choice of \\epsilon can determine whether a disk will fragment\nor not. Because a wrong smoothing length can change even the direction of\nmigration, it is very important to include the effect of the planet on the\nlocal scale height in 2D planet-disk simulations. We provide an approximate and\nfast method for this purpose which gives very good agreement to full 3D\nsimulations.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 19 figures, accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

The problem of measuring both the\ngeneral direction and polarization of an electromagnetic source is commonly\nsolved by iterative fitting methods such as linear regression that deal\nsimultaneously with both directional and polarization parameters. We have\ndeveloped a scheme that separates the problem of deriving the source direction\nfrom that of determining the polarization, avoiding iteration in a\nmulti-dimensional manifold. The crux of the method is to first determine the\nsource direction independently of concerns as to its polarization. Once the\nsource direction is known, its direct characterization in terms of Stokes\nvectors in a single iteration if desired, is relatively simple.

But\ndue to lack of central server and infrastructure in Mobile Ad hoc Networks\n(MANETs), this is major problem to manage the keys in the network. Dynamically\nchanges in network's topology causes weak trust relationship among the nodes in\nthe network. In MANETs a mobile node operates as not only end terminal but also\nas an intermediate router.

A routing protocol is said to be secure that\ndetects the detrimental effects of malicious node(s in the path from source to\ndestination).

Group leader has responsibility of key management in its group. Proposed\nkey management scheme is a decentralized scheme that does not require any\nTrusted Third Party (TTP) for key management.

Here we introduce intra-band Bogoliubov\nquasiparticle scattering interference (QPI) techniques for determination of\n\\Delta_i(k) in such materials, focusing on LiFeAs. We identify the three\nhole-like bands assigned previously as \\gamma, \\alpha_2 and \\alpha_1, and we\ndetermine the anisotropy, magnitude and relative orientations of their\n\\Delta_i(k). These measurements will advance quantitative theoretical analysis\nof the mechanism of Cooper pairing in iron-based superconductivity.\n"]}]

A\nthorough understanding of the effects of different population densities is\ntherefore crucial. Here we study the evolution of cooperation in social\ndilemmas on different interaction graphs with a certain fraction of vacant\nnodes. We find that sparsity may favor the resolution of social dilemmas,\nespecially if the population density is close to the percolation threshold of\nthe underlying graph. Regardless of the type of the governing social dilemma as\nwell as particularities of the interaction graph, we show that under pairwise\nimitation the percolation threshold is a universal indicator of how dense the\noccupancy ought to be for cooperation to be optimally promoted. We also\ndemonstrate that myopic updating, due to the lack of efficient spread of\ninformation via imitation, renders the reported mechanism dysfunctional, which\nin turn further strengthens its foundations.\n","Comment: 6 two-column pages, 5 figures; accepted for publication in Scientific\n  Reports [related work available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.0541]"]}]
