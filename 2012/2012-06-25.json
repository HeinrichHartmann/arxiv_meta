While for the simplest scenario of chaotic inflation all observable\nprimordial fluctuations cross the Hubble horizon during the slow-roll epoch,\nfor the scenario of just-enough inflation the slow-roll conditions are violated\nat the largest length scales. Performing a numerical mode-by-mode integration\nfor the perturbations on the largest scales and comparing the predicted\nanisotropies of the cosmic microwave background to results from the WMAP 7-yr\ndata analysis, we find the initial conditions in agreement with current\ncosmological data. In contrast to the simplest chaotic model for the quartic\npotential, the just-enough inflation scenario is not ruled out.

We observe that the more convergent perturbative series after PMC\nscale-setting leads to a more accurate top-quark forward-backward asymmetry.\nThe resulting PMC prediction on the asymmetry is also free from the initial\nrenormalization scale-dependence. Because the NLO PMC scale has a dip behavior\nfor the $(q\\bar{q})$-channel at small subprocess collision energies, the\nimportance of this channel to the asymmetry is increased. We observe that the\nasymmetries $A_{FB}^{t\\bar{t}}$ and $A_{FB}^{p\\bar{p}}$ at the Tevatron will be\nincreased by 42% in comparison to the previous estimates obtained by using\nconventional scale-setting; i.e. we obtain $A_{FB}^{t\\bar{t},{\\rm PMC}} \\simeq\n12.5%$ and $A_{FB}^{p\\bar{p},{\\rm PMC}} \\simeq 8.28%$. Moreover, we obtain\n$A_{FB}^{t\\bar{t},{\\rm PMC}}(M_{t\\bar{t}}>450 \\;{\\rm GeV}) \\simeq 35.0%$. These\npredictions have a $1\\sigma$-deviation from the present CDF and D0\nmeasurements; the large discrepancies of the top-quark forward-backward\nasymmetry between the Standard Model estimate and the CDF and D0 data are thus\ngreatly reduced.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 9 figures.

Traditional Bayesian hypothesis testing is\nextended based on interval hypotheses on distribution parameters and equality\nhypotheses on probability distributions, in order to validate models with\ndeterministic/stochastic output for given inputs. Two types of validation\nexperiments are considered - fully characterized (all the model/experimental\ninputs are measured and reported as point values) and partially characterized\n(some of the model/experimental inputs are not measured or are reported as\nintervals). Bayesian hypothesis testing can minimize the risk in model\nselection by properly choosing the model acceptance threshold, and its results\ncan be used in model averaging to avoid Type I/II errors. It is shown that\nBayesian interval hypothesis testing, the reliability-based method, and the\narea metric-based method can account for the existence of directional bias,\nwhere the mean predictions of a numerical model may be consistently below or\nabove the corresponding experimental observations.

The beginning of the story dates\nback to a pioneering work by Hilbert, who first formalized the concept of\nlinearization of the collision operator and pointed out the importance of its\neigenvalues with respect to a certain asymptotic behavior of the Boltzmann\nequation. Under really mild conditions on initial data - close to being\nnecessary - and a weak, physically consistent, angular cutoff hypothesis, our\nmain result (Theorem 1.1) contains the first precise statement that the total\nvariation distance between the solution and the limiting Maxwellian\ndistribution admits an upper bound of the form C e^{Lambda_b t}, Lambda_b being\nthe least negative of the aforesaid eigenvalues and C a constant which depends\nonly on a few simple numerical characteristics (e.g. moments) of the initial\ndatum. The validity of this quantification was conjectured, about fifty years\nago, in a paper by Henry P. McKean but, in spite of several attempts, the best\nanswer known up to now consists in a bound with a rate which can be made\narbitrarily close to Lambda_b, to the cost of the \"explosion\" of the constant\nC. Moreover, its deduction is subject to restrictive hypotheses on the initial\ndatum, besides the Grad angular cutoff condition. As to the proof of our\nresults, we have taken as point of reference an analogy between the problem of\nconvergence to equilibrium and the central limit theorem of probability theory,\nhighlighted by McKean.

This formalism relies on the\nknowledge of the interaction kernel among quarks and of the full quark\npropagator. For the interaction kernel, which is in principle a sum of\ninfinitely many diagrams, I use the Ladder truncation. It amounts to reduce the\ninteraction to a flavor-blind quark-mass independent vector-vector interaction\nbetween two quarks, mediated by a dressed gluon. The irreducible three-body\ninteractions are neglected. The full quark propagator is obtained as a solution\nof the quark Dyson-Schwinger equation which is truncated such that, together\nwith the truncation in the interaction kernel, chiral symmetry is correctly\nimplemented. It is called Rainbow truncation, and together with the truncated\nkernel equation it constitutes the Rainbow-Ladder truncation of the\nBethe-Salpeter equation.\n  Any truncation induces the introduction of a model to account for the\nproperties of the full system. The main goal of this thesis is to evaluate the\nmodel dependence of corrsponding results and, as a consequence, to isolate the\nfeatures related to the truncation itself. To this end two non-related models\nare used to calculate the baryon spectra, from light to heavy quarks, and the\nelectromagnetic properties of the Delta(1232). From these results one concludes\na qualitative model independence, and that a Rainbow-Ladder truncated\nbound-state calculation reproduces the physical results with an accuracy of\n~10%.\n  Covariant bound-state equations are not limited to the study of hadronic\nbound states.
