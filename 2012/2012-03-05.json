The recurrence behavior\nof the condensate is analyzed as a function of time close to nonlinear\nresonances occurring in the classical counterpart. Our mathematical formalism\nfor the recurrence time scales is presented as delicate recurrences, which take\nplace, for instance, when the lattice is perturbed weakly and robust\nrecurrences, which may manifest themselves for a sufficiently strong external\ndriving force. The analysis not only is valid for a dilute condensate, but also\nis applicable for the strongly interacting homogeneous condensate provided; the\nexternal modulation causes no significant change in the density profile of the\ncondensate. We explain the parametric dependence of the dynamical recurrence\ntimes, which can easily be realized in laboratory experiments.

In order to study a\nsimilar phenomenon in three-dimensional (3D) turbulence undergoing strong\nsolid-body rotation, we test a previously developed Large Eddy Simulation (LES)\nmodel against a high-resolution direct numerical simulation of rotating\nturbulence on a grid of $3072^3$ points. We then describe new numerical results\non the inverse energy cascade in rotating flows using this LES model and\ncontrast the case of 2D versus 3D forcing, as well as non-helical forcing\n(i.e., with weak overall alignment between velocity and vorticity) versus the\nfully helical Beltrami case, both for deterministic and random forcing. The\ndifferent scaling of the inverse energy cascade can be attributed to the\ndimensionality of the forcing, with, in general, either a $k_{\\perp}^{-3}$ or a\n$k_{\\perp}^{-5/3}$ energy spectrum of slow modes at large scales, perpendicular\nreferring to the direction of rotation. We finally invoke the role of shear in\nthe case of a strongly anisotropic deterministic forcing, using the so-called\nABC flow.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures"]}]

In the critical and subcritical\ncases, we follow our recent approach to controling the nonlinearity using only\npointwise control of the continuous solution and a local Lipschitz property,\nrather than through pointwise control of the discrete solution; this eliminates\nthe requirement that the discrete solution satisfy a discrete form of the\nmaximum principle, hence eliminating the need for restrictive angle conditions\nin the underlying mesh. The supercritical case continues to require such mesh\nconditions in order to control the nonlinearity. We then design a two-grid\nalgorithm consisting of a coarse grid solver for the original nonlinear\nproblem, and a fine grid solver for a linearized problem.

Classification usually takes place at\nthe level of journals, where the Web of Science subject categories are the most\npopular classification system. However, journal-level classification systems\nhave two important limitations: They offer only a limited amount of detail, and\nthey have difficulties with multidisciplinary journals. To avoid these\nlimitations, we introduce a new methodology for constructing classification\nsystems at the level of individual publications. In the proposed methodology,\npublications are clustered into research areas based on citation relations. The\nmethodology is able to deal with very large numbers of publications. We present\nan application in which a classification system is produced that includes\nalmost ten million publications. Based on an extensive analysis of this\nclassification system, we discuss the strengths and the limitations of the\nproposed methodology. Important strengths are the transparency and relative\nsimplicity of the methodology and its fairly modest computing and memory\nrequirements. The main limitation of the methodology is its exclusive reliance\non direct citation relations between publications. The accuracy of the\nmethodology can probably be increased by also taking into account other types\nof relations, for instance based on bibliographic coupling.\n"]}]
