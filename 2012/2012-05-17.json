Recently, convex relaxation methods for image multi-labeling were\nproposed in the literature. Often these models involve the total variation (TV)\nsemi-norm as regularizing term. However, it is well-known that the TV\nfunctional is not optimal for the segmentation of textured regions. In recent\nyears directional representation systems were proposed to cope with curved\nsingularities in images. In particular, curvelets and shearlets provide an\noptimally sparse approximation in the class of piecewise smooth functions with\n$C^2$ singularity boundaries. In this paper, we demonstrate that the discrete\nshearlet transform is suited as regularizer for the segmentation of curved\nstructures. Neither the shearlet nor the curvelet transform where used as\nregularizer in a segmentation model so far. To this end, we have implemented a\ntranslation invariant finite discrete shearlet transform based on the FFT. We\ndescribe how the shearlet transform can be incorporated within the multi-label\nsegmentation model and show how to find a minimizer of the corresponding\nfunctional by applying an alternating direction method of multipliers. Here the\nParseval frame property of our shearlets comes into play. We demonstrate by\nnumerical examples that the shearlet regularized model can better segment\ncurved textures than the TV regularized one and that the method can also cope\nwith regularizers obtained from non-local means.\n"]}]

Laboratory demonstrations of basic features of beam-driven propulsion,\nflight, stability ('beam-riding'), and induced spin, have been completed in the\nlast decade, primarily in the microwave. It offers much lower cost probes after\na substantial investment in the launcher. Engineering issues are being\naddressed by other applications: fusion (microwave, millimeter and laser\nsources) and astronomy (large aperture antennas). There are many candidate sail\nmaterials: carbon nanotubes and microtrusses, graphene, beryllium, etc. For\nacceleration of a sail, what is the cost-optimum high power system? Here the\ncost is used to constrain design parameters to estimate system power, aperture\nand elements of capital and operating cost. From general relations for\ncost-optimal transmitter aperture and power, system cost scales with kinetic\nenergy and inversely with sail diameter and frequency. So optimal sails will be\nlarger, lower in mass and driven by higher frequency beams. Estimated costs\ninclude economies of scale. We present several starship point concepts.

The\nfamiliar chess pieces move about according to their usual chess rules, and each\nplayer strives to place the opposing king into checkmate. The mate-in-n problem\nof infinite chess is the problem of determining whether a designated player can\nforce a win from a given finite position in at most n moves. A naive\nformulation of this problem leads to assertions of high arithmetic complexity\nwith 2n alternating quantifiers---there is a move for white, such that for\nevery black reply, there is a counter-move for white, and so on. In such a\nformulation, the problem does not appear to be decidable; and one cannot expect\nto search an infinitely branching game tree even to finite depth. Nevertheless,\nthe main theorem of this article, confirming a conjecture of the first author\nand C. D. A. Evans, establishes that the mate-in-n problem of infinite chess is\ncomputably decidable, uniformly in the position and in n. Furthermore, there is\na computable strategy for optimal play from such mate-in-n positions. The proof\nproceeds by showing that the mate-in-n problem is expressible in what we call\nthe first-order structure of chess, which we prove (in the relevant fragment)\nis an automatic structure, whose theory is therefore decidable. Indeed, it is\ndefinable in Presburger arithmetic. Unfortunately, this resolution of the\nmate-in-n problem does not appear to settle the decidability of the more\ngeneral winning-position problem, the problem of determining whether a\ndesignated player has a winning strategy from a given position, since a\nposition may admit a winning strategy without any bound on the number of moves\nrequired. This issue is connected with transfinite game values in infinite\nchess, and the exact value of the omega one of chess is not known.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 1 figure, CiE 2012. updated author list"]}]

Taylor's power\nlaw (Taylor 1961: Nature, 189:732-) is well recognized as one of the\nfundamental models in population ecology. A fundamental property of biological\npopulations, which Taylor's power law reveals, is the near universal\nheterogeneity of population abundance distribution in habitat. Obviously, the\nheterogeneity also exists at the community level, where not only the\ndistributions of population abundances but also the proportions of the species\ncomposition in the community are often heterogeneous. Nevertheless, existing\ncommunity diversity indexes such as Shannon index and Simpson index can only\nmeasure \"local\" or \"static\" diversity in the sense that they are computed for\neach habitat at a specific time point, and the indexes alone do not reflect the\ndiversity changes. In this note, I propose to extend the application scope of\nTaylor's power law to the studies of human microbial communities, specifically,\nthe community heterogeneity at both population and community levels. I further\nsuggested that population dispersion models such as Taylor (1980: Nature, 286,\n53-), which is known to generate population distribution patterns consistent\nwith the power law, should also be very useful for analyzing the distribution\npatterns of human microbes within the human body. Overall, I hope that the\napproach to human microbial community with the power law offers an example that\necological theories can play an important role in the emerging medical ecology,\nwhich aims at studying the ecology of human microbiome and its implications to\nhuman diseases and health, as well as in personalized medicine.\n"]}]

The goal is to\ncompute a min-cost tree S which spans all terminals. In this paper we consider\nthe min-power version of the problem, which is better suited for wireless\napplications. Here, the goal is to minimize the total power consumption of\nnodes, where the power of a node v is the maximum cost of any edge of S\nincident to v. Intuitively, nodes are antennas (part of which are terminals\nthat we need to connect) and edge costs define the power to connect their\nendpoints via bidirectional links (so as to support protocols with ack\nmessages). Differently from its min-cost counterpart, min-power Steiner tree is\nNP-hard even in the spanning tree case, i.e. when all nodes are terminals.\nSince the power of any tree is within once and twice its cost, computing a rho\n\\leq ln(4)+eps [Byrka et al.'10] approximate min-cost Steiner tree provides a\n2rho<2.78 approximation for the problem. For min-power spanning tree the same\napproach provides a 2 approximation, which was improved to 5/3+eps with a\nnon-trivial approach in [Althaus et al.'06].

The same approach gives an improved\n1.5+eps approximation for min-power spanning tree as well, matching the\napproximation factor in [Nutov and Yaroshevitch'09] for the special case of\nmin-power spanning tree with edge weights in {0,1}.\n"]}]

We show that both cases of zero and\npositive detuning share a qualitatively similar crossover of the drag force\nfrom the subsonic to the supersonic regime as a function of the fluid velocity,\nwith a critical velocity given by the speed of sound found for the linear\nregime. In contrast, for gapped spectra, we find that the critical velocity\nexceeds the speed of sound. In all cases, the residual drag force in the\nsubcritical regime depends on the polariton lifetime only. Also, well below the\ncritical velocity, the drag force varies linearly with the polariton lifetime,\nin agreement with previous work [E. Cancellieri et al., Phys. Rev. B 82, 224512\n(2010)], where the drag was determined numerically for a finite-size defect.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 2 figures"]}]

Thus, to the extent that quantum systems are free, in the\nsense of Conway and Kochen, there is a sense in which they are maximally free.\n  We also propose that laws of quantum evolution arise from a principle of\nprecedence, according to which the outcome of a measurement on a quantum system\nis selected randomly from the ensemble of outcomes of previous instances of the\nsame measurement on the same quantum system. This implies that dynamical laws\nfor quantum systems can evolve as the universe evolves, because new precedents\nare generated by the formation of new entangled states.\n","Comment: 12 pages, latex, no figures"]}]
