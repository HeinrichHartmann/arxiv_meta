Ingroup favoritism is\nanother aspect of human cooperation, whereby individuals help members in their\nown group more often than those in other groups. Ingroup favoritism is a puzzle\nfor the theory of cooperation because it is not easily evolutionarily stable.\nIn the context of indirect reciprocity, ingroup favoritism has been shown to be\na consequence of employing a double standard when assigning reputations to\ningroup and outgroup members; e.g., helping an ingroup member is regarded as\ngood, whereas the same action toward an outgroup member is regarded as bad. We\nanalyze a model of indirect reciprocity in which information sharing is\nconducted groupwise. In our model, individuals play social dilemma games within\nand across groups, and the information about their reputations is shared within\neach group. We show that evolutionarily stable ingroup favoritism emerges even\nif all the players use the same reputation assignment rule regardless of group\n(i.e., a single standard). Two reputation assignment rules called simple\nstanding and stern judging yield ingroup favoritism. Stern judging induces much\nstronger ingroup favoritism than does simple standing. Simple standing and\nstern judging are evolutionarily stable against each other when groups\nemploying different assignment rules compete and the number of groups is\nsufficiently large.

In correlated systems, it is interesting to compare this experimental\nvalue to that obtained in band structure calculations, as deviations are\nusually taken as a good indicator of the presence of strong electronic\ncorrelations. Nevertheless, it is not always straightforward to extract vF from\nARPES spectra. We study here the case of layered cobaltates, an interesting\nfamily of correlated metals. We compare the results obtained by standard\nmethods, namely the fit of spectra at constant momentum k (energy distribution\ncurve, EDC) or constant binding energy omega(momentum distribution curve, MDC).\nWe find that the difference of vF between the two methods can be as large as a\nfactor 2. The reliability of the 2 methods is intimately linked to the degree\nof k- and omega-dependence of the electronic self-energy. As the k-dependence\nis usually much smaller than the omega dependence for a correlated system, the\nMDC analysis is generally expected to give more reliable results. However, we\nreview here several examples within cobaltates, where the MDC analysis\napparently leads to unphysical results, while the EDC analysis appears\ncoherent. We attribute the difference between the EDC and MDC analysis to a\nstrong variation of the photoemission intensity with the momentum k. This\ndistorts the MDC lineshapes but does not affect the EDC ones. Simulations\nincluding a k dependence of the intensity allow to reproduce the difference\nbetween MDC and EDC analysis very well. This momentum dependence could be of\nextrinsic or intrinsic. We argue that the latter is the most likely and\nactually contains valuable information on the nature of the correlations that\nwould be interesting to extract further.\n"]}]

An extensive set of\nspin-transport data for Si and Ge magnetic tunnel devices reveals a scaling\nwith the tunnel resistance that violates the core feature of available\ntheories, namely, the linear proportionality of the spin voltage to the\ninjected spin current density. Instead, an anomalous scaling of the spin signal\nwith the tunnel resistance is observed, following a power-law with an exponent\nbetween 0.75 and 1 over 6 decades.

Advances in hardware\ntechnology have lead to the increasingly wide spread use of flash storage\ndevices. Such devices have clear benefits over traditional hard drives in terms\nof latency of access, bandwidth and random access capabilities particularly\nwhen reading data. There are however some interesting trade-offs to consider\nwhen leveraging the advanced features of such devices. On a relative scale\nwriting to such devices can be expensive. This is because typical flash devices\n(NAND technology) are updated in blocks. A minor update to a given block\nrequires the entire block to be erased, followed by a re-writing of the block.\nOn the other hand, sequential writes can be two orders of magnitude faster than\nrandom writes. In addition, random writes are degrading to the life of the\nflash drive, since each block can support only a limited number of erasures.\nTF-IDF can be implemented using a counting hash table. In general, hash tables\nare a particularly challenging case for the flash drive because this data\nstructure is inherently dependent upon the randomness of the hash function, as\nopposed to the spatial locality of the data. This makes it difficult to avoid\nthe random writes incurred during the construction of the counting hash table\nfor TF-IDF.

Two types of control, a\ndistributed propor- tional control and a centralized integral control, are cur-\nrently used to keep frequency deviations small. Although generation-load\nimbalance can be very localized, both controls primarily rely on frequency\ndeviation as their in- put. The time scales of control require the outputs of\nthe centralized integral control to be communicated to distant generators every\nfew seconds. We reconsider this con- trol/communication architecture and\nsuggest a hybrid ap- proach that utilizes parameterized feedback policies that\ncan be implemented in a fully distributed manner because the inputs to these\npolicies are local observables at each generator. Using an ensemble of\nforecasts of load and time-intermittent generation representative of possible\nfu- ture scenarios, we perform a centralized off-line stochas- tic optimization\nto select the generator-specific feedback parameters. These parameters need\nonly be communi- cated to generators once per control period (60 minutes in our\nsimulations). We show that inclusion of local power flows as feedback inputs is\ncrucial and reduces frequency deviations by a factor of ten. We demonstrate our\ncon- trol on a detailed transmission model of the Bonneville Power\nAdministration (BPA).

Because defense has been shown to\nbe inexpensive, even cost-free, in a number of systems [Andersson and Levin\n1999, Gagneux et al. 2006,Yoshida et al. 2004], our discoveries may well be\nreproduced in other model systems, and in nature. Finally, some of our key\nresults are extended to a general model in which functional forms for the\npredation rate and prey birth rate are not specified.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 8 figures"]}]

But\nsuppose that at our disposal we have several copies of an unknown photon. Is it\npossible to delete the information content of one or more of these photons by a\nphysical process? Specifically, if two photons are in the same initial\npolarization state is there a mechanism that produces one photon in the same\ninitial state and the other in some standard polarization state. If this can be\ndone, then one would create a standard blank state onto which one could copy an\nunknown state approximately, by deterministic cloning or exactly, by\nprobabilistic cloning. This might be useful in quantum computation, where one\ncould store some new information in an already computed state by deleting the\nold information. Here we show that the linearity of quantum theory does not\nallow us to delete a copy of an arbitrary quantum state perfectly. Though in a\nclassical computer information can be deleted against a copy, the same task\ncannot be accomplished with quantum information.\n","Comment: 4 Pages, (Published version Nature, 404 (2000) 164)"]}]
