It is oftentimes computationally\nharder than solving the original problem. Even worse, truthfulness can be\nutterly destroyed by small uncertainties in a mechanism's outcome. One obstacle\nis that truthful payments depend on outcomes other than the one realized, such\nas the lengths of non-shortest-paths in a shortest-path auction. Single-call\nmechanisms are a powerful tool that circumvents this obstacle --- they\nimplicitly charge truthful payments, guaranteeing truthfulness in expectation\nusing only the outcome realized by the mechanism.

One solution is the implementation of controlled\nperturbation algorithms which combine the speed of floating-point arithmetic\nwith a protection mechanism that guarantees reliability, nonetheless.\n  This paper is concerned with the performance analysis of controlled\nperturbation algorithms in theory. We answer this question with the\npresentation of a general analysis tool box. This tool box is separated into\nindependent components which are presented individually with their interfaces.\nThis way, the tool box supports alternative approaches for the derivation of\nthe most crucial bounds. We present three approaches for this task.\nFurthermore, we have thoroughly reworked the concept of controlled perturbation\nin order to include rational function based predicates into the theory;\npolynomial based predicates are included anyway.

The extended Weyl symmetry, implied by the effective metric\nindependence, makes the lagrangian model renormalizable. The modified\nYang-Mills action generates a linear potential, instead of the Coulomb-like\n(1/r) potential of the ordinary action. Therefore the Yang-Mills excitations\nmust be perturbatively confined. The metric, which admits an integrable\nlorentzian complex structure, can be extended to a Kaehler metric and the\nspacetime is a totally real CR manifold in $\\mathbb{C}^4$. These surfaces are\ngenerally inside the SU(2,2) homogeneous domain. A non-real-analytic point,\ntransferred to the U(2) characteristic boundary of the classical domain,\nspontaneously breaks the SU(2,2) symmetry down to its Poincare subgroup. Hence\nthe pure geometric modes and solitons of the model must belong to\nrepresentations of the Poincare group.\n","Comment: Essay written for the Gravity Research Foundation 2012 Awards for\n  Essays on Gravitation ; 11 pages"]}]
