This theory based on a local B-L gauge symmetry\ncan be considered as the simplest framework for understanding the origin of the\nR-parity violating interactions, giving rise to potential lepton number\nviolating signals and suppressed baryon number violating operators. The full\nspectrum of the theory and the constraints coming from neutrino masses are\nanalyzed in great detail. We discuss the proton decay issue and the possible\ndark matter candidates. In order to assess the testability of the theory we\nstudy the properties of the new gauge boson, the neutralino decays and the main\nproduction channels for the charged sleptons at the LHC. We find that the\nchannels with four charged leptons, three of them with the same sign, and four\njets give us the most striking signals for the testability of lepton number\nviolation at the LHC.\n","Comment: minor corrections, to appear in JHEP"]}]

The\npresented self-consistent macroscopic theory of this process employs\nthermodynamics (classical, statistical and linear non-equilibrium),\nhydrodynamics and interfacial kinetics. As a result of thermodynamic study of\nthe problem, the work of formation of a bubble is obtained and parameters of\nthe critical bubble are determined. The variables V (the bubble volume), \\rho\n(the vapor density), and T (the vapor temperature) are shown to be natural for\nthe given task. An algorithm of writing the equations of motion of a bubble in\nthe space {V, \\rho, T} - equations for V, \\rho, and T - is offered. This\nalgorithm ensures symmetry of the matrix of kinetic coefficients. The equation\nfor written on the basis of this algorithm is shown to represent the first law\nof thermodynamics for a bubble. The negative eigenvalue of the motion equations\nwhich alongside with the work of the critical bubble formation determines the\nstationary nucleation rate of bubbles is obtained. Various kinetic limits are\nconsidered. One of the kinetic constraints leads to the fact that the\nnucleation cannot occur in the whole metastable region; it occurs only in some\nsubregion of the latter. Zeldovich theory of cavitation is shown to be a\nlimiting case of the theory presented. The limiting effects of various kinetic\nprocesses on the nucleation rate of bubbles are shown analytically. These are\nthe inertial motion of a liquid as well as the processes of particles exchange\nand heat exchange between a bubble and surrounding liquid.

Poincare-Hopf tells\nthat for any injective function f on V the sum of i(f,x) is X(G). We also know\nthat averaging the indices E[i(f,x)] over all functions gives curvature K(x).\n  We explore here the situation when G is geometric of dimension d: that is if\neach unit sphere S(x) is geometric of dimension d-1 and that X(S(x))=0 for even\nd and X(S(x))=2 for odd d. The dimension of G is inductively defined as the\naverage of 1+dim(S(x)) over all S(x) assuming the empty graph has dimension -1.\n  We prove that any odd dimensional geometric graph G has zero curvature. This\nis done with the help of an index formula j(f,x) = 1-X(S(x))/2-X(B(f,x))/2,\nwhere j(x)=[i(f,x)+i(-f,x)]/2. The graph B(f,x) is the discrete level surface\n{y | f(y) = f(x)} intersected with S(x).

For odd d it becomes\nj(f,x) =-X(B(f,x))/2, where B(f,x) is an odd dimensional graph. Because by\ninduction with respect to d, the X(B(f,x))=0 we know now that that j(f,x) is\nzero for all x and so, by taking expectation over f that curvature K(x) is zero\nfor all x.\n  We also point out that all these results hold almost verbatim for compact\nRiemannian manifolds and actually are much simpler there. The same integral\ngeometric index formula is valid if f is a Morse function, i(f,x) is the index\nof the gradient vector field and if S(x) is a sufficiently small geodesic\nsphere around x and B(f,x) which is S(x) intersected with the level surface {y\n| f(y)=f(x)}.

While the simple\n\"{\\tau}-parametrization\" of the reionization process and, in particular, of its\nimprints on the CMB anisotropy likely represents a sufficiently accurate\nmodelling for the interpretation of current CMB data, a great attention has\nbeen recently posed on the accurate computation of the reionization signatures\nin the CMB for a large variety of astrophysical scenarios and physical\nprocesses. This work is aimed at a careful characterization of the imprints\nintroduced in the polarization anisotropy, with particular attention to the\nB-modes. We have implemented a modified version of CAMB, the Cosmological\nBoltzmann code for computing the angular power spectrum (APS) of the\nanisotropies of the CMB, to introduce the hydrogen and helium ionization\nfractions predicted in astrophysical and phenomenological reionization\nhistories, beyond the simple {\\tau}-parametrization. We compared the results\nobtained for these models for all the non-vanishing (in the assumed scenarios)\nmodes of the CMB APS. The amplitude and shape of the B-mode APS depends, in\nparticular, on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r, and on the reionization history,\nthus an accurate modeling of the reionization process will have implications\nfor the precise determination of r or to set more precise constraints on it\nthrough the joint analysis of E and B-mode polarization data available in the\nnext future and from a mission of next generation. Considering also the\nlimitation from potential residuals of astrophysical foregrounds, we discussed\nthe capability of next data to disentangle between different reionization\nscenarios in a wide range of r.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 17 figures"]}]

Applying the\nproposed method to modeling citations to papers and scholars in the InfoVis\n2004 data, a benchmark collection about a 31-year history of information\nvisualization, leads to findings consistent with citation distributions in\ngeneral and observations of the domain in particular. Fitness variables based\non prior impacts and the time factor have significant influences on citation\noutcomes. We find considerably large effect sizes from the fitness modeling,\nwhich suggest inevitable bias in citation analysis due to these factors. While\nraw citation scores offer little insight into the growth of InfoVis,\nnormalization of the scores by influences of time and prior fitness offers a\nreasonable depiction of the field's development. The analysis demonstrates the\nproposed model's ability to produce results consistent with observed data and\nto support meaningful comparison of citation scores over time.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables"]}]
