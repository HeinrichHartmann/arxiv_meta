The fraction of high radio loudness\n(R_K=L_radio/L_K) galaxies in the 10 Mpc Abell 3558 cluster complex at the core\nof the SSC (SSC-CR) is half as large than elsewhere. In the SSC-CR, R_K is\nanti-correlated with the density of the large-scale environment and correlated\nwith R/r200: central brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in the SSC-CR are 10x\nless radio-loud than BCGs elsewhere, with signs of suppressed radio loudness in\nthe SSC-CR also present beyond the BCGs, out to at least 0.3 r200. This\ncorrelation is nearly as strong as the tight correlation of L_K with R/r200\n(K-luminosity segregation), inside the SSC-CR. The suppression of radio\nloudness in SSC-CR BCGs can be attributed to cluster-cluster mergers that\ndestroy the cool core and thus the supply of gas to the central AGN. We\nanalytically demonstrate that the low radio loudness of non-BCG galaxies within\nSSC-CR clusters cannot be explained by direct major galaxy mergers or rapid\ngalaxy flyby collisions, but by the loss of gas supply through the enhanced ram\npressure felt when these galaxies cross the shock front between the 2 merging\nclusters and are later subjected to the stronger wind from the 2nd cluster.\n","Comment: Version consolidated with Erratum A&A 499, 45"]}]

Our model also predicts a bimodal\ndistribution (centrals and satellites) of stellar masses for given halo mass,\nin good agreement with SDSS observations. The relative importance of mergers\ndepends much more on stellar than halo mass. Galaxies with m_stars > 10^11\nM_Sun/h acquire most of their mass through mergers (mostly major and gas-poor),\nas expected from our model's shutdown of gas accretion at high M_halo.

The equations\ncharacterizing the properties of the vacuum state are derived and solved in a\ncertain approximation for the Schwarzschild black hole.

The short delay-tolerance of\ncommon content, such as news or road traffic updates, make them suitable for\nsuch a system. Use cases with a long delay-tolerance, such as software updates,\nare an even better fit.

A diffusive\nmixing model is adopted during the Red Giant Branch (RGB) phase. The properties\nof the blue loop are changed by modification of the element profiles above the\nH-burning shell, which results from the incomplete mixing in the bottom\novershooting region when stellar model evolves up along the RGB. Such\nmodification of the element profiles will lead to an increase of the opacity in\nthe region just above the H-burning shell and a decrease of the opacity in the\nouter homogeneous convection zone, which will result in a quick decrease of the\nH-shell nuclear luminosity $L_{H}$ when the stellar model evolves from the RGB\ntip to its bottom and, finally, a much weaker and smaller convection zone will\nbe obtained in the stellar envelope. This helps to form a longer blue loop. The\nextension of the blue loop is very sensitive to the parameters $(C_{X}$ and\n$\\alpha_{TCM})$ of the diffusive mixing model and of the TCM.

We focus on\n\"big data\" systems with a large number of drives and advanced error correction\nschemes beyond \\RAID{6}. Our RAID paradigm is based on Reed-Solomon codes, and\nthus we assume that the RAID consists of $N$ data drives and $M$ check drives.\nThe RAID fails only if the combined number of failed drives and sector errors\nexceeds $M$, a property of Reed-Solomon codes.\n  We review a number of models considered in the literature and build upon them\nto construct models usable for a large number of data and check drives. We\nattempt to account for a significant number of factors that affect RAID\nreliability, such as drive replacement or lack thereof, mistakes during service\nsuch as replacing the wrong drive, delayed repair, and the finite duration of\nRAID reconstruction. We evaluate the impact of sector failures that do not\nresult in drive replacement.\n  The reader who needs to consider large $M$ and $N$ will find applicable\nmathematical techniques concisely summarized here, and should be able to apply\nthem to similar problems. Most methods are based on the theory of continuous\ntime Markov chains, but we move beyond this framework when we consider the\nfixed time to rebuild broken hard drives, which we model using systems of delay\nand partial differential equations.\n  One universal statement is applicable across various models: increasing the\nnumber of check drives in all cases increases the reliability of the system,\nand is vastly superior to other approaches of ensuring reliability such as\nmirroring.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables"]}]

Here, we point out the interest in this topic in the\ninformation-theoretic context. E.g., we point out the possibility to manipulate\na pair of mutually non-interacting, non-entangled systems to employ\nentanglement of the newly defined '(sub)systems' consisting the one and the\nsame composite system. Given the different divisions of a composite system into\n\"subsystems\", the Hamiltonian of the system may perform in general\nnon-equivalent quantum computations. Redefinition of \"subsystems\" of a\ncomposite system may be regarded as a method for avoiding decoherence in the\nquantum hardware. In principle, all the notions refer to a composite system as\nsimple as the hydrogen atom.\n","Comment: 13 pages, no figures"]}]
