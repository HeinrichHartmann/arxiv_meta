The fraction of high radio loudness\n(R_K=L_radio/L_K) galaxies in the 10 Mpc Abell 3558 cluster complex at the core\nof the SSC (SSC-CR) is half as large than elsewhere. In the SSC-CR, R_K is\nanti-correlated with the density of the large-scale environment and correlated\nwith R/r200: central brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in the SSC-CR are 10x\nless radio-loud than BCGs elsewhere, with signs of suppressed radio loudness in\nthe SSC-CR also present beyond the BCGs, out to at least 0.3 r200. This\ncorrelation is nearly as strong as the tight correlation of L_K with R/r200\n(K-luminosity segregation), inside the SSC-CR. The suppression of radio\nloudness in SSC-CR BCGs can be attributed to cluster-cluster mergers that\ndestroy the cool core and thus the supply of gas to the central AGN. We\nanalytically demonstrate that the low radio loudness of non-BCG galaxies within\nSSC-CR clusters cannot be explained by direct major galaxy mergers or rapid\ngalaxy flyby collisions, but by the loss of gas supply through the enhanced ram\npressure felt when these galaxies cross the shock front between the 2 merging\nclusters and are later subjected to the stronger wind from the 2nd cluster.\n","Comment: Version consolidated with Erratum A&A 499, 45"]}]

Our model also predicts a bimodal\ndistribution (centrals and satellites) of stellar masses for given halo mass,\nin good agreement with SDSS observations. The relative importance of mergers\ndepends much more on stellar than halo mass. Galaxies with m_stars > 10^11\nM_Sun/h acquire most of their mass through mergers (mostly major and gas-poor),\nas expected from our model's shutdown of gas accretion at high M_halo. However,\nmergers are rare for m_stars < 10^11 M_Sun/h (greater than our mass\nresolution), a consequence of the curvature of the stellar vs. halo mass\nrelation. So gas accretion must be the dominant growth mechanism for\nintermediate and low mass galaxies, e.g. dwarf ellipticals in clusters, except\nthat gas-rich galaxy mergers account for the bulk of the growth of ellipticals\nwith m_stars ~ 10^10.5 M_Sun/h, which we predict must be the typical mass of\nULIRGs.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 12 figures, A&A in press (major re-write and updated\n  figures from version 1)"]}]

We propose also that the scaling relations for the particle\nvelocity variance as a function of its size, which have been first detected in\nfully resolved simulations, does not originate from inertial-scale properties\nof the background turbulent flow but it is likely to arise from the\nnon-Stokesian component of the drag produced by the wake behind the particle.\nFurthermore, by means of comparison with fully resolved simulations, we show\nthat the Faxen correction to the added mass has a dominant role in the particle\nacceleration statistics even for particle with size in the inertial range.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 9 figures"]}]

The conditional probability distribution is defined for the set\nof microstates associated with the set of phase space paths determined by\nsolutions of Hamilton's equations.

The problem concerning\nsingularity of the effective potential for the Higgs field on the horizon of a\nblack hole, which was reported earlier, is resolved. The equations\ncharacterizing the properties of the vacuum state are derived and solved in a\ncertain approximation for the Schwarzschild black hole.

If the Higgs boson mass in the flat\nspacetime is greater than or equal to 278.2 GeV, the masses of all the massive\nparticles decrease in a strong gravitational field. The Higgs boson masses\nlying in between these two values prove to lead to instability, at least at the\none-loop level, and so they are excluded.

This is mainly motivated by the fact that the HDI is bounded\nbetween 0 and 1 and that it decelerates as it approaches 1. Second, we employ\nfor individual countries the correlations between CO2 per capita emissions and\nHDI in order to extrapolate their emissions. This is an ergodic assumption.\nThird, we let countries with incomplete data records evolve similarly as their\nclose neighbors (in the emissions-HDI plane, see Fig. 1 in the main text) with\ncomplete time series of CO2 per capita emissions and HDI. Country-based\nemissions estimates are obtained by multiplying extrapolated CO2 per capita\nvalues by population numbers of three scenarios extracted from the Millennium\nEcosystem Assessment report. Finally, we propose a reduction scheme, where\ncountries with an HDI above the development threshold reduce their per capita\nCO2 emissions with a rate that is proportional to their HDI. We estimate the\nminimum proportionality constant so that the global emissions by 2050 meet the\n1000Gt limit.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables. arXiv admin note: significant text\n  overlap with arXiv:1010.3837"]}]

The properties\nof the blue loop are changed by modification of the element profiles above the\nH-burning shell, which results from the incomplete mixing in the bottom\novershooting region when stellar model evolves up along the RGB. Such\nmodification of the element profiles will lead to an increase of the opacity in\nthe region just above the H-burning shell and a decrease of the opacity in the\nouter homogeneous convection zone, which will result in a quick decrease of the\nH-shell nuclear luminosity $L_{H}$ when the stellar model evolves from the RGB\ntip to its bottom and, finally, a much weaker and smaller convection zone will\nbe obtained in the stellar envelope.

E.g., we point out the possibility to manipulate\na pair of mutually non-interacting, non-entangled systems to employ\nentanglement of the newly defined '(sub)systems' consisting the one and the\nsame composite system. Given the different divisions of a composite system into\n\"subsystems\", the Hamiltonian of the system may perform in general\nnon-equivalent quantum computations. Redefinition of \"subsystems\" of a\ncomposite system may be regarded as a method for avoiding decoherence in the\nquantum hardware. In principle, all the notions refer to a composite system as\nsimple as the hydrogen atom.\n","Comment: 13 pages, no figures"]}]
