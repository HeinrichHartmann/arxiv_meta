By analyzing the hole mobility data of p-GaAs in the\ntemperature range 10 K$<T<$100 K, we estimate the value of the appropriate\ndeformation potential for hole-phonon coupling. Due to the interplay between\nhole-phonon and hole-impurity scattering the calculated temperature-dependent\nresistivity shows interesting nonmonotonic behavior. In particular, we find\nthat there is a temperature range (typically 2 K$<T<$10 K) in which the\ncalculated resistivity becomes independent of temperature due to a subtle\ncancellation between the temperature dependent resistive scattering\ncontributions arising from impurities and phonons. This resistivity saturation\nregime appears at low carrier densities when the increasing resistivity due to\nphonon scattering compensates for the decreasing resistivity due to the\nnondegeneracy effect. This temperature-independent flat resistivity regime is\nexperimentally accessible and may have already been observed in a recent\nexperiment.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 8 figures"]}]

We use empirical stacking\nfree energies to calculate the probabilities of incorporation of the\nnucleotides. The copied strand is, to first order of approximation, a state of\nindependent and non-indentically distributed random variables for which the\nnucleotide that is incorporated by the polymerase at each step is dictated by\nthe template strand, and to second order of approximation, a state of\nnon-uniformly distributed random variables with nearest-neighbor interactions\nfor which the recognition of secondary structure by the polymerase in the\nresultant double-stranded polymer determines the entropy of the replicated\nstrand. Two incorporation mechanisms arise naturally and their biological\nmeanings are explained.

In this work,\nthe enzyme (glucose oxidase (GOX)) was immobilized on the surface of a nanotube\nnetwork, which was created by the deposition of nanotubes from their solution\nin 1,2-dichlorobenzene by the spray method. 1-Pyrenebutanoic acid succinimide\nester (PSE) was used to form the molecular interface, the bifunctional molecule\nof which provides the covalent binding with the enzyme shell, and its other\npart (pyrene) is adsorbed onto the nanotube surface. First, the usage of such a\nmolecular interface leaves out the direct adsorption of the enzyme (in this\ncase, its activity decreases) onto the nanotube surface, and, second, it\nensures the enzyme localization near the nanotube. The comparison of the\nresonance Raman (RR) spectrum of pristine nanotubes with their spectrum in the\nPSE environment evidences the creation of a nanohybrid formed by an SWNT with a\nPSE molecule which provides the further enzyme immobilization. As the RR\nspectrum of an SWNT:PSE:GOX film does not essentially differ from that of\nSWNT:PSE ones, this indicates that the molecular interface (PSE) isolates the\nenzyme from nanotubes strongly enough. The efficient immobilization of GOX\nalong the carbon nanotubes due to PSE is confirmed with atom-force microscopy\nimages. The method of molecular dynamics allowed us to establish the structures\nof SWNT:PSE:GOX created in the aqueous environment and to determine the\ninteraction energy between hybrid components.

The\nobjective is to spread multiple rumors over a graph as efficiently as possible.\nFWR accomplishes this by having nodes record which messages they have forwarded\nto each neighbor, so that each message is forwarded at most once to each\nneighbor. We prove that FWR spreads a rumor over a strongly connected digraph,\nwith high probability, in time which is within a constant factor of optimal for\ndigraphs with bounded out-degree. Moreover, on digraphs with bounded out-degree\nand bounded number of rumors, the number of transmissions required by FWR is\narbitrarily better than that of existing approaches. Specifically, FWR requires\nO(n) messages on bounded-degree graphs with n nodes, whereas classical\nforwarding and an approach based on network coding both require {\\omega}(n)\nmessages. Our results are obtained using combinatorial and probabilistic\narguments. Notably, they do not depend on expansion properties of the\nunderlying graph, and consequently the message complexity of FWR is arbitrarily\nbetter than classical forwarding even on constant-degree expander graphs, as n\n\\rightarrow \\infty. In resource-constrained applications, where each\ntransmission consumes battery power and bandwidth, our results suggest that\nusing a small amount of memory at each node leads to a significant savings.\n","Comment: 16 pages"]}]
