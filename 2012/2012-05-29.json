Although the entire cell\ncycle can be up to 24 hours long, the mitotic phase typically takes only less\nthan an hour. How does the cell keep the duration of mitosis within this limit?\nPrevious theoretical studies have suggested that the chromosome search and\ncapture is optimized by tuning the microtubule dynamic parameters to minimize\nthe search time.

We compute the mean\nsearch time for a single target by microtubules from a single nucleating site,\nusing a systematic and rigorous theoretical approach, for arbitrary kinetic\nparameters. The result is extended to multiple targets and nucleating sites by\nphysical arguments. Estimates of mitotic time scales are then obtained for\ndifferent cells using experimental data.

By making a particular coordinate transform, the calculation of the\ncusp anomalous dimension in QED or QCD can be related to the energy of a pair\nof static charges in Euclidean Anti-de-Sitter (AdS) space. This paper shows how\nthe same picture can be used to describe Wilson lines in quantum gravity. We\nshow how the relevant cusp anomalous dimension (which has recently been shown\nto be one loop exact) can be obtained using the Newtonian limit of General\nRelativity. We also show how both the QED and gravity cases emerge as special\ncases of a general formulation, and that a continuous parameter exists which\ninterpolates between them. The results may be useful in examining the relations\nbetween gauge and gravity theories.\n","Comment: 31 pages, 4 figures, version published in Physical Review D"]}]

Closest-point\nsearches in lattices can be performed as non-binary belief propagation on\nassociated TGs; soft-information output is naturally generated in the process;\nthe algorithm requires no backtrack (cf. classic sphere decoding), and extracts\nextrinsic information. A lattice's coding gain enables equivalence relations\nbetween lattice points, which can be thereby partitioned in cosets. Total and\nextrinsic a posteriori probabilities at the detector's output further enable\nthe use of soft detection information in iterative schemes. The algorithm is\nillustrated via two scenarios that transmit a 32-point, uncoded\nsuper-orthogonal (SO) constellation for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)\nchannels, carved from an 8-dimensional non-orthogonal lattice (a direct sum of\ntwo 4-dimensional checkerboard lattice): it achieves maximum likelihood\nperformance in quasistatic fading; and, performs close to interference-free\ntransmission, and identically to list sphere decoding, in independent fading\nwith coordinate interleaving and iterative equalization and detection.
