This density has a universal value, independent of the\nLaAlO3 thickness and electron mobility. The characteristics of the transition,\nits universality, and its compatibility with spectroscopic measurements\nestablish it as a transition between d-orbitals of different symmetries. A\nsimple band model, allowing for spin-orbit coupling at the atomic level,\nconnects the observed universal transition to a range of reported\nmagnetotransport properties. Interestingly, we also find that the maximum of\nthe superconducting transition temperature occurs at the same critical\ntransition, indicating a possible connection between the two phenomena. Our\nobservations demonstrate that orbital degeneracies play an important role in\nthe fascinating behavior observed so far in these oxides.\n"]}]

In this paper, we build\nincentives schemes based on social norms. Social norms prescribe a social\nstrategy for the users in the system to follow and deploy reputation schemes to\nreward or penalize users depending on their behaviors. Because users in these\nsystems often have only limited capability to observe the global system\ninformation, e.g. the reputation distribution of the users participating in the\nsystem, their beliefs about the reputation distribution are heterogeneous and\nbiased. Such belief heterogeneity causes a positive fraction of users to not\nfollow the social strategy. In such practical scenarios, the standard\nequilibrium analysis deployed in the economics literature is no longer directly\napplicable and hence, the system design needs to consider these differences. To\ninvestigate how the system designs need to change when the participating users\nhave only limited observations, we focus on a simple social norm with binary\nreputation labels but allow adjusting the punishment severity through\nrandomization. First, we model the belief heterogeneity using a suitable\nBayesian belief function. Next, we formalize the users' optimal decision\nproblems and derive in which scenarios they follow the prescribed social\nstrategy. With this result, we then study the system dynamics and formally\ndefine equilibrium in the sense that the system is stable when users\nstrategically optimize their decisions. By rigorously studying two specific\ncases where users' belief distribution is constant or is linearly influenced by\nthe true reputation distribution, we prove that the optimal reputation update\nrule is to choose the mildest possible punishment.

Here we\npresent three adaptive mesh refinement radiation hydrodynamics simulations that\nillustrate the impact of momentum transfer from ionising radiation to the\nabsorbing gas on star formation in high-redshift dwarf galaxies. Momentum\ntransfer is calculated by solving the radiative transfer equation with a ray\ntracing algorithm that is adaptive in spatial and angular coordinates. We find\nthat momentum input partially affects star formation by increasing the\nturbulent support to a three-dimensional rms velocity equal to the circular\nvelocity of early haloes. Compared to a calculation that neglects radiation\npressure, the star formation rate is decreased by a factor of five to 1.8 x\n10^{-2} Msun/yr in a dwarf galaxy with a dark matter and stellar mass of 2.0 x\n10^8 and 4.5 x 10^5 solar masses, respectively, when radiation pressure is\nincluded. Its mean metallicity of 10^{-2.1} Z_sun is consistent with the\nobserved dwarf galaxy luminosity-metallicity relation. However, what one may\nnaively expect from the calculation without radiation pressure, the central\nregion of the galaxy overcools and produces a compact, metal-rich stellar\npopulation with an average metallicity of 0.3 Z_sun, indicative of an incorrect\nphysical recipe. In addition to photo-heating in HII regions, radiation\npressure further drives dense gas from star forming regions, so supernovae\nfeedback occurs in a warmer and more diffuse medium, launching metal-rich\noutflows. Capturing this aspect and a temporal separation between the start of\nradiative and supernova feedback are numerically important in the modeling of\ngalaxies to avoid the \"overcooling problem\".

In the\nsingle-degenerate (SD) scenario, the interaction between the SN blast wave and\nthe outer layers of a main sequence (MS) companion star strips off H-rich\nmaterial which is then mixed into the ejecta. Strong contamination of the SN\nejecta with stripped material could lead to a conflict with observations of SNe\nIa. This constrains the SD progenitor model. In this work, our previous\nsimulations based on simplified progenitor donor stars have been updated by\nadopting more realistic progenitor-system models that result from fully\ndetailed, state-of-the-art binary evolution calculations. We use Eggleton's\nstellar evolution code including the optically thick accretion wind model and\nthe possibility of the effects of accretion disk instabilities to obtain\nrealistic models of companions for different progenitor systems. The impact of\nthe SN blast wave on these companion stars is followed in three-dimensional\nhydrodynamic simulations employing the SPH code GADGET3. We find that the\nstripped masses range from 0.11 to 0.18 M_sun. The kick velocity is between 51\nand 105 km/s.

Results: Using Stokes I and V for\nsimultaneous magnetic and temperature mapping for the star with a homogeneous\ntemperature distribution yields magnetic field strengths underestimated by\ntypically 10-15% relative to their true values. When temperature is kept\nconstant and Stokes I is not used for magnetic mapping, the underestimation is\n30-60%.

Since $^{63}^Ni$ is a\npure $\\beta^-$ emitter, in this report the energy loss $dE/dx$ of $\\beta^-$ in\nour scintillation material (phosphorus $^{15}P$) is modelled using C++ coding\nwith GEANT4 and furthermore the particle distributions in two different source\ngeometries (circular and square structure) is studied using Finite Element\nAnalysis (FEA). We have shown the ${63}Ni$ $\\beta$ energy spectrum absorption\nin ${15}^P$, where upto energy range 28keV had nearly 100% efficiency. The\noptimum thickness therefore was 800$\\mu m$.\n"]}]

The initial population\nhas a single mutant of a fitness value $r$, residing at some vertex $v$, while\nevery other individual has initially fitness 1. The main quantity of interest\nis the fixation probability, i.e. the probability that eventually the whole\ngraph is occupied by descendants of the mutant. In this work we concentrate on\nthe fixation probability when the mutant is initially on a specific vertex $v$.\nWe then aim at finding graphs that have many \"strong starts\" (or many \"weak\nstarts\") for the mutant. Thus we introduce a parameterized notion of selective\namplifiers/suppressors, i.e. graphs with at least some $h(n)$ vertices\n(starting points of the mutant), which fixate the graph with large (resp.\nsmall) probability. We prove the existence of strong selective amplifiers and\nof quite strong selective suppressors. Regarding the traditional notion of\nfixation probability from a random start, we provide the first non-trivial\nupper and lower bounds: first we demonstrate the non-existence of \"strong\nuniversal\" amplifiers, i.e. we prove that for any graph the fixation\nprobability from a random start is at most $1-\\frac{c(r)}{n^{3/4}}$.

If the system undergoes a second measurement, the statistics of the\nfirst output can be conditioned on the value of the second one. This procedure\nis known as postselection. A postselected weak measurement of an observable can\ngive a large average output of the probe when the postselected state is nearly\northogonal to the initial state of the system. This large value is an\ninterference effect in the readout of the probe, which is initially in a\ncoherent superposition of readout states (also known as pointer states).\nUsually, the weak interaction between system and probe is considered\ninstantaneous, so that the dynamics of the probe can be neglected.

Conformal mappings\nhave been widely used to obtain a diffeomorphism between shapes that minimizes\nangular distortion. Conformal registrations are beneficial since it preserves\nthe local geometry well. However, when landmark constraints are enforced,\nconformal mappings generally do not exist. This motivates us to look for a\nunique landmark matching quasi-conformal registration, which minimizes the\nconformality distortion. Under suitable condition on the landmark constraints,\na unique diffeomporphism, called the Teichm\\\"uller extremal mapping between two\nsurfaces can be obtained, which minimizes the maximal conformality distortion.\nIn this paper, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm, called the\nQuasi-conformal (QC) iterations, to compute the Teichm\\\"uller mapping. The\nbasic idea is to represent the set of diffeomorphisms using Beltrami\ncoefficients (BCs), and look for an optimal BC associated to the desired\nTeichm\\\"uller mapping. The associated diffeomorphism can be efficiently\nreconstructed from the optimal BC using the Linear Beltrami Solver(LBS). Using\nBCs to represent diffeomorphisms guarantees the diffeomorphic property of the\nregistration. Using our proposed method, the Teichm\\\"uller mapping can be\naccurately and efficiently computed within 10 seconds. The obtained\nregistration is guaranteed to be bijective. The proposed algorithm can also be\nextended to compute Teichm\\\"uller mapping with soft landmark constraints. We\napplied the proposed algorithm to real applications, such as brain landmark\nmatching registration, constrained texture mapping and human face registration.\nExperimental results shows that our method is both effective and efficient in\ncomputing a non-overlap landmark matching registration with least amount of\nconformality distortion.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 21 figures"]}]

The classical Tonelli's theorem in the calculus of variations\ncorresponds, then, to the well known result that global hyperbolicity implies\ncausal simplicity.

The minimum of positive graduation in actual measurement\nprovides the possibility that an object cannot be partitioned arbitrarily,\ne.g., an interval $[0, 1]$ cannot be partitioned by arbitrarily infinite times\nto keep compatible with the minimum of positive size. For the measurement on\nsize of set, it can be assumed that this minimum is the size of ${0}$, in\nsymbols $|{0}|$ or graduation 1.

Bio-inspired political systems are presented as the\nbest alternative for organizing human sociopolitical interactions as\ncomputation and microelectronics-based technology profoundly modify the ways in\nwhich humans decide. Therefore, weakening classical political systems. For\ninstance, dwindling top-down power structures, modifying the notion of\ngeographical spatiality and augmenting the political granularity. We also argue\nthat, more than a new theoretical proposal, bio-inspired political systems are\ncoming to be the political systems of the future.\n","Comment: Paper accepted at the ECCS 12, European Conference on Complex Systems\n  2012. 27 pages, 7 figures"]}]

The main current problem is to\nunderstand to what degree GRBs are biased tracers of star formation. If GRBs\nare only formed by low-metallicity stars, then their host galaxies will not\ngive a representative view of where stars are formed in the Universe (at least\nnot a low redshifts). On the other hand, if there is no dependency on\nmetallicity then the nature of the host galaxies leads to the perhaps\nsurprising conclusion that most stars are formed in dwarf galaxies.
