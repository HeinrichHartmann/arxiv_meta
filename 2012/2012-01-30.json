This is a sequential\nMonte Carlo algorithm in the theta-dimension, that samples values of theta,\nreweights iteratively these values using the likelihood increments\np(y_t|y_1:t-1, theta), and rejuvenates the theta-particles through a resampling\nstep and a MCMC update step. In state-space models these likelihood increments\nare intractable in most cases, but they may be unbiasedly estimated by a\nparticle filter in the x-dimension, for any fixed theta.

First of all, we test the\neffect of acceleration location on the emission in several XRT filters by\nsimulating a series of post flare loops with different injection points for the\nnon-thermal particle beams. We use an injection distribution peaked at the loop\napex to represent a direct acceleration model, and an injection distribution\npeaked at the footpoints to represent the Alf\\'en wave interaction model. We\nfind that footpoint injection leads to several early peaks in the\napex-tofootpoint emission ratio. Second, we model a loop with cusp-shaped\ngeometry based on the eruptionmodel developed by Lin & Forbes (2000) and\nReeves& Forbes (2005a), and find that early in the flare, emission in the loop\nfootpoints is much brighter in the XRT filters if non-thermal particles are\nincluded in the calculation. Finally, we employ a multi-loop flare model to\nsimulate thermal emission and compare with a previous model where a\nsemi-circular geometry was used (Reeves et al. 2007). We compare the\nGeostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) emission from the two\nmodels and find that the cusp-shaped geometry leads to a smaller GOES class\nflare.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 9 figures, invited talk at the Hinode 4 conference"]}]

Results: (1) During the first ~40% of the lifetime of a cluster the\ncluster simply gets fainter due to the loss of stars by tidal effects. (2)\nBetween ~40 and ~80% of its lifetime the cluster gets bluer due to the loss of\nlow-mass stars. This will result in an underestimate of the age of clusters if\nstandard cluster evolution models are used (0.15 -- 0.5 dex). (3) After ~80% of\nthe total lifetime of a cluster it will rapidly get redder. This is because\nstars at the low-mass end of the main sequence, which are preferentially lost,\nare bluer than the AGB stars that dominate the light at long wavelengths,\nresulting in an age overestimate.

Therefore it will\nbe difficult to distinguish this effect from that due to the cluster age for\nunresolved clusters, unless the total lifetime of the clusters can be\nestimated.

Early studies have revealed a clear dichotomy\nbetween old globular clusters and young clusters, with the former characterised\nby Gaussian-shaped LFs, and the latter following a power law. Recently, this\nview was challenged by studies of galaxy merger remnants and post-starburst\ngalaxies.

The\nAntennae galaxies represent a very active and complex star-forming environment,\nwhich hampers cluster selection and photometry as well as the determination of\nobservational completeness fractions.

The resulting LFs are fitted both with Gaussian and with power-law\ndistributions, taking into account both the observational completeness\nfractions and photometric errors, and compared using a likelihood ratio test.\nThe likelihood ratio results are rigidly evaluated using Monte Carlo\nsimulations. We perform a number of additional tests, e.g. with subsets of the\ntotal sample, all confirming our main result: that a Gaussian distribution fits\nthe observed LFs of clusters in this preferentially very young cluster system\nsignificantly better than a power-law distribution, at a (statistical) error\nprobability of less than 0.5 per cent.\n","Comment: accepted for publication in MNRAS, some references badly set due to\n  shortcomings of MNRAS BIBTEX style, Fig.1 slightly degraded quality"]}]
