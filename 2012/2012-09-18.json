The SN had a peak\nluminosity, M_R ~ -20.2 mag, significantly more luminous than known GRB-SNe and\none of the most luminous SNe Ib/c ever discovered. The absorption velocity of\nSN 2010ay is v_Si ~ 19,000 km/s at ~40 days after explosion, 2-5 times higher\nthan other broad-lined SNe and similar to the GRB-SN 2010bh at comparable\nepochs. Moreover, the velocity declines ~2 times slower than other SNe Ic-BL\nand GRB-SNe. Assuming that the optical emission is powered by radioactive\ndecay, the peak magnitude implies the synthesis of an unusually large mass of\n56 Ni, M_Ni = 0.9 M_solar. Modeling of the light-curve points to a total ejecta\nmass, M_ej ~ 4.7 M_sol, and total kinetic energy, E_K ~ 11x10^51 ergs. The\nratio of M_Ni to M_ej is ~2 times as large for SN 2010ay as typical GRB-SNe and\nmay suggest an additional energy reservoir. The metallicity (log(O/H)_PP04 + 12\n= 8.19) of the explosion site within the host galaxy places SN 2010ay in the\nlow-metallicity regime populated by GRB-SNe, and ~0.5(0.2) dex lower than that\ntypically measured for the host environments of normal (broad-lined) Ic\nsupernovae. We constrain any gamma-ray emission with E_gamma < 6x10^{48} erg\n(25-150 keV) and our deep radio follow-up observations with the Expanded Very\nLarge Array rule out relativistic ejecta with energy, E > 10^48 erg. We\ntherefore rule out the association of a relativistic outflow like those which\naccompanied SN 1998bw and traditional long-duration GRBs, but place\nless-stringent constraints on a weak afterglow like that seen from XRF 060218.\nThese observations challenge the importance of progenitor metallicity for the\nproduction of a GRB, and suggest that other parameters also play a key role.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 10 figures, V3 has revisions following referee's report;\n  more information at\n  http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~nsanders/papers/2010ay/summary.html"]}]

Reconstruction of the full interaction path\nresults in a detector with very high efficiency and excellent spectral\nresponse. The realization of gamma-ray tracking and AGATA is a result of many\ntechnical advances. These include the development of encapsulated\nhighly-segmented germanium detectors assembled in a triple cluster detector\ncryostat, an electronics system with fast digital sampling and a data\nacquisition system to process the data at a high rate. The full\ncharacterization of the crystals was measured and compared with\ndetector-response simulations. This enabled pulse-shape analysis algorithms, to\nextract energy, time and position, to be employed. In addition, tracking\nalgorithms for event reconstruction were developed. The first phase of AGATA is\nnow complete and operational in its first physics campaign. In the future AGATA\nwill be moved between laboratories in Europe and operated in a series of\ncampaigns to take advantage of the different beams and facilities available to\nmaximize its science output.

Both observations indicate that the low dimensionality\nof LaFe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$AsO is likely to lead to a more complex vortex\nphase-diagram when compared to the other Fe arsenides and consequently, to a\npronounced dissipation associated with the movement of vortices in a possible\nvortex liquid phase. When compared to, for instance, F-doped compounds\npertaining to same family, we obtain rather small activation energies for the\nmotion of vortices. This suggests that the disorder introduced by doping\nLaFeAsO with F is more effective in pinning the vortices than alloying it with\nCo.\n","Comment: 7 figures, 7 pages, Phys. Rev. B (in press)"]}]

Prior work has identified many\nbehavioral, molecular biological and single neuron changes throughout the\nmesocorticolimbic system that reflect and drive addictive behavior.\nSubpopulations in the ventral tegemental area (VTA) encode positive reward\nprediction error, negative reward prediction error, and the magnitude of the\nreward. Phasic activity in VTA dopaminergic neurons correlates with hedonic\nvalue. Tonic activity of groups in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC)\ncan encode antidepressant states. However, little is known about how drug\naddiction might affect population encoding across larger brain regions. Here,\nwe compare the information content associated with network patterns in naive,\nacutely intoxicated and chronically addicted states in a plastic attractor\nnetwork. We found that addiction decreases the network's ability to store and\ndiscriminate among patterns of activity. Altered dopaminergic tone flattens the\nenergy landscape and decreases the entropy associated with each network\npattern. Altered dmPFC activity produces signal-to-noise deficits similar to\ncomputational models of schizophrenia. Our results provide a conceptual\nframework for interpreting altered neural population dynamics in\npsychopathological states based on information theory. They also suggest a view\nof the subtypes of depression as on a continuum of combinations of cortical and\nsubcortical dysfunction. This suggests that patients who suffer from depression\nwith psychotic features will have more cortical than mesolimbic dysfunction.\nFurthermore, our framework can be applied to other psychiatric illnesses and so\nmay help us, in general, quantitatively understand psychiatric illnesses as\ndisorders in the representation and processing of information by distributed\nbrain networks.\n"]}]

This feature can be very useful to probe the superdense core\nmatter of neutron stars, and the strong gravity regime. However, although many\nmodels exist in the literature, the physical origin of kHz QPO is not known,\nand hence this feature cannot be used as a tool yet. The energy dependence of\nkHz QPO fractional rms amplitude is an important piece of the jigsaw puzzle to\nunderstand the physical origin of this timing feature. It is known that the\nfractional rms amplitude increases with energy at lower energies. At higher\nenergies, the amplitude is usually believed to saturate, although this is not\nestablished. We combine tens of lower kHz QPOs from a neutron star LMXB 4U\n1728-34 in order to improve the signal-to-noise-ratio. Consequently, we, for\nthe first time to the best of our knowledge, find a significant and systematic\ndecrease of the fractional rms amplitude with energy at higher photon energies.\nAssuming an energy spectrum model, blackbody+powerlaw, we explore if the\nsinusoidal variation of a single spectral parameter can reproduce the above\nmentioned fractional rms amplitude behavior. Our analysis suggests that the\noscillation of any single blackbody parameter is favored over the oscillation\nof any single powerlaw parameter, in order to explain the measured amplitude\nbehavior.

The best currently known\ninteractive debugging systems rely upon some meta information in terms of fault\nprobabilities, which can speed up the debugging procedure in the good case, but\ncan also have negative impact on the performance in the bad case. The problem\nis that assessment of the meta information is only possible a-posteriori.\nConsequently, as long as the actual fault is unknown, there is always some risk\nof suboptimal interactive diagnoses discrimination. As an alternative, one\nmight prefer to rely on a tool which pursues a no-risk strategy. In this case,\nhowever, possibly well-chosen meta information cannot be exploited, resulting\nagain in inefficient debugging actions. In this work we present a reinforcement\nlearning strategy that continuously adapts its behavior depending on the\nperformance achieved and minimizes the risk of using low-quality meta\ninformation. Therefore, this method is suitable for application scenarios where\nreliable a-priori fault estimates are difficult to obtain. Using problematic\nontologies in the field of ontology matching, we show that the proposed\nrisk-aware query strategy outperforms both active learning approaches and\nno-risk strategies on average in terms of required amount of user interaction.\n"]}]

The first technique uses the classical $GL_2\n(k)$-invariants of binary forms. This is a practical method for curves of small\ngenus, but has limitations as the genus increases, due to the fact that such\ninvariants are not known for large genus.\n  The second approach, which uses dihedral invariants of hyperelliptic curves,\nis a very convenient method and works well in all genera. First we define the\nnormal decomposition of a hyperelliptic curve with extra automorphisms. Then\ndihedral invariants are defined in terms of the coefficients of this normal\ndecomposition. We define such invariants independently of the automorphism\ngroup $\\Aut (\\X_g)$. However, to compute such invariants the curve is required\nto be in its normal form. This requires solving a nonlinear system of\nequations.\n  We find conditions in terms of classical invariants of binary forms for a\ncurve to have reduced automorphism group $A_4$, $S_4$, $A_5$.
