White phase noise results from adding white noise to the RF\nspectrum around the carrier. For a given amount of RF noise added, noise is\nproportional to the inverse of the carrier power. By contrast, the 1/f\ncoefficient is a constant parameter of the amplifier, in a wide range of\ncarrier power. This fact has amazing consequences on different amplifier\ntopologies. Connecting m equal amplifiers in parallel, flicker is 1/m times\nthat of one device. Cascading m equal amplifiers, flicker is m times that of\none amplifier. Recirculating the signal in an amplifier so that the gain\nincreases by a power of m (a factor of m in dB) due to positive feedback\n(regeneration), which for integer m is similar to the case of m amplifiers, we\nfind that flicker is m^2 times that of the amplifier alone.\n  Starting from the fact that near-dc flicker exists in all electronic devices,\nalthough generally not accessible from outside, the simplest model for the 1/f\nphase noise is that the near-dc 1/f noise phase-modulates the carrier through\nsome parametric effect in the semiconductor.

This method\nallows us to study homogeneously the morphology of local and distant galaxies.\nThe first step has been to study the evolution of galaxies using the IMAGES\nsurvey. This survey allowed us to establish the kinematic state of distant\ngalaxies, to study the chemical evolution of galaxies over the past 8 Gyr, and\nto test important dynamical relations such as the Tully-Fisher relation. The\ninformation gained from kinematics is, indeed, crucial to guarantee a robust\nunderstanding of the different physical processes leading to the present day\nHubble sequence. Using Integral Field Spectroscopy, we have been able to test\nour new morphological classification against the kinematic state of each\ngalaxy. We found that the morpho-kinematic correlation is much better using our\nclassification than other morphological classifications. Applying our\nmorphological classification to a representative sample of both local and\ndistant galaxies, having equivalent observational data, we obtained a Hubble\nsequence both in the local and distant Universe. Our results strongly suggest\nthat more than half of the present-day spirals had peculiar morphologies, 6 Gyr\nago.

Here, the practitioner incorporates side information in the form of\n\"must be clustered\" or \"must be separated\" labels for data point pairs. Each\nsuch piece of information comes at a \"query cost\" (often involving human\nresponse solicitation). The collection of labels is then incorporated in the\nusual clustering algorithm as either strict or as soft constraints, possibly\nadding a pairwise constraint penalty function to the chosen clustering\nobjective.\n  Our work is mostly related to clustering with side information. We ask how to\nchoose the pairs of data points. Our analysis gives rise to a method provably\nbetter than simply choosing them uniformly at random. Roughly speaking, we show\nthat the distribution must be biased so as more weight is placed on pairs\nincident to elements in smaller clusters in some optimal solution. Of course we\ndo not know the optimal solution, hence we don't know the bias. Using the\nrecently introduced method of $\\eps$-smooth relative regret approximations of\nAilon, Begleiter and Ezra, we can show an iterative process that improves both\nthe clustering and the bias in tandem. The process provably converges to the\noptimal solution faster (in terms of query cost) than an algorithm selecting\npairs uniformly.\n"]}]

My\npreferred example of this sort is that the OPERA result might be the first\nobservation of a previously unnoticed effect, belonging to a family of effects\nwhich includes those responsible for the well-known peculiar properties of the\n\"tunneling time\". Tentative support for this specific hypothesis comes from the\npresence of evanescence and \"postselection\", and the observation that the\nfraction of neutrinos absorbed in rock on the way from CERN to LNGS is of a few\nparts in $10^5$, i.e. comparable to the fraction of the overall travel time by\nwhich OPERA neutrinos are found to reach LNGS earlier than expected. This leads\nme to stress that the OPERA result is still consistent with subluminality of a\nsuitably \"postselection-corrected\" velocity. Adopting the popular (but here\ndisfavored) interpretation of the OPERA result as a \"signal velocity\" one could\nobtain superluminal values of the postselection-corrected velocity in some\ntechnologically feasible OPERA-like setups, a prediction which I propose to\ntest. I also propose a semi-heuristic formula for the \"rock dwell time\" and\nfind that it gives a result in rough agreement with the OPERA travel-time\nmeasurements. This suggests that effects similar to the ones found for OPERA's\nmuon neutrinos should also be found, but with tangibly different magnitude, for\nmuon anti-neutrinos under similar experimental conditions.

In order to capture the\nimperfections in node oscillators, which may render a time-varying nature to\nthe clock offset, a novel Bayesian approach to the clock offset estimation is\nproposed by using a factor graph representation of the posterior density.\nMessage passing using the max-product algorithm yields a closed form expression\nfor the Bayesian inference problem. Several lower bounds on the variance of an\nestimator are derived for arbitrary exponential family distributed likelihood\nfunctions which, while serving as stepping stones to benchmark the performance\nof the proposed clock offset estimators, can be useful in their own right in\nclassical as well Bayesian parameter estimation theory. To corroborate the\ntheoretical findings, extensive simulation results are discussed for classical\nas well as Bayesian estimators in various scenarios. It is observed that the\nperformance of the proposed estimators is fairly close to the fundamental\nlimits established by the lower bounds.\n"]}]
