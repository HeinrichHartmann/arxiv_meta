Using Kurucz's WIDTH9 program and the spectrum synthesis code,\nSYNSPEC, we determined the atmospheric parameters and abundances. The\nphotospheric abundances were derived under the LTE approximation. The NEBULAR\npackage under IRAF was used to estimate the electron temperature (T_e) and the\nelectron density (N_e) from the [N II] and [S II] lines.\n  Results: We estimated T_eff=24000 K, log g=3.0, xi_t=7 kms^{-1}. The derived\nCNO abundances suggest an evolved star with C/O < 1. P-Cygni profiles of\nhydrogen and helium indicate ongoing post-AGB mass loss. The presence of [N II]\nand [S II] lines and the non-detection of [O III] indicate that photoionisation\nhas just started.

The idea is\nthat a randomized query satisfies differential privacy if the likelihood of\nobtaining a certain answer for a database $x$ is not too different from the\nlikelihood of obtaining the same answer on adjacent databases, i.e. databases\nwhich differ from $x$ for only one individual.

In this paper, we analyze critically the\nnotion of differential privacy in light of the conceptual framework provided by\nthe R\\'enyi min information theory.

Depending on these symmetries we can also build an optimal-utility\nrandomization mechanism while preserving the required level of differential\nprivacy.

We call these payoffs\nas localized payoffs. In this game, the payoff of each individual captures (1)\nthe gain from immediate neighbors, (2) the bridging benefits, and (3) the cost\nto form links. This implies that the payoff of each individual can be computed\nusing only its single-hop neighbourhood information. Based on this simple model\nof network formation, our study explores the structure of networks that form,\nsatisfying one or both of the properties, namely, pairwise stability and\nefficiency. We analytically prove the pairwise stability of several interesting\nnetwork structures, notably, the complete bi-partite network, complete\nequi-k-partite network, complete network and cycle network, under various\nconfigurations of the model. We validate and extend these results through\nextensive simulations. We characterize topologies of efficient networks by\ndrawing upon classical results from extremal graph theory and discover that the\nTuran graph (or the complete equi-bi-partite network) is the unique efficient\nnetwork under many configurations of parameters. We examine the tradeoffs\nbetween topologies of pairwise stable networks and efficient networks using the\nnotion of price of stability, which is the ratio of the sum of payoffs of the\nplayers in an optimal pairwise stable network to that of an efficient network.\nInterestingly, we find that price of stability is equal to 1 for almost all\nconfigurations of parameters in the proposed model; and for the rest of the\nconfigurations of the parameters, we obtain a lower bound of 0.5 on the price\nof stability.

In a\nlarge WSN, consider $n$ collaborative sensor devices distributed randomly to\nacquire information and learn about a certain field. Such sensors have less\npower, small bandwidth, and short memory, and they might disappear from the\nnetwork after certain time of operations. The goal of this work is to design\nefficient strategies to learn about the field by collecting sensed data from\nthese $n$ sensors with less computational overhead and efficient storage\nencoding operations.\n  In this data collection system, we propose two distributed data storage\nalgorithms (DSA's) to solve this problem with the means of network flooding and\nconnectivity among sensor devices. In the first algorithm denoted, DSA-I, it's\nassumed that the total number of nodes is known for each node in the network.\nWe show that this algorithm is efficient in terms of the encoding/decoding\noperations. Furthermore, every node uses network flooding to disseminate its\ndata throughout the network using mixing time approximately O(n). In the second\nalgorithm denoted, DSA-II, it's assumed that the total number of nodes is not\nknown for each learning sensor, hence dissemination of the data does not depend\non the value of $n$. In this case we show that the encoding operations take\n$O(C\\mu^2)$, where $\\mu$ is the mean degree of the network graph and $C$ is a\nsystem parameter. Performance of these two algorithms match the derived\ntheoretical results.

Charm and bottom quarks have been predicted to\ninteract with the medium differently than the light quarks; a study of heavy\nquark interactions with the medium provides an important test of theoretical\nmodels of the quark-gluon plasma.\n  The spectrum of non-photonic electrons (and positrons) is dominated by\nelectrons from the semileptonic decays of D and B mesons. Therefore,\nnon-photonic electrons serve as proxies for heavy quarks. A measurement of the\nmodification of the non-photonic electron spectrum in nucleus-nucleus\ncollisions relative to p + p collisions allows the interactions of heavy quarks\nwith the medium to be studied. Previous measurements indicate that\nhigh-transverse-momentum non-photonic electrons are suppressed in Au + Au\ncollisions at 200 GeV (center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair) relative to p +\np collisions at the same energy.

By looking at the\nspherical harmonic expansions, we obtain a system of 1+1-dimension hyperbolic\nequations, which provide a good machinery to attack problems of spherical mean\ntransform.\n  As showcases, we discuss two known problems. The first one is a local\nuniqueness problem investigated by M. Agranovsky and P. Kuchment, [{\\em Memoirs\non Differential Equations and Mathematical Physics}, 52:1--16, 2011]. We\npresent a simple proof which works even under a weaker condition. The second\nproblem is to characterize the kernel of spherical mean transform on annular\nregions, which was studied by C. Epstein and B. Kleiner [{\\em Comm. Pure Appl.\nMath.}, 46(3):441--451, 1993]. We present a short proof that simultaneously\nobtains the necessity and sufficiency for the characterization. As a\nconsequence, we derive a reconstruction procedure for the transform with\nadditional interior (or exterior) information.\n  We also discuss how the approach works for the hyperbolic and spherical\nspaces.\n","Comment: 10 pages"]}]

A Monte Carlo stochastic\nwavefunction method is applied to simulate semiclassically the atomic dynamics\nwith coupled internal and translational degrees of freedom.

As hair bundles move, the viscous\nfriction between stereocilia and the surrounding liquid poses a fundamental\nchallenge to the ear's high sensitivity and sharp frequency selectivity. Part\nof the solution to this problem lies in the active process that uses energy for\nfrequency-selective sound amplification. Here we demonstrate that a\ncomplementary part involves the fluid-structure interaction between the liquid\nwithin the hair bundle and the stereocilia. Using force measurement on a\ndynamically scaled model, finite-element analysis, analytical estimation of\nhydrodynamic forces, stochastic simulation and high-resolution interferometric\nmeasurement of hair bundles, we characterize the origin and magnitude of the\nforces between individual stereocilia during small hair-bundle deflections. We\nfind that the close apposition of stereocilia effectively immobilizes the\nliquid between them, which reduces the drag and suppresses the relative\nsqueezing but not the sliding mode of stereociliary motion. The obliquely\noriented tip links couple the mechanotransduction channels to this least\ndissipative coherent mode, whereas the elastic horizontal top connectors\nstabilize the structure, further reducing the drag. As measured from the\ndistortion products associated with channel gating at physiological stimulation\namplitudes of tens of nanometres, the balance of forces in a hair bundle\npermits a relative mode of motion between adjacent stereocilia that encompasses\nonly a fraction of a nanometre.

We find that the entanglement exhibits a critical behavior\ncontrolled by the competition between the exchange interaction $J$ and the\nexternal magnetic field. The entanglement shows a quasi-symmetric behavior\nabove and below a critical value of the exchange interaction. It becomes more\nsymmetric as the external magnetic field increases. The entanglement reaches a\nlarge saturation value, close to unity, when the exchange interaction is far\nabove or below its critical value and a small one as it closely approaches the\ncritical value. Furthermore, we find that the decay rate profile of\nentanglement is linear when the exchange interaction is much higher or lower\nthan the critical value but converts to a power law and finally to a Gaussian\nas the critical value is approached from both directions.
