Here we show\nthat by engineering the dynamics of coupled quantum systems, it is possible to\nconstruct a subsystem that evades the measurement back action of quantum\nmechanics, at all times of interest, and obeys any classical dynamics, linear\nor nonlinear, that we choose. We call such a system a quantum-mechanics-free\nsubsystem (QMFS). All of the observables of a QMFS are quantum-nondemolition\n(QND) observables; moreover, they are dynamical QND observables, thus\ndemolishing the widely held belief that QND observables are constants of\nmotion. QMFSs point to a new strategy for designing classical\ninformation-processing devices in regimes where quantum noise is detrimental,\nunifying previous approaches that employ QND observables, back-action evasion,\nand quantum noise cancellation. Potential applications include\ngravitational-wave detection, optomechanical force sensing, atomic\nmagnetometry, and classical computing. Demonstrations of dynamical QMFSs\ninclude the generation of broad-band squeezed light for use in interferometric\ngravitational-wave detection, experiments using entangled atomic spin\nensembles, and implementations of the quantum Toffoli gate.\n","Comment: v2: changed the title, added a figure, and made some minor updates"]}]

We explain our observations by\nconsidering finite-size scaling of free energy densities of general weakly\nanisotropic models on a d-dimensional film, i.e., in an L x infinity^(d-1)\ngeometry, with bc in the finite direction that are invariant under a shear\ntransformation relating the anisotropic and isotropic cases.

The bulk MgB2 samples were fabricated by uniaxial hot pressing, which\nis a readily scalable, industrial technique, to 91% of their maximum\ntheoretical density. The macroscopic critical current density derived from the\ntrapped field data using the Biot-Savart law is consistent with the measured\nlocal critical current density. From this we conclude that critical current\ndensity, and therefore trapped field performance, is limited by the flux\npinning available in MgB2, rather than by lack of connectivity. This suggests\nstrongly that both increasing sample size and enhancing pinning through doping\nwill allow further increases in trapped field performance of bulk MgB2.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures.

The loss of methylation can be active\nwhere enzyme physically breaks the bond, or passive where on cell division the\nnewly constructed strand of DNA is not properly inherited.\n  Here we present a mathematical model of single locus passive demethylation\nfor a dividing population of cells. The model describes the heterogenity in the\npopulation expected from passive mechanisms.

First it does not learn meta-models that provide\nsupport only for the learning algorithm selection task but ones that support\nthe whole data-mining process. In addition it abandons the so called black-box\napproach to algorithm description followed in meta-learning. Now in addition to\nthe datasets, algorithms also have descriptors, workflows as well. For the\nlatter two these descriptions are semantic, describing properties of the\nalgorithms. With the availability of descriptors both for datasets and data\nmining workflows the traditional modelling techniques followed in\nmeta-learning, typically based on classification and regression algorithms, are\nno longer appropriate. Instead we are faced with a problem the nature of which\nis much more similar to the problems that appear in recommendation systems. The\nmost important meta-mining requirements are that suggestions should use only\ndatasets and workflows descriptors and the cold-start problem, e.g. providing\nworkflow suggestions for new datasets.\n  In this paper we take a different view on the meta-mining modelling problem\nand treat it as a recommender problem. In order to account for the meta-mining\nspecificities we derive a novel metric-based-learning recommender approach. Our\nmethod learns two homogeneous metrics, one in the dataset and one in the\nworkflow space, and a heterogeneous one in the dataset-workflow space. All\nlearned metrics reflect similarities established from the dataset-workflow\npreference matrix. We demonstrate our method on meta-mining over biological\n(microarray datasets) problems. The application of our method is not limited to\nthe meta-mining problem, its formulations is general enough so that it can be\napplied on problems with similar requirements.\n"]}]

This term, which is proportional to a fixed\n4-vector $b_\\mu$, violates Lorentz symmetry and may originate a CPT-even\nLorentz breaking term in the photon sector. It is shown that this Lorentz\nbreaking CPT-even term is generated and that,in addition, the chiral nonminimal\ncoupling requires this term is present from the beginning. The\nnonrenormalizability of the model is invoked in the discussion of this fact and\nthe result is confronted with the one from a model with a Lorentz-violating\nnonminimal coupling without chirality.\n","Comment: 7 pages, to appear in Journal of Physics G"]}]

The Tchebyshev transform\n(of the first kind) preserves desirable combinatorial properties, including\nEulerianess (due to Hetyei) and EL-shellability. It is also a linear\ntransformation on flag vectors. When restricted to Eulerian posets, it\ncorresponds to the Billera, Ehrenborg and Readdy omega map of oriented\nmatroids. One consequence is that nonnegativity of the cd-index is maintained.\n  The Tchebyshev transform of the second kind is a Hopf algebra endomorphism on\nthe space of quasisymmetric functions QSym. It coincides with Stembridge's peak\nenumerator for Eulerian posets, but differs for general posets.
