We first consider mixed packing and covering\nlinear programs, where packing constraints are given offline and covering\nconstraints are received online. The objective is to minimize the maximum\nmultiplicative factor by which any packing constraint is violated, while\nsatisfying the covering constraints. No prior sublinear competitive algorithms\nare known for this problem. We give the first such --- a\npolylogarithmic-competitive algorithm for solving mixed packing and covering\nlinear programs online.

While exponential penalty functions\nare used previously to solve linear programs offline approximately, offline\nalgorithms know the constraints beforehand and can optimize greedily. In\ncontrast, when constraints arrive online, updates need to be more complex.\n  We apply our techniques to solve two online fixed-charge problems with\ncongestion. These problems are motivated by applications in machine scheduling\nand facility location. The linear program for these problems is more\ncomplicated than mixed packing and covering, and presents unique challenges.

This new theory, \"shape dynamics\", is equivalent\nto general relativity but differs in an important respect: shape dynamics is a\ntheory of dynamic conformal 3-geometry, not a theory of spacetime. Equivalence\nis achieved by trading foliation invariance for local conformal invariance (up\nto a global scale). After the trading, what is left is a gauge theory invariant\nunder 3d diffeomorphisms and conformal transformations that preserve the volume\nof space. The local canonical constraints are linear and the constraint algebra\ncloses with structure constants. Shape dynamics, thus, provides a novel new\nstarting point for quantum gravity.\n  The procedure for the trading of symmetries was inspired by a technique\ncalled \"best matching\". We explain best matching and its relation to Mach's\nprinciples. The key features of best matching are illustrated through finite\ndimensional toy models. A general picture is then established where relational\ntheories are treated as gauge theories on configuration space. Shape dynamics\nis then constructed by applying best matching to conformal geometry. We then\nstudy shape dynamics in more detail by computing its Hamiltonian and\nHamilton-Jacobi functional perturbatively.\n  This thesis is intended as a pedagogical but complete introduction to shape\ndynamics and the Machian ideas that led to its discovery. The reader is\nencouraged to start with the introduction, which gives a conceptual outline and\nlinks to the relevant sections in the text for a more rigorous exposition.

The\ngenie-aided system is used to decompose the tradeoffs in the original system\ninto multiple tiers, which are examined progressively. Numerical examples\nindicate that the optimal scheduler in the original system, with observation on\nthe scheduled channel only, achieves a performance very close to the\ngenie-aided system.
