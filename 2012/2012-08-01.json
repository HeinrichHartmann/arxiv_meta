To understand and model the evolution of HIV quantitatively,\nthe parameters governing genetic diversification and the strength of selection\nneed to be known. While mutation rates can be measured in single replication\ncycles, the relevant effective recombination rate depends on the probability of\ncoinfection of a cell with more than one virus and can only be inferred from\npopulation data. However, most population genetic estimators for recombination\nrates assume absence of selection and are hence of limited applicability to\nHIV, since positive and purifying selection are important in HIV evolution.\nHere, we estimate the rate of recombination and the distribution of selection\ncoefficients from time-resolved sequence data tracking the evolution of HIV\nwithin single patients.

Furthermore, we provide\nevidence that selection coefficients of at least 15% of the observed\nnon-synonymous polymorphisms exceed 0.8% per generation. These results provide\na basis for a more detailed understanding of the evolution of HIV.

Here, we exploit\nradio-frequency spectroscopy to measure the complete excitation spectrum of\nfermionic 40K impurities resonantly interacting with a Fermi sea of 6Li atoms.\nIn particular, we show that a well-defined quasiparticle exists for strongly\nrepulsive interactions. For this \"repulsive polaron\" we measure its energy and\nits lifetime against decay. We also probe its coherence properties by measuring\nthe quasiparticle residue. The results are well described by a theoretical\napproach that takes into account the finite effective range of the interaction\nin our system.

For massive primaries the luminosity and stellar\nmass functions of satellites are similar in shape to those of field galaxies,\nbut for lower mass primaries they are significantly steeper. The steepening is\nparticularly marked for the stellar mass function. Satellite abundance\nincreases strongly with primary stellar mass, approximately in proportion to\nexpected dark halo mass. Massive red primaries have up to a factor of 2 more\nsatellites than blue ones of the same stellar mass. Satellite galaxies are\nsystematically redder than field galaxies of the same stellar mass.

It is\nshown that there is a similarity between electrostatics in the presence of a\nminimal length (modified electrostatics) and higher derivative Podolsky's\nelectrostatics. The important property of this modified electrostatics is that\nthe classical self-energy of a point charge becomes a finite value. Two\ndifferent upper bounds on the isotropic minimal length of this modified\nelectrostatics are estimated. The first upper bound will be found by treating\nthe modified electrostatics as a classical electromagnetic system, while the\nsecond one will be estimated by considering the modified electrostatics as a\nquantum field theoretic model.

As a result, while still preserving structured aliasing, the\nmodulated sampling scheme is also useful in a compressive sensing (CS) setting.\nWe estimate restricted isometry property (RIP) constants for CS matrices\ninduced by such modulated sampling schemes and use those estimates to determine\nthe amount of sparsity needed for signal recovery. This is followed by a\ndemonstration and analysis of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit's ability to\nreconstruct signals from noisy non-uniform samples.\n"]}]

This configuration allows\nfor both shear and normal forces on the microspheres in contact with the ridge.\nThe heaps, which form against the ridge, are characterized by two distinct\nphases: a solid-like bulk phase in the interior, and a highly-fluctuating,\nliquid-like state which exists along its leading edge. We observe that heaps\nonly form above a critical flow velocity, (v_c), and that they are destroyed by\nthermal rearrangements when the flow ceases. We monitor the dynamics of heap\nformation using fluorescence video microscopy, measuring the heap volume and\nthe angle of repose in response to microsphere deposition and erosion\nprocesses. We find that the steady-state angle of repose, (\\theta_f), increases\nas a function of inflow velocity, (v_\\infty), with a functional form (\\theta_f\n\\propto \\sqrt{v_\\infty - v_c}).\n"]}]
