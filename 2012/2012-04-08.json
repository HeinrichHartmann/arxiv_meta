The first allowable type of transformation holds\nif and only if the Clock Hypothesis is true. If the Clock Hypothesis is not\ntrue, the transformation is of Lorentz-type and implies the existence of a\nuniversal maximal acceleration $a_m$.\n  We present an extension of relativistic dynamics for which all admissible\nsolutions will have have a speed bounded by the speed of light $c$ and the\nacceleration bounded by $a_m$. An additional Doppler type shift for an\naccelerated source is predicted. The formulas for such shift are the same as\nfor the usual Doppler shift with $v/c$ replaced by $a/a_m$.\n  The W. K\\\"{u}ndig experiment of measurement of the transverse Doppler shift\nin an accelerated system was also exposed to a longtitudal shift due to the\nacceleration. This experiment, as reanalyzed by Kholmetskii et al, shows that\nthe Clock Hypothesis is not valid. Based on the results of this experiment, we\npredict that the value of the maximal acceleration $a_m$ is of the order\n$10^{19}m/s^2$. Moreover, our analysis provides a way to measure experimentally\nthe maximal acceleration with existing technology.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 1 figure"]}]
