We confirm both the growth rates\nand eigenfunctions found in the linearized analysis and hence the instability.\nIn the non-linear regime, after the unstable modes grow to the background\nlevel, the naturally selected modes become stable and oscillatory. Later on,\nthe evolution tends to select the modes with the longest possible wavelengths,\nbut this process occurs on the magnetic diffusion timescale. We confirm the\nexistence of the Hall instability. We argue against using the misleading\nterminology that associates the non-linear Hall term with a turbulent Hall\ncascade, since small-scale structures are not created everywhere.

AGNs are characterized by an extremely bright and compact emission\nregion, powered by a super-massive black hole (SMBH) and an accretion disk, and\nrelativistic outflows (jets) detected all across the electro-magnetic spectrum.\nIn BL Lac sources the jet axis is oriented close to the line of sight, giving\nrise to a relativistic boosting of the emission. In radio galaxies, on the\nother hand, the jet makes a larger angle to the line of sight allowing to\nresolve the central core and the jet in great details. The giant radio galaxy M\n87 with its proximity (1 6Mpc) and its very massive black hole ((3-6) x 10^9\nM_solar) provides a unique laboratory to investigate VHE emission in such\nobjects and thereby probe particle acceleration to relativistic energies near\nSMBH and in jets. M 87 has been established as a VHE emitter since 2005. The\nVHE emission displays strong variability on time-scales as short as a day. It\nhas been subject of a large joint VHE and multi-wavelength (MWL) monitoring\ncampaign in 2008, where a rise in the 43 GHz VLBA radio emission of the\ninnermost region (core) was found to coincide with a flaring activity at VHE.\nThis had been interpreted as a strong indication that the VHE emission is\nproduced in the direct vicinity of the SMBH black hole. In 2010 again a flare\nat VHE was detected triggering further MWL observations with the VLBA, Chandra,\nand other instruments. At the same time M 87 was also observed with the\nFermi-LAT telescope at GeV energies and the European VLBI Network (EVN). In\nthis contribution preliminary results from the campaign will be presented.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 2 figures, in the proceedings of the \"International Workshop\n  on Beamed and Unbeamed Gamma-Rays from Galaxies\" 11-15 April 2011, Lapland\n  Hotel Olos, Muonio, Finland, Journal of Physics: Conference Series Volume\n  355, 2012"]}]

We show that a conjectured single-letter key-rate\nformula is false, uncovering a deep ignorance about asymptotically good private\ncodes and pointing towards unfortunate complications in the theory of QKD.\nThese complications are not without benefit--with added complexity comes better\nkey rates than previously thought possible. We improve the threshold for secure\nkey generation from a bit error rate of 0.124 to 0.129.\n","Comment: Final version. Title changed"]}]
