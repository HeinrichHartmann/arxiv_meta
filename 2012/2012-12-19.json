Under certain\nassumptions, an observable signature of dark matter is the annual modulation of\nthe rate of dark matter-nucleon interactions taking place in an Earth-bound\nexperiment. To search for this effect, we introduce the concept for a new dark\nmatter experiment using NaI scintillation detectors deployed deep in the South\nPole ice. This experiment complements dark matter search efforts in the\nNorthern Hemisphere and will investigate the observed annual modulation in the\nDAMA/LIBRA and DAMA/NaI experiments. The unique location will permit the study\nof background effects correlated with seasonal variations and the surrounding\nenvironment.

We suggest that a\nsimple liquid should be defined instead by the property of having strong\ncorrelation between virial and potential energy equilibrium fluctuations in the\nNVT ensemble. There is considerable overlap between the two definitions, but\nalso some notable differences. For instance, in the new definition simplicity\nis not a property of the intermolecular potential only because a liquid is\nusually only strongly correlating in part of its phase diagram. Moreover,\naccording to the new definition not all simple liquids are atomic (i.e., with\nradially symmetric pair potentials) and not all atomic liquids are simple. The\nmain part of the paper motivates the new definition of liquid simplicity by\npresenting evidence that a liquid is strongly correlating if and only if its\nintermolecular interactions may be ignored beyond the first coordination shell\n(FCS). This is demonstrated by NVT simulations of structure and dynamics of 15\natomic and molecular model liquids with a shifted-forces cutoff placed at the\nfirst minimum of the radial distribution function. No proof is given that the\nchemical characterization follows from the strong correlation property, but it\nis shown to be consistent with the existence of isomorphs in strongly\ncorrelating liquids' phase diagram. Finally, we note that the FCS\ncharacterization of simple liquids calls into question the basis for standard\nperturbation theory, according to which the repulsive and attractive forces\nplay fundamentally different roles for the physics of liquids.\n"]}]

As such, verifying the integrity of Internet-based searches over\nvast amounts of web contents is essential.\n  We provide the first solution to this general security problem. We introduce\nthe concept of an authenticated web crawler and present the design and\nprototype implementation of this new concept. An authenticated web crawler is a\ntrusted program that computes a special \"signature\" $s$ of a collection of web\ncontents it visits. Subject to this signature, web searches can be verified to\nbe correct with respect to the integrity of their produced results. This\nsignature also allows the verification of complicated queries on web pages,\nsuch as conjunctive keyword searches. In our solution, along with the web pages\nthat satisfy any given search query, the search engine also returns a\ncryptographic proof. This proof, together with the signature $s$, enables any\nuser to efficiently verify that no legitimate web pages are omitted from the\nresult computed by the search engine, and that no pages that are non-conforming\nwith the query are included in the result. An important property of our\nsolution is that the proof size and the verification time both depend solely on\nthe sizes of the query description and the query result, but not on the number\nor sizes of the web pages over which the search is performed.\n  Our authentication protocols are based on standard Merkle trees and the more\ninvolved bilinear-map accumulators.

For slowly rotating black\nholes, the QNM real frequency is a linear combination of a the orbit's\nprecessional and orbital frequencies, but the correspondence is otherwise\nunchanged. In this paper, we find a relationship between the QNM frequencies of\nKerr black holes of arbitrary (astrophysical) spins and general spherical\nphoton orbits, which is analogous to the relationship for slowly rotating\nholes. To derive this result, we first use the WKB approximation to compute\naccurate algebraic expressions for large-l QNM frequencies. Comparing our WKB\ncalculation to the leading-order, geometric-optics approximation to scalar-wave\npropagation in the Kerr spacetime, we then draw a correspondence between the\nreal parts of the parameters of a QNM and the conserved quantities of spherical\nphoton orbits. At next-to-leading order in this comparison, we relate the\nimaginary parts of the QNM parameters to coefficients that modify the amplitude\nof the scalar wave. With this correspondence, we find a geometric\ninterpretation to two features of the QNM spectrum of Kerr black holes: First,\nfor Kerr holes rotating near the maximal rate, a large number of modes have\nnearly zero damping; we connect this characteristic to the fact that a large\nnumber of spherical photon orbits approach the horizon in this limit. Second,\nfor black holes of any spins, the frequencies of specific sets of modes are\ndegenerate; we find that this feature arises when the spherical photon orbits\ncorresponding to these modes form closed (as opposed to ergodically winding)\ncurves.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 16 figures"]}]

Combined, the peak contribution from these cool evolved\nstars occurs at ~3-4 um, where they produce 32% of the SMC light, and 25% of\nthe LMC flux. The TP-AGB star contribution also peaks at ~3-4 um and amounts to\n21% in both galaxies. The contribution from RSG stars peaks at shorter\nwavelengths, 2.2 um, where they provide 11% of the SMC flux, and 7% for the\nLMC. Both TP-AGB and RSG stars are short lived, and thus potentially impose a\nlarge stochastic scatter on the near-IR derived mass-to-light ratios of\ngalaxies at rest-frame 1-4 um. To minimize their impact on stellar mass\nestimates, one can use the M/L ratio at shorter wavelengths (e.g. at 0.8 - 1\num). At longer wavelengths (>=8 um), emission from dust in the interstellar\nmedium dominates the flux. In the LMC, which shows strong PAH emission at 8 um,\nTP-AGB and RSG contribute less than 4% of the 8 um flux. However, 19% of the\nSMC 8 um flux is from evolved stars, nearly half of which is produced by the\nrarest, dustiest, carbon-rich TP-AGB stars. Thus, star formation rates of\ngalaxies, based on an 8 um flux (e.g. observed-frame 24 um at z=2), may be\nbiased modestly high, especially for galaxies with little PAH emission.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

This dynamical process involves an additional\nself-interaction of the dynamical 3-space, and experimental data reveals that\nits strength is set by the fine structure constant, implying a fundamental link\nbetween gravity and quantum theory. The dynamical 3-space has been directly\ndetected in numerous light-speed anisotropy experiments. Quantum matter has\nbeen shown to exhibit an acceleration caused by the time-dependence and\ninhomogeneity of the 3-space flow, giving the first derivation of gravity from\na deeper theory, as a quantum wave refraction effect. EM radiation is also\nrefracted in a similar manner. The anisotropy experiments have all shown\n3-space wave/turbulence effects, with the latest revealing the fractal\nstructure of 3-space. Here we report the prediction of a new effect, namely a\nreverberation effect, when the gravitational waves propagate in the 3-space\ninflow of a large mass. This effect arises from the non-linear dynamics of\n3-space. These reverberations could offer an explanation for the Shnoll effect,\nin which cosmological factors influence stochastic processes, such as\nradioactive decay rates.\n","Comment: 3 pages, 2 figures"]}]
