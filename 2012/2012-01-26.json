Our analysis is motivated\nby the Laplace-Bernstein-Von Mises central limit theorem, which states that in\nlarge samples the posterior or quasi-posterior approaches a normal density.\nUsing the conditions required for the central limit theorem to hold, we\nestablish polynomial bounds on the computational complexity of general\nMetropolis random walks methods in large samples. Our analysis covers cases\nwhere the underlying log-likelihood or extremum criterion function is possibly\nnon-concave, discontinuous, and with increasing parameter dimension. However,\nthe central limit theorem restricts the deviations from continuity and\nlog-concavity of the log-likelihood or extremum criterion function in a very\nspecific manner.\n  Under minimal assumptions required for the central limit theorem to hold\nunder the increasing parameter dimension, we show that the Metropolis algorithm\nis theoretically efficient even for the canonical Gaussian walk which is\nstudied in detail. Specifically, we show that the running time of the algorithm\nin large samples is bounded in probability by a polynomial in the parameter\ndimension $d$, and, in particular, is of stochastic order $d^2$ in the leading\ncases after the burn-in period.

We calculate generically\noriented stellar orbits in the Kerr metric, and evaluate the relativistic tidal\ntensor at pericenter for those stars not directly captured by the black hole.\nWe combine this relativistic analysis with previous calculations of how these\norbits are populated to determine tidal-disruption rates for spinning black\nholes. We find, consistent with previous results, that black-hole spin\nincreases the upper limit on the mass of a black hole capable of tidally\ndisrupting solar-like stars to ~7 x 10^8 solar masses. More quantitatively, we\nfind that direct stellar capture reduces tidal-disruption rates by a factor 2/3\n(1/10) at M = 10^7 (10^8) solar masses. The strong dependence of\ntidal-disruption rates on black-hole spin for M > 10^8 solar masses implies\nthat future surveys like LSST that discover thousands of tidal disruption\nevents can constrain supermassive black-hole spin demographics.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 4 figures, minor changes, final published version"]}]

However, current parametrized mass models can often only reproduce\nthe observed positions to within one or a few arcsec which is worse than the\npositional measurement uncertainty. One suggested explanation for this\ndiscrepancy is the additional perturbations of the path of the light ray caused\nby matter density fluctuations along the line of sight.

Since the light rays of neighbouring images pass through much\nthe same density fluctuations, it turns out that the images' expected\ndeflection angles can be highly correlated. This implies that line-of-sight\ndensity fluctuations are a significant and possibly dominant systematic for\nstrong lensing mass modeling and set a lower limit to how well a cluster mass\nmodel can be expected to replicate the observed image positions.

However, this detection statistic is susceptible to a\nclass of noise artifacts, strong monochromatic lines in a single detector. By\nassuming an extended noise model - standard Gaussian noise plus single-detector\nlines - we can use a Bayesian odds ratio to derive a generalized detection\nstatistic, the line veto (LV-) statistic. In the absence of lines, it behaves\nsimilarly to the F-statistic, but it is more robust against line artifacts. In\nthe past, ad-hoc post-processing vetoes have been implemented in searches to\nremove these artifacts. Here we provide a systematic framework to develop and\nbenchmark this class of vetoes. We present our results from testing this\nLV-statistic on simulated data.\n","Comment: 2 pages, 1 figure, to be published in Proceedings of Statistical\n  Challenges in Modern Astronomy V, Springer 2012"]}]

The technique is based on the transference theorems\ngiven by Banaszczyk which imply some necessary conditions on the coefficients\nof the closest vectors with respect to a basis whose dual is HKZ reduced.\nRecursively, starting with the last coefficient, intervals of length i can be\nderived for the i-th coefficient of any closest vector. This leads to n!\ncandidates for closest vectors. In this paper we refine the necessary\nconditions derived from the transference theorems, giving an exponential\nreduction of the number of candidates. The improvement is due to the fact that\nthe lengths of the intervals are not independent. In the original algorithm the\ncandidates for a coefficient pair (a_i,a_{i+1}) correspond to the integer\npoints in a rectangle of volume i(i+1). In our analysis we show that the\ncandidates for (a_i,a_{i+1}) in fact lie in an ellipse with transverse and\nconjugate diameter i+1, respectively i. This reduces the overall number of\npoints to be enumerated by an exponential factor of about 0.886^n.

It suggests\na double-slit interferometry experiment with atoms of noble gases in which it\nmay be possible to detect an individual atom as a probability wave, using a\ndetector which can execute two different types of simple harmonic motion: as a\nsimple pendulum, and as a torsion pendulum. In the experiment, a torsional\noscillation will never be induced by the impact of a probability wave, but will\nalways be induced by the impact of a particle. Detection as a wave is\ncontingent on the atom interacting much more strongly with the macroscopic\ndetector as a whole than with its microscopic constituents.

The wave penetration (with\na typical wavelength of the order of 10 km) of the generated ELF currents and\nfields into the deeper ionospheric layers up to 120 km takes place due to the\ndominance of the Hall conductivity over the Pederson conductivity in the region\nbetween 90-120 km and penetration becomes diffusive above 120 km.
