Further, we obtain the density profile of dark\nmatter in galaxies. Comparison of our analytical results shows that our\ntorsion-based toy model for dark matter is in good agreement with empirical\ndata-based models. It shows that we can address the dark matter as an effect of\ntorsion of the space.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 3 figures"]}]
