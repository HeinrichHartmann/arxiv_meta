Assume that $B$ is a right $A$-module algebra and\nthat $A$ is a left $B$-comodule coalgebra. If the action and coaction are\nmatched, it is possible to define a coproduct $\\Delta_#$ on the smash product\n$A # B$ making the pair $(A # B,\\Delta_#)$ into an algebraic quantum group. In\nthis paper, we continue the study of these objects. First, we study the various\ndata of the bicrossproduct $A # B$, such as the modular automorphisms, the\nmodular elements, ... and obtain formulas in terms of the data of the\ncomponents $A$ and $B$. Secondly, we look at the dual of $A # B$ (in the sense\nof algebraic quantum groups) and we show it is itself a bicrossproduct (of the\nsecond type) of the duals $\\hatA$ and $\\hatB$. The result is immediate for\nfinite-dimensional Hopf algebras and therefore it is expected also for\nalgebraic quantum groups. However, it turns out that some aspects involve a\ncareful argument, mainly due to the fact that coproducts and coactions have\nranges in the multiplier algebras of the tensor products and not in the tensor\nproduct itself. Finally, we also treat some examples in this paper. We have\nincluded some of the examples that are known for finite-dimensional Hopf\nalgebras and show how they can also be obtained for more general algebraic\nquantum groups. We also give some examples that are more typical for algebraic\nquantum groups. In particular, we focus on the extra structure, provided by the\nintegrals and associated objects. It should be mentioned that with examples of\nbicrossproducts of algebraic quantum groups, we do get examples that are\nessentially different from those commonly known in Hopf algebra theory.\n"]}]

A notable example\nis digital television. Basically, coding theory is to study a way of detecting\nand/or correcting data that may be true or false. Moreover coding theory is an\narea of mathematics, in which there is an interplay between many branches of\nmathematics, e.g., abstract algebra, combinatorics, discrete geometry,\ninformation theory, etc. In this paper we propose a novel approach for\nanalyzing proof nets of Multiplicative Linear Logic (MLL) by coding theory. We\ndefine families of proof structures and introduce a metric space for each\nfamily. In each family, 1. an MLL proof net is a true code element; 2. a proof\nstructure that is not an MLL proof net is a false (or corrupted) code element.\nThe definition of our metrics reflects the duality of the multiplicative\nconnectives elegantly. In this paper we show that in the framework one\nerror-detecting is possible but one error-correcting not. Our proof of the\nimpossibility of one error-correcting is interesting in the sense that a proof\ntheoretical property is proved using a graph theoretical argument. In addition,\nwe show that affine logic and MLL + MIX are not appropriate for this framework.\nThat explains why MLL is better than such similar logics.\n","Comment: minor modifications"]}]

In the Littlest Higgs model with T parity, the LTP is\ntypically the T-odd heavy photon, which is weakly interacting and can play the\nrole of dark matter. We analyze the relic abundance of the heavy photon,\nincluding its coannihilations with other T-odd particles, and map out the\nregions of the parameter space where it can account for the observed dark\nmatter. We evaluate the prospects for direct and indirect discovery of the\nheavy photon dark matter. The direct detection rates are quite low and a\nsubstantial improvement in experimental sensitivity would be required for\nobservation. A substantial flux of energetic gamma rays is produced in the\nannihilation of the heavy photons in the galactic halo. This flux can be\nobserved by the GLAST telescope, and, if the distribution of dark matter in the\nhalo is favorable, by ground-based telescope arrays such as VERITAS and HESS.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 9 figures. v3: a typo in Eq.

This is equivalent\nto the notion of kernels of digraphs, which appears in numerous fields of\nresearch such as game theory, complexity theory, artificial intelligence\n(default logic, argumentation in multi-agent systems), 0-1 laws in monadic\nsecond order logic, combinatorics (perfect graphs)... Kernels of digraphs lead\nto numerous difficult questions (in the sense of NP-completeness,\n#P-completeness). However, we show here that it is possible to use a generating\nfunction approach to get new informations: we use technique of symbolic and\nanalytic combinatorics (generating functions and their singularities) in order\nto get exact and asymptotic results, e.g. for the existence of a kernel in a\ncircuit or in a unicircuit digraph. This is a first step toward a\ngeneratingfunctionology treatment of kernels, while using, e.g., an approach \"a\nla Wright\". Our method could be applied to more general \"local coloring\nconstraints\" in decomposable combinatorial structures.\n","Comment: Presented (as a poster) to the conference Formal Power Series and\n  Algebraic Combinatorics (Vancouver, 2004), electronic proceedings"]}]
