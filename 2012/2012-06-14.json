In particular, for topological superconductors (or\nsuperfluids) with time-reversal symmetry which lack SU(2) spin rotation\nsymmetry (e.g. due to spin-orbit interactions), such as the B phase of $^3$He,\nthe thermal response is the only probe which can detect the non-trivial\ntopological character through transport. We show that, for such topological\nsuperconductors, applying a temperature gradient produces a thermal- (or mass-)\nsurface current perpendicular to the thermal gradient. Such charge, thermal, or\nmagnetic dipole responses provide a definition of topological insulators and\nsuperconductors beyond the single-particle picture. Moreover we find, for a\nsignificant part of the 'ten-fold' list of topological insulators found in\nprevious work in the absence of interactions, that in general dimensions the\neffective field theory describing the space-time responses is governed by a\nfield theory anomaly. Since anomalies are known to be insensitive to whether\nthe underlying fermions are interacting or not, this shows that the\nclassification of these topological insulators is robust to adiabatic\ndeformations by interparticle interactions in general dimensionality.

Our goal is to design\nscheduling schemes that do not use per-flow or per-destination information,\nmaintain a single data queue for each link, and exploit only local information,\nwhile guaranteeing throughput optimality. Although the celebrated back-pressure\nalgorithm maximizes throughput, it requires per-flow or per-destination\ninformation. It is usually difficult to obtain and maintain this type of\ninformation, especially in large networks, where there are numerous flows.\nAlso, the back-pressure algorithm maintains a complex data structure at each\nnode, keeps exchanging queue length information among neighboring nodes, and\ncommonly results in poor delay performance.

These schemes use either the readily available hop-count\ninformation or only the local information for each link. We rigorously analyze\nthe performance of the proposed schemes using fluid limit techniques via an\ninductive argument and show that they are throughput-optimal.

Based on this, we derive the distribution and moment\ngenerating function (MGF) of the ICI considering a single interfering cell.\nConsequently, we determine the MGF of the cumulative ICI observed from all\ninterfering cells and derive explicit MGF expressions for three typical fading\nmodels. Finally, we utilize the obtained expressions to evaluate important\nnetwork performance metrics such as the outage probability, ergodic capacity\nand average fairness numerically.

This problem becomes even more difficult due to\ncomplications in modeling unknown interaction terms among high dimensional\nvariables. There is currently no variable selection method to overcome these\nlimitations. Hence, in this paper we propose a variable selection approach that\nis developed by connecting a kernel machine with the nonparametric multiple\nregression model. The advantages of our approach are that it can: (1) recover\nthe sparsity, (2) automatically model unknown and complicated interactions, (3)\nconnect with several existing approaches including linear nonnegative garrote,\nkernel learning and automatic relevant determinants (ARD), and (4) provide\nflexibility for both additive and nonadditive nonparametric models. Our\napproach may be viewed as a nonlinear version of a nonnegative garrote method.\nWe model the smoothing function by a least squares kernel machine and construct\nthe nonnegative garrote objective function as the function of the similarity\nmatrix. Since the multiple regression similarity matrix can be written as an\nadditive form of univariate similarity matrices corresponding to input\nvariables, applying a sparse scale parameter on each univariate similarity\nmatrix can reveal its relevance to the response variable. We also derive the\nasymptotic properties of our approach, and show that it provides a square root\nconsistent estimator of the scale parameters. Furthermore, we prove that\nsparsistency is satisfied with consistent initial kernel function coefficients\nunder certain conditions and give the necessary and sufficient conditions for\nsparsistency.

The reasons behind the\nsuccess of this reduced model are investigated. Monte Carlo simulations are\nperformed investigating the role of flexibility of the side chains in the\nselectivity of calcium channels under a wide range of ionic conditions. Results\nsuggest that the exact location and mobility of oxygen ions have little effect\non the selectivity behavior of calcium channels. The first order determinant of\nselectivity in calcium channels is the density of charge in the selectivity\nfilter. Flexibility seems a second order determinant.
