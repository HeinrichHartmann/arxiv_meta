The nonlinear memory corrections presented here complete our knowledge of\nthe leading-order (Peters-Mathews) waveforms for elliptical orbits.

The case of\nsliding instabilities is more problematic. This phenomenon occurs on temperate\nglacier tongues. Such instabilities are strongly affected by the subglacial\nhydrology: melt water may cause (i) a lubrication of the bed and (ii) a\ndecrease of the effective pressure and consequently a decrease of basal\nfriction.

Within the classical sampling framework, state of the art systems\nreduce processing rates by exploiting the bandpass bandwidth of the detected\nsignals. It has been recently shown, that a much more significant sample-rate\nreduction may be obtained, by treating ultrasound signals within the Finite\nRate of Innovation framework. These ideas follow the spirit of Xampling, which\ncombines classic methods from sampling theory with recent developments in\nCompressed Sensing. Applying such low-rate sampling schemes to individual\ntransducer elements, which detect energy reflected from biological tissues, is\nlimited by the noisy nature of the signals. This often results in erroneous\nparameter extraction, bringing forward the need to enhance the SNR of the\nlow-rate samples. In our work, we manage to achieve such SNR enhancement, by\nbeamforming the sub-Nyquist samples obtained from multiple elements. We refer\nto this process as \"compressed beamforming\". Applying it to cardiac ultrasound\ndata, we successfully image macroscopic perturbations, while achieving a nearly\neight-fold reduction in sample-rate, compared to standard techniques.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures"]}]

The predicted spread in redshift, caused by large-scale fluctuations\nin the number density of galaxies, is at least an order of magnitude larger\nthan previous expectations that argued for a sharp end to reionization. This\ncosmic scatter in the abundance of galaxies introduces new features that affect\nthe nature of reionization and the expectations for future probes of\nreionization, and may help explain the present properties of dwarf galaxies in\ndifferent environments. The predictions can be tested by future numerical\nsimulations and may be verified by upcoming observations. Current simulations,\nlimited to relatively small volumes and periodic boundary conditions, largely\nomit cosmic scatter and its consequences. In particular, they artificially\nproduce a sudden end to reionization, and they underestimate the number of\ngalaxies by up to an order of magnitude at redshift 20.\n","Comment: 8 ApJ pages, 4 figures, ApJ.

We propose\nto attack a very similar problem, which 80 years later remains open, about the\ntopology of the space of closed curves on S^2 which are locally convex (i.e.,\nwithout inflection points). One of the main difficulties is the absence of the\ncovering homotopy principle for the map sending a non-closed locally convex\ncurve to the Frenet frame at its endpoint.\n  In the present paper we study the spaces of locally convex curves in S^n with\na given initial and final Frenet frames. Using combinatorics of B^{+}_{n+1} =\nB_{n+1} \\cap SO_{n+1}, where B_{n+1} \\subset O_{n+1} is the usual Coxeter-Weyl\ngroup, we show that for any n \\ge 2 these spaces fall in at most\n$\\lceil\\frac{n}{2}\\rceil+1$ equivalence classes up to homeomorphism. We also\nstudy this classification in the double cover Spin(n+1).\n  For $n = 2$ our results complete the classification of the corresponding\nspaces into two topologically distinct classes, or three classes in the spin\ncase.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 4 figures; full rewrite of previous version"]}]
