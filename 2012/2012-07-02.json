Unlike previous model based methods in FMDPs,\nit incrementally learns the structure and the parameters of a RL problem using\nsupervised learning techniques. Then, it integrates decision-theoric planning\nalgorithms based on FMDPs to compute its policy. SPITI is an instanciation of\nSDYNA that exploits ITI, an incremental decision tree algorithm, to learn the\nreward function and the Dynamic Bayesian Networks with local structures\nrepresenting the transition function of the problem. These representations are\nused by an incremental version of the Structured Value Iteration algorithm. In\norder to learn the structure, SPITI uses Chi-Square tests to detect the\nindependence between two probability distributions. Thus, we study the relation\nbetween the threshold used in the Chi-Square test, the size of the model built\nand the relative error of the value function of the induced policy with respect\nto the optimal value. We show that, on stochastic problems, one can tune the\nthreshold so as to generate both a compact model and an efficient policy. Then,\nwe show that SPITI, while keeping its model compact, uses the generalization\nproperty of its learning method to perform better than a stochastic classical\ntabular algorithm in large RL problem with an unknown structure.

In this work,\nwe treat the case of general space dimension. We obtain basic existence results\nfor minimizers with sufficiently small masses. For certain ranges of the\nexponent in the kernel we also obtain non-existence results for sufficiently\nlarge masses, as well as a characterization of minimizers as balls for\nsufficiently small masses and low spatial dimensionality. The physically\nimportant special case of three space dimensions and Coulombic repulsion is\nincluded in all the results mentioned above. In particular, our work yields a\nnegative answer to the question if stable atomic nuclei at arbitrarily high\natomic numbers can exist in the framework of the classical liquid drop model of\nnuclear matter. In all cases the minimal energy scales linearly with mass for\nlarge masses, even if the infimum of energy may not be attained.\n"]}]

A self-consistent calculation of the structure and the\nemerging spectrum of geometrically thin alpha-accretion disks in AGN is\npresented. The central object is assumed to be a Kerr black hole; full\nrelativistic corrections are included. The local dissipation of gravitational\nenergy is assumed to be entirely due to turbulence. Since these disks are\nmainly supported by radiation pressure, the assumption that the viscous energy\nproduction is proportional to the total pressure leads to diverging temperature\nstructures in the upper parts of the disk, where the total optical depths is\nsmall. We therefore modify the standard expression for the turbulent viscosity\nby taking into account the radiative energy loss of turbulent elements in an\noptically thin regime. Compton scattering is treated in the Fokker-Planck\napproximation using the Kompaneets oparator. The absorption cross section\ncontains only free-free processes for a pure hydrogen atmosphere. We present\nseveral calculations for various parameters such as the accretion rate, the\nviscosity parameter, the specific angular momentum of the black hole and the\ninclination angle of the observer. The resulting temperature and density\nprofiles show that the disks are optically thick for Compton scattering and\neffectively optically thin for most frequencies. This leads to spectra that are\ndiluted with respect to the photon number but contain a Comptonized high energy\ntail in order to carry the required energy flux. In addition the electron\ntemperature deviates strongly from the equilibrium temperature. Therefore, the\nmodel can in general account for the observed soft X--ray excess.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 11 postscript figures included"]}]
