We discuss\nprevious attempts to extract the WIMP mass, cross-section and speed\ndistribution from direct detection data and show that these lead to significant\nbiases in the reconstructed parameter values. We develop and test an\nalternative model-independent method based on parametrising the momentum\ndistribution of the WIMPs.

The method\ncan be applied to a single experiment to extract information about the\ndistribution function, as well as information on the degenerate WIMP mass and\ninteraction cross-section combined in a single parameter. This degeneracy can\nbe broken by including data from additional experiments, meaning that the WIMP\nmass and speed distribution can be recovered. We test the momentum\nparametrisation method using mock datasets from proposed ton-scale direct\ndetection experiments, showing that it exhibits improved coverage properties\nover previous methods, as well as significantly reduced bias.

The Sinister model requires a three additional families of\nleptons and quarks, but only the lightest of them Heavy U-quark and\nE-\"electron\" are stable. Final neutral Helium-like UUUEE state is an ideal\nevanescent dark-matter candidate. However it is reached by multi-body\ninteractions along a tail of more manifest secondary frozen blocks. They should\nbe now here polluting the surrounding matter. Moreover, in opposition to\neffective pair quark annihilations, there is no such an early or late\ntera-lepton pairs suppressions, because:a) electromagnetic interactions are\n\"weaker\" than nuclear ones and b) helium ion 4He++ is able to attract and\ncapture, E-, fixing it into a hybrid tera helium \"ion\" trap. This leads to a\npile up of relic (4HeE)+ traces, a lethal compound for any Sinister Universe.\nThis capture leaves no Tera-Lepton frozen in Ep relic (otherwise an ideal\ncatalyzer to achieve effective late E+E- annihilations possibly saving the\nmodel). The (4HeE)+ Coulomb screening is also avoiding the synthesis of the\ndesired UUUEE hidden dark matter gas. The e(4HeE)+ behave chemically like an\nanomalous hydrogen isotope.Also tera-positronium (eE+) relics are over-abundant\nand they behave like an anomalous hydrogen atom: these gases do not fit by many\norders of magnitude known severe bounds on hydrogen anomalous isotope, making\ngrave shadows over a Sinister Universe. However a surprising and resolver role\nfor Tera-Pions in UHECR astrophysics has been revealed.\n","Comment: 15 pages"]}]
