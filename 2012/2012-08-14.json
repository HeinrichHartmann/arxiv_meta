For the quantum mechanical description,\nwe find conjugate momenta for the atomic scale symmetry modes. In direct space,\ngraphical rules for their commutation relations are obtained. Commutation\nrelations in the reciprocal space are also calculated. As an example, phonon\nmodes are analyzed in terms of symmetry modes.

We consider\nmetric cones with reducible holonomy over pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. First we\ndescribe the local structure of the base of the cone when the holonomy of the\ncone is decomposable. For instance, we find that the holonomy algebra of the\nbase is always the full pseudo-orthogonal Lie algebra. One of the global\nresults is that a cone over a compact and complete pseudo-Riemannian manifold\nis either flat or has indecomposable holonomy. Then we analyse the case when\nthe cone has indecomposable but reducible holonomy, which means that it admits\na parallel isotropic distribution. This analysis is carried out, first in the\ncase where the cone admits two complementary distributions and, second for\nLorentzian cones. We show that the first case occurs precisely when the local\ngeometry of the base manifold is para-Sasakian and that of the cone is\npara-K\\\"ahlerian. For Lorentzian cones we get a complete description of the\npossible (local) holonomy algebras in terms of the metric of the base manifold.\n","Comment: 47 pages, typos corrected, keywords and acknowledgements added"]}]

Unsupervised clustering and independent component\nanalysis (ICA) have been used to identify such spatio-temporal networks. While\nthese approaches have been useful for estimating these networks at the\nsubject-level, comparisons over groups or experimental conditions require\nfurther methodological development. In this paper, we tackle this problem by\nshowing how self-organizing maps (SOMs) can be compared within a Frechean\ninferential framework. Here, we summarize the mean SOM in each group as a\nFrechet mean with respect to a metric on the space of SOMs. We consider the use\nof different metrics, and introduce two extensions of the classical sum of\nminimum distance (SMD) between two SOMs, which take into account the\nspatio-temporal pattern of the fMRI data.

The high speed performance is observed after scaling, and\nthe retrieval of relevant web-resource in such a high speed is analyzed.\n","Comment: 14 Pages, 7 Figures This paper has been withdrawn by the author due\n  to a crucial sign error in page no. 3,4,7 and 11.

So the gluino radiative\ncorrection on the light stop mass plays the crucial role. Its large negative\ncorrection saves the GBF in the Minimal Supersymmetric SM (MSSM) and the next\nto the MSSM (NMSSM) constrained by the perturbativity. Moreover, a light stop\nis predicted: in the MSSM if we set the gluino mass M_3\\lesssim4 TeV, we have\nm_{\\wt t_1}<m_t; while in the NMSSM, imposing the least tuning condition we get\nm_{\\wt t_1}\\simeq130 GeV for M_3\\simeq1.5 TeV.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures"]}]
