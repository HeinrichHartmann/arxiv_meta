We\nconsider an extended Falicov-Kimball model in which itinerant spinless fermions\ninteract repulsively by U with localized particles whose distribution satisfies\na local constraint under geometrical frustration, the so-called ice rule. We\nnumerically calculate the density of states, optical conductivity, and inverse\nparticipation ratio for the models on the pyrochlore, checkerboard, and kagome\nlattices, and discuss the nature of metal-insulator transitions at commensurate\nfillings. As a result, we show that the ice-rule local constraint leads to\nseveral universal features in the electronic structure; a charge gap opens at a\nconsiderably small U compared to the bandwidth, and the energy spectrum\napproaches a characteristic form in the large U limit, that is, the\nnoninteracting tight-binding form in one dimension or the $\\delta$-functional\npeak. In the large U region, the itinerant fermions are confined in the\nmacroscopically-degenerate ice-rule configurations, which consist of a bunch of\none-dimensional loops: We call this insulating state the charge ice. On the\nother hand, transport properties are much affected by the geometry and\ndimensionality of lattices; e.g., the pyrochlore lattice model exhibits a\ntransition from a metallic to the charge-ice insulating state by increasing U,\nwhile the checkerboard lattice model appears to show Anderson localization\nbefore opening a gap.

As the response time of wind\nturbine is typically in the range of seconds, they are affected by the small\nscale intermittent properties of the turbulent wind. Consequently, basic\nfeatures which are known for small-scale homogeneous isotropic turbulence, and\nin particular the well-known intermittency problem, have an important impact on\nthe wind energy conversion process. We report on basic research results\nconcerning the small-scale intermittent properties of atmospheric flows and\ntheir impact on the wind energy conversion process. The analysis of wind data\nshows strongly intermittent statistics of wind fluctuations. To achieve\nnumerical modeling a data-driven superposition model is proposed. For the\nexperimental reproduction and adjustment of intermittent flows a so-called\nactive grid setup is presented. Its ability is shown to generate reproducible\nproperties of atmospheric flows on the smaller scales of the laboratory\nconditions of a wind tunnel. As an application example the response dynamics of\ndifferent anemometer types are tested. To achieve a proper understanding of the\nimpact of intermittent turbulent inflow properties on wind turbines we present\nmethods of numerical and stochastic modeling, and compare the results to\nmeasurement data. As a summarizing result we find that atmospheric turbulence\nimposes its intermittent features on the complete wind energy conversion\nprocess. Intermittent turbulence features are not only present in atmospheric\nwind, but are also dominant in the loads on the turbine, i.e. rotor torque and\nthrust, and in the electrical power output signal.

We focus on redshift\nmeasurement errors, on the reconstruction of the underlying real-space\nclustering and on the apparent degeneracy existing with the geometrical\ndistortions induced by the cosmology-dependent conversion of redshifts into\ndistances. We use a suite of mock catalogues extracted from large N-body\nsimulations, focusing on the analysis of intermediate, mildly non-linear scales\nand apply the standard linear dispersion model to fit the anisotropy of the\nobserved correlation function. We verify that redshift errors up to ~0.2% have\na negligible impact on the precision with which the specific growth rate beta\ncan be measured. Larger redshift errors introduce a positive systematic error,\nwhich can be alleviated by adopting a Gaussian distribution function of\npairwise velocities. This is, in any case, smaller than the systematic error of\nup to 10% due to the limitations of the linear dispersion model, which is\nstudied in a separate paper. We then show that 50% of the statistical error\nbudget on beta depends on the deprojection procedure through which the\nreal-space correlation function is obtained. Finally, we demonstrate that the\ndegeneracy with geometric distortions can in fact be circumvented. This is\nobtained through a modified version of the Alcock-Paczynski test in\nredshift-space, which successfully recovers the correct cosmology by searching\nfor the solution that optimizes the description of dynamical redshift\ndistortions. For a flat cosmology, we obtain largely independent, robust\nconstraints on beta and OmegaM. In a volume of 2.4(Gpc/h)^3, the correct OmegaM\nis obtained with ~12% error and negligible bias, once the real-space\ncorrelation function is properly reconstructed.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 12 figures.

As an expedient way for the reliable but massive GWA,\nQuasi-Particle-LDA (QPLDA) is proposed by several authors, where the total\ncomputational cost scales with N. Historically, Sham and Kohn introduced the\nidea of the local mass operator based on local wavenumber similar to WKB, but\ndid not execute actual numerical calculations. They took into account exchange\ninteraction only, from which we could not expect precise treatments anyway.\nLater, Pickett and Wang had proposed a more qualitative method and had shown\nits potentiality in examples of semiconductors, such as silicon, diamond and\nGaP. They used a model analytic formula for the dialectic function and adopted\na model energy dispersion, which is free-electron like one, except that, being\naccompanied with an artificial band-gap discontinuity. The latter method has\ntwo shortcomings. First, to execute the calculation, several parameters are\nneeded, such as the macroscopic dielectric constant and the band gap, which\nshould be evaluated by the calculation itself, rather than being prepared as\nparameters. Second, in their computation of the mass operator, two or three\ndimensional numerical integrations are needed on each point of the direct space\nmesh, which demand large computational costs in iterative procedures in\ndetermining local wavenumbers and quasi-particle energies. This may be the\nreason why QPLDA has not been widely used until now. The present work proposes\na qualitative way of QPLDA which does not need any experimental parameters,\nbeing much speedier than the formalism of Picket and Wang, and more precise\nthan that of Sham and Kohn. The computational method adopted by the present\nwork is a modification of the original proposal by Sham and Kohn, rather than\nthat of Picket and Wang.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 1 figure Version 2: Corrected typos"]}]

In contrast,\nsystematic errors like those induced by the convolution with the point spread\nfunction (PSF) will not benefit from that scaling effect and will require very\naccurate modeling and correction. While numerous methods have been devised to\ncarry out the PSF correction itself, modeling of the PSF shape and its spatial\nvariations across the instrument field of view has, so far, attracted much less\nattention. This step is nevertheless crucial because the PSF is only known at\nstar positions while the correction has to be performed at any position on the\nsky.

We propose here the first specification theory which\nallows to capture quantitative aspects during the refinement and implementation\nprocess, thus leveraging the problems of the qualitative setting.\n  Our proposed quantitative specification framework uses weighted modal\ntransition systems as a formal model of specifications. These are labeled\ntransition systems with the additional feature that they can model optional\nbehavior which may or may not be implemented by the system. Satisfaction and\nrefinement is lifted from the well-known qualitative to our quantitative\nsetting, by introducing a notion of distances between weighted modal transition\nsystems. We show that quantitative versions of parallel composition as well as\nquotient (the dual to parallel composition) inherit the properties from the\nBoolean setting.\n","Comment: Submitted to Formal Methods in System Design"]}]

Up to 1.1 kHz, our\nexperimental and numerical investigations confirm previous results showing that\nthe soundboard behaves like a homogeneous plate with isotropic properties and\nclamped boundary conditions. Therefore, according to the Skudrzyk mean-value\ntheorem (Skudrzyk 1980), only the mass of the structure M, the modal density\nn(f), and the mean loss factor eta(f), are needed to express the average\ndriving point mobility. Moreover, the expression of the envelope - resonances\nand antiresonances - of the mobility can be derived, according to (Langley\n1994). We measured the modal loss factor and the modal density of the\nsoundboard of an upright piano in playing condition, in an anechoic\nenvironment. The measurements could be done up to 2.5 kHz, with a novel\nhigh-resolution modal analysis technique (see the ICA companion-paper, Ege and\nBoutillon (2010)). Above 1.1 kHz, the change in the observed modal density\ntogether with numerical simulations confirm Berthaut's finding that the waves\nin the soundboard are confined between adjacent ribs (Berthaut et al. 2003).\nExtending the Skudrzyk and Langley approaches, we synthesize the mechanical\nmobility at the bridge up to 2.5 kHz. The validity of the computation for an\nextended spectral domain is discussed. It is also shown that the evolution of\nthe modal density with frequency is consistent with the rise of mobility (fall\nof impedance) in this frequency range and that both are due to the inter-rib\neffect appearing when the half-wavelength becomes equal to the rib spacing.\nResults match previous observations by Wogram (1980), Conklin (1996), Giordano\n(1998), Nakamura (1983) and could be used for numerical simulations for\nexample. This approach avoids the detailed description of the soundboard, based\non a very high number of parameters.

No comprehensive\napproach to form understanding exists, let alone one that produces rich models\nfor semantic services or integration with linked open data.\n  In this paper, we present OPAL, the first comprehensive approach to form\nunderstanding and integration. We identify form labeling and form\ninterpretation as the two main tasks involved in form understanding.

In\nextensive experiments on the ICQ and TEL-8 benchmarks and a set of 200 modern\nweb forms OPAL outperforms previous approaches for form labeling by a\nsignificant margin. For form interpretation, OPAL uses a schema (or ontology)\nof forms in a given domain. Thanks to this domain schema, it is able to produce\nnearly perfect (more than 97 percent accuracy in the evaluation domains) form\ninterpretations. Yet, the effort to produce a domain schema is very low, as we\nprovide a Datalog-based template language that eases the specification of such\nschemata and a methodology for deriving a domain schema largely automatically\nfrom an existing domain ontology.

Both, low recall and low precision in the annotations\nare mitigated to achieve almost human quality (more than 98 percent)\nmulti-attribute object extraction.\n  To achieve this accuracy, AMBER needs to be trained once for an entire\ndomain.

We show that\nthe exponent is of sixth or higher order in wave amplitude. As a result, the\ninhomogeneities do not form within typical time-scales of the natural\nenvironment. We conclude that turbulence of surface waves is weakly\ncompressible and alone it cannot be a realistic mechanism of the clustering of\nmatter on liquid surfaces.\n"]}]

We consider atomic transitions in a Lambda configuration where the\ncontrol field is a standing wave field. The probe field and the control field\nproduce coherence between the two ground states. We show that this coherence\nhas the same fringe pattern as produced by a Fabry-Perot interferometer and\nthus measurement of the atomic coherence would localize the atom.

For\nsome potentials the sum rules could lead to divergences. It is shown that when\nthis happens it is possible to examine the separate sum rules satisfied by the\neven and odd eigenstates of a symmetric confining potential and by subtraction\ncancel the divergences exactly and produce a new sum rule which is free of\ndivergences. The procedure is illustrated by considering symmetric power law\npotentials and the use of several examples. One of the examples considered\nshows that the zeros of the Airy function and its derivative obey a sum rule\nand this sum rule is verified. It is also shown how the procedure may be\ngeneralised to establish sum rules for arbitrary symmetric confining\npotentials.\n","Comment: 16 pages This paper is withdrawn to make some minor corrections"]}]
