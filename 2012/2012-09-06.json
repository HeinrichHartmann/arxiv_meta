Although the optimal read-once formula evaluation algorithm can be\napplied to any formula, it can be suboptimal if the inputs have large fanout.\nWe give an algorithm for evaluating any formula with n inputs, size S, and G\ngates using O(min{n, sqrt{S}, n^{1/2} G^{1/4}}) quantum queries. Furthermore,\nwe show that this algorithm is optimal, since for any n,S,G there exists a\nformula with n inputs, size at most S, and at most G gates that requires\nOmega(min{n, sqrt{S}, n^{1/2} G^{1/4}}) queries. We also show that the\nalgorithm remains nearly optimal for circuits of any particular depth k >= 3,\nand we give a linear-size circuit of depth 2 that requires Omega (n^{5/9})\nqueries. Applications of these results include a Omega (n^{19/18}) lower bound\nfor Boolean matrix product verification, a nearly tight characterization of the\nquantum query complexity of evaluating constant-depth circuits with bounded\nfanout, new formula gate count lower bounds for several functions including\nPARITY, and a construction of an AC^0 circuit of linear size that can only be\nevaluated by a formula with Omega(n^{2-epsilon}) gates.\n","Comment: 15 pages"]}]

Perhaps the oldest result in ergodic\ntheory is that of Poincar\\'e's Recurrence Principle which states: For any set\n$A \\in \\mathcal{F}$, the set of points $x$ of $A$ such that $T^nx$ is not in\nthe set $A$ for all $n > 0$ has zero measure. This says that almost every point\nof $A$ returns to $A$. In fact, almost every point of $A$ returns to $A$\ninfinitely often.\n  The return time for a given element $x \\in A$, $r_A(x) = \\inf\\{k \\geq 1: T^kx\n\\in A\\}$, is the first time that the element $x$ returns to the set $A$. By\nPoincar\\'e's Recurrence Principle there is set of full measure in $A$ such that\nall elements of this set have a finite return time. Our study of the Return\nTimes Theorem asks how we can further generalize this notion.\n  The paper begins by looking at early work with the concept of weighted\naverages. The second portion of the paper focuses on the historical development\nof the proofs of the Return Times Theorem. Three areas of extension of the\nReturn Times Theorem are then considered: a multiterm version, characteristic\nfactors and breaking the H\\\"olderian duality. The paper concludes with\ndiscussion of some more recent work and open questions to consider.\n","Comment: 44 pages, 1 figure, to be published by Walter de Gruyter on January\n  2013 in the Proceedings of the 2011 - 2012 Ergodic Theory Workshops"]}]

This discrepancy is often seen as a sign that basic formulas of\nstatistical mechanics should be revised, either on the basis of quantum\nmechanics or on the basis of general and fundamental considerations about the\n(in)distinguishability of particles. In this article we argue against this\nresponse. We show that both the extensive thermodynamic and the non-extensive\nstatistical entropy are perfectly alright within their own fields of\napplication. Changes in the statistical formulas that remove the discrepancy\nmust be seen as motivated by pragmatic reasons (conventions) rather than as\njustified by basic arguments about particle statistics.\n","Comment: To appear in \"New Challenges to the Philosophy of Science\", PSE\n  Volume 4, Springer 2012"]}]
