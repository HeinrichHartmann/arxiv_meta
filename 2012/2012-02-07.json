According to Kraichnan's 1962 prediction, the\nflow boundary layers above the cold and hot plates -in which most of the fluid\ntemperature drop is localized- become unstable for large enough $Ra$ and this\ninstability boosts the heat transport compared to the other turbulent regimes.\nUsing the same convection cell as in the 1997 experiment, we show that the\nreported heat transport increase is accompanied with enhanced temperature\nfluctuations of the bottom plate, which was heated at constant power levels.\nIndeed, for $Ra < 10^{12}$, the bottom plate fluctuations can simply be\naccounted from those in the bulk of the flow. In particular, they share the\nsame spectral density at low frequencies, as if the bottom plate was following\nthe slow temperature fluctuations of the bulk, modulo a constant temperature\ndrop across the bottom boundary layer. Conversely, to account for the plate's\ntemperature fluctuations at higher $Ra$, we no-longuer can ignore the\nfluctuations of the temperature drop across the boundary layer. The negative\nskewness of fluctuations at high $Ra$ supports the picture of a boundary layer\ninstability.

Detailed knowledge\nof the physical mechanisms that govern stellar birth is a prerequisite for\nunderstanding the formation and evolution of our galactic home, the Milky Way.\nA theory of star formation is an essential part of any model for the origin of\nour solar system and of planets around other stars. Despite this pivotal\nimportance, and despite many decades of research, our understanding of the\nprocesses that initiate and regulate star formation is still limited.\n  Stars are born in cold interstellar clouds of molecular hydrogen gas. Star\nformation in these clouds is governed by the complex interplay between the\ngravitational attraction in the gas and agents such as turbulence, magnetic\nfields, radiation and thermal pressure that resist compression. The competition\nbetween these processes determines both the locations at which young stars form\nand how much mass they ultimately accrete. It plays out over many orders of\nmagnitude in space and time, ranging from galactic to stellar scales. In\naddition, star formation is a highly stochastic process in which rare and\nhard-to-predict events, such as the formation of very massive stars and the\nresulting feedback, can play a dominant role in determining the evolution of a\nstar-forming cloud.\n  As a consequence of the wide range of scales and processes that control star\nformation, analytic models are usually restricted to highly idealized cases.\nThese can yield insight, but the complexity of the problem means that they must\nbe used in concert with large-scale numerical simulations.

Then, based on a suggestion of Bennett and\nSmith, we explicitly show how a party assisted by P-CTCs can distinguish a set\nof linearly independent quantum states, and we prove that it is not possible\nfor such a party to distinguish a set of linearly dependent states. The power\nof P-CTCs is thus weaker than that of D-CTCs because the Holevo bound still\napplies to circuits using them regardless of their ability to conspire in\nviolating the uncertainty principle. We then discuss how different notions of a\nquantum mixture that are indistinguishable in linear quantum mechanics lead to\ndramatically differing conclusions in a nonlinear quantum mechanics involving\nP-CTCs.

Since continuous tracking\nof global network state at all nodes is practically impossible, nodes can only\nacquire limited local views of the whole network to design their transmission\nstrategies. In this paper, we study multi-layer wireless networks and assume\nthat each node has only a limited knowledge, namely 1-local view, where each\nS-D pair has enough information to perform optimally when other pairs do not\ninterfere, along with connectivity information for rest of the network. We\ninvestigate the information-theoretic limits of communication with such limited\nknowledge at the nodes. We develop a novel transmission strategy, namely Coded\nLayer Scheduling, that solely relies on 1-local view at the nodes and\nincorporates three different techniques: (1) per layer interference avoidance,\n(2) repetition coding to allow overhearing of the interference, and (3) network\ncoding to allow interference neutralization. We show that our proposed scheme\ncan provide a significant throughput gain compared with the conventional\ninterference avoidance strategies. Furthermore, we show that our strategy\nmaximizes the achievable normalized sum-rate for some classes of networks,\nhence, characterizing the normalized sum-capacity of those networks with\n1-local view.\n","Comment: Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory"]}]

The\ndiffusion of plasmas and magnetic field is enabled by reconnection and\ntherefore is termed \"reconnection diffusion\". We explore the consequences of\nreconnection diffusion for star formation. In the paper we explain the physics\nof reconnection diffusion both from macroscopic and microscopic points of view.\nWe quantify the reconnection diffusion rate both for weak and strong MHD\nturbulence and address the problem of reconnection diffusion acting together\nwith ambipolar diffusion. In addition, we provide a criterion for correctly\nrepresenting the magnetic diffusivity in simulations of star formation. We show\nthat the role of the plasma effects is limited to \"breaking up lines\" on small\nscales and does not affect the rate of reconnection diffusion. We address the\nexisting observational results and demonstrate how reconnection diffusion can\nexplain the puzzles presented by observations, in particular, the observed\nhigher magnetization of cloud cores in comparison with the magnetization of\nenvelopes. We also outline a possible set of observational tests of the\nreconnection diffusion concept and discuss how the application of the new\nconcept changes our understanding of star formation and its numerical modeling.\nFinally, we outline the differences of the process of reconnection diffusion\nand the process of accumulation of matter along magnetic field lines that is\nfrequently invoked to explain the results of numerical simulations\n","Comment: 35 pages, 15 figures, extended after comments by the referee\n  (submitted to Nonlin.

The model also\nexplains why a tremor has no clear impulsive phase, in contrast to earthquakes.\nThe relationship between tremor and low frequency earthquakes is discussed.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 1 figure"]}]

The He I absorption signature connecting two pores of opposite polarity\nin an emerging flux region is investigated. This signature is suggestive of a\nloop system connecting the two pores. We aim to show that limits can be set on\nthe height of this chromospheric loop system.\n  Methods. The increasing anisotropy in the illumination of a thin, magnetic\nstructure intensifies the linear polarization signal observed in the He I\ntriplet with height.

Otherwise, the\n$\\delta'$-potential is fully non-transparent. Moreover, when the transmission\nis non-zero, the structure of a resonant set depends on a regularizing sequence\n$\\Delta'_\\varepsilon(x)$ that tends to $\\delta'(x)$ in the sense of\ndistributions as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$. Therefore, from a practical point of\nview, it would be interesting to have an inverse solution, i.e. for a given\n$\\bar{\\lambda} \\in \\R$ to construct such a regularizing sequence\n$\\Delta'_\\varepsilon(x)$ that the $\\delta'$-potential at this value is\ntransparent.

To quantify the uncertainty arising from\nrandom rate constants, it is necessary to investigate how one can simulate such\na biochemical system. To do this, we will take the Gillespie's stochastic\nsimulation algorithm for simulating the evolution of the state of a chemical\nsystem, and study a modification of the algorithm that incorporates the random\nrate constants. In addition to simulating the waiting time of each reaction\nstep, the modified algorithm also involves simulating the random fluctuation of\nthe rate constant at each reaction time. We consider the modified algorithm in\na general framework, then specialize it to two contrasting physical models, one\nin which the fluctuations occur on a much faster time scale than the reaction\nstep, and the other in which the fluctuations occur much more slowly. The\nlatter case was applied to the single enzyme reaction system, using in part the\nMetropolis-Hastings algorithm to enact the given distribution on the random\nrate constants. The modified algorithm is shown to produce simulation outputs\nthat are corroborated by the experimental results. It is hoped that this\nmodified algorithm can subsequently be used as a tool for the estimation or\ncalibration of parameters in the system using experimental data.\n"]}]

We needed to know the exact points where the predicted\nduration of the solar eclipse was 0 seconds. This phenomenon allows, observed\non this particular position, the measurement of the solar diameter. The work is\ncomposed by three parts. In the first one is described the evolution of the\nlunar theory from Hipparchus to the current theory (Bureau de Longitudes/IMCCE,\nChapront). The second part is dedicated to geodesy (WGS84 datum) and there are\nexamples of longitude's calculations. In the third one there is the analysis of\nthe parameters to understand the reasons about the different extensions of the\numbral shadow and the different positions of the centre line in the solar\neclipse calculated respectively with French and American ephemerides. The use\nof the center of the figure of the Moon with respect to the center of mass\nproduces the differences in the ephemerides.
