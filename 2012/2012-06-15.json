Our\nmain result concerns this quantity when $G$ is regular and bipartite. We find\nnumbers $0 \\leq a^-(k) \\leq a^+(k) \\leq 1$ with the property that for all such\n$G$, with high probability the proportion is between $a^-(k)$ and $a^+(k)$, and\nwe give examples where these extremes are achieved. For many $H$ we have\n$a^-(k) = a^+(k)$ for all $k$ and so in these cases we obtain a quite precise\ndescription of the almost sure appearance of a randomly chosen $H$-colouring.\n  As a corollary, we show that in a uniform proper $q$-colouring of a regular\nbipartite graph, if $q$ is even then with high probability every colour appears\non a proportion close to $1/q$ of the vertices, while if $q$ is odd then with\nhigh probability every colour appears on at least a proportion close to\n$1/(q+1)$ of the vertices and at most a proportion close to $1/(q-1)$ of the\nvertices.\n  Our results generalize to natural models of weighted $H$-colourings, and also\nto bipartite graphs which are sufficiently close to regular. As an application\nof this latter extension we describe the typical structure of $H$-colourings of\ngraphs which are obtained from $n$-regular bipartite graphs by percolation, and\nwe show that $p=1/n$ is a threshold function across which the typical structure\nchanges.\n  The approach is through entropy, and extends work of J. Kahn, who considered\nthe size of a randomly chosen independent set of a regular bipartite graph.\n","Comment: 27 pages, small revisions from previous version, this version appears\n  in Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B"]}]

Since this seminal work of\nErd\\H{o}s and R\\'{e}nyi, various random graph models have been introduced and\nstudied. In this paper we study the so-called Bohman-Frieze process, a simple\nmodification of the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi process. The Bohman-Frieze process\nbegins with an empty graph on n vertices. At each step two random edges are\npresent and if the first edge would join two isolated vertices, it is added to\na graph; otherwise the second edge is added. We present several new results on\nthe phase transition of the Bohman-Frieze random graph process.

Writing ${\\rm hom}(G,H)$ for the number of\n$H$-colorings admitted by $G$, we conjecture that for any simple finite graph\n$H$ (perhaps with loops) and any simple finite $n$-vertex, $d$-regular,\nloopless graph $G$ we have $$ {\\rm hom}(G,H) \\leq \\max{{\\rm\nhom}(K_{d,d},H)^{\\frac{n}{2d}}, {\\rm hom}(K_{d+1},H)^{\\frac{n}{d+1}}} $$ where\n$K_{d,d}$ is the complete bipartite graph with $d$ vertices in each partition\nclass, and $K_{d+1}$ is the complete graph on $d+1$ vertices.\n  Results of Zhao confirm this conjecture for some choices of $H$ for which the\nmaximum is achieved by ${\\rm hom}(K_{d,d},H)^{n/2d}$. Here we exhibit\ninfinitely many non-trivial triples $(n,d,H)$ for which the conjecture is true\nand for which the maximum is achieved by ${\\rm hom}(K_{d+1},H)^{n/(d+1)}$.\n  We also give sharp estimates for ${\\rm hom}(K_{d,d},H)$ and ${\\rm\nhom}(K_{d+1},H)$ in terms of some structural parameters of $H$. This allows us\nto characterize those $H$ for which ${\\rm hom}(K_{d,d},H)^{1/2d}$ is eventually\n(for all sufficiently large $d$) larger than ${\\rm hom}(K_{d+1},H)^{1/(d+1)}$\nand those for which it is eventually smaller, and to show that this dichotomy\ncovers all non-trivial $H$. Our estimates also allow us to obtain asymptotic\nevidence for the conjecture in the following form. For fixed $H$, for all\n$d$-regular $G$ we have $$ {\\rm hom}(G,H)^{\\frac{1}{|V(G)|}} \\leq\n(1+o(1))\\max{{\\rm hom}(K_{d,d},H)^{\\frac{1}{2d}}, {\\rm\nhom}(K_{d+1},H)^{\\frac{1}{d+1}}} $$ where $o(1)\\rightarrow 0$ as $d \\rightarrow\n\\infty$.

We briefly introduce the concept of Supersymmetry and describe the\nMSSM, then we introduce our extended model, describing its main properties.\n  Then it starts the original part of the thesis. First there is the study of\nthe model in the most general case, in which there is mixing between the SM\nU(1) and the anomalous U(1). This is followed by the calculation of all the\nvertices and the amplitudes that are of interest for the phenomenology that we\nare going to study.\n  After describing in details how the Boltzmann Equation gives the relic\ndensity of particle species, we use it and the amplitudes of our model already\ncalculated to study if the neutralinos introduced by our model can be viable\ncandidates to describe the Dark Matter relic density. We have found that this\nis the case only if the anomalous candidate coannihilates with a MSSM\nneutralino.\n  In the case of no mixing between the U(1)s we have obtained this results\nperforming analytical calculations, whom results we show for many mass gaps.\n  To obtain the same result in the mixing case we have modified the DarkSUSY\npackage. This has also permitted us to obtain more precise informations about\nthe dependence of the relic density on the various free parameters of the\nmodel. We show many plots containing these results.\n  In the last part of the thesis we study the Asymmetry at the LHC for our\nmodel. We start introducing the Forward-Backward Asymmetry then we move on to\ndescribe how it can be utilized at the LHC. We introduce different possible\ndefinitions and describe their properties, then we calculate their predicted\nvalues in our model. Finally we explain how these results could be used to\nimpose constraints over theoretical models that describe beyond the Standard\nModel physics.\n","Comment: 123 pages, 74 figures, PhD thesis of Andrea Mammarella (Advisor:\n  F.Fucito), University of Rome, Tor Vergata"]}]

It could be, therefore, no surprise that the first\ndata protection law in the German state of Hesse contained rules to protect the\nindividual as well as the balance of power between the legislative and the\nexecutive body of the state. Social networks like Facebook or Google+ do not\nonly endanger their users by exposing them to other users or the public. They\nconstitute, first and foremost, a threat to society as a whole by collecting\ninformation about individuals, groups, and organizations from different social\nsystems and combining them in a centralized data bank. They transgress the\nboundaries between social systems that act as a shield against total visibility\nand transparency of the individual and protect the freedom and the autonomy of\nthe people.
