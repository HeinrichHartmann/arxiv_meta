However, how to satisfy many constraints in these\nalgorithmic settings has been shown to be intractable. One alternative to\nencode many constraints is to use spectral clustering, which remains a\ndeveloping area. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework for constrained\nspectral clustering. In contrast to some previous efforts that implicitly\nencode Must-Link and Cannot-Link constraints by modifying the graph Laplacian\nor constraining the underlying eigenspace, we present a more natural and\nprincipled formulation, which explicitly encodes the constraints as part of a\nconstrained optimization problem. Our method offers several practical\nadvantages: it can encode the degree of belief in Must-Link and Cannot-Link\nconstraints; it guarantees to lower-bound how well the given constraints are\nsatisfied using a user-specified threshold; it can be solved deterministically\nin polynomial time through generalized eigendecomposition. Furthermore, by\ninheriting the objective function from spectral clustering and encoding the\nconstraints explicitly, much of the existing analysis of unconstrained spectral\nclustering techniques remains valid for our formulation. We validate the\neffectiveness of our approach by empirical results on both artificial and real\ndatasets. We also demonstrate an innovative use of encoding large number of\nconstraints: transfer learning via constraints.\n","Comment: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 2012"]}]

The aim here\nis to exploit EVLA imaging at 8.4 GHz to establish the QSOs as radio/sub-mm\nsources. The challenge in reducing the EVLA data was the presence of a strong\n4C source in the field. A new calibration algorithm was applied to the data to\nsubtract it. The resulting thermal noise limited radio map covers the 16'x16'\nExtended WHDF. It contains 41 sources above a 4-sigma limit, 17 of which have\nprimary beam corrected flux. The radio observations show that the absorbed AGN\nwith LABOCA detections are coincident with radio sources, confirming the\ntendency for X-ray absorbed AGN to be sub-mm bright. These sources show strong\nultraviolet excess (UVX) suggesting the nuclear sightline is gas- but not\ndust-absorbed. Of the 3 remaining LABOCA sources within the ~5' half-power beam\nwidth, 1 is identified with a faint nuclear X-ray/radio source in a nearby\ngalaxy, 1 with a faint radio source and 1 is unidentified in any other band.\n  More generally, differential radio source counts are in good agreement with\nprevious observations, showing at S<50 micro-Jy a significant excess over a\npure AGN model.

For example, it is desirable to have a small duty cycle in some low\npower systems; a half-duplex radio cannot keep transmitting if it wishes to\nreceive useful signals; and a cognitive radio needs to listen and detect\nprimary users frequently. This work studies the capacity of scalar\ndiscrete-time Gaussian channels subject to duty cycle constraint as well as\naverage transmit power constraint. An idealized duty cycle constraint is first\nstudied, which can be regarded as a requirement on the minimum fraction of\nnontransmissions or zero symbols in each codeword. A unique discrete input\ndistribution is shown to achieve the channel capacity. In many situations,\nnumerically optimized on-off signaling can achieve much higher rate than\nGaussian signaling over a deterministic transmission schedule. This is in part\nbecause the positions of nontransmissions in a codeword can convey information.\nFurthermore, a more realistic duty cycle constraint is studied, where the extra\ncost of transitions between transmissions and nontransmissions due to pulse\nshaping is accounted for. The capacity-achieving input is no longer independent\nover time and is hard to compute. A lower bound of the achievable rate as a\nfunction of the input distribution is shown to be maximized by a first-order\nMarkov input process, the distribution of which is also discrete and can be\ncomputed efficiently. The results in this paper suggest that, under various\nduty cycle constraints, departing from the usual paradigm of intermittent\npacket transmissions may yield substantial gain.\n","Comment: 36 pages, 6 figures"]}]

To tackle this problem, nested blocks combined\nwith backward decoding are used in our framework, so that the D-F relay nodes\nat different levels can perform backward decoding at different frequencies. As\nsuch, the upstream D-F relay nodes can decode before the downstream D-F relay\nnodes, and the use of backward decoding at each D-F relay node ensures the full\nexploitation of the help of both the other D-F relay nodes and the C-F relay\nnodes.

We identified widespread positive and negative\ncorrelations between EEG spectral power and fMRI BOLD connectivity fluctuations\nin a network of 90 cortical and subcortical regions.

Furthermore, these patterns were\naltered for subjects undergoing vigilance changes, with an involvement of the\nslow delta (0.4 - 4 Hz) band in localized positive correlations. Finally, graph\ntheoretical indices of network structure also exhibited sharp changes over\ntime, with average path length correlating positively with alpha power\nextracted from central and frontal electrodes.
