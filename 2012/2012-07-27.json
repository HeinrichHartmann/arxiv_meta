Suppression of the screening at\nlarge distances, caused by appearance of the gap, is considered\nself-consistently. A mutual positive feedback between appearance of the gap and\nenlargement of the interaction leads to a sharp transition to correlated state\nwith greatly increased gap above some critical value of the coupling strength.\nAt coupling strength below the critical, this correlation effect increases the\ngap approximately by a factor of two. The maximal coupling strength achievable\nin experiments is close to the critical value. This indicated importance of\ncorrelation effects in closely-spaced graphene bilayers at weak substrate\ndielectric screening. Another effect beyond mean-field approximation considered\nis an influence of vertex corrections on the pairing, which is shown to be very\nweak.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 5 figures; some references were added"]}]

First, we consider the question of\nhow well maximum matching can be approximated in a single pass over the input\nusing \\tilde O(n)$ space, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the input\ngraph. Two natural variants of this problem have been considered in the\nliterature: (1) the edge arrival setting, where edges arrive in the stream and\n(2) the vertex arrival setting, where vertices on one side of the graph arrive\nin the stream together with all their incident edges. The latter setting has\nalso been studied extensively in the context of {\\em online algorithms}, where\neach arriving vertex has to either be matched irrevocably or discarded upon\narrival. In the online setting, the celebrated algorithm of\nKarp-Vazirani-Vazirani achieves a $1-1/e$ approximation. Despite the fact that\nthe streaming model is less restrictive in that the algorithm is not\nconstrained to match vertices irrevocably upon arrival, the best known\napproximation in the streaming model with vertex arrivals and $\\tilde O(n)$\nspace is the same factor of $1-1/e$.\n  We show that no single pass streaming algorithm that uses $\\tilde O(n)$ space\ncan achieve a better than $1-1/e$ approximation to maximum matching, even in\nthe vertex arrival setting. This leads to the striking conclusion that no\nsingle pass streaming algorithm can do better than online algorithms unless it\nuses significantly more than $\\tilde O(n)$ space. Additionally, our bound\nyields the best known impossibility result for approximating matchings in the\n{\\em edge arrival} model.\n  We also give a simple algorithm that achieves approximation ratio\n$1-e^{-k}k^{k-1}/(k-1)!=1-\\frac1{\\sqrt{2\\pi k}}+o(1/k)$ in $k$ passes in the\nvertex arrival model using linear space, improving upon previously best known\nconvergence.\n"]}]

Stars\nnear such a peak can migrate over a significant distance in galactocentric\nradius during the peak lifetime, providing that the peak is sufficiently dense.\nUsing a Gaussian bar model for the potential perturbation associated with a\nnarrow transient spiral feature, estimates of the migration rate, angular\noffset between particle and spiral feature, and maximum eccentricity for\nmigrators roughly agrees with the values measured in our simulation. When\nmultiple spiral density waves are present, local density peaks can appear and\ndisappear on timescales faster than the timescale estimated for growth and\ndecay of individual waves and the peak surface density can be larger than for\nany individual wave.

RCPs are convex optimization problems with a (usually large)\nnumber N of randomly extracted constraints; they arise in several applicative\nareas, especially in the context of decision under uncertainty, see [2],[3]. We\nhere consider a setup in which instances of the random constraints (the\nscenario) are not held by a single centralized processing unit, but are\ndistributed among different nodes of a network. Each node \"sees\" only a small\nsubset of the constraints, and may communicate with neighbors. The objective is\nto make all nodes converge to the same solution as the centralized RCP problem.\nTo this end, we develop two distributed algorithms that are variants of the\nconstraints consensus algorithm [4],[5]: the active constraints consensus (ACC)\nalgorithm, and the vertex constraints consensus (VCC) algorithm. We show that\nthe ACC algorithm computes the overall optimal solution in finite time, and\nwith almost surely bounded communication at each iteration. The VCC algorithm\nis instead tailored for the special case in which the constraint functions are\nconvex also w.r.t. the uncertain parameters, and it computes the solution in a\nnumber of iterations bounded by the diameter of the communication graph. We\nfurther devise a variant of the VCC algorithm, namely quantized vertex\nconstraints consensus (qVCC), to cope with the case in which communication\nbandwidth among processors is bounded. We discuss several applications of the\nproposed distributed techniques, including estimation, classification, and\nrandom model predictive control, and we present a numerical analysis of the\nperformance of the proposed methods. As a complementary numerical result, we\nshow that the parallel computation of the scenario solution using ACC algorithm\nsignificantly outperforms its centralized equivalent.\n"]}]
