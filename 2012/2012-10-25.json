Once inside the symplast, zinc is transported to the\npericycle, where it exits by means of HMA (Heavy Metal ATPase) transporters.\nThe combination of symplastic transport and spatial separation of influx and\nefflux produces a pattern in which zinc accumulates in the pericycle. Here,\nmathematical modelling was employed to study the importance of ZIP regulation,\nHMA abundance and symplastic transport in creation of the radial pattern of\nzinc in primary roots of Arabidopsis thaliana.\n  A comprehensive one-dimensional dynamic model of radial zinc transport in\nroots was developed and used to conduct simulations. The model accounts for the\nstructure of the root consisting of symplast and apoplast and includes effects\nof water flow, diffusion, and cross-membrane transport via transporters. It\nalso incorporates the radial geometry and varying porosity of root tissues, as\nwell as regulation of ZIP transporters.\n  Steady state patterns were calculated for various zinc concentrations in the\nmedium, water influx and HMA abundance. The experimentally observed zinc\ngradient was reproduced very well. Increase of HMA or decrease in water influx\nled to loss of the gradient. The dynamic behaviour for a change in medium\nconcentration and water influx was also simulated showing short adaptation\ntimes in the range of seconds to minutes. Slowing down regulation led to\noscillations in expression levels, suggesting the need for rapid regulation and\nexistence of buffering agents.\n  The model captures the experimental findings very well and confirms the\nhypothesis that low abundance of HMA4 produces a radial gradient in zinc\nconcentration. Surprisingly, transpiration was found to be also a key\nparameter. The model suggests that ZIP regulation takes place on a comparable\ntime scale as symplastic transport.\n","Comment: Main text, 9 figures and one Supplemental file.

We start with the\nMaclaurin inventions on Calculus and their remarkable role in the early mid\n1700s; next we focus a bit on his evaluation, 1742, of the hyperbolic excess,\nexplaining the true motivation behind his research. To his\ngeometrical-analytical treatment we attach ours, a purely analytical\nalternative. Our hyperbola inquiry is then switched to John Landen, an amateur\nmathematician, who probably was writing more to fix his priorities than to\nexplain his remarkable findings. We follow him in the obscure proofs of his\ntheorem on hyperbola rectification, explaining the links to Maclaurin and so\non. With a chain of geometrical constructions, we attach our interpretation to\nLanden's treatment. Our modern analytical proof to his hyperbolic limit excess,\nby means of elliptic integrals of the first and second kind is also provided,\nand we demonstrate why the so called Landen transformation for the elliptic\nintegrals cannot be ascribed to him. Next, the subject leaves England for the\nContinent: the character of Lagrange is introduced, even if our interest\nconcerns only his 1785 memoir on irrational integrals, where the Arithmetic\nGeometric Mean, AGM, is established by him. Nevertheless, our objective is not\nthe AGM, but to detect the real source of the so-called Landen transformation\nfor elliptic integrals. In fact, Lagrange's paper encloses a differential\nidentity stemming from the AGM: integrating it, we show how it could be\npossible to arrive at the well-known Legendre recursive computation of a first\nkind elliptic integral, which appeared in his Trait\\'e, 1827, much after the\nLagrange's paper.\n","Comment: 34 pages, 8 figures.

Failure\nto reach the collective target thus has dire consequences for all group\nmembers, independently of their strategies. Wanting to move away from\nunfavorable locations is therefore all but surprising. Inspired by these\nobservations, we here propose and study a collective-risk social dilemma where\nplayers are allowed to move if the collective failure becomes too probable.\nMore precisely, this so-called risk-driven migration is launched depending on\nthe difference between the actual contributions and the declared target.\nMobility therefore becomes an inherent property that is utilized in an entirely\nself-organizing manner. We show that under these assumptions cooperation is\npromoted much more effectively than under the action of manually determined\nmigration rates. For the latter, we in fact identify parameter regions where\nthe evolution of cooperation is incredibly inhibited. Moreover, we find\nunexpected spatial patterns where cooperators that do not form compact clusters\noutperform those that do, and where defectors are able to utilize strikingly\ndifferent ways of invasion. The presented results support the recently revealed\nimportance of percolation for the successful evolution of public cooperation,\nwhile at the same time revealing surprisingly simple ways of self-organization\ntowards socially desirable states.\n","Comment: 8 two-column pages, 7 figures; accepted for publication in Physical\n  Review E"]}]
