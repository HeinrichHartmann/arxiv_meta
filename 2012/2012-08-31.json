We model the chemistry of the inner wind of the carbon star IRC+10216\nand consider the effect of periodic shocks induced by the stellar pulsation on\nthe gas to follow the non-equilibrium chemistry in the shocked gas layers. We\nconsider a very complete set of chemical families, including hydrocarbons and\naromatics, hydrides, halogens and phosphorous-bearing species. Derived\nabundances are compared to the latest observational data from large surveys and\nHerschel. Results. The shocks induce a non-equilibrium chemistry in the dust\nformation zone of IRC+10216 where the collision destruction of CO in the\npost-shock gas triggers the formation of O-bearing species (H2O, SiO). Most of\nthe modelled abundances agree very well with the latest values derived from\nHerschel data on IRC+10216. Hydrides form a family of abundant species that are\nexpelled into the intermediate envelope. In particular, HF traps all the atomic\nfluorine in the dust formation zone. Halogens are also abundant and their\nchemistry is independent of the C/O ratio of the star. Therefore, HCl and other\nCl-bearing species should also be present in the inner wind of O-rich AGB or\nsupergiant stars. We identify a specific region ranging from 2.5 R* to 4 R*,\nwhere polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons form and grow. The estimated carbon\ndust-to-gas mass ratio derived from the mass of aromatics ranges from 1.2 x\n10^(-3) to 5.8 x 10^{-3} and agrees well with existing observational values.\nThe aromatic formation region is located outside hot layers where SiC2 is\nproduced as a bi-product of silicon carbide dust synthesis. Finally, we predict\nthat some molecular lines will show flux variation with pulsation phase and\ntime (e.g., H2O) while other species will not (e.g., CO). These variations\nmerely reflect the non-equilibrium chemistry that destroys and reforms\nmolecules over a pulsation period in the shocked gas of the dust formation\nzone.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 10 figures.

Electroencephalogramme (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI)\ncontrolled lower extremity prostheses may restore intuitive and able-body-like\nambulation after SCI. To test its feasibility, the authors developed and tested\na novel EEG-based, data-driven BCI system for intuitive and self-paced control\nof the ambulation of an avatar within a virtual reality environment (VRE).\n  Approach: Eight able-bodied subjects and one with SCI underwent the following\n10-min training session: subjects alternated between idling and walking\nkinaesthetic motor imageries (KMI) while their EEG were recorded and analysed\nto generate subject-specific decoding models. Subjects then performed a\ngoal-oriented online task, repeated over 5 sessions, in which they utilised the\nKMI to control the linear ambulation of an avatar and make 10 sequential stops\nat designated points within the VRE.\n  Main results: The average offline training performance across subjects was\n77.2 +/- 9.5%, ranging from 64.3% (p = 0.00176) to 94.5% (p = 6.26*10^-23),\nwith chance performance being 50%.

Most observational studies so far point towards brown dwarfs sharing\na similar formation mechanism as the one accepted for low mass stars. However,\nlarger databases and more systematic studies are needed before strong\nconclusions can be reached. Aims. In this second paper of a series devoted to\nthe study of the spectroscopic properties of the members of the Lambda Orionis\nStar Forming Region, we study accretion, activity and rotation for a wide set\nof spectroscopically confirmed members of the central star cluster Collinder 69\nto draw analogies and/or differences between the brown dwarf and stellar\npopulations of this cluster. Moreover, we present comparisons with other star\nforming regions of similar and different ages to address environmental effects\non our conclusions. Methods. We study prominent photospheric lines to derive\nrotational velocities and emission lines to distinguish between accretion\nprocesses and chromospheric activity. In addition, we include information about\ndisk presence and X-ray emission. Results. We report very large differences in\nthe disk fractions of low mass stars and brown dwarfs (~58%) when compared to\nhigher mass stars (26+4-3%) with 0.6 Msun being the critical mass we find for\nthis dichotomy. As a byproduct, we address the implications of the spatial\ndistribution of disk and diskless members in the formation scenario of the\ncluster itself. We have used the Halpha emission to discriminate among\naccreting and non-accreting sources finding that 38+8-7% of sources harboring\ndisks undergo active accretion and that his percentage stays similar in the\nsubstellar regime. For those sources we have estimated accretion rates.\nFinally, regarding rotational velocities, we find a high dispersion in vsin(i)\nwhich is even larger among the diskless population.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A. 18 figs including the Appendix and\n  an online table"]}]

In\ndetail, when a new node enters the network, it either connects to a randomly\nselected node, or to the j -ancestor of this selected node. The j -ancestor is\nfound by following j links from the randomly selected node. The system is shown\nto undergo a transition to a phase where condensates develop.

We calculate analytically the asymptotic behaviour of the model and\nderive a phase diagram that depends on the frequency of random opinion flips\nand on the inter-connectivity between the two communities. It is shown that\nthree regimes may take place: a disordered regime, where no collective\nphenomena takes place; a symmetric regime, where the nodes in both communities\nreach the same average opinion; an asymmetric regime, where the nodes in each\ncommunity reach an opposite average opinion. The transition from the asymmetric\nregime to the symmetric regime is shown to be discontinuous.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 4 figures"]}]
