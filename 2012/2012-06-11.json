Here,\nwe contribute to further advance our understanding of epidemic spreading\nprocesses by proposing a non-perturbative formulation of the heterogeneous mean\nfield approach that has been commonly used in the physics literature to deal\nwith this kind of spreading phenomena. The non-perturbative equations we\npropose have no assumption about the proximity of the system to the epidemic\nthreshold, nor any linear approximation of the dynamics. In particular, we\nfirst develop a probabilistic description at the node level of the epidemic\npropagation for the so-called susceptible-infected-susceptible family of\nmodels, and after we derive the corresponding heterogeneous mean-field\napproach. We propose to use the full extension of the approach instead of\npruning the expansion to first order, which leads to a non-perturbative\nformulation that can be solved by fixed point iteration, and used with\nreliability far away from the epidemic threshold to assess the prevalence of\nthe epidemics. Our results are in close agreement with Monte Carlo simulations\nthus enhancing the predictive power of the classical heterogeneous mean field\napproach, while providing a more effective framework in terms of computational\ntime.\n","Comment: 7 pages"]}]

The proposed algorithm is outlined as follows - To resolve\na query, the mobile client searches its cache to check if its data is valid. If\nyes, then query is answered, otherwise the client queries the DTA (Dynamic\nTransmitting Agent) for latest updates and the query is answered. If DTA\ndoesn't have the latest updates, it gets it from the server. So, the main idea\nhere is that DTA will be multicasting updates to the clients and hence the\nclients need not uplink to the server individually, thus preserving the network\nbandwidth.

Using magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI), the local properties of the flow are obtained by the\ndetermination of local velocity profiles and concentrations in a Couette cell.\nFor low rotational rates, we observe shear localization characteristic of yield\nstress fluids. When the overall shear rate is increased, the width of the\nsheared region increases. The discontinuous shear thickening is found to set in\nat the end of this shear localization regime when all of the fluid is sheared:\nthe existence of a nonflowing region, thus, seems to prevent or delay shear\nthickening. Macroscopic observations using different measurement geometries\nshow that the smaller the gap of the shear cell, the lower the shear rate at\nwhich shear thickening sets in. We, thus, propose that the discontinuous shear\nthickening of cornstarch suspensions is a consequence of dilatancy: the system\nunder flow attempts to dilate but instead undergoes a jamming transition,\nbecause it is confined. This proposition is confirmed by an independent\nmeasurement of the dilation of the suspension as a function of the shear rate.\nIt is also explains the MRI observations: when flow is localized, the\nnonflowing region plays the role of a \"dilatancy reservoir\" which allows the\nmaterial to be sheared without jamming.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:0709.3171, and with\n  arXiv:1101.2309, arXiv:cond-mat/0406422 by other authors"]}]
