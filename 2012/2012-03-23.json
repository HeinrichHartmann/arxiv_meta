The models include realistic low temperature cooling\nand cover a range of plausible interstellar medium densities and stellar\nvelocities between 0.3 - 1.9 cm-3 and 28 - 73 km/s. We show that the flow\ndynamics and morphology of the bow shock differ substantially due to the\npreferential growth of Rayleigh-Taylor or Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in the\nmodels. The former dominate the models with slow stellar velocities resulting\nin a clumpy bow shock sub-structure, whereas the latter produce a smoother,\nmore layered sub-structure in the fast models. If the mass in the bow shock\nshell is low, as seems to be implied by the AKARI luminosities (~0.003 Msun),\nthen Betelgeuse's bow shock is very young and is unlikely to have reached a\nsteady state. The circular nature of the bow shock shell is consistent with\nthis conclusion. Thus, our results suggest that Betelgeuse entered the red\nsupergiant phase only recently.\n","Comment: Minor revisions, replaced Fig. 1, 15, and 16, added movies.

I\nbegin with non-self-gravitating, low viscosity discs and show that giant\nplanets induce shocks inside its co-orbital region, leading to a profile\nunstable to vortex formation around a potential vorticity minimum. This\ninstability is commonly known as the vortex or Rossby wave instability.\nVortex-planet interaction lead to episodic phases of migration, which can be\nunderstood in the framework of type III migration. I then examine the effect of\ndisc self-gravity on gap stability. The linear theory of the Rossby wave\ninstability is extended to include disc gravity, which shows that self-gravity\nis effective at stabilising the vortex instability at small azimuthal\nwavenumber. This is consistent with the observation that more vortices develop\nwith increasing disc mass in hydrodynamic simulations. Vortices in\nself-gravitating discs also resist merging, and is most simply understood as\npair-vortices undergoing mutual horsehoe turns upon encounter. I show that in\nsufficiently massive discs vortex modes are suppressed. Instead, global spiral\ninstabilities develop which are associated with a potential vorticity maximum\nat the gap edge. These edge modes can be physically understood as a result of\nunstable interaction between the gap edge and the exterior disc through\ngravity.

Our\ngoal is to obscure detail in public video streams by blurring while allowing\nbehavior to be recognized and to quickly deblur the stream so that details are\navailable if behavior is recognized as suspicious. We create a CBP by blurring\nthe same latent image with two unknown kernels. The two kernels are coprime\nwhen mapped to bivariate polynomials in the z domain. To deblur the CBP we\nfirst use the coprime constraint to approximate the kernels and sample the\nbivariate CBP polynomials in one dimension on the unit circle. At each sample\npoint, we factor the 1D polynomial pair and compose the results into a 2D\nkernel matrix. Finally, we compute the inverse Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of\nthe kernel matrices to recover the coprime kernels and then the latent video\nstream. It is therefore only possible to deblur the video stream if a user has\naccess to both streams. To improve the practicability of our algorithm, we\nimplement our algorithm using a graphics processing unit (GPU) to decrypt the\nblurred video streams in real-time, and extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that our new scheme can effectively protect sensitive identity\ninformation in surveillance videos and faithfully reconstruct the unblurred\nvideo stream when two blurred sequences are available.\n"]}]

In this\nmethod the coefficients at $k$ are determined by summing the contributions made\nby each partition whose elements sum to $k$. These contributions are found by\nassigning values to each element and multiplying by an appropriate multinomial\nfactor. This work presents a theoretical framework for the partition method for\na power series expansion. To overcome the complexity due to the contributions,\na programming methodology is created allowing more general problems to be\nstudied than envisaged originally. The methodology uses the bi-variate\nrecursive central partition (BRCP) algorithm, which is based on a tree-diagram\napproach to scanning partitions. Its main advantage is that partitions are\ngenerated in the multiplicity representation. During the development of the\ntheoretical framework, scanning over partitions was seen as a discrete\noperation with an operator $L_{P,k}[ \\cdot]$, whose summand depends on the\ncoefficients of the two series when the original function is written as a\npseudo-composite function. Simple modifications result in programs for other\noperators of specific types of partitions such as: (1) only odd or even\nelements, (2) a fixed number of elements, (3) discrete elements, (4) specific\nelements and (5) those restricted by element size. Another modification\ngenerates conjugate partitions by transposing Ferrers diagrams. The operator\napproach is then applied to the generating functions for both discrete and\nstandard partitions. The main generalisation introduces a parameter $\\omega$,\nwhose powers give the number of elements in the partitions while the\ncoefficients become polynomials in $\\omega$.
