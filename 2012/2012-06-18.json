To date, the properties of the bump\nhave been examined in only two GRB afterglows (GRB 070802 and GRB 080607). In\nthis work we analyse in detail the detections of the 2175 extinction bump in\nthe optical spectra of the two further GRB afterglows: GRB 080605 and 080805.\nWe gather all available optical/NIR photometric, spectroscopic and X-ray data\nto construct multi-epoch SEDs for both GRB afterglows. We fit the SEDs with the\nFitzpatrick & Massa (1990) model with a single or broken PL. We also fit a\nsample of 38 GRB afterglows, known to prefer a SMC-type extinction curve, with\nthe same model. We find that the SEDs of GRB 080605 and GRB 080805 at two\nepochs are fit well with a single PL with a derived extinction of A_V =\n0.52(+0.13 -0.16) and 0.50 (+0.13 -0.10), and 2.1(+0.7-0.6) and 1.5+/-0.2\nrespectively. While the slope of the extinction curve of GRB 080805 is not\nwell-constrained, the extinction curve of GRB 080605 has an unusual very steep\nfar-UV rise together with the 2175 bump. Such an extinction curve has\npreviously been found in only a small handful of sightlines in the MW. One\npossible explanation of such an extinction curve may be dust arising from two\ndifferent regions with two separate grain populations, however we cannot\ndistinguish the origin of the curve. We finally compare the four 2175 bump\nsightlines to the larger GRB afterglow sample and to Local Group sightlines. We\nfind that while the width and central positions of the bumps are consistent\nwith what is observed in the Local Group, the relative strength of the detected\nbump (A_bump) for GRB afterglows is weaker for a given A_V than for almost any\nLocal Group sightline.

Two approaches to\nenforcing acyclicity are considered: either by encoding the ancestor relation\nor by attaching a total order to each graph and encoding that. The latter\napproach gives better results. Learning experiments have been conducted on 21\nsynthetic datasets sampled from 7 BNs. The largest dataset has 10,000\ndatapoints and 60 variables producing (for the 'ancestor' encoding) a weighted\nCNF input file with 19,932 atoms and 269,367 clauses. For most datasets,\nMaxWalkSat quickly finds BNs with higher BDeu score than the 'true' BN. The\neffect of adding prior information is assessed. It is further shown that\nBayesian model averaging can be effected by collecting BNs generated during the\nsearch.\n","Comment: Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Uncertainty\n  in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2008)"]}]

By computing a certain intersection multiplicity, we show how\nMikhalkin's approach to computing Gromov-Witten invariants fits into our\napproach. This begins to address a question raised by Dickenstein, Feichtner,\nand Sturmfels.
