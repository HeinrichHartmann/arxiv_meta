In the protein models,\nhydrogen bond interactions, electrostatic repulsion, and covalent bond\nvibrations are modeled by discontinuous step, shoulder and square-well\npotentials, respectively. The protein-like chains exhibit a secondary alpha\nhelix structure in their folded states at low temperatures, and allow a natural\ndefinition of a configuration by considering which beads are bonded. Free\nenergies and entropies of configurations are computed using the parallel\ntempering method in combination with hybrid Monte Carlo sampling of the\ncanonical ensemble of the discontinuous potential system. The probability of\nobserving the most common configuration is used to analyze the nature of the\nfree energy landscape, and it is found that the model with the least number of\npossible bonds exhibits a funnel-like free energy landscape at low enough\ntemperature for chains with fewer than 30 beads. For longer proteins, the\nlandscape consists of several minima, where the configuration with the lowest\nfree energy changes significantly by lowering the temperature and the\nprobability of observing the most common configuration never approaches one due\nto the degeneracy of the lowest accessible potential energy.\n","Comment: Added a discussion of a three state model as comparison, and an\n  example of the folded configuration. 13 pages, 14 figures"]}]

In\nparticular, they prove that for the pattern of zeros in $A$ to be retained in\nthe Cholesky decomposition of $A$, the pattern of zeros in $A$ has to\nnecessarily correspond to a chordal (or decomposable) graph associated with a\nspecific type of vertex ordering. This result therefore yields a\ncharacterization of chordal graphs in terms of sparse positive definite\nmatrices. It has also proved to be extremely useful in probabilistic and\nstatistical analysis of Markov random fields where zeros in positive definite\ncorrelation matrices are intimately related to the notion of stochastic\nindependence. Now, consider a positive definite matrix $A$ and its Cholesky\ndecomposition given by $A = LDL^T$, where $L$ is lower triangular with unit\ndiagonal entries, and $D$ a diagonal matrix with positive entries. In this\npaper, we prove that a necessary and sufficient condition for zeros (i.e.,\nsparsity) in a positive definite matrix $A$ to be preserved in its associated\nCholesky matrix $L$, \\, and in addition also preserved in the inverse of the\nCholesky matrix $L^{-1}$, is that the pattern of zeros corresponds to a\nco-chordal or homogeneous graph associated with a specific type of vertex\nordering. We proceed to provide a second characterization of this class of\ngraphs in terms of determinants of submatrices that correspond to cliques in\nthe graph. These results add to the growing body of literature in the field of\nsparse matrix decompositions, and also prove to be critical ingredients in the\nprobabilistic analysis of an important class of Markov random fields.\n"]}]

Data in many\napplications usually consist of users' implicit response that are often binary\n-- clicking an item or not; the goal is to predict click rates, which is often\ncombined with other measures to calculate utilities to rank items at runtime of\nthe recommender systems.

More specifically, we develop a\ncomprehensive classification scheme to delineate these organizations' use of\nFacebook as a stakeholder engagement tool. We find that there are 5 primary\ncategories of Facebook \"statuses\", which can be aggregated into three key\ndimensions - \"information\", \"community\", and \"action\". Our analysis reveals\nthat, though the \"informational\" use of Facebook is still significant,\nnonprofit organizations are better at using Facebook to strategically engage\ntheir stakeholders via \"dialogic\" and \"community-building\" practices than they\nhave been with traditional websites. The adoption of social media seems to have\nengendered new paradigms of public engagement.\n","Comment: Chinese-language article"]}]

In contrast to the linear\nbehavior for weak electric fields, the spin flip rate becomes much smaller than\nexpected for the two-level model and shows oscillating dependence on the\ndriving field amplitude in stronger fields. In addition, the full spin flip is\nvery difficult to achieve in a multi-level resonant system.

A coordinate space is a finite dimensional real vector space V\nwith a choice of dimV co-dimension one subspaces in general position.

The top homology of the chain complex agrees with the top\nhomology of the space and thus inherits an oriented matroid structure from the\ncoordinate space structure on the top chain groups.
