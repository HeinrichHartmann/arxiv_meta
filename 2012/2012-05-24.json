We relate the cycle-to-cycle variability of solar activity to\nfluctuations of solar dynamo drivers and primarily to fluctuations in the\nparameter responsible for recovery of the poloidal magnetic field from the\ntoroidal one. To be specific, we develop such a model in the framework of the\nmean-field dynamo based on the differential rotation and $\\alpha$-effect. We\ndemonstrate that the mean-field dynamo based on a realistic rotation curve and\nnonlinearity associated with the magnetic helicity balance reproduces both\nqualitatively and quantitatively the Waldmeier relations observed in sunspot\ndata since 1750 (SIDC data). The model also reproduces more or less\nsuccessfully other relations between the parameters under discussion, in\nparticular, the link between odd and even cycles (Gnevyshev-Ohl rule).

Herein, we analyze the possibility that this discrepancy originates\nfrom incorrect assumptions about the nuclear reaction cross sections relevant\nfor BBN. To do this, we introduce an efficient method to calculate the changes\nin the 7Li abundance produced by arbitrary (temperature dependent)\nmodifications of the nuclear reaction rates. Then, considering that 7Li is\nmainly produced from 7Be via the electron capture process 7Be + e -> 7Li +\nnu_e, we assess the impact of the various channels of 7Be destruction.\nDifferently from previous analysis, we consider the role of unknown resonances\nby using a complete formalism which takes into account the effect of Coulomb\nand centrifugal barrier penetration and that does not rely on the use of the\nnarrow-resonance approximation. As a result of this, the possibility of a\nnuclear physics solution to the 7Li problem is significantly suppressed. Given\nthe present experimental and theoretical constraints, it is unlikely that the\n7Be + n destruction rate is underestimated by the 2.5 factor required to solve\nthe problem. We exclude, moreover, that resonant destruction in the channels\n7Be + t and 7Be + 3He can explain the 7Li puzzle. New unknown resonances in 7Be\n+ d and 7Be + alpha could potentially produce significant effects. Recent\nexperimental results have ruled out such a possibility for 7Be+d. On the other\nhand, for the 7Be + alpha channel very favorable conditions are required. The\npossible existence of a partially suitable resonant level in 11C is studied in\nthe framework of a coupled-channel model and the possibility of a direct\nmeasurement is considered.\n","Comment: Final version, accepted for publication in JCAP"]}]

Less significant\nsystematic deviations are also observed in the semileptonic B to D(*) tau nu\nrates. Due to the rich spin structure of the final state, the decay mode B to\nD* tau nu offers a number of tests of such possible standard model deviations.\nWe investigate the most general set of lowest dimensional effective operators\nleading to helicity suppressed modifications of b to c (semi)leptonic\ntransitions.

An analysis of data\nrecorded by the ATLAS detector in 2010 in proton-proton collisions at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 7 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 33.4/pb is\nperformed, searching for supersymmetric final states containing jets and\nmissing transverse energy and no electrons or muons (zero-lepton channel). No\nexcess over the Standard Model background expectation is observed. Using the\nCLs and PLR methods, exclusion limits are set in two different supergravity\nmodels. These considerably extend the excluded parameter ranges from earlier\nexperiments.\n  The rates and efficiencies of triggers based on combined signatures with jets\nplus missing transverse energy in ATLAS are studied, which are the primary\ntriggers for the search for Supersymmetry in the zero-lepton channel. For the\nmeasurement of the efficiencies in data collected in 2010 and 2011, the\nbootstrap method is applied. Different sample triggers based on jets and\nmissing transverse energy are compared and their efficiencies are measured. A\nreweighting approach is used to correct for the bias from the propagation of\nthe uncertainties in the bootstrap method.\n  A universal model is developed to describe the contribution of fake missing\ntransverse energy from resolution effects to the rates of missing transverse\nenergy triggers as function of the level of in-time pile-up, i.e. the number of\nconcurrent proton-proton interactions. The input parameters are tuned to the\nproperties of the ATLAS trigger system, and the model predictions are compared\nto measurements of trigger rates in ATLAS. Good agreement is found for low\nthresholds for which the rates are dominated by resolution effects, whereas the\nrates for higher thresholds are underestimated due to additional sources of\nfake and real missing transverse energy, which are not incorporated in the\nmodel.\n","Comment: PhD thesis, 327 pages.

We find these mosquitoes flap their wings at\napproximately 850 Hz. We also generate body yaw, body pitch and wing deviation\nmeasurements with standard deviations of less than 1 degree and find that\nsideways velocity and acceleration are important components of mosquito motion.\nRapid turns involving changes in flight direction often involve large sideways\naccelerations. These do not correspond to commensurate changes in body heading,\nand the insect's flight direction and body heading are decoupled during flight.\nThese findings call in to question the role of yaw control in mosquito flight.\nIn addition, using orientation data, we find that sideways accelerations are\nwell explained by roll-based rotation of the lift vector. In contrast, the\ninsect's body pitch angle does not correlate with its forward acceleration.\nThis implies that controlling body roll is important to mosquito dynamics. The\ndynamic importance of stabilizing body pitch and body yaw is less clear.\n"]}]

We try to elucidate the phenomena\ncurrently observed in all types of galaxies, including AGNs and quasars, some\nof the most powerful objects in the universe. The interactions between the\nstellar system and the central black hole give rise to a lot of interesting\nphenomena. The scheme we employ enables a study of clean-cut aspects without\nany noise that particle methods suffer from. We study the most important\nphysical processes that are readily available in the evolution of a spherical\ncluster, like self-gravity, two-body relaxation etc, the interaction with a\ncentral black hole and the role of a mass spectrum. Not only embark we upon\nthis subject, but we set about an analysis on super-massive stars. How these\nstars could power the quasar activity by star accretion and energy flows is one\nof the questions that arises. We undertake other questions, such as the\nuncertain evolution of such an object and its interaction with the surrounding\nstellar system. This is of crucial importance in astrophysics, for these\nobjects could be regarded as super-massive black holes progenitors.\n","Comment: This work has been withdrawn because some chapters will be now\n  finally used for publications and there is no need for keeping them here too"]}]
