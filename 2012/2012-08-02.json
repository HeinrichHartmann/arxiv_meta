Proactive routing is suitable for a\nnetwork with a fixed topology. On the other hand, reactive routing is more\nsuitable for a set of mobile nodes where routes are created on demand and there\nis not much time to evaluate the worthiness of a route, the prime concern being\nreachability due to constantly changing node positions. Sensor networks route\nevents of interest from source(s) to destination(s) where appropriate actions\ncould be taken. However, with mobile sensor nodes, it is not only important to\nknow the events but the location of the nodes generating the events. Most\nsensor nodes are not equipped with expensive GPS or accurate RSSI computation\nhardware to aid localization. Keeping these in view, we propose a modified\nreactive routing algorithm, with added support for localization, to localize\nmobile sensor nodes on the basis of information received from fixed sensor\nnodes during mutual exchange of routing control packets. The accuracy of\nlocalization depends on the ratio of the number of fixed nodes to the number of\nmobile nodes and the topology of the fixed nodes. A typical application\nscenario would be a mix of mobile nodes and fixed nodes, where fixed nodes know\ntheir absolute location and the location of mobile nodes is derived from the\nfixed nodes, in step with the reactive routing protocol in action.

Exponential-family\nRandom Graph Models (ERGM) have shown themselves to be a useful class of models\nfor representing com- plex social phenomena. We generalize ERGM by also\nmodeling nodal attributes as random variates, thus creating a random model of\nthe full network, which we call Exponential-family Random Network Models\n(ERNM). We demonstrate how this framework allows a new formu- lation for\nlogistic regression in network data. We develop likelihood-based inference for\nthe model and an MCMC algorithm to implement it. This new model formulation is\nused to analyze a peer social network from the National Lon- gitudinal Study of\nAdolescent Health.

In a realistic spectrum trading market, the\nrequests from secondary users often specify the usage of a fixed spectrum\nfrequency band in a certain geographical region and require a duration time in\na fixed available time interval. Considering the selfish behaviors of secondary\nusers, it is imperative to design a truthful auction which matches the\navailable spectrums and requests of secondary users optimally. Unfortunately,\nexisting designs either do not consider spectrum heterogeneity or ignore the\ndifferences of required time among secondary users. In this paper, we address\nthis problem by investigating how to use auction mechanisms to allocate and\nprice spectrum resources so that the social efficiency can be maximized. We\nbegin by classifying the spectrums and requests from secondary users into\ndifferent local markets which ensures there is no interference between local\nmarkets, and then we can focus on the auction in a single local market.

Analyzing how tags are assigned by certain users to\ncertain items has important implications in helping users search for desired\ninformation. In this paper, we explore common analysis tasks and propose a dual\nmining framework for social tagging behavior mining. This framework is centered\naround two opposing measures, similarity and diversity, being applied to one or\nmore tagging components, and therefore enables a wide range of analysis\nscenarios such as characterizing similar users tagging diverse items with\nsimilar tags, or diverse users tagging similar items with diverse tags, etc. By\nadopting different concrete measures for similarity and diversity in the\nframework, we show that a wide range of concrete analysis problems can be\ndefined and they are NP-Complete in general. We design efficient algorithms for\nsolving many of those problems and demonstrate, through comprehensive\nexperiments over real data, that our algorithms significantly out-perform the\nexact brute-force approach without compromising analysis result quality.\n","Comment: VLDB2012"]}]

With large scale Monte Carlo\nsimulations, we give a rigorous continuum treatment to the geometry of the\nimpenetrable spheres and the spaces between them. To properly exploit finite\nsize scaling, we examine multiple systems of differing sizes, with suitable\naveraging over disorder, and extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit. An order\nparameter based on the statistical sampling of stochastically driven dynamical\nexcursions and amenable to finite size scaling analysis is defined, calculated\nfor various system sizes, and used to determine the critical volume fraction\nphi_{c} = 0.0317 +/- 0.0004 and the correlation length exponent nu = 0.92 +/-\n0.05.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures"]}]
