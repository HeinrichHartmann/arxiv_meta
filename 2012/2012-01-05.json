For either very low or very high temperatures, or\nlarge grain radii, results from the rate equation are similar to those from our\nnew approach. Our method is faster than the Monte Carlo approach, but slower\nthan the rate equation approach. [Conclusions] The hybrid moment equation\napproach with a cutoff and switch scheme is applicable to large gas-grain\nnetworks, and is accurate enough to be used for astrochemistry studies. The\nlayered structure of the grain mantle could also be incorporated into this\napproach, although a full implementation of the grain micro-physics appears to\nbe difficult.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 4 figures.

Calling spin-down the minority component and\nspin-up the majority component, the limit of small relative density $x=n\\ds\n/n\\us$ is usually considered as a gas of non interacting polarons. This allows\nto calculate, in the expansion of the total energy of the system in powers of\n$x$, the terms proportional to $x$ (corresponding to the binding energy of the\npolaron) and to $x^{5/3}$ (corresponding to the kinetic energy of the polaron\nFermi sea). We investigate in this paper terms physically due to an interaction\nbetween polarons and which are proportional to $x^2$ and $x^{7/3}$. We find\nthree such terms. A first one corresponds to the overlap between the clouds\ndressing two polarons. The two other ones are due to the modification of the\nsingle polaron binding energy caused by the non-zero density of polarons. The\nsecond term is due to the restriction of the polaron momentum by the Fermi sea\nformed by the other polarons. The last one results from the modification of the\nspin-up Fermi sea brought by the other polarons. The calculation of all these\nterms is made at the simplest level of a single particle-hole excitation. It is\nperformed for all the possible interaction strengths within the stability range\nof the polaron. At unitarity the last two terms give a fairly weak contribution\nwhile the first one is strong and leads to a marked disagreement with\nMonte-Carlo results. The possible origins of this discrepancy are discussed.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 5 figures"]}]

We extend this approach to an Accumulate-Compute and Forward\nprotocol which employs two phases: Multiple Access (MA) phase consisting of two\nchannel uses with independent messages in each channel use, and Broadcast (BC)\nphase having one channel use. Assuming that the two users transmit points from\nthe same 4-PSK constellation, every such network coding map that satisfies the\nexclusive law can be represented by a Latin Square with side 16, and\nconversely, this relationship can be used to get the network coding maps\nsatisfying the exclusive law.

For their assessment, as a rule short term\nconcentrations have to be determined instead of long term mean values. This is\nalso the case for the perception of odour. Regulatory dispersion models like\nAUSTAL2000 calculate long term mean concentration values (one-hour), but\nprovide no information on the fluctuation from this mean. The ratio between a\nshort term mean value (relevant for odour perception) and the long term mean\nvalue (calculated by the dispersion model), called the peak-to-mean value, is\nusually used to describe these fluctuations. In general, this ratio can be\ndefined in different ways. M\\\"uller et al. (2012), in a comment to Schauberger\net al.

Instead it calculates the frequency\nof so-called odour-hours by applying the relation between the 90-percentile of\nthe instantaneous concentration and the hourly mean (Janicke and Janicke,\n2007a), not between some peak value and the mean. According to Janicke and\nJanicke (2007a), the 90-percentile of the instantaneous concentration can in\npractice be estimated with sufficient accuracy from the hourly mean by using a\nfactor of 4.

Mathematically, these modalities require that we\nreconstruct a diffusion coefficient $\\sigma(x)$ for $x\\in X$, a bounded domain\nin $\\Rm^n$, from knowledge of $\\sigma(x)|\\nabla u|^2(x)$ for $x\\in X$, where\n$u$ is the solution to the elliptic equation $-\\nabla\\cdot\\sigma\\nabla u=0$ in\n$X$ with $u=f$ on $\\partial X$.\n  This inverse problem may be recast as a nonlinear equation, which formally\ntakes the form of a 0-Laplacian. Whereas $p-$Laplacians with $p>1$ are\nwell-studied variational elliptic non-linear equations, $p=1$ is a limiting\ncase with a convex but not strictly convex functional, and the case $p<1$\nadmits a variational formulation with a functional that is not convex. In this\npaper, we augment the equation for the 0-Laplacian with full Cauchy data at the\ndomain's boundary, which results in a, formally overdetermined, nonlinear\nhyperbolic equation.\n  The paper presents existence, uniqueness, and stability results for the\nCauchy problem of the 0-Laplacian. In general, the diffusion coefficient\n$\\sigma(x)$ can be stably reconstructed only on a subset of $X$ described as\nthe domain of influence of the space-like part of the boundary $\\partial X$ for\nan appropriate Lorentzian metric. Global reconstructions for specific\ngeometries or based on the construction of appropriate complex geometric optics\nsolutions are also analyzed.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 6 figures"]}]
