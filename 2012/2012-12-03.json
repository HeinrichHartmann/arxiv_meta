For a qualitative\nestimate, we model the body with a homogeneous sphere and express the tidal\nphase lag through the lag in a sample of material. Although simplistic, our\nmodel is sufficient to understand that the lags are not identical. The\ndifference emerges because self-gravitation pulls the tidal bulge down. At low\nfrequencies, this reduces strain and makes tidal damping less efficient in\nlarger bodies. At high frequencies, competition between self-gravitation and\nrheology becomes more complex, though for sufficiently large superearths the\nsame rule works: the larger the body, the weaker tidal damping in it. Being\nnegligible for small terrestrial planets and moons, the difference between the\nseismic and tidal lagging (and likewise between the seismic and tidal damping)\nbecomes very considerable for superearths. In those, it is much lower than what\none might expect from using a seismic quality factor. The tidal damping rate\ndeviates from the seismic damping rate especially in the zero-frequency limit,\nand this difference takes place for bodies of any size. So the equal in\nmagnitude but opposite in sign tidal torques, exerted on one another by the\nprimary and the secondary, go smoothly through zero as the secondary crosses\nthe synchronous orbit. We describe the mantle rheology with the Andrade model,\nallowing it to lean towards the Maxwell model at the lowest frequencies. To\nimplement this additional flexibility, we reformulate the Andrade model by\nendowing it with a free parameter which is the ratio of the anelastic timescale\nto the viscoelastic Maxwell time of the mantle.

Optical data from the Magellanic Cloud Emission Line\nSurvey (MCELS) and new radio data from the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis\nTelescope (MOST), in addition to the ROSAT X-ray data, were used to perform a\nmorphological analysis of this candidate SNR.

Mechanisms based on ion-cyclotron resonance have\nbeen successful in explaining a large number of observations, those concerning\nthe significant ion temperature anisotropy above coronal holes in particular.\nHowever, they suffer from the inconsistency with turbulence theory which says\nthat the turbulent cascade in a low-beta medium like the solar corona should\nproceed in the perpendicular rather than the parallel direction, meaning that\nthere is little energy in the ion gyro-frequency range for ions to absorb via\nion-cyclotron resonance. Recently a mechanism based on the interaction between\nthe solar wind particles and the anisotropic turbulence has been proposed,\nwhere the perpendicular proton energy addition is via the stochastic heating\n(Chandran et al. 2011). We extend this promising mechanism by properly\naccounting for the effect of proton temperature anisotropy on the propagation\nof Alfven waves, for the radiative losses of electron energy, and for the field\nline curvature that naturally accompanies solar winds in the corona.

On the other hand these tools\nallow one to work with different standards of metabolic models (OptGene and\nSBML) and the fact that they are programmed in Python opens the possibility of\nefficient integration with any other already existing Python tool.\n  Conclusions: PyNetMet is, therefore, a collection of computational tools that\nwill facilitate the research work with metabolic models and networks.\n","Comment: 1 Figure, 2 Tables"]}]

We consider debates of partial and zero\ninformation, where the prover is prevented from seeing some or all of the\nmessages of the refuter, as well as those of complete information. The classes\nof languages with debates checkable by verifiers operating under severe bounds\non the memory and randomness are studied.\n  We give full characterizations of versions of these classes corresponding to\nsimultaneous bounds of O(1) space and O(1) random bits, and of logarithmic\nspace and polynomial time. It turns out that constant-space verifiers, which\ncan only check complete-information debates for regular languages\ndeterministically, can check for membership in any language in P when allowed\nto use a constant number of random bits. Similar increases also occur for zero-\nand partial- information debates, from NSPACE(n) to PSPACE, and from E to\nEXPTIME, respectively. Adding logarithmic space to these constant-randomness\nverifiers does not change their power. When logspace debate checkers are\nrestricted to run in polynomial time without a bound on the number of random\nbits, the class of debatable languages equals PSPACE for all debate types.
