In this context we prove the Two-Grid method\noptimality. We apply this elementary strategy for designing a multigrid\nsolution for modifications of multilevel structured (Toeplitz, circulants,\nHartley, sine ($\\tau$ class) and cosine algebras) linear systems, in which the\ncoefficient matrix is banded in a multilevel sense and Hermitian positive\ndefinite. In such a way, several linear systems arising from the approximation\nof integro-differential equations with various boundary conditions can be\nefficiently solved in linear time (with respect to the size of the algebraic\nproblem).

Thus,\nin the continuum limit one can analyze the crystal properties using the\nformalism of quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions (QED2+1) which provides\nthe opportunity to verify the high energy physics phenomena in the condensed\nmatter system. We study the symmetry properties of 2+1-dimensional Dirac\nequation, both in the non-interacting case and in the case with constant\nuniform magnetic field included in the model. The maximal symmetry group of the\nmassless Dirac equation is considered by putting it in the Jordan block form\nand determining the algebra of operators leaving invariant the subspace of\nsolutions. It is shown that the resulting symmetry operators expressed in terms\nof Dirac matrices cannot be described exclusively in terms of gamma matrices\n(and their products) entering the corresponding Dirac equation. It is a\nconsequence of the reducibility of the considered representation in contrast to\nthe 3+1-dimensional case. Symmetry algebra is demonstrated to be a direct sum\nof two gl(2,C) algebras plus an eight-dimensional abelian ideal. Since the\nmatrix structure which determines the rotational symmetry has all required\nproperties of the spin algebra, the pseudospin related to the sublattices (M.\nMecklenburg and B. C. Regan, Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 116803 (2011)) gains the\ncharacter of the real angular momentum, although the degrees of freedom\nconnected with the electron's spin are not included in the model.

Heavy-Element Nucleosynthesis of s, r, p-Processes"],"description":["  We investigate the nucleosynthesis in a massive star of 70 M_solar with solar\nmetallicity in the main sequence stage. The helium core mass after hydrogen\nburning corresponds to 32 M_solar. Nucleosynthesis calculations have been\nperformed during the stellar evolution and the jetlike supernova explosion of a\ncollapsar model, where the weak s-, p-, and r-processes are taken into account.\nWe confirm that s-elements of 60 < A < 90 are highly overproduced relative to\nthe solar abundances in the hydrostatic nucleosynthesis. During oxygen burning,\np-elements of A > 90 are produced via photodisintegrations of seed s-elements.\nHowever, the produced p-elements are disintegrated in later stages except for\n^{180}Ta. In the explosive nucleosynthesis, elements of 90 < A < 160 are\nsignificantly overproduced relative to the solar values owing to the r-process.\nOnly heavy p-elements (N > 50) are overproduced via the p-process. Compared\nwith the previous study of r-process nucleosynthesis calculations in the\ncollapsar model of 40 M_solar by Fujimoto et al. 2007, 2008, our jet model\ncannot contribute to the third peak of the solar r-elements and intermediate\np-elements. Averaging the overproduction factors over the progenitor masses\nwith the use of Salpeter's IMF, we suggest that the 70 M_solar star could\ncontribute to the solar weak s-elements of 60 < A < 90 and neutron-rich\nelements of 90 < A < 160. We confirm the primary synthesis of light p-elements\nin the ejected matter of high peak temperature. The ejected matter has [Sr/Eu]\n\\sim -0.4, which is different from that of a typical r-process-enriched star\nCS22892-052 ([Sr/Eu] \\sim -1). We find that Sr-Y-Zr isotopes are primarily\nsynthesized in the explosive nucleosynthesis in a similar process of the\nprimary production of light p-elements, which has been considered as one of the\nsites of a lighter element primary process (LEPP).\n","Comment: 25 pages, 13 figures, 2 tables, accepted for publication in Progress\n  of Theoretical Physics"]}]
