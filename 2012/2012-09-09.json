The introduction of broadband wireless mobile\nad hoc networks (MANETs) and cellular networks together with increased\ncomputational power have opened the door for a new breed of applications to be\ncreated, namely real-time multimedia applications. Delivering real-time\nmultimedia traffic over a complex network like the Internet is a particularly\nchallenging task since these applications have strict quality-of-service (QoS)\nrequirements on bandwidth, delay, and delay jitter. Traditional Internet\nprotocol (IP)-based best effort service is not able to meet these stringent\nrequirements. The time-varying nature of wireless channels and resource\nconstrained wireless devices make the problem even more difficult. To improve\nperceived media quality by end users over wireless Internet, QoS supports can\nbe addressed in different layers, including application layer, transport layer\nand link layer. Cross layer design is a well-known approach to achieve this\nadaptation. In cross-layer design, the challenges from the physical wireless\nmedium and the QoS-demands from the applications are taken into account so that\nthe rate, power, and coding at the physical (PHY) layer can adapted to meet the\nrequirements of the applications given the current channel and network\nconditions. A number of propositions for cross-layer designs exist in the\nliterature. In this chapter, an extensive review has been made on these\ncross-layer architectures that combine the application-layer, transport layer\nand the link layer controls.
