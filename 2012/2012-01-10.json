For many groups however, there is no list of members from which\nto take a random sample. Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a relatively new\nsampling methodology that circumvents this difficulty by using the social\nnetworks of the groups under study. The RDS method has been shown to provide\nunbiased estimates of population proportions given certain conditions. The\nmethod is now widely used in the study of HIV-related high-risk populations\nglobally. In this paper, we test the RDS methodology by simulating RDS studies\non the social networks of a large LGBT web community. The robustness of the RDS\nmethod is tested by violating, one by one, the conditions under which the\nmethod provides unbiased estimates. Results reveal that the risk of bias is\nlarge if networks are directed, or respondents choose to invite persons based\non characteristics that are correlated with the study outcomes. If these two\nproblems are absent, the RDS method shows strong resistance to low response\nrates and certain errors in the participants' reporting of their network sizes.\nOther issues that might affect the RDS estimates, such as the method for\nchoosing initial participants, the maximum number of recruitments per\nparticipant, sampling with or without replacement and variations in network\nstructures, are also simulated and discussed.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 17 figures, 1 table"]}]

Lett. {\\bf 92}, 020404 (2004)] predicts\nthe finite transfer of momentum from the quantum vacuum to a fluid placed in\nstrong perpendicular electric and magnetic fields. The momentum transfer arises\nbecause of the optically anisotropic magnetoelectric response induced in the\nfluid by the fields. After summarising Feigel's original assumptions and\nderivation (corrected of trivial mistakes), we rederive the same result by a\nsimpler route, validating Feigel's semi-classical approach. We then derive the\nstress exerted by the vacuum on the fluid which, if the Feigel hypothesis is\ncorrect, should induce a Poiseuille flow in a tube with maximum speed $\\approx\n100\\mu$m/s (2000 times larger than Feigel's original prediction). An experiment\nis suggested to test this prediction for an organometallic fluid in a tube\npassing through the bore of a high strength magnet. The predicted flow can be\nmeasured directly by tracking microscopy or indirectly by measuring the flow\nrate ($\\approx 1$ml/min) corresponding to the Poiseuille flow. A second\nexperiment is also proposed whereby a `vacuum radiometer' is used to test a\nrecent prediction that the net force on a magnetoelectric slab in the vacuum\nshould be zero.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 1 figures. revised and improved version"]}]

The simplest explanation of such excess involves a\n\"new\" population of unresolved sources which become the most numerous at very\nlow (observationally unreached) brightness. We investigate this scenario in\nterms of synchrotron radiation induced by WIMP annihilations or decays in\nextragalactic halos. Intriguingly, for light-mass WIMPs with thermal\nannihilation cross-section, and fairly conservative clustering assumptions, the\nlevel of expected radio emission matches the ARCADE observations.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures. v2: one benchmark model added, comments and\n  references expanded, to appear in PRL"]}]

Besides, the sensitive dependence on\ninitial condition (SDIC) of Lorenz chaos has never been considered together\nwith the so-called continuum-assumption of fluid (on which Lorenz equations are\nbased), from physical and statistic viewpoints. A very fine numerical technique\n(Liao, 2009) with negligible truncation and round-off errors, called here the\n\"clean numerical simulation\" (CNS), is applied to investigate the propagation\nof the micro-level unavoidable uncertain fluctuation (caused by the\ncontinuum-assumption of fluid) of initial conditions for Lorenz equation with\nchaotic solutions. Our statistic analysis based on CNS computation of 10,000\nsamples shows that, due to the SDIC, the uncertainty of the micro-level\nstatistic fluctuation of initial conditions transfers into the macroscopic\nrandomness of chaos. This suggests that chaos might be a bridge from\nmicro-level uncertainty to macroscopic randomness, and thus would be an origin\nof macroscopic randomness. We reveal in this article that, due to the SDIC of\nchaos and the inherent uncertainty of initial data, accurate long-term\nprediction of chaotic solution is not only impossible in mathematics but also\nhas no physical meanings. This might provide us a new, different viewpoint to\ndeepen and enrich our understandings about the SDIC of chaos.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 2 figures"]}]

In the paper, we investigate the relation\nbetween the singlet-to-octet thermal break-up and the so-called\ngluo-dissociation, a mechanism for quarkonium dissociation widely used in\nphenomenological approaches.

In the concordance model of\ncosmology, these contradictions are removed or alleviated by the introduction\nof three completely independent new components of stress-energy -- the\ninflaton, dark matter, and dark energy. Each of these in its turn is meant to\nhave (or to currently) dominate the dynamics of the universe.

Because they must address the\nmost different types of data, attempts to replace dark matter with modified\ngravity are the most controversial. A phenomenological model (or family of\nmodels), Modified Newtonian Dynamics, has, over the last few years seen several\ncovariant realizations. We discuss a number of challenges that any model that\nseeks to replace dark matter with modified gravity must face: the loss of\nBirkhoff's Theorem, and the calculational simplifications it implies; the\nfailure to explain clusters, whether static or interacting, and the consequent\nneed to introduce dark matter of some form, whether hot dark matter neutrinos,\nor dark fields that arise in new sectors of the modified gravity theory; the\nintrusion of cosmological expansion into the modified force law, that arises\nprecisely because of the coincidence in scale between the centripetal\nacceleration at which Newtonian gravity fails in galaxies, and the cosmic\nacceleration. We conclude with the observation that, although modified gravity\nmay indeed manage to replace dark matter, it is likely to do so by becoming or\nincorporating, a dark matter theory itself.\n","Comment: A talk given at the Royal Society Discussion Session \"Gravity,\"\n  Chicheley Hall, UK Feb. 2011"]}]

As a remarkable consequence,\nbased on axiomatic formulation of classical statistical mechanics, the\ncovariant kinetic theory for systems of charged particles subject to the EM RR\nself-force is formulated in Hamiltonian form. A fundamental feature is that the\nnon-local effects enter the kinetic equation only through the retarded particle\n4-position, which permits the construction of the related non-local fluid\nequations. In particular, the moment equations obtained in this way do not\ncontain higher-order moments, allowing as a consequence the adoption of\nstandard closure conditions.
