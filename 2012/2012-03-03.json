The advantage of this\nmethod is that it allows a systematic iterative analysis and clarifies the\ndependence on lens and source parameters. In concordance with the multi-plane\nlensed-image counting theorem that the lower bound on the image number is $2^N$\nfor N planes with a single point mass on each plane, our iterative results show\nhow $2^N$ images are realized. Numerical tests are done to investigate if the\nTaylor expansion method is robust. The method with a small mass ratio works\nwell for changing a plane separation, whereas it breaks down in the inner\ndomain near the caustics.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 2 figures; adding a section about numerical tests; accepted\n  by Progress of Theoretical Physics (PTP)"]}]

The TD was\npredicted long ago as a composite pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB)\nassociated with the spontaneous breaking of the approximate scale symmetry in\nthe walking technicolor (WTC). Being pNGB, whose mass arises from the explicit\nscale-symmetry breaking due to the dynamical mass generation, the TD should\nhave a mass MTD lighter than other techni-hadrons, say MTD \\simeq 600GeV for\nthe typical WTC model, which is well in the discovery range of the ongoing LHC\nexperiment. We develop a spurion method of nonlinear realization to calculate\nthe TD couplings to the standard model (SM) particles and explicitly evaluate\nthe TD LHC production cross sections at sqrt{s}=7TeV times the branching ratios\nin terms of MTD as an input parameter for 200GeV<MTD<1TeV in the typical WTC\nmodels: one-doublet model (1DM) and one-family model (1FM). It turns out that\nthe TD signatures are quite different from those of the SM Higgs. We compare\nthe TD->WW/ZZ signature with the recent ATLAS and CMS bounds and find that in\nthe case of 1DM the signature is consistent over the whole mass range due to\nthe large suppression of TD couplings, and by the same token the signal is too\ntiny for the TD to be visible through this channel at LHC. As for the 1FM, on\nthe other hand, a severe constraint is given on MTD to exclude the TD with\nMTD<600GeV, which, however, would imply an emergence of somewhat dramatic\nexcess as the TD signature at MTD>600GeV in the near future. We further find a\ncharacteristic signature coming from the gamma gamma mode in the 1FM. In sharp\ncontrast to the SM Higgs case, it provides highly enhanced cross\nsection~0.10--1.0fb at around MTD \\simeq 600GeV, which is large enough to be\ndiscovered during the first few year's run at LHC.\n","Comment: latex, 14 pages, 5 eps figure files; version to appear in PTP"]}]

The condition to\nget a factorized ground state is investigated for non-frustrated spin models in\nthe presence of a uniform and a staggered magnetic field. According to the\nlattice model structure we have categorized the spin models in two different\nclasses and obtained their factorization conditions. The first class contains\nmodels in which their lattice structures do not provide a single uniform\nmagnetic field to suppress the quantum correlations. Some of these models may\nhave a factorized ground state in the presence of a uniform and a staggered\nmagnetic field.
