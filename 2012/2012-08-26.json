In this approach, for a given exercise, each student receives the\nsame problem, but with different data. The exercise content can be static or\ndynamic, and the dynamic form can be timeless or real-time. The implementation\nprovides immediate feedback to the students, letting them know if their\nsubmitted answers are correct. Student results for each exercise are recorded\nin log files which are available to the instructor. Example exercises from\nengineering computer security and cryptography courses are presented.\n","Comment: Mid-Atlantic ASEE Conference, October 15-16, 2010, Villanova\n  University"]}]
