In the solid state, a well-known case is an impurity\ncoupled to a bosonic bath, for example lattice vibrations. Here the impurity\ntogether with its accompanying lattice distortion form a new entity, a polaron.\nThis quasiparticle plays an important role in the spectral function of high-Tc\nsuperconductors as well as in colossal-magnetoresistance in manganites. For\nimpurities in a fermionic bath, the attention so far has been mostly on heavy\nor immobile impurities which exhibit Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe and\nthe Kondo effect. Only recently, mobile impurities have moved into the focus of\nresearch and they have been found to form new quasiparticles, so called Fermi\npolarons. The Fermi polaron problem constitutes the extreme, but conceptually\nsimple, limit of two important quantum many-body problems: the BEC-BCS\ncrossover with spin-imbalance for attractive interactions and Stoner's\nitinerant ferromagnetism for repulsive interactions. It has been proposed that\nthis and other yet elusive exotic quantum phases might become realizable in\nFermi gases confined to two dimensions. Their stability and observability is\nintimately related to the theoretically debated properties of the Fermi polaron\nin two dimensional Fermi gas. Here we create and investigate these Fermi\npolarons and measure their spectral function using momentum-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy. For attractive interactions we find evidence for\nthe disputed pairing transition between polarons and tightly bound dimers,\nwhich provides insight into the elementary pairing mechanism of imbalanced,\nstrongly-coupled two-dimensional Fermi gases. Additionally, for repulsive\ninteractions we study novel quasiparticles, repulsive polarons, whose lifetime\ndetermine the possibility of stabilizing repulsively interacting Fermi systems.\n"]}]

Despite the\nhuge literature on Bell inequalities, it is not easy to find a clear conceptual\nanswer to what a Bell inequality is, or a clear guiding principle as to how\nthey may be derived. In this paper, we introduce a notion of logical Bell\ninequality which can be used to systematically derive testable inequalities for\na very wide variety of situations. There is a single clear conceptual\nprinciple, based on purely logical consistency conditions, which underlies our\nnotion of logical Bell inequalities. We show that in a precise sense, all Bell\ninequalities can be taken to be of this form. Our approach is very general. It\napplies directly to any family of sets of commuting observables. Thus it covers\nnot only the n-partite scenarios to which Bell inequalities are standardly\napplied, but also Kochen-Specker configurations, and many other examples. There\nis much current work on experimental tests for contextuality. Our approach\ndirectly yields, in a systematic fashion, testable inequalities for a very\ngeneral notion of contextuality.\n  There has been much work on obtaining proofs of Bell's theorem `without\ninequalities' or `without probabilities'. These proofs are seen as being in a\nsense more definitive and logically robust than the inequality-based proofs. On\nthe hand, they lack the fault-tolerant aspect of inequalities. Our approach\nreconciles these aspects, and in fact shows how the logical robustness can be\nconverted into systematic, general derivations of inequalities with provable\nviolations. Moreover, the kind of strong non-locality or contextuality\nexhibited by the GHZ argument or by Kochen-Specker configurations can be shown\nto lead to maximal violations of the corresponding logical Bell inequalities.\n","Comment: 12 pages"]}]

The\nanalysis lends insights into some recent interpretations of chiroptical\nexperiments, in which this measure, and an associated chirality flux, have been\ntreated as representing physically distinctive \"superchiral\" phenomena. In the\nfully quantized formalism the chirality density is promoted to operator status,\nwhose exploration with reference to an arbitrary polarization basis reveals\nrelationships to optical angular momentum and helicity operators. Analyzing\nmulti-mode beams with complex wave-front structures, notably Laguerre-Gaussian\nmodes, affords a deeper understanding of the interplay between optical\nchirality and optical angular momentum. By developing theory with due\ncognizance of the photonic character of light, it emerges that only the spin\nangular momentum of light is engaged in such observations. Furthermore, it is\nshown that these prominent measures of the helicity of chiral electromagnetic\nradiation have a common basis, in differences between the populations of\noptical modes associated with angular momenta of opposite sign. Using a\ncalculation of the rate of circular dichroism as an example, with coherent\nstates to model the electromagnetic field, it is discovered that two terms\ncontribute to the differential effect. The primary contribution relates to the\ndifference in left- and right- handed photon populations; the only other\ncontribution, which displays a sinusoidal distance-dependence, corresponding to\nthe claim of nodal enhancements, is connected with the quantum photon\nnumber-phase uncertainty relation.

One of the principal reasons for the\nimportance of PSWFs is that they are a natural and efficient tool for computing\nwith bandlimited functions, that frequently occur in the abovementioned areas.\nThis is due to the fact that PSWFs are the eigenfunctions of the integral\noperator, that represents timelimiting followed by lowpassing.\n  Needless to say, the behavior of this operator is governed by the decay rate\nof its eigenvalues. Therefore, investigation of this decay rate plays a crucial\nrole in the related theory and applications - for example, in construction of\nquadratures, interpolation, filter design, etc.\n  The significance of PSWFs and, in particular, of the decay rate of the\neigenvalues of the associated integral operator, was realized at least half a\ncentury ago. Nevertheless, perhaps surprisingly, despite vast numerical\nexperience and existence of several asymptotic expansions, a non-trivial\nexplicit upper bound on the magnitude of the eigenvalues has been missing for\ndecades.\n  The principal goal of this paper is to close this gap in the theory of PSWFs.\nWe analyze the integral operator associated with PSWFs, to derive fairly tight\nnon-asymptotic upper bounds on the magnitude of its eigenvalues. Our results\nare illustrated via several numerical experiments.\n","Comment: 42 pages, 8 figures. Also available at\n  http://www.cs.yale.edu/publications/techreports/tr1450.pdf"]}]
