The large dynamical range in physical conditions\nin accretion disks makes it challenging to address this problem only with\nnumerical simulations. We analyze the concept that (secondary) parasitic\ninstabilities are responsible for the saturation of the MRI. Our approach\nenables us to explore dissipative regimes that are relevant to astrophysical\nand laboratory conditions that lie beyond the regime accessible to current\nnumerical simulations. We calculate the spectrum and physical structure of\nparasitic modes that feed off the fastest, exact (primary) MRI mode when its\namplitude is such that the fastest parasitic mode grows as fast as the MRI.

Rapid biosensors have already made a\ndramatic impact on improving patient outcomes and with continued development,\nthese technologies may also help limit the emergence of antimicrobial\nresistance and reduce the ever expanding risk of foodborne illnesses. One\ntechnology that is being developed with these goals in mind is asynchronous\nmagnetic bead rotation (AMBR) biosensors. Self-assembled AMBR biosensors have\nbeen demonstrated at water/air and water/oil interfaces, and here, for the\nfirst time, we report on self-assembled AMBR biosensors used at a solid\ninterface. The solid interface configuration was used to measure the growth of\nEscherichia coli with two distinct phenomena at low cell concentrations:\nfirstly, the AMBR rotational period decreased and secondly, the rotational\nperiod increased after several division times. Taking advantage of this low\ncell concentration behavior, a 20% signal change from the growth of E. coli\nO157:H7 was detected in 91 \\pm 4 minutes, with a starting concentration of 5 x\n103 CFU/mL. Such a rapid cell growth sensor could dramatically improve the\ndetection time and sensitivity in applications requiring phenotypic testing of\ntarget cells.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 3 figures and supplementary data included"]}]

They all based\ntheir biographies on primary sources, archival material: memories and letters\nof people who were in contact with Einstein, Einstein's own recollections;\ninterviews that Einstein had given over the years, and letters of Einstein to\nhis friends - youth friends like Marcel Grossman and Michele Besso and later\nfriends and colleagues like Heinrich Zangger; and especially his love letters\nwith Mileva Mari\\'c. One can demarcate between two types of biographies,\nnamely, Documentary biographies, and, Non-documentary biographies.\nNon-documentary biographies were written by people who based themselves on\ndocumentary biographies and on other non-documentary biographies. Documentary\nbiographies were written by people who knew Einstein personally, and received\ninformation from him and from other people who were in personal contact with\nhim. This type can be further divided into two subgroups: books that were\nwritten while Einstein was still alive, and books that were written after his\ndeath. Among the first group there were some biographies that Einstein\nconsidered to be more reliable, others he thought were less reliable, and still\nother biographies which he considered to be almost pure imagination. I will\ndemonstrate that relying on primary sources and \"documentary\" does not\nnecessarily mean \"reliable\".\n"]}]
