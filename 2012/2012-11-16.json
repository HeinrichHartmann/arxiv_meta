At present, groups contain most of the galaxies and a significant\nfraction of the overall baryon content of the universe. To explore the effects\nof BH feedback on groups, we analyse two high resolution cosmological hydro\nsimulations from the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations project. While both\ninclude galactic winds driven by supernovae, only one includes feedback from\nBHs. We compare the properties of the simulated groups to a wide range of\nobservational data, including hot gas radial profiles and gas mass fractions\n(fgas), luminosity-mass-temperature (L-M-T) scaling relations, K-band\nluminosity of the group and its central brightest galaxy (CBG), SFRs and ages\nof the CBG, and gas/stellar metallicities. Both runs yield entropy profiles\nsimilar to the data, while the run without AGN feedback yields highly peaked\ntemperature profiles, in discord with the observations. Energy input from BHs\nsignificantly reduces fgas for groups with masses less than ~10^14 Msun,\nyielding fgas-T and L-T relations that are in agreement with the data. The run\nwithout AGN feedback suffers from the well known overcooling problem; the\nresulting K-band luminosities are much larger than observed.

Frequency\n  jumps, intermediate term and spot formation"],"description":["  Sheared incompressible flows are usually considered non-dispersive media. As\na consequence, the frequency evolution in transients has received much less\nattention than the wave energy density or growth factor. By carrying out a\nlarge number of long term transient simulations for longitudinal, oblique and\northogonal perturbations in the plane channel and wake flows, we could observe\na complex time evolution of the frequency. The complexity is mainly associated\nto jumps which appear quite far along within the transients. We interpret these\njumps as the transition between the early transient and the beginning of an\nintermediate term that reveals itself for times large enough for the influence\nof the fine details of the initial condition to disappear. The intermediate\nterm leads to the asymptotic exponential state and has a duration one order of\nmagnitude longer than the early term, which indicates the existence of an\nintermediate asymptotics. Since after the intermediate term perturbations die\nout or blowup, the mid-term can be considered as the most probable state in the\nperturbation life. Long structured transients can be related to the spot\npatterns commonly observed in subcritical transitional wall flows. By\nconsidering a large group of 3D waves in a narrow range of wavenumbers, we\nsuperposed them in a finite temporal window with oblique and longitudinal waves\nrandomly delayed with respect to an orthogonal wave which is supposed to\nsustain the spot formation with its intense transient growth. We show that in\nthis way it is possible to recover the linear initial evolution of the pattern\ncharacterized by the presence of longitudinal streaks. We also determined the\nasymptotic frequency and phase speed wavenumber spectra for the channel and\nwake flows. The mild dispersion observed can in part explain the different\npropagation speeds of the backward and forward fronts of the spot.\n","Comment: In revision for New Journal of Physics, November 2012"]}]

Font et\nal. have recently demonstrated that these simulations are able to successfully\nreproduce the satellite luminosity functions and the metallicity and surface\nbrightness profiles of the spheroids of the Milky Way and M31. A key to the\nsuccess of the simulations is a significant contribution to the spheroid from\nstars that formed in situ. While the outer halo is dominated by accreted stars,\nstars formed in the main progenitor of the galaxy dominate at r < ~30 kpc. In\nthe present study we show that this component was primarily formed in a\nproto-disc at high redshift and was subsequently liberated from the disc by\ndynamical heating associated with mass accretion. As a consequence of its\norigin, the in situ component of the spheroid has different kinematics (namely\nnet prograde rotation with respect to the disc) than that of the spheroid\ncomponent built from the disruption of satellites. In addition, the in situ\ncomponent has a flattened distribution, that is due in part to its rotation. We\nmake comparisons with measurements of the shape and kinematics of local\ngalaxies, including the Milky Way and M31, and stacked observations of more\ndistant galaxies. We find that the simulated disc galaxies have spheroids of\nthe correct shape (oblate with a median axis ratio of ~0.6 at radii of < ~30\nkpc, but note there is significant system-to-system scatter in this quantity)\nand that the kinematics show evidence for two components (due to in situ vs.\naccreted), as observed.

The SHO-FA algorithm is the first to\nsimultaneously have the following properties: (a) it requires only O(k)\nmeasurements, (b) the bit-precision of each measurement and each arithmetic\noperation is O (log(n) + P) (here 2^{-P} is the desired relative error in the\nreconstruction of x), (c) the decoding complexity is O(k) arithmetic operations\nand encoding complexity is O(n) arithmetic operations, and (d) if the\nreconstruction goal is simply to recover a single component of x instead of all\nof x, with significant probability over A this can be done in constant time.\nAll constants above are independent of all problem parameters other than the\ndesired success probability.

One of the key challenges in sequence\ntransduction is learning to represent both the input and output sequences in a\nway that is invariant to sequential distortions such as shrinking, stretching\nand translating. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a powerful sequence\nlearning architecture that has proven capable of learning such representations.\nHowever RNNs traditionally require a pre-defined alignment between the input\nand output sequences to perform transduction. This is a severe limitation since\n\\emph{finding} the alignment is the most difficult aspect of many sequence\ntransduction problems.
