Taking all the AGN indicators\ntogether, the AGN detection rate in the individual nuclei of LIRGs is ~62%. The\nderived AGN bolometric luminosities are in the range L_bol(AGN)=0.4 -50x10^{43}\nerg/s. The AGN bolometric contribution to the IR luminosities of the galaxies\nis generally small, with 70% of LIRGs having L_bol(AGN)/L_IR<0.05. Only ~8% of\nlocal LIRGs have a significant AGN bolometric contribution L_bol(AGN)/L_IR >\n0.25. From the comparison of our results with literature results of\nultraluminous infrared galaxies, we confirm that in the local universe the AGN\nbolometric contribution to the IR luminosity increases with the IR luminosity\nof the galaxy/system. If we add up the AGN bolometric luminosities we find that\nAGNs only account for 5%^{+8%}_{-3%} of the total IR luminosity produced by\nlocal LIRGs (with and without AGN detections). This proves that the bulk of the\nIR luminosity of local LIRGs is due to star formation activity.

A correlation of energetic gamma radiation with enhanced\ninterstellar ionization can thus support the hadronic origin of the gamma rays\nand constrain the acceleration of ionizing CR in SNR. We propose a method to\ntest the hadronic origin of GeV gamma rays from SNR associated with a molecular\ncloud. We use observational gamma ray data for each of these SNR known,\nmodeling the observations to obtain the underlying proton spectrum assuming\nthat the gamma rays are produced by pion decay. Assuming that the acceleration\nmechanism does not only produce high energy protons, but also low energy\nprotons, this proton spectrum at the source is then used to calculate the\nionization rate of the molecular cloud. Ionized molecular hydrogen triggers a\nchemical network forming molecular ions. The relaxation of these ions results\nin characteristic line emission, which can be predicted. We show that the\nionization rate for at least two objects is more than an order of magnitude\nabove Galactic average for molecular clouds, hinting at an enhanced formation\nrate of molecular ions. There will be interesting opportunities to measure\ncrucial molecular ions in the infrared and submillimeter-wave parts of the\nspectrum.\n","Comment: published in Astronomy and Astrophysics, 13 pages, 19 figures"]}]

Indeed, it would rather choose to reject a\nforwarding request in order to save its energy. To overcome this problem, the\nnodes need to be motivated to cooperate. To this end, we propose a\nself-learning repeated game framework to enforce cooperation between the nodes\nof a network. This framework is inspired by the concept of \"The Weakest Link\"\nTV game. Each node has a utility function whose value depends on its\ncooperation in forwarding packets on a route as well as the cooperation of all\nthe nodes that form this same route. The more these nodes cooperate the higher\nis their utility value. This would establish a cooperative spirit within the\nnodes of the networks. All the nodes will then more or less equally participate\nto the forwarding tasks which would then eventually guarantee a more efficient\npackets forwarding from sources to respective destinations.

In an earlier Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108,\n080601 (2012)], we addressed the degeneracy question: What is the number of\nmicrostructures compatible with a specified correlation function?

Since the configuration\nspace of a reconstruction problem is a hypercube on which a Hamming distance is\ndefined, we can calculate analytically an energy profile corresponding to the\naverage energy of all microstructures at a given Hamming distance from a ground\nstate. The steepness of this profile is a measure of the roughness of the\nenergy landscape, which can be used as a proxy for ground-state degeneracy. The\nrelationship between roughness metric and ground-state degeneracy is calibrated\nusing a Monte Carlo algorithm for determining the degeneracy of a variety of\nmicrostructures, including hard disks and Poisson point processes as well as\nthose with known degeneracies (single disks of various sizes and a particular\ncrystalline microstructure).
