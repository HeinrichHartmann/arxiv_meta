As a result, Witten index vanishes and supersymmetry\nis broken at small k. In the effective BO Hamiltonian framework, fermion, gluon\nand ghost loops contribute on an equal footing.

Remarkably, however, it is possible to detect and\ncorrect errors without destroying coherence by using quantum error correcting\ncodes [1]. The simplest of these are the three-qubit codes, which map a\none-qubit state to an entangled three-qubit state and can correct any single\nphase-flip or bit-flip error of one of the three qubits, depending on the code\nused [2]. Here we demonstrate both codes in a superconducting circuit by\nencoding a quantum state as previously shown [3,4], inducing errors on all\nthree qubits with some probability, and decoding the error syndrome by\nreversing the encoding process. This syndrome is then used as the input to a\nthree-qubit gate which corrects the primary qubit if it was flipped. As the\ncode can recover from a single error on any qubit, the fidelity of this process\nshould decrease only quadratically with error probability. We implement the\ncorrecting three-qubit gate, known as a conditional-conditional NOT (CCNot) or\nToffoli gate, using an interaction with the third excited state of a single\nqubit, in 63 ns.

Charge ordering produces a doubling of\nthe unit cell along the c-axis with respect to the basic monoclinic CeCoAl type\nstructure. Below room temperature, a phase transition with very broad\nhysteresis has been observed in various bulk properties like electrical\nresistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat. The present x-ray\ndiffraction results show that at low temperatures the doubling of the CeCoAl\ntype structure is replaced by an ill-defined modulated ground state. In this\nstate, at least three different modulation periods compete, with the dominant\nmode close to a tripling of the basic cell. The transition is accompanied by a\nsignificant contraction of the c axis. XANES data suggest that the average Ce\nvalence remains constant, thus the observed c axis contraction is not due to\nany valence transition. We propose a qualitative structure model with modified\nstacking sequences of Ce3+ and Ce(4-x)+ layers in the various modulated phases.\nSurprisingly, far below 100 K the modulated state is sensitive to x-ray\nirradiation at photon fluxes available at a synchrotron. With photon fluxes of\norder 10E12/s, the modulated ground state can be destroyed on a timescale of\nminutes and the doubling of the CeCoAl cell observed at room temperature is\nrecovered. The final state is metastable at 10 K. Heating the sample above 60 K\nagain leads to a recovery of the modulated state.

The brightening was accompanied with a bluer color, presumably arising\nfrom increased accretion activity. Interestingly, the star also turned bluer in\nthe fading phase.
