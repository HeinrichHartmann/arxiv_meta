Using multi-band photometry from GROND and\nSwift/UVOT, photo-zs are derived for five GRBs for which spectroscopic\nredshifts are not available. We use UV/optical/NIR data and synthetic\nphotometry based on afterglow observations and theory to derive the photometric\nredshifts of GRBs and their accuracy. Taking into account the afterglow\nsynchrotron emission properties, we investigate the application of photometry\nto derive redshifts in a theoretical range between z~1 and z~12. The\nmeasurement of photo-zs for GRB afterglows provides a quick, robust and\nreliable determination of the distance scale to the burst, particularly in\nthose cases where spectroscopic observations in the optical/NIR range cannot be\nobtained. Given a sufficiently bright and mildly reddened afterglow, the\nrelative photo-z accuracy is better than 10% between z=1.5 and z~7 and better\nthan 5% between z=2 and z=6. We detail the approach on 5 sources without\nspectroscopic redshifts observed with UVOT on-board Swift and/or GROND.

Buyers and sellers in\nsuccessful markets carry out cooperative transactions even if they do not know\neach other in advance and a moral hazard exists. An indispensable component\nthat enables cooperation in such social dilemma situations is the reputation\nsystem. Under the reputation system, a buyer can avoid transacting with a\nseller with a bad reputation. A transaction in online marketplaces is better\nmodeled by the trust game than other social dilemma games, including the\ndonation game and the prisoner's dilemma. In addition, most individuals\nparticipate mostly as buyers or sellers; each individual does not play the two\nroles with equal probability. Although the reputation mechanism is known to be\nable to remove the moral hazard in games with asymmetric roles, competition\nbetween different strategies and population dynamics of such a game are not\nsufficiently understood. On the other hand, existing models of reputation-based\ncooperation, also known as indirect reciprocity, are based on the symmetric\ndonation game. We analyze the trust game with two fixed roles, where trustees\n(i.e., sellers) but not investors (i.e., buyers) possess reputation scores. We\nstudy the equilibria and the replicator dynamics of the game. We show that the\nreputation mechanism enables cooperation between unacquainted buyers and\nsellers under fairly generous conditions, even when such a cooperative\nequilibrium coexists with an asocial equilibrium in which buyers do not buy and\nsellers cheat. In addition, we show that not many buyers may care about the\nseller's reputation under cooperative equilibrium. Buyers' trusting behavior\nand sellers' reputation-driven cooperative behavior coevolve to alleviate the\nsocial dilemma.\n","Comment: 5 figures"]}]

Here, we present GRB afterglow and host observations for a sample of\nbursts that are exemplary of previously missed ones because of high visual\nextinction along the sight-line. This facilitates an investigation of the\nproperties, geometry and location of the absorbing dust of these\npoorly-explored host galaxies, and a comparison to hosts from\noptically-selected samples. The hosts of the dustiest afterglows are diverse in\ntheir properties, but on average redder, more luminous and massive than the\nhosts of optically-bright events. We hence probe a different galaxy population,\nsuggesting that previous host samples miss most of the massive,\nchemically-evolved and metal-rich members. This also indicates that the dust\nalong the sight-line is often related to host properties, and thus probably\nlocated in the diffuse ISM or interstellar clouds and not in the immediate GRB\nenvironment. Some of the hosts in our sample, are blue, young or of small\nstellar mass illustrating that even apparently non-extinguished galaxies\npossess very dusty sight-lines due to a patchy dust distribution. The presented\nobservations establish a population of luminous, massive and correspondingly\nchemically-evolved GRB hosts.

The adaptive\nlandscape has rich structures such as finite and infinite potential, real and\nimaginary fixed points. We give the formula about the single click time with\nfinite and infinite potential.

In\nhigh dimensional spaces, the estimated covariance matrix is ill-conditioned and\nits inversion is unstable or impossible. Using a parsimonious statistical\nmodel, namely the High Dimensional Discriminant Analysis model, the specific\nsignal and noise subspaces are estimated for each considered class making the\ninverse of the class specific covariance matrix explicit and stable, leading to\nthe definition of a parsimonious Mahalanobis kernel. A SVM based framework is\nused for selecting the hyperparameters of the parsimonious Mahalanobis kernel\nby optimizing the so-called radius-margin bound. Experimental results on three\nhigh dimensional data sets show that the proposed kernel is suitable for\nclassifying high dimensional data, providing better classification accuracies\nthan the conventional Gaussian kernel.\n"]}]

Each cache serves\nuser requests locally over a medium that incurs no additional costs (i.e. WiFi,\nhome LAN); if a request is not cached, it must be fetched from another cache or\na central server. In our model, each cache has a tiered back-haul internet\nconnection, with a usage cap (and fixed per-byte costs thereafter). Redirecting\nrequests intended for the central server to other caches with unused back-haul\ncapacity can bring down the network costs. Our goal is to develop a mechanism\nto optimally 1) place data into the caches and 2) route requests to caches to\nreduce the overall cost of content delivery.\n  We develop a multi-criteria approximation based on a LP rounding procedure\nthat with a small (constant factor) blow-up in storage and upload limits of\neach cache, gives a data placement that is within constant factor of the\noptimum. Further, to speed up the solution, we propose a technique to cluster\ncaches into groups, solve the data placement problem within a group, and\ncombine the results in the rounding phase to get the global solution.Based on\nextensive simulations, we show that our schemes perform very well in practice,\ngiving costs within $5--15$% to the optimal, and reducing the network load at a\ncentral server by as much as 55% with only a marginal blow up in the limits.\nAlso we demonstrate that our approach out-performs a non-cooperative caching\nmechanism by about 20%.\n"]}]

We describe in detail\nthe preconditioning algorithm, and we discuss parallel performance of NGMRES\nand Newton-Krylov methods using the PETSc library.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 4 figures.

However, far from being a\nbenign culinary herb, cilantro can be polarizing---many people love it while\nothers claim that it tastes or smells foul, often like soap or dirt. This soapy\nor pungent aroma is largely attributed to several aldehydes present in\ncilantro. Cilantro preference is suspected to have a genetic component, yet to\ndate nothing is known about specific mechanisms. Here we present the results of\na genome-wide association study among 14,604 participants of European ancestry\nwho reported whether cilantro tasted soapy, with replication in a distinct set\nof 11,851 participants who declared whether they liked cilantro. We find a\nsingle nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) significantly associated with soapy-taste\ndetection that is confirmed in the cilantro preference group.

Among these olfactory receptor genes\nis OR6A2, which has a high binding specificity for several of the aldehydes\nthat give cilantro its characteristic odor. We also estimate the heritability\nof cilantro soapy-taste detection in our cohort, showing that the heritability\ntagged by common SNPs is low, about 0.087. These results confirm that there is\na genetic component to cilantro taste perception and suggest that cilantro\ndislike may stem from genetic variants in olfactory receptors.
