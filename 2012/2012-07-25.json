Meanwhile, the Lyman alpha line luminosity function\nof LAE is known to decline from z=5.7 to 6.6 in the SDF. L* at z=6.6 is 40-60%\nof that at z=5.7. We also confirm that the number density of z=7 LAE is only\n17% of the density at z=6.6 comparing the latest SDF LAE samples. This series\nof significant decreases in LAE density with increasing redshift can be the\nresult of galaxy evolution during these epochs. However, using the UV continuum\nluminosity functions of LAEs, those of Lyman break galaxies, and a LAE\nevolution model based on the hierarchical clustering, we find that galaxy\nevolution alone cannot explain all the decrease in density. This extra density\ndeficit can be interpreted as the attenuation of the Lyman alpha photons from\nLAEs due to a rapid evolution of neutral hydrogen fraction during the ongoing\ncosmic reionization at z~6.6-7.\n","Comment: published in Astrophysical Journal"]}]

We propose the study of a generalized $RC$-time as a\ncharacteristic time scale. We apply the method to the interacting resonant\nlevel model and calculate the nonlinear adiabatic charge response to\ntime-dependent gate voltages, tunneling barriers and Coulomb interaction. The\ngeneralized $RC$-time is found to acquire a unique form in all cases, in\ncontrast to the capacitance and the charge relaxation resistance.

This method, which we\nrecently proposed and demonstrated, consists of driving two\ntransversely-coupled quantum bits (qubits) with a driving field that is\nresonant with one of the two qubits. For specific relative amplitudes and\nphases of the driving field felt by the two qubits, one of the two transitions\nin the degenerate pair is darkened, or in other words, becomes forbidden by\neffective selection rules. At these driving conditions, the evolution of the\ntwo-qubit state realizes a CNOT gate. The gate speed is found to be limited\nonly by the coupling energy J, which is the fundamental speed limit for any\nentangling gate. Numerical simulations show that at gate speeds corresponding\nto 0.48J and 0.07J, the gate fidelity is 99% and 99.99%, respectively, and\nincreases further for lower gate speeds. In addition, the effect of\nhigher-lying energy levels and weak anharmonicity is studied, as well as the\nscalability of the method to systems of multiple qubits. We conclude that in\nall these respects this method is competitive with existing schemes for\ncreating entanglement, with the added advantages of being applicable for qubits\noperating at fixed frequencies (either by design or for exploitation of\ncoherence sweet-spots) and having the simplicity of microwave-only operation.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 5 figures"]}]

In\nthis paper we prove that the zeta correlation function is time-independent at\none-loop level in single clock inflation. While many of the one-loop diagrams\nlead to a time-dependence when considered individually, the time-dependence\nbeautifully cancels out in the overall sum. We identify two subsets of diagrams\nthat cancel separately due to different physical reasons. The first\ncancellation is related to the change of the background cosmology due to the\nrenormalization of the stress tensor. It results in a cancellation between the\nnon-1PI diagrams and some of the diagrams made with quartic vertices. The\nsecond subset of diagrams that cancel is made up of cubic operators, plus the\nremaining quartic ones. We are able to write the sum of these diagrams as the\nintegral over a specific three-point function between two very short\nwavelengths and one very long one. We then apply the consistency condition for\nthis three-point function in the squeezed limit to show that the sum of these\ndiagrams cannot give rise to a time dependence. This second cancellation is\nthus a consequence of the fact that in single clock inflation the attractor\nnature of the solution implies that a long wavelength zeta perturbation is\nindistinguishable from a trivial rescaling of the background, and so results in\nno physical effect on short wavelength modes.\n","Comment: 47 pages, 7 figures; v2: JHEP published version, typos and minor\n  corrections"]}]

To enable MPT for mobile charging, this paper\nproposes a new network architecture that overlays an uplink cellular network\nwith randomly deployed PBs for powering mobiles, called a hybrid network. The\ndeployment of the hybrid network under an outage constraint on data links is\ninvestigated based on a stochastic-geometry model where single-antenna base\nstations (BSs) and PBs form independent homogeneous Poisson point processes\n(PPPs) and single-antenna mobiles are uniformly distributed in Voronoi cells\ngenerated by BSs. In this model, mobiles and PBs fix their transmission power\nat p and q, respectively; a PB either radiates isotropically, called isotropic\nMPT, or directs energy towards target mobiles by beamforming, called directed\nMPT. The model is applied to derive the tradeoffs between the network\nparameters including p, q, and the BS/PB densities under the outage constraint.\nFirst, consider the deployment of the cellular network. It is proved that the\noutage constraint is satisfied so long as the product the BS density decreases\nwith increasing p following a power law where the exponent is proportional to\nthe path-loss exponent. Next, consider the deployment of the hybrid network\nassuming infinite energy storage at mobiles. It is shown that for isotropic\nMPT, the product between q, the PB density, and the BS density raised to a\npower proportional to the path-loss exponent has to be above a given threshold\nso that PBs are sufficiently dense; for directed MPT, a similar result is\nobtained with the aforementioned product increased by the array gain. Last,\nsimilar results are derived for the case of mobiles having small energy\nstorage.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 8 figures"]}]

Our system exposes a general programmatic\nAPI to process and analyze the retrieved snapshots. We introduce DeltaGraph, a\nnovel, extensible, highly tunable, and distributed hierarchical index structure\nthat enables compactly recording the historical information, and that supports\nefficient retrieval of historical graph snapshots for single-site or parallel\nprocessing. Along with the original graph data, DeltaGraph can also maintain\nand index auxiliary information; this functionality can be used to extend the\nstructure to efficiently execute queries like subgraph pattern matching over\nhistorical data. We develop analytical models for both the storage space needed\nand the snapshot retrieval times to aid in choosing the right parameters for a\nspecific scenario. In addition, we present strategies for materializing\nportions of the historical graph state in memory to further speed up the\nretrieval process. Secondly, we present an in-memory graph data structure\ncalled GraphPool that can maintain hundreds of historical graph instances in\nmain memory in a non-redundant manner. We present a comprehensive experimental\nevaluation that illustrates the effectiveness of our proposed techniques at\nmanaging historical graph information.\n"]}]

Starting in 2008, increasing global food prices triggered a\nnew wave of violence that spread to the endemically poor southern region with\ndemands for government change and economic concessions. This violence shares\nits origins with many other food riots and the more recent Arab Spring. The\nloss of social order and the opportunities for terror organizations can be best\naddressed by directly eliminating the causes of violence. Inter-group violence\ncan be addressed by delineating within-country provinces for local autonomy of\nethnic and religious groups. The impact of food prices can be alleviated by\ndirect food price interventions, or by addressing the root causes of global\nfood price increases in US policies that have promoted conversion of corn to\nethanol and commodity speculation.

This analogy allows to establish group\nisomorphisms between the local gauge group SU(2), and the tensor product of the\ngroups of local Lorentz tetrad transformations, either on blade one or blade\ntwo. These theorems show explicitly that the local internal groups of\ntransformations are isomorphic to local spacetime groups of transformations.
