The problem\nconsists of an ordinary differential wave equation with periodic coefficients,\nwhich involves two free parameters $\\omega $ (the frequency) and $k$ (the\nwavenumber in the direction orthogonal to the axis of periodicity).

The CME's\n3D localisation, real shape and morphological evolution are presented. Due to\nits interaction with the ambient solar wind, the morphology of this CME changed\nsignificantly in the early phase of evolution. Two hours after its initiation,\nit was expanding almost self-similarly. CME's 3D localisation is quite helpful\nto link remote sensing observations to in situ measurements. The investigated\nCME was propagating to Venus with its flank just touching STEREO B. Its\ncorresponding ICME in the interplanetary space shows a possible signature of a\nmagnetic cloud with a preceding shock in VEX observations, while from STEREO B\nonly a shock is observed. We have calculated three principle axes for the\nreconstructed 3D CME cloud.

It was\nobserved by Koike-Akino et al. that adaptively changing the network coding map\nused at the relay according to the channel conditions greatly reduces the\nimpact of multiple access interference which occurs at the relay during the MA\nPhase and all these network coding maps should satisfy a requirement called the\nexclusive law. Only the scenario in which the end nodes use M-PSK signal sets\nis extensively studied in \\cite{NVR} using Latin Sqaures. In this paper, we\naddress the case in which the end nodes use M-QAM signal sets (where M is of\nthe form $2^{2\\lambda}$, $\\lambda$ being any positive integer). In a fading\nscenario, for certain channel conditions $\\gamma e^{j \\theta}$, termed singular\nfade states, the MA phase performance is greatly reduced. We show that the\nsquare QAM signal sets give lesser number of singular fade states compared to\nPSK signal sets. Because of this, the complexity at the relay is enormously\nreduced. Moreover, lesser number of overhead bits are required in the BC phase.\nThe fade state $\\gamma e^{j \\theta}=1$ is singular for all constellations of\narbitrary size including PSK and QAM. For arbitrary PSK constellation it is\nwell known that the Latin Square obtained by bit-wise XOR mapping removes this\nsingularity.

In fact, Cloud Computing is an attractive and cost-saving\nservice for buyers as it provides accessibility and reliability options for\nusers and scalable sales for providers. In spite of being attractive, Cloud\nfeature poses various new security threats and challenges when it comes to\ndeploying Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in Cloud environments. Most\nIntrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are designed to handle specific types of\nattacks. It is evident that no single technique can guarantee protection\nagainst future attacks. Hence, there is a need for an integrated scheme which\ncan provide robust protection against a complete spectrum of threats. On the\nother hand, there is great need for technology that enables the network and its\nhosts to defend themselves with some level of intelligence in order to\naccurately identify and block malicious traffic and activities. In this case,\nit is called Intrusion prevention system (IPS). Therefore, in this paper, we\nemphasize on recent implementations of IDS on Cloud Computing environments in\nterms of security and privacy. We propose an effective and efficient model\ntermed as the Integrated Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) which\ncombines both IDS and IPS in a single mechanism. Our mechanism also integrates\ntwo techniques namely, Anomaly Detection (AD) and Signature Detection (SD) that\ncan work in cooperation to detect various numbers of attacks and stop them\nthrough the capability of IPS.\n","Comment: 18 pages.

We consider\na variety of masses for each star as well as for the initial orbital period\ncorresponding to systems that evolve to ultra-compact or millisecond\npulsar-helium white dwarf pairs. Specifically, we select a set of donor star\nmasses of 0.50, 0.65, 0.80, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2.00, 2.25, 2.50, 3.00, and\n3.50 solar masses, whereas for the accreting neutron star we consider initial\nmasses values of 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.4 solar masses. The considered initial\norbital period interval ranges from 0.5 to 12 days.\n  It is found that the evolution of systems, with fixed initial values for the\norbital period and the mass of the normal donor star, heavily depends upon the\nmass of the neutron star. In some cases, varying the initial value of the\nneutron star mass, we obtain evolved configurations ranging from ultra-compact\nto widely separated objects.\n  We also analyse the dependence of the final orbital period with the mass of\nthe white dwarf. In agreement with previous expectations, our calculations show\nthat the final orbital period-white dwarf mass relation is fairly insensitive\nto the initial neutron star mass value. A new period-mass relation based on our\nown calculations is proposed, which is in good agreement with period-mass\nrelations available in the literature.\n  As consequence of considering a set of values for the initial neutron star\nmass, these models allow finding different plausible initial configurations\n(donor and neutron star masses and orbital period interval) for some of the\nbest observed binary systems of the kind we are interested in here.
