The trajectories of the wave-fragments\nafter the collision represent a result of the computation, e.g. a simple\nlogical gate.

For specific spin eigenfunctions we calculate the delta to\nnucleon mass ratio to within one percent. Finally we derive parton distribution\nfunctions that compare well with those for the proton valence quarks. The\ndistributions are generated by projecting the proton state to space via the\nexterior derivative on u(3). We predict scarce neutral flavour singlets which\nshould be visible in neutron diffraction dissociation experiments or in\ninvariant mass spectra of protons and negative pions in B-decays and in\nphotoproduction on neutrons. The presence of such singlet states distinguishes\nexperimentally the present model from the standard model as does the prediction\nof the neutron to proton mass splitting.

The SSE generates a spin voltage as a result of a\ntemperature gradient in a ferromagnet, which injects a spin current into an\nattached paramagnetic metal. In the paramagnet, this spin current is converted\ninto an electric field due to the ISHE, enabling the electric detection of the\nSSE. The observation of the SSE is performed in longitudinal and transverse\nconfigurations consisting of a ferromagnet/paramagnet hybrid structure, where\nthermally generated spin currents flowing parallel and perpendicular to the\ntemperature gradient are detected, respectively. Our results explain the SSE in\nterms of a two-step process: (1) the temperature gradient creates a\nnon-equilibrium state in the ferromagnet governed by both magnon and phonon\npropagations and (2) the non-equilibrium between magnons in the ferromagnet and\nelectrons in the paramagnet at the contact interface leads to \"thermal spin\npumping\" and the ISHE signal.

We provide an exhaustive study of the challenges and open problems\nlinked to the truncation of such hierarchy of equations to make them\npractically applicable.

The most difficult step is to prove a uniform\nbound for the remainder in the Hilbert expansion.

We find a\ncoordinate transform and introduce a five dimensional space called the\nMaier-Saupe space such that the interactions between two parts can been seen\nexplicitly by a delicate argument of completing the square.
