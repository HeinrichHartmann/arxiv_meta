In the case where such models\ncan be efficiently simulated, Bayesian inference is still possible thanks to\nthe Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) algorithm. Although many refinements\nhave been suggested, ABC inference is still far from routine. ABC is often\nexcruciatingly slow due to very low acceptance rates. In addition, ABC requires\nintroducing a vector of \"summary statistics\", the choice of which is relatively\narbitrary, and often require some trial and error, making the whole process\nquite laborious for the user.\n  We introduce in this work the EP-ABC algorithm, which is an adaptation to the\nlikelihood-free context of the variational approximation algorithm known as\nExpectation Propagation (Minka, 2001). The main advantage of EP-ABC is that it\nis faster by a few orders of magnitude than standard algorithms, while\nproducing an overall approximation error which is typically negligible. A\nsecond advantage of EP-ABC is that it replaces the usual global ABC constraint\non the vector of summary statistics computed on the whole dataset, by n local\nconstraints of the form that apply separately to each data-point. As a\nconsequence, it is often possible to do away with summary statistics entirely.\nIn that case, EP-ABC approximates directly the evidence (marginal likelihood)\nof the model.\n  Comparisons are performed in three real-world applications which are typical\nof likelihood-free inference, including one application in neuroscience which\nis novel, and possibly too challenging for standard ABC techniques.\n","Comment: Revised version following peer-review"]}]

We demonstrate the existence of such Friedel oscillations in a\n3d gravity dual to a compressible finite-density state in a (1+1) dimensional\nfield theory. The bulk dynamics is provided by a Maxwell U(1) gauge theory and\nall the charge is behind a bulk horizon. The bulk gauge theory is compact and\nso there exist magnetic monopole tunneling events. We compute the effect of\nthese monopoles on holographic density-density correlation functions and\ndemonstrate that they cause Friedel oscillations at a wavevector that directly\ncounts the charge behind the bulk horizon. If the magnetic monopoles are taken\nto saturate the bulk Dirac quantization condition then the observed Fermi\nmomentum exactly agrees with that predicted by Luttinger's theorem, suggesting\nsome Fermi surface structure associated with the charged horizon. The mechanism\nis generic and will apply to any charged horizon in three dimensions. Along the\nway we clarify some aspects of the holographic interpretation of Maxwell\nelectromagnetism in three bulk dimensions and show that perturbations about the\ncharged BTZ black hole exhibit a hydrodynamic sound mode at low temperature.\n","Comment: 59 pages, 5 figures"]}]

There is a\ngrowing acceptance in the high-Tc community that the mediating bosons leading\nto Cooper pairing have largely electronic character.

The experimentally observed\nsubstantially large IE over certain doping range always casts a shadow over any\nproposal where non-phononic mechanism is invoked. Besides, the various existing\ntheoretical schemes, based on electron-phonon interactions, cannot describe the\nanomalous features shown by the IE as a function of hole\nconcentration/disorder, either quantitatively or qualitatively. Based on a\nrecent experiment relating the possibility of Fermi-surface reconstruction to\nthe thermoelectric transport measurements (Nature Commun. 2:432 doi:\n10.1038/ncomms1440 (2011)), we propose here a simple scenario where isotope\nsubstitutions affect the charge/spin stripe state via the coupling to the\nunderlying lattice and thereby change the superconducting Tc.
