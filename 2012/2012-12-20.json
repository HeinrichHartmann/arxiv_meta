However, the amount of computation time required to perform\nUVCluster analyses imposed significant limitations to its use.\n  Methodology/Principal Findings: We describe the suite Jerarca, designed to\nefficiently convert networks of interacting units into dendrograms by means of\niterative hierarchical clustering. Jerarca is divided into three main sections.\nFirst, weighted distances among units are computed using up to three different\napproaches: a more efficient version of UVCluster and two new, related\nalgorithms called RCluster and SCluster. Second, Jerarca builds dendrograms\nbased on those distances, using well-known phylogenetic algorithms, such as\nUPGMA or Neighbor-Joining. Finally, Jerarca provides optimal partitions of the\ntrees using statistical criteria based on the distribution of intra- and\nintercluster connections.

The theory possesses extremely interesting\nfeatures such as predicting the existence of a long-range scalar field, that\nexplains the late-time cosmic acceleration and passes the local tests, even in\nthe presence of a light scalar field. In this brief report, we consider the\npossibility that wormholes are supported by this hybrid metric-Palatini\ngravitational theory. We present here the general conditions for wormhole\nsolutions according to the null energy conditions at the throat and find\nspecific examples. In the first solution, we specify the redshift function, the\nscalar field and choose the potential that simplifies the modified Klein-Gordon\nequation. This solution is not asymptotically flat and needs to be matched to a\nvacuum solution. In the second example, by adequately specifying the metric\nfunctions and choosing the scalar field, we find an asymptotically flat\nspacetime.\n","Comment: 4 pages.

This interference phenomenon slows down the adaptation speed and\nmakes the theoretical description of the dynamics more complex with respect to\nthe successional occurrence and fixation of beneficial mutations typical of\nsmall populations. A simplified modeling framework considering multiple\nbeneficial mutations with equal and constant fitness advantage captures some of\nthe essential features of the actual complex dynamics, and some key predictions\nfrom this model are verified in laboratory evolution experiments. However, in\nthese experiments the relative advantage of a beneficial mutation is generally\ndependent on the genetic background. In particular, the general pattern is\nthat, as mutations in different loci accumulate, the relative advantage of new\nmutations decreases, trend often referred to as \"diminishing return\" epistasis.\n  In this paper, we propose a phenomenological model that generalizes the\nfixed-advantage framework to include in a simple way this feature. To evaluate\nthe quantitative consequences of diminishing returns on the evolutionary\ndynamics, we approach the model analytically as well as with direct\nsimulations. Finally, we show how the model parameters can be matched with data\nfrom evolutionary experiments in order to infer the mean effect of epistasis\nand derive order-of-magnitude estimates of the rate of beneficial mutations.\nApplying this procedure to two experimental data sets gives values of the\nbeneficial mutation rate within the range of previous measurements.\n"]}]

Axis-ratio measurements for the ~400\nearly-type galaxies in the redshift range 0.6<z<1.8 are accurate to 0.1 or\nbetter. The projected axis-ratio distributions are then compared with lower\nredshift samples. We find strong evidence for evolution of the population\nproperties: early-type galaxies at z>1 are, on average, flatter than at z<1 and\nthe median projected axis ratio at a fixed mass decreases with redshift.\nHowever, we also find that at all epochs z<~2 the very most massive early-type\ngalaxies (log(M/M_sun)>11.3) are the roundest, with a pronounced lack among\nthem of galaxies that are flat in projection. Merging is a plausible mechanism\nthat can explain both results: at all epochs merging is required for early-type\ngalaxies to grow beyond log(M/M_sun)~11.3, and all early types over time\ngradually and partially loose their disk-like characteristics.\n","Comment: accepted for publication in ApJ; 11 pages; 10 figures; 4 tables"]}]

Part I:\n  Framework and Recipe"],"description":["  Numerical methods for hyperbolic conservation laws are needed that\nefficiently mimic the constraints satisfied by exact solutions, including\nmaterial conservation and positivity, while also maintaining high-order\naccuracy and numerical stability. Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and WENO schemes\nallow efficient high-order accuracy while maintaining conservation. Positivity\nlimiters developed by Zhang and Shu ensure a minimum time step for which\npositivity of cell average quantities is maintained without sacrificing\nconservation or formal accuracy; this is achieved by linearly damping the\ndeviation from the cell average just enough to enforce a cell positivity\ncondition that requires positivity at boundary nodes and strategically chosen\ninterior points.\n  We assume that the set of positive states is convex; it follows that\npositivity is equivalent to scalar positivity of a collection of affine\nfunctionals. Based on this observation, we generalize the method of Zhang and\nShu to a framework that we call outflow positivity limiting: First, enforce\npositivity at boundary nodes. If wave speed desingularization is needed, cap\nwave speeds at physically justified maxima by using remapped states to\ncalculate fluxes. Second, apply linear damping again to cap the boundary\naverage of all positivity functionals at the maximum possible (relative to the\ncell average) for a scalar-valued representation positive in each mesh cell.\nThis be done by enforcing positivity of the retentional, an affine combination\nof the cell average and the boundary average, in the same way that Zhang and\nShu would enforce positivity at a single point (and with similar computational\nexpense). Third, limit the time step so that cell outflow is less than the\ninitial cell content. This framework guarantees essentially the same\npositivity-preserving time step as is guaranteed if positivity is enforced at\nevery point in the mesh cell.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 15 figures"]}]
