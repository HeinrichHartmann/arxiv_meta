In this\napproach, an asset is defined by its cash-flow structure. The market is assumed\nto have access to \"partial\" information about future cash flows. Each cash flow\nis determined by a collection of independent market factors called X-factors.\nThe market filtration is generated by a set of information processes, each of\nwhich carries information about one of the X-factors, and eventually reveals\nthe X-factor. Each information process has two terms, one of which contains a\n\"signal\" about the associated X-factor, and the other of which represents\n\"market noise\". The price of an asset is given by the expectation of the\ndiscounted cash flows in the risk-neutral measure, conditional on the\ninformation provided by the market. When the market noise is modelled by a\nBrownian bridge one is able to construct explicit formulae for asset prices, as\nwell as semi-analytic expressions for the prices and greeks of options and\nderivatives. In particular, option price data can be used to determine the\ninformation flow-rate parameters implicit in the definitions of the information\nprocesses.

Instead of imposing a\nvolatility and correlation model upon the dynamics of a set of assets, one is\nable to deduce the dynamics of the volatilities and correlations of the asset\nprice movements from more primitive assumptions involving the associated cash\nflows.

In this work, we apply an analytic model that predicts the\nstructural properties of remnants formed in major mergers to progenitor disk\ngalaxies with properties taken from two different semi-analytic models. We\npredict the effective radius, velocity dispersion, luminosity, age, and\nmetallicity of the merger remnants, enabling us to compare directly to\nobservations of early-type galaxies. While we find a tight correlation between\nage and velocity dispersion, we find a stronger dependence of age and\nmetallicity on effective radius than observations report. The correlations\narise as a result of the dependence of gas fraction, age, and metallicity on\nthe stellar mass in the progenitor disk galaxies. These dependences induce a\nrotation in the radius-velocity plane between the correlations with effective\nradius and circular velocity in the disk galaxy progenitors, and the\ncorrelations with effective radius and velocity dispersion in the elliptical\ngalaxy remnants. The differences between our results and those from\nobservations suggest that major mergers alone cannot produce the observed lack\nof correlation between effective radius and stellar population parameters.\nSimulations have suggested that subsequent minor mergers introduce scatter in\nthe effective radius while leaving the velocity dispersion essentially\nunchanged.
