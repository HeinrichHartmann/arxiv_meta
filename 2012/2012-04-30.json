The behaviour of all three MHD wave modes, i.e. the\nAlfven wave and the fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves, has been investigated\nin the neighbourhood of 2D, 2.5D and (to a certain extent) 3D magnetic null\npoints, for a variety of assumptions, configurations and geometries. In\ngeneral, it is found that the fast magnetoacoustic wave behaviour is dictated\nby the Alfven-speed profile. In a $\\beta=0$ plasma, the fast wave is focused\ntowards the null point by a refraction effect and all the wave energy, and thus\ncurrent density, accumulates close to the null point. Thus, null points will be\nlocations for preferential heating by fast waves. Independently, the Alfven\nwave is found to propagate along magnetic fieldlines and is confined to the\nfieldlines it is generated on. As the wave approaches the null point, it\nspreads out due to the diverging fieldlines. Eventually, the Alfven wave\naccumulates along the separatrices (in 2D) or along the spine or fan-plane (in\n3D). Hence, Alfven wave energy will be preferentially dissipated at these\nlocations. It is clear that the magnetic field plays a fundamental role in the\npropagation and properties of MHD waves in the neighbourhood of coronal null\npoints.

The same occurs in the transient cases for which it is\nimpossible to exhibit locally normal states describing the Bose--Einstein\nCondensation at mean particle density strictly greater than the critical\ndensity . In addition, for the transient cases, in order to construct locally\nnormal temperature states through infinite volume limits of finite volume Gibbs\nstates, a careful choice of the the sequence of the finite volume chemical\npotential should be done. For all such states, the condensate is essentially\nallocated on the base--point supporting the perturbation. This leads that the\nparticle density always coincide with the critical one.

For SAT and its counting version #SAT, hidden\nstructure has been exploited in terms of decomposability and strong backdoor\nsets. Decomposability can be considered in terms of the treewidth of a graph\nthat is associated with the given CNF formula, for instance by considering\nclauses and variables as vertices of the graph, and making a variable adjacent\nwith all the clauses it appears in. On the other hand, a strong backdoor set of\na CNF formula is a set of variables such that each possible partial assignment\nto this set moves the formula into a fixed class for which (#)SAT can be solved\nin polynomial time.\n  In this paper we combine the two above approaches. In particular, we study\nthe algorithmic question of finding a small strong backdoor set into the class\nW_t of CNF formulas whose associated graphs have treewidth at most t. The main\nresults are positive:\n  (1) There is a cubic-time algorithm that, given a CNF formula F and two\nconstants k,t\\ge 0, either finds a strong W_t-backdoor set of size at most 2^k,\nor concludes that F has no strong W_t-backdoor set of size at most k.\n  (2) There is a cubic-time algorithm that, given a CNF formula F, computes the\nnumber of satisfying assignments of F or concludes that sb_t(F)>k, for any pair\nof constants k,t\\ge 0. Here, sb_t(F) denotes the size of a smallest strong\nW_t-backdoor set of F.\n  The significance of our results lies in the fact that they allow us to\nexploit algorithmically a hidden structure in formulas that is not accessible\nby any one of the two approaches (decomposability, backdoors) alone. Already a\nbackdoor size 1 on top of treewidth 1 (i.e., sb_1(F)=1) entails formulas of\narbitrarily large treewidth and arbitrarily large cycle cutsets.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1202.4331"]}]

In this paper, we propose a variant of demons, called Deformation\nwith Intensity Simultaneously Corrected (DISC), to deal with CT-CBCT DIR. DISC\ndistinguishes itself from the original demons algorithm by performing an\nadaptive intensity correction step on the CBCT image at every iteration step of\nthe demons registration. Specifically, the intensity correction of a voxel in\nCBCT is achieved by matching the first and the second moments of the voxel\nintensities inside a patch around the voxel with those on the CT image. It is\nexpected that such a strategy can remove artifacts in the CBCT image, as well\nas ensuring the intensity consistency between the two modalities. DISC is\nimplemented on computer graphics processing units (GPUs) in compute unified\ndevice architecture (CUDA) programming environment. The performance of DISC is\nevaluated on a simulated patient case and six clinical head-and-neck cancer\npatient data.
