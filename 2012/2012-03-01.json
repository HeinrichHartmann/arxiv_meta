We aim to put constraints on the turbulent velocities and\nturbulent pressure in the ICM of the giant elliptical galaxies NGC 5044 and NGC\n5813 using XMM-Newton RGS observations. The magnitude of the turbulence is\nestimated using the Fe XVII lines at 15.01 A, 17.05 A, and 17.10 A in the RGS\nspectra. At low turbulent velocities, the gas becomes optically thick in the\n15.01 A line due to resonant scattering, while the 17 A lines remain optically\nthin. By comparing the (I(17.05)+I(17.10))/I(15.01) line ratio from RGS with\nsimulated line ratios for different Mach numbers, the level of turbulence is\nconstrained. The measurement is limited by systematic uncertainties in the\natomic data, which are at the 20-30% level. We find that the line ratio in NGC\n5813 is significantly higher than in NGC 5044. This difference can be explained\nby a higher level of turbulence in NGC 5044. The high turbulent velocities and\nthe fraction of the turbulent pressure support of >40% in NGC 5044, assuming\nisotropic turbulence, confirm that it is a highly disturbed system, probably\ndue to an off-axis merger. The turbulent pressure support in NGC 5813 is more\nmodest at 15-45%.

The model-driven approach avoids the limitations that conventional\nparser generators impose on the language designer. Conventional tools require\nthe designed language grammar to conform to the specific kind of grammar\nsupported by the particular parser generator (being LL and LR parser generators\nthe most common). Model-driven parser generators, like ModelCC, do not require\na grammar specification, since that grammar can be automatically derived from\nthe language model and, if needed, adapted to conform to the requirements of\nthe given kind of parser, all of this without interfering with the conceptual\ndesign of the language and its associated applications. Moreover, model-driven\ntools such as ModelCC are able to automatically resolve references between\nlanguage elements, hence producing abstract syntax graphs instead of abstract\nsyntax trees as the result of the parsing process. Such graphs are not confined\nto directed acyclic graphs and they can contain cycles, since ModelCC supports\nanaphoric, cataphoric, and recursive references.\n"]}]

The algorithm relies on the following two observations: (1) the\nlow-index eigenvectors of the diffusion, or graph Laplacian, operators are very\nrobust to random perturbations of the weights and random changes in the\nconnections of the patch-graph; and (2) patches extracted from smooth regions\nof the image are organized along smooth low-dimensional structures in the\npatch-set, and therefore can be reconstructed with few eigenvectors.\nExperiments demonstrate that our denoising algorithm outperforms the denoising\ngold-standards.\n"]}]
