For weak magnetic fields, dilute plasmas are buoyantly unstable\nfor either sign of the temperature gradient: the heat-flux-driven buoyancy\ninstability (HBI) operates when the temperature increases with radius while the\nmagnetothermal instability (MTI) operates in the opposite limit. In contrast to\nprevious results, we show that, in the presence of a sustained temperature\ngradient, the MTI drives strong turbulence and operates as an efficient\nmagnetic dynamo (akin to standard, adiabatic convection). Together, the\nturbulent and magnetic energies contribute up to ~10% of the pressure support\nin the plasma. In addition, the MTI drives a large convective heat flux, ~1.5%\nof rho c_s^3. These findings are robust even in the presence of an external\nsource of strong turbulence. Our results on the nonlinear saturation of the HBI\nare consistent with previous studies but we explain physically why the HBI\nsaturates quiescently by re-orienting the magnetic field (suppressing the\nconductive heat flux through the plasma), while the MTI saturates by generating\nsustained turbulence. We also systematically study how an external source of\nturbulence affects the saturation of the HBI: such turbulence can disrupt the\nHBI only on scales where the shearing rate of the turbulence is faster than the\ngrowth rate of the HBI. In particular, our results provide a simple mapping\nbetween the level of turbulence in a plasma and the effective isotropic thermal\nconductivity.

Since the physical heating mechanism remains uncertain\nin massive halos such as groups or clusters, we adopt a simple,\nobservationally-motivated prescription which enforces global thermal\nequilibrium when averaged over large scales. The plasma remains susceptible to\nlocal thermal instability, however, and cooling drives an inward flow of\nmaterial. In contrast to previous results, we argue that the thermal stability\nof the plasma is independent of its convective stability. We find that the\nratio of the cooling timescale to the dynamical timescale t_cool/t_ff controls\nthe saturation of the thermal instability: when t_cool/t_ff < 1, the plasma\ndevelops extended multi-phase structure, whereas when t_cool / t_ff > 1 it does\nnot. (In a companion paper, we show that the criterion for thermal instability\nin a spherical potential is somewhat less stringent, t_cool / t_ff < 10.) When\nthermal conduction is anisotropic with respect to the magnetic field, the\ncriterion for multi-phase structure is essentially independent of the thermal\nconductivity of the plasma. Our criterion for local thermal instability to\nproduce multi-phase structure is an extension of the cold vs. hot accretion\nmodes in galaxy formation that applies at all radii in hot halos, not just to\nthe virial shock. We show that this criterion is consistent with data on\nmulti-phase gas in the ACCEPT sample of clusters; in addition, when t_cool /\nt_ff > 1, the net cooling rate to low temperatures and the mass flux to small\nradii are suppressed enough relative to models without heating to be\nqualitatively consistent with star formation rates and x-ray line emission in\ngroups and clusters.\n","Comment: This is an electronic version of an article published in Monthly\n  Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Volume 419, Issue 4, pp. 3319-3337"]}]

However,\nsubsequent advances in bioinformatics tools for analysing transposable elements\nand the recent availability of genome sequences for multiple strains and\nspecies of yeast motivates new investigations into Ty evolution in S.\ncerevisiae. Here we provide a comprehensive phylogenetic and population genetic\nanalysis of Ty families in S. cerevisiae based on a reannotation of Ty elements\nin the S288c reference genome. We show that previous annotation efforts have\nunderestimated the total copy number of Ty elements for all known families. In\naddition, we identify a new family of Ty3-like elements related to the S.\nparadoxus Ty3p which is composed entirely of degenerate solo LTRs. Phylogenetic\nanalyses of LTR sequences identified three families with short-branch, recently\nactive clades nested among long branch, inactive insertions (Ty1, Ty3, Ty4),\none family with essentially all recently active elements (Ty2) and two families\nwith only inactive elements (Ty3p and Ty5). Population genomic data from 38\nadditional strains of S. cerevisiae show that elements present in active clades\nare predominantly polymorphic, whereas most of the inactive elements are fixed.\nFinally, we use comparative genomic data to provide evidence that the Ty2 and\nTy3p families have arisen in the S. cerevisiae genome by horizontal transfer.\nOur results demonstrate that the genome of a single individual contains\nimportant information about the state of TE population dynamics within a\nspecies and suggest that horizontal transfer may play an important role in\nshaping the diversity of transposable elements in unicellular eukaryotes.\n","Comment: 34 pages, 7 figures"]}]

Physarum may be considered as a smart computing and\nactuating material since both its motor and control systems are distributed\nwithin its undifferentiated tissue and can survive trauma such as excision,\nfission and fusion of plasmodia. Thus it may be suitable for exploring the\ngeneration and distribution of micro-actuation in individual units or planar\narrays. We experimentally show how the plasmodium of Physarum is shaped to\nexecute controllable oscillatory transport behaviour applicable in small hybrid\nengines. We measure the lifting force of the plasmodium and demonstrate how\nprotoplasmic transport can be influenced by externally applied illumination\nstimuli. We provide an exemplar vehicle mechanism by coupling the oscillations\nof the plasmodium to drive the wheels of a Braitenberg vehicle and use light\nstimuli to effect a steering mechanism. Using a particle model of Physarum we\nshow how emergent travelling wave patterns produced by competing oscillatory\ndomains may be used to to generate spatially represented actuation patterns. We\ndemonstrate different patterns of controllable motion, including linear,\nreciprocal, rotational and helical, and demonstrate in simulation how dynamic\noscillatory patterns may be translated into motive forces for simple transport\nof substances within a patterned environment.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1212.0023"]}]

The\nprimary goal of the paper to develop a general framework for constructing high\norder local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) methods for approximating viscosity\nsolutions of these fully nonlinear PDEs which are merely continuous functions\nby definition. In order to capture discontinuities of the first order\nderivative $u_x$ of the solution $u$, two independent functions $q_1$ and $q_2$\nare introduced to approximate one-sided derivatives of $u$. Similarly, to\ncapture the discontinuities of the second order derivative $u_{xx}$, four\nindependent functions $p_{1}$, $p_{2}$, $p_{3}$, and $p_{4}$ are used to\napproximate one-sided derivatives of $q_1$ and $q_2$. The proposed LDG\nframework, which is based on a nonstandard mixed formulation of the underlying\nPDE, embeds a given fully nonlinear problem into a mostly linear system of\nequations where the given nonlinear differential operator must be replaced by a\nnumerical operator which allows multiple value inputs of the first and second\norder derivatives $u_x$ and $u_{xx}$. An easy to verify criterion for\nconstructing \"good\" numerical operators is also proposed. It consists of a\nconsistency and a generalized monotonicity. To ensure such a generalized\nmonotonicity, the crux of the construction is to introduce the numerical moment\nin the numerical operator. The proposed framework extends a companion finite\ndifference framework developed by the authors in [9] and allows for the\napproximation of fully nonlinear PDEs using high order polynomials and\nnon-uniform meshes.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 15 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:1212.0259"]}]
