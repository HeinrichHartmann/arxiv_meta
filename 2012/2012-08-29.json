The main emphasis\nis put on obtaining a reliable analytical estimate for the transition\ntemperature into the excitonic state. As in a double-layer graphene system the\ntotal number of fermionic \"flavors\" is equal to N=8 due to two projections of\nspin, two valleys, and two layers, the large-$N$ approximation appears to be\nespecially suitable for theoretical investigation of the system. On the other\nhand, the large number of flavors makes screening of the bare Coulomb\ninteractions very efficient, which, together with the suppression of\nbackscattering in graphene, leads to an extremely low energy of the excitonic\ncondensation. It is shown that the effect of screening on the excitonic pairing\nis just as strong in the excitonic state as it is in the normal state. As a\nresult, the value of the excitonic gap $\\De$ is found to be in full agreement\nwith the previously obtained estimate for the mean-field transition temperature\n$T_c$, the maximum possible value $\\Delta^{\\rm max},T_c^{\\rm max}\\sim 10^{-7}\n\\epsilon_F$ ($\\epsilon_F$ is the Fermi energy) of both being in $ 1{\\rm mK}$\nrange for a perfectly clean system.

The absorption of electron-type\nneutrinos below the radius of the stalled shockwave may drive explosions (the\n\"neutrino mechanism\"). Because the heating rate is proportional to the square\nof neutrino energy, flavor conversion of mu and tau neutrinos to electron-type\nneutrinos via collective neutrino oscillations (CnuO) may in principle increase\nthe heating rate and drive explosions. In order to assess the potential\nimportance of CnuO for the shock revival, we solve the steady-state boundary\nvalue problem of spherically-symmetric accretion between the PNS surface (r_nu)\nand the shock (r_S), including a scheme for flavor conversion via CnuO. For a\ngiven r_nu, PNS mass (M), accretion rate (Mdot), and assumed values of the\nneutrino energies from the PNS, we calculate the critical neutrino luminosity\nabove which accretion is impossible and explosion results. We show that CnuO\ncan decrease the critical luminosity by a factor of at most ~1.5, but only if\nthe flavor conversion is fully completed inside r_S and if there is no matter\nsuppression. The magnitude of the effect depends on the model parameters (M,\nMdot, and r_nu) through the shock radius and the physical scale for flavor\nconversion. We quantify these dependencies and find that CnuO could lower the\ncritical luminosity only for small M and Mdot, and large r_nu. However, for\nthese parameter values CnuO are suppressed due to matter effects. By\nquantifying the importance of CnuO and matter suppression at the critical\nneutrino luminosity for explosion, we show in agreement with previous studies\nthat CnuO are unlikely to affect the neutrino mechanism of core-collapse\nsupernovae significantly.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 3 figures, accepted to MNRAS"]}]

Just so\nHiggs splitting can be induced without significantly affecting the t-b-tau\nunification in SO(10) models containing Higgs fields transforming as\n10+\\bar{126}+126+210. This splitting arises in the presence of non-universal\nboundary conditions from mixing between 10 and other Higgs fields. Similarly,\nif additional matter fields are introduced then their mixing with the matter\nmultiplet 16 is shown to generate the squark splitting required to raise the\ngluino mass within the t-b-tau unified models with positive \\mu.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 6 figures"]}]

One of the goals of imaging arrays of Cherenkov telescopes\nlike CTA is to survey areas of the sky for faint very high energy gamma-ray\n(VHE) sources, especially sources that would not have drawn attention were it\nnot for their VHE emission (e.g. the Galactic \"dark accelerators\"). More than\nhalf the currently known VHE sources are to be found in the Galactic plane.\nUsing standard techniques, CTA can carry out a survey of the region |l|<60\ndegrees, |b|<2 degrees in 250 hr (1/4th the available time per year at one\nlocation) down to a uniform sensitivity of 3 mCrab (a \"Galactic Plane survey\").\nCTA could also survey 1/4th of the sky down to a sensitivity of 20 mCrab in 370\nhr of observing time (an \"all-sky survey\"), which complements well the surveys\nby the Fermi/LAT at lower energies and extended air shower arrays at higher\nenergies. Observations in (non-standard) divergent pointing mode may shorten\nthe \"all-sky survey\" time to about 100 hr with no loss in survey sensitivity.\nWe present the scientific rationale for these surveys, their place in the\nmulti-wavelength context, their possible impact and their feasibility. We find\nthat the Galactic Plane survey has the potential to detect hundreds of sources.\nImplementing such a survey should be a major goal of CTA. Additionally, about a\ndozen blazars, or counterparts to Fermi/LAT sources, are expected to be\ndetected by the all-sky survey, whose prime motivation is the search for\nextragalactic \"dark accelerators\".\n","Comment: 10 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in Astroparticle\n  Physics, special issue on Physics with the Cherenkov Telescope Array"]}]

In this approach, the envelope equations are first expressed in\nHamiltonian form. The Hamiltonian defines a nonlinear mapping, $\\cal M$, and\nfor periodic transport systems the fixed points of the one-period map are the\nmatched envelopes. Expanding the Hamiltonian around a fiducial trajectory one\nobtains a linear map, $M$, that describes trajectories (rms envelopes) near the\nfiducial trajectory. Using $\\cal M$ and $M$ we construct a contraction mapping\nthat can be used to obtain the matched envelopes. The algorithm is\nquadratically convergent. Using the zero-current matched parameters as starting\nvalues, the contraction mapping typically converges in a few to several\niterations. Since our approach uses numerical integration to obtain all the\nmappings, it includes the effects of nonidealized, $z$-dependent transverse and\nlongitudinal focusing fields.

A winning strategy for such a game is positional if it\nonly depends on the current position, and not on the history of the play. A\ngame is positionally determined if, from each position, one of the two players\nhas a positional winning strategy.\n  The theory of such games is well studied for winning conditions that are\ndefined in terms of a mapping that assigns to each position a priority from a\nfinite set. Specifically, in Muller games the winner of a play is determined by\nthe set of those priorities that have been seen infinitely often; an important\nspecial case are parity games where the least (or greatest) priority occurring\ninfinitely often determines the winner. It is well-known that parity games are\npositionally determined whereas Muller games are determined via finite-memory\nstrategies.\n  In this paper, we extend this theory to the case of games with infinitely\nmany priorities. Such games arise in several application areas, for instance in\npushdown games with winning conditions depending on stack contents.\n  For parity games there are several generalisations to the case of infinitely\nmany priorities. While max-parity games over omega or min-parity games over\nlarger ordinals than omega require strategies with infinite memory, we can\nprove that min-parity games with priorities in omega are positionally\ndetermined. Indeed, it turns out that the min-parity condition over omega is\nthe only infinitary Muller condition that guarantees positional determinacy on\nall game graphs.\n","Comment: This paper has been replaced due to a typo in the title"]}]
