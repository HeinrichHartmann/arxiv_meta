With the X-ray detection of NGC\n5315, objects with WR-type central stars now constitute a clear majority of\nknown examples of diffuse X-ray sources among PNe; all such ``hot bubble'' PN\nX-ray sources display well-defined, quasi-continuous optical rims. We therefore\nassert that X-ray-luminous hot bubbles are characteristic of young PNe with\nlarge central star wind kinetic energies and closed bubble morphologies.\nHowever, the evidence at hand also suggests that processes such as wind and\nbubble temporal evolution, as well as heat conduction and/or mixing of hot\nbubble and nebular gas, ultimately govern the luminosity and temperature of\nsuperheated plasma within PNe.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 4 figures; to appear in the Astrophysical Journal, 2008\n  Jan. 10 issue (Vol. 672)"]}]

In the ordinary\nformulation, the coframe gravity does not have any connection to a specific\ngeometry even being constructed from the geometrical meaningful objects. A\ngeometrization of the coframe gravity is an aim of this paper.\n  We construct a complete class of the coframe connections which are linear in\nthe first order derivatives of the coframe field on an $n$ dimensional\nmanifolds with and without a metric. The subclasses of the torsion-free,\nmetric-compatible and flat connections are derived. We also study the behavior\nof the geometrical structures under local transformations of the coframe. The\nremarkable fact is an existence of a subclass of connections which are\ninvariant when the infinitesimal transformations satisfy the Maxwell-like\nsystem of equations. In the framework of the coframe geometry construction, we\npropose a geometrical action for the coframe gravity. It is similar to the\nEinstein-Hilbert action of GR, but the scalar curvature is constructed from the\ngeneral coframe connection. We show that this geometric Lagrangian is\nequivalent to the coframe Lagrangian up to a total derivative term. Moreover\nthere is a family of coframe connections which Lagrangian does not include the\nhigher order terms at all.

Trends in\nthe dominant band positions and intensities are compared to those of large,\ncompact PAHs as a function of geometry, size and charge. Irregular edge\nmoieties that are common in terrestrial PAHs, such as bay regions and rings\nwith quartet hydrogens, are shown to be uncommon in astronomical PAHs. As for\nall PAHs comprised solely of C and H reported to date, mid-IR emission from\nirregular PAHs fails to produce a strong CCstr band at 6.2 um, the position\ncharacteristic of the important, class A astronomical PAH spectra. Earlier\nstudies showed inclusion of nitrogen within a PAH shifts this to 6.2 um for PAH\ncations. Here we show this band shifts to 6.3 um in nitrogenated PAH anions,\nclose to the position of the CC stretch in class B astronomical PAH spectra.\nThus nitrogenated PAHs may be important in all sources and the peak position of\nthe CC stretch near 6.2 um appears to directly reflect the PAH cation to anion\nratio. Large irregular PAHs exhibit features at 7.8 um but lack them near 8.6\num. Hence, the 7.7 um astronomical feature is produced by a mixture of small\nand large PAHs while the 8.6 um band can only be produced by large compact\nPAHs. As with the CCstr, the position and profile of these bands reflect the\nPAH cation to anion ratio.\n","Comment: accepted by ApJ"]}]

The optical spectrum of this object exhibits\nrather narrow Hbeta (FWHM(Hbeta) ~ 1500 km s^-1), weak forbidden lines and is\ntherefore classified as a narrow-line type I quasar. This class of objects is\nthought to have relatively small black hole mass and to accrete at high\nEddington ratio. The radio loudness and variability of the compact radio core\nindicates the presence of a relativistic jet. Quasi simultaneous\nradio-optical-X-ray and gamma-ray observations are presented. Both radio and\ngamma-ray emission (observed over 5-months) are strongly variable. The\nsimultaneous optical and X-ray data from Swift show a blue continuum attributed\nto the accretion disk and a hard X-ray spectrum attributed to the jet. The\nresulting broad band spectral energy distribution (SED) and, in particular, the\ngamma-ray spectrum measured by Fermi are similar to those of more powerful\nFSRQ. A comparison of the radio and gamma-ray characteristics of PMN J0948+0022\nwith the other blazars detected by LAT shows that this source has a relatively\nlow radio and gamma-ray power, with respect to other FSRQ. The physical\nparameters obtained from modelling the SED also fall at the low power end of\nthe FSRQ parameter region discussed in Celotti & Ghisellini (2008).

The planetary deviation was detected in real-time thanks to the\nhigh cadence of the MOA survey, real-time light curve monitoring and intensive\nfollow-up observations. A Bayesian analysis returns the stellar mass and\ndistance at M_l = 0.64_{-0.26}^{+0.21} M_\\sun and D_l = 5.9_{-1.4}^{+0.9} kpc,\nrespectively, so the mass and separation of the planet are M_p = 20_{-8}^{+7}\nM_\\oplus and a = 3.3_{-0.8}^{+1.4} AU, respectively. This discovery adds\nanother cold Neptune-mass planet to the planetary sample discovered by\nmicrolensing, which now comprise four cold Neptune/Super-Earths, five gas giant\nplanets, and another sub-Saturn mass planet whose nature is unclear. The\ndiscovery of these ten cold exoplanets by the microlensing method implies that\nthe mass ratio function of cold exoplanets scales as dN_{\\rm pl}/d\\log q\n\\propto q^{-0.7 +/- 0.2} with a 95% confidence level upper limit of n < -0.35\n(where dN_{\\rm pl}/d\\log q \\propto q^n). As microlensing is most sensitive to\nplanets beyond the snow-line, this implies that Neptune-mass planets are at\nleast three times more common than Jupiters in this region at the 95%\nconfidence level.\n","Comment: 39 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

The Fermi telescope provides a new opportunity to test particle\ndark matter models through the expected gamma-ray emission produced by pair\nannihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Local Group dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies, the largest galactic substructures predicted by the cold\ndark matter scenario, are attractive targets for such indirect searches for\ndark matter because they are nearby and among the most extreme dark matter\ndominated environments. No significant gamma-ray emission was detected above\n100 MeV from the candidate dwarf galaxies. We determine upper limits to the\ngamma-ray flux assuming both power-law spectra and representative spectra from\nWIMP annihilation. The resulting integral flux above 100 MeV is constrained to\nbe at a level below around 10^-9 photons cm^-2 s^-1. Using recent stellar\nkinematic data, the gamma-ray flux limits are combined with improved\ndeterminations of the dark matter density profile in 8 of the 14 candidate\ndwarfs to place limits on the pair annihilation cross-section of WIMPs in\nseveral widely studied extensions of the standard model. With the present data,\nwe are able to rule out large parts of the parameter space where the thermal\nrelic density is below the observed cosmological dark matter density and WIMPs\n(neutralinos here) are dominantly produced non-thermally, e.g. in models where\nsupersymmetry breaking occurs via anomaly mediation. The gamma-ray limits\npresented here also constrain some WIMP models proposed to explain the Fermi\nand PAMELA e^+e^- data, including low-mass wino-like neutralinos and models\nwith TeV masses pair-annihilating into muon-antimuon pairs.

PLR's primary\nobjective is to measure the curvature of space around the Sun, represented by\nthe Eddington parameter $\\gamma$, with an accuracy of two parts in $10^7$,\nthereby improving today's best result by two orders of magnitude. Other mission\ngoals include measurements of the time-rate-of-change of the gravitational\nconstant, $G$ and of the gravitational inverse square law at 1.5 AU\ndistances--with up to two orders-of-magnitude improvement for each. The science\nparameters will be estimated using laser ranging measurements of the distance\nbetween an Earth station and an active laser transponder on Phobos capable of\nreaching mm-level range resolution. A transponder on Phobos sending 0.25 mJ, 10\nps pulses at 1 kHz, and receiving asynchronous 1 kHz pulses from earth via a 12\ncm aperture will permit links that even at maximum range will exceed a photon\nper second. A total measurement precision of 50 ps demands a few hundred\nphotons to average to 1 mm (3.3 ps) range precision. Existing satellite laser\nranging (SLR) facilities--with appropriate augmentation--may be able to\nparticipate in PLR. Since Phobos' orbital period is about 8 hours, each\nobservatory is guaranteed visibility of the Phobos instrument every Earth day.\nGiven the current technology readiness level, PLR could be started in 2011 for\nlaunch in 2016 for 3 years of science operations.

The ILC will collide electrons and\npositrons at energies of initially 500 GeV, upgradeable to 1 TeV. The ILC has\nan ambitious physics program, which will extend and complement that of the\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC). A hallmark of physics at the ILC is precision. The\nclean initial state and the comparatively benign environment of a lepton\ncollider are ideally suited to high precision measurements. To take full\nadvantage of the physics potential of ILC places great demands on the detector\nperformance. The design of ILD is driven by these requirements. Excellent\ncalorimetry and tracking are combined to obtain the best possible overall event\nreconstruction, including the capability to reconstruct individual particles\nwithin jets for particle ow calorimetry. This requires excellent spatial\nresolution for all detector systems. A highly granular calorimeter system is\ncombined with a central tracker which stresses redundancy and efficiency. In\naddition, efficient reconstruction of secondary vertices and excellent momentum\nresolution for charged particles are essential for an ILC detector. The\ninteraction region of the ILC is designed to host two detectors, which can be\nmoved into the beam position with a push-pull scheme. The mechanical design of\nILD and the overall integration of subdetectors takes these operational\nconditions into account.\n","Comment: 163 pages, 91 figures"]}]

The enlarged covariance\ngroup leads to a non-commutative geometry based not on a manifold, but on a\nnonlocal space in which paths, rather than points, are the most primitive\ninvariant entities.

Strong parton energy loss has been observed in central\nnucleus-nucleus collisions as evidenced by the a large suppression of the yield\nof high pT hadrons as compared to the expected yield based on measurements in\np+p collisions. Moreover, measurements of back-to-back correlations of charged\nhadrons suggest that jet shapes are strongly modified modified by the medium.\nThe quantitative interpretation of single and di-hadron measurements is,\nhowever, complicated by the fact that the initial parton energy is unknown. A\nmore informative measurement would be one in which the initial parton energy is\nknown, allowing the determination of the fragmentation function, which may be\neffectively modified from its vacuum form by the presence of the medium. Two\nmeasurements in which the initial parton energy may be estimated are discussed\nin these proceedings: jet reconstruction and two- particle correlations using\ndirect photons. Jet reconstruction in nuclear collisions is challenging due to\nthe large background of soft particles, fluctuations of which give rise to fake\njets. Direct photons can be used to estimate the initial parton energy of the\nrecoil jet without recourse to jet reconstruction algorithms. However, such\nstudies suffer from a smaller rate and the direct photon signal must be\ndisentangled from a large background of decay photons. We present jet\nreconstruction results which use an algorithm suitable for a high multiplicity\nenvironment. We also present results of two-particle correlations using direct\nphotons. These results are discussed in the context of medium modification to\nthe fragmentation function.\n","Comment: Talk presented at DIS 2010, Florence, Italy"]}]

Theoretical\nconsiderations predict a critical point of strongly interacting matter at\nenergies accessible at the SPS. The NA61/SHINE experiment, a successor of the\nNA49 project, will study hadron production in p+p, p+A, h+A, and A+A reactions\nat various energies. The broad physics program includes the investigation of\nthe properties of strongly interacting matter, as well as precision\nmeasurements of hadron spectra for the T2K neutrino experiment and for the\nPierre Auger Observatory and KASCADE cosmic-ray projects. The main physics\ngoals of the NA61/SHINE ion program are to study the properties of the onset of\ndeconfinement at low SPS energies and to find signatures of the critical point\nof strongly interacting matter. To achieve these goals a broad range in the (T\n- \\mu_{B}) phase diagram will be covered by performing an energy (10A-158A\nGeV/c) and system size (p+p, B+C, Ar+Ca, Xe+La) scan. The first data for this\n2-D scan were taken in 2009, i.e. p+p interactions at 20, 30, 40, 80, 158 GeV/c\nbeam energy.

It is based on the idea that dark energy and inflation should be\ncaused by the same physical process. As motivation, we note that Linde's simple\nchaotic inflation $V=(1/2)m^{2}\\phi^{2}$ produces values of $n_{s}=0.967$ and\n$r=0.13$, which are consistent with the WMAP 1-sigma error bars. We therefore\npropose $V=(1/2)m_{2}^{2}\\phi_{2}^{2}+(1/2)m_{1}^{2}\\phi_{1}^{2}$ with\n$m_{1}\\sim10^{-5}$ and $m_{2}\\leq10^{-60}$, where $c=1=\\hbar$ and the reduced\nPlanck mass is set to unity. The field $\\phi_{1}$ drives inflation and has\ndamped by now ($\\phi_{1,0}=0$), while $\\phi_{2}$ is currently rolling down its\npotential to produce dark energy. Using this model, we derive the formula\n$\\delta w(z)\\equiv w(z)+1=\\delta w_{0}(H_0/H(z))^2$ via the slow-roll\napproximation. Our numerical results from exact and self-consistent solution of\nthe equations of motion for $\\phi_2$ and the Friedmann equations support this\nformula, and it should hold for any slow-roll dark energy.\n  Our potential can be easily realized in N-flation models with many fields,\nand is easily falsifiable by upcoming experiments -- for example, if Linde's\nchaotic inflation is ruled out. But if $r$ values consistent with Linde's\nchaotic inflation are detected then one should take this model seriously\nindeed.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 5 figures; updated to reflect version accepted in MNRAS May\n  11, 2011; published online in MNRAS \"early view\" August 16, 2011, forthcoming\n  in print"]}]

No significant gamma-ray\nemission was found above the background. Differential upper limits on the\ngamma-ray flux are derived assuming various power-law slopes for the possible\nemission spectrum. Integral upper limits are also calculated for several\npower-law spectra and for different energy thresholds. The values are of the\norder of 10^{-11} ph cm^{-2}$ s^{-1} above 100 GeV and 10^{-12} ph cm^{-2}\ns^{-1} above 200 GeV. Segue 1 is currently considered one of the most\ninteresting targets for indirect dark matter searches. In these terms, the\nupper limits have been also interpreted in the context of annihilating dark\nmatter particles. For such purpose, we performed a grid scan over a reasonable\nportion of the parameter space for the minimal SuperGravity model and computed\nthe flux upper limit for each point separately, taking fully into account the\npeculiar spectral features of each model. We found that in order to match the\nexperimental upper limits with the model predictions, a minimum flux boost of\n10^{3} is required, and that the upper limits are quite dependent on the shape\nof the gamma-ray energy spectrum predicted by each specific model. Finally we\ncompared the upper limits with the predictions of some dark matter models able\nto explain the PAMELA rise in the positron ratio, finding that Segue 1 data are\nin tension with the dark matter explanation of the PAMELA spectrum in the case\nof a dark matter candidate annihilating into tau+tau-.

Our contact network model\nincludes classroom structure, longer durations of contacts to friends than\nnonfriends and more frequent contacts with friends, based on reports in the\ncontact survey. We performed simulation studies to explore which network\nstructures are relevant to influenza transmission. These studies yield two key\nfindings. First, we found that the friendship network structure important to\nthe transmission process can be adequately represented by a dyad-independent\nexponential random graph model (ERGM). This means that individual-level sampled\ndata is sufficient to characterize the entire friendship network. Second, we\nfound that contact behavior was adequately represented by a static rather than\ndynamic contact network.\n","Comment: Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/11-AOAS505 the Annals of\n  Applied Statistics (http://www.imstat.org/aoas/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)"]}]

M 87\nhas been established as a VHE gamma-ray emitter since 2006. The VHE gamma-ray\nemission displays strong variability on timescales as short as a day. In this\npaper, results from a joint VHE monitoring campaign on M 87 by the MAGIC and\nVERITAS instruments in 2010 are reported. During the campaign, a flare at VHE\nwas detected triggering further observations at VHE (H.E.S.S.), X-rays\n(Chandra), and radio (43 GHz VLBA). The excellent sampling of the VHE gamma-ray\nlight curve enables one to derive a precise temporal characterization of the\nflare: the single, isolated flare is well described by a two-sided exponential\nfunction with significantly different flux rise and decay times. While the\noverall variability pattern of the 2010 flare appears somewhat different from\nthat of previous VHE flares in 2005 and 2008, they share very similar\ntimescales (~day), peak fluxes (Phi(>0.35 TeV) ~= (1-3) x 10^-11 ph cm^-2\ns^-1), and VHE spectra. 43 GHz VLBA radio observations of the inner jet regions\nindicate no enhanced flux in 2010 in contrast to observations in 2008, where an\nincrease of the radio flux of the innermost core regions coincided with a VHE\nflare. On the other hand, Chandra X-ray observations taken ~3 days after the\npeak of the VHE gamma-ray emission reveal an enhanced flux from the core. The\nlong-term (2001-2010) multi-wavelength light curve of M 87, spanning from radio\nto VHE and including data from HST, LT, VLA and EVN, is used to further\ninvestigate the origin of the VHE gamma-ray emission. No unique, common MWL\nsignature of the three VHE flares has been identified.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 5 figures; Corresponding authors: M. Raue, L. Stawarz, D.\n  Mazin, P. Colin, C. M. Hui, M.

Transient neutrino sources such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and\nSupernovae (SNe) are hypothesized to emit bursts of high-energy neutrinos on a\ntime-scale of \\lesssim 100 s. While GRB neutrinos would be produced in high\nrelativistic jets, core-collapse SNe might host soft-relativistic jets, which\nbecome stalled in the outer layers of the progenitor star leading to an\nefficient production of high-energy neutrinos. Aims. To increase the\nsensitivity to these neutrinos and identify their sources, a low-threshold\noptical follow-up program for neutrino multiplets detected with the IceCube\nobservatory has been implemented. Methods. If a neutrino multiplet, i.e. two or\nmore neutrinos from the same direction within 100 s, is found by IceCube a\ntrigger is sent to the Robotic Optical Transient Search Experiment, ROTSE. The\n4 ROTSE telescopes immediately start an observation program of the\ncorresponding region of the sky in order to detect an optical counterpart to\nthe neutrino events. Results. No statistically significant excess in the rate\nof neutrino multiplets has been observed and furthermore no coincidence with an\noptical counterpart was found. Conclusion. The search allows, for the first\ntime, to set stringent limits on current models predicting a high-energy\nneutrino flux from soft relativistic hadronic jets in core-collapse SNe. We\nconclude that a sub-population of SNe with typical Lorentz boost factor and jet\nenergy of 10 and 3\\times10^{51} erg, respectively, does not exceed 4.2% at 90%\nconfidence.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 12 figures, submitted to A&A"]}]

By performing detailed\nsimulations of neutron star cooling, we show that extremely strong heating from\nfield decay in the core cannot produce the high observed surface temperatures\nnor delay the onset of neutron superfluidity in the core. We verify the results\nof Kaminker et al., namely that the high magnetar surface temperatures require\nheating in the neutron star crust, and crust heating is decoupled from\ncooling/heating in the core. Therefore, because crust heating masks core\nheating, it is not possible to conclude that magnetar cores are in a\nnon-superfluid state purely from high surface temperatures. From our interior\ntemperature evolutions and after accounting for proton superconductivity in the\ncore, we find that neutron superfluidity in the core occurs less than a few\nhundred years after neutron star formation. This onset time is unaffected by\nheating due to core field decay at fields < 10^16 G. Thus all known neutron\nstars, including magnetars, without a core containing exotic particles, should\nhave a core of superfluid neutrons and superconducting protons.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 8 figures; MNRAS, in print; v3 same as v2; correction to\n  ion heat capacity equations published in Erratum (see\n  http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1111/j.1365-2966.2012.21441.x )"]}]

In this paper we present a linear analysis of\nthe RWI in 3D global models of isothermal discs. We calculate the growth rates\nof the Rossby modes (of various azimuthal wave numbers m = 2 - 6) trapped\naround the fiducial density bump and carry out 3D numerical simulations to\ncompare with our linear results. We show that the 3D RWI growth rates are only\nslightly smaller than the 2D growth rates, and the velocity structures seen in\nthe numerical simulations during the linear phase are in agreement with the\nvelocity eigenfunctions obtained in our linear calculations. This numerical\nbenchmark shows that numerical simulations can accurately describe the\ninstability. The angular momentum transfer rate associated with Rossby vortices\nis also studied.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

We establish a simple\nprescription for preparing equivalent RMF and SHF parametrizations starting\nfrom a minimal set of empirical constraints on symmetric nuclear matter,\nnuclear binding energy and charge radii, enforcing equivalence of their Lorenz\neffective masses, and then using the pure neutron matter (PNM) equation of\nstate (EoS) obtained from ab-initio calculations to optimize the pure isovector\nparameters in the RMF and SHF models. We find the resulting RMF and SHF\nparametrizations give broadly consistent predictions of the symmetry energy J\nand its slope parameter L at saturation density within a tight range of <~2 MeV\nand <~6 MeV respectively, but that clear model dependence shows up in the\npredictions of higher-order symmetry energy parameters, leading to important\ndifferences in (a) the slope of the correlation between J and L from the\nconfidence ellipse, (b) the isospin-dependent part of the incompressibility of\nnuclear matter K_tau, (c) the symmetry energy at supra-saturation densities,\nand (d) the predicted neutron star radii. The model dependence can lead to\nabout 1-2 km difference in predictions of the neutron star radius given\nidentical predicted values of J, L and symmetric nuclear matter (SNM)\nsaturation properties.

However, even for\nhaloes with a minor-to-major axis ratio q = 0.3, the numbers of M31 MACHOs in\nthe far-side outnumber those in the near-side by a factor of ~2. We show that,\nif positional information is exploited in addition to number counts, then the\nnumber of candidate events required to confirm asymmetry for a range of\nflattened and anisotropic halo models is achievable, even with significant\ncontamination by variable stars and foreground microlensing events. For\npixel-lensing surveys which probe a representative portion of the M31 disk, a\nsample of around 50 candidates is likely to be sufficient to detect asymmetry\nwithin spherical haloes, even if half the sample is contaminated, or to detect\nasymmetry in haloes as flat as q = 0.3 provided less than a third of the sample\ncomprises contaminants. We also argue that, provided its mass-to-light ratio is\nless than 100, the recently observed stellar stream around M31 is not\nproblematic for the detection of asymmetry.

Galaxies with higher infrared surface\nbrightnesses have best-fit smoothing scale-lengths of a few hundred parsecs,\nsubstantially shorter than those for lower surface brightness galaxies. We\ninterpret this result to suggest that galaxies with higher disk averaged star\nformation rates have had a recent episode of enhanced star formation and are\ncharacterized by a higher fraction of young CR electrons that have traveled\nonly a few hundred parsecs from their acceleration sites in supernova remnants\ncompared to galaxies with lower star formation activity.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures; Accepted for publication in ApJ Letters"]}]

Inflation seems like a\nvery promising answer, but as Borde and Vilenkin have shown, the inflationary\nstate preceding the Big Bang must have had a beginning also. Ultimately, the\ndifficult question seems to be how to make something out of nothing. This paper\nexplores the idea that this is the wrong question --- that that is not how the\nUniverse got here. Instead, we explore the idea of whether there is anything in\nthe laws of physics that would prevent the Universe from creating itself.\nBecause spacetimes can be curved and multiply connected, general relativity\nallows for the possibility of closed timelike curves (CTCs). Thus, tracing\nbackwards in time through the original inflationary state we may eventually\nencounter a region of CTCs giving no first-cause. This region of CTCs, may well\nbe over by now (being bounded toward the future by a Cauchy horizon). We\nillustrate that such models --- with CTCs --- are not necessarily inconsistent\nby demonstrating self-consistent vacuums for Misner space and a multiply\nconnected de Sitter space in which the renormalized energy-momentum tensor does\nnot diverge as one approaches the Cauchy horizon and solves Einstein's\nequations. We show such a Universe can be classically stable and\nself-consistent if and only if the potentials are retarded, giving a natural\nexplanation of the arrow of time. Some specific scenarios (out of many possible\nones) for this type of model are described. For example: an inflationary\nuniverse gives rise to baby universes, one of which turns out to be itself.\nInterestingly, the laws of physics may allow the Universe to be its own mother.\n","Comment: 48 pages, 8 figures"]}]

It is found that under the synchro-resonance\ncondition in which the frequency of the GB is set equal to the frequency of the\nexpected HFRGWs (h~2.00*10^(-31), v_g=10^10Hz in the quintessential\ninflationary models (QIM) and h~6.32*10^(-31), v_g=10^10Hz in the pre-big bang\nscenario (PBBS) may produce the PPFs of ~4.04*10^2/s and ~1.27*10^3/s in a\nsurface of 100cm^2 area at the waist of the GB, respectively. The relatively\nweak first-order PPF, directed at right angles to the expected HFRGWs, is\nreflected by fractal membrane and the resulting reflected PPF (signal) exhibits\na very small decay in transit to the detector (tunable microwave receiver)\ncompared with the much stronger background photon flux, which allows for\ndetection of the reflected PPF with signal to background noise ratios greater\nthan one at the distance of the detector. We also discuss the selection\ncapability of system and directional sensitivity for the resonance components\nfrom the stochastic relic GW background. The resolution of tiny difference\nbetween the PPFs generated by the relic GWs in the QIM and in the PBBS may be\nestablished and will be of cosmological significance.

In\nparticular, the masses of the top (t) quark (M_t) and W boson constrain the\nmass of the long-hypothesized, but thus far not observed, Higgs boson. A\nprecise measurement of the top-quark mass can therefore point to where to look\nfor the Higgs, and indeed whether the hypothesis of a SM Higgs is consistent\nwith experimental data. Since top quarks are produced in pairs and decay in\nonly ~10^-24 s into various final states, reconstructing their mass from their\ndecay products is very challenging.

As a result, the most\nlikely Higgs mass increases from the experimentally excluded value of 96\nGeV/c^2 to 117 GeV/c^2, which is beyond current experimental sensitivity. The\nupper limit on the Higgs mass at 95% confidence level is raised from 219\nGeV/c^2 to 251 GeV/c^2.\n","Comment: For high-resolution version of figures, the article, as appeared in\n  Nature, and related News & Views, see\n  http://www-d0.fnal.gov/Run2Physics/top/public/public.html (8 pages, 4 color\n  figures)"]}]

In\nhigh-energy p-pbar collisions, such as at the Tevatron, bottom anti-bottom\nproduction can be schematically categorized into three mechanisms. The\nleading-order (LO) process is ``flavor creation,'' where both the bottom and\nanti-bottom quarks substantially participate in the hard scattering and result\nin a distinct back-to-back signal in final state. The ``flavor excitation'' and\nthe ``gluon splitting'' processes, which appear at next-leading-order (NLO),\nare known to make a comparable contribution to total bottom anti-bottom cross\nsection, while providing very different opening angle distributions from the LO\nprocess. An azimuthal opening angle between bottom and anti-bottom, Delta phi,\nhas been used for the correlation measurement to probe the interaction creating\nbottom anti-bottom pairs. The Delta phi distribution has been obtained from two\ndifferent methods. One method measures the Delta phi between bottom hadrons\nusing events with two reconstructed secondary vertex tags. The other method\nuses b-bbar --> (J/psi X)(l X') events, where the charged lepton (l) is an\nelectron or a muon, to measure Delta phi between bottom quarks. The bottom\nanti-bottom purity is determined as a function of Delta phi by fitting the\ndecay length of the J/psi and the impact parameter of the lepton. Both methods\nquantify the contribution from higher-order production mechanisms by the\nfraction of the b-bbar pairs produced in the same azimuthal hemisphere,\nf_toward.

We observe a strong\ndependence of $B_K$ on the prescription adopted for $g$ in the Wilson case,\ncontrary to the results of the Clover case which are almost unaffected by the\nchoice of $g$. Combining some recently obtained non perturbative estimates for\nthe renormalisation constants with our Clover matrix element, we observe a\nsignificant improvement in the chiral behaviour of $B_K$.\n","Comment: 3 pages, Latex, Postscript file with figures available at\n  ftp://hpteo.roma1.infn.it/pub/preprints/lat94/donini ; to appear in Lattice\n  '94, Nucl.

Using this method, all amplitudes for such decays can be expressed in\nterms of contractions, though the matrix elements are not evaluated. Many years\nago, Buras and Silvestrini proposed a similar approach. However, our technique\ngoes beyond theirs in several ways. First, we include recent theoretical and\nexperimental developments which indicate which contractions are negligible, and\nwhich are expected to be smaller than others. Second, we show that all B-decay\ndiagrams can be simply expressed in terms of contractions. This constitutes a\nformal proof that the diagrammatic method is rigourous. Third, we show that one\nreproduces the relations between tree and electroweak-penguin diagrams\ndescribed by Neubert and Rosner, and by Gronau, Pirjol and Yan. Fourth,\nalthough the previous results hold to all orders in alpha_s, we show that it is\nalso possible to work order-by-order in this approach. In this way it is\npossible to make a connection with the matrix-element evaluation methods of QCD\nfactorization (QCDfac) and perturbative QCD (pQCD). Finally, using the\ncontractions approach, we re-evaluate the question of whether there is a ``B ->\npi K puzzle.'' At O(alpha_s^0), we find that the diagram ratio |C'/T| is about\n0.17, a factor of 10 too small to explain all the B -> pi K data. Both QCDfac\nand pQCD find that, at O(\\alpha_s^1), the value of |C'/T'| may be raised to\nonly about 2-3 times its lowest-order value. We therefore conclude that,\nassuming the effect is not a statistical fluctuation, it is likely that the\nvalue of |C'/T'| is similar to its O(\\alpha_s^0) result, and that there really\nis a B -> pi K puzzle.\n","Comment: 33 pages, plain latex, 10 figures (included)"]}]

At each incident energy, the\ndoubly differential cross section was measured at three to five outgoing pion\nlaboratory angles between 25 deg and 130 deg. At each angle, cross sections\nwere measured over the range of outgoing pion energies from 10 MeV up to the\nkinematic limit for the reaction in which the final state consists of the\noppositely charged pion plus four free nucleons.\n  The spectra of outgoing pions are strikingly different from those observed\nfor the inclusive double charge exchange reaction in heavier nuclei, but\nresemble those observed in the (pi-,pi+) reaction in 3He. The forward-angle\nspectra in the 3He and 4He reactions exhibit a prominent peak at high outgoing\npion energies. Interpretation of the peaks in 3He (4He) as a three-\n(four-)nucleon resonance is ruled out by kinematic analysis. The results of a\ncalculation, wherein the double charge exchange reaction is assumed to proceed\nas two sequential single charge exchange interactions, suggest that the\nhigh-energy peak is naturally explained by this double scattering mechanism.\nNon-static treatment of the pi-N interactions and the inclusion of nuclear\nbinding effects appear to be important in reproducing the shape of the energy\nspectra at forward angles.\n","Comment: 59 pages, 22 figures, 2 tables"]}]

We\nrefer to these algorithms as wandering (or vintage Z_Q) Shor algorithms. They\nare essentially quantum algorithms on free abelian groups A of finite rank n\nwhich, with each iteration, first select a random cyclic direct summand Z of\nthe group A and then apply one iteration of the standard Shor algorithm to\nproduce a random character of the \"approximating\" finite group A=Z_Q, called\nthe group probe.
