The very basic consequence of such approach is\nthat contrary to the total variation, $TV^c$ is always finite. This is\nappealing to the stochastic analysis where so-far large classes of processes,\nlike semimartingales or diffusions, could not be studied with the total\nvariation. Recently in [6], another characterization of $TV^c$ was found.\nNamely $TV^c$ is the smallest total variation of a function which approximates\n$f$ uniformly with accuracy $c/2$. Due to these properties we envisage that\n$TV^c$ might be a useful concept to the theory of processes.\n  For this reason we determine some properties of $TV^c$ for some well-known\nprocesses. In course of our research we discover intimate connections with\nalready known concepts of the stochastic processes theory.\n  Firstly, for semimartingales we proved that $TV^c$ is of order $c^{-1}$ and\nthe normalized truncated variation converges almost surely to the quadratic\nvariation of the semimartingale as $c\\searrow0$. Secondly, we studied the rate\nof this convergence. As this task was much more demanding we narrowed to the\nclass of diffusions (with some mild additional assumptions).

This is a mathematical theory that was\nrecently developed within the context of the Schramm-Loewner evolution which\ndescribes the stochastic geometry of fractal curves and other stochastic\ngeometrical fractal objects in 2D space. Observables elucidating the connection\nwith the plateau transition include the so-called point-contact conductances\n(PCCs) between points on the boundary of the sample, described within the\nlanguage of the Chalker-Coddington network model. We show that the\ndisorder-averaged PCCs are characterized by classical probabilities for certain\ngeometric objects in the plane (pictures), occurring with positive statistical\nweights, that satisfy the crucial restriction property with respect to changes\nin the shape of the sample with absorbing boundaries. Upon combining this\nrestriction property with the expected conformal invariance at the transition\npoint, we employ the mathematical theory of conformal restriction measures to\nrelate the disorder-averaged PCCs to correlation functions of primary operators\nin a conformal field theory (of central charge $c=0$). We show how this can be\nused to calculate these functions in a number of geometries with various\nboundary conditions. Since our results employ only the conformal restriction\nproperty, they are equally applicable to a number of other critical disordered\nelectronic systems in 2D.

Aims.- We present a catalogue of nuclear activity, traced by\noptical emission lines, in a well-defined sample of the most isolated galaxies\nin the local Universe, which will be used as a basis for studying the effect of\nthe environment on nuclear activity. Methods.- We obtained spectral data from\nthe 6th Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which were inspected in a\nsemi-automatic way. We subtracted the underlying stellar populations from the\nspectra (using the software Starlight) and modelled the nuclear emission\nfeatures. Standard emission-line diagnostics diagrams were applied, using a new\nclassification scheme that takes into account censored data, to classify the\ntype of nuclear emission. Results.- We provide a final catalogue of\nspectroscopic data, stellar populations, emission lines and classification of\noptical nuclear activity for AMIGA galaxies. The prevalence of optical active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) in AMIGA galaxies is 20.4%, or 36.7% including transition\nobjects. The fraction of AGN increases steeply towards earlier morphological\ntypes and higher luminosities. We compare these results with a matched analysis\nof galaxies in isolated denser environments (Hickson Compact Groups). After\ncorrecting for the effects of the morphology and luminosity, we find that there\nis no evidence for a difference in the prevalence of AGN between isolated and\ncompact group galaxies, and we discuss the implications of this result.\nConclusions.- We find that a major interaction is not a necessary condition for\nthe triggering of optical AGN.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 11 figures, 12 tables, published in Astronomy and\n  Astrophysics.

The gas in\nthese galaxies is not in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium. Supernova feedback,\nstellar winds, or active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can significantly\nperturb the interstellar medium (ISM). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we\ninvestigate the effect of subsonic turbulence in the hot ISM on the ram\npressure stripping process in early-type galaxies. We find that galaxies with\nmore turbulent ISM produce longer, wider, and more smoothly distributed tails\nof the stripped ISM than those characterised by weaker ISM turbulence. Our main\nconclusion is that even very weak internal turbulence, at the level of <15% of\nthe average ISM sound speed, can significantly accelerate the gas removal from\ngalaxies via ram pressure stripping. The magnitude of this effect increases\nsharply with the strength of turbulence. As most of the gas stripping takes\nplace near the boundary between the ISM and the intraclustermedium (ICM), the\nboost in the ISM stripping rate is due to the \"random walk\" of the ISM from the\ncentral regions of the galactic potential well to larger distances, where the\nram pressure is able to permanently remove the gas from galaxies. The ICM can\nbe temporarily trapped inside the galactic potential well due to the mixing of\nthe turbulent ISM with the ICM.

Unreliability of synaptic transmission is a major source of neural\nvariability: synaptic neurotransmitter vesicles are released probabilistically\nin response to presynaptic spikes and are recovered stochastically in time. The\nstochastic dynamics of this process interacts with variability in the arrival\ntimes of presynaptic spikes to shape the variability of the postsynaptic\nresponse. We use continuous time Markov chain methods to analyze a model of\nshort term synaptic depression with stochastic vesicle dynamics coupled with\nthree different models of presynaptic spiking: one model in which the timing of\npresynaptic spikes are modeled as a Poisson process, one in which spikes occur\nmore regularly than a Poisson process and one in which spikes occur more\nirregularly. We use this analysis to investigate how variability in a\npresynaptic spike train is transformed by short term synaptic depression and\nstochastic vesicle dynamics to determine the variability of the postsynaptic\nresponse to a presynaptic spike train. We find that regular presynaptic spiking\nincreases the average rate at which vesicles are released, that the number of\nvesicles released over a time window is more variable for smaller time windows\nthan for larger time windows, and that fast presynaptic spiking gives rise to\nPoisson-like variability of the postsynaptic response even when presynaptic\nspike times are highly non-Poisson.

One important example\napplication is large scale similarity search, for which Locality Sensitive\nHashing (LSH) has emerged as the method of choice, specially when the data is\nhigh-dimensional. At its core, LSH is based on hashing the data points to a\nnumber of buckets such that similar points are more likely to map to the same\nbuckets. To guarantee high search quality, the LSH scheme needs a rather large\nnumber of hash tables.

The Entropy LSH scheme proposed\nby Panigrahy significantly reduces the number of required hash tables by\nlooking up a number of query offsets in addition to the query itself.

Working in the linear and spherical\napproximation, we find no Berry phase in $^1$C$_{60}^{2+}$, and\npresence/absence of Berry phase for coupling of one $L=2$ hole to an\n$L=4$/$L=2$ vibration. We study in particular the special equal-coupling case\n($g_2=g_4$), which is reduced to the motion of a particle on a 5-dimensional\nsphere. In the icosahedral molecule, the final outcome assesses the\npresence/absence of a Berry phase of $\\pi$ for the $h_u$ hole coupled to\n$G_g$/$H_h$ vibrations. Some qualitative consequences on ground-state symmetry,\nlow-lying excitations, and electron emission from C$_{60}$ are spelled out.\n","Comment: 31 pages (RevTeX), 3 Postscript figures (uuencoded)"]}]
