Broadly\nspeaking, super-resolution is the problem of recovering the fine details of an\nobject---the high end of its spectrum---from coarse scale information\nonly---from samples at the low end of the spectrum. Suppose we have many point\nsources at unknown locations in $[0,1]$ and with unknown complex-valued\namplitudes. We only observe Fourier samples of this object up until a frequency\ncut-off $f_c$. We show that one can super-resolve these point sources with\ninfinite precision---i.e. recover the exact locations and amplitudes---by\nsolving a simple convex optimization problem, which can essentially be\nreformulated as a semidefinite program. This holds provided that the distance\nbetween sources is at least $2/f_c$. This result extends to higher dimensions\nand other models. In one dimension for instance, it is possible to recover a\npiecewise smooth function by resolving the discontinuity points with infinite\nprecision as well. We also show that the theory and methods are robust to\nnoise.

Our study details how the antiferromagnetic order is suppressed\nupon Co substitution and how it coexists with superconductivity. In the\nnon-superconducting samples at 0 < x < 0.04 the antiferromagnetic order\nparameter is only moderately suppressed. With the onset of superconductivity\nthis suppression becomes faster and it is most rapid between x = 0.045 and\n0.05. As was previously demonstrated by muSR at x = 0.055 [P. Marsik et al.,\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 105, 57001 (2010)], the strongly weakened antiferromagnetic\norder is still a bulk phenomenon that competes with superconductivity. The\ncomparison with neutron diffraction data suggests that the antiferromagnetic\norder remains commensurate whereas the amplitude exhibits a spatial variation\nthat is likely caused by the randomly distributed Co atoms. A different kind of\nmagnetic order that was also previously identified [C. Bernhard et al., New J.\nPhys. 11, 055050 (2009)] occurs at 0.055 < x < 0.075 where Tc approaches the\nmaximum value. The magnetic order develops here only in parts of the sample\nvolume and it seems to cooperate with superconductivity since its onset\ntemperature coincides with Tc. Even in the strongly overdoped regime at x =\n0.11, where the static magnetic order has disappeared, we find that the low\nenergy spin fluctuations are anomalously enhanced below Tc. These findings\npoint toward a drastic change in the relationship between the magnetic and\nsuperconducting orders from a competitive one in the strongly underdoped regime\nto a constructive one in near optimally and overdoped samples.\n","Comment: 33 Pages, 9 Figures"]}]

The surface brightness estimates are based on\nconfirmed samples of M31 red giant branch stars derived from Keck/DEIMOS\nspectroscopic observations. A set of empirical spectroscopic and photometric\nM31 membership diagnostics is used to identify and reject foreground and\nbackground contaminants. This enables us to trace the stellar halo of M31 to\nlarger projected distances and fainter surface brightnesses than previous\nphotometric studies. The surface brightness profile of M31's halo follows a\npower-law with index -2.2 +/- 0.2 and extends to a projected distance of at\nleast ~175 kpc (~ 2/3 of M31's virial radius), with no evidence of a downward\nbreak at large radii. The best-fit elliptical isophotes have b/a=0.94 with the\nmajor axis of the halo aligned along the minor axis of M31's disk, consistent\nwith a prolate halo, although the data are also consistent with M31's halo\nhaving spherical symmetry. The fact that tidal debris features are\nkinematically cold is used to identify substructure in the spectroscopic fields\nout to projected radii of 90 kpc, and investigate the effect of this\nsubstructure on the surface brightness profile. The scatter in the surface\nbrightness profile is reduced when kinematically identified tidal debris\nfeatures in M31 are statistically subtracted; the remaining profile indicates a\ncomparatively diffuse stellar component to M31's stellar halo exists to large\ndistances. Beyond 90 kpc, kinematically cold tidal debris features can not be\nidentified due to small number statistics; nevertheless, the significant\nfield-to-field variation in surface brightness beyond 90 kpc suggests that the\noutermost region of M31's halo is also comprised to a significant degree of\nstars stripped from accreted objects.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ; v2 matches published version.

Through the Chapman-Enskog analysis, it is shown that in\nthe relativistic LB model the conservation equation of particle number is a\nconvection-diffusion equation rather than a continuity equation, which makes\nthe evolution of particle number dependent on the relaxation time. Furthermore,\nwe investigate the origin of the discontinuities appeared in the relativistic\nproblems with high viscosities, which were reported in a recent study [D. Hupp\net al., Phys. Rev.

Numerical experiments show the\ndiscontinuities can be eliminated by setting the relaxation time $\\tau_e$\n(related to the bulk viscosity) to be sufficiently smaller than the relaxation\ntime $\\tau_v$ (related to the shear viscosity). Meanwhile, it is found that the\nrelaxation time $\\tau_\\varepsilon$, which has no effect on the conservation\nequations at the Navier-Stokes level, will affect the numerical accuracy of the\nrelativistic LB model.

Of particular note is the\ncoupling of meta-heuristic search engines with user-provided evaluation and\nrating of solutions, usually in the form of Interactive Evolutionary Algorithms\n(IEAs). These have a well-documented history of successes, but arguably the\npreponderance of IEAs stems from this history, rather than as a conscious\ndesign choice of meta-heuristic based on the characteristics of the problem at\nhand. This paper sets out to examine the basis for that assumption, taking as a\ncase study the domain of interactive software design. We consider a range of\nfactors that should affect the design choice including ease of use,\nscalability, and of course, performance, i.e. that ability to generate good\nsolutions within the limited number of evaluations available in interactive\nwork before humans lose focus. We then evaluate three methods, namely greedy\nlocal search, an evolutionary algorithm and ant colony optimization, with a\nvariety of representations for candidate solutions. Results show that after\nsuitable parameter tuning, ant colony optimization is highly effective within\ninteractive search and out-performs evolutionary algorithms with respect to\nincreasing numbers of attributes and methods in the software design problem.\nHowever, when larger numbers of classes are present in the software design, an\nevolutionary algorithm using a naive grouping integer-based representation\nappears more scalable.\n","Comment: 31 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables"]}]

This\nfact is at odds with predictions based on linear public goods games under weak\nselection. That model implies fixation either of cooperators or of defectors,\nand the former scenario requires a level of group relatedness larger than the\ncost/benefit ratio, being therefore expected only if there is either kin\nrecognition or a very low cost/benefit ratio, or else under stringent\nconditions with low gene flow. This motivated us to study here social evolution\nin a large class of group structured populations, with arbitrary\nmulti-individual interactions among group members and random migration among\ngroups. Under the assumption of weak selection, we analyze the equilibria and\ntheir stability. For some significant models of social evolution with\nnon-linear fitness functions, including contingent behavior in iterated public\ngoods games and threshold models, we show that three regimes occur, depending\non the migration rate among groups. For sufficiently high migration rates, a\nrare cooperative allele A cannot invade a monomorphic population of asocial\nalleles N. For sufficiently low values of the migration rate, allele A can\ninvade the population, when rare, and then fixate, eliminating N. For\nintermediate values of the migration rate, allele A can invade the population,\nwhen rare, producing a polymorphic equilibrium, in which it coexists with N.\nThe equilibria and their stability do not depend on the details of the\npopulation structure. The levels of migration (gene flow) and group relatedness\nthat allow for invasion of the cooperative allele leading to polymorphic\nequilibria with the non-cooperative allele are common in nature.\n","Comment: 37 pages, 8 figures"]}]
