For in many scenarios it is\nnot feasible to use money to compensate agents for otherwise unsatisfactory\noutcomes. This paper studies this question, looking at both fairness and\nefficiency measures.\n  We employ the proportionally fair solution, which is a well-known fairness\nconcept for money-free settings. But although finding a proportionally fair\nsolution is computationally tractable, it cannot be implemented in a truthful\nfashion. Consequently, we seek approximate solutions. We give several truthful\nmechanisms which achieve proportional fairness in an approximate sense. We use\na strong notion of approximation, requiring the mechanism to give each agent a\ngood approximation of its proportionally fair utility. In particular, one of\nour mechanisms provides a better and better approximation factor as the minimum\ndemand for every good increases.

Existing reinforcement learning algorithms provide strong\nexploration guarantees, but they tend to rely on an ergodicity assumption. The\nessence of ergodicity is that any state is eventually reachable from any other\nstate by following a suitable policy. This assumption allows for exploration\nalgorithms that operate by simply favoring states that have rarely been visited\nbefore. For most physical systems this assumption is impractical as the systems\nwould break before any reasonable exploration has taken place, i.e., most\nphysical systems don't satisfy the ergodicity assumption.

We show that\nimposing safety by restricting attention to the resulting set of guaranteed\nsafe policies is NP-hard.

At the core is an optimization\nformulation in which the constraints restrict attention to a subset of the\nguaranteed safe policies and the objective favors exploration policies.

The topology of\nthe model requires that motion of all galaxies and light must be confined\ninside a spherical shell. Consequently the observable universe cannot be\ndefined as a sphere centered on the observer, rather it is an arc length within\nthe volume of the spherical shell. The radius of the shell is 4.46 $\\pm$ 0.06\nGpc, which is for factor $\\pi$ smaller than radius of a corresponding 3-sphere.\nHowever the event horizon, defined as the arc length inside the shell, has the\nsize of 14.0 $\\pm$ 0.2 Gpc, which is in agreement with the observable data. The\nmodel predicts, without inflation theory, the isotropy and uniformity of the\nCMB. It predicts the correct value for the Hubble constant $H_0$ = 67.26 $\\pm$\n0.90 km/s/Mpc, the cosmic expansion rate $H(z)$, and the speed of the event\nhorizon in agreement with observations. The theoretical suport for shell model\ncomes from general relativity, curvature of space by mass, and from holographic\nprinciple. The model explains the reason for the established discrepancy\nbetween the non-covariant version of the holographic principle and the\ncalculated dimensionless entropy $(S/k)$ for the visible universe, which\nexceeds the entropy of a black hole. The model is in accordance with the\ndistribution of radio sources in space, type Ia data, and data from the Hubble\nUltra Deep Field optical and near-infrared survey.\n","Comment: 7 pages 2 figures, Conference: Low Dimensional Physics and Gauge\n  Principles, Yerevan, Armenaia, September 21-26, 2011"]}]

This idea has recently come into the reach of the established\ndomain of silicon technology, leading to the realization of single-atom\ntransistors and to the first measurements of electron spin dynamics in single\ndonors. Here we show that we can electrically couple two donors embedded in a\nmulti-gate silicon transistor, and induce coherent oscillations in their charge\nstates by means of microwave signals. We measure single-electron tunneling\nacross the two donors, which reveals their energy spectrum. The lowest energy\nstates, corresponding to a single electron located on either of the two donors,\nform a two-level system (TLS) well separated from all other electronic levels.\nGigahertz driving of this TLS results in a quantum interference pattern\nassociated with the absorption or the stimulated emission of up to ten\nmicrowave photons. We estimate a charge dephasing time of 0.3 nanoseconds,\nconsistent with other types of charge quantum bits. Here, however, the\nrelatively short coherence time can be counterbalanced by fast operation\nsignals (in principle up to 1 terahertz) as allowed by the large empty energy\nwindow separating ground and excited states in donor atoms.

The EPR-Bell paradox consists in the problem that we\nobserve correlations between spatially separated events in the EPR-experiments,\nwhich do not admit common-cause-type explanation; and it must therefore be\ninevitably concluded, that, contrary to relativity theory, in the realm of\nquantum physics there exists action at a distance, or at least superluminal\ncausal propagation is possible; that is, either relativity theory or\nReichenbach's common cause principle fails. By means of closer analyses of the\nconcept of common cause and a more precise reformulation of the EPR\nexperimental scenario, I will sharpen the conclusion we can draw from the\nviolation of Bell's inequalities.

The main aspects of this extension are: One assumes a\nhyperparameter space $\\Phi$ common to several potential experiments, and a\nbasic symmetry group G associated with this space. The parameter \\theta_{a} of\na single experiment, looked upon as a parametric function $\\theta_{a}(\\cdot)$\non $\\Phi$, is said to be permissible if G induces in a natural way a new group\non the image space of the function. If this is not the case, it is arranged for\nby changing from G to a subgroup $G_{a}$. The Haar measure of this subgroup\n(confined to the spectrum; see below) is the prefered prior when the parameter\nis unknown. It is assumed that the hyperparameter itself can never be\nestimated, only a set of parametric functions. Model reduction is made by\nrestricting the space of complex `wave' functions, also regarded as functions\non $\\Phi$, to an irreducible invariant subspace $\\mathcal{M}$ under G. The\nspectrum of a parametric function is defined from natural group-theoretical and\nstatistical considerations. We establish that a unique operator can be\nassociated with every parametric functions $\\theta_{a}(\\cdot)$, and essentially\nall of the ordinary quantum theory formalism can be retrieved from these and a\nfew related assumptions. In particular the concept of spectrum is consistent.\nThe scope of the theory is illustrated on the one hand by the example of a spin\n1/2 particle and a related EPR discussion, on the other hand by a simple\nmacroscopic example.\n","Comment: The paper has been withdrawn because it is outdated"]}]
