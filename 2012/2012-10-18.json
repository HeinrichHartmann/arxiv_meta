Furthermore,\nthe i - K_s color distributions of BALQSOs and non-BALQSOs indicate that\nBALQSOs are redder than non-BALQSOs, with a K-S test probability of 2e-12.\nThese results are consistent with the spectral difference between BALQSOs and\nnon-BALQSOs including both the absorption troughs and dust extinction in\nBALQSOs, which leads to significant selection biases against BALQSOs in the\noptical bands.

However, it remains\ndifficult to increase the number of channels per node, thus the maximal degree\nof the network may be bounded.

In this paper, we address\nthe following issue: if each node is likely to fail in an unpredictable manner,\nhow can we preserve some global reliability guarantees when the number of nodes\nkeeps increasing unboundedly ? To be more specific, we consider the problem or\nreliably broadcasting information on an asynchronous grid in the presence of\nByzantine failures -- that is, some nodes may have an arbitrary and potentially\nmalicious behavior. Our requirement is that a constant fraction of correct\nnodes remain able to achieve reliable communication. Existing solutions can\nonly tolerate a fixed number of Byzantine failures if they adopt a worst-case\nplacement scheme. Besides, if we assume a constant Byzantine ratio (each node\nhas the same probability to be Byzantine), the probability to have a fatal\nplacement approaches 1 when the number of nodes increases, and reliability\nguarantees collapse. In this paper, we propose the first broadcast protocol\nthat overcomes these difficulties. First, the number of Byzantine failures that\ncan be tolerated (if they adopt the worst-case placement) now increases with\nthe number of nodes. Second, we are able to tolerate a constant Byzantine\nratio, however large the grid may be. In other words, the grid becomes\nscalable.

Therefore, the scheduling problem\nrequires to re-execute or replicate tasks (i.e., execute twice a same task,\neither on the same processor, or on two distinct processors), in order to\nincrease the reliability.

Hence, we\nintroduce BH having a twofold scope, thus: on the one hand, it implies new\ncomputational models, while on the other hand we aim at understanding life not\nby what it is, but rather by what it does. From a computational point of view,\nlife hypercomputes. At the end we sketch out the possibilities, stances and\nreach of BH. The aim of BH is basically help understanding life from a\ncomputational standpoint.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 2 figures, Paper Accpeted at 2nd International Conference\n  on Complex Sciences: Theory and Applications (Complex 2012), Santa fe, New\n  Mexico, U.S.A., Dec. 5-7, 2012"]}]

The mathematical heart of the matter involves the\nbehavior of a divergence-form elliptic equation in the plane, $\\nabla\\cdot\n(a(x)\\nabla u(x)) = f(x)$. The complex-valued coefficient has a\nmatrix-shell-core geometry, with real part equal to 1 in the matrix and the\ncore, and -1 in the shell; one is interested in understanding the resonant\nbehavior of the solution as the imaginary part of $a(x)$ decreases to zero (so\nthat ellipticity is lost). Most analytical work in this area has relied on\nseparation of variables, and has therefore been restricted to radial\ngeometries. We introduce a new approach based on a pair of dual variational\nprinciples, and apply it to some non-radial examples.

Previous work has shown that shaping is particularly effective when\nused with coded amplitude phase-shift keying (APSK), a modulation that has been\npopularized recently due to its inclusion in the DVB-S2 standard. While shaped\nAPSK can provide significant gains when used with standard off-the-shelf LDPC\ncodes, such as the codes in the DVB-S2 standard, additional non-negligible\ngains can be achieved by optimizing the LDPC code with respect to the shaped\nAPSK modulation. In this paper, we optimize the degree distributions of the\nLDPC code used in conjunction with shaped APSK. The optimization process is an\nextension of the EXIT-chart technique of ten Brink, et al., which has been\nadapted to account for the shaped APSK modulation. We begin by constraining the\ncode to have the same number of distinct variable-node degrees as the codes in\nthe DVB-S2 standard, and show that the optimization provides 32-APSK systems\nwith an additional coding gain of 0.34 dB at a system rate of R=3 bits per\nsymbol, compared to shaped systems that use the long LDPC code from the DVB-S2\nstandard. We then increase the number of allowed variable node degrees by one,\nand find that an additional 0.1 dB gain is achievable.\n","Comment: To appear at ICNC-2013"]}]
