We\nconsider two different models of the primordial power spectrum. The first is\nthe standard nearly scale-invariant spectrum in the form of a generalised\npower-law parameterised in terms of the spectral amplitude $A_{\\rm s}$, the\nspectral index $n_{\\rm s}$ and (possibly) the running parameter $n_{\\rm run}$.\nThe second spectrum is derived from the Lasenby and Doran (LD) model. The LD\nmodel is based on the restriction of the total conformal time available in a\nclosed Universe and the predicted primordial power spectrum depends upon just\ntwo parameters. An important feature of the LD spectrum is that it naturally\nincorporates an exponential fall-off on large scales, which might provide a\npossible explanation for the lower-than-expected power observed at low\nmultipoles in the CMB. In addition to parameter estimation, we compare both\nmodels using Bayesian model selection.

After subtraction of the model, the residuals\nshowed an approximate linear upward trend after 1942.

The warming observed before 1942 is\nrelatively small and it is assumed to have been mostly naturally induced by a\nclimatic recovery since the Little Ice Age of the 17th century and the Dalton\nMinimum at the beginning of the 19th century.

New solar activity proxy models are developed that suggest a mechanism\nfor both the 60-year climate cycle and a portion of the long-term warming\ntrend.

For the stellar core collapse simulation, we present the\nlatest numerical results. We employed a purely nucleonic EOS (Shen-EOS). As an\ninitial condition, we adopted a 100 $M_{\\odot}$ presupernova model calculated\nby Umeda and Nomoto. Changing the degree of rotation for the initial condition,\nwe clarify the strong dependence of the outcome of the collapse on this. When\nthe rotation is rapid enough, the shock wave formed at the core bounce is\ndeformed to be a torus-like shape. Then, the infalling matter is accumulated in\nthe central region due to the oblique shock at the torus surface, hitting the\nPNS and dissipating the kinetic energy there. As a result, outflows can be\nlaunched. The PNS eventually collapses to a BH and an accretion torus is formed\naround it. We also found that the evolution of the BH and torus depends\nstrongly on the rotation initially given. In the BNS merger simulations, we in\naddition employ an EOS incorporating a degree of freedom for hyperons. The\nnumerical simulations show that for the purely nucleonic EOS, a HMNS with a\nlong lifetime ($\\gg 10$ ms) is the outcome for the total mass $M \\lesssim\n3.0M_{\\odot}$. By contrast, the formed HMNS collapses to a BH in a shorter time\nscale with the hyperonic EOS for $M \\gtrsim 2.7M_{\\odot}$. It is shown that the\ntypical total neutrino luminosity of the HMNS is $\\sim 3$--$10\\times 10^{53}$\nergs/s and the effective amplitude of gravitational waves from the HMNS is\n2--$6 \\times 10^{-22}$ at $f\\approx 2$--2.5 kHz for a source distance of 100\nMpc.\n","Comment: 59 pages, 25 figures with very low resolution, survey accepted for\n  publication in a launch issue of Progress of Theoretical and Experimental\n  Physics"]}]

On the extended configuration\nspace M for classical field theory composed of spacetime and field\nconfiguration space, one can define a geometrical structure called Kawaguchi\nareal metric K from the field Lagrangian and (M,K) can be regarded as Kawaguchi\nmanifold. The geometrical action functional is given by K and the dynamics of\nfield is determined by covariant Euler-Lagrange equation derived from the\nvariational principle of the action. The solution to the equation becomes a\nminimal hypersurface on (M,K) which has the same dimension as spacetime. We\npropose that this hypersurface is what we should regard as our real spacetime\nmanifold, while the usual way to understand spacetime is to consider it as the\nparameter spacetime (base manifold) of a fibre bundle. In this way, the\ndynamics of field and spacetime structure is unified by Kawaguchi geometry. The\ntheory has the property of strong covariance, which means that it allows one to\nchoose arbitrary parameter spacetime from the total extended configuration\nspace. In other words, we can take more wider class of coordinate\ntransformations such that mix spacetime and field variables which are forbidden\nto be exchanged in conventional formalism.

So far, this conjecture has almost\nexclusively been stated and proved for compact Lie groups $G$ acting on compact\nsymplectic manifolds, and, largely due to the use of spin_c Dirac operator\ntechniques, has reached a high degree of perfection under these compactness\nassumptions. In this paper we formulate an appropriate Guillemin-Sternberg\nconjecture in the general case, under the main assumptions that the Lie group\naction is proper and cocompact. This formulation is motivated by our\ninterpretation of the \"quantisation commuates with reduction\" phenomenon as a\nspecial case of the functoriality of quantisation, and uses equivariant\nK-homology and the K-theory of the group C*-algebra C*(G) in a crucial way. For\nexample, the equivariant index - which in the compact case takes values in the\nrepresentation ring R(G) - is replaced by the analytic assembly map - which\ntakes values in K_0(C*(G)) - familiar from the Baum-Connes conjecture in\nnoncommutative geometry. Under the usual freeness assumption on the action, we\nprove our conjecture for all Lie groups G having a cocompact discrete normal\nsubgroup, but we believe it is valid for all unimodular Lie groups.\n","Comment: 55 pages, small corrections and additions after referee reports,\n  Appendix A shortened, Appendix B replaced by reference"]}]
