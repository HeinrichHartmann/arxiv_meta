A possible correlation between the\nmass of SMBHs and the evolutionary state of their host galaxies is expected.\nBased on the recent 2D decomposition of mid-infrared Spiter/IRAC images of\nlocal galaxies with M_bh measurements, we investigated various scaling laws,\nstudying what the best predictor of the mass of the central SMBHs is. We\nfocused on the M_bh-M_G sigma^2 law, the relation between the mass of SMBHs and\nthe kinetic energy of random motions of the corresponding host galaxies. In\norder to find the best fit for each of the scaling laws examined, we performed\na least-squares regression of M_bh on x for the considered sample of galaxies,\nx being a whatever known parameter of the galaxy bulge. Our analysis shows that\nM_bh-M_G sigma^2 law fits the examined experimental data successfully as much\nas the other known scaling laws and shows a value of chi^2 better than the\nothers, a result which is consistent with previous determinations. This means\nthat a combination of sigma and M_G could be necessary to drive the\ncorrelations between M_bh and other bulge properties. This issue has been\ninvestigated by a careful analysis of the residuals of the various relations.\nIn order to avoid rushed conclusions on galaxy activity and evolution, the\nindirect inferring of M_bh from the kinetic energy of random motions should be\nconsidered, especially when applied to higher redshift galaxies. This statement\nis suggested by a reanalysis of the SDSS data used to study the SMBH growth in\nthe nearby Universe.

Here we\nperform a detailed calculation aimed at quantifying the signatures of\nphoton-axion conversion in the spectra, light curves, and polarization of\nneutron stars (NSs). We take into account the energy and angle-dependence of\nthe conversion probability and the surface thermal emission from NSs. The\nlatter is computed from magnetized atmosphere models that include the effect of\nphoton polarization mode conversion due to vacuum polarization. The resulting\nspectral models, inclusive of the general-relativistic effects of gravitational\nredshift and light deflection, allow us to make realistic predictions for the\neffects of photon to axion conversion on observed NS spectra, light curves, and\npolarization signals. We identify unique signatures of the conversion, such as\nan increase of the effective area of a hot spot as it rotates away from the\nobserver line of sight. For a star emitting from the entire surface, the\nconversion produces apparent radii that are either larger or smaller (depending\non axion mass and coupling strength) than the limits set by NS equations of\nstate. For an emission region that is observed phase-on, photon-axion\nconversion results in an inversion of the plane of polarization with respect to\nthe no-conversion case. While the quantitative details of the features that we\nidentify depend on NS properties (magnetic field strength, temperature) and\naxion parameters, the spectral and polarization signatures induced by\nphoton-axion conversion are distinctive enough to make NSs very interesting and\npromising probes of axion physics.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 9 figures, accepted to ApJ"]}]

The application of Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) as an\nefficient approach for the minimization of Disjoint Sums-of-Products (DSOPs).\nDSOPs are a starting point for several applications. The use of BDDs has the\nadvantage of an implicit representation of terms.

Theoretical studies on the influence of the BDDs to the search space\nare carried out.

A sample of early B-type stars in OB associations and the field within\nthe solar neighbourhood is studied comprehensively.

The constraints on cosmological parameters derived\nfrom data of SNe Ia and the measurements of the cosmic microwave background\nanisotropies indicate that the dark energy amounts to roughly 70% of all the\nenergy contained in the Universe. In the hypothesis of a flat Universe, we\ninvestigate if the dark energy is really required in order to explain the SNe\nIa experimental data, and, in this case, how much of such unknown energy is\nactually deduced from the analysis of these data and must be introduced in the\nLambdaCDM model of cosmology.
