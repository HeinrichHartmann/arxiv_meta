Three alternative\nways in which the outer surface of the thick pipe might be stabilized\nconsistent with the observed value of the effective d = 4 cosmological constant\nare considered. In the first alternative, the outer surface is stabilized in\nthe classical region and the constant of integration is fixed at around 10^{13}\nin units of the d = 11 gravitational length for consistency with the observed\ncosmological constant.

Our theory sheds new light on\nthe magnitude of cross sections for scattering and extinction, and for instance\non the emergence of structural chirality in the optical response of\ngeometrically non-chiral scatterers like SRRs. We apply the model to SRRs and\ndiscuss how to extract individual components of the polarizability matrix and\nextinction cross sections. Finally, we show that our model describes well the\nextinction of stereo-dimers of split rings, while providing new insights in the\nunderlying coupling mechanisms.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 3 figures"]}]

The\nmotivation comes from the fact that super magnetized neutron stars of $\\sim\n10^{15}$G, magnetars, and magnetized proto-neutron stars born after the\nmagnetically-driven supernovae are likely to have such strong toroidal magnetic\nfields. Long-term, three-dimensional general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic\nsimulations are performed, preparing isentropic neutron stars with toroidal\nmagnetic fields in equilibrium as initial conditions. To explore the effects of\nrotations on the stability, simulations are done for both non-rotating and\nrigidly rotating models. We find the emergence of the Parker and/or Tayler\ninstabilities in both the non-rotating and rotating models. For both\nnon-rotating and rotating models, the Parker instability is the primary\ninstability as predicted by the local linear perturbation analysis. The\ninterchange instability also appears in the rotating models. It is found that\nrapid rotation is not enough to suppress the Parker instability, and this\nfinding does not agree with the perturbation analysis. The reason for this is\nthat rigidly and rapidly rotating stars are marginally stable, and hence, in\nthe presence of stellar pulsations by which the rotational profile is deformed,\nunstable regions with negative gradient of angular momentum profile is\ndeveloped. After the onset of the instabilities, a turbulence is excited.\nContrary to the axisymmetric case, the magnetic fields never reach an\nequilibrium state after the development of the turbulence.

It is shown what solution exists if the\ninteraction between the particles is repulsive. Particle concentration of order\nof $10^{12}$-$10^{14}$ $cm^{-3}$ has been achieved experimentally for the BEC,\nthe solution exists if the scattering length is of the order of 1 $\\mu$m, which\ncan be reached using the Feshbach resonance.

For star-forming galaxies (sBzKs), the UV-based SFR, corrected for\nextinction, scales with the stellar mass as SFR ~ M_{*}^{alpha} with alpha =\n0.74+/-0.20 down to M_{*} ~ 10^{9} M_{solar}, indicating a weak dependence on\nthe stellar mass of the SSFR. We also measure the angular correlation function\nand hence infer the correlation length for sBzK galaxies as a function of\nM_{*}, SFR, and SSFR, as well as K-band apparent magnitude. We show that\npassive galaxies (pBzKs) are more strongly clustered than sBzK galaxies at a\ngiven stellar mass, mirroring the color-density relation seen at lower\nredshifts. We also find that the correlation length of sBzK galaxies ranges\nfrom 4 to 20 h^{-1}Mpc, being a strong function of M_{K}, M_{*}, and SFR.

We contribute two further modifications\nto the theory, one to account for the fact that different loci in a genotype\nmay be differently susceptible to the occurrence of mutations, the other to\nallow for a more plausible description of the transition from adaptation to\ndegeneracy of the quasispecies as p is increased. We give analytical and\nsimulation results for the usual case of binary genotypes, assuming the fitness\nlandscape in which a genotype's fitness decays exponentially with its Hamming\ndistance to the wild type. These results support the theory's assertions\nregarding the adaptation of the quasispecies to the fitness landscape and also\nits possible demise as a function of p.\n"]}]

We find dark matter inside the star would soften the equation of\nstate more strongly than that of hyperons, and reduce largely the maximum mass\nof the star. However, the neutron star maximum mass is sensitive to the\nparticle mass of dark matter, and a very high neutron star mass larger than 2\ntimes solar mass could be achieved when the particle mass is small enough. Such\nkind of dark-matter- admixed neutron stars could explain the recent measurement\nof the Shapiro delay in the radio pulsar PSR J1614-2230, which yielded a\nneutron star mass of 2 times solar mass that may be hardly reached when\nhyperons are considered only, as in the case of the microscopic Brueckner\ntheory.

In the ever evolving world of dynamic and on-line data, there\nis also a need for developing solutions to index texts which arrive on-line,\ni.e. a character at a time, and still be able to quickly locate said patterns.\nIn this paper, a new solution for on-line indexing is presented by providing an\non-line suffix tree construction in $O(\\log \\log n + \\log\\log |\\Sigma|)$\nworst-case expected time per character, where $n$ is the size of the string,\nand $\\Sigma$ is the alphabet.

The classification of\ncancer progression using discrete states like stages and hallmarks has become\ncommon in the biology literature, but primarily as an organizing principle, and\nnot as an executable formalism. The precise computational model developed here\naims to exploit this untapped potential, namely, through automatic verification\nof progression models (e.g., consistency, causal connections, etc.),\nclassification of unreachable or unstable states and computer-generated\n(individualized or universal) therapy plans. The paper builds on a\nphenomenological approach, and as such does not need to assume a model for the\nbiochemistry of the underlying natural progression.

Yet, very little\nhas previously been known about the thermal inertia of small asteroids\nincluding NEAs. Observational and theoretical work is reported. The thermal\nemission of asteroids has been observed in the mid-infrared (5-35 {\\mu}m)\nwavelength range using the Spitzer Space Telescope and the 3.0m IRTF. A\ndetailed thermophysical model (TPM) has been developed and extensively tested;\nthis is the first detailed TPM shown to be applicable to NEA data.

For two of our\ntargets, previously available estimates are refined. Our results allow the\nfirst determination of the typical thermal inertia of NEAs, which is around 300\nJ s^{-1/2} K^{-1} m^{-2}, larger than the typical thermal inertia of large\nmain-belt asteroids (MBAs) by more than an order of magnitude.

Using this as motivation,\nwe study the evolution of cooperation in games that describe social dilemmas,\nwhere the propensity to adopt a different strategy depends both on individual\nfitness as well as on the strategies of neighbors. Regardless of whether the\nevolutionary process is governed by pairwise or group interactions, we show\nthat plugging into the \"wisdom of groups\" strongly promotes cooperative\nbehavior. The more the wider knowledge is taken into account the more the\nevolution of defectors is impaired. We explain this by revealing a dynamically\ndecelerated invasion process, by means of which interfaces separating different\ndomains remain smooth and defectors therefore become unable to efficiently\ninvade cooperators. This in turn invigorates spatial reciprocity and\nestablishes decentralized decision making as very beneficial for resolving\nsocial dilemmas.\n","Comment: 8 two-column pages, 7 figures; accepted for publication in Scientific\n  Reports"]}]

Three-dimensional Finite-Difference Time-Domain\ncalculations show over 7 times inhibition and 15 times enhancement of the\nemission rate compared to the vacuum emission rate for judiciously oriented and\npositioned dipoles. The vertical index confinement in membranes strongly\nenhances modifications of the emission rate as compared to vertically\nunconfined 2D photonic crystals. The emission rate modifications inside the\nmembrane mimic the local electric field mode density in a simple 2D model. The\ninhibition of emission saturates exponentially as the crystal size around the\nsource is increased, with a $1/e$ length that is inversely proportional to the\nbandwidth of the emission gap. We obtain inhibition of emission only close to\nthe slab center. However, enhancement of emission persists even outside the\nmembrane, with a distance dependence which dependence can be understood by\nanalyzing the contributions to the spontaneous emission rate of the different\nvertically guided modes of the membrane.
