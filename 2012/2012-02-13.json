We consider the problem of\nbuilding a shared multicast tree spanning the destination nodes such that the\ntotal energy consumption of realizing an all-to-all multicast session using the\nshared multicast tree is minimized. Since building such a multicast tree has\nbeen proved to be NP-complete, we provide both centralized and distributed\napproximation algorithms with provable approximation ratios for it. When the\ntransmission power of each wireless node is fixed, our centralized and\ndistributed algorithms have the approximation ratios of $4ln(\\Delta+1)+7$ and\n13, respectively, where $\\Delta$ is the maximum node degree in the network.\nWhen the transmission power of each wireless node is adjustable, both of our\ncentralized and distributed algorithms have the constant approximation ratio of\n145.\n","Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to new graphs"]}]

These existing measures suggest specific attribute of an\nactor (i.e., popularity, accessibility, and brokerage behavior). In this study,\nwe propose new hybrid centrality measures (i.e., Degree-Degree,\nDegree-Closeness and Degree-Betweenness), by combining existing measures (i.e.,\ndegree, closeness and betweenness) with a proposition to better understand the\nimportance of actors in a given network. Generalized set of measures are also\nproposed for weighted networks. Our analysis of co-authorship networks dataset\nsuggests significant correlation of our proposed new centrality measures\n(especially weighted networks) than traditional centrality measures with\nperformance of the scholars. Thus, they are useful measures which can be used\ninstead of traditional measures to show prominence of the actors in a network.\n","Comment: a short version accepted in the 3rd workshop on Complex Network [Full\n  Paper submitted to JASIST in April 2011]"]}]

To explain\nthe two-peaks in the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the nucleus of M87\nwhich is similar to those of blazars, the most commonly adopted models are the\nsynchrotron self-Compton scattering (SSC) models and the external inverse\nCompton scattering (EIC) models. Considering that there is no correlated\nvariation in the soft band (from radio to X-ray) matching the TeV variation,\nand the TeV sources should not suffer from the gamma-gamma absorption due to\nthe flat TeV spectrum, the EIC models are advantageous in modeling the TeV\nemission from M87. In this paper, we propose a self-consistent EIC model to\nexplain the flat TeV spectrum of M87 within the framework of fully general\nrelativity, where the background soft photons are from the advection-dominated\naccretion flow (ADAF) around the central black hole, and the high energy\nelectrons are from the mini-jets which are powered by the magnetic reconnection\nin the main jet (Giannios et al. 2010). In our model, both the TeV flares\nobserved in the years of 2005 and 2008 could be well explained: the gamma-gamma\nabsorption for TeV photons is very low, even inside the region very close to\nthe black hole 20Rg~50Rg; at the same region, the average EIC cooling time (~\n10^2-10^3s) is short, which is consistent with the observed time scale of TeV\nvariation. Furthermore, we also discuss the possibility that the accompanying\nX-ray flare in 2008 is due to the direct synchrotron radiation of the\nmini-jets.\n","Comment: ApJ accepted, 9 pages and 4 figures"]}]

In order to realize an optimum gamma-focal spot, a\nrefractive gamma-lens consisting of a stack of many concave micro-lenses will\nbe used.

For photonuclear reactions with a narrow gamma beam, the\nenergy deposition in the target can be reduced by using a stack of thin target\nwires, hence avoiding direct stopping of the Compton electrons and e^+e^-\npairs. The well-defined initial excitation energy of the compound nucleus leads\nto a small number of reaction channels and enables new combinations of target\nisotope and final radioisotope.
