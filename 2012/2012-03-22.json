This is in\ncontrast to previous results reported in optimally doped La1111 with Tc=28 K\nwhere a lack of the HS peak was reported. It indicates that the interband\nscattering between the hole and electron FSs is strongly suppressed by an\nalmost vanishing hole FS through the heavily electron-overdoping.

In this paper we discuss how this breakdown of thermodynamic\nequilibrium could be detected in microarray experiments without resorting to\nreal time hybridization data, which are difficult to implement in standard\nexperimental conditions. The method is based on the analysis of the\ndistribution of fluorescence intensities I from different spots for probes\ncarrying base mismatches. In thermal equilibrium and at sufficiently low\nconcentrations, log I is expected to be linearly related to the hybridization\nfree energy $\\Delta G$ with a slope equal to $1/RT_{exp}$, where $T_{exp}$ is\nthe experimental temperature and R is the gas constant. The breakdown of\nequilibrium results in the deviation from this law. A model for hybridization\nkinetics explaining the observed experimental behavior is discussed, the\nso-called 3-state model. It predicts that deviations from equilibrium yield a\nproportionality of $\\log I$ to $\\Delta G/RT_{eff}$. Here, $T_{eff}$ is an\neffective temperature, higher than the experimental one. This behavior is\nindeed observed in some experiments on Agilent arrays.

Each receiver can zero-force the unintended user's Alamouti codes and\ndecouple its own data streams using two simple linear operations independent of\nCSIR. Analysis shows that the proposed scheme achieves a diversity gain of\n2(N-1) for equal energy constellations with short-term power and rate\nconstraints. Power allocation between two users can also be performed, and it\nimproves the array gain but not the diversity gain.

However, with the\nintervention of an external noise, a viscous friction like property emerges;\nthus the sphere rolls with an uniform drift velocity that is proportional to\nthe applied field. As the sphere rolls, it rocks forward and backward resulting\nin substantial fluctuation of displacement opposite to the net drift. The ratio\nof the integrated probabilities of the negative to positive work fluctuations\ndecreases monotonically with the time of observation, from which a temperature\nlike intensive parameter can be estimated. This parameter conforms to the\nEinstein's ratio of diffusivity and mobility that increases almost linearly,\neven though the diffusivity increases super-linearly, with the strength of the\nnoise. A new barrier crossing experiment is introduced that can be performed\neither with a hard (e.g. a steel ball) or with a soft (e.g. a water drop)\nsphere in contact with a periodically undulated substrate. The frequency of\nbarrier crossing follows the classical transition state equation allowing a\ndirect estimation of the effective temperature. These experiments as well as\ncertain numerical simulations suggest that the effective temperature of a\nsystem controlled by a non-linear friction may not have a unique value.\n"]}]

The measured pair production probabilities span over five orders of\nmagnitude from the $\\pi^0$-Dalitz to the $\\rho/\\omega$ invariant-mass region.\nDalitz decays of $\\pi^0$ and $\\eta$ account for all the yield up to 0.15\nGeV/c$^2$, but for only about 50% above this mass.
