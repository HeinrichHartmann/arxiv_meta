Asset backed securities have been\nextensively criticised for creating a moral hazard in loan issuance and an\nassociated increase in default risk, by removing the immediate lender's\nincentive to ensure that the underlying loans could be repaid. However\nsignificant monetary issues can accompany any form of increased commercial bank\nlending, and these appear to have been overlooked by this analysis. In this\npaper we propose a general explanation for credit crises based on an\nexamination of the mechanics of the banking system, and in particular its\ninternal controls on the supply of credit. We suggest that the current credit\ncrisis is the result of multiple failures in the Basel regulatory framework,\nincluding the removal of central bank reserve requirements from some classes of\ndeposit accounts within the banking system, allowing financial instruments\nrepresenting debt to be used as regulatory capital, and in particular the\nintroduction of securitized lending which effectively removed a previously\nimplicit control over the total quantity of lending originating from the\nbanking system. We further argue that the interaction of these problems has led\nto a destabilising imbalance between total money and loan supply growth, in\nthat total lending sourced from the commercial bank sector increased at a\nfaster rate than accompanying growth in the money supply. This not only created\na multi-decade macro-economic debt spiral, but by increasing the ratio of debt\nto money within the monetary system acted to increase the risk of loan\ndefaults, and consequentially reduce the overall stability of the banking\nsystem.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 6 figures, Accepted for Publication in Advances in Complex\n  Systems, August 2nd 2012"]}]

For any finite number of messages, a single-letter characterization of\nthe sum-rate-distortion function was established in previous works using\nstandard information-theoretic techniques.

In\nthis paper, the infinite-message sum-rate-distortion function, viewed as a\nfunctional of the joint source pmf and the distortion levels, is characterized\nas the least element of a partially ordered family of functionals having\ncertain convex-geometric properties. The new characterization does not involve\nevaluating the infinite-message limit of a finite-message sum-rate-distortion\nexpression.

As with the $Z_2$ form of L. de'Medici et al. (Phys. Rev.

For non-degenerate\nmulti-orbital models, our U(1) approach is advantageous in that it captures the\nnon-interacting limit at the mean-field level. For systems with either a single\norbital or degenerate multiple orbitals, the U(1) and $Z_2$ slave-spin\napproachs yield the same results in the slave-spin-condensed phase. In general,\nthe U(1) slave-spin approach contains a U(1) gauge redundancy, and properly\ndescribes a Mott insulating phase. We apply the U(1) slave-spin approach to\nstudy the metal-to-insulator transition in a five-orbital model for parent iron\npnictides. We demonstrate a Mott transition as a function of the interactions\nin this model. The nature of the Mott insulating state is influenced by the\ninterplay between the Hund's rule coupling and crystal field splittings. In the\nmetallic phase, when the Hund's rule coupling is beyond a threshold, there is a\ncrossover from a weakly correlated metal to a strongly correlated one, through\nwhich the quasiparticle speactral weight rapidly drops. The existence of such a\nstrongly correlated metallic phase supports the incipient Mott picture of the\nparent iron pnictides.

Many recent works consider the design of\nnew storage-centric erasure codes for improved repairability.

In many cases, the signal sparsity\nand the recovery performance can be further improved by replacing the L1 norm\nwith a \"weighted\" L1 norm. Without any prior information about nonzero elements\nof the signal, the procedure for selecting weights is iterative in nature.\nCommon approaches update the weights at every iteration using the solution of a\nweighted L1 problem from the previous iteration.\n  In this paper, we present two homotopy-based algorithms that efficiently\nsolve reweighted L1 problems. First, we present an algorithm that quickly\nupdates the solution of a weighted L1 problem as the weights change. Since the\nsolution changes only slightly with small changes in the weights, we develop a\nhomotopy algorithm that replaces the old weights with the new ones in a small\nnumber of computationally inexpensive steps. Second, we propose an algorithm\nthat solves a weighted L1 problem by adaptively selecting the weights while\nestimating the signal. This algorithm integrates the reweighting into every\nstep along the homotopy path by changing the weights according to the changes\nin the solution and its support, allowing us to achieve a high quality signal\nreconstruction by solving a single homotopy problem.

In this way, given finite groups U,S and Y, a wide-sense\nhomomorphic encoder (WSHE) is a FSM with U as inputs group, S as states group,\nand Y as outputs group. By denoting (U x S) as the extension of U by S, the\nnext state homomorphism nu:(U x S) --> S needs to be surjective and the\nencoding homomorphism omega:(U x S) --> Y has restrictions given by the trellis\ngraph produced by nu. The code produced by a WSHE is known as group code. In\nthis work we will study the case when the extension (U x S) is abelian with U\nbeing Z_p, p a positive prime number. We will show that this class of WSHEs\nwill produce controllable codes only if the states group S is isomorphic with\n(Z_p)^j, for some positive integer j.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 2 figures"]}]

A player who is thus notified changes its chair according to\nits deterministic program. As we show, for $m\\ge 2n-1$ chairs the team has a\nwinning strategy. Moreover, using topological arguments we show that this bound\nis tight. For $m\\leq 2n-2$ the scheduler has a strategy that is guaranteed to\nmake the game continue indefinitely and thus win.
