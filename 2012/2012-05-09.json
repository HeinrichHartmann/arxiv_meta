Quantum optics with quantum gases closes this gap and\naddresses phenomena, where the quantum statistical nature of both light and\nultracold matter play equally important roles. First, light can serve as a\nquantum nondemolition (QND) probe of the quantum dynamics of various ultracold\nparticles from ultracold atomic and molecular gases to nanoparticles and\nnanomechanical systems.

We give a\nsimple (1 + 1/k)-approximation to the unweighted variant of the problem, where\nall arcs of G have the same cost. This improves on the 1 + 2/k approximation of\nGabow et al. [GGTW09].\n  Similar to the 2-approximation algorithm for this problem [FJ81], our\nalgorithm simply takes the union of a k in-arborescence and a k\nout-arborescence. The main difference is in the selection of the two\narborescences. Here, inspired by the recent applications of the rounding by\nsampling method (see e.g. [AGM+ 10, MOS11, OSS11, AKS12]), we select the\narborescences randomly by sampling from a distribution on unions of k\narborescences that is defined based on an extreme point solution of the linear\nprogramming relaxation of the problem. In the analysis, we crucially utilize\nthe sparsity property of the extreme point solution to upper-bound the size of\nthe union of the sampled arborescences.\n  To complement the algorithm, we also show that the integrality gap of the\nminimum cost strongly connected subgraph problem (i.e., when k = 1) is at least\n3/2 - c, for any c > 0. Our integrality gap instance is inspired by the\nintegrality gap example of the asymmetric traveling salesman problem [CGK06],\nhence providing further evidence of connections between the approximability of\nthe two problems.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 2 figures, ICALP2012"]}]

In 1989, Burns and Goldsmith\ndetermined the clique number of the commuting graph of $\\sym(X)$. In 2008,\nIranmanesh and Jafarzadeh found an upper bound of the diameter of\n$\\cg(\\sym(X))$, and in 2011, Dol\\u{z}an and Oblak claimed (but their proof has\na GAP) that this upper bound is in fact the exact value.\n  The goal of this paper is to begin the study of the commuting graph of the\nsymmetric inverse semigroup $\\mi(X)$. We calculate the clique number of\n$\\cg(\\mi(X))$, the diameters of the commuting graphs of the proper ideals of\n$\\mi(X)$, and the diameter of $\\cg(\\mi(X))$ when $|X|$ is even or a power of an\nodd prime. We show that when $|X|$ is odd and divisible by at least two primes,\nthen the diameter of $\\cg(\\mi(X))$ is either 4 or 5. In the process, we obtain\nseveral results about semigroups, such as a description of all commutative\nsubsemigroups of $\\mi(X)$ of maximum order, and analogous results for\ncommutative inverse and commutative nilpotent subsemigroups of $\\mi(X)$.

There are several methods for speaker segmentation; however, most of\nthe Speaker Diarization Systems use BIC-based Segmentation methods. The main\ngoal of this paper is to propose a new method for speaker segmentation with\nhigher speed than the current methods - e.g. BIC - and acceptable accuracy. Our\nproposed method is based on the pitch frequency of the speech. The accuracy of\nthis method is similar to the accuracy of common speaker segmentation methods.\nHowever, its computation cost is much less than theirs. We show that our method\nis about 2.4 times faster than the BIC-based method, while the average accuracy\nof pitch-based method is slightly higher than that of the BIC-based method.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 8 figures"]}]

The optical phonons and the electron-phonon interaction are\nconsidered within the multimode dielectric model. The model exploits both\nelectrostatic and mechanical boundary conditions for the relative ionic\ndisplacement vector, as well as the phonon spatial dispersion in bulk. The\nconfined phonon modes in a quantum dot are hybrids of bulk-like and interface\nvibrations. Raman spectra, calculated using the multimode dielectric model,\ncompare well with experimental data. Multiphonon Raman amplitudes are\ncalculated taking into account the effects of non-adiabaticity, which play a\ncrucial role in the optical spectra of quantum dots. Peak intensities of Raman\nspectra are investigated as a function of the confinement frequency parameter\nand of the height of a quantum dot. Non-adiabatic transitions are shown to\nstrongly increase the scattering probabilities and the relative multiphonon\nscattering intensities with respect to the one-phonon intensity.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 4 figures, E-mail addresses: devreese@uia.ua.ac.be,\n  fomin@uia.ua.ac.be, leburton@ceg.uiuc.edu"]}]
