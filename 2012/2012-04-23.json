This, combined with mutual coupling between antennas, makes it\ndifficult to predict the sensitivity of these instruments. This paper describes\na system model and procedure for estimating the system equivalent flux density\n(SEFD) - a useful and meaningful metric of the sensitivity of a radio telescope\n- that accounts for these issues. The method is applied to LWA-1, the first\n\"station\" of the Long Wavelength Array (LWA) interferometer. LWA-1 consists of\n512 bowtie-type antennas within a 110 x 100 m elliptical footprint, and is\ndesigned to operate between 10 MHz and 88 MHz using receivers having noise\ntemperature of about 250 K.

It is also shown that considerable improvement is\npossible using beamforming coefficients which are designed to optimize\nsignal-to-noise ratio under these conditions. Mutual coupling is found to play\na significant role, but does not have a consistently positive or negative\ninfluence.

Such a\ndesign is currently not available in the CASPER DSP library.\n  The work presented in this paper focuses on two aspects. Firstly, we\nintroduce and demonstrate a dataflow-based design approach using the dataflow\ninterchange format (DIF) tool for high-level application specification, and we\nintegrate this approach with the CASPER tool flow. Secondly, we explore the\ntrade-off between the flexibility of TDD designs and the low hardware cost of\nfixed-configuration digital downconverter (FDD) designs that use the available\nCASPER DSP library. We further explore this trade-off in the context of a\ntwo-stage downconversion scheme employing a combination of TDD or FDD designs.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Radio Science"]}]

Two cases, the 2D model and the 3D\nmodel, are investigated. In the 2D model, a considerable fraction of the phase\nplane is covered by chaotic orbits. Two factors seem to be responsible for the\nchaotic motion: (i) the dense nucleus and (ii) the asymmetries in the dark\nhalo. Our numerical experiments suggest, that there are several chaotic\ncomponents on the Poincare phase plane. Different chaotic components are\ninduced by the asymmetries in the halo. Each chaotic component seems to have a\ndifferent value of the Lyapunov Characteristic Exponent, for small values of\nthe asymmetry parameter and a unique LCE for larger values of the asymmetry\nparameter.
