During this\nphase, the inflaton typically oscillates at the bottom of its potential and\ngradually transfers its energy to radiation. At the same time, the amplitude of\nthe fields coupled to the inflaton may undergo parametric resonance and, as a\nconsequence, explosive particle production can take place. A priori, these\nphenomena could lead to an amplification of the super-Hubble scale curvature\nperturbations which, in turn, would modify the standard inflationary\npredictions. However, remarkably, it has been shown that, although the\nMukhanov-Sasaki variable does undergo narrow parametric instability during\npreheating, the amplitude of the corresponding super-Hubble curvature\nperturbations remain constant. Therefore, in single field models, metric\npreheating does not affect the power spectrum of the large scale perturbations.\nIn this article, we investigate the corresponding effect on the scalar\nbi-spectrum. Using the Maldacena's formalism, we analytically show that, for\nmodes of cosmological interest, the contributions to the scalar bi-spectrum as\nthe curvature perturbations evolve on super-Hubble scales during preheating is\ncompletely negligible. Specifically, we illustrate that, certain terms in the\nthird order action governing the curvature perturbations which may naively be\nexpected to contribute significantly are exactly canceled by other\ncontributions to the bi-spectrum.

In this paper\nwe present a general discussion of the constraints of the renormalization group\n(RG) invariance on the choice of the renormalization scale. We adopt the RG\nbased equations, which incorporate the scheme parameters, for a general\nexposition of RG invariance, since they simultaneously express the invariance\nof physical observables under both the variation of the renormalization scale\nand the renormalization scheme parameters. We then discuss the self-consistency\nrequirements of the RG, such as reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity, which\nmust be satisfied by the scale-setting method. The Principle of Minimal\nSensitivity (PMS) requires the slope of the approximant of an observable to\nvanish at the renormalization point.

Aims: To constrain the physical characteristics of a\ngroup of embedded low-mass protostars in Corona Australis in the vicinity of\nthe young luminous Herbig Be star R CrA. Methods: Millimetre wavelength maps of\nmolecular line and continuum emission towards the low-mass star forming region\nIRS7 near R CrA from the SMA and APEX are presented. The maps show the\ndistribution of 18 lines from 7 species (H2CO, CH3OH, HC3N, c-C3H2, HCN, CN and\nSiO) on scales from 3\" to 60\" (400-8000 AU). Using a set of H2CO lines, we\nestimate the temperatures and column densities in the region using LTE and\nnon-LTE methods. The results are compared with 1-D radiative transfer modelling\nof the protostellar cores. These models constrain which properties of the\ncentral source, envelope, and environment can give rise to the observed line\nand continuum emission. Results: Most of the H2CO emission from the regions\nemerges from two elongated narrow ridges dominating the emission picked up in\nboth interferometric and single-dish measurements. The temperatures inferred\nfrom the H2CO lines are no less than ~30 K and more likely 50-60 K, and the\nline emission peaks are offset by ~2500 AU from the location of the embedded\nprotostars. The temperatures can not be explained by the heating from the young\nstellar objects themselves. Irradiation by the nearby Herbig Be star R CrA\ncould, however, explain the high temperatures. The elevated temperatures can in\nturn impact the physical and chemical characteristics of protostars and lead to\nenhanced abundances of typical tracers of photon dominated regions seen in\nsingle-dish line surveys of embedded protostars in the region.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A; 21 pages, 28 figures; Added footnote\n  in Section 2.2"]}]

A quantitative measure of the quality of a sleep-wake cycle\nis introduced and used to systematically study the generalized model for\ndifferent levels of noise and diversity.

On the other hand only a mild evidence of stochastic\nresonance is found when the level of noise is varied. These results show that\ndisorder, especially in the form of quenched diversity, can be a key-element\nfor an efficient or optimal functioning of the homeostatic regulation of the\nsleep-wake cycle.

One can build up\na field configuration with arbitrary topological charge by changing $\\theta_0$,\nand interpolate between the extreme adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes by\nchanging $\\mu$. This system is exactly solvable and therefore we compute the\nCasimir energy exactly and unambiguously by using an energy density subtraction\nscheme. We show that in general the Casimir energy goes to zero in the extreme\nadiabatic limit, and in the extreme non-adiabatic limit when the asymptotic\nvalues of the pseudoscalar field properly correspond to a configuration with an\narbitrary topological charge. Moreover, in general the Casimir energy is always\npositive and on the average an increasing function of $\\theta_0$ and always has\nlocal maxima when there is a zero mode, showing that these configurations are\nenergetically unfavorable. We also compute and display the energy densities\nassociated with the spectral deficiencies in both of the continua, and those of\nthe bound states. We show that the energy densities associated with the\ndistortion of the spectrum of the states with $E>0$ and $E<0$ are mirror images\nof each other. We also compute and display the Casimir energy density. Finally\nwe compute the energy of a system consisting of a soliton and a valance\nelectron and show that the Casimir energy of the system is comparable with the\nbinding energy.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 6 figures"]}]

Therefore the information\nabout the system is known at the end of some well defined intervals, e. g.\ncompany reports, inflation data, GDP etc. They describe a (market) situation in\nthe past. The time delay is specific to the market branch. It can be very short\n(e.g. stock market offer is updated every minute or so and this information is\nimmediately available) or long, like months in the case of agricultural market,\nwhen the decisions are taken based on the results from the previous harvest.\n  The analysis of the information flow delay can be based on the ACP model of\nspatial evolution of economic systems. The entities can move on a square\nlattice and when meeting take one of the two following decisions: merge or\ncreate a new entity. The decision is based on the system state, which is known\nwith some time delay. The effect of system's feedback is investigated.
