Here, we demonstrate that hybridization also dramatically\nimpacts the shapes of small alkali metal clusters. The seemingly similar and\nvalence-iso-electronic LiNa4- and LiK4- clusters adopt very different global\nminimum structures: LiNa4- is a planar C2v (1A1) species distorted from the\nperfect pentagon due to the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect, and LiK4- is a planar\nsquare D4h (1A1g) species with Li being in the centre. This effect is rooted in\nthe different degrees of the 2s-2p hybridization in Li in response to binding\nto Na versus K. Li inside the Na cluster exhibits a strong 2s-2p mixing, to\nachieve stronger covalent bonding. In contrast, Li inside of the K cluster does\nnot show any hybridization, and the LiK4- cluster is reminiscent of an ionic\nsalt. These differences are tied to the relative electronegativities of Li, Na,\nand K, and overlap of the valence atomic orbitals of Li with those of Na versus\nthose of K. Atomic orbital hybridization is thus a pronounced effect in\nclusters, the understanding of which is important for the use of clusters in\nmaterial science or catalysis, and designing clusters of desired shapes.\n","Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a wrong version of\n  Figure 2 being included in it"]}]

This motion and Compton scattering\nof the 511 keV photons within the patient limit the performance of PET. We\npresent a nuclear medical imaging technique, able to reach submillimeter\nspatial resolution in 3 dimensions with a reduced activity application compared\nto conventional PET. This 'gamma-PET' technique draws on specific positron\nsources simultaneously emitting an additional photon with the \\beta+ decay.\nExploiting the triple coincidence between the positron annihilation and the\nthird photon, it is possible to separate the reconstructed 'true' events from\nbackground. In order to test the feasibility of this technique, Monte-Carlo\nsimulations and image reconstruction has been performed. The spatial resolution\namounts to 0.2 mm (FWHM) in each direction, surpassing the performance of\nconventional PET by about an order of magnitude. The simulated detector\ngeometry exhibits a coincidence detection efficiency of 1.92e-7 per decay.\nStarting with only 0.7 MBq of source activity (ca. 200-500 times less compared\nto conventional PET) an exposure time of 450 s is sufficient for source\nreconstruction.\n","Comment: 2 pages, 1 figure, ICTR-PHE 2012 Conference contribution"]}]

The main advantage of the method is its componentwise nature, i.e. the\nfact that it allows each component of the perturbation vector to have an\nindependent bound and that the bounds and sets obtained are also given\ncomponentwise. This componentwise method does not employ a norm for bounding\neither the perturbation or state vectors, avoids the need for scaling the\ndifferent state vector components in order to obtain useful results, and may\nalso reduce conservativeness in some cases. We give conditions for the derived\nbounds to be of local or semi-global nature. In addition, we deal with the case\nof perturbation bounds whose dependence on a delayed state is of affine form as\na particular case of nonlinear dependence for which the bounds derived are\nshown to be globally valid.

The estimation procedure\nproposed by Ke and Wang (2001) is based on a combination of log-likelihood\napproximation methods for parametric estimation and smoothing splines\ntechniques for nonparametric estimation. In this work, we propose new\nestimation strategies in SNMMs. On the one hand, we use the Stochastic\nApproximation version of EM algorithm (Delyon et al., 1999) to obtain exact ML\nand REML estimates of the fixed effects and variance components. On the other\nhand, we propose a LASSO-type method to estimate the unknown nonlinear\nfunction. We derive oracle inequalities for this nonparametric estimator. We\ncombine the two approaches in a general estimation procedure that we illustrate\nwith simulated and real data.\n","Comment: 36 pages, 6 figures"]}]

The surface brightness\ndistribution of the stellar disks is calculated using 3D LTE spectrum formation\nand opacity sampling. We test our predictions using least-squares fits of model\nlight curves to primary eclipses that were observed with the Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST).\n  The limb darkening law derived from the 3D model of HD 209458 between 2900 A\nand 5700 A produces significantly better fits to the HST data, removing\nsystematic residuals that were previously observed for model light curves based\non 1D predictions. This difference arises mainly from the shallower mean\ntemperature structure of the 3D model, which is a consequence of the explicit\nsimulation of surface granulation. In the case of HD 189733, the model\natmospheres produce practically equivalent limb darkening curves between 2900 A\nand 5700 A, partly due to obstruction by spectral lines, and the data are not\nsufficient to distinguish between the light curves. We also analyze HST\nobservations between 5350 A and 10500 A for this star; the 3D model leads to a\nbetter fit compared to 1D predictions.\n  The significant improvement of fit quality for the HD 209458 system\ndemonstrates the higher degree of realism of 3D models and the importance of\nsurface granulation for the formation of the atmospheric radiation field of\nlate-type stars. This result agrees well with recent investigations of limb\ndarkening in the solar continuum and other observational tests. The case of HD\n189733 is no contradiction as the model light curves are less sensitive to the\ntemperature stratification of the atmosphere and the observed data in the 2900\nA - 5700 A region are not sufficient to distinguish more clearly between 3D and\n1D limb darkening.\n","Comment: To be published in Astronomy & Astrophysics (article accepted)"]}]
