In most analyses, the comoving length of the ruler is\ninferred from a combination of CMB observations and theory. However, this\ninferred length may be biased by various non-standard effects in early universe\nphysics; this can lead to biased inferences of cosmological parameters such as\nH_0, \\Omega_m and w, so it would be valuable to measure the absolute BAO length\nby combining a galaxy redshift survey and a suitable direct low-z distance\nmeasurement. One obstacle is that low-redshift BAO surveys mainly constrain the\nratio r_S / D_V(z), where D_V is a dilation scale which is not directly\nobservable by standard candles. Here, we find a new approximation D_V(z) \\simeq\n(3/4) D_L(4z/3) (1+ 4z/3)^{-1} (1 - 0.02455 z^3 + 0.0105 z^4) which connects\nD_V to the standard luminosity distance D_L at a somewhat higher redshift; this\nis shown to be very accurate (relative error < 0.2 percent) for all\nWMAP-compatible Friedmann models at z < 0.4, with very weak dependence on\ncosmological parameters H_0, \\Omega_m, \\Omega_k, w.

For these purposes we derive a realistic low-energy model, using results\nof first-principles calculations and experimental parameters of the crystal\nstructure. Then, we solve this model in the Hartree-Fock approximation. We\nargue that the multiferroic state in YMnO3 has a magnetic origin, and the\ncentrosymmetric Pbnm structure is formally sufficient for explaining details of\nthe noncentrosymmetric magnetic ground state. The relativistic spin-orbit\ninteraction lifts the degeneracy, caused by the frustration of isotropic\ninteractions, and stabilizes a twofold periodic magnetic state, which is\nsimilar to the E-state apart from the spin canting. The noncentrosymmetric\natomic displacements in the P2_1nm phase reduce the spin canting, but do not\nchange the symmetry of the magnetic state. The effect of the P2_1nm distortion\non the FE polarization P_a is twofold: (i) it gives rise to ionic\ncontributions, associated with the Y and O sites; (ii) it affects the\nelectronic polarization, through the change of the spin canting. The relatively\nsmall value of P_a, observed in the experiment, is caused by a partial\ncancelation of the electronic and ionic contributions in the experimental\nP2_1nm structure. Finally, we theoretically optimize the crystal structure, by\nusing the LSDA+U approach and assuming the collinear E-type alignment. We have\nfound that the agreement with the experimental data in this case is less\nsatisfactory and P_a is largely overestimated. Although the magnetic structure\ncan be formally tuned by varying the Coulomb repulsion U as a parameter,\napparently LSDA+U fails to reproduce some fine details of the experimental\nstructure, and the cancelation of different contributions in P_a does not\noccur.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables"]}]

However, the exact transition point $[J_2/J_1]_C$ between both\nscenarios was under debate. In this paper we present Monte Carlo data which\nstrengthens the conclusion of Jin \\et [Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{108}, 045702\n(2012)] that the transition point is at a value of $J_2/J_1 \\approx 0.67$ and\nthat double-peak structures in the energy histograms for larger values of\n$J_2/J_1$ are unstable in a scaling analysis.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 6 figures"]}]

Here we report the first observation of quantum (T = 0) critical\nphenomena of the Au-Al-Yb quasicrystal - the magnetic susceptibility and the\nelectronic specific heat coefficient arising from strongly correlated 4f\nelectrons of the Yb atoms diverge as T -> 0. Furthermore, we observe that this\nquantum critical phenomenon is robust against hydrostatic pressure. By\ncontrast, there is no such divergence in a crystalline approximant, a phase\nwhose composition is close to that of the quasicrystal and whose unit cell has\natomic decorations (that is, icosahedral clusters of atoms) that look like the\nquasicrystal. These results clearly indicate that the quantum criticality is\nassociated with the unique electronic state of the quasicrystal, that is, a\nspatially confined critical state.

One approach to this question is\nthe study of relative velocities. In this context, a non local test particle is\n\"superluminal\" if its relative velocity exceeds the local speed of light of the\nobserver. The existence of superluminal relative velocities of receding test\nparticles, in a particular cosmological model, suggests itself as a possible\ncriterion for expansion of space in that model. In this point of view,\nsuperluminal velocities of distant receding galaxy clusters result from the\nexpansion of space between the observer and the clusters. However, there is a\nfundamental ambiguity that must be resolved before this approach can be\nmeaningful. The notion of relative velocity of a nonlocal object depends on the\nchoice of coordinates, and this ambiguity suggests the need for coordinate\nindependent definitions. In this work, we review four (inequivalent)\ngeometrically defined and universal notions of relative velocity: Fermi,\nkinematic, astrometric, and spectroscopic relative velocities. We apply this\nformalism to test particles undergoing radial motion relative to comoving\nobservers in expanding Robertson-Walker cosmologies, and include previously\nunpublished results on Fermi coordinates for a class of inflationary\ncosmologies. We compare relative velocities to each other, and show how pairs\nof them determine geometric properties of the spacetime, including the scale\nfactor with sufficient data.

It appears after the spontaneous\nbreaking of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry, which was proposed to solve the\nstrong-CP problem. Other pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons, postulated in some\nextensions of the standard model of particle physics, are called axion-like\nparticles (ALPs) if they share certain characteristics with the axion, in\nparticular a coupling to two photons. Thus far, axion and ALP searches have\nbeen unsuccessful, indicating that their couplings have to be extremely weak.\nHowever, axions and ALPs could be responsible for some observable effects in\nastrophysics and cosmology, which can also be exploited to constrain the\nparameter space of these particles. We focus on limits coming from cosmology,\nwhich is an optimal field for studying axions and ALPs. In particular, we first\ninvestigate the possibility of a primordial population of axions and ALPs\narising during the earliest epochs of the universe. The importance of this\nanalysis lies on the fact that axions and ALPs are ideal dark matter candidates\nbecause of their faint interactions and their peculiar production mechanisms.\nFinally, we consider the consequences of the decay of such a population on\nspecific cosmological observables, namely the photon spectrum of galaxies, the\ncosmic microwave background, the effective number of neutrino species, and the\nabundance of primordial elements. Our bounds constitute the most stringent\nprobes of early decays and exclude a part of the ALP parameter space that is\notherwise very difficult to test experimentally.\n","Comment: 132 pages, 32 figures, PhD Thesis"]}]

As new keys arrive it may be necessary\nto change the labels of some items; such changes may be done at any time at\nunit cost for each change. The goal is to minimize the total cost. An\nalternative formulation of this problem is the file maintenance problem, in\nwhich the items, instead of being labeled, are maintained in sorted order in an\narray of length m, and we pay unit cost for moving an item.\n  For the case m=cn for constant c>1, there are known algorithms that use at\nmost O(n log(n)^2) relabelings in total [Itai, Konheim, Rodeh, 1981], and it\nwas shown recently that this is asymptotically optimal [Bul\\'anek, Kouck\\'y,\nSaks, 2012].

We compare its chromospheric activity level with a\nmodel of chrosmospheric activity evolution established by combining\nrelationships between the R'HK index and the Rossby number with a recent model\nof stellar rotation evolution on the main sequence. We measure the spot\ncoverage of the stellar surface as a function of time, and find evidence for a\ntentative increase from 5-14% at the beginning of the observing run to 13-29%\n35 days later. A high level of magnetic activity on CoRoT102899501 is\ncorroborated by a strong emission in the Balmer and Ca II HK lines (logR'HK ~\n-4). The starspots used as tracers of the star rotation constrain the rotation\nperiod to 1.625+/-0.002 days and do not show evidence for differential\nrotation. The effective temperature (Teff=5180+/-80 K), surface gravity\n(logg=4.35+/-0.1), and metallicity ([M/H]=0.05+/-0.07 dex) indicate that the\nobject is located near the evolutionary track of a 1.09+/-0.12 M_Sun pre-main\nsequence star at an age of 23+/-10 Myrs.

When using a more reliable hydrodynamical\nmodel, the dispersion relation does not present any maximum of the growth rate\nwhen the sediment transport is assumed to be locally saturated.

Several approaches have been proposed that either (i) partition the\nwhole network into clusters, even in low density region, or (ii) are aimed at\nfinding a single densest community (and need to be iterated to find the next\none). As social networks grow larger both approaches (i) and (ii) result in\nalgorithms too slow to be practical, in particular when speed in analyzing the\ndata is required. In this paper we propose an approach that aims at balancing\nefficiency of computation and expressiveness and manageability of the output\ncommunity representation. We define the notion of a partial dense cover (PDC)\nof a graph. Intuitively a PDC of a graph is a collection of sets of nodes that\n(a) each set forms a disjoint dense induced subgraphs and (b) its removal\nleaves the residual graph without dense regions. Exact computation of PDC is an\nNP-complete problem, thus, we propose an efficient heuristic algorithms for\ncomputing a PDC which we christen Core and Peel. Moreover we propose a novel\nbenchmarking technique that allows us to evaluate algorithms for computing PDC\nusing the classical IR concepts of precision and recall even without a golden\nstandard.

In a\nprevious article, by Crouch, Barnes, and Leka (Solar Phys. 260, 271, 2009),\nerror-free synthetic data were used to test several methods that each make a\ndifferent assumption about how the divergence-free property can be used to\nresolve the ambiguity. In this paper this testing is continued with an\nexamination of the effects of Poisson photon noise and limited instrumental\nspatial resolution. We find that all currently available methods based on the\ndivergence-free property can produce undesirable results when photon noise or\nunresolved structure are present in the data. We perform a series of\nexperiments aimed at improving the performance of the global minimisation\nmethod, which is the most promising of the methods. We present a two-step\napproach that produces reasonable results in tests using synthetic data. The\nfirst step of this approach involves the global minimisation of a combination\nof the absolute value of the approximation for the divergence and a smoothness\nconstraint, which is designed to minimise the difference between the magnetic\nfield in neighbouring pixels. In the second step, pixels with measurements\nknown to be strongly affected by photon noise are revisited with a smoothing\nalgorithm that also seeks to minimise the difference between the magnetic field\nin neighbouring pixels.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Solar Physics"]}]

We shall see that in such a ring $R$, $R=S^3$. We\nshall bring two possible criteria, each shows when $R=S^2$. The first\ncriterion: There exist $x,y \\in S$ such that $xy-yx \\neq 0$ and $xSy \\subseteq\nS^2$ $\\Leftrightarrow$ $S^2=R$. The second criterion: There exist $x,y \\in S$\nsuch that $xy+yx \\neq 0$ and $xKy \\subseteq S^2$ $\\Leftrightarrow$ $S^2=R$.\nActually, those results are true without any restriction on the dimension of\n$R$ over $Z(R)$. In the special case of matrices (with the transpose involution\nand with the symplectic involution) over a field of characteristic not equal to\n2, it is not difficult to find, for example, $x,y \\in S$ such that $xy-yx \\neq\n0$ and for every $s \\in S$, $xsy \\in S^2$. Therefore, proving Herstein's remark\nthat for matrices the answer is known to be positive. Similar results for\n$K^6$, $K^4$, $K+KSK$, $KS+K^2$, $SKS$ and $S^2K$ can also be found.\n"]}]
