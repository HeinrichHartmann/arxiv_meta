Nevertheless, EP\ncan be sensitive to outliers and suffer from divergence for difficult cases. To\naddress this issue, we propose a new approximate inference approach, relaxed\nexpectation propagation (REP). It relaxes the moment matching requirement of\nexpectation propagation by adding a relaxation factor into the KL minimization.\nWe penalize this relaxation with a $l_1$ penalty. As a result, when two\ndistributions in the relaxed KL divergence are similar, the relaxation factor\nwill be penalized to zero and, therefore, we obtain the original moment\nmatching; In the presence of outliers, these two distributions are\nsignificantly different and the relaxation factor will be used to reduce the\ncontribution of the outlier. Based on this penalized KL minimization, REP is\nrobust to outliers and can greatly improve the posterior approximation quality\nover EP. To examine the effectiveness of REP, we apply it to Gaussian process\nclassification, a task known to be suitable to EP. Our classification results\non synthetic and UCI benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvement of\nREP over EP and Power EP--in terms of algorithmic stability, estimation\naccuracy and predictive performance.\n"]}]

The model is used to calculate the number densities of the\nhadrons produced in the polarized quark's decay chain. The full Collins\nfragmentation function is extracted from the sine modulation of the polarized\nnumber densities with respect to the polar angle between the initial quark's\nspin and hadron's transverse momentum. Two cases are studied here. First, a toy\nmodel for elementary Collins function is used to study the features of the\ntransversely polarized quark-jet model. Second, a full model calculation of\ntransverse momentum dependent pion and kaon Collins functions is presented. The\nremarkable feature of our model is that the 1/2 moments of the favored Collins\nfragmentation functions are positive and peak at large values of z but decrease\nand oscillate at small values of z. The 1/2 moments of the unfavored Collins\nfunctions have comparable magnitude and opposite sign to the favored functions,\nvanish at large z and peak at small values of z.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate the formation mechanism of MSPs by considering the pulsar recycling\nprocess in both intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (IMXBs) and low-mass X-ray\nbinaries (LMXBs). The IMXBs mainly lead to the formation of binary MSPs with a\nmassive carbon-oxygen (CO) or an oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf (ONeMg WD)\ncompanion, whereas the LMXBs form recycled pulsars with a helium white dwarf\n(He WD) companion. We discuss the accretion physics leading to the spin-up line\nin the PPdot-diagram and demonstrate that such a line cannot be uniquely\ndefined. We derive a simple expression for the amount of accreted mass needed\nfor any given pulsar to achieve its equilibrium spin and apply this to explain\nthe observed differences of the spin distributions of recycled pulsars with\ndifferent types of companions. From numerical calculations we present further\nevidence for significant loss of rotational energy in accreting X-ray MSPs in\nLMXBs during the Roche-lobe decoupling phase (Tauris 2012) and demonstrate that\nthe same effect is negligible in IMXBs. We examine the recycling of pulsars\nwith CO WD companions via Case BB Roche-lobe overflow (RLO) of naked helium\nstars in post common envelope binaries.

Geographic and demographic considerations -- proposed as a\npossible explanation of my findings -- appear to have no significant effect:\nafter correcting for these factors, the scarcity of last names remains highly\nsignificant in several disciplines, and there is a marked trend from north to\nsouth, with a higher likelihood of nepotism in the south and in Sicily.\nMoreover, I show that in several Italian disciplines positions tend to be\ninherited as with last names (i.e., from father to son, but not from mother to\ndaughter).

Far from just being puzzling constraints on\nour ability to know the state of a quantum system, uncertainty relations are at\nthe heart of why some classically impossible cryptographic primitives become\npossible when quantum communication is allowed. This thesis is concerned with\nstrong notions of uncertainty relations and their applications in quantum\ninformation theory.\n  One operational manifestation of such uncertainty relations is a purely\nquantum effect referred to as information locking. A locking scheme can be\nviewed as a cryptographic protocol in which a uniformly random n-bit message is\nencoded in a quantum system using a classical key of size much smaller than n.\nWithout the key, no measurement of this quantum state can extract more than a\nnegligible amount of information about the message, in which case the message\nis said to be \"locked\". Furthermore, knowing the key, it is possible to\nrecover, that is \"unlock\", the message. We give new efficient constructions of\nbases satisfying strong uncertainty relations leading to the first explicit\nconstruction of an information locking scheme. We also give several other\napplications of our uncertainty relations both to cryptographic and\ncommunication tasks.\n  In addition, we define objects called QC-extractors, that can be seen as\nstrong uncertainty relations that hold against quantum adversaries.

If the\nhypersurface is in general or generic position before the flow starts, then we\nexplain what singularities can occur under the flow and also why it can be\nassumed to be in generic position.\n  The mean curvature flow is the negative gradient flow of volume, so any\nhypersurface flows through hypersurfaces in the direction of steepest descent\nfor volume and eventually becomes extinct in finite time. Before it becomes\nextinct, topological changes can occur as it goes through singularities. Thus,\nin some sense, the topology is encoded in the singularities.\n"]}]
