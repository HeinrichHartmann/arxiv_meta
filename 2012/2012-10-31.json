Second, we give improved\nregularity control with respect to the number of derivatives bounded and/or on\nthe norm in which the derivatives are bounded. As an example of the former, our\nresults for minimizing harmonic maps f : M->N between riemannian manifolds\ninclude a priori bounds in W^{1,p}\\cap W^{2,p} for all p < 3. These are the\nfirst such bounds involving second derivatives in general dimensions. Finally,\nthe quantity we control is actually provides much stronger information than\nfollows from a bound on the L^p norm of derivatives. Namely, we obtain L^p\nbounds for the inverse of the regularity scale\nr_f(x)=max{r:sup_{B_r(x)}(r|\\nabla f|+r^2|\\nabla^2 f|)\\leq 1}. Applications to\nminimal hypersufaces include a priori L^p bounds for the second fundamental\nform A for all p < 7. Previously known bounds were for p < 2+\\epsilon(n).\nAgain, the full theorem is much stronger and yields Lp bounds for the\ncorresponding regularity scale r_A(x)=max{r:sup_{B_r(x)}rA\\leq 1}. In outline,\nour discussion follows that of an earlier paper in which we proved analogous\nestimates in the context of noncollapsed riemannian manifolds with a lower\nbound on Ricci curvature. These were applied to Einstein manifolds. A key point\nin all of these arguments is to establish the relevant quantitative\ndifferentiation theorem.\n","Comment: 24 pages"]}]

In such events the\ninteraction with the wind powers the observed luminosity, and predictions\ninclude observable hard X-rays. Wind breakouts on timescales of a day or longer\nare currently the most probable for detection. Here we study the signal that\nfollows such events. We start from the breakout of the radiation mediated\nshock, finding that the breakout temperature can vary significantly from one\nevent to another ($10^4 - 5 \\times 10^6$ K) due to possible deviation from\nthermal equilibrium. In general, events with longer breakout pulse duration,\n$t_{bo}$, are softer. We follow the observed radiation through the evolution of\nthe collisionless shock which forms after the breakout of the radiation\nmediated shock. We restrict the study of the collisionless shock evolution to\ncases where the breakout itself is in thermal equilibrium, peaking in\noptical/UV. In these cases the post-breakout emission contains two spectral\ncomponents - soft (optical/UV) and hard (X-rays and possibly soft\n$\\gamma$-rays). Right after the breakout pulse X-rays are strongly suppressed,\nand they carry only a small fraction of the total luminosity. The hard\ncomponent becomes harder and its luminosity rises quickly afterwards, gaining\ndominance at $\\sim 10-50 \\,t_{bo}$. The ratio of the peak optical/UV to the\npeak X-ray luminosity depends mostly on the breakout time. In terms of\nprospects for X-ray and soft gamma-ray detections, it is best to observe\n100-500 days after explosions with breakout timescales between a week and a\nmonth.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures"]}]

At each timestep, a pair of diploid\nindividuals drawn uniformly at random contribute offspring to the population.\nThe number of offspring can be large relative to the total population size.\nSimilar `heavily skewed' reproduction mechanisms have been considered by\nvarious authors recently. Each diploid parental individual contributes exactly\none chromosome to each diploid offspring, and hence ancestral lineages can only\ncoalesce when in distinct individuals. A separation of timescales phenomenon is\nthus observed. A result of M\\\"{o}hle (1998) is extended to obtain convergence\nof the ancestral process to an ancestral recombination graph necessarily\nadmitting simultaneous multiple mergers of ancestral lineages. The usual\nancestral recombination graph is obtained as a special case of our model when\nthe parents contribute only one offspring to the population each time. Due to\ndiploidy and large offspring numbers, novel effects appear. For example, the\nmarginal genealogy at each locus admits simultaneous multiple mergers in up to\nfour groups, and different loci remain substantially correlated even as the\nrecombination rate grows large. Thus, genealogies for loci far apart on the\nsame chromosome remain correlated. Correlation in coalescence times for two\nloci is derived and shown to be a function of the coalescence parameters of our\nmodel. Extending the observations by Eldon and Wakeley (2008), predictions of\nlinkage disequilibrium are shown to be functions of the reproduction parameters\nof our model, in addition to the recombination rate. Correlations in ratios of\ncoalescence times between loci can be high, even when the recombination rate is\nhigh and sample size is large.\n","Comment: 79 pages; 9 figures; 6 tables; Appendix"]}]

Usually, the word extreme refers directly to\ncluster mass, which is not a direct observable and thus subject to substantial\nuncertainty. Hence, it is desirable to extend studies of extreme clusters to\ndirect observables, such as the Einstein radius (ER). We aim to evaluate the\noccurrence probability of the large observed ER of MACS J0717.5 within the\nstandard LCDM cosmology. In particular, we want to model the distribution\nfunction of the single largest ER in a given cosmological volume and to study\nwhich underlying assumptions and effects have the strongest impact on the\nresults. We obtain this distribution by a Monte Carlo approach, based on the\nsemi-analytic modelling of the halo population on the past lightcone. After\nsampling the distribution, we fit the results with the general extreme value\n(GEV) distribution which we use for the subsequent analysis. We find that the\ndistribution of the maximum ER is particularly sensitive to the precise choice\nof the halo mass function, lens triaxiality, the inner slope of the halo\ndensity profile and the mass-concentration relation. Using the distributions so\nobtained,we study the occurrence probability of the large ER of MACS J0717.5,\nfinding that this system is not in tension with LCDM. We also find that the GEV\ndistribution can be used to fit very accurately the sampled distributions and\nthat all of them can be described by a Frechet distribution.

No obvious profile\nasymmetry is found and the variation of the line width is typically very small.\nThe intensity variation is often less than 2%. These oscillations are more\nlikely to be signatures of kink/Alfven waves rather than flows. In a few cases\nthere seems to be a pi/2 phase shift between the intensity and Doppler shift\noscillations, which may suggest the presence of slow mode standing waves\naccording to wave theories. However, we demonstrate that such a phase shift\ncould also be produced by loops moving into and out of a spatial pixel as a\nresult of Alfvenic oscillations. In this scenario, the intensity oscillations\nassociated with Alfvenic waves are caused by loop displacement rather than\ndensity change.\n","Comment: 9 figures, accepted by ApJ"]}]

The results\nfrom a third, waiting-time (t_w) protocol, where n_s is changed temporarily\nduring t_w by a large amount, demonstrate that non-Gaussian PDFs exhibit\nhistory dependence and an evolution towards a Gaussian distribution as the\nsystem ages and slowly approaches equilibrium.

In the dilute\nplasmas, the ion Larmor radius is small compared with its collisional mean free\npath. In this case, the transport of heat and momentum along the magnetic field\nlines become important. This paper presents a novel linear instability that may\nmore powerful and greater than ideal magnetothermal instability (MTI) and ideal\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI) in the dilute astrophysical plasmas. This\ntype of plasma is believed to be found in the intracluster medium of galaxy\nclusters and radiatively ineffective accretion flows around black holes. We\nderive the dispersion relation of this instability and obtain the instability\ncondition. There is at least one unstable mode that is independent of the\ntemperature gradient direction for a helical magnetic field geometry. This\nnovel instability is driven by the gyroviscosity coupled with differential\nrotation. Therefore we call it as gyroviscous modified magnetorotational\ninstability (GvMRI). We examine how the instability depends on signs of the\ntemperature gradient and the gyroviscosity, and also on the magnitude of the\nthermal frequency and on the values of the pitch angle. We provide a detailed\nphysical interpretation of obtained results. The GvMRI is applicable not only\nto the accretion flows and intracluster medium but also to the transition\nregion between cool dense gas and the hot low-density plasma in stellar\ncoronae, accretion disks, and the multiphase interstellar medium because of\nbeing independent of the temperature gradient direction.\n","Comment: 43 pages, 9 figures, published in The Astrophysical Journal"]}]

In practice, we use intuitive questions to ask\nabout aspects of scenarios we are interested in.
