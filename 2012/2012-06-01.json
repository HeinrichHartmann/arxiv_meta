In this\nmanuscript, we use information theory to study how reliably signalling cascades\nemploying autoregulation and feedback can transmit time-varying signals.

Positive feedback specifically enhances information transmission\nat low frequencies, while negative feedback increases signal fidelity at high\nfrequencies.

After reviewing the sources of difficulty, we present a Lorentz\ncovariant, real formulation in which second class constraints never arise.\nRather than a foliation of spacetime, we use a gauge field y, interpreted as a\nfield of observers, to break the SO(3,1) symmetry down to a subgroup SO(3)_y.\nThis symmetry breaking plays a role analogous to that in MacDowell-Mansouri\ngravity, which is based on Cartan geometry, leading us to a picture of gravity\nas 'Cartan geometrodynamics.' We study both Lorentz gauge transformations and\ntransformations of the observer field to show that the apparent breaking of\nSO(3,1) to SO(3) is not in conflict with Lorentz covariance.\n","Comment: 10 pages, revtex, APS style; v2: extended discussion of relation to\n  approaches using second class constraints in abstract/introduction, made some\n  additional small corrections; v3: fixed abstract; v4: minimal changes to\n  match published version"]}]

In our two-stage residual WZC, the source is quantized\ntwice and the input of the second stage is the quantization error (residue) of\nthe first stage.

We consider here boolean programs with a\nfinite number of threads and recursive procedures. It is well-known that the\nmodel checking problem is undecidable for this class of programs. In this\npaper, we investigate the decidability and the complexity of this problem under\nthe assumption of bounded context-switching defined by Qadeer and Rehof, and of\nphase-boundedness proposed by La Torre et al. On the model checking of such\nsystems against temporal logics and in particular branching time logics such as\nthe modal $\\mu$-calculus or CTL has received little attention. It is known that\nparity games, which are closely related to the modal $\\mu$-calculus, are\ndecidable for the class of bounded-phase systems (and hence for bounded-context\nswitching as well), but with non-elementary complexity (Seth). A natural\nquestion is whether this high complexity is inevitable and what are the ways to\nget around it. This paper addresses these questions and unfortunately, and\nsomewhat surprisingly, it shows that branching model checking for MPDSs is\ninherently an hard problem with no easy solution. We show that parity games on\nMPDS under phase-bounding restriction is non-elementary. Our main result shows\nthat model checking a $k$ context bounded MPDS against a simple fragment of\nCTL, consisting of formulas that whose temporal operators come from the set\n${\\EF, \\EX}$, has a non-elementary lower bound.\n"]}]
