We find that submm flux density and star formation rate\n(SFR) are related in dramatically different ways for quiescently star-forming\ngalaxies and starbursts. Because the stars formed in the merger-induced\nstarburst do not dominate the bolometric luminosity and the rapid drop in dust\nmass and more compact geometry cause a sharp increase in dust temperature\nduring the burst, starbursts are very inefficient at boosting submm flux\ndensity (e.g., a $\\ga16$x boost in SFR yields a $\\la 2$x boost in submm flux\ndensity). Moreover, the ratio of submm flux density to SFR differs\nsignificantly between the two modes; thus one cannot assume that the galaxies\nwith highest submm flux density are necessarily those with the highest\nbolometric luminosity or SFR. These results have important consequences for the\nbright submillimeter-selected galaxy (SMG) population. Among them are: 1. The\nSMG population is heterogeneous. In addition to merger-driven starbursts, there\nis a subpopulation of galaxy pairs, where two disks undergoing a major merger\nbut not yet strongly interacting are blended into one submm source because of\nthe large ($\\ga 15$\", or $\\sim 130$ kpc at $z = 2$) beam of single-dish submm\ntelescopes. 2.

Here\nwe combine hydrodynamic simulations of major mergers with 3-D dust radiative\ntransfer calculations to determine observational diagnostics that can\ndistinguish between quiescently star-forming SMGs and starburst SMGs via\nintegrated data alone. We fit the far-IR SEDs of the simulated galaxies with\nthe optically thin single-temperature modified blackbody, the full form of the\nsingle-temperature modified blackbody, and a power-law temperature-distribution\nmodel. The effective dust temperature, T_dust, and power-law index of the dust\nemissivity in the far-IR, \\beta, derived can significantly depend on the\nfitting form used, and the intrinsic \\beta\\ of the dust is not recovered.\nHowever, for all forms used here, there is a T_dust above which almost all\nsimulated galaxies are starbursts, so a T_dust cut is very effective at\nselecting starbursts. Simulated merger-induced starbursts also have higher\nL_IR/M_gas and L_IR/L_FUV than quiescently star-forming galaxies and lie above\nthe star formation rate-stellar mass relation. These diagnostics can be used to\ntest our claim that the SMG population is heterogeneous and to observationally\ndetermine what star formation mode dominates a given galaxy population.

Two full analogues to the MW- LMC-SMC system were found in GAMA (all\ngalaxies late-type and star forming), suggesting such a combination of close\ntogether, late-type, star-forming galaxies is rare: only 0.4% of MW mass\ngalaxies (in the range where we could observe both the LMC and SMC) have such a\nsystem. In summary, the MW-LMC-SMC system is a 2.7? event (when recast into\nGaussian statistics).\n  Using cross-correlation comparisons we find that there is a preference for\nSMC- LMC binary pair analogues to be located within 2 Mpc of a range of\ndifferent lumi- nosity groups. There is a particular preference is for such\nbinaries to be located near LG luminosity systems. When these groups are\nsubdivided into small magnitude gap and large magnitude gap subsets, the\nbinaries prefer to be spatially associated with the small magnitude gap\nsystems. These systems will be dynamically less evolved, but still offer the\nsame amount of gravitational dark matter. This suggests that binaries such as\nthe SMC-LMC might be transient systems, usually destroyed during vigorous\nmerger events. Details of a particularly striking analogue to the MW-SMC-LMC\nand M31 complex are included.\n","Comment: 6 pages 2 figures, Published in MNRAS, presented at IAU SpS2 Thu 23rd\n  Aug 11:45am"]}]

The\nworkshop provides a venue where researchers and practitioners could meet,\nexchange ideas, identify common problems, determine some of the key and\nfundamental issues related to coordination languages and self adaptation, and\nexplore together and disseminate solutions. Indeed, a number of hot research\ntopics are currently sharing the common problem of combining concurrent,\ndistributed, mobile and heterogeneous components, trying to harness the\nintrinsic complexity of the resulting systems. Computation nowadays is becoming\ninherently concurrent, either because of characteristics of the hardware (with\nmulticore processors becoming omnipresent) or due to the ubiquitous presence of\ndistributed systems (incarnated in the Internet). Computational systems are\ntherefore typically distributed, concurrent, mobile, and often involve\ncomposition of heterogeneous components. To specify and reason about such\nsystems and go beyond the functional correctness proofs, e.g., by supporting\nreusability and improving maintainability, approaches such as coordination\nlanguages and self adaptation are recognised as fundamental.\n  This year, we received 13 submissions involving 35 authors from 10 different\ncountries. Papers underwent a rigorous review process, and all accepted papers\nreceived 3 review reports. After the review process, the international Program\nCommittee of FOCLASA 2012 decided to select 8 papers for presentation during\nthe workshop and inclusion in these proceedings.

In\nthis paper we prove that the measure on the space of functions can be related\nto the motivic measure on the space of arcs by a factor, which can be defined\nexplicitly in geometric terms.

Based on a one-dimensional\nPotts-like model with many-particle interactions, the GMPC describes the\nhelix-coil transition in both polypeptides and polynucleotides. In the\nframework of the GMPC we show that correctly introduced nearest-neighbor\nstacking interactions against the background of hydrogen bonding lead to\nincreased stability (melting temperature) and, unexpectedly, to decreased\ncooperativity (maximal correlation length). The increase in stability is\nexplained as due to an additional stabilizing interaction (stacking) and the\nsurprising decrease in cooperativity is seen as a result of mixing of\ncontributions of hydrogen bonding and stacking.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 5 figures.
