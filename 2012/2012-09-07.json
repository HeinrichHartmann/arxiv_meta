The resulting behaviour consists of two main phases. Firstly, a\ntransient reconnection phase, in which the current in the layer is rapidly\ndispersed and some flux is reconnected. This dispersal of current launches a\nfamily of small amplitude magnetic and plasma perturbations, which propagate\naway from the null at the local fast and slow magnetosonic speeds. The vast\nmajority of the magnetic energy released in this phase goes into internal\nenergy of the plasma, and only a tiny amount is converted into kinetic energy.\nIn the wake of the outwards propagating pulses, an imbalance of Lorentz and\npressure forces creates a stagnation flow which drives a regime of impulsive\nbursty reconnection, in which fast reconnection is turned on and off in a\nturbulent manner as the current density exceeds and falls below a critical\nvalue. During this phase, the null current density is continuously built up\nabove a certain critical level, then dissipated very rapidly, and built up\nagain, in a stochastic manner. Interestingly, the magnetic energy converted\nduring this quasi-steady phase is greater than that converted during the\ninitial transient reconnection phase.

This problem has\nbeen considered more extensively in two-dimensions, but lacks a generalization\ninto 3D fields.\n  Aims: 3D magnetic nulls are more complex than 2D nulls and the field can take\na greater range of magnetic geometries local to the null. Here, we focus on one\ntype and consider the dynamical non-resistive relaxation of 3D spiral nulls\nwith initial spine-aligned current. We aim to provide a valid\nmagnetohydrostatic equilibrium, and describe the electric current accumulations\nin various cases, involving a finite plasma pressure.\n  Methods: A full MHD code is used, with the resistivity set to zero so that\nreconnection is not allowed, to run a series of experiments in which a\nperturbed spiral 3D null point is allowed to relax towards an equilibrium, via\nreal, viscous damping forces. Changes to the initial plasma pressure and other\nmagnetic parameters are investigated systematically.\n  Results: For the axi-symmetric case, the evolution of the field and the\nplasma is such that it concentrates the current density in two cone-shaped\nregions along the spine, thus concentrating the twist of the magnetic field\naround the spine, leaving a radial configuration in the fan plane. The plasma\npressure redistributes in order to maintain the current density accumulations.\nHowever, it is found that changes in the initial plasma pressure do not modify\nthe final state significantly. In the cases where the initial magnetic field is\nnot axi-symmetric, a infinite-time singularity of current perpendicular to the\nfan is found at the location of the null.\n"]}]

Many specific expansions (as the\nNMSSM for instance) allow for a richer Higgs sector.
