In the\nliterature, this phenomenon is sometimes interpreted as the result of some\nattraction of the particles towards this high flow rate branch. In this paper,\nwe focus on the existence of such an attraction through microfluidic\nexperiments and two-dimensional simulations and show clearly that such an\nattraction does not occur but is, on the contrary, directed towards the low\nflow rate branch. Arguments for this attraction are given and a discussion on\nthe sometimes misleading arguments found in the literature is proposed.\nFinally, the enrichment in particles in the high flow rate branch is shown to\nbe mainly a consequence of the initial distribution in the inlet branch, which\nshows necessarily some depletion near the walls.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 11 figures, accepted in Journal of Fluid Mechanics"]}]

Previous theoretical\npredictions of the ferromagnetic phase transition have been based on the\nperturbation theory, which treats the gas parameter as a small number. On the\nother hand, Belitz, Kirkpatrick, and Vojta (BKV) have argued that the phase\ntransition in clean itinerant ferromagnets is generically of first order at low\ntemperatures, due to the correlation effects that lead to a nonanalytic term in\nthe free energy. The second-order perturbation theory predicts a first-order\nphase transition at $(k_{\\rm F}a)_c=1.054$, consistent with the BKV argument.\nHowever, since the critical gas parameter is expected to be of order O(1),\nperturbative predictions may be unreliable. In this paper we study the\nnonperturbative effects on the ferromagnetic phase transition by summing the\nparticle-particle ladder diagrams to all orders in the gas parameter. We\nconsider a universal repulsive Fermi gas where the effective range effects can\nbe neglected, which can be realized in a two-component Fermi gas of $^6$Li\natoms by using a nonadiabatic field switch to the upper branch of a Feshbach\nresonance with a positive s-wave scattering length. Our theory predicts a\nsecond-order phase transition, which indicates that ferromagnetic transition in\ndilute Fermi gases is possibly a counterexample to the BKV argument. The\npredicted critical gas parameter $(k_{\\rm F}a)_c=0.858$ is in good agreement\nwith the recent quantum Monte Carlo result $(k_{\\rm F}a)_c=0.86$ for a nearly\nzero-range potential [S.

Due to its high degree of locality,\nthe lattice Boltzmann method, when combined with a molecular dynamics solver\nand parallelized on modern supercomputers, provides a tool that allows such\nstudies. Still, running simulations on hundreds of thousands of cores is not\ntrivial. We report on our practical experiences when employing large fractions\nof an IBM Blue Gene/P system for our simulations. Then, we extend our model for\nspherical particles in multicomponent flows to anisotropic ellipsoidal objects\nrendering the shape of e.g. clay particles.

The onion\nstructure is a network where nodes with almost the same degree are connected.\nMotivated by this work, we propose and analyze, based on analytical\nconsiderations, an onion-like candidate for a nearly optimal structure against\nsimultaneous random and targeted high degree node attacks. The nearly optimal\nstructure can be viewed as a hierarchically interconnected random regular\ngraphs, the degrees and populations of which are specified by the degree\ndistribution.

RIP matrices are known to enable efficient and stable reconstruction of\nsufficiently sparse signals, but the deterministic construction of such\nmatrices has proven very difficult. In this thesis, we discuss this matrix\ndesign problem in the context of a growing field of study known as frame\ntheory. In the first two chapters, we build large families of equiangular tight\nframes and full spark frames, and we discuss their relationship to RIP matrices\nas well as their utility in other aspects of sparse signal processing. In\nChapter 3, we pave the road to deterministic RIP matrices, evaluating various\ntechniques to demonstrate RIP, and making interesting connections with graph\ntheory and number theory. We conclude in Chapter 4 with a coherence-based\nalternative to RIP, which provides near-optimal probabilistic guarantees for\nvarious aspects of sparse signal processing while at the same time admitting a\nwhole host of deterministic constructions.\n","Comment: PhD thesis"]}]

At each time\nstep, two nodes, i and j, are randomly selected, and one incoming link to i is\nredirected to j with the rewiring probability R, determined only by degrees of\ntwo nodes, k_i and k_j, while giving preference to high-degree nodes. To take\nthe structure of networks into account, we also consider what types of networks\nare of interest, whether links are directed or not, and how we choose a\nrewiring link out of all incoming links to i, as a result, specifying 24\ndifferent cases of the model. We then observe numerically that networks will\nevolve to steady states with power-law degree distributions when parameters of\nthe model satisfy certain conditions.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures"]}]
