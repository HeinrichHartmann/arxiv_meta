A sex-ratio allele is\nexpressed in the heterogametic sex only, so that assumptions of Fisher's\nanalysis do not apply. Sex-ratio evolution drives cultural evolution of a\ngroup-associated trait governing mortality in the homogametic sex. The two-sex\ndynamics under resource limitation induces a strong Allee effect that depends\non both sex ratio and cultural trait values. We describe the resulting\nthreshold, separating extinction from positive growth, as a function of female\nand male densities. When initial conditions avoid extinction due to the Allee\neffect, different sex ratios cannot coexist; in our model, greater female\nallocation always invades and excludes a lesser allocation. But the culturally\ntransmitted trait interacts with the sex ratio to determine the ecological\nconsequences of successful invasion. The invading female allocation may permit\npopulation persistence at self-regulated equilibrium. For this case, the\nresident culture may be excluded, or may coexist with the invader culture. That\nis, a single sex-ratio allele in females and a cultural dimorphism in male\nmortality can persist; a low-mortality resident trait is maintained by\nfather-to-son cultural transmission. Otherwise, the successfully invading\nfemale allocation excludes the resident allele and culture, and then drives the\npopulation to extinction via a shortage of males.
