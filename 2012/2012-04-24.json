Using a model of pairwise\nsocial influence, we study how the presence of such groups within social\nnetworks affects the outcome and the speed of evolution of the overall opinion\non the network. Earlier work indicated that a single committed group within a\ndense social network can cause the entire network to quickly adopt the group's\nopinion (in times scaling logarithmically with the network size), so long as\nthe committed group constitutes more than about 10% of the population (with the\nfindings being qualitatively similar for sparse networks as well).

Formation of single-layer graphene is clearly apparent in Raman\nspectra which display sharp optical phonon bands. Atomic-force microscope\nimages and Raman maps reveal that the graphene grown depends on the surface\nmorphology of the h-BN substrates. The growth is governed by the high mobility\nof the carbon atoms on the h-BN surface, in a manner that is consistent with\nvan der Waals epitaxy. The successful growth of graphene layers depends on the\nsubstrate temperature, but is independent of the incident flux of carbon atoms.\n","Comment: Solid State Communications, 2012"]}]

The\nsquangles are consistent with the general Markov model (GM) and can be used to\ninfer quartets without the need to explicitly estimate all parameters. As GM is\ninhomogeneous and hence non-stationary, the squangles are expected to perform\nwell compared to standard approaches when there are changes in base-composition\namongst species. However, GM includes the IID assumption, so the squangles\nshould be confounded by data generated with invariant sites or with\nrate-variation across sites. Here we implement the squangles in a least-squares\nsetting that returns quartets weighted by either confidence or internal edge\nlengths; and use these as input into a variety of quartet-based supertree\nmethods. For the first time, we quantitatively investigate the robustness of\nthe squangles to the breaking of IID assumptions on both simulated and real\ndata sets; and we suggest a modification that improves the performance of the\nsquangles in the presence of invariant sites. Our conclusion is that the\nsquangles provide a novel tool for phylogenetic estimation that is\ncomplementary to methods that explicitly account for rate-variation across\nsites, but rely on homogeneous - and hence stationary - models.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 6 figures"]}]

Moreover, as bend minimization over all planar embeddings is\nNP-hard, most approaches focus on a fixed planar embedding.\n  We consider the problem OptimalFlexDraw that is defined as follows. Given a\nplanar graph G on n vertices with maximum degree 4 and for each edge e a cost\nfunction cost_e : N_0 --> R defining costs depending on the number of bends on\ne, compute an orthogonal drawing of G of minimum cost.

We also extend his work in that we handle advanced features of DPLL\nsuch as backjumping and Lemma learning, etc. Finally, we re fine the approach\nby starting to formalise quantitative aspects of the simulations: the\ncomplexity is preserved (number of steps to build complete proofs). Other\naspects remain to be formalised (non-determinism of the search / width of\nsearch space).\n"]}]

In most cases,\nhowever, one quickly encounters a combinatorial explosion and even if the\ncomplete enumeration of the objects is possible, there is no apparent way how\nto study them in details, store them efficiently, or generate a particular one\nrapidly. In this paper we propose a novel method to deal with these\ndifficulties, and illustrate it by presenting the classification of quaternary\ncomplex Hadamard matrices up to order 8.
