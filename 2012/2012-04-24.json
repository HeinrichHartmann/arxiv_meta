Using a model of pairwise\nsocial influence, we study how the presence of such groups within social\nnetworks affects the outcome and the speed of evolution of the overall opinion\non the network. Earlier work indicated that a single committed group within a\ndense social network can cause the entire network to quickly adopt the group's\nopinion (in times scaling logarithmically with the network size), so long as\nthe committed group constitutes more than about 10% of the population (with the\nfindings being qualitatively similar for sparse networks as well).

They are all around stars of solar-like type and hence reinforce our\nconclusion that disks around such stars are still relatively common at 670 Myr\nand are similar to the rate around early-type stars.

Analytic properties of S(F) are related\nto dynamical properties of chiF. The Riemann-Lebesque lemma implies that if\nchiF is minimal, then S(F) is convex and hence S(F) is the closure of the\nconvex hull of its extreme points Se(F). In this paper we (i) review the\nrelationship between these concepts and the special case of the still open 1959\nKadison-Singer problem called Feichtinger's conjecture for exponential\nfunctions, (ii) partially characterize of elements in Se(F), for minimal chiF,\nin terms of ergodic properties of (O(F),lambda) where lambda is a shift\ninvariant probability measure whose existence in ensured by the 1937\nKrylov-Bogoyubov theorem, (iii) refine previous numerical studies of the\nMorse-Thue minimal binary sequence by exploiting a new MATLAB algorithm for\ncomputing smallest eigenvalues of 4,000,000 x 4,000,000 matrices, (iv) describe\nrecent results characterizing S(F) for certain Bohr sets F related to\nquasicrystals, (v) extend these concepts to general discrete groups including\nthose with Kazhdan's T-property, such as SL(n,Z), n > 2, which can be\ncharacterized by several equivalent properties such as: any sequence of\npositive definite functions converging to 1 uniformly on compact subsets\nconverges uniformly. This exotic property may be useful to construct a\ncounterexample to the generalization of Feichtinger's conjecture and hence to\nprovide a no answer to the question of Kadison and Singer whcih they themselves\ntended to suspect.\n","Comment: To appear in Proceedings the Annual Meeting in Mathematics, Bangkok,\n  Thailand, April 12, 2012.

Given a\nplanar graph G on n vertices with maximum degree 4 and for each edge e a cost\nfunction cost_e : N_0 --> R defining costs depending on the number of bends on\ne, compute an orthogonal drawing of G of minimum cost.

The\nfirst formulation is based on a system of rewrite rules, which we denote\nDPLL(T). The second formulation is an inference system of, which we denote\nLKDPLL(T). The third formulation is the application of a standard proof-search\nmechanism in a sequent calculus LKp(T) introduced here. We formalise an\nencoding from DPLL(T) to LKDPLL(T) that was, to our knowledge, never explicitly\ngiven and, in the case where DPLL(T) is extended with backjumping and Lemma\nlearning, never even implicitly given. We also formalise an encoding from\nLKDPLL(T) to LKp(T), building on Ivan Gazeau's previous work: we extend his\nwork in that we handle the \"-modulo-Theory\" aspect of SAT-modulo-theory, by\nextending the sequent calculus to allow calls to a theory solver (seen as a\nblackbox). We also extend his work in that we handle advanced features of DPLL\nsuch as backjumping and Lemma learning, etc. Finally, we re fine the approach\nby starting to formalise quantitative aspects of the simulations: the\ncomplexity is preserved (number of steps to build complete proofs). Other\naspects remain to be formalised (non-determinism of the search / width of\nsearch space).\n"]}]
