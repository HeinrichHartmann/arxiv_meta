In\nthis paper, we develop methods that allow to extend this result to other\nvariants of bin packing. Specifically, the problems which we study in this\npaper, for which we design asymptotic fully polynomial time approximation\nschemes, are the following. The first problem is \"Bin packing with cardinality\nconstraints\", where a parameter k is given, such that a bin may contain up to k\nitems. The goal is to minimize the number of bins used. The second problem is\n\"Bin packing with rejection\", where every item has a rejection penalty\nassociated with it. An item needs to be either packed to a bin or rejected, and\nthe goal is to minimize the number of used bins plus the total rejection\npenalty of unpacked items. This resolves the complexity of two important\nvariants of the bin packing problem. Our approximation schemes use a novel\nmethod for packing the small items.

This\nimpact is understood within a commonly accepted hydrodynamic picture: it is\ninitiated by a rapid shock and a subsequent ejection of a sheet leading to\nbeautiful splashing patterns. However, this picture ignores the essential role\nof the air that is trapped between the impacting drop and the surface. Here we\ndescribe a new imaging modality that is sensitive to the behavior right at the\nsurface. We show that a very thin film of air, only a few tens of nanometers\nthick, remains trapped between the falling drop and the surface as the drop\nspreads. The thin film of air serves to lubricate the drop enabling the fluid\nto skate on the air film laterally outward at surprisingly high velocities,\nconsistent with theoretical predictions. Eventually this thin film of air must\nbreak down as the fluid wets the surface. We suggest that this occurs in a\nspinodal-like fashion, and causes a very rapid spreading of a wetting front\noutwards; simultaneously the wetting fluid spreads inward much more slowly,\ntrapping a bubble of air within the drop. Our results show that the dynamics of\nimpacting drops are much more complex than previously thought and exhibit a\nrich array of unexpected phenomena that require rethinking classical paradigms.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 4 figures"]}]

By comparing with results from\na square-well potential, we investigate the validity of original\npseudo-potential models in the presence of SO coupling. We find the s-wave\npseudo-potential provides a good approximation for low-energy solutions near\ns-wave resonances, given the length scale of SO coupling much longer than the\npotential range. However, near p-wave resonance the p-wave pseudo-potential\ngives low-energy solutions that are qualitatively different from exact ones,\nbased on which we conclude that the p-wave model can not be applied to the\nfermion system if the SO coupling strength is larger or comparable to the Fermi\nmomentum.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 8 figures.

Different adaptions of the Arnoldi\nmethod are often used to compute partial Schur factorizations. We propose here\na technique to compute a partial Schur factorization of a nonlinear eigenvalue\nproblem (NEP). The technique is inspired by the algorithm in [8], now called\nthe infinite Arnoldi method. The infinite Arnoldi method is a method designed\nfor NEPs, and can be interpreted as Arnoldi's method applied to a linear\ninfinite-dimensional operator, whose reciprocal eigenvalues are the solutions\nto the NEP. As a first result we show that the invariant pairs of the operator\nare equivalent to invariant pairs of the NEP. We characterize the structure of\nthe invariant pairs of the operator and show how one can carry out a\nmodification of the infinite Arnoldi method by respecting the structure. This\nalso allows us to naturally add the feature known as locking. We nest this\nalgorithm with an outer iteration, where the infinite Arnoldi method for a\nparticular type of structured functions is appropriately restarted. The\nrestarting exploits the structure and is inspired by the well-known implicitly\nrestarted Arnoldi method for standard eigenvalue problems.

In other terms, the local states can only become purer (weakly) in\nexpectation. The proof also provides an improvement on Nielsen's. The if part\nof Nielsen's characterization does not generalize. This is shown by studying\nthe entanglement of three qubits.

We\nconsider self-consistent field approximation of QHD equations. Starting from\nQHD equation we derive the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for magnetized BEC. We\nshow that Gross-Pitaevskii equation exists under condition that the magnetic\nmoment direction is not change. Using obtained QHD equations we study the\ndispersion of collective excitation. As in electrically polarized BEC [P. A.\nAndreev, L. S. Kuz'menkov, arXiv: 1201.2440], in the magnetically polarized BEC\nthere is second wave mode (polarization mode or spin wave), in addition to the\nBogoliubov's mode. Second wave solution appears due to the magnetic moment\nevolution. The influence of magnetization on dispersion of Bogoliubov's mode is\nfound. We found strong difference of dispersion properties of waves in\nmagnetized BEC from electrically polarized BEC.\n","Comment: 6 pages"]}]

The School's theme\nwas \"Secular Evolution of Galaxies\" and my task was to present the underlying\nstellar-dynamical theory. Other lecturers were speaking on the role of bars and\nchemical evolution, so these topics are avoided here. We start with an account\nof the connections between isolating integrals, quasiperiodicity and\nangle-action variables - these variables played a unifying role throughout the\nlectures. This leads on to the phenomenon of resonant trapping and how this can\nlead to chaos in cuspy potentials and phase-space mixing in slowly evolving\npotentials. Surfaces of section and frequency analysis are introduced as\ndiagnostics of phase-space structure. Real galactic potentials include a\nfluctuating part that drives the system towards unattainable thermal\nequilibrium. Two-body encounters are only one source of fluctuations, and all\nfluctuations will drive similar evolution. We derive the orbit-averaged\nFokker-Planck equation and relations that hold between the second-order\ndiffusion coefficients and both the power spectrum of the fluctuations and the\nfirst-order diffusion coefficients. From the observed heating of the solar\nneighbourhood we show that the second-order diffusion coefficients must scale\nas J^{1/2}. We show that periodic spiral structure shifts angular momentum\noutwards, heating at the Lindblad resonances and mixing at corotation. The\nequation that would yield the normal modes of a stellar disc is first derived\nand then used to discuss the propagation of tightly-wound spiral waves. The\nwinding up of such waves is explains why cool stellar discs are responsive\nsystems that amplify ambient noise. An explanation is offered of why the\nLin-Shu-Kalnajs dispersion relation and even global normal-mode calculations\nprovide a very incomplete understanding of the dynamics of stellar discs.\n","Comment: 43 pages.
