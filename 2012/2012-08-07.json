The detection of gamma rays from star-forming galaxies by the Fermi\nLarge Area Telescope (LAT) has allowed the determination of a functional\nrelationship between star formation rate and gamma-ray luminosity (Ackermann\net. al. 2012). Since star formation is known to scale with total infrared\n(8-1000 micrometers) and radio (1.4 GHz) luminosity, the observed infrared and\nradio emission from a star-forming galaxy can be used to quantitatively infer\nthe galaxy's gamma-ray luminosity. Similarly, star forming galaxies within\ngalaxy clusters allow us to derive lower limits on the gamma-ray emission from\nclusters, which have not yet been conclusively detected in gamma rays. In this\nstudy we apply the relationships between gamma-ray luminosity and radio and IR\nluminosities derived in Ackermann et. al. 2012 to a sample of galaxy clusters\nfrom Ackermann et. al. 2010 in order to place lower limits on the gamma-ray\nemission associated with star formation in galaxy clusters. We find that\nseveral clusters have predicted lower limits on gamma-ray emission that are\nwithin an order of magnitude of the upper limits derived in Ackermann et. al.\n2010 based on non-detection by Fermi-LAT. Given the current gamma-ray limits,\nstar formation likely plays a significant role in the gamma-ray emission in\nsome clusters, especially those with cool cores.

We aim to model the\npersistent non-thermal jet emission by monitoring and characterizing the very\nhigh energy $\\gamma$-ray emission of M87 during a low state. A total of 150\\,h\nof data were taken between 2005 and 2007 with the single MAGIC-I telescope, out\nof which 128.6\\,h survived the data quality selection. We also collected data\nin the X-ray and \\textit{Fermi}--LAT bands from the literature (partially\ncontemporaneous). No flaring activity was found during the campaign. The source\nwas found to be in a persistent low-emission state, which was at a confidence\nlevel of $7\\sigma$. We present the spectrum between 100\\,GeV and 2\\,TeV, which\nis consistent with a simple power law with a photon index $\\Gamma=2.21\\pm0.21$\nand a flux normalization at 300\\,GeV of $(7.7\\pm1.3) \\times 10^{-8}$ TeV$^{-1}$\ns$^{-1}$ m$^{-2}$. The extrapolation of the MAGIC spectrum into the GeV energy\nrange matches the previously published \\textit{Fermi}--LAT spectrum well,\ncovering a combined energy range of four orders of magnitude with the same\nspectral index. We model the broad band energy spectrum with a spine layer\nmodel, which can satisfactorily describe our data.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables; A&A Journal version, fixed typo in the\n  author list"]}]

The\nprecision of centrality estimated in each node was deteriorated overall in\nthree networks based on transfer entropy, mutual information, and Pearson\ncorrelation; particularly the distortion of transfer entropy was more sensitive\nto the standard deviation of fractal exponents. A node with high centrality was\nresilient to desynchronized fractal dynamics over all frequencies while a node\nwith small centrality exhibited huge distortion of both wavelet correlation and\ncentrality over low frequencies. This theoretical expectation indicates that\nthe difference of fractal exponents between brain regions leads to discrepancy\nof statistical network properties, especially at nodes with small centrality,\nbetween neuronal activities and BOLD signals, and that the traditional\ndefinitions of resting state functional connectivity may not effectively\nreflect the dynamics of spontaneous neuronal activities.\n","Comment: The 3rd Biennial Conference on Resting State Brain Connectivity"]}]

At optical frequencies, the gold susceptibility is\ndetermined by the interband transitions around the X,L points in the first\nBrillouin zone and thermo-modulational effects ensue from Fermi smearing of the\nelectronic energy distribution in the conduction band. As a consequence of\nlight-induced heating of the conduction electrons, the optical susceptibility\nbecomes nonlinear.

In such cases, one can resort to so-called choice functions. They\nprovide a means to determine which options in a particular set are optimal, and\nallow incomparability among any number of options. Applying choice functions in\nsequential decision problems can be highly non-trivial, as the usual properties\nof maximising expected utility may no longer be satisfied. In this paper, we\nstudy one of these properties: we revisit and reinterpret Selten's concept of\nsubgame perfectness in the context of decision trees, leading us to the concept\nof subtree perfectness, which basically says that the optimal solution of a\ndecision tree should not depend on any larger tree it may be embedded in. In\nother words, subtree perfectness excludes counterfactual reasoning, and\ntherefore may be desirable from some philosophical points of view. Subtree\nperfectness is also desirable from a practical point of view, because it admits\nefficient algorithms for solving decision trees, such as backward induction.\nThe main contribution of this paper is a very simple non-technical criterion\nfor determining whether any given choice function will satisfy subtree\nperfectness or not. We demonstrate the theorem and illustrate subtree\nperfectness, or the lack thereof, through numerous examples, for a wide variety\nof choice functions, where incomparability amongst strategies can be caused by\nimprecision in either probabilities or utilities. We find that almost no choice\nfunction, except for maximising expected utility, satisfies it in general.
