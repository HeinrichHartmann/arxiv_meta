It is based on electron density profiles inferred\nfrom White Light (WL) brightness measurements of the corona during solar\neclipses. This method has been applied to several published coronal electron\ndensity models. The calculated temperature distributions reach a maximum at r >\n1.3 RS, and therefore do not satisfy one of the conditions for applying the shm\nmethod. Another method is the hydrostatic equilibrium method (hst), which\nenables coronal temperature distributions to be determined, providing solutions\nto the hydrostatic equilibrium equation. The temperature maximas using the hst\nmethod are almost equal to those obtained using the shm method, but the\ntemperature peak is always at significantly lower altitude when the hst-method\nis used than when the shm-method is used. A third and more recently developed\nmethod, dyn, can be used for the same published electron density profiles. The\ntemperature distributions obtained using the dyn method are regular solutions\nof the hydrodynamic equations. They depend on the expansion velocity of the\ncoronal plasma considered as a free input parameter in the calculations. At the\nbase of the solar corona, where the coronal bulk velocity is small (subsonic),\nthe dyn and hst methods give similar temperature values. Larger differences are\nfound at higher altitudes where the expansion velocity approaches and exceeds\nthe velocity of sound. This paper shows also the effects of the flow tube\ngeometry and ion temperatures on the electron temperature distributions. The\ndyn method is a generalization of the hst method, where the electron\ntemperature distribution tends to zero at infinite radial distances. It is a\nnew diagnostic tool for determining from WL coronal observations the range of\nradial distances where the coronal heating rate is at its maximum.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 7 figures, 2 Tables, 1 Appendix ; topic of poster\n  presentation at \"The fifth Coronal Loop Workshop\", Palma-Mallorca, 2011\n  Comments: legends of TABLES 1 & 2 changed; title fig. 5 changed;\n  Typographical errors corrected; 5th line TABLE 2 removed"]}]

Beyond a critical\ntemperature difference a two cell pattern is observed as the dominant\nstructure. As the temperature is increased further, the density changes in the\nsystem are sharp with formation of distinct high density layers close to the\ncold wall. Doubling the length of the domain led to the formation of four\nconvection cells with the same cell diameter as before, confirming the\ninvariance of the pattern formation in that dimension. Changes in the height of\nthe domain led to cells with more uniform looking patterns.

Such processes\noccur naturally within the context of a wide variety of applications. The\nassociated posterior distributions are highly complex and posterior parameter\ninference requires the use of advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\ntechniques. Our approach uses a recently introduced simulation methodology,\nparticle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) (Andrieu et. al. 2010 [1]), where\nsequential Monte Carlo (SMC) approximations (see Doucet et. al. 2001 [18] and\nLiu 2001 [27]) are embedded within MCMC.

This is achieved by devising a sequence of\nnested sets from B0 to A and then perform the resampling step only when the\nsamples of the process reach intermediate level sets in the sequence.\nNaturally, the choice of the intermediate level sets is critical to the\nperformance of such a scheme.

The algebra OS(M) is\nisomorphic to the cohomology algebra of the complement in V of the union of the\nhyperplanes of A. The Tutte polynomial T(x,y) of M is a powerful invariant of\nthe matroid M.

We identify several new integrable cases for arbitrary value\nof the exponent $q, q\\in R$. The $q=1$ and $q=2$ cases are analyzed in detail\nand the results are generalized to arbitrary $q$. Our results show that many\nclassical integrable nonlinear oscillators can be derived as sub-cases of our\nresults and significantly enlarge the list of integrable equations that exist\nin the contemporary literature. To explore the above underlying results we use\nthe recently introduced generalized extended Prelle-Singer procedure applicable\nto second order ODEs. As an added advantage of the method we not only identify\nintegrable regimes but also construct integrating factors, integrals of motion\nand general solutions for the integrable cases, wherever possible, and bring\nout the mathematical structures associated with each of the integrable cases.\n","Comment: 46 pages"]}]
