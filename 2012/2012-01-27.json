HCO+ emission is a star\nformation indicator similar to HCN, tracing dense molecular hydrogen gas (n(H2)\n~= 10^5 cm^-3) within star-forming molecular clouds. We derive a\nlensing-corrected HCO+(J=4-3) line luminosity of L'(HCO+(4-3)) = (1.6+/-0.3) x\n10^9 (mu_L/11)^-1 K km/s pc^2, which corresponds to only 48% of the HCO+(J=1=0)\nluminosity, and <~4% of the CO(J=3-2) luminosity. The HCO+ excitation thus is\nclearly subthermal in the J=4-3 transition. Modeling of the HCO+ line radiative\ntransfer suggests that the HCO+ emission emerges from a region with physical\nproperties comparable to that exhibiting the CO line emission, but 2x higher\ngas density.

In the latter\ntrans-planckian regime, we find that the quantum corrections are exponentially\nsuppressed, which provide asymptotically flat wormhole geometries with a\nconstant shape function, i.e., b(r)=r_t, where r_t is the wormhole throat. In\naddition to this analysis, we also fix the geometry by considering the\nbehaviour of a specific shape function through a variational approach which\nimposes a local analysis to the problem at the wormhole throat. We further\nexplore the respective parameter range of the Rainbow's functions, and find a\ngood agreement with previous work.\n","Comment: 11 pages"]}]

We fit our models to Hubble Space Telescope images\ncorresponding to the B and I bands, using shapelet analysis and a genetic\nalgorithm to generate 30 statistically best-fitting models.

Most of the attenuation comes from\nsmall high-density clumps with low (<10%) filling factors. The fraction of dust\nin clumps is broadly consistent with results from fitting NGC 891's spectral\nenergy distribution. Because of scattering effects and the intermixed nature of\nthe dust and starlight, attenuation is smaller and less wavelength-dependent\nthan the integrated dust column-density. Our clumpy models typically have\nhigher attenuation at low inclinations than previous radiative transfer models\nusing smooth distributions of stars and dust, but similar attenuation at\ninclinations above 70 degrees.

The\nmethod permits the compression of data for storage or transmission, allowing\nthe exact original data to be reconstructed without any loss of content. The\nmethod is characterized by the simplicity of implementation, as well as high\nspeed and compression ratio. The method is based on a unique scheme of\nbinary-ternary prefix-free encoding of characters of the original data. This\nscheme does not require the transmission of the code tables from encoder to\ndecoder; allows for the linear presentation of the code lists; permits the\nusage of computable indexes of the prefix codes in a linear list for decoding;\nmakes it possible to estimate the compression ratio prior to encoding; makes\nthe usage of multiplication and division operations, as well as operations with\nthe floating point unnecessary; proves to be effective for static as well as\nadaptive coding; applicable to character sets of any size; allows for repeated\ncompression to improve the ratio.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Here we report the discovery of a\nfundamental relation between measurement and entanglement which is\ncharacteristic of this scenario. It takes the form of a scaling law between the\namount of entanglement in the conditional state of the system and the\nprobabilities of the experimental outcomes obtained from measuring the state of\nthe environment. Using the scaling, we construct the distribution of\nentanglement over the ensemble of experimental outcomes for standard models\nwith one open channel and provide rigorous results on finite-time\ndisentanglement in systems coupled to non-Markovian baths.
