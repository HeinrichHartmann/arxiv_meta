The standard approach to such a scenario results in each\ntransmitter-receiver pair achieving a rate proportional to 1/K its\ninterference-free ergodic capacity. However, given two well-chosen time\nindices, the channel coefficients from interfering users can be made to exactly\ncancel.

The\nelastic spin flip of conduction electrons by a magnetic impurity leads to the\nwell known Kondo effect.

Specifically, we start by\nproposing the theoretical notion of Abstract Negotiation Method (ANM) as a map\nfrom the negotiation domain in itself, for any utility profile of the parties.\nANM can face both direct and iterative negotiations, since we show that ANM\nclass is closed under the limit operation. The generality of ANM is proven by\nshowing that it captures a large class of well known in literature negotiation\nmethods. Hence we show that if mutual information is assumed then any Pareto\nefficient ANM is manipulable by one single party or by a collusion of few of\nthem. We concern about the efficiency of the resulting manipulation. Thus we\nfind necessarily and sufficient conditions those make manipulability equivalent\nto actual inefficiency, meaning that the manipulation implies a change of the\nefficient frontier so the Pareto efficient ANM converges to a different, hence\nactually inefficient, frontier. In particular we distinguish between strong and\nweak actual inefficiency. Where, the strong actual inefficiency is a drawback\nwhich is not possible to overcome of the ANMs, like the Pareto invariant one,\nso its negotiation result is invariant for any two profiles of utility sharing\nthe same Pareto frontier, we present. While the weak actual inefficiency is a\ndrawback of any mathematical theorization on rational agents which constrain in\na particular way their space of utility functions. For the weak actual\ninefficiency we state a principle of Result's Inconsistency by showing that to\nfalsify theoretical hypotheses is rational for any agent which is informed\nabout the preference of the other, even if the theoretical assumptions, which\nconstrain the space of agents' utilities, are exact in the reality, i.e. the\npreferences of each single agent are well modeled.\n"]}]

One way to achieve this is\nby use of periodical calibration phases, during which the BMI system (or an\nexternal human demonstrator) instructs the user to perform certain movements or\nbehaviors. This approach has two disadvantages: (i) calibration phases\ninterrupt the autonomous operation of the BMI and (ii) between two calibration\nphases the BMI performance might not be stable but continuously decrease. A\nbetter alternative would be that the BMI decoder is able to continuously adapt\nin an unsupervised manner during autonomous BMI operation, i.e. without knowing\nthe movement intentions of the user.\n  In the present article, we present an efficient method for such unsupervised\ntraining of BMI systems for continuous movement control. The proposed method\nutilizes a cost function derived from neuronal recordings, which guides a\nlearning algorithm to evaluate the decoding parameters. We verify the\nperformance of our adaptive method by simulating a BMI user with an optimal\nfeedback control model and its interaction with our adaptive BMI decoder. The\nsimulation results show that the cost function and the algorithm yield fast and\nprecise trajectories towards targets at random orientations on a 2-dimensional\ncomputer screen.

All nodes in the network are assumed to be oblivious to their\nforward channel gains; however, they have perfect information about their\nbackward channel gains. The focus of this paper is on simple, efficient, and\npractical relaying schemes to increase the expected-rate at the destination.\nFor this purpose, various combinations of relaying protocols and the broadcast\napproach (multi-layer coding) are proposed. For the decode-forward (DF)\nrelaying, the maximum finite-layer expected-rate as well as two upper-bounds on\nthe continuous-layer expected-rate are obtained. The main feature of the\nproposed DF scheme is that the layers being decoded at both relays are added\ncoherently at the destination although each relay has no information about the\nnumber of layers being successfully decoded by the other relay. It is proved\nthat the optimal coding scheme is transmitting uncorrelated signals via the\nrelays. Next, the maximum expected-rate of ON/OFF based amplify-forward (AF)\nrelaying is analytically derived. For further performance improvement, a hybrid\ndecode-amplify-forward (DAF) relaying strategy, adopting the broadcast approach\nat the source and relays, is proposed and its maximum throughput and maximum\nfinite-layer expected-rate are presented. Moreover, the maximum throughput and\nmaximum expected-rate in the compress-forward (CF) relaying adopting the\nbroadcast approach, using optimal quantizers and Wyner-Ziv compression at the\nrelays, are fully derived. All theoretical results are illustrated by numerical\nsimulations.
