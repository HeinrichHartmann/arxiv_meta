This combination enables us to probe\ngalaxy cluster physics or even to test the validity of the distance-duality\nrelation itself. We explore these possibilities based on two different, but\ncomplementary approaches. Firstly, in order to constrain the possible galaxy\ncluster morphologies, the validity of the distance-duality relation (DD\nrelation) is assumed in the $\\Lambda$CDM framework (WMAP7). Secondly, by\nadopting a cosmological-model-independent test, we directly confront the\nangular diameters from galaxy clusters with two supernovae Ia (SNe Ia)\nsubsamples (carefully chosen to coincide with the cluster positions).

In\nparticular, we show that for the pure replicator dynamics the (weak) solution\nof the dynamical system converges to a Dirac measure centered at the fittest\nstrategy class; thus this Dirac measure is a globally attractive equilibrium\npoint which is termed a continuously stable strategy (CSS). It is also shown\nthat in the discrete case of the pure replicator dynamics and even for small\nperturbation of the pure replicator dynamics (i.e., selection with small\nmutation) there exists a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium.\n"]}]

This paper analyses the hybrid\nzone dynamics affected by \"weak\" Haldane's rule, namely the incomplete hybrids\ninferiority (sterility/inviability) against the heterogametic (XY or ZW) sex\ncaused by a Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility. Different strengths of\nincompatibility, dispersal and density-dependent regulation are considered; and\nthe gene flow and clinal structures of allele frequencies in the presence of\nshort-range dispersal (the stepping-stone model) are examined. I show that a\nweak heterogametic hybrid incompatibility could constitute a substantial\nbarrier that could reduce gene flow and result in non-coincident and discordant\nclines of alleles. It is found that the differential gene flow is more\npronounced under a stronger density-dependent regulation.

In our scenario, a highly evolved central core in the dense galactic\nnucleus is formed containing a subsystem of compact stellar remnants (CSRs),\nsuch as neutron stars and black holes. Those subsystems result from the\ndynamical evolution of dense central stellar clusters in the galactic nuclei\nthrough merging of stars, thereby forming (as has been realized by many\nauthors) the short-living massive stars and then CSRs. We estimate the rate of\nrandom CSR collisions in the evolved galactic nuclei by taking into account,\nsimilar to Quinlan & Shapiro (1987), the dissipative encounters of CSRs, mainly\ndue to radiative losses of gravitational waves, which results in the formation\nof intermediate short-living binaries, with further coalescence of the\ncompanions to produce GRBs. We also consider how the possible presence of a\ncentral supermassive black hole, formed in a highly evolved galactic nucleus,\ninfluences the CSR binary formation. This scenario does not postulate ad hoc a\nrequired number of tight binary neutron stars in the galaxies. Instead, it\ngives, for the most realistic parameters of the evolved nuclei, the expected\nrate of GRBs consistent with the observed one, thereby explaining the GRB\nappearance in a natural way of the dynamical evolution of galactic nuclei. In\naddition, this scenario provides an opportunity for a cosmological GRB\nrecurrence, previously considered to be a distinctive feature of GRBs of a\nlocal origin only. We also discuss some other observational tests of the\nproposed scenario.\n","Comment: 25 pages, LATEX, uses aasms4.sty, accepted by ApJ"]}]
