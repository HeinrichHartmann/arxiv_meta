The merger fraction and rate of massive galaxies evolves as a\npower-law (1+z)^n, with major mergers increasing with redshift, n_MM = 1.4, and\nminor mergers showing little evolution, n_mm ~ 0. When split by their\nmorphology, the minor merger fraction for early types is higher by a factor of\nthree than that for spirals, and both are nearly constant with redshift. Our\nresults show that massive early-type galaxies have undergone 0.89 mergers (0.43\nmajor and 0.46 minor) since z ~ 1, leading to a mass growth of ~30%. We find\nthat mu >= 1/10 mergers can explain ~55% of the observed size evolution of\nthese galaxies since z ~ 1. Another ~20% is due to the progenitor bias (younger\ngalaxies are more extended) and we estimate that very minor mergers (mu < 1/10)\ncould contribute with an extra ~20%. The remaining ~5% should come from other\nprocesses (e.g., adiabatic expansion or observational effects). This picture\nalso reproduces the mass growth and velocity dispersion evolution of these\ngalaxies. We conclude from these results that merging is the main contributor\nto the size evolution of massive ETGs at z <= 1, accounting for ~50-75% of that\nevolution in the last 8 Gyr.

A balanced mixer is a unique tool to separate\nnoise at the mixer's LO port from other noise sources. This is not possible in\nsingle-ended mixers.

This is in contrast to the IF slope of the balanced\nmixer itself which is positive due to the expected IF roll-off of the mixer.\nThis indicates a higher noise level closer to the LO's carrier frequency.

Recent studies indicate that\nmergers provide an efficient mechanism to substantially increase the\nstrong-lensing efficiency of individual clusters. Based on purely semi-analytic\nmethods, we investigated the statistical impact of cluster mergers on the\ndistribution of the largest Einstein radii and the optical depth for giant\ngravitational arcs of selected cluster samples. Analysing representative\nall-sky realizations of clusters at redshifts z < 1 and assuming a constant\nsource redshift of z_s = 2.0, we find that mergers increase the number of\nEinstein radii above 10 arcsec (20 arcsec) by ~ 35 % (~ 55 %). Exploiting the\ntight correlation between Einstein radii and lensing cross sections, we infer\nthat the optical depth for giant gravitational arcs with a length-to-width\nratio > 7.5 of those clusters with Einstein radii above 10 arcsec (20 arcsec)\nincreases by ~ 45 % (85 %). Our findings suggest that cluster mergers\nsignificantly influence in particular the statistical lensing properties of the\nstrongest gravitational lenses.

Most\nof the literature on host-pathogen coevolution focuses on this phenomenon, and\nlooks for consequent evidence of coevolutionary arms races. An alternative\nstrategy, less often considered in the literature, is to deter rapid\nevolutionary change by the opponent. To study how this can be done, we\nconstruct an evolutionary game between a controller that must process\ninformation, and an adversary that can tamper with this information processing.\nIn this game, a species can foil its antagonist by processing information in a\nway that is hard for the antagonist to manipulate. We show that the structure\nof the information processing system induces a fitness landscape on which the\nadversary population evolves. Complex processing logic can carve long, deep\nfitness valleys that slow adaptive evolution in the adversary population. We\nsuggest that this type of defensive complexity on the part of the vertebrate\nadaptive immune system may be an important element of coevolutionary dynamics\nbetween pathogens and their vertebrate hosts. Furthermore, we cite evidence\nthat the immune control logic is phylogenetically conserved in mammalian\nlineages. Thus our model of defensive complexity suggests a new hypothesis for\nthe lower rates of evolution for immune control logic compared to other immune\nstructures.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1203.4601"]}]

An\nexhaustive analysis of this kind of entanglement is performed, where the focus\nis on bipartite entanglement. Nevertheless, also issues regarding multipartite\nhybrid entanglement are briefly discussed. The quintessence of this thesis is a\nnew classification scheme which distinguishes between effective discrete\nvariable hybrid entanglement and so-called true hybrid entanglement.

For example, entanglement witnessing is discussed not only for\nhybrid entangled states, but also for fully continuous variable two-mode\nSchroedinger cat states.

Asteroids of C-type\nand close BGF-types could form from hydrated silicate-organic matter\naccumulated in the cores of water-differentiated (due to 26Al and other\nshort-lived isotopes decay) bodies existed in the growth zones of Jupiter.\nGravitational scattering of such bodies by Jupiter at its final stage of\nformation to the main asteroid belt might have led to fragmentation and\nre-accretion of their primitive materials on the surfaces of many asteroids\nand/or asteroid parent bodies. The hypothesis makes clear a row of\nlong-standing puzzling facts, the main of which are as follows. The low-albedo\nand carbonaceous-chondritic surface properties of (1) Ceres contradict to its\nprobable differentiated structure and icy crust (e. g., Thomas et al., 2005,\nNature 437: 224-226; Castillo-Rogez et al., 2010, Icarus 205, 443-459), but it\ncould be explained by the process of primitive matter fall. Atypical hydrated\nsilicates (probably, as a component of carbonaceous-chondritic matter) are\nfound on the surfaces of many asteroids of high-temperature types (Rivkin et\nal., 1995, Icarus 117: 90-100; Rivkin et al., 2000, Icarus 145: 351-368;\nBusarev, 1998, Icarus 131: 32-40; Busarev, 2002, Solar System Research 36:\n39-47) that may be a consequence of the carbonaceous-chondritic matter\nprecipitation on their surfaces. Some carbonaceous chondrites are\nunidirectionly magnetized (e. g., Stacey et al., 1961, J. Geophys. Res. 66:\n1523-1534; Butler, 1972, Earth Planet. Sci.

This paper presents an\napproach that allows working around the problem of multiple minima, and is\nbased on the insight that the original estimation problem on orientations is\nequivalent to an unconstrained quadratic optimization problem on integer\nvectors. This equivalence provides a viable way to compute the maximum\nlikelihood estimate and allows guaranteeing that such estimate is almost surely\nunique. A deeper consequence of the derivation is that the maximum likelihood\nsolution does not necessarily lead to an estimate that is \"close\" to the actual\nnodes orientations, hence it is not necessarily the best choice for the problem\nat hand. To alleviate this issue, our algorithm computes a set of estimates,\nfor which we can derive precise probabilistic guarantees. Experiments show that\nthe method is able to tolerate extreme amounts of noise (e.g., {\\sigma} =\n30{\\deg} on each measurement) that are above all noise levels of sensors\ncommonly used in mapping. For most range-finder-based scenarios, the\nmulti-hypothesis estimator returns only a single hypothesis, because the\nproblem is very well constrained.
