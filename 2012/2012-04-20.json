While many other network analysis methods based\non random walks or equivalent notions have been developed before and after our\nearlier work, one can show that they can all be mapped to one of the two modes.\nIn addition to these two fundamental modes, a major strength of our earlier\nformalism was its accommodation of context-specific directed information flow\nthat yielded plausible and meaningful biological interpretation of protein\nfunctions and pathways. However, the directed flow from origins to destinations\nwas induced via a potential function that was heuristic. Here, with a\ntheoretically sound approach called the channel mode, we extend our earlier\nwork for directed information flow. This is achieved by constructing a\npotential function facilitating a purely probabilistic interpretation of the\nchannel mode. For each network node, the channel mode combines the solutions of\nemitting and absorbing modes in the same context, producing what we call a\nchannel tensor. The entries of the channel tensor at each node can be\ninterpreted as the amount of flow passing through that node from an origin to a\ndestination. Similarly to our earlier model, the channel mode encompasses\ndamping as a free parameter that controls the locality of information flow.\nThrough examples involving the yeast pheromone response pathway, we illustrate\nthe versatility and stability of our new framework.\n","Comment: Minor changes from v3. 30 pages, 7 figures.

The goal is to seek\nan over-complete dictionary from which every training signal can be best\napproximated by a linear combination of only a few codewords. This task is\noften achieved by iteratively executing two operations: sparse coding and\ndictionary update. In the literature, there are two benchmark mechanisms to\nupdate a dictionary. The first approach, such as the MOD algorithm, is\ncharacterized by searching for the optimal codewords while fixing the sparse\ncoefficients. In the second approach, represented by the K-SVD method, one\ncodeword and the related sparse coefficients are simultaneously updated while\nall other codewords and coefficients remain unchanged. We propose a novel\nframework that generalizes the aforementioned two methods. The unique feature\nof our approach is that one can update an arbitrary set of codewords and the\ncorresponding sparse coefficients simultaneously: when sparse coefficients are\nfixed, the underlying optimization problem is similar to that in the MOD\nalgorithm; when only one codeword is selected for update, it can be proved that\nthe proposed algorithm is equivalent to the K-SVD method; and more importantly,\nour method allows us to update all codewords and all sparse coefficients\nsimultaneously, hence the term simultaneous codeword optimization (SimCO).\nUnder the proposed framework, we design two algorithms, namely, primitive and\nregularized SimCO. We implement these two algorithms based on a simple gradient\ndescent mechanism.

However, the explanation of the\nmaximum altitude of the crude sap ascent and consequently the main reason of\nthe maximum size that trees can reach is not well understood. According to tree\nspecies, the crude sap is driven in xylem microtubes with diameters ranging\nbetween 50 and 400 micrometers. The sap contains diluted salts but its physical\nproperties are roughly those of water; consequently, hydrodynamic, capillarity\nand osmotic pressure yield a crude sap ascent of a few tens of meters only.\nToday, we can propound a new understanding of the ascent of sap to the top of\nvery tall trees thanks to a new comparison between experiments associated with\nthe cohesion-tension theory and the disjoining pressure concept. Here we show\nthat the pressure in the water-storing tracheids of leaves can be strongly\nnegative whereas the pressure in the xylem microtubes of stems may remain\npositive when, at high level, inhomogeneous liquid nanolayers wet the xylem\nwalls of microtubes. The nanofluidic model of crude sap in tall trees discloses\na stable sap layer up to an altitude where the pancake layer thickness coexists\nwith the dry xylem wall and corresponds to the maximum size of tallest trees.\nIn very thin layers, sap flows are widely more significant than those obtained\nwith classical Navier-Stokes models and consequently are able to refill\nstomatic cells when phloem embolisms supervene.

LISA\nPathfinder -- the in-flight test of the LISA instrumentation -- is currently in\nthe final implementation and planned to be launched in 2014. It will set\nstringent constraints on the ability to put test masses in geodesic motion to\nwithin the required differential acceleration of 3\\times10^{-14} m s^{-2}\nHz^{-1/2} and track their relative motion to within the required differential\ndisplacement measurement noise of 9\\times10^{-12} m Hz^{-1/2}, around 1 mHz.\nGiven the scientific objectives, it will carry out -- for the first time with\nsuch high accuracy required for gravitational wave detection -- the science of\nspacetime metrology, in which the Doppler link between two free-falling test\nmasses measures the curvature.

Hoover's comment [arXiv:1204.0312v2] on our work\n[arXiv:1203.5968], we show explicitly that the divergence of the velocity field\nassociated with the Nos\\'e-Hoover equations is nonzero, implying that those\nequations are not volume preserving, and hence, as often stated in the\nliterature, are not Hamiltonian. We further elucidate that the trajectories\n{q(t)} generated by the Nos\\'e-Hoover equations are generally not identical to\nthose generated by Dettmann's Hamiltonian. Dettmann's Hamiltonian produces the\nsame trajectories as the Nos\\'e-Hoover equations only on a specific energy\nshell, but not on the neighboring ones. This fact explains why the\nNos\\'e-Hoover equations are not volume preserving. The Hamiltonian that we put\nforward with [arXiv:1203.5968] instead produces thermostated dynamics\nirrespective of the energy value. The main advantage of our Hamiltonian\nthermostat over previous ones is that it contains kinetic energy terms that are\nof standard form with coordinate-independent masses and consequently is readily\nmatched in laboratory experiments.\n","Comment: 2 pages, no figures"]}]
