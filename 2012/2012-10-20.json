With shedding, each time a\nlink to a data object is updated by a program, it is determined whether or not\nthe link will possibly be used once again by the program, and if not the link\nis automatically removed. Thus, everything is made garbage as soon as it can be\nviewed as garbage.

In the absence of external sources this is nothing but the\nvacuum energy density. The key element of this derivation is the introduction\nof a temperature dependence into the expression for the bag constant. The\nnon-perturbative part of the analytical equation of state does not depend on\nthe coupling constant, but instead introduces a dependence on the mass gap.\nThis is responsible for the large-scale dynamical structure of the QCD ground\nstate. The perturbative part of the analytical equation of state does depend on\nthe QCD fine-structure coupling constant $\\alpha_s$. Here we develop the\nanalytical formalism, incorporating the perturbative part in a self-consistent\nway. It makes it possible to calculate the PT contributions to the equation of\nstate in terms of the convergent series in integer powers of a small\n$\\alpha_s$. We also explicitly derive and numerically calculate the first\nperturbative contribution of the $\\alpha_s$-order to the non-perturbative part\nof the equation of state derived and calculated previously. The analytical\nequation of state or, equivalently, the gluon pressure is exponentially\nsuppressed at low temperatures, while at temperature $T=T_c = 266.5 \\ \\MeV$ it\nhas a maximum, if divided by $T^4/3$. It demonstrates a highly non-trivial\ndependence on the mass gap and the temperature near to $T_c$ and up to\napproximately $(3-4)T_c$. At very high temperatures its polynomial character is\nconfirmed, containing the terms proportional to $T^2$ and $T$ with a\nnon-analytical dependence on the mass gap.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 7 figures, no tables, and one reference removed. arXiv\n  admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1007.1573"]}]
