Here\nwe show that in strongly phase-mismatched nonlinear frequency conversion\ncrystals the pump pulse can experience a large and extremely broadband\nself-defocusing cascaded Kerr-like nonlinearity. The large cascaded\nnonlinearity is ensured through interaction with the largest quadratic tensor\nelement in the crystal, and the strong phase-mismatch ensures an ultrafast\nnonlinear response with an octave-spanning bandwidth. We verify this\nexperimentally by showing few-cycle soliton compression with noncritical\ncascaded second-harmonic generation: Energetic 47 fs infrared pulses are\ncompressed in a just 1-mm long bulk lithium niobate crystal to 17 fs (under 4\noptical cycles) with 80% efficiency, and upon further propagation an\noctave-spanning supercontinuum is observed. Such ultrafast cascading is\nexpected to occur for a broad range of pump wavelengths spanning the near- and\nmid-IR using standard nonlinear crystals.\n","Comment: resubmitted, revised version, accepted for Phys.

In this paper we theoretically\nconsider the possibility of detecting the ionized bubble around a z=8 quasar\nusing targeted redshifted 21-cm observations with the GMRT. The apparent shape\nand size of the ionized bubble, as seen by a distant observer, depends on the\nparameters \\dot{N}_{phs}/C, x_HI/C and \\tau_Q where \\dot{N}_{phs}, \\tau_Q, x_HI\nand C are respectively the photon emission rate, age of the quasar, the neutral\nfraction and clumping factor of the IGM.Here we have analytically estimated the\nshape and size of a quasar's ionized bubble assuming an uniform IGM and\nignoring other ionizing sources besides the quasar, and used this as a template\nfor matched filter bubble search with the GMRT visibility data. We have assumed\nthat \\dot{N}_{phs} is known from the infrared spectrum and C from theoretical\nconsiderations, which gives us two free parameters x_HI and \\tau_Q for bubble.\nConsidering 1,000 hr of observation, we find that there is a reasonably large\nregion of parameter space where a 3\\sigma detection is possible.

The presence of other\nsources increase the size of the quasar bubble, leading to underestimation of\nx_HI.

However, this does not severely affect parameter\nestimation in the bubbles that are large.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 16 figures, 3 tables. Minor change in text. Accepted for\n  publication in MNRAS"]}]

Any model for the deterministic component of the\nvariation of the signal with time is supported, as is any model of the\nstochastic component on the signal and time variables. Models illustrated here\nare constant and sinusoidal models for the signal mean combined with a Gaussian\nstochastic component, as well as a purely stochastic model, the\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process.

Recent hydrodynamic simulations of\naccretion of solar material onto white dwarfs without mixing always produce a\nthermonuclear runaway and steady burning does not occur. For a broad range in\nWD mass (0.4 Solar masses to 1.35 Solar Masses), the maximum ejected material\noccurs for the 1.25 Solar Mass sequences and then decreases as the white dwarf\nmass decreases. Therefore, the white dwarfs are growing in mass as a\nconsequence of the accretion of solar material and as long as there is no\nmixing of accreted material with core material. In contrast, a thermonuclear\nrunaway in the accreted hydrogen-rich layers on the low luminosity WDs in close\nbinary systems where mixing of core matter with accreted material has occurred\nis the outburst mechanism for Classical, Recurrent, and Symbiotic novae. The\ndifferences in characteristics of these systems is likely the WD mass and mass\naccretion rate.

We also show that the on-diagonal part of the heat\nkernel exhibits corresponding global and local fluctuations as $t\\to0$\nalmost-surely.
