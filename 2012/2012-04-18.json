One way to observe this epoch of the universe is through the Near Infrared\nBackground (NIRB), which contains information about galaxies which may be too\nfaint to be observed individually. We calculate the angular power spectrum\n(C_l) of the NIRB fluctuations caused by the distribution of these galaxies.\nAssuming a complete subtraction of any post-reionization component, C_l will be\ndominated by galaxies responsible for completing reionization (e.g., z~6). The\nshape of C_l at high l is sensitive to the amount of non-linear bias of dark\nmatter halos hosting galaxies. As the non-linear bias depends on the mass of\nthese halos, we can use the shape of C_l to infer typical masses of dark matter\nhalos responsible for completing reionization. We extend our previous study by\nusing a higher-resolution N-body simulation, which can resolve halos down to\n10^8 M_sun. We also include improved radiative transfer, which allows for the\nsuppression of star formation in small-mass halos due to photo-ionization\nheating.

The annihilation gamma spectra characterise\nthe momentum distribution of the electron-positron pair at the instant of\nannihilation. The contribution to the gamma spectra from individual molecular\norbitals is obtained from electron momentum densities calculated using modern\ncomputational quantum chemistry density functional theory tools. The\ncalculation, in its simplest form, effectively treats the low-energy\n(thermalised, room-temperature) positron as a plane wave and gives annihilation\ngamma spectra that are about 40% broader than experiment, although the main\nchemical trends are reproduced. We show that this effective \"narrowing\" of the\nexperimental spectra is due to the action of the molecular potential on the\npositron, chiefly, due to the positron repulsion from the nuclei. It leads to a\nsuppression of the contribution of small positron-nuclear separations where the\nelectron momentum is large. To investigate the effect of the nuclear repulsion,\nas well as that of short-range electron-positron and positron-molecule\ncorrelations, a linear combination of atomic orbital description of the\nmolecular orbitals is employed. It facilitates the incorporation of correction\nfactors which can be calculated from atomic many-body theory and account for\nthe repulsion and correlations. Their inclusion in the calculation gives gamma\nspectrum linewidths that are in much better agreement with experiment.\nFurthermore, it is shown that the effective distortion of the electron momentum\ndensity, when it is observed through positron annihilation gamma spectra, can\nbe approximated by a relatively simple scaling factor.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 12 figures"]}]

In\nparticular for a pseudo-scalar meson field theory such kind of states were\nderived by Pauli and Dancoff in 1942 with equal amount of spin and isospin.\nThey can be understood as arising from excitation of the pionic cloud of the\nnucleon by which the main part of nuclear forces also is coming out. The\nexcitation of these states also is the mechanism by which the pion-nucleon\nresonance scattering is originated which firstly was experimentally discovered\nby Fermi in 1955.\n  In the following contribution a completion of the method of Wentzel and Pauli\n& Dancoff is sketched following a work of the author and treating the\npion-nucleon resonance scattering. By means of a canonical and nonlinear\ntransformation of variables the original meson field is split into a free meson\npart and a self field part of the nucleon. The transformation is defined such\nthat the interaction between the compound nucleon system thus arising and the\nfree mesons vanish in the case of infinitely strong coupling. The solution of\nthis field splitting problem is presented and the problem of calculating the\npion-nucleon resonance scattering from this strong-coupling theory is treated\non this basis. Numerical results obtained from such a calculation are\ndiscussed. For the sake of simplicity the symmetric pseudoscalar\nfixed-and-extended-source meson field theory is used and found that the lowest\npion-nucleon resonance scattering is quite well reproduced with essentially the\nsame parameters necessary to reproduce the nucleon-nucleon-potential. The\npresent investigation will serve to guide more extended considerations in this\ndirection.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 1 figure"]}]

It is to identify, understand,\nanalyze and evaluate public's expectation on e-health in Brunei. A\nquestionnaire was designed to gather quantitative and qualitative data to\nsurvey patients, patient's family, and health practitioners at hospitals,\nclinics, or home care centers in Brunei starting from February to March, 2011.\nA 25-item Likert-type survey instrument was specifically developed for this\nstudy and administered to a sample of 366 patients. The data were analyzed to\nprovide initial ideas and recommendation to policy makers on how to move\nforward with the e-health initiative as a mean to improve healthcare services.\nThe survey revealed that there exists a high demand and expectation from people\nin Brunei to have better healthcare services accessible through an e-health\nsystem in order to improve health literacy as well as quality and efficiency of\nhealthcare. Regardless of the limitations of the survey, the general public has\nresponded with a great support for the capabilities of an e-health system\nlisted from the questionnaires. The results of the survey provide a solid\nfoundation for our on going research project to proceed further to develop a\nmodel of e-health and subsequently develop a system prototype that incorporate\nexpectations from the people.\n","Comment: CiiT International Journal of Automation and Autonomous System, 2012"]}]

On the other\nhand, servers are required to store a verification table containing user\nidentities and passwords. Recently, On the base on Sood et al.'s\nprotocol(2011), Li et al. proposed an improved dynamic identity based\nauthentication and key agreement protocol for multi-server architecture(2012).\nLi et al. claims that the proposed scheme can make up the security weaknesses\nof Sood et al.'s protocol. Unfortunately, our further research shows that Li et\nal.'s protocol contains several drawbacks and can not resist some types of\nknown attacks, such as replay attack, Deny-of-Service attack, internal attack,\neavesdropping attack, masquerade attack, and so on. In this paper, we further\npropose a light dynamic pseudonym identity based authentication and key\nagreement protocol for multi-server architecture. In our scheme, service\nproviding servers don't need to maintain verification tables for users. The\nproposed protocol provides not only the declared security features in Li et\nal.'s paper, but also some other security features, such as traceability and\nidentity protection.\n","Comment: 21pages, 2 fingures"]}]
