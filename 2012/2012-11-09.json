In\nthis setting, frugality [Archer&Tardos'02] provides a measure to evaluate the\n\"cost of truthfulness\", that is, the overpayment of a truthful mechanism\nrelative to the \"fair\" payment. We propose a uniform scheme for designing\nfrugal truthful mechanisms for general set systems. Our scheme is based on\nscaling the agents' bids using the eigenvector of a matrix that encodes the\ninterdependencies between the agents. We demonstrate that the r-out-of-k-system\nmechanism and the \\sqrt-mechanism for buying a path in a graph [Karlin et.\nal'05] can be viewed as instantiations of our scheme. We then apply our scheme\nto two other classes of set systems, namely, vertex cover systems and k-path\nsystems, in which a customer needs to purchase k edge-disjoint source-sink\npaths. For both settings, we bound the frugality of our mechanism in terms of\nthe largest eigenvalue of the respective interdependency matrix. We show that\nour mechanism is optimal for a large subclass of vertex cover systems\nsatisfying a simple local sparsity condition. For k-path systems, while our\nmechanism is within a factor of k + 1 from optimal, we show that it is, in\nfact, optimal, when one uses a modified definition of frugality proposed in\n[Elkind et al.'07]. Our lower bound argument combines spectral techniques and\nYoung's inequality, and is applicable to all set systems. As both r-out-of-k\nsystems and single path systems can be viewed as special cases of k-path\nsystems, our result improves the lower bounds of [Karlin et al.'05] and answers\nseveral open questions proposed in that paper.\n"]}]

We employ a\npeer-to-peer framework where the vehicles/nodes can get pairwise\nmultipath-degraded ranging estimates in local neighborhoods together with a\nfixed number of anchor nodes. The challenge is to overcome the\nmultipath-barrier with redundancy in order to provide the desired accuracies\nespecially under severe multipath conditions when the fraction of received\nsignals corrupted by multipath is dominating. We invoke a analytical graphical\nmodel framework based on particle filtering and reveal its high accuracy\nlocalization promise through simulations. We also address design questions such\nas \"How many anchors and what fraction of line-of-sight (LOS) measurements are\nneeded to achieve a specified target accuracy?\", by analytically characterizing\nthe performance improvement in localization accuracy as a function of the\nnumber of nodes in the network and the fraction of LOS measurements. In\nparticular, for a static node placement, we show that the Cramer-Rao Lower\nBound (CRLB), a fundamental lower bound on the localization accuracy, can be\nexpressed as a product of two factors - a scalar function that depends only on\nthe parameters of the noise distribution and a matrix that depends only on the\ngeometry of node locations and the underlying connectivity graph. Further, a\nsimplified expression is obtained for the CRLB that helps deduce the scaling\nbehavior of the estimation error as a function of the number of agents and\nanchors in the network. The bound suggests that even a small fraction of LOS\nmeasurements can provide significant improvements. Conversely, a small fraction\nof NLOS measurements can significantly degrade the performance. The analysis is\nextended to the mobile setting and the performance is compared with the derived\nCRLB.\n"]}]

The main\nresult of this work is the functional representation of the extended AKNS\nhierarchy, composed of both positive (classical) and negative flows. We derive\na finite set of functional equations, constructed by means of the Miwa's\nshifts, which contains all equations of the hierarchy. Using the obtained\nfunctional representation we convert the nonlocal equations of the negative\nsubhierarchy into local systems of higher order, derive the generating function\nof the conservation laws and the N-dark-soliton solutions for the extended AKNS\nhierarchy. As an additional result we obtain the functional representation of\nthe Landau-Lifshitz hierarchy.\n","Comment: 20 pages"]}]

We study events of the 23th solar cycle, in which major\nnon-recurrent geomagnetic storms (GMS) with Dst <-100 nT are sufficiently\nreliably identified with their solar sources in the central part of the disk.\nUsing the SOHO/EIT 195 A images and MDI magnetograms, we select significant\ndimming and arcade areas and calculate summarized unsigned magnetic fluxes in\nthese regions at the photospheric level. The high relevance of this eruption\nparameter is displayed by its pronounced correlation with the Forbush decrease\n(FD) magnitude, which, unlike GMSs, does not depend on the sign of the Bz\ncomponent but is determined by global characteristics of ICMEs. Correlations\nwith the same magnetic flux in the solar source region are found for the GMS\nintensity (at the first step, without taking into account factors determining\nthe Bz component near the Earth), as well as for the temporal intervals between\nthe solar eruptions and the GMS onset and peak times. The larger the magnetic\nflux, the stronger the FD and GMS intensities are and the shorter the ICME\ntransit time is. The revealed correlations indicate that the main quantitative\ncharacteristics of major non-recurrent space weather disturbances are largely\ndetermined by measurable parameters of solar eruptions, in particular, by the\nmagnetic flux in dimming areas and arcades, and can be tentatively estimated in\nadvance with a lead time from 1 to 4 days.

We augment these AOSI activities\nwith an additional test that analyzes asymmetrical patterns in unsupported\ngait.

We present an analytic characterization of the\noptimal policy, along with the associated finite-horizon time-averaged value of\nstorage. We also derive an analytical upperbound on the infinite-horizon\ntime-averaged value of storage. This bound is valid for any achievable\nrealization of prices when the support of the distribution is fixed, and\nhighlights the dependence of the value of storage on ramp constraints and\nstorage capacity. While the value of storage is a non-decreasing function of\nprice volatility, due to the finite ramp rate, the value of storage saturates\nquickly as the capacity increases, regardless of volatility. To study the\nimplications of the optimal policy, we first present computational experiments\nthat suggest that optimal utilization of storage can, in expectation, induce a\nconsiderable amount of price elasticity near the average price, but little or\nno elasticity far from it. We then present a computational framework for\nunderstanding the behavior of storage as a function of price and the amount of\nstored energy, and for characterization of the buy/sell phase transition region\nin the price-state plane. Finally, we study the impact of market-based\noperation of storage on the required reserves, and show that the reserves may\nneed to be expanded to accommodate market-based storage.\n"]}]

In standard cosmology, it is assumed that the universe\nis homogeneous, but this is not true at small scales (<200 Mpc). Since general\nrelativity, which is the basis of modern cosmology, is a non-linear theory, one\ncan expect some backreactions in the case of an inhomogeneous matter\ndistribution. Estimates of the magnitude of these backreactions (feedback)\nrange from insignificant to being perfectly able to explain the accelerated\nexpansion of the universe. In the end, the only way to be sure is to test\npredictions of inhomogeneous cosmological theories, such as timescape\ncosmology, against observational data.
