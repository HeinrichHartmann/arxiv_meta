Estimating dynamic\nnetworks is a difficult task since the number of components involved in the\nsystem is very large. As a result, the number of parameters to be estimated is\nbigger than the number of observations. However, a characteristic of many\nnetworks is that they are sparse. For example, the molecular structure of genes\nmake interactions with other components a highly-structured and therefore\nsparse process.\n  Penalized Gaussian graphical models have been used to estimate sparse\nnetworks.

The explanation of how mechanics\nof the $SP$ leads to the account of dissipative forces is submitted. The\nderivation of Lagrange, Hamilton and Liouville equations for $SP$ Is shown. The\nquestion of why the motions of the SP are determined by the two types of\nsymmetry: internal symmetry of the system and symmetry of space and how it\nleads to two types of energy and forces accordingly are discussed.

This class of random graphs was introduced by Krioukov et\nal. We provide a rigorous analysis of aspects of this model and its dependence\non the parameter \\beta, verifying some of their observations. We show that a\nphase transition occurs around \\beta =1.

(b-bit) Minwise hashing requires an expensive preprocessing step that\ncomputes k (e.g., 500) minimal values after applying the corresponding\npermutations for each data vector. We developed a parallelization scheme using\nGPUs and observed that the preprocessing time can be reduced by a factor of\n20-80 and becomes substantially smaller than the data loading time.\n  2. One major advantage of b-bit minwise hashing is that it can substantially\nreduce the amount of memory required for batch learning. However, as online\nalgorithms become increasingly popular for large-scale learning in the context\nof search, it is not clear if b-bit minwise yields significant improvements for\nthem. This paper demonstrates that $b$-bit minwise hashing provides an\neffective data size/dimension reduction scheme and hence it can dramatically\nreduce the data loading time for each epoch of the online training process.\nThis is significant because online learning often requires many (e.g., 10 to\n100) epochs to reach a sufficient accuracy.\n  3. Another critical issue is that for very large data sets it becomes\nimpossible to store a (fully) random permutation matrix, due to its space\nrequirements. Our paper is the first study to demonstrate that $b$-bit minwise\nhashing implemented using simple hash functions, e.g., the 2-universal (2U) and\n4-universal (4U) hash families, can produce very similar learning results as\nusing fully random permutations.

In this paper we assume that\nthe 3-brane is a de Sitter space; there is only one extra spatial dimension,\nassumed to be time dependent. By using the form of the brane-world\nenergy-momentum tensor suggested by Shiromizu et al. in the five-dimensional\nEinstein equations, it is proposed that the cosmological expansion of the\n3-brane may provide a possible explanation for the collapse of the extra\ndimension, as well as for the energy stored in the resulting curled-up\ndimension. More precisely, whenever the bulk cosmological constant \\Lambda is\nnegative, the extra spatial dimension rapidly shrinks during the inflation of\nthe brane. When \\Lambda is positive, on the other hand, the extra spatial\ndimension either completely follows the cosmological expansion of the brane or\ncompletely ignores it, thereby shrinking relative to the expanding space. This\nbehavior resembles the all-or-nothing behavior of ordinary systems in an\nexpanding universe, as recently demonstrated by R.H. Price.\n","Comment: Invited talk at the Fifth International Conference of Applied\n  Mathematics and Computing in Plovdiv, Bulgaria (August, 2008)"]}]
