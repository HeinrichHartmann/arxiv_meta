Many natural families of\nchains are believed to exhibit cutoff, and yet establishing this fact is often\nextremely challenging. An important such family of chains is the random walk on\n$\\G(n,d)$, a random $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices. It is well known that\nalmost every such graph for $d\\geq 3$ is an expander, and even essentially\nRamanujan, implying a mixing-time of $O(\\log n)$. According to a conjecture of\nPeres, the simple random walk on $\\G(n,d)$ for such $d$ should then exhibit\ncutoff with high probability. As a special case of this, Durrett conjectured\nthat the mixing time of the lazy random walk on a random 3-regular graph is\nw.h.p. $(6+o(1))\\log_2 n$.\n  In this work we confirm the above conjectures, and establish cutoff in\ntotal-variation, its location and its optimal window, both for simple and for\nnon-backtracking random walks on $\\G(n,d)$. Namely, for any fixed $d\\geq3$, the\nsimple random walk on $\\G(n,d)$ w.h.p. has cutoff at $\\frac{d}{d-2}\\log_{d-1}\nn$ with window order $\\sqrt{\\log n}$. Surprisingly, the non-backtracking random\nwalk on $\\G(n,d)$ w.h.p. has cutoff already at $\\log_{d-1} n$ with constant\nwindow order. We further extend these results to $\\G(n,d)$ for any $d=n^{o(1)}$\nthat grows with $n$ (beyond which the mixing time is O(1)), where we establish\nconcentration of the mixing time on one of two consecutive integers.\n","Comment: 33 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Furthermore, these limit\ntheorems provide the basis for a general Langevin approximation to PDMPs, i.e.,\nstochastic partial differential equations that are expected to be similar in\ntheir dynamics to PDMPs. We apply these results to compartmental-type models of\nspatially extended excitable membranes.
