The parameter $M$ is considered as a new\nuniversal physical constant of Nature and therefore is called the fundamental\nmass. It is introduced in a purely geometrical way, like the velocity of light\nas a maximal velocity in the special relativity. If one chooses the Euclidean\nformulation of quantum field theory, the adequate realization of the limiting\nmass hypothesis is reduced to the choice of the de Sitter geometry as the\ngeometry of the 4-momentum space. All fields, defined in de Sitter p-space in\nconfigurational space obey five dimensional Klein-Gordon type equation with\nfundamental mass $M$ as a mass parameter. The role of dynamical field variables\nis played by the Cauchy initial conditions given at $x_5 = 0$, guarantying the\nlocality and gauge invariance principles. The corresponding to the geometrical\nrequirements formulation of the theory of scalar, vector and spinor fields is\nconsidered in some detail. On a simple example it is demonstrated that the\nspontaneously symmetry breaking mechanism leads to renormalization of the\nfundamental mass $M$. A new geometrical concept of the chirality of the fermion\nfields is introduced. It would be responsible for new measurable effects at\nhigh energies $E \\geq M$. Interaction terms of a new type, due to the existence\nof the Higgs boson are revealed. The most intriguing prediction of the new\napproach is the possible existence of exotic fermions with no analogues in the\nSM, which may be candidate for dark matter constituents.\n","Comment: 28 pages"]}]

These distributions are thought to describe stress behavior\ninfluenced by various random factors: post-earthquake stress time history is\ndescribed by a Brownian motion. Both distributions decay to zero for time\nintervals close to zero. But this feature contradicts the high immediate\naftershock level according to Omori's law. We propose that these statistical\ndistributions are influenced by the power-law stress distribution near the\nearthquake focal zone and we derive new distributions as a mixture of power-law\nstress with the exponent psi and Levy as well as IGD distributions. Such new\ndistributions describe the resulting inter-earthquake time intervals and\nclosely resemble Omori's law. The new Levy distribution has a pure power-law\nform with the exponent -(1+psi/2) and the mixed IGD has two exponents: the same\nas Levy for small time intervals and -(1+psi) for longer times. For even longer\ntime intervals this power-law behavior should be replaced by a uniform\nseismicity rate corresponding to the long-term tectonic deformation. We compute\nthese background rates using our former analysis of earthquake size\ndistribution and its connection to plate tectonics.

The difficulty comes\nfrom the assumption that decisions are irrevocable: if we choose to accept an\nelement when it is presented by the stream then we can never get rid of it, and\nif we choose not to accept it then we cannot later add it. Babaioff, Immorlica,\nand Kleinberg [SODA 2007] introduced this problem, gave O(1)-competitive\nalgorithms for certain classes of matroids, and conjectured that every matroid\nadmits an O(1)-competitive algorithm. However, most matroids that are known to\nadmit an O(1)-competitive algorithm can be easily represented using graphs\n(e.g. graphic and transversal matroids). In particular, there is very little\nknown about F-representable matroids (the class of matroids that can be\nrepresented as elements of a vector space over a field F), which are one of the\nfoundational matroid classes. Moreover, most of the known techniques are as\ndependent on graph theory as they are on matroid theory. We go beyond graphs by\ngiving an O(1)-competitive algorithm for regular matroids (the class of\nmatroids that are representable over every field), and use techniques that are\nmatroid-theoretic rather than graph-theoretic. We use the regular matroid\ndecomposition theorem of Seymour to decompose any regular matroid into matroids\nwhich are either graphic, cographic, or isomorphic to R_{10}, and then show how\nto combine algorithms for these basic classes into an algorithm for regular\nmatroids. This allows us to generalize beyond regular matroids to any class of\nmatroids that admits such a decomposition into classes for which we already\nhave good algorithms. In particular, we give an O(1)-competitive algorithm for\nthe class of max-flow min-cut matroids.\n","Comment: 21 pages"]}]

However, in practice, it is often the\ncase that a form of prior information is available about the specific class of\ntarget problems. Prior knowledge is rarely used in current solutions due to the\nlack of a systematic approach to incorporate it into the E/E strategy.\n  To address a specific class of E/E problems, we propose to proceed in three\nsteps: (i) model prior knowledge in the form of a probability distribution over\nthe target class of E/E problems; (ii) choose a large hypothesis space of\ncandidate E/E strategies; and (iii), solve an optimization problem to find a\ncandidate E/E strategy of maximal average performance over a sample of problems\ndrawn from the prior distribution.\n  We illustrate this meta-learning approach with two different hypothesis\nspaces: one where E/E strategies are numerically parameterized and another\nwhere E/E strategies are represented as small symbolic formulas. We propose\nappropriate optimization algorithms for both cases. Our experiments, with\ntwo-armed Bernoulli bandit problems and various playing budgets, show that the\nmeta-learnt E/E strategies outperform generic strategies of the literature\n(UCB1, UCB1-Tuned, UCB-v, KL-UCB and epsilon greedy); they also evaluate the\nrobustness of the learnt E/E strategies, by tests carried out on arms whose\nrewards follow a truncated Gaussian distribution.\n","Comment: 16 pages, Springer Selection of papers of ICAART'12"]}]

Using a generic form of\nthese rules we explore the collective behavior and emergent dynamics of a\nsimulated swarm. For a wide range of flock size and interaction extent (the\nfixed number of neighbors with which an individual will interact) we find that\nthe computational collective is inherently stable --- individuals are attracted\nto one another and will position themselves a preferred distance from their\nfixed neighbors within a rigid lattice. Nonetheless, the irregular overall\nshape of the flock, coupled with the need for individuals on the boundary to\nmove towards their neighbors creates a torque which leads the flock to rotate\nand then meander. We argue that this \"rolling meander\" is a very good proxy for\nreal collective behavior in animal species and yet arises from a simple\nhomogeneous and deterministic rule for interaction. Rather than then introduce\nleaders --- which has already been shown, quite straightforwardly, to drive\ncollective swarms such as this --- we introduce a small number of \"followers\".\nEach follower is bound to consider a random fixed individual to be among their\nneighbors, irrespective of actual metric distance between them. We find that\nthe introduction of a small number of such followers causes a phase transition\nthat quickly leads to instability in the flock structure (as no stable\nconfiguration arises) and the previously rigid crystalline interaction among\nneighbors now becomes fluid: the distance between neighbors decreases, the\nflock ceases to rotate and meanders less.\n","Comment: Work in progress - 5 pages, 4 figures"]}]
