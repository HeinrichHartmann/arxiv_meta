While a strong interaction\nbetween SN ejecta and dense circumstellar media (CSM) is a leading scenario,\nalternative models have been proposed. In this Letter, we suggest new\ndiagnostics to discriminate the strong SN-CSM interaction scenario from the\nothers: a decline in the luminosity ('dip') before the main peak of the light\ncurve. This dip is an unavoidable consequence of having a dense CSM within\nwhich the shock breakout occurs. If a dense CSM shell is located far at large\nradii from the progenitor inside, it takes time for the SN ejecta to reach it\nand the early light curve can be powered by the SN ejecta before the collision.\nOnce the SN ejecta collides with the dense CSM, the electron density and thus\nthe Thomson scattering opacity suddenly increase. Photons become unable to go\nout of the shock even if there is a source of emission inside, which results in\nthe dip in the light curve. This dip is a solid prediction from the strong\ninteraction scenario irrespective of a power source for the early emission.\nEventually the forward shock breaks out from within the dense CSM, and the\nluminosity increases by the continuous strong SN-CSM interaction, resulting in\nan SLSN. The possible dip observed in the hydrogen-poor SLSN, 2006oz, could be\nthe first example of this signature and give support to the SN-CSM interaction\nas the power source of SLSN 2006oz.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 1 figure, 1 table, accepted by The Astrophysical Journal\n  Letters"]}]

The notion of `restricted'\nbackward security is that the adversary misses the protocol transcripts which\nare needed to update the compromised secret key.

Tidal dissipation at successive periastron\npassages removes orbital energy of the planet, which has the potential for\nchanges in semi-major axis of a factor of ten to a thousand. In the equilibrium\ntide approximation we show that, in order for high-eccentricity migration to\ntake place, the relative level of tidal dissipation in Jupiter analogues must\nbe at least 10 times higher than the upper-limit attributed to the Jupiter-Io\ninteraction. While this is not a severe problem for high-e migration, it\ncontradicts the results of several previous calculations. We show that these\ncalculations of high-e migration inadvertently over-estimated the strength of\ntidal dissipation by three to four orders of magnitude.

Implications for tidal theory as well as models of the\ninflated radii of hot Jupiters are discussed.

We model a coronal loop as an isolated, thin,\nmagnetic fibril that is anchored at two points in the photosphere. The\nequilibrium shape of the loop is determined by a balance between magnetic\nbuoyancy and magnetic tension, which is characterized by a Magnetic Bond Number\n\\epsilon, that is typically small |\\epsilon| << 1. This balance produces a loop\nthat has a variable radius of curvature. The resonant kink waves of such a loop\ncome in two polarizations that are decoupled from each other: waves with motion\ncompletely within the plane of the loop (normal oscillations) and waves with\nmotions that are completely horizontal, perpendicular to the plane of the loop\n(binormal oscillations). We solve for the eigensolutions of both polarizations\nusing perturbation theory for small Magnetic Bond Number. For modes of the same\norder, normal oscillations have smaller eigenfrequencies than binormal\noscillations. The additional forces of buoyancy and magnetic tension from the\ncurvature of the loop increase and decrease the mode frequencies, respectively.\nThe ratio of the frequencies of the first overtone to the fundamental mode is\nmodified by the inclusion of buoyancy and curvature.
