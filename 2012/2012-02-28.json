The density is assumed to be smooth, have bounded support, and\nbe uniformly bounded from below on this set. Unlike previous $k$-NN estimators\nof non-linear density functionals, the proposed estimator uses data-splitting\nand boundary correction to achieve lower mean square error. Specifically, we\nassume that $T$ i.i.d. samples ${X}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ from the density are\nsplit into two pieces of cardinality $M$ and $N$ respectively, with $M$ samples\nused for computing a k-nearest-neighbor density estimate and the remaining $N$\nsamples used for empirical estimation of the integral of the density\nfunctional. By studying the statistical properties of k-NN balls, explicit\nrates for the bias and variance of the BPI estimator are derived in terms of\nthe sample size, the dimension of the samples and the underlying probability\ndistribution. Based on these results, it is possible to specify optimal choice\nof tuning parameters $M/T$, $k$ for maximizing the rate of decrease of the mean\nsquare error (MSE).

However, the light field emitted by a single atom can exhibit\nmuch richer dynamics. A prominent example is the predicted ability for a single\natom to produce quadrature-squeezed light, with sub-shot-noise amplitude or\nphase fluctuations. It has long been foreseen, though, that such squeezing\nwould be \"at least an order of magnitude more difficult\" to observe than the\nemission of single photons. Squeezed beams have been generated using\nmacroscopic and mesoscopic media down to a few tens of atoms, but despite\nexperimental efforts, single-atom squeezing has so far escaped observation.\nHere we generate squeezed light with a single atom in a high-finesse optical\nresonator. The strong coupling of the atom to the cavity field induces a\ngenuine quantum mechanical nonlinearity, several orders of magnitude larger\nthan for usual macroscopic media. This produces observable quadrature squeezing\nwith an excitation beam containing on average only two photons per system\nlifetime. In sharp contrast to the emission of single photons, the squeezed\nlight stems from the quantum coherence of photon pairs emitted from the system.\nThe ability of a single atom to induce strong coherent interactions between\npropagating photons opens up new perspectives for photonic quantum logic with\nsingle emitters\n","Comment: Main paper (4 pages, 3 figures) + Supplementary information (5 pages,\n  2 figures).

The situation smoothly evolves towards a\nregular anharmonic behavior as Te is substituted for Se and long range magnetic\norder is replaced by superconductivity. Irrespective to Se contents, excess Fe\nis shown to provide an additional damping channel for the B$_{1g}$ phonon at\nlow temperatures.

This may be due to excess Fe-induced local\nmagnetism and low energy magnetic fluctuations that can not be treated\naccurately within these approaches. As recently revealed by neutron scattering\nand $\\mu$-SR studies, these phenomena occur in the temperature range where\nanomalous decay of the B$_{1g}$ phonon is observed, and suggests a peculiar\ncoupling of this mode with local moments and spin fluctuations in\nFe$_{1+y}$Te$_{1-x}$Se$_{x}$.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables, to appear in Phys.

The same sparse matrix is multiplied by a\ndense vector repeatedly in these solvers. Matrices with irregular sparsity\npatterns make it difficult to utilize cache locality effectively in SpMxV\ncomputations. In this work, we investigate single- and multiple-SpMxV\nframeworks for exploiting cache locality in SpMxV computations. For the\nsingle-SpMxV framework, we propose two cache-size-aware top-down\nrow/column-reordering methods based on 1D and 2D sparse matrix partitioning by\nutilizing the column-net and enhancing the row-column-net hypergraph models of\nsparse matrices. The multiple-SpMxV framework depends on splitting a given\nmatrix into a sum of multiple nonzero-disjoint matrices so that the SpMxV\noperation is performed as a sequence of multiple input- and output- dependent\nSpMxV operations. For an effective matrix splitting required in this framework,\nwe propose a cache- size-aware top-down approach based on 2D sparse matrix\npartitioning by utilizing the row-column-net hypergraph model. For this\nframework, we also propose two methods for effective ordering of individual\nSpMxV operations. The primary objective in all of the three methods is to\nmaximize the exploitation of temporal locality.

In our first contribution, we establish a relation between\nthe cover times of a pair of graphs, and the cover time of their Cartesian\nproduct. This extends previous work on special cases of the Cartesian product,\nin particular, the square of a graph. We show that when one of the factors is\nin some sense larger than the other, its cover time dominates, and can become\nwithin a logarithmic factor of the cover time of the product as a whole. Our\nmain theorem effectively gives conditions for when this holds. The techniques\nand lemmas we introduce may be of independent interest.

This is a graph picked uniformly at\nrandom from all simple graphs with that degree sequence.

Such systems, with\nthe closed loop damping remaining invariant to gain changes can be used to\nproduce dead-beat step response with only rise time varying with gain. This\ntechnique is used to achieve an active step-back in a Pressurized Heavy Water\nReactor (PHWR) where it is desired to change the reactor power to a\npre-determined value within a short interval keeping the power undershoot as\nlow as possible. This paper puts forward an approach as an alternative for the\npresent day practice of a passive step-back mechanism where the control rods\nare allowed to drop during a step-back action by gravity, with release of\nelectromagnetic clutches. The reactor under a step-back condition is identified\nas a system using practical test data and a suitable Proportional plus Integral\nplus Derivative (PID) controller is designed for it. Then the combined plant is\naugmented with a phase shaper to achieve a dead-beat response in terms of power\ndrop. The fact that the identified static gain of the system depends on the\ninitial power level at which a step-back is initiated, makes this application\nparticularly suited for using a FO phase shaper.

Although the performance\ngains of cooperative approaches are well known, the combinatorial nature of\nthese schemes makes it difficult to design efficient polynomial-time algorithms\nfor joint routing, scheduling and power control. This becomes more so when\nthere is more than one flow in the network. It has been conjectured by many\nauthors, in the literature, that the multiflow problem in cooperative networks\nis an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we formulate the problem, as a\ncombinatorial optimization problem, for a general setting of $k$-flows, and\nformally prove that the problem is not only NP-hard but it is\n$o(n^{1/7-\\epsilon})$ inapproxmiable.

We further prove that for a special case of k = 1 the\nsolution is a simple path, and devise a polynomial time algorithm for jointly\noptimizing routing, scheduling and power control. We then use this algorithm to\nestablish analytical upper and lower bounds for the optimal performance for the\ngeneral case of $k$ flows. Furthermore, we propose a polynomial time heuristic\nfor calculating the solution for the general case and evaluate the performance\nof this heuristic under different channel conditions and against the analytical\nupper and lower bounds.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 5 figures"]}]
