The main point of\nour theory is that above quasiparticles form so-called fermion-condensate\nstate, achieved by a fermion condensation quantum phase transition (FCQPT).\nWhen a heavy fermion liquid undergoes FCQPT, the fluctuations accompanying\nabove quantum critical point are strongly suppressed and cannot destroy the\nquasiparticles. The comparison of our theoretical results with experimental\ndata on CeCoIn5 have shown that the electronic system of above substance\nprovides a unique opportunity to study the relationship between quasiparticles\nproperties and non-Fermi liquid behavior.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 1 figure. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:cond-mat/0602602"]}]
