In this paper we\ndescribe our work on implementing RBMM for the logic programming language\nMercury. One interesting point about Mercury is that it is designed with strong\ntype, mode, and determinism systems. These systems not only provide Mercury\nprogrammers with several direct software engineering benefits, such as\nself-documenting code and clear program logic, but also give language\nimplementors a large amount of information that is useful for program analyses.\nIn this work, we make use of this information to develop program analyses that\ndetermine the distribution of data into regions and transform Mercury programs\nby inserting into them the necessary region operations. We prove the\ncorrectness of our program analyses and transformation. To execute the\nannotated programs, we have implemented runtime support that tackles the two\nmain challenges posed by backtracking. First, backtracking can require regions\nremoved during forward execution to be \"resurrected\"; and second, any memory\nallocated during a computation that has been backtracked over must be recovered\npromptly and without waiting for the regions involved to come to the end of\ntheir life.

The branching\nprocess during lung development has been studied in great detail and is\nremarkably stereotyped. The branched tree is generated by the sequential,\nnon-random use of three geometrically simple modes of branching (domain\nbranching, planar and orthogonal bifurcation). While many regulatory components\nand local interactions have been defined an integrated understanding of the\nregulatory network that controls the branching process is lacking. We have\ndeveloped a deterministic, spatio-temporal differential-equation based model of\nthe core signaling network that governs lung branching morphogenesis. The model\nfocuses on the two key signaling factors that have been identified in\nexperiments, fibroblast growth factor (FGF10) and sonic hedgehog (SHH) as well\nas the SHH receptor patched (Ptc). We show that the reported biochemical\ninteractions give rise to a Schnakenberg-type Turing patterning mechanisms that\nallows us to reproduce experimental observations in wildtype and mutant mice.\nThe kinetic parameters as well as the domain shape are based on experimental\ndata where available. The developed model is robust to small absolute and large\nrelative changes in the parameter values. At the same time there is a strong\nregulatory potential in that the switching between branching modes can be\nachieved by targeted changes in the parameter values. We note that the sequence\nof different branching events may also be the result of different growth\nspeeds: fast growth triggers lateral branching while slow growth favours\nbifurcations in our model.

It is largely accepted that the mobility-limiting\nfactor in graphene is the Coulomb scattering off of charged impurities that\nreside either on graphene or in the underlying substrate. This is true both for\ntraditional graphene devices on SiO2 substrates and possibly for the recently\nreported high-mobility suspended and supported devices. An attractive approach\nto reduce such scattering is to place graphene in an environment with high\nstatic dielectric constant \\kappa\\ that would effectively screen the electric\nfield due to the impurities. However, experiments so far report only a modest\neffect of high-\\kappa\\ environment on mobility. Here, we investigate the effect\nof the dielectric environment of graphene by studying electrical transport in\nmulti-terminal graphene devices that are suspended in liquids with \\kappa\\\nranging from 1.9 to 33. For non-polar liquids (\\kappa <5) we observe a rapid\nincrease of \\mu\\ with \\kappa\\ and report a record room-temperature mobility as\nlarge as ~60,000 cm2/Vs for graphene devices in anisole (\\kappa=4.3), while in\npolar liquids (\\kappa >18) we observe a drastic drop in mobility. We\ndemonstrate that non-polar liquids enhance mobility by screening charged\nimpurities adsorbed on graphene, while charged ions in polar liquids cause the\nobserved mobility suppression. Furthermore, using molecular dynamics simulation\nwe establish that scattering by out-of-plane flexural phonons, a dominant\nscattering mechanism in suspended graphene in vacuum at room temperature, is\nsuppressed by the presence of liquids. We expect that our findings may provide\navenues to control and reduce carrier scattering in future graphene-based\nelectronic devices.\n","Comment: To Appear in Nature Communications (2012)"]}]

In the case of\ngene regulatory networks (GRNs) they correspond to stable genes profiles\nassociated to the various cell types.

We start this paper by proving that, if we\nfix the values of the source nodes (nodes with in-degree 0), the expected\nnumber of fixed points of any RBN is one (independently of the topology we\nchoose). For finding such fixed points we use the {\\alpha}-asynchronous\ndynamics (where every node is updated independently with probability 0 <\n{\\alpha} < 1). In fact, it is well-known that asynchrony avoids the cycle\nattractors into which parallel dynamics tends to fall. We perform simulations\nand we show the remarkable property that, if for a given RBN with scale-free\ntopology and {\\alpha}-asynchronous dynamics an initial configuration reaches a\nfixed point, then every configuration also reaches a fixed point. By contrast,\nin the parallel regime, the percentage of initial configurations reaching a\nfixed point (for the same networks) is dramatically smaller.
