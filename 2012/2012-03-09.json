Hartrill at Cornell University, Ithaca, USA. Oscillating Superleak\nTransducers (OST) detect the heat transferred from a cavity's quench point via\n\"Second Sound\" through the superfluid He bath, needed to cool the\nsuperconducting cavity. The observed response of an OST is a complex, but\nreproducible pattern of oscillations. A small helium evaporation cryostat was\nbuilt which allows the investigation of the response of an OST in greater\ndetail. The distance between a point-like electrical heater and the OST can be\nvaried. The OST can be mounted either parallel or perpendicular to the plate,\nhousing the heat source. If the artificial quench-point releases an amount of\nenergy compatible to a real quench spot on a cavity's surface, the OST signal\nstarts with a negative pulse, which is usually strong enough to allow automatic\ndetection. Furthermore, the reflection of the Second Sound on the wall is\nobserved. A reflection coefficient R = 0.39 +- 0.05 of the glass wall is\nmeasured. This excludes a strong influence of multiple reflections in the\ncomplex OST response. Fourier analyses show three main frequencies, found in\nall OST spectra.
