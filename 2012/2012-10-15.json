Potential applications of\nthe surface states in low dissipation electronic devices have motivated efforts\nto create nanoscale samples with large surface-to-volume ratios and highly\ncontrolled stoichiometry. Se vacancies in Bi2Se3 give rise to bulk conduction,\nwhich masks the transport properties of the surface states. We have therefore\ndeveloped a new route for the synthesis of topological insulator nanostructures\nusing metalorganic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD). MOCVD allows for control\nof the Se/Bi flux ratio during growth. With the aim of rational growth, we vary\nthe Se/Bi flux ratio, growth time, and substrate temperature, and observe\nmorphological changes which indicate a growth regime in which nanoribbon\nformation is limited by the Bi precursor mass-flow. MOCVD growth of Bi2Se3\nnanostructures occurs via a distinct growth mechanism that is nucleated by gold\nnanoparticles at the base of the nanowire. By tuning the reaction conditions,\nwe obtain either single-crystalline ribbons up to 10 microns long or thin\nmicron-sized platelets.\n","Comment: Related papers at http://pettagroup.princeton.edu"]}]

The SDW wave vector connects points (hot spots)\non opposite sides of the Fermi surface. The Fermi velocities at these pairs of\npoints are in general not parallel. Here we consider the case where pairs of\nhot spots coalesce, and the wave vector (\\pi,\\pi) of the SDW connects hot spots\nwith parallel Fermi velocities. Using the specific example of electron-doped\ncuprates, we first show that Kanamori screening and generic features of the\nLindhard function make this case experimentally relevant. The temperature\ndependence of the correlation length, the spin susceptibility and the\nself-energy at the hot spots are found using the Two-Particle-Self-Consistent\ntheory and specific numerical examples worked out for parameters characteristic\nof the electron-doped cuprates. While the curvature of the Fermi surface at the\nhot spots leads to deviations from perfect nesting, the pseudo-nesting\nconditions lead to drastic modifications to the temperature dependence of these\nphysical observables: Neglecting logarithmic corrections, the correlation\nlength \\xi scales like 1/T, i.e. z=1 instead of the naive z=2, the (\\pi,\\pi)\nstatic spin susceptibility \\chi like $1/\\sqrt T$, and the imaginary part of the\nself-energy at the hot spots like $T^{3/2}$. The correction $T_1^{-1}\\sim\nT^{3/2}$ to the Korringa NMR relaxation rate is subdominant. We also consider\nthis problem at zero temperature, or for frequencies larger than temperature,\nusing a field-theoretical model of gapless SDW fluctuations interacting with\nfermions. The imaginary part of the fermionic self-energy close to the hot\nspots scales as $-\\omega^{3/2}\\log\\omega$. This is less singular than earlier\npredictions of the form $-\\omega\\log\\omega$.

A low complexity adaptive algorithm using a quantizer with adjustable\ninput gain and offset is presented. Three possible scalar models for the\nparameter to be estimated are considered: constant, Wiener process and Wiener\nprocess with deterministic drift. After showing that the algorithm is\nasymptotically unbiased for estimating a constant, it is shown, in the three\ncases, that the asymptotic mean squared error depends on the Fisher information\nfor the quantized measurements. It is also shown that the loss of performance\ndue to quantization depends approximately on the ratio of the Fisher\ninformation for quantized and continuous measurements. At the end of the paper\nthe theoretical results are validated through simulation under two different\nclasses of noise, generalized Gaussian noise and Student's-t noise.\n"]}]
