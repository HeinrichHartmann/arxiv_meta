For the original version of the model, with only\ntwo scalar triplets, we show that the entire Lagrangian is invariant under a\nPQ-like symmetry but no axion is produced since an U(1) subgroup remains\nunbroken. Although in this case the strong CP problem can still be solved, the\nsolution is largely disfavored since three quark states are left massless to\nall orders in perturbation theory. The addition of a third scalar triplet\nremoves the massless quark states but the resulting axion is visible. In order\nto become realistic the model must be extended to account for massive quarks\nand invisible axion. We show that the addition of a scalar singlet together\nwith a Z_N discrete gauge symmetry can successfully accomplish these tasks and\nprotect the axion field against quantum gravitational effects.

First, we revisit the variational problem (VP) associated with the SRBM.\nBuilding on Avram, Dai and Hasenbein (2001), we show that the value of the VP\nat a point in the quadrant is equal to the optimal value of a linear function\nover a convex domain.

A novel method, called\nadaptive generalized approximate message passing (Adaptive GAMP), that enables\njoint learning of the statistics of the prior and measurement channel along\nwith estimation of the unknown vector $\\xbf$ is presented. The proposed\nalgorithm is a generalization of a recently-developed EM-GAMP that uses\nexpectation-maximization (EM) iterations where the posteriors in the E-steps\nare computed via approximate message passing. The methodology can be applied to\na large class of learning problems including the learning of sparse priors in\ncompressed sensing or identification of linear-nonlinear cascade models in\ndynamical systems and neural spiking processes. We prove that for large i.i.d.\nGaussian transform matrices the asymptotic componentwise behavior of the\nadaptive GAMP algorithm is predicted by a simple set of scalar state evolution\nequations. In addition, we show that when a certain maximum-likelihood\nestimation can be performed in each step, the adaptive GAMP method can yield\nasymptotically consistent parameter estimates, which implies that the algorithm\nachieves a reconstruction quality equivalent to the oracle algorithm that knows\nthe correct parameter values. Remarkably, this result applies to essentially\narbitrary parametrizations of the unknown distributions, including ones that\nare nonlinear and non-Gaussian. The adaptive GAMP methodology thus provides a\nsystematic, general and computationally efficient method applicable to a large\nrange of complex linear-nonlinear models with provable guarantees.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 3 figures"]}]

There has\nbeen many efforts to extend stable model semantics so that answer set programs\ncan use a more extensive syntax. To such endeavor, the community of\nnon-monotonic reasoning has introduced extensions such as equilibrium models\nand FLP semantics. However, both of these extensions suffer from two problems:\nintended models according to such extensions (1) are not guaranteed to be\nminimal, and (2) more importantly, may have self-justifications (i.e., the\njustification for pertinence of an atom in an intended model may be its own\npertinence). Both of these properties directly violate the spirit of stable\nmodel semantics. Therefore, we believe that we need a new extension of stable\nmodel semantics that guarantees both minimality and being strongly grounded.\n  This paper introduces one such extension using two different approaches:\nfirstly, by extending the goal-reachability interpretation of logic programs to\nthe full propositional language and, secondly, using derivability in\nintuitionistic propositional logic. We show that both these approaches give the\nsame semantics, that we call the supported semantics. Moreover, using the first\napproach, we also extend well-founded semantics to full propositional language.\nFurthermore, we discuss how our supported models relate to other existing\nsemantics for non-monotonic reasoning including the equilibrium models. Last,\nbut not the least, we discuss the complexity of reasoning about supported\nmodels and show that all interesting reasoning tasks (such as brave/cautious\nreasoning) are PSPACE-complete.

Basic principles related to crown shape,\nenergy optimization and the finite size scaling approach were used to define a\nset of relationships based on a single parameter, which allows us to predict\nthe slope of the tree-size distributions in a steady state condition. We tested\nthe model predictions on four temperate mountain forests.

With the famous Cramer's rule for the\nset of linear equations, we are able to give the general form of the solution\nand prove that it is unique. In second, the central idea of the SQPT is to\nprepare a set of linearly independent inputs and measuring the outputs via the\nquantum state tomography (QST). Letting the inputs and the measurements be\nprepared by two sets of the rank-one positive-operator-valued measures [POVMs],\nwhere each POVM is supposed to be linearly independent and informationally\ncomplete (IC), we observe that SQPT now is equivalent to deciding a unknown\nstate with a set of product IC-POVM in the $d^2$-dimensional Hilbert space.\nFollowing the general linear state tomography theory, we show that the product\nsymmetric IC-POVM should minimize the mean-square Hilbert-Schmidt distance\nbetween the estimator and the true states. So, an optimal SQPT can be realized\nby preparing both the inputs and the measurements as the symmetric IC-POVM.\n","Comment: 16 pages"]}]

We find that for 71 BMI\nclusters the absolute K-band luminosity of cDs depends on the cluster richness,\nbut less strongly on the cluster velocity dispersion.

In contrast, for NBMI clusters the cD luminosity decreases with\nincreasing peculiar velocity. Also, the X-ray luminosity of BMI clusters\ndepends on the cluster velocity dispersion, while in NBMI clusters such a\ncorrelation is absent. These findings favour the cannibalism scenario for the\nformation of cD galaxies. We suggest that cDs in clusters of BMI type were\nformed and evolved preferentially in one and the same cluster.

In order to capture discontinuities of the second order derivative\n$u_{xx}$ of the solution $u$, three independent functions $p_1, p_2$ and $p_3$\nare introduced to represent numerical derivatives using various one-sided\nlimits.

These\nfilters are applied sequentially on degraded underwater images. The literature\nsurvey reveals that image based preprocessing algorithms uses standard filter\ntechniques with various combinations.
