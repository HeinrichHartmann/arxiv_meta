In\nvarious experimental setups it is reasonably straightforward to reconstruct the\nstate of a quantum system employing linear tomographic technique. In this way\nthe elements of the density matrix can be linearly related to a set of measured\nquantities.

We detect HI in ~40% of all ETGs outside the Virgo\ncluster and in ~10% of all ETGs inside it. This demonstrates that it is common\nfor non-cluster ETGs to host HI. The HI morphology varies from regular\ndiscs/rings (the majority of the detections) to unsettled gas distributions.\nThe former are either small discs (M(HI)<10^8 M_sun) confined within the\nstellar body and sharing the same kinematics of the stars, or large discs/rings\n(M(HI) up to 5x10^9 M_sun) extending to tens of kpc from the host galaxy and\nfrequently kinematically decoupled from the stars. Neutral hydrogen provides\nmaterial for star formation in ETGs. Galaxies with central HI exhibit\nsignatures of star formation in ~70% of the cases, ~5 times more frequently\nthan galaxies without central HI. The central ISM is dominated by molecular\ngas. In ETGs with a small gas disc the conversion of HI into H_2 is as\nefficient as in spirals. The ETG HI mass function has M*~2x10^9 M_sun and\nslope=-0.7. ETGs host much less HI than spirals as a family. However, a\nsignificant fraction of them is as HI-rich as spirals. The main difference\nbetween ETGs and spirals is that the former lack the high-column-density HI\ntypical of the bright stellar disc of the latter. We find an envelope of\ndecreasing M(HI) with increasing environment density. The gas-richest ETGs live\nin the poorest environments (where star-formation is more common), galaxies in\nthe centre of Virgo have the lowest HI content, and the cluster outskirts are a\ntransition region. We find an HI morphology-density relation. At low\nenvironment density HI is mostly distributed on large discs/rings. More\ndisturbed HI morphologies dominate environment densities typical of rich\ngroups, confirming the importance of processes occurring on a galaxy-group\nscale for the evolution of ETGs.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication on MNRAS"]}]

In light of this result, it is natural to ask whether such\nimprovements can be achieved using lift-and-project methods. We present a\nsimpler combinatorial algorithm which has nearly the same time-approximation\ntradeoff as the algorithm of Cygan et al., and which lends itself naturally to\na lift-and-project based approach.\n  At a high level, our approach is similar to the recent work of Karlin,\nMathieu, and Nguyen [IPCO 2011], who examined a known PTAS for Knapsack\n(similar to our combinatorial Set-Cover algorithm) and its connection to\nhierarchies of LP and SDP relaxations for Knapsack. For Set-Cover, we show\nthat, indeed, using the trick of \"lifting the objective function\", we can match\nthe performance of our combinatorial algorithm using the LP hierarchy of Lovasz\nand Schrijver. We also show that this trick is essential: even in the stronger\nLP hierarchy of Sherali and Adams, the integrality gap remains at least (1-eps)\nln(n) at level Omega(n) (when the objective function is not lifted).\n  As shown by Aleknovich, Arora, and Tourlakis [STOC 2005], Set-Cover\nrelaxations stemming from SDP hierarchies (specifically, LS+) have similarly\nlarge integrality gaps. This stands in contrast to Knapsack, where Karlin et\nal. showed that the (much stronger) Lasserre SDP hierarchy reduces the\nintegrality gap to (1+eps) at level O(1). For completeness, we show that LS+\nalso reduces the integrality gap for Knapsack to (1+eps). This result may be of\nindependent interest, as our LS+ based rounding and analysis are rather\ndifferent from those of Karlin et al., and to the best of our knowledge this is\nthe first explicit demonstration of such a reduction in the integrality gap of\nLS+ relaxations after few rounds.\n"]}]

The method is based on a causal model for repeated binary\noutcomes (before and after the treatment), which includes individual covariates\nand latent variables for the unobserved heterogeneity between subjects.\nMoreover, given the type of non-compliance, the model assumes the existence of\nthree subpopulations of subjects: compliers, never-takers, and always-takers.\nThe model is estimated by a two-step estimator: at the first step the\nprobability that a subject belongs to one of the three subpopulations is\nestimated on the basis of the available covariates; at the second step the\ncausal effects are estimated through a conditional logistic method, the\nimplementation of which depends on the results from the first step. Standard\nerrors for this estimator are computed on the basis of a sandwich formula. The\napplication shows that prompt coronary angiography in patients with myocardial\ninfarction may significantly decrease the risk of other events within the next\ntwo years, with a log-odds of about -2.

The errors\naffected the sorting of events into the correct left/right and forward/backward\nbins. This produced an incorrect value for the 2008 result, but the 2006 result\nis unaffected. We have conducted two independent reanalyses with these errors\ncorrected, and we present here the corrected values for the 2008 data and the\ncombined results for 2006 and 2008. The new combined spin asymmetry in the\nforward region is A_N = -0.026+/-0.026(stat)+/-0.003(sys).

Indeed, in order to prove Four-Color Conjecture, it clearly\nsuffices to show that all maximal planar graphs are 4-colorable. Since this\nconjecture was proposed in 1852, no mathematical proofs have been invented up\nuntil now. Maybe the main reasons lie in the following three aspects in terms\nof maximal planar graphs: not clearing up the structures, not figuring out the\ncoloring types, and not straightening out the relation between structure and\ncoloring. For this, we will write a series of articles to study the structure\nand coloring theory of maximal planar graphs systematically. This is our first\narticle, which focuses mainly on the structure and coloring relations. First,\nwe introduce a new way to construct maximal planar graphs. The advantage of\nthis method is that it establishes an immediate relation with 4-colorings, and\nreveals how a given maximal planar graph is generated. Second, a special class\nof maximal planar graphs--recursive maximal planar graphs is researched in\ndepth, which lays a foundation for solving the uniquely 4-colorable planar\ngraphs conjecture(see subsequent articles). Third, we discover an important\nmode for classifying 4-colorings: tree-coloring and cycle-coloring, which runs\nthrough the whole series of articles.

For single-CuO_2-layer La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4\n(LSCO) and Bi_2(Sr,La)_2CuO_{6+\\delta} (Bi2201), some experiments seem to\nindicate an onset of SC fluctuations at very high temperatures (2-3 times\nT_c^{max}, the T_c value at optimal hole concentration p), whereas other\nmeasurements suggest that fluctuations are confined to the immediate vicinity\nof T_c(p). Here we use torque magnetization to resolve this conundrum by\nsystematically studying LSCO, Bi2201 and HgBa_2CuO_{4+\\delta} (Hg1201). The\nlatter is a more ideal single-layer compound, featuring high structural\nsymmetry, minimal disorder, and T_c^{max} = 97 K, a value more than twice those\nof LSCO and Bi2201. We find in all three cases that SC diamagnetism vanishes in\nan unusual exponential fashion above T_c, and at a rapid rate that is\nuniversal. Furthermore, the high characteristic fluctuation temperatures of\nLSCO and Bi2201 closely track T_c(p) of Hg1201. These observations suggest\nthat, rather than being indicative of SC diamagnetism, the fluctuations at high\ntemperatures in the low-T_c^{max} compounds are associated with a competing\norder.
