In this paper we propose distributed algorithms for\nsampling networks, so that nodes are selected by a special node, called the\n\\emph{source}, with a given probability distribution. All these algorithms are\nbased on a new class of random walks, that we call Random Centrifugal Walks\n(RCW). A RCW is a random walk that starts at the source and always moves away\nfrom it.\n  Firstly, an algorithm to sample any connected network using RCW is proposed.\nThe algorithm assumes that each node has a weight, so that the sampling process\nmust select a node with a probability proportional to its weight. This\nalgorithm requires a preprocessing phase before the sampling of nodes. In\nparticular, a minimum diameter spanning tree (MDST) is created in the network,\nand then nodes' weights are efficiently aggregated using the tree. The good\nnews are that the preprocessing is done only once, regardless of the number of\nsources and the number of samples taken from the network. After that, every\nsample is done with a RCW whose length is bounded by the network diameter.\n  Secondly, RCW algorithms that do not require preprocessing are proposed for\ngrids and networks with regular concentric connectivity, for the case when the\nprobability of selecting a node is a function of its distance to the source.\n  The key features of the RCW algorithms (unlike previous Markovian approaches)\nare that (1) they do not need to warm-up (stabilize), (2) the sampling always\nfinishes in a number of hops bounded by the network diameter, and (3) it\nselects a node with the exact probability distribution.\n"]}]

Laboratory and field data\nsuggest that these so-called streaming potentials may be several orders of\nmagnitudes larger than theoretical predictions that only consider the influence\nof the relative permeability and electrical conductivity on the self potential\n(SP) data. Recent work has partly improved predictions by considering how the\nvolumetric excess charge in the pore space scales with the inverse of water\nsaturation. We present a new theoretical approach that uses the flux-averaged\nexcess charge, not the volumetric excess charge, to predict streaming\npotentials. We present relationships for how this effective excess charge\nvaries with water saturation for typical soil properties using either the water\nretention or the relative permeability function. We find large differences\nbetween soil types and the predictions based on the relative permeability\nfunction display the best agreement with field data. The new relationships\nbetter explain laboratory data than previous work and allow us to predict the\nrecorded magnitudes of the streaming potentials following a rainfall event in\nsandy loam, whereas previous models predict three orders of magnitude too small\nvalues. We suggest that the strong signals in unsaturated media can be used to\ngain information about fluxes (including very small ones related to film flow),\nbut also to constrain the relative permeability function, the water retention\ncurve, and the relative electrical conductivity function.\n"]}]

For each of its two\n$SO_q(3)$-covariant differential calculi we find its metric, the corresponding\nframe and two torsion-free covariant derivatives that are metric compatible up\nto a conformal factor and which yield both a vanishing linear curvature. A\ndiscussion is given of various ways of imposing reality conditions. The\ndelicate issue of the commutative limit is discussed at the formal algebraic\nlevel. Two rather different ways of taking the limit are suggested, yielding\nrespectively $S^2\\times R$ and $R^3$ as the limit Riemannian manifold.\n","Comment: 29 pages, latex file"]}]
