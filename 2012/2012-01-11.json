As\nLTE Downlink system is a MIMO-OFDMA based system, a cyclic prefix (CP) is\ninserted at the beginning of each transmitted OFDM symbol in order to mitigate\nboth inter-carrier interference (ICI) and inter-symbol interference (ISI). The\ninserted CP is usually equal to or longer than the channel length. However, the\ncyclic prefix can be shorter because of some unforeseen channel behaviour.\nPrevious works have shown that in the case where the cyclic prefix is equal to\nor longer than the channel length, LMMSE performs better than LSE but at the\ncost of computational complexity .In the other case, LMMSE performs also better\nthan LS only for low SNR values. However, LS shows better performance for LTE\nDownlink systems for high SNR values. Therefore, we propose a hybrid LS-LMMSE\nchannel estimation technique robust to the channel length effect.

DDoS attacks are treated as a congestion-control problem, but\nbecause most such congestion is caused by malicious hosts not obeying\ntraditional end-to-end congestion control, the problem must be handled by the\nrouters. Functionality is added to each router to detect and preferentially\ndrop packets that probably belong to an attack. Upstream routers are also\nnotified to drop such packets in order that the router's resources be used to\nroute legitimate traffic hence term pushback. Client puzzles have been\nadvocated as a promising countermeasure to DoS attacks in the recent years. In\norder to identify the attackers, the victim server issues a puzzle to the\nclient that sent the traffic. When the client is able to solve the puzzle, it\nis assumed to be authentic and the traffic from it is allowed into the server.\nIf the victim suspects that the puzzles are solved by most of the clients, it\nincreases the complexity of the puzzles. This puzzle solving technique allows\nthe traversal of the attack traffic throughout the intermediate routers before\nreaching the destination. In order to attain the advantages of both pushback\nand puzzle solving techniques, a hybrid scheme called Router based Pushback\ntechnique, which involves both the techniques to solve the problem of DDoS\nattacks is proposed. In this proposal, the puzzle solving mechanism is pushed\nback to the core routers rather than having at the victim.
