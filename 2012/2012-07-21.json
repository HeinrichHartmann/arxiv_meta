In this\npaper, we construct an appearance model using the 3D discrete cosine transform\n(3D-DCT). The 3D-DCT is based on a set of cosine basis functions, which are\ndetermined by the dimensions of the 3D signal and thus independent of the input\nvideo data. In addition, the 3D-DCT can generate a compact energy spectrum\nwhose high-frequency coefficients are sparse if the appearance samples are\nsimilar. By discarding these high-frequency coefficients, we simultaneously\nobtain a compact 3D-DCT based object representation and a signal\nreconstruction-based similarity measure (reflecting the information loss from\nsignal reconstruction). To efficiently update the object representation, we\npropose an incremental 3D-DCT algorithm, which decomposes the 3D-DCT into\nsuccessive operations of the 2D discrete cosine transform (2D-DCT) and 1D\ndiscrete cosine transform (1D-DCT) on the input video data.\n","Comment: 21 pages.
