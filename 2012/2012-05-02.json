Through the electric\nquadrupolar coupling, strain affects the magnetic environment as seen by the\nnuclear spins. To guide prospective single-QD nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)\nas well as dynamic nuclear spin polarization experiments, an atomistic insight\nto the strain and quadrupolar field distributions is presented. A number of\nimplications of the structural and compositional profile of the QD have been\nidentified. A high aspect ratio of the QD geometry enhances the quadrupolar\ninteraction. The inclined interfaces introduce biaxiality and the tilting of\nthe major quadrupolar principal axis away from the growth axis; the alloy\nmixing of gallium into the QD enhances both of these features while reducing\nthe quadrupolar energy. Regarding the NMR spectra, both Faraday and Voigt\ngeometries are investigated, unraveling in the first place the extend of\ninhomogeneous broadening and the appearance of the normally-forbidden\ntransitions. Moreover, it is shown that from the main extend of the NMR spectra\nthe alloy mole fraction of a single QD can be inferred. By means of the\nelement-resolved NMR intensities it is found that In nuclei has a factor of\nfive dominance over those of As. In the presence of an external magnetic field,\nthe borderlines between the quadrupolar and Zeeman regimes are extracted as 1.5\nT for In and 1.1 T for As nuclei.

This abstract considers the framework\nof dynamical networks introduced in our earlier work [1,2], where the network\nis modeled by a system of ordinary differential equations derived from mass\nconservation laws on directed acyclic graphs with a single origin-destination\npair and a constant inflow at the origin. The rate of change of the particle\ndensity on each link of the network equals the difference between the inflow\nand the outflow on that link. The latter is modeled to depend on the current\nparticle density on that link through a flow function. The novel modeling\nelement in this paper is that every link is assumed to have finite capacity for\nparticle density and that the flow function is modeled to be strictly\nincreasing as density increases from zero up to the maximum density capacity,\nand is discontinuous at the maximum density capacity, with the flow function\nvalue being zero at that point. This feature, in particular, allows for the\npossibility of spill-backs in our model.

We highlight the continuity\nof formalism and technique in the transition from dealing with spectra in the\nold quantum theory to dealing with susceptibilities in the new quantum\nmechanics. Our main focus is on the checkered history of a numerical factor in\nthe Langevin-Debye formula for the electric susceptibility of gases. Classical\ntheory predicts that this factor is equal to 1/3. The old quantum theory\npredicted values up to 14 times higher. Van Vleck showed that quantum mechanics\ndoes away with this \"wonderful nonsense\" (as Van Vleck called it) and restores\nthe classical value 1/3. The Langevin-Debye formula thus provides an\ninstructive example of a Kuhn loss in one paradigm shift that was regained in\nthe next. In accordance with Kuhn's expectation that textbooks sweep Kuhn\nlosses under the rug, Van Vleck did not mention this particular Kuhn loss\nanywhere in his 1926 NRC Bulletin (though he prominently did flag a Kuhn loss\nin dispersion theory that had recently been regained). Contrary to Kuhn's\nexpectations, however, he put the regained Kuhn loss in susceptibility theory\nto good pedagogical use in his 1932 book. Kuhn claimed that textbooks must\nsuppress, truncate, and/or distort the prehistory of their subject matter if\nthey are to inculcate the exemplars of the new paradigm in their readers.

However, the recent significant technological breakthroughs\nhave inevitably led to technical \"bottlenecks\" for the application of the new\nprocedures to other tasks. We have developed a protocol for the 3D\nreconstruction of plant organelles and tissues from stacks of two-dimensional\nimages obtained by means of a wide range of electron transmission and light\nmicroscopy. This protocol can be applied to a large set of primary data: live,\nfixed or even paleobotanical material. For tissue reconstruction, we have also\ndeveloped a protocol of cell lineage tracing based on the geometrical\nproperties of plant cells. For the tissue sample consisting of $n$ cells, this\napproach allows the reconstruction of up to $n-1$ cell divisions from the\nprevious cell generations. Our protocol complements the limitations of clonal\nanalysis and recent real-time approaches of lineage tracing. It works well in\nthe case of tissues with directed and non-directed growth. Using these\nprotocols, the subcellular relations between the complex surface of plastids\nwith stromules and mitochondria in the tuber parenchyma cells in\n\\textit{Corydalis bracteata} have been revealed. Moreover, for the embryo\n($n=17$) and the seedling shoot apex ($n=208$) of \\textit{Calla palustris}, the\ncellular architecture and full cell genealogy of up to 15 cell generations have\nbeen reconstructed. Three relatively independent cell lineages with stem cells\nlocated at the surface of the shoot apex have been found. The possibility of\nusing a wide range of software, including open-source projects, is discussed.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 10 figures, 1 table"]}]
