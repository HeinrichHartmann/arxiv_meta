Our approach is to write a\n6-dimensional matrix as composed of four blocks, each one in the form of a\ncirculant matrix. Use of Sylvester method of inverse orthogonal matrices leads\nto two constraints on the six parameters, and their fulfilment generates\ncomplex Hadamard matrices when the free parameters take values on the unit\ncircle. We hope that the problem of mutually unbiased bases could be solved for\nsix-level systems by using our results.\n","Comment: 13 pages"]}]
