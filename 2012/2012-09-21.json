As the orbit\nof the system decays via gravitational radiation, the orbital frequency\nincreases and sweeps through a series of resonances with the g-modes of the\nwhite dwarf. At each resonance, the tidal force excites the g-mode to a\nrelatively large amplitude, transferring the orbital energy to the stellar\noscillation. We calculate the eigenfrequencies of g-modes and their coupling\ncoefficients with the tidal field for realistic non-rotating white dwarf\nmodels. Using these mode properties, we numerically compute the excited mode\namplitude in the linear approximation as the orbit passes though the resonance,\nincluding the backreaction of the mode on the orbit. We also derive analytical\nestimates for the mode amplitude and the duration of the resonance, which\naccurately reproduce our numerical results for most binary parameters. We find\nthat the g-modes can be excited to a dimensionless (mass-weighted) amplitude up\nto 0.1, with the mode energy approaching $10^{-3}$ of the gravitational binding\nenergy of the star. This suggests that thousands of years prior to the binary\nmerger, the white dwarf may be heated up significantly by tidal interactions.\nHowever, more study is needed since the physical amplitudes of the excited\noscillation modes become highly nonlinear in the outer layer of the star, which\ncan reduce the mode amplitude attained by tidal excitation.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 8 figures"]}]

Our approach is based on Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), with the\nassumption that with yaw pose being the only variable, the facial images should\nlie in a smooth and low dimensional manifold. We horizontally flip the facial\nimages and present two K-nearest neighbor protocols for the original images and\nthe flipped images, respectively.

The extended LLE\neliminates the differences (because of background, face position and scale in\nthe whole image and some asymmetry of left-right face) between the original\nfacial image and the flipped facial image at the same yaw pose so that the\nflipped facial images can be used effectively.

It is well known\nthat this model exhibits a phase transition at a critical value of the\ninteraction strength parameter K, in the limit of the number N of rotators\ngoing to infinity. A Fokker-Planck PDE captures the evolution of the empirical\nmeasure of the system as N goes to infinity, at least for finite times and when\nthe empirical measure of the system at time zero satisfies a law of large\nnumbers. The phase transition is reflected in the fact that the PDE for K above\nthe critical value has a stable manifold of stationary solutions, that are\nequivalent up to rotations. These stationary solutions are actually unimodal\ndensities parametrized by the position of their maximum (the synchronization\nphase or center). We characterize the dynamics on times of order N and we show\nsubstantial deviations from the behavior of the solutions of the PDE. In fact,\nif the empirical measure at time zero converges as N goes to infinity to a\nprobability measure (which is away from a thin set that we characterize) and if\ntime is speeded up by N, the empirical measure reaches almost instantaneously a\nsmall neighborhood of the stable manifold, to which it then sticks and on which\na non-trivial random dynamics takes place. In fact the synchronization center\nperforms a Brownian motion with a diffusion coefficient that we compute. Our\napproach therefore provides, for one of the basic statistical mechanics systems\nwith continuum symmetry, a detailed characterization of the macroscopic\ndeviations from the large scale limit -- or law of large numbers -- due to\nfinite size effects.

In addition, there is found a related new symmetry\noperator S for the solutions of the wave equation in that background. That\noperator is a partial differential operator with a leading order time\nderivative of the first order that commutes with a normal form of the wave\noperator. That form is obtained by multiplication of the wave operator from the\nleft with the reciprocal of the coefficient function of its second order time\nderivative. It is shown that S induces an operator that commutes with the\ngenerator of time evolution in a formulation of the initial value problem for\nthe wave equation in the setting of strongly continuous semigroups.\n"]}]
