Optical line emission is characterised by an\nenhanced [SII]/Halpha ratio and a shell-like morphology, correlating with the\nX-ray emission.

We reliably detect soft-band X-ray\nemission from all our input redshift bins except for the highest redshift (z~4)\none.

The objective of semi-supervised classification is to assign a\nlabel to unlabeled nodes using the whole topology of the graph and the labeled\nnodes at our disposal. The BoP betweenness relies on a bag-of-paths framework\nassigning a Boltzmann distribution on the set of all possible paths through the\nnetwork such that long (high-cost) paths have a low probability of being picked\nfrom the bag, while short (low-cost) paths have a high probability of being\npicked.

Intuitively, a\nnode typically receives a high betweenness if it has a large probability of\nappearing on paths connecting two arbitrary nodes of the network. This quantity\ncan be computed in closed form by inverting a n x n matrix where n is the\nnumber of nodes. For the group betweenness, the paths are constrained to start\nand end in nodes within the same class, therefore defining a group betweenness\nfor each class. Unlabeled nodes are then classified according to the class\nshowing the highest group betweenness.

Recent lattice QCD calculations predict a rich\nspectrum of hybrid mesons that have both exotic and non-exotic JPC,\ncorresponding to q q-bar (q=u, d, or s) states coupled with a gluonic field. A\nthorough study of the hybrid spectrum, including the identification of the\nisovector triplet, with charges 0 and +-1, and both isoscalar members, |s\ns-bar> and |u u-bar> + |d d-bar>, for each predicted hybrid combination of JPC,\nmay only be achieved by conducting a systematic amplitude analysis of many\ndifferent hadronic final states. We propose the development of a kaon\nidentification system, supplementing the existing GlueX forward time-of-flight\ndetector, in order to cleanly select meson and baryon decay channels that\ninclude kaons. Once this detector has been installed and commissioned, we plan\nto collect a total of 200 days of physics analysis data at an average intensity\nof 5 x 10^7 tagged photons on target per second.

Therefore, while fake check-ins driven\nfrom the former motive can cause monetary losses, those aiming in virtual\nrewards are also harmful.
