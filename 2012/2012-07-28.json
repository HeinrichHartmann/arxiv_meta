As these wave functions employ correlators for\nthe exact atomic eigenstates they are exact both in the non-interacting and in\nthe atomic limit. We evaluate them in infinite lattice dimensions for all\ninteraction strengths without any restrictions on the structure of the\nHamiltonian or the symmetry of the ground state. The results for the\nground-state energy allow us to derive an effective one-electron Hamiltonian\nfor Landau quasi-particles, applicable for finite temperatures and frequencies\nwithin the Fermi-liquid regime. As applications for a two-band model we study\nthe Brinkman-Rice metal-to-insulator transition at half band-filling, and the\ntransition to itinerant ferromagnetism for two specific fillings, at and close\nto a peak in the density of states of the non-interacting system. Our new\nresults significantly differ from those for earlier Gutzwiller wave functions\nwhere only density-type interactions were included. When the correct spin\nsymmetries for the two-electron states are taken into account, the importance\nof the Hund's-rule exchange interaction is even more pronounced and leads to\nparamagnetic metallic ground states with large local magnetic moments.\nFerromagnetism requires fairly large interaction strengths, and the resulting\nferromagnetic state is a strongly correlated metal.\n","Comment: 37 pages, 10 figures; accepted for publication in Phys.
