Should the final noise be at the lower end of the possible\nrange (200 - 400 electrons) single photon sensitivity can also be achieved at 5\nkeV beam energy.\n  It was shown that charge summing schemes are beneficial when the noise is\nsufficiently low. The total detection rate of events is increased and the\nprobability to count a single event multiple times in adjacent pixels is\nreduced by a factor of up to 40.\n  The entry window of AGIPD allows 3 keV photons to reach the sensitive volume\nwith approximately 70% probability.

The merging process contributed magnetic flux and\ncurrent to the upper branch, resulting in its quasi-static ascent. 2) This\ntransfer might serve as the key mechanism for the upper branch to lose\nequilibrium by reaching the limiting flux that can be stably held down by the\noverlying field or by reaching the threshold of the torus instability. 3) The\nerupting branch first straightened from a reverse S shape that followed the\npolarity inversion line and then writhed into a forward S shape. This shows a\ntransfer of left-handed helicity in a sequence of writhe-twist-writhe. The fact\nthat the initial writhe is converted into the twist of the flux rope excludes\nthe helical kink instability as the trigger process of the eruption, but\nsupports the occurrence of the instability in the main phase, which is indeed\nindicated by the very strong writhing motion. 4) A hard X-ray sigmoid, likely\nof coronal origin, formed in the gap between the two original filament branches\nin the impulsive phase of the associated flare. This supports a model of\ntransient sigmoids forming in the vertical flare current sheet. 5) Left-handed\nmagnetic helicity is inferred for both branches of the dextral filament. 6) Two\ntypes of force-free magnetic configurations are compatible with the data, a\ndouble flux rope equilibrium and a single flux rope situated above a loop\narcade.\n"]}]

Our goal is to select k centers in a graph, and assign each\nnode to a nearby center, so that we respect the capacity constraints on\ncenters.

This problem is NP-hard, even when centers have\nno capacity restrictions and optimal factor 2 approximation algorithms are\nknown. With capacities, when all centers have identical capacities, a 6\napproximation is known with no better lower bounds than for the infinite\ncapacity version.\n  While many generalizations and variations of this problem have been studied\nextensively, no progress was made on the capacitated version for a general\ncapacity function.
