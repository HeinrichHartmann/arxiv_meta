To this end we define what we call an affinity system, which is a set\nof elements, each with a vector characterizing its preference for all other\nelements in the set. We define a natural notion of (potentially overlapping)\ncommunities in an affinity system, in which the members of a given community\ncollectively prefer each other to anyone else outside the community.

Methods: We\nanalyze the nearly complete sample of un-obscured Galactic WC stars, using\noptical spectra as well as ultraviolet spectra when available. The observations\nare fitted with theoretical spectra, using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model\natmosphere code. A large grid of line-blanked models has been established for\nthe range of WC subtypes WC4 - WC8, and smaller grids for the WC9 parameter\ndomain. Both WO stars and WN/WC transit types are also analyzed using special\nmodels. Results: Stellar and atmospheric parameters are derived for more than\n50 GalacticWC and two WO stars, covering almost the whole GalacticWC population\nas far as the stars are single, and un-obscured in the visual.

Conclusions: By comparing the empirical WC positions in the\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram with evolutionary models, and from recent supernova\nstatistics, we conclude that WC stars have evolved from initial masses between\n20 solar masses and 45 Msun.

The sign of $\\Lambda$ provides a criterion for the transition\nbetween the Brazil-nut effect (BNE) and the reverse Brazil-nut effect (RBNE).\nThe present theory incorporates two extra ingredients not accounted for by the\nprevious theoretical attempt. First, the theory is based upon the second Sonine\napproximation to the transport coefficients of the mass flux of intruder.\nSecond, the dependence of the temperature ratio (intruder temperature over that\nof the host granular gas) on the solid volume fraction is taken into account in\nthe first and second Sonine approximations. In order to check the accuracy of\nthe Sonine approximation considered, the Enskog equation is also numerically\nsolved by means of the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method to get the\nkinetic diffusion coefficient $D_0$. The comparison between theory and\nsimulation shows that the second Sonine approximation to $D_0$ yields an\nimprovement over the first Sonine approximation when the intruder is lighter\nthan the gas particles in the range of large inelasticity. With respect to the\nform of the phase diagrams for the BNE/RBNE transition, the kinetic theory\nresults for the factor $\\Lambda$ indicate that while the form of these diagrams\ndepends sensitively on the order of the Sonine approximation considered when\ngravity is absent, no significant differences between both Sonine solutions\nappear in the opposite limit (gravity dominates the thermal gradient).

Such environments are characterized by two\nchallenging features: (a) they have little idle system time to devote on\nphysical design; and (b) there is little, if any, a priori workload knowledge,\nwhile the query and data workload keeps changing dynamically. In such\nenvironments, traditional approaches to index building and maintenance cannot\napply. Database cracking has been proposed as a solution that allows on-the-fly\nphysical data reorganization, as a collateral effect of query processing.\nCracking aims to continuously and automatically adapt indexes to the workload\nat hand, without human intervention. Indexes are built incrementally,\nadaptively, and on demand. Nevertheless, as we show, existing adaptive indexing\nmethods fail to deliver workload-robustness; they perform much better with\nrandom workloads than with others. This frailty derives from the inelasticity\nwith which these approaches interpret each query as a hint on how data should\nbe stored. Current cracking schemes blindly reorganize the data within each\nquery's range, even if that results into successive expensive operations with\nminimal indexing benefit. In this paper, we introduce stochastic cracking, a\nsignificantly more resilient approach to adaptive indexing. Stochastic cracking\nalso uses each query as a hint on how to reorganize data, but not blindly so;\nit gains resilience and avoids performance bottlenecks by deliberately applying\ncertain arbitrary choices in its decision-making. Thereby, we bring adaptive\nindexing forward to a mature formulation that confers the workload-robustness\nprevious approaches lacked.

Instead,\nthey use high-level query languages such as Pig, Hive, or Jaql to express their\ncomplex tasks. The compilers of these languages translate queries into\nworkflows of MapReduce jobs. Each job in these workflows reads its input from\nthe distributed file system used by the MapReduce system and produces output\nthat is stored in this distributed file system and read as input by the next\njob in the workflow. The current practice is to delete these intermediate\nresults from the distributed file system at the end of executing the workflow.\nOne way to improve the performance of workflows of MapReduce jobs is to keep\nthese intermediate results and reuse them for future workflows submitted to the\nsystem. In this paper, we present ReStore, a system that manages the storage\nand reuse of such intermediate results. ReStore can reuse the output of whole\nMapReduce jobs that are part of a workflow, and it can also create additional\nreuse opportunities by materializing and storing the output of query execution\noperators that are executed within a MapReduce job. We have implemented ReStore\nas an extension to the Pig dataflow system on top of Hadoop, and we\nexperimentally demonstrate significant speedups on queries from the PigMix\nbenchmark.\n","Comment: VLDB2012"]}]
