By\nderiving a simple relationship between the exponential tails of the absorption\ncoefficient and the electronic density-of-states, we establish a direct link\nbetween the photoemission and the absorption spectra near the absorption edge.\nThis relationship is subsequently employed to determine the lower bound to the\nUrbach frequency regime.

Finally, We determine the upper bound to the Urbach frequency\nregime by identifying the frequency at which transition to Poisson distribution\ntakes place.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures"]}]

In addition,\nsigns of orbital phase dependent photometric variations, sometimes seen quite\nearly in the development of nova outbursts, are hard to interpret in the\nframework of optically thick envelopes and especially winds. A general\ndiscussion for belief in the presence of optically thick winds with increasing\nejection velocities during the early stages of novae after their explosion,\nmust be given. This has to be done in order to clarify ideas about novae as\nwell as to contribute in particular to the understanding of the behaviour of\nnovae V1500 Cyg and V1493 Aql showing phase dependent variations during very\nearly decline after the outburst. Possible ways of overcoming the apparent\ncontradiction of phase dependent variations through the production of\ndeviations from spherical symmetry of the winds, are looked at and order of\nmagnitude estimates are made for different theoretical scenarios, which might\nproduce such deviations. It is found that large deviations from spherical\nsymmetry of the optically thick winds in early phases after the explosion can\neasily explain the problem of variations. In particular, the presence of a\nmagnetic field might have had a non-negligible effect on the wind of V1500 Cyg,\nwhile at the present there is not enough information available concerning V1493\nAql. Optically thick winds/envelopes are almost certainly present in the early\nstages after optical maximum of a nova, while it is difficult to make pure\nHubble flow models fit the observations of those stages.

We consider the\nstochastic dynamics of the walker on a ratchet with an external periodic\nforcing, in the overdamped case. The coupling of the two particles corresponds\nto a single effective particle, describing the internal degree of freedom, in a\nbistable potential. This double-well potential is subjected to both a periodic\nforcing and noise, and therefore is able to provide a realization of the\nphenomenon of stochastic resonance. The main result is that there is an optimal\namount of noise where the amplitude of the periodic response of the system is\nmaximum, a signal of stochastic resonance, and that precisely for this optimal\nnoise the average velocity of the walker is maximal, implying a strong link\nbetween stochastic resonance and the ratchet effect.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 7 figures"]}]
