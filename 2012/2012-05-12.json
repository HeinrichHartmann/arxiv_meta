To extract the\nresult we work in the Zero-Mass Variable-Flavor-Number scheme(ZM-VFNs) using\nrealistic nonperturbative fragmentation functions obtained through a global fit\nto $e^+e^-$ data from CERN LEP1 and SLAC SLC on the Z-boson resonance. We study\nboth the contribution of the bottom-quark fragmentation and the gluon\nfragmentation to produce the bottom-flavored meson (B-Meson). We find that the\ncontribution of the gluon leads to an appreciable reduction in decay rate at\nlow values of the B-meson energy. It means the NLO corrections are significant.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures"]}]
