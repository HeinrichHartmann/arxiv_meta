It is integrated into the\nANTARES neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea. Its acoustic sensors,\ninstalled at water depths between 2050 and 2300 m, employ piezo-electric\nelements for the broad-band recording of signals with frequencies ranging up to\n125 kHz. The typical sensitivity of the sensors is around -145 dB re 1V/muPa\n(including preamplifier). Completed in May 2008, AMADEUS consists of six\n\"acoustic clusters\", each comprising six acoustic sensors that are arranged at\ndistances of roughly 1 m from each other. Two vertical mechanical structures\n(so-called lines) of the ANTARES detector host three acoustic clusters each.\nSpacings between the clusters range from 14.5 to 340 m. Each cluster contains\ncustom-designed electronics boards to amplify and digitise the acoustic signals\nfrom the sensors. An on-shore computer cluster is used to process and filter\nthe data stream and store the selected events. The daily volume of recorded\ndata is about 10 GB. The system is operating continuously and automatically,\nrequiring only little human intervention. AMADEUS allows for extensive studies\nof both transient signals and ambient noise in the deep sea, as well as signal\ncorrelations on several length scales and localisation of acoustic point\nsources. Thus the system is excellently suited to assess the background\nconditions for the measurement of the bipolar pulses expected to originate from\nneutrino interactions.\n","Comment: 36 pages, 19 figures; v3: Line numbers removed (no changes to text)"]}]

Transport gaps are commonly established via photoemission and\ninverse photoemission spectroscopy (PES/IPES). However, PES and IPES are\nsurface-sensitive, average over a dynamic lattice, and are subject to extrinsic\neffects, leading to significant uncertainty in gaps.

It involves repeated interaction requiring learning in\nthe form of adaption to the human conversation partner. It is a macro-level\npost-hoc test in contrast to the definition of a Turing Machine (TM), which is\na prior micro-level definition. This raises the question of whether learning is\njust another computational process, i.e. can be implemented as a TM.

To\nillustrate this difference we compare (a) designing a TM and (b) learning a TM,\ndefining them for the purpose of the argument. We show that there is a\nwell-defined sequence of problems which are not effectively designable but are\nlearnable, in the form of the bounded halting problem. Some characteristics of\nhuman intelligence are reviewed including it's: interactive nature, learning\nabilities, imitative tendencies, linguistic ability and context-dependency. A\nstory that explains some of these is the Social Intelligence Hypothesis. If\nthis is broadly correct, this points to the necessity of a considerable period\nof acculturation (social learning in context) if an artificial intelligence is\nto pass the TT. Whilst it is always possible to 'compile' the results of\nlearning into a TM, this would not be a designed TM and would not be able to\ncontinually adapt (pass future TTs).

Recently, the $f(T)$ gravity has been invoked as an\nalternative approach for explaining the observed acceleration expansion of the\nUniverse. If gravity is described by a $f(T)$ theory instead of general\nrelativity, there are a number of issues that ought to be reexamined in the\nframework of $f(T)$ theories. In this work, to proceed further with the current\ninvestigation of the limits and potentialities of the $f(T)$ gravity theories,\nwe derive and discuss the bounds imposed by the energy conditions on a general\n$f(T)$ functional form. The null and strong energy conditions in the framework\nof $f(T)$ gravity are derived from first principles, namely the purely\ngeometric Raychaudhuri's equation along with the requirement that gravity is\nattractive. The weak and dominant energy conditions are then obtained in a\ndirect approach via an effective energy-momentum tensor for $f(T)$ gravity.\nAlthough similar, the energy condition inequalities are different from those of\ngeneral relativity (GR), but in the limit $f(T)=T$ the standard forms for the\nenergy conditions in GR are recovered. As a concrete application of the derived\nenergy conditions to locally homogeneous and isotropic $f(T)$ cosmology, we use\nthe recent estimated value of the Hubble parameter to set bounds from the weak\nenergy condition on the parameters of two specific families of $f(T)$ gravity\ntheories.\n","Comment: 8 pages.V2: Typos corrected, refs. added.

The light curve shows three\ndistinct phases of spectral and temporal evolution, implying that the SNe shock\nlikely encountered at least 3 different circumstellar medium regimes. We\ninterpret this as the progenitor of SN 2007bg having at least two distinct\nmass-loss episodes (i.e., phases 1 and 3) during its final stages of evolution,\nyielding a highly-stratified circumstellar medium. Modelling the phase 1 light\ncurve as a freely-expanding, synchrotron-emitting shell, self-absorbed by its\nown radiating electrons, requires a progenitor mass-loss rate of\n\\dot{M}~1.9x10^{-6}(v_{w}/1000 km s^{-1}) Solar masses per year for the last\nt~20(v_{w}/1000 km s^{-1}) yr before explosion, and a total energy of the radio\nemitting ejecta of E\\sim1x10^{48} erg after 10 days from explosion. This places\nSN 2007bg among the most energetic Type Ib/c events. We interpret the second\nphase as a sparser \"gap\" region between the two winds stages. Phase 3 shows a\nsecond absorption turn-on before rising to a peak luminosity 2.6 times higher\nthan in phase 1. Assuming this luminosity jump is due to a circumstellar medium\ndensity enhancement from a faster previous mass-loss episode, we estimate that\nthe phase 3 mass-loss rate could be as high as \\dot{M}<~4.3x10^{-4}(v_{w}/1000\nkm s^{-1}) Solar masses per year. The phase 3 wind would have transitioned\ndirectly into the phase 1 wind for a wind speed difference of ~2. In summary,\nthe radio light curve provides robust evidence for dramatic global changes in\nat least some Ic-BL progenitors just prior (~10-1000 yr) to explosion. The\nobserved luminosity of this SN is the highest observed for a\nnon-gamma-ray-burst broad-lined Type Ic SN, reaching L_{8.46 GHz}~1x10^{29} erg\nHz^{-1} s^{-1}, ~567 days after explosion.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

Variations of the resonance frequency and\nthe quality factor are determined by the change in average charge on the\nquantum dot during a mechanical oscillation.

At bias voltages that exceed the broadening due to\ntunnel coupling, the resonance frequency and quality factor show a double dip\nas a function of gate voltage.

Then the relative or absolute protein abundance is estimated\nwith quantification methods, such as spectral counting. Until now, researchers\nhave been dealing with these two processes separately. In fact, they are two\nsides of same coin in the sense that truly present proteins are those proteins\nwith non-zero abundances. Then, one interesting question is if we regard the\nprotein inference problem as a special protein quantification problem, is it\npossible to achieve better protein inference performance?\n  Contribution: In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using protein\nquantification methods to solve the protein inference problem. Protein\ninference is to determine whether each candidate protein is present in the\nsample or not. Protein quantification is to calculate the abundance of each\nprotein. Naturally, the absent proteins should have zero abundances. Thus, we\nargue that the protein inference problem can be viewed as a special case of\nprotein quantification problem: present proteins are those proteins with\nnon-zero abundances. Based on this idea, our paper tries to use three very\nsimple protein quantification methods to solve the protein inference problem\neffectively.\n  Results: The experimental results on six datasets show that these three\nmethods are competitive with previous protein inference algorithms. This\ndemonstrates that it is plausible to take the protein inference problem as a\nspecial case of protein quantification, which opens the door of devising more\neffective protein inference algorithms from a quantification perspective.\n","Comment: 14 Pages, This paper has submitted to RECOMB2013"]}]

In this paper, we make use of Harmonic index $H(G)$, which is defined as\nthe sum of $\\frac{2}{d_i+d_j}$ over all edges $v_i v_j$ of $G$, to show that\n$R(G) \\ge r(G)-31/105(k-1)$ for any graph with cyclomatic number $k\\ge 1$, and\n$R(T)> r(T)+1/15$ for any tree except even paths. These results improve and\nstrengthen the known results on these conjectures.\n"]}]

Determination of such\ncharacteristics allows for developing methods offering an image of the\nundeformed body. General assumptions about the mechano-elastic properties of\nthe bodies are stated, which lead to two different approaches for obtaining\nbodies' deformation invariants. One was developed to spot deformed body's\nneutral line and its cross sections, while the other solves deformation PDEs by\nperforming a set of equivalent image operations on the deformed body images.\nBoth these processes may furnish a body undeformed version from its deformed\nimage. This was confirmed by obtaining the undeformed shape of deformed\nparasites, cells (protozoa), fibers and human lips. In addition, the method has\nbeen applied to the important problem of parasite automatic classification from\ntheir microscopic images. To achieve this, we first apply the previous method\nto straighten the highly deformed parasites and then we apply a dedicated curve\nclassification method to the straightened parasite contours. It is demonstrated\nthat essentially different deformations of the same parasite give rise to\npractically the same undeformed shape, thus confirming the consistency of the\nintroduced methodology. Finally, the developed pattern recognition method\nclassifies the unwrapped parasites into 6 families, with an accuracy rate of\n97.6 %.\n"]}]

Our method is based on a generalization of the Robinson-Foulds (RF)\ndistance to multi-labeled trees (mul-trees), i.e., gene trees in which multiple\nleaves can have the same label. Unlike most previous phylogenetic methods using\ngene trees, this method does not assume that gene tree incongruence is caused\nby a single, specific biological process, such as gene duplication and loss,\ndeep coalescence, or lateral gene transfer. We prove that it is NP-hard to\ncompute the RF distance between two mul-trees, but it is easy to calculate the\ngeneralized RF distance between a mul-tree and a singly-labeled tree. Motivated\nby this observation, we formulate the RF supertree problem for mul-trees\n(MulRF), which takes a collection of mul-trees and constructs a species tree\nthat minimizes the total RF distance from the input mul-trees. We present a\nfast heuristic algorithm for the MulRF supertree problem. Simulation\nexperiments demonstrate that the MulRF method produces more accurate species\ntrees than gene tree parsimony methods when incongruence is caused by gene tree\nerror, duplications and losses, and/or lateral gene transfer. Furthermore, the\nMulRF heuristic runs quickly on data sets containing hundreds of trees with up\nto a hundred taxa.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 11 figures"]}]

Theory states that as land tides swept by the moon cross fault\nlines, stress in the Earth's plates intensifies, increasing the likelihood of\nsmall earthquakes. This paper studied the association of the moon and sun with\nlarger magnitude earthquakes (magnitude 5 and greater) using a worldwide\ndataset from the USGS.\n  Initially, the positions of the moon and sun were considered separately. The\nmoon showed a reduction of 1.74% (95% confidence) in earthquakes when it was 10\nhours behind a longitude on earth and a 1.62% increase when it was 6 hours\nbehind. The sun revealed even weaker associations (<1%). Binning the data in 6\nhours quadrants (matching natural tide cycles) reduced the associations\nfurther.\n  However, combinations of moon-sun positions displayed significant\nassociations. Cycling the moon and sun in all possible quadrant permutations\nshowed a decrease in earthquakes when they were paired together on the East and\nWest horizons of an earthquake longitude (4.57% and 2.31% reductions). When the\nmoon and sun were on opposite sides of a longitude, there was often a small\n(about 1%) increase in earthquakes.\n  Reducing the bin size from 6 hours to 1 hour produced noisy results. By\nexamining the outliers in the data, a pattern emerged that was independent of\nearthquake longitude. The results showed a significant decrease (3.33% less\nthan expected) in earthquakes when the sun was located near the moon. There was\nan increase (2.23%) when the moon and sun were on opposite sides of the Earth.\n  The association with earthquakes independent of terrestrial longitude\nsuggests that the combined moon-sun tidal forces act deep below the Earth's\ncrust where circumferential forces are weaker.\n"]}]
