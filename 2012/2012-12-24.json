This is because the silent period for decoding\nthe PU's messages for the DPC may not be necessary in the CTR.

One of the standard models are the Achlioptas random graph processes\non a fixed set of $n$ vertices. Here at each step, one chooses two edges\nuniformly at random and then decides which one to add to the existing\nconfiguration according to some criterion. An important class of such rules are\nthe bounded-size rules where for a fixed $K\\geq 1$, all components of size\ngreater than $K$ are treated equally. While a great deal of work has gone into\nanalyzing the subcritical and supercritical regimes, the nature of the critical\nscaling window, the size and complexity (deviation from trees) of the\ncomponents in the critical regime and nature of the merging dynamics has not\nbeen well understood. In this work we study such questions for general\nbounded-size rules. Our first main contribution is the construction of an\nextension of Aldous's standard multiplicative coalescent process which\ndescribes the asymptotic evolution of the vector of sizes and surplus of all\ncomponents. We show that this process, referred to as the standard augmented\nmultiplicative coalescent (AMC) is `nearly' Feller with a suitable topology on\nthe state space. Our second main result proves the convergence of suitably\nscaled component size and surplus vector, for any bounded-size rule, to the\nstandard AMC. The key ingredients here are a precise analysis of the asymptotic\nbehavior of various susceptibility functions near criticality and certain\nbounds from [8], on the size of the largest component in the barely subcritical\nregime.\n","Comment: 49 pages"]}]
