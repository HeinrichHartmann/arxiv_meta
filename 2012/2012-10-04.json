This unique feature induces\nunusual fast-wave non-radiative modes in a epsilon-near-zero material/metal\nbilayer. Excitation of this peculiar mode leads to wide-angle perfect\nabsorption in low-loss ultrathin metamaterials. The ratio of the perfect\nabsorption wavelength to the thickness of the epsilon-near-zero metamaterial\ncan be as high as 10^4; the electromagnetic energy can be confined in a layer\nas thin as {\\lambda}/10000. Unlike conventional fast-wave leaky modes, these\nfast-wave non-radiative modes have quasi-static capacitive features that\nnaturally match with the space-wave field, and thus are easily accessible from\nfree space. The perfect absorption wavelength can be tuned from mid- to\nfar-infrared by tuning the epsilon = 0 wavelength while keeping the thickness\nof the structure unchanged.\n"]}]

Also, the distribution presents scale invariance, which\nimplies that it is not possible to define a characteristic scale for the\nenergy. A simple model to account for this peculiar statistics is a branching\nprocess: the activation or slip of a fault segment can trigger other segments\nto slip, with a certain probability, and so on.

Using the formalism of probability\ngenerating functions we will be able to derive, in an accessible way, the main\nproperties of these models.

Because the\ncharacteristics of these stellar winds vary over the course of the evolution of\nthe star, the circumstellar matter becomes a reflection of the stellar\nevolution and can be used to determine the characteristics of the progenitor\nstar. In particular, whenever a fast wind phase follows a slow wind phase, the\nfast wind sweeps up its predecessor in a shell, which is observed as a\ncircumstellar nebula. We make 2-D and 3-D numerical simulations of fast stellar\nwinds sweeping up their slow predecessors to investigate whether numerical\nmodels of these shells have to be 3-D, or whether 2-D models are sufficient to\nreproduce the shells correctly. We focus on those situations where a fast\nWolf-Rayet (WR) star wind sweeps up the slower wind emitted by its predecessor,\nbeing either a red supergiant or a luminous blue variable. As the fast WR wind\nexpands, it creates a dense shell of swept up material that expands outward,\ndriven by the high pressure of the shocked WR wind. These shells are subject to\na fair variety of hydrodynamic-radiative instabilities. If the WR wind is\nexpanding into the wind of a luminous blue variable phase, the instabilities\nwill tend to form a fairly small-scale, regular filamentary lattice with thin\nfilaments connecting knotty features. If the WR wind is sweeping up a red\nsupergiant wind, the instabilities will form larger interconnected structures\nwith less regularity. Our results show that 3-D models, when translated to\nobserved morphologies, give realistic results that can be compared directly to\nobservations. The 3-D structure of the nebula will help to distinguish\ndifferent progenitor scenarios.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A.

Methods: We have analysed the radio-frequency interference (RFI)\nsituation in two 24-h surveys with Dutch LOFAR stations, covering 30-78 MHz\nwith low-band antennas and 115-163 MHz with high-band antennas. This is a\nsubset of the full frequency range of LOFAR. The surveys have been observed\nwith a 0.76 kHz / 1 s resolution. Results: We measured the RFI occupancy in the\nlow and high frequency sets to be 1.8% and 3.2% respectively. These values are\nfound to be representative values for the LOFAR radio environment. Between day\nand night, there is no significant difference in the radio environment. We find\nthat lowering the current observational time and frequency resolutions of LOFAR\nresults in a slight loss of flagging accuracy. At LOFAR's nominal resolution of\n0.76 kHz and 1 s, the false-positives rate is about 0.5%. This rate increases\napproximately linearly when decreasing the data frequency resolution.\nConclusions: Currently, by using an automated RFI detection strategy, the LOFAR\nradio environment poses no perceivable problems for sensitive observing. It\nremains to be seen if this is still true for very deep observations that\nintegrate over tens of nights, but the situation looks promising. Reasons for\nthe low impact of RFI are the high spectral and time resolution of LOFAR;\naccurate detection methods; strong filters and high receiver linearity; and the\nproximity of the antennas to the ground. We discuss some strategies that can be\nused once low-level RFI starts to become apparent. It is important that the\nfrequency range of LOFAR remains free of broadband interference, such as DAB\nstations and windmills.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A. 15 figures, 16 pages"]}]

From this geometric perspective, we derive new separable NMF\nalgorithms that are highly scalable and empirically noise robust, and have\nseveral other favorable properties in relation to existing methods. A parallel\nimplementation of our algorithm demonstrates high scalability on shared- and\ndistributed-memory machines.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 6 figures"]}]

Because such transitions often\nunfold on temporal and spatial scales that can be difficult to approach by\nexperimental manipulation, research has often relied on historical observations\nas a source of natural experiments. Here we examine a critical difference\nbetween selecting systems for study based on the fact that we have observed a\ncritical transition and those systems for which we wish to forecast the\napproach of a transition. This difference arises by conditionally selecting\nsystems known to experience a transition of some sort and failing to account\nfor the bias this introduces -- a statistical error often known as the\nProsecutor's Fallacy. By analysing simulated systems that have experienced\ntransitions purely by chance, we reveal an elevated rate of false positives in\ncommon warning signal statistics. We further demonstrate a model-based approach\nthat is less subject to this bias than these more commonly used summary\nstatistics. We note that experimental studies with replicates avoid this\npitfall entirely.\n","Comment: 3 figures; Proceedings of the Royal Society B 2012"]}]
