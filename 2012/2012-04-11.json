Since there are three basic physical units, of mass, length and\ntime, there are up to three free parameters in such a rescaling of the units,\n$N_f \\leq 3$. In Newtonian hydrodynamics, e.g., there are indeed usually three\nfree parameters, $N_f = 3$. If, however, the dynamical equations contain a\nuniversal dimensional constant, such as the speed of light in vacuum $c$ or the\ngravitational constant $G$, then the requirement that its value remains the\nsame imposes a constraint on the rescaling, which reduces its number of free\nparameters by one, to $N_f = 2$. This is the case, for example, in\nmagneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) or special relativistic hydrodynamics, where $c$\nappears in the dynamical equations and forces the length and time units to\nscale by the same factor, or in Newtonian gravity where the gravitational\nconstant $G$ appears in the equations. More generally, when there are $N_{udc}$\nindependent (in terms of their units) universal dimensional constants, then the\nnumber of free parameters is $N_f = max(0,3-N_{udc})$. When both gravity and\nrelativity are included, there is only one free parameter ($N_f = 1$, as both\n$G$ and $c$ appear in the equations so that $N_{udc} = 2$), and the units of\nmass, length and time must all scale by the same factor.
