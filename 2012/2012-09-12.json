Coordinated resource allocation is the\nkey to efficient performance, but the demand on backhaul signaling and\ncomputational resources grows rapidly with number of cells, terminals, and\nsubcarriers. To handle this, we propose a novel multicell framework with\ndynamic cooperation clusters where each terminal is jointly served by a small\nset of base stations. Each base station coordinates interference to neighboring\nterminals only, thus limiting backhaul signalling and making the framework\nscalable. This framework can describe anything from interference channels to\nideal joint multicell transmission.\n  The resource allocation (i.e., precoding and scheduling) is formulated as an\noptimization problem (P1) with performance described by arbitrary monotonic\nfunctions of the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios (SINRs) and arbitrary\nlinear power constraints. Although (P1) is non-convex and difficult to solve\noptimally, we are able to prove: 1) Optimality of single-stream beamforming; 2)\nConditions for full power usage; and 3) A precoding parametrization based on a\nfew parameters between zero and one.

This is necessary to detect the\nexistence of spectrum holes without which no other procedure can be fulfilled.\nHowever, simply sensing (cooperatively or not) the energy received from a\nprimary transmitter cannot enable correct dynamic spectrum access. For example,\nthe low strength of a primary transmitter's signal does not assure that there\nwill be no interference to a nearby primary receiver. In addition, the presence\nof a primary transmitter's signal does not mean that CR network users cannot\naccess the spectrum since there might not be any primary receiver in the\nvicinity. Despite the existing elegant and clever solutions to the DSA problem\nno robust, implementable scheme has emerged. In this paper, we challenge the\nbasic premises of the proposed schemes. We further argue that addressing the\ntechnical challenges we face in deploying robust CR networks can only be\nachieved if we radically change the way we design their basic functionalities.\nIn support of our argument, we present a set of real-world scenarios, inspired\nby realistic settings in commercial telecommunications networks, focusing on\nspectrum sensing as a basic and critical functionality in the deployment of\nCRs. We use these scenarios to show why existing DSA paradigms are not amenable\nto realistic deployment in complex wireless environments.\n","Comment: Work in progress"]}]

A number of factors, such as transcription re-initiation, strong\nchromatin regulation or genome neighboring organization, underlie this\ncoupling. However, these factors do not necessarily combine in equivalent ways\nand strengths in all genes. Can we identify then alternative architectures that\nmodulate in distinct ways the linkage of noise and plasticity? Here we first\nshow that strong chromatin regulation, commonly viewed as a source of coupling,\ncan lead to plasticity without noise. The nature of this regulation is relevant\ntoo, with plastic but noiseless genes being subjected to general activators\nwhereas plastic and noisy genes experience more specific repression.\nContrarily, in genes exhibiting poor transcriptional control, it is\ntranslational efficiency what separates noise from plasticity, a pattern\nrelated to transcript length. This additionally implies that genome neighboring\norganization -as modifier- appears only effective in highly plastic genes. In\nthis class, we confirm bidirectional promoters (bipromoters) as a configuration\ncapable to reduce coupling by abating noise but also reveal an important\ntrade-off, since bipromoters also decrease plasticity. This presents ultimately\na paradox between intergenic distances and modulation, with short intergenic\ndistances both associated and disassociated to noise at different plasticity\nlevels.

Moreover, it is possible for a (small)\nstrict subset $\\cl$ of leaf pairs to suffice for reconstructing the tree and\nits edge weights, given just the distances between the leaf pairs in $\\cl$. It\nis known that any set $\\cl$ with this property for a tree in which all interior\nvertices have degree 3 must form a {\\em cover} for $T$ -- that is, for each\ninterior vertex $v$ of $T$, $\\cl$ must contain a pair of leaves from each pair\nof the three components of $T-v$. Here we provide a partial converse of this\nresult by showing that if a set $\\cl$ of leaf pairs forms a cover of a certain\ntype for such a tree $T$ then $T$ and its edge weights can be uniquely\ndetermined from the distances between the pairs of leaves in $\\cl$. Moreover,\nthere is a polynomial-time algorithm for achieving this reconstruction. The\nresult establishes a special case of a recent question concerning `triplet\ncovers', and is relevant to a problem arising in evolutionary genomics.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 2 figures"]}]

The electromagnetic interaction is complementary to\npion scattering in the exploration of the nucleon excitation spectrum. Higher\nmass states often decouple from the $N\\pi$ channel and are not seen in $\\pi N\n\\to \\pi N$. Photoproduction of mesons, such as $K\\Lambda$, $\\omega p$ and\n$\\eta^\\prime p$ may be more sensitive to many of these states. The CLAS\ndetector, combined with the use of energy-tagged polarized photons and\npolarized electrons, as well as polarized targets and the measurement of recoil\npolarization, are the tools needed for a comprehensive nucleon resonance\nprogram. Some of the recently published high statistics data sets had\nsignificant impact on further clarifying the nucleon excitation spectrum.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures, presented at MESON 2012, Krakow"]}]
