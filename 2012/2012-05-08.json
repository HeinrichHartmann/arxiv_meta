Going beyond spherical\nsymmetry, we develop a method to include null infinity in the computational\ndomain. With this method, hyperboloidal initial value problems for the Einstein\nequations can be solved in a scri-fixing general wave gauge. To study spatial\ninfinity, we discuss the conformal Gauss gauge and the reduced general\nconformal field equations from a numerical point of view. This leads us to the\nfirst numerical calculation of the entire Schwarzschild-Kruskal solution\nincluding spatial, null and timelike infinity and the domain close to the\nsingularity.

Each vertex of the network of interactions\nis characterized by a set of $F$ cultural features, each of which can assume\n$q$ states. Pairs of adjacent vertices interact at a rate proportional to the\nnumber of features they share, which results in the interacting pair having one\nmore cultural feature in common. The Axelrod model has been extensively studied\nduring the past ten years, based on numerical simulations and simple mean-field\ntreatments, while there is a total lack of analytical results for the spatial\nmodel itself. Simulation results for the one-dimensional system led physicists\nto formulate the following conjectures. When the number of features $F$ and the\nnumber of states $q$ both equal two, or when the number of features exceeds the\nnumber of states, the system converges to a monocultural equilibrium in the\nsense that the number of cultural domains rescaled by the population size\nconverges to zero as the population goes to infinity. In contrast, when the\nnumber of states exceeds the number of features, the system freezes in a highly\nfragmented configuration in which the ultimate number of cultural domains\nscales like the population size.

This walk is recurrent for lambda>=rho and transient for\n0<lambda<rho, with rho the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue for the (assumed)\nirreducible matrix of expected offspring numbers.

The centerpiece of our\nmethod is the concept of Lyapunov exponents, which are incorporated into the\nanalysis of orbital stability by integrating the Jacobian of the CR3BP and\northogonalizing the tangent vectors via a well-established algorithm originally\ndeveloped by Wolf et al. The criterion for orbital stability based on the\nLyapunov exponents is independently verified by using power spectra. The\nobtained results are compared to results presented in the two previous papers\nof this series. It is shown that the maximum Lyapunov exponent can be used as\nan indicator for chaotic behaviour of planetary orbits, which is consistent\nwith previous applications of this method, particularly studies for the Solar\nSystem. The chaotic behaviour corresponds to either orbital stability or\ninstability, and it depends solely on the mass ratio of the binary components\nand the initial distance ratio of the planet relative to the stellar separation\ndistance. Our theoretical results allow us to link the study of planetary\norbital stability to chaos theory noting that there is a large array of\nliterature on the properties and significance of Lyapunov exponents. Although\nour results are given for the special case of the CR3BP, we expect that it may\nbe possible to augment the proposed Lyapunov exponent criterion to studies of\nplanets in generalized stellar binary systems, which is strongly motivated by\nexisting observational results as well as results expected from ongoing and\nfuture planet search missions.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables; accepted by Astronomy and Astrophysics"]}]

Many research focus on the\nconstruction of bent and hyper-bent functions. In this paper, we consider\nfunctions defined over $\\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ by\n$f_{a,b}:=\\mathrm{Tr}_{1}^{n}(ax^{(2^m-1)})+\\mathrm{Tr}_{1}^{4}(bx^{\\frac{2^n-1}{5}})$,\nwhere $n=2m$, $m\\equiv 2\\pmod 4$, $a\\in \\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ and\n$b\\in\\mathbb{F}_{16}$. When $a\\in \\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ and $(b+1)(b^4+b+1)=0$,\nwith the help of Kloosterman sums and the factorization of $x^5+x+a^{-1}$, we\npresent a characterization of hyper-bentness of $f_{a,b}$. Further, we use\ngeneralized Ramanujan-Nagell equations to characterize hyper-bent functions of\n$f_{a,b}$ in the case $a\\in\\mathbb{F}_{2^{\\frac{m}{2}}}$.\n"]}]

The hydrodynamic equations\ndescribe the evolution of the electron density, electric field and the complex\namplitude of the Bloch oscillations for the electron current density and the\nmean energy density. These equations contain averages over the Bloch phase\nwhich are integrals of the unknown electric field and are derived by singular\nperturbation methods.

At higher temperature (300 K) only Bloch oscillations remain. These\nnovel solutions are found for restitution coefficients in a narrow interval\nbelow their critical values and disappear for larger values.

Both properties are known to favor the evolution of\ncooperation on networks. Interestingly, a mixture of migration and rewiring is\neven more favorable for the evolution of cooperation than rewiring on its own.\nWhile most models only consider a single type of reaction to adverse\nneighborhoods, the coexistence of several such reactions may actually be an\noptimal setting for the evolution of cooperation.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 5 figures; accepted for publication in PLoS ONE"]}]
