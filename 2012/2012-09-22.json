The material's structure has been\nfully characterized by Rietveld refinement of high resolution synchrotron X-ray\ndiffraction data; tilts and rotations of the IrO_6 octahedra are observed as a\nresult of a bond mismatch between in-plane Ir-O and Cu-O bond lengths.\nDC-susceptibility measurements evidence a complex set of magnetic transitions\nupon cooling that are characteristic of a reentrant spin-glass ground-state.\nThe glassy character of the lowest temperature, Tg=10 K, transition is further\nconfirmed by AC-susceptibility measurements, showing a characteristic frequency\ndependence that can be well fitted by the Vogel-Fulcher law and yields a value\nof \\Delta_(T_f)/[T_f \\Delta log({\\omega})] =0.015(1), typical of dilute\nmagnetic systems. Electronic transport measurements show the material to be\nsemiconducting at all temperatures with no transition to a superconducting\nstate. Negative magnetoresistance is observed when the material is cooled below\n25 K, and the magnitude of this magnetoresistance is seen to increase upon\ncooling to a value of MR = -9 % at 8 K.\n"]}]
