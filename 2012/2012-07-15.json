The\nsky of an event is the subset of N defined by all null geodesics through that\nevent, and is an embedded Legendrian submanifold of N diffeomorphic to a\n(d-1)-dimensional sphere. It was conjectured by Low that for d=2 two events are\ncausally related iff their skies are linked (in an appropriate sense). We use\nthe contact structure and knot polynomial calculations to prove this conjecture\nin certain particular cases, and suggest that for d=3 smooth linking should be\nreplaced with Legendrian linking.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 14 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:gr-qc/0108061"]}]
