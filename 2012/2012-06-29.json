Lehmer's conjecture"],"description":["  In 1947, Lehmer conjectured that the Ramanujan $\\tau$-function $\\tau (m)$\nnever vanishes for all positive integers $m$, where the $\\tau (m)$ are the\nFourier coefficients of the cusp form $\\Delta_{24}$ of weight 12. Lehmer\nverified the conjecture in 1947 for $m<214928639999$. In 1973, Serre verified\nup to $m<10^{15}$, and in 1999, Jordan and Kelly for $m<22689242781695999$.\n  The theory of spherical $t$-design, and in particular those which are the\nshells of Euclidean lattices, is closely related to the theory of modular\nforms, as first shown by Venkov in 1984. In particular, Ramanujan's\n$\\tau$-function gives the coefficients of a weighted theta series of the\n$E_{8}$-lattice. It is shown, by Venkov, de la Harpe, and Pache, that $\\tau\n(m)=0$ is equivalent to the fact that the shell of norm $2m$ of the\n$E_{8}$-lattice is an 8-design. So, Lehmer's conjecture is reformulated in\nterms of spherical $t$-design.\n  Lehmer's conjecture is difficult to prove, and still remains open. In this\npaper, we consider toy models of Lehmer's conjecture. Namely, we show that the\n$m$-th Fourier coefficient of the weighted theta series of the\n$\\mathbb{Z}^2$-lattice and the $A_{2}$-lattice does not vanish, when the shell\nof norm $m$ of those lattices is not the empty set. In other words, the\nspherical 5 (resp. 7)-design does not exist among the shells in the\n$\\mathbb{Z}^2$-lattice (resp. $A_{2}$-lattice).\n","Comment: 12 pages"]}]

In this paper, we apply the well-known coset technique\nto derive the most general effective lagrangian describing the Goldstone field\nand matter fields, consistent with the assumed symmetries. The resulting action\ncaptures the low energy dynamics of any pseudo-conformal realization, including\nthe U(1)-invariant quartic model and the Galilean Genesis scenario. We also\nderive this lagrangian using an alternative method of curvature invariants,\nconsisting of writing down geometric scalars in terms of the conformal mode.\nUsing this general effective action, we compute the two-point function for the\nGoldstone and a fiducial weight-0 field, as well as some sample three-point\nfunctions involving these fields.\n","Comment: 49 pages. v2: minor corrections, added references. v3: minor edits,\n  version appearing in JCAP"]}]

The models in\nthe second class are Kinetically Constrained Models (KCM): their Hamiltonian is\nthat of independent spins in a constant magnetic field, hence their\nthermodynamics is completely trivial, but the dynamics is such that only groups\nof spin can flip together, thus implementing a kinetic constraint that induces\na non-trivial dynamical behavior. A mapping between some representatives of\nthese two classes has been known for long.

This allows us to show that a RFOT model can be mapped\nexactly into a KCM.

Therefore, if one were to study the KCM without knowing of the\nmapping onto the RFOT model, one would guess that its physics is quite\ndifferent from the RFOT one.

The new formula for n particles in the k R-charge sector is an\nintegral over the Grassmannian G(2,n) and uses the Veronese map into G(k,n).\nThe image of a point in G(2,n) is required to be in the \"complement\" of a\n2|8-plane thus making the SU(8) R-symmetry manifest. The integrand is the ratio\nof two determinants. The numerator is an analog of Hodges' recent determinant\nformula for MHV amplitudes.
