However in the BEC\nregime the pair breaking and phase coherence temperature scales are very\ndifferent such that non-pair breaking disorder can affect dramatically phase\ncoherence, and thus the critical temperature, without the requirement of\nbreaking tightly-bound fermion pairs simultaneously. In this case, Anderson's\ntheorem does not apply, and the critical temperature can be more easily reduced\nin comparison to the BCS limit.

The SDW gap has Dirac nodes, because\nmany orbitals participate in the electronic states near the Fermi energy.

The lower-temperature component, with elemental abundances of near\nthe solar values, likely originates from the forward shocked interstellar\nmedium, while the Fe-rich ejecta is described by the hotter plasma. From the\nmorphologies of the forward and reverse shocks in the west region, the total\nejecta mass is estimated to be 1-2M_sun for the typical explosion energy of ~ 1\nx 10^{51} erg. The integrated flux of the Fe-K emission from the entire SNR\nroughly corresponds to a total Fe mass of about 1M_sun. Both of these estimates\nsuggest a Type Ia supernova origin of this SNR. We also find possible evidence\nof an Fe-rich clump located beyond the forward-shock front in the north rim,\nwhich is reminiscent of ejecta knots observed in the Tycho and Vela SNRs.\n","Comment: Published by PASJ"]}]

There are now already many datasets available with diverse\ncharacteristics in terms of size, encoding and structure. These datasets are\noften created and maintained in an ad-hoc manner. Thus, open data poses many\nchallenges and there is a need for effective tools and techniques to manage and\nmaintain it. In this paper we argue that software maintenance and reverse\nengineering have an opportunity to contribute to open data and to shape its\nfuture development. From the perspective of reverse engineering research, open\ndata is a new artifact that serves as input for reverse engineering techniques\nand processes. Specific challenges of open data are document scraping, image\nprocessing, and structure/schema recognition. From the perspective of\nmaintenance research, maintenance has to accommodate changes of open data\nsources by third-party providers, traceability of data transformation\npipelines, and quality assurance of data and transformations.

Its solution is\nof central importance in covariance estimation, particularly in the recent\nhigh-dimensional data environment where enforcing the positive-definiteness\nconstraint could be computationally expensive. We provide a survey of the\nprogress made in modeling covariance matrices from two relatively complementary\nperspectives: (1) generalized linear models (GLM) or parsimony and use of\ncovariates in low dimensions, and (2) regularization or sparsity for\nhigh-dimensional data. An emerging, unifying and powerful trend in both\nperspectives is that of reducing a covariance estimation problem to that of\nestimating a sequence of regression problems. We point out several instances of\nthe regression-based formulation. A notable case is in sparse estimation of a\nprecision matrix or a Gaussian graphical model leading to the fast graphical\nLASSO algorithm. Some advantages and limitations of the regression-based\nCholesky decomposition relative to the classical spectral (eigenvalue) and\nvariance-correlation decompositions are highlighted. The former provides an\nunconstrained and statistically interpretable reparameterization, and\nguarantees the positive-definiteness of the estimated covariance matrix. It\nreduces the unintuitive task of covariance estimation to that of modeling a\nsequence of regressions at the cost of imposing an a priori order among the\nvariables.
