Here, we\npresent an alternative application for such devices, exploiting recent\nachievements of charge occupation control and the spectral tunability of the\noptical emission of quantum dots by electric fields7 to demonstrate\nhigh-sensitivity electric field measurement. In contrast to existing\nnanometer-scale electric field sensors, such as single electron transistors8-11\nand mechanical resonators12,13, our approach relies on homodyning light\nresonantly Rayleigh scattered from a quantum dot transition with the excitation\nlaser and phase sensitive lock-in detection. This offers both static and\ntransient field detection ability with high bandwidth operation and near unity\nquantum efficiency. Our theoretical estimation of the static field sensitivity\nfor typical parameters, 0.5 V/m/ \\surd Hz, compares favorably to the\ntheoretical limit for single electron transistor-based electrometers. The\nsensitivity level of 5 V/m/ \\surd Hz we report in this work, which corresponds\nto 6.4 * 10-6 e/ \\surd Hz at a distance of 12 nm, is worse than this\ntheoretical estimate, yet higher than any other result attained at 4.2 K or\nhigher operation temperature.\n"]}]

Our analysis shows that $f(R)$\ncosmology allows to explain the PAMELA puzzle for dark matter relic particles\nwith masses of the order or lesser than $10^2$ GeV in the regime $\\rho^c\n\\lesssim \\rho^m $ where $\\rho^c$ is the curvature density and $\\rho^m$ the\nradiation density. For the model $f(R)=R+\\alpha R^n$, it then follows that\n$n\\simeq 1$ and small corrections with respect to General Relativity could lead\nindeed to address the experimental results. However other interesting\ncosmological models can be considered during the pre-BBN epoch as soon as the\nBBN constraints are relaxed. In such a case, the PAMELA data can be fitted for\na larger class of $f(R)$-models.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 2 figures"]}]

A Gaussian distribution should only be used in this case when the\nstandard deviation is small compared to the range of variation (the length of\nthe interval).

Here we note that the knowledge of the range of\nvariation is equivalent to a bias of the distribution toward a flat\ndistribution in that range, and the principle of minimum Kullback entropy (mKE)\nshould be used in the derivation of the probability distribution rather than\nthe MaxEnt, thus leading to an exponential distribution with non Gaussian\nfeatures. Furthermore, up to evaluating the distribution negentropy, we\nquantify the deviation of mKE distributions from MaxEnt ones and, thus, we\nrigorously justify the use of GUM-S1 recommendation also if we have further\ninformation on the range of variation of a quantity, namely, provided that its\nstandard uncertainty is sufficiently small compared to the range.\n"]}]

We use Andreev reflection of thermal excitations to\nmonitor vortex motion with quartz tuning fork oscillators in two different\nexperimental setups at temperatures below 0.2Tc. Deviations from ideal\ncylindrical symmetry in the flow environment cause the early decay to become\nturbulent. This is identified from a rapid initial overshoot in the vortex\ndensity above the value before the spin-down and its subsequent decay with a\nt^(-3/2) time dependence. The high polarization of the vortices along the\nrotation axis significantly suppresses the effective turbulent kinematic\nviscosity below the values reported for more homogeneous turbulence and leads\nto a laminar late-time response. The vortex dissipation down to T < 0.15Tc is\ndetermined from the precession frequency of the polarized vortex configuration.\nIn the limit of vanishing normal component density, the laminar dissipation is\nfound to approach a temperature-independent value, whose origin is currently\nunder discussion.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures"]}]

Special emphasis is laid on time-delay experiments,\nwhere attosecond XUV pulses are used to photoionize target atoms at\nwell-defined times, followed by a probing process in real time by a\nphase-locked, infrared laser field. In this way, the laser field serves as a\n\"clock\" to monitor the ionization event, but the observable delays do not\ncorrespond directly to the delay associated with single-photon ionization.\nInstead, a significant part of the observed delay originates from a measurement\ninduced process, which obscures the single-photon ionization dynamics. This\nartifact is traced back to a phase-shift of the above-threshold ionization\ntransition matrix element, which we call the continuum-continuum phase. It\narises due to the laser-stimulated transitions between Coulomb continuum\nstates. As we shall show here, these measurement-induced effects can be\nseparated from the single-photon ionization process, using analytical\nexpressions of universal character, so that eventually the attosecond\ntime-delays in photoionization can be accessed.\n","Comment: Submitted to J.

Based on observations that the hot spot temperature is about a few\nmillion Kelvins the Partially Screened Gap (PSG) model was proposed which\nassumes that the temperature of the actual polar cap equals to the so called\ncritical temperature. We discuss correlation between the temperature and\ncorresponding area of the thermal X-ray emission for a number of pulsars.\n  We have found that depending on the conditions in a polar cap region the gap\nbreakdown can be caused either by the Curvature Radiation (CR) or by the\nInverse Compton Scattering (ICS). When the gap is dominated by ICS the density\nof secondary plasma with Lorentz factors $10^{2}-10^{3}$ is at least an order\nof magnitude higher then in a CR scenario. We believe that two different gap\nbreakdown scenarios can explain the mode-changing phenomenon and in particular\nthe pulse nulling. Measurements of the characteristic spacing between\nsub-pulses ($P_{2}$) and the period at which a pattern of pulses crosses the\npulse window ($P_{3}$) allowed us to determine more strict conditions for\navalanche pair production in the PSG.\n","Comment: 4 pages, Table 1 redesigned (v2), to be published in Proceedings of\n  Electromagnetic Radiation from Pulsars and Magnetars, Zielona G\\'ora, 2012,\n  Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series"]}]

In this paper, we propose the biobjective multiple and long path\nproblems to show experimentally that, on the first problems, even if the\nefficient set is connected, a local search may be outperformed by a simple\nevolutionary algorithm in the sampling of the efficient set. At the opposite,\non the second problems, a local search algorithm may successfully approximate a\ndisconnected efficient set. Then, we argue that connectedness is not the single\nproperty to study for the design of local search heuristics for MOCO. This work\nopens new discussions on a proper definition of the multiobjective fitness\nlandscape.\n","Comment: Learning and Intelligent OptimizatioN Conference (LION 5), Rome :\n  Italy (2011)"]}]

Here the situation is different: the outer Kuiper belt\ndoes have a definite future, although one of uncertain duration. Simulations\nprovide two distinct, compelling reasons. First, mean motion resonances in the\nouter belt [i.e., beyond the 1/2 resonance at 47.76 AU] are amazingly \"sticky\":\nin almost all cases bodies captured in them from regions closer to Neptune\nduring that planet's outward migration remain trapped for 4.6 byr. Most\ncaptured orbits are chaotic and so will eventually escape, but there is no\nreason to believe that all outer belt resonances will empty in the near future.\nSecond, in determining capture probabilities for various resonances, we find\nthat the first order 1/2 resonance is quite efficient, but, in clear contrast\nto higher order ones in the outer belt, nearly half of its victims have escaped\nduring 4.6 byr. These bodies typically remain in unstable orbits in the outer\nbelt, usually for several hundred million years before being expelled well\nbeyond 100 AU. Other inner belt resonances, although capturing less efficiently\nthan 1/2, behave in the same fashion. Thus the outer belt has a two component,\nlong-term population: one with members lying semi-permanently in one of about 6\nresonances and another that is far more temporary, but whose source provides a\ncontinuous and ready resupply. The resulting eccentricity distribution of this\ncombined population closely matches the observed one, as Hahn and Malhotra have\nmade clear but the inclination distribution is a better approximation to it\nthan is often claimed, a fact that probably should not be ignored when\nconsidering an origin for what has been labeled \"the scattered disk\".\n","Comment: 18 pages, including 7 figures, 5 pages of tables"]}]
