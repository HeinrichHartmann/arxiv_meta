Maclane in\nthe case of discrete rank 1 valuations. . Let K -> L be a field extension and\n{\\nu} a valuation of K. The original motivation for introducing key polynomials\nwas the problem of describing all the extensions {\\mu} of {\\nu} to L. Take a\nvaluation {\\mu} of L extending the valuation {\\nu}. In the case when {\\nu} is\ndiscrete of rank 1 and L is a simple algebraic extension of K Maclane\nintroduced the notions of key polynomials for {\\mu} and augmented valuations\nand proved that {\\mu} is obtained as a limit of a family of augmented\nvaluations on the polynomial ring K[x].\n  In a series of papers, M. Vaqui\\'e generalized MacLane's notion of key\npolynomials to the case of arbitrary valuations {\\nu} (that is, valuations\nwhich are not necessarily discrete of rank 1).\n  In the paper Valuations in algebraic field extensions, published in the\nJournal of Algebra in 2007, F.J. Herrera Govantes, M.A. Olalla Acosta and M.\nSpivakovsky develop their own notion of key polynomials for extensions (K,\n{\\nu}) -> (L, {\\mu}) of valued fields, where {\\nu} is of archimedian rank 1\n(not necessarily discrete) and give an explicit description of the limit key\npolynomials.\n  Our purpose in this paper is to clarify the relationship between the two\nnotions of key polynomials already developed by vaqui\\'e and by F.J.
