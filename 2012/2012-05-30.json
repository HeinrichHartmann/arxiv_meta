Nevertheless, complementary to the result of Ferraro et al, we\nconstruct a model of a Markovian bipartite system providing zero discord for\narbitrary long time interval, that we term 'Markovian classicality'. Our model\nrepresents a matter-of-principle formal proof, i.e. a sufficient condition for\nthe, otherwise not obvious, existence of Markovian classicality. Interestingly\nenough, we are not able to offer any alternative to the model. Physical\nrelevance of the model is twofold. First, the model is in intimate relation to\nthe topics of quantum information locality, quantum discord saturation and\nquantum decorrelation. Second, the model is of the general physical interest.\nIt pertains to a specific structure (decomposition into parts/subsystems) of a\ncomposite system, not to a special physical kind of composite systems. Being a\ncharacteristic of a structure, by definition, the model of Markovian\nclassicality is not a model of sudden death of discord.

Using agent-based computer simulations, in this paper we study dynamics\nof emotional communications in online social networks. The rules that guide how\nthe agents interact are motivated, and the realistic network structure and some\nimportant parameters are inferred from the empirical dataset of\n\\texttt{MySpace} social network. Agent's emotional state is characterized by\ntwo variables representing psychological arousal---reactivity to stimuli, and\nvalence---attractiveness or aversiveness, by which common emotions can be\ndefined. Agent's action is triggered by increased arousal. High-resolution\ndynamics is implemented where each message carrying agent's emotion along the\nnetwork link is identified and its effect on the recipient agent is considered\nas continuously aging in time. Our results demonstrate that (i) aggregated\ngroup behaviors may arise from individual emotional actions of agents; (ii)\ncollective states characterized by temporal correlations and dominant positive\nemotions emerge, similar to the empirical system; (iii) nature of the driving\nsignal---rate of user's stepping into online world, has profound effects on\nbuilding the coherent behaviors, which are observed for users in online social\nnetworks. Further, our simulations suggest that spreading patterns differ for\nthe emotions, e.g., \"enthusiastic\" and \"ashamed\", which have entirely different\nemotional content. {\\bf {All data used in this study are fully anonymized.}}\n","Comment: 21 pages, 13 figures"]}]

We show that faceting occurs in regions where the\nvesicle wall is softer, such as areas of reduced wall thicknesses or\nconcentrated in crystalline defects. The elastic heterogeneities are modeled as\na second component with reduced elastic parameters. Using simulated annealing\nMonte Carlo simulations we obtain the vesicle shape by optimizing the\ndistributions of facets and boundaries. Our model allows us to reduce the\neffects of the residual stress generated by crystalline defects, and reveals a\nrobust faceting mechanism into polyhedra other than the icosahedron.\n","Comment: 4.5 pages, 4 figures"]}]

The method uses a\nreformulation and linearization technique to transform the original polynomial\noptimization problem into a pair of mixed binary-linear programs. The solutions\nto these two integer-linear reformulations provide upper and lower bounds on\nthe global solution to the original polynomial program. The tightness of these\nbounds, the error in approximating each polynomial expression, and the number\nof constraints that must be added in the process of reformulation all depend on\nthe error tolerance specified by the user for each variable in the original\npolynomial program. As these error tolerances approach zero the size of the\nreformulated programs increases and the calculated interval bounds converge to\nthe true global solution.\n","Comment: 18 pages"]}]

It is found that\nthe symmetry and strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction are\ndetermined primarily by the partially filled 4f states of the R3+ ions, and\nthat the DM and biquadratic (BQ) exchanges between the R3+ and Mn2+ ions are\nunusually strong and control the observed spin reorientation phenomenon. Below\ntheir SR temperature, the Mn2+ and Ce3+ moments are orthogonal in CeMnAsO but\nare collinear in NdMnAsO, because the DM interaction dominates over the BQ\ninteraction for CeMnAsO while the opposite is the case for NdMnAsO.

The systems include the formal attachment of\nsecurity policies into their locations, whose intended interactions are trapped\nby the policies, aiming at taking access control decisions of the system, and\nthe Semantics also takes care of this.\n  Using the Semantics, a Labelled Transition System (LTS) can be induced for\nevery particular system, and over this LTS some model checking tasks could be\ndone. We identify how this LTS is indeed obtained, and propose an alternative\nway of model checking the not-yet-induced LTS, by using the system design\ndirectly. This may lead to over-approximation thereby producing imprecise,\nthough safe, results. We restrict ourselves to finite systems, in the sake of\nbeing certain about the decidability of the proposed method.\n  To illustrate the usefulness and validity of our proposal, we present 2 small\ncase-study-like examples, where we show how the system can be specified, which\npolicies could be added to it, and how to decide if the desired global security\nproperty is met.\n  Finally, an Appendix is given for digging deeply into how a tool for\nautomatically performing this task is being built, including some\nimplementation issues. The tool takes advantage of the proposed method, and\ngiven some system and some desired global security property, it safely (i.e.\nwithout false positives) ensures satisfaction of it.\n"]}]
