In this presentation, it is pointed out that the estimation of a\nsmall interaction parameter using weak measurements actually corresponds to\nstandard quantum metrology, where the logarithmic derivatives of the final\nmeasurement probabilities are proportional to the corresponding weak values.\nThe analysis of the general weak measurement formalism then shows that extreme\nweak values do not improve the sensitivity. Instead, all final measurements\nwith real weak values have the same sensitivity as a final measurement of the\neigenvalues. This result supports the view that real weak values can be\ninterpreted as precise, zero uncertainty estimates of a quantum observable,\ndespite their deviation from the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator.\n","Comment: 3 pages, no figures.

To this end, $n$ sensors are deployed at random\nlocations within the area. These sensors detect for the presence of a\ntransmitter within their radio range $r_s$, and their individual decisions are\ncombined to estimate the available whitespace. The limiting behavior of the\nrecovered whitespace as a function of $n$ and $r_s$ is analyzed. It is shown\nthat both the fraction of the available whitespace that the nodes fail to\nrecover as well as their radio range both optimally scale as $\\log(n)/n$ as $n$\ngets large. The analysis is extended to the case of unreliable sensors, and it\nis shown that, surprisingly, the optimal scaling is still $\\log(n)/n$ even in\nthis case. A related problem of estimating the number of transmitters and their\nlocations is also analyzed, with the sum absolute error in localization as\nperformance metric. The optimal scaling of the radio range and the necessary\nminimum transmitter separation is determined, that ensure that the sum absolute\nerror in transmitter localization is minimized, with high probability, as $n$\ngets large. Finally, the optimal distribution of sensor deployment is\ndetermined, given the distribution of the transmitters, and the resulting\nperformance benefit is characterized.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 5 figures.

However, a Small-World sampler suffers from the\ncurse of dimensionality because its spectral gap depends on the volume of each\nmode. We present a new sampler that combines tempering, Small-World sampling,\nand producing long-range proposals from samples in companion chains (e.g.\nEqui-Energy sampler). In its simplest form the sampler employs two Small-World\nchains: an exploring chain and a sampling chain. The exploring chain samples\n$\\pi_t(x) \\propto \\pi(x)^{1/t}$, $t\\in [1,\\infty)$, and builds up an empirical\ndistribution. Using this empirical distribution as its long-range proposal, the\nsampling chain is designed to have a stationary distribution $\\pi(x)$. We prove\nergodicity of the algorithm and study its convergence rate. We show that the\nspectral gap of the exploring chain is enlarged by a factor of $t^{d}$ and that\nof the sampling chain is shrunk by a factor of $t^{-d}$. Importantly, the\nspectral gap of the exploring chain depends on the \"size\" of $\\pi_t(x)$ while\nthat of sampling chain does not. Overall, the sampler enlarges a severe\nbottleneck at the cost of shrinking a mild one, hence achieves faster mixing.\nThe penalty on the spectral gap of the sampling chain can be significantly\nalleviated when extending the algorithm to multiple chains whose temperatures\n$\\{t_k\\}$ follow a geometric progression.
