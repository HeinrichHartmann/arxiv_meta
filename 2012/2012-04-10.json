With the truncated distribution function\nto the lowest order, we derived a set of second-order equations for the\nequilibrium states of the system. In this work, the numerical solutions of\nthese equations are investigated. It is found that there are three types of\nsolutions for these equations. Both the isothermal and divergent solutions are\nthermally unstable and have unconfined density profiles with infinite mass,\nenergy and spatial extent. The convergent solutions, however, seem to be\nreasonable. Although the results cannot match the simulation data well, because\nof the truncations of the distribution function and its moment equations, these\nlowest-order convergent solutions show that the density profiles of the system\nare confined, the velocity dispersions are variable functions of the radius,\nand the velocity distributions are also anisotropic in different directions.\nThe convergent solutions also indicate that the statistical equilibrium of\nself-gravitating systems is by no means the thermodynamic equilibrium. These\nsolutions are just the lowest-order approximation, but they have already\nmanifested the qualitative success of our theory. We expect that higher-order\nsolutions of our statistical-mechanical theory will give much better agreement\nwith the simulation results concerning dark matter haloes.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures, MNRAS, in the press"]}]

These results are of essential\nimportance for the construction of the related effective field theory of\nphenomenologically appealing D-brane models.

Motivated\nby the similar discrete structure of linear codes and point lattices in R^N,\nand their many shared applications across complexity theory, cryptography, and\ncoding theory, we initiate the study of list decoding for lattices. Namely: for\na lattice L in R^N, given a target vector r in R^N and a distance parameter d,\noutput the set of all lattice points w in L that are within distance d of r.\n  In this work we focus on combinatorial and algorithmic questions related to\nlist decoding for the well-studied family of Barnes-Wall lattices. Our main\ncontributions are twofold:\n  1) We give tight (up to polynomials) combinatorial bounds on the worst-case\nlist size, showing it to be polynomial in the lattice dimension for any error\nradius bounded away from the lattice's minimum distance (in the Euclidean\nnorm).\n  2) Building on the unique decoding algorithm of Micciancio and Nicolosi (ISIT\n'08), we give a list-decoding algorithm that runs in time polynomial in the\nlattice dimension and worst-case list size, for any error radius. Moreover, our\nalgorithm is highly parallelizable, and with sufficiently many processors can\nrun in parallel time only poly-logarithmic in the lattice dimension.\n  In particular, our results imply a polynomial-time list-decoding algorithm\nfor any error radius bounded away from the minimum distance, thus beating a\ntypical barrier for error-correcting codes posed by the Johnson radius.\n"]}]

VSN creates a huge opportunity to extend\nthe road-side sensor infrastructure of existing traffic control systems. The\nefficient use of the wireless communication medium is one of the basic issues\nin VSN applications development. This paper introduces a novel method of\nselective data collection for traffic control applications, which provides a\nsignificant reduction in data amounts transmitted through VSN. The underlying\nidea is to detect the necessity of data transfers on the basis of uncertainty\ndetermination of the traffic control decisions. According to the proposed\napproach, sensor data are transmitted from vehicles to the control node only at\nselected time moments. Data collected in VSN are processed using on-line\ntraffic simulation technique, which enables traffic flow prediction,\nperformance evaluation of control strategies and uncertainty estimation. If\nprecision of the resulting information is insufficient, the optimal control\nstrategy cannot be derived without ambiguity. As a result the control decision\nbecomes uncertain and it is a signal informing that new traffic data from VSN\nare necessary to provide more precise prediction and to reduce the uncertainty\nof decision. The proposed method can be applied in traffic control systems of\ndifferent types e.g. traffic signals, variable speed limits, and dynamic route\nguidance.

We first recall that this is indeed the case in\nboth relativity and quantum mechanics, although in very different manners: time\nflows geometrically in relativity (i.e. as a flow of proper time in the four\ndimensional space-time), time flows abstractly in quantum mechanics (i.e. as a\nflow in the space of observables of the system). We then ask the same question\nin quantum gravity, in the light of the thermal time hypothesis of Connes and\nRovelli. The latter proposes to answer the question of time in quantum gravity\n(or at least one of its many aspects), by postulating that time is a state\ndependent notion. This means that one is able to make a notion of\ntime-as-an-abstract-flow - that we call the thermal time - emerge from the\nknowledge of both: 1) the algebra of observables of the physical system under\ninvestigation, 2) a state of thermal equilibrium of this system. Formally, this\nthermal time is similar to the abstract flow of time in quantum mechanics, but\nwe show in various examples that it may have a concrete implementation either\nas a geometrical flow, or as a geometrical flow combined with a non-geometric\naction. This indicates that in quantum gravity, time may well still be\n\"something that flows\" at some abstract algebraic level, but this does not\nnecessarily imply that time is always and only \"something that flows\" at the\ngeometric level.\n","Comment: Contribution to the Workshop \"Temps et Emergence\", Ecole Normale\n  Sup\\'erieure, Paris 14-15 october 2011.

Although the\nimpact of using ICT devices cannot be measured unequivocally at the\nmicroeconomic level because of certain statistical and methodological\nimperfections, by applying such analytical methods as cluster analysis and\ncorrelation and regression calculation, the author managed to prove that both\nthe correlation coefficient and the gradient of the regression trend line\nshowed a positive relationship between the extensive use of information and\ncommunication technology and the profitability of enterprises.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures"]}]

For every arm, the associated index is\nequal to the product of a multiplicative factor by the sample mean of the\nrewards collected by this arm.

We propose a\ntransformation of data which under the true conditional distribution leads to\ncontinuous uniform iid series. The uniformity and serial independence of the\nnew series is then examined simultaneously. The transformation can be\nconsidered as an extension of the integral transform tool for noncontinuous\ndata. We derive asymptotic properties of such tests taking into account the\nparameter estimation effect. Since transformed series are iid we do not require\nany mixing conditions and asymptotic results illustrate the double simultaneous\nchecking nature of our test. The test statistics converges under the null with\na parametric rate to the asymptotic distribution, which is case dependent,\nhence we justify a parametric bootstrap approximation. The test has power\nagainst local alternatives and is consistent. The performance of the new tests\nis compared with classical specification checks for discrete choice models.\n"]}]
