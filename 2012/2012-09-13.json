This results in a ring- or disc-shaped population of young stars.

These events were\ndiscovered as a byproduct of an analysis designed to find short timescale\nsingle lens events that may be due to free-floating planets. Three of these\nevents are determined to be microlensing events, while the fourth is most\nlikely caused by stellar variability. For each of the three microlensing\nevents, the signal is almost entirely due to a brief caustic feature with\nlittle or no lensing attributable mainly to the lens primary. One of these\nevents, MOA-bin-1, is due to a planet, and it is the first example of a\nplanetary event in which stellar host is only detected through binary\nmicrolensing effects. The mass ratio and separation are q = 4.9 +- 1.4 x\n10^{-3} and s = 2.10 +- 0.05, respectively. A Bayesian analysis based on a\nstandard Galactic model indicates that the planet, MOA-bin-1Lb, has a mass of\nm_p = 3.7 +- 2.1 M_{Jup}, and orbits a star of M_* = 0.75{+0.33 -0.41} M_solar\nat a semi-major axis of a = 8.3 {+4.5 -2.7} AU.

The sharp horizon emerges only in the\nclassical limit when the ratio of the Compton wavelength of the black hole to\nits Schwarzschild radius vanishes.

Recent advances in\nbiology have encouraged using genetically engineered bacteria as the main\ncomponent in the molecular communication. This has stimulated a new line of\nresearch that attempts to study molecular communication among bacteria from an\ninformation-theoretic point of view. Due to high randomness in the individual\nbehavior of the bacterium, reliable communication between two bacteria is\nalmost impossible. Therefore, we recently proposed that a population of\nbacteria in a cluster is considered as a node capable of molecular transmission\nand reception. This proposition enables us to form a reliable node out of many\nunreliable bacteria. The bacteria inside a node sense the environment and\nrespond accordingly. In this paper, we study the communication between two\nnodes, one acting as the transmitter and the other as the receiver. We consider\nthe case in which the information is encoded in the concentration of molecules\nby the transmitter. The molecules produced by the bacteria in the transmitter\nnode propagate in the environment via the diffusion process. Then, their\nconcentration sensed by the bacteria in the receiver node would decode the\ninformation. The randomness in the communication is caused by both the error in\nthe molecular production at the transmitter and the reception of molecules at\nthe receiver. We study the theoretical limits of the information transfer rate\nin such a setup versus the number of bacteria per node. Finally, we consider\nM-ary modulation schemes and study the achievable rates and their error\nprobabilities.\n"]}]

However, particle physics experiments are\nexpensive and time consuming to carry out, thus if an analysis has inherent\nbias (even if unintentional), much money and effort can be wasted trying to\nreplicate or understand the results, particularly if the analysis is\nfundamental to our understanding of the universe.\n  In this note we discuss the significant biases that can result from data\nbinning schemes. As we will show, if data are binned such that they provide the\nbest comparison to a particular (but incorrect) model, the resulting model\nparameter estimates when fitting to the binned data can be significantly\nbiased, leading us to too often accept the model hypothesis when it is not in\nfact true. When using binned likelihood or least squares methods there is of\ncourse no a priori requirement that data bin sizes need to be constant, but we\nshow that fitting to data grouped into variable width bins is particularly\nprone to produce biased results if the bin boundaries are chosen to optimize\nthe comparison of the binned data to a wrong model. The degree of bias that can\nbe achieved simply with variable binning can be surprisingly large.\n  Fitting the data with an unbinned likelihood method, when possible to do so,\nis the best way for researchers to show their analyses are not biased by\nbinning effects. Failing that, equal bin widths should be employed as a\ncross-check of the fitting analysis whenever possible.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 3 figures"]}]
