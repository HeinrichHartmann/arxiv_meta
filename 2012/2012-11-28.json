First the\nsemiclassical method is employed to reserve the expression for RKKY interaction\nin clean graphene. Due to the pseudogap at Dirac point, the RKKY coupling in\nundoped grapheme is found to be proportional to $1/R^3$. Next, we investigate\nhow the RKKY interaction depends on nonmagnetic disorder strength and gate\nvoltage by studying numerically the Anderson tight-binding model on a honeycomb\nlattice. We observe that the RKKY interaction along the armchair direction is\nmore robust to nonmagnetic disorder than in other directions. This effect can\nbe explained semiclassically: The presence of multiple shortest paths between\ntwo lattice sites in the armchair directions is found to be responsible for the\nreduceddisorder sensitivity. We also present the distribution of the RKKY\ninteraction for the zigzag and armchair directions.

We present experimental and image\nreconstruction methods with which 2-D SOS distributions can be accurately\nacquired and reconstructed, and with which the SOS map can be used subsequently\nto reconstruct highly accurate PA tomograms.

Subsequently, we use the SOS distribution\nin a new 2-D iterative approach, where refraction of rays originating from PA\nsources are accounted for in accurately retrieving the distribution of these\nsources. Both the SOS reconstruction and SOS-compensated PA reconstruction\nmethods utilize the Eikonal equation to model acoustic wavefront propagation,\nwhich is solved using a high accuracy fast marching method (HAFMM).

Their potential fully unfolds at\nultracold temperatures, where a plethora of effects is predicted in many-body\nphysics, quantum information science, ultracold chemistry, and physics beyond\nthe standard model. These objectives have inspired the development of a wide\nrange of methods to produce cold molecular ensembles. However, cooling\npolyatomic molecules to ultracold temperatures has until now seemed\nintractable. Here we report on the experimental realization of opto-electrical\ncooling, a paradigm-changing cooling and accumulation method for polar\nmolecules. Its key attribute is the removal of a large fraction of a molecule's\nkinetic energy in each step of the cooling cycle via a Sisyphus effect,\nallowing cooling with only few dissipative decay processes. We demonstrate its\npotential by reducing the temperature of about 10^6 trapped CH_3F molecules by\na factor of 13.5, with the phase-space density increased by a factor of 29 or a\nfactor of 70 discounting trap losses. In contrast to other cooling mechanisms,\nour scheme proceeds in a trap, cools in all three dimensions, and works for a\nlarge variety of polar molecules. With no fundamental temperature limit\nanticipated down to the photon-recoil temperature in the nanokelvin range, our\nmethod eliminates the primary hurdle in producing ultracold polyatomic\nmolecules. The low temperatures, large molecule numbers and long trapping times\nup to 27 s will allow an interaction-dominated regime to be attained, enabling\ncollision studies and investigation of evaporative cooling toward a BEC of\npolyatomic molecules.\n"]}]

Another class of symbiotic systems are those in which the WD is\nextremely luminous and it seems likely that quiescent nuclear burning is\nongoing on the accreting WD. A fundamental question is the secular evolution of\nthe WD. Do the repeated outbursts or quiescent burning in these accreting\nsystems cause the WD to gain or lose mass?
