We present multi-color light curves from the SDSS-II\nSN Survey, that cover the rise time, as well as an optical spectrum that shows\nthat the explosion occurred at z~0.376. We fitted black body functions to\nestimate the temperature and radius evolution of the photosphere and used the\nparametrized code SYNOW to model the spectrum. We constructed a bolometric\nlight curve and compared it with explosion models. The very early light curves\nshow a dip in the g- and r-bands and a possible initial cooling phase in the\nu-band before rising to maximum light. The bolometric light curve shows a\nprecursor plateau with a duration of 6-10 days in the rest-frame. A lower limit\nof M_u < -21.5 can be placed on the absolute peak luminosity of the SN, while\nthe rise time is constrained to be at least 29 days.

We have adopted a\nstandard one-dimensional delayed detonation model of the explosion of a\nChandrasekhar-mass white dwarf, and have post-processed the thermodynamic\ntrajectories of every mass-shell with a nucleosynthetic code, with increases\n(decreases) by a factor of ten on the rates of 1196 nuclear reactions. We have\ncomputed as well hydrodynamic models for different rates of the fusion\nreactions of 12C and of 16O. For selected reactions, we have recomputed the\nnucleosynthesis with alternative prescriptions for their rates taken from the\nJINA REACLIB database, and have analyzed the temperature ranges where\nmodifications of their rates have the strongest effect on nucleosynthesis.\n  The nucleosynthesis resulting from the Type Ia supernova models is quite\nrobust with respect to variations of nuclear reaction rates, with the exception\nof the reaction of fusion of 12C nuclei. The energy of the explosion changes by\nless than \\sim4%. The changes in the nucleosynthesis due to the modification of\nthe rates of fusion reactions are as well quite modest, for instance no species\nwith a mass fraction larger than 0.02 experiences a variation of its yield\nlarger than a factor of two. We provide the sensitivity of the yields of the\nmost abundant species with respect to the rates of the most intense reactions\nwith protons, neutrons, and alphas. In general, the yields of Fe-group nuclei\nare more robust than the yields of intermediate-mass elements.
