Due to\nstrongly enhanced genetic drift at the advancing frontier, neutral and weakly\ndeleterious mutations can reach large frequencies in the newly colonized\nregions, as if they were surfing the front of the range expansion. These\nfindings raise the question of how frequently beneficial mutations successfully\nsurf at shifting range margins, thereby promoting adaptation towards a\nrange-expansion phenotype. Here, we use individual-based simulations to study\nthe surfing statistics of recurrent beneficial mutations on wave-like range\nexpansions in linear habitats. We show that the rate of surfing depends on two\nstrongly antagonistic factors, the probability of surfing given the spatial\nlocation of a novel mutation and the rate of occurrence of mutations at that\nlocation. The surfing probability strongly increases towards the tip of the\nwave. Novel mutations are unlikely to surf unless they enjoy a spatial head\nstart compared to the bulk of the population. The needed head start is shown to\nbe proportional to the inverse fitness of the mutant type, and only weakly\ndependent on the carrying capacity. The second factor is the mutation\noccurrence which strongly decreases towards the tip of the wave. Thus, most\nsuccessful mutations arise at an intermediate position in the front of the\nwave. We present an analytic theory for the tradeoff between these factors that\nallows to predict how frequently substitutions by beneficial mutations occur at\ninvasion fronts. We find that small amounts of genetic drift increase the\nfixation rate of beneficial mutations at the advancing front, and thus could be\nimportant for adaptation during species invasions.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 7 figures; to appear in PLoS Computational Biology"]}]

In what we call the small\ngrowth rate case the situation resembles the classical CLT. The weak limit is\nGaussian and the normalization is the square root of the size of the system. In\nthe critical case the limit is still Gaussian, however the normalization\nrequires an additional term. Finally, when the growth rate is large the\nsituation is completely different. The limit is no longer Gaussian, the\nnormalization is substantially larger than the classical one and the\nconvergence holds in probability. These different regimes arise as a result of\n\"competition\" between spatial smoothing due to the particles' movement and the\nsystem's growth which is local.\n"]}]

It is argued that organic carbon burial is\nof minor importance to the accumulation of oxygen in a mainly anoxic world\nwhere aerobic respiration is not globally significant. Thus, for the Great\nOxidation Event (GOE) ~ 2.4 Gyr ago, an increasing flux of O2 due to its\nproduction by an expanding population of cyanobacteria is parameterized as the\nprimary source of O2. Various factors would have constrained cyanobacterial\nproliferation and O2 production during most of the Archean and therefore a long\ndelay between the appearance of cyanobacteria and oxygenation of the atmosphere\nis to be expected. Destruction of O2 via CH4 oxidation in the atmosphere was a\nmajor O2 sink during the Archean, and the GOE is explained to a significant\nextent by a large decline in the methanogen population and corresponding CH4\nflux which, in turn, was caused primarily by partial oxygenation of the surface\nocean. The partially oxygenated state of these waters also made it possible for\nan aerobic methanotroph population to become established. This further\ncontributed to the large reduction in the CH4 flux to the atmosphere by\nincreasing the consumption of CH4 diffusing upwards from the deeper anoxic\ndepths of the water column as well as any CH4 still being produced in the upper\nlayer. The reduction in the CH4 flux lowered the CH4 oxidation sink for O2 at\nabout the same time the metamorphic and volcanic gas sinks for O2 also\ndeclined.

The potentially imminent availability of\nrecent datasets helps one to discover the protein disorders, however in\nmajority of cases, the stability of proteins depend on the carbon content.\nAddressing this distinct feature, it is possible to hit upon the carbon\ndistribution along the sequence and can easily recognize the stable nature of\nprotein. There are certain reported mental disorders which fall in to this\ncategory. Regardless, such kind of disorder prone protein FMR1p (Fragile X\nmental retardation 1 protein) is identified as the main cause for the disease\nFragile X syndrome. This paper deals with the identification of defects in the\nFMR1 protein sequence considering the carbon contents along the sequence. This\nattempt is to evaluate the stability of proteins, accordingly the protein\ndisorders in order to improvise the certain Biological functions of proteins to\nprevent disease. The transition of the disorder to order protein involves\ncareful considerations and can be achieved by detecting the unstable region\nthat lacks hydrophobicity. This work focuses the low carbon content in the FMR1\nprotein so as to attain the stable status in future to reduce the morbidity\nrate caused by Fragile X syndrome for the society.\n","Comment: 6 Pages, 1 Figure, 2nd Annual International Conference on\n  BioInformatics and Computational Biology (BICB 2012), Bangkok, Thailand"]}]

Thermal\nconduction is the dominant mechanism of cooling the hot background plasma in\nthe presence of an unspecified thermodynamic source that maintains the initial\nequilibrium.
