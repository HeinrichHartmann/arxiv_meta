We made two distinct contributions: ordinal rating of network\nperformance and inference by matrix completion. The former reduces measurement\ncosts and unifies various metrics which eases their processing in applications.\nThe latter enables scalable and accurate inference with no requirement of\nstructural information of the network nor geometric constraints. By combining\nboth, the acquisition problem bears strong similarities to recommender systems.\nThis paper investigates the applicability of various matrix factorization\nmodels used in recommender systems.

This was made to align a sphere equipped with tubes to observe\nthe celestial pole, the polar circles, the solstices and equinoxes. The use of\ntubes in astronomical observation is later reported by Alhazen in his treatise\non optics (1011-1021). The description of pointing to the celestial pole\nindicates that the instrument must be accurately aligned with the true pole,\nmaterialized at that epoch by a star of fifth magnitude, at the limit of naked\neye visibility, and then the instrument must remain fixed. Solstices and\nEquinoxes are points of the orbit of the Sun, so the sphere could be used as a\ntool for observing the Sun and probably determine the duration of the tropical\nyear. This sphere was much more than a didactic tool, given the long procedure\nfor the accurate alignement. Moreover \"Rogatus a pluribus\" (asked by his many\nstudents), Gerbert wrote a treatise on acoustic tubes (fistulae) in 980:\nMensura Fistularum. He knew the difference in behavior of the fistulae compared\nwith the acoustic strings, already studied by the Pythagoreans, and the treaty\nis intended to present the law that governs the length of the organ pipes in\ntwo octaves, compared to the corresponding acoustic strings. In terms of modern\nphysics we know that acoustic tubes require an \"end correction\" to be tuned,\nwhich is proportional to the diameter of the tube. This proportionality is the\nsame for every note. The mathematical law is simple, but Gerbert preferred to\ncreate a law in which the proportions of pipes and strings should be calculated\nthrough a series of fractions linked to the number 12 and its multiples.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures, Atti dell'XI Convegno SIA (Societ\\`a Italiana di\n  Archeoastronomia) di Bologna-Marzabotto 2011.

Vaccination dramatically\ndisrupts the disease transmission process on a contact network, and indeed,\nsufficiently high vaccination rates can disrupt the process to such an extent\nthat disease transmission on the network is effectively halted. Here, we build\non mounting evidence that health behaviors - such as vaccination, and refusal\nthereof - can spread through social networks through a process of complex\ncontagion that requires social reinforcement. Using network simulations that\nmodel both the health behavior and the infectious disease spread, we find that\nunder otherwise identical conditions, the process by which the health behavior\nspreads has a very strong effect on disease outbreak dynamics. This variability\nin dynamics results from differences in the topology within susceptible\ncommunities that arise during the health behavior spreading process, which in\nturn depends on the topology of the overall social network. Our findings point\nto the importance of health behavior spread in predicting and controlling\ndisease outbreaks.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 2 paneled figures, 2 supplemental figures"]}]

We report on the electronic structure\nof nano-crystalline Fe:ZnO, which has recently been shown to be an efficient\nphotocatalyst. The photo-activity of ZnO reduces Fe from 3+ to 2+ in the\nsurface region of the nano-crystalline material. Electronic states\ncorresponding to low-spin Fe 2+ are observed and attributed to crystal field\nmodification at the surface. These states can be important for the\nphotocatalytic sensitivity to visible light due to their deep location in the\nZnO bandgap. X-ray absorption and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy suggest that\nFe is only homogeneously distributed for concentrations up to 3%. Increased\nconcentrations does not result in a higher concentration of Fe ions in the\nsurface region. This is a crucial factor limiting the photocatalytic\nfunctionality of ZnO, where the most efficient doping concentration have been\nshown to be 2-4% for Fe doping.

This was first established in the 1980s by Bollob\\'as by\ndirectly calculating the probability that a set of vertices has small expansion\nand then applying the union bound.\n  In this paper we improve on this analysis by relying on a simple high-level\nobservation: if a graph contains a set of vertices with small expansion then it\nmust also contain such a set of vertices that is locally optimal, that is, a\nset whose expansion cannot be made smaller by exchanging a vertex from the set\nwith one from the set's complement. We show that the probability that a set of\nvertices satisfies this additional property is significantly smaller. Thus,\nafter again applying the union bound, we obtain improved lower bounds on the\nexpansion of random $\\Delta$-regular graphs for $\\Delta\\ge 4$. In fact, the\ngains from this analysis increase as $\\Delta$ grows, a fact we explain by\nextending our technique to general $\\Delta$. Thus, in the end we obtain an\nimprovement not only for some small special cases but on the general asymptotic\nbound on the expansion of $\\Delta$-regular graphs given by Bollob\\'as.\n"]}]

Morphologies for the AGN host galaxies were derived from the\nGalaxy Zoo project.\n  Our results suggest that broad-line AGN and narrow-line AGN reside in widely\ndifferent environments where the neighbours to Type-2 AGN are more star-forming\nand bluer than those of Type-1 AGN. There is a colour-dependency only\ndetectable in the neighbours with photometric redshifts for the Type-2 AGN. We\nsee that the ratio between Type-1/Type-2 neighbours to Type-2 AGN decreases\nsteadily at short separations with a statistical significance of 4.5 sigma. The\nlack of change in the morphology of the Type-2 AGN hosts having a close\ncompanion (contrary to the case of Type-1 AGN hosts) suggests that the innate\nstate of Type-2 AGN is extremely short-lived and is not preserved in subsequent\nmergers. Finally, we perform a hypothetical luminosity test to investigate\nwhether a mass bias in our selection could explain the observed differences in\nour samples. Our conclusion is that AGN unification is consistently not\nsupported by the environment of the two types of AGN, but that an evolutionary\nconnection between them might exist.\n","Comment: 6 figures, 11 pages"]}]
