Econophysical analyses of transaction data for the US and Australian\nstock markets have uncovered market-specific scaling laws, where a master curve\nof price impact can be obtained in each market when stock capitalization $C$ is\nincluded as an argument in the scaling relation. However, the rationale of\nintroducing stock capitalization in the scaling is unclear and the anomalous\nnegative correlation between price change $r$ and trade size $\\omega$ for small\ntrades is unexplained. Here we show that these issues can be addressed by\ntaking into account the aggressiveness of orders that result in trades together\nwith a proper normalization technique. Using order book data from the Chinese\nmarket, we show that trades from filled and partially filled limit orders have\nvery different price impact. The price impact of trades from partially filled\norders is constant when the volume is not too large, while that of filled\norders shows power-law behavior $r\\sim \\omega^\\alpha$ with $\\alpha\\approx2/3$.\nWhen returns and volumes are normalized by stock-dependent averages,\ncapitalization-independent scaling laws emerge for both types of trades.\nHowever, no scaling relation in terms of stock capitalization can be\nconstructed. In addition, the relation $\\alpha=\\alpha_\\omega/\\alpha_r$ is\nverified, where $\\alpha_\\omega$ and $\\alpha_r$ are the tail exponents of trade\nsizes and returns. These observations also enable us to explain the anomalous\nnegative correlation between $r$ and $\\omega$ for small-size trades.

Although very easy to\nimplement, the parametric bootstrap can become very computationally expensive\nas the sample size, the number of parameters, or the dimension of the data\nincrease.

In a suitable system of coordinates, this\nsystem has two degrees of freedom and the conserved energy is usually called\nthe Jacobi constant. In 1980, J. Llibre and C. Sim\\'o proved the existence of\noscillatory motions for the restricted planar circular three body problem, that\nis, of orbits which leave every bounded region but which return infinitely\noften to some fixed bounded region. To prove their existence they had to assume\nthe ratio between the masses of the two primaries to be exponentially small\nwith respect to the Jacobi constant. In the present work, we generalize their\nwork proving the existence of oscillatory motions for any value of the mass\nratio.\n  To obtain such motions, we show that, for any value of the mass ratio and for\nbig values of the Jacobi constant, there exist transversal intersections\nbetween the stable and unstable manifolds of infinity which guarantee the\nexistence of a symbolic dynamics that creates the oscillatory orbits. The main\nachievement is to rigorously prove the existence of these orbits without\nassuming the mass ratio small since then this transversality can not be checked\nby means of classical perturbation theory respect to the mass ratio.

Because a larger cluster is less mobile in Brownian motion,\nit comes into contact with other clusters less frequently. Thus, the formation\nof a giant cluster is suppressed in the DLCA process. All clusters grow\ncontinuously with respect to time, but the largest cluster grows drastically\nwith respect to the number of cluster merging events. Here, we study the\ndiscontinuous PT occurring in the DLCA model in more general dimensions such as\ntwo, three, and four dimensions. PTs are also studied for a generalized\nvelocity, which scales with cluster size $s$ as $v_{s} \\propto s^{\\eta}$. For\nBrownian motion of hard spheres in three dimensions, the mean relative speed\nscales as $s^{-1/2}$ and the collision rate $\\sigma v_s$ scales as $\\sim\ns^{1/6}$.

However, both turbulence and discontinuities are present in the\nsolar wind on these inertial range of scales. We identify and remove these\ndiscontinuities using a method which for the first time does not impose a\ncharacteristic scale on the resultant time-series. The PSD of vector field\nfluctuations obtained from at-a point observations is a tensor that can in\nprinciple be anisotropic with scaling exponents that depend on background field\nand flow direction. This provides a key test of theories of turbulence. We find\nthat the removal of discontinuities from the observed time-series can\nsignificantly alter the PSD trace anisotropy. It becomes quasi-isotropic, in\nthat the observed exponent does not vary with the background field angle once\nthe discontinuities are removed. This is consistent with the predictions of the\nIroshnikov-Kraichnan model of turbulence. As a consistency check we construct a\nsurrogate time-series from the observations that is composed solely of\ndiscontinuities. The surrogate provides an estimate of the PSD due solely to\ndiscontinuities and this provides the effective noise-floor produced by\ndiscontinuities for all scales greater than a few ion-cyclotron scales.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures"]}]

Here,\nwe focus on the predictability of invasion of a broad class of epidemics caused\nby diseases that lead to permanent immunity of infected hosts after recovery or\ndeath. We approach the problem from the perspective of the science of\ncomplexity by proposing and testing several strategies for the estimation of\nimportant characteristics of epidemics, such as the probability of invasion.\nOur results suggest that parsimonious approximate methodologies may lead to the\nmost reliable and robust predictions. The proposed methodologies are first\napplied to analysis of experimentally observed epidemics: invasion of the\nfungal plant pathogen \\emph{Rhizoctonia solani} in replicated host microcosms.\nWe then consider numerical experiments of the SIR\n(susceptible-infected-removed) model to investigate the performance of the\nproposed methods in further detail. The suggested framework can be used as a\nvaluable tool for quick assessment of epidemic threat at the stage when\nepidemics only start developing.
