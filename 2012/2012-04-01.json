By utilizing our Monte Carlo procedure, the validity of which\nis guaranteed in two different procedures, we investigate not only the\nfluctuation of high energy muons themselves but also the fluctuation of the\nvarious quantities related to the energy losses by the muons, which are\ndifficult to obtain by the v_{cut} procedure. Namely, we obtain the fluctuation\non energy losses of muons in the present paper(Part1). In a subsequent paper\n(Part2), based on the idea developed in Part1, we will examine the correlation\nbetween the primary energies of muons and their energy deposits and the\ncorrelation between the energy deposits of the muons concerned and their\nCherenkov light yields in the KM3 detector in detail.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 30 figures, 3 tables. arXiv admin note: substantial text\n  overlap with arXiv:1010.5054"]}]
