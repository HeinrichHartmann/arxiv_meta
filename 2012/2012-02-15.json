Simulated CMB maps with\nassigned type and amplitude of primordial non-Gaussianity are important tools\nto determine the strength, sensitivity and limitations of non-Gaussian\nestimators. Here we investigate whether and to what extent our non-Gaussian\nindicators have sensitivity to detect non-Gaussianity of local type,\nparticularly with amplitude within the seven-year WMAP bounds. We make a\nsystematic study by employing our statistical tools to generate maps of\nskewness and kurtosis from several thousands of simulated maps equipped with\nnon-Gaussianity of local type of various amplitudes. We show that our\nindicators can be used to detect large-angle local-type non-Gaussianity only\nfor relatively large values of the non-linear parameter $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm\nlocal}$. Thus, our indicators have not enough sensitivity to detect deviation\nfrom Gaussianity with the non-linear parameter within the seven-year WMAP\nbounds. This result along with the outcomes of frequency bands and\nforeground-reduced analyses suggest that non-Gaussianity captured in the\nprevious works by our indicators is not of primordial origin, although it might\nhave a primordial component.

An outcome of this analysis is that the level of\nnon-Gaussianity of ILC-7yr map is higher than that of the simulated maps for\n$f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm local}$ within WMAP bounds.

We now provide a model in which a copy of the electroweak\ngauge group is added to the Standard Model. We spontaneously break this new\ngauge group to the diagonal Z_2 center which is used to stabilize a dark matter\ncandidate. In addition to the dark matter candidate, anomaly free messenger\nfermions are included which transform non-trivially under all the gauge groups.\nIn analogy to electroweak baryogenesis, the model generates an excess of\nmessenger \"baryons\". These \"baryons\" subsequently decay to the Standard Model\nand dark matter to generate an excess of Standard Model baryons. The\nbaryon-to-dark matter number density ratio is ultimately due to the requirement\nof gauge anomaly freedom. Dark sphalerons generate operators which violate B -\nL but preserves B + L. Thus, the asymmetry is not washed out by the Standard\nModel. The model radiatively generates a dark matter mass of order of the\nelectroweak vacuum expectation value suppressed by a loop factor therefore\nsetting the dark matter-to-baryon relic abundance. We outline some distinctive\nexperimental signatures and ensure these models are consistent with existing\nconstraints. As first discussed in [arXiv:0907.3142], these dark matter\nscenarios feature long-lived particles which can be observed at colliders. We\nfinally show how approximate global symmetries in the higgs sector stabilize\nboth the dark and electroweak scales thereby mitigating the hierarchy problem.\nLight dark higgses are needed to ensure the correct relic abundance.

This concerns the convergence of the logarithm of number\nof homomorphisms from graphs or hyper-graphs $\\G_N, N\\ge 1$ to some target\ngraph $W$. The theory of dense graph convergence, including random dense\ngraphs, is now well understood, but its counterpart for sparse random graphs\npresents some fundamental difficulties. Phrased in the statistical physics\nterminology, the issue is the existence of the log-partition function limits,\nalso known as free energy limits, appropriately normalized for the Gibbs\ndistribution associated with $W$. In this paper we prove that the sequence of\nsparse \\ER graphs is right-converging when the tensor product associated with\nthe target graph $W$ satisfies certain convexity property. We treat the case of\ndiscrete and continuous target graphs $W$. The latter case allows us to prove a\nspecial case of Talagrand's recent conjecture (more accurately stated as level\nIII Research Problem 6.7.2 in his recent book), concerning the existence of the\nlimit of the measure of a set obtained from $\\R^N$ by intersecting it with\nlinearly in $N$ many subsets, generated according to some common probability\nlaw.\n  Our proof is based on the interpolation technique, introduced first by Guerra\nand Toninelli and developed further in a series of papers. Specifically, Bayati\net al establish the right-convergence property for Erdos-Renyi graphs for some\nspecial cases of $W$. In this paper most of the results in this paper follow as\na special case of our main theorem.\n","Comment: 22 pages"]}]

Our results are obtained\nfrom numerical simulations of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations. We\ncalculate the dependence of the first field for flux penetration ($H_p$) with\nthe Ginzburg-Landau parameter ($\\kappa $) observing an increase of $H_p$ with\ndecreasing $\\kappa$ for a superconductor-insulator boundary condition ($(\\nabla\n-iA)\\Psi|_n=0$) while for a superconductor-normal boundary condition\n(approximated by the limiting case of $\\Psi|_S=0$) $H_p$ has a smaller value\nindependent of $\\kappa$ and proportional to $H_c$. We study the magnetization\ncurves and penetration fields at different sample sizes and for square and thin\nfilm geometries. For small mesoscopic samples we study the peaks and\ndiscontinuous jumps found in the magnetization as a function of magnetic field.\nTo interpret these jumps we consider that vortices located inside the sample\ninduce a reinforcement of the surface barrier at fields greater than the first\npenetration field $H_{p1}$. This leads to multiple penetration fields $H_{pi} =\nH_{p1}, H_{p2}, H_{p3}, ...$ for vortex entrance in mesoscopic samples. We\nstudy the dependence with sample size of the penetration fields $H_{pi}$. We\nexplain these multiple penetration fields extending the usual Bean-Livingston\nanalysis by considering the effect of vortices inside the superconductor and\nthe finite size of the sample.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 11 figures.
