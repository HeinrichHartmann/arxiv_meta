While capacity achieving code\nensembles typically are asymptotically bad in the sense that their minimum\ndistance does not grow linearly with block length, and they therefore exhibit\nan error floor at moderate-to-high signal to noise ratios, asymptotically good\ncodes usually converge further away from channel capacity. In this paper, we\nintroduce the concept of tuned turbo codes, a family of asymptotically good\nhybrid concatenated code ensembles, where asymptotic minimum distance growth\nrates, convergence thresholds, and code rates can be traded-off using two\ntuning parameters, {\\lambda} and {\\mu}. By decreasing {\\lambda}, the asymptotic\nminimum distance growth rate is reduced in exchange for improved iterative\ndecoding convergence behavior, while increasing {\\lambda} raises the asymptotic\nminimum distance growth rate at the expense of worse convergence behavior, and\nthus the code performance can be tuned to fit the desired application. By\ndecreasing {\\mu}, a similar tuning behavior can be achieved for higher rate\ncode ensembles.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory"]}]

We present\nextensive calculations of the superfluid density \\rho_s in the BCS-BEC\ncrossover regime of a uniform superfluid Fermi gas at finite temperatures. We\ninclude strong-coupling or fluctuation effects on these quantities within a\nGaussian approximation. We also incorporate the same fluctuation effects into\nthe BCS single-particle excitations described by the superfluid order parameter\n\\Delta and Fermi chemical potential \\mu, using the Nozi\\`eres and Schmitt-Rink\n(NSR) approximation. This treatment is shown to be necessary for consistent\ntreatment of \\rho_s over the entire BCS-BEC crossover. We also calculate the\ncondensate fraction N_c as a function of the temperature, a quantity which is\nquite different from the superfluid density \\rho_s. We show that the mean-field\nexpression for the condensate fraction N_c is a good approximation even in the\nstrong-coupling BEC regime. Our numerical results show how \\rho_s and N_c\ndepend on temperature, from the weak-coupling BCS region to the BEC region of\ntightly-bound Cooper pair molecules. In a companion paper by the authors\n(cond-mat/0609187), we derive an equivalent expression for \\rho_s from the\nthermodynamic potential, which exhibits the role of the pairing fluctuations in\na more explicit manner.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 12 figures"]}]
