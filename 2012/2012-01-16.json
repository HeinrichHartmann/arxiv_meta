The first relates to the observer's motion relative to the\nsource, and encapsulates the familiar concept of angular-diameter distance. The\nsecond term, which has proved to be the source of debate, arises from cosmic\nacceleration, but is rarely considered since it vanishes for photons with\nradial motion. This apparent form of light-bending gives the appearance of\ncurved geodesics even within a flat and homogeneous universe.

In\nthis model, receptor genes compete for a limited pool of transcription factors\n(TFs). The gene that recruits a target number of TFs is selected for\nexpression. To support this mechanism, we have attempted to detect repeated\nmotifs within known sequences of mouse olfactory receptor promoters. We find\nmotifs that are significantly overrepresented in olfactory versus other gene\npromoters. We identify possible TFs that can target these motifs. Our model\nsuggests that a small number of TFs can control the selection of a single gene\nout of ~2000 possibilities.\n"]}]

Different\nfrom the conventional 'topological observability' based approaches, this paper\nadvocates a much more refined, information-theoretic criterion, namely the\nmutual information (MI) between the PMU measurements and the power system\nstates. The proposed MI criterion can not only include the full system\nobservability as a special case, but also can rigorously model the remaining\nuncertainties in the power system states with PMU measurements, so as to\ngenerate highly informative PMU configurations. Further, the MI criterion can\nfacilitate robust PMU placement by explicitly modeling probabilistic PMU\noutages. We propose a greedy PMU placement algorithm, and show that it achieves\nan approximation ratio of (1-1/e) for any PMU placement budget. We further show\nthat the performance is the best that one can achieve in practice, in the sense\nthat it is NP-hard to achieve any approximation ratio beyond (1-1/e). Such\nperformance guarantee makes the greedy algorithm very attractive in the\npractical scenario of multi-stage installations for utilities with limited\nbudgets. Finally, simulation results demonstrate near-optimal performance of\nthe proposed PMU placement algorithm.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 7 figures"]}]

The simpler algorithms partition\nthe I/O array into consecutive ranges called bins, and they are applicable not\nonly to local-moment queries, but also to algebraic queries (MAX, AVERAGE, SUM,\netc.). With N buffers of size sqrt{n}, time complexity drops to O(sqrt n).
