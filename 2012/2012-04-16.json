We describe here a first-principles expression for strains in\ndisordered such materials, based on insight from a family of 'iso-auxetic'\nstructures.

The scheme is based on direct\nperturbation theory in the hybridization between the impurity and band\nelectrons. This two-impurity enhanced noncrossing approximation (TIE) fully\nincorporates the indirect interaction between the impurities which are mediated\nby the conduction electrons as well as additional arbitrary direct interaction\nmatrix elements. We qualify the approximation by investigating the uncoupled\ncase and conclude the TIE to be equally accurate as its single impurity\ncounterpart. The physical properties of the two-impurity Anderson model are\nfirst investigated in some limiting cases. In a regime, where each of the\nuncoupled two impurities would exhibit a pronounced Kondo effect, we ignore the\nindirect coupling via the conduction band and only incorporate direct\ninteractions. For a ferromagnetic direct exchange coupling, the system displays\na behavior similar to a spin-one Kondo effect, while an antiferromagnetic\ncoupling competes with the Kondo effect and produces a pseudogap in the\nmany-body Kondo resonance of the single-particle spectral function.\nInterestingly, a direct one-particle hopping also produces a pseudogap but\nadditionally pronounced side-peaks emerge. This gap is characteristically\ndifferent from the case with antiferromagnetic coupling, since it emerges as a\nconsequence of distinct Kondo effects for the bonding and anti-bonding orbital,\ni.e.\\ it reflects a splitting of even and odd parity states.For the general\ncase of only indirect coupling the results show signatures of all the\npreviously discussed limiting cases as function of the impurity-impurity\ndistance.

We explore how the predictions from the basic 3-species model\nare altered when the IGP module is extended to multiple resource\nsubpopulations.

The\ncatchment basins of this new graph do not overlap and form a watershed\npartition. Again, with an increasing steepness, the number of distinct\nwatershed partitions contained in a graph becomes smaller and smaller.\nUltimately, for natural image, an infinite steepness leads to a unique\nsolution, as it is not likely that two absolutely identical non ascending paths\nof infinite steepness connect a node with two distinct minima.

The design of controllers uses the theory of\ndynamical systems to construct a mathematical control law that ensures that the\ncontrolled system has certain properties, such as asymptotic convergence to an\nequilibrium point, while optimizing some performance criteria. However, owing\nto quantization errors arising from the use of fixed-point arithmetic, the\nimplementation of this control law can only guarantee practical stability:\nunder the actions of the implementation, the trajectories of the controlled\nsystem converge to a bounded set around the equilibrium point, and the size of\nthe bounded set is proportional to the error in the implementation. The problem\nof verifying whether a controller implementation achieves practical stability\nfor a given bounded set has been studied before. In this paper, we change the\nemphasis from verification to automatic synthesis. Using synthesis, the need\nfor formal verification can be considerably reduced thereby reducing the design\ntime as well as design cost of embedded control software.\n  We give a methodology and a tool to synthesize embedded control software that\nis Pareto optimal w.r.t. both performance criteria and practical stability\nregions. Our technique is a combination of static analysis to estimate\nquantization errors for specific controller implementations and stochastic\nlocal search over the space of possible controllers using particle swarm\noptimization. The effectiveness of our technique is illustrated using examples\nof various standard control systems: in most examples, we achieve controllers\nwith close LQR-LQG performance but with implementation errors, hence regions of\npractical stability, several times as small.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 2 figures"]}]

In the\ntraditional MG model, agents are assumed to have access to global information\nabout the past history of the underlying system, and they react by choosing one\nof the two available options associated with a single resource. Complex systems\narising in a modern society, however, can possess many resources so that the\nnumber of available strategies/resources can be multiple. We propose a class of\nmodels to investigate MG dynamics with multiple strategies. In particular, in\nsuch a system, at any time an agent can either choose a minority strategy (say\nwith probability p) based on available local information or simply choose a\nstrategy randomly (with probability 1 - p).

The optimality of a temporal path\n(journey) in this context can be defined in several terms, including\ntopological (e.g. {\\em shortest} in hops) and temporal (e.g. {\\em fastest,\nforemost}). The combinatorial problem of computing shortest, foremost, and\nfastest journeys {\\em given full knowledge} of the network schedule was\naddressed a decade ago (Bui-Xuan {\\it et al.}, 2003). A recent line of research\nhas focused on the distributed version of this problem, where foremost,\nshortest or fastest {\\em broadcast} are performed without knowing the schedule\nbeforehand. In this paper we show how to build {\\em fastest} broadcast trees\n(i.e., trees that minimize the global duration of the broadcast, however late\nthe departure is) in Time-Varying Graphs where intermittent edges are available\nperiodically (it is known that the problem is infeasible in the general case\neven if various parameters of the graph are know). We address the general case\nwhere contacts between nodes can have arbitrary durations and thus fastest\nroutes may consist of a mixture of {\\em continuous} and {\\em discontinuous}\nsegments (a more complex scenario than when contacts are {\\em punctual} and\nthus routes are only discontinuous). Using the abstraction of \\tclocks to\ncompute the temporal distances, we solve the fastest broadcast problem by first\nlearning, at the emitter, what is its time of {\\em minimum temporal\neccentricity} (i.e. the fastest time to reach all the other nodes), and second\nby building a {\\em foremost} broadcast tree relative to this particular\nemission date.\n"]}]

Stellar halos start to affect the surface\nbrightness profiles of the galaxies at \\sim 28 mag arcsec^-2, and at a radial\ndistance of \\sim 4-10 inner scale-lengths. We find that the light contribution\nfrom the stellar halo could be responsible of previous classification of\nsurface brightness profiles as Type III in late-type galaxies. In order to\nestimate the contribution of the stellar halo light to the total galaxy light,\nwe carried out a Bulge/Disk/Stellar Halo decomposition by simoultaneously\nfitting all components. The light contribution of the halo to the total galaxy\nlight varies from ~ 1% to ~ 5%, but in case of ongoing mergers, the halo light\nfraction can be as high as ~ 10%, independently of the luminosities of the\ngalaxies. We have also explored the integrated (g'-r') color of the stellar\nhalo of our galaxies. We find (g'-r') colors ranging from ~ 0.4 to ~ 1.2. By\nconfronting these colors with model predictions, we encounter problems to fit\nour very red colors onto stellar population grids with conventional IMFs. Very\nred halo colors can be attributed to stellar populations dominated by very low\nmass stars of low to intermediate metallicity produced by bottom-heavy IMFs.\n","Comment: Submitted to ApJ.
