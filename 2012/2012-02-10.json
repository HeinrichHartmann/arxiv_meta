Multi-wavelength observations of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows\nprovide important information about the activity of their central engines and\ntheir environments. In particular, the short timescale variability, such as\nbumps and/or rebrightening features visible in the multi-wavelength light\ncurves, is still poorly understood.\n  Aims. We analyze the multi-wavelength observations of the GRB100219A\nafterglow at redshift 4.7. In particular, we attempt to identify the physical\norigin of the late achromatic flares/bumps detected in the X-ray and optical\nbands.\n  Methods. We present ground-based optical photometric data and Swift X-ray\nobservations on GRB100219A. We analyzed the temporal behavior of the X-ray and\noptical light curves, as well as the X-ray spectra.\n  Results. The early flares in the X-ray and optical light curves peak\nsimultaneously at about 1000 s after the burst trigger, while late achromatic\nbumps in the X-ray and optical bands appear at about 20000 s after the burst\ntrigger. These are uncommon features in the afterglow phenomenology.\nConsidering the temporal and spectral properties, we argue that both optical\nand X-ray emissions come from the same mechanism. The late flares/bumps may be\nproduced by late internal shocks from long-lasting activity of the central\nengine. An off-axis origin for a structured jet model is also discussed to\ninterpret the bump shapes. The early optical bump can be interpreted as the\nafterglow onset, while the early X-ray flare could be caused by the internal\nactivity.

Above a threshold\nlaser excitation, our experiments reveal the apparition of the so-called inner\nphotoluminescence ring. It is characterized by a ring shaped photoluminescence\nwhich suddenly collapses once the laser excitation is terminated. We show that\nthe spectrally resolved dynamics is in agreement with an excitonic origin for\nthe inner-ring which is formed due to a local heating of indirect excitons by\nthe laser excitation. To confirm this interpretation and exclude the ionization\nof indirect excitons, we evaluate the excitonic density that is extracted from\nthe energy of the photoluminescence emission. It is shown that optically\ninjected carriers play a crucial role in that context as these are trapped in\nour field-effect device and then vary the electrostatic potential controlling\nthe confinement of indirect excitons. This disruptive effect blurs the\nestimation of the exciton concentration. However, it suppressed by smoothing\nthe electrostatic environment of the double quantum well by placing the latter\nbehind a super-lattice.

The existing schemes consider homogeneous\nsensor networks which have poor performance and scalability. Due to many-to-one\ntraffic pattern, sensors may communicate with small portion of its neighbours.\nKey management is the critical process in sensor nodes to secure the data. Most\nexisting schemes establish shared keys for all the sensors no matter whether\nthey are communicating or not. Hence it leads to large storage overhead.\nAnother problem in sensor network is compromised node attack and denial of\nservice attack which occurs because of its wireless nature. Existing multi path\nrouting algorithms are vulnerable to these attacks. So once an adversary\nacquires the routing algorithm, it can compute the same routes known to the\nsource, and hence endanger all information sent over these routes. If an\nadversary performs node compromise attack, they can easily get the encryption/\ndecryption keys used by that node and hence they can intercept the information\neasily. In this paper we are proposing a key management scheme which only\nestablishes shared keys with their communicating neighbour and a mechanism to\ngenerate randomized multipath routes for secure transmission of data to the\nsink. Here we are adopting heterogeneous sensor networks and we are utilizing\nelliptic curve cryptography for efficient key management which is more\nefficient, scalable, and highly secure and reduces communication overhead.
