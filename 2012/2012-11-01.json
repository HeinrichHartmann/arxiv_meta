In this paper, we consider a point-to-point\nwireless link over the narrowband flat-fading channel subject to time-varying\nco-channel interference. It is assumed that the receiver has no fixed power\nsupplies and thus needs to replenish energy opportunistically via WEH from the\nunintended interference and/or the intended signal sent by the transmitter.

Therefore,\nit is important to investigate when the receiver should switch between the two\nmodes of information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH), based on the\ninstantaneous channel and interference condition. In this paper, we derive the\noptimal mode switching rule at the receiver to achieve various trade-offs\nbetween wireless information transfer and energy harvesting.
