In addition to some processes previously considered, we also\nexamine a model of local mass media influence in cultural dynamics. Two\nmechanisms of information feedback are investigated: (i) direct mass media\ninfluence, where local or global mass media act as an additional element in the\nnetwork of interactions of each agent, and (ii) indirect mass media influence,\nwhere global media acts as a filter of the influence of the existing network of\ninteractions of each agent. Our results generalize previous findings showing\nthat cultural diversity builds-up by increasing the strength of the mass media\ninfluence. We find that this occurs independently of the mechanisms of action\n(direct or indirect) of the mass media message. However, through an analysis of\nthe full range of parameters measuring cultural diversity, we establish that\nthe enhancement of cultural diversity produced by interaction with mass media\nonly occurs for strong enough mass media messages. In comparison with previous\nstudies a main different result is that weak mass media messages, in\ncombination with agent-agent interaction, are efficient in producing cultural\nhomogeneity. Moreover, the homogenizing effect of weak mass media messages are\nmore efficient for direct local mass media messages than for global mass media\nmessages or indirect global mass media influences.\n","Comment: 20n pages, 10 figures"]}]

SDSS spectra probably miss\nthese features due to small fiber size. UV-excess early-type galaxies have on\naverage less dust and larger UV sizes (D>40 kpc) than other green-valley\ngalaxies, which argues for an external origin for the gas that is driving the\nSF. Thus, most of these galaxies appear `rejuvenated' (e.g., through minor\ngas-rich mergers or IGM accretion). For a smaller subset of the sample, the\ndeclining SF (from the original internal gas) cannot be ruled out. SF is rare\nin very massive early-types (M_* > 10^11 M_sun), a possible consequence of AGN\nfeedback.

A similar set of results is inferred\nalso for quantum systems with large spin although the $\\frac12$ instance\ncurrently seems beyond the reach of rigorous methods. We point out that the\nNe\\'el order in the plaquette energy distribution observed in numerical\nsimulations is an artefact of the OLRO and a judicious choice of the plaquette\nenergies. In particular, this order seems to disappear when the plaquette\nenergies are adjusted to vanish at the ground-state level. We also discuss the\nspecific role of the underlying symmetries in Wenzel and Janke's simulations\nand propose an enhanced method of numerical sampling that could in principle\nsignificantly increase the speed of convergence.\n","Comment: 36 pages, 2 EPS figs, minor changes, version to appear in J.

This constitutes a truly\nmicroscopic model of dynamical space-time, where Finsler geometries arise\nnaturally. The D-particle foam model involves point-like brane defects\n(D-particles), which provide the topologically non-trivial foamy structures of\nspace-time. The D-particles can capture and emit stringy matter and this leads\nto a recoil of D-particles.

We show that such a type of stochastic space-time foam can lead\nto acceptable cosmologies at late epochs of the Universe, due to the\nnon-trivial properties of the supersymmetric (BPS like) D-particle defects,\nwhich are such so as not to affect significantly the Hubble expansion. The\nrestrictions placed on the free parameters of the Finsler type metric are\nobtained from solving the Boltzmann equation in this background for relic\nabundances of a Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP) dark matter candidate.\nIt is demonstrated that the D-foam acts as a source for particle production in\nthe Boltzmann equation, thereby leading to enhanced thermal LSP relic\nabundances relative to those in the Standard LambdaCDM Cosmology.

Although the\nanswer is indeed affirmative, traditionally such effects have been considered\nnegligible. We show that for sufficiently light mass eigenstates such processes\ncan become significant over macroscopic length scales. A critical review of the\nhistorical literature reveals various shortcomings of the standard methods;\nspecifically, one finds that they are restricted to states for which the\nexpectation value of momentum vanishes. Furthermore, the results obtained here\ncorrect Feynman's analysis of this subject. A formalism is thus developed that\nallows the description of states with non-zero momentum, which is then applied\nto the OPERA and ICARUS neutrino-speed experiments. For OPERA we choose a mass\nin the nano electron-volt range and find that although our formalism predicts a\nnon-zero detection probability for an early arrival time of 60 ns, the\npredicted event distribution is maximal on the light-cone. Consequently, our\nprediction does not reproduce the peak at 60 ns reported by the OPERA\ncollaboration. Turning to the ICARUS experiment, we note that while the\ncollaboration reported an average time of flight that is consistent with the\nspeed of light, the event data with its associated uncertainties nevertheless\nindicates that some of the detection events are separated from their\ncorresponding emission events by a space-like interval. For a micro\nelectron-volt mass range, this is in agreement with the here reported\nformalism.

This paper shows that cooperation has fundamental\nlimitations. The main result is that even full cooperation between transmitters\ncannot in general change an interference-limited network to a noise-limited\nnetwork. The key idea is that there exists a spectral efficiency upper bound\nthat is independent of the transmit power. First, a spectral efficiency upper\nbound is established for systems that rely on pilot-assisted channel\nestimation; in this framework, cooperation is shown to be possible only within\nclusters of limited size, which are subject to out-of-cluster interference\nwhose power scales with that of the in-cluster signals. Second, an upper bound\nis also shown to exist when cooperation is through noncoherent communication;\nthus, the spectral efficiency limitation is not a by-product of the reliance on\npilot-assisted channel estimation. Consequently, existing literature that\nroutinely assumes the high-power spectral efficiency scales with the log of the\ntransmit power provides only a partial characterization. The complete\ncharacterization proposed in this paper subdivides the high-power regime into a\ndegrees-of-freedom regime, where the scaling with the log of the transmit power\nholds approximately, and a saturation regime, where the spectral efficiency\nhits a ceiling that is independent of the power. Using a cellular system as an\nexample, it is demonstrated that the spectral efficiency saturates at power\nlevels of operational relevance.\n","Comment: 27 pages"]}]

In the context of consensus problems, the\nunreliability of communication links between nodes has been traditionally\nmodeled by allowing the underlying graph to vary with time. In other words,\ndepending on the realization of the link erasures, the underlying graph at each\ntime instant is assumed to be a subgraph of the original graph. Implicit in\nthis model is the assumption that the erasures are symmetric: if at time t the\npacket from node i to node j is dropped, the same is true for the packet\ntransmitted from node j to node i. However, in practical wireless communication\nsystems this assumption is unreasonable and, due to the lack of symmetry,\nstandard averaging protocols cannot guarantee that the network will reach\nconsensus to the true average. In this paper we explore the use of channel\ncoding to improve the performance of consensus algorithms. For symmetric\nerasures, we show that, for certain ranges of the system parameters, repetition\ncodes can speed up the convergence rate. For asymmetric erasures we show that\ntree codes (which have recently been designed for erasure channels) can be used\nto simulate the performance of the original \"unerased\" graph. Thus, unlike\nconventional consensus methods, we can guarantee convergence to the average in\nthe asymmetric case. The price is a slowdown in the convergence rate, relative\nto the unerased network, which is still often faster than the convergence rate\nof conventional consensus algorithms over noisy links.\n"]}]
