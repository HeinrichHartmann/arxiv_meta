The GEp-II experiment in Jefferson Lab's Hall A measured $R$ at four\n$Q^2$ values in the range 3.5 GeV$^2 \\le Q^2 \\le 5.6$ GeV$^2$.

This is exploited by\nsome currently intensively studied techniques of formal verification that\nrepresent an infinite number of states using a finite tree automaton. However,\ncurrently there is no tree automata library implementation that would provide\nan efficient and flexible support for such methods. Thus the aim of this\nMaster's Thesis is to provide such a library. The present paper first describes\nthe theoretical background of finite tree automata and regular tree languages.\nThen it surveys the current implementations of tree automata libraries and\nstudies various verification techniques, outlining requirements for the\nlibrary. Representation of a finite tree automaton and algorithms that perform\nstandard language operations on this representation are proposed in the next\npart, which is followed by description of library implementation. Through a\nseries of experiments it is shown that the library can compete with other\navailable tree automata libraries, in certain areas being even significantly\nsuperior to them.\n","Comment: Master's thesis"]}]

We find that the skew scattering, principally\nresponsible for the extrinsic contribution to the anomalous Hall effect,\nvanishes for the two-dimensional electron system if both chiral Rashba subbands\nare partially occupied, and vanishes always for the two-dimensional hole gas\nstudied here, regardless of the band filling. Our prediction can be tested with\nthe proposed coplanar two-dimensional electron/hole gas device and can be used\nas a benchmark to understand the crossover from the intrisic to the extrinsic\nanomalous Hall effect.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures included"]}]

It was observed earlier that the first order hot loop\ncorrections do not affect the electromagnetic properties of hot media due to\nthe absence of self-interaction of photons.

It has also been noticed that the hot loops have to be\nintegrated before the cold ones to establish the order by order cancelation of\nsingularities to ensure renormalizability of the theory.
