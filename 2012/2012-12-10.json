This metric is used to compute quantities along an approximate\neffective lightcone of the averaged model of the Universe. As opposed to the\nstandard Friedmann model, we parameterize this template metric by exact scaling\nproperties of an averaged inhomogeneous cosmology, and we also motivate this\nform of the metric by results on a geometrical smoothing of inhomogeneous\ncosmological hypersurfaces. We test our hypothesis for the template metric\nagainst supernova data and the position of the CMB peaks, and infer the\ngoodness--of--fit and parameter uncertainties. We find that averaged\ninhomogeneous models can reproduce the observations without requiring an\nadditional Dark Energy component (though a volume acceleration is still\nneeded), and that current data do not disfavour our main assumption on the\neffective lightcone structure.

Here we introduce TAM waves, solutions of fixed total angular\nmomentum to the Helmholtz equation, for three-dimensional scalar, vector, and\ntensor fields. The vector TAM waves of given total angular momentum can be\ndecomposed further into a set of three basis functions of fixed orbital angular\nmomentum (OAM), a set of fixed helicity, or a basis consisting of a\nlongitudinal (L) and two transverse (E and B) TAM waves. The symmetric\ntraceless rank-2 tensor TAM waves can be similarly decomposed into a basis of\nfixed OAM or fixed helicity, or a basis that consists of a longitudinal (L),\ntwo vector (VE and VB, of opposite parity), and two tensor (TE and TB, of\nopposite parity) waves. We show how all of the vector and tensor TAM waves can\nbe obtained by applying derivative operators to scalar TAM waves. This operator\napproach then allows one to decompose a vector field into three covariant\nscalar fields for the L, E, and B components and symmetric-traceless-tensor\nfields into five covariant scalar fields for the L, VE, VB, TE, and TB\ncomponents. We provide projections of the vector and tensor TAM waves onto\nvector and tensor spherical harmonics. We provide calculational detail to\nfacilitate the assimilation of this formalism into cosmological calculations.\nAs an example, we calculate the power spectra of the deflection angle for\ngravitational lensing by density perturbations and by gravitational waves. We\ncomment on an alternative approach to CMB fluctuations based on TAM waves. Our\nwork may have applications elsewhere in field theory and in general relativity.\n","Comment: 32 pages, Published version in PRD"]}]

In UW-OFDM the cyclic\nprefixes (CPs) are replaced by deterministic sequences, the so-called unique\nwords (UWs). The UWs are generated by appropriately loading a set of redundant\nsubcarriers. By that a systematic complex number Reed Solomon (RS) code\nconstruction is introduced in a quite natural way, because an RS code may be\ndefined as the set of vectors, for which a block of successive zeros occurs in\nthe other domain w.r.t. a discrete Fourier transform. (For a fixed block\ndifferent to zero, i.e., a UW, a coset code of an RS code is generated.) A\nremaining problem in the original systematic coded UW-OFDM concept is the fact\nthat the redundant subcarrier symbols disproportionately contribute to the mean\nOFDM symbol energy. In this paper we introduce the concept of non-systematic\ncoded UW-OFDM, where the redundancy is no longer allocated to dedicated\nsubcarriers, but distributed over all subcarriers. We derive optimum complex\nvalued code generator matrices matched to the BLUE (best linear unbiased\nestimator) and to the LMMSE (linear minimum mean square error) data estimator,\nrespectively. With the help of simulations we highlight the advantageous\nspectral properties and the superior BER (bit error ratio) performance of\nnon-systematic coded UW-OFDM compared to systematic coded UW-OFDM as well as to\nCP-OFDM in AWGN (additive white Gaussian noise) and in frequency selective\nenvironments.\n","Comment: IEEE Tranactions on Signal Processing, Vol. 60, No. 1, 2012. arXiv\n  admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1202.1398"]}]

First we investigatethe\nMaxwell-Dirac equivalence (MDE) of the first kind. Crucial to that proposed\nequivalence is the possibility of solving for $\\Psi$(a representative on a\ngiven spinorial frame of a Dirac-Hestenes spinor field (DHSF)) the equation\n$F=\\Psi \\gamma_{21} \\sim{\\Psi}$, where F is a given electromagnetic field. Such\ntask is presented in this paper and it permits to clarify some possible\nobjections to the MDE which claims that no MDE may exist, because F has six\n(real) degrees of freedom and $\\Psi$ has eight (real) degrees of freedom. Also,\nwe review the generalized Maxwell equation describing charges and monopoles.\nThe enterprise is worth even if there is no evidence until now for magnetic\nmonopoles, because there are at least two faithful field equations that have\nthe form that equations. One is the generalized Hertz potential field equation\nassociated with Maxwell theory and the other is a (non linear) equation\nsatisfied by the 2-form field, which is part of a representative of a DHSF that\nsolves the Dirac-Hestenes equation for a free electron. This is a new and\nsurprising result, which can also be called MDE of the second kind. It strongly\nsuggests that the electron is a composed system with more elementary\n  \"charges\" of the electric and magnetic types. Finally, we use the MDE of the\nfirst kind together with a reasonable hypothesis to give a derivation of the\nfamous Seiberg-Witten equations on Minkowski spacetime.\n","Comment: Misprints and typos have been corrected and some modifications\n  concerning a previous version have been done.
