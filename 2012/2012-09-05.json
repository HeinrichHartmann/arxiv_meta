The theory of such models simplifies considerably if one takes a\npricing kernel approach. In one dimension, once the underlying L\\'evy process\nhas been specified, the GLM has four parameters: the initial price, the\ninterest rate, the volatility, and the risk aversion.

For a GLM, this interpretation\nis not valid: the excess rate of return is a nonlinear function of the\nvolatility and the risk aversion. It is shown that for positive volatility and\nrisk aversion the excess rate of return above the interest rate is positive,\nand is increasing with respect to these variables.

When scaled to the virial\nproperties of the host halo, the abundance and radial distribution of subhaloes\nare also very similar, despite the fact that Aquarius and Phoenix haloes differ\nby roughly three decades in virial mass. The most notable difference is that\ncluster haloes have been assembled more recently and are thus significantly\nless relaxed than galaxy haloes, which leads to decreased regularity, increased\nhalo-to-halo scatter and sizable deviations from the mean trends. This\naccentuates the effects of the strong asphericity of individual clusters on\nsurface density profiles, which may vary by up to a factor of three at a given\nradius, depending on projection. The high apparent concentration reported for\nsome strong-lensing clusters might very well reflect these effects.

Due to the same convection term of the Boltzmann equation\nand the Vlasov equation, it is very convenient to use the moment expansion in\nthe NRxx method to approximate the distribution function in the Vlasov\nequations. The moment closure recently presented in [5] is applied to achieve\nthe globally hyperbolicity so that the local well-posedness of the moment\nsystem is attained. This makes our simulations using high order moment\nexpansion accessible in the case of the distribution far away from the\nequilibrium which appears very often in the solution of the Vlasov equations.\nWith the moment expansion of the distribution function, the acceleration in the\nvelocity space results in an ordinary differential system of the macroscopic\nvelocity, thus is easy to be handled. The numerical method we developed can\nkeep both the mass and the momentum conserved. We carry out the simulations of\nboth the Vlasov-Poisson equations and the Vlasov-Poisson-BGK equations to study\nthe linear Landau damping. The numerical convergence is exhibited in terms of\nthe moment number and the spatial grid size, respectively. The variation of\ndiscretized energy as well as the dependence of the recurrence time on moment\norder is investigated. The linear Landau damping is well captured for different\nwave numbers and collision frequencies. We find that the Landau damping rate\nlinearly and monotonically converges in the spatial grid size.

The aim of this paper is to\nstudy the use of such biologically inspired agents to effectively route the\npackets in WMNs.

For example, in Z-channels, the all-1 codeword is prone to\nhave more errors than the all-0 codeword. This motivates us to develop\nnonuniform codes whose codewords can tolerate different numbers of asymmetric\nerrors depending on their Hamming weights. The idea in a nonuniform codes'\nconstruction is to augment the redundancy in a content-dependent way and\nguarantee the worst case reliability while maximizing the code size. In this\npaper, we first study nonuniform codes for Z-channels, namely, they only suffer\none type of errors, say 1 to 0. Specifically, we derive their upper bounds,\nanalyze their asymptotic performances, and introduce two general constructions.\nThen we extend the concept and results of nonuniform codes to general binary\nasymmetric channels, where the error probability for each bit from 0 to 1 is\nsmaller than that from 1 to 0.\n","Comment: 2 columns, 15 pages"]}]

It has been suggested that collapsing magnetic traps may contribute\nto accelerating particles to high energies during solar flares.\n  Aims. We present a detailed investigation of the energization processes of\nparticles in collapsing magnetic traps, using a specific model. We also compare\nfor the first time the energization processes in a symmetric and an asymmetric\ntrap model.\n  Methods. Particle orbits are calculated using guiding centre theory. We\nsystematically investigate the dependence of the energization process on\ninitial position, initial energy and initial pitch angle.\n  Results. We find that in our symmetric trap model particles can gain up to\nabout 50 times their initial energy, but that for most initial conditions the\nenergy gain is more moderate. Particles with an initial position in the weak\nfield region of the collapsing trap and with pitch angles around 90 degrees\nachieve the highest energy gain, with betatron acceleration of the\nperpendicular energy the dominant energization mechanism. For particles with\nsmaller initial pitch angle, but still outside the loss cone, we find the\npossibility of a significant increase in parallel energy. This increase in\nparallel energy can be attributed to the curvature term in the parallel\nequation of motion and the associated energy gain happens in the center of the\ntrap where the field line curvature has its maximum. We find qualitatively\nsimilar results for the asymmetric trap model, but with smaller energy gains\nand a larger number of particles escaping from the trap.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 13 figures.
