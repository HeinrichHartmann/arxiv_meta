This method is\napplied to the interaction of molecules with intense, short-duration laser\npulses. The electronic response of the molecule is described using\ntime-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and the resulting Kohn-Sham\nequations are solved numerically using finite difference techniques in\nconjunction with local and global adaptations of an underlying grid in\ncurvilinear coordinates. Using this approach, simulations can be carried out\nfor a wide range of molecules and both all-electron and pseudopotential\ncalculations are possible. The approach is applied to the study of high\nharmonic generation in N2 and benzene using linearly-polarized laser pulses\nand, to the best of our knowledge, the results for benzene represent the first\nTDDFT calculations of high harmonic generation in benzene using linearly\npolarized laser pulses. For N2 an enhancement of the cut-off harmonics is\nobserved whenever the laser polarization is aligned perpendicular to the\nmolecular axis. This enhancement is attributed to the symmetry properties of\nthe Kohn-Sham orbital that responds predominantly to the pulse. In benzene we\npredict that a suppression in the cut-off harmonics occurs whenever the laser\npolarization is aligned parallel to the molecular plane. We attribute this\nsuppression to the symmetry-induced response of the highest-occupied molecular\norbital.\n"]}]

Only by means of a\nsignificant nuclear fusion amplification of the tidal gravitational potential\nenergy released in the Sun, may planetary tides produce irradiance output\noscillations with a sufficient magnitude to influence solar dynamo processes.\nHere we use an adaptation of the well-known mass-luminosity relation to\ncalculate a conversion factor between the solar luminosity and the potential\ngravitational power associated to the mass lost by nuclear fusion: the average\nestimated amplification factor is A=4,250,000. We use this magnification factor\nto evaluate the theoretical luminosity oscillations that planetary tides may\npotentially stimulate inside the solar core by making its nuclear fusion rate\noscillate. By converting the power related to this energy into solar irradiance\nunits at 1 AU we find that the tidal oscillations may be able to theoretically\ninduce an oscillating luminosity increase from 0.05-0.65 $W/m^{2}$ to 0.25-1.63\n$W/m^{2}$, which is a range compatible with the ACRIM satellite observed total\nsolar irradiance fluctuations.
