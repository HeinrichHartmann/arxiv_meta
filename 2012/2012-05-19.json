Harmonic\nfunctions arise in many applications, such as physics and the theory of\nstochastic processes. Of interest classically are harmonic polynomials, which\nhave a simple classification. Further, the work of Reznick, building on the\nwork of others, namely Sylvester, Clifford, Rosanes, Gundelfinger, Cartan,\nMaass and Helgason, has led to a classification of all polynomial solutions to\na differential equation of arising from a homogeneous polynomial over an\nalgebraically closed field.\n  The definition of harmonicity can be extended to the space of polynomials in\nfree variables using the concept of a noncommutative Laplacian. Given a\npositive integer $\\ell$, the $\\ell$-Laplacian of a noncommutative (abbreviated\nNC) polynomial $p$ in the direction $h$ is defined to be $$ \\lap_{\\ell}[p,h] :=\n\\sum_{i=1}^g \\frac{d^{\\ell}}{dt^{\\ell}} p(x_1,..., x_i + th,..., x_g).$$ A NC\npolynomial $p$ is said to be $\\ell$-harmonic if $\\lap_{\\ell}[p,h] = 0$. When\n$\\ell = 2$, then the $\\ell$-Laplacian is simply called the Laplacian and a\n$\\ell$-harmonic NC polynomial is simply called harmonic. More generally, the\nconcept of a constant coefficient differential equation can be extended to the\nspace of NC polynomials via the NC directional derivative.\n  The main contribution of this paper is to classify the set of $\\ell$-harmonic\nNC polynomials. The result is analogous to the classification of polynomial\nsolutions to a differential equation of the form $q(\\partial/\\partial x_1, ...,\n\\partial/\\partial x_g)y = 0$ given by Reznick. Additionally, this thesis proves\nnew results about NC \"subharmonic\" polynomials.\n  This work extends results of Helton, McAllaster, and Hernandez on NC harmonic\nand subharmonic polynomials, which classified solutions for the $\\ell = 2$ case\nin two noncommuting variables $x_1$ and $x_2$.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:0909.4884"]}]
