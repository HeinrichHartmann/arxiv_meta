The\nclusters are formed following a cluster initial mass function (CMF) similar to\nthe stellar initial mass function (IMF). Both the IMF and the CMF favour\nlow-mass objects. The numerous low-mass clusters will lack high mass stars. If\nthe integrated galactic initial mass function originates from stars formed in\nclusters, the IGIMF could be steeper than the IMF. We investigate how well\nconstrained this steepening is and how it depends on the choice of sampling\nmethod and CMF. We compare analytic sampling to several implementations of\nrandom sampling of the IMF, and different CMFs. We implement different IGIMFs\ninto GALEV to obtain colours and metallicities for galaxies. Choosing different\nways of sampling the IMF results in different IGIMFs. Depending on the lower\ncluster mass limit and the slope of the cluster mass function, the steepening\nvaries between very strong and negligible. We find the size of the effect is\ncontinuous as a function of the power-law slope of the CMF, if the CMF extends\nto masses smaller than the maximum stellarmass. The number of O-stars detected\nby GAIA might help in judging on the importance of the IGIMF effect. The impact\nof different IGIMFs on integrated galaxy photometry is small, within the\nintrinsic scatter of observed galaxies. Observations of gas fractions and\nmetallicities could rule out at least the most extreme sampling methods. As we\nstill do not understand the details of star formation, one sampling method\ncannot be favoured over another. Also, the CMF at very low cluster masses is\nnot well constrained observationally.

The term environment has been used to\ndescribe a wide variety of measures that may or may not correlate with each\nother. Popular measures of environment include the distance to the N'th nearest\nneighbour, the number density of objects within some distance, or the mass of\nthe host dark matter halo. We use results from the Millennium simulation and a\nsemi-analytic model for galaxy formation to quantify the relations between\nenvironment and halo mass. We show that the environmental parameters used in\nthe observational literature are in effect measures of halo mass, even if they\nare measured for a fixed stellar mass. The strongest correlation between\nenvironment and halo mass arises when the number of objects is counted out to a\ndistance of 1.5-2 times the virial radius of the host halo and when the\ngalaxies/haloes are required to be relatively bright/massive. For observational\nstudies the virial radius is not easily determined, but the number of\nneighbours out to 1-2 Mpc/h gives a similarly strong correlation. For the\ndistance to the N'th nearest neighbour the correlation with halo mass is nearly\nas strong provided N>2. We demonstrate that this environmental parameter\nbecomes insensitive to halo mass if it is constructed from dimensionless\nquantities. This can be achieved by scaling the minimum luminosity/mass of\nneighbours to that of the object in question and by dividing the distance to a\nlength scale associated with either the neighbour or the galaxy under\nconsideration. We show how such a halo mass independent environmental parameter\ncan be defined for observational and numerical studies.

In this work, we study extreme events in a generalized random walk\nmodel in which the walk is preferentially biased by the network topology.

Further,\nthe probability for the occurrence of extreme events on any node in the network\ndepends on its 'generalized strength', a measure of the ability of a node to\nattract walkers. The 'generalized strength' is a function of the degree of the\nnode and that of its nearest neighbors.

Nonetheless, Li-rich red giants do exist.\nWe present 15 Li-rich red giants--14 of which are new discoveries--among a\nsample of 2054 red giants in Milky Way dwarf satellite galaxies. Our sample\nmore than doubles the number of low-mass, metal-poor ([Fe/H] <~ -0.7) Li-rich\nred giants, and it includes the most-metal poor Li-enhanced star known ([Fe/H]\n= -2.82, A(Li)_NLTE = 3.15). Because most of these stars have Li abundances\nlarger than the universe's primordial value, the Li in these stars must have\nbeen created rather than saved from destruction. These Li-rich stars appear\nlike other stars in the same galaxies in every measurable regard other than Li\nabundance. We consider the possibility that Li enrichment is a universal phase\nof evolution that affects all stars, and it seems rare only because it is\nbrief.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures, accepted to ApJ Letters, version 3 includes\n  additional references and minor typographical changes"]}]

The width of the\nLandau line becomes maximum for an optimal value of the relative dipolar\nstrength. The presence of transverse dipoles leads to the stabilization of the\nthermotropic biaxial nematic phase at higher temperature and for a range of\nvalues of molecular biaxiality. The structural properties in the uniaxial and\nbiaxial phases are investigated by evaluating the first rank and second rank\norientational correlation functions. The dipole induced long range order of the\nanti-ferroelectric structure in the biaxial nematic phase, is revealed.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 8 figures"]}]

However, existing work did not exploit the important property of\nskewed velocity distributions. In many real world scenarios, objects travel\npredominantly along only a few directions. Examples include vehicles on road\nnetworks, flights, people walking on the streets, etc. The search space for a\nquery is heavily dependent on the velocity distribution of the objects grouped\nin the nodes of an index tree. Motivated by this observation, we propose the\nvelocity partitioning (VP) technique, which exploits the skew in velocity\ndistribution to speed up query processing using moving object indexes. The VP\ntechnique first identifies the \"dominant velocity axes (DVAs)\" using a\ncombination of principal components analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering.\nThen, a moving object index (e.g., a TPR-tree) is created based on each DVA,\nusing the DVA as an axis of the underlying coordinate system. An object is\nmaintained in the index whose DVA is closest to the object's current moving\ndirection. Thus, all the objects in an index are moving in a near 1-dimensional\nspace instead of a 2-dimensional space. As a result, the expansion of the\nsearch space with time is greatly reduced, from a quadratic function of the\nmaximum speed (of the objects in the search range) to a near linear function of\nthe maximum speed. The VP technique can be applied to a wide range of moving\nobject index structures. We have implemented the VP technique on two\nrepresentative ones, the TPR*-tree and the Bx-tree. Extensive experiments\nvalidate that the VP technique consistently improves the performance of those\nindex structures.\n","Comment: VLDB2012"]}]

Einstein's strength of systems of\npartial differential and difference equations based on the computation of\nHilbert-type dimension polynomials of the associated differential and\ndifference field extensions. Also we present algorithms for such computations,\nwhich are based on the Gr\\\"obner basis method adjusted for the modules over\nrings of differential, difference and inversive difference operators. The\ndeveloped technique is applied to some fundamental systems of PDEs of\nmathematical physics such as the diffusion equation, Maxwell equations and\nequations for an electromagnetic field given by its potential. In each of these\ncases we determine the strength of the original system of PDEs and the strength\nof the corresponding systems of partial difference equations obtained by\nforward and symmetric difference schemes. In particular, we obtain a method for\ncomparing two difference schemes from the point of view of their strength.\n"]}]

An adaptive\nsteganography based on modified pixel-value differencing through management of\npixel values within the range of gray scale has been proposed in this paper.\nPVD method is used and check whether the pixel value exceeds the range on\nembedding. Positions where the pixel exceeds boundary has been marked and a\ndelicate handle is used to keep the value within the range. From the\nexperimental it is seen that the results obtained in proposed method provides\nwith identical payload and visual fidelity of stego-image compared to the pvd\nmethod.\n","Comment: 10 pages,3 figures,The Second International Conference on Computer\n  Science, engineering and Applications (CCSEA-2012), Delhi, India.
