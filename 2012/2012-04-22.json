The use of functional imaging techniques has revealed a\nspectrum of cognitive styles with respect to the differential handling of novel\nor corroborating information that is correlated to political affiliation. Here\nwe characterize the collective behavior of an agent-based model whose inter\nindividual interactions due to information exchange in the form of opinions are\nin qualitative agreement with experimental neuroscience data. The main\nconclusion derived connects the existence of diversity in the cognitive\nstrategies and statistics of the sets of moral foundations and suggests that\nthis connection arises from interactions between agents. Thus a simple\ninteracting agent model, whose interactions are in accord with empirical data\non conformity and learning processes, presents statistical signatures\nconsistent with moral judgment patterns of conservatives and liberals as\nobtained by survey studies of social psychology.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 4 figures, 2 C codes, to appear in Advances in Complex\n  Systems"]}]

The report describes the detector performance required at CLIC, taking\ninto account the interaction point environment and especially beaminduced\nbackgrounds. Two detector concepts, designed around highly granular\ncalorimeters and based on concepts studied for the International Linear\nCollider (ILC), are described and used to study the physics reach and potential\nof such a collider. Detector subsystems and the principal engineering\nchallenges are illustrated. The overall performance of these CLIC detector\nconcepts is demonstrated by studies of the performance of individual\nsubdetector systems as well as complete simulation studies of six benchmark\nphysics processes. These full detector simulation and reconstruction studies\ninclude beaminduced backgrounds and physics background processes. After\noptimisation of the detector concepts and adopting the reconstruction\nalgorithms the results show very efficient background rejection and clearly\ndemonstrate the physics potential at CLIC in terms of precision mass and cross\nsection measurements.
