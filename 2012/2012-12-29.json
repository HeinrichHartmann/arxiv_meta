For a rigid body to be in static equilibrium the condition is that\nnet force and net torque acting on the body should be zero. That clearly\nsignifies that if equal weights are placed on either sides of a balance, the\nbalance should be in equilibrium, even if its beam is not horizontal (we have\nconsidered the beam to be straight and have no thickness, an ideal case). Thus,\nalthough the weights are equal, they will appear different which is puzzling.\nThis also shows that the concept of equilibrium is confusing, especially\nneutral equilibrium is confused to be stable equilibrium. The study not only\nthrows more light on the concept of static equilibrium, but also clarifies that\na structure need not be firm and steady even if it is in static equilibrium.\n"]}]
