We analyze a scalar potential along directions\nwhere all of and one of the three Higgs fields develop their vacuum expectation\nvalues, and find unrealistic minima deeper than the electroweak symmetry\nbreaking (EWSB) vacuum. These unrealistic minima threaten the realization of\nthe successful EWSB and therefore should be avoided. Necessary conditions to\navoid these minima result in constraints of parameters. We show that a wide and\nsignificant region of the parameter space, especially large \\lambda, is ruled\nout by our constraints.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 4 figures"]}]

The nucleon\ndistribution is obtained in the framework of macroscopic nuclear models in a\nway depending on the equation of state of uniform nuclear matter near the\nsaturation density. We find that at an energy of order 40 MeV, the reaction\ncross section calculated for neutron- rich isotopes significantly increases as\nthe parameter L characterizing the density dependence of the symmetry energy\nincreases, while at energies of order 300 and 800 MeV, it is almost independent\nof L.
