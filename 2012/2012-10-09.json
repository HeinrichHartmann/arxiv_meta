A\nkey characteristic of PLP frameworks is that they are conservative extensions\nto non-probabilistic logic programs which have been widely used for knowledge\nrepresentation. PLP frameworks extend traditional logic programming semantics\nto a distribution semantics, where the semantics of a probabilistic logic\nprogram is given in terms of a distribution over possible models of the\nprogram. However, the inference techniques used in these works rely on\nenumerating sets of explanations for a query answer. Consequently, these\nlanguages permit very limited use of random variables with continuous\ndistributions. In this paper, we present a symbolic inference procedure that\nuses constraints and represents sets of explanations without enumeration. This\npermits us to reason over PLPs with Gaussian or Gamma-distributed random\nvariables (in addition to discrete-valued random variables) and linear equality\nconstraints over reals. We develop the inference procedure in the context of\nPRISM; however the procedure's core ideas can be easily applied to other PLP\nlanguages as well. An interesting aspect of our inference procedure is that\nPRISM's query evaluation process becomes a special case in the absence of any\ncontinuous random variables in the program. The symbolic inference procedure\nenables us to reason over complex probabilistic models such as Kalman filters\nand a large subclass of Hybrid Bayesian networks that were hitherto not\npossible in PLP frameworks.

The proximity of Circinus allows us to\nobserve in striking detail the structure of the radio lobes, revealing for the\nfirst time edge-brightened emission both in X-rays and radio. After considering\nvarious other possible scenarios, we show that this extended emission in\nCircinus is most likely caused by a jet-driven outflow, which is driving shells\nof strongly shocked gas into the halo of the host galaxy. In this context, we\nestimate Mach numbers M=2.7-3.6 and M=2.8-5.3 for the W and E shells\nrespectively. We derive temperatures of 0.74 (+0.06, -0.05) keV and 0.8-1.8 keV\nfor the W and E shells, and an expansion velocity of ~900-950 km/s. We estimate\nthat the total energy (thermal and kinetic) involved in creating both shells is\n~2x10^55 erg, and their age is ~10^6 years. Comparing these results with those\nwe previously obtained for Centaurus A, NGC 3801 and Mrk 6, we show that these\nparameters scale approximately with the radio power of the parent AGN. The\nspatial coincidence between the X-ray and edge-brightened radio emission in\nCircinus resembles the morphology of some SNR shocks.

An important\naspect of cytoskeletal assemblies is their dynamic nature, which allows\nremodeling in response to external cues. The reversible nature of crosslink\nbinding is an important mechanism that underlies these dynamical processes.\nHere, we develop a theoretical model that provides insight into how the\nmechanical properties of cytoskeletal networks may depend on their underlying\nconstituting elements.

During loading\ncrosslink unbinding processes lead to a relaxation of stress and therefore to a\nreduction of the network modulus and eventually to network failure, when all\ncrosslink are unbound.

The presented approach does not require edge-based image\ninformation and relies on regional image texture. Consequently, the proposed\nmethod demonstrates robustness in situations of low image contrast or poor\nlayer-to-layer image gradients. Diffusion mapping is applied to 2D and 3D OCT\ndatasets composed of two steps, one for partitioning the data into important\nand less important sections, and another one for localization of internal\nlayers.In the first step, the pixels/voxels are grouped in rectangular/cubic\nsets to form a graph node.The weights of a graph are calculated based on\ngeometric distances between pixels/voxels and differences of their mean\nintensity.The first diffusion map clusters the data into three parts, the\nsecond of which is the area of interest.

Among many parameters that impact the degree of\npolarization (DOP) of a QD system, the shape asymmetry is a critical factor. We\nperform multi-million-atom simulations to study the impact of the elliptical\nshapes on the electronic and polarization properties of single and vertically\nstacked InAs QDs. The comparison between a low aspect ratio (AR) and a high AR\nQD reveals that the electronic and the polarization properties strongly depend\non the AR of the QD; the elongation of a tall QD allows tuning of the DOP over\na much wider range. We then extend our analysis to an experimentally reported\nvertical stack of nine QDs (9-VSQDs) that has shown significant potential to\nachieve isotropic polarization properties. We analyse the contribution from the\nshape asymmetry in the large, experimentally measured, in-plane polarization\nanisotropy. Our analysis shows that the orientation of the base elongation\ncontrols the sign of the DOP; however the magnitude of the base elongation has\nonly a very little impact on the magnitude of the DOP. We further predict that\nthe elliptical shape of the 9-VSQDs can only tune either DOP[110] or DOP[-110]\nfor an isotropic response.

This result would enrich the theory of the invulnerability of the\nnetwork, and can be used to build the robust social, technological and\nbiological networks, and also has the potential to find the target of drugs.\n"]}]

The goal is to create a\ntwo-dimensional visualization of the graph structure such that edge-crossings\nare minimized while preserving proximity relations between nodes. This paper\nprovides a fundamentally new approach for addressing the crossing minimization\ncriteria that exploits Farkas' Lemma to re-express the condition for no\nedge-crossings as a system of nonlinear inequality constraints. The approach\nhas an intuitive geometric interpretation closely related to support vector\nmachine classification. While the crossing minimization formulation can be\nutilized in conjunction with any optimization-based embedding objective, here\nwe demonstrate the approach on multidimensional scaling by modifying the stress\nmajorization algorithm to include penalties for edge crossings. The proposed\nmethod is used to (1) solve a visualization problem in tuberculosis molecular\nepidemiology and (2) generate embeddings for a suite of randomly generated\ngraphs designed to challenge the algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate\nthe efficacy of the approach. The proposed edge-crossing constraints and\npenalty algorithm can be readily adapted to other supervised and unsupervised\noptimization-based embedding or dimensionality reduction methods.

This paper aims to provide signatures\nallowing identification of radiation from low-energy cosmic rays in X-ray\nspectra showing the 6.4 keV line.

Much more research is required on his astronomical manuscripts in\norder to obtain a better understanding of this author, the century in which he\nlived and the general state of science in the late Islamic period. After all,\ngiven the many as-yet unstudied manuscripts that still exist, maybe this\ndecline was not as rapid as has previously been assumed.\n","Comment: Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Oriental\n  Astronomy,2011.

This\nconstruction directly yields decidability of bisimilarity for pPDA, as well as\nan elementary upper bound for the bisimilarity problem on the subclass of\nprobabilistic basic process algebras, i.e., single-state pPDA. We further show\nthat, with careful analysis, the general reduction can be used to prove an\nEXPTIME upper bound for bisimilarity of probabilistic visibly pushdown\nautomata. Here we also provide a matching lower bound, establishing\nEXPTIME-completeness. Finally we prove that deciding bisimilarity of\nprobabilistic one-counter automata, another subclass of pPDA, is\nPSPACE-complete. Here we use a more specialised argument to obtain optimal\ncomplexity bounds.\n","Comment: technical report accompanying an FSTTCS'12 paper"]}]
