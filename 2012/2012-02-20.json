The answer\nleads to a new kind of deep architecture, which we call sum-product networks\n(SPNs). SPNs are directed acyclic graphs with variables as leaves, sums and\nproducts as internal nodes, and weighted edges. We show that if an SPN is\ncomplete and consistent it represents the partition function and all marginals\nof some graphical model, and give semantics to its nodes. Essentially all\ntractable graphical models can be cast as SPNs, but SPNs are also strictly more\ngeneral. We then propose learning algorithms for SPNs, based on backpropagation\nand EM. Experiments show that inference and learning with SPNs can be both\nfaster and more accurate than with standard deep networks. For example, SPNs\nperform image completion better than state-of-the-art deep networks for this\ntask. SPNs also have intriguing potential connections to the architecture of\nthe cortex.\n"]}]

Neutrino flavour oscillation is nowadays a fairly\nwell-established experimental fact. However, the formulation of flavour\noscillations in a relativistic field theoretical framework presents non-trivial\ndifficulties. A nonperturbative approach for building flavour states has been\nproposed by Blasone, Vitiello and coworkers. The formalism implies a\nnon-trivial physical vacuum (called \"flavour vacuum\"), which might act as a\nsource of Dark Energy. Furthermore, such a vacuum has been recognized as the\neffective vacuum state arising in the low energy limit of a string theoretical\nmodel, D-particle Foam Model. In the attempt of probing the observable\nphenomenology of the D-particle foam model, a simple toy model (two scalars\nwith mixing \\`a la Blasone & Vitiello on a adiabatically expanding background)\nhas been studied, proving that the flavour vacuum might behave as Dark Energy\nunder certain assumptions. The first work presented in this thesis represents a\ndevelopment of this approach. A more realistic model is considered, which\nincludes two flavoured Dirac fermions on a generic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\nuniverse. In this framework we show that the flavour vacuum presents different\nfeatures, which are incompatible with Dark Energy. Motivated by this\ndiscrepancy, we next embark on the analysis of a simple supersymmetric model in\nflat spacetime (free Wess-Zumino), proving that the bosonic component of\nflavour vacuum acts as Dark Energy, whereas the fermionic as a source of Dark\nMatter. Finally we develop a new method of calculation that open the way to a\nnonperturbative extension of these results for interactive theories.\n","Comment: PhD Thesis, King's College London, May 2011"]}]

Like HTC\napplications, by definition MTC applications are structured as graphs of\ndiscrete tasks, with explicit input and output dependencies forming the graph\nedges. However, MTC applications have significant features that distinguish\nthem from typical HTC applications. In particular, different engineering\nconstraints for hardware and software must be met in order to support these\napplications. HTC applications have traditionally run on platforms such as\ngrids and clusters, through either workflow systems or parallel programming\nsystems. MTC applications, in contrast, will often demand a short time to\nsolution, may be communication intensive or data intensive, and may comprise\nvery short tasks. Therefore, hardware and software for MTC must be engineered\nto support the additional communication and I/O and must minimize task dispatch\noverheads. The hardware of large-scale HPC systems, with its high degree of\nparallelism and support for intensive communication, is well suited for MTC\napplications. However, HPC systems often lack a dynamic resource-provisioning\nfeature, are not ideal for task communication via the file system, and have an\nI/O system that is not optimized for MTC-style applications. Hence, additional\nsoftware support is likely to be required to gain full benefit from the HPC\nhardware.\n"]}]

For Wiesner's\noriginal scheme, it is determined that the optimal probability for a\ncounterfeiter to create two copies of a bank note from one, where both copies\npass the bank's test for validity, is (3/4)^n for n being the number of qubits\nused for each note. Generalizations in which other ensembles of states are\nsubstituted for the one considered by Wiesner are also discussed, including a\nscheme recently proposed by Pastawski, Yao, Jiang, Lukin, and Cirac, as well as\nschemes based on higher dimensional quantum systems. In addition, we introduce\na variant of Wiesner's quantum money in which the verification protocol for\nbank notes involves only classical communication with the bank. We show that\nthe optimal probability with which a counterfeiter can succeed in two\nindependent verification attempts, given access to a single valid n-qubit bank\nnote, is (3/4+sqrt(2)/8)^n. We also analyze extensions of this variant to\nhigher-dimensional schemes.\n","Comment: 18 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:1104.1140"]}]

In this mechanism, ignition occurs at one or several\noff-center points, resulting in a burning bubble of hot ash that rises rapidly,\nbreaks through the surface of the star, and collides at a point opposite\nbreakout on the stellar surface. We find that detonation conditions are\nrobustly reached in our 3-D simulations for a range of initial conditions and\nresolutions. Detonation conditions are achieved as the result of an\ninwardly-directed jet that is produced by the compression of unburnt surface\nmaterial when the surface flow collides with itself. A high-velocity\noutwardly-directed jet is also produced. The initial conditions explored in\nthis paper lead to conditions at detonation that can be expected to produce\nlarge amounts of $^{56}$Ni and small amounts of intermediate mass elements.\nThese particular simulations are therefore relevant only to high luminosity\nType Ia supernovae. Recent observations of Type Ia supernovae imply a\ncompositional structure that is qualitatively consistent with that expected\nfrom these simulations.\n","Comment: Accepted by ApJ"]}]
