According to one of them, an X-shaped source is indeed\na cross whose one arm is associated with a double radio source that has changed\nits orientation in space, while the other arm is associated with relic lobes\nand its position indicates the former direction of the jets. Here, I present\ntwo new arguments in favour of this conjecture. Firstly, it is obvious that\nshortly after the repositioning, the pair of the new lobes must be very\ncompact. To illustrate such a possibility, I show an EVN image of the central\ncomponent of a triple source J1625+2712. When resolved, it appears as a compact\ndouble that is not aligned with the outer double so the whole source is indeed\nX-shaped. Secondly, I consider the situation when one of the arms of an\nX-shaped source is not intrinsically short but foreshortened by projection. I\nshow two examples of triple sources whose central component is a blazar and the\nspan of the lobes that straddle it amounts to more than 6\\times10^5 pc. An\nassumption that sources of this kind have one axis, and so the lobes are beamed\nin the same way the core is, would require unrealistically huge deprojected\nlinear sizes. Therefore, I claim that core-dominated triples (CDT) like these\ntwo have two axes: the one pertinent to the relic lobes is not pointed towards\nus so they are not beamed/foreshortened, whereas the axis pertinent to the jets\nmakes a small angle with the line of sight so that a blazar is observed. It\nfollows that X-shaped sources must be actual crosses and they are the parent\n(unbeamed) population of at least some CDT blazars, particularly those with\nlarge overall sizes.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 2 figures, Proceedings of \"Resolving The Sky - Radio\n  Interferometry: Past, Present and Future\", April 2012, Manchester, UK"]}]

This paper presents the testing of several GMPEs\nselected in current international and national probabilistic projects against\nweak motions recorded in France (191 recordings with source-site distances up\nto 300km, 3.8\\leqMw\\leq4.5). The method is based on the loglikelihood value\nproposed by Scherbaum et al. (2009). The best fitting models (approximately\n2.5\\leqLLH\\leq3.5) over the whole frequency range are the Cauzzi and Faccioli\n(2008), Akkar and Bommer (2010) and Abrahamson and Silva (2008) models. No\nsignificant regional variation of ground motions is highlighted, and the\nmagnitude scaling could be predominant in the control of ground-motion\namplitudes. Furthermore, we take advantage of a rich Japanese dataset to run\ntests on randomly selected low-magnitude subsets, and check that a dataset of\n~190 observations, same size as the French dataset, is large enough to obtain\nstable LLH estimates. Additionally we perform the tests against larger\nmagnitudes (5-7) from the Japanese dataset. The ranking of models is partially\nmodified, indicating a magnitude scaling effect for some of the models, and\nshowing that extrapolating testing results obtained from low magnitude ranges\nto higher magnitude ranges is not straightforward.\n"]}]

The classical\ndiffusion process can be viewed as a result of a random walk of particles in\nwhich every step has the same probability distribution with a finite second\nmoment. This allows applying the central limit theorem to the calculation of\nthe particle distribution after many steps. However, in moderately doped\ndirect-gap semiconductors the photon recycling process can radically modify the\nspatial spread. For this process, the steps in the random walk are defined by\nthe reabsorption length of photons produced in radiative recombination. The\nstep distribution has an asymptotic power-law decline. Moments of this\ndistribution diverge and the displacement is governed by rare but large steps.\nRandom walk of this kind is called the Levy flight. It corresponds to an\nanomalously large spread in space and a modified (\"super-diffusive\") temporal\nevolution. Here we discuss the first direct observation of the hole profile in\nn-doped InP samples over distances of the order of a centimeter and more than\ntwo orders of magnitude in hole concentration. Luminescence spectra and\nintensity were studied as a function of distance from the photo-excitation in a\nrather unusual geometry (homogeneous excitation of the wafer edge and\nobservation of the luminescence spectra from the broadside). The intensity is\nproportional to the minority-carrier concentration and exhibits a slow\npower-law drop-off with no changes in the spectral shape. This power law gives\na direct evidence of Levy-flight transport. It has enabled us to evaluate the\nindex of the distribution, the characteristic distance of the minority-carrier\nspread and the photon recycling factor.

While the events have been hailed as an\n\"Arab Spring\" by those who hope that repressive autocracies will be replaced by\ndemocracies, what sort of regimes will eventually emerge from the crisis\nremains far from certain. Here we provide a complex systems framework,\nvalidated by historical precedent, to help answer this question. We describe\nthe dynamics of governmental change as an evolutionary process similar to\nbiological evolution, in which complex organizations gradually arise by\nreplication, variation and competitive selection. Different kinds of\ngovernments, however, have differing levels of complexity. Democracies must be\nmore systemically complex than autocracies because of their need to incorporate\nlarge numbers of people in decision-making. This difference has important\nimplications for the relative robustness of democratic and autocratic\ngovernments after revolutions. Revolutions may disrupt existing evolved\ncomplexity, limiting the potential for building more complex structures\nquickly. Insofar as systemic complexity is reduced by revolution, democracy is\nharder to create in the wake of unrest than autocracy. Applying this analysis\nto the Middle East and North Africa, we infer that in the absence of stable\ninstitutions or external assistance, new governments are in danger of facing\nincreasingly insurmountable challenges and reverting to autocracy.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 1 figure"]}]

In this paper, originally published in 1979, we first describe the\ncommon solution of retrieving the information from scans made with a large\nsingle-dish telescope. However, this is not the only means by which short\nspacing visibility data can be obtained. We propose an alternative technique\nthat employs a short-baseline interferometer to scan the entire primary beam\narea. The obvious advantage is that a short-baseline pair from the synthesis\ninstrument can be used, ensuring uniformity in instrumental characteristics.\nThis technique is the basis for the mosaicing algorithms now commonly used in\naperture synthesis radio astronomy imaging.\n","Comment: 3 pages; IAU Colloquium 49 (Groningen, Netherlands, 1978): \"Image\n  Formation from Coherence Functions in Astronomy\""]}]

We investigated\nfield-dependent, gender-specific effects of the selective pressures individuals\nexperience as they pursue a career in academia within seven STEM disciplines.\nWe built a unique database that comprises 437,787 publications authored by\n4,292 faculty members at top United States research universities. Our analyses\nreveal that gender differences in publication rate and impact are\ndiscipline-specific. Our results also support two hypotheses. First, the\nwidely-reported lower publication rates of female faculty are correlated with\nthe amount of research resources typically needed in the discipline considered,\nand thus may be explained by the lower level of institutional support\nhistorically received by females. Second, in disciplines where pursuing an\nacademic position incurs greater career risk, female faculty tend to have a\ngreater fraction of higher impact publications than males.

We find, however, that even the most developed formulation of\ngravity dual Pomeron (Brower--Polchinski--Strassler--Tan (BPST) 2006) is not\nable to capture skewness dependence of GPD properly. Conformal operator product\nexpansion allows us to determine DVCS amplitude in terms of matrix elements of\nprimary operators, which should then be given by wavefunctions on warped\nspacetime.
