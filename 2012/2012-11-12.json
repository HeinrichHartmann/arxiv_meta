Since maximized field gradients are efficiently generated\nby self-steepening processes, we first present a generalized theory of optical\ncarrier-wave self-steepened (CSS) pulses. This goes beyond existing treatments,\nwhich only consider third-order nonlinearity, and has the advantage of\ndescribing pulses whose wave forms have a range of symmetry properties.\nAlthough a fertile field for theoretical work, CSS pulses are difficult to\nrealize experimentally because of the deleterious effect of dispersion. We\ntherefore consider synthesizing CSS-like profiles using a suitably phased\nsub-set of the harmonics present in a true CSS wave form. Using standard\ntheoretical models of HHG, we show that the presence of gradient-maximized\nregions on the wave forms can raise the spectral cut-off and so yield shorter\nattosecond pulses. We study how the quality of the attosecond bursts created by\nspectral filtering depends on the number of harmonics included in the driving\npulse.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 10 figures; with appendix not present in published version"]}]

It is analytically\nshown that under an applied electric field, the spin density wave gains a\ntime-dependent phase shift $\\phi(t)$. Without the spin-orbit coupling, the\nphase shift increases linearly with time and is equivalent to a normal Doppler\nshift in optical measurements. Due to the joint effect of spin-orbit coupling\nand the applied electric field, the phase shift behaviors differently at the\nearly and the later stages. At the early stage, the phase shifts are the same\nwith or without the spin-orbit coupling. While at the later stage, the phase\nshift deviates from the normal Doppler one when the spin-orbit coupling is\npresent. The crossover time from the early normal Doppler behavior to the\nanomalous one at the later stage is inversely proportional to the spin\ndiffusion coefficient, wave vector of the spin density wave and the spin-orbit\ncoupling strength. In the high temperature regime, the crossover time becomes\nlarge as a result of the decreased spin diffusion coefficient.

In the analysis of those, singular values and\nvectors did not play any role so far, for the obvious reason that these\nproblems are nonlinear, together with the issue of defining singular values and\nsingular vectors. In this paper however we want to start a study of singular\nvalues and vectors for nonlinear variational regularization of linear inverse\nproblems, with particular focus on singular one-homogeneous regularization\nfunctionals. A major role is played by the smallest singular value, which we\ndefine as the ground state of an appropriate functional combining the\n(semi-)norm introduced by the forward operator and the regularization\nfunctional. The optimality condition for the ground state further yields a\nnatural generalization to higher singular values and vectors involving the\nsubdifferential of the regularization functional. We carry over two main\nproperties from the world of linear regularization. The first one is gaining\ninformation about scale, respectively the behavior of regularization techniques\nat different scales. This also leads to novel estimates at different scales,\ngeneralizing the estimates for the coefficients in the linear singular value\nexpansion. The second one is to provide exact solutions for variational\nregularization methods. We will show that all singular vectors can be\nreconstructed up to a scalar factor by the standard Tikhonov-type\nregularization approach even in the presence of (small) noise.

In this paper, we consider finite\n(small-scale) wireless sensor networks. We first show that previous asymptotic\nresults provide poor approximations for such networks. We provide a set of\ndifferences between small-scale and large-scale analysis and propose a\nmethodology for analysis of finite sensor networks. Furthermore, we consider\ntwo models for such networks: unreliable sensor grids, and sensor networks with\nrandom node deployment. We provide easily computable expressions for bounds on\nthe coverage and connectivity of these networks. With validation from\nsimulations, we show that the derived analytic expressions give very good\nestimates of such quantities for finite sensor networks. Our investigation\nconfirms the fact that small-scale networks possesses unique characteristics\ndifferent from the large-scale counterparts, necessitating the development of a\nnew framework for their analysis and design.\n"]}]

The six major flares\noccurred near the main magnetic neutral lines of four active regions, NOAA\n11158, 11166, 11283 and 11429. During all six flares the neutral line field\nvectors became stronger and more horizontal, in each case almost entirely due\nto strengthening of the horizontal field components parallel to the neutral\nline. In all six cases the neutral line pre-flare fields were more vertical\nthan the reference potential fields, and collapsed abruptly and permanently\ncloser to potential field tilt angles during every flare, implying that the\nrelaxation of magnetic stress associated with non-potential tilt angles plays a\nmajor role during major flares. The shear angle with respect to the reference\npotential field did not show such a pattern, demonstrating that flare processes\ndo not generally relieve magnetic stresses associated with photospheric\nmagnetic shear. The horizontal fields became significantly and permanently more\naligned with the neutral line during the four largest flares, suggesting that\nthe collapsing field is on average more aligned with the neutral line than the\npre-flare neutral line field. The vertical Lorentz force had a large, abrupt,\npermanent downward change during each of the flares, consistent with loop\ncollapse. The horizontal Lorentz force changes acted mostly parallel to the\nneutral line in opposite directions on each side, a signature of the fields\ncontracting during the flare, pulling the two sides of the neutral line towards\neach other. The greater effect of the flares on field tilt than on shear may be\nexplained by photospheric line-tying.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1202.4192"]}]

An abrupt, significant, and\npersistent change in the magnetic field occurred across more than ten pixels in\nthe GONG magnetograms for each flare.
