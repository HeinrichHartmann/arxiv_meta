Expressed in these field superoperators, the causal structure\nof the perturbation theory for the effective time-evolution\nsuperoperator-kernel becomes explicit. The causal structure also implies the\nexistence of a fermion-parity protected eigenvector of the exact Liouvillian,\nexplaining a recently reported result on adiabatic driving [Phys. Rev. B 85,\n075301 (2012)] and generalizing it to arbitrary order in the tunnel coupling.\nFurthermore, in the WBL the causal representation exponentially reduces the\nnumber of diagrams for the time-evolution kernel. We perform a complete 2-loop\nRG analysis at finite voltage and magnetic field, while systematically\naccounting for the dependence on both the quantum dot and reservoir\nfrequencies. Using the second quantization in Liouville-space and symmetry\nrestrictions we obtain analytical RT-RG equations with an efficient numerical\nsolution and we extensively study the model parameter space, excluding the\nKondo regime. The incorporated renormalization effects result in an enhancement\nof the inelastic cotunneling peak.

The launch of Herschel, with an angular resolution\nsuperior to previous far-infrared telescopes, allows us to spatially resolve\nmore discs and locate the dust directly.

The thermo-mechanical\nhistory of the samples during the mixing process was monitored and adjusted to\nidentical final temperatures. The filler structure on large scales up to\nmicrometers was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and very\nsmall-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). A complete quantitative model extending\nfrom the primary silica nanoparticle (of radius \\approx 10 nm), to\nnanoparticles aggregates, up to micrometer-sized branches with typical lateral\ndimension of 150 nm is proposed. Image analysis of the TEM-pictures yields the\nfraction of zones of pure polymer, which extend between the branches of a\nlarge-scale filler network. This network is compatible with a fractal of\naverage dimension 2.4 as measured by scattering. On smaller length scales,\ninside the branches, small silica aggregates are present. Their average radius\nhas been deduced from a Kratky analysis, and it ranges between 35 and 40 nm for\nall silica fractions investigated here (\\phi_si = 8-21% vol.). A central piece\nof our analysis is the description of the interaggregate interaction by a\nsimulated structure factor for polydisperse spheres representing aggregates. A\npolydispersity of 30% in aggregate size is assumed, and interactions between\nthese aggregates are described with a hard core repulsive potential. The same\ndistribution in size is used to evaluate the polydisperse form factor.\nComparison with the experimental intensity leads to the determination of the\naverage aggregate compacity (assumed identical for all aggregates in the\ndistribution, between 31% and 38% depending on \\phi_si), and thus aggregation\nnumber (ca. 45, with a large spread). Because of the effect of aggregate\ncompacity and of pure polymer zones, the volume fraction of aggregates is\nhigher in the branches than \\phi_si. The repulsion between aggregates has a\nstrong effect on the apparent isothermal compressibility: it leads to a\ncharacteristic low-q depression, which cannot be interpreted as aggregate mass\ndecrease in our data. In addition, the reinforcement effect of these silica\nstructures in the SBR-matrix is characterized with oscillatory shear and\ndescribed with a model based on the same aggregate compacity. Finally, our\nresults show that it is possible to analyze the complex structure of\ninteracting aggregates in nanocomposites of industrial origin in a\nself-consistent and quantitative manner.\n"]}]

We aim at exploiting the hardware heterogeneity from\nthe browser without requiring any changes to either the OS or the web\napplications. Our design, Guadalupe, can use hardware processing units with\ndifferent degrees of capability for matched browser services. It starts with a\nweak hardware unit, determines if and when a strong unit is needed, and\nseamlessly migrates to the strong one when necessary. Guadalupe not only makes\nmore computing resources available to mobile web browsing but also improves its\nenergy proportionality. Based on Chrome for Android and TI OMAP4, We provide a\nprototype browser implementation for resource loading and rendering. Compared\nto Chrome for Android, we show that Guadalupe browser for rendering can\nincrease other 3D application's frame rate by up to 767% and save 4.7% of the\nentire system's energy consumption. More importantly, by using the two cases,\nwe demonstrate that Guadalupe creates the great opportunity for many browser\nservices to get better resource utilization and energy proportionality by\nexploiting hardware heterogeneity.\n"]}]

Such a feature\nis useful when the cause of a bug is close in time to the bug manifestation.\nWhen the cause is far back in time, one resorts to setting appropriate\nbreakpoints in the debugger and beginning a new debugging session. For these\ncases when the cause of a bug is far in time from its manifestation, bug\ndiagnosis requires a series of debugging sessions with which to narrow down the\ncause of the bug.\n  For such \"difficult\" bugs, this work presents an automated tool to search\nthrough the process lifetime and locate the cause. As an example, the bug could\nbe related to a program invariant failing. A binary search through the process\nlifetime suffices, since the invariant expression is true at the beginning of\nthe program execution, and false when the bug is encountered. An algorithm for\nsuch a binary search is presented within the FReD (Fast Reversible Debugger)\nsoftware. It is based on the ability to checkpoint, restart and\ndeterministically replay the multiple processes of a debugging session. It is\nbased on GDB (a debugger), DMTCP (for checkpoint-restart), and a custom\ndeterministic record-replay plugin for DMTCP.\n  FReD supports complex, real-world multithreaded programs, such as MySQL and\nFirefox. Further, the binary search is robust. It operates on multi-threaded\nprograms, and takes advantage of multi-core architectures during replay.\n"]}]
