Most of previous works in\nthe literature have mainly focused on the sparse synthesis prior where the\nsparsity is measured as the L1 norm of the coefficients that synthesize the\nsignal from a given dictionary. In contrast, the more general analysis\nregularization minimizes the L1 norm of the correlations between the signal and\nthe atoms in the dictionary, where these correlations define the analysis\nsupport. The corresponding variational problem encompasses several well-known\nregularizations such as the discrete total variation and the Fused Lasso. Our\nmain contributions consist in deriving sufficient conditions that guarantee\nexact or partial analysis support recovery of the true signal in presence of\nnoise. More precisely, we give a sufficient condition to ensure that a signal\nis the unique solution of the L1-analysis regularization in the noiseless case.\nThe same condition also guarantees exact analysis support recovery and\nL2-robustness of the L1-analysis minimizer vis-a-vis an enough small noise in\nthe measurements. This condition turns to be sharp for the robustness of the\nanalysis support. To show partial support recovery and L2-robustness to an\narbitrary bounded noise, we introduce a stronger sufficient condition. When\nspecialized to the L1-synthesis regularization, our results recover some\ncorresponding recovery and robustness guarantees previously known in the\nliterature.

Comparison of static magnetic susceptibilities and local densities\nof states of two- and three-orbital models of a complete rotationally invariant\nCoulomb interaction and a \"density-density\" Hartree type interaction shows the\ndifferent role of spin-flip interactions for different band fillings.

They are taken at juxtaposed frequencies. The\nreference image of the region is called Ground Truth map (GT). the problematic\nis how to find the good bands to classify the pixels of regions; because the\nbands can be not only redundant, but a source of confusion, and decreasing so\nthe accuracy of classification. Some methods use Mutual Information (MI) and\nthreshold, to select relevant bands. Recently there's an algorithm selection\nbased on mutual information, using bandwidth rejection and a threshold to\ncontrol and eliminate redundancy. The band top ranking the MI is selected, and\nif its neighbors have sensibly the same MI with the GT, they will be considered\nredundant and so discarded. This is the most inconvenient of this method,\nbecause this avoids the advantage of hyperspectral images: some precious\ninformation can be discarded. In this paper we'll make difference between\nuseful and useless redundancy. A band contains useful redundancy if it\ncontributes to decreasing error probability. According to this scheme, we\nintroduce new algorithm using also mutual information, but it retains only the\nbands minimizing the error probability of classification. To control\nredundancy, we introduce a complementary threshold. So the good band candidate\nmust contribute to decrease the last error probability augmented by the\nthreshold.

Quantum\nentanglement plays a fundamental role in many applications of quantum\ninformation theory, such as quantum teleportation. Stochastic local quantum\noperations and classical communication (SLOCC) cannot essentially change\nquantum entanglement without destroying it. Therefore, entanglement can be\nclassified by dividing quantum states into equivalence classes, where two\nstates are equivalent if each can be converted into the other by SLOCC.\nProperties of this classification, especially in the case of non\ntwo-dimensional quantum systems, have not been well studied. Graphical\nrepresentation is sometimes used to clarify the nature and structural features\nof entangled states.

Herein, we perform in vitro and in vivo radiosensitization studies of\n4.8, 12.1, 27.3, and 46.6 nm PEG-coated gold nanoparticles. In vitro results\nshow that all sizes of the PEG-coated gold nanoparticles can cause a\nsignificant decrease in cancer cell survival after gamma radiation. 12.1 and\n27.3 nm PEG-coated gold nanoparticles have dispersive distributions in the\ncells and have stronger sensitization effects than 4.8 and 46.6 nm particles by\nboth cell apoptosis and necrosis. Further, in vivo results also show all sizes\nof the PEG-coated gold nanoparticles can decrease tumor volume and weight after\n5 Gy radiations, and 12.1 and 27.3 nm PEG-coated gold nanoparticles have\ngreater sensitization effects than 4.8 and 46.6 nm particles, which can lead to\nalmost complete disappearance of the tumor. In vivo biodistribution confirms\nthat 12.1 and 27.3 nm PEG-coated gold nanoparticles are accumulated in the\ntumor with high concentrations. The pathology, immune response, and blood\nbiochemistry indicate that the PEG-coated gold nanoparticles do not cause\nspleen and kidney damages, but give rise to liver damage and gold accumulation.\nIt can be concluded that 12.1 and 27.3 nm PEG-coated gold nanoparticles show\nhigh radiosensitivity, and these results have an important indication for\npossible radiotherapy and drug delivery.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 9 figures"]}]

Security concerns that arise when outsourcing data and computation\nto the cloud include data confidentiality and privacy. Given that a tremendous\namount of data is being generated everyday from plethora of devices equipped\nwith sensing capabilities, we focus on the problem of access controls over live\nstreams of data based on triggers or sliding windows, which is a distinct and\nmore challenging problem than access control over archival data. Specifically,\nwe investigate secure mechanisms for outsourcing access control enforcement for\nstream data to the cloud.

The access control policies are enforced by the cloud, without the latter\nlearning about the data, while ensuring that unauthorized access is not\nfeasible. To realize these ends, we employ a novel cryptographic primitive,\nnamely proxy-based attribute-based encryption, which not only provides security\nbut also allows the cloud to perform expensive computations on behalf of the\nusers. Our approach is holistic, in that these controls are integrated with an\nXML based framework (XACML) for high-level management of policies.

It is found that the\ntheorem in the original form hides the importance of the orientation of the\nvertices in the spin networks and, more important, that the algorithm for the\nevaluation of spin networks assumes a cycle for the reduction of the graph to\nwork in the proof of the theorem. It is shown that this is not always the case\nand this rises doubt about the generality of the theorem. Having this issue in\nmind, the theorem is restated to account for toroidal spin networks, i.e.\nnetworks cellular embeddable in the torus. For this, the minimal non-planar\nspin network is examined and the algorithm is extended to account for the\nnon-planarity of toroidal spin networks. Furthermore, three types of minimal\nnon-planar spin networks are found, two of them are toroidal and the third is\ncellular embeddable only in the double torus and without a cycle. Some examples\nfor both toroidal spin networks are given and the relation between these is\nfound.
