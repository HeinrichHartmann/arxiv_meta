The\nevolution in Software architecture is always an open issue for researchers to\naddress complex systems with numerous domain-specific requirements. Success of\na system is based on quality outcome of every stage of development with proper\nmeasuring techniques. Metrics are measures of Process, Product and People (P3)\nwho are involved in the development process, acts as quality indicators\nreflecting the maturity level of the company. Several process metrics has been\ndefined and practiced to measure the software deliverables comprising of\nrequirement analysis through maintenance. Metrics at each stage has its own\nsignificance to increase the quality of the milestones and hence the quality of\nend product. This paper highlights the significance of software quality metrics\nfollowed at major phases of software development namely requirement, design and\nimplementation. This paper thereby aims to bring awareness towards existing\nmetrics and leads towards enhancement of them in order to reflect continuous\nprocess improvement in the company for their sustainability in the market.\n","Comment: 5 pages,International Conference on Innovative Computing and\n  Information Processing (ICCIP - 2012)"]}]

Methods:\nPhotometric, spectroscopic, and interferometric data were analyzed, revealing\nthe basic physical properties of the system 65 UMa. A disentangling technique\nis used to perform the spectra decomposition. This combined approach allows us\nto study the long-term period changes in the system, identifying the period\nvariation due to the motion on the visual orbit, in addition to a short-term\nmodulation. Results: We find that the system contains one more component, hence\n65 UMa is a sextuple hierarchical system. The most inner pair of components\nconsists of an eclipsing binary orbiting around a barycenter on a circular\norbit, both components being almost identical of spectral type about A7. This\npair orbits on an eccentric orbit around a barycenter, and the third component\norbits with a period of about 640 days. This motion is reflected in the period\nvariation in the minima times of the eclipsing pair, as well as in the radial\nvelocities of the primary, secondary, and tertiary components. Moreover, this\nsystem orbits around a barycenter with the distant component resolved\ninterferometrically, whose period is of about 118 years. Two more distant\ncomponents (4\" and 63\") are also probably gravitationally bound to the system.\nThe nodal period of the eclipsing-pair orbit is on the order of only a few\ncenturies, which makes this system even more interesting for a future\nprospective detection of changing the depths of minima.

Such a large equivalent width suggests that a part of the incident X-ray\nemission that irradiates the circumstellar material and/or the stellar surface\nis hidden from our line of sight. XMM-Newton spectra during the 2003-2005\noutburst did not show a strong fluorescent iron Kalpha line, so that the\nstructure of the circumstellar gas very close to the stellar core that absorbs\nand re-emits X-ray emission from the central object may have changed in between\n2005 and 2008. This phenomenon may be related to changes in the infrared\nmorphology of McNeil's nebula between 2004 and 2008.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 4 figures"]}]
