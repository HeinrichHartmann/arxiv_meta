However, a population can also adapt to a new situation by\nmultiple mutations of similar phenotypic effect that arise in parallel. These\nmutations can each quickly reach intermediate frequency, preventing any single\none from rapidly sweeping to fixation globally (a \"soft\" sweep). Here we study\nmodels of parallel mutation in a geographically spread population adapting to a\nglobal selection pressure. The slow geographic spread of a selected allele can\nallow other selected alleles to arise and spread elsewhere in the species\nrange. When these different selected alleles meet, their spread can slow\ndramatically, and so form a geographic patchwork which could be mistaken for a\nsignal of local adaptation. This random spatial tessellation will dissipate\nover time due to mixing by migration, leaving a set of partial sweeps within\nthe global population. We show that the spatial tessellation initially formed\nby mutational types is closely connected to Poisson process models of\ncrystallization, which we extend. We find that the probability of parallel\nmutation and the spatial scale on which parallel mutation occurs is captured by\na single characteristic length that reflects the expected distance a spreading\nallele travels before it encounters a different spreading allele. This\ncharacteristic length depends on the mutation rate, the dispersal parameter,\nthe effective local density of individuals, and to a much lesser extent the\nstrength of selection. We argue that even in widely dispersing species, such\nparallel geographic sweeps may be surprisingly common.

In order to\ncalculate Curie and N\\'{e}el temperatures we derive an effective Heisenberg\nmodel for a vector which describes the local orientation of the total\nmagnetization of the system. The exchange constants of this model are different\nfor different space directions and depend on the density of $e_g$ electrons,\nantiferromagnetic constants and the Jahn-Teller energy. To reproduce the well\nknown phase transitions from A-type antiferromagnetism to ferromagnetism at low\n$x$ and C-type antiferromagnetism to G-type antiferromagnetism at large $x$, we\nargue that the antiferromagnetic exchange constants should depend on the\nlattice direction. We show that ferromagnetic to A-type antiferromagnetic\ntransition results from the Jahn-Teller distortion. Accounting adequately for\nthe magnon-magnon interaction, Curie and N\\'{e}el temperatures are calculated.\nThe results are in very good agreement with the experiment and provide values\nfor the model parameters, which best describe the behavior of the critical\ntemperature for $x<0.5$.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 5 figures"]}]

In this class of\nmodels, actions are taken at encoders or decoders, either to acquire side\ninformation in an efficient way or to control or probe effectively the channel\nstate. In this paper, the problem of embedding information on the actions is\nstudied for both the source and the channel coding set-ups. In both cases, a\ndecoder is present that observes only a function of the actions taken by an\nencoder or a decoder of an action-dependent point-to-point link. For the source\ncoding model, this decoder wishes to reconstruct a lossy version of the source\nbeing transmitted over the point-to-point link, while for the channel coding\nproblem the decoder wishes to retrieve a portion of the message conveyed over\nthe link. For the problem of source coding with actions taken at the decoder, a\nsingle letter characterization of the set of all achievable tuples of rate,\ndistortions at the two decoders and action cost is derived, under the\nassumption that the mentioned decoder observes a function of the actions\nnon-causally, strictly causally or causally.

Recent\nwork focuses on the class of linear queries, which include basic counting\nqueries, data cubes, and contingency tables.

Most\nresults follow a common template: pick a \"strategy\" set of linear queries to\napply to the data, then use the noisy answers to these queries to reconstruct\nthe queries of interest. This entails either picking a strategy set that is\nhoped to be good for the queries, or performing a costly search over the space\nof all possible strategies.\n  In this paper, we propose a new approach that balances accuracy and\nefficiency: we show how to improve the accuracy of a given query set by\nanswering some strategy queries more accurately than others. This leads to an\nefficient optimal noise allocation for many popular strategies, including\nwavelets, hierarchies, Fourier coefficients and more. For the important case of\nmarginal queries we show that this strictly improves on previous methods, both\nanalytically and empirically.
