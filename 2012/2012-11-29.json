In this paper we present a numerical experiment where two time decaying\nisotropic fields of kinetic energies $E_1$ and $E_2$ initially match over a\nnarrow region. Within this region the kinetic energy varies as a hyperbolic\ntangent. The following temporal evolution produces a shearless mixing. The\nanisotropy and intermittency of velocity and velocity derivative statistics is\nobserved. In particular the asymptotic behavior in time and as a function of\nthe energy ratio $E_1/E_2 \\to \\infty$ is discussed. This limit corresponds to\nthe maximum observable turbulent energy gradient for a given $E_1$ and is\nobtained through the limit $E_2 \\to 0$. A field with $E_1/E_2 \\to \\infty$\nrepresents a mixing which could be observed near a surface subject to a very\nsmall velocity gradient separating two turbulent fields, one of which is nearly\nquiescent. In this condition the turbulent penetration is maximum and reaches a\nvalue equal to 1.2 times the nominal mixing layer width. The experiment shows\nthat the presence of a turbulent energy gradient is sufficient for the\nappearance of intermittency and that during the mixing process the pressure\ntransport is not negligible with respect to the turbulent velocity transport.\nThese findings may open the way to the hypothesis that the presence of a\ngradient of turbulent energy is the minimal requirement for Gaussian departure\nin turbulence.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 10 figures, To appear in Physical Review E"]}]

Tan's\ncontact, C, is proportional to the derivative of the energy with respect to the\ninteraction strength, and is thus an essential thermodynamic quantity for a gas\nwith short-range correlations. Theoretical predictions for the temperature\ndependence of C differ substantially, especially near the superfluid\ntransition, Tc, where C is predicted to either sharply decrease, sharply\nincrease, or change very little. For T/T_F>0.4, our measurements of the\nhomogeneous gas contact show a gradual decrease of C with increasing\ntemperature, as predicted by theory. We observe a sharp decrease in C at\nT/T_F=0.16, which may be due to the superfluid phase transition. While a sharp\ndecrease in C below Tc is predicted by some many-body theories, we find that\nnone of the predictions fully accounts for the data.\n","Comment: 5 pages, including a supplementary material section (10 pages).\n  Rewriting of the introduction and discussion sections"]}]

Using the large sample of dwarf stars with proper motions and\nspectroscopically determined stellar parameters, metallicity gradients in the\nradial direction for various heights above the Galactic plane and in the\nvertical direction for various radial distances from the Galaxy center have\nbeen found. In particular, we find a vertical metallicity gradient of -0.113\n+/- 0.010 (-0.125 +/- 0.008) dex/kpc using an isochrone (photometric) distance\ndetermination in the range 1 < |Z| < 3 kpc, which is the vertical height range\nmost consistent with the thick disk of our Galaxy. In the radial direction, we\nfind metallicity gradients between +0.02 and +0.03 dex/kpc for bins in the\nvertical direction between 1 < |Z| < 3 kpc. Both of these results agree with\nsimilar values determined from other populations of stars, but this is the\nfirst time a radial metallicity gradient for the thick disk has been found at\nthese vertical heights. We are also able to separate thin and thick disk stars\nbased on kinematic and spatial probabilities in the vertical height range where\nthere is significant overlap of these two populations. This should aid further\nstudies of the metallicity gradients of the disk for vertical heights lower\nthan those studied here but above the solar neighborhood. Metallicity gradients\nin the thin and thick disks are important probes into possible formation\nscenarios for our Galaxy and a consistent picture is beginning to emerge from\nresults using large spectroscopic surveys, such as the ones presented here.\n","Comment: 8 figures, 5 tables, accepted to AJ"]}]

Such a situation usually concerns large eddy\nsimulation of nonhomogeneous turbulent flows. The noncommutation of the average\nand differentiation operations leads to nonhomogeneous terms in the motion\nequations, that act as source terms of intensity which depend on the gradient\nof the filter scale and which, if neglected, induce a systematic error\nthroughout the solution. Here the different noncommutation terms of the motion\nequation are determined as functions of the \\delta-gradient and of the\n\\delta-derivatives of the filtered variables. It is shown here that\napproximated noncommutation terms of the fourth order of accuracy, with respect\nto the filtering scale, can be obtained using series expansions in the filter\nwidth of approximations based on finite differences and introducing successive\nlevels of filtering, which makes it suitable to use in conjunction with dynamic\nor mixed subgrid models.

We assume that each node makes Compressive Sensing (CS)\nbased measurements via random projections regarding the same sparse signal. We\npropose a distributed greedy algorithm based on Orthogonal Matching Pursuit\n(OMP), in which the sparse support is estimated iteratively while fusing\nindices estimated at distributed nodes. In the proposed distributed framework,\neach node has to perform less number of iterations of OMP compared to the\nsparsity index of the sparse signal. Thus, with each node having a very small\nnumber of compressive measurements, a significant performance gain in support\nrecovery is achieved via the proposed collaborative scheme compared to the case\nwhere each node estimates the sparsity pattern independently and then fusion is\nperformed to get a global estimate. We further extend the algorithm to estimate\nthe sparsity pattern in a binary hypothesis testing framework, where the\nalgorithm first detects the presence of a sparse signal collaborating among\nnodes with a fewer number of iterations of OMP and then increases the number of\niterations to estimate the sparsity pattern only if the signal is detected.\n"]}]

At the same time, it can be argued that singularities and boundaries\nare an important aspect of the geometry of realistic data.\n  In this paper we consider the behavior of graph Laplacians at points at or\nnear boundaries and two main types of other singularities: intersections, where\ndifferent manifolds come together and sharp \"edges\", where a manifold sharply\nchanges direction. We show that the behavior of graph Laplacian near these\nsingularities is quite different from that in the interior of the manifolds. In\nfact, a phenomenon somewhat reminiscent of the Gibbs effect in the analysis of\nFourier series, can be observed in the behavior of graph Laplacian near such\npoints. Unlike in the interior of the domain, where graph Laplacian converges\nto the Laplace-Beltrami operator, near singularities graph Laplacian tends to a\nfirst-order differential operator, which exhibits different scaling behavior as\na function of the kernel width. One important implication is that while points\nnear the singularities occupy only a small part of the total volume, the\ndifference in scaling results in a disproportionately large contribution to the\ntotal behavior. Another significant finding is that while the scaling behavior\nof the operator is the same near different types of singularities, they are\nvery distinct at a more refined level of analysis.\n  We believe that a comprehensive understanding of these structures in addition\nto the standard case of a smooth manifold can take us a long way toward better\nmethods for analysis of complex non-linear data and can lead to significant\nprogress in algorithm design.\n"]}]

The unity resolutions in terms of the projectors $| \\alpha, h> < \\alpha,\nh^{-1}| ,| \\alpha, h^{-1}> < \\alpha, h| $ are presented together with a measure\nallowing a resolution in terms of $| \\alpha, h> < \\alpha, h| $. $D_{h}(\\alpha)\n$ is also used for introducing the probability distribution funtion\n$\\rho_{A,h}(z) $ while the existence of a measure is exploited for extending\nthe P-representation to these states.

In addition this prevents the\nexistence of a measure including normalizable states only. This difficulty is\novercome by introducing a family of deformations which are rational functions\nof n, each of them admitting a measure.
