To assess the\nfilters' performance, we use an image quality index that accounts for\ncorrelation loss, luminance and contrast distortion.

Our hypothesis is that an internal\nskeleton may have evolved from a bilaterally symmetric ancestor with an\nexternal skeleton. By growing the organism inside-out an external skeleton\nbecomes an internal skeleton. Our hypothesis is supported by a computational\ntheory of bilateral symmetry that allows us to model and simulate this process.\nInside-out development is achieved by an orientation switch. Given the\ndevelopment of two bilateral founder cells that generate a bilateral organism,\na mutation that reverses the internal mirror orientation of those bilateral\nfounder cells leads to inside-out development. The new orientation is\nepigenetically inherited by all progeny. A key insight is that each cell\ncontained in the newly evolved organism with the internal skeleton develops\naccording to the very same downstream developmental control network that\ndirects the development of its exoskeletal ancestor. The networks and their\ngenomes are are identical, but the interpretation is different because of the\ncell's inverted orientation. The result is inside-out bilateral symmetric\ndevelopment generating an inside-out organism with an internal skeleton.\n","Comment: 9 pages.

The spatial layout of\nlight field is obtained via dynamical model based on Maxwell-Bloch equations\nfor class-B laser, discrete Fox-Lee map with relaxation of inversion and static\nmodel based on superposition of copropagating Gaussian beams. The spatial\npatterns observed experimentally and obtained numerically are interpreted as\nnonlinear superposition of vortices with helicoidal phase dislocations. The\nusage of vortex labyrinths and Talbot lattices as optical dipole traps for\nneutral atoms is considered for the wavelength of trapping radiation in the\nrange 0.98 $\\div$ 2.79 $\\mu m$. The separable optical trapping potential is\nmounted as a sum of array of vortex lines and additional parabolic subtrap. The\nfactorization of macroscopic wavefunction have led to analytical solution of\nGross-Pitaevski equation for ground state of ensemble of quantum particles\ntrapped in vortex labyrinth and in spatially - periodic array of Gaussian\nbeams.\n","Comment: 10 pages 7 figures"]}]

It simply calls something else \"spacetime\", and this\nsomething else has different properties. All statements of special relativity\nabout those features of reality that correspond to the original meaning of the\nterms \"space\" and \"time\" are identical with the corresponding traditional\npre-relativistic statements. It will be also argued that special relativity and\nLorentz theory are completely identical in both senses, as theories about\nspacetime and as theories about the behavior of moving physical objects.\n","Comment: 26 pages, LaTeX, new passages added"]}]
