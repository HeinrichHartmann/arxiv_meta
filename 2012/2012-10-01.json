Our motivation stems from the observation that most\nalgorithms proposed for online convex optimization require a projection onto\nthe convex set $\\mathcal{K}$ from which the decisions are made. While for\nsimple shapes (e.g. Euclidean ball) the projection is straightforward, for\narbitrary complex sets this is the main computational challenge and may be\ninefficient in practice. In this paper, we consider an alternative online\nconvex optimization problem. Instead of requiring decisions belong to\n$\\mathcal{K}$ for all rounds, we only require that the constraints which define\nthe set $\\mathcal{K}$ be satisfied in the long run. We show that our framework\ncan be utilized to solve a relaxed version of online learning with side\nconstraints addressed in \\cite{DBLP:conf/colt/MannorT06} and\n\\cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/KvetonYTM08}.

Then we\nmodify the algorithm in order to guarantee that the constraints are satisfied\nin the long run. This gain is achieved at the price of getting\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{3/4})$ regret bound. Our second algorithm is based on\nthe Mirror Prox method \\citep{nemirovski-2005-prox} to solve variational\ninequalities which achieves $\\tilde{\\mathcal{\\mathcal{O}}}(T^{2/3})$ bound for\nboth regret and the violation of constraints when the domain $\\K$ can be\ndescribed by a finite number of linear constraints.

I find that MOND predicts correctly\nthe measured dynamical mass runs (apart from a possible minor tension in the\ninner few kpc of NGC 720, which might be due to departure from hydrostatic\nequilibrium): The predicted mass discrepancy increases outward from none, near\nthe center, to ~10 at the outermost radii.

One approach works directly with the time domain data, and\nthe other works with a specially constructed Fourier transform of the data. The\nraw data was run through TEMPO2 to produce reduced timing residuals for the\nanalysis.

The\nmodel parameters include the gravitational wave amplitude and spectral slope,\nand the white noise amplitude for each pulsar in the array.

This added an additional amplitude\nand slope parameter for each pulsar, so my overall model for the 36 pulsars\nresiduals has 110 parameters.

This new technique is based on the practical variants of the two\nconstructive versions of the Regularity Lemma, a very useful tool in graph\ntheory. The lemma claims that every graph can be partitioned into pseudo-random\ngraphs. While the Regularity Lemma has become very important in proving\ntheoretical results, it has no direct practical applications so far. An\nimportant reason for this lack of practical applications is that the graph\nunder consideration has to be astronomically large. This requirement makes its\napplication restrictive in practice where graphs typically are much smaller. In\nthis paper we propose modifications of the constructive versions of the\nRegularity Lemma that work for smaller graphs as well. We call this the\nPractical Regularity partitioning algorithm. The partition obtained by this is\nused to build the reduced graph which can be viewed as a compressed\nrepresentation of the original graph.

Modeling results supported\nthis theory: the ON cell latency trend was found when the distance-to-threshold\nshifted with contrast, but not when distance-to-threshold was fixed across\ncontrasts. In the model, latency also increases as surround-to-center ratios\nincrease, which has been shown to occur at higher contrasts.
