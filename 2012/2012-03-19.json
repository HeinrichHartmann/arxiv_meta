A sample of 170 spectroscopically identified BLAGN\nand QSOs have been used together with a library of templates (including SEDs\nfrom AGN, normal, starburst galaxies and stars) in order to fit the 23\nphotometric data points provided by ALHAMBRA in the optical and NIR (20\nmedium-band optical filters plus the standard JHKs). We find that the ALHAMBRA\nphotometry is able to provide an accurate photo-z and spectral classification\nfor ~88% of the spectroscopic sources over 2.5 deg^2 in different areas of the\nsurvey, all of them brighter than m678=23.5 (equivalent to r(SLOAN)~24.0). The\nderived photo-z accuracy is better than 1% and comparable to the most recent\nresults in other cosmological fields. The fraction of outliers (~12%) is mainly\ncaused by the larger photometric errors for the faintest sources and the\nintrinsic variability of the BLAGN/QSO population.

The NIR importance is expected to increase at\nhigher redshifts (z>4).

It somehow makes a bridge between viscosity\nsolutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and Mather invariant sets of\nHamiltonian systems, although this was fully understood only a posteriori.\nThese theories converge under the hypothesis of convexity, and the richness of\napplications mostly comes from this remarkable convergence. In the present\ncourse, we provide an elementary exposition of some of the basic concepts of\nweak KAM theory. In a companion lecture, Albert Fathi exposes the aspects of\nhis theory which are more directly related to viscosity solutions. Here on the\ncontrary, we focus on dynamical applications, even if we also discuss some\nviscosity aspects to underline the connections with Fathi's lecture. The\nfundamental reference on Weak KAM theory is the still unpublished book of\nAlbert Fathi \\textit{Weak KAM theorem in Lagrangian dynamics}. Although we do\nnot offer new results, our exposition is original in several aspects. We only\nwork with the Hamiltonian and do not rely on the Lagrangian, even if some\nproofs are directly inspired from the classical Lagrangian proofs. This\napproach is made easier by the choice of a somewhat specific setting. We work\non $\\Rm^d$ and make uniform hypotheses on the Hamiltonian. This allows us to\nreplace some compactness arguments by explicit estimates. For the most\ninteresting dynamical applications however, the compactness of the\nconfiguration space remains a useful hypothesis and we retrieve it by\nconsidering periodic (in space) Hamiltonians. Our exposition is centered on the\nCauchy problem for the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and the Lax-Oleinik evolution\noperators associated to it. Dynamical applications are reached by considering\nfixed points of these evolution operators, the Weak KAM solutions. The\nevolution operators can also be used for their regularizing properties, this\nopens a second way to dynamical applications.\n","Comment: Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Section: A Mathematics\n  (2012) to appear"]}]

To define the Weyl-Nikol'skii class, we use the\nconcept of a $(\\lambda,\\beta)$-derivative, which is a generalization of the\nderivative in the sense of Weyl.

The traffic in the network is controlled by a set of traffic\nlights which can be operated both in fixed-time and a traffic responsive\nmanner. Vehicular dynamics is simulated and the total delay experienced by the\ntraffic is evaluated within specified time intervals. We investigate both\ndecentralized and centralized traffic responsive schemes and in particular\ndiscuss the implementation of the {\\it green-wave} strategy. Our investigations\nprove that the network delay strongly depends on the signalisation strategy. We\nshow that in some traffic conditions, the application of the green-wave scheme\nmay destructively lead to the increment of the global delay.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 10 eps figures, Revtex"]}]
