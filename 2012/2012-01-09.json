The OCR problem is challenging,\nand so the output of OCR often contains errors. In turn, queries on the output\nof OCR may fail to retrieve relevant answers. State-of-the-art OCR programs,\ne.g., the OCR powering Google Books, use a probabilistic model that captures\nmany alternatives during the OCR process. Only when the results of OCR are\nstored in the database, do these approaches discard the uncertainty.

Perturbations in the relative number\ndensities of baryons and dark matter, however, are surprisingly poorly\nconstrained.

These compensated isocurvature perturbations\n(CIPs) leave no imprint on the CMB at observable scales, at linear order in\ntheir amplitude.

The presence of a black hole depresses\nthe entropy of the cosmological horizon by an amount proportional to the\ngeometric mean of the entropies of the black hole and cosmological horizons. As\nthe black hole evaporates and loses its mass in the process, the total entropy\nincreases obeying the second law of thermodynamics.

The FITS file structure outlined here is independent of the specific\ndata compression algorithm that is used. The implementation details for 4\nwidely used compression algorithms are described here, but any other\ncompression technique could also be supported by this convention. The general\nprinciple used in this convention is to first divide the n-dimensional image\ninto a rectangular grid of subimages or 'tiles'. Each tile is then compressed\nas a block of data, and the resulting compressed byte stream is stored in a row\nof a variable length column in a FITS binary table. By dividing the image into\ntiles it is generally possible to extract and uncompress subsections of the\nimage without having to uncompress the whole image.\n","Comment: Registered FITS Convention:\n  http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/registry/tilecompression.html, v2.2, 4 May 2011, 17\n  pages"]}]

The tunneling\nprobability depends on the properties of the noise, e.g. the direction, the\namplitude, and the relaxation time of the autocorrelation function. We\ninvestigate the tunneling process in the presence of noise by solving the\ntime-dependent Schr$\\rm{\\ddot{o}}$dinger equation numerically, and analyze its\nparameter dependence. We estimate the effective tunneling gap making use of the\nLandau-Zener-St$\\rm{\\ddot{u}}$ckelberg (LZS) formula. The dependence of the gap\non the sweeping velocity reproduces the corresponding experimental data\nqualitatively. For fast sweeping field the estimated gap has no velocity\ndependence and this gap seems to give the true gap. We, however, show that a\ncorrection for the estimated energy gap is necessary and we propose an\ncorrection formula.\n","Comment: 13pages,11figures"]}]
