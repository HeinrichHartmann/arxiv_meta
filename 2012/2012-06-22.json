We\nshow that such a delay can arise even in bright quasars for purely dynamical\nreasons. If some large-scale process produces rapid inflow, smaller scales will\nquickly become gas-dominated. As the gas density peaks, so does the SFR.\nHowever, gravitational torques which govern further inflow are relatively\ninefficient in gas-dominated systems; as more gas is turned into stars, the\nstars provide an efficient angular momentum sink allowing more rapid inflow.\nMoreover, the gas provided to the central regions in mergers or strong disk\ninstabilities will typically be ~100 times larger than that needed to fuel the\nBH; the system is effectively in the 'infinite gas supply' limit.

Moreover, quantum\nfluctuations are normally dominated by classical noise, and are usually further\nobstructed by various accompanying effects such as a detector backaction. In\npresent work, we demonstrate that these difficulties can be bypassed by\nperforming the cross-correlation measurements. We propose to use a pair of\ntwo-level detectors, weakly coupled to a collective mode of an electric\ncircuit. Fluctuations of the current source accumulated in the collective mode\ninduce stochastic transitions in the detectors. These transitions are then read\noff by quantum point contact (QPC) electrometers and translated into two\ntelegraph processes in the QPC currents. Since both detectors interact with the\nsame collective mode, this leads to a certain fraction of the correlated\ntransitions. These correlated transitions are fingerprinted in the\ncross-correlations of the telegraph processes, which can be detected at zero\nfrequency, i.e., with a long time measurements. Concerning the dependance of\nthe cross-correlator on the detectors' energy splittings, the most interesting\nregion is at the degeneracy points, where it exhibits a sharp non-local\nresonance, that stems from higher order processes. We find that at certain\nconditions the main contribution to this resonance comes from the quantum\nnoise.

A general ADC is modeled as\na causal, discrete-time dynamical system with outputs taking values in a finite\nset. We define the performance of an ADC as the worst-case average intensity of\nthe filtered input matching error, defined as the difference between the input\nand output of the ADC. The passband of the shaping filter used to filter the\nerror signal determines the frequency region of interest for minimizing the\nerror. The problem of finding a lower bound for the performance of an ADC is\nformulated as a dynamic game problem in which the input signal to the ADC plays\nagainst the output of the ADC. Furthermore, the performance measure must be\noptimized in the presence of quantized disturbances (output of the ADC) that\ncan exceed the control variable (input of the ADC) in magnitude. We\ncharacterize the optimal solution in terms of a Bellman-type inequality. A\nnumerical approach is presented to compute the value function in parallel with\nthe feedback law for generating the worst case input signal. The specific\nstructure of the problem is used to prove certain properties of the value\nfunction that simplifies the iterative computation of a certified solution to\nthe Bellman inequality. The solution provides a certified lower bound on the\nperformance of any ADC with respect to the selected performance criteria.\n"]}]

This problem has been extensively studied in\nthe context of individual sequence prediction, where no prior assumptions are\nmade on the origin of the sequence. Individual sequence prediction algorithms\nwork quite well for long sequences, where the algorithm has enough time to\nlearn the temporal structure of the sequence. However, they might give poor\npredictions for short sequences. A possible remedy is to rely on the general\nmodel of prediction with expert advice, where the learner has access to a set\nof $r$ experts, each of which makes its own predictions on the sequence. It is\nwell known that it is possible to predict almost as well as the best expert if\nthe sequence length is order of $\\log(r)$. But, without firm prior knowledge on\nthe problem, it is not clear how to choose a small set of {\\em good} experts.\nIn this paper we describe and analyze a new algorithm that learns a good set of\nexperts using a training set of previously observed sequences. We demonstrate\nthe merits of our approach by applying it on the task of click prediction on\nthe web.\n","Comment: ICML2012"]}]

In many applications, identifying new\ninformative features is the primary pathway for improving performance. However,\nevaluating every potential feature by re-training the predictor with it can be\ncostly. The paper describes an efficient, learner-independent technique for\nestimating new feature utility without re-training based on the current\npredictor's outputs. The method is obtained by deriving a connection between\nloss reduction potential and the new feature's correlation with the loss\ngradient of the current predictor. This leads to a simple yet powerful\nhypothesis testing procedure, for which we prove consistency. Our theoretical\nanalysis is accompanied by empirical evaluation on standard benchmarks and a\nlarge-scale industrial dataset.\n","Comment: ICML2012"]}]

But each one\nwill deal with the multilingualism with a different approach. One supposes the\nontology is monolingual, whereas the other considers it multilingual. To show\nthe feasibility and the importance of our work, we implemented it on a domain\nthat attracts nowadays a lot of attention from the data mining community: the\nbiomedical domain. The selected documents are from the biomedical benchmark\ncorpus Ohsumed, and the associated ontology is the thesaurus MeSH (Medical\nSubject Headings). The main idea in our work is a new document representation,\nthe masterpiece of all good classification, based on concept.

We first develop general results for what\nwe call CFTP times with ambiguities. These are analogous to classical coupling\n(from the past) times, except that the coupling property holds only provided\nthat some ambiguities concerning the stochastic evolution of the system are\nresolved. If these ambiguities are rare enough on average, CFTP times with\nambiguities can be used to build actual CFTP times, whose properties can be\ncontrolled in terms of those of the original CFTP time with ambiguities. We\nthen prove a general perturbation result, which can be stated informally as\nfollows. Start with an interacting particle system possessing a CFTP time whose\ndefinition involves the exploration of an exponentially integrable number of\npoints in the graphical construction, and which satisfies the positive rates\nproperty. Then consider a perturbation obtained by adding new transitions to\nthe original dynamics. Our result states that, provided that the perturbation\nis small enough (in the sense of small enough rates), the perturbed interacting\nparticle system too possesses a CFTP time (with nice properties such as an\nexponentially decaying tail). The proof consists in defining a CFTP time with\nambiguities for the perturbed dynamics, from the CFTP time for the unperturbed\ndynamics. Finally, we discuss examples of particle systems to which this result\ncan be applied.
