Our analysis of the magneto-transport data indicates that in LiFeP the\nelectron carriers with lighter masses exhibit stronger temperature dependence\nof inelastic scattering rate than the holes, which is the opposite to the\nLiFeAs case. This stark difference in the band-dependent inelastic scattering\nmay be relevant to the recently reported contrasting superconducting gap\nstructures in these two superconductors.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures, 1 table"]}]

For this aim, we obtain the density and temperature structure in\nthe disk with a 1+1D radiative transfer and determine the distribution of water\nice particles in the disk by the balance between condensation, sublimation, and\nphotodesorption. We find that photodesorption induced by the far-ultraviolet\nradiation from the central star depresses the ice-condensation front toward the\nmid-plane and pushes the surface snow line outward significantly when the\nstellar effective temperature exceeds a certain critical value. This critical\neffective temperature depends on the stellar luminosity and mass, the water\nabundance in the disk, and the yield of photodesorption. We present an\napproximate analytic formula for the critical temperature. We separate Herbig\nAe/Be stars into two groups on the HR diagram according to the critical\ntemperature; one is the disks where photodesorption is effective and from which\nwe may not find ice particles at the surface, and the other is the disks where\nphotodesorption is not effective. We estimate the snow line position at the\nsurface of the disk around HD142527 to be 100--300 AU which is consistent with\nthe water ice detection at >140 AU in the disk.

Such a formulation does\nnot fully capture the goal of the allocation, which is to minimize the traffic\nbetween registers and memory. Linear scan has been proposed as an alternative\nto graph coloring, but in essence, it can be viewed as a greedy algorithm for\ngraph coloring: coloring the vertices not in the order of their degrees, but in\nthe order of their occurence in the program. Thus it suffers from almost the\nsame constraints as graph coloring.

It is manifest through the replacement of classical\nobservables by CS quantum observables, which acts on a Hilbert space of\nprescribed dimension $N$. The algebra of CS quantum observables has the finite\ndimension $N^2$. The application to the 2-sphere provides a family of\ninequivalent CS quantizations, based on the spin spherical harmonics (the CS\nquantization from usual spherical harmonics appears to give a trivial issue for\nthe cartesian coordinates). We compare these CS quantizations to the usual\n(Madore) construction of the fuzzy sphere. The difference allows us to consider\nour procedures as the constructions of new type of fuzzy spheres. The very\ngeneral character of our method suggests applications to construct fuzzy\nversions of a variety of sets.\n","Comment: 20 pages"]}]
