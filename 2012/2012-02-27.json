For this aim, we obtain the density and temperature structure in\nthe disk with a 1+1D radiative transfer and determine the distribution of water\nice particles in the disk by the balance between condensation, sublimation, and\nphotodesorption. We find that photodesorption induced by the far-ultraviolet\nradiation from the central star depresses the ice-condensation front toward the\nmid-plane and pushes the surface snow line outward significantly when the\nstellar effective temperature exceeds a certain critical value. This critical\neffective temperature depends on the stellar luminosity and mass, the water\nabundance in the disk, and the yield of photodesorption. We present an\napproximate analytic formula for the critical temperature. We separate Herbig\nAe/Be stars into two groups on the HR diagram according to the critical\ntemperature; one is the disks where photodesorption is effective and from which\nwe may not find ice particles at the surface, and the other is the disks where\nphotodesorption is not effective. We estimate the snow line position at the\nsurface of the disk around HD142527 to be 100--300 AU which is consistent with\nthe water ice detection at >140 AU in the disk.

Such a formulation does\nnot fully capture the goal of the allocation, which is to minimize the traffic\nbetween registers and memory. Linear scan has been proposed as an alternative\nto graph coloring, but in essence, it can be viewed as a greedy algorithm for\ngraph coloring: coloring the vertices not in the order of their degrees, but in\nthe order of their occurence in the program. Thus it suffers from almost the\nsame constraints as graph coloring.

Static cache replacement relaxes the\nassumptions made by graph coloring and linear scan, aiming directly at reducing\nregister-memory traffic. The method explores a much larger solution space than\nthat of graph coloring and linear scan, thus providing more opportunities of\noptimization.
