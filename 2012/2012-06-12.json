The dynamics of those systems can be formulated\nwithin the unifying framework of evolutionary game theory. However it is not a\npriori clear which mathematical description is appropriate when populations are\nnot infinitely large. Whereas the replicator equation approach describes the\ninfinite population size limit by deterministic differential equations, in\nfinite populations the dynamics is inherently stochastic which can lead to new\neffects. Recently, an explicit mean-field description in the form of a\nFokker-Planck equation was derived for frequency-dependent selection in finite\npopulations based on microscopic processes. In asymmetric conflicts between two\npopulations with a cyclic dominance, a finite-size dependent drift reversal was\ndemonstrated, depending on the underlying microscopic process of the\nevolutionary update. Cyclic dynamics appears widely in biological coevolution,\nbe it within a homogeneous population, or be it between disjunct populations as\nfemale and male. Here explicit analytic address is given and the average drift\nis calculated for the frequency-dependent Moran process and for different\npairwise comparison processes. It is explicitely shown that the drift reversal\ncannot occur if the process relies on payoff differences between pairs of\nindividuals. Further, also a linear comparison with the average payoff does not\nlead to a drift towards the internal fixed point. Hence the nonlinear\ncomparison function of the frequency-dependent Moran process, together with its\nusage of nonlocal information via the average payoff, is the essential part of\nthe mechanism.\n","Comment: 9 pages, color online figs on p.3+4"]}]

We find that the likelihood of having a bar, or bulge, in disc\ngalaxies increases when the galaxies have redder (optical) colours and larger\nstellar masses, and observe a transition in the bar and bulge likelihoods, such\nthat massive disc galaxies are more likely to host bars and bulges. We use\ngalaxy clustering methods to demonstrate statistically significant\nenvironmental correlations of barred, and bulge-dominated, galaxies, from\nprojected separations of 150 kpc/h to 3 Mpc/h. These environmental correlations\nappear to be independent of each other: i.e., bulge-dominated disc galaxies\nexhibit a significant bar-environment correlation, and barred disc galaxies\nshow a bulge-environment correlation. We demonstrate that approximately half\n(50 +/- 10%) of the bar-environment correlation can be explained by the fact\nthat more massive dark matter haloes host redder disc galaxies, which are then\nmore likely to have bars. Likewise, we show that the environmental dependence\nof stellar mass can only explain a small fraction (25 +/- 10%) of the\nbar-environment correlation. Therefore, a significant fraction of our observed\nenvironmental dependence of barred galaxies is not due to colour or stellar\nmass dependences, and hence could be due to another galaxy property. Finally,\nby analyzing the projected clustering of barred and unbarred disc galaxies with\nhalo occupation models, we argue that barred galaxies are in slightly\nhigher-mass haloes than unbarred ones, and some of them (approximately 25%) are\nsatellite galaxies in groups.

We address the EE optimization problem for MIMO-BC in this\npaper and consider a practical power model, i.e., taking into account a\ntransmit independent power which is related to the number of active transmit\nantennas. Under this setup, we propose a new optimization approach, in which\nthe transmit covariance is optimized under fixed active transmit antenna sets,\nand then active transmit antenna selection (ATAS) is utilized. During the\ntransmit covariance optimization, we propose a globally optimal energy\nefficient iterative water-filling scheme through solving a series of concave\nfractional programs based on the block-coordinate ascent algorithm. After that,\nATAS is employed to determine the active transmit antenna set. Since activating\nmore transmit antennas can achieve higher sum-rate but at the cost of larger\ntransmit independent power consumption, there exists a tradeoff between the\nsum-rate gain and the power consumption. Here ATAS can exploit the best\ntradeoff and thus further improve the EE. Optimal exhaustive search and\nlow-complexity norm based ATAS schemes are developed.

For properties that rely on particles near the outer edge of the\nsubhalo the agreement is at around the 20 per cent level. We find that basic\nproperties (mass, maximum circular velocity) of a subhalo can be reliably\nrecovered if the subhalo contains more than 100 particles although its presence\ncan be reliably inferred for a lower particle number limit of 20. We finally\nnote that the logarithmic slope of the subhalo cumulative number count is\nremarkably consistent and <1 for all the finders that reached high resolution.\nIf correct, this would indicate that the larger and more massive, respectively,\nsubstructures are the most dynamically interesting and that higher levels of\nthe (sub-)subhalo hierarchy become progressively less important.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables, Accepted for MNRAS"]}]

In our\nopinion, the frequency, phase and amplitude modulation during the mixing of\nwaves, which characterize the Kitchin, Juglar, Kuznets, Kondratiev economic\ncycles, may result in origination of strong nonlinear dynamics in financial\nsystem, accompanied by chaos- induced phenomena. These nonlinear effects have\nto be taken to the account, when adding the liquidity to the financial system\nin small quantas in series over time period during the Quantitative Easing\npolicy execution by central banks.

This problem generalizes coordination problems previously studied\nby Halpern and Moses and by Ben-Zvi and Moses.\n  We optimally solve timely-coordinated response in two ways: using a\ngeneralization of the fixed-point approach of Halpern and Moses, and using a\ngeneralization of the \"syncausality\" approach of Ben-Zvi and Moses.

Moreover, soft interactions unavoidably give an underlying\ncomponent to the rare `hard' events, from which we hope to extract new physics.\nHere, we discuss how to quantify this contamination. First we present a brief\nintroduction to diffraction. We emphasize the different treatment required for\nproton dissociation into low- and high-mass systems; the former requiring a\nmultichannel eikonal approach, and the latter the computation of triple-Pomeron\ndiagrams with multi-Pomeron corrections. Then we give an overview of the\nPomeron, and explain how the QCD (BFKL-type) Pomeron is the natural object to\ncontinue from the `hard' to the `soft' domain. In this way we can obtain a\npartonic description of soft interactions. We introduce the so-called KMR\nmodel, based on this partonic approach, which includes absorptive multi-Pomeron\ncorrections that become increasingly important as we proceed further into the\nsoft domain. This model is able to describe total, elastic and proton\ndissociation data, and to predict the survival probability of large rapidity\ngaps to soft rescattering --- in terms of a few physically-motivated\nparameters. However, more differential phenomena, such as single particle p_t\ndistributions, can only be satisfactorily described if hadronization effects\nare included. This is achieved by incorporating the KMR analytic approach into\nthe SHERPA Monte Carlo framework. It allows a description of soft physics and\ndiffraction, together with jet physics, in a coherent, self-consistent way.

Often, the common\nthinking among researchers and implementers is that compression is always a\ngood choice, because the major source of energy consumption in a sensor node\ncomes from the transmission of the data. Lossy compression is deemed a viable\nsolution as the imperfect reconstruction of the signal is often acceptable in\nWSN. In this paper, we thoroughly review a number of lossy compression methods\nfrom the literature, and analyze their performance in terms of compression\nefficiency, computational complexity and energy consumption. We consider two\ndifferent scenarios, namely, wireless and underwater communications, and show\nthat signal compression may or may not help in the reduction of the overall\nenergy consumption, depending on factors such as the compression algorithm, the\nsignal statistics and the hardware characteristics, i.e., micro-controller and\ntransmission technology. The lesson that we have learned, is that signal\ncompression may in fact provide some energy savings. However, its usage should\nbe carefully evaluated, as in quite a few cases processing and transmission\ncosts are of the same order of magnitude, whereas, in some other cases, the\nformer may even dominate the latter. In this paper, we show quantitative\ncomparisons to assess these tradeoffs in the above mentioned scenarios.\nFinally, we provide formulas, obtained through numerical fittings, to gauge\ncomputational complexity, overall energy consumption and signal representation\naccuracy for the best performing algorithms as a function of the most relevant\nsystem parameters.\n"]}]

Instead\nof providing redundancy for each core separately, RepTFD provides redundancy\nfor a group of cores as a whole. To be specific, it replays the execution of\nthe checked group of cores on a redundant group of cores. Through comparing the\nexecution results between the two groups of cores, all malignant transient\nfaults can be caught.

In that\ncase the tile can be taken to have sides a, b, and c where a=M and c=K and\nb=K-M^2/K, so all three sides will be integers.\n  Combining this with the results of a previous paper, we obtain a no-tiling\ntheorem: if N is squarefree and N > 6 and divisible by at least one prime\ncongruent to 3 mod 4, then there are no N-tilings of any triangle by any tile,\nunless the tile has a 120 degree angle.\n"]}]

While\nconventional neutron star models can hardly provide such a high binding energy,\nthe strong self-bound surface of quark-cluster stars can naturally solve this\nproblem. As for the thermal one, the featureless X-ray spectra of pulsars may\nindicate a bare surface without atmosphere, and the ultrarelativistic fireball\nof gamma-ray bursts and supernovae would also require strong self-bound\nsurfaces.

By comparing synthetic 1D LTE and 3D\nnon-LTE line profiles of the Li 670.8 nm feature, we quantify the differential\neffect of the convective line asymmetry on the derived 6Li abundance as a\nfunction of effective temperature, gravity, and metallicity.

In the case of cubic Julia sets the details follows the\npattern established for quadratic Julia sets, but for matings the details are\nquite challenging, and we have only been completely successful for one example.\nOnce we have constructed the Laplacian, we are able to use numerical methods to\napproximate the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. One striking observation from\nthe data is that for the cubic Julia sets the multiplicities of all eigenspaces\n(except for the trivial eigenspace of constants) are even numbers. Nothing like\nthis is valid for the quadratic julia sets studied earlier. We are able to\nexplain this, based on the fact that three is an odd number, and more precisely\nbecause the dihedral-3 symmetry group has only two distinct one-dimensional\nirreducible representations.\n"]}]
