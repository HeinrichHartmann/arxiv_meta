We extend here to a much broader class of states when\nthe second party is of arbitrary dimension d, so long as the first, measured,\nparty is a qubit. We present two formulae to calculate quantum discord, the\nfirst relating to the original entropic definition and the second to a recently\nproposed geometric distance measure which leads to an analytical formulation.\nThe tracing over the qubit in the entropic calculation is reduced to a very\nsimple prescription. And, when the d-dimensional system is a so-called X state,\nthe density matrix having non-zero elements only along the diagonal and\nanti-diagonal so as to appear visually like the letter X, the entropic\ncalculation can be carried out analytically. Such states of the full bipartite\nqubit-qudit system may be named \"extended X states\", whose density matrix is\nbuilt of four block matrices, each visually appearing as an X. The optimization\ninvolved in the entropic calculation is generally over two parameters, reducing\nto one for many cases, and avoided altogether for an overwhelmingly large set\nof density matrices as our numerical investigations demonstrate.

In\nmany earlier studies spherical symmetry has been assumed partly because of\nlimited data quality, however new deep observations and instrumental designs\nwill make it possible to go beyond that assumption. Measuring the temperature\nand density profiles are of interest when observing the x-ray gas, however the\nspatial shape of the gas itself also carries very useful information. For\nexample, it is believed that the x-ray gas shape in the inner parts of galaxy\nclusters is greatly affected by feedback mechanisms, cooling and rotation, and\nmeasuring this shape can therefore indirectly provide information on these\nmechanisms. In this paper we present a novel method to measure the\nthree-dimensional shape of the intracluster x-ray emitting gas. We can measure\nthe shape from the x-ray observations only, i.e. the method does not require\ncombination with independent measurements of e.g. the cluster mass or density\nprofile. This is possible when one uses the full spectral information contained\nin the observed spectra. We demonstrate the method by measuring radial\ndependent shapes along the line of sight for CHANDRA mock data. We find that at\nleast 10^6 photons are required to get a 5-{\\sigma} detection of shape for an\nx-ray gas having realistic features such as a cool core and a double powerlaw\nfor the density profile. We illustrate how Bayes' theorem is used to find the\nbest fitting model of the x-ray gas, an analysis that is very important in a\nreal observational scenario where the true spatial shape is unknown.

We present our deep optical observations with the Very Large\nTelescope to search for an optical counterpart of the pulsar and its nebula.

The\ndirection of the estimated proper motion coincides with the extension of the\npulsar's X-ray tail, suggesting that this is a jet.

It implies\na strong double-knee spectral break in the pulsar emission between the optical\nand X-rays. The reasons for the spectral steepness are unclear.

Thus each pair of electron-hole states is associated with a\npair of Majorana modes. Only one lead Majorana mode couples to the intrinsic\nMajorana mode whereas its partner is completely reflected. Similarly the\nremaining Majorana modes are completely reflected but in general mix pair-wise.\nWe demonstrate that the charge current can also be expressed in terms of\ninterference between pairs of Majorana modes. These two basic facts permit a\ntreatment and understanding of current and noise signatures of chiral Majorana\nfermion interferometry in an especially elegant way. As a particular example of\napplications, in Fabry-Perot-type interferometers where chiral Majorana modes\nform loops, resonances (anti-resonances) from such loops always lead to peaked\n(suppressed) Andreev differential conductances, and negative (positive)\ncross-correlations that originate purely from two-Majorana-fermion exchange.\nThese investigations are intimately related to current and noise signatures of\nMajorana bound states.\n"]}]

In this relaxed version, loosely speaking, the algorithm is allowed to\nreplace the constraints of an instance by some other (possibly real-valued)\nconstraints, and then only needs to satisfy as many of the new constraints as\npossible.\n  To be more precise, we introduce the following notion of a predicate $P$\nbeing \\emph{useful} for a (real-valued) objective $Q$: given an almost\nsatisfiable Max-$P$ instance, there is an algorithm that beats a random\nassignment on the corresponding Max-$Q$ instance applied to the same sets of\nliterals. The standard notion of a nontrivial approximation algorithm for a\nMax-CSP with predicate $P$ is exactly the same as saying that $P$ is useful for\n$P$ itself.\n  We say that $P$ is useless if it is not useful for any $Q$. This turns out to\nbe equivalent to the following pseudo-randomness property: given an almost\nsatisfiable instance of Max-$P$ it is hard to find an assignment such that the\ninduced distribution on $k$-bit strings defined by the instance is not\nessentially uniform.\n  Under the Unique Games Conjecture, we give a complete and simple\ncharacterization of useful Max-CSPs defined by a predicate: such a Max-CSP is\nuseless if and only if there is a pairwise independent distribution supported\non the satisfying assignments of the predicate. It is natural to also consider\nthe case when no negations are allowed in the CSP instance, and we derive a\nsimilar complete characterization (under the UGC) there as well.\n  Finally, we also include some results and examples shedding additional light\non the approximability of certain Max-CSPs.\n"]}]

Real\ngalaxies, however, are now known to have a range of different light-profile\nshapes that scale with mass. Consequently, although highly useful, the above\nmodels have implicit limitations, and this is illustrated here through their\napplication to a number of real galaxy density profiles. On the other hand, the\nanalytical density profile given by Prugniel & Simien (1997) closely matches\nthe deprojected form of Sersic R^{1/n} light-profiles - including deprojected\nexponential light-profiles. It is thus applicable for describing bulges in\nspiral galaxies, dwarf elliptical galaxies, and both ordinary and giant\nelliptical galaxies. Here we provide simple equations, in terms of elementary\nand special functions, for the gravitational potential and force associated\nwith this density profile. Furthermore, to match galaxies with partially\ndepleted cores, and better explore the supermassive black hole / galaxy\nconnection, we have added a power-law core to this density profile and derived\nsimilar expressions for the potential and force of this hybrid profile.\nExpressions for the mass and velocity dispersion, assuming isotropy, are also\ngiven. These models may also prove appropriate for describing the dark matter\ndistribution in halos formed from LCDM cosmological simulations.\n","Comment: To appear in MNRAS.

We consider halos generated from LCDM simulations of gravitational\nclustering, as well as isolated, spherical collapses. The logarithmic density\nslopes gamma = d(log rho)/d(log r) of the LCDM halos are found to vary as\npower-laws in radius, reaching values of gamma ~ -1 at the innermost resolved\nradii (~0.01 r_virial). This behavior is significantly different from that of\nbroken power-law models like the NFW profile, but similar to that of models\nlike de Vaucouleurs'. Accordingly, we compare the N-body density profiles with\nvarious parametric models to find which provide the best fit. We consider an\nNFW-like model with arbitrary inner slope; Dehnen & McLaughlin's anisotropic\nmodel; Einasto's model (identical in functional form to Sersic's model but fit\nto the space density); and the density model of Prugniel & Simien that was\ndesigned to match the deprojected form of Sersic's R^{1/n} law. Overall, the\nbest-fitting model to the LCDM halos is Einasto's, although the Prugniel-Simien\nand Dehnen-McLaughlin models also perform well. With regard to the spherical\ncollapse halos, both the Prugniel-Simien and Einasto models describe the\ndensity profiles well, with an rms scatter some four times smaller than that\nobtained with either the NFW-like model or the 3-parameter Dehnen-McLaughlin\nmodel.
