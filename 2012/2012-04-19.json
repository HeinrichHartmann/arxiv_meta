The two-level convergence of the method is then used\nto establish the convergence of an Algebraic Multilevel Iteration that uses the\ntwo-level scheme recursively. On structured grids, the method is proven to have\nconvergence rate $\\approx (1-1/\\log n)$ and $O(n\\log n)$ complexity for each\ncycle, where $n$ denotes the number of unknowns in the given problem.

The method,\ntermed multilevel sparse kernel-based interpolation (MLSKI, for short), uses\nboth level-wise and direction-wise multilevel decomposition of structured (or\nmildly unstructured) interpolation data sites in conjunction with the\napplication of kernel-based interpolants with different scaling in each\ndirection. The multilevel interpolation algorithm is based on a hierarchical\ndecomposition of the data sites, whereby at each level the detail is added to\nthe interpolant by interpolating the resulting residual of the previous level.\nOn each level, anisotropic radial basis functions are used for solving a number\nof small interpolation problems, which are subsequently linearly combined to\nproduce the interpolant. MLSKI can be viewed as an extension of $d$-boolean\ninterpolation (which is closely related to ideas in sparse grid and hyperbolic\ncrosses literature) to kernel-based functions, within the hierarchical\nmultilevel framework to achieve accelerated convergence. Numerical experiments\nsuggest that the new algorithm is numerically stable and efficient for the\nreconstruction of large data in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\times \\mathbb{R}$, for $d = 2,\n3, 4$, with tens or even hundreds of thousands data points. Also, MLSKI appears\nto be generally superior over classical radial basis function methods in terms\nof complexity, run time and convergence at least for large data sets.\n"]}]
