A\ntypical example is the separation of riparian vegetation from ground in fluvial\nenvironments, the distinction between fresh surfaces and rockfall in cliff\nenvironments, or more generally the classification of surfaces according to\ntheir morphology. Natural surfaces are heterogeneous and their distinctive\nproperties are seldom defined at a unique scale, prompting the use of\nmulti-scale criteria to achieve a high degree of classification success. We\nhave thus defined a multi-scale measure of the point cloud dimensionality\naround each point, which characterizes the local 3D organization. We can thus\nmonitor how the local cloud geometry behaves across scales. We present the\ntechnique and illustrate its efficiency in separating riparian vegetation from\nground and classifying a mountain stream as vegetation, rock, gravel or water\nsurface. In these two cases, separating the vegetation from ground or other\nclasses achieve accuracy larger than 98 %. Comparison with a single scale\napproach shows the superiority of the multi-scale analysis in enhancing class\nseparability and spatial resolution. The technique is robust to missing data,\nshadow zones and changes in point density within the scene. The classification\nis fast and accurate and can account for some degree of intra-class\nmorphological variability such as different vegetation types. A probabilistic\nconfidence in the classification result is given at each point, allowing the\nuser to remove the points for which the classification is uncertain. The\nprocess can be both fully automated, but also fully customized by the user\nincluding a graphical definition of the classifiers. Although developed for\nfully 3D data, the method can be readily applied to 2.5D airborne lidar data.\n","Comment: Free/Libre software implementation is available at\n  http://nicolas.brodu.numerimoire.net, as well as data sets"]}]

The method consists in constructing mappings\nfrom triangles in a background mesh to curvilinear ones that conform exactly to\nthe immersed domain. Constructing such a map relies on a novel way of\nparameterizing the immersed boundary over a collection of nearby edges with its\nclosest point projection. By interpolating the mappings to curvilinear\ntriangles at select points, we recover isoparametric mappings for the immersed\ndomain defined over the background mesh. Indeed, interpolating the constructed\nmappings just at the vertices of the background mesh yields a fast meshing\nalgorithm that involves only perturbing a few vertices near the boundary.\n  For the discretization of a curved domain to be robust, we have to impose\nrestrictions on the background mesh. Conversely, these restrictions define a\nfamily of domains that can be discretized with a given background mesh. We then\nsay that the background mesh is a universal mesh for such a family of domains.\nThe notion of universal meshes is particularly useful in free/moving boundary\nproblems because the same background mesh can serve as the universal mesh for\nthe evolving domain for time intervals that are independent of the time step.\nHence it facilitates a framework for finite element calculations over evolving\ndomains while using a fixed background mesh. Furthermore, since the evolving\ngeometry can be approximated with any desired order, numerical solutions can be\ncomputed with high-order accuracy.

The key idea is that the\nstate of the incoming atom be regarded as belonging to an irreducible unitary\nray representation of this group.

(While the zero of internal energy is arbitrary, the difference\nbetween two internal energies is well-defined and is invariant under unitary\ntransformations.) The state of the outgoing atom will then be a superposition\nof two mutually orthogonal states, so that there will be no interference.\nNeither complementarity nor entanglement plays a role in this explanation.\nFurthermore, in atom interferometry it is not enough for a quantum eraser to\nerase the internal energy difference; to restore interference, two copies of a\nrepresentation have to be collapsed into one. In a direct sum of copies of the\nsame representation, copies of the same state will still be orthogonal.

The representations are unitarily\ninequivalent because the spectra of the position and momentum operators are\ndifferent, and spectra are invariant under unitary transformations. The\nexistence of these representations can have consequences that run from the\nmerely unexpected to the barely conceivable. To start with, states of a single\nparticle that belong to inequivalent representations will always be mutually\northogonal; they will never interfere with each other. This property, called\nsuperseparability elsewhere, is well-defined mathematically, but has not yet\nbeen observed.

We introduce here an alternative\napproach for simulating phenotypes under H1 that does not require generating\nnew genotypes for each simulation. In order to simulate phenotypes with a fixed\ntotal number of cases and under a given disease model, we suggest three\nalgorithms: i) a simple rejection algorithm; ii) a numerical Markov Chain\nMonte-Carlo (MCMC) approach; iii) and an exact and efficient backward sampling\nalgorithm. In our study, we validated the three algorithms both on a\ntoy-dataset and by comparing them with Hapgen on a more realistic dataset. As\nan application, we then conducted a simulation study on a 1000 Genomes Project\ndataset consisting of 629 individuals (314 cases) and 8,048 SNPs from\nChromosome X. We arbitrarily defined an additive disease model with two\nsusceptibility SNPs and an epistatic effect. The three algorithms are\nconsistent, but backward sampling is dramatically faster than the other two.\nOur approach also gives consistent results with Hapgen. Using our application\ndata, we showed that our limited design requires a biological a priori to limit\nthe investigated region.
