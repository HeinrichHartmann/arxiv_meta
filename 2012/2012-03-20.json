The short message service (SMS) is one of its\nsuperior and well-tried services with a global availability in the GSM\nnetworks. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a new secure\napplication layer protocol, called SSMS, to efficiently embed the desired\nsecurity attributes in the SMS messages to be used as a secure bearer in the\nm-payment systems. SSMS efficiently embeds the confidentiality, integrity,\nauthentication, and non-repudiation in the SMS messages. It provides an\nelliptic curve-based public key solution that uses public keys for the secret\nkey establishment of a symmetric encryption. It also provides the attributes of\npublic verification and forward secrecy. It efficiently makes the SMS messaging\nsuitable for the m-payment applications where the security is the great\nconcern.\n","Comment: 6 Pages, 5 Figures"]}]

Because of the\nshort cooling time of the gamma-ray emitting electrons, the gamma-ray emission\nzone is in the immediate vicinity of the acceleration site. The particle\nacceleration likely occurs at the termination shock of the relativistic striped\nwind, where multiple forced magnetic field reconnections provide strong\nmagnetic fluctuations facilitating Fermi acceleration processes. The\nacceleration mechanisms imply the presence of stochastic magnetic fields in the\nparticle acceleration region, which cause stochastic variability of the\nsynchrotron emission. This variability is particularly strong in the steep\ngamma-ray tail of the spectrum, where modest fluctuations of the magnetic field\nlead to strong flares of spectral flux. In particular, stochastic variations of\nmagnetic field, which may lead to quasi-cyclic gamma-ray flares, can be\nproduced by the relativistic cyclotron ion instability at the termination\nshock. Our model calculations of the spectral and temporal evolution of\nsynchrotron emission in the spectral cut-off regime demonstrate that the\nintermittent magnetic field concentrations dominate the gamma-ray emission from\nhighest energy electrons and provide fast, strong variability even for a\nquasi-steady distribution of radiating particles. The simulated light curves\nand spectra can explain the very strong gamma-ray flares observed in the Crab\nnebula and the lack of strong variations at other wavelengths.

The transport,\nmagnetotransport and non-linear conduction (I-V curves) were analysed using the\nconcept of Spin Polarized Tunnelling in the presence of Coulomb blockade. The\nactivation energy of transport, \\Delta, was used to estimate the tunnelling\ndistances and the inverse decay length of the tunnelling wave function (\\chi)\nand the height of the tunnelling barrier (\\Phi_B). The magnetotransport data\nwere used to find out the magnetic field dependences of these tunnelling\nparameters. The data taken over a large magnetic field range allowed us to\nseparate out the MR contributions at low temperatures arising from tunnelling\ninto two distinct contributions. In LCMO, at low magnetic field, the transport\nand the MR are dominated by the spin polarization, while at higher magnetic\nfield the MR arises from the lowering of the tunnel barrier by the magnetic\nfield leading to an MR that does not saturate even at 14 T.
