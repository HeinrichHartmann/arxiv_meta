The NMR\nspin-latticerelaxation rate $1/T_1$ deviates from the Korringa law below 100 K\nsignaling the onset of an energy gap $\\Delta E_g1/k_B \\simeq 30$K. This gap is\nstable against magnetic fields up to 10 T. Below 10 K, however, unusual\nlow-energy excitations of in-gap states are observed, which depend strongly on\nthe field H. The specific heat C detects these excitations in the form of an\nenhanced Sommerfeld coefficient $\\gamma = C(T)/T$ : In zero field, $\\gamma$\nincreases steeply below 5 K, reaching a maximum at 0.1 K, and then saturates at\n$\\gamma = 0.6$ J/molK$^2$. This maximum is shifted to higher temperatures with\nincreasing field suggesting a residual density of states at the Fermi level\ndeveloping a spin gap $\\Delta E_g2$.

Their work has impacted antiviral treatment and vaccine design\nstrategies. Yet, predictions of the quasispecies model are at best viewed as a\nguideline, primarily because it assumes an infinite population size, whereas\nrealistic population sizes can be quite small. In this paper we consider a\npopulation genetics-based model aimed at understanding the evolution of such\norganisms with finite population sizes and present a rigorous study of the\nconvergence and computational issues that arise therein. Our first result is\nstructural and shows that, at any time during the evolution, as the population\nsize tends to infinity, the distribution of genomes predicted by our model\nconverges to that predicted by the quasispecies model. This justifies the\ncontinued use of the quasispecies model to derive guidelines for intervention.\nWhile the stationary state in the quasispecies model is readily obtained, due\nto the explosion of the state space in our model, exact computations are\nprohibitive. Our second set of results are computational in nature and address\nthis issue. We derive conditions on the parameters of evolution under which our\nstochastic model mixes rapidly. Further, for a class of widely used fitness\nlandscapes we give a fast deterministic algorithm which computes the stationary\ndistribution of our model. These computational tools are expected to serve as a\nframework for the modeling of strategies for the deployment of mutagenic drugs.\n"]}]
