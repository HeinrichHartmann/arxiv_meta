We\nexplore the observational consequences of a hypothetical spicule dominated\ncorona and conclude from the large discrepancy between predicted and actual\nobservations that only a small fraction of the hot plasma can be supplied by\nspicules (<2% in active regions, <5% in the quiet Sun, and <8% in coronal\nholes). The red-blue asymmetries of EUV spectral lines and the ratio of lower\ntransition region (LTR; T<0.1 MK) to coronal emission measures are both\npredicted to be 2 orders of magnitude larger than observed. Furthermore, hot\nspicule material would cool dramatically by adiabatic expansion as it rises\ninto the corona, so substantial coronal heating would be needed to maintain the\nhigh temperatures that are seen at all altitudes. We suggest that the corona\ncontains a mixture of thin strands, some of which are populated by spicule\ninjections, but most of which are not. A majority of the observed hot emission\noriginates in non-spicule strands and is explained by traditional coronal\nheating models. However, since these models predict far too little emission\nfrom the LTR, most of this emission comes from the bulk of the spicule material\nthat is only weakly heated and visible in He II (304 A) as it falls back to the\nsurface.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 5 figures, published"]}]

Since typical media have $\\xi_{2\\gamma}<\\xi_{1\\gamma}$, we discuss three\nmechanisms for enhancing two-photon absorption as compared to one-photon loss.\nThe first mechanism again employs the quantum Zeno effect via self-interference\neffects when sending two photons repeatedly through the same absorber. The\nsecond mechanism is based on coherent excitations of many atoms and exploits\nthe fact that $\\xi_{2\\gamma}$ scales with the number of excitations but\n$\\xi_{1\\gamma}$ does not.

For fragments of length less than the minimum\nspan length of the code it is shown that fragment observability and fragment\ncontrollability are equivalent to irreducibility. For reducible trellises, a\nconstructive reduction procedure is presented.

Following the systematics of the WR star\ncatalogues, these stars obtain the names WR\\,120bb and WR\\,120bc. In this\npaper, we present and analyse new near-IR, $J$, $H$, and $K$-band, spectra\nusing the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmosphere code. For that purpose,\nthe atomic data base of the code has been extended in order to include all\nsignificant lines in the near-IR bands.\n  The spectra of both stars are classified as WN9h. As their spectra are very\nsimilar the parameters that we obtained by the spectral analyses hardly differ.\nDespite their late spectral subtype, we found relatively high stellar\ntemperatures of 63 kK. The wind composition is dominated by helium, while\nhydrogen is depleted to 25 per cent by mass.\n  Because of their location in the Scutum-Centaurus arm, WR\\,120bb and\nWR\\,120bc appear highly reddened, $A_{K_{\\rm s}} \\approx 2$ mag. We adopt a\ncommon distance of 5.8\\,kpc to both stars, which complies with the typical\nabsolute $K$-band magnitude for the WN9h subtype of -6.5 mag, is consistent\nwith their observed extinction based on comparison with other massive stars in\nthe region, and allows for the possibility that their shells are interacting\nwith each other. This leads to luminosities of $\\log(L/L_\\odot) = 5.66$ and\n5.54 for WR\\,120bb and WR\\,120bc, with large uncertainties due to the adopted\ndistance.\n  The values of the luminosities of WR\\,120bb and WR\\,120bc imply that the\nimmediate precursors of both stars were red supergiants (RSG).

The transmitter uses a set of N\nSpace-Time Block Codes (STBCs), one corresponding to each of the N possible\nfeedback values, to encode and transmit information. The feedback function used\nat the receiver and the N component STBCs used at the transmitter together\nconstitute a Finite Feedback Scheme (FFS). Although a number of FFSs are\navailable in the literature that provably achieve full-diversity, there is no\nknown universal criterion to determine whether a given arbitrary FFS achieves\nfull-diversity or not.

In this paper\na universal necessary condition for any FFS to achieve full-diversity is given,\nusing which the notion of Feedback-Transmission duration optimal (FT-Optimal)\nFFSs - schemes that use minimum amount of feedback N given the transmission\nduration T, and minimum transmission duration given the amount of feedback to\nachieve full-diversity - is introduced. When there is no feedback (N=1) an\nFT-optimal scheme consists of a single STBC with T=N_t, and the universal\nnecessary condition reduces to the well known necessary and sufficient\ncondition for an STBC to achieve full-diversity: every non-zero codeword\ndifference matrix of the STBC must be of rank N_t. Also, a sufficient condition\nfor full-diversity is given for the FFSs in which the component STBC with the\nlargest minimum Euclidean distance is chosen. Using this sufficient condition\nfull-rate (rate N_t) full-diversity FT-Optimal schemes are constructed for all\n(N_t,T,N) with NT=N_t.

On top of this trajectory model, an optimization process minimizes\nthese probabilities by tuning the parameters of the Bayesian trajectory model\nrelated to overflight times on metering points.

We present a stand-alone software (named EXSdetect) for the detection\nof extended sources in X-ray images. Our goal is to provide a flexible tool\ncapable of detecting extended sources down to the lowest flux levels attainable\nwithin instrumental limitations, while maintaining robust photometry, high\ncompleteness, and low contamination, regardless of source morphology. EXSdetect\nwas developed mainly to exploit the ever-increasing wealth of archival X-ray\ndata, but is also ideally suited to explore the scientific capabilities of\nfuture X-ray facilities, with a strong focus on investigations of distant\ngroups and clusters of galaxies. Methods. EXSdetect combines a fast Voronoi\ntessellation code with a friends-of-friends algorithm and an automated\ndeblending procedure. The values of key parameters are matched to fundamental\ntelescope properties such as angular resolution and instrumental background. In\naddition, the software is designed to permit extensive tests of its performance\nvia simulations of a wide range of observational scenarios. Results. We applied\nEXSdetect to simulated data fields modeled to realistically represent the Swift\nX-ray Cluster Survey (SXCS), which is based on archival data obtained by the\nX-ray telescope onboard the Swift satellite. We achieve more than 90%\ncompleteness for extended sources comprising at least 80 photons in the 0.5-2\nkeV band, a limit that corresponds to 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for the deepest\nSXCS fields. This detection limit is comparable to the one attained by the most\nsensitive cluster surveys conducted with much larger X-ray telescopes.

As the differences originate\nmainly from faces and hydrogen bonds that are not allowed by the Vienna\npackage, it is suggested that prediction may be improved by integrating them\ninto the software. In the second project we calculate the free energy of an\ninterior loop using Monte-Carlo simulation. We first present a semi-coarse\ngrained model for interior loops of RNA, and the energy model for the different\ninteractions. We then introduce the Monte-Carlo simulations and the method of\nParallel Tempering which enables good sampling of configuration space by\nsimulating a system simultaneously at several temperatures. Next we present\nThermodynamic Integration, which is a method for calculating free energy\ndifferences. Then, We introduce a method that calculates the free energy\nsignificantly faster since we need to use only one parameter, $T$. To implement\nthis method, we had to reach a regime in which the partition functions of the\ntwo systems are equal, which isn't satisfied for systems that have different\nentropies in the high temperature limit, so a solution to this problem had to\nbe found. Free energy values calculated for various interior loops are shown,\nand may, if verified or with a more realistic modelling, be integrated into the\nVienna package and supply an alternative to the experiments done.\n"]}]

Although little is known about the structure of epistasis in most\norganisms, recent experiments with bacterial populations have concluded that\nantagonistic interactions abound and tend to de-accelerate the pace of\nadaptation over time. Here, we use a broad class of mathematical fitness\nlandscapes to examine how natural selection biases the mutations that\nsubstitute during evolution based on their epistatic interactions. We find\nthat, even when beneficial mutations are rare, these biases are strong and\nchange substantially throughout the course of adaptation.

We observe the same patterns when re-analyzing data from a\nrecent microbial evolution experiment. Since these biases depend on the\npopulation size and other parameters, they must be quantified before we can\nhope to use experimental data to infer an organism's underlying fitness\nlandscape or to understand the role of epistasis in shaping its adaptation.

For any partition of $\\lam^\\vee=\\sum_j \\lam_j^\\vee$ as a sum of\ndominant integral $\\Lg$--coweights, the Demazure module is (as $\\Lg$--module)\nisomorphic to $\\bigotimes_j V_{-\\lam^\\vee_j}(m\\Lam_0)$. For the ``smallest''\ncase, $\\lam^\\vee=\\om^\\vee$ a fundamental coweight, we provide for $\\Lg$ of\nclassical type a decomposition of $V_{-\\om^\\vee}(m\\Lam_0)$ into irreducible\n$\\Lg$--modules, so this can be viewed as a natural generalization of the\ndecomposition formulas in \\cite{KMOTU} and \\cite{Magyar}. A comparison with the\n$U_q(\\Lg)$--characters of certain finite dimensional $U_q'(\\Lhg)$--modules\n(Kirillov--Reshetikhin--modules) suggests furthermore that all quantized\nDemazure modules $V_{-\\lam^\\vee,q}(m\\Lam_0)$ can be naturally endowed with the\nstructure of a $U_q'(\\Lhg)$--module. Such a structure suggests also a\ncombinatorially interesting connection between the LS--path model for the\nDemazure module and the LS--path model for certain $U_q'(\\Lhg)$--modules in\n\\cite{NaitoSagaki}. For an integral dominant $\\Lhg$--weight $\\Lambda$ let\n$V(\\Lam)$ be the corresponding irreducible $\\Lhg$--representation. Using the\ntensor product decomposition for Demazure modules, we give a description of the\n$\\Lg$--module structure of $V(\\Lam)$ as a semi-infinite tensor product of\nfinite dimensional $\\Lg$--modules. The case of twisted affine Kac-Moody\nalgebras can be treated in the same way, some details are worked out in the\nlast section.\n","Comment: 24 pages, in the current version we added the case of twisted affine\n  Kac--Moody algebras"]}]
