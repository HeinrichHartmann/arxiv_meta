The\nconjugated planar triangulation will be introduced and on the base of the\nproperties, which were achieved by the other authors there will be proved some\ntheorems, which will show the properties of the dual triangulations. Also the\nnumeric properties of the dual planar triangulations will be examined for the\nsake of understanding the interdependences of the cyclimatic numbers of\ndifferent graphs between themselves. We'll see how the cyclomatic number of the\nplanar conjugated triangulation depends on the cyclomatic number of the planar\ntriangulation and how its increment depends on the number of the vertexes.\nThese characteristics will be further very important for examining of Four\nColor Problem. The properties of the dual matrixes will also be examined. We\nwill see that both matrixes on the one hand must meet the equal requirements,\nbut on the other hand we will see that one characteristic cannot be fulfilled.\nThis fact will further form the restrictions for the solution of Four Color\nProblem.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 17 figures"]}]
