Euclidean shortest paths and minimum-link paths between $s$\nand $t$ inside $P$ have been well studied. Both these kinds of paths are simple\nand piecewise-convex. However, computing optimal paths in the context of\ndiffuse or specular reflections does not seem to be an easy task. A path from a\nlight source $s$ to $t$ inside $P$ is called a diffuse reflection path if the\nturning points of the path lie in the interiors of the boundary edges of $P$. A\ndiffuse reflection path is said to be optimal if it has the minimum number of\nturning points amongst all diffuse reflection paths between $s$ and $t$. The\nminimum diffuse reflection path may not be simple. The problem of computing the\nminimum diffuse reflection path in low degree polynomial time has remained\nopen.\n  In our quest for understanding the geometric structure of the minimum diffuse\nreflection paths vis-a-vis shortest paths and minimum link paths, we define a\nnew kind of diffuse reflection path called a constrained diffuse reflection\npath where (i) the path is simple, (ii) it intersects only the eaves of the\nEuclidean shortest path between $s$ and $t$, and (iii) it intersects each eave\nexactly once.

This paper quantifies the impact of hardware impairments on\ndual-hop relaying, for both amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward\nprotocols. The outage probability (OP) in these practical scenarios is a\nfunction of the effective end-to-end signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio\n(SNDR).

This paper\nvalidates that the performance loss is small at low rates, but otherwise can be\nvery substantial. In particular, it is proved that for high signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR), the end-to-end SNDR converges to a deterministic constant, coined\nthe SNDR ceiling, which is inversely proportional to the level of impairments.\nThis stands in contrast to the ideal hardware case in which the end-to-end SNDR\ngrows without bound in the high-SNR regime.

In\ncontrast to most of existing work which deal with the problem by adding some\nsparsity penalties on various objectives of PCA, in this paper, we propose a\nnew method SPCArt, whose motivation is to find a rotation matrix and a sparse\nbasis such that the sparse basis approximates the basis of PCA after the\nrotation. The algorithm of SPCArt consists of three alternating steps: rotate\nPCA basis, truncate small entries, and update the rotation matrix. Its\nperformance bounds are also given. SPCArt is efficient, with each iteration\nscaling linearly with the data dimension. It is easy to choose parameters in\nSPCArt, due to its explicit physical explanations. Besides, we give a unified\nview to several existing sparse PCA methods and discuss the connection with\nSPCArt. Some ideas in SPCArt are extended to GPower, a popular sparse PCA\nalgorithm, to overcome its drawback. Experimental results demonstrate that\nSPCArt achieves the state-of-the-art performance. It also achieves a good\ntradeoff among various criteria, including sparsity, explained variance,\northogonality, balance of sparsity among loadings, and computational speed.\n"]}]

The electron-impurity scattering,\nwhich is shown to play a negligible role in spin relaxation in time domain in\nthis material, has a marked effect on the in-plane spin diffusion due to the\nanisotropic spin precession frequency in the spatial domain. With the\nelectron-impurity and inter-valley electron-phonon scatterings separately\nincluded in the scattering term, we study the intra- and inter-valley diffusion\nprocesses of the in-plane spins by analytically solving the kinetic spin Bloch\nequations. The intra-valley process is found to be dominant in the in-plane\nspin diffusion, in contrast to the case of spin relaxation in time domain,\nwhere the inter-valley process can be comparable to or even more important than\nthe intra-valley one. For the intra-valley process, we find that the in-plane\nspin diffusion is suppressed with the increase of impurity density but\neffectively enhanced by increasing electron density in both the degenerate and\nnondegenerate limits. We also take into account the electron-electron Coulomb\nscattering in the intra-valley process.

Due to the\nprojection of transiting exomoon orbits onto the celestial plane, satellites\nappear more often at larger separations from their planet. After about a dozen\nrandomly sampled observations, a photometric orbital sampling effect (OSE)\nstarts to appear in the phase-folded transit light curve, indicative of the\nmoons' radii and planetary distances. Two additional outcomes of the OSE emerge\nin the planet's transit timing variations (TTV-OSE) and transit duration\nvariations (TDV-OSE), both of which permit measurements of a moon's mass. The\nOSE is the first effect that permits characterization of multi-satellite\nsystems. I derive and apply analytical OSE descriptions to simulated transit\nobservations of the Kepler space telescope assuming white noise only. Moons as\nsmall as Ganymede may be detectable in the available data, with M stars being\ntheir most promising hosts.

In\nthis paper, we provide a formal approach to modeling trust as a pre-processing\nstep before belief revision. We emphasize that trust is not simply a relation\nbetween agents; the trust that one agent has in another is often restricted to\na particular domain of expertise. We demonstrate that this form of trust can be\ncaptured by associating a state-partition with each agent, then relativizing\nall reports to this state partition before performing belief revision. In this\nmanner, we incorporate only the part of a report that falls under the perceived\ndomain of expertise of the reporting agent. Unfortunately, state partitions\nbased on expertise do not allow us to compare the relative strength of trust\nheld with respect to different agents. To address this problem, we introduce\npseudometrics over states to represent differing degrees of trust. This allows\nus to incorporate simultaneous reports from multiple agents in a way that\nensures the most trusted reports will be believed.\n","Comment: Appears in the Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on\n  Non-Monotonic Reasoning (NMR 2014)"]}]

The evolution of the\ndune can be separated into two phases: a rapid initial adjustment to a state of\nquasi-steady avalanching perpendicular to the blade, followed by a much slower\nphase of lateral spreading and radial migration.

The sheer size and remote locations\nwhere surveillance videos are acquired, necessitates highly compressed\nrepresentations that are also meaningful for supporting user-defined queries.\nTo address these challenges we archive long-surveillance video through\nlightweight processing based on low-level local spatio-temporal extraction of\nmotion and object features.

DP exploits causality to\nassemble the indexed low level features into a video segment which matches the\nquery route.

We generate robust motion estimates for\nAirborne data using a tracklets generation algorithm while we use Horn and\nSchunck approach to generate motion estimates for CCTV.
