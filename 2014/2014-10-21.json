This is no longer true for nonequilibrium systems, where the\npattern of the most probable trajectories generally displays singularities.\nHere we study how the singularities emerge as the system is driven away from\nequilibrium, and whether a driving strength threshold is required for their\nonset. Using a resonantly modulated oscillator as a model, we identify two\ndistinct scenarios, depending on the speed of the optimal path in thermal\nequilibrium. If the position away from the stable state along the optimal path\ngrows exponentially in time, the singularities emerge without a threshold. We\nfind the scaling of the location of the singularities as a function of the\ncontrol parameter.

The data at early times ($\\lesssim 5$ days)\nnecessitates separation of the radio and X-ray emission regions, either\nspatially or in velocity space.

This model enables a self-consistent interpretation of the late\ntime radio data, both in terms of peak frequency and flux. We solve the\ndynamics, radiative cooling and expected radiation from both jet components. We\nshow that while during the first month synchrotron emission from the outer jet\ndominates the radio emission, at later times radiation from ambient gas\ncollected by the inner jet dominates.

After 100 days, the radio emission peak is in the optically thick\nregime, leading to a decay of both the flux and peak frequency at later times.\nOur model's predictions for the evolution of radio emission in jetted tidal\ndisruption events can be tested by future observations.\n","Comment: 33 pages, 6 figures and 1 table, extended explanations, added\n  figures, accepted for publication in the Astrophysics Journal"]}]

USA, 109,\n13521 (2012)] for tunneling in the absence of a threshold is put forward and\nproven to apply for systems with a non-zero threshold value. It is demonstrated\nthat the model is applicable for general interparticle interaction strengths,\nparticle numbers and threshold values. The model constructs the many-body\nprocess from single-particle emission processes. The rates and emission momenta\nof the single-particle processes are determined by the chemical potentials and\nenergy differences to the threshold value of the potential for systems with\ndifferent particle numbers. The chemical potentials and these energy\ndifferences depend on the interparticle interaction. Both the number of\nconfined particles and their rate of emission thus allow for a control by the\nmanipulation of the interparticle interaction and the threshold. Numerically\nexact results for two, three and one hundred bosons are shown and discussed.\nThe devised control scheme for the many-body tunneling process performs very\nwell for the dynamics of the momentum density, the correlations, the coherence\nand of the final state, i.e., the number of particles that remain confined in\nthe potential.\n","Comment: 36 pages, 14 figures"]}]

The case of dense networks is\nfurther analyzed by applying a simplified system model, in which the LOS region\nof a user is approximated as a fixed LOS ball. The results show that dense\nmmWave networks can achieve comparable coverage and much higher data rates than\nconventional UHF cellular systems, despite the presence of blockages. The\nresults suggest that the cell size to achieve the optimal SINR scales with the\naverage size of the area that is LOS to a user.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables"]}]

Comparing its angular dependence (aSDSE) with the angle\ndependent magnetoresistance (aMR) measurements on the same device, we are able\nto verify that a small spin heat accumulation builds up in our devices. From\nthe SDSE measurement and the observed current driven STT switching current of\n0.8 mA in our spin valve devices, it was estimated that a temperature\ndifference of 230 K is needed to produce an equal amount of TSTT. Experiments\nspecifically focused on investigating TSTT show a response that is dominated by\noverall heating of the magnetic layer. Comparing it to the current driven STT\nexperiments we estimate that only ~10% of the response is due to TSTT. This\nleads us to conclude that switching dominated by TSTT requires a direct\ncoupling to a perfect heat sink to minimize the effect of overall heating.\nNevertheless the combined effect of heating, STT and TSTT could prove useful\nfor inducing magnetization switching when further investigated and optimized.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures"]}]

Serial pruning is a simple technique to alter\nthe length of a permutation to support a wider range of lengths, but results in\na serial processing bottleneck.

The main challenge is to understand how\ntriplets are generated at the superconductor (S)/ ferromagnet (F) interface.\nHere we use the concept of a so-called triplet spin valve (TSV) to investigate\nthe conversion of singlets in a conventional superconductor to triplets in the\nhalfmetallic ferromagnet CrO_2. TSV's are composed of two ferromagnetic layers\n(separated by a thin normal metal (N) layer) and a superconductor\n(F_1/N/F_2/S). The package F_1/N/F_2 generates triplets in F_1 when the\nmagnetization directions of the F_{1,2}-layers are not collinear. This drains\nsinglet pairs from the S-layer, and triplet generation is therefore signalled\nby a decrease of the critical temperature $T_c$. Recently, experiments with\nTSV's were reported with Co draining layers, using in-plane fields, and finding\nT_c-shifts up to 100~mK. Using CrO_2 instead of Co and rotating a magnetic\nfield from in-plane to out-of-plane, we find strong T_c variations of almost a\nKelvin up to fields of the order of a Tesla.

We formulate the network utility\nmaximization problem for the downlink C-RAN under two different models\ndepending on whether the BS clustering for each user is dynamic or static over\ndifferent user scheduling time slots. In the former case, the user-centric BS\ncluster is dynamically optimized for each scheduled user along with the\nbeamforming vector in each time-frequency slot, while in the latter case the\nuser-centric BS cluster is fixed for each user and we jointly optimize the user\nscheduling and the beamforming vector to account for the backhaul constraints.\nIn both cases, the nonconvex per-BS backhaul constraints are approximated using\nthe reweighted l1-norm technique.

Currently the best commercially\navailable superbialkali photomultipliers (PMTs) have a PDE of about 30-33%,\nwhereas the silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs, also known as MPPC, GAPD) from\nsome manufacturers show a photon detection efficiency of about 40-45%. Using\nthese devices can lower the energy threshold of the instrument and may improve\nthe background rejection due to intrinsic properties of SiPMs such as a superb\nsingle photoelectron resolution. Compared to PMTs, SiPMs are more compact, fast\nin response, operate at low voltage, and are insensitive to magnetic fields.\nSiPMs can be operated at high background illumination, which would allow to\noperate the IACT also during partial moonlight, dusk and dawn, hence increasing\nthe instrument duty cycle. We are testing the SiPMs for Cherenkov telescopes\nsuch as MAGIC and CTA. Here we present an overview of our setup and first\nmeasurements, which we perform in two independent laboratories, in Munich,\nGermany and in Barcelona, Spain.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 5 figures, Proc. of 33rd ICRC, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2013"]}]

Tits in order to study semi-simple\nalgebraic groups from a geometrical point of view. One of the most important\nresults in the theory of buildings is the classification of irreducible\nspherical buildings of rank at least 3. About 25 years ago, M. Ronan and J.\nTits defined the class of twin buildings, which generalize spherical buildings\nin a natural way. The motivation of their definition is provided by the theory\nof Kac-Moody groups.\n  A 2-spherical twin building is uniquely determined by its local structure in\nalmost all cases: The so-called foundation is the union of the rank 2 residues\nwhich contain an (arbitrary) chamber. Therefore, the classification of\n2-spherical twin buildings reduces to the classification of all foundations\nwhich can be realized as the local structure of such a twin building. We call\nsuch a foundation \"integrable\".\n  By a result of Tits, an integrable foundation is Moufang, which means that\nthe rank 2 buildings in the foundation are Moufang polygons, and that the\nglueings are compatible with the Moufang structures induced on the rank 1\nresidues. As a consequence, the classification of Moufang polygons and the\nsolution of the isomorphism problem for Moufang sets are essential to work out\nwhich Moufang polygons fit together in order to form a foundation.\n  The present thesis contributes to establish complete lists of integrable\nfoundations for certain types of diagrams, namely for simply laced diagrams and\nfor 443 triangle diagrams. In this process, we closely follow the approach for\nthe classification of spherical buildings. However, we have to refine the\ntechniques used there, since in general, foundations don't only depend on the\ndiagram and the defining field.\n  Moreover, one of the main results in the context of Moufang sets is the\nsolution of the isomorphism problem for Moufang sets of pseudo-quadratic\nspaces.\n","Comment: PhD thesis, 221 pages"]}]

The most effective demagnetization is achieved by not\nonly stepping the field strength down while the sample is rotating, but by\ncombining each field step with an alternation in the field direction. By\ncontrast, linearly decreasing the field strength or stepping the field down\nwithout alternating the field direction leaves the arrays with a larger\nremanent magnetic moment.

Using a model of two-level atoms with Ising-type\ninteraction as an example, it is demonstrated that interparticle interaction\ncombined with atom-field coupling can introduce additional interatomic\ncorrelations acting as a phase synchronizing factor. For the case of weakly\ninteracting atoms with $J<\\hbar\\omega_0$, where $J$ is the interparticle\ncoupling constant and $\\omega_0$ is the atomic frequency, dynamical regimes of\ncooperative relaxation of atoms are analyzed in Born-Markov approximation both\nnumerically and using the mean field approximation. We show that interparticle\ncorrelations induced by the direct interaction result in inhibition of\nincoherent spontaneous decay leading to the regime of collective pulse\nrelaxation which differs from superradiance in nature. For superradiant\ntransition, the synchronizing effect of interatomic interaction is found to\nmanifest itself in enhancement of superradiance. When the interaction is strong\nand $J>\\hbar\\omega_0$, one-partice one-photon transitions are excluded and\ntransition to the regime of multiphoton relaxation occurs. Using a simple model\nof two atoms in a high-Q single mode cavity we show that such transition is\naccompanied by Rabi oscillations involving many-atom multiphoton states.\nDephasing effect of dipole-dipole interaction and solitonic mechanism of\nrelaxation are discussed.\n","Comment: 34 pages, 8 figures"]}]
