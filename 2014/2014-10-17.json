Distinct transitive\nclosures in Fuzzy graphs lead to closures of their isomorphic distance graphs\nwith widely different structural properties. For instance, the All Pairs\nShortest Paths (APSP) problem, based on the Dijkstra algorithm, is equivalent\nto a metric closure, which is only one of the possible ways to calculate\nshortest paths. Understanding and mapping this isomorphism is necessary to\nanalyse models of complex networks based on weighted graphs. Any conclusions\nderived from such models should take into account the distortions imposed on\ngraph topology when converting proximity/strength into distance graphs, to\nsubsequently compute path length and shortest path measures. We characterise\nthe isomorphism using the max-min and Dombi disjunction/conjunction pairs. This\nallows us to: (1) study alternative distance closures, such as those based on\ndiffusion, metric, and ultra-metric distances; (2) identify the operators\nclosest to the metric closure of distance graphs (the APSP), but which are\nlogically consistent; and (3) propose a simple method to compute alternative\ndistance closures using existing algorithms for the APSP. In particular, we\nshow that a specific diffusion distance is promising for community detection in\ncomplex networks, and is based on desirable axioms for logical inference or\napproximate reasoning on networks; it also provides a simple algebraic means to\ncompute diffusion processes on networks. Based on these results, we argue that\nchoosing different distance closures can lead to different conclusions about\nindirect associations on network data, as well as the structure of complex\nnetworks, and are thus important to consider.\n"]}]

Aims: We study the critical rotational influence under which\ndifferential rotation flips from solar-like (fast equator, slow poles) to an\nanti-solar one (slow equator, fast poles). We estimate the non-diffusive\n($\\Lambda$ effect) and diffusive (turbulent viscosity) contributions to the\nReynolds stress. Methods: We present the results of three-dimensional numerical\nsimulations of mildly turbulent convection in spherical wedge geometry.

We regulate the\nconvective velocities by varying the amount of heat transported by thermal\nconduction, turbulent diffusion, and resolved convection. Results: Increasing\nthe efficiency of resolved convection leads to a reduction of the rotational\ninfluence on the flow and a sharp transition from solar-like to anti-solar\ndifferential rotation for Coriolis numbers around 1.3.

First, it\nwas known that there is a family of unary promise problems solvable by quantum\nautomata by using a single qubit, but the number of states required by\ncorresponding one-way deterministic automata cannot be bounded by a constant.\nFor this family, we show that even two-way nondeterminism does not help to save\na single state. By comparing this with the corresponding state complexity of\nalternating machines, we then get a tight exponential gap between two-way\nnondeterministic and one-way alternating automata solving unary promise\nproblems. Second, despite of the existing quadratic gap between Las Vegas\nrealtime probabilistic automata and one-way deterministic automata for language\nrecognition, we show that, by turning to promise problems, the tight gap\nbecomes exponential. Last, we show that the situation is different for one-way\nprobabilistic automata with two-sided bounded-error. We present a family of\nunary promise problems that is very easy for these machines; solvable with only\ntwo states, but the number of states in two-way alternating or any simpler\nautomata is not limited by a constant. Moreover, we show that one-way\nbounded-error probabilistic automata can solve promise problems not solvable at\nall by any other classical model.\n","Comment: 21 pages, significantly improved with a correction (the single\n  sentence statement given just before Corollary 4 in the previous version and\n  (in the conference version) is not correct).

Many of these networks are in general\npartitioned into several components that keep splitting and merging\ncontinuously and unpredictably. We present an algorithm that strives to\nmaintain a forest of spanning trees in such networks, without any kind of\nassumption on the rate of changes. Our algorithm is the adaptation of a\ncoarse-grain interaction algorithm (Casteigts et al., 2013) to the synchronous\nmessage passing model (for dynamic networks). While the high-level principles\nof the coarse-grain variant are preserved, the new algorithm turns out to be\nsignificantly more complex. In particular, it involves a new technique that\nconsists of maintaining a distributed permutation of the set of all nodes IDs\nthroughout the execution. The algorithm also inherits the properties of its\noriginal variant: It relies on purely localized decisions, for which no global\ninformation is ever collected at the nodes, and yet it maintains a number of\ncritical properties whatever the frequency and scale of the changes. In\nparticular, the network remains always covered by a spanning forest in which 1)\nno cycle can ever appear, 2) every node belongs to a tree, and 3) after an\narbitrary number of edge disappearance, all maximal subtrees immediately\nrestore exactly one token (at their root). These properties are ensured\nwhatever the dynamics, even if it keeps going for an arbitrary long period of\ntime. Optimality is not the focus here, however the number of tree per\ncomponents -- the metric of interest here -- eventually converges to one if the\nnetwork stops changing (which is never expected to happen, though). The\nalgorithm correctness is proven and its behavior is tested through\nexperimentation.\n","Comment: A short version appeared in OPODIS 2014"]}]

An approach based on the use of dispersion relations for the flow\nvelocity is developed. It is shown that for an incompressible flow conserving\nvorticity, there exists a decomposition of the velocity field into rotational\nand potential components, such that the restriction of the former to an\narbitrary cross-section of the channel is a functional of the vorticity and\nvelocity distributions over that cross-section, while the latter is\ndivergence-free and bounded downstream thereof. By eliminating the unknown\npotential component with the help of a dispersion relation, a nonlinear\nintegro-differential equation for the flow velocity is obtained. It is then\nanalyzed within an asymptotic expansion in the small ratio v*/U of the friction\nvelocity to the mean flow velocity. Upon statistical averaging in the lowest\nnontrivial order, this equation relates the mean velocity to the\ncross-correlation function of the velocity fluctuations. Analysis of the\nequation reveals existence of two continuous families of solutions, one having\nthe near-wall asymptotic of the form U \\sim ln^p (y/y0), where y is the\ndistance to the wall, p>0 is arbitrary, and the other, U \\sim y^n, with n>0\nalso arbitrary except in the limit n \\to 0 where it turns out to be a universal\nfunction of the Reynolds number, n \\sim 1/ln(Re). It is proved, furthermore,\nthat given a mean velocity distribution having either asymptotic, one can\nalways construct a cross-correlation function so as to satisfy the obtained\nequation. These results are discussed in the light of the existing controversy\nregarding experimental verification of the law of the wall.\n","Comment: 22 pages"]}]

This\nstrategy partitions training into two distinct stages. First, in an\nunsupervised manner, we learn a set of generic dictionaries optimized for\nsparse coding of image patches. We train a multilayer representation via\nrecursive sparse dictionary learning on pooled codes output by earlier layers.\nSecond, we encode all training images with the generic dictionaries and learn a\ntransfer function that optimizes reconstruction of patches extracted from\nannotated ground-truth given the sparse codes of their corresponding image\npatches.
