In this\npaper, we explore the effects of varying $\\beta$ on the cosmological\nconstraints of holographic dark energy (HDE) model. In addition to the SNLS3\ndata, we also use Planck distance prior data of cosmic microwave background\n(CMB), as well as galaxy clustering (GC) data extracted from Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) data release 7 and Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey\n(BOSS). We find that, for the both cases of using SN data alone and using\nSN+CMB+GC data, involving an additional parameter of $\\beta$ can reduce\n$\\chi^2$ by $\\sim$ 36; this shows that $\\beta$ deviates from a constant at\n6$\\sigma$ confidence levels. Adopting SN+CMB+GC data, we find that compared to\nthe constant $\\beta$ case, varying $\\beta$ yields a larger fractional matter\ndensity $\\Omega_{m0}$ and a smaller reduced Hubble constant $h$; moreover,\nvarying $\\beta$ significantly increases the value of HDE model parameter $c$,\nleading to $c\\approx 0.8$, consistent with the constraint results obtained\nbefore Planck. These results indicate that the evolution of $\\beta$ should be\ntaken into account seriously in the cosmological fits. In addition, we find\nthat relative to the differences between the constant $\\beta$ and varying\n$\\beta(z)$ cases, the effects of different light-curve fitters on parameter\nestimation are very small.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 8 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:1310.6109; and text overlap with arXiv:1109.3172 by other authors"]}]

There\nare a number of applications of centrality, including inferring the influence\nor success of an individual in a social network, and the resulting social\nnetwork dynamics. While we can compute the centrality of any node in a given\nnetwork snapshot, a number of applications are also interested in knowing the\npotential importance of an individual in the future. However, current\ncentrality is not necessarily an effective predictor of future centrality.\nWhile there are different measures of centrality, we focus on degree centrality\nin this paper. We develop a method that reconciles preferential attachment and\ntriadic closure to capture a node's prominence profile. We show that the\nproposed node prominence profile method is an effective predictor of degree\ncentrality. Notably, our analysis reveals that individuals in the early stage\nof evolution display a distinctive and robust signature in degree centrality\ntrend, adequately predicted by their prominence profile.

In fact, the particle beam cross section varies along\nthe wiggler. It is usually stated that the effective photon source size\nincreases accordingly, while the brightness is reduced. Here we claim that this\nis a misconception originating from an analysis of the wiggler source based on\ngeometrical arguments, regarded as almost self-evident. According to\nelectrodynamics, depth-of-field effects do not exist: we demonstrate this\nstatement both theoretically and numerically, using a well-known\nfirst-principle computer code. This fact shows that under the usually accepted\napproximations, the description of the wiggler brightness turns out to be\ninconsistent even qualitatively. Therefore, there is a need for a well-defined\nprocedure for computing the brightness from a wiggler source. We accomplish\nthis task based on the use of a Wigner function formalism. In the geometrical\noptics limit computations can be performed analytically. Within this limit, we\nrestrict ourselves to the case of the beam size-dominated regime, which is\ntypical for synchrotron radiation facilities in the X-ray wavelength range. We\ngive a direct demonstration of the fact that the apparent horizontal source\nsize is broadened in proportion to the beamline opening angle and to the length\nof the wiggler. While this effect is well-understood, a direct proof appears\nnot to have been given elsewhere. We consider the problem of the calculation of\nthe wiggler source size by means of numerical simulations alone, which play the\nsame role of an experiment. We report a significant numerical disagreement\nbetween exact calculations and approximations currently used in literature.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1407.4591"]}]
