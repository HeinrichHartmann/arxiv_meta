This is because robustness requires discarding of information in\norder to reduce the sensitivity to outliers. The principal of nonlinear\nstatistical coupling, which is an interpretation of the Tsallis entropy\ngeneralization, can be used to quantify this trade-off. The coupled-surprisal,\n-ln_k (p)=-(p^k-1)/k, is a generalization of Shannon surprisal or the\nlogarithmic scoring rule, given a forecast p of a true event by an inferencing\nalgorithm. The coupling parameter k=1-q, where q is the Tsallis entropy index,\nis the degree of nonlinear coupling between statistical states. Positive\n(negative) values of nonlinear coupling decrease (increase) the surprisal\ninformation metric and thereby biases the risk in favor of decisive (robust)\nalgorithms relative to the Shannon surprisal (k=0). We show that translating\nthe average coupled-surprisal to an effective probability is equivalent to\nusing the generalized mean of the true event probabilities as a scoring rule.\nThe metric is used to assess the robustness, accuracy, and decisiveness of a\nfusion algorithm.

Quantum error correction provides this\nprotection, by distributing a logical state among many physical qubits via\nquantum entanglement. Superconductivity is an appealing platform, as it allows\nfor constructing large quantum circuits, and is compatible with\nmicrofabrication. For superconducting qubits the surface code is a natural\nchoice for error correction, as it uses only nearest-neighbour coupling and\nrapidly-cycled entangling gates.

Highlights of the past year\ninclude a change in the measurement of the suppression of large transverse\nmomentum ($p_T$) particles in the Quark Gluon Plasma to a measure of the\nfractional shift in the observed $p_T$ spectrum from the expected A+A spectrum\nfor independent collisions as an estimate of the energy loss in the medium. The\np+Pb run at LHC in early 2013 spurred new or improved measurements in d+Au at\nRHIC which included the observation of elliptical flow in d+Au collisions and\nmeasurements of transverse energy ($E_T$) spectra in p-p, d+Au and Au+Au\ncollisions at 200 GeV nucleon-nucleon c.m. energy which demonstrated that\nconstituent quarks are the fundamental element of particle production in all 3\nsystems. Measurements of identified hadrons in d+Au show a huge Cronin effect\nfor protons but no effect for mesons.

The algorithmic\nstudy of ergodic games was initiated in a seminal work of Hoffman and Karp in\n1966, but all basic complexity questions have remained unresolved. Our main\nresults for ergodic games are as follows: We establish (1) an optimal\nexponential bound on the patience of stationary strategies (where patience of a\ndistribution is the inverse of the smallest positive probability and represents\na complexity measure of a stationary strategy); (2) the approximation problem\nlie in FNP; (3) the approximation problem is at least as hard as the decision\nproblem for simple stochastic games (for which NP intersection coNP is the\nlong-standing best known bound). We present a variant of the strategy-iteration\nalgorithm by Hoffman and Karp; show that both our algorithm and the classical\nvalue-iteration algorithm can approximate the value in exponential time; and\nidentify a subclass where the value-iteration algorithm is a FPTAS. We also\nshow that the exact value can be expressed in the existential theory of the\nreals, and establish square-root sum hardness for a related class of games.\n"]}]

We used two extensive datasets to\nevaluate alternative hypotheses for recently reported changes in the observed\nbody size of plethodontid salamanders.

RR scheduling algorithm is considered as the most\nwidely used scheduling algorithm in research because the TQ is equally shared\namong the processes. In this paper a newly proposed variant of RR algorithm\ncalled Min-Max Round Robin (MMRR) scheduling algorithm is presented. The idea\nof this MMRR is to make the TQ repeatedly adjusted using Min-Max dispersion\nmeasure in accordance with remaining CPU burst time. Our experimental analysis\nshows that MMRR performs much better than RR algorithm in terms of average\nturnaround time, average waiting time and number of context switches.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 15 figures.

While\nthere are a variety of metrics that can be used to specify the quality of a\ngiven community, one common theme is that flows tend to stay within\ncommunities. Hence, we expect cycles to play an important role in community\ndetection. For undirected graphs, the importance of triangles -- an undirected\n3-cycle -- has been known for a long time and can be used to improve community\ndetection. In directed graphs, the situation is more nuanced. The smallest\ncycle is simply two nodes with a reciprocal connection, and using information\nabout reciprocation has proven to improve community detection. Our new idea is\nbased on the four types of directed triangles that contain cycles. To identify\ncommunities in directed networks, then, we propose an undirected edge-weighting\nscheme based on the type of the directed triangles in which edges are involved.\nWe also propose a new metric on quality of the communities that is based on the\nnumber of 3-cycles that are split across communities. To demonstrate the impact\nof our new weighting, we use the standard METIS graph partitioning tool to\ndetermine communities and show experimentally that the resulting communities\nresult in fewer 3-cycles being cut.
