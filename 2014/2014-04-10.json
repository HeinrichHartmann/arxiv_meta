In this work, we show that the constants appearing in the\n\"temporal Schwarzschild\", \"spatial Schwarzschild\" and\n\"Reissner-Nordstr{\\\"o}m-like\" exteriors are not arbitrary but are completely\ndetermined by star's parameters, like the equation of state and the\ngravitational potential. Consequently, in the braneworld scenario the\ngravitational field outside of a star is no longer determined by the total mass\nalone, but also depends on the details of the internal structure of the source.\nWe show that the general relativistic upper bound on the gravitational\npotential $M/R < 4/9$, for perfect fluid stars, is significantly increased in\nthese exteriors. Namely, $M/R < 1/2$, $M/R < 2/3$ and $M/R < 1$ for the\ntemporal Schwarzschild, spatial Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr{\\\"o}m-like\nexteriors, respectively. Regarding the surface gravitational redshift, we find\nthat the general relativistic Schwarzschild exterior as well as the braneworld\nspatial Schwarzschild exterior lead to the same upper bound, viz., $Z < 2$.\nHowever, when the external spacetime is the temporal Schwarzschild metric or\nthe Reissner-Nordstr{\\\"o}m-like exterior there is no such constraint: $Z <\n\\infty$. This infinite difference in the limiting value of $Z$ is because for\nthese exteriors the effective pressure at the surface is negative.

Thus, our model provides a novel theory for these\nobserved biological phenomena within the unified context of bistability.\nImportantly, as Fas interactions initiate the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, our\nmodel also suggests a mechanism by which cells may function as bistable\nlife/death switches independently of any such dynamics in their downstream\ncomponents.

Under these conditions, the\nmaterial-inherent sources of noise start to play a crucial role. In most cases,\nquantum devices are affected by noise decreasing with frequency, f,\napproximately as 1/f.

The analysis suggests that the most likely cause of the discrepancy\nis that the dust is being charged by the solar wind, then being affected by the\ninterplanetary magnetic field via the Lorentz force. Though this effect has\nbeen explored previously, if correct, this seems to be the first time that the\nLorentz force has been required to model a cometary dust tail.
