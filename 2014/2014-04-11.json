Often this quantity to be measured is smeared by\na non-ideal detector response or by some physical process. The procedure of\nremoving this smearing effect from the measured distribution is called\nunfolding, and is a delicate problem in signal processing, due to the\nwell-known numerical ill behavior of this task. Various methods were invented\nwhich, given some assumptions on the initial probability distribution, try to\nregularize the unfolding problem. Most of these methods definitely introduce\nbias into the estimate of the initial probability distribution. We propose a\nlinear iterative method, which has the advantage that no assumptions on the\ninitial probability distribution is needed, and the only regularization\nparameter is the stopping order of the iteration, which can be used to choose\nthe best compromise between the introduced bias and the propagated statistical\nand systematic errors. The method is consistent: \"binwise\" convergence to the\ninitial probability distribution is proved in absence of measurement errors\nunder a quite general condition on the response function. This condition holds\nfor practical applications such as convolutions, calorimeter response\nfunctions, momentum reconstruction response functions based on tracking in\nmagnetic field etc. In presence of measurement errors, explicit formulae for\nthe propagation of the three important error terms is provided: bias error,\nstatistical error, and systematic error. A trade-off between these three error\nterms can be used to define an optimal iteration stopping criterion, and the\nerrors can be estimated there. We provide a numerical C library for the\nimplementation of the method, which incorporates automatic statistical error\npropagation as well.\n","Comment: Proceedings of ACAT-2011 conference (Uxbridge, United Kingdom), 9\n  pages, 5 figures, changes of corrigendum included"]}]

We define social resilience as the ability of a community to\nwithstand changes. We do not argue about the cause of such changes, but\nconcentrate on their impact. Changes may cause users to leave, which may\ntrigger further leaves of others who lost connection to their friends. This may\nlead to cascades of users leaving. A social network is said to be resilient if\nthe size of such cascades can be limited. To quantify resilience, we use the\nk-core analysis, to identify subsets of the network in which all users have at\nleast k friends. These connections generate benefits (b) for each user, which\nhave to outweigh the costs (c) of being a member of the network. If this\ndifference is not positive, users leave. After all cascades, the remaining\nnetwork is the k-core of the original network determined by the cost-to-benefit\nc/b ratio. By analysing the cumulative distribution of k-cores we are able to\ncalculate the number of users remaining in each community. This allows us to\ninfer the impact of the c/b ratio on the resilience of these online\ncommunities. We find that the different online communities have different\nk-core distributions. Consequently, similar changes in the c/b ratio have a\ndifferent impact on the amount of active users. As a case study, we focus on\nthe evolution of Friendster. We identify time periods when new users entering\nthe network observed an insufficient c/b ratio. This measure can be seen as a\nprecursor of the later collapse of the community. Our analysis can be applied\nto estimate the impact of changes in the user interface, which may temporarily\nincrease the c/b ratio, thus posing a threat for the community to shrink, or\neven to collapse.\n","Comment: Submitted, 22 February 2013"]}]

In this work, we demonstrate how key features arising from\noptical supersymmetry can be exploited to control the flow of light for mode\ndivision multiplexing applications. Superpartner configurations are\nexperimentally realized in coupled optical networks, and the corresponding\nlight dynamics in such systems are directly observed. We show that SUSY can be\njudiciously utilized to remove the fundamental mode of a multimode optical\nstructure, while establishing global phase matching conditions for the\nremaining set of modes. Along these lines, supersymmetry may serve as a\npromising platform for a new generation of versatile optical components with\nnovel properties and functionalities.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 4 figures"]}]

This\nalignment is dependent on galaxy properties, such that red satellites are more\nstrongly aligned than blue satellites. Theoretical work done to interpret this\nphenomena has found that it is due to the non-spherical nature of dark matter\nhalos. However, most studies over-predict the alignment signal under the\nassumption that the central galaxy shape follows the shape of the host halo. It\nis also not clear whether the color dependence of alignment is due to an\nassembly bias or an evolution effect. In this paper we study these problems\nusing a cosmological N-body simulation. Subhalos are used to trace the\npositions of satellite galaxies. It is found that the shape of dark matter\nhalos are mis-aligned at different radii. If the central galaxy shares the same\nshape as the inner host halo, then the alignment effect is weaker and agrees\nwith observational data. However, it predicts almost no dependence of alignment\non the color of satellite galaxies, though the late accreted subhalos show\nstronger alignment with the outer layer of the host halo than their early\naccreted counterparts. We find that this is due to the limitation of pure\nN-body simulations that satellites galaxies without associated subhalos\n('orphan galaxies') are not resolved.

Fiber\nbased backhaul offers the high rates needed to meet this requirement, but is\ncostly and time-consuming to deploy, when not readily available. Wireless\nbackhaul is an attractive option for small cells as it provides a less\nexpensive and easy-to-deploy alternative to fiber. However, there are multitude\nof bands and features (e.g. LOS/NLOS, spatial multiplexing etc.) associated\nwith wireless backhaul that need to be used intelligently for small cells.\nCandidate bands include: sub-6 GHz band that is useful in non-line-of-sight\n(NLOS) scenarios, microwave band (6-42 GHz) that is useful in point-to-point\nline-of-sight (LOS) scenarios, and millimeter wave bands (e.g. 60, 70 and 80\nGHz) that are recently being commercially used in LOS scenarios.

We calculated the team skill of each graph using a\nright-hand eigenvector centrality measure. This way, teams that beat good teams\nwill be ranked higher than teams that beat mediocre teams. The eigenvector\ncentrality rankings for most years were well correlated with tournament\nperformance and poll-based rankings. We assumed that the relationship between\ncoach skill $C_s$, player skill $P_s$, and team skill $T_s$ was $C_s \\cdot P_s\n= T_s$. We then created a function to describe the probability that a given\nscore difference would occur based on player skill and coach skill. We\nmultiplied the probabilities of all edges in the network together to find the\nprobability that the correct network would occur with any given player skill\nand coach skill matrix. We was able to determine player skill as a function of\nteam skill and coach skill, eliminating the need to optimize two unknown\nmatrices. The top five coaches in each year were noted, and the top coach of\nall time was calculated by dividing the number of times that coach ranked in\nthe yearly top five by the years said coach had been active.\n","Comment: 18 pages, Submitted to the 2014 Mathematical Contest in Modeling\n  (MCM)"]}]
