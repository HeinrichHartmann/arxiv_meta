The\nalgorithm is based on successive selection-mutation steps performed on the\nsystem in a controlled way.

We investigate first the convergence in law of the\nalgorithm as a function of the timestep for several simple stochastic models.\nSecond, we consider the average duration of reactive trajectories for which no\ntheoretical predictions exist. The most important aspect of this work concerns\nsome systems with two degrees of freedom. They are studied in details as a\nfunction of the reaction coordinate in the asymptotic regime where the number\nof trajectories goes to infinity. We show that during phase transitions, the\nstatistics of the algorithm deviate significatively from known theoretical\nresults when using non-optimal reaction coordinates. In this case, the variance\nof the algorithm is peaking at the transition and the convergence of the\nalgorithm can be much slower than the usual expected central limit behavior.\nThe duration of trajectories is affected as well. Moreover, reactive\ntrajectories do not correspond to the most probable ones. Such behavior\ndisappears when using the optimal reaction coordinate called committor as\npredicted by the theory.

I generalize these results in two ways. First, I show\nthat SWAP is only one in a large family of gates that uplift matchgates to\nquantum universality. In fact, I show that the set of all matchgates plus any\nnonmatchgate parity-preserving two-qubit gate is universal, and interpret this\nfact in terms of local invariants of two-qubit gates. Second, I investigate the\npower of matchgates in arbitrary connectivity graphs, showing they are\nuniversal on any connected graph other than a path or a cycle, and classically\nsimulable on a cycle.

EONs use fine granular frequency slots or flexible\ngrids, when compared to the conventional fixed grid networks and therefore\nutilize the frequency spectrum efficiently. For providing survivability in\nEONs, we consider a recently proposed survivability method for conventional\nfixed grid networks, known as pre-configured backup protection with sharing\n(PBPS), because of its benefits over the traditional survivability approaches\nsuch as dedicated and shared protection. In PBPS, backup paths can be\npre-configured and at the same time they can share resources. Therefore, both\nshort recovery time and efficient resource usage can be achieved. We find that\nthe existing switch architectures do not support both PBPS and EONs.\nSpecifically, we identify and illustrate that, if a switch architecture is not\ncarefully designed, several key problems/issues might arise in certain\nscenarios. Such problems include unnecessary resource consumption, inability of\nusing existing free resources, and incapability of sharing backup paths. These\nproblems appear when PBPS is adopted in EONs and they do not arise in fixed\ngrid networks. In this paper, we propose new switch architectures which support\nboth PBPS and EONs.

For the same relative values\nof d/P, triangular-lattice PCFs show higher birefringence whereas the\nsquare-lattice PCFs show a wider range of single-mode operation. Square-lattice\nPCF was found to be endlessly single-mode for higher air-filling fraction\n(d/P). Smaller lengths of triangular-lattice PCF are required for dispersion\ncompensation whereas PCFs with square-lattice with nearer relative dispersion\nslope (RDS) can better compensate the broadband dispersion. Square-lattice PCFs\nshow ZDW red-shifted, making it preferable for mid-IR supercontinuum generation\n(SCG) with highly non-linear chalcogenide material. Square-lattice PCFs show\nhigher dispersion slope that leads to compression of the broadband, thus\naccumulating more power in the pulse. On the other hand, triangular-lattice PCF\nwith flat dispersion profile can generate broader SCG. Square-lattice PCF with\nlow Group Velocity Dispersion (GVD) at the anomalous dispersion corresponds to\nhigher dispersion length and higher degree of solitonic interaction. The\neffective area of square-lattice PCF is always greater than its\ntriangular-lattice counterpart making it better suited for high power\napplications. Smaller length of symmetric-core PCF for dispersion compensation,\nwhile broadband dispersion compensation can be better performed with\nasymmetric-core PCF. Mid-Infrared SCG can be better performed with\nasymmetric-core PCF with compressed and high power pulse, while wider range of\nSCG can be performed with symmetric core PCF.
