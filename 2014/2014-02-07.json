In many applications of EIT, such as monitoring the heart and\nlungs of unconscious intensive care patients or locating the focus of an\nepileptic seizure, data acquisition on the entire boundary of the body is\nimpractical, restricting the boundary area available for EIT measurements. An\nextension of the D-bar method to the case when data is collected only on a\nsubset of the boundary is studied by computational simulation. The approach is\nbased on solving a boundary integral equation for the traces of the CGOs using\nlocalized basis functions (Haar wavelets). The numerical evidence suggests that\nthe D-bar method can be applied to partial-boundary data in dimension two and\nthat the traces of the partial data CGOs approximate the full data CGO\nsolutions on the available portion of the boundary, for the necessary small $k$\nfrequencies.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 12 figures"]}]

During the accretion stage, the system is\ncalled a low-mass X-ray binary, and bright X-ray emission is observed. When the\nrate of mass transfer decreases in the later evolutionary stages, these\nbinaries host a radio millisecond pulsar whose emission is powered by the\nneutron star's rotating magnetic field. This evolutionary model is supported by\nthe detection of millisecond X-ray pulsations from several accreting neutron\nstars and also by the evidence for a past accretion disc in a rotation-powered\nmillisecond pulsar. It has been proposed that a rotation-powered pulsar may\ntemporarily switch on during periods of low mass inflow in some such systems.\nOnly indirect evidence for this transition has hitherto been observed.

We propose that option prices under the real-world measure are not\nmartingales, but that their drift is governed by such tail risk premia.

Having to surpass and deal with these difficulties\nthat arise with their condition is something that we can help diminish. They\nare one sense down when trying to understand their surrounding environments and\ngather information about what is happening around them. Nowadays, mobile\ndevices present significant computing and technological capacity which has been\nincreasing to the point where it is very common for most people to have access\nto a device with Bluetooth, GPS, Wi-Fi, and both high processing and storage\ncapacities. This allows us to think of applications that can do so much to help\npeople with difficulties. In the particular case of blind people, the lack of\nvisual information can be bypassed with other contextual information retrieved\nby their own personal devices. Our goal is to provide information to blind\nusers, be able to give them information about the context that surrounds them.\nWe wanted to provide the blind users with the tools to create information and\nbe able to share this information between each other, information about people,\nlocations or objects. Our approach was to split the project into a data and\ninformation gathering phase where we did our field search and interviewed and\nelaborated on how is the situation of environment perception for blind users,\nfollowed by a technical phase where we implement a system based on the first\nstage. Our results gathered from both the collecting phase and our implementing\nphase showed that there is potential to use these tools in the blind community\nand that they welcome the possibilities and horizons that it opens them.\n","Comment: 93 pages, MSc Thesis, University of Lisbon"]}]

Comets are given initial orbits with perihelion distances\nbetween 5 and 36 AU, and evolve under planetary, stellar and Galactic\nperturbations for 4.5 Gyr. This process leads to the formation of an Oort cloud\n(which we define as the region of semimajor axes a>1000 AU), and to a flux of\ncometary bodies from the Oort cloud returning to the planetary region at the\npresent epoch. The results are consistent with the dynamical characteristics of\nshort-period comets and other observed cometary populations: the near-parabolic\nflux, Centaurs, and high-eccentricity trans-Neptunian objects. To achieve this\nconsistency with observations, the model requires that the number of comets\nversus initial perihelion distance is concentrated towards the outer planetary\nregion. Moreover, the mean physical lifetime of observable comets in the inner\nplanetary region (q<2.5 AU) at the present epoch should be an increasing\nfunction of the comets' initial perihelion distances. Virtually all observed\nHalley-type comets and nearly half of observed Jupiter-family comets come from\nthe Oort cloud, and initially (4.5 Gyr ago) from orbits concentrated near the\nouter planetary region.

Many GP maps share the following general properties: 1) The\nnumber of genotypes $N_G$ is much larger than the number of selectable\nphenotypes; 2) Neutral exploration changes the variation that is accessible to\nthe population; 3) The distribution of phenotype frequencies $F_p=N_p/N_G$,\nwith $N_p$ the number of genotypes mapping onto phenotype $p$, is highly\nbiased: the majority of genotypes map to only a small minority of the\nphenotypes.

For both maps the probability of a mutation leading to a phenotype $p$\nscales to first order as $F_p$, although for the RNA map there are further\ncorrelations as well. By using mean-field theory, supported by computer\nsimulations, we show that the discovery time $T_p$ of a phenotype $p$ similarly\nscales to first order as $1/F_p$ for a wide range of population sizes and\nmutation rates in both the monomorphic and polymorphic regimes. These\ndifferences in the rate at which variation arises can vary over many orders of\nmagnitude. Phenotypic variation with a larger $F_p$ is therefore be much more\nlikely to arise than variation with a small $F_p$. We show, using the RNA\nmodel, that frequent phenotypes (with larger $F_p$) can fix in a population\neven when alternative, but less frequent, phenotypes with much higher fitness\nare potentially accessible. In other words, if the fittest never `arrive' on\nthe timescales of evolutionary change, then they can't fix.
