Patterns of\nisolation-by-distance are usually caused by local spatial dispersal, which\nexplains why differences of allele frequencies between populations accumulate\nwith distance. However, spatial variations of demographic parameters such as\nmigration rate or population density can generate non-stationary patterns of\nisolation-by-distance where the rate at which genetic differentiation\naccumulates varies across space. To characterize non-stationary patterns of\nisolation-by-distance, we infer local genetic differentiation based on Bayesian\nkriging. Local genetic differentiation for a sampled population is defined as\nthe average genetic differentiation between the sampled population and fictive\nneighboring populations. To avoid defining populations in advance, the method\ncan also be applied at the scale of individuals making it relevant for\nlandscape genetics. Inference of local genetic differentiation relies on a\nmatrix of pairwise similarity or dissimilarity between populations or\nindividuals such as matrices of FST between pairs of populations.

II. Expected fluxes of energetic\n  neutral He atoms from the heliosheath"],"description":["  Aims. A model of heliosheath density and energy spectra of alpha-particles\nand He+ ions carried by the solar wind is developed. Neutralization of\nheliosheath He+ ions, mainly by charge exchange (CX) with neutral interstellar\nH and He atoms, gives rise to ~0.2 - ~100 keV fluxes of energetic neutral He\natoms (He ENA). Such fluxes, if observed, would give information about plasmas\nin the heliosheath and heliospheric tail. Methods. Helium ions crossing the\ntermination shock (TS) constitute suprathermal (test) particles convected by\n(locally also diffusing through) hydrodynamically calculated background plasma\nflows (three versions of flows are employed). The He ions proceed from the TS\ntowards heliopause (HP) and finally to the heliospheric tail (HT). Calculations\nof the evolution of alpha- and He+ particle densities and energy spectra\ninclude binary interactions with background plasma and interstellar atoms,\nadiabatic heating (cooling) resulting from flow compression (rarefaction), and\nCoulomb scattering on background plasma. Results. Neutralization of\nsuprathermal He ions leads to the emergence of He ENA fluxes with energy\nspectra modified by the Compton-Getting effect at emission and ENA loss during\nflight to the Sun. Energy-integrated He ENA intensities are in the range ~0.05\n- ~50 cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1 depending on spectra at the TS (assumed\nkappa-distributions), background plasma model, and look direction. The\ntail/apex intensity ratio varies between ~1.8 and ~800 depending on model\nassumptions. Energy spectra are broad with maxima in the ~0.2 - ~3 keV range\ndepending on the look direction and model. Conclusions. Expected heliosheath He\nENA fluxes may be measurable based on the capabilities of the IBEX spacecraft.\nData could offer insight into the heliosheath structure and improve\nunderstanding of the post-TS solar wind plasmas.

As a result, we provide combinatorial\nformulas for the two unidentified power series $B_1(q)$ and $B_2(q)$ appearing\nin the G\\\"ottsche-Yau-Zaslow formula.\n  The proof of our linearity result is completely combinatorial. We define\n$\\tau$-graphs which generalize long-edge graphs, and a closely related family\nof combinatorial objects we call $(\\tau, n)$-words. By introducing height\nfunctions and a concept of irreducibility, we describe ways to decompose\ncertain families of $(\\tau, n)$-words into irreducible words, which leads to\nthe desired results.\n","Comment: 38 pages, 1 figure, 1 table.

Motions in the fluid are driven by differential\nrotation of the outer metallic shell, which we refer to as \"the wall\". The two\nhemispheres of the wall are held in counter-rotation, producing a steady,\naxisymmetric interior flow consisting of differential rotation and a two-cell\nmeridional circulation with radial inflow in the equatorial plane. From\nprevious studies, this type of flow is known to maintain a stationary\nequatorial dipole by dynamo action if the magnetic Reynolds number is larger\nthan about 300 and if the outer boundary is electrically insulating. We vary\nindependently the thickness, electrical conductivity, and magnetic permeability\nof the wall to determine their effect on the dynamo action. The main results\nare: (a) Increasing the conductivity of the wall hinders the dynamo by allowing\neddy currents within the wall, which are induced by the relative motion of the\nequatorial dipole field and the wall. This processes can be viewed as a skin\neffect or, equivalently, as the tearing apart of the dipole by the differential\nrotation of the wall, to which the field lines are anchored by high\nconductivity. (b) Increasing the magnetic permeability of the wall favors\ndynamo action by constraining the magnetic field lines in the fluid to be\nnormal to the wall, thereby decoupling the fluid from any induction in the\nwall. (c) Decreasing the wall thickness limits the amplitude of the eddy\ncurrents, and is therefore favorable for dynamo action, provided that the wall\nis thinner than the skin depth. We explicitly demonstrate these effects of the\nwall properties on the dynamo field by deriving an effective boundary condition\nin the limit of vanishing wall thickness.\n","Comment: accepted for publication in Physical Review E"]}]

The growth process of dust particles in protoplanetary disks can be\nmodeled via numerical dust coagulation codes. In this approach, physical\neffects that dominate the dust growth process often must be implemented in a\nparameterized form. Due to a lack of these parameterizations, existing studies\nof dust coagulation have ignored the effects a hydrodynamical gas flow can have\non grain growth, even though it is often argued that the flow could\nsignificantly contribute either positively or negatively to the growth process.\n  Aims. We intend to provide a quantification of hydrodynamical effects on the\ngrowth of dust particles, such that these effects can be parameterized and\nimplemented in a dust coagulation code.\n  Methods. We numerically integrate the trajectories of small dust particles in\nthe flow of disk gas around a proto-planetesimal, sampling a large parameter\nspace in proto-planetesimal radii, headwind velocities, and dust stopping\ntimes.\n  Results. The gas flow deflects most particles away from the\nproto-planetesimal, such that its effective collisional cross section, and\ntherefore the mass accretion rate, is reduced. The gas flow however also\nreduces the impact velocity of small dust particles onto a proto-planetesimal.\nThis can be beneficial for its growth, since large impact velocities are known\nto lead to erosion. We also demonstrate why such a gas flow does not return\ncollisional debris to the surface of a proto-planetesimal.\n  Conclusions. We predict that a laminar hydrodynamical flow around a\nproto-planetesimal will have a significant effect on its growth. However, we\ncannot easily predict which result, the reduction of the impact velocity or the\nsweep-up cross section, will be more important. Therefore, we provide\nparameterizations ready for implementation into a dust coagulation code.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures; accepted for publication in A&A; v2 matches the\n  manuscript sent to the publisher (very minor changes)"]}]

Research over the past three decades has revolutionized cosmology\nwhile supporting the standard cosmological model. However, the cosmological\nprinciple of Universal homogeneity and isotropy has always been in question,\nsince structures as large as the survey size have always been found each time\nthe survey size has increased. Until 2013, the largest known structure in our\nUniverse was the Sloan Great Wall, which is more than 400 Mpc long located\napproximately one billion light years away.\n  Aims. Gamma-ray bursts are the most energetic explosions in the Universe. As\nthey are associated with the stellar endpoints of massive stars and are found\nin and near distant galaxies, they are viable indicators of the dense part of\nthe Universe containing normal matter. The spatial distribution of gamma-ray\nbursts can thus help expose the large scale structure of the Universe.\n  Methods. As of July 2012, 283 GRB redshifts have been measured. Subdividing\nthis sample into nine radial parts, each containing 31 GRBs, indicates that the\nGRB sample having 1.6 < z < 2.1 differs significantly from the others in that\n14 of the 31 GRBs are concentrated in roughly 1/8 of the sky. A two-dimensional\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test, a nearest-neighbour test, and a Bootstrap Point-Radius\nMethod explore the significance of this clustering.\n  Results. All tests used indicate that there is a statistically significant\nclustering of the GRB sample at 1.6 < z < 2.1. Furthermore, this angular excess\ncannot be entirely attributed to known selection biases, making its existence\ndue to chance unlikely.\n  Conclusions. This huge structure lies ten times farther away than the Sloan\nGreat Wall, at a distance of approximately ten billion light years. The size of\nthe structure defined by these GRBs is about 2000-3000 Mpc, or more than six\ntimes the size of the Sloan Great Wall.\n","Comment: accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics"]}]

This is the problem of deciding\nwhether or not the ideal system is an abstraction of the attacked system. A\nquantitative variation of this question can capture how much the attacked\nsystem deviates from the ideal. Thus, algorithms for deciding abstraction\nrelations can help measure the effect of attacks on cyberphysical systems and\nto develop attack detection strategies. In this paper, we present a decision\nprocedure for proving that one nonlinear dynamical system is a quantitative\nabstraction of another. Directly computing the reach sets of these nonlinear\nsystems are undecidable in general and reach set over-approximations do not\ngive a direct way for proving abstraction. Our procedure uses (possibly\ninaccurate) numerical simulations and a model annotation to compute tight\napproximations of the observable behaviors of the system and then uses these\napproximations to decide on abstraction. We show that the procedure is sound\nand that it is guaranteed to terminate under reasonable robustness assumptions.\n"]}]

The spiral galaxies studied so far show a similar\nmagnetic field pattern which is of spiral shape along the disk plane and\nX-shaped in the halo, sometimes accompanied by strong vertical fields above and\nbelow the central region of the disk. The strength of the halo field is\ncomparable to that of the disk. The total and turbulent magnetic field strength\nis (weakly) increasing with the star formation. There are, however, indications\nthat stronger star formation reduces the magnetic field regularity globally.\nThe magnetic field in spiral galaxies is generally thought to be amplified and\nmaintained by dynamo action. During the galaxy's formation and evolution the\nturbulent dynamo amplifies the field strength to energy equipartition with the\nturbulent gas, while the large-scale (mean-field) dynamo mainly orders the\nmagnetic field. Hence, the large-scale magnetic field pattern evolves with\ntime. Supernova explosions causes a further continuous injection of turbulent\nmagnetic fields. Assuming that this small-scale field injection is situated\nonly within the spiral arm region where star formation mostly occurs lead to a\nlarge-scale field structure in which the magnetic field regularity is stronger\nin the interarm region as observed in several nearby spiral galaxies. The\ndetection of similar scale heights in several spiral galaxies of different\nHubble type star formation implies a relation between the galactic wind, the\ntotal magnetic field strength and the star formation in the galaxy. A galactic\nwind may be essential for an effective dynamo action. Strong tidal interaction,\nhowever, seems to disturb the balance leading to deviating and locally\ndifferent scale heights as observed in M82 and NGC~4631.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 6 figures, 1 table"]}]

Our XMM-Newton data of RS Cae are clearly dominated by soft X-ray\nemission. The X-ray light curves are shaped by emission from the main accretion\nregion, which is visible over the whole orbital cycle, interrupted only by a\nstream eclipse. The optical light curves are formed by cyclotron and stream\nemission. The XMM-Newton X-ray spectra comprise a black-body-like and a plasma\ncomponent at mean temperatures of 36eV and 7keV.

This constraint is strong enough to fix uniquely the first few\nsubleading terms of the action.

The theme of the MANIAC Challenge 2013 was ``Mobile Data\nOffloading,'' and consisted on developing and comparatively evaluating\nstrategies to offload infrastructure access points via customer ad hoc\nforwarding using handheld devices (e.g., tablets and smartphones). According to\nthe challenge rules, a hop-by-hop bidding contest (or ``auction'') should\ndecide the path of each data packet towards its destination. Consequently, each\nteam should rely on other teams' willingness to forward packets for them in\norder to get their traffic across the network. In this application scenario,\nthe incentive for customers to join the ad hoc network is discounted monthly\nfees, while operators should benefit from decreased infrastructure costs.\nFollowing the rules of MANIAC Challenge 2013, this paper proposes a strategy\nthat is based on the concept of how ``tight'' a node is to successfully deliver\na packet to its destination within a given deadline.

This economic point of view also takes\nplace in the determination of goods and services in wireless networks. Indeed,\nbefore transmitting customer data, a network operator has to lease some\nfrequency range from a spectrum owner and also has to establish agreements with\nelectricity suppliers. The goal of this paper is to compare two pricing\nschemes, namely a power-based and a flat rate, and give a possible explanation\nwhy flat rate pricing schemes are more common than power based pricing ones in\na deregulated wireless market. We suggest a hierarchical game-theoretical model\nof a three level supply chain: the end users, the service provider and the\nspectrum owner. The end users intend to transmit data on a wireless network.\nThe amount of traffic sent by the end users depends on the available frequency\nbandwidth as well as the price they have to pay for their transmission. A\nnatural question arises for the service provider: how to design an efficient\npricing scheme in order to maximize his profit. Moreover he has to take into\naccount the lease charge he has to pay to the spectrum owner and how many\nfrequency bandwidth to rent. The spectrum owner itself also looks for\nmaximizing its profit and has to determine the lease price to the service\nprovider. The equilibrium at each level of our supply chain model are\nestablished and several properties are investigated. In particular, in the case\nof a power-based pricing scheme, the service provider and the spectrum owner\ntend to share the gross provider profit. Whereas, considering the flat rate\npricing scheme, if the end users are going to exploit the network intensively,\nthen the tariffs of the suppliers (spectrum owner and service provider)\nexplode.\n","Comment: This is the last draft version of the paper.
