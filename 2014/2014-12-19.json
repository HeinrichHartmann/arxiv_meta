Most of the relevant\nliterature focuses on holistic descriptors in closed-set identification\napplications. The underlying assumption in SR-based methods is that each class\nin the gallery has sufficient samples and the query lies on the subspace\nspanned by the gallery of the same class. Unfortunately, such assumption is\neasily violated in the more challenging face verification scenario, where an\nalgorithm is required to determine if two faces (where one or both have not\nbeen seen before) belong to the same person. In this paper, we first discuss\nwhy previous attempts with SR might not be applicable to verification problems.\nWe then propose an alternative approach to face verification via SR.\nSpecifically, we propose to use explicit SR encoding on local image patches\nrather than the entire face. The obtained sparse signals are pooled via\naveraging to form multiple region descriptors, which are then concatenated to\nform an overall face descriptor. Due to the deliberate loss spatial relations\nwithin each region (caused by averaging), the resulting descriptor is robust to\nmisalignment & various image deformations. Within the proposed framework, we\nevaluate several SR encoding techniques: l1-minimisation, Sparse Autoencoder\nNeural Network (SANN), and an implicit probabilistic technique based on\nGaussian Mixture Models. Thorough experiments on AR, FERET, exYaleB, BANCA and\nChokePoint datasets show that the proposed local SR approach obtains\nconsiderably better and more robust performance than several previous\nstate-of-the-art holistic SR methods, in both verification and closed-set\nidentification problems.

We explicitly quantify several inherent fundamental limits\non the best achievable levels of performance in linear consensus networks and\nshow that these limits of performance are merely imposed by the specific\nstructure of the underlying graphs. Furthermore, we discover new connections\nbetween notions of sparsity and the performance measure. Particularly, we\ncharacterize several fundamental tradeoffs that reveal interplay between the\nperformance measure and various sparsity measures of a linear consensus\nnetwork. At the end, we apply our results to two real-world dynamical networks\nand provide energy interpretations for the proposed performance measures. It is\nshown that the total power loss in synchronous power networks and total kinetic\nenergy of a network of autonomous vehicles in a formation are viable\nperformance measure for these networks and fundamental limits on these measures\nquantify the best achievable levels of energy-efficiency in these dynamical\nnetworks.\n","Comment: 41-pages, One Column"]}]

To\novercome the significant propagation loss over distance, employing\nmulti-antennas at the energy transmitter (ET) to more efficiently direct\nwireless energy to desired energy receivers (ERs), termed \\emph{energy\nbeamforming}, is an essential technique for enabling WET. However, the\nachievable gain of energy beamforming crucially depends on the available\nchannel state information (CSI) at the ET, which needs to be acquired\npractically. In this paper, we study the design of an efficient channel\nacquisition method for a point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)\nWET system by exploiting the channel reciprocity, i.e., the ET estimates the\nCSI via dedicated reverse-link training from the ER. Considering the limited\nenergy availability at the ER, the training strategy should be carefully\ndesigned so that the channel can be estimated with sufficient accuracy, and yet\nwithout consuming excessive energy at the ER. To this end, we propose to\nmaximize the \\emph{net} harvested energy at the ER, which is the average\nharvested energy offset by that used for channel training.

Though the literature demonstrates a set of variegated\nvisual cues to detect or evaluate the absence or presence of sharpness, we\nemphasize in the current work that high frequency content and local standard\ndeviation can form strong features to compute perceived sharpness in any\nnatural image, and can be considered an able alternative for the existing cues.\nUnsharp areas in a natural image happen to exhibit uniform intensity or lack of\nsharp changes between regions. Sharp region transitions in an image are caused\nby the presence of spatial high frequency content. Therefore, in the proposed\napproach, we hypothesize that using the high frequency content as the principal\nstimulus, the perceived sharpness can be quantified in an image. When an image\nis convolved with a high pass filter, higher values at any pixel location\nsignify the presence of high frequency content at those locations. Considering\nthese values as the stimulus, the exponent of the stimulus is weighted by local\nstandard deviation to impart the contribution of the local contrast within the\nformation of the sharpness map. The sharpness map highlights the relatively\nsharper regions in the image and is used to calculate the perceived sharpness\nscore of the image. The advantages of the proposed method lie in its use of\nsimple visual cues of high frequency content and local contrast to arrive at\nthe perceptual score, and requiring no training with the images. The promise of\nthe proposed method is demonstrated by its ability to compute perceived\nsharpness for within image and across image sharpness changes and for blind\nevaluation of perceptual degradation resulting due to presence of blur.\nExperiments conducted on several databases demonstrate improved performance of\nthe proposed method over that of the state-of-the-art techniques.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables"]}]

FlexDM also\nallows those tests to be executed asynchronously in parallel to take advantage\nof multi-core processors, significantly increasing usability and productivity.\nResults are saved incrementally for better robustness and reliability.\n  FlexDM is implemented in Java and runs on Windows, Linux and OSX. As we\nencourage other researchers to explore and adopt our software, FlexDM is made\navailable as a pre-configured bootable reference environment. All code,\nsupporting documentation and usage examples are also available for download at\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/flexdm.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures"]}]

The sensitivity and\nresolution of the SKA will allow us to identify, and separately trace, the\ntotal star formation in the bulges of individual high-redshift galaxies, the\nrelated nuclear activity and any star formation occurring on larger scales\nwithin a disc. We will therefore gain a detailed picture of the apparently\nsimultaneous development of stellar populations and black holes in the redshift\nrange where both star-formation and AGN activity peak (1$\\leq$z$\\leq$4). In\nthis chapter we discuss the role of the SKA in studying the connection between\nAGN activity and galaxy evolution, and the most critical technical requirements\nfor such of studies\n","Comment: 16 pages, 3 figures to appear as part of \"Continuum Science\" in\n  proceedings of \"Advancing Astrophysics with the Square Kilometre Array\"\n  PoS(AASKA14)083"]}]

One approach to address this issue is to\nlook at the Galactic bulge since it is the closest. According to some\ntheoretical models, our bulge may have built up from the merger of\nsubstructures formed from the fragmentation of a gaseous disk in the early\nphases of Galactic evolution. We may have discovered the remnant of one of\nthese substructures in the stellar system Terzan 5. In fact, Terzan 5 hosts two\nstellar populations with quite different iron abundances, thus suggesting it\nonce was far more massive than today. Moreover, its peculiar chemistry\nstrikingly resembles that observed in the Galactic bulge. In this Thesis we\nperformed a detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis of this cluster to\ndetermine its formation and evolution. Form the photometric point of view we\nbuilt a high-resolution differential reddening map in the direction of the\nsystem and we measured relative proper motions to separate its member\npopulation from the contaminating bulge and disk stars. From the spectroscopic\npoint of view we measured abundances for more than 600 stars belonging to\nTerzan 5 and its surroundings in order to build the largest\nfield-decontaminated metallicity distribution for this system. We find that the\nmetallicity distribution is extremely broad (>1 dex) and we discovered a third,\nmetal-poor and alpha-enhanced population with average [Fe/H]=-0.8 dex. The\nstriking similarity between Terzan 5 and the bulge in terms of their chemical\nformation and evolution that is clearly revealed by this Thesis suggests that\nTerzan 5 formed in situ with the Galactic bulge.

In the radio-loud AGN population the radio emission is linked to\nthe presence of bipolar outflows of relativistic jets. However, the large\nmajority of the AGN population do not form powerful highly-relativistic jets on\nkpc scales and are characterized by radio luminosity up to 10^23 W/Hz at 1.4\nGHz, challenging our knowledge on the physical processes at the basis of the\nradio emission in radio-quiet objects.

The proposed algorithm allows the problem to be solved in\na distributed, asynchronous and incremental manner.

When the dynamics is expressed in\nterms of energy-angle coordinates, it is observed that the angle is a fast\nvariable as compared to the energy. Thus, an effective stochastic dynamics for\nthe energy can be derived if the angular variable is averaged out. However, the\nstandard elimination procedure, performed earlier for a Gaussian white noise,\nfails when the noise is colored because of correlations between the noise and\nthe fast angular variable. We develop here a specific averaging scheme that\nretains these correlations.
