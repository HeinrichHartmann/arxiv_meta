The analysis performed on the density of states reveals marked\ndifferences in the distribution of the $5p$ states of Te for $x>0$. We think\nthat this finding can be associated with the fact that superconductivity is\nsuppressed in FeTe. Moreover, using resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, we\nestimate the spin state of our system which can be correlated to the magnetic\norder. We find that the spin state of the\n$\\textrm{Fe}\\textrm{Se}_{1-x}\\textrm{Te}_x$ system fluctuates, as a function of\n$x$, between $S=0$ and $S=2$ with Fe in FeSe in the highest spin state.\nFinally, our DFT calculations nicely reproduce the X-ray emission spectra\nperformed at the Fe $L$-edge (which probe the occupied states) and suggest that\nthe $\\textrm{Fe}\\textrm{Se}_{1-x}\\textrm{Te}_x$ system can be considered at\nmost as a moderately correlated system.\n","Comment: 5 figures, 27 pages.

Especially, the\nrole of vegetation in the process of river pattern formation has been explored\nand demonstrated mostly experimentally and numerically until now. In the\npresent work, we shed light on this subject by performing a linear stability\nanalysis on a simple model for riverbed vegetation dynamics coupled with the\nset of classical river morphodynamic equations. The vegetation model only\naccounts for logistic growth, local positive feedback through seeding and\nresprouting, and mortality by means of uprooting through flow shear stress. Due\nto the simplicity of the model, we can transform the set of equations into an\neigenvalue problem and assess the stability of the linearized equations when\nslightly perturbated away from a spatially homogeneous solution. If we couple\nvegetation dynamics with a 1D morphodynamic framework, we observe that\ninstability towards long sediment waves is possible due to competitive\ninteraction between vegetation growth and mortality. Moreover, the domain in\nthe parameter space where perturbations are amplified was found to be simply\nconnected. Subsequently, we proceed to the analysis of vegetation dynamics\ncoupled with a 2D morphodynamic framework, which can be used to evaluate\ninstability towards alternate and multiple bars. It is found that two kinds of\ninstabilities, which are discriminated mainly by the Froude number, occur in a\nconnected domain in the parameter space. At lower Froude number, instability is\nmainly governed by sediment dynamics and leads to the formation of alternate\nand multiple bars while at higher Froude number instability is driven by\nvegetation dynamics, which only allows for alternate bars.\n","Comment: Master Project, 50 pages"]}]

Method: We conducted a\nsystematic review about the state of art of the agile governance up to and\nincluding 2013.

During transmission, our scheme\ncombines both block Markov coding and an independent coding scheme similar to\nnetwork coding at the relay. The main contribution of this work is to examine\nhow link state impacts the allocation of power between these two distinct\ntechniques, which in turn governs the necessity of each technique in achieving\nthe largest transmission rate region. We analytically determine the link-state\nregimes and associated relaying techniques. Our results illustrate an\ninteresting trend: when the user-to-relay link is marginally stronger than the\ndirect link, it is optimal to use only independent coding. In this case, the\nrelay need not use full power. However, for larger user-to-relay link gains,\nthe relay must supplement independent coding with block Markov coding to\nachieve the largest rate region. These link-state regimes are important for the\napplication of two-way relaying in 5G networks, such as in D2D mode or\nrelay-aided transmission.\n","Comment: To be presented at Globecom 2014, Emerging Technologies for 5G\n  Wireless Cellular Networks (Wi5G)"]}]

Recent studies of empirical fitness landscapes reveal complex gene\ninteractions and multiple peaks, and recombination can be a powerful mechanism\nfor escaping suboptimal peaks. However classical work on recombination largely\nignores the effect of complex gene interactions. The advantage we find has no\ncorrespondence for 2-locus systems or for smooth landscapes. The effect is\nsometimes extreme, in the sense that shutting off recombination could result in\nthat the organism fails to adapt. A standard question about recombination is if\nthe mechanism tends to accelerate or decelerate adaptation. However, we argue\nthat extreme effects may be more important than how the majority falls.\n"]}]
