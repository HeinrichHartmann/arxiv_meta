A very elegant algorithm for this problem has been given by\nAndersen and Lang [AL08] and requires solving a small number of\nsingle-commodity maximum flow computations over the whole graph G. In this\npaper, we introduce LocalImprove, the first cut-improvement algorithm that is\nlocal, i.e. that runs in time dependent on the size of the input set A rather\nthan on the size of the entire graph. Moreover, LocalImprove achieves this\nlocal behaviour while essentially matching the same theoretical guarantee as\nthe global algorithm of Andersen and Lang.\n  The main application of LocalImprove is to the design of better\nlocal-graph-partitioning algorithms. All previously known local algorithms for\ngraph partitioning are random-walk based and can only guarantee an output\nconductance of O(\\sqrt{OPT}) when the target set has conductance OPT \\in [0,1].\nVery recently, Zhu, Lattanzi and Mirrokni [ZLM13] improved this to O(OPT /\n\\sqrt{CONN}) where the internal connectivity parameter CONN \\in [0,1] is\ndefined as the reciprocal of the mixing time of the random walk over the graph\ninduced by the target set. In this work, we show how to use LocalImprove to\nobtain a constant approximation O(OPT) as long as CONN/OPT = Omega(1). This\nyields the first flow-based algorithm.

Here, we\npresent three-dimensional (3D) ideal MHD simulationsof the Caltech plasma jet\nexperiment using a magnetic tower scenario as the baseline model. Magnetic\nfields consist of an initially localized dipole-like poloidal component and a\ntoroidal component that is continuously being injected into the domain. This\nflux injection mimics the poloidal currents driven by the anode-cathode voltage\ndrop in the experiment. The injected toroidal field stretches the poloidal\nfields to large distances, while forming a collimated jet along with several\nother key features. Detailed comparisons between 3D MHD simulations and\nexperimental measurements provide a comprehensive description of the interplay\namong magnetic force, pressure and flow effects. In particular, we delineate\nboth the jet structure and the transition process that converts the injected\nmagnetic energy to other forms. With suitably chosen parameters that are\nderived from experiments, the jet in the simulation agrees quantitatively with\nthe experimental jet in terms of magnetic/kinetic/inertial energy, total\npoloidal current, voltage, jet radius, and jet propagation velocity.\nSpecifically, the jet velocity in the simulation is proportional to the\npoloidal current divided by the square root of the jet density, in agreement\nwith both the experiment and analytical theory. This work provides a new and\nquantitative method for relating experiments, numerical simulations and\nastrophysical observation, and demonstrates the possibility of using\nterrestrial laboratory experiments to study astrophysical jets.\n","Comment: accepted by ApJ 37 pages, 15 figures, 2 tables"]}]

Looking into this\nfuture, the Einstein Telescope (ET) was designed to have a fantastic\nsensitivity improving significantly over the advanced GW detectors. One of the\nmost important astrophysical GW sources supposed to be detected by the ET in\nlarge numbers are double compact objects (DCO) and some of such events should\nbe gravitationally lensed by intervening galaxies.\n  We explore the prospects of observing gravitationally lensed inspiral DCO\nevents in the ET. This analysis is a significant extension of our previous\npaper. We are using the intrinsic merger rates of the whole class of DCO\n(NS-NS,BH-NS,BH-BH)located at different redshifts as calculated by Dominik et\nal. by using {\\tt StarTrack} population synthesis evolutionary code. We discuss\nin details predictions from each evolutionary scenario. Our general conclusion\nis that ET would register about $50-100$ strongly lensed inspiral events per\nyear. Only the scenario in which nascent BHs receive strong kick gives the\npredictions of a few events per year. Such lensed events would be dominated by\nthe BH-BH merging binary systems. Our results suggest that during a few years\nof successful operation ET will provide a considerable catalog of strongly\nlensed events.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 5 figures, submitted to JCAP"]}]

We determine how\nthese new factors change the conditions for a successful mutant invasion and\ndiscuss the variation on the steady state fraction of the population as\ndifferent model parameters are changed. By including the phenotypic\nplasticity/dedifferentiation, in which a progenitor/differentiated cell can\ntransform back into a cancer stem cell, we show that the effective fitness of\nmutant stem cells is not only determined by their proliferation and death rates\nbut also according to their dedifferentiation potential. By numerically solving\nthe model we derive the phase diagram of the advantageous and disadvantageous\nphases of cancer stem cells in the space of proliferation and dedifferentiation\npotentials. The result shows that at high enough dedifferentiation rates even a\npreviously disadvantageous mutant can take over the population of normal stem\ncells. This observation has implications in different areas of cancer research\nincluding experimental observations that imply metastatic cancer stem cell\ntypes might have lower proliferation potential than other stem cell phenotypes\nwhile showing much more phenotypic plasticity and can undergo clonal expansion.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 12 figures"]}]

Whether the C\nflame will actually be able to reach the center depends on the efficiency of\nextra mixing beneath the C convective shell. Whereas thermohaline mixing is too\ninefficient to interfere with the C-flame propagation, convective boundary\nmixing can prevent the C burning from reaching the center. As a result, a\nC-O-Ne white dwarf (WD) is formed, after the star has lost its envelope. Such a\n\"hybrid\" WD has a small CO core surrounded by a thick ONe zone. In our 1D\nstellar evolution computations the hybrid WD is allowed to accrete C-rich\nmaterial, as if it were in a close binary system and accreted H-rich material\nfrom its companion with a sufficiently high rate at which the accreted H would\nbe processed into He under stationary conditions, assuming that He could then\nbe transformed into C. When the mass of the accreting WD approaches the\nChandrasekhar limit, we find a series of convective Urca shell flashes\nassociated with high abundances of 23Na and 25Mg. They are followed by\noff-center C ignition leading to convection that occupies almost the entire\nstar. To model the Urca processes, we use the most recent well-resolved data\nfor their reaction and neutrino-energy loss rates. Because of the emphasized\nuncertainty of the convective Urca process in our hybrid WD models of SN Ia\nprogenitors, we consider a number of their potentially possible alternative\ninstances for different mixing assumptions, all of which reach a phase of\nexplosive C ignition, either off or in the center. Our hybrid SN Ia progenitor\nmodels have much lower C to O abundance ratios at the moment of the explosive C\nignition than their pure CO counterparts, which may explain the observed\ndiversity of the SNe Ia.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures, submitted to the Proceedings of Science, XIII\n  Nuclei in the Cosmos,7-11 July, 2014, Debrecen, Hungary"]}]

When considering\nexperiments which aim to test the above predictions, there will also be a\ncompetition between the stimulated emission from thermal noise and the\nspontaneous emission out of vacuum. In order to measure these effects, one\nshould thus compute the consequences of UV dispersion and dissipation, and\nidentify observables able to establish that the spontaneous emission took\nplace. In this thesis, we first analyze the effects of dispersion and\ndissipation on both Hawking radiation and pair particle production. To get\nexplicit results, we work in the context of de Sitter space. Using the extended\nsymmetries of the theory in such a background, exact results are obtained.\nThese are then transposed to the context of black holes using the\ncorrespondence between de Sitter space and the black hole near horizon region.\nTo introduce dissipation, we consider an exactly solvable model producing any\ndecay rate. We also study the quantum entanglement of the particles so\nproduced. In a second part, we consider explicit condensed matter systems,\nnamely Bose Einstein condensates and exciton-polariton systems. We analyze the\neffects of dissipation on entanglement produced by the dynamical Casimir\neffect. As a final step, we study the entanglement of Hawking radiation in the\npresence of dispersion for a generic analogue system.\n","Comment: PhD Thesis, LPT Orsay, 223 pages, 10 Chapters and 1 appendix"]}]
