We call it the\nintermediate disorder regime. It is accessed by scaling the inverse temperature\nparameter $\\beta$ to zero as the polymer length $n$ tends to infinity. The\nnatural choice of scaling is $\\beta_n:=\\beta n^{-1/4}$. We show that the\npolymer measure under this scaling has previously unseen behavior. While the\nfluctuation exponents of the polymer endpoint and the log partition function\nare identical to those for simple random walk ($\\zeta=1/2,\\chi=0$), the\nfluctuations themselves are different. These fluctuations are still influenced\nby the random environment, and there is no self-averaging of the polymer\nmeasure. In particular, the random distribution of the polymer endpoint\nconverges in law (under a diffusive scaling of space) to a random absolutely\ncontinuous measure on the real line. The randomness of the measure is inherited\nfrom a stationary process $A_{\\beta}$ that has the recently discovered\ncrossover distributions as its one-point marginals, which for large $\\beta$\nbecome the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution. We also prove existence of a limiting\nlaw for the four-parameter field of polymer transition probabilities that can\nbe described by the stochastic heat equation. In particular, in this weak noise\nlimit, we obtain the convergence of the point-to-point free energy fluctuations\nto the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution.

In order to scale informed transmitter\nschemes to emerging massive MIMO systems with a large number of transmit\nantennas at the base station, one common approach is to employ time division\nduplexing (TDD) and to exploit the implicit feedback obtained from channel\nreciprocity. However, most existing cellular deployments are based on frequency\ndivision duplexing (FDD), hence it is of great interest to explore backwards\ncompatible massive MIMO upgrades of such systems. For a fixed feedback rate per\nantenna, the number of codewords for quantizing the channel grows exponentially\nwith the number of antennas, hence generating feedback based on look-up from a\nstandard vector quantized codebook does not scale. In this paper, we propose\nnoncoherent trellis-coded quantization (NTCQ), whose encoding complexity scales\nlinearly with the number of antennas. The approach exploits the duality between\nsource encoding in a Grassmannian manifold and noncoherent sequence detection.\nFurthermore, since noncoherent detection can be realized near-optimally using a\nbank of coherent detectors, we obtain a low-complexity implementation of NTCQ\nencoding using an off-the-shelf Viterbi algorithm applied to standard trellis\ncoded quantization.

We provide a general analytical study of\nits large and small scale properties and analyze the impact of these initial\nconditions on the infrared aspects of typical test scalar fields. The infrared\nbehavior of massless minimally coupled test scalar field theories leads to the\ndynamical generation of mass and anomalous dimensions, both depend\nnon-analytically on $\\mathcal{T}(0)$. During inflation all quanta decay into\nmany quanta even of the same field because of the lack of kinematic thresholds.\nThe decay leads to a quantum entangled state of sub and superhorizon quanta\nwith correlations across the horizon. We find the modifications of the decay\nwidth and the entanglement entropy from the initial conditions. In all cases,\ninitial conditions from a ``fast-roll'' stage that lead to a suppression in the\nscalar power spectrum at large scales also result in a suppression of the\ndynamically generated masses, anomalous dimensions and decay widths.\n","Comment: expanded discussion on fast-slow roll stage. version to appear in PRD"]}]

Most of the existing\nalgorithms for community detection in a signed network aim at providing a\nhard-partition of the network where any node should belong to a community or\nnot. However, they cannot detect overlapping communities where a node is\nallowed to belong to multiple communities. The overlapping communities widely\nexist in many real world networks. In this paper, we propose a signed\nprobabilistic mixture (SPM) model for overlapping community detection in signed\nnetworks. Compared with the existing models, the advantages of our methodology\nare (i) providing soft-partition solutions for signed networks; (ii) providing\nsoft-memberships of nodes. Experiments on a number of signed networks show that\nour SPM model: (i) can identify assortative structures or disassortative\nstructures as the same as other state-of-the-art models; (ii) can detect\noverlapping communities; (iii) outperform other state-of-the-art models at\nshedding light on the community detection in synthetic signed networks.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 11 figures"]}]

In this paper, we conduct a large scale quantitative study of\ninformation overload and evaluate its impact on information dissemination in\nthe Twitter social media site. We model social media users as information\nprocessing systems that queue incoming information according to some policies,\nprocess information from the queue at some unknown rates and decide to forward\nsome of the incoming information to other users. We show how timestamped data\nabout tweets received and forwarded by users can be used to uncover key\nproperties of their queueing policies and estimate their information processing\nrates and limits. Such an understanding of users' information processing\nbehaviors allows us to infer whether and to what extent users suffer from\ninformation overload.\n  Our analysis provides empirical evidence of information processing limits for\nsocial media users and the prevalence of information overloading. The most\nactive and popular social media users are often the ones that are overloaded.\nMoreover, we find that the rate at which users receive information impacts\ntheir processing behavior, including how they prioritize information from\ndifferent sources, how much information they process, and how quickly they\nprocess information. Finally, the susceptibility of a social media user to\nsocial contagions depends crucially on the rate at which she receives\ninformation. An exposure to a piece of information, be it an idea, a convention\nor a product, is much less effective for users that receive information at\nhigher rates, meaning they need more exposures to adopt a particular contagion.\n","Comment: To appear at ICSWM '14"]}]

However, it is very important to\ncontrol the workload, e.g. the frequency of body movements, within the\ncapability of the individual to maximise the efficiency of the exercise. The\nworkload is generally represented in terms of heart rate (HR) and oxygen\nconsumption VO2. We focus particularly on the control of HR and VO2 using the\nworkload of an individual body movement, also known as the exercise rate (ER),\nin this research. The first part of this report deals with the modelling and\ncontrol of HR during an unknown type of rhythmic exercise. A novel feature of\nthe developed system is to control HR via manipulating ER as a control input.\nThe relation between ER and HR is modelled using a simple autoregressive model\nwith unknown parameters. The parameters of the model are estimated using a\nKalman filter and an indirect adaptive H1 controller is designed. The\nperformance of the system is tested and validated on six subjects during rowing\nand cycling exercise. The results demonstrate that the designed control system\ncan regulate HR to a predefined profile. The second part of this report deals\nwith the problem of estimating VO2 during rhythmic exercise, as the direct\nmeasurement of VO2 is not realisable in these environments. Therefore,\nnon-invasive sensors are used to measure HR, RespR, and ER to estimate VO2. The\ndeveloped approach for cycling and rowing exercise predicts the percentage\nchange in maximum VO2 from the resting to the exercising phases, using a\nHammerstein model..

The reason is that the delay bottleneck for both\nprotocols is the time required to successfully access the control channel,\nwhich occurs more frequently for the switching MAC protocol.
