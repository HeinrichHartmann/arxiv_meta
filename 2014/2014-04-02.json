An alternative approach is to derive a self-consistent solution for a\nparticular mass model of the MW (i.e. obtained from its gravitational\npotential) using the Eddington formalism, which assumes isotropy. In this paper\nwe extend this approach to incorporate an anisotropic phase-space distribution\nfunction. We perform Bayesian scans over the parameters defining the mass model\nof the MW and parameterising the phase-space density, implementing constraints\nfrom a wide range of astronomical observations. The scans allow us to estimate\nthe precision reached in the reconstruction of the velocity distribution (for\ndifferent DM halo profiles). As expected, allowing for an anisotropic velocity\ntensor increases the uncertainty in the reconstruction of f(v) but the\ndistribution can still be determined with a precision of a factor of 4-5. The\nmean velocity distribution resembles the isotropic case, however the amplitude\nof the high-velocity tail is up to a factor of 2 larger.

This approach needs many realizations for\nestablishing statistical results on the system under study. It is very\ncomputationnally demanding, and with the advent of large models this burden is\nincreasing. Hence parallel implementation of SSA are needed to address these\nneeds.\n  At the very heart of the SSA is the selection of the next reaction to occur\nat each time step, and to the best of our knowledge all implementations are\nbased on an inverse transformation method. However, this method involves a\nrandom number of steps to select this next reaction and is poorly amenable to a\nparallel implementation.\n  Results: Here, we introduce a parallel acceptance-rejection algorithm to\nselect the K next reactions to occur. This algorithm uses a deterministic\nnumber of steps, a property well suited to a parallel implementation. It is\nsimple and small, accurate and scalable. We propose a Graphics Processing Unit\n(GPU) implementation and validate our algorithm with simulated propensity\ndistributions and the propensity distribution of a large model of yeast iron\nmetabolism. We show that our algorithm can handle thousands of selections of\nnext reaction to occur in parallel on the GPU, paving the way to massive SSA.\n  Availability: We present our GPU-AR algorithm that focuses on the very heart\nof the SSA.

In this paper we address the question of\nwhether one can approximately count triangulations in sub-exponential time. We\npresent an algorithm with sub-exponential running time and sub-exponential\napproximation ratio, that is, denoting by $\\Lambda$ the output of our\nalgorithm, and by $c^{n}$ the exact number of triangulations of $P$, for some\npositive constant $c$, we prove that $c^{n}\\leq\\Lambda\\leq c^{n}\\cdot\n2^{o(n)}$. This is the first algorithm that in sub-exponential time computes a\n$(1+o(1))$-approximation of the base of the number of triangulations, more\nprecisely, $c\\leq\\Lambda^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\leq(1 + o(1))c$. Our algorithm can be\nadapted to approximately count other crossing-free structures on $P$, keeping\nthe quality of approximation and running time intact. In this paper we show how\nto do this for matchings and spanning trees.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 2 figures. A preliminary version appeared at CCCG 2013"]}]

In this paper we\nshow that photons do collapse within the retina and subsequent processing of\ninformation at the level of neural membranes proceeds. Moreover, we explicitly\nstress on the fact that due to existent amplification of the signal produced by\neach photon, a basic quantum mechanical theorem forbids the photon state to be\nteleported from the retina to the brain cortex. The changes of the membrane\npotential of the neurons in the primary visual cortex are shown to be relevant\nto inputting visual sensory information that is already processed and is not\nidentical to the visual image entering in the retina. A striking evidence for\nthe existent processing of the incoming visual information by the retina is\nprovided by visual illusions resulting from the lateral inhibition mechanism.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 7 figures"]}]
