We propose that the enhancement needed in the\nStandard Model to attribute the observed CP violation in D to two pseudoscalar\nmodes may not operate for inclusive final states where asymmetries will likely\napproximate the quark level expectation. Experimentally testing this principle\nrequires a search for CP asymmetries in final states containing K and K-bar\nwith a total energy of less than M_D.

Several computational mechanisms have been proposed to account for such\nisochronous synchronization in the presence of long conduction delays: Of\nthese, the phenomenon of \"dynamical relaying\" - a mechanism that relies on a\nspecific network motif - has proven to be the most robust with respect to\nparameter mismatch and system noise. Surprisingly, despite a contrary belief in\nthe community, the common driving motif is an unreliable means of establishing\nzero-lag synchrony. Although dynamical relaying has been validated in empirical\nand computational studies, the deeper dynamical mechanisms and comparison to\ndynamics on other motifs is lacking. By systematically comparing\nsynchronization on a variety of small motifs, we establish that the presence of\na single reciprocally connected pair - a \"resonance pair\" - plays a crucial\nrole in disambiguating those motifs that foster zero-lag synchrony in the\npresence of conduction delays (such as dynamical relaying) from those that do\nnot (such as the common driving triad). Remarkably, minor structural changes to\nthe common driving motif that incorporate a reciprocal pair recover robust\nzero-lag synchrony. The findings are observed in computational models of\nspiking neurons, populations of spiking neurons and neural mass models, and\narise whether the oscillatory systems are periodic, chaotic, noise-free or\ndriven by stochastic inputs. The influence of the resonance pair is also robust\nto parameter mismatch and asymmetrical time delays amongst the elements of the\nmotif.

However, Swift\nobservations suggest that many GRBs have extended central engine activities\nmanifested as flares and internal plateaus in X-rays. We perform a\ncomprehensive study on a large sample of Swift GRBs with XRT observations to\ninvestigate GRB central engine activity duration and to determine whether\nultra-long GRBs are unusual events.

We also discuss the\ntheoretical implications of our results. In particular, the central engine\nactivity duration of GRBs is generally much longer than the gamma-ray T90\nduration and it does not even correlate with T90.

In order to distil the\ntopological entropy, one resorts to extrapolation as a function of system size,\nor to clever subtraction schemes that allow to cancel out the leading terms.\nBoth approaches have the disadvantage of requiring multiple (accurate)\ncalculations of the entanglement of the system.

Examples of phonological categories are vowel sounds such as \"i\"\nand \"e\". We model such categories as consisting of collections of labeled\nexemplars that language users store in their memory. Each exemplar is a\ndetailed memory of an instance of the linguistic entity in question. Starting\nfrom an exemplar-level model we derive integro-differential equations for the\nlong-term evolution of the density of exemplars in different portions of\nphonetic space. Using these latter equations we investigate under what\nconditions two phonological categories merge or not. Our main conclusion is\nthat for the preservation of distinct phonological categories, it is necessary\nthat anomalous speech tokens of a given category are discarded, and not merely\nstored in memory as an exemplar of another category.\n","Comment: 6 pages, COGS2014"]}]

The relay station uses channel estimates obtained from received pilots\nand zero-forcing (ZF) or maximum-ratio combining/maximum-ratio transmission\n(MRC/MRT) to process the signals. To reduce significantly the loop interference\neffect, we propose two techniques: i) using a massive receive antenna array; or\nii) using a massive transmit antenna array together with very low transmit\npower at the relay station. We derive an exact achievable rate in closed-form\nfor MRC/MRT processing and an analytical approximation of the achievable rate\nfor ZF processing. This approximation is very tight, especially for large\nnumber of relay station antennas. These closed-form expressions enable us to\ndetermine the regions where the full-duplex mode outperforms the half-duplex\nmode, as well as, to design an optimal power allocation scheme. This optimal\npower allocation scheme aims to maximize the energy efficiency for a given sum\nspectral efficiency and under peak power constraints at the relay station and\nsources. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the optimal power\nallocation scheme. Furthermore, we show that, by doubling the number of\ntransmit/receive antennas at the relay station, the transmit power of each\nsource and of the relay station can be reduced by 1.5dB if the pilot power is\nequal to the signal power, and by 3dB if the pilot power is kept fixed, while\nmaintaining a given quality-of-service.\n"]}]

The color excess ratio E(J-H)/E(J-Ks), representative of\nthe NIR extinction law, shows no dependence on the color excess when E(J-Ks)\nchanges from ~0.3 to ~4.0, which implies a universal NIR extinction law from\ndiffuse to dense regions. The constant value of E(J-H)/E(J-Ks), 0.64,\ncorresponds to a power law index of 1.95. The other two ratios, E(H-Ks)/E(J-Ks)\nand E(J-H)/E(H-Ks), are 0.36 and 1.78 respectively.

The idea common to all of these constructs is that their\nsatisfaction depends on the truth values of a set of (non-generalized) atoms,\nrather than the truth value of a single (non-generalized) atom. Motivated by\nseveral examples, we argue that for some of the more intricate generalized\natoms, the previously suggested semantics provide unintuitive results and\nprovide an alternative semantics, which we call supportedly stable or SFLP\nanswer sets. We show that it is equivalent to the major previously proposed\nsemantics for programs with convex generalized atoms, and that it in general\nadmits more intended models than other semantics in the presence of non-convex\ngeneralized atoms. We show that the complexity of supportedly stable models is\non the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, similar to previous proposals\nand to stable models of disjunctive logic programs. Given these complexity\nresults, we provide a compilation method that compactly transforms programs\nwith generalized atoms in disjunctive normal form to programs without\ngeneralized atoms.
