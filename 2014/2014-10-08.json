They remain poorly tested, especially at the highest\ndensities. Aims: We investigate the effects of gas density on the SFE through\nmeasurements of the core formation efficiency (CFE). With a total mass of\n$\\sim2\\times10^4$ M$_\\odot$, the W43-MM1 ridge is one of the most convincing\ncandidate precursor of starburst clusters and thus one of the best place to\ninvestigate star formation. Methods: We used high-angular resolution maps\nobtained at 3 mm and 1 mm within W43-MM1 with the IRAM Plateau de Bure\nInterferometer to reveal a cluster of 11 massive dense cores (MDCs), and, one\nof the most massive protostellar cores known. An Herschel column density image\nprovided the mass distribution of the cloud gas. We then measured the\n'instantaneous' CFE and estimated the SFE and the star formation rate (SFR)\nwithin subregions of the W43-MM1 ridge. Results: The high SFE found in the\nridge ($\\sim$6% enclosed in $\\sim$8 pc$^3$) confirms its ability to form a\nstarburst cluster.

Statistical models of the SFR may\nwell describe the outskirts of the W43-MM1 ridge but struggle to reproduce its\ninner part, which corresponds to measurements at low $\\alpha_{vir}$.

However, the early version of this interpretation, as applied\nto the short-range Edwards-Anderson model, runs into problems because as shown\nby Newman and Stein (NS) it does not allow for chaotic size dependence, and\npredicts non-self-averaging that cannot occur. NS proposed the concept of the\nmetastate (a probability distribution over infinite-size Gibbs states in a\ngiven sample that captures the effects of chaotic size dependence) and a\nnon-standard interpretation of the RSB results in which the metastate is\nnon-trivial and is responsible for what was called non-self-averaging. Here we\nuse the effective field theory of RSB, in conjunction with the rigorous\ndefinitions of pure states and the metastate in infinite-size systems, to show\nthat the non-standard picture follows directly from the RSB mean-field theory.\nIn addition, the metastate-averaged state possesses power-law correlations\nthroughout the low temperature phase; the corresponding exponent $\\zeta$ takes\nthe value $4$ according to the field theory in high dimensions $d$, and\ndescribes the effective fractal dimension of clusters of spins. Further, the\nlogarithm of the number of pure states in the decomposition of the\nmetastate-averaged state that can be distinguished if only correlations in a\nwindow of size $W$ can be observed is of order $W^{d-\\zeta}$.

We find that most molecular outflows are detected in both SiO and CO,\nalthough there are some cases of CO outflows with no SiO counterpart. We find a\nsignificant amount of narrow line SiO emission that appears to be unrelated to\noutflows. The fraction of the total SiO luminosity that is not associated with\noutflows is highly variable in the different MDCs (from 10% to 90%); this might\nbe a problem when extrapolating outflow properties from SiO luminosities\nwithout resolving individual outflows. The extent of the narrow SiO emission\nvaries from rather compact (~ 0.03 pc) to widespread (~0.2 pc), and its\nkinematics often differs from those found by other high-density tracers such as\nH13CO+. We find that the least centrally concentrated clumps with the least\nmassive protostellar cores have the most widespread narrow SiO emission. In\nline with previous evidence of SiO emission associated with low-velocity\nshocks, we propose an evolutionary picture to explain the existence and\ndistribution of narrow SiO line profiles. In this scenario, the least centrally\ncondensed MDCs are at an early stage where the SiO emission traces shocks from\nthe large-scale collapse of material onto the MDC (e.g. CygX-N40). As the MDC\ncollapses, the SiO emission becomes more confined to the close surroundings of\ncores, tracing the post-shock material from the infalling MDC against the dense\ncores (e.g. CygX-N3, N12, and N48). At later stages, when single massive\nprotostars are formed, the SiO luminosity is largely dominated by powerful\noutflows, and the weaker narrow component shows perhaps the last remnants of\nthe initial collapse (e.g. CygX-N53 and N63).\n","Comment: 15 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy and\n  Astrophysics"]}]

We find that small changes in\nthe electron temperature can result in dramatic differences in the relative\ndominance of jets and accretion flows. Application to Sgr A* shows that radio\nspectrum and size of this source can be well reproduced with a model where\nelectrons are more efficiently heated in the jet. The X-ray emission is\nsensitive to the electron heating mechanism in the jets and disk and therefore\nX-ray observations put strong constraints on electron temperatures and geometry\nof the accretion flow and jet. For Sgr A*, the jet model also predicts a\nsignificant frequency-dependent core shift which could place independent\nconstraints on the model once measured accurately. We conclude that more\nsophisticated models for electron distribution functions are crucial for\nconstraining GRMHD simulations with actual observations. For Sgr A*, the radio\nappearance may well be dominated by the outflowing plasma. Nonetheless, at the\nhighest radio frequencies, the shadow of the event horizon should still be\ndetectable with future Very Long Baseline Interferometric observations.\n","Comment: A&A accepted, 11 figures, 1 table"]}]

The disc-locking prevents the star to spin its rotation up, and its\ntimescale depends on the disc lifetime. Some mechanisms can significantly\nshorten this lifetime, allowing a few stars to start spinning up much earlier\nthan other stars. In the present study, we aim to investigate how the\nproperties of the circumstellar environment can shorten the disc lifetime. We\nhave identified a few multiple stellar systems, composed of stars with similar\nmasses, which belong to associations with a known age. Since all parameters\nthat are responsible for the rotational evolution, with the exception of\nenvironment properties and initial stellar rotation, are similar for all\ncomponents, we expect that significant differences among the rotation periods\ncan only arise from differences in the disc lifetimes. A photometric timeseries\nallowed us to measure the rotation periods of each component, while\nhigh-resolution spectra provided us with the fundamental parameters, $v\\sin{i}$\nand chromospheric line fluxes. The rotation periods of the components differ\nsignificantly, and the component B, which has a closer companion C, rotates\nfaster than the more distant and isolated component A. We can ascribe the\nrotation period difference to either different initial rotation periods or\ndifferent disc-locking phases arising from the presence of the close companion\nC. In the specific case of BD$-$21 1074, the second scenario seems to be more\nfavored. In our hypothesis of different disc-locking phase, any planet orbiting\nthis star is likely formed very rapidly owing to a gravitational instability\nmechanism, rather than core accretion. Only a large difference of initial\nrotation periods alone could account for the observed period difference,\nleaving comparable disc lifetimes.\n","Comment: Accepted by Astronomy & Astrophysics on July 31, 2014; Pages 12,\n  Figs. 7"]}]

We argue that the entropic mechanism\nresults in an anomalously strong quarkonium suppression in the temperature\nrange near $T_c$. This \"entropic self-destruction\" may thus explain why the\nexperimentally measured quarkonium nuclear modification factor at RHIC (lower\nenergy density) is smaller than at LHC (higher energy density), possibly\nresolving the \"quarkonium suppression puzzle\" - all of the previously known\nmechanisms of quarkonium dissociation operate more effectively at higher energy\ndensities, and this contradicts the data.

Methods: We present new high spectral resolution observations of H$_2$\n0-0 S(4), 0-0 S(9), and 1-0 S(1) towards HH 54, a bright nearby shock region in\nthe southern sky. In addition, new Herschel-HIFI H$_2$O (2$_{12}$$-$1$_{01}$)\nobservations at 1670~GHz are presented. Results: Our observations show for the\nfirst time a clear separation in velocity of the different H$_2$ lines: the 0-0\nS(4) line at the lowest excitation peaks at $-$7~km~s$^{-1}$, while the more\nexcited 0-0 S(9) and 1-0 S(1) lines peak at $-$15~km~s$^{-1}$. H$_2$O and\nhigh-$J$ CO appear to be associated with the H$_2$ 0-0 S(4) emission, which\ntraces a gas component with a temperature of 700$-$1000 K. The H$_2$O abundance\nwith respect to H$_2$ 0-0 S(4) is estimated to be\n$X$(H$_2$O)$<$1.4$\\times$10$^{-5}$ in the shocked gas over an area of\n13$^{\\prime\\prime}$. Conclusions: We resolve two distinct gas components\nassociated with the HH 54 shock region at different velocities and excitations.\nThis allows us to constrain the temperature of the H$_2$O emitting gas\n($\\leq$1000 K) and to derive correct estimates of H$_2$O abundance in the\nshocked gas, which is lower than what is expected from shock model predictions.\n","Comment: Astronomy & Astrophysics Letter, in press"]}]

Often this measure\nturns out to be too pessimistic, and one popular approach especially for\nscheduling problems has been that of \"resource augmentation\" which was first\nproposed by Kalyanasundaram and Pruhs. Although resource augmentation has been\nvery successful in dealing with a variety of objective functions, there are\nproblems for which even a (arbitrary) constant speedup cannot lead to a\nconstant competitive algorithm. In this paper we propose a \"rejection model\"\nwhich requires no resource augmentation but which permits the online algorithm\nto not serve an epsilon-fraction of the requests.\n  The problems considered in this paper are in the restricted assignment\nsetting where each job can be assigned only to a subset of machines. For the\nload balancing problem where the objective is to minimize the maximum load on\nany machine, we give $O(\\log^2 1/\\eps)$-competitive algorithm which rejects at\nmost an $\\eps$-fraction of the jobs. For the problem of minimizing the maximum\nweighted flow-time, we give an $O(1/\\eps^4)$-competitive algorithm which can\nreject at most an $\\eps$-fraction of the jobs by weight. We also extend this\nresult to a more general setting where the weights of a job for measuring its\nweighted flow-time and its contribution towards total allowed rejection weight\nare different. This is useful, for instance, when we consider the objective of\nminimizing the maximum stretch. We obtain an $O(1/\\eps^6)$-competitive\nalgorithm in this case.\n  Our algorithms are immediate dispatch, though they may not be immediate\nreject.

When assuming infinite backlog, it is known that\ninter-session network coding (INC) can significantly increase the throughput of\neach flow.

We then develop a queue-length-based scheduling scheme, which, with\nthe help of the new INC operation, can robustly and optimally adapt to\ntime-varying channel quality. We then show that the proposed algorithm can be\neasily extended for rate adaptation and it again robustly achieves the optimal\nthroughput. A byproduct of our results is a scheduling scheme for stochastic\nprocessing networks (SPNs) with random departure, which relaxes the assumption\nof deterministic departure in the existing results.
