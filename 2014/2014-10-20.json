These anomalies offer the prospect of\ntesting a fundamental prediction of the cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological\nmodel: the existence of numerous substructures that are too small to host\nvisible galaxies. In two previous studies we found that the number of subhalos\nin the six high-resolution simulations of CDM galactic halos of the Aquarius\nproject is not sufficient to account for the observed frequency of flux ratio\nanomalies seen in selected quasars from the CLASS survey. These studies were\nlimited by the small number of halos used, their narrow range of masses (1-2E12\nsolar masses) and the small range of lens ellipticities considered. We address\nthese shortcomings by investigating the lensing properties of a large sample of\nhalos with a wide range of masses in two sets of high resolution simulations of\ncosmological volumes and comparing them to a currently best available sample of\nradio quasars. We find that, as expected, substructures do not change the\nflux-ratio probability distribution of image pairs and triples with large\nseparations, but they have a significant effect on the distribution at small\nseparations. For such systems, CDM substructures can account for a substantial\nfraction of the observed flux-ratio anomalies.

Pairwise\nfringe trackers based on the integrated optics concepts used for example in\nGRAVITY seem limited to about K=10.5 with the 8m Unit Telescopes of the VLTI,\nand there is a general \"common sense\" statement that the efficiency of fringe\ntracking, and hence the sensitivity of optical interferometry, must decrease as\nthe number of apertures increases, at least in the near infrared where we are\nstill limited by detector readout noise. Here we present a Hierarchical Fringe\nTracking (HFT) concept with sensitivity at least equal to this of a two\napertures fringe trackers. HFT is based of the combination of the apertures in\npairs, then in pairs of pairs then in pairs of groups. The key HFT module is a\ndevice that behaves like a spatial filter for two telescopes (2TSF) and\ntransmits all or most of the flux of a cophased pair in a single mode beam. We\ngive an example of such an achromatic 2TSF, based on very broadband dispersed\nfringes analyzed by grids, and show that it allows piston measures from very\nbroadband fringes with only 3 to 5 pixels per fringe tracker. We show the\nresults of numerical simulation indicating that our device is a good achromatic\nspatial filter and allowing a first evaluation of its coupling efficiency,\nwhich is similar to this of a single mode fiber on a single aperture. Our very\npreliminary results indicate that HFT has a good chance to be a serious\ncandidate for the most sensitive fringe tracking with the VLTI and also\ninterferometers with much larger number of apertures. On the VLTI the first\nrough estimate of the magnitude gain with regard to the GRAVITY internal FT is\nbetween 2.5 and 3.5 magnitudes in K, with a decisive impact on the VLTI science\nprogram for AGNs, Young stars and planet forming disks.\n","Comment: SPIE Astronomical Telescopes and Instrumentation conference, June\n  2014; 9 pages, 5 figures"]}]

Estimating the channel sufficiently accurately to perform\nbeamforming can thus be challenging both due to low coherence time and large\nnumber of antennas. Also, the measurements used for channel estimation may need\nto be made with analog beamforming where the receiver can \"look\" in only\ndirection at a time.
