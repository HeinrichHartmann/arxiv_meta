In extension to that\nwork, we use the technique of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) to significantly\nenhance the local spatial resolution of the current sheet during its formation,\nwhich enables us to follow the evolution into a later stage. Our simulations\nare in good agreement with the results of Aulanier et al. up to the calculated\ntime in that work. In a later phase, we observe a basically unarrested collapse\nof the sheet to length scales that are more than one order of magnitude smaller\nthan those reported earlier. The current density attains correspondingly larger\nmaximum values within the sheet. During this thinning process, which is finally\nlimited by lack of resolution even in the AMR studies, the current sheet moves\nupward, following a global expansion of the magnetic structure during the\nquasi-static evolution. The sheet is locally one-dimensional and the plasma\nflow in its vicinity, when transformed into a co-moving frame, qualitatively\nresembles a stagnation point flow.

We reexamine the transformation\nfor the diffusion tensor from this local to a global frame, in which the Parker\ntransport equation for energetic particles is usually formulated and solved.\nParticularly, we generalize the transformation formulas to allow for an\nexplicit choice of two principal local perpendicular diffusion axes.

For the local frame, we motivate the\nchoice of the Frenet-Serret trihedron which is related to the intrinsic\nmagnetic field geometry. We directly compare the old and the new tensor\nelements for two heliospheric magnetic field configurations, namely the hybrid\nFisk and the Parker field.

On the other hand, when\nthe same fluid is sucked into the tube, it comes in from all directions,\nforming a sink-like flow. We show that, even for the ideal flow described by\nthe time-reversible Euler equation, an experimenter who only controls the\npressure in a pump attached to the tube would see jets form in one direction\nexclusively. The asymmetry between outflow and inflow therefore does not depend\non viscous dissipation, but rather on the experimenter's limited control of\ninitial and boundary conditions.

Ideally this occurs without net charge currents in order to avoid\nenergy dissipation due to Joule heating. To this end the ability to create pure\nspin currents i.e.without net charge transfer is essential. Spin pumping is the\nmost popular approach to generate pure spin currents in metals, semiconductors,\ngraphene, and even organic materials. When the magnetization vector in a\nferromagnet (FM) - normal metal (NM) junction is excited the spin pumping\neffect leads to the injection of pure spin currents in the normal metal. The\npolarization of this spin current is time dependent and contains a very small\ndc component. The dc-component of the injected spin current has been intensely\nstudied in recent years and has given rise to controversial discussions\nconcerning the magnitude the spin Hall angle which is a material dependent\nmeasure of the efficiency of spin to charge conversion . However in contrast to\nthe rather well understood dc component the two orders of magnitude larger ac\ncomponent has escaped experimental detection so far. Here we show that the\nlarge ac component of the spin currents can be detected very efficiently using\nthe inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE). The observed ac-ISHE voltages are one\norder of magnitude larger than the conventional dc-ISHE measured on the same\ndevice. The spectral shape, angular dependence, power scaling behavior and\nabsolute magnitude of the signals are in line with spin pumping and ISHE\neffects.

In this context, we\nstudy the following problem of barrier coverage by stationary wireless sensors\nthat are assisted by a mobile robot with the capacity to move sensors. Assume\nthat $n$ sensors are initially arbitrarily distributed on a line segment\nbarrier. Each sensor is said to cover the portion of the barrier that\nintersects with its sensing area. Owing to incorrect initial position, or the\ndeath of some of the sensors, the barrier is not completely covered by the\nsensors. We employ a mobile robot to move the sensors to final positions on the\nbarrier such that barrier coverage is guaranteed. We seek algorithms that\nminimize the length of the robot's trajectory, since this allows the\nrestoration of barrier coverage as soon as possible. We give an optimal\nlinear-time offline algorithm that gives a minimum-length trajectory for a\nrobot that starts at one end of the barrier and achieves the restoration of\nbarrier coverage. We also study two different online models: one in which the\nonline robot does not know the length of the barrier in advance, and the other\nin which the online robot knows the length of the barrier. For the case when\nthe online robot does not know the length of the barrier, we prove a tight\nbound of $3/2$ on the competitive ratio, and we give a tight lower bound of\n$5/4$ on the competitive ratio in the other case. Thus for each case we give an\noptimal online algorithm.\n","Comment: 20 pages"]}]

Our proofs\nrequire a novel structural lemma over ranked lists which may be of independent\ninterest. We then develop scalable stochastic gradient descent solvers for\nnon-decomposable loss functions. We show that for a large family of loss\nfunctions satisfying a certain uniform convergence property (that includes\nprec@k, pAUC, and F-measure), our methods provably converge to the empirical\nrisk minimizer. Such uniform convergence results were not known for these\nlosses and we establish these using novel proof techniques. We then use\nextensive experimentation on real life and benchmark datasets to establish that\nour method can be orders of magnitude faster than a recently proposed cutting\nplane method.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 3 figures, To appear in the proceedings of the 28th Annual\n  Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, NIPS 2014"]}]

By converting this lifetime\ninto an initial mass for the less-massive WD, and combining it with the\nspectroscopically derived mass for this WD, one can constrain the initial-final\nmass relation (IFMR). However, the number of known and well-characterized DWDs\nis small, severely limiting their usefulness for this analysis. To obtain new\nconstraints on the IFMR, we search for wide DWDs in the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) Data Release 9. We find 65 new candidate systems, thereby raising\nthe number of known wide DWDs to 142. We then engage in a spectroscopic\ncampaign to characterize these pairs, identifying 32 DA/DA pairs, two DA/DB\npairs, four DA/DAH candidate pairs, a previously unidentified candidate triple\nWD system, and five DA/DC WDs. We present a reanalysis of the constraint on the\nIFMR placed by Finley & Koester (1997) using the DWD PG 0922+162, and finish by\ndiscussing how it could be expanded to a generic set of wide DWDs.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures, to appear in the \"19th European Workshop On White\n  Dwarfs\"-ASP Conference Series"]}]

MIMO-OFDM is very helpful to transmit high data rate in\nwireless transmission and provides good maximum system capacity by getting the\nadvantages of both MIMO and OFDM. The main problem in this system is that\nincrease in number of transmit and receive antennas lead to hardware\ncomplexity. To tackle this issue, an effective optimal transmit antenna subset\nselection method is proposed in paper with the aid of Adaptive Mutation Genetic\nAlgorithm (AGA). Here, the selection of transmit antenna subsets are done by\nthe adaptive mutation of Genetic Algorithm in MIMO-OFDM system. For all the\nmutation points, the fitness function are evaluated and from that value, best\nfitness based mutation points are chosen. After the selection of best mutation\npoints, the mutation process is carried out, accordingly. The implementation of\nproposed work is done in the working platform MATLAB and the performance are\nevaluated with various selection of transmit antenna subsets. Moreover, the\ncomparison results between the existing GA with mutation and the proposed GA\nwith adaptive mutation are discussed.
