Moreover, even when\nthe topologies that emerge are the same, the locations of agents can be very\ndifferent. For instance, when information is incomplete, it is possible for a\nhub-and-spokes network with a low-value agent in the center to form and endure\npermanently: an agent can achieve a central position purely as the result of\nchance rather than as the result of merit. Perhaps even more strikingly: when\ninformation is incomplete, a connected network could form and persist even if,\nwhen information were complete, no links would ever form, so that the final\nform would be a totally disconnected network.

In our scheme a qubit interacts with a\nclassical stochastic field describing environmental noise and is then measured\nafter a given interaction time in order to estimate the characteristic\nparameters of the noise. In particular, we address estimation of the spectral\nparameters of two relevant kinds of non-Gaussian noise: random telegraph noise\nwith Lorentzian spectrum and colored noise with $1/f^{\\alpha}$ spectrum. We\ndiscuss the estimation precision achievable by quantum probes by analyzing in\ndetails the behavior of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) as a function of\nthe noise and the other parameters. We found that population measurement on the\nqubit is optimal for noise estimation and also evaluate the optimal interaction\ntimes for the quantum probe, i.e. the values maximizing the QFI and the quantum\nsignal-to-noise ratio. For random telegraph noise the QFI is inversely\nproportional to the square of the switching rate, meaning that the quantum\nsignal-to-noise ratio is constant and thus the switching rate may be uniformly\nestimated with the same precision in its whole range of variation. For colored\nnoise, the precision achievable in the estimation of ``color'', i.e. of the\nexponent $\\alpha$, strongly depends on the structure of the environment, i.e.\non the number of fluctuators describing the classical environment. For an\nenvironment modeled by a single random fluctuator estimation is more precise\nfor pink noise, i.e. for $\\alpha=1$, whereas by increasing the number of\nfluctuators, the QFI is has two local maxima, with the largest one drifting\ntowards $\\alpha=2$, i.e. brown noise.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures"]}]

We postulate the\nexistence of a scalar field singlet like the Higgs as an extra term in the SM\nLagrangian. We find that from the astrophysical point of view a very small mass\nand self-interaction is more convenient to agree with observations and from\nparticle detectors observations we do not see any essential constrain to this\nsettings. Thus, we conclude that a scalar field singlet with a small mass and\nself-interaction is a good candidate to be the nature of the dark matter.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 1 figure"]}]

To this aim we apply Merton's\napproach, as we are dealing with an incomplete market. Based on the\nsemimartingale characterization of Markov chains we first derive the HJB\nequations, which in our case correspond to a system of coupled non-linear PDEs.\nExploiting the affine structure of the model, we derive simple expressions for\nthe solution in the case with no leverage, i.e. no correlation between the\nBrownian motions driving the asset price and the stochastic factor. In the\npresence of leverage we propose a separable ansatz, which leads to explicit\nsolutions in this case as well.
