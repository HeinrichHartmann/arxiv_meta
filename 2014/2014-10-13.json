In the case of optical\nmemories, such as CDs and DVDs, this discrimination involves lossy bosonic\nchannels and can be remarkably boosted by the use of nonclassical light\n(quantum reading). Here we generalize these concepts by extending the model of\nmemory from single-cell to multi-cell encoding. In general, information is\nstored in a block of cells by using a channel-codeword, i.e., a sequence of\nchannels chosen according to a classical code. Correspondingly, the readout of\ndata is realized by a process of \"parallel\" channel discrimination, where the\nentire block of cells is probed simultaneously and decoded via an optimal\ncollective measurement. In the limit of an infinite block we define the quantum\nreading capacity of the memory, quantifying the maximum number of readable bits\nper cell. This notion of capacity is nontrivial when we suitably constrain the\nphysical resources of the decoder. For optical memories (encoding bosonic\nchannels), such a constraint is energetic and corresponds to fixing the mean\ntotal number of photons per cell. In this case, we are able to prove a\nseparation between the quantum reading capacity and the maximum information\nrate achievable by classical transmitters, i.e., arbitrary classical mixtures\nof coherent states. In fact, we can easily construct nonclassical transmitters\nthat are able to outperform any classical transmitter, thus showing that the\nadvantages of quantum reading persist in the optimal multi-cell scenario.\n","Comment: REVTeX. 16 pages. 11 figures"]}]

We note that though the result is not\noptimal with respect to the standard scaling of the Einstein equations, it is\nnevertheless critical with respect to its causal geometry.

Using a Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo likelihood analysis of the full pMSSM parameter space, we find that\na neutralino DM with mass > 10 GeV can in principle still satisfy all the\nexisting constraints. Our light neutralino solutions can be broadly divided\ninto two regions: (i) The solutions in the 10 - 30 GeV neutralino mass range\nare highly fine-tuned and require the existence of light selectrons (below 100\nGeV) in order to satisfy the observed DM relic density. We note that these are\nnot yet conclusively ruled out by the existing LEP/LHC results, and a dedicated\nanalysis valid for a non-unified gaugino mass spectrum is required to exclude\nthis possibility. (ii) The solutions with low fine-tuning are mainly in the 30\n- 46 GeV neutralino mass range. However, a major portion of it is already ruled\nout by the latest XENON100 upper limits on its spin-independent direct\ndetection cross section, and the rest of the allowed points are within the\nXENON1T projected limit. Thus, we show that the allowed MSSM parameter space\nfor a light neutralino DM below the LEP limit of 46 GeV, possible in\nsupersymmetric models without gaugino mass unification, could be completely\naccessible in near future. This might be useful in view of the recent claims\nfor positive hints of a DM signal in some direct detection experiments.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 3 tables, 6 figures; updated Figures 4 and 5; version\n  accepted for publication in JHEP"]}]

The throughput achieved over WiFi channels can be highly variable and\nalso rapidly degrades as the distance from the access point increases. While\nthis behavior is well understood at the data link layer, the interactions\nacross the various protocol layers (data link and up through the transport\nlayer) and the effect of mobility may reduce the amount of content transferred\nto the vehicle, as it travels along the roadway.\n  This paper examines the throughput achieved at the TCP layer over a carefully\ndesigned outdoor WiFi environment and the interactions across the layers that\nimpact the performance achieved, as a function of the receiver mobility. The\nexperimental studies conducted reveal that impairments over the WiFi link\n(frame loss, ARQ and increased delay) and the residual loss seen by TCP causes\na cascade of duplicate ACKs to be generated. This triggers large congestion\nwindow reductions at the sender, leading to a drastic degradation of throughput\nto the vehicular client.

Time is\nslotted and multiple users transmit packets (one packet each) simultaneously in\neach timeslot. A sink node aims to decode the messages of all the users from\nthe sequence of receptions over successive timeslots. For each timeslot, the\nNCMA receiver recovers multiple linear combinations of the packets transmitted\nin that timeslot, forming a system of linear equations. Different systems of\nlinear equations are recovered in different timeslots. A message decoder then\nrecovers the original messages of all the users by jointly solving multiple\nsystems of linear equations obtained over different timeslots. We propose a\nlow-complexity digital fountain approach for this coding problem, where each\nsource node encodes its message into a sequence of packets using a fountain\ncode. The aforementioned systems of linear equations recovered by the NCMA\nreceiver effectively couple these fountain codes together.

In a pseudo-transient\ncontinuation solution of the NPB equation, a long time integration is needed to\nreach the steady state. This calls for time stepping schemes that are stable\nand accurate for large time increments. The existing alternating direction\nimplicit (ADI) methods for the NPB equation are known to be conditionally\nstable, although being fully implicit. To overcome this difficulty, we propose\nseveral new operator splitting schemes, in both multiplicative and additive\nstyles, including locally one-dimensional (LOD) schemes and additive operator\nsplitting (AOS) schemes. The proposed schemes become much more stable than the\nADI methods, and some of them are indeed unconditionally stable in dealing with\nsolvated proteins with source singularities and non-smooth solutions.\nNumerically, the orders of convergence in both space and time are found to be\none. Nevertheless, the precision in calculating the electrostatic free energy\nis low, unless a small time increment is used. Further accuracy improvements\nare thus considered. After acceleration, the optimized LOD method can produce a\nreliable energy estimate by integrating for a small and fixed number of time\nsteps. Since one only needs to solve a tridiagonal linear system in each\nindependent one dimensional process, the overall computation is very efficient.\nThe unconditionally stable LOD method scales linearly with respect to the\nnumber of atoms in the protein studies, and is over 20 times faster than the\nconditionally stable ADI methods.\n"]}]

The Keplerian configuration for the strange star with crust\ncorresponds to values of J, T/W which are about 20% smaller than in the case of\nbare strange stars. Because the Keplerian configuration is achieved due to the\nincrease of the stellar oblateness, the Keplerian frequency (of the rotation)\nremains almost unaltered. The lack of the gap close to the Keplerian rotation\ncould imply a more stringent limit on the frequency of the ISCO, if the\nexistence of such a gap is supported by observations, as in the source 4U\n1820-30 with the upper QPO frequency 1.07 kHz. During the spin-down of a\nmagnetized strange quark star with crust, the crust matter is absorbed in the\nequatorial region by the strange matter core. The deconfinement of absorbed\ncrust matter is a strongly exothermic process, which would influence the\ncooling curve of this compact object.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

The model points to the possible\nexistence of newly formed dark matter in the inter-cluster voids. We argue that\nsome of this matter could be accreting onto clusters through the latter's long\nrange gravitational potentials. If so, then cluster dark matter halos may not\nmanifest clear cut-offs in their radial density profiles. Furthermore, if a\nsubstantial amount of this newly produced matter has already drained onto the\nclusters, then the CMB power spectrum may favor lower dark matter density\nvalues than is currently observed bound in the clusters. A final feature of our\napproach relates to the combined effect of the matter production by a decaying\nvacuum and the different rates at which matter and the vacuum will dilute with\nthe scale factor. Such combination may create conditions for a universe in\nwhich the vacuum and matter densities dilute and evolve towards comparable\namplitudes. In this sense the model offers a natural and conceptually simple\nexplanation to the Coincidence Problem.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 1 figure, accepted for publication in Int. J. Mod. Phys.\n  Lett.A"]}]

Previous studies of this SNR have shown\nthat it harbors a central X-ray `hot spot' suggestive of a compact object\nassociated with 3C 397. With the Chandra data, we can rule out the nature of\nthe hot spot as a pulsar or a pulsar wind nebula, and put an upper limit on the\nflux of a hidden compact object of F (0.5--10 keV)~6E-13 erg/cm2/s.

The Chandra image reveals arcseconds-scale clumps and\nknots which are strongly correlated with the radio VLA image, except for the\nX-ray hot spot. Our Chandra spatially resolved spectroscopic study shows that\none-component models are inadequate, and that at least two non-equilibrium\nionization thermal components are needed to fit the spectra of each selected\nregion. The derived average spectral parameters are consistent with the\nprevious global ASCA fits performed by Safi-Harb et al. (2000). However, the\nhard component requires a high abundance of Fe indicating the presence of hot\nFe ejecta.

Our multi-wavelength imaging and spectral study favors the scenario where\n3C 397 is a ~5,300-year old SNR expanding in a medium with a marked density\ngradient, and which is likely to be encountering a molecular cloud on the\nwestern side.

The broad-band spectral characteristics of the X-ray continuum\nobserved with XMM during 2001 April, reveal the presence of a third layer of\nabsorption consisting of a very large column (~2.5 x 10E23 cm^-2) of highly\nionized gas with a covering fraction ~50%. This low covering fraction suggests\nthat the absorber lies within a few lt-days of the X-ray source and/or is\nfilamentary in structure. Interestingly, these absorbers are not in thermal\nequilibrium with one another. The two new components are too highly ionized to\nbe radiatively accelerated, which we suggest is evidence for a hydromagnetic\norigin for the outflow. Applying our model to the Nov dataset, we can account\nfor the spectral variability primarily by a drop in the ionization states of\nthe absorbers, as expected by the change in the continuum flux. When this\ncomplex absorption is accounted for we find the underlying continuum to be\ntypical of Seyfert 1 galaxies. The spectral curvature attributed to the high\ncolumn absorber, in turn, reduces estimates of the flux and extent of any broad\nFe emission line from the accretion disk.\n","Comment: 33 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

Individual\nshock structures are resolved in the H2 emission, with inferred edge-on shock\nthickness ~1e17 cm, consistent with non-dissociative shocks into gas densities\nof 1e3-1e4 cm-3. Bright 1720 MHz OH masers are located within the shocked H2\ngas complexes and highlight only localized areas where the conditions for\nmasing are optimal. The Halpha and X-ray emission, have morphologies very\ndifferent from the radio. We find a detailed correlation of the radio and H2\nemission for some long filaments, indicating cosmic ray acceleration or\nre-acceleration due to the shocks into moderately dense gas. The different\nmorphologies of these two remnants at different wavelengths is explained by a\nhighly nonuniform structure for giant molecular clouds.\n","Comment: ApJ, in press; several figures in jpg form"]}]

Its K-L' color is consistent with a spectral type early to\nmid L. Our NACO K-band spectrum yields spectral type M9-L4 with H2O and CO\nabsorption, consistent with the new GAIA-Dusty template spectrum for log g = 2\nto 3 and Teff = 2000 K with ~2 Rjup radius at ~140 pc, hence few Jupiter\nmasses.

Our long-slit spectroscopy yields\nestimates of star formation rates in environments from cluster cores to the\ngeneral large-scale structure. The fraction of galaxies with current star\nformation in their inner disks as traced by H-alpha emission increases with\ndistance from the cluster and converges to the ``field'' value only at 2-3\nvirial radii, in agreement with other investigations. However, among galaxies\nwith significant current star formation (EW[Ha]geq2\\AA), there is no difference\nin the distribution of EW[Ha] inside and outside the virial radius.

The redshift evolution of K^{*} for both EM+BAL\nand ELL types is consistent with a passively evolving stellar population formed\nat high-redshift. Passive evolution in both classes, as well as the total\ncluster luminosity function, demonstrates that the bulk of the stellar\npopulation in all bright cluster galaxies is formed at high-redshift and\nsubsequent transformations in morphology/color/spectral-type have little effect\non the total stellar mass.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 16 figures, accepted by ApJ"]}]

Because the [CII] emission and\nH_2 emission arise on the surface of the cloud and the lines are optically\nthin, these lines are not affected by changes in the relative sizes of the\nneutral cloud and the CO bearing core, while the optically thick CO emission\ncan be strongly affected. The sizes of clouds are estimated by measuring the\ndeviation of CO emission strength from that predicted by a planar cloud model\nof a given size. The average cloud column density and therefore size increases\nas the metallicity decreases. Our result agrees with the photoionization\nregulated star formation theory by Mc Kee (1989).\n","Comment: 45 Pages including 15 figures.

The differential equations derived in this perturbative\ncontext, and other observables necessary in our analysis, are solved\nnumerically. The results show that our perturbed Einstein-de Sitter cosmology\ncan be approximately described by a decaying power-law like average density\nprofile, meaning that the dust distribution of this cosmology has a scaling\nbehaviour compatible with the power-law profile of the density-distance\ncorrelation observed in the galaxy catalogues. These results show that, in the\ncontext of this work, the apparent fractal conjecture is correct.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 1 figure, LaTeX.

In such\na mixture, two fermionic atoms can interact with each other by exchanging a\nphonon that propagates through the Bose condensate. We calculate the\ninteraction potential due to this mechanism and determine the effective s-wave\nscattering length for two fermions that interact, both directly by the\ninteratomic potentials, as well as by the above mentioned exchange mechanism.\nWe find that the effective scattering length is quite sensitive to changes in\nthe condensate density and becomes strongly energy dependent. In addition, we\nconsider the mechanical stability of these mixtures and also calculate the\ndispersion and the damping of the various collisionless collective modes of the\ngas.\n","Comment: Corrected some typo's, made some changes to the figures and addes two\n  new references"]}]

Working with such\noperads, we characterize coherent unit actions in terms of linear equations of\nthe generators of the operads. We then use these equations to give all possible\noperad relations that allow such coherent unit actions. We further show that\ncoherent unit actions are preserved under taking products and thus yield Hopf\nalgebras on the free object of the product operads when the factor operads have\ncoherent unit actions. On the other hand, coherent unit actions are never\npreserved under taking the dual in the operadic sense except for the operad of\nassociative algebras.\n"]}]
