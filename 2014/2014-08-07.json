As one ages there\nare a number of physical, chemical and biological changes that take place.\nTherefore it is logical to assume that the brain is no exception to this\nphenomenon. The principle purpose of this project is to use models of neural\ndynamics and learning based on the underlying principle of self-organised\ncriticality, to account for the age related cognitive effects. In this regard\nlearning in neural networks can serve as a model for the acquisition of skills\nand knowledge in early development stages i.e. the ageing process and\ncriticality in the network serves as the optimum state of cognitive abilities.\nPossible candidate mechanisms for ageing in a neural network are loss of\nconnectivity and neurons, increase in the level of noise, reduction in white\nmatter or more interestingly longer learning history and the competition among\nseveral optimization objectives. In this paper we are primarily interested in\nthe affect of the longer learning history on memory and thus the optimality in\nthe brain. Hence it is hypothesized that prolonged learning in the form of\nassociative memory patterns can destroy the state of criticality in the\nnetwork. We base our model on Tsodyks and Markrams [49] model of dynamic\nsynapses, in the process to explore the effect of combining standard Hebbian\nlearning with the phenomenon of Self-organised criticality.

These\nenhancements are then used to improve the best known constants of the\nHardy--Littlewood inequality; this inequality asserts that for a positive\ninteger $m\\geq2$ with $2m\\leq p\\leq\\infty$ and $\\mathbb{K}=\\mathbb{R}$ or\n$\\mathbb{C}$ there exists a constant $C_{m,p}^{\\mathbb{K}}\\geq1$ such that, for\nall continuous $m$--linear forms\n$T:\\ell_{p}^{n}\\times\\cdots\\times\\ell_{p}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{K}$, and all\npositive integers $n$,% \\[ \\left( \\sum_{j_{1},...,j_{m}=1}^{n}\\left\\vert\nT(e_{j_{1}},...,e_{j_{m}% })\\right\\vert ^{\\frac{2mp}{mp+p-2m}}\\right)\n^{\\frac{mp+p-2m}{2mp}}\\leq C_{m,p}^{\\mathbb{K}}\\left\\Vert T\\right\\Vert , \\] and\nthe exponent $\\frac{2mp}{mp+p-2m}$ is sharp. In particular, we show that for $p\n> 2m^{3}-4m^{2}+2m$ the optimal constants satisfying the above inequality are\ndominated by the best known estimates for the constants of the $m$-linear\nBohnenblust--Hille inequality. More precisely if $\\gamma$ denotes the\nEuler--Mascheroni constant, considering the case of complex scalars as an\nillustration, we show that% \\[\nC_{m,p}^{\\mathbb{C}}\\leq\\prod\\limits_{j=2}^{m}\\Gamma\\left( 2-\\frac{1}%\n{j}\\right) ^{\\frac{j}{2-2j}}<m^{\\frac{1-\\gamma}{2}}, \\] which is somewhat\nsurprising since this new formula has no dependence on $p$ (the former estimate\ndepends on $p$ but, paradoxally, is worse than this new one). This suggests the\nfollowing open problems:\n  1) Are the optimal constants of the Hardy--Littlewood inequality and\nBohnenblust--Hille inequalities the same?\n  2) Are the optimal constants of the Hardy--Littlewood inequality independent\nof $p$ (at least for large $p$)?\n"]}]
