This paper focuses on reducing energy\nconsumption of Ethernet passive optical network (EPON) as one of the most\nefficient transmission technologies for broadband access. In EPON, the\ndownstream traffic is sent from the optical line terminal (OLT) located at the\ncentral office to all optical network units (ONUs). Each ONU checks all arrival\ndownstream packets and selects the downstream packets destined to itself.\nTherefore, receivers at ONUs have to always stay awake, thus consuming a large\namount of energy. Contrariwise, an ONU transmitter can be triggered by the\narrival of the upstream traffic and so it can go to the low power mode when no\ntraffic is observed. Putting ONUs into the low power mode during light traffic\nis a known strategy for energy saving. In this article, we address the\ndownstream challenge and also improve the ONU transmitter sleep time by\nproposing a simple sleep control scheme. We also propose an upstream and a\ndownstream sleep-aware traffic scheduling scheme to avoid missing the packets\nduring the sleep states.

High priority customers receive priority in the sense\nthat they are always served before any low priority customers. But high\npriority customers have a second advantage over low priority customers. Low\npriority customers are served according to the gated service discipline, i.e.\nonly customers standing in front of the gate are served during this visit. In\ncontrast, high priority customers arriving during the visit period of the queue\nare allowed to pass the gate and all low priority customers before the gate.\n  We study the cycle time distribution, the waiting time distributions for each\ncustomer type, the joint queue length distribution of all priority classes at\nall queues at polling epochs, and the steady-state marginal queue length\ndistributions for each customer type.

Effects of grain-grain processing on\n  molecular line emission"],"description":["  Grain-grain processing has been shown to be an indispensable ingredient of\nshock modelling in high density environments. For densities higher than\n\\sim10^5 cm-3, shattering becomes a self-enhanced process that imposes severe\nchemical and dynamical consequences on the shock characteristics. Shattering is\naccompanied by the vaporization of grains, which can directly release SiO to\nthe gas phase. Given that SiO rotational line radiation is used as a major\ntracer of shocks in dense clouds, it is crucial to understand the influence of\nvaporization on SiO line emission. We have developed a recipe for implementing\nthe effects of shattering and vaporization into a 2-fluid shock model,\nresulting in a reduction of computation time by a factor \\sim100 compared to a\nmulti-fluid modelling approach. This implementation was combined with an\nLVG-based modelling of molecular line radiation transport. Using this model we\ncalculated grids of shock models to explore the consequences of different\ndust-processing scenarios. Grain-grain processing is shown to have a strong\ninfluence on C-type shocks for a broad range of magnetic fields: they become\nhotter and thinner. The reduction in column density of shocked gas lowers the\nintensity of molecular lines, at the same time as higher peak temperatures\nincrease the intensity of highly excited transitions compared to shocks without\ngrain-grain processing. For OH the net effect is an increase in line\nintensities, while for CO and H2O it is the contrary. The intensity of H2\nemission is decreased in low transitions and increased for highly excited\nlines. For all molecules, the highly excited lines become sensitive to the\nvalue of the magnetic field. Although vaporization increases the intensity of\nSiO rotational lines, this effect is weakened by the reduced shock width. The\nrelease of SiO early in the hot shock changes the excitation characteristics of\nSiO radiation.\n","Comment: Published in Astronomy and Astrophysics (2013). 26 pages, 16 figures,\n  14 tables"]}]

Resurfacing mechanics has become a new focus for asteroid\nresearchers due to its important implications for interpreting surface\nobservations, including space weathering effects. This paper provides a\nprediction for the tidal effects during the 2029 encounter, with an emphasis on\nwhether surface refreshing due to regolith movement will occur.

A\nfull-body model of Apophis is sent past the Earth on the predicted trajectory\nto generate the data of all forces acting at a target point on the surface.

The goal of the vendors is\nto maximize their revenue via pricing of the items, given that the buyer will\nbuy the set of items that maximizes his net payoff.\n  We show this game may not always have a pure Nash equilibrium, in contrast to\nprevious results for the special case where each vendor owns a single item. We\ndo so by relating our game to an intermediate, discrete game in which the\nvendors only choose the available items, and their prices are set exogenously\nafterwards.\n  We further make use of the intermediate game to provide tight bounds on the\nprice of anarchy for the subset games that have pure Nash equilibria; we find\nthat the optimal PoA reached in the previous special cases does not hold, but\nonly a logarithmic one.\n  Finally, we show that for a special case of submodular functions, efficient\npure Nash equilibria always exist.\n"]}]

The convergents are formed by truncating\nthe Continued Fraction Expansion (CFE) of Cb immediately before the CFE HWMs.\nThese patterns have been extended from the known patterns in the CFE HWMs of\nChampernowne's Constant in base ten. We show that the patterns may be used to\nefficiently calculate the CFE coefficients of Cb, and to calculate and predict\nthe lengths of the HWM coefficients, the number of correct digits of Cb as\ncalculated by the convergent, and the convergent error. We have discovered that\nminor corrections to the pattern formulations in base 10 are required for some\nbases, and these corrections are presented and discussed. The resulting\nformulations may be used to make the calculations for Cb in any base.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 6 tables; extends the main conjectures of arXiv:1210.1263\n  from base 10 to other bases, with minor modifications in some bases"]}]
