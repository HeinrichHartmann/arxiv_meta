An important\ncontribution in this context is given by modal logics for strategic ability, in\nthe setting of multi-agent games, such as ATL, ATL\\star, and the like.\nRecently, Chatterjee, Henzinger, and Piterman introduced Strategy Logic, which\nwe denote here by CHP-SL, with the aim of getting a powerful framework for\nreasoning explicitly about strategies. CHP-SL is obtained by using first-order\nquantifications over strategies and has been investigated in the very specific\nsetting of two-agents turned-based games, where a non-elementary model-checking\nalgorithm has been provided. While CHP-SL is a very expressive logic, we claim\nthat it does not fully capture the strategic aspects of multi-agent systems. In\nthis paper, we introduce and study a more general strategy logic, denoted SL,\nfor reasoning about strategies in multi-agent concurrent games. We prove that\nSL includes CHP-SL, while maintaining a decidable model-checking problem. In\nparticular, the algorithm we propose is computationally not harder than the\nbest one known for CHP-SL. Moreover, we prove that such a problem for SL is\nNonElementarySpace-hard. This negative result has spurred us to investigate\nhere syntactic fragments of SL, strictly subsuming ATL\\star, with the hope of\nobtaining an elementary model-checking problem. Among the others, we study the\nsublogics SL[NG], SL[BG], and SL[1G].

A common model for gossip communication is the random\nphone call model, in which in each synchronous round each node can PUSH or PULL\ninformation to or from a random other node. For example, Karp et al. [FOCS\n2000] gave algorithms in this model that spread a message to all nodes in\n$\\Theta(\\log n)$ rounds while sending only $O(\\log \\log n)$ messages per node\non average.\n  Recently, Avin and Els\\\"asser [DISC 2013], studied the random phone call\nmodel with the natural and commonly used assumption of direct addressing.\nDirect addressing allows nodes to directly contact nodes whose ID (e.g., IP\naddress) was learned before.

We investigate how host\nmixtures can improve disease control using a population dynamics model.

The fit is performed by constraining the sum of\nexclusive branching fractions to the measured value of $BF(B\\to X_cl\\nu)$, and\nwith different sets of additional constraining terms for the directly measured\nbranching fractions. There is no fit scenario in which a single branching\nfraction alone is enhanced to close the gap between $BF(B\\to X_cl\\nu)$ and the\nsum of known branching fractions $BF_i(B\\to X_c^il\\nu)$. The fitted $BF(B\\to\nD^*l\\nu)$ is 5% to 10% larger than the direct measurement depending on whether\nor not $BF(B\\to D^*l\\nu)$ is constrained to its direct measurement. $BF(B\\to\nDl\\nu)$ values are in good agreement with the direct measurement unless\n$BF(B\\to D^*l\\nu)$ is constrained, which results in a higher $BF(B\\to Dl\\nu)$\nvalue. Within large uncertainties, $BF(B\\to D'_1l\\nu)$ agrees with direct\nmeasurements. Depending on the fit scenario, $BF(B\\to D_0l\\nu)$ is consistent\nwith or larger than its direct measurement. The fit is not able to easily\ndisentangle $B\\to D_1l\\nu$ and $B\\to D_2l\\nu$, and tends to increase the sum of\nthese two branching fractions. $BF(B\\to (D^{(*)}\\pi)_{nr}l\\nu)$ with\nnon-resonant $(D^{(*)}\\pi)_{nr}$ final states is found to be 0.2-0.4%,\nconsistent with $B\\to D^{(*)}\\pi l\\nu$ and $B\\to D^{**}(D^{(*)}\\pi)l\\nu$\nmeasurements.
