The problem of computing boxicity is inapproximable\neven for graph classes like bipartite, co-bipartite and split graphs within\n$O(n^{1 - \\epsilon})$-factor, for any $\\epsilon >0$ in polynomial time unless\n$NP=ZPP$. We give FPT approximation algorithms for computing the boxicity of\ngraphs, where the parameter used is the vertex or edge edit distance of the\ngiven graph from families of graphs of bounded boxicity. This can be seen as a\ngeneralization of the parameterizations discussed in \\cite{Adiga2}.\n  Extending the same idea in one of our algorithms, we also get an\n$O\\left(\\frac{n\\sqrt{\\log \\log n}}{\\sqrt{\\log n}}\\right)$ factor approximation\nalgorithm for computing boxicity and an $O\\left(\\frac{n {(\\log \\log\nn)}^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{\\sqrt{\\log n}}\\right)$ factor approximation algorithm for\ncomputing the cubicity. These seem to be the first $o(n)$ factor approximation\nalgorithms known for both boxicity and cubicity. As a consequence of this\nresult, a $o(n)$ factor approximation algorithm for computing the partial order\ndimension of finite posets and a $o(n)$ factor approximation algorithm for\ncomputing the threshold dimension of split graphs would follow.\n"]}]

Hess, Nobel Lecture,\nDecember 12, 1936\n  High-energy radiation bursts are commonplace in our Universe. From nearby\nsolar flares to distant gamma ray bursts, a variety of physical processes\naccelerate charged particles to a wide range of energies, which subsequently\nreach the Earth. Such particles contribute to a number of physical processes\noccurring in the Earth system. A large fraction of the energy of charged\nparticles gets deposited in the atmosphere, ionizing the atmosphere, causing\nchanges in its chemistry and affecting the global electric circuit. Remaining\nsecondary particles contribute to the background dose of cosmic rays on the\nsurface and parts of the subsurface region. Life has evolved over the past ~ 3\nbillion years in presence of this background radiation, which itself has varied\nconsiderably during the period. As demonstrated by the Miller-Urey experiment,\nlightning plays a very important role in the formation of complex organic\nmolecules, which are the building blocks of more complex structures forming\nlife. There is growing evidence of increase in the lightning rate with\nincreasing flux of charged particles. Is there a connection between enhanced\nrate of cosmic rays and the origin of life? Cosmic ray secondaries are also\nknown to damage DNA and cause mutations, leading to cancer and other diseases.\nIt is now possible to compute radiation doses from secondary particles, in\nparticular muons and neutrons.

In radio, 3 compact components are resolved in the\ninnermost part of the jet. One of them shows a similar trend as the LAT and KVA\nlight curves. The 0.1-650 GeV spectra measured simultaneously with MAGIC and\nFermi-LAT can be well fitted either by a log-parabola or by a power-law with a\nsub-exponential cutoff for both campaigns. A single-zone\nsynchrotron-self-Compton model, with an electron spectrum following a power-law\nwith an exponential cutoff, can explain the broadband SED and the multi-band\nbehavior of the source.

The most famous example is the MixColumns operation\nof the AES block cipher.\n  In this example, the MDS matrix was carefully chosen to obtain compact and\nefficient implementations. However, this MDS matrix is dedicated to 8-bit\nwords, and is not always adapted to lightweight applications. Recently, several\nstudies have been devoted to the construction of recursive diffusion layers.\nSuch a method allows to apply an MDS matrix using an iterative process which\nlooks like a Feistel network with linear functions instead of nonlinear.\n  Our approach is quite different. We present a generic construction of\nclassical MDS matrices that are not recursively computed, but that are strong\nsymmetric in order to either accelerate their evaluation with a minimal number\nof look-up tables, or to perform this evaluation with a minimal number of gates\nin a circuit. We call this particular kind of matrices \"dyadic matrices\", since\nthey are related to dyadic codes. We study some basic properties of such\nmatrices. We introduce a generic construction of involutive dyadic MDS matrices\nfrom Reed Solomon codes. Finally, we discuss the implementation aspects of\nthese dyadic MDS matrices in order to build efficient block ciphers.\n","Comment: This paper has been withdrawn.

This contribution focuses on the estimation of the symmetry\nenergy from experiment and how it is related to the structure of neutron stars.\nThe most important connection is between the radii of neutron stars and the\npressure of neutron star matter in the vicinity of the nuclear saturation\ndensity $n_s$. This pressure is essentially controlled by the nuclear symmetry\nenergy parameters $S_v$ and $L$, the first two coefficients of a Taylor\nexpansion of the symmetry energy around $n_s$. We discuss constraints on these\nparameters that can be found from nuclear experiments. We demonstrate that\nthese constraints are largely model-independent by deriving them qualitatively\nfrom a simple nuclear model. We also summarize how recent theoretical studies\nof pure neutron matter can reinforce these constraints. To date, several\ndifferent astrophysical measurements of neutron star radii have been attempted.\nAttention is focused on photospheric radius expansion bursts and on thermal\nemissions from quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries. While none of these\nobservations can, at the present time, determine individual neutron star radii\nto better than 20% accuracy, the body of observations can be used with Bayesian\ntechniques to effectively constrain them to higher precision. These techniques\ninvert the structure equations and obtain estimates of the pressure-density\nrelation of neutron star matter, not only near $n_s$, but up to the highest\ndensities found in neutron star interiors.

Current debate\nconcerns the pace at which domesticated plants emerged from cultivated wild\npopulations and how many genes were involved. Here we present simulations that\ntest how many genes could have been involved by considering the cost of\nselection. We demonstrate the selection load that can be endured by populations\nincreases with decreasing selection coefficients and greater numbers of loci\ndown to values of about s = 0.005, causing a driving force that increases the\nnumber of loci under selection. As the number of loci under selection\nincreases, an effect of co-selection increases resulting in individual unlinked\nloci being fixed more rapidly in out-crossing populations, representing a\nsecond driving force to increase the number of loci under selection. In\ninbreeding systems co-selection results in interference and reduced rates of\nfixation but does not reduce the size of the selection load that can be\nendured. These driving forces result in an optimum pace of genome evolution in\nwhich 50-100 loci are the most that could be under selection in a cultivation\nregime. Furthermore, the simulations do not preclude the existence of selective\nsweeps but demonstrate that they come at a cost of the selection load that can\nbe endured and consequently a reduction of the capacity of plants to adapt to\nnew environments, which may contribute to the explanation of why selective\nsweeps have been so rarely detected in genome studies.\n"]}]

In particular, a noncooperative game is formulated between\ncustomer-owned storage units where each storage unit's owner can decide on\nwhether to charge or discharge energy with a given probability so as to\nmaximize a utility that reflects the tradeoff between the monetary transactions\nfrom charging/discharging and the penalty from power regulation. Unlike\nexisting game-theoretic works which assume that players make their decisions\nrationally and objectively, we use the new framework of prospect theory (PT) to\nexplicitly incorporate the users' subjective perceptions of their expected\nutilities. For the two-player game, we show the existence of a proper mixed\nNash equilibrium for both the standard game-theoretic case and the case with PT\nconsiderations. Simulation results show that incorporating user behavior via PT\nreveals several important insights into load management as well as economics of\nenergy storage usage. For instance, the results show that deviations from\nconventional game theory, as predicted by PT, can lead to undesirable grid\nloads and revenues thus requiring the power company to revisit its pricing\nschemes and the customers to reassess their energy storage usage choices.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures, conference"]}]
