Among other\nscenarios considered, it has been proposed that eccentricity may grow through\nplanet-disc interaction. Recently, it has been noticed that the thermodynamical\nstate of the disc can significantly influence the migration properties of\ngrowing protoplanets. However, the evolution of planetary eccentricity in\nradiative discs has not been considered yet. In this paper we study the\nevolution of planets on eccentric orbits that are embedded in a\nthree-dimensional viscous disc and analyse the disc's effect on the orbital\nevolution of the planet. We use the three-dimensional hydrodynamical code\nNIRVANA that includes full tensor viscosity and implicit radiation transport in\nthe flux-limited diffusion approximation. The code uses the FARGO-algorithm to\nspeed up the simulations. First we measure the torque and power exerted on the\nplanet by the disc for fixed orbits, and then we let the planet start with\ninitial eccentricity and evolve it in the disc. For locally isothermal we\nconfirm previous results and find eccentricity damping and inward migration for\nplanetary cores. In the case of radiative discs, the planets experience an\ninward migration as long as its eccentricity lies above a certain threshold.\nAfter the damping of eccentricity cores with masses below 33 Earthmasses begin\nto migrate outward in radiative discs, while higher mass cores always migrate\ninward. For all planetary masses studied (up to 200 Earthmasses) we find\neccentricity damping. In viscous discs the orbital eccentricity of embedded\nplanets is damped during the evolution independent of the mass. Hence,\nplanet-disc interaction does not seem to be a viable mechanism to explain the\nobserved high eccentricity of exoplanets.\n","Comment: 18 pages, Astronomy&Astrophysics, in press"]}]

An important problem has been that standard migration\ntheories predict very rapid inward migration, which poses problems for\npopulation synthesis models. However, it has been shown recently that low-mass\nplanets (20-30 Earth Masses) that are still embedded in the protoplanetary disc\ncan migrate outwards under certain conditions. Simulations have been performed\nmostly for planets at given radii for a particular disc model. Here, we plan to\nextend previous work and consider different masses of the disc to quantify the\ninfluence of the physical disc conditions on planetary migration.

For planets on circular orbits at various locations we\nmeasure the radial dependece of the torques.

Inside\nand outside this intervall, migration is inward and given by the Lindblad value\nfor large radii. Because outward migration stops at a certain location in the\ndisc, there exists a zero-torque distance for planetary embryos, where they can\ncontinue to grow without moving too fast. For higher disc masses (M_disc > 0.02\nM_Sol) convection ensues, which changes the structure of the disc and therefore\nthe torque on the planet as well. Outward migration stops at different points\nin the disc for different planetary masses, resulting in a quite extended\nregion where the formation of larger cores might be easier. In higher mass\ndiscs, convection changes the disc's structure resulting in fluctuations in the\nsurface density, which influence the torque acting on the planet, and therefore\nits migration rate.\n"]}]

Most GUIs do\nnot have a fixed layout, but are resizable and able to adapt themselves.\nConstraints are a powerful tool for specifying adaptable GUI layouts: they are\nused to specify a layout in a general form, and a constraint solver is used to\nfind a satisfying concrete layout, e.g.\\ for a specific GUI size. The\nconstraint solver has to calculate a new layout every time a GUI is resized or\nchanged, so it needs to be efficient to ensure a good user experience. One\napproach for constraint solvers is based on the Gauss-Seidel algorithm and\nsuccessive over-relaxation (SOR).\n  Our observation is that a solution after resizing or changing is similar in\nstructure to a previous solution. Thus, our hypothesis is that we can increase\nthe computational performance of an SOR-based constraint solver if we reuse the\nsolution of a previous layout to warm-start the solving of a new layout. In\nthis paper we report on experiments to test this hypothesis experimentally for\nthree common use cases: big-step resizing, small-step resizing and constraint\nchange. In our experiments, we measured the solving time for randomly generated\nGUI layout specifications of various sizes. For all three cases we found that\nthe performance is improved if an existing solution is used as a starting\nsolution for a new layout.\n"]}]
