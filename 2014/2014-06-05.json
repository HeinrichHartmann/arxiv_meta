In objects brighter than L*, fitting a single\nSersic profile to what is really a two-component SerExp system leads to biases:\nthe half-light radius is increasingly overestimated as n of the fitted single\ncomponent increases; it is also overestimated at B/T ~ 0.6. However, the net\neffect on the R-L relation is small, except for the most luminous tail, where\nit curves upwards towards larger sizes. We also study how this relation depends\non morphological type. Our analysis is one of the first to use\nBayesian-classifier derived weights, rather than hard cuts, to define\nmorphology. Crudely, there appear to be only two relations: one for early-types\n(Es, S0s and Sa's) and another for late-types (Sbs and Scds). However, closer\ninspection shows that within the early-type sample S0s tend to be 15% smaller\nthan Es of the same luminosity, and, among faint late types, Sbs are more than\n25% smaller than Scds. Neither the early- nor the late-type relations are pure\npower-laws: both show significant curvature, which we quantify. However, the\nR-L relations of the bulges of early-types are almost pure power laws. Our\nanalysis confirms that two mass scales are special for early-type galaxies: M*\n= 3e10 and 2e11 Msun. These same mass scales are also special for late types:\nthere is almost no correlation between R and M* below the former, and almost no\nlate-types above the latter. We also show that the intrinsic scatter around the\nrelation decreases at large luminosity and/or stellar mass; this should provide\nadditional constraints on models of how the most massive galaxies formed.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 31 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

This statistics is a sensitive measure of\nsmall scale (sub-)structure of dark matter haloes. By analysing the structure\nof $P^2SAD$ in Milky-Way-size haloes using the Aquarius simulations, we find it\nto be nearly universal at small scales, i.e. small separations in phase space,\nwhere substructures dominate. This remarkable universality occurs across time\nand in regions of substantially different ambient densities (by nearly four\norders of magnitude), with typical variations in $P^2SAD$ of a factor of a few.\nThe maximum variations occur in regions where substructures have been strongly\ndisrupted. The universality is also preserved across haloes of similar mass but\ndiverse mass accretion histories and subhalo distributions. The universality is\nalso broken at large scales, where the smooth dark matter distribution in the\nhalo dominates. Although at small scales the structure of $P^2SAD$ is roughly\ndescribed by a subhalo model, we argue that the simulation data is better\nfitted by a family of superellipse contours. This functional shape is inspired\nby a model that extends the stable clustering hypothesis into phase space.

Our model is based on the stable clustering\nhypothesis in phase space, the spherical collapse model, and tidal disruption\nof substructures, which is calibrated against the Aquarius simulations. Using\nthis model, we can predict the behaviour of $P^2SAD$ in the numerically\nunresolved regime, down to the decoupling mass limit of generic WIMP models.\nThis prediction can be used to estimate signals sensitive to the small scale\nstructure of dark matter. For example, the dark matter annihilation rate can be\nestimated for arbitrary velocity-dependent cross sections in a convenient way\nusing a limit of $P^2SAD$ to zero separation in physical space. We illustrate\nour method by computing the global and local subhalo annihilation boost to that\nof the smooth dark matter distribution in a Milky-Way-size halo. Two cases are\nconsidered, one where the cross section is velocity independent and one that\napproximates Sommerfeld-enhanced models.

In CAdS and\nBertotti--Robinson spacetimes the radial geodesics which infinitely many times\noscillate between antipodal points in the space contain infinite number of\nequally separated conjugate points and there are no other cut points. Yet in\nthese two spacetimes each outgoing or ingoing radial geodesic which does not\ncross the centre is globally of maximal length. Circular geodesics exist only\nin CAdS spacetime and contain an infinite sequence of equally separated\nconjugate points. The geodesic curves which intersect the circular ones at\nthese points may either belong to the two-surface $\\theta=\\pi/2$ or lie outside\nit.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 0 figures, typos corrected, version published in APP B"]}]

In this paper, we\npresent a novel and efficient Bayesian framework that combines the results from\ndifferent photo-$z$ techniques into a more powerful and robust estimate by\nmaximizing the information from the photometric data. To demonstrate this we\nuse a supervised machine learning technique based on random forest, an\nunsupervised method based on self-organizing maps, and a standard template\nfitting method but can be easily extend to other existing techniques. We use\ndata from the DEEP2 and the SDSS surveys to explore different methods for\ncombining the predictions from these techniques. By using different performance\nmetrics, we demonstrate that we can improve the accuracy of our final photo-$z$\nestimate over the best input technique, that the fraction of outliers is\nreduced, and that the identification of outliers is significantly improved when\nwe apply a Na\\\"{\\i}ve Bayes Classifier to this combined information. Our more\nrobust and accurate photo-$z$ PDFs will allow even more precise cosmological\nconstraints to be made by using current and future photometric surveys.

The explosive system studied is an ideal\ngas with a single exothermic reaction governed by a pressure-dependent reaction\nrate ($p^n$) with a pressure exponent of $n = 3$. A pressure-dependent reaction\nrate, rather than the exponential dependence of reaction on temperature of\nArrhenius kinetics, is used so that the detonation wave is stable in the\nhomogeneous case and can be modelled with simple, analytical techniques, and\nthus the effect of introducing heterogeneity can be clearly identified. The\ntwo-dimensional slab of explosive is bounded by a layer of inert gas with the\nsame thermodynamic properties as the explosive. The heterogeneity is introduced\ninto the explosive via a large-amplitude, two-dimensional sinusoidal ripple in\ndensity in the initialization of the simulation, while maintaining a constant\npressure. The computational simulations are initialized with a ZND solution for\nthe ideal CJ detonation, and the detonation is allowed to propagate into the\nexplosive layer. The simulations show that the detonation in the heterogeneous\nmedia exhibits a cellular-like structure of complex shock interactions. The\ndetonation is able to propagate into a significantly thinner layer of explosive\nand can exhibit a greater velocity than the corresponding homogeneous case. A\nparametric study of varying the wavelength of the sinusoid shows the existence\nof an optimal size of heterogeneity at which the favorable effect is the\ngreatest corresponding to a wavelength that is approximately 10 to 50 times the\nhalf reaction zone length of the ideal CJ detonation.

In the first part we study the production, nature and decay\nprocesses of cosmic superstrings in two widely used effective models of D-brane\ninflation, namely the $D3/D7$ and $D3/\\bar{D}3$ models. Specifically, we show\nthat the strings produced in $D3/D7$ are of local axionic type and we place\nconstraints on the tension while arguing that the supersymmetry breaking\nmechanism of the model needs to be altered according to supergravity\nconstraints on constant Fayet-Iliopoulos terms. Moreover, we study radiative\nprocesses of cosmic superstrings on warped backgrounds. We argue that placing\nthe string formation in a natural context such as $D3/\\bar{D}3$ inflation,\nrestricts the forms of possible radiation from these objects. Motivated by\nthese string models, which inevitably result in the presence of heavy moduli\nfields during inflation, in the second part, using the Effective Field Theory\n(EFT) of inflation, we construct operators that capture the effects of massive\nscalars on the low energy dynamics of inflaton perturbations.

A unitary ring of square matrices\nis an associative hypercomplex algebra by definition.
