The main\ncontribution of this article is to show that dimensional reduction effects are\ndue to General Relativity at singularities, and do not need to be postulated\nad-hoc.\n  Recent advances in understanding the geometry of singularities do not require\nmodification of General Relativity, being just non-singular extensions of its\nmathematics to the limit cases.

Effectively, it is like one or more dimensions of spacetime just\nvanish at singularities.

The chiral-achiral transition mimics the order-disorder\ntransition of the mean-field Ising model. The role of the magnetisation in the\nIsing model is played by the degree of twist. The role of the temperature is\nplayed by the aspect ratio of the torus. Remarkably, an external field does not\nbreak the chiral symmetry explicitly, but shifts the transition.

The underlying\nmatrix product state (MPS) ansatz is a low-rank decomposition of the full\nconfiguration interaction tensor. The virtual dimension of the MPS controls the\nsize of the corner of the many-body Hilbert space that can be reached.\n  Whereas the MPS ansatz will only yield an efficient description for\nnoncritical one-dimensional systems, it can still be used as a variational\nansatz for other finite-size systems. Rather large virtual dimensions are then\nrequired. The two most important aspects to reduce the corresponding\ncomputational cost are a proper choice and ordering of the active space\norbitals, and the exploitation of the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian. By\ntaking care of both aspects, DMRG becomes an efficient replacement for exact\ndiagonalization in quantum chemistry.\n  DMRG and Hartree-Fock theory have an analogous structure. The former can be\ninterpreted as a self-consistent mean-field theory in the DMRG lattice sites,\nand the latter in the particles. It is possible to build upon this analogy to\nintroduce post-DMRG methods. Based on an approximate MPS, these methods provide\nimproved ans\\\"atze for the ground state, as well as for excitations.\nExponentiation of the single-particle (single-site) excitations for a Slater\ndeterminant (an MPS with open boundary conditions) leads to the Thouless\ntheorem for Hartree-Fock theory (DMRG), an explicit nonredundant\nparameterization of the entire manifold of Slater determinants (MPS\nwavefunctions). This gives rise to the configuration interaction expansion for\nDMRG. The Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation lies at the basis of auxiliary\nfield quantum Monte Carlo for Slater determinants. An analogous transformation\nfor spin-lattice Hamiltonians allows to formulate a promising variant for MPSs.\n","Comment: PhD thesis (225 pages).

Users make arbitrary requests from a finite\nlibrary of files and have pre-cached information on their devices, subject to a\nper-node storage capacity constraint. A similar problem has already been\nconsidered in an ``infrastructure'' setting, where all users receive a common\nmulticast (coded) message from a single omniscient server (e.g., a base station\nhaving all the files in the library) through a shared bottleneck link. In this\nwork, we consider a D2D ``infrastructure-less'' version of the problem.

We\nalso consider a random caching strategy, which is more suitable to a fully\ndecentralized implementation.

This\nshows that the spatial reuse gain of the D2D network is order-equivalent to the\ncoded multicasting gain of single base station transmission. It is therefore\nnatural to ask whether these two gains are cumulative, i.e.,if a D2D network\nwith both local communication (spatial reuse) and coded multicasting can\nprovide an improved scaling law.
