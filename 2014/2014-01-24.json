Here, we introduce \"fiber walks\" as a self-avoiding random walk model\nfor tip-driven growth processes that includes lateral expansion. In 2D, the\nfiber walk takes place on a square lattice and the space occupied by the fiber\nis modelled as a lateral contraction of the lattice. This contraction\ninfluences the possible follow-up steps of the fiber walk. The boundary of the\narea consumed by the contraction is derived as the dual of the lattice faces\nadjacent to the fiber. We show that fiber walks generate fibers that have\nwell-defined curvatures, enable the identification of the process underlying\nthe occupancy of physical space. Hence, fiber walks provide a base from which\nto model both the extension and expansion of physical biological objects with\nfinite thickness.\n","Comment: Plos One (in press)"]}]

We then show that the\nequilibrium tide is stable against the quasi-static decay into daughter p- and\ng-modes to leading order. The leading deviation from the quasi-static\napproximation due to orbital motion of the binary is considered; while it may\nslightly spoil the near-cancellation, any resulting instability timescale is at\nleast of order the gravitational-wave inspiral time.

The actual solutions can be\nreconstructed quickly from the implicit compact representation used. We have\napplied the methods on a few test domains, some of them are synthetic while the\nothers are based on well known problems including the search space of the 5-peg\nTower of Hanoi problem, the matrix-chain multiplication problem and the problem\nof finding secondary structure of RNA. Experimental results show the efficacy\nof the proposed algorithms over the existing approach. Our proposed algorithms\nhave potential use in various domains ranging from knowledge based frameworks\nto service composition, where the AND/OR structure is widely used for\nrepresenting problems.\n"]}]

In optimal planning, we\nare interested in finding not just a plan, but one of the cheapest plans. A\nprominent approach to optimal planning these days is heuristic state-space\nsearch, guided by admissible heuristic functions. Numerous admissible\nheuristics have been developed, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, and\nit is well known that there is no single \"best heuristic for optimal planning\nin general.

Task clustering has been demonstrated to realize an\neffective strategy to improve the efficiency of satellite scheduling. However,\nthe previous task clustering strategy is static. That is, it is integrated into\nthe scheduling in a two-phase manner rather than in a dynamic fashion, without\nexpressing its full potential in improving the satellite scheduling\nperformance. In this study, we present an adaptive Simulated Annealing based\nscheduling algorithm aggregated with a dynamic task clustering strategy (or\nASA-DTC for short) for satellite observation scheduling problems (SOSPs).\nFirst, we develop a formal model for the scheduling of Earth observing\nsatellites. Second, we analyze the related constraints involved in the\nobservation task clustering process. Thirdly, we detail an implementation of\nthe dynamic task clustering strategy and the adaptive Simulated Annealing\nalgorithm. The adaptive Simulated Annealing algorithm is efficient, with the\nendowment of some sophisticated mechanisms, i.e. adaptive temperature control,\ntabu-list based revisiting avoidance mechanism, and intelligent combination of\nneighborhood structures. Finally, we report on experimental simulation studies\nto demonstrate the competitive performance of ASA-DTC.

Traditionally tasks acquire and release locks to\nsynchronize operations on shared memory. Unfortunately, lock management can add\nsignificant processing overhead especially for multicore deployments where\ntasks on different cores convoy in queues waiting to acquire a lock.\nImplementing more than one lock introduces the risk of deadlock and using\nspinlocks constrains which cores a task can run on. The better alternative is\nto eliminate locks and validate that real-time properties are met, which is not\ndirectly considered in many embedded applications. Removing the locks is\nnon-trivial and packaging lock-free algorithms for developers reduces the\npossibility of concurrency defects. This paper details how a multicore\ncommunication API implementation is enhanced to support lock-free messaging and\nthe impact this has on data exchange latency between tasks. Throughput and\nlatency are compared on Windows and Linux between lock-based and lock-free\nimplementations for data exchange of messages, packets, and scalars. A model of\nthe lock-free exchange predicts performance at the system architecture level\nand provides a stop criterion for the refactoring. The results show that\nmigration from single to multicore hardware architectures degrades lock-based\nperformance, and increases lock-free performance.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 8 figures, 36 references, Embedded World Conference 2013"]}]

With the\ngoal of maximizing the secondary user (SU) throughput subject to constraints on\nthe primary user (PU) outage probability we formulate a joint problem of\nspectrum sensing and channel state estimation. The problem is cast into a\nsequential framework since sensing time minimization is crucial for throughput\nmaximization. In the optimum solution, the sensing decision rule is coupled\nwith the channel estimator, making the separate treatment of the sensing and\nchannel estimation strictly suboptimal. Using such a joint structure for\nspectrum sensing and channel estimation we propose a distributed (cooperative)\ndynamic spectrum access scheme under statistical channel state information\n(CSI). In the proposed scheme, the SUs report their sufficient statistics to a\nfusion center (FC) via level-triggered sampling, a nonuniform sampling\ntechnique that is known to be bandwidth-and-energy efficient. Then, the FC\nmakes a sequential spectrum sensing decision using local statistics and channel\nestimates, and selects the SU with the best transmission opportunity. The\nselected SU, using the sensing decision and its channel estimates, computes the\ntransmit power and starts data transmission. Simulation results demonstrate\nthat the proposed scheme significantly outperforms its conventional\ncounterparts, under the same PU outage constraints, in terms of the achievable\nSU throughput.\n"]}]
