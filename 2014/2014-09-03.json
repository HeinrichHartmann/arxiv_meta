However, the use of information\ntheoretic quantities as test statistics, that is, as quantities obtained from\nempirical data, poses a challenging estimation problem that often leads to\nstrong simplifications such as Gaussian models, or the use of plug in density\nestimators that are restricted to certain representation of the data. In this\npaper, a framework to non-parametrically obtain measures of entropy directly\nfrom data using operators in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces defined by\ninfinitely divisible kernels is presented. The entropy functionals, which bear\nresemblance with quantum entropies, are defined on positive definite matrices\nand satisfy similar axioms to those of Renyi's definition of entropy.\nConvergence of the proposed estimators follows from concentration results on\nthe difference between the ordered spectrum of the Gram matrices and the\nintegral operators associated to the population quantities. In this way,\ncapitalizing on both the axiomatic definition of entropy and on the\nrepresentation power of positive definite kernels, the proposed measure of\nentropy avoids the estimation of the probability distribution underlying the\ndata. Moreover, estimators of kernel-based conditional entropy and mutual\ninformation are also defined. Numerical experiments on independence tests\ncompare favourably with state of the art.\n"]}]

The goal is to study methods for the\ndetermination of hierarchical clusters, i.e., a family of nested partitions\nindexed by a connectivity parameter, induced by the given dissimilarity\nstructures. Our construction of hierarchical clustering methods is based on\ndefining admissible methods to be those methods that abide by the axioms of\nvalue - nodes in a network with two nodes are clustered together at the maximum\nof the two dissimilarities between them - and transformation - when\ndissimilarities are reduced, the network may become more clustered but not\nless. Several admissible methods are constructed and two particular methods,\ntermed reciprocal and nonreciprocal clustering, are shown to provide upper and\nlower bounds in the space of admissible methods. Alternative clustering\nmethodologies and axioms are further considered. Allowing the outcome of\nhierarchical clustering to be asymmetric, so that it matches the asymmetry of\nthe original data, leads to the inception of quasi-clustering methods. The\nexistence of a unique quasi-clustering method is shown. Allowing clustering in\na two-node network to proceed at the minimum of the two dissimilarities\ngenerates an alternative axiomatic construction. There is a unique clustering\nmethod in this case too.

In cuprates, this technique has been used to remove charge stripes and\npromote superconductivity, acting in a way opposite to static magnetic fields.\nHere, we show that excitation of large-amplitude apical oxygen distortions in\nthe cuprate superconductor YBa2Cu3O6.5 promotes highly unconventional\nelectronic properties. Below the superconducting transition temperature (Tc =\n50 K), interbilayer coherence is transiently enhanced at the expense of\nintra-bilayer coupling. Strikingly, even above Tc a qualitatively similar\neffect is observed up to room temperature, with transient inter-bilayer\ncoherence emerging from the incoherent ground state and similar transfer of\nspectral weight from high to low frequency. These observations are compatible\nwith previous reports of an inhomogeneous normal state that retains important\nproperties of a superconductor, in which light may be melting competing orders\nor dynamically synchronizing the interlayer phase. The transient redistribution\nof coherence discussed here could lead to new strategies to enhance\nsuperconductivity in steady state.\n","Comment: 36 pages, 15 figures"]}]

Here, we propose a Bayesian model averaging method to properly\nquantify the relationship between radiation dose and disease outcomes by\naccounting for shared and unshared uncertainty in estimated dose. Our Bayesian\nrisk analysis method utilizes multiple realizations of sets (vectors) of doses\ngenerated by a two-dimensional Monte Carlo simulation method that properly\nseparates shared and unshared errors in dose estimation. The exposure model\nused in this work is taken from a study of the risk of thyroid nodules among a\ncohort of 2,376 subjects following exposure to fallout resulting from nuclear\ntesting in Kazakhstan. We assessed the performance of our method through an\nextensive series of simulation tests and comparisons against conventional\nregression risk analysis methods. We conclude that when estimated doses contain\nrelatively small amounts of uncertainty, the Bayesian method using multiple\nrealizations of possibly true dose vectors gave similar results to the\nconventional regression-based methods of dose-response analysis. However, when\nlarge and complex mixtures of shared and unshared uncertainties are present,\nthe Bayesian method using multiple dose vectors had significantly lower\nrelative bias than conventional regression-based risk analysis methods as well\nas a markedly increased capability to include the pre-established 'true' risk\ncoefficient within the credible interval of the Bayesian-based risk estimate.\nAn evaluation of the dose-response using our method is presented for an\nepidemiological study of thyroid disease following radiation exposure.\n"]}]
