The coding\nstrategy involves block-Markov superposition coding, using Marton's coding\nscheme for the broadcast channel without feedback as the starting point. If the\nmessage rates in the Marton scheme are too high to be decoded at the end of a\nblock, each receiver is left with a list of messages compatible with its\noutput. Resolution information is sent in the following block to enable each\nreceiver to resolve its list. The key observation is that the resolution\ninformation of the first receiver is correlated with that of the second. This\ncorrelated information is efficiently transmitted via joint source-channel\ncoding, using ideas similar to the Han-Costa coding scheme. Using the result,\nwe obtain an achievable rate region for the stochastically degraded AWGN\nbroadcast channel with noisy feedback from only one receiver. It is shown that\nthis region is strictly larger than the no-feedback capacity region.\n","Comment: To appear in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory.

It is common sense that vehicular traffic arranges\nin a user-equilibrium based on generalized costs in which travel time is a\nmajor factor. Surprisingly travel time has not received much attention for the\nroute choice of pedestrians. In microscopic simulations of pedestrians the\nvastly dominating paradigm for the computation of the preferred walking\ndirection is set into the direction of the (spatially) shortest path. For\nsituations where pedestrians have travel time as primary determinant for their\nwalking behavior it would be desirable to also have an assignment method in\npedestrian simulations. To apply existing (road traffic) assignment methods\nwith simulations of pedestrians one has to reduce the nondenumerably many\npossible pedestrian trajectories to a small subset of routes which represent\nthe main, relevant, and significantly distinguished routing alternatives. All\nexcept one of these routes will mark detours, i.e. not the shortest connection\nbetween origin and destination. The proposed assignment method is intended to\nwork with common operational models of pedestrian dynamics. These - as\nmentioned before - usually send pedestrians into the direction of the spatially\nshortest path. Thus, all detouring routes have to be equipped with intermediate\ndestinations, such that pedestrians can do a detour as a piecewise connection\nof segments on which they walk into the direction of the shortest path. One has\nthen to take care that the transgression from one segment to the following one\nno artifacts are introduced into the pedestrian trajectory.\n","Comment: contribution to PANAM 2014 conference"]}]

However, obtaining\nconsumption information for single individuals is often either not possible or\ntoo expensive. Therefore, we consider data from aggregations of energy use,\nthat is, from sums of individuals' energy use, where each individual falls into\none of C consumer classes. Unfortunately, the exact number of individuals of\neach class may be unknown: consumers do not always report the appropriate\nclass, due to various factors including differential energy rates for different\nconsumer classes. We develop a methodology to estimate the expected energy use\nof each class as a function of time and the true number of consumers in each\nclass. We also provide some measure of uncertainty of the resulting estimates.\nTo accomplish this, we assume that the expected consumption is a function of\ntime that can be well approximated by a linear combination of B-splines.\nIndividual consumer perturbations from this baseline are modeled as B-splines\nwith random coefficients. We treat the reported numbers of consumers in each\ncategory as random variables with distribution depending on the true number of\nconsumers in each class and on the probabilities of a consumer in one class\nreporting as another class. We obtain maximum likelihood estimates of all\nparameters via a maximization algorithm. We introduce a special numerical trick\nfor calculating the maximum likelihood estimates of the true number of\nconsumers in each class.
