This scenario\nthough looks very appealing is still far from being well established. One of\nthe main differences between standard spin systems to molecular systems is the\nabsence of quenched disorder and the presence of translational invariance: it\noften assumed that this difference is not relevant, but this conjecture is\nstill far from being established. The quantities, which are well defined and\ncharacterized for spin models, are not easily calculable for molecular glasses\ndue to the lack of quenched disorder which breaks the translational invariance\nin the system and the characterization of the similarity between the spin and\nthe structural glass transition remained an elusive subject still now. In this\nstudy we introduced a model structural glass with built in quenched disorder\nwhich alleviates this main difference between the spin and molecular glasses\nthereby helping us to compare these two systems: the possibility of producing a\ngood thermalization at rather low temperatures is one of the advantages of this\nmodel.\n","Comment: Submitted to PNAS with 7 pages 5 figures and Supplementary Materials"]}]

In this paper we conjecture a\nconstruction of non-supersymmetric supergravity solutions describing D-brane\nconfigurations which carry mass and angular momentum, but no other conserved\ncharges. We first study a classical string solution which locally carries\ndipole winding and momentum charges in two compact directions, but globally\ncarries no net winding or momentum charge. We investigate its backreaction in\nthe D1-D5 duality frame, where this object becomes a supertube which locally\ncarries oscillating dipole D1-D5 and NS1-NS5 charges, and again carries no net\ncharge. In the limit of an infinite straight supertube, we find an exact\nsupergravity solution describing this object. We conjecture that a similar\nconstruction may be carried out based on a class of two-charge\nnon-supersymmetric D1-D5 solutions. These results are a step towards\ndemonstrating how neutral black hole microstates may be constructed in string\ntheory.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 2 figures, v3: estimate of radiation rate added, references\n  added"]}]

Here we describe an experimental\nmethod to determine the contributions from these background processes and apply\nthis method in the case of Copper M3VV Auger spectrum obtained in coincidence\nwith the 3p3/2 photoemission peak. A beam of 200 eV photons was incident on a\nCu(100) sample and a series of coincidence measurements were performed using a\nspectrometer equipped with two cylindrical mirror analyzers (CMAs). One CMA was\nset at series of fixed energies that ranged between the energy of the core and\nthe VB peaks. The other CMA was scanned over a range corresponding to electrons\nleaving the surface between 0eV and 70eV. The set of measured spectra were then\nfit to a parameterized function which was extrapolated to determine the\nbackground in the APECS spectra due to multi-electron and inelastic VB\nphotoemission processes. The extrapolated background was subtracted from the\nAPECS spectrum to obtain the spectrum of electrons emitted solely as the result\nof the Auger process. A comparison of the coincidence spectrum with the same\nspectrum with background removed shows that in the case of Cu M3VV the\nbackground due to the inelastic scattering of VB electrons is negligible in the\nregion of the Auger peak but is more than half the total signal down in the low\nenergy tail of the Auger peak.\n","Comment: 9 Pages, 3 figures and 1 table (Accepted for publication at Journal\n  of Electron Spectroscopy and Related Phenomena, JESRP)"]}]

There are two scenarios for the production of\nthe annihilating dark matters.

However, the light curve in\nthe hard energy band (2.0-10.0 keV) shows only one minimum during the apastron\npassage. The X-ray spectra of WR 25 were explained by a two-temperature plasma\nmodel. Both the cool and the hot plasmas were constant at 0.628+/-0.008 and\n2.75+/-0.06 keV throughout an orbital cycle, where the cooler plasma could be\ndue to the small scale shocks in a radiation-driven outflow and the high\ntemperature plasma could be due to the collision of winds. The column density\nvaried with the orbital phase and was found to be maximum after the periastron\npassage, when the WN star is in front of the O star. The abundances of WR 25\nwere found to be non-solar. Optical V-band data of WR 25 also show the\nphase-locked variability, being at maximum near periastron passage.

We formulate this problem as a\ndiscounted Markov decision process (MDP) framework, whereby the energy\nharvesting process is stochastically quantized into several representative\nsolar states with distinct energy arrivals and is totally driven by historical\ndata records at a sensor node. With the observed solar irradiance at each time\nepoch, a mixed strategy is developed to compute the belief information of the\nunderlying solar states for the choice of transmission parameters. In addition,\na theoretical analysis is conducted for a simple on-off policy, in which a\npredetermined transmission parameter is utilized whenever a sensor node is\nactive. We prove that such an optimal policy has a threshold structure with\nrespect to battery states and evaluate the performance of an energy harvesting\nnode by analyzing the expected net bit rate.

In this paper, we formalize a class of\nquantitative analysis problems defined over a weighted control flow graph of a\nloop-free program. These problems can be solved using a combination of path\nenumeration, SMT solving, and model counting. However, existing methods can\nonly handle very small programs, primarily because the number of execution\npaths can be exponential in the program size. We show how path explosion can be\nmitigated in some practical cases by taking advantage of special branching\nstructure and by novel algorithm design. We demonstrate our techniques by\ncomputing the channel capacities of the timing side-channels of two programs\nwith extremely large numbers of paths.\n","Comment: Full version of an SMT 2014 paper"]}]

In such systems, the real-time\nscheduling problem becomes more challenging in that processors have different\nspeeds. A job executing on a processor with speed $x$ for $t$ time units\ncompletes $(x \\cdot t)$ units of execution. Prior research on heterogeneous\nmultiprocessor real-time scheduling has focused on hard real-time systems,\nwhere, significant processing capacity may have to be sacrificed in the\nworst-case to ensure that all deadlines are met. As meeting hard deadlines is\noverkill for many soft real-time systems in practice, this paper shows that on\nsoft real-time heterogeneous multiprocessors, bounded response times can be\nensured for globally-scheduled sporadic task systems with no utilization loss.\nA GEDF-based scheduling algorithm, namely GEDF-H, is presented and response\ntime bounds are established under both preemptive and non-preemptive GEDF-H\nscheduling. Extensive experiments show that the magnitude of the derived\nresponse time bound is reasonable, often smaller than three task periods. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to show that soft real-time\nsporadic task systems can be supported on heterogeneous multiprocessors without\nutilization loss, and with reasonable predicted response time.\n"]}]

Negative feedback loops tend to\npromote oscillations around steady states, and their stability depends on the\nparticular shape of the delay distribution. Since in applications the mean\ndelay is often the only reliable information available about the distribution,\nit is desirable to find conditions for stability that are independent from the\nshape of the distribution. We show here that for a given mean delay, the linear\nequation with distributed delay is asymptotically stable if the associated\ndifferential equation with a discrete delay is asymptotically stable.

Each problem in the hierarchy\nhas a primal SDP formulation (a relaxation of a moment problem) and a dual SDP\nformulation (a sum-of-squares representation of a polynomial Lagrangian of the\nPOP).
