A similar study\nhas been reported for the self part, and we study the self and distinct parts\nseparately because their damping processes are not simply related. We begin\nwith the perfect vibrational system, which provides precise definitions of the\nliquid correlations, and provides the vibrational approximation Fdvib(q,t) at\nall q and t. Two independent liquid correlations are defined, motional and\nstructural, and these are decorrelated sequentially, with a crossover time\ntc(q). This is done by two independent decorrelation processes: the first,\nvibrational dephasing, is naturally present in Fdvib(q,t) and operates to damp\nthe motional correlation; the second, transit-induced decorrelation, is invoked\nto enhance the damping of motional correlation, and then to damp the structural\ncorrelation. A microscopic model is made for the \"transit drift\", the averaged\ntransit motion that damps motional correlation on 0 < t < tc(q). Following the\npreviously developed self-decorrelation theory, a microscopic model is also\nmade for the \"transit random walk,\" which damps the structural correlation on t\n> tc(q). The complete model incorporates a property common to both self and\ndistinct decorrelation: simple exponential decay following a delay period,\nwhere the delay is tc(q, the time required for the random walk to emerge from\nthe drift. Our final result is an accurate expression for Fd(q,t) for all q\nthrough the first peak in Sd(q).

The responses of the $v_n$, the\nevent-plane correlations, and the rapidity fluctuations, to the change in\n$\\epsilon_n$ and $q_n$ are then systematized. Strong positive correlations are\nobserved among all even harmonics $v_2, v_4$, and $v_6$ (all increase with\n$q_2$), between $v_2$ and $v_5$ (both increase with $q_2$) and between $v_3$\nand $v_5$ (both increase with $q_3$), consistent with the effects of nonlinear\ncollective response.

We find that using an accurate model for the\npolarizations of the acoustic phonon modes is crucial to obtain correct\nnumerical results. The interactions between electrons and acoustic phonon\nmodes, the gauge field and deformation potential, are calculated at the DFT\nlevel in the framework of linear response. The zero-momentum limit of acoustic\nphonons is interpreted as a strain pattern, allowing the calculation of the\nacoustic gauge field parameter in the GW approximation. The role of electronic\nscreening on the electron-phonon matrix elements is investigated. We then solve\nthe Boltzmann equation semi-analytically in graphene, including both acoustic\nand optical phonon scattering. We show that, in the Bloch-Gr\\\"uneisen and\nequipartition regimes, the electronic transport is mainly ruled by the\nunscreened acoustic gauge field, while the contribution due to the deformation\npotential is negligible and strongly screened. By comparing with experimental\ndata, we show that the contribution of acoustic phonons to resistivity is\ndoping- and substrate-independent. The DFT+GW approach underestimates this\ncontribution to resistivity by about 30 %. Above 270K, the calculated\nresistivity underestimates the experimental one more severely, the\nunderestimation being larger at lower doping. We show that, beside remote\nphonon scattering, a possible explanation for this disagreement is the\nelectron-electron interaction that strongly renormalizes the coupling to\nintrinsic optical-phonon modes. Finally, after discussing the validity of the\nMatthiessen rule in graphene, we derive simplified analytical solutions of the\nBoltzmann equation to extract the coupling to acoustic phonons, related to the\nstrain-induced gauge field, directly from experimental data.\n"]}]

We show that in our setting every recursive formula equation has a\nunique solution. As for derivations, we use an infinitary variant of\nTait-calculus to derive sequents. The interactive semantics for derivations\nthat we introduce in this article is presented as a debate (interaction tree)\nbetween a test << T >> (derivation candidate, Proponent) and an environment <<\nnot S >> (negation of a sequent, Opponent). We show a completeness theorem for\nderivations that we call interactive completeness theorem: the interaction\nbetween << T >> (test) and << not S >> (environment) does not produce errors\n(i.e., Proponent wins) just in case << T >> comes from a syntactical derivation\nof << S >>.\n","Comment: In Proceedings CL&C 2014, arXiv:1409.2593"]}]
