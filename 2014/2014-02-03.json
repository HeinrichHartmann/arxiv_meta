We propose a method, referred\nto as subspace marginalization with interference suppression (SUMIS), that\nyields unprecedented performance at low and fixed (deterministic) complexity.\nOur method provides a well-defined tradeoff between computational complexity\nand performance. Apart from an initial sorting step consisting of selecting\nchannel-matrix columns, the algorithm involves no searching nor algorithmic\nbranching; hence the algorithm has a completely predictable run-time and allows\nfor a highly parallel implementation. We numerically assess the performance of\nSUMIS in different practical settings: full/partial channel state information,\nsequential/iterative decoding, and low/high rate outer codes.

This paper focuses on the\npossibility to manage heterogeneity in the walking speed of the simulated\npopulation of pedestrians by modifying an existing multi-agent model extending\nthe floor field approach. Whereas some discrete models allow pedestrians (or\ncars, when applied to traffic modelling) to move more than a single cell per\ntime step, the present work proposes a maximum speed of one cell per step, but\nwe model lower speeds by having pedestrians yielding their movement in some\nturns. Different classes of pedestrians are associated to different desired\nwalking speeds and we define a stochastic mechanism ensuring that they maintain\nan average speed close to this threshold.

In subsequent papers, Elie Cartan extended these concepts\nfor other types of connections on a manifold: Euclidean, Galilean and\nMinkowskian connections which can be considered as special types of affine\nconnections, the group of affine transformations of the affine tangent space\nbeing replaced by a suitable subgroup; and more generally, conformal and\nprojective connections, associated to a group which is no more a subgroup of\nthe affine group. Around 1950, Charles Ehresmann introduced connections on a\nfibre bundle and, when the bundle has a Lie group as structure group,\nconnection forms on the associated principal bundle, with values in the Lie\nalgebra of the structure group. He called Cartan connections the various types\nof connections on a manifold previously introduced by E. Cartan, and explained\nhow they can be considered as special cases of connections on a fibre bundle\nwith a Lie group G as structure group: the standard fibre of the bundle is then\nan homogeneous space G/G' ; its dimension is equal to that of the base\nmanifold; a Cartan connection determines an isomorphism of the vector bundle\ntangent to the the base manifold onto the vector bundle of vertical vectors\ntangent to the fibres of the bundle along a global section.

This an important statistical inverse\nproblem arising in the analysis of data at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.\nMathematically, the problem is formalized as one of estimating the intensity\nfunction of an indirectly observed Poisson point process. Particle physicists\nare particularly keen on unfolding methods that feature a principled way of\nchoosing the regularization strength and allow for the quantification of the\nuncertainty inherent in the solution. Though there are many approaches that\nhave been considered by experimental physicists, it can be argued that few --\nif any -- of these deal with these two key issues in a satisfactory manner. In\nthis paper, we propose to attack the unfolding problem within the framework of\nempirical Bayes estimation: we consider Bayes estimators of the coefficients of\na basis expansion of the unknown intensity, using a regularizing prior; and\nemploy a Monte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithm to find the marginal\nmaximum likelihood estimate of the hyperparameter controlling the strength of\nthe regularization. Due to the data-driven choice of the hyperparameter,\ncredible intervals derived using the empirical Bayes posterior lose their\nsubjective Bayesian interpretation. Since the properties and meaning of such\nintervals are poorly understood, we explore instead the use of bootstrap\nresampling for constructing purely frequentist confidence bands for the true\nintensity.
