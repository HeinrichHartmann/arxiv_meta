To describe TE dynamics in populations, many previous studies have\nused models of transposition-selection equilibrium that rely on the assumption\nof a constant rate of transposition. However, since TE invasions are known to\nhappen in bursts through time, this assumption may not be reasonable in natural\npopulations. Here we propose a test of neutrality for TE insertions that does\nnot rely on the assumption of a constant transposition rate. We consider the\ncase of TE insertions that have been ascertained from a single haploid\nreference genome sequence and have subsequently had their allele frequency\nestimated in a population sample. By conditioning on the age of an individual\nTE insertion (using information contained in the number of substitutions that\nhave occurred within the TE sequence since insertion), we determine the\nprobability distribution for the insertion allele frequency in a population\nsample under neutrality. Taking models of varying population size into account,\nwe then evaluate predictions of our model against allele frequency data from\n190 retrotransposon insertions sampled from North American and African\npopulations of Drosophila melanogaster. Using this non-equilibrium model, we\nare able to explain about 80% of the variance in TE insertion allele\nfrequencies based on age alone. Controlling both for nonequilibrium dynamics of\ntransposition and host demography, we provide evidence for negative selection\nacting against most TEs as well as for positive selection acting on a small\nsubset of TEs.

We conclude that the\ninequalities using these definitions do not capture the spirit of Heisenberg's\neponymous inequality, but do indicate a qualitatively different relationship\nbetween dispersion and disturbance that is appropriate for ensembles being\nprobed by all outcomes of an apparatus. To reconnect with the discussion of\nHeisenberg, we suggest alternative definitions of error and disturbance that\nare intrinsic to a single apparatus outcome. These definitions naturally\ninvolve the retrodictive and interdictive states for that outcome, and produce\ncomplementarity and error-disturbance inequalities that have the same form as\nthe traditional Heisenberg relation.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 8 figures, published version"]}]

Contributions from evolved stellar populations to both the UV\nand the MIR SEDs most likely explain the discrepancy.

From the spectral energy distributions we found that 6 of\nthe 63 post-AGB/RGB candidates have a circumstellar shell suggesting that they\nare single stars, while 27 of them have a surrounding disc, suggesting that\nthey are binaries. For the remaining candidates the nature of the circumstellar\nenvironment was unclear. Variability is displayed by 38 post-AGB/RGB candidates\nwith common variability types being the Population II Cepheids (including\nRV-Tauri stars) and semi-regular variables. This study has also revealed a new\ns-process enriched RV Tauri star (J005107.19-734133.3). From the numbers of\npost-AGB/RGB stars in the SMC, we were able to estimate evolutionary rates that\nare in good agreement with the stellar evolution models with mass loss in the\npost-AGB phase and re-accretion in the post-RGB phase. This study also resulted\nin a new sample of 40 luminous young stellar objects (YSOs) of A - F spectral\ntype. Additionally, we also identified a group of 63 objects whose spectra are\ndominated by emission lines and in some cases, a UV continuum. These objects\nare likely to be either hot post-AGB/RGBs or luminous YSOs.\n","Comment: 67 pages, 26 figures, 20 tables, 3 appendices + online supporting\n  information on CDS"]}]

A Reevaluation of the Debate 'Determinism -\n  Indeterminism' in the Light of Quantum Mechanics and Probability Theory"],"description":["  In this PhD thesis the ancient question of determinism ('Does every event\nhave a cause ?') will be re-examined. In the philosophy of science and physics\ncommunities the orthodox position states that the physical world is\nindeterministic: quantum events would have no causes but happen by irreducible\nchance. Arguably the clearest theorem that leads to this conclusion is Bell's\ntheorem. The commonly accepted 'solution' to the theorem is 'indeterminism', in\nagreement with the Copenhagen interpretation. Here it is recalled that\nindeterminism is not really a physical but rather a philosophical hypothesis,\nand that it has counterintuitive and far-reaching implications. At the same\ntime another solution to Bell's theorem exists, often termed 'superdeterminism'\nor 'total determinism'. Superdeterminism appears to be a philosophical position\nthat is centuries and probably millennia old: it is for instance Spinoza's\ndeterminism. If Bell's theorem has both indeterministic and deterministic\nsolutions, choosing between determinism and indeterminism is a philosophical\nquestion, not a matter of physical experimentation, as is widely believed. If\nit is impossible to use physics for deciding between both positions, it is\nlegitimate to ask which philosophical theories are of help. Here it is argued\nthat probability theory - more precisely the interpretation of probability - is\ninstrumental for advancing the debate. It appears that the hypothesis of\ndeterminism allows to answer a series of precise questions from probability\ntheory, while indeterminism remains silent for these questions. From this point\nof view determinism appears to be the most reasonable assumption, after all.\n","Comment: 139 pages, PhD thesis"]}]

A\nfundamental choice is how one measures \"distances\" between shapes in an image.\nIt has been shown that the straightforward geometric L2 distance is degenerate\nand leads to pathological situations. This is avoided when using Sobolev\ngradients, rendering the segmentation problem less ill-posed. The high\ncomputational cost and implementation overhead of Sobolev gradients, however,\nhave hampered practical applications.

The present particle approximation of Sobolev gradients is 2.8\nto 10 times faster than the previous reference implementation, but retains the\nknown favorable properties of Sobolev gradients. This speedup is achieved by\nusing local particle-particle interactions instead of solving a global Poisson\nequation at each iteration. The computational time per iteration is higher for\nSobolev gradients than for L2 gradients.

Another recently\nproposed solution, an analytically determined non-linear focusing guide shape,\nis applied here for the first time in a kinked and curved ballistic context.\nThe latter is shown to yield comparable results for long wavelength neutrons as\nthe guide design found here, with a larger inhomogeneity in the divergence but\nhigher transmission of thermal neutrons.

A quantitative\nappraisal on the potential role of future measurements at an Electron-Ion\nCollider is also presented. We study the stability of our results upon the\nvariation of several theoretical and methodological assumptions and we present\na detailed investigation of the first moments of our polarized PDFs, compared\nto other recent analyses. We find that the uncertainty on the gluon\ndistribution from available data was substantially underestimated in previous\ndeterminations; in particular, we emphasize that a large contribution to the\ngluon may arise from the unmeasured small-x region, against the common belief\nthat this is actually rather small. We demonstrate that an Electron-Ion\nCollider would provide evidence for a possible large gluon contribution to the\nnucleon spin, though with a sizable residual uncertainty.\n","Comment: PhD thesis (2014) http://phd.fisica.unimi.it"]}]
