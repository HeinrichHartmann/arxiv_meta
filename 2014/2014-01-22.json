The choice of the PDF is a compromise\nbetween computational costs and accuracy level. The aim of this paper is to\ninvestigate the influence of the PDF choice and its modeling aspects in the\nsimulation of non premixed turbulent combustion. Three different models are\nconsidered: the standard one, based on the choice of a beta distribution for Z\nand a Dirac distribution for C; a model employing a beta distribution for both\nZ and C; a third model obtained using a beta distribution for Z and the\nstatistical most likely distribution (SMLD) for C. The standard model, although\nwidely used, doesn't take into account the interaction between turbulence and\nchemical kinetics as well as the dependence of the progress variable not only\non its mean but also on its variance.

These conflicts and their possible solutions have been observed by\nimplementing standard-compliant relay functionalities on the Vienna simulator.\n  As an original experimental approach, we model realistic RN operation, taking\ninto account that transmitters are not active all the time due to half-duplex\nRN operation. We have rearranged existing elements in the simulator in a manner\nthat emulates RN behavior, rather than implementing a standalone brand-new\ncomponent for the simulator. We also study analytically some of the issues\nobserved in the interaction between the network and the RNs, to draw\nconclusions beyond simulation observation.\n  The main observations of this paper are that: $i$) Additional time-varying\ninterference management steps are needed, because the LTE-A standard employs a\nfixed time division between eNB-RN and RN-UE transmissions (typical relay\ncapacity or throughput research models balance them optimally, which is\nunrealistic nowadays); $ii$) There is a trade-off between the time-division\nconstraints of relaying and multi-user diversity; the stricter the constraints\non relay scheduling are, the less flexibility schedulers have to exploit\nchannel variation; and $iii$) Thee standard contains a variety of parameters\nfor relaying configuration, but not all cases of interest are covered.\n","Comment: 17 one-column pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in IEEE ICC\n  2014 MWN"]}]

We\nfind that when a plane wave of a Dirac fermion is reflected at an edge of\ngraphene, its reflection phase is shifted by the geometric phase resulting from\nthe change of the pseudospin of the Dirac fermion in the reflection. The\ngeometric phase is the Pancharatnam-Berry phase that equals the half of the\nsolid angle on Bloch sphere determined by the propagation direction of the\nincident wave and also by the orientation angle of the graphene edge. The\ngeometric phase is finite at zigzag edge in general, while it always vanishes\nat armchair edge because of intervalley mixing. To demonstrate its physical\neffects, we first connect the geometric phase with the energy band structure of\ngraphene nanoribbon with zigzag edge. The magnitude of the band gap of the\nnanoribbon, that opens in the presence of the staggered sublattice potential\ninduced by edge magnetization, is related to the geometric phase. Second, we\nnumerically study the effect of the geometric phase on the Veselago lens formed\nin a graphene nanoribbon. The interference pattern of the lens is distinguished\nbetween armchair and zigzag nanoribbons, which is useful for detecting the\ngeometric phase.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures"]}]

Utterance\nverification in this work implies the ability to determine when portions of a\nhypothesized word string correspond to incorrectly decoded vocabulary words or\nout-of-vocabulary words that may appear in an utterance. This capability is\nimplemented here as a likelihood ratio (LR). There are two UV techniques that\nare presented here. The first is voice verification along with the vocabulary\ntesting, at the same time the parameters for UV models are generated based on\nthe optimization criterion which is directly related to the LR measure. The\nsecond technique is a pitch recognition based on weighted finite-state\ntransducers. These transducers provide a common and natural representation for\nmajor components of speech recognition systems, including hidden Markov models\n(HMMs), context-dependency models, pronunciation dictionaries, statistical\ngrammars, and word or phone lattices. The finite state machine processes the\nacoustic parameters of UV models. The results of an experimental study\npresented in the paper shows that LR based parameter estimation results in a\nsignificant improvement in UV performance for this task. The study also found\nthat the use of the LR based weighted finite-state transducers along with the\nUV, can provide as much as an 11% improvement in UV performance when compared\nto existing UV procedures. Finally, it was also found that the performance of\nthe finite state machine was highly dependent on the use of the LR criterion in\ntraining acoustic models. Several observations are made in the paper concerning\nthe formation of confidence measures for UV and the interaction of these\ntechniques with statistical language models.\n"]}]

By modeling implicit\nspecies exchanges via a graph abstraction that we refer to as the Species Flow\nNetwork (SFN), a different approach that exploits the power of network science\nmethods in extracting knowledge from largely incomplete data is presented.\nHere, coarse-grained species flow dynamics are studied via a graph clustering\napproach that decomposes the SFN to clusters of ports and inter-cluster\nconnections.
