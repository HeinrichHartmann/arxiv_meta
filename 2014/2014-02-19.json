More precisely, we prove that a mixture with known\nidentical covariance matrices whose number of components is a polynomial of any\nfixed degree in the dimension n is polynomially learnable as long as a certain\nnon-degeneracy condition on the means is satisfied. It turns out that this\ncondition is generic in the sense of smoothed complexity, as soon as the\ndimensionality of the space is high enough. Moreover, we prove that no such\ncondition can possibly exist in low dimension and the problem of learning the\nparameters is generically hard. In contrast, much of the existing work on\nGaussian Mixtures relies on low-dimensional projections and thus hits an\nartificial barrier. Our main result on mixture recovery relies on a new\n\"Poissonization\"-based technique, which transforms a mixture of Gaussians to a\nlinear map of a product distribution. The problem of learning this map can be\nefficiently solved using some recent results on tensor decompositions and\nIndependent Component Analysis (ICA), thus giving an algorithm for recovering\nthe mixture. In addition, we combine our low-dimensional hardness results for\nGaussian mixtures with Poissonization to show how to embed difficult instances\nof low-dimensional Gaussian mixtures into the ICA setting, thus establishing\nexponential information-theoretic lower bounds for underdetermined ICA in low\ndimension.
