The renewal process is\nknown as bone remodelling and is operated by bone-resorbing cells (osteoclasts)\nand bone-forming cells (osteoblasts). Both biochemical and biomechanical\nregulatory mechanisms have been identified in the interaction between\nosteoclasts and osteoblasts. Here we focus on an additional and poorly\nunderstood potential regulatory mechanism of bone cells, that involves the\nmorphology of the microstructure of bone. Bone cells can only remove and\nreplace bone at a bone surface. However, the microscopic availability of bone\nsurface depends in turn on the ever-changing bone microstructure. The\nimportance of this geometrical dependence is unknown and difficult to quantify\nexperimentally. Therefore, we develop a sophisticated mathematical model of\nbone cell interactions that takes into account biochemical, biomechanical and\ngeometrical regulations. We then investigate numerically the influence of bone\nsurface availability in bone remodelling within a representative bone tissue\nsample. The interdependence between the bone cells' activity, which modifies\nthe bone microstructure, and changes in the microscopic bone surface\navailability, which in turn influences bone cell development and activity, is\nimplemented using a remarkable experimental relationship between bone specific\nsurface and bone porosity. Our model suggests that geometrical regulation of\nthe activation of new remodelling events could have a significant effect on\nbone porosity and bone stiffness.

Yet, this\ndysregulation of bone remodelling does not occur equally in all bone regions.\nLoss of bone is more pronounced near and at the endocortex, leading to cortical\nwall thinning and medullary cavity expansion, a process sometimes referred to\nas \"trabecularisation\" or \"cancellisation\". Cortical wall thinning is of\nprimary concern in osteoporosis due to the strong deterioration of bone\nmechanical properties that it is associated with. In this paper, we examine the\npossibility that the non-uniformity of microscopic bone surface availability\ncould explain the non-uniformity of bone loss in osteoporosis. We use a\ncomputational model of bone remodelling in which microscopic bone surface\navailability influences bone turnover rate and simulate the evolution of the\nbone volume fraction profile across the midshaft of a long bone. We find that\nbone loss is accelerated near the endocortical wall where the specific surface\nis highest. Over time, this leads to a substantial reduction of cortical wall\nthickness from the endosteum. The associated expansion of the medullary cavity\ncan be made to match experimentally observed cross-sectional data from the\nMelbourne Femur Collection. Finally, we calculate the redistribution of the\nmechanical stresses in this evolving bone structure and show that mechanical\nload becomes critically transferred to the periosteal cortical bone.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 3 figures.

Although genome-wide\nassociation studies have discovered thousands of well-replicated polymorphisms\nassociated with a broad spectrum of complex traits, the combined predictive\npower of these associations for any given trait is generally too low to be of\nclinical relevance. We propose a novel systems approach to complex trait\nprediction, which leverages and integrates similarity in genetic,\ntranscriptomic or other omics-level data. We translate the omic similarity into\nphenotypic similarity using a method called Kriging, commonly used in\ngeostatistics and machine learning. Our method called OmicKriging emphasizes\nthe use of a wide variety of systems-level data, such as those increasingly\nmade available by comprehensive surveys of the genome, transcriptome and\nepigenome, for complex trait prediction. Furthermore, our OmicKriging framework\nallows easy integration of prior information on the function of subsets of\nomics-level data from heterogeneous sources without the sometimes heavy\ncomputational burden of Bayesian approaches. Using seven disease datasets from\nthe Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC), we show that OmicKriging\nallows simple integration of sparse and highly polygenic components yielding\ncomparable performance at a fraction of the computing time of a recently\npublished Bayesian sparse linear mixed model method. Using a cellular growth\nphenotype, we show that integrating mRNA and microRNA expression data\nsubstantially increases performance over either dataset alone.

A study of anomalous microwave emission\n  in Galactic clouds"],"description":["  Anomalous microwave emission (AME) is believed to be due to electric dipole\nradiation from small spinning dust grains. The aim of this paper is a\nstatistical study of the basic properties of AME regions and the environment in\nwhich they emit. We used WMAP and Planck maps, combined with ancillary radio\nand IR data, to construct a sample of 98 candidate AME sources, assembling SEDs\nfor each source using aperture photometry on 1deg-smoothed maps from 0.408 GHz\nup to 3000 GHz. Each spectrum is fitted with a simple model of free-free,\nsynchrotron (where necessary), cosmic microwave background (CMB), thermal dust,\nand spinning dust components. We find that 42 of the 98 sources have\nsignificant (>5sigma) excess emission at frequencies between 20 and 60 GHz. An\nanalysis of the potential contribution of optically thick free-free emission\nfrom ultra-compact HII regions, using IR colour criteria, reduces the\nsignificant AME sample to 27 regions. The spectrum of the AME is consistent\nwith model spectra of spinning dust. The AME regions tend to be more spatially\nextended than regions with little or no AME. The AME intensity is strongly\ncorrelated with the submillimetre/IR flux densities and comparable to previous\nAME detections in the literature. AME emissivity, defined as the ratio of AME\nto dust optical depth, varies by an order of magnitude for the AME regions. The\nAME regions tend to be associated with cooler dust in the range 14-20 K and an\naverage emissivity index of +1.8, while the non-AME regions are typically\nwarmer, at 20-27 K. In agreement with previous studies, the AME emissivity\nappears to decrease with increasing column density. The emerging picture is\nthat the bulk of the AME is coming from the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons\nand small dust grains from the colder neutral interstellar medium phase\n(Abridged).\n","Comment: Submitted on behalf of Planck Collaboration by Clive Dickinson. 30\n  pages, 24 figures, 3 tables Updated to match the accepted version"]}]

If dark matter exists as WDM instead of cold dark matter (CDM), its\nnon-negligible velocities can inhibit the formation of low-mass halos that\nnormally form first in CDM models, therefore delaying star-formation. The\nabsence of early sources delays the build-up of UV and X-ray backgrounds that\naffect the 21-cm radiation signal produced by neutral hydrogen.

CDM models where astrophysical sources have a suppressed\nphoton-production efficiency can delay the 21-cm signal as well, although its\nsubsequent evolution is not as rapid as compared to WDM. This motivates using\nthe gradient of the global 21-cm signal to differentiate between some CDM and\nWDM models. Finally, we show that the degeneracy between the astrophysics and\nmx can be broken with the 21-cm power spectrum, as WDM models should have a\nbias-induced excess of power on large scales.

Fluid variables on each side of the wall are similar for weakly\nfirst-order phase transitions, but differ significantly for stronger phase\ntransitions. As a consequence, we find that, for large enough supercooling, any\nsubsonic wall velocity becomes unstable. Moreover, as the velocity approaches\nthe speed of sound, perturbations become unstable on all wavelengths. For\nsmaller supercooling and small wall velocities, our results agree with those of\nprevious works.

A damping filter method is introduced to obtain variously\nlocalized solutions, and adopted into two typical cases. This method introduces\na spatially selective damping effect to make a good guess at the exact\nsolution, and we can obtain an exact solution through a continuation with the\ndamping amplitude. First target is a steady solution to Swift-Hohenberg\nequation, which is a representative of bi-stable systems in which localized\nsolutions coexist, and a model for span-wisely localized cases. Not only\nsolutions belonging to the well-known snaking branches but also those belonging\nto an isolated branch known as \"isolas\" are found with a continuation paths\nbetween them in phase space extended with the damping amplitude. This indicates\nthat this spatially selective excitation mechanism has an advantage in\nsearching spatially localized solutions. Second target is a spatially localized\ntraveling-wave solution to Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, which is a model for\nstream-wisely localized cases. Since the spatially selective damping effect\nbreaks Galilean and translational invariances, the propagation velocity cannot\nbe determined uniquely while the damping is active, and a singularity arises\nwhen these invariances are recovered.

The absorption by dimers changes more rapidly with pressure\nand density than that of monomers, and can therefore provide additional\ninformation about atmospheric pressures. By comparing the absorption strengths\nof rotational and vibrational features to the absorption strengths of dimer\nfeatures, we show that in some cases it may be possible to estimate the\npressure at the reflecting surface of a planet.

The purpose of NINJA is to study the ability to detect\ngravitational waves emitted from merging binary black holes and recover their\nparameters with next-generation gravitational-wave observatories. We report\nhere on the results of the second NINJA project, NINJA-2, which employs 60\ncomplete binary black hole hybrid waveforms consisting of a numerical portion\nmodelling the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown stitched to a post-Newtonian\nportion modelling the early inspiral. In a \"blind injection challenge\" similar\nto that conducted in recent LIGO and Virgo science runs, we added 7 hybrid\nwaveforms to two months of data recolored to predictions of Advanced LIGO and\nAdvanced Virgo sensitivity curves during their first observing runs. The\nresulting data was analyzed by gravitational-wave detection algorithms and 6 of\nthe waveforms were recovered with false alarm rates smaller than 1 in a\nthousand years. Parameter estimation algorithms were run on each of these\nwaveforms to explore the ability to constrain the masses, component angular\nmomenta and sky position of these waveforms. We also perform a large-scale\nmonte-carlo study to assess the ability to recover each of the 60 hybrid\nwaveforms with early Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo sensitivity curves. Our\nresults predict that early Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo will have a\nvolume-weighted average sensitive distance of 300Mpc (1Gpc) for\n$10M_{\\odot}+10M_{\\odot}$ ($50M_{\\odot}+50M_{\\odot}$) binary black hole\ncoalescences.

However, there has been relatively little work on\nquantifying the uncertainty in these selection procedures. In this paper, we\npropose a new method for inference in high dimensions using a score test based\non penalized regression. In this test, we perform penalized regression of an\noutcome on all but a single feature, and test for correlation of the residuals\nwith the held-out feature. This procedure is applied to each feature in turn.\nInterestingly, when an $\\ell_1$ penalty is used, the sparsity pattern of the\nlasso corresponds exactly to a decision based on the proposed test. Further,\nwhen an $\\ell_2$ penalty is used, the test corresponds precisely to a score\ntest in a mixed effects model, in which the effects of all but one feature are\nassumed to be random. We formulate the hypothesis being tested as a compromise\nbetween the null hypotheses tested in simple linear regression on each feature\nand in multiple linear regression on all features, and develop reference\ndistributions for some well-known penalties.

We started an extensive observational program to\ncharacterize a sample of 34 fossil group candidates spanning a broad range of\nphysical properties. Deep $r-$band images were taken for each candidate and\noptical spectroscopic observations were obtained for $\\sim$ 1200 galaxies. This\nnew dataset was completed with SDSS DR7 archival data to obtain robust cluster\nmembership and global properties of each fossil group candidate. For each\nsystem, we recomputed the magnitude gaps between the two brightest galaxies\n($\\Delta m_{12}$) and the first and fourth ranked galaxies ($\\Delta m_{14}$)\nwithin 0.5 $R_{{\\rm 200}}$. We consider fossil systems those with $\\Delta\nm_{12} \\ge 2$ mag or $\\Delta m_{14} \\ge 2.5$ mag within the errors. We find\nthat 15 candidates turned out to be fossil systems. Their observational\nproperties agree with those of non-fossil systems. Both follow the same\ncorrelations, but fossils are always extreme cases. In particular, they host\nthe brightest central galaxies and the fraction of total galaxy light enclosed\nin the central galaxy is larger in fossil than in non-fossil systems. Finally,\nwe confirm the existence of genuine fossil clusters. Combining our results with\nothers in the literature, we favor the merging scenario in which fossil systems\nformed due to mergers of $L^\\ast$ galaxies. The large magnitude gap is a\nconsequence of the extreme merger ratio within fossil systems and therefore it\nis an evolutionary effect. Moreover, we suggest that at least one candidate in\nour sample could represent a transitional fossil stage.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

For the revised algorithm, the\nincremental voltage change step size is adaptively adjusted based on the slope\nof the power-voltage (P-V) curve. An accelerating factor and a decelerating\nfactor are further applied to adjust the voltage step change considering\nwhether the sign of the P-V curve slope remains the same or not in a subsequent\ntracking step. In addition, the upper bound of the maximum voltage step change\nis also updated considering the information of sign changes. The revised MPPT\nalgorithm can quickly track the maximum power points (MPPs) and remove the\noscillation of the actual operation points around the real MPPs.

Inspired by natural\nphenomena, researchers have developed many successful evolutionary algorithms\nwhich, at original versions, define operators that mimic the way nature solves\ncomplex problems, with no actual consideration of the exploration/exploitation\nbalance. In this paper, a novel nature-inspired algorithm called the States of\nMatter Search (SMS) is introduced. The SMS algorithm is based on the simulation\nof the states of matter phenomenon. In SMS, individuals emulate molecules which\ninteract to each other by using evolutionary operations which are based on the\nphysical principles of the thermal-energy motion mechanism. The algorithm is\ndevised by considering each state of matter at one different\nexploration/exploitation ratio. The evolutionary process is divided into three\nphases which emulate the three states of matter: gas, liquid and solid. In each\nstate, molecules (individuals) exhibit different movement capacities. Beginning\nfrom the gas state (pure exploration), the algorithm modifies the intensities\nof exploration and exploitation until the solid state (pure exploitation) is\nreached. As a result, the approach can substantially improve the balance\nbetween exploration/exploitation, yet preserving the good search capabilities\nof an evolutionary approach.\n","Comment: 22 pages"]}]

First, we study a setting in which one decoder can use a finite\ncapacity link to send the other decoder information regarding the messages or\nthe channel states. In this scenario we analyze two cases: one where noncausal\nstate information is available to the encoder and the strong decoder and the\nother where state information is available only to the encoder in a causal\nmanner. Second, we examine a setting in which the cooperation between the\ndecoders is limited to taking place before the outputs of the channel are\ngiven. In this case, one decoder, which is informed of the state sequence\nnoncausally, can cooperate only to send the other decoder rate-limited\ninformation about the state sequence. The proofs of the capacity regions\nintroduce a new method of coding for channels with cooperation between\ndifferent users, where we exploit the link between the decoders for\nmultiple-binning.

A famous trend to overcome this issue is to focus\non subclasses of alternant/Goppa codes with a non trivial automorphism group.\nSuch codes display then symmetries allowing compact parity-check or generator\nmatrices. For instance, a key-reduction is obtained by taking quasi-cyclic (QC)\nor quasi-dyadic (QD) alternant/Goppa codes. We show that the use of such\nsymmetric alternant/Goppa codes in cryptography introduces a fundamental\nweakness. It is indeed possible to reduce the key-recovery on the original\nsymmetric public-code to the key-recovery on a (much) smaller code that has not\nanymore symmetries. This result is obtained thanks to a new operation on codes\ncalled folding that exploits the knowledge of the automorphism group. This\noperation consists in adding the coordinates of codewords which belong to the\nsame orbit under the action of the automorphism group. The advantage is\ntwofold: the reduction factor can be as large as the size of the orbits, and it\npreserves a fundamental property: folding the dual of an alternant (resp.\nGoppa) code provides the dual of an alternant (resp. Goppa) code. A key point\nis to show that all the existing constructions of alternant/Goppa codes with\nsymmetries follow a common principal of taking codes whose support is globally\ninvariant under the action of affine transformations (by building upon prior\nworks of T. Berger and A. D{\\\"{u}}r). This enables not only to present a\nunified view but also to generalize the construction of QC, QD and even\nquasi-monoidic (QM) Goppa codes. All in all, our results can be harnessed to\nboost up any key-recovery attack on McEliece systems based on symmetric\nalternant or Goppa codes, and in particular algebraic attacks.\n","Comment: 19 pages"]}]

Although the result is no longer true for bargaining problems\nwith more than two agents, none of the well known bargaining solutions are\nordinal. Searching for meaningful ordinal solutions, especially for the\nbilateral bargaining problem, has been a challenging issue in bargaining theory\nfor more than three decades. This paper proposes a logic-based ordinal solution\nto the bilateral bargaining problem. We argue that if a bargaining problem is\nmodeled in terms of the logical relation of players physical negotiation items,\na meaningful bargaining solution can be constructed based on the ordinal\nstructure of bargainers preferences. We represent bargainers demands in\npropositional logic and bargainers preferences over their demands in total\npreorder. We show that the solution satisfies most desirable logical\nproperties, such as individual rationality (logical version), consistency,\ncollective rationality as well as a few typical game-theoretic properties, such\nas weak Pareto optimality and contraction invariance. In addition, if all\nplayers demand sets are logically closed, the solution satisfies a fixed-point\ncondition, which says that the outcome of a negotiation is the result of mutual\nbelief revision. Finally, we define various decision problems in relation to\nour bargaining model and study their computational complexity.\n"]}]
