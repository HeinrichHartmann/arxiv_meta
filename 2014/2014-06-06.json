In the classical auction theory for agents\nwith linear utility and single-dimensional preferences, Bulow and Roberts\n(1989) show that the optimal auction of Myerson (1981) is in fact optimizing\nmarginal revenue. In particular Myerson's virtual values are exactly the\nderivative of an appropriate revenue curve.\n  This paper considers mechanism design in environments where the agents have\nmulti-dimensional and non-linear preferences. Understanding good auctions for\nthese environments is considered to be the main challenge in Bayesian optimal\nmechanism design. In these environments maximizing marginal revenue may not be\noptimal and there is sometimes no direct way to implement the marginal revenue\nmaximization. Our contributions are three fold: we characterize the settings\nfor which marginal revenue maximization is optimal (by identifying an important\ncondition that we call revenue linearity), we give simple procedures for\nimplementing marginal revenue maximization in general, and we show that\nmarginal revenue maximization is approximately optimal. Our approximation\nfactor smoothly degrades in a term that quantifies how far the environment is\nfrom ideal (where marginal revenue maximization is optimal). Because the\nmarginal revenue mechanism is optimal for single-dimensional agents, our\ngeneralization immediately approximately extends many results for\nsingle-dimensional agents.\n  One of the biggest open questions in Bayesian algorithmic mechanism design is\ndeveloping methodologies that are not brute-force in the size of the agent type\nspace. Our methods identify a subproblem that, e.g., for unit-demand agents\nwith values drawn from product distributions, enables approximation mechanisms\nthat are polynomial in the dimension.\n"]}]

The hydraulic conductivities corresponding to the mechanical\nproperties at these two scales are different. In the bulk elastic host rock,\nthe hydraulic conductivity does not vary much with the deformation, while it\nsignificantly changes in the lower scale of the localization zone due to\ninelastic deformation. Increase of permeability due to fracture and/or\ndilation, or reduction of permeability due to material compaction can take\nplace inside this zone. The challenge is to predict the evolution of hydraulic\nconductivities coupled with the mechanical behaviour of the material in all\nstages of the deformation process.

Specifically, our approach, Learning TO Diversify\nvia Weighted Kernels (L2DWK), performs classifier combination by optimizing a\ndirect but simple criterion: maximizing ensemble accuracy and adaptive\ndiversity simultaneously by minimizing a convex loss function. Given a measure\nformulation, the diversity is calculated with weighted kernels (i.e., the\ndiversity is measured on the component classifiers' outputs which are kernelled\nand weighted), and the kernel weights are automatically learned.

In a similar vein, irregular disks and mergers can also be\ndistinguished from bulges and regular disks with a contamination lower than\n20%.

To mitigate the interruptions, the media\nplayer prefetches streaming contents before starting playback, at a cost of\ndelay. We study the QoE of streaming from the perspective of flow dynamics.\nFirst, a framework is developed for QoE when streaming users join the network\nrandomly and leave after downloading completion. We compute the distribution of\nprefetching delay using partial differential equations (PDEs), and the\nprobability generating function of playout buffer starvations using ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs) for CBR streaming. Second, we extend our\nframework to characterize the throughput variation caused by opportunistic\nscheduling at the base station, and the playback variation of VBR streaming.\nOur study reveals that the flow dynamics is the fundamental reason of playback\nstarvation. The QoE of streaming service is dominated by the first moments such\nas the average throughput of opportunistic scheduling and the mean playback\nrate.

We give a new formula of special values by constructing a morphism of\nhomology theories, which we call regulator, from higher Chow group to weight\nhomology. Our regulator is defined by using the notion of weight complex for\nvarieties over a perfect field, which was introduced by Gillet and Soule. The\nmain idea of the proof of our formula of special values is to use weight\nspectral sequence of homology theories, whose E1 terms are homology groups for\nsmooth projective schemes. Also, to calculate special values, we prove that the\nweight complex for any variety over a perfect field is bounded. This\nboundedness result was known by Gillet and Soule in the case that the base\nfield admits resolution of singularities, but not in general.\n","Comment: 21 pages"]}]
