Our approach is based on three offline steps resulting in an\naccurate reduced-order model that can be used as a surrogate for the\ntrue/fiducial waveform family. First, a set of m parameter values is determined\nusing a greedy algorithm from which a reduced basis representation is\nconstructed. Second, these m parameters induce the selection of m time values\nfor interpolating a waveform time series using an empirical interpolant. Third,\na fit in the parameter dimension is performed for the waveform's value at each\nof these m times.

The entropy is thus easily measured from the\nexpectation value of a local observable computed at the target temperature T\nonly.

To assess the\nlevel of absolute bias in each prescription, we then repeat the analysis on\ndark matter halo catalogs in N-body simulations designed to mimic the mass\ndistribution in the current data release of Planck SZ clusters.

The fruitfulness of this approach is illustrated on a number of\nexample, including the spin canting in YTiO$_3$ and LaMnO$_3$, formation of\nspiral magnetic order in BiFeO$_3$, and the magnetic inversion symmetry\nbreaking in BiMnO$_3$, which gives rise to both ferroelectric activity and DM\ninteractions, responsible for the ferromagnetism.\n","Comment: 42 pagse, 5 figure, 6 tables"]}]

Moreover, we found that\nburiedness and packing density were better predictors of evolutionary variation\nthan was structural flexibility. Finally, variability in designed structures\nwas a weaker predictor of evolutionary variability than was buriedness or\npacking density, but it was comparable in its predictive power to the best\nstructural flexibility measures.

Rev.} {\\bf D89},\n023520 (2014). It is investigated here how the luminosity distance -- redshift\nrelation $D_L(z)$ of the $\\Lambda$CDM model is duplicated in the Lema\\^{\\i}tre\n-- Tolman (L--T) model with $\\Lambda = 0$, constant bang-time function $t_B$\nand the energy function $E(r)$ mimicking accelerated expansion on the\nobserver's past light cone ($r$ is a uniquely defined comoving radial\ncoordinate). Numerical experiments show that $E > 0$ necessarily. The functions\n$z(r)$ and $E(r)$ are numerically calculated from the initial point at the\nobserver's position; then backward from the initial point at the apparent\nhorizon (AH). Reconciling the results of the two calculations allows one to\ndetermine the values of $E/r^2$ at $r = 0$ and at the AH. The problems\nconnected with continuing the calculation through the AH are discussed in\ndetail and solved. Then $z(r)$ and $E(r)$ are continued beyond the AH, up to\nthe numerical crash that signals the contact of the light cone with the Big\nBang. Similarly, the light cone of the L--T model is calculated by proceeding\nfrom the two initial points, and compared with the $\\Lambda$CDM light cone. The\nmodel constructed here contains shell crossings, but they can be removed by\nmatching the L--T region to a Friedmann background, without causing any\nconflict with the type Ia supernovae observations. The mechanism of imitating\nthe accelerated expansion by the $E(r)$ function is explained in a descriptive\nway.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 14 figures. Penultimate paragraph of Sec.

The lattice spacing is varied by\nchanging the number of lattice sites, $N_t$, in the Euclidean time direction.\nQCD with 3 flavours is studied for comparison. Since this theory is expected to\nbe conformal, with an infrared fixed point, the coupling constant at the chiral\ntransition should approach a non-zero value as $N_t$ becomes large. Our earlier\nsimulations on lattices with $N_t=4$ and $N_t=6$ exhibited a significant\ndecrease in coupling at the chiral transition as $N_t$ was increased.

We show how the NRG approximation affects\nthe trace of the projected density matrices and the continuity of the\ntime-evolution of a local observable. For the general pulse case, the local\nobservable in the long-time limit exhibits a dependence on the switch-on time,\nthe time interval between the first and last quenches, as well as on the pulse\nshape. In particular, the long-time limit is improved for longer switch-on\ntimes and smoother pulses. This lends support to our earlier suggestion that\nthe long-time limit of observables can be improved by replacing a sudden large\nquench by a sequence of smaller ones acting over a finite time-interval: longer\nswitch-on times and smoother pulses, i.e., increased adiabaticity, favor\nrelaxation of the system to its correct thermodynamic long-time limit. For the\ncase of periodic driving, we compare the TDNRG results to exact analytic ones\nfor the non-interacting resonant level model, finding better agreement at short\nto intermediate time scales in the case of smoother driving. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the validity of the multiple-quench TDNRG formalism for arbitrary\ntemperatures by studying the time-evolution of the occupation number in the\nAnderson impurity model in response to a periodic switching of the local level\nfrom the mixed valence to the Kondo regime at finite temperatures.\n","Comment: 12 pages and 8 figures"]}]

The basic principles of how intelligence acts\nare discussed. The human brain processes involved in decisions are argued to be\nprincipally different from straightforward computer operations. The difference\nlies in the conscious-subconscious duality of the decision making process and\nthe role of emotions that compete with utility optimization. The most general\napproach for characterizing the process of decision making, taking into account\nthe conscious-subconscious duality, uses the framework of functional analysis\nin Hilbert spaces, similarly to that used in the quantum theory of\nmeasurements. This does not imply that the brain is a quantum system, but just\nallows for the simplest and most general extension of classical decision\ntheory. The resulting theory of quantum decision making, based on the rules of\nquantum measurements, solves all paradoxes of classical decision making,\nallowing for quantitative predictions that are in excellent agreement with\nexperiments. Finally, we provide a novel application by comparing the\npredictions of QDT with experiments on the prisoner dilemma game.
