Varying the horizontal scale of the computational\ndomain, we investigate the dependence of the dynamo upon the rotation rate.

Implicit in our ideas is the assumption that at \"large enough\" scales\none can treat objects within these inertial systems as point-particles having\nan insignificant effect on the curvature of space-time. We then proceed under\nthe assumption that time and space are fundamentally intertwined such that\ntime- and spatial-translational invariance are not inherent symmetries of flat\nspace-time (i.e. observable clock rates depend upon both relative velocity and\nspatial position within these inertial systems) and take the geodesics of this\ntheory in the radial Rindler chart as the proper characterization of inertial\nmotion. With this commitment, we are able to model solely with inertial motion\nthe observed effects expected to be the result of `dark energy', `dark matter',\nand `dark flow'. In addition, we examine the potential observable implications\nof our theory in a gravitational system located within a confined region of an\ninertial reference frame, subsequently interpreting the Pioneer anomaly as\nsupport for our redefinition of inertial motion. As well, we extend our\nanalysis into quantum mechanics by quantizing for a real scalar field and find\na possible explanation for the asymmetry between matter and antimatter within\nthe framework of these redefined inertial systems.\n","Comment: 55 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables, 6 appendices; added two unpublished\n  sections with supplementary material (see Comments section of PLoS ONE\n  publication link).

This is achieved by using a deterministic non-block-based\nnetwork coding scheme, which allows us to sidestep some of the limitations put\nin place by the block coding model used to determine the network capacity.\n  Under the network coding scheme we outline, the sender is able to transmit\nnetwork coded packets above the channel rate of some receivers, while ensuring\nthat they still experience nonzero delivery rates. Interestingly, in this\ngeneralised form of asynchronous network coded broadcast, receivers are not\nrequired to obtain knowledge of all packets transmitted so far. Instead, causal\nfeedback from the receivers about packet erasures is used by the sender to\ndetermine a network coded transmission that will allow at least one, but often\nmultiple receivers, to deliver their next needed packet.\n  Although the analysis of deterministic coding schemes is generally a\ndifficult problem, by making some approximations we are able to obtain\ntractable estimates of the receivers' delivery rates, which are shown to match\nreasonably well with simulation. Using these estimates, we design a fairness\nalgorithm that allocates the sender's resources so all receivers will\nexperience fair delivery rate performance.\n"]}]

It is shown\nthat the definition of an assembly type is a self-consistency criterion that\nmust strike a balance between precision and the need for population levels to\nbe slowly varying relative to the time scale of atomic motion. The deductive\nmultiscale approach is complemented by a qualitative notion of multicomponent\nassociation and the ensemble of exact atomic-level configurations consistent\nwith them. In processes such as viral self-assembly from proteins and RNA or\nDNA, there are many possible intermediates, so that it is usually difficult to\npredict the most efficient assembly pathway. However, in the current study,\nrates of assembly of each possible intermediate can be predicted. This avoids\nthe need, as in a phenomenological approach, for recalibration with each new\napplication. The method accounts for the feedback across scales in space and\ntime that is fundamental to nanosystem self-assembly. The theory has\napplications to bionanostructures, geomaterials, engineered composites, and\nnanocapsule therapeutic delivery systems.\n","Comment: 3 figures"]}]

It has\na number of applications in particular in medical imaging. In this article we\nprovide a new general approach to shape deformation analysis, within the\nframework of optimal control theory, in which a deformation is represented as\nthe flow of diffeomorphisms generated by time-dependent vector fields. Using\nreproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of vector fields, the general shape\ndeformation analysis problem is specified as an infinite-dimensional optimal\ncontrol problem with state and control constraints. In this problem, the states\nare diffeomorphisms and the controls are vector fields, both of them being\nsubject to some constraints. The functional to be minimized is the sum of a\nfirst term defined as geometric norm of the control (kinetic energy of the\ndeformation) and of a data attachment term providing a geometric distance to\nthe target shape. This point of view has several advantages. First, it allows\none to model general constrained shape analysis problems, which opens new\nissues in this field. Second, using an extension of the Pontryagin maximum\nprinciple, one can characterize the optimal solutions of the shape deformation\nproblem in a very general way as the solutions of constrained geodesic\nequations. Finally, recasting general algorithms of optimal control into shape\nanalysis yields new efficient numerical methods in shape deformation analysis.\nOverall, the optimal control point of view unifies and generalizes different\ntheoretical and numerical approaches to shape deformation problems, and also\nallows us to design new approaches. The optimal control problems that result\nfrom this construction are infinite dimensional and involve some constraints,\nand thus are nonstandard.
