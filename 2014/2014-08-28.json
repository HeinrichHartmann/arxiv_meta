The notion of canonicity in the presence of fixed point operators\nis not entirely straightforward. In the algebraic setting of canonical\nextensions we examine both the usual notion of canonicity and what we will call\ntame canonicity. This latter concept has previously been investigated for the\nclassical mu-calculus by Bezhanishvili and Hodkinson. Our approach is in the\nspirit of Sahlqvist theory. That is, we identify syntactically-defined classes\nof inequalities, namely the restricted inductive and tame inductive\ninequalities, which are, respectively, canonical or tame canonical. Our\napproach is to use an algorithm which processes inequalities with the aim of\neliminating propositional variables. The algorithm we introduce is closely\nrelated to the algorithms ALBA and mu-ALBA studied by Conradie, Palmigiano, et\nal. It is based on a calculus of rewrite rules, the soundness of which rests\nupon the way in which algebras embed into their canonical extensions and the\norder-theoretic properties of the latter. We show that the algorithm succeeds\non every restricted inductive inequality by means of a so-called proper run,\nand that this is sufficient to guarantee their canonicity. Likewise, we are\nable to show that the algorithm succeeds on every tame inductive inequality by\nmeans of a so-called tame run. In turn, this guarantees their tame canonicity.\n"]}]

We start by\nintroducing the Non-Diffracting Waves (NDW), and by a definition of NDWs.\nAfterwards we recall -besides ordinary waves (gaussian beams, gaussian pulses)-\nthe simplest non diffracting waves (Bessel beams, X-shaped pulses,...). In\nSec.2 we show how to eliminate any backward-traveling components, first in the\ncase of ideal NDW pulses, and then, in Sec.3, for realistic finite-energy NDW\npulses. In particular, in subsec.3.1 we forward a general functional expression\nfor any totally-forward non-diffracting pulses. Then, in Sec.4 an efficient\nmethod is set forth for the analytic description of truncated beams, a\nbyproduct of its being the elimination of any need of lengthy numerical\ncalculations. In Sec.5 we explore the question of the subluminal NDWs, or\nbullets, in terms of two different methods, the second one allowing the\nanalytic description of non-diffracting waves with a static envelope (\"Frozen\nWaves\", FW), in terms of continuous Bessel beam superpositions. The production\nof such Frozen Waves (experimentally generated in recent time for Optics) is\ntheoretically developed in Sec.6 also for the case of absorbing media. Sec.7\ndiscusses the role of Special Relativity and of Lorentz transformations,\nrelevant for the physical comprehension of the NDW issue. In Sec.8 we present\nfurther analytic solutions to the wave equations, with use of higher-order\nBessel beams. Next, Sec.9 deals in detail with an application of NDWs to\nOptical Tweezers. In Sec.10 we show that \"soliton-like\" solutions can be found\nalso in the different case of the ordinary linear Schroedinger equation within\nstandard Quantum Mechanics. Some complementary issues are just mentioned in the\nlast Section. This work also constitutes a part of a much longer Review in\npreparation.\n","Comment: review of 74 pages, including 23 Figures.

In this model, the channel input is\nconstrained by the available energy at each channel use, which is driven by an\nexternal energy harvesting process, the size of the battery, and the previous\nchannel inputs. We consider an abstraction where energy is harvested in binary\nunits and stored in a battery with the capacity of a single unit, and the\nchannel inputs are binary. Viewing the available energy in the battery as a\nstate, this is a state-dependent channel with input-dependent states, memory in\nthe states, and causal state information available at the transmitter only. We\nfind an equivalent representation for this channel based on the timings of the\nsymbols, and determine the capacity of the resulting equivalent timing channel\nvia an auxiliary random variable. We give achievable rates based on certain\nselections of this auxiliary random variable which resemble lattice coding for\nthe timing channel. We develop upper bounds for the capacity by using a\ngenie-aided method, and also by quantifying the leakage of the state\ninformation to the receiver. We show that the proposed achievable rates are\nasymptotically capacity achieving for small energy harvesting rates. We extend\nthe results to the case of ternary channel inputs. Our achievable rates give\nthe capacity of the binary channel within 0.03 bits/channel use, the ternary\nchannel within 0.05 bits/channel use, and outperform basic Shannon strategies\nthat only consider instantaneous battery states, for all parameter values.\n","Comment: Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, August 2014"]}]
