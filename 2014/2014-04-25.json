This description suggests that\nthe intensity of the nucleation of new droplets is suppressed in spherical\ndiffusion regions of a certain size surrounding previously nucleated droplets,\nand remains at the initial level in the remaining volume of the vapor-gas\nmedium. The value of volume excluded from nucleation depends on the explicit\nform of the vapor concentration profile in the space around the growing\ndroplet, and we use for that the unsteady self-similar solution of\ntime-dependent diffusion equation with a convective term describing the flow of\nthe gas-vapor mixture caused by moving surface of single growing droplet. The\nmain characteristics of the phase transition at the end of the nucleation stage\nare found and compared with those in the theory of nucleation with homogeneous\nvapor consumption (the theory of mean-field vapor supersaturation).\n","Comment: This work was presented on Research Workshop 'Nucleation Theory and\n  Applications' (Dubna, Russia) in 2013.

Thus, the development of ab initio methods that allow\nfor an accurate and computationally inexpensive treatment of charge-transfer\nexcitations is a topic that nowadays attracts a lot of scientific attention. In\nthis paper we extend an approach recently introduced for the description of\nsingle and double excitations (M. Tassi, I. Theophilou and S. Thanos, Int. J.\nQuantum Chem., (113), 690 (2013), M.

We describe an excitation where an\nelectron is transferred from a donor system to an acceptor one, keeping the\nexcited state orthogonal to the ground state and avoiding variational collapse.\nThese conditions are achieved by decomposing the space spanned by the\nHartree-Fock (HF) ground state orbitals into four subspaces: The subspace\nspanned by the occupied orbitals that are localized in the region of the donor\nmolecule, the corresponding for the acceptor ones and two more subspaces\ncontaining the virtual orbitals that are localized in the neighborhood of the\ndonor and the acceptor, respectively. Next, we create a Slater determinant with\na hole in the subspace of occupied orbitals of the donor and a particle in the\nvirtual subspace of the acceptor. Subsequently we optimize both the hole and\nthe particle by minimizing the HF energy functional in the corresponding\nsubspaces. Finally, we test our approach by calculating the lowest\ncharge-transfer excitation energies for a set of tetracyanoethylene-hydrocarbon\ncomplexes, that have been used earlier as a test set for such kind of\nexcitations.\n"]}]

We find several\nheavy-quark spin doublets in the open-bottom sectors, where anti-B and anti-B*\nmesons are present. In the meson sector we find several resonant states, among\nthem, a B0 and a B1 with masses 5530 MeV and 5579 MeV as well as Bs0* and Bs1*\nnarrow states at 5748 MeV and 5799 MeV, respectively. They form two doublets\nwith no experimental identification yet, the first one being the bottom\ncounterpart of the D0(2400) and D1(2430) states, and the second bottom doublet\nassociated to the ubiquitous Ds0* (2317) and the Ds1 (2460). In the baryon\nsector, several Lambda_b and Sigma_b doublets are identified, among them the\none given by the experimental Lambda_b(5910) and Lambda*_b(5921). Moreover, one\nof our states, the Sigma_b*(5904), turns out to be the bottom counterpart of\nthe Sigma*(1670) and Sigma_c*(2549), which is a case for discovery. We finally\nanalyze different transport coefficients for the anti-B meson in hot matter,\nsuch as formed in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. For RHIC/LHC energies,\nthe main contribution to the coefficients comes from the interaction of anti-B\nmesons with pions. However, we also include the effects of baryonic density\nwhich might be sizable at temperatures T < 100 MeV, as the chemical potential\nis expected to increase in the last stages of the expansion. We conclude that\nalthough the relaxation time decreases with larger baryonic densities, the\nanti-B meson does not thermalize at RHIC/LHC energies, representing an ideal\nprobe for the initial bottom distribution.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 5 figures"]}]

We consider categorical labeling tasks and formulate the\nbudget allocation problem as a Bayesian Markov decision process (MDP), which\nsimultaneously conducts learning and decision making.

Moreover, admission\ncontrol is introduced at the relay queue, whereby a PU's packet is admitted to\nthe relay queue with an admission probability. The proposed policy introduces a\nfundamental tradeoff between the delays of the PU and SU. Consequently, it\nopens room for trading the PU delay for enhanced SU delay and vice versa.

Furthermore, a moment generating function approach is\nemployed to derive closed-form expressions for the average delay encountered by\nthe packets of both users. The effect of varying the service and admission\nprobabilities on the system's throughput and delay is thoroughly investigated.\nResults show that cooperation expands the stable throughput region.

This pattern is statistically steady, is oriented obliquely to the\nstreamwise direction, and has a very large wavelength relative to the gap. The\nmean flow, averaged in time and in the homogeneous direction, is analysed. The\nflow in the quasi-laminar region is not the linear Couette profile, but results\nfrom a non-trivial balance between advection and diffusion. This force balance\nyields a first approximation to the relationship between the Reynolds number,\nangle, and wavelength of the pattern. Remarkably, the variation of the mean\nflow along the pattern wavevector is found to be almost exactly harmonic: the\nflow can be represented via only three cross-channel profiles as U(x,y,z) =\nU_0(y) + U_c(y) cos(kz) + U_s(y) sin(kz). A model is formulated which relates\nthe cross-channel profiles of the mean flow and of the Reynolds stress. Regimes\ncomputed for a full range of angle and Reynolds number in a tilted rectangular\nperiodic computational domain are presented. Observations of regular\nturbulent-laminar patterns in other shear flows -- Taylor-Couette,\nrotor-stator, and plane Poiseuille -- are compared.\n"]}]
