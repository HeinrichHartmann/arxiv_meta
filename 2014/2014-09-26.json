In this context, high resolution tSZ observations (~\ntens of arcsec) are of particular interest to probe intermediate and high\nredshift clusters. Observations of the tSZ effect will be carried out with the\nmillimeter dual-band NIKA2 camera, based on Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs)\nto be installed at the IRAM 30-meter telescope in 2015. To demonstrate the\npotential of such an instrument, we present tSZ observations with the NIKA\ncamera prototype, consisting of two arrays of 132 and 224 detectors that\nobserve at 140 and 240 GHz with a 18.5 and 12.5 arcsec angular resolution,\nrespectively. The cluster RX J1347.5-1145 was observed simultaneously at 140\nand 240 GHz. We used a spectral decorrelation technique to remove the\natmospheric noise and obtain a map of the cluster at 140 GHz. The efficiency of\nthis procedure has been characterized through realistic simulations of the\nobservations. The observed 140 GHz map presents a decrement at the cluster\nposition consistent with the tSZ nature of the signal. We used this map to\nstudy the pressure distribution of the cluster by fitting a gNFW model to the\ndata. Subtracting this model from the map, we confirm that RX J1347.5-1145 is\nan ongoing merger, which confirms and complements previous tSZ and X-ray\nobservations. For the first time, we demonstrate the tSZ capability of KID\nbased instruments. The NIKA2 camera with ~ 5000 detectors and a 6.5 arcmin\nfield of view will be well-suited for in-depth studies of the intra cluster\nmedium in intermediate to high redshifts, which enables the characterization of\nrecently detected clusters by the Planck satellite.\n","Comment: Accepted by A&A"]}]

We quantise\nthe field using non-stationary local modes which, at some arbitrarily chosen\ninitial time, are completely localised within the left or the right side of the\nbox. In this concrete set-up we directly face the problems inherent to a notion\nof local field excitations, usually thought of as elementary particles.\nSpecifically, by computing the Bogoliubov coefficients relating local and\nstandard (global) quantizations, we show that the local quantisation yields a\nFock space $\\mathfrak F^L$ which is unitarily inequivalent to the standard one\n$\\mathfrak F^G$. In spite of this, we find that the local creators and\nannihilators remain well defined in the global Fock space $\\mathfrak F^G$, and\nso do the local number operators associated to the left and right partitions of\nthe box. We end up with a useful mathematical toolbox to analyse and\ncharacterise local features of quantum states in $\\mathfrak F^G$. Specifically,\nan analysis of the global vacuum state $|0_G\\rangle\\in\\mathfrak F^G$ in terms\nof local number operators shows, as expected, the existence of entanglement\nbetween the left and right regions of the box. The local vacuum\n$|0_L\\rangle\\in\\mathfrak F^L$, on the contrary, has a very different character.\nIt is neither cyclic nor separating and displays no entanglement. Further\nanalysis shows that the global vacuum also exhibits a distribution of local\nexcitations reminiscent, in some respects, of a thermal bath. We discuss how\nthe mathematical tools developed herein may open new ways for the analysis of\nfundamental problems in local quantum field theory.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 8 figures"]}]

Leja sequences are arbitrarily granular (any\nnumber of nodes may be added to a current sequence, producing a new sequence)\nand thus are a good choice for the univariate composite rule used to construct\nadaptive sparse grids in high dimensions. When undertaking stochastic\ncollocation one is often interested in constructing weighted approximation\nwhere the weights are determined by the probability densities of the random\nvariables. This paper establishes that a certain weighted formulation of\none-dimensional Leja sequences produces a sequence of nodes whose empirical\ndistribution converges to the corresponding limiting distribution of the Gauss\nquadrature nodes associated with the weight function. This property is true\neven for unbounded domains. We apply the Leja-sparse grid approach to several\nhigh-dimensional and problems and demonstrate that Leja sequences are often\nsuperior to more standard sparse grid constructions (e.g. Clenshaw-Curtis), at\nleast for interpolatory metrics.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 11 figures"]}]

We found that the two optimal-filter\nluminosities extract virial information (size and virial velocity of the broad\nline region, BLR) from the spectra, justifying their usage in this empirical BH\nmass estimator. The major advantages of this new recipe over traditional SE BH\nmass estimators utilizing continuum luminosity and broad line width are: 1) it\nhas a smaller intrinsic scatter of 0.28 dex calibrated against RM masses; 2) it\nis extremely simple to use in practice, without any need to decompose the\nspectrum; 3) it produces unambiguous and highly repeatable results even with\nlow signal-to-noise spectra. The combination of the two luminosities can also\ncancel out, to some extent, systematic luminosity errors potentially introduced\nby uncertainties in distance or flux calibration. In addition, we recalibrated\nthe traditional SE mass estimators using broad Hbeta full width at half maximum\n(FWHM) and monochromatic continuum luminosity at 5100A (L_5100). We found that\nusing the best-fit slopes on FWHM and L_5100 (derived from fitting the BLR\nradius-luminosity relation and the correlation between rms line dispersion and\nSE FWHM, respectively) rather than simple assumptions (e.g., 0.5 for L_5100 and\n2 for FWHM) leads to more precise SE mass estimates, improving the intrinsic\nscatter from 0.41 dex to 0.36 dex with respect to the RM masses.

The statistically strongest result comes from a cluster\nanalysis that tests whether the \"hot spots\" within a $20^\\circ$ annulus at Loop\nI are preferentially located near the center line of the annulus. From this\ncluster analysis the authors report a $p$-value of 0.018% when considering the\nfour highest bins (75-87 $\\mu$K).

First, the analysis does not correctly\nselect the hot spots in the simulated sky realizations; second, it is sensitive\nto the map pixelization used, and in particular, pixel size used is similar to\nthe relevant clustering distance. I have run 10,000 simulated sky realizations\nto reproduce the analysis in Liu et al. and to calculate the effects of\nincorrect hot spot selection and of pixelization. Accounting for both of these\neffects, I find a corrected $p$-value of $\\sim1\\%$, both in the highest-bin\ntest and in the four-bin test. Finally, I note that even under the assumption\nthat Loop I contributes significant power to the ILC map, the observed\nclustering remains very unlikely. Therefore, a result inconsistent with\nstatistical isotropy is not automatically strong evidence for a detection of\nLoop I.

This shows that Voeovodsky's\n$DM_{gm}$ is anti-equivalent to Hanamura's one. We give a description of any\ntriangulated subcategory of $DM^{eff}_{gm}$ (including the category of\neffective mixed Tate motives). We descibe 'truncation' functors $t_N$ for\n$N>0$. $t=t_0$ generalizes the weight complex of Soule and Gillet; its target\nis $K^b(Chow_{eff})$; it calculates $K_0(DM^{eff}_{gm})$, and checks whether a\nmotive is a mixed Tate one. $t_N$ give a weight filtration and a 'motivic\ndescent spectral sequence' for a large class of realizations, including the\n'standard' ones and motivic cohomology. This gives a new filtration for the\nmotivic cohomology of a motif. For 'standard realizations' for $l,s\\ge 0$ we\nhave a nice description of $W_{l+s}H^i/W_{l-1}H^i(X)$ in terms of $t_s(X)$.\n  We define the 'length of a motif' that (modulo standard conjectures)\ncoincides with the 'total' length of the weight filtration of singular\ncohomology. Over a finite field $t_0Q$ is (modulo Beilinson-Parshin conjecture)\nan equivalence.\n","Comment: Several linguistic corrections made; section 2.3 was corrected also"]}]
