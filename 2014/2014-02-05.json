We\nstart from known classical solutions of the corresponding field equations and\nelaborate on the physics of the transverse traceless modes of linear\nfluctuations of the classical background, which obey a Schroedinger-like\nequation. We further consider two special cases in which this equation can be\nsolved analytically for any massive mode with m^2>0, in contrast with numerical\napproaches, allowing us to study in closed form the massive spectrum of\nKaluza-Klein (KK) excitations and to compute the corrections to Newton's law in\nthe thin brane limit. In the first case we consider a solution with a mass gap\nin the spectrum of KK fluctuations with two bound states - the massless 4D\ngraviton free of tachyonic instabilities and a massive KK excitation - as well\nas a tower of continuous massive KK modes which obey a Legendre equation. The\nmass gap is defined by the inverse of the brane thickness, allowing us to get\nrid of the potentially dangerous multiplicity of arbitrarily light KK modes. It\nis shown that due to this lucky circumstance, the solution of the mass\nhierarchy problem is much simpler and transparent than in the (thin)\nRandall-Sundrum (RS) two-brane configuration. In the second case we present a\nsmooth version of the RS model with a single massless bound state, which\naccounts for the 4D graviton, and a sector of continuous fluctuation modes with\nno mass gap, which obey a confluent Heun equation in the Ince limit.

Most of the literature has\nfocused on cash-additive risk measures, for which the eligible asset is a\nrisk-free bond, on the grounds that the general case can be reduced to the\ncash-additive case by a change of numeraire. However, discounting does not work\nin all financially relevant situations, typically when the eligible asset is a\ndefaultable bond. In this paper we fill this gap allowing for general eligible\nassets. We provide a variety of finiteness and continuity results for the\ncorresponding risk measures and apply them to risk measures based on\nValue-at-Risk and Tail Value-at-Risk on $L^p$ spaces, as well as to shortfall\nrisk measures on Orlicz spaces. We pay special attention to the property of\ncash subadditivity, which has been recently proposed as an alternative to cash\nadditivity to deal with defaultable bonds. For important examples, we provide\ncharacterizations of cash subadditivity and show that, when the eligible asset\nis a defaultable bond, cash subadditivity is the exception rather than the\nrule. Finally, we consider the situation where the eligible asset is not\nliquidly traded and the pricing rule is no longer linear. We establish when the\nresulting risk measures are quasiconvex and show that cash subadditivity is\nonly compatible with continuous pricing rules.\n"]}]

This new expression of Tsallis conditional entropy\nis shown to witness entanglement beyond the method based on global and local\nspectra of composite quantum states. When the reduced density matrix happens to\nbe a maximally mixed state, this conditional entropy coincides with the\nexpression in terms of Tsallis entropies derived earlier by Abe and Rajagopal\n(Physica A 289, 157 (2001)). Separability range in one parameter family of W\nand GHZ states with 3 and 4 qubits is explored here and it is shown that the\nresults inferred from negative Tsallis conditional entropy matches with that\nobtained through Peres partial transpose criteria for one-parameter family of W\nstates, in one of its partitions. The criteria is shown to be non-spectral\nthrough its usefulness in identifying entanglement in isospectral density\nmatrices.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures; Revised version; New footnote added; Accepted for\n  publication in Physical Review A"]}]

We also found that the AR features are more robust\nagainst the point-contact quality than the EPI ones, possibly, due to the large\ncoherence length in Zn compared to the typical PC size. Even for the PCs close\nto the ballistic regime with intense EPI spectra, the transmission coefficient\nevaluated from the AR spectra is near the one predicted theoretically for the\ndiffusive regime of a current flow in the PC.

In the presence of hard-core or other interaction, however, the\ncomparison is not trivial. Nevertheless, the ground-state energy of hard-core\nbosons is proved to be lower than that of spinless fermions, if all the hopping\namplitudes are nonnegative.

Although this approach has been evaluated in many contexts, the\nquestion remains if there are further opportunities to improve test focusing.\nOne idea is to identify other types of information that may indicate the\nlocation of defect-prone software parts. Data from software inspections, in\nparticular, appear to be promising. This kind of data might already lead to\nsoftware parts that have inherent difficulties or programming challenges, and\nin consequence might be defect-prone. This article first explains how\ninspection and product metrics can be used to focus testing activities. Second,\nwe compare selected product and inspection metrics commonly used to predict\ndefect-prone parts (e.g., size and complexity metrics, inspection defect\ncontent metrics, and defect density metrics). Based on initial experience from\ntwo case studies performed in different environments, the suitability of\ndifferent metrics for predicting defect-prone parts is illustrated. The studies\nrevealed that inspection defect data seems to be a suitable predictor, and a\ncombination of certain inspection and product metrics led to the best\nprioritizations in our contexts.

We have adapted the deconvolution methods used for making\nhigh dynamic range images of cosmic sources with radio arrays to making\ncomparably high dynamic range maps of spectral power of wavelike ionospheric\nphenomena. In the example presented here, we have used observations of the\ntotal electron content (TEC) gradient derived from Very Large Array (VLA)\nobservations of synchrotron emission from two galaxy clusters at 330 MHz as\nwell as GPS-based TEC measurements from a sparse array of 33 receivers located\nwithin New Mexico near the VLA. We show that these techniques provide a\nsignificant improvement in signal to noise (S/N) of detected wavelike\nstructures by correcting for both measurement inaccuracies and wavefront\ndistortions. This is especially true for the GPS data when combining all\navailable satellite/receiver pairs, which probe a larger physical area and\nlikely have a wider variety of measurement errors than in the single-satellite\ncase. In this instance, we found the peak S/N of the detected waves was\nimproved by more than an order of magnitude. The data products generated by the\ndeconvolution procedure also allow for a reconstruction of the fluctuations as\na two-dimensional waveform/phase screen that can be used to correct for their\neffects.\n","Comment: accepted for publication in the Journal of Geophysical Research:\n  Space Physics"]}]
