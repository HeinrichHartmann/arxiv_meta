The question of renormalizability is crucial if one wants\nto establish interesting GFTs as well-defined (perturbative) quantum field\ntheories, and in a second step connect them to known infrared gravitational\nphysics. Relying on recently developed tensorial tools, this thesis explores\nthe GFT formalism in two complementary directions. First, new results on the\nlarge cut-off expansion of the colored Boulatov-Ooguri models allow to explore\nfurther a non-perturbative regime in which infinitely many degrees of freedom\ncontribute. The second set of results provide a new rigorous framework for the\nrenormalization of so-called Tensorial GFTs (TGFTs) with gauge invariance\ncondition.

Each\npatch includes low energy excitations near a set of points on the Fermi surface\nwith a common tangent vector.

This is an informational\nanalogue of the mechanism design question, and views the information structure\nof a game as a mathematical object to be designed, rather than an exogenous\nvariable.\n  We initiate a complexity-theoretic examination of the design of optimal\ninformation structures in general Bayesian games, a task often referred to as\nsignaling. We focus on one of the simplest instantiations of the signaling\nquestion: Bayesian zero-sum games, and a principal who must choose an\ninformation structure maximizing the equilibrium payoff of one of the players.\nIn this setting, we show that optimal signaling is computationally intractable,\nand in some cases hard to approximate, assuming that it is hard to recover a\nplanted clique from an Erdos-Renyi random graph. This is despite the fact that\nequilibria in these games are computable in polynomial time, and therefore\nsuggests that the hardness of optimal signaling is a distinct phenomenon from\nthe hardness of equilibrium computation.

In wireless communications,\nthe goal is to increase the signal power at the intended user and reduce\ninterference to non-intended users. A high signal power is achieved by\ntransmitting the same data signal from all antennas, but with different\namplitudes and phases, such that the signal components add coherently at the\nuser. Low interference is accomplished by making the signal components add\ndestructively at non-intended users. This corresponds mathematically to\ndesigning beamforming vectors (that describe the amplitudes and phases) to have\nlarge inner products with the vectors describing the intended channels and\nsmall inner products with non-intended user channels.\n  While it is fairly easy to design a beamforming vector that maximizes the\nsignal power at the intended user, it is difficult to strike a perfect balance\nbetween maximizing the signal power and minimizing the interference leakage. In\nfact, the optimization of multiuser transmit beamforming is generally a\nnondeterministic polynomial-time (NP) hard problem [2].

The third trend is attributable to higher mass planets more\neffectively counteracting braking to spin up their stars.

All are eventually disrupted tidally,\neither by passing molecular clouds or the gravitational potential of their host\ngalaxies. However, their interior evolution can follow two very different\npaths. Only clusters of sufficiently large initial population and size undergo\nthe combined interior contraction and exterior expansion that leads eventually\nto core collapse. In all other systems, core collapse is frustrated by binary\nheating. These clusters globally expand for their entire lives, up to the point\nof tidal disruption.\n  Using a suite of direct N-body calculations, we trace the \"collapse line\" in\nr_v-N space that separates these two paths. Here, r_v and N are the cluster's\ninitial virial radius and population, respectively. For realistic starting\nradii, the dividing N-value is from 10^4 to over 10^5. We also show that there\nexists a minimum population, N_min, for core collapse. Clusters with N < N_min\ntidally disrupt before core collapse occurs. At the Sun's Galactocentric\nradius, R_G = 8.5 kpc, we find N_min >~ 300. The minimum population scales with\nGalactocentric radius as R_G^{-9/8}.\n  The position of an observed cluster relative to the collapse line can be used\nto predict its future evolution. Using a small sample of open clusters, we find\nthat most lie below the collapse line, and thus will never undergo core\ncollapse. Most globular clusters, on the other hand, lie well above the line.\nIn such a case, the cluster may or may not go through core collapse, depending\non its initial size.

The nonlinear conjugate gradient\n(NCG) method was recently proposed as an alternative to ALS, but the results\nindicated that NCG is usually not faster than ALS. To improve the convergence\nspeed of NCG, we consider a nonlinearly preconditioned nonlinear conjugate\ngradient (PNCG) algorithm for computing the rank-R canonical tensor\ndecomposition. Our approach uses ALS as a nonlinear preconditioner in the NCG\nalgorithm. Alternatively, NCG can be viewed as an acceleration process for ALS.\nWe demonstrate numerically that the convergence acceleration mechanism in PNCG\noften leads to important pay-offs for difficult tensor decomposition problems,\nwith convergence that is significantly faster and more robust than for the\nstand-alone NCG or ALS algorithms.

The Cosmic Ray Isotope Spectrometer (CRIS) collaboration has measured\nthe ratio between the fluxes of beryllium-10 and beryllium-9 in the energy\nrange E_0 \\simeq 70-145 MeV/nucleon, and has used the data to estimate an\nescape time tau_{ esc} = 15.0 +- 1.6 Myr. This widely quoted result has been\nobtained in the framework of a simple leaky-box model where the distributions\nof escape time and age for stable particles in the Galaxy are identical and\nhave exponential form. In general, the escape time and age distributions do not\ncoincide, they are not unique (because they depend on the injection or\nobservation point), and do not have a simple exponential shape. It is therefore\nnecessary to discuss the measurement of the beryllium ratio in a framework that\nis more general and more realistic than the leaky-box model.\n  In this work we compute the escape time and age distributions of cosmic rays\nin the Galaxy in a model based on diffusion that is much more realistic than\nthe simple leaky-box, but that remains sufficiently simple to have exact\nanalytic solutions. Using the age distributions of the model to interpret the\nmeasurements of the beryllium-10 suppression, one obtains a cosmic ray\nresidence time that is significantly longer (a factor 2 to 4 depending on the\nextension of the cosmic ray halo) than the leaky-box estimate. This revised\nresidence time implies a proportional reduction of the power needed to generate\nthe galactic cosmic rays.\n","Comment: Latex, 21 pages, 14 figures"]}]

By casting the\nlearning problem as a local kernel approximation, KBRL provides a way of\ncomputing a decision policy which is statistically consistent and converges to\na unique solution. Unfortunately, the model constructed by KBRL grows with the\nnumber of sample transitions, resulting in a computational cost that precludes\nits application to large-scale or on-line domains. In this paper we introduce\nan algorithm that turns KBRL into a practical reinforcement learning tool.\nKernel-based stochastic factorization (KBSF) builds on a simple idea: when a\ntransition matrix is represented as the product of two stochastic matrices, one\ncan swap the factors of the multiplication to obtain another transition matrix,\npotentially much smaller, which retains some fundamental properties of its\nprecursor. KBSF exploits such an insight to compress the information contained\nin KBRL's model into an approximator of fixed size. This makes it possible to\nbuild an approximation that takes into account both the difficulty of the\nproblem and the associated computational cost. KBSF's computational complexity\nis linear in the number of sample transitions, which is the best one can do\nwithout discarding data.

Firstly, the principles of control volume analysis are enunciated\nand applied to flows of conserved quantities (e.g. mass, momentum, energy)\nthrough a control volume, giving integral (Reynolds transport theorem) and\ndifferential forms of the conservation equations. Several definitions of steady\nstate are discussed. The concept of \"entropy\" is then established using Jaynes'\nmaximum entropy method, both in general and in equilibrium thermodynamics. The\nthermodynamic entropy then gives the \"entropy production\" concept. Equations\nfor the entropy production are then derived for simple, integral and\ninfinitesimal flow systems. Some technical aspects are examined, including\ndiscrete and continuum representations of volume elements, the effect of\nradiation, and the analysis of systems subdivided into compartments. A Reynolds\ndecomposition of the entropy production equation then reveals an \"entropy\nproduction closure problem\" in fluctuating dissipative systems: even at steady\nstate, the entropy production based on mean flow rates and gradients is not\nnecessarily in balance with the outward entropy fluxes based on mean\nquantities. Finally, a direct analysis of an infinitesimal element by Jaynes'\nmaximum entropy method yields a theoretical framework with which to predict the\nsteady state of a flow system. This is cast in terms of a \"minimum flux\npotential\" principle, which reduces, in different circumstances, to maximum or\nminimum entropy production (MaxEP or MinEP) principles.
