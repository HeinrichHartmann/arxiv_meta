The outflow is composed of discrete shells with different\nspeeds. One shell emits radiation for a short duration. Some of this radiation\nis scattered by the shell(s) behind.

Thomson scattering in a cold shell and inverse Compton scattering in a\nhot shell are both considered. The results of our calculations are applied to\nthe Gamma-Ray Bursts and the afterglows. We find that the scattered flux from a\ncold slower shell is small and likely to be detected only for those bursts with\nvery weak afterglows.

In this vein, a new interpretation of the\nconventional Dyer-Roeder (DR) approach by allowing light received from distant\nsources to travel in regions denser than average is proposed. It is argued that\nthe existence of a distribution of small and moderate cosmic voids (or \"black\nregions\") implies that its matter content was redistributed to the homogeneous\nand clustered matter components with the former becoming denser than the cosmic\naverage in the absence of voids. Phenomenologically, this means that the DR\nsmoothness parameter (denoted here by $\\alpha_E$) can be greater than unity,\nand, therefore, all previous analyses constraining it should be rediscussed\nwith a free upper limit. Accordingly, by performing a statistical analysis\ninvolving 557 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from Union2 compilation data in a\nflat $\\Lambda$CDM model we obtain for the extended parameter,\n$\\alpha_E=1.26^{+0.68}_{-0.54}$ ($1\\sigma$).

Rather than\nbeing confined within the circularizing radius, the disk can spread to larger\nradii to conserve angular momentum. A spreading disk is a source of matter for\nre-accretion at rates which can exceed the later stellar fallback rate,\nalthough a disk wind can suppress its contribution to the central black hole\naccretion rate. A spreading disk is detectible through a break in the central\naccretion rate history, or, at longer wavelengths, by its own emission. We\nmodel the evolution of TDE disk size and accretion rate, by accounting for the\ntime-dependent fallback rate, for the influence of wind losses in the early,\nadvective stage, and for the possibility of thermal instability for accretion\nrates intermediate between the advection-dominated and gas-pressure dominated\nstates. The model provides a dynamic basis for modeling TDE light curves. All\nor part of a young TDE disk will precess as a solid body due to Lense-Thirring\neffect, and precession may manifest itself as quasi-periodic modulation of\nlight curve. The precession period increases with time. Applying our results to\nthe jetted TDE candidate Swift J1644+57, whose X-ray light curve shows numerous\nquasi-periodic dips, we argue that the data best fit a scenario in which a\nmain-sequence star was fully disrupted by an intermediate mass black hole on an\norbit significantly inclined from the black hole equator, with the apparent jet\nshutoff at t= 500 d corresponding to a disk transition from the advective state\nto the gas-pressure dominated state.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 11 figures, 2 appendices, accepted for ApJ"]}]

These processes describe the evolution of\na system of Brownian particles moving on the real line with piecewise constant\ndrifts, and are the natural generalization of the rank-based diffusion\nprocesses introduced in stochastic portfolio theory or in the probabilistic\ninterpretation of nonlinear evolution equations. Owing to the discontinuity of\nthe drift coefficient, the corresponding ordinary differential equations are\nill-posed. Therefore, the small noise limit of order-based diffusion processes\nis not covered by the classical Freidlin-Wentzell theory. The description of\nthis limit is the purpose of this article. We first give a complete analysis of\nthe two-particle case. Despite its apparent simplicity, the small noise limit\nof such a system already exhibits various behaviours. In particular, depending\non the drift coefficient, the particles can either stick into a cluster, the\nvelocity of which is determined by elementary computations, or drift away from\neach other at constant velocity, in a random ordering. The persistence of\nrandomness in the zero noise limit is of the very same nature as in the\npioneering works by Veretennikov (Mat.

In the\ngeneral case of order-based processes, we give a sufficient condition on the\ndrift for all the particles to aggregate into a single cluster, and compute the\nvelocity of this cluster. Our argument consists in turning the study of the\nsmall noise limit into the study of the long time behaviour of a suitably\nrescaled process, and then exhibiting a Lyapunov functional for this rescaled\nprocess.\n"]}]

The corresponding subspace clustering problem has been extensively\nstudied in the literature to partition such high-dimensional data into clusters\ncorresponding to their underlying low-dimensional subspaces. However,\nlow-dimensional intrinsic structures are often violated for real-world\nobservations, as they can be corrupted by errors or deviate from ideal models.\nWe propose to address this by learning a linear transformation on subspaces\nusing matrix rank, via its convex surrogate nuclear norm, as the optimization\ncriteria. The learned linear transformation restores a low-rank structure for\ndata from the same subspace, and, at the same time, forces a a maximally\nseparated structure for data from different subspaces. In this way, we reduce\nvariations within subspaces, and increase separation between subspaces for a\nmore robust subspace clustering. This proposed learned robust subspace\nclustering framework significantly enhances the performance of existing\nsubspace clustering methods. Basic theoretical results here presented help to\nfurther support the underlying framework. To exploit the low-rank structures of\nthe transformed subspaces, we further introduce a fast subspace clustering\ntechnique, which efficiently combines robust PCA with sparse modeling.

Those with a more massive\ncomponent filling the Roche lobe are SD1 binaries whereas in SD2 binaries the\nRoche lobe filling component is less massive. Our evolutionary model assumes\nthat, following the Roche lobe overflow by the more massive component (donor),\nmass transfer occurs until mass ratio reversal. A binary in an initial phase of\nmass transfer, before mass equalization, is identified with SD1 binary. We show\nthat the transferred mass forms an equatorial bulge around the less massive\ncomponent (accretor). Its presence slows down the mass transfer rate to the\nvalue determined by the thermal time scale of the accretor, once the bulge\nsticks out above the Roche lobe. It means, that in a binary with a (typical)\nmass ratio of 0.5 the SD1 phase lasts at least 10 times longer than resulting\nfrom the standard evolutionary computations neglecting this effect. This is why\nwe observe so many SD1 binaries. Our explanation is in contradiction to\npredictions identifying the SD1 phase with a broken contact phase of the\nThermal Relaxation Oscillations model. The continued mass transfer, past mass\nequalization, results in mass ratio reversed. SD2 binaries are identified with\nthis phase. Our model predicts that the time scales of SD1 and SD2 phases are\ncomparable to one another. Analysis of the observations of 22 SD1 binaries, 27\nSD2 binaries and 110 contact binaries (CBs) shows that relative number of both\ntypes of NCBs favors similar time scales of both phases of mass transfer. Total\nmasses, orbital angular momenta and orbital periods of SD1 and SD2 binaries are\nindistinguishable from each other whereas they differ substantially from the\ncorresponding parameters of CBs. We conclude that the results of the analysis\nfully support the model presented in this paper.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 7 figures"]}]
