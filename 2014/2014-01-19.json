In this workshop we will explore how statistical modelling of\nscholarship, such as Bradfordizing or network analysis of coauthorship network,\ncan improve retrieval services for specific communities, as well as for large,\ncross-domain collections. This workshop aims to raise awareness of the missing\nlink between information retrieval (IR) and bibliometrics/scientometrics and to\ncreate a common ground for the incorporation of bibliometric-enhanced services\ninto retrieval at the digital library interface.\n","Comment: 6 pages, accepted workshop proposal for ECIR 2014"]}]
