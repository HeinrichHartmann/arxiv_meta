Recently, Gezari et al. reported a discovery of a\nnew class of tidal disruption events: the disruption of a helium-rich stellar\ncore, thought to be a remnant of a red giant (RG) star. Motivated by this\ndiscovery and in anticipation of others, we consider tidal interaction of an RG\nstar with a supermassive black hole (SMBH) which leads to the stripping of the\nstellar envelope and subsequent inspiral of the compact core toward the black\nhole. Once the stellar envelope is removed the inspiral of the core is driven\nby tidal heating as well as the emission of gravitational radiation until the\ncore either falls into the SMBH or is tidally disrupted. In the case of tidal\ndisruption candidate PS1-10jh we find that there is a set of orbital solutions\nat high eccentricities in which the tidally stripped hydrogen envelope is\naccreted by the SMBH before the helium core is disrupted. This places the RG\ncore in a portion of parameter space where strong tidal heating can lift the\ndegeneracy of the compact remnant and disrupt it before it reaches the tidal\nradius. We consider how this sequence of events explains the puzzling absence\nof the hydrogen emission lines from the spectrum of PS1-10jh and gives rise to\nits other observational features.\n","Comment: Revised version accepted for publication in ApJ, 788, 99 (12 pages, 2\n  figures)"]}]

We propose a user selection\nalgorithm achieving sum rate close to that of optimal solution. The algorithm\nemploys coordinate ascent approach and exploits orthogonality between the\ndesired signal space and the interference channel space in the reciprocal\nsystem to select the user at each step. For the sake of completeness, we have\nalso extended the sum rate approach based algorithm to Interfering broadcast\nchannel.

Despite the diversity of topic\nmodeling algorithms that have been proposed, a common challenge in successfully\napplying these techniques is the selection of an appropriate number of topics\nfor a given corpus. Choosing too few topics will produce results that are\noverly broad, while choosing too many will result in the \"over-clustering\" of a\ncorpus into many small, highly-similar topics. In this paper, we propose a\nterm-centric stability analysis strategy to address this issue, the idea being\nthat a model with an appropriate number of topics will be more robust to\nperturbations in the data. Using a topic modeling approach based on matrix\nfactorization, evaluations performed on a range of corpora show that this\nstrategy can successfully guide the model selection process.\n","Comment: Improve readability of plots.

As one important observational\nproperty for galaxies at ultraviolet and infrared wavelength bands, the\ncorrelation between infrared-to-ultraviolet luminosity ratio and ultraviolet\ncolor index (or ultraviolet spectral slope), i.e., the IRX-UV relation (or\nIRX-beta relation), offered a widely used recipe for correcting dust\nattenuation in galaxies, but the usability appears to be in doubt now because\nof considerable dispersion in this relation found by many studies. In this\npaper, on the basis of spectral synthesis modeling and spatially resolved\nmeasurements of four nearby spiral galaxies, we provide an interpretation of\nthe deviation in the IRX-UV relation with variations in the attenuation law.\nFrom both theoretical and observational viewpoints, two components in the\nattenuation curve, the linear background and the 2175 Angstrom bump, are\nsuggested to be the parameters in addition to the stellar population age\n(addressed in the first paper of this series) in the IRX-UV function; different\nfeatures in the attenuation curve are diagnosed for the galaxies in our sample.\nNevertheless, it is often difficult to ascertain the attenuation law for\ngalaxies in actual observations. Possible reasons for preventing the successful\ndetection of the parameters in the attenuation curve are also discussed in this\npaper, including the degeneracy of the linear background and the 2175 Angstrom\nbump in observational channels, the requirement for young and dust-rich systems\nto study, and the difficulty in accurate estimates of dust attenuations at\ndifferent wavelength bands.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 23 figures, 5 tables; accepted for publication in The\n  Astrophysical Journal"]}]
