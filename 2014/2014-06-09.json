Using a series of direct $N$-body\nsimulations, we investigate the dynamical evolution of star clusters with mass\nfunctions, especially their core collapse time. Multi-mass clusters tend to\nbehave like systems with a smaller number of particles, which we call the\neffective number of particles ($N_{eff}$) and for which $N_{eff} = M/m_{max}$\n(here $M$ and $m_{max}$ are the total cluster mass and the mass of the most\nmassive star in the cluster, respectively). We find that the time of core\ncollapse is inversely proportional to the mass of the most massive star in the\ncluster and analytically confirm that this is because the core collapse of\nclusters with a mass function proceeds on the dynamical friction timescale of\nthe most massive stars. As the mass of the most massive star increases,\nhowever, the core-collapse time, which is observed as a core bounce of the\ncluster core from the evolution of the core density or core radius, becomes\nambiguous. We find that in that case the total binding energy of the hard\nbinaries gives a good diagnosis for determining the moment of core collapses.\nBased on the results of our simulations, we argue that the core bounce becomes\nambiguous when the mass of the most massive star exceeds 0.1\\% of the total\nmass of the cluster.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 11 figures, accepted for MNRAS"]}]

In this paper we extend this analysis to the\ncase of non-axisymmetric disturbances, relevant to real ships. We find that,\nfor intermediate Froude numbers, the wake angle follows an intermediate scaling\nlaw $\\alpha \\simeq Fr_L^{-2}$, in agreement with the recent prediction of\nNoblesse \\textit{et al.} [Eur.

Moving to a high-dimensional state space in QKD allows one\nto impress more information on each photon, as well as introduce higher levels\nof security.

We argue that useful prototypes\nof this dynamics come from D-brane constructions of string theory. Using a\nspecific example of that kind, we identify the mechanism by which a strongly\ncoupled Fermi superfluid relaxes to equilibrium; it involves a wave of\nexcitation in the momentum space, propagating from the Fermi surface towards\nthe ultraviolet. For a sudden quench induced by a change in the fermion\ncoupling, we find that the relaxation occurs rapidly, over only a few\noscillations of the quasiparticle gap.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures"]}]

A growing literature,\nhowever, suggests that people do not quite behave like standard economic agents\nin a variety of environments, both online and offline. What consequences might\nsuch differences have for the optimal design of mechanisms in these\nenvironments? In this paper, we explore this question in the context of optimal\ncontest design for simple agents---agents who strategically reason about\nwhether or not to participate in a system, but not about the input they provide\nto it. Specifically, consider a contest where $n$ potential contestants with\ntypes $(q_i,c_i)$ each choose between participating and producing a submission\nof quality $q_i$ at cost $c_i$, versus not participating at all, to maximize\ntheir utilities. How should a principal distribute a total prize $V$ amongst\nthe $n$ ranks to maximize some increasing function of the qualities of elicited\nsubmissions in a contest with such simple agents?\n  We first solve the optimal contest design problem for settings with\nhomogenous participation costs $c_i = c$. Here, the optimal contest is always a\nsimple contest, awarding equal prizes to the top $j^*$ contestants for a\nsuitable choice of $j^*$. (In comparable models with strategic effort choices,\nthe optimal contest is either a winner-take-all contest or awards possibly\nunequal prizes, depending on the curvature of agents' effort cost functions.)\nWe next address the general case with heterogeneous costs where agents' types\nare inherently two-dimensional, significantly complicating equilibrium\nanalysis. Our main result here is that the winner-take-all contest is a\n3-approximation of the optimal contest when the principal's objective is to\nmaximize the quality of the best elicited contribution.\n","Comment: This is the full version of a paper in the ACM Conference on\n  Economics and Computation (ACM-EC), 2014"]}]
