The proposed method of Bayesian Structural Inference (BSI)\nrelies on a set of candidate unifilar HMM (uHMM) topologies for inference of\nprocess structure from a data series. We employ a recently developed exact\nenumeration of topological epsilon-machines. (A sequel then removes the\ntopological restriction.) This subset of the uHMM topologies has the added\nbenefit that inferred models are guaranteed to be epsilon-machines,\nirrespective of estimated transition probabilities. Properties of\nepsilon-machines and uHMMs allow for the derivation of analytic expressions for\nestimating transition probabilities, inferring start states, and comparing the\nposterior probability of candidate model topologies, despite process internal\nstructure being only indirectly present in data. We demonstrate BSI's\neffectiveness in estimating a process's randomness, as reflected by the Shannon\nentropy rate, and its structure, as quantified by the statistical complexity.\nWe also compare using the posterior distribution over candidate models and the\nsingle, maximum a posteriori model for point estimation and show that the\nformer more accurately reflects uncertainty in estimated values.

To gain insight into this process we conducted a\nsurvey among nearly three hundred (N= 288) humanities scholars in the\nNetherlands and Belgium with the aim of finding answers to the following\nquestions: 1) To what extent are digital databases and archives used? 2) What\nare the preferences in search functionalities 3) Are there differences in\nsearch strategies between novices and experts of information retrieval? Our\nresults show that while scholars actively engage in research online they mainly\nsearch for text and images. General search systems such as Google and JSTOR are\npredominant, while large-scale collections such as Europeana are rarely\nconsulted. Searching with keywords is the dominant search strategy and advanced\nsearch options are rarely used. When comparing novice and more experienced\nsearchers, the first tend to have a more narrow selection of search engines,\nand mostly use keywords. Our overall findings indicate that Google is the key\nplayer among available search engines. This dominant use illustrates the\nparadoxical attitude of scholars toward Google: while provenance and context\nare deemed key academic requirements, the workings of the Google algorithm\nremain unclear.

We numerically solve the $N$-body\nLangevin equations and the stochastic Smoluchowski-Poisson system which takes\nfluctuations (finite $N$ effects) into account. The system switches back and\nforth between the two metastable states (bistability) and the particles\naccumulate successively at the center or at the boundary of the domain. We show\nthat these random transitions exhibit the phenomenology of the ordinary Kramers\nproblem for a Brownian particle in a double-well potential. The distribution of\nthe residence time is Poissonian and the average lifetime of a metastable state\nis given by the Arrhenius law, i.e. it is proportional to the exponential of\nthe barrier of free energy $\\Delta F$ divided by $k_B T$. Since the free energy\nis proportional to the number of particles $N$ for a system with long-range\ninteractions, the lifetime of metastable states scales as $e^N$ and is\nconsiderable for $N\\gg 1$. As a result, in many applications, metastable states\nof systems with long-range interactions can be considered as stable states.\nHowever, for moderate values of $N$, or close to a critical point $T_c$, the\nlifetime of the metastable states is reduced since the barrier of free energy\ndecreases. In that case, the fluctuations become important and the mean field\napproximation is no more valid. This is the situation considered in this paper.\nBy an appropriate change of notations, our results also apply to bacterial\npopulations experiencing chemotaxis in biology.

The growth of over densities is very well described by perturbation\ntheory at that epoch and the signal can in principle be predicted to arbitrary\naccuracy for given cosmological parameters. Recently, Tseliakhovich and Hirata\npointed out a previously neglected and important physical effect, due to the\nfact that baryons and cold dark matter (CDM) have supersonic relative\nvelocities after recombination. This relative velocity suppresses the growth of\nmatter fluctuations on scales $k \\sim 10-10^3$ Mpc$^{-1}$. In addition, the\namplitude of the small-scale power spectrum is modulated on the large scales\nover which the relative velocity varies, corresponding to $k \\sim 0.005-1$\nMpc$^{-1}$. In this paper, the effect of the relative velocity on 21 cm\nbrightness temperature fluctuations from redshifts $z \\geq 30$ is computed. We\nshow that the 21 cm power spectrum is affected on ${\\it most}$ scales. On small\nscales, the signal is typically suppressed several tens of percent, except for\nextremely small scales ($k \\gtrsim 2000$ Mpc$^{-1}$) for which the fluctuations\nare boosted by resonant excitation of acoustic waves. On large scales, 21 cm\nfluctuations are enhanced due to the non-linear dependence of the brightness\ntemperature on the underlying gas density and temperature. The enhancement of\nthe 21 cm power spectrum is of a few percent at $k \\sim 0.1$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and up\nto tens of percent at $k \\lesssim 0.005$ Mpc$^{-1}$, for standard $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmology.

Quantum indistinguishability (symmetrization) of the\ncollectivities leads to topological degeneracy in the subspace of elementary\nexcitations, giving rise to non-Abelian braiding statistics. The non-Abelian\nhidden order of a symmetrized structure is manifested in its entanglement\nproperties, and the corresponding non-Abelian fusion and braiding rules can be\nderived by analyzing the set of symmetrized states on a surface with\nnon-trivial topology like a torus. To illustrate the emergence of non-Abelian\nstatistics from symmetrization, I consider the case of two identical copies of\nthe toric code model. The resulting model is shown to be non-Abelian,\nexhibiting two types (charge and flux) of quasiparticles with non trivial\nfusion channels. The symmetrization construction I present here constitutes a\nframework for the generation of non-Abelian models from known Abelian ones.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 12 figures, explanations added, figure added, typos\n  corrected"]}]

Voc2WordNet is evaluated against a\nsample of human-generated alignments with the OpenStreetMap (OSM) Semantic\nNetwork, a crowdsourced geospatial resource, and the GeoNames ontology, the\nvocabulary of a large digital gazetteer.

One of the most\ncelebrated equations that allows unphysical solutions is the relativistic\nMajorana equation\\cite{Majorana} which might describe neutrinos and other\nexotic particles beyond the Standard Model.

The GIBCs in the time domain are heuristically\nderived from the corresponding conditions in the time harmonic regime. The\nlatters are frequency dependent except the one of order 0; hence the formers\nare non-local in time in general. The error estimates in the time regime can be\nderived from the ones in the time harmonic regime when the frequency dependence\nis well-controlled.
