It is well known that there is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between such an entropy vector and a certain\ngroup-characterizable vector obtained from a finite group and $n$ of its\nsubgroups [3]. This correspondence may be useful for characterizing the space\nof entropic vectors and for designing network codes.

This is an\nexplanation for the fact shown by Dougherty et al [4] that linear network codes\ncannot achieve capacity in general network coding problems. All abelian\ngroup-characterizable vectors, and by fiat all entropy vectors generated by\nlinear network codes, satisfy a linear inequality called the Ingleton\ninequality. It is therefore of interest to identify groups that violate the\nIngleton inequality. In this paper, we study the problem of finding nonabelian\nfinite groups that yield characterizable vectors which violate the Ingleton\ninequality. Using a refined computer search, we find the symmetric group $S_5$\nto be the smallest group that violates the Ingleton inequality. Careful study\nof the structure of this group, and its subgroups, reveals that it belongs to\nthe Ingleton-violating family $PGL(2,q)$ with a prime power $q \\geq 5$, i.e.,\nthe projective group of $2\\times 2$ nonsingular matrices with entries in\n$\\mathbb{F}_q$. We further interpret this family using the theory of group\nactions. We also extend the construction to more general groups such as\n$PGL(n,q)$ and $GL(n,q)$.

However, one of the\noverlooked benefits of co-clustering is that, it can be used to extract\nmeaningful knowledge for various other knowledge extraction purposes. For\nexample, building predictive models with high dimensional data and\nheterogeneous population is a non-trivial task. Co-clusters extracted from such\ndata, which shows similar pattern in both the dimension, can be used for a more\naccurate predictive model building. Several applications such as finding\npatient-disease cohorts in health care analysis, finding user-genre groups in\nrecommendation systems and community detection problems can benefit from\nco-clustering technique that utilizes the predictive power of the data to\ngenerate co-clusters for improved data analysis.\n  In this paper, we present the novel idea of Predictive Overlapping\nCo-Clustering (POCC) as an optimization problem for a more effective and\nimproved predictive analysis. Our algorithm generates optimal co-clusters by\nmaximizing predictive power of the co-clusters subject to the constraints on\nthe number of row and column clusters. In this paper precision, recall and\nf-measure have been used as evaluation measures of the resulting co-clusters.\nResults of our algorithm has been compared with two other well-known techniques\n- K-means and Spectral co-clustering, over four real data set namely, Leukemia,\nInternet-Ads, Ovarian cancer and MovieLens data set. The results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and utility of our algorithm POCC in practice.\n","Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the authors due to a crucial sign\n  error in objective function"]}]

For this class of problems, one may apply the directly extended ADMM to\ntheir dual, which can be written in the form of convex programming with four\nseparable blocks in the objective function and a coupling linear equation\nconstraint. Indeed, the directly extended ADMM, though may diverge in theory,\noften performs much better numerically than many of its variants with\ntheoretical convergence guarantee. Ideally, one should find a convergent\nvariant which is at least as efficient as the directly extended ADMM in\npractice. We achieve this goal by designing a convergent semi-proximal ADMM\n(called sPADMM3c for convenience) for convex programming problems having three\nseparable blocks in the objective function with the third part being linear.

Understanding the variability of those deep\ncurrents is crucial to improve the forecast of geomagnetic field variations,\nwhich affect human spacial and aeronautic activities. Moreover, it may provide\nrelevant information on the core dynamics. The main goal of this study is to\nextract and characterize the leading variability modes of core flows over\ncentennial periods, and to assess their statistical robustness. To this end, we\nuse flows that we invert from two geomagnetic field models (gufm1 and COV-OBS),\nand apply Principal Component Analysis and Singular Value Decomposition of\ncoupled fields. The quasi geostrophic (QG) flows inverted from both geomagnetic\nfield models show similar features. However, COV-OBS has a less energetic mean\nand larger time variability. The statistical significance of flow components is\ntested from analyses performed on subareas of the whole domain. Bootstrapping\nmethods are also used to extract significant flow features required by both\ngufm1 and COV-OBS. Three main empirical circulation modes emerge,\nsimultaneously constrained by both geomagnetic field models and expected to be\nrobust against the particular a priori used to build them (large scale QG\ndynamics). Mode 1 exhibits three large vortices at medium/high latitudes, with\nopposite circulation under the Atlantic and the Pacific hemispheres. Mode 2\ninterestingly accounts for most of the variations of the Earth's core angular\nmomentum. In this mode, the regions close to the tangent cylinder and to the\nequator are correlated, and oscillate with a period between 80 and 90 years.\nEach of these two modes is energetic enough to alter the mean flow, sometimes\nreinforcing the eccentric gyre, and other times breaking it up into smaller\ncirculations. The three main circulation modes added together to the mean flow\naccount for about 70% of the flows variability, 90% of the root mean square\ntotal velocities, and 95% of the secular variation induced by the total flows.\nDirect physical interpretation of the computed modes is not straightforward.\nNonethe-less, similarities found between the two first modes and time/spatial\nfeatures identified in different studies of core dynamics, suggest that our\napproach can help to pinpoint the relevant physical processes inside the core\non centennial timescales.\n","Comment: 33 pages"]}]

In particular, for each patch in the novel\ndesired view, we seek surrogates from the observed view of the given image.

A key component of these methods is the differential geometry\nof surfaces theory, as applied to the solvent-solute boundary. In these\napproaches, the solvent-solute boundary is determined by a variational\nprinciple that determines the major physical observables of interest, for\nexample, biomolecular surface area, enclosed volume, electrostatic potential,\nion density, electron density, etc. Recently, differential geometry theory has\nbeen used to define the surfaces that separate the microscopic (solute) domains\nfor biomolecules from the macroscopic (solvent) domains. In these approaches,\nthe microscopic domains are modeled with atomistic or quantum mechanical\ndescriptions, while continuum mechanics models (including fluid mechanics,\nelastic mechanics, and continuum electrostatics) are applied to the macroscopic\ndomains. This multiphysics description is integrated through an energy\nfunctional formalism and the resulting Euler-Lagrange equation is employed to\nderive a variety of governing partial differential equations for different\nsolvation and transport processes; e.g., the Laplace-Beltrami equation for the\nsolvent-solute interface, Poisson or Poisson-Boltzmann equations for\nelectrostatic potentials, the Nernst-Planck equation for ion densities, and the\nKohn-Sham equation for solute electron density. Extensive validation of these\nmodels has been carried out over hundreds of molecules, including proteins and\nion channels, and the experimental data have been compared in terms of\nsolvation energies, voltage-current curves, and density distributions.

In contrast the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)\ntheory gives a clear guide for achieving high Tc: it should be a favorable\ncombination of high frequency phonons, strong coupling between electrons and\nphonons, and high density of states. These conditions can be fulfilled for\nmetallic hydrogen and covalent hydrogen dominant compounds.

The first is characterized by approximately 5.5\nmonths of relatively stable evolution in radio flux density, rotation, and\nprofile shape, while in the second these properties varied substantially.\nSpecifically, a third profile component emerged and the radio flux increased on\naverage, but also became more variable. Bright single pulses are visible and\nare well described by a log-normal energy distribution at low to moderate\nenergies, but with an excess at high energies. The 2-10 keV flux has decayed\nsteadily since the initial X-ray outburst, in contrast with the radio flux. Our\ntiming analysis includes Green Bank Telescope, Swift, and NuSTAR data.
