The model yields good fits of the UV and Lyman-alpha LFs at\nz>~2. The weak evolution of both LFs between z=2 and z=6 is explained as the\ncombined effect of the negative evolution of the halo mass function, of the\nincrease with redshift of the star formation efficiency, and of dust\nextinction. The slope of the faint end of the UV LF is found to steepen with\nincreasing redshift, implying that low luminosity galaxies increasingly\ndominate the contribution to the UV background at higher and higher redshifts.\nThe observed range of UV luminosities at high-z implies a minimum halo mass\ncapable of hosting active star formation M_crit <~ 10^9.8 M_odot, consistent\nwith the constraints from hydrodynamical simulations. From fits of Lyman-alpha\nLFs plus data on the luminosity dependence of extinction and from the measured\nratios of non-ionizing UV to Lyman-continuum flux density for samples of z=~3\nLyman break galaxies and Lyman-alpha emitters, we derive a simple relationship\nbetween the escape fraction of ionizing photons and the star formation rate,\nimpling larger escape fraction for less massive galaxies.

As Ca occupies sites\noutside but near the Cu-O-Cu spin chains, bond disorder, i.e. a spatial\nvariation of the exchange interaction $J$, is expected to be realized in these\nchains. We observe that the magnetic heat conductivity\n($\\kappa_{\\mathrm{mag}}$) due to spinons propagating in the chains is gradually\nbut strongly suppressed with increasing amount of Ca, where the doping\ndependence can be understood in terms of increased scattering of spinons due to\nCa-induced disorder. This is also reflected in the spinon mean free path which\ncan be separated in a doping independent but temperature dependent scattering\nlength due to spinon-phonon scattering, and a temperature independent but\ndoping dependent spinon-defect scattering length. The latter spans from very\nlarge ($>$ 1300 lattice spacings) to very short ($\\sim$ 12 lattice spacings)\nand scales with the average distance between two neighboring Ca atoms. Thus,\nthe Ca-induced disorder acts as an effective defect within the spin chain, and\nthe doping scheme allows to cover the whole doping regime between the clean and\nthe dirty limits.

The 35-year ACRIM TSI satellite composite was updated using\ncorrections to ACRIMSAT/ACRIM3 results derived from recent testing at the\nLaboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics/Total solar irradiance Radiometer\nFacility (LASP/TRF). The corrections lower the ACRIM3 scale by ~5000 ppm, in\nclose agreement with the scale of SORCE/TIM results (solar constant ~1361\nW/m^2). Relative variations and trends are not changed. Differences between the\nACRIM and PMOD TSI composites, e.g. the decadal trending during solar cycles\n21-22, are tested against a set of solar proxy models, including analysis of\nNimbus7/ERB and ERBS/ERBE results available to bridge the ACRIM Gap\n(1989-1992). Our findings confirm: (1) The validity of the TSI peak in the\noriginally published ERB results in early 1979 during solar cycle 21; (2) The\ncorrectness of originally published ACRIM1 results during the SMM spin mode\n(1981-1984); (3) The upward trend of originally published ERB results during\nthe ACRIM Gap; (4) The occurrence of a significant upward TSI trend between the\nminima of solar cycles 21 and 22 and (5) a decreasing trend during solar cycles\n22-23. Our findings do not support: (1) The downward corrections to originally\npublished ERB and ACRIM1 results during solar cycle 21; (2) A step function\nsensitivity change in ERB results at the end-of-September 1989; (3) the\nvalidity of ERBE's downward trend during the ACRIM Gap or (4) the use of ERBE\nresults to bridge the ACRIM Gap. Our analysis provides a first order validation\nof the ACRIM TSI composite approach and its 0.037%/decade upward trend during\nsolar cycles 21-22. Thus, solar forcing of climate change may be a\nsignificantly larger factor than represented in the CMIP5 general circulation\nclimate models.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 15 figures"]}]

This\nparadox has become an obstacle or a reversed touchstone for any possible theory\nto unify the gravity and quantum mechanics. Based on the results from Hawking\nradiation as tunneling, we recently show that Hawking radiations can carry off\nall information about the collapsed matter in a black hole. After discovering\nthe existence of information-carrying correlation, we show in great detail that\nentropy is conserved for Hawking radiation based on standard probability theory\nand statistics. We claim that information previously considered lost remains\nhidden inside Hawking radiation. More specifically, it is encoded into\ncorrelations between Hawking radiations. Our study thus establishes harmony\nbetween Harking radiation and the unitarity of quantum mechanics, which\nestablishes the basis for a significant milestone towards resolving the\nlong-standing information loss paradox. The paper provides a brief review of\nthe exciting development on Hawking raidation. In addition to summarize our own\nwork on this subject, we compare and address other related studies.\n"]}]

Although\nevaluating the importance of objects has been well studied in homogeneous\nnetworks, it is not yet exploited in heterogeneous networks. In this paper, we\nstudy the ranking problem in heterogeneous networks and propose the HRank\nframework to evaluate the importance of multiple types of objects and meta\npaths. Since the importance of objects depends upon the meta paths in\nheterogeneous networks, HRank develops a path based random walk process.\nMoreover, a constrained meta path is proposed to subtly capture the rich\nsemantics in heterogeneous networks. Furthermore, HRank can simultaneously\ndetermine the importance of objects and meta paths through applying the tensor\nanalysis. Extensive experiments on three real datasets show that HRank can\neffectively evaluate the importance of objects and paths together.

Since Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) planning portrays information about the world and reasons to\nsolve some of world's problems, Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning has\nbeen introduced almost 40 years ago to represent and deal with hierarchies. Its\nrequirement for rich domain knowledge to characterise the world enables HTN\nplanning to be very useful, but also to perform well. However, the history of\nalmost 40 years obfuscates the current understanding of HTN planning in terms\nof accomplishments, planning models, similarities and differences among\nhierarchical planners, and its current and objective image.

First, we provide a basis\nfor defining different formal models of hierarchical planning, and define two\nmodels that comprise a large portion of HTN planners.

We use the survey derived\nradial velocities, stellar atmospheric parameters, metallicity, and elemental\nabundances for stars targeted as potential members of this cluster to carry out\nan analysis of cluster properties. The radial velocity distribution of stars in\nthe cluster field is used to define the cluster systemic velocity and derive\nlikely cluster membership for stars observed by the Gaia-ESO Survey. We\ninvestigate the distributions of Fe and Fe-peak elements, alpha-elements, and\nthe light elements Na and Al and characterize the cluster's internal chemical\nhomogeneity comparing it to the properties of radial velocity non-member stars.\nUtilizing these cluster properties, the cluster color-magnitude diagram is\nanalyzed and theoretical isochrones are fit to derive cluster reddening,\ndistance, and age. NGC 4815 is found to have a mean [Fe/H]=+0.03. Elemental\nabundances of cluster members show typically small internal variation, with\ninternal dispersions of ~0.05 dex. [Ca/Fe] and [Si/Fe] show solar ratios, but\n[Mg/Fe] is moderately enhanced, while [Ti/Fe] appears slightly deficient.
