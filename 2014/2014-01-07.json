In contrast to a \\emph{treelike} NetONet in which\nthe size of the largest connected cluster (mutual component) depends on $n$,\nthe loops in the RR NetONet cause the largest connected cluster to depend only\non $m$. We also analyzed the extremely vulnerable feedback condition of\ncoupling. In the case of ER networks, the NetONet only exhibits two phases, a\nsecond order phase transition and collapse, and there is no first phase\ntransition regime unlike the no feedback condition. In the case of NetONet\ncomposed of RR networks, there exists a first order phase transition when $q$\nis large and second order phase transition when $q$ is small.

We report detailed analyses of the resonance lines, which\nfully resolve the cyclotron mass structure of the main Fermi surface sheets. A\nparticular focus is given to the anomalous splitting of the sharpest resonance\nline near the [110] direction under in-plane magnetic-field rotation, which\nimplies peculiar electronic structure in the hidden order phase. The results\nunder the field rotation from [110] toward [001] direction reveal that the\nsplitting is a robust feature against field tilting from the basal plane. This\nis in sharp contrast to the reported frequency branch alpha in the quantum\noscillation experiments showing a three-fold splitting that disappears by a\nsmall field tilt, which can be explained by the magnetic breakdown between the\nlarge hole sphere and small electron pockets. Our analysis of the cyclotron\nresonance profiles reveals that the heavier branch of the split line has a\nlarger scattering rate, providing evidence for the existence of hot-spot\nregions along the [110] direction. These results are consistent with the broken\nfourfold rotational symmetry in the hidden-order phase, which can modify the\ninterband scattering in an asymmetric manner. We also extend our measurements\ndown to 0.7 K, which results in the observation of cyclotron resonance in the\nsuperconducting state, where novel effects of vortex dynamics may enter. We\nfind that the cyclotron mass undergoes no change in the superconducting state.\nIn contrast, the quasiparticle scattering rate shows a rapid decrease below the\nvortex-lattice melting transition temperature, which supports the formation of\nquasiparticle Bloch state in the vortex lattice phase.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 12 figures"]}]

Can we extend the existing\nresults on type structured populations, to models of populations structured by\ntype and space, considering diffusion and nonlocal competition between\nindividuals? We study a nonlocal competitive Lotka-Volterra type system,\ndescribing a spatially structured population which can be either monomorphic or\ndimorphic. Considering spatial diffusion, intrinsic death and birth rates,\ntogether with death rates due to intraspecific and interspecific competition\nbetween the individuals, leading to some integral terms, we analyze the long\ntime behavior of the solutions. We first prove existence of steady states and\nnext determine the long time limits, depending on the competition rates and the\nprincipal eigenvalues of some operators, corresponding somehow to the strength\nof traits.

A crucial aspect of the\ndesign of a WSN is the minimization of the overall energy consumption. Previous\nresearchers aim at optimizing the energy spent for the communication, while\nmostly ignoring the energy cost due to sensing. Recently, it has been shown\nthat considering the sensing energy cost can be beneficial for further\nimproving the overall energy efficiency. More precisely, sparse sensing\ntechniques were proposed to reduce the amount of collected samples and recover\nthe missing data by using data statistics. While the majority of these\ntechniques use fixed or random sampling patterns, we propose to adaptively\nlearn the signal model from the measurements and use the model to schedule when\nand where to sample the physical field. The proposed method requires minimal\non-board computation, no inter-node communications and still achieves appealing\nreconstruction performance. With experiments on real-world datasets, we\ndemonstrate significant improvements over both traditional sensing schemes and\nthe state-of-the-art sparse sensing schemes, particularly when the measured\ndata is characterized by a strong intra-sensor (temporal) or inter-sensors\n(spatial) correlation.\n","Comment: Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications"]}]
