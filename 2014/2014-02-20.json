We examine how the\ncross-correlation of the 21 cm brightness and the CMB Doppler fluctuations on\nlarge angular scales can be used to study this epoch. We employ a new model of\nthe growth of large scale fluctuations of the ionized fraction as reionization\nproceeds. We take into account the peculiar velocity field of baryons and show\nthat its effect on the cross correlation can be interpreted as a mixing of\nFourier modes. We find that the cross-correlation signal is strongly peaked\ntoward the end of reionization and that the sign of the correlation should be\npositive because of the inhomogeneity inherent to reionization. The signal\npeaks at degree scales (l~100) and comes almost entirely from large physical\nscales (k~0.01 Mpc). Since many of the foregrounds and noise that plague low\nfrequency radio observations will not correlate with CMB measurements, the\ncross correlation might appear to provide a robust diagnostic of the\ncosmological origin of the 21 cm radiation around the epoch of reionization.\nUnfortunately, we show that these signals are actually only weakly correlated\nand that cosmic variance dominates the error budget of any attempted detection.\nWe conclude that the detection of a cross-correlation peak at degree-size\nangular scales is unlikely even with ideal experiments.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 4 figures, submitted to MNRAS"]}]

In the case\nof non-frustrated ladders, we have followed the fate of both Berry phases when\ninterpolating between standard ladders and dimerized spin chains. A careful\ninvestigation of the spin gap and of edge states shows that a change of twist\nBerry phase is associated to a quantum phase transition at which the bulk gap\ncloses, and at which, with appropriate boundary conditions, edge states appear\nor disappear, while a change of rung Berry phase is not necessarily associated\nto a quantum phase transition. The difference is particularly acute for regular\nladders, in which the twist Berry phase does not change at all upon increasing\nthe rung coupling from zero to infinity while the rung Berry phase changes 2S\ntimes. By analogy with the fully frustrated ladder, these changes are\ninterpreted as cross-overs between domains in which the rungs are in different\nstates of total spin from 0 in the strong rung limit to 2S in the weak rung\nlimit. This interpretation is further supported by the observation that these\ncross-overs turn into real phase transitions as a function of rung coupling if\none rung is strongly ferromagnetic, or equivalently if one rung is replaced by\na spin 2S impurity.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 10 figures The second version has been entirely rewritten"]}]

This picture predicts that,\nin contrast to the well-known nonrelativistic regime, the ionized electron wave\npacket arises with a momentum shift along the laser's propagation direction.\nThis is compatible with results from a strong field approximation calculation\nwhere the binding potential is assumed to be zero-ranged. Further, the\ntunneling time delay, stemming from Wigner's definition, is investigated for\nmodel configurations of tunneling and compared with results obtained from the\nexact propagator. By adapting Wigner's time delay definition to the ionization\nprocess, the tunneling time is investigated in the deep-tunneling and in the\nnear-threshold-tunneling regimes.

More and more mobile phones with\nlarge touchscreen have been produced, however, the phones with small size\ndisplays are still in the majority of touch phones. The foremost interface on\ntouch smartphones is the information input module using soft keyboards.\nTraditional input methods on touch phones have either too small key buttons\n(such as QWERTY) or too many functions (such as 3$\\times$4 keyboard), which are\ninconvenient to use. Moreover, the conventional soft keyboards only use tapping\nto input texts while current touch smartphones allow various gestures on the\ntouchscreen, such as sliding. In this paper, a novel soft keyboard called QWERT\nis proposed for touchscreen-based smartphones. The users can interact with\nphones via finger gestures of tapping or sliding when input text by using the\nQWERT. In doing so, the interactions between users and smartphones will be\nfaster and easier. An experiment carried out on inexperienced human subjects\nshows that they can learn very fast due to their familiarities with QWERTY. A\nsimulation experiment based on a cognitive architecture, ACT-R, was also\nconducted to predict the movement time (MT) of experienced human subjects. The\nsimulation results show that the MT using QWERT outperforms other default\nkeyboards. These outcomes imply that the novel QWERT is a viable option for\ntouch smartphone users.

The studies are carried\nout in the context of Kitaev's honeycomb model, where we consider three\ndistinct types of perturbations in the presence of a lattice of Majorana mode\nbinding vortices -- spatial anisotropy of the vortices, dimerization of the\nvortex lattice and local random disorder. While all the nucleated phases are\nstable with respect to weak perturbations of each kind, strong perturbations\nare found to result in very different behavior. Anisotropy of the vortices\nstabilizes the strong-pairing like phases, while dimerization can recover the\nunderlying non-Abelian phase. Local random disorder, on the other hand, can\ndrive all the nucleated phases into a gapless thermal metal state. We show that\nall these distinct behavior can be captured by an effective staggered\ntight-binding model for the Majorana modes. By studying the pairwise\ninteractions between the vortices, i.e. the amplitudes for the Majorana modes\nto tunnel between vortex cores, the locations of phase transitions and the\nnature of the resulting states can be predicted. We also find that due to\noscillations in the Majorana tunneling amplitude, lattices of Majorana modes\nmay exhibit a Peierls-like instability, where a dimerized configuration is\nfavored over a uniform lattice. As the nature of the nucleated phases depends\nonly on the Majorana tunneling, our results apply also to other system\nsupporting localized Majorana mode arrays, such as Abrikosov lattices in p-wave\nsuperconductors, Wigner crystals in Moore-Read fractional quantum Hall states\nor arrays of topological nanowires.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 4 pages of appendices, 24 figures.

A common feature in the application of the\nCCM is to rotate the local spin axes of the (often classical) model state so\nthat (notationally only) the spins all appear to point in the downwards\n$z$-direction. Hitherto, we remark that only coplanar model states have been\nused because they do not lead to imaginary terms in the new Hamiltonian. By\ncontrast, non-coplanar \"three-dimensional\" (3D) model states can lead to\nimaginary terms in the new Hamiltonian after rotation. In principle, however,\nmacroscopic quantities predicted by the CCM (such as the ground-state energy\nand order parameter) should still be real (even though the Hamiltonian may be\ncomplex) because the transformations of local spin axes are unitary. Here we\nexplain how we may use such 3D model states for the CCM and how we may solve\nfor the (now possibly complex) CCM correlation coefficients. We present results\nfor the spin-half triangular-lattice antiferromagnet in an external magnetic\nfield. We use both coplanar model states and a single 3D non-coplanar model\nstate. We calculate the ground-state energy and the lattice magnetisation as a\nfunction of the magnetic field strength. We find that the energies of the\ncoplanar states lie lower than that of the non-coplanar state for all values of\nthe external field, as seen in other approximate studies for this model. We\nfind that the non-coplanar state does not detect the well-known spin plateau\noccurring in this model, although (as seen before) it is clearly observed for\nthe coplanar model states using the CCM. These results are an excellent initial\nvalidation of the new approach for the application of the CCM using 3D model\nstates.\n","Comment: 3 figures"]}]

The formalism for this is provided, generalizing the td-NRG to\nmultiple quantum quenches, periodic switching, and general pulses.

Here, we extend DARKexp N(E) to include the\ndistribution in angular momentum, L^2, for spherically symmetric systems.\nFirst, we argue, based on theoretical, semi-analytical, and simulation results,\nthat while dark-matter halos are relaxed in energy, they are not nearly as\nrelaxed in angular momentum, which precludes using maximum entropy to uniquely\nderive N(E,L^2). Instead, we require that when integrating N(E,L^2) over\nsquared angular momenta one retrieves the DARKexp N(E). Starting with a general\nexpression for N(E,L^2) we show how the distribution of particles in L^2 is\nrelated to the shape of the velocity distribution function, VDF, and velocity\nanisotropy profile, \\beta(r). We then demonstrate that astrophysically\nrealistic halos, as judged by the VDF shape and \\beta(r), must have linear or\nconvex distributions in L^2, for each separate energy bin. The distribution in\nenergy of the most bound particles must be nearly flat, and become more tilted\nin favor of radial orbits for less bound particles. These results are\nconsistent with numerical simulations and represent an important step towards\nderiving the full distribution function for spherically symmetric dark-matter\nhalos.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 10 figures, accepted to ApJ.

The outcome is more likely to be positive if nodes\nbelong to the same communities. For a given budget of node pair samples or\nobservations, we wish to jointly design a sampling strategy (the sequence of\nsampled node pairs) and a clustering algorithm that recover the hidden\ncommunities with the highest possible accuracy.
