For such channel we develop an achievable region based on a few novel\nconcepts: Precoded Compute and Forward (PCoF) with Channel Integer Alignment\n(CIA), combined with standard Dirty-Paper Coding. We also develop a capacity\nregion outer bound and find the sum symmetric GDoF of the Network-Coded CIC.\nThrough the GDoF characterization, we show that knowing \"mixed data\" (linear\ncombinations of the information messages) provides an unbounded spectral\nefficiency gain over the classical CIC counterpart, if the ratio of SNR to INR\nis larger than certain threshold. Then, we consider a Gaussian relay network\nhaving the two-user MIMO IC as the main building block. We use PCoF with CIA to\nconvert the MIMO IC into a deterministic finite-field IC. Then, we use a linear\nprecoding scheme over the finite-field to eliminate interference in the\nfinite-field domain. Using this unified approach, we characterize the symmetric\nsum rate of the two-user MIMO IC with coordination, cognition, and two-hops. We\nalso provide finite-SNR results which show that the proposed coding schemes are\ncompetitive against state of the art interference avoidance based on orthogonal\naccess, for Rayleigh fading channels.\n","Comment: revision for IEEE Transactions on Information Theory"]}]

Numerical iteration suggests that under rescaling the\nsystem length, $L^{\\prime}=2L$, characteristic times rescale as\n$t^{\\prime}=2^{d_{w}}t$ with the exact walk exponent\n$d_{w}=\\log_{2}\\sqrt{5}=1.1609\\ldots$. Despite the lack of translational\ninvariance, this is very close to the ballistic spreading, $d_{w}=1$, found for\nregular lattices. However, we argue that an extended interpretation of the\ntraditional RG formalism will be needed to obtain scaling exponents\nanalytically. Direct simulations confirm our RG-prediction for $d_w$ and\nfurthermore reveal an immensely rich phenomenology for the spreading of the\nquantum walk on the gasket. Invariably, quantum interference localizes the walk\ncompletely with a site-access probability that declines with a powerlaw from\nthe initial site, in contrast with a classical random walk, which would pass\nall sites with certainty.\n","Comment: 10 pages, revtex4, for more information, see\n  http://www.physics.emory.edu/faculty/boettcher/"]}]

Afterwards, five different approaches are\nproposed to deal with corrupt probes. As a result, we extend the network\ncapability, and also increase the robustness of the retrieving procedure. We\nthen experimentally compare all these proposals and discuss pros and cons of\neach approach under different types of errors.

This pattern could indicate that\nthe strength of the CD8+ cell responses is waning, or that later viral escape\nmutants carry a larger fitness cost. In this paper, we investigate whether the\npattern of decreasing escape rate could also be caused by genetic interference\namong different escape strains. To this end, we developed a mathematical\nmulti-epitope model of HIV dynamics, which incorporates stochastic effects,\nrecombination and mutation. We used cumulative linkage disequilibrium measures\nto quantify the amount of interference. We found that nearly synchronous,\nsimilarly strong immune responses in two-locus systems enhance the generation\nof genetic interference. This effect, combined with densely spaced sampling\ntimes at the beginning of infection, leads to decreasing successive escape rate\nestimates, even when there were no selection differences among alleles. These\npredictions are supported by experimental data from one HIV-infected patient.\nThus, interference could explain why later escapes are slower. Considering\nescape mutations in isolation, neglecting their genetic linkage, conceals the\nunderlying haplotype dynamics and can affect the estimation of the selective\npressure exerted by CD8+ cells.

These bounds quantify analytically\nthe potential benefit of adaptive sensing as a function of target frequency and\nimportance. Numerical results indicate that the proposed policies perform close\nto the oracle bound (<3dB) when signal quality is sufficiently high\n(e.g.~performance within 3 dB for SNR above 15 dB). Moreover, the proposed\npolicies improve on previous policies in terms of reducing estimation error,\nreducing misclassification probability, and increasing expected return. To\naccount for sensors with different levels of agility, three sensor models are\nconsidered: global adaptive (GA), which can allocate different amounts of\nresource to each location in the space; global uniform (GU), which can allocate\nresources uniformly across the scene; and local adaptive (LA), which can\nallocate fixed units to a subset of locations.

We study a distributed reception scenario in which a\ntransmitter equipped with multiple antennas sends multiple streams via spatial\nmultiplexing to a large number of geographically separated single antenna\nreceive nodes. The receive nodes then quantize their received signals and\nforward the quantized received signals to a receive fusion center. With global\nchannel knowledge and forwarded quantized information from the receive nodes,\nthe fusion center attempts to decode the transmitted symbols. We assume the\ntransmit vector consists of phase shift keying (PSK) constellation points, and\neach receive node quantizes its received signal with one bit for each of the\nreal and imaginary parts of the signal to minimize the transmission overhead\nbetween the receive nodes and the fusion center. Fusing this data is a\nnon-trivial problem because the receive nodes cannot decode the transmitted\nsymbols before quantization. Instead, each receive node processes a single\nquantity, i.e., the received signal, regardless of the number of transmitted\nsymbols. We develop an optimal maximum likelihood (ML) receiver and a\nlow-complexity zero-forcing (ZF)-type receiver at the fusion center. Despite\nits suboptimality, the ZF-type receiver is simple to implement and shows\ncomparable performance with the ML receiver in the low signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) regime but experiences an error rate floor at high SNR. It is shown that\nthis error floor can be overcome by increasing the number of receive nodes.\nHence, the ZF-type receiver would be a practical solution for distributed\nreception with spatial multiplexing in the era of the IoT where we can easily\nhave a large number of receive nodes.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Signal\n  Processing"]}]

In\nthis work, a hybrid computational framework is presented, using a total\nLagrangian formulation of the Finite Element Method (FEM) to represent a\nflexible barrier. The actions exerted on the structure by a debris flow are\nobtained from simultaneous simulations of the flow of a fluid-grain mixture,\nusing two conveniently coupled solvers: the Discrete Element Method (DEM)\ngoverns the motion of the grains, while the free-surface non-Newtonian fluid\nphase is solved using the Lattice-Boltzmann Method (LBM). Simulations on\nrealistic geometries show the dependence of the momentum transfer on the\nbarrier on the composition of the debris flow, challenging typical assumptions\nmade during the design process today. In particular, we demonstrate that both\ngrains and fluid contribute in a non-negligible way to the momentum transfer.\nMoreover, we show how the flexibility of the barrier reduces its vulnerability\nto structural collapse, and how the stress is distributed on its fabric,\nhighlighting potential weak points.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 10 figures"]}]

At tree level, the\nBCFW recursion relations are analyzed with respect to their validity for\ngeneral off-shell objects in Yang-Mills theory, which is a significant step\naway from their established zone of applicability. Unphysical poles constitute\na new potential problem in addition to the boundary behavior issue, common to\nthe on-shell case as well. For an infinite family of massive fermion currents,\nboth obstacles are shown to be avoided under the certain conditions, which\nprovides a natural recursion relation. At one loop, scattering amplitudes can\nbe calculated from unitarity cuts through their expansion into known scalar\nintegrals with free coefficients. A powerful method to obtain these\ncoefficients, namely spinor integration, is discussed and rederived in a\nsomewhat novel form. It is then used to compute analytically the infinite\nseries of one-loop gluon amplitudes in N = 1 super-Yang-Mills theory with\nexactly three negative helicities. The final part of this thesis concerns the\nintriguing relationship between gluon and graviton scattering amplitudes, which\ninvolves a beautiful duality between the color and kinematic content of gauge\ntheories. This BCJ duality is extended to include particles in the fundamental\nrepresentation of the gauge group, which is shown to relieve the restriction of\nthe BCJ construction to factorizable gravities and thus give access to\namplitudes in generic (super-)gravity theories.\n","Comment: 111 pages, PhD thesis defended on 12/09/2014"]}]

Because the\npursuer is \"blind\", capture entails the pursuer and evader being collocated at\nan UGS location.

In order to provision high network capacity, small cell\nbase stations (SCBSs) are widely deployed. Owing to the close proximity to\nmobile users, SCBSs can effectively enhance the network capacity and offloading\ntraffic load from macro BSs (MBSs). However, the cost-effective backhaul may\nnot be readily available for SCBSs, thus leading to backhaul constraints in\nsmall cell networks (SCNs). Enabling cache in BSs may mitigate the backhaul\nconstraints in SCNs. Moreover, the dense deployment of SCBSs may incur\nexcessive energy consumption. To alleviate brown power consumption, renewable\nenergy will be explored to power BSs. In such a network, it is challenging to\ndynamically balance traffic load among BSs to optimize the network utilities.\nIn this paper, we investigate the traffic load balancing in\nbackhaul-constrained cache-enabled small cell networks powered by hybrid energy\nsources. We have proposed a network utility aware (NUA) traffic load balancing\nscheme that optimizes user association to strike a tradeoff between the green\npower utilization and the traffic delivery latency. On balancing the traffic\nload, the proposed NUA traffic load balancing scheme considers the green power\nutilization, the traffic delivery latency in both BSs and their backhaul, and\nthe cache hit ratio. The NUA traffic load balancing scheme allows dynamically\nadjusting the tradeoff between the green power utilization and the traffic\ndelivery latency. We have proved the convergence and the optimality of the\nproposed NUA traffic load balancing scheme.
