Logit dynamics is a decentralized algorithm in which a level of\nirrationality (a.k.a. \"noise\") is introduced in players' behavior. In this\ncontext, the solution concept of interest becomes the logit equilibrium, as\nopposed to Nash equilibria. Logit equilibria are distributions over strategy\nprofiles that possess several nice properties, including existence and\nuniqueness. However, there are games in which their computation may take time\nexponential in the number of players. We therefore look at an approximate\nversion of logit equilibria, called metastable distributions, introduced by\nAuletta et al. [SODA 2012]. These are distributions that remain stable (i.e.,\nplayers do not go too far from it) for a super-polynomial number of steps\n(rather than forever, as for logit equilibria). The hope is that these\ndistributions exist and can be reached quickly by logit dynamics.\n  We identify a class of potential games, called asymptotically well-behaved,\nfor which the behavior of the logit dynamics is not chaotic as the number of\nplayers increases so to guarantee meaningful asymptotic results. We prove that\nany such game admits distributions which are metastable no matter the level of\nnoise present in the system, and the starting profile of the dynamics. These\ndistributions can be quickly reached if the rationality level is not too big\nwhen compared to the inverse of the maximum difference in potential.

At the same time, the theoretical description of\nlight nuclei has made enormous progress, and properties of, e.g., the Helium\nisotopes can now be calculated {\\it ab initio}. These advances make those rare\nisotopes an ideal testing ground for effective field theories (EFTs) built upon\ncluster degrees of freedom.\n  Purpose: Systems with widely separated intrinsic scales are well suited to an\nEFT treatment. The Borromean halo nucleus $^6$He exhibits such a separation of\nscales. In this work an EFT in which the degrees of freedom are the valence\nneutrons ($n$) and an inert $^4$He-core ($\\alpha$) is employed. The properties\nof ${}^6$He can then be calculated using the momentum-space Faddeev equations\nfor the $\\alpha nn$ bound state to obtain information on ${}^6$He at leading\norder (LO) within the EFT.\n  Results: The $nn$ virtual state and the $^2$P$_{3/2}$ resonance in $^5$He\ngive the two-body amplitudes which are input to our LO three-body Halo EFT\ncalculation. We find that without a genuine three-body interaction the\ntwo-neutron separation energy $S_{2n}$ of ${}^6$He is strongly cutoff\ndependent. We introduce a $nn \\alpha$ \"three-body\" operator which renormalizes\nthe system, adjusting its coefficient to reproduce the $S_{2n}$ of $^6$He. The\nFaddeev components are then cutoff independent for cutoffs of the order of, and\nabove, the breakdown scale of the Halo EFT.\n  Conclusions: As in the case of a three-body system where only resonant s-wave\ninteractions are present, one three-body input is required for the\nrenormalization of the EFT equations that describe $^6$He at LO. However, in\ncontrast to the s-wave-only case, the running of the LO $nn\\alpha$ counterterm\ndoes not exhibit discrete scale invariance, due to the presence of the p-wave\n$n\\alpha$ interaction.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 6 figures, 1 table"]}]

The model takes\ninto account the self-field created by the tape, which gives an important\ncontribution when the field applied in the experiments is low. The same model\ncan also be used to compute the effective critical current of devices composed\nof electromagnetically interacting tapes. Three examples are considered here:\ntwo differently current rated Roebel cables composed of REBCO coated conductors\nand a power cable prototype composed of Bi-2223 tapes. The critical currents\ncomputed with the numerical model show good agreement with the measured ones.\nThe simulations reveal also that several parameter sets in the Jc(B,theta) give\nan equally good representation of the experimental characterization of the\ntapes and that the measured Ic values of cables are subjected to the influence\nof experimental conditions, such as Ic degradation due to the manufacturing and\nassembling process and non-uniformity of the tape properties.

In previous work using the Spitzer\nSpace Telescope, we found evidence to support at least one sub-Earth-sized\nexoplanet orbiting the nearby mid-M dwarf star GJ 436. As a follow up, here we\nused the Hubble Space Telescope to investigate the existence of one of these\ncandidate planets, UCF-1.01, by searching for two transit signals as it passed\nin front of its host star. Interpretation of the data hinges critically on\ncorrectly modeling and removing the WFC3 instrument systematics from the light\ncurves. Building on previous HST work, we demonstrate that WFC3 analyses need\nto explore the use of a quadratic function to fit a visit-long time-dependent\nsystematic. This is important for establishing absolute transit and eclipse\ndepths in the white light curves of all transiting systems. The work presented\nhere exemplifies this point by putatively detecting the primary transit of\nUCF-1.01 with the use of a linear trend. However, using a quadratic trend, we\nachieve a better fit to the white light curves and a reduced transit depth that\nis inconsistent with previous Spitzer measurements. Furthermore, quadratic\ntrends with or without a transit model component produce comparable fits to the\navailable data. Using extant WFC3 transit light curves for GJ436b, we further\nvalidate the quadratic model component by achieving photon-limited model fit\nresiduals and consistent transit depths over multiple epochs. We conclude that,\nwhen we fit for a quadratic trend, our new data contradict the prediction of a\nsub-Earth-sized planet orbiting GJ 436 with the size, period, and ephemeris\nposited from the Spitzer data by a margin of 3.1{\\sigma}.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

An initial destabilization of a filament results in\nstretching out of magnetic threads belonging to its body and rooted in the\nphotosphere along the inversion line. Their reconnection leads to i) heating of\nparts of the filament or its environment, ii) initial development of the flare\narcade cusp and ribbons, and iii) increasing similarity of the filament to a\ncurved flux rope and its acceleration. Then the pre-eruption arcade enveloping\nthe filament gets involved in reconnection according to the standard model and\ncontinues to form the flare arcade and ribbons. The poloidal magnetic flux in\nthe curved rope developing from the filament progressively increases and forces\nits toroidal expansion. This flux rope impulsively expands and produces an MHD\ndisturbance, which rapidly steepens into a shock. The shock passes through the\narcade expanding above the filament and then freely propagates ahead of the CME\nlike a decelerating blast wave for some time. If the CME is slow, then the\nshock eventually decays. Otherwise, the frontal part of the shock changes into\nthe bow-shock regime.

Two epochs of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging separated by a\ntime baseline of ~4.4 years provide proper motions that allow us to measure the\ntransverse velocities of the jets, while ground-based spectra sample their\nDoppler velocities. Together these yield full three-dimensional space\nvelocities. Aside from HH 666, their identification as outflows was previously\ninferred only from morphology in images. Proper motions now show decisively\nthat these objects are indeed jets, and confirm that the intermediate-mass\nprotostars identified as the candidate driving sources for HH 666 and HH 1066\nare indeed the origin of these outflows. The appearance of two new knots in the\nHH 1066 jet suggest recent (~35 yr) changes in the accretion rate, underscoring\nthe variable nature of accretion and outflow in the formation of\nintermediate-mass stars. In fact, kinematics and mass-ejection histories for\nall the jets suggest highly episodic mass loss, and point toward pronounced\naccretion fluctuations. Overall, we measure velocities similar to those found\nfor low-mass protostars. However, the HH jets in Carina have higher densities\nand are more massive than their low-mass counterparts. Coarse estimates suggest\nthat the heavy jets of intermediate-mass protostars can compete with or even\nexceed inject ~10 or more times the cumulative momentum injection of lower-mass\nprotostars.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 9 figures"]}]
