However, it\nis an open question whether or not the widely accepted peaked solitary waves\ncan be derived from the fully nonlinear wave equations. In this paper, a\nunified wave model (UWM) based on the symmetry and the fully nonlinear wave\nequations is put forward for progressive waves with permanent form in finite\nwater depth. Different from traditional wave models, the flows described by the\nUWM are not necessarily irrotational at crest, so that it is more general. The\nunified wave model admits not only the traditional progressive waves with\nsmooth crest, but also a new kind of solitary waves with peaked crest that\ninclude the famous peaked solitary waves given by the Camassa-Holm equation.\nBesides, it is proved that Kelvin's theorem still holds everywhere for the\nnewly found peaked solitary waves. Thus, the UWM unifies, for the first time,\nboth of the traditional smooth waves and the peaked solitary waves. In other\nwords, the peaked solitary waves are consistent with the traditional smooth\nones. So, in the frame of inviscid fluid, the peaked solitary waves are as\nacceptable and reasonable as the traditional smooth ones. It is found that the\npeaked solitary waves have some unusual and unique characteristics. First of\nall, they have a peaked crest with a discontinuous vertical velocity at crest.\nEspecially, the phase speed of the peaked solitary waves has nothing to do with\nwave height. In addition, the kinetic energy of the peaked solitary waves\neither increases or almost keeps the same from free surface to bottom. All of\nthese unusual properties show the novelty of the peaked solitary waves,\nalthough it is still an open question whether or not they are reasonable in\nphysics if the viscosity of fluid and surface tension are considered.\n","Comment: 53 pages, 13 figures, 7 tables.

Most prior work on PNC focused on its application in a\nsimple two-way-relay channel (TWRC) consisting of three nodes only. Studies of\nthe application of PNC in general networks are relatively few. This paper is an\nattempt to fill this gap. We put forth two ideas: 1) A general network can be\ndecomposed into small building blocks of PNC, referred to as the PNC atoms, for\nscheduling of PNC transmissions. 2) We identify nine PNC atoms, with TWRC being\none of them. Three major results are as follows. First, using the decomposition\nframework, the throughput performance of PNC is shown to be significantly\nbetter than those of the traditional multi-hop scheme and the conventional\nnetwork coding scheme. For example, under heavy traffic volume, PNC can achieve\n100% throughput gain relative to the traditional multi-hop scheme. Second, PNC\ndecomposition based on a variety of different PNC atoms can yield much better\nperformance than PNC decomposition based on the TWRC atom alone. Third, three\nout of the nine atoms are most important to good performance. Specifically, the\ndecomposition based on these three atoms is good enough most of the time, and\nit is not necessary to use the other six atoms.\n","Comment: 38 pages, 7 figures, 10 tables, accepted by IEEE SECON 2013"]}]

We also find that the center of\nmass motion in the presence of finite tunneling goes through collapse and\nrevivals, giving an example of quantum transport where interaction induced\nrevivals are important. We quantify the effects of residual harmonic trapping\non the momentum distribution dynamics and show the occurrence of\ninteraction-modified temporal Talbot effect.

However, inline deduplication degrades restore\nperformance of the latest backup due to fragmentation, and complicates deletion\nof ex- pired backups due to the sharing of data chunks. While out-of-line\ndeduplication addresses the problems by forward-pointing existing duplicate\nchunks to those of the latest backup, it introduces additional I/Os of writing\nand removing duplicate chunks. We design and implement RevDedup, an efficient\nhybrid inline and out-of-line deduplication system for backup storage. It\napplies coarse-grained inline deduplication to remove duplicates of the latest\nbackup, and then fine-grained out-of-line reverse deduplication to remove\nduplicates from older backups. Our reverse deduplication design limits the I/O\noverhead and prepares for efficient deletion of expired backups.

The mechanical properties appear to be relevant to the length of\nthe columns of molecules compared to the thread length, instead of the usual\ncorrelation length. When short, the column entanglement being taken into\naccount, the strand exhibits rather fluid properties that may even look like\nnematic at a macroscopic scale.

On pulling a\nstrand, the elongation stress eventually exceeds the plasticity threshold, thus\nbreaking columns and filaments. Cracks, more exactly, giant dislocations are\nthus formed.
