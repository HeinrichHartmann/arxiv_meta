The\ncommunity labels for the nodes are unknown and it is of major interest to\nestimate them (i.e., community detection). Degree Corrected Block Model (DCBM)\nis a popular network model. How to detect communities with the DCBM is an\ninteresting problem, where the main challenge lies in the degree heterogeneity.\nWe propose a new approach to community detection which we call the Spectral\nClustering On Ratios-of-Eigenvectors (SCORE). Compared to classical spectral\nmethods, the main innovation is to use the entry-wise ratios between the first\nleading eigenvector and each of the other leading eigenvectors for clustering.\nLet $A$ be the adjacency matrix of the network. We first obtain the $K$ leading\neigenvectors of $A$, say, $\\hat{\\eta}_1,\\ldots,\\hat{\\eta}_K$, and let $\\hat{R}$\nbe the $n\\times (K-1)$ matrix such that\n$\\hat{R}(i,k)=\\hat{\\eta}_{k+1}(i)/\\hat{\\eta}_1(i)$, $1\\leq i\\leq n$, $1\\leq\nk\\leq K-1$. We then use $\\hat{R}$ for clustering by applying the $k$-means\nmethod. The central surprise is, the effect of degree heterogeneity is largely\nancillary, and can be effectively removed by taking entry-wise ratios between\n$\\hat{\\eta}_{k+1}$ and $\\hat{\\eta}_1$, $1\\leq k\\leq K-1$. The method is\nsuccessfully applied to the web blogs data and the karate club data, with error\nrates of $58/1222$ and $1/34$, respectively. These results are more\nsatisfactory than those by the classical spectral methods. Additionally,\ncompared to modularity methods, SCORE is easier to implement, computationally\nfaster, and also has smaller error rates. We develop a theoretic framework\nwhere we show that under mild conditions, the SCORE stably yields consistent\ncommunity detection. In the core of the analysis is the recent development on\nRandom Matrix Theory (RMT), where the matrix-form Bernstein inequality is\nespecially helpful.\n","Comment: Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/14-AOS1265 the Annals of\n  Statistics (http://www.imstat.org/aos/) by the Institute of Mathematical\n  Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)"]}]

Most use the Loss Distribution\nApproach (LDA) which defines the aggregate loss distribution as the convolution\nof a frequency and a severity distribution representing the number and\nmagnitude of losses, respectively. Estimated capital is a Value-at-Risk (99.9th\npercentile) estimate of this annual loss distribution. In practice, the\nseverity distribution drives the capital estimate, which is essentially a very\nhigh quantile of the estimated severity distribution. Unfortunately, because\nthe relevant severities are heavy-tailed AND the quantiles being estimated are\nso high, VaR always appears to be a convex function of the severity parameters,\ncausing all widely-used estimators to generate biased capital estimates\n(apparently) due to Jensen's Inequality. The observed capital inflation is\nsometimes enormous, even at the unit-of-measure (UoM) level (even billions\nUSD). Herein I present an estimator of capital that essentially eliminates this\nupward bias. The Reduced-bias Capital Estimator (RCE) is more consistent with\nthe regulatory intent of the LDA framework than implementations that fail to\nmitigate this bias. RCE also notably increases the precision of the capital\nestimate and consistently increases its robustness to violations of the i.i.d.\ndata presumption (which are endemic to operational risk loss event data). So\nwith greater capital accuracy, precision, and robustness, RCE lowers capital\nrequirements at both the UoM and enterprise levels, increases capital stability\nfrom quarter to quarter, ceteris paribus, and does both while more accurately\nand precisely reflecting regulatory intent. RCE is straightforward to implement\nusing any major statistical software package.\n"]}]

In this paper, we show that\nthe RPPM model can be extended to provide support for caching of authorization\ndecisions and enforcement of separation of duty policies. We show that these\nextensions are natural and powerful. Indeed, caching provides far greater\nadvantages in RPPM than it does in most other access control models and we are\nable to support a wide range of separation of duty policies.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication at STM 2014 (without proofs, which are\n  included in this longer version)"]}]

These helix-like structures possess a\nhigh degree of flexibility that gives the biopolymers a unique extendibility.\nThis has been considered beneficial for piliated bacteria adhering to host\nsurfaces in the presence of a fluid flow. We show in this work that helix-like\npili have the ability to act as efficient dampers of force that can, for a\nlimited time, lower the load on the force-mediating adhesin-receptor bond on\nthe tip of an individual pilus. The model presented is applied to bacteria\nadhering with a single pilus of either of the two most common types expressed\nby uropathogenic Escherichia coli, P or type 1 pili, subjected to realistic\nflows. The results indicate that for moderate flows (~25 mm/s) the force\nexperienced by the adhesin-receptor interaction at the tip of the pilus can be\nreduced by a factor of ~6 and ~4, respectively. The uncoiling ability provides\na bacterium with a \"go with the flow\" possibility that acts as a damping. It is\nsurmised that this can be an important factor for the initial part of the\nadhesion process, in particular in turbulent flows, and thereby be of use for\nbacteria in their striving to survive a natural defense such as fluid rinsing\nactions.\n","Comment: 31 pages, 5 figures"]}]

We prove general structural results for the heat kernel coefficients\n$a_{2k}(r;g)$ and derive explicit formulas for $a_0(r)$ and $a_2(r)$ in terms\nof renormalized volume coefficients. The Taylor coefficients of $a_{2k}(r;g)$\n(as functions of $r$) interpolate between the renormalized volume coefficients\nof a metric $g$ ($k=0$) and the heat kernel coefficients of the conformal\nLaplacian of $g$ ($r=0$). Although $\\H(r;g)$ is not conformally covariant,\nthere is a beautiful formula for the conformal variation of the trace of its\nheat kernel. As a consequence, we give a heat equation proof of the conformal\ntransformation law of the integrated renormalized volume coefficients. By\nrefining these arguments, we also give a heat equation proof of the conformal\ntransformation law of the renormalized volume coefficients itself. The Taylor\ncoefficients of $a_2(r)$ define a sequence of higher-order Riemannian curvature\nfunctionals with extremal properties at Einstein metrics which are analogous to\nthose of integrated renormalized volume coefficients.

To cope with the issue of determining optimized configurations of\ncloud in-memory data stores, in this article we present a flexible simulation\nframework offering skeleton simulation models that can be easily specialized in\norder to capture the dynamics of diverse data grid systems, such as those\nrelated to the specific protocol used to provide data consistency and/or\ntransactional guarantees. Besides its flexibility, another peculiar aspect of\nthe framework lies in that it integrates simulation and machine-learning\n(black-box) techniques, the latter being essentially used to capture the\ndynamics of the data-exchange layer (e.g. the message passing layer) across the\ncache servers. This is a relevant aspect when considering that the actual\ndata-transport/networking infrastructure on top of which the data grid is\ndeployed might be unknown, hence being not feasible to be modeled via white-box\n(namely purely simulative) approaches. We also provide an extended experimental\nstudy aimed at validating instances of simulation models supported by our\nframework against execution dynamics of real data grid systems deployed on top\nof either private or public cloud infrastructures.\n","Comment: 34 pages"]}]

The basic idea is to extend the three-particle\namplitudes to the space of unphysical helicities keeping the dimension of the\nrelated coupling constant fixed, and construct on-shell forms out of them. We\nbriefly discuss the analytic structure of the extended on-shell diagrams, both\nat tree level and one loop. Furthermore, we propose an integration contour\nwhich, applied to the relevant on-shell forms, allows to extract the\nfour-particle amplitudes in Lorentz signature at one loop. With this contour at\nhand, we explicitly apply our procedure to this case obtaining the IR\ndivergences as poles in the deformation parameter space, as well as the correct\nfunctional form for the finite term.
