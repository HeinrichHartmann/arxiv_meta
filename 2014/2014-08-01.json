They may be inherent to the problem---e.g., in\ndetermining the relationship between genetics and the presence or absence of a\ndisease---or they may be a result of extreme quantization. In one-bit\ncompressed sensing it has recently been shown that the number of one-bit\nmeasurements required for signal estimation mirrors that of unquantized\ncompressed sensing. Indeed, $s$-sparse signals in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ can be\nestimated (up to normalization) from $\\Omega(s \\log (n/s))$ one-bit\nmeasurements. Nevertheless, controlling the precise accuracy of the error\nestimate remains an open challenge.

In particular, a long propagation distance\nof about 900 m between x-ray source and sample leads to a large lateral photon\nbeam size at the optics. The beam divergence is the most important parameter\nfor the optical system, and is largest for the lowest photon energies and for\nthe shortest pulse duration (corresponding to the lowest charge). Due to the\nlarge divergence of nominal X-ray pulses with duration shorter than 10 fs, one\nsuffers diffraction from mirror aperture, leading to a 100-fold decrease in\nfluence at photon energies around 4 keV, which are ideal for imaging of single\nbiomolecules.

We start with\na scheme inspired by Auto-Context, but that is suitable in situations where the\nlack of large training sets poses a potential problem of overfitting. The aim\nis to capture the interactions between neighboring image pixels to better\nregularize the boundaries of segmented regions. As in Auto-Context [Tu et al.,\nPAMI 2009] the segmentation process is iterative and, at each iteration, the\nsegmentation results for the previous iterations are taken into account in\nconjunction with the image itself. However, unlike in [Tu et al., PAMI 2009],\nwe organize our recursion so that the classifiers can progressively focus on\ndifficult-to-classify locations. This lets us exploit the power of the\ndecision-tree paradigm while avoiding over-fitting. In the context of this\narchitecture, KernelBoost represents a powerful building block due to its\nability to learn on the score maps coming from previous iterations. We first\nintroduce two important mechanisms to empower the KernelBoost classifier,\nnamely pooling and the clustering of positive samples based on the appearance\nof the corresponding ground-truth. These operations significantly contribute to\nincrease the effectiveness of the system on biomedical images, where texture\nplays a major role in the recognition of the different image components.

We\nuse Pitman's proof of Cayley's formula, which proceeds via a calculation of the\npartition function of the additive coalescent, as motivation and as a\nlaunchpad. We define a random variable which may reasonably be called the\nempirical partition function of the multiplicative coalescent, and show that\nits typical value is exponentially smaller than its expected value. Our\narguments lead us to an analysis of the susceptibility of the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi\nrandom graph process, and thence to a novel proof of Frieze's \\zeta(3)-limit\ntheorem for the weight of a random minimum spanning tree.\n","Comment: 42 pages, 4 figures, 25 exercises, 6 open problems"]}]
