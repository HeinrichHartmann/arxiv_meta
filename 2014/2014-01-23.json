The effect of effective slip is\npredicted to decrease the force as compared with expected for two hydrophilic\nsurfaces and described by the Taylor equation. The presence of additional\nlength scales, $L$, $b_1$ and $b_2$, implies that a film drainage can be much\nricher than in case of a sphere moving towards a hydrophilic plane. For a large\n(compared to $L$) gap the reduction of the force is small, and for all textures\nthe force is similar to expected when a sphere is moving towards a smooth\nhydrophilic plane that is shifted down from the super-hydrophobic wall. The\nvalue of this shift is equal to the average of the eigenvalues of the\nslip-length tensor. By analyzing striped super-hydrophobic surfaces, we then\ncompute the correction to the Taylor equation for an arbitrary gap. We show\nthat at thinner gap the force reduction becomes more pronounced, and that it\ndepends strongly on the fraction of the gas area and local slip lengths.

We prove a global dispersion\nresult that can be expressed in terms of this entropy dispersion matrix and\nprovides intuition on the approximate rate losses at a given blocklength and\nerror probability. To gain better intuition about the rate at which the\nnon-asymptotic rate region converges to the Slepian-Wolf boundary, we define\nand characterize two operational dispersions: the local dispersion and the\nweighted sum-rate dispersion.

The main reason to\nintroduce the entire functions is to avoid ghosts (states of negative norm)\nlike the one in the four-dimensional Stelle's theory. The new theory is indeed\nghost-free since the two entire functions have the property to generalize the\nEinstein-Hilbert action without introducing new poles in the propagator.

For waves,\nhowever, diffusion is an approximation that disregards the possibility of\ninterference. Anderson localization, which manifests itself through a vanishing\ndiffusion coefficient in an infinite system, originates from constructive\ninterference of waves traveling in loop trajectories -- pairs of time-reversed\npaths returning to the same point. In an open system of finite size, the return\nprobability through such paths is reduced, particularly near the boundary where\nwaves may escape. Based on this argument, the self-consistent theory of\nlocalization and the supersymmetric field theory predict that the diffusion\ncoefficient varies spatially inside the system. A direct experimental\nobservation of this effect is a challenge because it requires monitoring wave\ntransport inside the system. Here, we fabricate two-dimensional photonic random\nmedia and probe position-dependent diffusion inside the sample from the third\ndimension.

The aim of this work is to study the Wheeler-DeWitt\nquantization of cosmological models where the matter content is described by an\nhydrodynamical perfect fluid, where the Wheeler-DeWitt equation reduces to a\ngenuine Schr\\\"odinger equation. In this case, it is shown that the conclusions\nof the Consistent Histories and the de Broglie-Bohm approaches coincide in the\nquantum cosmological models where the curvature of the spatial sections is not\npositive definite, namely, that the cosmological singularities are eliminated.\nIn the case of positive spatial curvature, the family of histories is no longer\nconsistent, and no conclusion can be given in this framework.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Ab initio and molecular mechanics\nwere employed to probe the binding energies of vacancies and segregation\nenergies of Ga for <100>, <110> and <111> STGBs in Al. We found that the GB\nlocal arrangements and resulting structural units have a significant influence\non the magnitude of vacancy binding energies. For example, the mean vacancy\nbinding energy for <100>, <110>, and <111> STGBs at 1st layer was found to be\n-0.63 eV, -0.26 eV, and -0.60 eV. However, some GBs exhibited vacancy binding\nenergies closer to bulk values, indicating interfaces with zero sink strength,\ni.e., these GBs may not provide effective pathways for vacancy diffusion. The\nresults from the present work showed that the GB structure and the associated\nfree volume also play significant roles in Ga segregation and the subsequent\nembrittlement of Al. The Ga mean segregation energy for <100>, <110> and <111>\nSTGBs at 1st layer was found to be -0.23 eV, -0.12 eV and -0.24 eV,\nrespectively, suggesting a stronger correlation between the GB structural unit,\nits free volume, and segregation behavior. Furthermore, as the GB free volume\nincreased, the difference in segregation energies between the 1st layer and the\n0th layer increased. Thus, the GB character and free volume provide an\nimportant key to understanding the degree of anisotropy in various systems. The\noverall characteristic Ga absorption length scale was found to be about ~10, 8,\nand 12 layers for <100>, <110>, and <111> STGBs, respectively. Also, a few GBs\nof different tilt axes with relatively high segregation energies (between 0 and\n-0.1 eV) at the boundary were also found.

The outcome\nis a modified version of the stress-energy tensor that is the source of the\ngravitational field. The derivation is based on the kinetic theory of a gas of\nidentical particles with no internal structure.\n  The presentation here is in two parts. In Part I, I describe the stress\ntensor that Xinzhong Chen and I have proposed for the matter tensor for a\nnonrelativistic gas with input from Hongling Rao and Jean-Luc Thiffeault. Our\nderivation of the equations of fluid dynamics is based on kinetic theory\nwithout recourse to the standard Chapman-Enskog approximation.\n  In Part II, I present the analogous derivation of our form for the\nstress-energy tensor in the relativistic case. Then I exhibit its application\nto the usual isotropic cosmological model. The result of that, in addition to\nthe Friedmann solution, is a second solution that arises from terms discarded\nin the usual Chapman-Enskog approximation. The new solution is a temporal\nanalogue of a spatial shock wave.\n  Just as the usual shock waves make transitions in properties within a mean\nfree path, the new solution can change its properties appreciably in a mean\nflight time. Whereas the Friedmann solution is not dissipative, the new\nsolution produces entropy at a rate that may be of cosmological interest. For\nthe calculation of cosmic entropy production I use a formula derived in the\nultrarelativistic limit in which particle masses are negligible.\n  Independently of the cosmological aspects, the fluid dynamical equations that\nwe derive are causal, even for the heat equation (or Fourier equation).\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1107.0319"]}]

Interestingly, since Kuffler's\npioneering experiments on retinal ganglion cells, mathematical models have been\nvital for advancing our understanding of the receptive fields of visual\nneurons. However, existing models were not designed to describe the most\nsalient attributes of the highly specialized neurons in the V1 to MT motion\nprocessing stream; and they have not been able to do so. Here, we introduce the\nGabor-Einstein wavelet, a new family of functions for representing the\nreceptive fields of V1 to MT neurons.

The particular\ndistribution of lowpass to bandpass temporal frequency filtering properties of\nV1 to MT neurons (Foster et al 1985; DeAngelis et al 1993b; Hawken et al 1996)\nis clearly explained by the Gabor-Einstein basis.

Initially Abt & Levato proposed a shell-like nature to\nexplain the sn stars, although this scenario was subsequently questioned. We\naim to derive abundances for a sample of 9 stars, including sn and non-sn\nstars, to determine the possible relation between sn and CP stars. We analysed\nthe photospheric chemical composition of sn stars and show that approximately\n40% of them display chemical peculiarities (such as He-weak and HgMn stars)\nwithin a range of temperature of 10300 - 14500 K. We have studied the possible\ncontribution of different processes to the broad He I lines present in the sn\nstars. Although NLTE effects could not be completely ruled out, it seems that\nNLTE is not directly related to the broad He I profiles observed in the sn\nstars. The broad-line He I 4026 is the clearest example of the sn\ncharacteristics in our sample. We succesfully fit this line in 4 out of 7 sn\nstars by using the appropriate Stark broadening tables, while small differences\nappear in the other 3 stars. Studying the plots of abundance vs depth for the\nHe I lines resulted in some sn stars probably being stratified in He. However,\na further study of variability in the He I lines would help for determining\nwhether a possible non-uniform He superficial distribution could also play a\nrole in these sn stars. We conclude that the broad He I lines that characterize\nthe sn class could be modelled (at least in some of these stars) by the usual\nradiative transfer process with Stark broadening, without needing another\nbroadening mechanism. The observed line broadening in sn stars seems to be\nrelated to the \"normal\" He line formation that originates in these atmospheres.\n(abridged)\n","Comment: 18 pages, 11 figures, Astronomy & Astrophysics accepted"]}]
