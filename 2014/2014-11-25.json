It follows from the law of large numbers that a plurality vote among the\nn individuals would result in the correct outcome, with probability approaching\none exponentially quickly as n tends to infinity. Our interest in this paper is\nin a variant of the process above where, after forming their initial opinions,\nthe voters update their decisions based on some interaction with their\nneighbors in a social network. Our main example is \"majority dynamics\", in\nwhich each voter adopts the most popular opinion among its friends. The\ninteraction repeats for some number of rounds and is then followed by a\npopulation-wide plurality vote.\n  The question we tackle is that of \"efficient aggregation of information\": in\nwhich cases is the better alternative chosen with probability approaching one\nas n tends to infinity? Conversely, for which sequences of growing graphs does\naggregation fail, so that the wrong alternative gets chosen with probability\nbounded away from zero? We construct a family of examples in which interaction\nprevents efficient aggregation of information, and give a condition on the\nsocial network which ensures that aggregation occurs. For the case of majority\ndynamics we also investigate the question of unanimity in the limit. In\nparticular, if the voters' social network is an expander graph, we show that if\nthe initial population is sufficiently biased towards a particular alternative\nthen that alternative will eventually become the unanimous preference of the\nentire population.\n","Comment: 22 pages"]}]

The circle expands at the\nhigher levels (HeII 304A and FeIX 171A). This indicates that the low-frequency\noscillations propagate along the inclined magnetic tubes in the spot. We found\nthat the inclination of the tubes reaches 50--60 degrees in the upper\nchromosphere and the transition zone. The main oscillation power in the 5-8 mHz\nrange concentrates within the umbra boundaries at all the levels. The highest\nfrequency oscillations (8 mHz) are located in the peculiar points inside the\numbra. These points probably coincide with umbral dots. We deduced the\npropagation velocities to be 28+-15 km/s, 26+-15 km/s, and 55+-10 km/s for the\nSiI 10827A-HeI 10830A, 1700A-HeII 304A, and HeII 304A-FeIX 171A height levels,\nrespectively.\n"]}]

The problem of\nlearning from only positive and unlabeled examples, called PU\n(positive-unlabeled) learning, has been studied in the context of binary\nclassification. We consider the PU matrix completion problem, where an\nunderlying real-valued matrix M is first quantized to generate one-bit\nobservations and then a subset of positive entries is revealed. Under the\nassumption that M has bounded nuclear norm, we provide recovery guarantees for\ntwo different observation models: 1) M parameterizes a distribution that\ngenerates a binary matrix, 2) M is thresholded to obtain a binary matrix.

One limitation is that it is very\ndifficult to interpret the results of PCA. In addition, the classical PCA is\nvulnerable to certain noisy data.

In addition, based on the sparse model\nused in CSPCA, an optimal weight is assigned to each of the original feature,\nwhich in turn provides the output with good interpretability. With the output\nof our CSPCA, we can effectively analyze the importance of each feature under\nthe PCA criteria. The objective function is convex, and we propose an iterative\nalgorithm to optimize it.

The aim is to study different-frequency\nspatial distribution characteristics above sunspots and faculae and their\ndependence on magnetic-field features and to detect the oscillations that reach\nthe corona from the deep photosphere most effectively. We used\nFast-Fourier-Transform and frequency filtration of the intensity and\nDoppler-velocity variations with Morlet wavelet to trace the wave propagating\nfrom the photosphere to the chromosphere and corona. Spatial distribution of\nlow-frequency (1-2 mHz) oscillations outlines well the fan-loop structures in\nthe corona (the Fe IX 171 line) above sunspots and faculae. High-frequency\noscillations (5-7 mHz) are concentrated in fragments inside the photospheric\numbra boundaries and close to facular-region centers.

We\nderive a closed-form expression for the scaling of the gain in Erdos-Renyi\nrandom network graphs, where obtain a threshold value for the number of\nmemories deployed in a random graph beyond which network-wide benefits start to\nshine. Finally, the network-wide benefits are studied on Internet-like\nscale-free networks. We show that non-vanishing network compression gain is\nobtained even when only a tiny fraction of the total number of nodes in the\nnetwork are memory-enabled.\n"]}]

The main idea of such a\nsounding is based on the fact that in some models of pulsar magnetosphere the\nemission frequency depends on the height of its origin above the pulsar\nsurface. For this purpose it is needed to study the dependence of such a\nparameter as the rotation measure on frequency and pulse phase. We expect that\nit is possible to register the rotation measure dependence on the central\nobserving frequency and/or the pulse phase during the observations at widely\nspaced frequencies in the same conditions. The reliable registration of this\ndependence will result in resolving of the pulsar magnetosphere in depth. It is\npreferably to carry out the polarization researches in the observational mode\nof the individual pulses.\n  In this part of the work the model of polarized pulsed radio emission and the\nmodel of weakly anisotropic propagation medium are considered.\n  In future articles we will show how to determine the polarization parameters\nof pulsar radiation with the highest precision in presence of different types\nof recorders on the receiving side.

We introduce multi-way Gaussian graphical models that unify the\nstatistical approaches to inference for spatiotemporal epidemiology with the\nliterature on general GGMs. The novelty of the proposed work consists of the\naddition of the G-Wishart distribution to the substantial collection of\nstatistical tools used to model multivariate areal data. As opposed to fixed\ngraphs that describe geography, there is an inherent uncertainty related to\ngraph determination across the other dimensions of the data. Our new class of\nmethods for spatial epidemiology allow the simultaneous use of GGMs to\nrepresent known spatial dependencies and to determine unknown dependencies in\nthe other dimensions of the data.

At each time step, we recommend an item to each user, where a\nkey distinction from related bandit literature is that once a user consumes an\nitem (e.g., watches a movie), then that item cannot be recommended to the same\nuser again. The goal is to maximize the number of likable items recommended to\nusers over time. Our main result establishes that after nearly $\\log(km)$\ninitial learning time steps, a simple collaborative filtering algorithm\nachieves essentially optimal performance without knowing $k$. The algorithm has\nan exploitation step that uses cosine similarity and two types of exploration\nsteps, one to explore the space of items (standard in the literature) and the\nother to explore similarity between users (novel to this work).\n","Comment: Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2014)"]}]
