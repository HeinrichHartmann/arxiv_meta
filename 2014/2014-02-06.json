The set of these paths can be equipped with a lattice\nstructure, called the m-Tamari lattice and denoted by T_n^{m}, which\ngeneralizes the usual Tamari lattice T_n obtained when m=1. This lattice was\nintroduced by F. Bergeron in connection with the study of diagonal coinvariant\nspaces in three sets of n variables. The representation of the symmetric group\nS_n on these spaces is conjectured to be closely related to the natural\nrepresentation of S_n on (labelled) intervals of the m-Tamari lattice, which we\nstudy in this paper. An interval [P,Q] of T_n^{m} is labelled if the north\nsteps of Q are labelled from 1 to n in such a way the labels increase along any\nsequence of consecutive north steps. The symmetric group S_n acts on labelled\nintervals of T_n^{m} by permutation of the labels. We prove an explicit\nformula, conjectured by F. Bergeron and the third author, for the character of\nthe associated representation of S_n. In particular, the dimension of the\nrepresentation, that is, the number of labelled m-Tamari intervals of size n,\nis found to be (m+1)^n(mn+1)^{n-2}. These results are new, even when m=1. The\nform of these numbers suggests a connection with parking functions, but our\nproof is not bijective. The starting point is a recursive description of\nm-Tamari intervals. It yields an equation for an associated generating\nfunction, which is a refined version of the Frobenius series of the\nrepresentation. This equation involves two additional variables x and y, a\nderivative with respect to y and iterated divided differences with respect to\nx. The hardest part of the proof consists in solving it, and we develop\noriginal techniques to do so, partly inspired by previous work on polynomial\nequations with \"catalytic\" variables.\n","Comment: 29 pages --- This paper subsumes the research report arXiv:1109.2398,\n  which will not be submitted to any journal"]}]

Instead the feedback loop\nis built into the Hamiltonian such that the steady state of the system in the\npresence of drives and dissipation is a Bell state, an essential building-block\nstate for quantum information processing.

Then, we\npropose three algorithms with different running time and compare the number of\nobservations needed by them for successful cluster recovery. Our analytical\nresults show smooth time-data trade-offs: one can gradually reduce the\ncomputational complexity when increasingly more observations are available.\n"]}]

Therefore we resort to the (by now\nwell-established) vanishing viscosity approach to rate-independent modeling,\nand approximate the model by its viscous regularization.

We tackle it by combining a variational approach to a\nclass of abstract doubly nonlinear evolution equations, with careful regularity\nestimates tailored to this specific system, relying on a q-Laplacian type\ngradient regularization of the damage variable. Hence for the viscous problem\nwe conclude the existence of weak solutions, satisfying a suitable\nenergy-dissipation inequality that is the starting point for the vanishing\nviscosity analysis.

Usually, a\njet is triggered by a brightening or a flare, which provides the first driving\nforce to push plasma upward. In this process, magnetic reconnection is thought\nto be the mechanism to convert magnetic energy into thermal, nonthermal, and\nkinetic energies. However, most jets could reach an unusual high altitude and\nend much later than the end of its associated flare. This fact implies that\nthere is another way to continuously transfer magnetic energy into kinetic\nenergy even after the reconnection. The picture described above is well known\nin the community, but how and how much magnetic energy is released through a\nway other than reconnection is still unclear. By studying a prominence-like jet\nobserved by SDO/AIA and STEREO-A/EUVI, we find that the continuous relaxation\nof the post-reconnection magnetic field structure is an important process for a\njet to climb up higher than it could through only reconnection. The kinetic\nenergy of the jet gained through the relaxation is 1.6 times that gained from\nthe reconnection. The resultant energy flux is hundreds of times larger than\nthe flux required for the local coronal heating, suggesting that such jets are\na possible source to keep the corona hot.

Under the extreme compression, the\nouter magnetosphere at L > 5 was pushed inward and the outer radiation belt\nparticles with energies of several tens of keV moved earthward, became\nadiabatically accelerated and accumulated in the inner magnetosphere at L < 4\nthat produced the intensified ring current with an exceptionally long lifetime.\nThe observations were compared with predictions of various empirical and first\nprinciples models. All the models failed to predict the magnetospheric dynamics\nunder the extreme compression when the minimal magnetopause distance was\nestimated to be ~3 Re. The inconsistencies between the model predictions and\nobservations might result from distortions of plasma measurements by extreme\nheliospheric conditions consisting in very fast solar wind streams (~1000 km/s)\nand intense fluxes of solar energetic particles. We speculated that anomalous\ndynamics of the magnetosphere could be well described by the models if the He\nabundance in the solar wind was assumed to be >20%, which is well appropriate\nfor erupting filaments and which is in agreement with the upper 27% threshold\nfor the He/H ratio obtained from Cluster measurements.\n","Comment: Keywords: erupting filament, geomagnetic storm, magnetosphere\n  boundary layers, ring current decay.

These systems are built by taking the driver reaction times into\naccount. However, most of the existing literature focuses on characterizing how\ndriver reaction times vary across an entire population. Therefore, many of the\nwarnings that are given turn out to be false alarms. A false alarm occurs\nwhenever a warning is sent, but it is not needed. This would nagate any safety\nbenefit of the system, and could even reduce the overall safety if warnings\nbecome a distraction. In this paper, we propose our solution to address the\ndescribed problem; First, we briefly describe our method for estimating the\ndistribution of brake response times for a particular driver using data from a\nVehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) system. Then, we investigate how brake\nresponse times of individual drivers can be used in collision warning\nalgorithms to reduce false alarm rates while still maintaining a high level of\nsafety. This will yield a system that is overall more reliable and trustworthy\nfor drivers, which could lead to wider adoption and applicability for V2V/V2I\ncommunication systems. Moreover, we show how false alarm rate varies with\nrespect to probability of accident. Our simulation results show that by\nindividualizing collision warnings the number of false alarms can be reduced\nmore than $50\\%$.

A lot of researches on the structures and processes on\nreal and artificial fractal complex networks have been done, drawing an analogy\nto critical phenomena. However, the non-Markovian dynamics on fractal networks\nhas not been understood well yet. We here study the self-avoiding walk on\ncomplex fractal networks through the mapping of the self-avoiding walk to the\nn-vector model by a generating function formalism. First, we analytically\ncalculate the critical exponent {\\nu} and the effective coordination number\n(the connective constant) by a renormalization-group analysis in various\nfractal dimensions. We find that the exponent {\\nu} is equal to the exponent of\ndisplacement, which describes the speed of diffusion in terms of the shortest\ndistance. Second, by obtaining an exact solution, we present an example which\nsupports the well-known conjecture that the universality class of the\nself-avoiding walk is not determined only by a fractal dimension. Our finding\nsuggests that the scaling theory of polymers can be applied to graphs which\nlack the Euclidian distance as well. Furthermore, the self-avoiding walk has\nbeen exactly solved only on a few lattices embedded in the Euclidian space, but\nwe show that consideration on general graphs can simplify analytic calculations\nand leads to a better understanding of critical phenomena. The scaling theory\nof the self-avoiding path will shed light on the relationship between path\nnumeration problems in graph theory and statistical nature of paths.\n","Comment: Master's Thesis, 56 pages"]}]

As practiced, NHST has been characterized as a\nnull ritual that is overused and too often misapplied and misinterpreted. NHST\nis in fact a patchwork of two fundamentally different classical statistical\ntesting models, often blended with some wishful quasi-Bayesian interpretations.\nThis is undoubtedly a major reason why NHST is very often misunderstood. But\nNHST also has intrinsic logical problems and the epistemic range of the\ninformation provided by such tests is much more limited than most researchers\nrecognize. In this article we introduce to the scientometric community the\ntheoretical origins of NHST, which is mostly absent from standard statistical\ntextbooks, and we discuss some of the most prevalent problems relating to the\npractice of NHST and trace these problems back to the mixup of the two\ndifferent theoretical origins. Finally, we illustrate some of the\nmisunderstandings with examples from the scientometric literature and bring\nforward some modest recommendations for a more sound practice in quantitative\ndata analysis.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in the journal Scientometrics"]}]

We\npresent flux calibrated IFS observations in H2 1-0 S(1) obtained with\nSINFONI/VLT. Thanks to spatial deconvolution by the PSF and to accurate\ncorrection for uneven slit illumination, we performed a thorough analysis and\nmodeled the morphology, kinematics, and surface brightness. We also compared\nour results with studies in [FeII], [OI], and FUV-pumped H2. The\nlimb-brightened H2 emission in the blue lobe is strikingly similar to\nFUV-pumped H2 imaged 6yr later, confirming that they trace the same hot gas and\nsetting an upper limit of 12km/s on any expansion proper motion. The wide-angle\nH2 rims are at lower blueshifts than probed by narrow long-slit spectra. We\nconfirm that they extend to larger angle and to lower speed the onion-like\nvelocity structure observed in optical atomic lines. The latter is shown to be\nsteady over more/equal than 4yr but undetected in [FeII] by SINFONI, probably\ndue to strong iron depletion. The H2 rim thickness less/equal than 14AU rules\nout excitation by C-shocks, and J-shock speeds are constrained to 10km/s. We\nfind that explaining the H2 wide-angle emission with a shocked layer requires\neither a recent outburst (15yr) into a pre-existing ambient outflow or an\nexcessive wind mass flux. A slow photoevaporative wind from the dense\nirradiated disk surface and an MHD disk wind heated by ambipolar diffusion seem\nto be more promising and need to be modeled in more detail.\n"]}]
