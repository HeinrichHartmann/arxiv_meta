Recently, a new paradigm has emerged with the advent of\nsymmetry-protected surface states on the boundary of topological insulators,\nenabling the creation of electronic systems with novel properties. For example,\ntime reversal symmetry (TRS) endows the massless charge carriers on the surface\nof a three-dimensional topological insulator with helicity, locking the\norientation of their spin relative to their momentum. Weakly breaking this\nsymmetry generates a gap on the surface, resulting in charge carriers with\nfinite effective mass and exotic spin textures. Analogous manipulations of the\none-dimensional boundary states of a two-dimensional topological insulator are\nalso possible, but have yet to be observed in the leading candidate materials.\nHere, we demonstrate experimentally that charge neutral monolayer graphene\ndisplays a new type of quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, previously thought to\nexist only in TRS topological insulators, when it is subjected to a very large\nmagnetic field angled with respect to the graphene plane. Unlike in the TRS\ncase, the QSH presented here is protected by a spin-rotation symmetry that\nemerges as electron spins in a half-filled Landau level are polarized by the\nlarge in-plane magnetic field. The properties of the resulting helical edge\nstates can be modulated by balancing the applied field against an intrinsic\nantiferromagnetic instability, which tends to spontaneously break the\nspin-rotation symmetry. In the resulting canted antiferromagnetic (CAF) state,\nwe observe transport signatures of gapped edge states, which constitute a new\nkind of one-dimensional electronic system with tunable band gap and associated\nspin-texture.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 10 figures including supplementary information"]}]

Hydrostatic mass is\none of the most common methods for estimating the masses of individual galaxy\nclusters, which suffer from biases due to departures from hydrostatic\nequilibrium. Using a large, mass-limited sample of massive galaxy clusters from\na high-resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, in this work we show\nthat in addition to turbulent and bulk gas velocities, acceleration of gas\nintroduces biases in the hydrostatic mass estimate of galaxy clusters. In\nunrelaxed clusters, the acceleration bias is comparable to the bias due to\nnon-thermal pressure associated with merger-induced turbulent and bulk gas\nmotions. In relaxed clusters, the mean mass bias due to acceleration is small\n(<3%), but the scatter in the mass bias can be reduced by accounting for gas\nacceleration. Additionally, this acceleration bias is greater in the outskirts\nof higher redshift clusters where mergers are more frequent and clusters are\naccreting more rapidly. Since gas acceleration cannot be observed directly, it\nintroduces an irreducible bias for hydrostatic mass estimates. This\nacceleration bias places limits on how well we can recover cluster masses from\nfuture X-ray and microwave observations. We discuss implications for cluster\nmass estimates based on X-ray, Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, and gravitational\nlensing observations and their impact on cluster cosmology.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures, 1 table; Updated to match version accepted by ApJ"]}]

The constraints imposed\non the scheme are based on the linear receiver since conventional IA assumes\nGaussian signaling. However, when the transmitters employ Finite Alphabet (FA)\nsignaling, neither the conventional IA precoders nor the linear receiver are\noptimal structures. Therefore, a novel Fractional Interference Alignment (FIA)\nscheme is introduced when FA signals are used, where the alignment constraints\nare now based on the non-linear, minimum distance (MD) detector. Since DoF is\ndefined only as signal-to-noise ratio tends to infinity, we introduce a new\nmetric called SpAC (number of Symbols transmitted-per-transmit\nAntenna-per-Channel use) for analyzing the FIA scheme. The maximum SpAC is one,\nand the FIA achieves any value of SpAC in the range [0,1]. The key motivation\nfor this work is that numerical simulations with FA signals and MD detector for\nfixed SpAC (=1/2, as in IA) over a set of optimization problems, like\nminimizing bit error rate or maximizing the mutual information, achieves a\nsignificantly better error rate performance when compared to the existing\nalgorithms that minimize mean square error or maximize signal-to-interference\nplus noise ratio.\n"]}]

In particular, magnetic\nreconnection during collisionless, stressed $X$-point collapse for varying\nout-of-plane guide-fields is studied using a kinetic, 2.5D, fully\nelectromagnetic, relativistic particle-in-cell numerical code. Cases for both\nopen and closed boundary conditions are investigated, where magnetic flux and\nparticles are lost and conserved respectively. It is found that reconnection\nrates and out-of-plane currents in the $X$-point increase more rapidly and peak\nsooner in the closed boundary case, but higher values are reached in the open\nboundary case. The normalized reconnection rate is fast: 0.10-0.25. In the open\nboundary case an increase of guide-field yields later onsets in the\nreconnection peak rates, while in the closed boundary case initial peak rates\noccur sooner but are suppressed. The reconnection current increases for low\nguide-fields but then decreases similarly. In the open boundary case, for\nguide-fields of the order of the in-plane magnetic field, the generation of\nelectron vortices occurs. Possible causes of the vortex generation, based on\nthe flow of particles in the diffusion region and localized plasma heating, are\ndiscussed. Before peak reconnection onset, oscillations in the out-of-plane\nelectric field at the $X$-point are found, ranging in frequency from\napproximately 1 to 2 $\\omega_{pe}$ and coinciding with oscillatory\nreconnection. These oscillations are found to be part of a larger wave pattern.\nMapping the out-of-plane electric field over time and applying 2D Fourier\ntransforms reveals that the waves predominantly correspond to the ordinary mode\nand may correspond to observable radio waves such as solar radio burst fine\nstructure spikes.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Physics of Plasmas"]}]

The performance of\nthis infrastructure has a direct influence on the lives of most of citizens in\ndeveloped regions by providing a critical lifeline between communities and the\ntransportation of goods and services, and as a critical component of the\ntransportation network, bridges have received a lot of attention regarding\ncondition assessment and maintenance practices. Despite successful\nimplementation of advanced evaluation techniques, what is still lacking is a\nfundamental understanding of the system behavior in the presence of\ndeteriorating conditions that can be used for preservation decision-making.\nThis paper aims to present a performance-based framework that can be used to\ncharacterize the behavior of in-service bridge superstructures. In order to\nmeasure the bridge system performance with deteriorating conditions,\nsystem-level behavior of a representative composite steel girder bridge,\ndegraded with three common damage scenarios was investigated in this study.\nResults obtained from validated numerical analysis demonstrated significant\nimpact of integrated damage mechanisms on the ultimate capacity, redundancy and\nsystem ductility of the simulated bridge superstructure. It is expected that\nthe proposed framework for evaluating system behavior will provide a first step\nfor establishing a critical linkage between design, maintenance, and\nrehabilitation of highway bridges, which are uncoupled in current\ninfrastructure decision-making processes.\n","Comment: Transportation Research Board 93rd Annual Meeting"]}]

Assuming gauge invariance, we classify magnetic fields with compact\nsupport into being trapping or non-trapping. We study spectral properties of\nthe associated magnetic Laplacian for a class of Riemannian metrics which\nincludes complete hyperbolic metrics of finite volume. When $B$ is\nnon-trapping, the magnetic Laplacian has nonempty essential spectrum. Using\nMourre theory, we show the absence of singular continuous spectrum and the\nlocal finiteness of the point spectrum. When $B$ is trapping, the spectrum is\ndiscrete and obeys the Weyl law. The existence of trapping magnetic fields with\ncompact support depends on cohomological conditions, indicating a new and very\nstrong long-range effect.\n  In the non-gauge invariant case, we exhibit a strong Aharonov-Bohm effect. On\nhyperbolic surfaces with at least two cusps, we show that the magnetic\nLaplacian associated to every magnetic field with compact support has purely\ndiscrete spectrum for some choices of the vector potential, while other choices\nlead to a situation of limit absorption principle.\n  We also study perturbations of the metric.
