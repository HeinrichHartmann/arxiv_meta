The proof uses a potential function related to a\ndeterminant. The result does not explain why the normalized Fourier transform\n(of unit determinant) should be difficult to compute in the same model. Hence,\nthe result is not scale insensitive.\n  More recently, Ailon (2013) showed that if only unitary 2-by-2 gates are\nused, and additionally no extra memory is allowed, then the normalized Fourier\ntransform requires $\\Omega(n\\log n)$ steps. This rather limited result is also\nsensitive to scaling, but highlights the complexity inherent in the Fourier\ntransform arising from introducing entropy, unlike, say, the identity matrix\n(which is as complex as the Fourier transform using Morgenstern's arguments,\nunder proper scaling).\n  In this work we extend the arguments of Ailon (2013). In the first extension,\nwhich is also the main contribution, we provide a lower bound for computing any\nscaling of the Fourier transform. Our restriction is that, the composition of\nall gates up to any point must be a well conditioned linear transformation. The\nlower bound is $\\Omega(R^{-1}n\\log n)$, where $R$ is the uniform condition\nnumber. Second, we assume extra space is allowed, as long as it contains\ninformation of bounded norm at the end of the computation.\n  The main technical contribution is an extension of matrix entropy used in\nAilon (2013) for unitary matrices to a potential function computable for any\nmatrix, using Shannon entropy on \"quasi-probabilities\".\n"]}]

Each firm tries to maximize\nits utility---a function of the production cost as well as market price of the\nproduct---by deciding on the amount of production. In today's dynamic and\ndiverse economy, many firms often compete in more than one market\nsimultaneously, i.e., each market might be shared among a subset of these\nfirms. In this situation, a bipartite graph models the access restriction where\nfirms are on one side, markets are on the other side, and edges demonstrate\nwhether a firm has access to a market or not.

First, we carefully\ndesign a potential function for NCC, when the price functions for markets are\nlinear functions of the production in that market. However, for nonlinear price\nfunctions, this approach is not feasible. We model the problem as a nonlinear\ncomplementarity problem in this case, and design a polynomial-time algorithm\nthat finds an equilibrium of the game for strongly convex cost functions and\nstrongly monotone revenue functions. We also explore the class of price\nfunctions that ensures strong monotonicity of the revenue function, and show it\nconsists of a broad class of functions. Moreover, we discuss the uniqueness of\nequilibria in both of these cases which means our algorithms find the unique\nequilibria of the games.

Following a technique introduced by\nHarada and Tsutsui, we show that the Proca and the Chiral Schwinger models may\nboth be viewed as gauge-fixed versions of genuinely gauge- invariant models.\nThis leads to the proposal that any consistent Abelian vector model with no\ngauge symmetry can be understood as a gauge theory that had its gauge fixed,\nwhich establishes an equivalence between gauge-invariant and non\ngauge-invariant models. Finally, we show that a gauge-invariant version of the\nchiral Schwinger model, after integrating out the fermionic degrees of freedom,\ncan be identified with the two-dimensional Stueckelberg model without the gauge\nfixing term.\n","Comment: 20 pages"]}]

In particular, two important technological\nevolutions are happening at the ends of the computing spectrum: at the \"small\"\nscale, processors now include an increasing number of independent execution\nunits (cores), at the point that a mere CPU can be considered a parallel\nshared-memory computer; at the \"large\" scale, the Cloud Computing paradigm\nallows applications to scale by offering resources from a large pool on a\npay-as-you-go model. Multi-core processors and Clouds both require applications\nto be suitably modified to take advantage of the features they provide. In this\npaper, we analyze the state of the art of parallel and distributed simulation\ntechniques, and assess their applicability to multi-core architectures or\nClouds. It turns out that most of the current approaches exhibit limitations in\nterms of usability and adaptivity which may hinder their application to these\nnew computing architectures.

These extensions are new types\nof moment and cumulant generating functions, respectively, the latter\ncorresponding to the cumulants which are additive under the so-called filtered\nconvolution on the free *-algebra on two generators. This algebra plays the\nrole of a ``noncommutative plane'' built on the ``classical real line'' and the\n``boolean real line''. The restrictions of the cumulant generating function to\nthe commutative subsemigroups generated by single generators give the logarithm\nof the Fourier transform and the K-transform in the boolean case, respectively.\nIn turn, the moment generating function is a ``semigroup interpolation''\nbetween the Fourier transform and the Cauchy transform. Using suitable weight\nfunction $W$ on the semigroup, both generating functions become elements of the\nBanach algebra $l^{1}(FS(2),W)$. The main results of the paper are based on the\nnew combinatorics developed for the cumulants, the Moebius function and the\nmoment-cumulant formulas.\n","Comment: 32 pages, latex, no figures"]}]

In particular, they\nallow us to compute free additive convolutions of compactly supported measures\nwithout using free cumulants or R-transforms.

We show that the free product of rooted\ngraphs is canonically associated with free independence, which completes the\nproof of the conjecture that there exists a product of rooted graphs\ncanonically associated with each notion of noncommutative independence which\narises in the axiomatic theory. Using the `orthogonal product' of rooted\ngraphs, we decompose the branches of the free product of rooted graphs as\n`alternating orthogonal products'. This leads to alternating decompositions of\nthe free product itself, with the star product or the comb product followed by\northogonal products. These decompositions correspond to the recently studied\ndecompositions of the free additive convolution of probability measures in\nterms boolean and orthogonal convolutions, or monotone and orthogonal\nconvolutions. We also introduce a new type of `quantum decomposition' of the\nfree product of graphs, where the distance partition of the set of vertices is\ntaken with respect to a set of vertices instead of a single vertex. We show\nthat even in the case of widely studied graphs this yields new and more\ncomplete information on their spectral properties, like spectral measures of a\n(usually infinite) set of cyclic vectors under the action of the adjacency\nmatrix.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 8 figures"]}]
