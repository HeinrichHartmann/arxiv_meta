Two-timescale\nbehavior is characterized by a slow-fast splitting of the tangent bundle for a\nstate space region. The slow-fast splitting is defined using finite-time\nLyapunov exponents and vectors, guided by the asymptotic theory of partially\nhyperbolic sets, with important modifications for the finite-time case; for\nexample, finite-time Lyapunov analysis relies more heavily on the Lyapunov\nvectors due to their relatively fast convergence compared to that of the\ncorresponding exponents. The splitting is used to locate points on normally\nhyperbolic center manifolds. Determining manifolds from tangent bundle\nstructure is more generally applicable than approaches, such as the singular\nperturbation method, that require special normal forms or other a priori\nknowledge.

Any biophysical size-regulation scheme operates in a noisy\nenvironment and must be robust to other cellular dynamics and fluctuations.\nThis work develops theory of filament length regulation inspired by recent\nexperiments on kinesin-8 motor proteins, which move with directional bias on\nmicrotubule filaments and alter microtubule dynamics. Purified kinesin-8 motors\ncan depolymerize chemically-stabilized microtubules. In the length-dependent\ndepolymerization model, the rate of depolymerization tends to increase with\nfilament length, because long filaments accumulate more motors at their tips\nand therefore shorten more quickly. When balanced with a constant filament\ngrowth rate, this mechanism can lead to a fixed polymer length. However, the\nmechanism by which kinesin-8 motors affect the length of dynamic microtubules\nin cells is less clear. We study the more biologically realistic problem of\nmicrotubule dynamic instability modulated by a motor-dependent increase in the\nfilament catastrophe frequency. This leads to a significant decrease in the\nmean filament length and a narrowing of the filament length distribution.

A technology that maintains\ncold conditions while allowing larger apertures has been long-awaited. We\npropose radio-transparent multi-layer insulation (RT-MLI), composed from a set\nof stacked insulating layers.

Star-forming satellites at\ndifferent stellar masses form a tight sequence in the average overdensity -\nmetallicity plane, which covers the entire observed range of metallicities and\nstellar masses. This remarkable result appears to imply that there exists a\nuniversal evolutionary path for all star-forming satellites, regardless of\ntheir stellar masses. The strong correlation between over-density and\nmetallicity for star-forming satellites indicates that the gas inflow of\nsatellite galaxies is progressively metal-enriched in denser regions.

This problem can be solved by removing low\nmass galaxies by merging them into more massive galaxies. We quantify this\nprocess by introducing the specific merger mass rate (sMMR) as the specific\nrate of mass added to a given galaxy through mergers. For a modest negative\nvalue of the logarithmic slope of the sSFR-mass relation of beta ~ -0.1, an\naverage sMMR ~ 0.1sSFR across the population is required to keep the faint-end\nslope constant with epoch, as observed. This in turn implies a merger rate of ~\n0.2sSFR for major mergers, which is consistent with the available observational\nestimates. More negative values of beta require higher sMMR and higher merger\nrates, and the steepening of the mass function becomes impossible to control\nfor beta < ~ -0.6, for an observed value of the faint-end slope of ~ -1.4. The\nclose link that is required between the in situ sSFR and the sMMR probably\narises because both are closely linked to the buildup of dark matter haloes.\nThese new findings further develop the formalism for the evolving galaxy\npopulation that we introduced earlier, and show how striking symmetries in the\ngalaxy population can emerge as the result of deep links between the physical\nprocesses involved.\n","Comment: Accepted for Publication in the Astrophysical Journal"]}]

While load-balanced switches can achieve\nsuch scalability, they suffer from a fundamental packet reordering problem.\nExisting proposals either suffer from poor worst-case packet delays or require\nsophisticated matching mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a new family of\nstable load-balanced switches called \"Sprinklers\" that has comparable\nimplementation cost and performance as the baseline load-balanced switch, but\nyet can guarantee packet ordering.

At the core of Sprinklers are\ntwo key innovations: a randomized way to determine the \"fat path\" for each VOQ,\nand a way to determine its \"fatness\" roughly in proportion to the rate of the\nVOQ. These innovations enable Sprinklers to achieve near-perfect load-balancing\nunder arbitrary admissible traffic.

To this end, PCA is used to\nrepresent affine-warped patches as PCA-patch vectors for its compactness and\nefficiency.

Such a linear subspace\nrepresentation could accurately capture the underlying information of a\nkeypoint (local structure) under multiple views without sacrificing its\ndistinctiveness. To accelerate the computation of ASR descriptor, a fast\napproximate algorithm is proposed by moving the most computational part (ie,\nwarp patch under various affine transformations) to an offline training stage.\nExperimental results show that ASR is not only better than the state-of-the-art\ndescriptors under various image transformations, but also performs well without\na dedicated affine invariant detector when dealing with viewpoint changes.\n","Comment: To Appear in the 2014 European Conference on Computer Vision"]}]

A network is constructed of vertices representing\nincrements between subsequent $RR$-intervals, and edges which connect adjacent\n$RR$-increments. Two modes of visualization of such a network are proposed. The\nmethod described is applied to nocturnal Holter signals recorded from healthy\nyoung people and from cardiac transplant recipients. Additionally, the analysis\nis performed on surrogate data: shuffled RR-intervals (to display short-range\ndependence), and shuffled phases of the Fourier Transform of RR-intervals (to\nfilter out linear dependences). Important nonlinear properties of autonomic\nnocturnal regulation in short-term variability in healthy young persons are\nassociated with $RR$-increments: accelerations and decelerations of a size\ngreater than about 35 ms.

In this paper, we show that, to the first post-Newtonian level,\nthere is also a gravitolectric clock effect induced by the static component of\nthe gravitational field of a non-rotating body. Indeed, the difference of the\ndraconitic periods of two test particles moving in opposite directions along\nidentical quasi-circular orbits turns out to be non-vanishing. It depends on\nthe shape, the size and the pericenter location of the orbit, but it is\nindependent of the initial position along it.
