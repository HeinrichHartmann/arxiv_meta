We demonstrate that the radiation absorption assisted by the\ncarrier-carrier scattering can be stronger than the Drude absorption due to the\ncarrier scattering on disorder. Since the intraband absorption of radiation\neffectively competes with its interband amplification, this can substantially\naffect the conditions of the negative dynamic conductivity in the pumped\ngraphene and, hence, the interband terahertz and infrared lasing. We find the\nthreshold values of the frequency and quasi-Fermi energy of nonequilibrium\ncarriers corresponding to the onset of negative dynamic conductivity. The\nobtained results show that the effect of carrier-carrier scattering shifts the\nthreshold frequency of the radiation amplification in pumped graphene to higher\nvalues. In particular, the negative dynamic conductivity is attainable at the\nfrequencies above 6 THz in graphene on SiO2 substrates at room temperature.

With the help of stochastic geometry, we develop an analytically\ntractable framework to analyze the interference and then throughput for the two\nkinds of users in the considered scenario. The results obtained by the\nframework reveal that enabling D2D communication does improve the per user\nthroughput and that a proper guard zone can further significantly increase the\naverage throughput of both kinds of users.

Probabilistic graphical models are very useful for\nmining and discovering data insights, but they are not scalable enough to be\nsuitable for big data problems. Bayesian Networks particularly demonstrate this\nlimitation when their data is represented using few random variables while each\nrandom variable has a massive set of values. With hierarchical data - data that\nis arranged in a treelike structure with several levels - one would expect to\nsee hundreds of thousands or millions of values distributed over even just a\nsmall number of levels. When modeling this kind of hierarchical data across\nlarge data sets, Bayesian networks become infeasible for representing the\nprobability distributions for the following reasons: i) Each level represents a\nsingle random variable with hundreds of thousands of values, ii) The number of\nlevels is usually small, so there are also few random variables, and iii) The\nstructure of the network is predefined since the dependency is modeled top-down\nfrom each parent to each of its child nodes, so the network would contain a\nsingle linear path for the random variables from each parent to each child\nnode.

We find that the fixed point of the system\ndepends on a primary free parameter of the model: the ratio between the rate of\nremoval of mini-circles from the network (R) and their (re)attachment rate (A).\nThe final topological state is found to be that of a marginally linked network\nstructure in which the fraction of mini-circles linked to the largest connected\ncomponent approaches unity as R/A decreases.

Using complex wave numbers of the Bloch wave\nfunction, we derive an analytical expression for the edge state localized near\nthe edge of a semi-infinite honeycomb lattice with a straight edge. For the\ncomparison of the edge type effects, two types of the edges are considered in\nthis calculation; one is a zigzag edge and the other is an armchair edge. The\ncomplex wave numbers and the boundary condition give the analytic equations for\nthe energies and the wave functions of the edge states. The numerical solutions\nof the equations reveal the intriguing spatial behaviors of the edge state. We\ndefine an edge-state width for analyzing the spatial variation of the\nedge-state wave function. Our results show that the edge-state width can be\neasily controlled by a couple of parameters such as the spin-orbit coupling and\nthe sublattice potential. The parameter dependences of the edge-state width\nshow substantial differences depending on the edge types. These demonstrate\nthat, even if the edge states are protected by the topological property of the\nbulk, their detailed properties are still discriminated by their edges.

About their relative strength with\nrespect to \"bounded width in one measure implies bounded width in the other\"\nmany problems remain unsolved. Only some results separating directed width\nmeasures are known. We give an almost complete picture of this relation. For\nthis, we consider the cops and robber games characterising DAG-width and\ndirected tree width (up to a constant factor). For DAG-width games, it is an\nopen question whether the robber-monotonicity cost (the difference between the\nminimal numbers of cops capturing the robber in the general and in the monotone\ncase) can be bounded by any function. Examples show that this function (if it\nexists) is at least $f(k) > 4k/3$ (Kreutzer, Ordyniak 2008). We approach a\nsolution by defining weak monotonicity and showing that if $k$ cops win weakly\nmonotonically, then $O(k^2)$ cops win monotonically. It follows that bounded\nKelly-width implies bounded DAG-width, which has been open since the definition\nof Kelly-width by Hunter and Kreutzer in 2008. For directed tree width games we\nshow that, unexpectedly, the cop-monotonicity cost (no cop revisits any vertex)\nis not bounded by any function. This separates directed tree width from D-width\ndefined by Safari in 2005, refuting his conjecture.\n"]}]
