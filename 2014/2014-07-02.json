A wide class of\nHamiltonians, comprising interactions and hybridization of arbitrary momentum\ndependence between different fermion species, can be treated in a comprehensive\nmanner. This is the case, as both the intra-species and the inter-species\ninteractions are treated on equally rigorous footing, which is accomplished via\nthe introduction of a new quantum index attached to the fermions. The index is\nconsistent with known fermionic physics, and allows for heretofore unaccounted\nfor fermion-fermion correlations. We have derived the finite temperature\nversion of the theory, thus obtaining the renormalized quasiparticle dispersion\nrelations, and we discuss the appearance of charge and spin density wave order.\n  We present numerical solutions for two electron species in 2 dimensions.\nBased on these solutions, we show that, for equivalent spin up and down\nfermions, the Fermi occupation factor (per spin) equals 1/2 deep in the Fermi\nsea.

A cluster embedded in a self-consistent bath is studied. With\nincreasing Coulomb repulsion, U, the antinodal point [k=(pi,0)] displays a\ngradual suppression of spectral density of states around the Fermi energy which\nis not observed at the nodal point [k=(pi/2,pi/2)]. The opening of the\nantinodal pseudogap is related to the internal structure of the cluster and the\nmuch weaker bath-cluster couplings at the antinodal than nodal point. The role\nplayed by internal cluster correlations is elucidated from a simple four-level\nmodel. For small U, the cluster levels form Kondo singlets with their baths\nleading to a peak in the spectral density. As U is increased a localized state\nis formed localizing the electrons in the cluster. If this cluster localized\nstate is non-degenerate, the Kondo effect is destroyed and a pseudogap opens up\nin the spectra at the anti-nodal point. The pseudogap can be understood in\nterms of destructive interference between different paths for electrons hopping\nbetween the cluster and the bath. However, electrons at the nodal points remain\nin Kondo states up to larger U since they are more strongly coupled to the\nbath. The strong correlation between the (pi,0) and (0,pi) cluster levels in\nthe localized state leads to a large correlation energy gain which is important\nfor localizing electrons and opening up a pseudogap. Such scenario is in\ncontrast with two independent Mott transitions found in two-band systems with\ndifferent bandwidths in which the localized cluster electron does not correlate\nstrongly with any other cluster electron for intermediate U.

We present measurements of\nthe conductance slope for various InAs/GaSb heterojunctions via two-terminal\nelectrical measurements, which removes three-terminal parasitics and enables\ndirect study on the effect of microstructure on tunnelling. Using this, we can\npredict how subthreshold swings in TFETs can depend on microstructure. We also\ndemonstrate growth and electrical characterization for structures grown by\nmetalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) - a generally more scalable\nprocess compared to molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). We determine that misfit\ndislocations and point defects near the interface can lead to energy states in\nthe band-gap and local band bending that result in trap-assisted leakage routes\nand nonuniform band alignment across the junction area that lower the steepness\nof the conductance slope. Despite the small lattice mismatch, misfit\ndislocations still form in InAs on GaSb due to relaxation as a result of large\nstrain from intermixed compositions. This can be circumvented by growing GaSb\non InAs, straining the GaSb underlayer, or lowering the InAs growth temperature\nin the region of the interface. The conductance slope can also be improved by\nannealing the samples at higher temperatures, which we believe acts to\nannihilate point defects and average out major fluctuations in band alignment\nacross the interface.

Observationally, for\nexoplanets with known mass and radius it is possible to estimate the bulk\ncomposition via internal structure models. We first determine the reduction\nfactor of the ISM grain opacity f_opa that leads to gas accretion rates\nconsistent with grain evolution models.

The latter describes the effect of an\nincrease of the star formation rate caused by the encounter. We demonstrate\nthat large-scale streaming, with associated deviations in the rotation curve,\ncan result in an enhancement of the anisotropic turbulent (ordered) magnetic\nfield strength, mainly along the azimuthal direction, leading to a significant\ntemporary increase of the total magnetic energy during the encounter; the\nrepresentation of an increase in star formation rate has an additional strong\neffect. In contrast to expectations, the large-scale (regular) magnetic field\nstructure is not significantly destroyed by the encounter. It may be somewhat\nweakened for a relatively short period, and its direction after the encounter\nmay be reversed. The encounter causes enhanced total and polarized emission\nwithout increase of the regular magnetic field strength. The increase of\nsynchrotron emission caused by the large-scale streaming can be comparable to\nthe effect of the increase of the star formation rate, depending on the choice\nof parameters.The effects of the encounter on the total magnetic field energy\nlast only slightly longer than the duration of the encounter (ca. 1 Gyr).\n","Comment: 9 pages, 11 figures minor changes in response to referee's\n  comments+linguistic/stylistic changes"]}]

Spectral differential imaging (SDI) is part of the\nobserving strategy of current and future high-contrast imaging instruments. It\naims to reduce the stellar speckles that prevent the detection of cool planets\nby using in/out methane-band images. It attenuates the signature of off-axis\ncompanions to the star, such as angular differential imaging (ADI). However,\nthis attenuation depends on the spectral properties of the low-mass companions\nwe are searching for. The implications of this particularity on estimating the\ndetection limits have been poorly explored so far. Aims. We perform an imaging\nsurvey to search for cool (Teff<1000-1300 K) giant planets at separations as\nclose as 5-10 AU. We also aim to assess the sensitivity limits in SDI data\ntaking the photometric bias into account. This will lead to a better view of\nthe SDI performance. Methods. We observed a selected sample of 16 stars (age <\n200 Myr, d < 25 pc) with the phase-mask coronagraph, SDI, and ADI modes of\nVLT/NaCo. Results. We do not detect any companions. As for the sensitivity\nlimits, we argue that the SDI residual noise cannot be converted into mass\nlimits because it represents a differential flux, unlike the case of\nsingle-band images. This results in degeneracies for the mass limits, which may\nbe removed with the use of single-band constraints. We instead employ a method\nof directly determining the mass limits. The survey is sensitive to cool giant\nplanets beyond 10 AU for 65% and 30 AU for 100% of the sample. Conclusions. For\nclose-in separations, the optimal regime for SDI corresponds to SDI flux ratios\n>2. According to the BT-Settl model, this translates into Teff<800 K. The\nmethods described here can be applied to the data interpretation of SPHERE.

In contrast, helium-dominated post-AGB stars\nand their evolution are yet not understood. A small group of very hot,\nhelium-dominated stars is formed by O(He)-type stars.

The existence of\nplanetary nebulae that do not show helium enrichment around every other O(He)\nstar, precludes a merger origin for these stars.

It is found that BPs within active regions display attenuated velocity\ndistributions with an average horizontal velocity of ~0.6 km/s, compared to the\nquiet region which had an average velocity of 0.9 km/s.

In a BM approach, image frames in a video sequence are divided into\nblocks. For each block in the current frame, the best matching block is\nidentified inside a region of the previous frame, aiming to minimize the sum of\nabsolute differences (SAD). Unfortunately, the SAD evaluation is\ncomputationally expensive and represents the most consuming operation in the BM\nprocess. Therefore, BM motion estimation can be approached as an optimization\nproblem, where the goal is to find the best matching block within a search\nspace. The simplest available BM method is the full search algorithm (FSA)\nwhich finds the most accurate motion vector through an exhaustive computation\nof SAD values for all elements of the search window. Recently, several fast BM\nalgorithms have been proposed to reduce the number of SAD operations by\ncalculating only a fixed subset of search locations at the price of poor\naccuracy. In this paper, a new algorithm based on Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)\noptimization is proposed to reduce the number of search locations in the BM\nprocess. In our algorithm, the computation of search locations is drastically\nreduced by considering a fitness calculation strategy which indicates when it\nis feasible to calculate or only estimate new search locations. Since the\nproposed algorithm does not consider any fixed search pattern or any other\nmovement assumption as most of other BM approaches do, a high probability for\nfinding the true minimum (accurate motion vector) is expected. Conducted\nsimulations show that the proposed method achieves the best balance over other\nfast BM algorithms, in terms of both estimation accuracy and computational\ncost.\n","Comment: 22 Pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:1405.4721, arXiv:1406.4484"]}]

To solve nonlinear\n  equations, the GMsFEM is used to represent the solution on a coarse\n  grid with multiscale basis functions computed offline.

Gene translation includes several steps. During the\nelongation step, ribosomes move along the mRNA in a sequential manner and link\namino-acids together in the corresponding order to produce the proteins.\n  The homogeneous ribosome flow model(HRFM) is a deterministic computational\nmodel for translation-elongation under the assumption of constant elongation\nrates along the mRNA chain. The HRFM is described by a set of n first-order\nnonlinear ordinary differential equations, where n represents the number of\nsites along the mRNA chain.

This means that an incredibly large number of particles may be\nneeded to appropriately control the error in very large scale filtering\nproblems. The computational burden required is often prohibitive in practice.\nRebeschini and Van Handel (2013) analyse a new approach for particle filtering\nin large-scale dynamic random fields. Through a suitable localisation operation\nthey reduce the dependence of the error to the size of local sets, each of\nwhich may be considerably smaller than the dimension of the original system.\nThe drawback is that this localisation operation introduces a bias. In this\nwork, we propose a modified version of Rebeschini and Van Handel's blocked\nparticle filter. We introduce a new degree of freedom allowing us to reduce the\nbias. We do this by enlarging the space during the update phase and thus\nreducing the amount of dependent information thrown away due to localisation.\nBy designing an appropriate tradeoff between the various tuning parameters it\nis possible to reduce the total error bound via allowing a temporary\nenlargement of the update operator without really increasing the overall\ncomputational burden.\n"]}]

Here, we explore this by\nusing multi-type branching processes to calculate the basic reproductive ratios\nand the extinction probabilities for solitary versus eusocial reproductive\nstrategies. In order to derive precise mathematical results, we use a simple\nhaploid, asexual model. In general, we show that eusocial reproductive\nstrategies are unlikely to materialize unless large fitness advantages are\ngained by the production of only a few workers.

In these cases, no\neusocial parameters exist that would reduce their probability of extinction.\nOur results help to explain why the number of solitary species exceeds that of\neusocial ones: eusociality is a high risk, high reward strategy, while solitary\nreproduction is better at risk management.\n","Comment: Comments are highly appreciated, and collaborations on further\n  followup work are also extremely welcome.

This thesis will begin with a Nahm-like\nconstruction for selfdual strings using loop space, the space of loops on\nspacetime. This construction maps solutions of the Basu-Harvey equation, the\nBPS equation arising in the description of multiple M2-branes, to solutions of\na selfdual string equation on loop space. Furthermore, all ingredients of the\nconstruction reduce to those of the ordinary Nahm construction when\ncompactified on a circle with all loops restricted to those wrapping the\ncircle. The rest of this thesis, however, will not involve loop space. We will\nsee a Nahm-like construction for the case of infinitely many selfdual strings,\nsuspended between two M5-branes. This is possible since the limit taken renders\nthe fields describing the M5-branes abelian.

Automatic inference of the\nsocial structure in an animal group enables a number of important capabilities,\nincluding: 1) A verifiable measure of how the social structure is affected by\nan intervention such as a change in the environment, or the introduction of\nanother animal, and 2) A potentially significant reduction in person hours\nnormally used for assessing these changes. Social structure in a group is an\nimportant indicator of its members' relative level of access to resources and\nhas interesting implications for an individual's health and learning in groups.\nThere are two main quantitative criteria assessed in order to infer the social\nstructure; Time spent close to conspecifics, and displacements. An interaction\nmatrix is used to represent the total duration of events detected as grooming\nbehavior between any two monkeys. This forms an undirected tie-strength\n(closeness of relationships) graph. A directed graph of hierarchy is\nconstructed by using the well cited assumption of a linear hierarchy for rhesus\nmacaques. Events that contribute to the adjacency matrix for this graph are\nwithdrawals or displacements where a lower ranked monkey moves away from a\nhigher ranked monkey. Displacements are one of the observable behaviors that\ncan act as a strong indication of tie-strength and dominance.

In order to face the\nproblem, the use of sound features to reason on the system from data processing\nis a key step. In the specific case of complex societal systems, sentiment\nanalysis allows to mirror (part of) the affective dimension. However it is not\nreasonable to think that individual sentiment categorization can encompass the\nnew affective phenomena in digital social networks.\n  The present papers addresses the problem of isolating sentiment concepts\nwhich emerge in social networks. In an analogy to Artificial Intelligent\nSingularity, we propose the study and analysis of these new complex sentiment\nstructures and how they are similar to or diverge from classic conceptual\nstructures associated to sentiment lexicons. The conjecture is that it is\nhighly probable that hypercomplex sentiment structures -not explained with\nhuman categorizations- emerge from high dynamic social information networks.\nRoughly speaking, new sentiment can emerge from the new global nervous systems\nas it occurs in humans.\n"]}]

Our qualitative\nstudy of a community of open source software developers revealed a coordination\nsystem characterized by interest-based, asynchronous interaction and knowledge\ntransfer. At the core of asynchronous knowledge transfer, lies the concept of\nquasi-codification, which occurs when rich process knowledge is implicitly\nencoded in work artifacts. Our findings suggest that members are able to more\nselectively form dependencies, monitor the trajectory of projects, and make\ntheir work understandable to others which facilitates coordination. We discuss\ntwo important characteristics that enable coordination activities in a\ntransparent environment: the presence of an imagined audience that dictates the\nway artifacts are crafted, and experience within the environment, that allows\nindividuals to derive knowledge from these artifacts. By showing how\ntransparency influences coordination, this research challenges previous\nconceptions of coordination for complex, collaborative work.\n"]}]

Here\nwe did the rotation curve analysis with two possible choices for the dark\nmatter density profile, namely Burkert and Navarro, Frenk and White profiles.\nThe analysis shows the dark matter distribution favored to Burkert profile\n(cored dark matter). The standard hypothesis for most spiral galaxies are known\nto be embedded in dark matter haloes has now been overshadowed by Modified\nNewtonian Dynamics, known as MOND, the leading alternative of dark matter. MOND\naddresses the problem of a new fundamental constant $a_0$, called the\nacceleration constant, at which acceleration scale of Newton second law fails\nto hold. In this respect, we investigate this issue by testing the rotation\ncurve within the MOND framework with the observations to obtain the reliable\ndisk mass, $M_D$.
