A new fast method, called MAMPOSSt, which performs a maximum\nlikelihood fit of the distribution of observed tracers in projected phase\nspace, is developed and thoroughly tested. MAMPOSSt assumes a shape for the\ngravitational potential, but instead of postulating a shape for the\ndistribution function in terms of energy and angular momentum, or supposing\nGaussian line-of-sight velocity distributions, MAMPOSSt assumes a VA profile\nand a shape for the 3D velocity distribution, here Gaussian. MAMPOSSt requires\nno binning, differentiation, nor extrapolation of the observables. Tests on\ncluster-mass haloes from LambdaCDM cosmological simulations show that, with 500\ntracers, MAMPOSSt is able to jointly recover the virial radius, tracer scale\nradius, dark matter scale radius and outer or constant VA with small bias (<10%\non scale radii and <2% on the two other quantities) and inefficiencies of 10%,\n27%, 48% and 20%, respectively. MAMPOSSt does not perform better when some\nparameters are frozen, and even worse when the virial radius is set to its true\nvalue, which appears to be the consequence of halo triaxiality. The accuracy of\nMAMPOSSt depends weakly on the adopted interloper removal scheme, including an\nefficient iterative Bayesian scheme that we introduce here, which can directly\nobtain the virial radius with as good precision as MAMPOSSt. Our tests show\nthat MAMPOSSt with Gaussian 3D velocities is very competitive with, and up to\n1000x faster than other methods. Hence, MAMPOSSt is a very powerful and rapid\ntool for the mass and anisotropy modeling of systems such as clusters and\ngroups of galaxies, elliptical and dwarf spheroidal galaxies.\n","Comment: MNRAS in press (fixes to eqs [20] and [30] plus minor touch-ups). 21\n  pages, 10 figures, 6 Tables"]}]

In cases of spacelike separation between\nthe sender of a signal and the receiver, whether a receiver measures the local\npart of an entangled state or a disentangled state to access the signal can\ndepend on the reference frame.

Recent\nadvances in nonlinear metric learning have demonstrated the potential power of\nnon-Mahalanobis distance functions, particularly tree-based functions. We\npropose a novel nonlinear metric learning method that uses an iterative,\nhierarchical variant of semi-supervised max-margin clustering to construct a\nforest of cluster hierarchies, where each individual hierarchy can be\ninterpreted as a weak metric over the data. By introducing randomness during\nhierarchy training and combining the output of many of the resulting\nsemi-random weak hierarchy metrics, we can obtain a powerful and robust\nnonlinear metric model. This method has two primary contributions: first, it is\nsemi-supervised, incorporating information from both constrained and\nunconstrained points. Second, we take a relaxed approach to constraint\nsatisfaction, allowing the method to satisfy different subsets of the\nconstraints at different levels of the hierarchy rather than attempting to\nsimultaneously satisfy all of them. This leads to a more robust learning\nalgorithm. We compare our method to a number of state-of-the-art benchmarks on\n$k$-nearest neighbor classification, large-scale image retrieval and\nsemi-supervised clustering problems, and find that our algorithm yields results\ncomparable or superior to the state-of-the-art, and is significantly more\nrobust to noise.\n","Comment: Manuscript submitted to SIGKDD on 21 Feb 2014"]}]

It was addressed that the large ring structure is affected\nby background noises first and then the change of large ring structure affects\nthe small length scale quickly, which directly leads to randomization and\nformation of turbulence. However, what we observed is that the loss of symmetry\nstarts from the middle level rings while the top and bottom rings are still\nsymmetric. The nonsymmetric structure of second level rings will influence the\nsmall length scales at the boundary layer bottom quickly. The symmetry loss at\nthe bottom of the boundary layer is quickly spread to up level through\nejections. This will lead to randomization of the whole flow field. Therefore,\nthe internal instability of multiple level ring structure, especially the\nmiddle ring cycles, is the main reason for flow randomization, but not the\nbackground noise.

It was widely accepted that small length\nvortices were generated by large vortex breakdown. According to our recent DNS,\nwe find that the hairpin vortex structure is very stable and never breaks down\nto small pieces. On the other hand, we recognize that there are strong positive\nspikes besides the ring neck in the spanwise direction. The strongly positive\nspikes are caused by second sweeps which are generated by perfectly circular\nand perpendicularly standing vortex rings. The second sweep brings energy from\nthe invisid region downdraft to the bottom of the boundary layers, which\ngenerates high shear layers around the positive spikes.Since the high shear\nlayer is not stable, all small length scales (turbulence) are generated around\nhigh shear layers especially near the wall surface (bottom of boundary layers).\nThis happens near the ring neck in the streamwise direction and besides the\noriginal vortex legs in the spanwise direction.The small length scales then\nrise up from the wall surface and travel to the upper boundary layer.\n","Comment: 49th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting. arXiv admin note: text overlap\n  with arXiv:1402.5183"]}]

In this context, exact solvers for nonconvex 1D Riemann problems\nare developed. First a scalar conservation law for a nonconvex flux with two\ninflection points is studied. Then the P-system for an isothermal version of\nthe van der Waals gas model is examined in a range of temperatures allowing for\na nonconvex pressure function. Eventually the system of the Euler equations of\ngasdynamics is considered for the polytropic van der Waals gas. In this case, a\nsuitably large specific heat is considered such that the isentropes display a\nlocal loss of convexity near the saturation curve and the critical point. Such\na nonconvex physical model allows for nonclassical waves to appear as a result\nof the change of sign of the fundamental derivative of gasdynamics. The\nsolution of the Riemann problem for the considered real gas model reduces to a\nsystem of two nonlinear equations for the values of the density on the two\nsides of the contact discontinuity, much in the same manner of a recently\nproposed solution method for gases admitting nonlinear wavefields only fully\ngenuine. Solutions containing nonclassical and mixed waves are presented for\nthe three mathematical models. Vacuum formation is described analytically\nincluding the presence of composite rarefaction waves, and to the best of\nauthors knowledge, produced numerically here for the first time.\n","Comment: 104 pages, 71 figures.
