However, it is highly unstable since some cooperators\nmay contribute to a common project but refuse to punish defectors. Centralized\nsanctioning institutions (for example, tax-funded police and criminal courts)\ncan solve this problem by punishing both defectors and cooperators who refuse\nto punish. These institutions have been shown to emerge naturally through\nsocial learning and then displace all other forms of punishment, including peer\npunishment. However, this result provokes a number of questions. If centralized\nsanctioning is so successful, then why do many highly authoritarian states\nsuffer from low levels of cooperation?

And what\nhappens if centralized institutions can be circumvented by individual acts of\nbribery? Here, we consider how corruption influences the evolution of\ncooperation and punishment. Our model shows that the effectiveness of\ncentralized punishment in promoting cooperation breaks down when some actors in\nthe model are allowed to bribe centralized authorities. Counterintuitively,\nincreasing the sanctioning power of the central institution makes things even\nworse, since this prevents peer punishers from playing a role in maintaining\ncooperation. As a result, a weaker centralized authority is actually more\neffective because it allows peer punishment to restore cooperation in the\npresence of corruption. Our results provide an evolutionary rationale for why\npublic goods provision rarely flourishes in polities that rely only on strong\ncentralized institutions. Instead, cooperation requires both decentralized and\ncentralized enforcement.

The differential expression of gene\nproducts, in particular that of gene regulators, is underlying sexual\ndimorphism. Analyses of sex-biased expression have focused mostly in protein\ncoding genes. Several lines of evidence indicate that microRNAs, a class of\nmajor gene regulators, are likely to have a significant role in sexual\ndimorphism. This role has not been systematically explored so far. Here I study\nthe sex-biased expression pattern of microRNAs in the model species Drosophila\nmelanogaster. As with protein coding genes, sex biased microRNAs are associated\nwith the reproductive function. Strikingly, contrary to protein-coding genes,\nmale biased microRNAs are enriched in the X chromosome whilst female microRNAs\nare mostly autosomal. I propose that the chromosomal distribution is a\nconsequence of high rates of de novo emergence, and a preference of new\nmicroRNAs to be expressed in the testis. I also suggest that demasculinization\nof the X chromosome may not affect microRNAs. Interestingly, female biased\nmicroRNAs are often encoded within protein coding genes that are also expressed\nin females. MicroRNAs with sex-biased expression do not preferentially target\nsex-biased gene transcripts. These results strongly suggest that the sex-biased\nexpression of microRNAs is mainly a consequence of high rates of microRNA\nemergence in the X (male bias) or hitch-hiked expression by host genes (female\nbias).\n","Comment: 25 pages, including 4 figures"]}]

The theoretical rationale relies on the hypothesis that\ncorrelated motions in proteins may be reconstructed as large-scale, collective\nmodes sustained by long-lived nonlinear vibrations known as discrete breathers\n(DB) localized at key, hot-spot sites. DBs are spatially localized modes, whose\nnonlinear nature hinders resonant coupling with the normal modes, thus\nconferring them long lifetimes as compared to normal modes. DBs have been\npredicted to exist in proteins, localized at few $hotspot$ residues typically\nwithin the stiffest portions of the structure. We compute DB modes analytically\nin the framework of the nonlinear network model, showing that the displacement\npatterns of many DBs localized at key sites match to a remarkable extent the\nexperimentally uncovered correlation blueprint. The computed dispersion\nrelations prove that it is physically possible for some of these DBs to be\nexcited out of thermal fluctuations at room temperature.\n  Based on our calculations, we speculate that transient energy redistribution\namong the vibrational modes in a protein might favor the emergence of DB-like\nbursts of long-lived energy at hot-spot sites with lifetimes in the ns range,\nable to sustain critical, function-encoding correlated motions.

The emergence\nof these self-consistent fields make shear flows significant sites for\nradiation emission and particle acceleration. We focus on electron-scale\ninstabilities, namely the collisionless, unmagnetized Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability (KHI) and a large-scale dc magnetic field generation mechanism on\nthe electron scales.

We show that the KHI is robust to density jumps between\nshearing flows, thus operating in various scenarios with different density\ncontrasts. Multidimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of the KHI,\nperformed with OSIRIS, reveal the emergence of a strong and large-scale dc\nmagnetic field component, which is not captured by the standard linear fluid\ntheory. This dc component arises from kinetic effects associated with the\nthermal expansion of electrons of one flow into the other across the shear\nlayer, whilst ions remain unperturbed due to their inertia. The electron\nexpansion forms dc current sheets, which induce a dc magnetic field. Our\nresults indicate that most of the electromagnetic energy developed in the KHI\nis stored in the dc component, reaching values of equipartition on the order of\n$10^{-3}$ in the electron time-scale, and persists longer than the proton\ntime-scale.

Initial conditions, at high redshift, are used to solve\nthe evolution equations of all the VT scalar modes. In particular, a certain\nscalar mode characteristic of VT -which does not appear in general relativity\n(GR)- is chosen in such a way that it evolves separately. In other words, the\nscalar modes of the standard model based on GR do not affect the evolution of\nthe VT characteristic mode; however, this scalar mode influences the evolution\nof the standard GR ones. Some well known suitable codes (CMBFAST and COSMOMC)\nhave been modified to include our VT initial conditions and evolution\nequations, which are fully general. One of the resulting codes -based on\nstandard statistical methods- has been used to fit VT predictions and\nobservational evidences about both Ia supernovae and cosmic microwave\nbackground anisotropy. Seven free parameters are used in this fit. Six of them\nare often used in GR cosmology and the seventh one is characteristic of VT.\nFrom the statistical analysis it follows that VT seems to be advantageous\nagainst GR in order to explain cosmological observational evidences.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 5 figures, published in Phys.

The first states that over any finite field\n$\\mathbb{F}$, for any polynomial $f$ on $n$ variables with degree $d \\le\n\\log(n)/10$, there exists a subspace of $\\mathbb{F}^n$ with dimension $\\Omega(d\n\\cdot n^{1/(d-1)})$ on which $f$ is constant. This result is shown to be tight.\nStated differently, a degree $d$ polynomial cannot compute an affine disperser\nfor dimension smaller than $\\Omega(d \\cdot n^{1/(d-1)})$. Using a recursive\nargument, we obtain our second structural result, showing that any degree $d$\npolynomial $f$ induces a partition of $F^n$ to affine subspaces of dimension\n$\\Omega(n^{1/(d-1)!})$, such that $f$ is constant on each part.\n  We extend both structural results to more than one polynomial. We further\nprove an analog of the first structural result to sparse polynomials (with no\nrestriction on the degree) and to functions that are close to low degree\npolynomials. We also consider the algorithmic aspect of the two structural\nresults.\n  Our structural results have various applications, two of which are:\n  * Dvir [CC 2012] introduced the notion of extractors for varieties, and gave\nexplicit constructions of such extractors over large fields. We show that over\nany finite field, any affine extractor is also an extractor for varieties with\nrelated parameters. Our reduction also holds for dispersers, and we conclude\nthat Shaltiel's affine disperser [FOCS 2011] is a disperser for varieties over\n$F_2$.\n  * Ben-Sasson and Kopparty [SIAM J. C 2012] proved that any degree 3 affine\ndisperser over a prime field is also an affine extractor with related\nparameters.
