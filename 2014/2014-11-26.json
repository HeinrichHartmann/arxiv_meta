The resulting energy levels of Hydrogen atom\nare exactly same as the Dirac theory. The theory accounts for the energy due to\nspin-orbit interaction and for the additional potential energy due to spin and\nspin-orbit coupling. Spin angular momentum operator is integrated into the\nequation of motion. This requires modification to classical Laplacian operator.\nConsequently the Dirac matrices and the k operator of Dirac's theory are\ndispensed with. The theory points out that the curvature of the orbit draws on\ncertain amount of kinetic and potential energies affecting the momentum of\nelectron and the spin-orbit interaction energy constitutes a part of this\nenergy. The theory is developed for spin 1/2 bound state single electron in\nCoulomb potential and then further extended to quarkonium physics by\nintroducing the linear confining potential. The unique feature of this\nquarkonium model is that the radial distance can be exactly determined and does\nnot have a statistical interpretation. The established radial distance is then\nused to determine the wave function. The observed energy levels are used as the\ninput parameters and the radial distance and the string tension are predicted.\nThis ensures 100% conformance to all observed energy levels for the heavy\nquarkonium.\n","Comment: 14 pages, v7: Journal reference added"]}]

The ambiguities of\nYukawa couplings are expected to be reduced. We show that the predicted region\nfor $R_1$ and $R_2$ is more restricted than in the $E_6$ model without\n$SU(2)_F$ as expected. Moreover, we re-examine the previous claim for the\nidentification of grand unification group with $100$ times more model points\n($10^6$ model points), including $E_6 \\times SU(2)_F$ model.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 6 figures. v2:figures and text are improved"]}]

By quantizing multiple channel entries\nsimultaneously using standardized codebooks in a state transition of trellis\nsearch, TEC can achieve fractional bits per channel entry quantization to have\na practical feedback overhead. Thus, TEC can solve both the complexity and the\nfeedback overhead issues of CSI quantization in massive MIMO systems. We also\ndevelop trellis-extended successive phase adjustment (TE-SPA) which works as a\ndifferential codebook of TEC. This is similar to the dual codebook concept of\nLTE-Advanced.

The essential idea is that an anyon of a topological\nphase can be endowed with fractional quantum numbers when the string attached\nto it slides over a background pattern of flux in the ground state. The string\nflux models that illustrate this mechanism are $Z_n$ quantum double models\ndefined on specially constructed $d$-dimensional lattices, and possess $Z_n$\ntopological order for $d \\geq 2$.

In general, by varying the pattern of $Z_n$ flux in\nthe ground state, any desired fractionalization class [element of $H^2(G,\nZ_n)$] can be realized for the $Z_n$ charge excitations. While the string flux\nmodels are not gauge theories, they map to $Z_n$ gauge theories in a certain\nlimit, where they follow a novel magnetic route for the emergence of low-energy\ngauge structure. The models are analyzed by studying the action of $G$ symmetry\non $Z_n$ charge excitations, and by gauging the $G$ symmetry.

Finally, a self-consistent, iterative method to compute\nthe gravitational wave fluxes at leading-order in the mass of the particle is\npresented. For a specific case study with $\\hat{a}$=0.9, a simulation that uses\nthe consistent flux differs from one that uses the analytical flux by $\\sim35$\ngravitational wave cycles over a total of about $250$ cycles. In this case the\nhorizon absorption accounts for about $+5$ gravitational wave cycles.\n"]}]

Looking at energy, a dynamo transforms\nkinetic energy in magnetic energy while reconnection takes magnetic energy and\nreturns is to its kinetic form. Most plasma processes at their core involve\nfirst storing magnetic energy accumulated over time and then releasing it\nsuddenly. We focus here on this release. A key concept in analysing\nreconnection is that of the separatrix, a surface (line in 2D) that separates\nthe fresh unperturbed plasma embedded in magnetic field lines not yet\nreconnected with the hotter exhaust embedded in reconnected field lines. In\nkinetic physics, the separatrices become a layer where many key processes\ndevelop. We present here new results relative to the processes at the\nseparatrices that regulate the plasma flow, the energisation of the species,\nthe electromagnetic fields and the instabilities developing at the\nseparatrices.\n"]}]

Nowadays\nnanoresonators can affect the lifetime of emitters and ultimately induce strong\ncoupling between the emitters and the light field, while nanoantennas can\ncontrol the directionality of the emission. Expanding this control to the\nmanipulation of the emission of orbital angular momentum-changing transitions\nwould enable coupling between long-lived solid-state qubits and flying qubits.\nAs these transitions are associated with circular rather than linear dipoles,\nsuch control requires detailed knowledge of the spatially dependent interaction\nof a complex dipole with highly structured optical eigenstates containing local\nhelicity. Using a classical analogue, we experimentally map the coupling of\ncircular dipoles to photonic modes in a model structure, a photonic crystal\nwaveguide. We show that depending on the local helicity the dipoles can be made\nto couple to modes either propagating to the left or to the right. The maps are\nin excellent agreement with calculations. Our measurements, therefore,\ndemonstrate the coupling of spin to photonic pathway with near-unity (0.8 $\\pm$\n0.1) efficiency.\n"]}]

Using observations to deduce dust properties, grain size\ndistribution, and physical conditions in molecular clouds is a highly\ndegenerate problem. Aims. The coreshine phenomenon, a scattering process at 3.6\nand 4.5 $\\mu$m that dominates absorption, has revealed its ability to explore\nthe densest parts of clouds. We want to use this effect to constrain the dust\nparameters. The goal is to investigate to what extent grain growth (at constant\ndust mass) inside molecular clouds is able to explain the coreshine\nobservations. We aim to find dust models that can explain a sample of Spitzer\ncoreshine data. We also look at the consistency with near-infrared data we\nobtained for a few clouds. Methods. We selected four regions with a very high\noccurrence of coreshine cases: Taurus-Perseus, Cepheus, Chameleon and\nL183/L134. We built a grid of dust models and investigated the key parameters\nto reproduce the general trend of surface bright- nesses and intensity ratios\nof both coreshine and near-infrared observations with the help of a 3D\nMonte-Carlo radiative transfer code. The grid parameters allow to investigate\nthe effect of coagulation upon spherical grains up to 5 $\\mu$m in size derived\nfrom the DustEm diffuse interstellar medium grains. Fluffiness (porosity or\nfractal degree), ices, and a handful of classical grain size distributions were\nalso tested. We used the near- and mostly mid-infrared intensity ratios as\nstrong discriminants between dust models. Results. The determination of the\nbackground field intensity at each wavelength is a key issue. In particular, an\nespecially strong background field explains why we do not see coreshine in the\nGalactic plane at 3.6 and 4.5 $\\mu$m. For starless cores, where detected, the\nobserved 4.5 $\\mu$m / 3.6 $\\mu$m coreshine intensity ratio is always lower than\n$\\sim$0.5 which is also what we find in the models for the Taurus-Perseus and\nL183 directions. Embedded sources can lead to higher fluxes (up to four times\ngreater than the strongest starless core fluxes) and higher coreshine ratios\n(from 0.5 to 1.1 in our selected sample). Normal interstellar radiation field\nconditions are sufficient to find suitable grain models at all wavelengths for\nstarless cores. The standard interstellar grains are not able to reproduce\nobservations and, due to the multi-wavelength approach, only a few grain types\nmeet the criteria set by the data. Porosity does not affect the flux ratios\nwhile the fractal dimension helps to explain coreshine ratios but does not seem\nable to reproduce near-infrared observations without a mix of other grain\ntypes. Conclusions. Combined near- and mid-infrared wavelengths confirm the\npotential to reveal the nature and size distribution of dust grains. Careful\nassessment of the environmental parameters (interstellar and background fields,\nembedded or nearby reddened sources) is required to validate this new\ndiagnostic.\n"]}]

We explore the formation of a protostar resulting from the collapse of\nprimordial gas in the presence of a strong Lyman-Werner radiation background.\nParticularly, we investigate the impact of turbulence and rotation on the\nfragmentation behaviour of the gas cloud.

The\nderived map of the degree of linear polarization pL allows us to reconstruct\nthe three-dimensional structure of the dust distribution.

In the present work, we employ additional 2D PIC simulations to address\nthe nature of the upstream oblique waves.

We systematically\nexplore how the efficiency of wave generation and of electron acceleration\ndepend on the magnetic field obliquity, the flow magnetization (or\nequivalently, the plasma beta), and the upstream electron temperature.

For example, it is widely held that\ninterstellar dust is made up of only three components, i.e., astronomical\nsilicates, graphite and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and that our\nunderstanding of these is now complete and sufficient enough to interpret\nastronomical observations of dust in galaxies. To zeroth order this is a\nreasonable approximation. However, while these three pillars of dust modelling\nhave been useful in advancing our understanding over the last few decades, it\nis now apparent that they are insufficient to explain the observed evolution of\nthe dust properties from one region to another. Thus, it is time to abandon the\nthree pillars approach and to seek more physically-realistic interstellar dust\nanalogues. The analy- sis of the pre-solar grains extracted from meteorites,\ninterplanetary dust particles and from the Stardust mission, and the\ninterpretation of x-ray scattering and absorption observations, supports the\nview that our current view of the interstellar dust composition(s) is indeed\ntoo naive. The aim of this review is to point out where our current views are\nrather secure and, perhaps more importantly, where they are far from secure and\nwe must re-think our ideas. To this aim ten as- pects of interstellar dust will\nbe scrutinised and re-evaluated in terms of their validity within the current\nobservational, experimental, modelling and theoretical constraints. It is\nconcluded from this analysis that we really do need to re-assess many of the\nfundamental assumptions relating to what we think we really do know about\ninterstellar dust. In particular, it is clear that unravelling the nature dust\nevolution in the interstellar medium is perhaps the key to significantly\nadvancing our current understanding of interstellar dust. ...\n","Comment: 20 pages, 7 figures"]}]

A way to test this hypothesis is to make a\ndirect comparison of an ensemble of solutions obtained by conventional methods\nwith an ensemble of true solutions. In order to make this possible, we wrote an\nN-body code called Brutus, that uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic. In\ncombination with the Bulirsch--Stoer method, Brutus is able to obtain converged\nsolutions, which are true up to a specified number of digits.

We do this with conventional double-precision\nmethods, and with Brutus; both have the same set of initial conditions and\ninitial realisations. The ensemble of solutions from the conventional\nsimulations is compared directly to that of the converged simulations, both as\nan ensemble and on an individual basis to determine the distribution of the\nerrors. We find that on average at least half of the conventional simulations\ndiverge from the converged solution, such that the two solutions are\nmicroscopically incomparable. For the solutions which have not diverged\nsignificantly, we observe that if the integrator has a bias in energy and\nangular momentum, this propagates to a bias in the statistical properties of\nthe binaries. In the case when the conventional solution has diverged onto an\nentirely different trajectory in phase-space, we find that the errors are\ncentred around zero and symmetric; the error due to divergence is unbiased, as\nlong as the time-step parameter, eta <= 2^(-5) and when simulations which\nviolate energy conservation by more than 10% are excluded.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 15 digures"]}]

A\npreliminary bench test shows that a prototype two-layer fiber ribbon exhibits\n99.6% detection efficiency at the 1-photoelectron threshold.

Results\nindicate that static finite element approaches are highly sensitive to initial\nimperfections, relying on \\textit{a priori} knowledge of the equilibrium\nwrinkling pattern to generate optimal results. In contrast, dynamic relaxation\nis much less sensitive to initial imperfections and can generate solutions for\na wide variety of loading conditions without requiring knowledge of the\nequilibrium solution beforehand.\n","Comment: submitted to J.

The elaboration of this timetable is done to respond to the commercial\nrequirements for both passenger and freight traffic, but also it must respect a\nset of security and capacity constraints associated with the railway network,\nrolling stock and legislation. Combining these requirements and constraints, as\nwell as the important number of trains and schedules to plan, makes the\npreparation of a feasible timetable a complex and time-consuming process, that\nnormally takes several months to be completed. This article addresses the\nproblem of generating periodic timetables, which means that the involved trains\noperate in a recurrent pattern. For instance, the trains belonging to the same\ntrain line, depart from some station every 15 minutes or one hour. To tackle\nthe problem, we present a constraint-based model suitable for this kind of\nproblem. Then, we propose a genetic algorithm, allowing a rapid generation of\nfeasible periodic timetables.
