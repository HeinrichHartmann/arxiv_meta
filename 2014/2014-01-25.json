In fact, we effectively show that, in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, what we\nexpect to hold due to the maximal Kakeya operator conjecture, as well as what\nwe know in the continuous case due to the endpoint multilinear Kakeya theorem\nby Guth, still hold in the discrete case.\n  In particular, let $\\mathfrak{L}$ be a collection of $L$ lines in\n$\\mathbb{R}^3$ and $J$ the set of joints formed by $\\mathfrak{L}$, that is, the\nset of points each of which lies in at least three non-coplanar lines of\n$\\mathfrak{L}$. It is known that $|J|=O(L^{3/2})$ (first proved by Guth and\nKatz). For each joint $x\\in J$, let the multiplicity $N(x)$ of $x$ be the\nnumber of triples of non-coplanar lines through $x$. We prove here that\n$$\\sum_{x\\in J} N(x)^{1/2}=O(L^{3/2}), $$while we also extend this result to\nreal algebraic curves in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ of uniformly bounded degree, as well as\nto curves in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ parametrized by real univariate polynomials of\nuniformly bounded degree.\n  The multijoints problem is a variant of the joints problem, involving three\nfinite collections of lines in $\\mathbb{R}^3$; a multijoint formed by them is a\npoint that lies in (at least) three non-coplanar lines, one from each\ncollection.\n  We finally present some results regarding the joints problem in different\nfield settings and higher dimensions.\n","Comment: 122 pages.

One of the most common ways in performance analysis of\ndistributed software systems is translating the UML diagrams to mathematical\nmodeling languages for the description of distributed systems such as queuing\nnetworks or Petri nets. In this paper, some of these approaches are reviewed\nbriefly. Attributes which are used for performance modeling in the literature\nare mostly machine based.

The properties of the generated hash functions remains\nthat of an universal hash function family. This is possible due to the random\nnature of features occurrence on sparse datasets.
