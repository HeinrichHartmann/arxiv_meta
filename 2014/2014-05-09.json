The\nphase-entanglement criterion is a hallmark for a new type of quantum squeezing,\nnamely planar quantum squeezing. This has the property that it squeezes two\northogonal spin directions simultaneously, which is possible owing to the fact\nthat the SU(2) group that describes spin symmetry has a three-dimensional\nparameter space, of higher dimension than the group for photonic quadratures.\nThe practical advantage of planar quantum squeezing is that, unlike\nconventional spin-squeezing, it allows noise reduction over all phase-angles\nsimultaneously. The application of this type of squeezing is to quantum\nmeasure- ment of an unknown phase. We show that a completely unknown phase\nrequires two orthogonal measurements, and that with planar quantum squeezing it\nis possible to reduce the measurement uncertainty independently of the unknown\nphase value.

The dynamics of such systems is governed solely by interactions\namong individuals or \"agents,\" with the tendency to adjust to their\n`environmental averages'. This, in turn, leads to the formation of clusters,\ne.g., colonies of ants, flocks of birds, parties of people, etc. A natural\nquestion which arises in this context is to understand when and how clusters\nemerge through the self-alignment of agents, and what type of \"rules of\nengagement\" influence the formation of such clusters. Of particular interest to\nus are cases in which the self-organized behavior tends to concentrate into one\ncluster, reflecting a consensus of opinions, flocking or concentration of other\npositions intrinsic to the dynamics.\n  Many standard models for self-organized dynamics in social, biological and\nphysical science assume that the intensity of alignment increases as agents get\ncloser, reflecting a common tendency to align with those who think or act\nalike. Moreover, \"Similarity breeds connection,\" reflects our intuition that\nincreasing the intensity of alignment as the difference of positions decreases,\nis more likely to lead to a consensus. We argue here that the converse is true:\nwhen the dynamics is driven by local interactions, it is more likely to\napproach a consensus when the interactions among agents \\emph{increase} as a\nfunction of their difference in position. \\emph{Heterophily} --- the tendency\nto bond more with those who are different rather than with those who are\nsimilar, plays a decisive r\\^{o}le in the process of clustering.

We show that even when the\nejection takes place within the drift-dominated region there is a very high\nprobability for the ejection process not to be completed. Introducing a small\naligning force at the pore entrance enhances ejection dramatically. Such a pore\nasymmetry is a candidate for a mechanism by which a viral ejection is\ncompleted. By detailed high-resolution simulations we show that such capsid\nejection is an out-of-equilibrium process that shares many common features with\nthe much studied driven polymer translocation through a pore in a wall or a\nmembrane. We find that the escape times scale with polymer length, $\\tau \\sim\nN^\\alpha$.

For the pore\nwith the asymmetry the scaling exponent varies with the initial monomer density\n(monomers per capsid volume) $\\rho$ inside the capsid. For very low densities\n$\\rho \\le 0.002$ the polymer is only weakly confined by the capsid, and we\nmeasure $\\alpha = 1.33$, which is close to $\\alpha = 1.4$ obtained for polymer\ntranslocation.

In particular, the\ncooperative beamforming design is formulated as an optimization problem that\nmaximizes the weighted sum achievable transmission rate of secondary\ndestinations while it maintains the asynchronous interferences at the primary\nreceivers below their target thresholds. In light of the intractability of the\nproblem, we propose a two-phase suboptimal cooperative beamforming technique.\nFirst, it finds the beamforming directions corresponding to different secondary\ndestinations. Second, it allocates the power among different beamforming\ndirections. Due to the multiple interference constraints corresponding to\nmultiple primary receivers, the power allocation scheme in the second phase is\nstill complex. Therefore, we also propose a low complex power allocation\nalgorithm. The proposed beamforming technique is extended for the cases, when\ncooperating CR nodes (CCRNs) have statistical or erroneous channel knowledge of\nthe primary receivers. We also investigate the performance of joint CCRN\nselection and beamforming technique. The presented numerical results show that\nthe proposed beamforming technique can significantly reduce the asynchronous\ninterference signals at the primary receivers and increase the sum transmission\nrate of secondary destinations compared to the well known zero-forcing\nbeamforming (ZFBF) technique.\n","Comment: Submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications"]}]

In the limit of a small Josephson\ncoupling energy $E_J \\ll k_B T$ the thermal fluctuations result in a stochastic\ndependence of the Josephson phase $\\varphi$ on time, i.e the Josephson phase\ndiffusion. These thermal fluctuations destroy the superconducting state, and\nthe low-voltage resistive state is characterized by a nonlinear $I$-$V$ curve.\nSuch $I$-$V$ curve is determined by the resonant interaction of ac Josephson\ncurrent with the Josephson phase oscillations excited in the junction.

This generalizes the notion of halving hyperplanes, which correspond\nto $n/2$-separators. The analogous notion for point sets has been well studied.\nSeparators have various applications, for instance, in divide-and-conquer\nschemes. In such a scheme any ball that is intersected by the separating\nhyperplane may still interact with both sides of the partition. Therefore it is\ndesirable that the separating hyperplane intersects a small number of balls\nonly.
