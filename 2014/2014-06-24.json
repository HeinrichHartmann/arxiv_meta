The transfer equation is solved in the mixed frame,\nincluding velocity dependent source terms accurate to O(v/c). An operator split\napproach is used to compute the specific intensity along discrete rays, with\nupwind monotonic interpolation used along each ray to update the transport\nterms, and implicit methods used to compute the scattering and absorption\nsource terms. Conservative differencing is used for the transport terms, which\nensures the specific intensity (as well as energy and momentum) are conserved\nalong each ray to round-off error. The use of implicit methods for the source\nterms ensures the method is stable even if the source terms are very stiff. To\ncouple the solution of the transfer equation to the MHD algorithms in the\nAthena code, we perform direct quadrature of the specific intensity over angles\nto compute the energy and momentum source terms. We present the results of a\nvariety of tests of the method, such as calculating the structure of a non-LTE\natmosphere, an advective diffusion test, linear wave convergence tests, and the\nwell-known shadow test. We use new semi-analytic solutions for radiation\nmodified shocks to demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to capture the\neffects of an anisotropic radiation field accurately. Since the method uses\nexplicit differencing of the spatial operators, it shows excellent weak scaling\non parallel computers. The method is ideally suited for problems in which\ncharacteristic velocities are non-relativistic, but still within a few percent\nor more of the speed of light.

Of course, vibrational\ndynamics in liquids and crystals are quite different and it is not expected\nthat the results obtained on a model crystal should be valid for liquids.\nHowever, these considerations provide a benchmark to which the results of the\nprevious molecular dynamics simulations can be compared. Thus, assuming that\nvibrations are plane waves, we derive analytical expressions for the atomic\nlevel stress correlation functions in the classical limit and analyze them.\nThese results provide, in particular, a recipe for analysis of the atomic level\nstress correlation functions in Fourier space and extraction of the wavevector\nand frequency dependent information. We also evaluate the energies of the\natomic level stresses. Obtained energies are significantly smaller than the\nenergies that were obtained in MD simulations of liquids previously. This\nresult suggests that the average energies of the atomic level stresses in\nliquids and glasses are largely determined by the structural disorder. We\ndiscuss this result in the context of equipartition of the atomic level stress\nenergies. Analysis of the previously published data suggests that it is\npossible to speak about configurational and vibrational contributions to the\naverage energies of the atomic level stresses in a glass state. However, this\nseparation in a liquid state is problematic. We also consider peak broadening\nin the pair distribution function with increase of distance.

They\nare deemed to embody all physics in a flow of Newtonian fluids like water,\nespecially when we assume the fluid is incompressible. Fluid flows are usually\ndescribed in the Eulerian perspective wherein we focus on the fluid's\nquantities at a fixed point in space as time processes, rather than the motion\nof each individual particle. The latter perspective is indeed the Lagrangian\nperspective which is widely used in solid mechanics like elasticity. Thus, the\nNavier-Stokes equations should be and indeed they are always used in the\nEulerian perspective. Here we show the right-hand sides of the Navier-Stokes\nequations were derived not in the Eulerian perspective but rather in the\nLagrangian perspective, because the strain rates used in the derivation were\nthe Lagrangian Cauchy strain rates. Thus, for describing fluid flows in the\nEulerian perspective, the Navier-Stokes equations may lost some physics. To\nmake it sure, we put the Cauchy strain into the material derivative, and then\nderive the Eulerian Cauchy strain rates. We find the difference between the\nEulerian and the Lagrangian Cauchy strain rates is significant when in a\nturbulent flow. Therefore, On the basis of the Eulerian Cauchy strain rates, we\nderive a new set of governing equations for the flow of Newtonian fluids.

In practice, the spin signal is fitted to the analytic\nsolution of the spin Bloch equation, which accounts for diffusion, relaxation\nand precession effects on spin. The analytic formula, however, is derived for\nan infinite length of the 1D spin channel. This is usually not satisfied in the\nreal devices. The finite size of the channel length $l_{\\text{dev}}$ leads to\nconfinement of spins and increase of spin accumulation. Moreover, reflection of\nspins from the channel ends leads to spin interference, altering the\ncharacteristic precession lineshape. In this work we study the influence of\nfinite $l_{\\text{dev}}$ on the Hanle lineshape and show when it can lead to a\ntwo-fold discrepancy in the extracted spin coefficients. We propose the\nextension of the Hanle analytic formula to include the geometrical aspects of\nthe real device and get an excellent agreement with a finite-element model of\nspin precession, where this geometry is explicitly set. We also demonstrate\nthat in the limit of a channel length shorter than the spin relaxation length\n$\\lambda_{s}$, the spin diffusion is negligible and a 0D spin transport\ndescription, with Lorentzian precession dependence applies.

Using\nfour datasets of social activity, with up to tens of millions media objects\n(e.g., YouTube videos, Twitter hashtags or LastFM artists), we show the effect\nof revisits in the popularity evolution of such objects. Secondly, we propose\nthe Phoenix-R model which captures the popularity dynamics of individual\nobjects. Phoenix-R has the desired properties of being: (1) parsimonious, being\nbased on the minimum description length principle, and achieving lower root\nmean squared error than state-of-the-art baselines; (2) applicable, the model\nis effective for predicting future popularity values of objects.\n","Comment: To appear on European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles\n  and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases 2014"]}]

A luminosity distance $\\leq$ 25.4 $Mpc$ and an\nabsolute B-band magnitude $\\leq$ -19.12 define the sample. These limits define\na sample of 140 spiral galaxies, with 128 measurable pitch angles to establish\nthe pitch angle distribution for this sample. This pitch angle distribution\nfunction may be useful in the study of the morphology of late-type galaxies. We\nthen use an established relationship between the pitch angle and the mass of\nthe central SMBH in a host galaxy in order to estimate the mass of the 128\nrespective SMBHs in this sample. This result effectively gives us the\ndistribution of mass for SMBHs residing in spiral galaxies over a lookback time\n$\\leq$ 82.1 $h_{67.77}^{-1}$ $Myr$ and contained within a comoving volume of\n3.37 $\\times$ $10^4$ $h_{67.77}^{-3}$ $Mpc^3$.

Thus, our derived\ncosmological SMBH mass density for spiral galaxies is $\\Omega_{BH} =\n4.35_{-2.15}^{+5.14}$ $\\times$ $10^{-7}$ $h_{67.77}$.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 12 figures, 5 tables, accepted for publication in The\n  Astrophysical Journal"]}]

Advanced models such as Maximum Variance\nUnfolding (MVU) and Minimum Volume Embedding (MVE) use Semi-Definite\nProgramming (SDP) to reconstruct such faithful representations. While those SDP\nmodels are capable of producing high quality configuration numerically, they\nsuffer two major drawbacks.

Our aim was to separate\nchanges produced by short-term ENSO variations and to look on temporal and\nspatial dynamics of residual temperature anomalies. For this we subtract linear\ninfluence of ENSO index from each HadCRUT4 grid box. We found that residual\nglobal temperature dynamics looks like staircase function: linear trends for\nthree quasi-stable periods 1950-1987, 1988-1997 and 1998-2013 are near zero and\nnear all warming occurred during two shifts of 1987/1988 and 1997/1998 years.\n  All these allows us to formulate a new hypothesis about recent warming - the\nShifts Hypothesis. It explains the structure of recent warming as follows:\nduring shifts of 1987/1988 and 1997/1998 the mean value of global temperature\nquickly rose, over which natural variability associated with ENSO, PDO and many\nother local factors occurs.\n  According to IPCC forcing-response paradigm warming process (WP) cleared from\nall factors should be continuous warming (may be near linear on the considered\ntime interval). This idea is inconsistent to the obtained staircase function.\nThis staircase function may be explained by current IPCC forcing-response\nparadigm only if it happened so that the combination of compensating factors is\nnear the same as anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) forcing for each\nquasi-stable period - 1950-1987, 1988-1997 and 1998-2013. This seems very\nunlikely. An alternative and more simple explanation is the existence of some\nregulation mechanism (e.g. global thermostat) not presented in IPCC climate\nmodels. This mechanism should maintain global temperature near stable in\n1950-1987, 1988-1997 and 1998-2013 periods nevertheless all the time growing\nforcing due to anthropogenic GHGs.\n"]}]

For a given\nlikelihood model, we identify the difference in information needed to form two\nlikelihood functions that, when combined respectively with a given prior and a\nbaseline prior, will lead to the same posterior uncertainty. In cases with\nindependent, identically distributed samples, sample size is the natural\nmeasure of information, and this difference can be viewed as the prior data\nsize $M(k)$, with regard to a likelihood function based on $k$ observations.\nWhen there is no detectable prior-likelihood conflict relative to the baseline,\n$M(k)$ is roughly constant over $k$, a constant that captures the confirmatory\ninformation. Otherwise $M(k)$ tends to decrease with $k$ because the\ncontradictory prior detracts information from the likelihood function. In the\ncase of extreme contradiction, $M(k)/k$ will approach its lower bound $-1$,\nrepresenting a complete cancelation of prior and likelihood information due to\nconflict.

We describe the command and\ncalibrations algorithms used during the run and present the observing\nconditions. The processed data are MOAO-loop engaged or disengaged slope\nbuffers, comprising the synchronised measurements of the four Natural Guide\nStars (NGS) wavefront sensors running in parallel, and near Infra-Red (IR)\nimages. We describe the method we use to establish the error budget of CANARY.\nWe are able to evaluate the to- mographic and the open loop errors, having\nmedian values around 216 nm and 110 nm respectively. In addition, we identify\nan unexpected residual quasi-static field aberration term of mean value 110 nm.\nWe present the detailed error budget analysed for three sets of data for three\ndifferent asterisms. We compare the experimental budgets with the numerically\nsimulated ones and demonstrate a good agreement. We find also a good agreement\nbetween the computed error budget from the slope buffers and the measured\nStrehl ratio on the IR images, ranging between 10% and 20% at 1 530 nm. These\nresults make us confident in our ability to establish the error budget of\nfuture MOAO instruments.\n","Comment: in press A&A (2014)"]}]

A theoretical result established recently by the authors\nshows that adapting interaction between particles to suitably control the\nEffective Sample Size (ESS) is sufficient to guarantee stability of SMC\nalgorithms. Our objective is to leverage this result and devise algorithms\nwhich are thus guaranteed to work well in a distributed setting. We make three\nmain contributions to achieve this. Firstly, we study mathematical properties\nof the ESS as a function of matrices and graphs that parameterize the\ninteraction amongst particles. Secondly, we show how these graphs can be\ninduced by tree data structures which model the logical network topology of an\nabstract distributed computing environment. Thirdly, we present efficient\ndistributed algorithms that achieve the desired ESS control, perform resampling\nand operate on forests associated with these trees.\n"]}]

I show that all sources of prediction bias\ncontribute to generating false negatives (i.e., discounting the chance of a\npandemic when it is looming or has already started). Nevertheless, the\nstatistical difficulties can be overcome by improved data gathering and use of\nknown techniques that decrease bias. One peculiarity of the SS epidemic is that\nthe prediction can sometimes be made long before the actual pandemic onset,\ngenerating lead time to alert the medical community and the public. Thus\nmodeling is useful to overcome a false sense of security arising from the long\n\"kindling times\" characteristic of SS epidemics and certain\npolitical/psychological factors, as well as improve the public health response.\n"]}]
