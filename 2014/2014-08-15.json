Nowadays, information\nis spread through a variety of networks, including, among others, online and\noffline social networks and the World Wide Web. The entire system, comprising\nnetworks of different nature, can be represented as a multi-layer network. In\nthis context, lexical innovations diffusion occurs in a peculiar fashion. In\nparticular, a lexical innovation can undergo three different processes: its\noriginal meaning is accepted; its meaning can be changed or misunderstood\n(e.g., when not properly explained), hence more than one meaning can emerge in\nthe population; lastly, in the case of a loan word, it can be translated into\nthe population language (i.e., defining a new lexical innovation or using a\nsynonym) or into a dialect spoken by part of the population. Therefore, lexical\ninnovations cannot be considered simply as information.

Among ICI\ncoordination schemes, fractional frequency reuse (FFR) is considered as an\nefficient technique well-suited to OFDMA-based HetNets. Two coupled questions\nin this context are: 1) how to associate users to appropriate base-stations\nconsidering the long list of available candidate cells, and 2) how to allocate\nfrequency resources among multiple cells. In this paper, we treat the\nmulti-cell frequency allocation as frequency partitioning among multiple reuse\npatterns, and develop a novel algorithm to solve these two coupled questions in\na joint manner. We also provide practical criterion to select the set of\nessential candidate patterns from all possible patterns. Results show that the\nproposed joint strategy improves both the cell-edge user and overall network\nthroughput.\n","Comment: accepted in eleventh international Symposium on Wireless\n  Communication Systems (ISWCS) 2014, Spain"]}]

The\ndesired sensors for these instruments should have a background limited\nsensitivity and a high optical efficiency and enable arrays thousands of pixels\nin size. Hybrid microwave kinetic inductance detectors consisting of NbTiN and\nAl have shown to satisfy these requirements. We present the second generation\nhybrid NbTiN-Al MKIDs, which are photon noise limited in both phase and\namplitude readout for loading levels $P_{850GHz} \\geq 10$ fW. Thanks to the\nincreased responsivity, the photon noise level achieved in phase allows us to\nsimultaneously read out approximately 8000 pixels using state-of-the-art\nelectronics. In addition, the choice of superconducting materials and the use\nof a Si lens in combination with a planar antenna gives these resonators the\nflexibility to operate within the frequency range $0.09 < \\nu < 1.1$ THz. Given\nthese specifications, hybrid NbTiN-Al MKIDs will enable astronomically usable\nkilopixel arrays for sub-mm imaging and moderate resolution spectroscopy.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures.
