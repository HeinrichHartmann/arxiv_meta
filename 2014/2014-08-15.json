Nowadays, information\nis spread through a variety of networks, including, among others, online and\noffline social networks and the World Wide Web. The entire system, comprising\nnetworks of different nature, can be represented as a multi-layer network. In\nthis context, lexical innovations diffusion occurs in a peculiar fashion. In\nparticular, a lexical innovation can undergo three different processes: its\noriginal meaning is accepted; its meaning can be changed or misunderstood\n(e.g., when not properly explained), hence more than one meaning can emerge in\nthe population; lastly, in the case of a loan word, it can be translated into\nthe population language (i.e., defining a new lexical innovation or using a\nsynonym) or into a dialect spoken by part of the population. Therefore, lexical\ninnovations cannot be considered simply as information.

We present the second generation\nhybrid NbTiN-Al MKIDs, which are photon noise limited in both phase and\namplitude readout for loading levels $P_{850GHz} \\geq 10$ fW. Thanks to the\nincreased responsivity, the photon noise level achieved in phase allows us to\nsimultaneously read out approximately 8000 pixels using state-of-the-art\nelectronics. In addition, the choice of superconducting materials and the use\nof a Si lens in combination with a planar antenna gives these resonators the\nflexibility to operate within the frequency range $0.09 < \\nu < 1.1$ THz. Given\nthese specifications, hybrid NbTiN-Al MKIDs will enable astronomically usable\nkilopixel arrays for sub-mm imaging and moderate resolution spectroscopy.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures.
