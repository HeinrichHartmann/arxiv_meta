The lifetime sharply\nincreases with Reynolds number so that a possible divergence marking the\ntransition to sustained turbulence at a critical point has been discussed. We\npresent a mechanism by which the lifetimes increase: in the system's state\nspace, turbulent motion is supported by a chaotic saddle. Inside this saddle a\nlocally attracting periodic orbit is created and undergoes a traditional\nbifurcation sequence generating chaos. The formed new 'turbulent bubble' is\ninitially an attractor supporting persistent chaotic dynamics. Soon after its\ncreation it collides with its own boundary, by which it becomes leaky and\ndynamically connected with the surrounding structures. The complexity of the\nchaotic saddle that supports transient turbulence hence increases by\nincorporating the remnant of a new bubble.

The Sun shows strong variability in its magnetic activity, from Grand\nminima to Grand maxima, but the nature of the variability is not fully\nunderstood, mostly because of the insufficient length of the directly observed\nsolar activity records and of uncertainties related to long-term\nreconstructions. Here we present a new adjustment-free reconstruction of solar\nactivity over three millennia and study its different modes. Methods. We\npresent a new adjustment-free, physical reconstruction of solar activity over\nthe past three millennia, using the latest verified carbon cycle, 14C\nproduction, and archeomagnetic field models. This great improvement allowed us\nto study different modes of solar activity at an unprecedented level of\ndetails. Results. The distribution of solar activity is clearly bi-modal,\nimplying the existence of distinct modes of activity. The main regular activity\nmode corresponds to moderate activity that varies in a relatively narrow band\nbetween sunspot numbers about 20 and 67. The existence of a separate Grand\nminimum mode with reduced solar activity, which cannot be explained by random\nfluctuations of the regular mode, is confirmed at a high confidence level. The\npossible existence of a separate Grand maximum mode is also suggested, but the\nstatistics is too low to reach a confident conclusion. Conclusions. The Sun is\nshown to operate in distinct modes - a main general mode, a Grand minimum mode\ncorresponding to an inactive Sun, and a possible Grand maximum mode\ncorresponding to an unusually active Sun. These results provide important\nconstraints for both dynamo models of Sun-like stars and investigations of\npossible solar influence on Earth's climate.\n","Comment: Astron. Astrophys.

The RITA scheme works by a relativistic laser\ninducing transparency to densities higher than the cold-electron critical\ndensity, while the background heavy ions are stationary. The rising laser pulse\ncreates a traveling acceleration structure at the relativistic critical density\nby ponderomotively driving a local electron density inflation, creating an\nelectron snowplow and a co-propagating electrostatic potential. The snowplow\nadvances with a velocity determined by the rate of the rise of the laser's\nintensity envelope and the heavy-ion-plasma density gradient scale length. The\nrising laser is incrementally rendered transparent to higher densities such\nthat the relativistic-electron plasma frequency is resonant with the laser\nfrequency. In the snowplow frame, trace density protons reflect off the\nelectrostatic potential and get snowplowed, while the heavier background ions\nare relatively unperturbed.
