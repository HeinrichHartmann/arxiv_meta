Together, these\nissues mean that the usual model-selection criteria do not work properly for\nnetworks. We illustrate these challenges, and show one way to resolve them, by\nconsidering the key network-analysis problem of dividing a graph into\ncommunities or blocks of nodes with homogeneous patterns of links to the rest\nof the network. The standard tool for doing this is the stochastic block model,\nunder which the probability of a link between two nodes is a function solely of\nthe blocks to which they belong. This imposes a homogeneous degree distribution\nwithin each block; this can be unrealistic, so degree-corrected block models\nadd a parameter for each node, modulating its over-all degree. The choice\nbetween ordinary and degree-corrected block models matters because they make\nvery different inferences about communities. We present the first principled\nand tractable approach to model selection between standard and degree-corrected\nblock models, based on new large-graph asymptotics for the distribution of\nlog-likelihood ratios under the stochastic block model, finding substantial\ndepartures from classical results for sparse graphs. We also develop\nlinear-time approximations for log-likelihoods under both the stochastic block\nmodel and the degree-corrected model, using belief propagation. Applications to\nsimulated and real networks show excellent agreement with our approximations.\nOur results thus both solve the practical problem of deciding on degree\ncorrection, and point to a general approach to model selection in network\nanalysis.\n"]}]

The flare exhibits two ribbons in UV 1600\n{\\AA} emission. Analysis shows that the UV light curve at each flaring pixel\nrises impulsively within a few minutes, and decays slowly with a timescale >10\nmin. Since the lower atmosphere (transition region and chromosphere) responds\nto energy deposit nearly instantaneously, the rapid UV brightening is thought\nto reflect the energy release process in the newly formed flare loop rooted at\nthe footpoint. We utilize spatially resolved (down to 1 arcsec) UV light curves\nand thick-target hard X-ray emission to construct heating functions of a few\nthousand flare loops anchored at UV foot points, and compute plasma evolution\nin these loops using the EBTEL model. The modeled coronal temperatures and\ndensities of these flare loops are used to calculate synthetic soft X-ray\nspectra and light curves, which compare favorably with those observed by RHESSI\nand GOES/XRS.

Large deviations between the abundances of\nthe host star and its gas giants seem likely to occur if the planet formation\nfollows the core-accretion scenario. These deviations stem from the separate\nevolution of gas and dust in the disk, where the dust forms the planet cores,\nfollowed by the final run-away accretion of the left-over gas. ProDiMo\nprotoplanetary disk models are used to predict the chemical evolution of gas\nand ice in the midplane. We find that cosmic rays play a crucial role in slowly\nun-blocking the CO, where the liberated oxygen forms water, which then freezes\nout quickly. Therefore, the C/O ratio in the gas phase is found to gradually\nincrease with time, in a region bracketed by the water and CO ice-lines. In\nthis regions, C/O is found to approach unity after about 5 Myrs, scaling with\nthe cosmic ray ionisation rate. We then explore how the atmospheric chemistry\nand cloud properties in young gas giants are affected when the non-solar C/O\nratios predicted by the disk models are assumed. The DRIFT cloud formation\nmodel is applied to study the formation of atmospheric clouds under the\ninfluence of varying primordial element abundances and its feedback onto the\nlocal gas.

A photothermoelectric\n(PTE) effect governs the photocurrent response in our devices, allowing us to\ntrack the hot electron temperature and probe hot electron cooling channels over\na wide temperature range (4 K to 300 K). At high temperatures ($T > T^*$), we\nfound that both the peak photocurrent and the hot spot size decreased with\ntemperature, while at low temperatures ($T < T^*$), we found the opposite,\nnamely that the peak photocurrent and the hot spot size increased with\ntemperature. This non-monotonic temperature dependence can be understood as\nresulting from the competition between two hot electron cooling pathways: (a)\n(intrinsic) momentum-conserving normal collisions (NC) that dominates at low\ntemperatures and (b) (extrinsic) disorder-assisted supercollisions (SC) that\ndominates at high temperatures. Gate control in our high quality samples allows\nus to resolve the two processes in the same device for the first time. The peak\ntemperature $T^*$ depends on carrier density and disorder concentration, thus\nallowing for an unprecedented way of controlling graphene's photoresponse.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures"]}]

As emitting material\nleaves the corona, a temporary void is left behind which can be observed in\nspectral images and irradiance measurements. The velocity and mass of the CMEs\nshould impact the character of those observations. However, other physical\nprocesses can confuse the observations. We describe these processes and the\nexpected observational signature, with special emphasis placed on the\ndifferences. We then apply this understanding to a coronal dimming event with\nan associated CME that occurred on 2010 August 7. Data from the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory's (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and EUV Variability\nExperiment (EVE) are used for observations of the dimming, while the Solar and\nHeliospheric Observatory's (SOHO) Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph\n(LASCO) and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory's (STEREO) COR1 and\nCOR2 are used to obtain velocity and mass estimates for the associated CME. We\ndevelop a technique for mitigating temperature effects in coronal dimming from\nfull-disk irradiance measurements taken by EVE. We find that for this event,\nnearly 100% of the dimming is due to mass loss in the corona.\n"]}]

In contrast to the approach to\nsuppress the backward scattering and enhance the forward scattering relying on\noverlapping electric and magnetic dipoles, we reveal that the directionality of\nthe forward scattering can be further improved through the interferences of\nhigher order electric and magnetic modes. Since the major contributing electric\nand magnetic responses can be tuned to close magnitudes, ultra-directional\nforward scattering can be achieved by single nanoparticles without compromising\nthe feature of backward scattering suppression, which may offer new\nopportunities for nanoantennas, photovoltaic devices, bio-sensing and many\nother interdisciplinary researches.\n","Comment: 4 figures"]}]

It is well known that in the\nnonlinear regime of structure formation, the matter fluctuation field develops\nsuch large tails. It has also been suggested that fields with large tails are\nnot necessarily well described by the hierarchy of $N$-point functions. In this\nthesis, we are able to make this last statement precise and with the help of\nthe lognormal model to quantify precisely its implications for inference on\ncosmological parameters : we find as our main result that only a tiny fraction\nof the total Fisher information of the field is still contained in the\nhierarchy of $N$-point moments in the nonlinear regime, rendering parameter\ninference from such moments very inefficient. We show that the hierarchy fails\nto capture the information that is contained in the underdense regions, which\nat the same time are found to be the most rich in information. We find further\nour results to be very consistent with numerical analysis using $N$-body\nsimulations. We also discuss these issues with the help of explicit families of\nfields with the same hierarchy of $N$-point moments defined in this work. A\nsimilar analysis is then applied to the convergence field, the weighted\nprojection of the matter density fluctuation field along the line of sight,\nwith similar conclusions.

In this paper we introduce Lipschitz\nversions of these concepts, dealing with maps between metric spaces and Banach\nlattices, and start by proving nonlinear versions of two well-known\nfactorization theorems through $L_p$ spaces due to Maurey/Nikishin and Krivine.\nWe also show that a Lipschitz map from a metric space into a Banach lattice is\nLipschitz $p$-convex if and only if its linearization is $p$-convex.\nFurthermore, we elucidate why there is such a close relationship between the\nlinear and nonlinear concepts by proving characterizations of Lipschitz\n$p$-convex and Lipschitz $q$-concave maps in terms of factorizations through\n$p$-convex and $q$-concave Banach lattices, respectively, in the spirit of the\nwork of Raynaud and Tradacete.\n","Comment: 25 pages"]}]
