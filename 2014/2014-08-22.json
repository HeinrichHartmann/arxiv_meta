In the spirit of the Yukawa-approach to the nuclear force\nproblem, the interactions are studied from the meson-exchange picture\nviewpoint, using generalized soft-core Yukawa-functions. These interactions are\nsupplemented with (i) multiple-gluon-exchange, and (ii) structural effects due\nto the quark-core of the baryons. The extended-soft-core (ESC) meson-exchange\ninteractions consist of local- and non-local-potentials due to ((i)\nOne-boson-exchanges (OBE, which are the members of nonets of pseudoscalar ,\nvector, scalar, and axial-vector mesons, (ii) diffractive (i.e. multiple-gluon)\nexchanges, (iii) two pseudoscalar exchange (PS-PS), and (iv)\nmeson-pair-exchange (MPE). The OBE- and MPE-vertices are regulated by gaussian\nform factors producing potentials with a soft behavior near the origin. The\nassignment of the cut-off masses for the BBM-vertices is dependent on the\nSU(3)-classification of the exchanged mesons for OBE, and a similar scheme for\nMPE.

For linear regression, a small, manageable set of data rows can be\nrandomly selected to approximate a tall, skinny data matrix, improving\nprocessing time significantly. For theoretical performance guarantees, each row\nmust be sampled with probability proportional to its statistical leverage\nscore. Unfortunately, leverage scores are difficult to compute.\n  A simple alternative is to sample rows uniformly at random. While this often\nworks, uniform sampling will eliminate critical row information for many\nnatural instances. We take a fresh look at uniform sampling by examining what\ninformation it does preserve. Specifically, we show that uniform sampling\nyields a matrix that, in some sense, well approximates a large fraction of the\noriginal. While this weak form of approximation is not enough for solving\nlinear regression directly, it is enough to compute a better approximation.\n  This observation leads to simple iterative row sampling algorithms for matrix\napproximation that run in input-sparsity time and preserve row structure and\nsparsity at all intermediate steps. In addition to an improved understanding of\nuniform sampling, our main proof introduces a structural result of independent\ninterest: we show that every matrix can be made to have low coherence by\nreweighting a small subset of its rows.\n"]}]
