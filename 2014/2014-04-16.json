Here, we\ninvestigate the escape of Lya, non-ionizing UV-continuum (l = 1300 - 1600\nangstrom in rest frame), and ionizing photons (l < 912 angstrom) from galaxies\nby combining a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation with three-dimensional\nmulti-wavelength radiative transfer calculations.

We find\nthat the escape fraction (fesc) of these different photons shows a complex\ndependence on redshift and galaxy properties: fesc(Lya) and fesc(UV) appear to\nevolve with redshift, and they show similar, weak correlations with galaxy\nproperties such as mass, star formation, metallicity, and dust content, while\nfesc(Ion) remains roughly constant at ~ 0.2 from z ~ 0 - 10, and it does not\nshow clear dependence on galaxy properties. fesc(Lya) correlates more strongly\nwith fesc(UV) than with fesc(Ion).

A skeleton is a metric graph embedded in the Berkovich analytification\nof X. A skeleton has the natural structure of a metrized complex of curves. We\nprove that a finite morphism of K-curves gives rise to a finite harmonic\nmorphism of a suitable choice of skeleta. We use this to give analytic proofs\nof stronger \"skeletonized\" versions of some foundational results\nofLiu-Lorenzini, Coleman, and Liu on simultaneous semistable reduction of\ncurves. We then consider the inverse problem of lifting finite harmonic\nmorphisms of metrized complexes to morphisms of curves over K. We prove that\nevery tamely ramified finite harmonic morphism of \\Lambda-metrized complexes of\nk-curves lifts to a finite morphism of K-curves. If in addition the\nramification points are marked, we obtain a complete classification of all such\nlifts along with their automorphisms. This generalizes and provides new\nanalytic proofs of earlier results of Sa\\\"idi and Wewers. As an application, we\ndiscuss the relationship between harmonic morphisms of metric graphs and\ninduced maps between component groups of N\\'eron models, providing a negative\nanswer to a question of Ribet motivated by number theory.\n  This article is the first in a series of two. The second article contains\nseveral applications of our lifting results to questions about lifting\nmorphisms of tropical curves.\n","Comment: 52 pages, 3 figures.

Although they lie close to the star, several\nhave finite eccentricities and significant misalignment angle with respect to\nthe stellar equator.\n  Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the excited and misaligned\nsub-population of HJs: Lidov-Kozai migration and planet-planet scattering.\nAlthough both are based on completely different dynamical phenomena, they\nappear to be equally effective in generating hot planets. Nevertheless, there\nhas been no detailed analysis comparing the predictions of both mechanisms.\n  In this paper we present numerical simulations of Lidov-Kozai trapping of\nsingle planets in compact binary systems. Both the planet and the binary are\ninitially placed in coplanar orbits, although the inclination of the impactor\nis assumed random. After the passage of the third star, we follow the orbital\nand spin evolution of the planet using analytical models based on the octupole\nexpansion of the secular Hamiltonian.\n  The present work aims at the comparison of the two mechanisms, as an\nexplanation for the excited and inclined HJs in binary systems. We compare the\nresults obtained through this paper with results in Beaug\\'e & Nesvorn\\'y 2012,\nwhere the authors analyze how the planet-planet scattering mechanisms works.\n  Several of the orbital characteristics of the simulated HJs are caused by\ntidal trapping from quasi-parabolic orbits, independent of the driving\nmechanism. These include both the 3-day pile-up and the distribution in the\neccentricity vs semimajor axis plane. However, the distribution of the\ninclinations shows significant differences. While Lidov-Kozai trapping favors a\nmore random distribution, planet-planet scattering shows a large portion of\nbodies nearly aligned with the equator of the central star.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 6 figures.

The first\napproach is based on the representation of the cellular solid as a beam-lattice\nto be homogenized as a micropolar continuum. The second approach is developed\nto analyse periodic cells conceived as a two-dimensional domain consisting of\ndeformable portions such as the ring, the ligaments and possibly an embedded\nmatrix internally to these. This approach is based on a second displacement\ngradient computational homogenization proposed by the Authors (Bacigalupo and\nGambarotta, 2010). The elastic moduli obtained by the micropolar homogenization\nare expressed in analytical form from which it appears explicitly their\ndependence on the parameter of chirality, which is the angle of inclination of\nthe ligaments with respect to the grid of lines connecting the centers of the\nrings. For hexachiral cells, the solution of Liu et al., 2012, is found,\nshowing the auxetic property of the lattice together with the elastic coupling\nmodulus between the normal and the asymmetric strains; a property that has been\nconfirmed here for the tetrachiral lattice. Unlike the hexagonal lattice, the\nclassical constitutive equations of the tetragonal lattice turns out to be\ncharacterized by the coupling between the normal and shear strains through an\nelastic modulus that is an odd function of the parameter of chirality.\nMoreover, this lattice is found to exhibit a remarkable variability of the\nYoung's modulus and of the Poisson's ratio with the direction of the applied\nuniaxial stress. The properties of the equivalent micropolar continuum are\nqualitatively detected also in the equivalent second-gradient continuum.\n"]}]

By treating the cosmological constant\nand its conjugate quantity as thermodynamic pressure and volume respectively,\nwe carry out analytical check of classical Ehrenfest equations. To show that\nour approach is universal, we investigate not only higher-dimensional charged\nAdS black holes, but also rotating AdS black holes. Not only are the examples\nof Einstein gravity shown, but also the example of modified gravity is\npresented for Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes. The specific heat at constant\npressure $C_P$, the volume expansion coefficient $\\alpha$ and the isothermal\ncompressibility coefficient $\\kappa_T$ are found to diverge exactly at the\ncritical point. It has been verified that both Ehrenfest equations hold at the\ncritical point of $P-V$ criticality in the extended phase spaces of AdS black\nholes. So the nature of the critical point of $P-V$ criticality of AdS black\nholes has been demonstrated analytically to be a second-order phase transition.\nThese results are consistent with the nature of liquid-gas phase transition at\nthe critical point. In this sense, our research would deepen the understanding\nof the relations of AdS black holes and liquid-gas systems. Moreover, our\nsuccessful approaches to introduce the original expressions of Erhenfest\nequations directly into black hole phase transition research demonstrate again\nthat black hole thermodynamics is closely related to classical thermodynamics,\nwhich allows us to borrow techniques from classical thermodynamics to\ninvestigate the thermodynamics of black holes.\n","Comment: 12 pages"]}]

It is assumed that there are one white sub-band, and one\ntarget sub-band which is either white or non-white. Under this assumption,\nfirst we propose a novel generalized energy detector (GED) for examining the\ntarget sub-band by exploiting the noise information of the white sub-band,\nthen, we study the tradeoff between the sensing time and achievable throughput\nof the CR network. To study this tradeoff, we consider the sensing time\noptimization for maximizing the throughput of the CR network while\nappropriately protecting the primary network. The sensing time is optimized by\nutilizing the derived detection and false alarm probabilities of the GED. The\nproposed GED does not suffer from signal to noise ratio (SNR) wall (i.e.,\nrobust against noise variance uncertainty) and outperforms the existing signal\ndetectors.
