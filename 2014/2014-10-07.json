Starting with a lower\nbound, we show any coordinate-wise sequential sampling procedure fails in the\nhigh dimensional limit provided the average number of measurements per\ndimension is less then log s/D(P_0||P_1) where s is the level of sparsity and\nD(P_0||P_1) the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the underlying\ndistributions. A series of Sequential Probability Ratio Tests (SPRT) which\nrequire complete knowledge of the underlying distributions is shown to achieve\nthis bound. Motivated by real world experiments and recent work in adaptive\nsensing, we introduce a simple procedure termed Sequential Thresholding which\ncan be implemented when the underlying testing problem satisfies a monotone\nlikelihood ratio assumption. Sequential Thresholding guarantees exact support\nrecovery provided the average number of measurements per dimension grows faster\nthan log s/ D(P_0||P_1), achieving the lower bound.

Supra-exponential growth can thus explain the puzzling\nemergence of supermassive BHs that power luminous quasars so soon after the Big\nBang.\n","Comment: Some typos corrected and minor stylistic changes to conform with\n  final printed version. 18 pages (main article and supplementary materials)\n  and 3 figures.

Now we see that these\nassociations are an intermediate scale in a cascade of hierarchical structures\nthat begins on the ambient Jeans length close to a kiloparsec in size and\ncontinues down to the interiors of clusters, perhaps even to binary and\nmultiple stellar systems. The origin of this structure lies with the dynamical\nnature of cloud and star formation, driven by supersonic turbulence and\ninterstellar gravity. Dynamical star formation is relatively fast compared to\nthe timescale for cosmic accretion, and then the star formation rate keeps up\nwith the accretion rate, leading to a sequence of near-equilibrium states\nduring galaxy formation and evolution. Dynamical star formation also helps to\nexplain the formation of bound clusters, which require a local efficiency that\nexceeds the average by more than an order of magnitude. Efficiency increases\nwith density in a hierarchically structured gas. Cluster formation should vary\nwith environment as the relative degree of cloud self-binding varies, and this\ndepends on the ratio of the interstellar velocity dispersion to the galaxy\nrotation speed. As this ratio increases, galaxies become more clumpy, thicker,\nand have more tightly bound star-forming regions. The formation of old globular\nclusters is understood in this context, with the metal-rich and metal-poor\nglobulars forming in high-mass and low-mass galaxies, respectively, because of\nthe galactic mass-metallicity relation. Metal-rich globulars remain in the\ndisks and bulge regions where they formed, while metal-poor globulars get\ncaptured as parts of satellite galaxies and end up in today's spiral galaxy\nhalos.

The reliability of such\ncommunication systems depends on both the maximum concentration of molecules\nthat a transmitter node is able to produce at the receiver node as well as the\nnumber of bacteria in each nodes. This maximum concentration of molecules falls\nwith distance which makes the communication to the far nodes nearly impossible.\nIn order to alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose to use a\nmolecular relaying node. The relay node can resend the message either by the\ndifferent or the same type of molecules as the original signal from the\ntransmitter. We study two scenarios of relaying.

To answer the question, we investigate relationships between\nseveral formalizations of information-theoretic security for symmetric-key\nencryption and key agreement protocols. Specifically, for symmetric-key\nencryption protocols in a general setting including the case where there exist\ndecryption-errors, we deal with the following formalizations of security:\nformalizations extended (or relaxed) from Shannon's perfect secrecy by using\nmutual information and statistical distance; information-theoretic analogues of\nindistinguishability and semantic security by Goldwasser and Micali; and\ncomposable security by Maurer et al. and Canetti.

Understanding the factors that may positively or negatively\naffect testing effort will point to possibilities for reducing this effort.\nConsequently there is a significant body of research that has investigated\nrelationships between static code properties and testability. The work reported\nin this paper complements this body of research by providing an empirical\nevaluation of the degree of association between runtime properties and\nclass-level testability in object-oriented (OO) systems. The motivation for the\nuse of dynamic code properties comes from the success of such metrics in\nproviding a more complete insight into the multiple dimensions of software\nquality. In particular, we investigate the potential relationships between the\nruntime characteristics of production code, represented by Dynamic Coupling and\nKey Classes, and internal class-level testability. Testability of a class is\nconsidered here at the level of unit tests and two different measures are used\nto characterise those unit tests. The selected measures relate to test scope\nand structure: one is intended to measure the unit test size, represented by\ntest lines of code, and the other is designed to reflect the intended design,\nrepresented by the number of test cases. In this research we found that Dynamic\nCoupling and Key Classes have significant correlations with class-level\ntestability measures. We therefore suggest that these properties could be used\nas indicators of class-level testability.

In contrast to the\nformer approach, the direct connection holds for digraphs as well and applies\nto any field size. More precisely, in [4], a graph family $\\{H_k^q\\}$ is\nintroduced and shown that whether or not the scalar linear index of a digraph\n$G$ is less than or equal to $k$ is equivalent to the existence of a graph\nhomomorphism from the complement of $G$ to the complement of $H_k^q$.\n  Here, we first study the structure of the digraphs $H_k^q$.

In this case, unlike in conventional\nradiotherapy with photon beams, achieving a uniform dose distribution over the\ntumour volume does not imply achieving uniform cancer cell inactivation.\n  In this thesis, an algorithm of the basic element (kernel) of a treatment\nplanning system (TPS) for carbon ion therapy is developed. The algorithm\nconsists of a radiobiological part which suitably corrects for the enhanced\nbiological effect of ion irradiation of cancer cells, and of a physical beam\ntransport model. In the radiobiological component, Katz's track structure model\nof cellular survival is applied, after validating its physical assumptions and\nimproving some aspects of this model. The Katz model offers fast and accurate\npredictions of cell survival in mixed fields of the primary carbon ions and of\ntheir secondary fragments. The physical beam model was based on available\ntabularized data, prepared earlier by Monte Carlo simulations. Both components\nof the developed TPS kernel are combined within an optimization tool, allowing\nthe entrance energy-fluence spectra of the carbon ion beam to be selected in\norder to achieve a pre-assumed uniform (flat) depth-survival profile over the\nSOBP region, assuring uniform cancer cell inactivation over the tumour depth.\n","Comment: PhD thesis, Institute of Nuclear Physics Polish Academy of Sciences,\n  July 2013, PhD Advisors: P.

Here we show that copper\nand silver protected by graphene are viable candidates. Copper films covered\nwith one to a few graphene layers show excellent plasmonics characteristics\nsurpassing those of gold films. They can be used to fabricate plasmonic devices\nand survive for at least a year, even in wet and corroding conditions. As a\nproof of concept, we use the graphene-protected copper to demonstrate\ndielectric loaded plasmonic waveguides and test sensitivity of surface plasmon\nresonances. Our results are likely to initiate a wide use of graphene-protected\nplasmonics.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 5 figures"]}]
