The expected value is considered as an infinite-dimensional integral\nin the parameter space corresponding to the randomness induced by the random\ncoefficient. We use a multi-level algorithm, with the number of QMC points\ndepending on the discretization level, and with a level-dependent dimension\ntruncation strategy. In some scenarios, we show that the overall error is\n$\\mathcal{O}(h^2)$, where $h$ is the finest FE mesh width, or\n$\\mathcal{O}(N^{-1+\\delta})$ for arbitrary $\\delta>0$, where $N$ is the maximal\nnumber of QMC sampling points. For these scenarios, the total work is\nessentially of the order of one single PDE solve at the finest FE\ndiscretization level. The analysis exploits regularity of the parametric\nsolution with respect to both the physical variables (the variables in the\nphysical domain) and the parametric variables (the parameters corresponding to\nrandomness). Families of QMC rules with \"POD weights\" (\"product and order\ndependent weights\") which quantify the relative importance of subsets of the\nvariables are found to be natural for proving convergence rates of QMC errors\nthat are independent of the number of parametric variables.\n"]}]

The supergranulation configuration appears to preserve its\ngeneral shape during approximately nine hours of observations although the\nlarge concentrations in the network did evolve and were slightly displaced, and\ntheir strength either increased or decreased.

In the near future, new facilities will have the capability\nto explore the metric around SgrA$^*$, the supermassive black hole candidate at\nthe Center of our Galaxy, and open a new window to test the Kerr black hole\nhypothesis. In this paper, we compute light curves and images associated with\ncompact emission regions (hot spots) orbiting around Kerr and non-Kerr black\nholes. We study how the analysis of the properties of the radiation emitted by\na hot spot can be used to test the Kerr nature of SgrA$^*$. We find that the\nsole observation of the hot spot light curve can at most constrain a\ncombination of the black hole spin and of possible deviations from the Kerr\nsolution. This happens because the same orbital frequency around a Kerr black\nhole can be found for a non-Kerr object with a different spin parameter. Second\norder corrections in the light curve due to the background geometry are\ntypically too small to be identified. While the observation of the hot spot\ncentroid track can potentially bound possible deviations from the Kerr\nsolution, that is out of reach for the near future VLTI instrument GRAVITY. The\nKerr black hole hypothesis could really be tested in the case of the discovery\nof a radio pulsar in a compact orbit around SgrA$^*$.

However a widely accepted, accurate\nand easy-to-use quantitative formula on it still lacks. In this paper, by\nnormalizing the governing equations, an almost analytical model is developed,\nexcept a single-variable function of the dimensionless Biot number which cannot\nbe determined analytically and is then given by a curve. Formulae for various\ntypical geometries and working conditions are presented. If the stress and the\ndiffusion process are fully coupled (i.e. stress-dependent diffusion), as in\nlithium ion diffusion, the normalized maximum DIS can be characterized by a\ntwo-variable function of a dimensionless coupling parameter and the Biot\nnumber, which is obtained numerically and presented in contour plots. Moreover,\nit is interesting to note that these two parameters, within a wide range, can\nbe further approximately combined into a single dimensionless parameter to\ncharacterize the maximum DIS. These formulae together with curves/contours\nprovide engineers and materialists a simple and easy way to quickly obtain the\nstress and verify the reliability of materials under various typical diffusion\nconditions. Via energy balance analysis, the model of diffusion induced\nfracture is also developed.

Beyond the update of the analysis\nbased on neutron captures on Gd in 2012, Double Chooz has also released a\nconsistent measurement of $\\theta_{13}$ by means of neutron captures on H. The\ncombination of the n-Gd and n-H data samples, as well as 7.23 days of reactor\noff data, in a global rate+shape analysis yields $\\sin^22\\theta_{13} = 0.109\\pm\n0.035$. This measurement has been validated with a new\nbackground-model-independent approach, which compares the observed and expected\nneutrino rates as a function of reactor power. This Reactor Rate Modulation\nanalysis yields $\\sin^22\\theta_{13} = 0.102\\pm 0.043$ when combining the n-Gd\nand n-H samples. The Double Chooz collaboration is currently developing a new\nanalysis increasing the signal-to-background ratio while reducing the\nbackground and detection systematics. This new approach is being prepared as a\nfirst step of the new phase of the experiment that will begin in summer 2014\nwith the operation of a near detector.\n","Comment: Proceedings of the conference Rencontres de Moriond 2014"]}]

These states alternate\nwith intervals of 13-16 yr, and are well defined after 1943. The 40.8 d\nperiodical modulations of the amplitude and the period (i.e. Blazhko effect)\nwere noticed in 1916.
