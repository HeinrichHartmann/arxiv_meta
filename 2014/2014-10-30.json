Analysis of a complete data set, not\nconsidered before, reveals a chain of eruptions to which hard X-ray and\nmicrowave bursts responded. A filament in AR 10501 was not a passive part of a\nlarger flux rope, as usually considered. The filament erupted and gave origin\nto a CME. The chain of events was as follows: i) an eruption at 07:29\naccompanied by a not reported M1.2 class flare associated with the onset of a\nfirst southeastern CME1, which is not responsible for the superstorm; ii) a\nconfined eruption at 07:41 (M3.2 flare) that destabilized the filament; iii)\nthe filament acceleration (07:56); iv) the bifurcation of the eruptive filament\nthat transformed into a large cloud; v) an M3.9 flare in AR 10501 associated to\nthis transformation. The transformation of the filament could be due to its\ninteraction with the magnetic field in the neighborhood of a null point,\nlocated at a height of about 100 Mm above the complex formed by ARs 10501,\n10503, and their environment. The CORONAS-F/SPIRIT telescope observed the cloud\nin 304 A as a large Y-shaped darkening, which moved from the bifurcation region\nto the limb. The masses and kinematics of the cloud and the filament were\nsimilar. Remnants of the filament were not observed in the second southwestern\nCME2, previously regarded as a source of the 20 November superstorm. These\nfacts do not support a simple scenario, in which the interplanetary magnetic\ncloud is considered as a flux rope formed from a structure initially associated\nwith the pre-eruption filament in AR 10501. Observations suggest a possible\nadditional eruption above the bifurcation region close to solar disk center\nbetween 08:07 and 08:17 that could be the source of the superstorm.\n","Comment: 34 pages, 17 figures.

Hence,\nin such applications, this informativeness can and should be exploited to\nenable faster convergence to the optimal solution. In this paper, we introduce\nand formalize the Global MAB (GMAB), in which arms are globally informative\nthrough a global parameter, i.e., choosing an arm reveals information about all\nthe arms. We propose a greedy policy for the GMAB which always selects the arm\nwith the highest estimated expected reward, and prove that it achieves bounded\nparameter-dependent regret. Hence, this policy selects suboptimal arms only\nfinitely many times, and after a finite number of initial time steps, the\noptimal arm is selected in all of the remaining time steps with probability\none. In addition, we also study how the informativeness of the arms about each\nother's rewards affects the speed of learning. Specifically, we prove that the\nparameter-free (worst-case) regret is sublinear in time, and decreases with the\ninformativeness of the arms. We also prove a sublinear in time Bayesian risk\nbound for the GMAB which reduces to the well-known Bayesian risk bound for\nlinearly parameterized bandits when the arms are fully informative.

We give a simple\ndefinition of uniform K-theory for all metric spaces and in the case of\nmanifolds of bounded geometry we give an interpretation via vector bundles of\nbounded geometry over the manifold. This opens up the door for Chern-Weil\ntheory and we define a Chern character map from uniform K-theory of a manifold\nto its bounded de Rham cohomology.

In consequence, and because the\ncontinuum is constructed from linear combinations of basis kets, it is not\nrequired to take the limit N-->oo. Quantum fields are defined on a continuum,\nand are operator valued functions, not distributions. The interacting Dirac\nequation, Maxwell's equations and the Lorentz force law are derived, showing\nthat qed is a complete theory of the electromagnetic interaction, not just a\nperturbation theory and that bare mass and charge are the physical values. Up\nto the accuracy of measurement, predictions of perturbation theory are\nidentical to those of standard qed with all loop divergences removed. The\nstandard perturbation expansion is asymptotic to the finite expansion given\nhere.\n","Comment: Published version. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:1205.4607, arXiv:gr-qc/0508077"]}]

This is a consequence of\nthree basic principles: superposition (every quantum is in many states at the\nsame time), correspondence (only the net state of interference is real), and\nuncertainty (conjugate variables have inversely proportional spectra). The two\nconditions have only been verified with entangled pairs of quanta. It is not\npossible to perform incompatible measurements on the same entity. Hence, the\nprinciples of quantum mechanics cannot be verified directly. At least one of\nthem could be wrong. Though, as shown by EPR, this can only be true if\nnon-locality is at work. In light of the latest developments in quantum theory,\neven that assumption is insufficient. Non-local effects are either unable to\ncross Bell's limit, or forced to violate Tsirelson's bound. New layers of\nhidden variables are required to maintain belief in action-at-a-distance, but\nthe three principles cannot be rejected in any case. Therefore, quantum\nmechanics is immune to this challenge. The hypothesis of non-locality is\nsuperfluous.\n","Comment: 10 pages. No math. No figures. 100% qualitative analysis"]}]
