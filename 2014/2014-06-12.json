In the clean system, the density of states vanishes\nquadratically at the Dirac point. Disorder is known to be perturbatively\nirrelevant, and previous theoretical work has assumed that the Dirac semimetal\nphase, characterized by a vanishing density of states, survives at weak\ndisorder, with a finite disorder phase transition to a diffusive metal with a\nnon-vanishing density of states. In this paper we show that nonperturbative\neffects from rare regions, which are missed by conventional disorder-averaged\ncalculations, instead give rise to a nonzero density of states for any nonzero\ndisorder. Thus, there is no Dirac semimetal phase at non-zero disorder. The\nresults are established both by a heuristic scaling argument and via a\nsystematic saddle point analysis. We also discuss transport near the Dirac\npoint. At the Dirac point, we argue that transport is diffusive, and proceeds\nvia hopping between rare resonances. As one moves in chemical potential away\nfrom the Dirac point, there are interesting intermediate-energy regimes where\nthe rare regions produce scattering resonances that determine the DC\nconductivity. We derive a scaling theory of transport near disordered 3D Dirac\npoints.

The\nNMR investigations demonstrate, that the samples are obtained with a partial\ncarbonization of initial aromatic compounds and do not reach a state of glassy\ncarbon. The magnetization, longitudinal nonlinear response to a weak ac field\nand electron magnetic resonance data give evidences for presence of FM clusters\nin the samples well above 300 K. A short-range character of the FM ordering in\nthe Au-doped sample transforms below T$_C \\approx$ 210 K into another\ninhomogeneous FM state. Besides the FM clusters, this state contains a\nsubsystem with a long-range FM ordering (matrix) formed by paramagnetic\ncenters, existing outside the clusters. The nonlinear response data suggest a\npercolative character of the long-range FM matrix, which is connected probably\nwith a porous sample structure. The magnetization data give evidence for the\nformation of an inhomogeneous state in the Co-doped sample, similar to that in\nthe Au-doped one. However, this state is formed at higher temperatures, lying\nwell above 350 K, and exhibits a more homogeneous arrangement of the FM\nnanoparticles and the FM matrix. Temperature dependence of the magnetization in\nthe Au-doped sample is attributable to changes of the domain formation regime\nin the FM matrix on cooling, connected with the inhomogeneous character of its\nFM state. Such peculiarity is absent in the Co-doped sample below 350 K, which\nis in agreement with formation of the FM state in this sample at much higher\ntemperatures. Further cooling below T ~ 3(10) K leads to a steep increase of\nthe magnetization in both samples. This is attributable to the domain\nrearrangement in the inhomogeneous FM state at low temperatures.\n","Comment: 32 pages with 12 figures"]}]

For a given trajectory with state jumps, we show\nhow to construct an approximation of a nearby perturbed trajectory\ncorresponding to a small variation of the initial condition and input. A major\ncomplication in the construction of such an approximation is that, in general,\nthe jump times corresponding to a nearby perturbed trajectory are not equal to\nthose of the nominal one. The main contribution of this work is the development\nof a notion of error to clarify in which sense the approximate trajectory is,\nat each instant of time, a firstorder approximation of the perturbed\ntrajectory. This notion of error naturally finds application in the (local)\ntracking problem of a time-varying reference trajectory of a hybrid system. To\nillustrate the possible use of this new error definition in the context of\ntrajectory tracking, we outline how the standard linear trajectory tracking\ncontrol for nonlinear systems -based on linear quadratic regulator (LQR) theory\nto compute the optimal feedback gain- could be generalized for hybrid systems.\n"]}]
