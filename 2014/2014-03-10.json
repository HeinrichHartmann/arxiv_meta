Any\nsuch quantization yields a structure of Poisson group on G, and one of Lie\nbialgebra on g : correspondingly, one has dual Poisson groups G^* and a dual\nLie bialgebra g^*. In this context, we introduce suitable notions of quantum\nsubgroup and of quantum homogeneous space, in three versions: weak, proper and\nstrict (also called \"flat\" in the literature).

However,\nfocusing with conventional lenses is restricted to one transport mean free path\nin scattering media, limiting both optical penetration depth and resolution.\nFocusing deeper is possible by using optical phase conjugation or wavefront\nshaping to compensate for the scattering. For practical applications, wavefront\nshaping offers the advantage of a robust optical system that is less sensitive\nto optical misalignment.

Thus, it is\ncrucial to have a mechanism for fast and accurate detection of an agent\nmaliciously tampering with the data---for both preventing attacks that may lead\nto blackouts, and for routine monitoring and control tasks of current and\nfuture grids. We propose a decentralized false data injection detection scheme\nbased on Markov graph of the bus phase angles. We utilize the Conditional\nCovariance Test (CCT) to learn the structure of the grid.

Therefore, a discrepancy between\ncalculated Markov graph and learned structure should trigger the alarm. Local\ngrid topology is available online from the protection system and we exploit it\nto check for mismatch. Should a mismatch be detected, we use correlation\nanomaly score to detect the set of attacked nodes. Our method can detect the\nmost recent stealthy deception attack on the power grid that assumes knowledge\nof bus-branch model of the system and is capable of deceiving the state\nestimator, damaging power network observatory, control, monitoring, demand\nresponse and pricing schemes. Specifically, under the stealthy deception\nattack, the Markov graph of phase angles changes. In addition to detect a state\nof attack, our method can detect the set of attacked nodes. To the best of our\nknowledge, our remedy is the first to comprehensively detect this sophisticated\nattack and it does not need additional hardware. Moreover, our detection scheme\nis successful no matter the size of the attacked subset. Simulation of various\npower networks confirms our claims.\n"]}]
