A paradigmatic example is the time evolution of a domain-wall state of\na spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain, the so-called domain-wall melting. The model can\nbe implemented by having two species of bosonic atoms with unity filling and\nstrong on-site repulsion U in an optical lattice.

We are particularly interested in the\neffects of defects that originate from an imperfect preparation of the initial\nstate. Typical defects are holes (empty sites) and flipped spins. We show that\nthe dominating effects of holes on observables like the spatially resolved\nmagnetization can be taken account of by a linear combination of spatially\nshifted observables from the clean case. For sufficiently large U, further\neffects due to holes become negligible.

Recent work has reinvigorated the study of\nbimetric theories of gravity and massive gravity theories. One of the most\ninteresting predictions of these theories, as well as some string theories, is\nthe subluminal speed of propagating gravitational waves. Multi-messenger\nastronomy provides a unique opportunity to put limits on the difference (either\npositive or negative) between the propagation speed of electromagnetic and\ngravitational waves from these sources. This paper considers limits from\nmulti-messenger cases across the planned measurable spectrum: first, the limits\nfrom isolated pulsars based on the current best limits from LIGO on\ngravitational wave emission, second, the limits from ultra-compact binaries\nthat will be visible to a low-frequency space-based gravitational wave\nobservatory like LISA, and third, limits from super massive black hole binaries\nusing pulsar timing arrays. The required phase comparison between the\nelectromagnetic signal and the gravitational wave signal is derived and,\nassuming a null result in that comparison, the current bounds on emission are\nused to place limits on alternative theories that exhibit propagation delays.\nObservations of the pulsars in the most sensitive range of LIGO could put an\nupper limit on the graviton mass as low as $10^{-38}\\frac{eV}{c^{2}}$ and an\nupper limit on the fractional difference between the gravitational wave and\nelectromagnetic wave speeds as low as $10^{-9}$.

Most of\nthese models come with a parameter $t$ (usually related to edge density) and a\n(model dependent) critical time $t_c$ which specifies when a giant component\nemerges. There is evidence to support that for a wide class of models, under\nmoment conditions, the nature of this emergence is universal and looks like the\nclassical Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graph, in the sense of the critical scaling\nwindow and (a) the sizes of the components in this window (all maximal\ncomponent sizes scaling like $n^{2/3}$) and (b) the structure of components\n(rescaled by $n^{-1/3}$) converge to random fractals related to the continuum\nrandom tree. Till date, (a) has been proven for a number of models using\ndifferent techniques while (b) has been proven for only two models, the\nclassical Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graph and the rank-1 inhomogeneous random\ngraph. The aim of this paper is to develop a general program for proving such\nresults. The program requires three main ingredients: (i) in the critical\nscaling window, components merge approximately like the multiplicative\ncoalescent (ii) scaling exponents of susceptibility functions are the same as\nthe Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graph and (iii) macroscopic averaging of expected\ndistances between random points in the same component in the barely subcritical\nregime. We show that these apply to a number of fundamental random graph models\nincluding the configuration model, inhomogeneous random graphs modulated via a\nfinite kernel and bounded size rules. Thus these models all belong to the\ndomain of attraction of the classical Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graph.

Despite the fact that retweets are routinely studied\nand reported, many important questions remain about user motivation for their\nuse and their significance. In this paper we answer the question of what users\nindicate when they retweet. We do so in a comprehensive fashion, by employing a\nuser survey, a study of user profiles, and a meta-analysis of over 100 research\npublications from three related major conferences. Our findings indicate that\nretweeting indicates not only interest in a message, but also trust in the\nmessage and the originator, and agreement with the message contents. However,\nthe findings are significantly weaker for journalists, some of whom beg to\ndiffer declaring so in their own user profiles. On the other hand, the\ninclusion of hashtags strengthens the signal of agreement, especially when the\nhashtags are related to politics. While in the past there have been additional\nclaims in the literature about possible reasons for retweeting, many of them\nare not supported, especially given the technical changes introduced recently\nby Twitter.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 2 figures, extended abstract"]}]

The standard\nform of the electric AB effect involves having particles (such as electrons)\nmove in regions with zero electric field but different electric potentials.\nWhen a particle is recombined with itself, it will have a different phase,\nwhich can show up as a change in the way the single particle interferes with\nitself when it is recombined with itself. In the case where one has\nquasi-static fields and potentials, the particle will invariably encounter\nfringing fields, which makes the theoretical and experimental status of the\nelectric AB effect much less clear than that of the magnetic (or vector) AB\neffect. Here we propose using time varying fields outside of a spherical shell,\nand potentials inside a spherical shell to experimentally test the scalar AB\neffect. In our proposal a quantum system will always be in a field-free region\nbut subjected to a non-zero time-varying potentials. Furthermore, our system\nwill not be spatially split and brought back together as in the magnetic AB\nexperiment. Therefore there is no spatial interference and hence no shift in a\nspatial interference pattern to observe. Rather, there arises purely temporal\ninterference phenomena. As in the magnetic AB experiments, these effects are\nnon-classical. We present two versions of this idea: (i) a Josephson temporal\ninterferometry experiment inside a superconducting spherical shell with a\ntime-varying surface charge; (ii) a two-level atom experiment in which the\natomic spectrum acquires FM sidebands when it is placed inside a spherical\nshell whose exterior mass is sinusoidally varying with time.

Another main result is the construction of a huge class of global\nconformal invariants taking into account the action of the group of conformal\ndiffeomorphisms (i.e., the conformal gauge group). These invariants are not of\nthe same type as the conformal invariants considered by Spyros Alexakis in his\nsolution of the Deser-Schwimmer conjecture. The arguments in this paper rely on\nvarious tools from noncommutative geometry, although ultimately the main\nresults are stated in a differential-geometric fashion. In particular, a\ncrucial use is made of the conformal invariance of the Connes-Chern character\nof conformal Dirac spectral triple of Connes-Moscovici.\n","Comment: 40 pages"]}]
