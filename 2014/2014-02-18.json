Our main dynamical analysis will\nbe focused on the behavior of the primary galaxy. We investigate in detail the\nregular or chaotic nature of motion, in two different cases: (i) the\ntime-independent model in both 2D and 3D dynamical systems and (ii) the\ntime-evolving 3D model. Our numerical calculations indicate that the percentage\nof the chaotic orbits increases when the primary galaxy has a dense and massive\nnucleus. The presence of the dense galactic core also increases the stellar\nvelocities near the center of the galaxy. Moreover, for small values of the\ndistance R between the two bodies, low-energy stars display chaotic motion,\nnear the central region of the galaxy, while for larger values of the distance\nR, the motion in active galaxies is entirely regular for low-energy stars. Our\nsimulations suggest that in galaxies with a satellite companion, the chaotic\nnature of motion is not only a result of the galactic interaction between the\nprimary galaxy and its companion, but also a result caused by the presence of\nthe dense nucleus in the core of the primary galaxy. Theoretical arguments are\npresented in order to support and interpret the numerically derived outcomes.\nFurthermore, we follow the 3D evolution of the primary galaxy, when mass is\ntransported adiabatically from the disk to the nucleus.

Relying on a result of simultaneous Diophantine\napproximation, a real interference alignment scheme with joint receive antenna\nprocessing is developed. The scheme is used to obtain an achievable DoF region.\nThe proposed DoF region includes two previously known results as special cases,\nnamely 1) the total DoF of a $K$-user interference channel with $N$ antennas at\neach node, $(K, [N], [N])$ channel, is $NK/2$; and 2) the total DoF of a $(K,\n[M], [N])$ channel is at least $KMN/(M+N)$. We next explore\nconstant-coefficient interference networks with $K$ transmitters and $J$\nreceivers, all having $N$ antennas. Each transmitter emits an independent\nmessage and each receiver requests an arbitrary subset of the messages.\nEmploying the novel joint receive antenna processing, the DoF region for this\nset-up is obtained. We finally consider wireless X networks where each node is\nallowed to have an arbitrary number of antennas. It is shown that the joint\nreceive antenna processing can be used to establish an achievable DoF region,\nwhich is larger than what is possible with antenna splitting. As a special case\nof the derived achievable DoF region for constant coefficient X network, the\ntotal DoF of wireless X networks with the same number of antennas at all nodes\nand with joint antenna processing is tight while the best inner bound based on\nantenna splitting cannot meet the outer bound.

Only 40 intersections are sufficient for a reliable\nsub-millimeter image reconstruction of a point source embedded in a scattering\nvolume of water inside a voxel volume of about 1 mm^3 ('high-resolution mode').\nMoreover, starting with an injected activity of 400 MBq for ^76Br, the same\nnumber of only about 40 reconstructed intersections are needed in case of a\nlarger voxel volume of 2 x 2 x 3~mm^3 ('high-sensitivity mode'). Requiring such\na low number of reconstructed events significantly reduces the required\nacquisition time for image reconstruction (in the above case to about 140 s)\nand thus may open up the perspective for a quasi real-time imaging.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 5 figutes, 3 tables"]}]

Our best estimate of\nthe local Galactic escape speed, which we define as the minimum speed required\nto reach three virial radii $R_{340}$, is $533^{+54}_{-41}$ km/s (90%\nconfidence) with an additional 5% systematic uncertainty, where $R_{340}$ is\nthe Galactocentric radius encompassing a mean over-density of 340 times the\ncritical density for closure in the Universe. From the escape speed we further\nderive estimates of the mass of the Galaxy using a simple mass model with two\noptions for the mass profile of the dark matter halo: an unaltered and an\nadiabatically contracted Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW) sphere. If we fix the\nlocal circular velocity the latter profile yields a significantly higher mass\nthan the un-contracted halo, but if we instead use the statistics on halo\nconcentration parameters in large cosmological simulations as a constraint we\nfind very similar masses for both models.

A necessary condition for a\nsimplicial mapping of a mesh to be injective is that it either maintains the\norientation of all elements or flips all the elements. However, these\nconditions are known to be insufficient for injectivity of a simplicial map. In\nthis paper we provide additional simple conditions that, together with the\nabove mentioned necessary conditions guarantee injectivity of the simplicial\nmap.\n  The first set of conditions generalizes classical global inversion theorems\nto the mesh (piecewise-linear) case. That is, proves that in case the boundary\nsimplicial map is bijective and the necessary condition holds then the map is\ninjective and onto the target domain. The second set of conditions is concerned\nwith mapping of a mesh to a polytope and replaces the (often hard) requirement\nof a bijective boundary map with a collection of linear constraints and\nguarantees that the resulting map is injective over the interior of the mesh\nand onto. These linear conditions provide a practical tool for optimizing a map\nof the mesh onto a given polytope while allowing the boundary map to adjust\nfreely and keeping the injectivity property in the interior of the mesh. The\nthird set of conditions adds to the second set the requirement that the\nboundary maps are orientation preserving as-well (with a proper definition of\nboundary map orientation). This set of conditions guarantees that the map is\ninjective on the boundary of the mesh as-well as its interior. Several\nexperiments using the sufficient conditions are shown for mapping triangular\nmeshes.\n  A secondary goal of this paper is to advocate and develop the tool of degree\nin the context of mesh processing.\n"]}]

Early methods mainly fall into two paradigms with certain\nbenefits and drawbacks: (1)Greedy algorithms, selecting seed nodes one by one,\ngive a guaranteed accuracy relying on the accurate approximation of influence\nspread with high computational cost; (2)Heuristic algorithms, estimating\ninfluence spread using efficient heuristics, have low computational cost but\nunstable accuracy.\n  We first point out that greedy algorithms are essentially finding a\nself-consistent ranking, where nodes' ranks are consistent with their\nranking-based marginal influence spread. This insight motivates us to develop\nan iterative ranking framework, i.e., IMRank, to efficiently solve influence\nmaximization problem under independent cascade model. Starting from an initial\nranking, e.g., one obtained from efficient heuristic algorithm, IMRank finds a\nself-consistent ranking by reordering nodes iteratively in terms of their\nranking-based marginal influence spread computed according to current ranking.\nWe also prove that IMRank definitely converges to a self-consistent ranking\nstarting from any initial ranking. Furthermore, within this framework, a\nlast-to-first allocating strategy and a generalization of this strategy are\nproposed to improve the efficiency of estimating ranking-based marginal\ninfluence spread for a given ranking. In this way, IMRank achieves both\nremarkable efficiency and high accuracy by leveraging simultaneously the\nbenefits of greedy algorithms and heuristic algorithms.

The physical scenario is that of a conical,\nmagnetized plasma jet having a periodical (P1) increase of relativistic\nparticles, Nrel, at a specific orbital phase, as predicted by accretion in the\neccentric orbit of LSI+61303. Jet precession (P2) changes the angle, eta,\nbetween jet axis and line of sight, thereby inducing variable Doppler boosting.\nThe problem is defined in spherical geometry, and the optical depth through the\nprecessing jet is calculated by taking into account that the plasma is\nstratified along the jet axis. The synchrotron emission of such a jet was\ncalculated and we fitted the resulting flux density Smodel(t) to the observed\nflux density obtained during a 6.5-year monitoring of LSI+61303 by the Green\nBank radio interferometer. Our physical model for the system LSI+61303 is not\nonly able to reproduce the long-term modulation in the radio emission, but it\nalso reproduces all the other observed characteristics of the radio source, the\norbital modulation of the outbursts, their orbital phase shift, and their\nspectral index properties. Moreover, a correspondence seems to exist between\nvariations in the ejection angle induced by precession and the rapid rotation\nin position angle observed in VLBA images. We conclude that the peak of the\nlong-term modulation occurs when the jet electron density is around its maximum\nand the approaching jet is forming the smallest possible angle with the line of\nsight. This coincidence of maximum number of emitting particles and maximum\nDoppler boosting of their emission occurs every 1667 days and creates the\nlong-term modulation observed in LSI+61303.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

Most\nprevious approaches predict users' friendship based on their historical\nrecords, such as their existing friendship, social interactions, etc. However,\nin reality, most users have limited friends in a single network, and the data\ncan be very sparse. The sparsity problem causes existing methods to overfit the\nrare observations and suffer from serious performance degradation. This is\nparticularly true when a new social network just starts to form. We observe\nthat many of today's social networks are composite in nature, where people are\noften engaged in multiple networks. In addition, users' friendships are always\ncorrelated, for example, they are both friends on Facebook and Google+. Thus,\nby considering those overlapping users as the bridge, the friendship knowledge\nin other networks can help predict their friendships in the current network.\nThis can be achieved by exploiting the knowledge in different networks in a\ncollective manner. However, as each individual network has its own properties\nthat can be incompatible and inconsistent with other networks, the naive\nmerging of all networks into a single one may not work well. The proposed\nsolution is to extract the common behaviors between different networks via a\nhierarchical Bayesian model. It captures the common knowledge across networks,\nwhile avoiding negative impacts due to network differences.
