We shall see here that the\ngeometric interpretation can be useful to develop a new approach to some old\nclassical problems as well as to obtain several new results, mostly related to\nhyperbolic geometry. For example, we obtain One Radius Theorem saying that any\ntwo radial eigenfunctions of a Hyperbolic Laplacian assuming the value 1 at the\norigin can not assume any other common value within some interval [0, p], where\nthe length of this interval depends only on the location of the eigenvalues on\nthe complex plane and does not depend on the distance between them.\n","Comment: 147 pages, 23 PostScript figures, phd thesis"]}]
