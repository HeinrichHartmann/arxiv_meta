However, the decoding performance\nof polar codes with traditional successive-cancellation (SC) algorithm cannot\nmatch that of the low-density parity-check (LDPC) or turbo codes. Because SC\nlist (SCL) decoding algorithm can significantly improve the error-correcting\nperformance of polar codes, design of SCL decoders is important for polar codes\nto be deployed in practical applications. However, because the prior latency\nreduction approaches for SC decoders are not applicable for SCL decoders, these\nlist decoders suffer from the long latency bottleneck. In this paper, we\npropose a multi-bit-decision approach that can significantly reduce latency of\nSCL decoders. First, we present a reformulated SCL algorithm that can perform\nintermediate decoding of 2 bits together. The proposed approach, referred as\n2-bit reformulated SCL (2b-rSCL) algorithm, can reduce the latency of SCL\ndecoder from (3n-2) to (2n-2) clock cycles without any performance loss. Then,\nwe extend the idea of 2-bit-decision to general case, and propose a general\ndecoding scheme that can perform intermediate decoding of any 2K bits\nsimultaneously. This general approach, referred as 2K-bit reformulated SCL\n(2Kb-rSCL) algorithm, can reduce the overall decoding latency to as short as\nn/2K-2-2 cycles.

We use a well-defined and homogeneous sample of spiral host galaxies\nof 692 SNe from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in different stages of\ngalaxy-galaxy interaction and activity classes of nucleus. We propose that the\nunderlying mechanisms shaping the number ratios of SNe types can be interpreted\nwithin the framework of interaction-induced star formation, in addition to the\nknown relations between morphologies and stellar populations. We find a strong\ntrend in behaviour of the NIa/NCC ratio depending on host morphology, such that\nearly spirals include more Type Ia SNe. The NIbc/NII ratio is higher in a broad\nbin of early-type hosts. The NIa/NCC ratio is nearly constant when changing\nfrom normal, perturbed to interacting galaxies, then declines in merging\ngalaxies, whereas it jumps to the highest value in post-merging/remnant\ngalaxies. In contrast, the NIbc/NII ratio jumps to the highest value in merging\ngalaxies and slightly declines in post-merging/remnant subsample. The\ninterpretation is that the star formation rates and morphologies of galaxies,\nwhich are strongly affected in the final stages of interaction, have an impact\non the number ratios of SNe types. The NIa/NCC (NIbc/NII) ratio increases\n(decreases) from star-forming to active galactic nuclei (AGN) classes of\ngalaxies. These variations are consistent with the scenario of an\ninteraction-triggered starburst evolving into AGN during the later stages of\ninteraction, accompanied with the change of star formation and transformation\nof the galaxy morphology into an earlier type.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 9 figures, 16 tables, online data"]}]

There is\nincreasing evidence that cell signaling pathways encode temporal information,\nand thus cell fate may be determined by the dynamics of protein levels. We have\ndeveloped a mathematical model to describe the transient dynamics of the\nHIF-1{\\alpha} protein measured in single cells subjected to hypoxic shock. The\nessential characteristics of these data are modeled with a system of\ndifferential equations describing the feedback inhibition between HIF-1{\\alpha}\nand Prolyl Hydroxylases (PHD) oxygen sensors. Heterogeneity in the single-cell\ndata is accounted for through parameter variation in the model. We previously\nidentified the PHD2 isoform as the main PHD responsible for controlling the\nHIF-1{\\alpha} transient response, and make here testable predictions regarding\nHIF-1{\\alpha} dynamics subject to repetitive hypoxic pulses. The model is\nfurther developed to describe the dynamics of HIF-1{\\alpha} in cells cultured\nas 3D spheroids, with oxygen dynamics parameterized using experimental\nmeasurements of oxygen within spheroids.

Hence, many\nimplementations rely on repeated incremental validation of every read of the\ntransaction to always guarantee for a consistent view of shared data. Because\nthis eager validation technique generates significant processing costs several\nproposals have been published to establish a sandbox for transactions, which\ntransparently prevents or suppresses those errors and thereby allows to reduce\nthe frequency of in-flight validations.\n  The most comprehensive sandboxing concept of transactions in software\ntransactional memory based on deferred updates and considering unmanaged\nlanguages, integrates multiple techniques such as signal interposition,\nout-of-band validation and static and dynamic instrumentation. The latter\ncomprises the insertion of a validation barrier in front of every direct write\nwhich addresses the execution stack of the thread and potentially results from\nunvalidated reads.\n  This paper basically results from a review of this sandboxing approach, which\nrevealed some improvements for sandboxing on C/C++. Based on knowledge about\nthe runtime environment and the compiler an error model has been developed to\nidentify critical paths to application visible errors. This analysis lead to a\nconcept for stack protection with less frequent validation, an alternative\nout-of-band validation technique and revealed additional risks of so-called\nwaivered regions without instrumentation inside transactions.\n"]}]

We build on recent findings (Moarref et al., J.

The resolvent modes and the weights represent the linear amplification\nmechanisms and the scaling influence of the nonlinear interactions in the\nNavier-Stokes equations (NSE), respectively (McKeon & Sharma, J.

Our main result is that\nself-similarity enables order reduction in modeling the logarithmic region by\nestablishing a quantitative link between the self-similar structures and the\nvelocity spectra. Specifically, the energy intensities, the Reynolds stresses,\nand the energy budget are expressed in terms of the resolvent modes with speeds\ncorresponding to the top of the logarithmic region. The weights of the triad\nmodes -the modes that directly interact via the quadratic nonlinearity in the\nNSE- are coupled via the interaction coefficients that depend solely on the\nresolvent modes (McKeon et al., Phys.

It is shown that the interaction coefficients for\nthe triad modes that belong to a triad hierarchy follow an exponential\nfunction.

In a uniform bulk material it leads to very\nshort spin lifetimes. However the lifetime increases dramatically when the\ndonor is placed into a quasi-2D phononic crystal and the energy of the Zeeman\nsplitting is tuned to lie within a phonon bandgap. In this situation single\nphonon processes are suppressed by energy conservation. The remaining\ntwo-phonon decay channel is very slow. The Zeeman splitting within the gap can\nbe fine tuned to induce a strong, long-range coupling between the spins of\nremote donors via exchange by virtual phonons. This, in turn, opens a very\nefficient way to manipulate the quits. We explore various geometries of\nphononic crystals in order to maximize the coherent qubit-qubit coupling while\nkeeping the decay rate minimal. We find that phononic crystals with unit cell\nsizes of 100-150 nm are viable candidates for quantum computing applications\nand suggest several spin-resonance experiments to verify our theoretical\npredictions.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 7 figures"]}]

A status update on the data\ndistributions or the compute nodes may have significant repercussions on the\nchoice of which query plan should be running. Ideally, new system architectures\nwould be able to make cost-based decisions about reallocating work, migrating\ndata, etc., and react quickly as real-time status information becomes\navailable. Existing cost-based query optimizers are not incremental in nature,\nand must be run \"from scratch\" upon each status or cost update. Hence, they\ngenerally result in adaptive schemes that can only react slowly to updates.\n  An open question has been whether it is possible to build a cost-based\nre-optimization architecture for adaptive query processing in a streaming or\nrepeated query execution environment, e.g., by incrementally updating optimizer\nstate given new cost information. We show that this can be achieved\nbeneficially, especially for stream processing workloads. Our techniques build\nupon the recently proposed approach of formulating query plan enumeration as a\nset of recursive datalog queries; we develop a variety of novel optimization\napproaches to ensure effective pruning in both static and incremental cases. We\nimplement our solution within an existing research query processing system, and\nshow that it effectively supports cost-based initial optimization as well as\nfrequent adaptivity.\n"]}]
