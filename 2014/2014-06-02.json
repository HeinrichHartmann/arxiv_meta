Traditionally, Bell inequalities have\nbeen used to describe the restrictions imposed by causal structures on marginal\ndistributions. However, some structures give rise to non-convex constraints on\nthe accessible data, and it has recently been noted that linear inequalities on\nthe observable entropies capture these situations more naturally. In this\npaper, we show the versatility of the entropic approach by greatly expanding\nthe set of scenarios for which entropic constraints are known. For the first\ntime, we treat Bell scenarios involving multiple parties and multiple\nobservables per party. Going beyond the usual Bell setup, we exhibit\ninequalities for scenarios with extra conditional independence assumptions, as\nwell as a limited amount of shared randomness between the parties. Many of our\nresults are based on a geometric observation: Bell polytopes for two-outcome\nmeasurements can be naturally imbedded into the convex cone of attainable\nmarginal entropies. Thus, any entropic inequality can be translated into one\nvalid for probabilities. In some situations the converse also holds, which\nprovides us with a rich source of candidate entropic inequalities.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 7 figures, many cones.

Here we extend the earlier work by\nstudying the dependence of the low scale EDMs on the constrained but not fully\nknown fundamental Yukawa couplings. The dominant contribution is from two loop\ndiagrams and is not sensitive to the choice of Yukawa texture. The electron EDM\nshould not be found to be larger than about $ 5\\times 10^{-30} e$ cm, and the\nneutron EDM should not be larger than about $5\\times 10^{-29}e$ cm. These\nvalues are quite a bit smaller than the reported predictions from Split SUSY\nand typical effective theories, but much larger than the Standard Model\nprediction. Also, since models with random phases typically give much larger\nEDMs, it is a significant testable prediction of compactified M-theory that the\nEDMs should not be above these upper limits. The actual EDMs can be below the\nlimits, so once they are measured they could provide new insight into the\nfundamental Yukawa couplings of leptons and quarks. We comment also on the role\nof strong CP violation. EDMs probe fundamental physics near the Planck scale.\n","Comment: 33 pages, 2 figures"]}]

The\nextended Chandra mission provides a long observing baseline with stable and\nwell-calibrated instruments, enabling temporal studies over time-scales from\nmilliseconds to years. In this report we present a selection of highlights that\nillustrate how observations using Chandra, sometimes alone, but often in\nconjunction with other telescopes, have deepened, and in some instances\nrevolutionized, our understanding of topics as diverse as protoplanetary\nnebulae; massive stars; supernova explosions; pulsar wind nebulae; the\nsuperfluid interior of neutron stars; accretion flows around black holes; the\ngrowth of supermassive black holes and their role in the regulation of star\nformation and growth of galaxies; impacts of collisions, mergers, and feedback\non growth and evolution of groups and clusters of galaxies; and properties of\ndark matter and dark energy.\n","Comment: 74 pages, 28 figures, This is an author-created, un-copyedited\n  version of an article to be published in Reports on Progress in Physics"]}]

These sensors are normally embedded in soft,\nsynthetic materials for protecting the subsurface sensor from damage or for\nbetter hand-to-object contact. It is important to understand how the mechanical\nsignals transmit from the artificial skin to the embedded tactile sensors. In\nthis paper, we made use of a finite element model of an artificial fingertip\nwith viscoelastic and hyperelastic behaviors to investigate the subsurface\npressure profiles when flat, curved, and Braille surfaces were indented on the\nsurface of the model. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of 1, 3 and 5 mm\nthickness of the skin on the subsurface pressure profiles. The simulation\nresults were experimentally validated using a 25.4 {\\mu}m thin pressure\ndetecting film that was able to follow the contours of a non-planar surface,\nwhich is analogous to an artificial bone. Results show that the thickness of\nthe artificial skin has an effect on the peak pressure, on the span of the\npressure distribution, and on the overall shape of the pressure profile that\nwas encoded on a curved subsurface structure.

The profiled nature of the density of water with the strongly\nadsorbed first layer affects the approach of amino acids to the surface and\ngenerates either repulsion or weak binding. The largest binding energy is found\nfor tyrosine interacting with the surface in which the Zn ions are at the top.\nIt is equal to 7 kJ/mol which is comparable to that of the hydrogen bonds in a\nprotein. This makes the adsorption of amino acids onto the ZnO surface much\nweaker than onto the well studied surface of gold. Under vacuum, binding\nenergies are more than 40 times stronger (for one of the surfaces). The precise\nmanner in which water molecules interact with a given surface influences the\nbinding energies in a way that depends on the surface. Among the four\nconsidered surfaces the one with Zn at the top is recognized as binding almost\nall amino acids with an average binding energy of 2.60 kJ/mol. Another (O at\nthe top) is non-binding for most amino acids. For binding situations the\naverage energy is 0.66 kJ/mol. The remaining two surfaces bind nearly as many\namino acids as they do not and the average binding energies are 1.46 and 1.22\nkJ/mol.

In this paper, we introduce a region\ntemplate abstraction for the efficient management of common data types used in\nanalysis of large datasets of high resolution images on clusters of hybrid\ncomputing nodes. The region template provides a generic container template for\ncommon data structures, such as points, arrays, regions, and object sets,\nwithin a spatial and temporal bounding box. The region template abstraction\nenables different data management strategies and data I/O implementations,\nwhile providing a homogeneous, unified interface to the application for data\nstorage and retrieval. The execution of region templates applications is\ncoordinated by a runtime system that supports efficient execution in hybrid\nmachines. Region templates applications are represented as hierarchical\ndataflow in which each computing stage may be represented as another dataflow\nof finer-grain tasks. A number of optimizations for hybrid machines are\navailable in our runtime system, including performance-aware scheduling for\nmaximizing utilization of computing devices and techniques to reduce impact of\ndata transfers between CPUs and GPUs. An experimental evaluation on a\nstate-of-the-art hybrid cluster using a microscopy imaging study shows that\nthis abstraction adds negligible overhead (about 3%) and achieves good\nscalability.\n","Comment: 43 pages, 17 figures"]}]

This is especially the case of synchronous\nreactive control loops with a fixed clock; the WCET of the loop body must not\nexceed the clock period. We compute the WCET (or at least a close upper bound\nthereof) as the solution of an optimization modulo theory problem that takes\ninto account the semantics of the program, in contrast to other methods that\ncompute the longest path whether or not it is feasible according to these\nsemantics. Optimization modulo theory extends satisfiability modulo theory\n(SMT) to maximization problems. Immediate encodings of WCET problems into SMT\nyield formulas intractable for all current production-grade solvers; this is\ninherent to the DPLL(T) approach to SMT implemented in these solvers. By\nconjoining some appropriate \"cuts\" to these formulas, we considerably reduce\nthe computation time of the SMT-solver. We experimented our approach on a\nvariety of control programs, using the OTAWA analyzer both as baseline and as\nunderlying microarchitectural analysis for our analysis, and show notable\nimprovement on the WCET bound on a variety of benchmarks and control programs.\n","Comment: ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED Conference on Languages, Compilers and Tools for\n  Embedded Systems 2014, Edimbourg : United Kingdom (2014)"]}]
