Throughout this work the spaces are assumed to\nbe complexified, so that different signatures correspond to different reality\nconditions, providing a unified treatment. A higher-dimensional generalization\nof the so-called self-dual manifolds is also investigated.\n  The most important result related to the Petrov classification is the\nGoldberg-Sachs theorem.

The algebra that we construct is an algebra of\nrestricted ultrafunction, which are generalized functions defined on a subset\n{\\Sigma} of a non-archimedean field K (with {\\Sigma}\\subseteq R\\subseteq K) and\nwith values in K.

We develop a new framework\nfor wireless algorithms in which distance-based path loss is replaced by an\narbitrary gain matrix, typically obtained by measurements of received signal\nstrength (RSS). Gain matrices allow for the modeling of complex environments,\ne.g., with obstacles and walls. We experimentally evaluate the framework in two\nindoors testbeds with 20 and 60 motes, and confirm superior predictive\nperformance in packet reception rate for a gain matrix model over a geometric\ndistance-based model.\n  At the heart of our approach is a new parameter $\\zeta$ called metricity\nwhich indicates how close the gain matrix is to a distance metric, effectively\nmeasuring the complexity of the environment. A powerful theoretical feature of\nthis parameter is that all known SINR scheduling algorithms that work in\ngeneral metric spaces carry over to arbitrary gain matrices and achieve\nequivalent performance guarantees in terms of $\\zeta$ as previously obtained in\nterms of the path loss constant.

We show how this simultaneous suppression of time and\nenergy uncertainties can be described by a separation of scales and compare\nthis with the suppression of uncertainties in the two particle correlations of\nan entangled state. To illustrate the sensitivity of the frequency comb states\nto small shifts in time and frequency, we consider the Hong-Ou-Mandel dips\nobserved in two-photon interference when both time- and frequency shifts\nbetween the input photons are varied. It is shown that the interference of two\nphotons in equivalent frequency comb states results in a two dimensional\nHong-Ou-Mandel dip that is narrow in both time and frequency, while the\ncorresponding entangled photon pairs are only sensitive to temporal shifts.\nFrequency comb states thus represent a unique and different approach towards\nquantum operations beyond the uncertainty limit.\n","Comment: 9 pages, including 2 figures"]}]

We show that a pure Nash equilibrium exists for the two classes of\ngames: (1) any spatial spectrum access games on directed acyclic graphs, and\n(2) any games satisfying the congestion property on directed trees and directed\nforests. Under mild technical conditions, the spatial spectrum access games\nwith random backoff and Aloha channel contention mechanisms on undirected\ngraphs also have a pure Nash equilibrium. We also quantify the price of anarchy\nof the spatial spectrum access game.

Through a\nsimple experiment using Dielectric Barrier Discharge actuator, we find a\ndifferent result. For a given Reynolds number, the frequency of the\nperturbation is varied for a fixed duty-cycle dc = 27%.

The largest reduction of the\nrecirculation bubble (-35%) is obtained in a very narrow frequency range around\n$0.73 f_0$ where early vortex pairing occurs between forced and unforced\nvortices. Phase averaging shows that in this case, the actuation clearly forces\nthe vortex pairing in the shear layer.

In both cases, optimality is measured with respect\nto submajorization of the eigenvalues of the frame operators. Hence, our\noptimal designs are minimizers of a family of convex potentials that include\nthe frame potential and the mean squared error.
