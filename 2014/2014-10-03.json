Joseph invented multidegrees in [Jo84] to study orbital varieties, which\nare the components of an orbital scheme, itself constructed by intersecting a\nnilpotent orbit with a Borel subalgebra. Their multidegrees, known as Joseph\npolynomials, give a basis of a (Springer) representation of the Weyl group. In\nthe case of the nilpotent orbit $\\{ M^2=0 \\}$, the orbital varieties can be\nindexed by noncrossing chord diagrams in the disc.

The multidegrees of its components, the\nBrauer loop varieties, were shown to reproduce the ground state of the Brauer\nloop model in statistical mechanics [DFZJ06].

In particular, the vector of the multidegrees satisfies two sets of\nequations, corresponding to the $e_i$ and $f_i$ generators of the Brauer\nalgebra. We describe here the geometric meaning of both $e_i$ and $f_i$\nequations in our slightly extended setting.

Particle (fermionic and bosonic) representations of a\nuniversal covering (spinor group $\\spin_+(1,3)$) of the proper orthochronous\nLorentz group are constructed via the Clifford algebra formalism. Complex and\nreal supergroups are defined on the representation system of $\\spin_+(1,3)$. It\nis shown that a cyclic (modulo 2) structure of the complex supergroup is\nequivalent to a supersymmetric action, that is, it converts fermionic\nrepresentations into bosonic representations and vice versa. The cyclic action\nof the real supergroup leads to a much more high-graded symmetry related with\nthe modulo 8 periodicity of the real Clifford algebras. This symmetry acts on\nthe system of real representations of $\\spin_+(1,3)$.\n","Comment: 22 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:1107.4156, arXiv:math-ph/0203059, arXiv:math-ph/0108022,\n  arXiv:math-ph/0405040"]}]

Such scaling is consistent with the Kibble-Zurek\nmechanism (KZM). By contrast, distribution of individual vortices with randomly\nassigned topological charges would result in the dispersion of W scaling with\nthe square root of the area inside C. Scaling of the dispersion of W and of the\nprobability of detection of non-zero W with C can be also studied for loops so\nsmall that non-zero windings are rare. In this case I show a doubling of the\nscaling of dispersion with C when compared to the scaling of dispersion in the\nlarge W regime. Moreover, probability of trapping of a non-zero W becomes, in\nthis case, proportional to the area subtended by C (hence, to the square of\ncircumference). This quadruples, as compared with large winding numbers regime,\nthe exponent in the power law dependence of the frequency of trapping of W=+1\nor W=-1 on C.

The effective model is justified because it reproduces\nlow-energy behaviors of self energy obtained by the dynamical mean-field\ntheory. The retardation effect is essential for the odd-frequency pairing,\nwhich comes from the hybridization process between conduction electrons and\npseudofermions originating from localized spins at low energies. Using the\neffective Hamiltonian, the electromagnetic response functions are\nmicroscopically calculated. The present system shows the \"weak\" Meissner\neffect, where both paramagnetic and diamagnetic parts contribute to the\nMeissner kernel to give a small total diamagnetic response in the\nsuperconducting state. This feature is in contrast to the ordinary s-wave BCS\npairing where only the diamagnetic kernel is finite in the ground state. The\nstaggered nature of the odd-frequency order parameter plays an important role\nfor the sign of the Meissner kernel.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 6 figures"]}]

A pathogen's\nreproductive fitness can be quantified by the basic reproductive number, R0.\nSince pathogen transmission between host plants depends on the spatial\nseparation between them, R0 is strongly influenced by the spatial scales of\npathogen dispersal and the spatial scales of the host population. The basic\nreproductive number was found to increase with the field size at small field\nsizes and to saturate to a constant value at large field sizes. It reaches a\nmaximum in quadratic fields and decreases as the field becomes elongated. This\npattern appears to be quite general: it holds for dispersal kernels that\ndecrease exponentially or faster as well as for \"fat-tailed\" dispersal kernels\nthat decrease slower than exponential (i.e. power-law kernels). We used this\napproach to estimate R0 in wheat stripe rust (an important pathogen caused by\nPuccinia striiformis), since disease gradients for this pathogen were\nthoroughly measured over large distances [Sackett and Mundt, Phytopathology,\n95, 983 (2005)].

After reviewing the conformal spacetime\nstructure, conformal maps are described in Minkowski spacetime as the twisted\nadjoint representation of the group Spin_+(2,4), acting on paravectors.\nTwistors are then presented via the paravector model of Clifford algebras and\nrelated to conformal maps in the Clifford algebra over the lorentzian R{4,1}$\nspacetime. We construct twistors in Minkowski spacetime as algebraic spinors\nassociated with the Dirac-Clifford algebra Cl(1,3)(C) using one lower spacetime\ndimension than standard Clifford algebra formulations, since for this purpose\nthe Clifford algebra over R{4,1} is also used to describe conformal maps,\ninstead of R{2,4}. Although some papers have already described twistors using\nthe algebra Cl(1,3)(C), isomorphic to Cl(4,1), the present formulation sheds\nsome new light on the use of the paravector model and generalizations.\n","Comment: 17 pages"]}]
