As a\nbuilding block, the present simple mechanism supports the perspective that\nentanglement can exist also in systems which are exposed to a hot environment\nand to high levels of de-coherence, which we expect e.g. for biological\nsystems.

One such amelioration mechanism relies on\nperturbing the magnetic field in the edge plasma region, either leading to more\nfrequent, smaller ELMs (ELM mitigation) or ELM suppression. This technique of\nResonant Magnetic Perturbations (RMPs) has been employed to suppress type I\nELMs at high collisionality/density on DIII-D, ASDEX Upgrade, KSTAR and JET and\nat low collisionality on DIII-D. At ITER-like collisionality the RMPs enhance\nthe transport of particles or energy and keep the edge pressure gradient below\nthe 2D linear ideal MHD critical value that would trigger an ELM, whereas at\nhigh collisionality/density the type I ELMs are replaced by small type II ELMs.\nAlthough ELM suppression only occurs within limitied operational ranges, ELM\nmitigation is much more easily achieved.

This not only amalgamated the previous fragmentary\ntheoretical understanding of phase transitions (an arsenal of mean-field\ntheories) but also it put forward the important theory of \"spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking\". Today, order parameter concept is a paradigm both in condensed\nmatter physics and in high energy physics, and Landau theory is a pinnacle of\nall mean-field theories. Mean field theories are good qualitative descriptors\nof the phase transition behavior. But all mean-field theories (including\nLandau's theory) fail at the critical point (the problem of large correlation\nlength). The problems with large correlation length in quantum many-body\nsystems are the hardest problems known in theoretical physics (both in\ncondensed matter and in particle physics). It was Ken Wilson's physical\ninsights and his powerful mathematical skills that opened a way to the solution\nof such hard problems.\n  This manuscript is a perspective on these issues. Starting with simple\nexamples of phase transitions (like ice/water; diamond/graphite etc.) we\naddress the following important questions: Why does non-analyticity (sharp\nphase transitions) arise when thermodynamical functions (i.e., free energies\netc) are good analytic functions? How does Landau's program unify all the\nprevious mean-field theories? Why do all the mean-field theories fail near the\ncritical point? How does Wilson's program go beyond all the mean-field\ntheories? What is the origin emergence and universality?\n","Comment: 30 Pages, 19 figures"]}]

The concept of conditional motion estimation is used to derive the\nclosedform expression for rate-distortion region without losing its generality.\nConditional motion estimation offers an elegant means to analyze the\nrate-distortion trade-offs and demonstrates the viability of achieving the\nbounds derived. The concept involves classifying image regions into active and\ninactive based on the amount of motion activity. By appropriately modeling the\nresiduals corresponding to active and inactive regions, a closed form\nexpression for rate-distortion function is derived in terms of motion activity\nand spatio-temporal correlation that commonly exist in video content.\nExperiments on real video clips using H.264 codec are presented to demonstrate\nthe practicality and validity of the proposed rate-distortion analysis.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 7 figures"]}]
