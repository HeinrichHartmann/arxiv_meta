Here, we first recall that according to quantum field theory ideas\ngravitation is described by a Lagrangian theory of a possible massive graviton\nfield (generated by matter fields and coupling also to itself) living in\nMinkowski spacetime. The graviton field is moreover supposed to be represented\nby a symmetric tensor field h carrying the representations of spin two and zero\nof the Lorentz group. Such a field, then (as it is well known), must\nnecessarily satisfy the gauge condition given by Eq.(3) below. Next, we\nintroduce an ansatz relating h to the 1-form fields g^a. Then, using the\nClifford bundle formalism we derive, from our Lagrangian theory, the exact wave\nequation for the graviton and investigate the role of the gauge condition given\nby Eq.(3) in obtaining a reliable conservation law for the energy-momentum\ntensor of the gravitational plus the matter fields in Minkowski spacetime.\nFinally we ask the question: does Eq.(3) fix any gauge condition for the field\ng of the effective Lorentzian spacetime structure that represents the field h\nin our theory? We show that no gauge condition is fixed a priory, as is the\ncase in General Relativity. Moreover we investigate under which conditions we\nmay fix Logunov gauge condition.\n","Comment: 15 pages.

Osteocytes derive from bone-synthesising cells (osteoblasts) that\nbecome buried in bone matrix during bone deposition. The generation of\nosteocytes is a complex process that remains incompletely understood. Whilst\nosteoblast burial determines the density of osteocytes, the expanding network\nof osteocytes regulates in turn osteoblast activity and osteoblast burial. In\nthis paper, a spatiotemporal continuous model is proposed to investigate the\nosteoblast-to-osteocyte transition. The aims of the model are (i) to link\ndynamic properties of osteocyte generation with properties of the osteocyte\nnetwork imprinted in bone, and (ii) to investigate Marotti's hypothesis that\nosteocytes prompt the burial of osteoblasts when they become covered with\nsufficient bone matrix. Osteocyte density is assumed in the model to be\ngenerated at the moving bone surface by a combination of osteoblast density,\nmatrix secretory rate, rate of entrapment, and curvature of the bone substrate,\nbut is found to be determined solely by the ratio of the instantaneous burial\nrate and matrix secretory rate. Osteocyte density does not explicitly depend on\nosteoblast density nor curvature. Osteocyte apoptosis is also included to\ndistinguish between the density of osteocyte lacuna and the density of live\nosteocytes. Experimental measurements of osteocyte lacuna densities are used to\nestimate the rate of burial of osteoblasts in bone matrix.

However, various\nkinematic analyses can give different results and it is not obvious which are\nmost reliable. Using extensive sets of mock data of various sizes (mimicking\n'ultra-faint' and 'classical' dSphs) and an MCMC engine, here we investigate\nbiases, uncertainties, and limitations of analyses based on parametric\nsolutions to the spherical Jeans equation. For a variety of functional forms\nfor the tracer and DM density profiles, as well as the orbital anisotropy\nprofile, we examine reliability of estimates for the astrophysical J- and\nD-factors for annihilation and decay, respectively. For large (N > 1000)\nstellar-kinematic samples typical of 'classical' dSphs, errors tend to be\ndominated by systematics, which can be reduced through the use of sufficiently\ngeneral and flexible functional forms. For small (N < 100) samples typical of\n'ultrafaints', statistical uncertainties tend to dominate systematic errors and\nflexible models are less necessary. We define an optimal strategy that would\nmitigate sensitivity to priors and other aspects of analyses based on the\nspherical Jeans equation.

SGC inherits the merits of both GT and SR. Compared to SR, SGC improves\nthe robustness and the discriminating power of GT. Compared to GT, SGC\nsufficiently exploits the whole data. Therefore it alleviates the undercomplete\ndictionary issue suffered by SR. Four popular image databases are employed for\nevaluation.

With the available measurements of two-body B_{u,d,s} -> pi pi, pi K, K\nK decays, a comprehensive fit on the phenomenological parameters X_A^{i,f} (or\nrho_A^{i,f} and phi_A^{i,f}) which are used to parameterize the endpoint\nsingularity in annihilation amplitudes is performed with the statistical chi^2\napproach. It is found that (1) flavor symmetry breaking effects are hardly to\nbe distinguished between X_{A,s}^i and X_{A,d}^i due to the large experimental\nerrors and theoretical uncertainties, where X_{A,s}^i and X_{A,d}^i are related\nto the nonfactorization annihilation contributions in B_s and B_{u,d} decays,\nrespectively. So X_{A,s}^i = X_{A,d}^i is a good approximation by now. (2) In\nprinciple, parameter X_{A}^f which is related to the factorization annihilation\ncontributions and independent of the initial state can be regarded as the same\nvariable for B_{u,d,s} decays. (3) Numerically, two solutions are found, one is\n(rho_A^i, phi_A^i) = (2.98^+1.12_-0.86,-105^+34_-24) and (rho_A^f, phi_A^f) =\n(1.18^+0.20_-0.23,-40^+11_-8), the other is (rho_A^i, phi_A^i) =\n(2.97^+1.19_-0.90,-105^+32_-24) and (rho_A^f, phi_A^f) =\n(2.80^+0.25_-0.21,165^+4_-3). Obviously, nonfactorization annihilation\nparameter X_A^i is generally unequal to factorization annihilation parameter\nX_A^f, which differ from the traditional treatment.

We further analyze a microscopic tight-binding model with two\ndifferent contributions to the nematic order: $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ onsite energy\nanisotropy and the $d_{xy}$ hopping anisotropy. We find that a precise\ndetermination of the former, which has been widely used to characterize the\nnematic phase, requires a simultaneous measurement of the splittings of the\n$\\Gamma$-point doublet and at the two low-energy $M$-point doublets. We also\ndiscuss the impact of twin domains and show how our results shed new light on\nARPES measurements in the normal state of these materials.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures"]}]

However, choosing an appropriate null network model is a non-trivial\ntask. Our dynamic graphlet approach overcomes the limitations of the existing\ntemporal motif-based approaches.

We give a simple\ngeometric understanding that allows us to learn a simplicial structure\nefficiently. Our method requires that the data are unit normalized (and thus\nlie on the unit sphere). We show that under this restriction, building a model\nwith simplices amounts to constructing a convex hull inside the sphere whose\nboundary facets is close to the data. We call the boundary facets of the convex\nhull that are close to the data Activated Simplices. While the total number of\nbases used to build the simplices is a parameter of the model, the dimensions\nof the individual activated simplices are learned from the data. Simplices can\nhave different dimensions, which facilitates modeling of inhomogeneous data\nsources. The simplicial structure is bounded --- this is appropriate for\nmodeling data with constraints, such as human elbows can not bend more than 180\ndegrees. The simplices are easy to interpret and extremes within the data can\nbe discovered among the vertices. The method provides good reconstruction and\nregularization.

Ellipticals turn out to be\ninconsistent with cuspy low-concentration NFW models representing the total\nmass, nor are they consistent with a steeper -1.5 inner slope, nor with the\nshallower models proposed by Navarro et al. 04, nor with NFW models 10 times\nmore concentrated than predicted, as deduced from several X-ray observations:\nthe mass models, extrapolated inwards, lead to local mass-to-light ratios that\nare smaller than the stellar value inside an effective radius (R_e), and to\ncentral aperture velocity dispersions that are much smaller than observed. This\nconclusion remains true as long as there is no sharp steepening (slope < -2) of\nthe dark matter (DM) DPs just inside 0.01 virial radii. The too low total mass\nand velocity dispersion produced within R_e by an NFW-like total mass profile\nsuggests that the stellar component should dominate the DM one out to at least\nR_e. It should then be difficult to kinematically constrain the inner slope of\nthe dark matter DP of ellipticals. The high concentration parameters deduced\nfrom X-ray observations appear to be a consequence of fitting an NFW model to\nthe total mass DP made up of a stellar component that dominates inside and a DM\ncomponent that dominates outwards. An appendix gives the virial mass dependence\nof the concentration parameter, central density, and total mass of the Navarro\net al. model.

Estimating the mass within the\n  virial radius"],"description":["  Elliptical galaxies are modelled with a a 4-component model: Sersic stars,\nLCDM dark matter (DM), hot gas and central black hole. DM is negligible in the\ninner regions, which are dominated by stars and the central black hole. This\nprevents any kinematical estimate (using a Jeans analysis) of the inner slope\nof the DM density profile. The gas fraction rises, but the baryon fraction\ndecreases with radius, at least out to 10 effective radii (R_e). Even with\nline-of-sight velocity dispersion (VD) measurements at 4 to 6 R_e with 20 km/s\naccuracy and perfectly known velocity anisotropy, the total mass within the\nvirial radius (r_v) is uncertain by a factor over 3. The DM distributions found\nin LCDM simulations are consistent with the stellar VD profiles, but appear\ninconsistent with the low VDs measured by Romanowsky et al. (2003) of planetary\nnebulae between 2 and 5 R_e, which imply such low M/Ls that the baryon fraction\nwithin r_v must be greater than the universal value. Replacing the NFW DM model\nby the new model of Navarro et al. (2004) decreases slightly the VD at a given\nradius. So, given the observed VD measured at 5 R_e, the inferred M/L within\nr_v is 40% larger than predicted with the NFW model. Folding in the slight\n(strong) radial anisotropy found in LCDM (merger) simulations, which is well\nmodelled (much better than with the Osipkov-Merritt formula) with beta(r) = 1/2\nr/(r+a), the inferred M/L within r_v is another 1.6 (2.4) times higher than for\nthe isotropic NFW model. Thus, the DM model and radial anisotropy can partly\nexplain the low PN VDs, but not in full. In an appendix, single integral\nexpressions are derived for the VDs in terms of the tracer density and total\nmass profiles, for 3 anisotropic models: radial, Osipkov-Merritt, and the model\nabove, for general radial profiles of luminosity density and mass.\n","Comment: Consolidated version with Addendum (MNRAS 370, 1582)"]}]
