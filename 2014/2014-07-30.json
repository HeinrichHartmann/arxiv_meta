We here report our theoretical studies of a noncoplanar order on a\nsimple cubic lattice and its influence on the electronic structure.

The Dirac state is doubly\ndegenerate, while it splits into a pair of Weyl nodes by lifting the degeneracy\nby an external magnetic field; the system is turned into a Weyl semimetal in\napplied field. In addition, we point out the triple-Q Hamiltonian in the strong\ncoupling limit is equivalent to the 3D \\pi-flux model relevant to an AIII\ntopological insulator. We examine the stability of such a triple-Q order in two\nfundamental models for correlated electron systems: a Kondo lattice model with\nclassical localized spins and a periodic Anderson model. For the Kondo lattice\nmodel, performing a variational calculation and Monte Carlo simulation, we show\nthat the triple-Q order is widely stabilized around 1/4 filling. For the\nperiodic Anderson model, we also show the stability of the same triple-Q state\nby using the mean-field approximation. For both models, the triple-Q order is\nwidely stabilized via the couplings between conduction electrons and localized\nelectrons even without any explicit competing magnetic interactions and\ngeometrical frustration.

Comparing these upper limits to the total\nHI column density, we find that typically at least 28% of the gas must have\ntemperatures in the thermally unstable range (200-5000 K).

Great\nprogress has been made in homogeneous population structures while heterogeneous\nstructures have received relatively less attention. Here we present a\nstructured population model where different individuals are best suited to\ndifferent regions of their environment. The underlying structure is a graph:\nindividuals occupy vertices, which are connected by edges. If an individual is\nsuited for their vertex, they receive an increase in fecundity. This framework\nallows attention to be restricted to the spatial arrangement of suitable\nhabitat. We prove some basic properties of this model and find some\ncounter-intuitive results. Notably, 1) the arrangement of suitable sites is as\nimportant as their proportion, and, 2) decreasing the proportion of suitable\nsites may result in a decrease in the fixation time of an allele.\n"]}]

These outflows carry enough mass and momentum to transform the\nstructure of their parent molecular cloud and to potentially control star\nformation itself. Despite their importance, we have not been able to fully\nquantify the impact of jets and outflows during the formation of a star\ncluster. The main problem lies in limited computing power. We would have to\nresolve the magnetic jet-launching mechanism close to the protostar and at the\nsame time follow the evolution of a parsec-size cloud for a million years.\nCurrent computer power and codes fall orders of magnitude short of achieving\nthis. In order to overcome this problem, we implement a subgrid-scale (SGS)\nmodel for launching jets and outflows, which demonstrably converges and\nreproduces the mass, linear and angular momentum transfer, and the speed of\nreal jets, with ~ 1000 times lower resolution than would be required without\nSGS model. We apply the new SGS model to turbulent, magnetized star cluster\nformation and show that jets and outflows (1) eject about 1/4 of their parent\nmolecular clump in high-speed jets, quickly reaching distances of more than a\nparsec, (2) reduce the star formation rate by about a factor of two, and (3)\nlead to the formation of ~ 1.5 times as many stars compared to the no-outflow\ncase. Most importantly, we find that jets and outflows reduce the average star\nmass by a factor of ~ 3 and may thus be essential for understanding the\ncharacteristic mass of the stellar initial mass function.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ, simulation\n  movies available:\n  http://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~chfeder/pubs/outflow_model/outflow_model.shtml?lang=en"]}]

In conditions close to molecular condensation, one would expect\nan appearance of a local minimum in the interaction potential between the two\nmolecules. We investigate this situation, introducing an attractive component\ninto the interaction potential, using a model developed for describing such\nexperiments. We consider attraction that does not depend on molecular\nstructure, as well that which depends on a DNA-like helix structure. In\nbraiding experiments, an attractive term may lead to certain effects. A local\nminimum may cause molecules to collapse from a loosely braided configuration\ninto a tight one, occurring at a critical value of the moment applied about the\naxis of the braid. For a fixed number of braid pitches, this may lead to\ncoexistence between the two braiding states, tight and loose. Coexistence\nimplies certain proportions of the braid are in each state, their relative size\ndepending on the number of braid pitches. This manifests itself as linear\ndependence in numerically calculated quantities as functions of the number of\nbraid pitches. Also, in the collapsed state, the braid radius stays roughly\nconstant. Furthermore, if the attractive interaction is helix dependent, the\nleft-right handed braid symmetry is broken. For a DNA like charge distribution,\nusing the Kornyshev-Leikin interaction model, our results suggest that\nsignificant braid collapse and coexistence only occurs for left handed braids.\nRegardless of the interaction model, the study highlights the possible\nqualitative physics of braid collapse and coexistence; and the role helix\nspecific forces might play, if important.

This thesis gives methods to obtain the\nright and left keys by inspection of the semistandard Young tableau.

The Demazure\ncharacter for $\\lambda$ and $w$ is known to be the sum of the weights of all\ntableaux whose right key is dominated by $Y_\\lambda(w)$. The set of all such\ntableaux is denoted $\\mathcal{D}_\\lambda(w)$.

The concern is not only related to an adversary taking physical or\nremote control of the device (e.g., via a malicious app), but also to what a\npassive adversary (without the above capabilities) can observe from the device\ncommunications. Work in this latter direction aimed, for example, at inferring\nthe apps a user has installed on his device, or identifying the presence of a\nspecific user within a network.\n  In this paper, we move a step forward: we investigate to which extent it is\nfeasible to identify the specific actions that a user is doing on his mobile\ndevice, by simply eavesdropping the device's network traffic. In particular, we\naim at identifying actions like browsing someone's profile on a social network,\nposting a message on a friend's wall, or sending an email. We design a system\nthat achieves this goal starting from encrypted TCP/IP packets: it works\nthrough identification of network flows and application of machine learning\ntechniques.
