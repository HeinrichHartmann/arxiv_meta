The broken-symmetry states that dominate\nin the weakly frustrated region near the rectangular lattice limit are the well\nknown antiferromagnetic state with in-phase lattice dimerization along one\ndirection, and the Wigner crystal state with the checkerboard charge order. For\nmoderate to strong frustration, however, the dominant phase is a novel\nspin-singlet paired-electron crystal (PEC), consisting of pairs of charge-rich\nsites separated by pairs of charge-poor sites.

Examples include recovering\nsparse or group-sparse vectors, low-rank matrices, and the sum of sparse and\nlow-rank matrices, among others. In various applications in signal processing\nand machine learning, the model of interest is known to be structured in\nseveral ways at the same time, for example, a matrix that is simultaneously\nsparse and low-rank.\n  Often norms that promote each individual structure are known, and allow for\nrecovery using an order-wise optimal number of measurements (e.g., $\\ell_1$\nnorm for sparsity, nuclear norm for matrix rank). Hence, it is reasonable to\nminimize a combination of such norms. We show that, surprisingly, if we use\nmulti-objective optimization with these norms, then we can do no better,\norder-wise, than an algorithm that exploits only one of the present structures.\nThis result suggests that to fully exploit the multiple structures, we need an\nentirely new convex relaxation, i.e. not one that is a function of the convex\nrelaxations used for each structure. We then specialize our results to the case\nof sparse and low-rank matrices. We show that a nonconvex formulation of the\nproblem can recover the model from very few measurements, which is on the order\nof the degrees of freedom of the matrix, whereas the convex problem obtained\nfrom a combination of the $\\ell_1$ and nuclear norms requires many more\nmeasurements. This proves an order-wise gap between the performance of the\nconvex and nonconvex recovery problems in this case. Our framework applies to\narbitrary structure-inducing norms as well as to a wide range of measurement\nensembles. This allows us to give performance bounds for problems such as\nsparse phase retrieval and low-rank tensor completion.\n","Comment: 38 pages, 9 figures"]}]

Here, we show theoretically that sub-Doppler-cooled,\ntwo-level atoms that are spatially organized by weak optical fields give rise\nto a nonlinear material response that is greatly enhanced beyond that\nattainable in a homogeneous gas. Specifically, in the regime where the\nintensity of the applied optical fields is much less than the off-resonant\nsaturation intensity, we show that the third-order nonlinear susceptibility\nscales inversely with atomic temperature and, due to this scaling, can be two\norders of magnitude larger than that of a homogeneous gas for typical\nexperimental parameters. As a result, we predict that spatially bunched\ntwo-level atoms can exhibit single-photon nonlinearities. Our model is valid\nfor all atomic temperature regimes and simultaneously accounts for the\nback-action of the atoms on the optical fields. Our results agree with previous\ntheoretical and experimental results for light-atom interactions that have\nconsidered only a limited range of temperatures. For lattice beams tuned to the\nlow-frequency side of the atomic transition, we find that the nonlinearity\ntransitions from a self-focusing type to a self-defocusing type at a critical\nintensity.

This\nis made possible in virtue of two global properties of classical\nelectrodynamics, namely, the Wheeler--Feynman identity and the Ewald\nresummation properties, the proofs of which were already given for ordered\nsystem. The second contribution consists in formulating the theory in a\ncompletely general way, so that in principle it applies also to disordered\nsystems such as glasses, or liquids or gases, provided the two general\nproperties mentioned above continue to hold.

For chordal graphs much is understood\nregarding the relationships between positive zero forcing and clique coverings.\nBuilding upon constructions associated with optimal tree covers and forest\ncovers, we present a linear time algorithm for computing the positive zero\nforcing number of chordal graphs. We also prove that it is NP-complete to\ndetermine if a graph has a positive zero forcing set with an additional\nproperty.\n","Comment: 21 pages"]}]

The main proofs of the uniformization use\nhyperbolic volumes (Andreev) or hyperbolic circle packings (by Beardon and\nStephenson). We reformulate these problems into a Euclidean context, which\nallows more general discrete conformal structures and boundary conditions. The\nmain idea is to replace the disk with a double covered disk with one side\nforced to be a circle and the other forced to have interior curvature zero. The\nentire problem is reduced to finding a zero curvature structure.
