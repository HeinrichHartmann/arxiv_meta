We begin by completing the \\emph{perfect}\ndistinguishability problem of two-qubit ensembles - both for separable\noperations and LOCC - by providing necessary and sufficient conditions for the\nperfect discrimination of one pure and one mixed state. Then for the well-known\ntask of minimum error discrimination, it is shown that \\textit{almost all}\ntwo-qubit ensembles consisting of three pure states cannot be optimally\ndiscriminated using LOCC. This is surprising considering that \\textit{any} two\npure states can be distinguished optimally by LOCC. Special attention is given\nto ensembles that lack entanglement, and we prove an easy sufficient condition\nfor when a set of three product states cannot be optimally distinguished by\nLOCC, thus providing new examples of the phenomenon known as \"non-locality\nwithout entanglement\". We next consider an example of $N$ parties who each\nshare the same state but who are ignorant of its identity. The state is drawn\nfrom the rotationally invariant \"trine ensemble\", and we establish a tight\nconnection between the $N$-copy ensemble and Shor's \"lifted\" single-copy\nensemble.

This is the first result of its kind.\nFinally, we turn to the task of unambiguous discrimination and derive new lower\nbounds on the LOCC inconclusive probability for symmetric states.

Our study is motivated by the\nanalysis of the VIMOS Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS), a flux-limited\nsurvey (i<22.5) based on one-pass observations with VIMOS, with gaps covering\n25% of the surveyed area and a mean sampling rate of 35%.

For simplicity, we mainly discuss the case of gravity\nnonminimally coupled to spin-3 fields, being nonperturbatively described by a\nChern-Simons theory of two independent sl(3,R) gauge fields. Since the analysis\nis particularly transparent in the Hamiltonian formalism, we provide a concise\ndiscussion of their basic aspects in this context; and as a warming up\nexercise, we briefly analyze the asymptotic behaviour of pure gravity, as well\nas the BTZ black hole and its thermodynamics, exclusively in terms of gauge\nfields. The discussion is then extended to the case of black holes endowed with\nhigher spin fields, briefly signaling the agreements and discrepancies found\nthrough different approaches. We conclude explaining how the puzzles become\nresolved once the fall off of the fields is precisely specified and extended to\ninclude chemical potentials, in a way that it is compatible with the asymptotic\nsymmetries. Hence, the global charges become completely identified in an\nunambiguous way, so that different sets of asymptotic conditions turn out to\ncontain inequivalent classes of black hole solutions being characterized by a\ndifferent set of global charges.\n","Comment: 27 pages, no figures.

In particular, for a flux ordering $F_{\\nu_e} > F_{\\bar\\nu_e} >\nF_{\\nu_x}$, as expected during the SN accretion phase, this instability occurs\nin the normal neutrino mass hierarchy. However, during this phase the ordinary\nmatter density can be larger than the neutrino one, suppressing the\nself-induced conversions. At this regard, we investigate the matter suppression\nof the MAA effects, performing a linearized stability analysis of the neutrino\nequations of motion, in the presence of realistic SN density profiles. We\ncompare these results with the numerical solution of the SN neutrino non-linear\nevolution equations.

Stellar wind\nmass loss is one of the dominant processes determining the evolution of massive\nstars, and it may provide clues on the evolutionary properties of blue\nsupergiants. As the H$\\alpha$ line is the most oft-used mass-loss tracer in the\nOB-star regime, we provide a detailed analysis of the H$\\alpha$ line for OB\nsupergiant models over an $T_{\\rm eff}$ range between 30000 and 12500K.

The H$\\alpha$ line-profile behaviour is characterised by two\nbranches of $T_{\\rm eff}$: (i) a \"hot\" branch between 30000 and 22500 K, where\nH$\\alpha$ emission becomes stronger with decreasing $T_{\\rm eff}$, and (ii) a\n\"cool\" branch between 22500 and 12500 K, where the line becomes weaker.

In inverse calculations one aims to characterize the set\nof models that fit the data (among other constraints). If the data misfit\nfunction is unimodal then one can find its peak by local optimization methods\nand characterize its width (related to the range of data-fitting models) by\nestimating derivatives at this peak. On the other hand, if there are local\nextrema, then a number of interesting and difficult problems arise. Are the\nlocal extrema important compared to the global or can they be eliminated (e.g.,\nby smoothing) without significant loss of information? Is there a sufficiently\nsmall number of local extrema that they can be enumerated via local\noptimization? What are the basins of attraction of these local extrema? Can two\nextrema be joined by a path that never goes uphill? Can the whole problem be\nreduced to one of enumerating the local extrema and their basins of attraction?\nFor locally ill-conditioned functions, premature convergence of local\noptimization can be confused with the presence of local extrema. Addressing any\nof these issues requires topographic information about the functions under\nstudy. But in many applications these functions may have hundreds or thousands\nof variables and can only be evaluated pointwise (by some numerical method for\ninstance). In this paper we describe systematic (but generic) methods of\nanalysing the topography of high dimensional functions using local optimization\nmethods applied to randomly chosen starting models. We provide a number of\nquantitative measures of function topography that have proven to be useful in\npractical problems along with error estimates.\n","Comment: 14 figures and an appendix containing proof of main result"]}]

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems are widely used\nfor coping with this challenge. However, they currently present several\nlimitations that have to be overcome. In this paper we propose an enhanced SIEM\nsystem in which we have introduced novel components to i) enable multiple layer\ndata analysis; ii) resolve conflicts among security policies, and discover\nunauthorized data paths in such a way to be able to reconfigure network\ndevices. Furthermore, the system is enriched by a Resilient Event Storage that\nensures integrity and unforgeability of events stored.\n","Comment: EDCC-2014, BIG4CIP-2014, Security Information and Event Management,\n  Decision Support System, Hydroelectric Dam"]}]

When\ncontrollably launching the next family of higher-order modes on a fiber with\n195 mm stretch, we achieve a transmission of 97.8 $\\pm$ 2.8%, which has a loss\nfrom tapering of 5.0 $\\,\\times \\,$ 10$^{-4}$ dB/mm when normalized to the\nentire stretch. Our pulling and transfer procedures allow us to fabricate\noptical nanofibers that transmit more than 400 mW in high vacuum conditions.\nThese results, published as parameters in our previous work, present an\nimprovement of two orders of magnitude less loss for the fundamental mode and\nan increase in transmission of more than 300% for higher-order modes, when\nfollowing the protocols detailed in this paper. We extract from the\ntransmission during the pull, the only reported spectrogram of a fundamental\nmode launch that does not include excitation to asymmetric modes; in stark\ncontrast to a pull in which our cleaning protocol is not followed. These\nresults depend critically on the pre-pull cleanliness and when properly\nfollowing our pulling protocols are in excellent agreement with simulations.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 10 figures, accepted to AIP Advances"]}]

The latter result relies on\nanalyzing the probability that a randomly chosen perfect matching contains a\nparticular edge.\n  However, for any sequence of d-regular bipartite graphs converging to the\nd-regular tree, we prove that the normalized logarithm of the number of perfect\nmatchings converges. This applies to random d-regular bipartite graphs. We show\nthat the limit equals to the exponent in Schrijver's lower bound on the number\nof perfect matchings.\n  Our analytic approach also yields a short proof for the Nguyen-Onak (also\nElek--Lippner) theorem saying that the matching ratio is estimable.
