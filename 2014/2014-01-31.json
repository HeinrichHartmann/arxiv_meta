We apply this technique on several well-studied\nproblems: Feedback Arc Set in (Bipartite) Tournaments, Dense Rooted Triplet\nInconsistency and Betweenness in Tournaments. For the former, one is given a\n(bipartite) tournament $T = (V,A)$ and seeks a set of at most $k$ arcs whose\nreversal in $T$ results in an acyclic (bipartite) tournament. While a linear\nvertex-kernel is already known for the first problem, using the Conflict\nPacking allows us to find a so-called safe partition, the central tool of the\nkernelization algorithm in, with simpler arguments. For the case of bipartite\ntournaments, the same technique allows us to obtain a quadratic vertex-kernel.\nAgain, such a kernel was already known to exist, using the concept of so-called\nbimodules.

We examine how the\ncoefficient of variation varies with the number of members and find that, even\nwith a few hundred members in the scheme, idiosyncratic mortality risk may\nstill be significant.

This usually indicates\nmultiple fractal structures of the sample characterized by different size\nscales. The existing models explaining the crossover positions (that is, the\npoints where the power-law scattering exponent changes) involve only one\ncontrast parameter, which depends solely on the ratio of the fractal sizes.\nHere, a model that describes SAS from a multi-phase system with a few contrast\nparameters is described, and it is shown that the crossover position depends on\nthe scattering length density of each phase. The Stuhrmann contrast variation\nmethod is generalized and applied to experimental curves in the vicinity of the\ncrossover point beyond the Guinier region. The contrast variation is applied\nnot to the intensity itself but to the model parameters, which can be found by\nfitting the experimental data with the suggested interpolation formula. The\nmodel supplements the existing two-phase models and gives the simple condition\nof their inapplicability: if the crossover point depends on the contrast then a\ntwo-phase model is not relevant. The developed analysis allows one to answer\nthe qualitative question of whether one fractal `absorbs' another one or they\nare both immersed in a surrounding homogeneous medium like a solvent or solid\nmatrix. The models can be applied to experimental SAS data where the absolute\nvalue of the scattering exponent of the first power-law regime is higher than\nthat of the subsequent second power-law regime, that is, the scattering curve\nis `convex' near the crossover point.

One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels.

Examining the statistically averaged value of $M_{c,crit}$\n(defined as $<M_{c,crit}>$), we find that the correlation originates from the\nbehavior of $<M_{c,crit}>$ that increases steadily with metallicity for two\nkinds of the Jovian planets while the low-mass planets obtain a rather constant\nvalue for $<M_{c,crit}>$. Such a difference in $<M_{c,crit}>$ can define\ntransition metallicities (TMs) above which the Jovian planets gain a larger\nvalue of $<M_{c,crit}>$ than the low-mass planets, and hence gas giant\nformation takes place more efficiently.

This model captures some settings\nprecisely, e.g. exposure to an idea or pathogen, but it fails to capture very\nrelevant concerns in others, for example, a manufacturer promoting a new\nproduct by distributing five \"20% off\" coupons instead of giving away one free\nproduct.\n  While fractional versions of problems tend to be easier to solve than\nintegral versions, for influence maximization, we show that the two versions\nhave essentially the same computational complexity. On the other hand, the two\nversions can have vastly different solutions: the added flexibility of\nfractional allocation can lead to significantly improved influence. Our main\ntheoretical contribution is to show how to adapt the major positive results\nfrom the integral case to the fractional case. Specifically, Mossel and Roch\n(2006) used the submodularity of influence to obtain their integral results; we\nintroduce a new notion of continuous submodularity, and use this to obtain\nmatching fractional results.

For $s\\in(d,2d)$ we show\nthat the graph diameter for the graph reduced to a box of side $L$ scales like\n$(\\log L)^{\\Delta+o(1)}$ where $\\Delta^{-1}:=\\log_2(2d/s)$. In particular, the\ndiameter grows about as fast as the typical graph distance between two vertices\nat distance $L$. We also show that a ball of radius $r$ in the intrinsic metric\non the (infinite) graph will roughly coincide with a ball of radius\n$\\exp\\{r^{1/\\Delta+o(1)}\\}$ in the Euclidean metric.\n","Comment: 17 pages, extends the results of arXiv:math.PR/0304418 to graph\n  diameter, substantially revised and corrected, added a result on volume\n  growth asymptotic"]}]
