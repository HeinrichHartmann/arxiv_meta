However, this is not necessarily a\ncharacteristic of physiological neural networks - external input does not only\noccur when the network is at rest/a steady state. In this paper we study a\nsimple neuronal network model driven by a continuous external input (i.e.\\ the\nmodel does not have a separation of timescales) and analytically tuned to\noperate in the region of a critical state (it reaches the critical regime\nexactly in the absence of input - the case studied in the companion paper to\nthis article). The system displays avalanche dynamics in the form of cascades\nof neuronal firing separated by periods of silence. We observe partial\nscale-free behaviour in the distribution of avalanche size for low levels of\nexternal input. We analytically derive the distributions of waiting times and\ninvestigate their temporal behaviour in relation to different levels of\nexternal input, showing that the system's dynamics can exhibit partial\nlong-range temporal correlations. We further show that as the system approaches\nthe critical state by two alternative `routes', different markers of\ncriticality (partial scale-free behaviour and long-range temporal correlations)\nare displayed. This suggests that signatures of criticality exhibited by a\nparticular system in close proximity to a critical state are dependent on the\nregion in parameter space at which the system (currently) resides.\n","Comment: 48 pages, 18 figures"]}]

The case for how these\nmaximise dynamic range of information processing and communication is still\nbeing made and because a significant substrate for information coding and\ntransmission is neural synchrony it is of interest to link synchronisation\nmeasures with those of criticality.

The\nexistence of LRTCs in fluctuations of phase synchronisation suggests that these\nfluctuations are governed by non-local behaviour. This has important\nimplications regarding the conditions under which one should expect to see\nLRTCs in phase synchronisation.

The method\nemploys a family of 2-dimensional analytic vector fields, whose integral curves\nexhibit various patterns depending on the value of a parameter lambda. More\nspecifically, for an a priori known value of lambda, the vector field has a\nunique singular point of dipole type and can be used to steer the unicycle to a\ngoal configuration. Furthermore, for the unique value of lambda that the vector\nfield has a continuum of singular points, the integral curves are used to\ndefine flows around obstacles. An almost global feedback motion plan can then\nbe constructed by suitably blending attractive and repulsive vector fields in a\nstatic obstacle environment.

Already in this crude approximation, the extraction of\nsize of a proton from bound-state observables is found to depend on the lepton\nmass, so that the smaller the lepton mass the larger the proton size extracted\nfrom the same observable bound-state energy splitting. In comparison of\nHydrogen and muon-proton bound-state dynamics, the crude calculation suggests\nthat the difference between extracted proton sizes in these two cases can be a\nfew percent.

In these systems, the\npolar discontinuity across the interface may drive an electronic reconstruction\ninducing free carriers at the interface. Here, we theoretically show that a\nmetallic interface between a Mott- and a band-insulator can also form in the\nabsence of a polar discontinuity. The condition for the appearance of such a\nmetallic state is consistent with the classical Mott criterion: the metallic\nstate is stable if the screening length falls below the effective Bohr radius\nof a particle-hole pair. In this case, the metallic state bears a remarkable\nsimilarity to the one found in polar/nonpolar heterostructures. On the other\nhand, if the screening length approaches the size of the effective Bohr radius,\nparticles and holes are bound to each other resulting in an overall insulating\nphase. We analyze this metal-insulator transition, which is tunable by the\ndielectric constant, in the framework of the slave-boson mean-field theory for\na lattice model with both onsite and long-range Coulomb interactions. We\ndiscuss ground-state properties and transport coefficients, which we derive in\nthe relaxation-time approximation.

In discs with an efficient radiative transport, the\nmigration can be directed outwards for planets with more than 3-5 Earth masses.\nThis is due to the entropy driven corotation torque, a process that extends the\nlifetimes of growing planetary embryos. We investigate the influence on the\ndisc structure caused by a jump in the alpha parameter of the viscosity to\nmodel a dead-zone structure in the disc. We focus on M-dot discs, which have a\nconstant net mass flux. Using the resulting disc structure, we investigate the\nconsequences for the formation of planetesimals and determine the regions of\noutward migration for proto-planets.

We used the explicit/implicit hydrodynamical code\nFARGOCA that includes a full tensor viscosity and stellar irradiation as well\nas a two-temperature solver that includes radiation transport in the\nflux-limited diffusion approximation. Viscosity transitions inside the disc\ncreate transitions in density that stop inward migration for small planets\nthrough the so-called \"planet trap\" mechanism. This mechanism also works for\nplanets down to M_P > 0.5M_E. Additionally, the viscosity transitions change\nthe pressure gradient in the disc, which facilitates planetesimal formation via\nthe streaming instability. However, a very steep transition in viscosity is\nneeded to achieve in a pressure bump in the disc. The transition in viscosity\nfacilitates planetesimal formation and can stop the migration of small-mass\nplanets (M_P>0.5M_E), but still does not halt inward migration of smaller\nplanets and planetesimals that are affected by gas drag. A very steep, probably\nunrealistic viscosity gradient is needed to trap planets of smaller masses and\nhalt gas-drag-driven planetesimal migration at a pressure bump.\n","Comment: 12 pages, accepted by A&A"]}]

As a result\nof the large abundances of molecular hydrogen and atomic oxygen in these\nregions, the reaction H2 + O has been proposed to contribute significantly to\nthe formation of water as well.

Here, we use precisely executed temperature programmed desorption\n(TPD) experiments in an ultra-high vacuum setup combined with kinetic Monte\nCarlo simulations to establish an upper limit of the water production starting\nfrom H2 and O. These reactants are brought together in a matrix of CO2 in a\nseries of (control) experiments at different temperatures and with different\nisotopological compositions. The amount of water detected with the quadrupole\nmass spectrometer upon TPD is found to originate mainly from contamination in\nthe chamber itself.

An absolutely conservative upper limit for the\nreaction rate is derived with a microscopic kinetic Monte Carlo model that\nconverts the upper limit into a maximal possible reaction rate. Incorporating\nthis rate into simulations run for astrochemically relevant parameters, shows\nthat the upper limit to the contribution of the reaction H2 + O in OH, and\nhence water formation, is 11% in dense interstellar clouds.

The lower mass limits for the\ncompanions of CPD-64$^{\\circ}$481 ($0.048\\,M_{\\rm \\odot}$) and PHL\\,457\n($0.027\\,M_{\\rm \\odot}$) are significantly below the stellar mass limit. Hence\nthey could be brown dwarfs unless the inclination is unfavourable. Two very\nsimilar systems have already been reported. The probability that none of them\nis a brown dwarf is very small, 0.02%. Hence we provide further evidence that\nsubstellar companions with masses that low are able to eject a common envelope\nand form an sdB star. Furthermore, we find that the properties of the observed\nsample of hot subdwarfs in reflection effect binaries is consistent with a\nscenario where single sdBs can still be formed via common envelope events, but\ntheir low-mass substellar companions do not survive.\n","Comment: accepted to A&A"]}]

Considering a codebook\nbased beamforming system (e.g., to facilitate limited feedback), we observe\nthat the complexity of \\emph{jointly} optimizing the beamforming directions\nacross the multiple arrays is highly prohibitive, even for very reasonable\nsystem parameters. To overcome this bottleneck, we develop reduced complexity\nalgorithms for optimizing the choice of beamforming directions, premised on the\nsparse multipath structure of the mmwave channel. Specifically, we reduce the\ncardinality of the joint beamforming search space, by restricting attention to\na small set of dominant candidate directions. To obtain the set of dominant\ndirections, we develop two complementary approaches: (a) based on computation\nof a novel spatial power metric; a detailed analysis of this metric shows that,\nin the limit of large antenna arrays, the selected candidate directions\napproach the channel's dominant angles of arrival and departure, and (b)\nprecise estimation of the channel's (long-term) dominant angles of arrival,\nexploiting the correlations of the signals received across the different\nreceiver subarrays.

Based on the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty with perturbation\ntechnique and dual decomposition technique, we propose a fully distributed\ndynamic cross-layer algorithm, including multicast routing, source rate\ncontrol, network coding, session scheduling and energy management, only\nrequiring knowledge of the instantaneous system state. The explicit trade-off\nbetween the optimization objective and queue backlog is theoretically proven.\nFinally, the simulation results verify the theoretic claims.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1410.1973"]}]

Gaussian input, we assume the Gramian of the channel matrix to be\nunitarily invariant and derive the output statistics in both the noise-limited\nand the interference-limited scenario, considering different fading\ndistributions. When the product-form input is adopted, we provide the\nexpressions of the output pdf as the relationship between the overall number of\nantennas and the fading coherence length varies. We also highlight the relation\nbetween our newly derived expressions and the results already available in the\nliterature, and, for some cases, we numerically compute the mutual information,\nbased on the proposed expression of the output statistics.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 5 figures"]}]

The design\nengineering of PV systems requires modeling and evaluating shading losses. Some\nPV systems are affected by complex shading scenes whose resulting PV energy\nlosses are very difficult to evaluate with current modeling tools. Several\nspecialized PV design and simulation software include the possibility to\nevaluate shading losses. They generally possess a Graphical User Interface\n(GUI) through which the user can draw a 3D shading scene, and then evaluate its\ncorresponding PV energy losses. The complexity of the objects that these tools\ncan handle is relatively limited. We have created a software solution, 3DPV,\nwhich allows evaluating the energy losses induced by complex 3D scenes on PV\ngenerators. The 3D objects can be imported from specialized 3D modeling\nsoftware or from a 3D object library. The shadows cast by this 3D scene on the\nPV generator are then directly evaluated from the Graphics Processing Unit\n(GPU). Thanks to the recent development of GPUs for the video game industry,\nthe shadows can be evaluated with a very high spatial resolution that reaches\nwell beyond the PV cell level, in very short calculation times. A PV simulation\nmodel then translates the geometrical shading into PV energy output losses.\n3DPV has been implemented using WebGL, which allows it to run directly from a\nWeb browser, without requiring any local installation from the user. This also\nallows taken full benefits from the information already available from\nInternet, such as the 3D object libraries. This contribution describes, step by\nstep, the method that allows 3DPV to evaluate the PV energy losses caused by\ncomplex shading. We then illustrate the results of this methodology to several\napplication cases that are encountered in the world of PV systems design.\n","Comment: 5 page, 9 figures, conference proceedings, 29th European Photovoltaic\n  Solar Energy Conference and Exhibition, Amsterdam, 2014"]}]
