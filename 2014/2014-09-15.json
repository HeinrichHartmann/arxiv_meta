This problem\nfinds applications spanning from the mathematician's pencil, the processing of\ngranular materials, the jamming and glass transitions, all the way to fruit\npacking in every grocery. There are presently numerous experiments showing that\nthe loosest way to pack spheres gives a density of ~55% (RLP) while filling all\nthe loose voids results in a maximum density of ~63-64% (RCP). While those\nvalues seem robustly true, to this date there is no physical explanation or\ntheoretical prediction for them.

We combine an extended statistical mechanics approach 'a la\nEdwards' (where the role traditionally played by the energy and temperature in\nthermal systems is substituted by the volume and compactivity) with a\nconstraint on mechanical stability imposed by the isostatic condition.\nUltimately, our results lead to a phase diagram that provides a unifying view\nof the disordered hard sphere packing problem.\n","Comment: 55 pages, 19 figures, C.

Among the probabilistic strategies we consider\nunambiguous gate discrimination, where errors are not tolerated but\ninconclusive outcomes are allowed, and we prove that parallel strategies are\nsufficient to unambiguously identify the unknown gate with minimum number of\nqueries. This result is used to provide upper and lower bounds on the query\ncomplexity and on the minimum ancilla dimension. In addition, we introduce the\nnotion of generalized t-designs, which includes unitary t-designs and group\nrepresentations as special cases. For gates forming a generalized t-design we\ngive an explicit expression for the maximum probability of correct gate\nidentification and we prove that there is no gap between the performances of\ndeterministic strategies an those of probabilistic strategies. Hence,\nevaluating of the query complexity of perfect deterministic discrimination is\nreduced to the easier problem of evaluating the query complexity of unambiguous\ndiscrimination. Finally, we consider discrimination strategies where the use of\nancillas is forbidden, providing upper bounds on the number of additional\nqueries needed to make up for the lack of entanglement with the ancillas.\n","Comment: 24 + 8 pages, published version"]}]

Shared IBD\nsegments have numerous applications in genetics, from demographic inference to\nphasing, imputation, pedigree reconstruction, and disease mapping. Here, we\nprovide a theoretical analysis of IBD sharing under Markovian approximations of\nthe coalescent with recombination. We describe a general framework for the IBD\nprocess along the chromosome under the Markovian models (SMC/SMC'), as well as\nintroduce and justify a new model, which we term the renewal approximation,\nunder which lengths of successive segments are independent. Then, considering\nthe infinite-chromosome limit of the IBD process, we recover previous results\n(for SMC) and derive new results (for SMC') for the mean number of shared\nsegments longer than a cutoff and the fraction of the chromosome found in such\nsegments. We then use renewal theory to derive an expression (in Laplace space)\nfor the distribution of the number of shared segments and demonstrate\nimplications for demographic inference. We also compute (again, in Laplace\nspace) the distribution of the fraction of the chromosome in shared segments,\nfrom which we obtain explicit expressions for the first two moments. Finally,\nwe generalize all results to populations with a variable effective size.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 9 figures"]}]

With this powerful means of\ninvestigation, he first studies the phenomena of the arc then used for the\ncoastal and urban lighting and then, the singing arc used as a transmitter of\nradio waves in wireless telegraphy. In 1905, he highlights a new type of\nnon-sinusoidal oscillations in the singing arc. Twenty years later, Balthasar\nvan der Pol will recognize that such oscillations were in fact \"relaxation\noscillations\". To explain this phenomenon, he uses a representation in the\nphase plane and shows that its evolution takes the form of small cycles. During\nWorld War I the triode gradually replaces the singing arc in transmission\nsystems. At the end of the war, using analogy, Blondel transposes to the triode\nmost of the results he had obtained for the singing arc. In April 1919, he\npublishes a long memoir in which he introduces the terminology \"self-sustained\noscillations\" and proposes to illustrate this concept starting from the example\nof the Tantalus cup which is then picked up by Van der Pol and Philippe Le\nCorbeiller.

Deploying multiple of these applications on a mobile device to\ncontinuously monitor the audio environment allows for the acquisition of a\ndiverse range of sound-related contextual inferences. However, the cumulative\nprocessing burden critically impacts the phone battery.\n  To address this problem, we propose DSP.Ear - an integrated sensing system\nthat takes advantage of the latest low-power DSP co-processor technology in\ncommodity mobile devices to enable the continuous and simultaneous operation of\nmultiple established algorithms that perform complex audio inferences. The\nsystem extracts emotions from voice, estimates the number of people in a room,\nidentifies the speakers, and detects commonly found ambient sounds, while\ncritically incurring little overhead to the device battery. This is achieved\nthrough a series of pipeline optimizations that allow the computation to remain\nlargely on the DSP. Through detailed evaluation of our prototype implementation\nwe show that, by exploiting a smartphone's co-processor, DSP.Ear achieves a 3\nto 7 times increase in the battery lifetime compared to a solution that uses\nonly the phone's main processor. In addition, DSP.Ear is 2 to 3 times more\npower efficient than a naive DSP solution without optimizations. We further\nanalyze a large-scale dataset from 1320 Android users to show that in about\n80-90% of the daily usage instances DSP.Ear is able to sustain a full day of\noperation (even in the presence of other smartphone workloads) with a single\nbattery charge.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 12th ACM Conference on Embedded Network Sensor Systems\n  (SenSys '14)"]}]
