The\nexperimental results show that magnetization relaxation is faster than 20 ns in\nthe paramagnetic state. Decreasing temperature below the Curie temperature Tc\nresults in an increase of the relaxation time but to less than 10 micro\nseconds. This fast relaxation may explain why the spontaneous spin splitting of\nelectronic states is not accompanied by the presence of non-zero macroscopic\nmagnetization below Tc. Our Monte Carlo results reproduce the relative change\nof the relaxation time on decreasing temperature. At the same time, the\nnumerical calculations demonstrate that antiferromagnetic spin-spin\ninteractions, which compete with the hole-mediated long-range ferromagnetic\ncoupling, play an important role in magnetization relaxation of the system. We\nfind, in particular, that magnetization dynamics is largely accelerated by the\npresence of antiferromagnetic couplings to the Mn spins located outside the\nregion, where the holes reside. This suggests that macroscopic spontaneous\nmagnetization should be observable if the thickness of the layer containing\nlocalized spins will be smaller than the extension of the hole wave function.\nFurthermore, we study how a spin-independent part of the Mn potential affects\nTc.

Generalization of this measure to three genomes is known as the\nmedian score (while a resulting genome is called median genome). In contrast to\nthe rearrangement distance between two genomes which can be computed in linear\ntime, computing the median score for three genomes is NP-hard. This inspires a\nquest for simpler and faster approximations for the median score, the most\nnatural of which appears to be the halved sum of pairwise distances which in\nfact represents a lower bound for the median score.\n  In this work, we study relationship and interplay of pairwise distances\nbetween three genomes and their median score under the model of\nDouble-Cut-and-Join (DCJ) rearrangements. Most remarkably we show that while a\nrearrangement may change the sum of pairwise distances by at most 2 (and thus\nchange the lower bound by at most 1), even the most \"powerful\" rearrangements\nin this respect that increase the lower bound by 1 (by moving one genome\nfarther away from each of the other two genomes), which we call strong, do not\nnecessarily affect the median score. This observation implies that the two\nmeasures are not as well-correlated as one's intuition may suggest.\n  We further prove that the median score attains the lower bound exactly on the\ntriples of genomes that can be obtained from a single genome with strong\nrearrangements. While the sum of pairwise distances with the factor 2/3\nrepresents an upper bound for the median score, its tightness remains unclear.\nNonetheless, we show that the difference of the median score and its lower\nbound is not bounded by a constant.\n","Comment: Proceedings of the 10-th Annual RECOMB Satellite Workshop on\n  Comparative Genomics (RECOMB-CG), 2012.

Conversely, electrons in conventional condensed matter\nsystems exist inside an imperfect host material, subjecting them to\nuncontrollable, random disorder, which often destroys delicate correlated\nphases and precludes local tunability. The realization of a condensed matter\nsystem that is disorder-free and locally-tunable thus remains an outstanding\nchallenge. Here, we demonstrate a new technique for deterministic creation of\nlocally-tunable, ultra-low-disorder electron systems in carbon nanotubes\nsuspended over circuits of unprecedented complexity. Using transport\nexperiments we show that electrons can be localized at any position along the\nnanotube and that the confinement potential can be smoothly moved from location\nto location. Nearly perfect mirror symmetry of transport characteristics about\nthe centre of the nanotube establishes the negligible effects of electronic\ndisorder, thus allowing experiments in precision engineered one-dimensional\npotentials. We further demonstrate the ability to position multiple nanotubes\nat chosen separations, generalizing these devices to coupled one-dimensional\nsystems.

Spin Squeezing and\n  Other Entanglement Tests in Two Mode Systems"],"description":["  The concept of entangled quantum states is considered in the context of\nsystems of identical particles, based on the requirement that in order to\nrepresent physical states both for the overall system and the sub-systems which\nmay be entangled, the density operators must satisfy the symmetrisation\nprinciple and global and local super-selection rules that prohibit states in\nwhich there are coherences between differing particle numbers. These\nrequirements and their justification are fully discussed. In the second\nquantisation approach used, both the system and the sub-systems are modes (or\nsets of modes) rather than particles, particles being associated with different\noccupancies of the modes. The definition of entangled states is based on first\ndefining the non-entangled states - after specifying which modes constitute the\nsub-systems. This paper mainly focuses on two mode entanglement for massive\nbosons. Several inequalities involving variances and mean values of operators\ninvolving mode annihilation, creation operators have been proposed as tests for\ntwo mode entangled states, including the inequalities that define spin\nsqueezing. Spin squeezing criteria in two mode systems are examined, and spin\nsqueezing is best considered for principle spin operator components where the\ncovariance matrix is diagonal. It is shown that the presence of spin squeezing\nin at least one of the spin components requires entanglement of the relevant\npair of modes. Several of the other proposed tests for entanglement, including\nones based on the sum of the variances for two spin components are considered.\nAll of the tests are still valid when the present concept of entanglement based\non the symmetrisation and super-selection rule criteria is applied, but further\ntests have been obtained here. Sometimes the new tests are satisfied whilst\nthan those obtained in other papers are not.\n","Comment: Version 5. Other Authors Added. Table of Contents included.

Several conditions have been\nfound to guarantee separability, that is lack of interaction, between TGDs and\nEGDs.

In this paper, we prove that over fixed-size finite fields, any\n$\\Sigma\\Pi\\Sigma$ circuit for computing the iterated matrix multiplication\npolynomial of $n$ generic matrices of size $n\\times n$, must be of size\n$2^{\\Omega(n\\log n)}$. The importance of this result is that over fixed-size\nfields there is no depth reduction technique that can be used to compute all\nthe $n^{O(1)}$-variate and $n$-degree polynomials in VP by depth 3 circuits of\nsize $2^{o(n\\log n)}$. The result [GK1998] can only rule out such a possibility\nfor depth 3 circuits of size $2^{o(n)}$.\n  We also give an example of an explicit polynomial ($NW_{n,\\epsilon}(X)$) in\nVNP (not known to be in VP), for which any $\\Sigma\\Pi\\Sigma$ circuit computing\nit (over fixed-size fields) must be of size $2^{\\Omega(n\\log n)}$. The\npolynomial we consider is constructed from the combinatorial design. An\ninteresting feature of this result is that we get the first examples of two\npolynomials (one in VP and one in VNP) such that they have provably stronger\ncircuit size lower bounds than Permanent in a reasonably strong model of\ncomputation.\n  Next, we prove that any depth 4\n$\\Sigma\\Pi^{[O(\\sqrt{n})]}\\Sigma\\Pi^{[\\sqrt{n}]}$ circuit computing\n$NW_{n,\\epsilon}(X)$ (over any field) must be of size $2^{\\Omega(\\sqrt{n}\\log\nn)}$. To the best of our knowledge, the polynomial $NW_{n,\\epsilon}(X)$ is the\nfirst example of an explicit polynomial in VNP such that it requires\n$2^{\\Omega(\\sqrt{n}\\log n)}$ size depth four circuits, but no known matching\nupper bound.\n"]}]

First of all it has\nto be decided which approaches have potential for the organization. In many\ncases one approach does not contain enough information for process\nimplementation. Consequently, the organization may need to use several\napproaches and the decision has to be made how the chosen approaches can be\nused simultaneously. This area is called Multi-model Software Process\nImprovement (MSPI). The simultaneous usage of multiple quality approaches is\ncalled the multi-model problem. In this dissertation we propose a solution for\nthe multi-model problem which we call the Process Based Unification (PBU)\nframework. The PBU framework consists of the PBU concept, a PBU process and the\nPBU result. We call PBU concept the mapping of quality approaches to a unified\nprocess. The PBU concept is operationalized by a PBU process. The PBU result\nincludes the resulting unified process and the mapping of quality approaches to\nthe unified process.\n","Comment: PhD Thesis"]}]
