Our primary interest is the degree of\nsuppression of the cross section for first generation squarks compared with a\ngluino with a pure Majorana mass. We find that not all Majorana masses are\nalike -- a Majorana mass for the gluino can suppress the squark production\ncross section, whereas a Majorana mass for the adjoint fermion partner leads to\nan increased cross section, compared with a pure Dirac gluino. In the presence\nof electroweak gauginos, squark production can increase by at most a factor of\na few above the pure Dirac gluino case when the electroweak gauginos have\npurely Majorana masses near to the squark masses. This unusual set of gaugino\nmasses is interesting since the usual Higgs quartic coupling would not be\nsuppressed. When the electroweak gaugino masses are much lighter than the\nsquarks, there is a negligible change to the squark production cross section.\nWe explain both of these cases in detail by considering the various\nsubprocesses for squark production at the LHC.

In this paper, we study their effects on exclusive\nradiative B-meson decays due to the exchange of colourless or coloured charged\nHiggs. It is found that, while constraints from the branching ratios are\nslightly weaker than the ones from the inclusive $B\\to X_{s} \\gamma$ decay, the\nisospin asymmetries in exclusive decays provide very complementary bounds on\nthe model parameters. As the two models predict similar corrections to the\ndipole coefficient $C_7^{\\rm eff}$ whereas similar magnitudes but with opposite\nsigns to $C_8^{\\rm eff}$, the branching ratios cannot discriminate the two\nmodels, and we have to resort to the direct CP and isospin asymmetries of $b\\to\ns$ processes, which are more sensitive to $C_8^{\\rm eff}$. Due to the CKM\nfactors $|\\lambda_u^{(d)}|\\sim|\\lambda_t^{(d)}|$, the terms proportional to\n$\\lambda_u^{(d)}$ make the observables of $b\\to d$ processes exhibit a\ndifferent dependence on the possible new physics phase. In addition,\ncorrelations between the various observables in the exclusive $B\\to V\\gamma$\nand the inclusive $B\\to X_{s,d}\\gamma$ decays are investigated, which could\nprovide further insights into the models with more precise experimental\nmeasurements and theoretical predictions for these decays.\n","Comment: 38 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables; more references and discussions added,\n  matches version published in PRD"]}]

The templates map the waveform shapes to physical\nparameters, thus allowing us to produce posterior probability distributions for\nthese parameters. However, there are attendant dangers in using highly\nrestrictive signal priors. If strong field gravity is not accurately described\nby General Relativity (GR), then using GR templates may result in fundamental\nbias in the recovered parameters, or even worse, a complete failure to detect\nsignals. Here we study such dangers, concentrating on three distinct\npossibilities. First, we show that there exist modified theories compatible\nwith all existing tests that would fail to be detected by the LIGO/Virgo\nnetwork using searches based on GR templates, but which would be detected using\na one parameter post-Einsteinian extension. Second, we study modified theories\nthat produce departures from GR that turn on suddenly at a critical frequency,\nproducing waveforms that do not naively fit into the simplest parameterized\npost-Einsteinian (ppE) scheme. We show that even the simplest ppE templates are\nstill capable of picking up these strange signals and diagnosing a departure\nfrom GR. Third, we study whether using inspiral-only ppE waveforms for signals\nthat include merger and ringdown can lead to problems in misidentifying a GR\ndeparture. We present an easy technique that allows us to self-consistently\nidentify the inspiral portion of the signal, and thus remove these potential\nbiases, allowing GR tests to be performed on higher mass signals that merge\nwithin the detector band.

A\ncharged or massive particle moving in a curved background space-time produces a\nfield that affects its motion, pushing it off its expected geodesic. This\nself-field gives rise to a so-called self-force acting on the particle. In\nmodelling this motion, the self-force approach uses a perturbative expansion in\nthe mass ratio. One of the most interesting sources of gravitational waves are\nextreme mass ratio inspirals - systems perfectly suited to self-force\nmodelling. One of the key problems within the self-force model is the\ndivergence of the field at the particle. To resolve this, the field is split\ninto a singular component and a smooth regular field. This regular-singular\nsplit, introduced by Detweiler and Whiting, is used in most modern self-force\ncalculations. In this thesis, we derive high-order expansions of the\nDetweiler-Whiting singular field, and use these to push the boundaries on\ncurrent precision limits of self-force calculations. Within the mode-sum\nscheme, we give over 14 previously unknown regularisation parameters, almost\ndoubling the current regularisation parameter database. We also produce smooth\neffective sources to high order, and propose an application of the higher terms\nto improve accuracy in the m-mode scheme. Finally, we investigate the status of\nthe cosmic censorship conjecture and the role that the self-force plays. To\nthis end, we give regularisation parameters for non-geodesic motion. We also\nshow the necessity of our results in the exciting area of second order\nself-force calculations, which benefit significantly from high-order coordinate\nexpansions of the singular field. We calculate several parameters that these\nschemes require, and highlight the further advancements possible from the\nresults of this thesis.\n","Comment: PhD Thesis"]}]

The objective of this work is to suggest and validate an approach to\nestimating the K ratio at any soil clay content through characteristics of soil\ntexture and structure. We derive an equation that reflects the interrelation\nbetween the K ratio and soil texture and structure. The K ratio can be\nestimated as the solution of the equation and is determined by the mean size of\nsoil solids and the maximum size of soil aggregates in the oven-dried state,\nindependently of a measured shrinkage curve. To validate the approach we use\navailable data for eight soils.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables"]}]

For high frequency\nor low amplitude driving fields, behavior characteristic of the linearized\nDebye approximation is reproduced. In a higher field regime where magnetic\nsaturation occurs, the magnetization and its harmonics compare well with the\neffective field model.

One-dimensional, local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis was\nperformed on the spectra of the observed stars. A 3D-NLTE analysis was\nperformed to derive the lithium abundance of star #3416. Results. Star #3416 is\nsuper Li-rich with A(Li)=3.75\\,dex. The lack of $^6$Li enrichment\n($^6$Li/$^7$Li$<$2%), the low carbon isotopic ratio\n($^{12}$C/$^{13}$C=14$\\pm$3), and the lack of evidence for radial velocity\nvariation or enhanced rotational velocity ($v\\sin i = 2.8\\,$\\kms) all suggest\nthat lithium production has occurred in this star through the Cameron & Fowler\nmechanism.
