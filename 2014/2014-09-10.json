The resulting final kinetic energy and nickel-56 yields\nconform better to observational values than is the case for the \"classical\" GCD\nmodels. In the present class of models, the ignition of a deflagration phase\nleads to a rising, burning plume of ash. The ash breaks out of the surface of\nthe white dwarf, flows laterally around the star, and converges on the\ncollision region at the antipodal point from where it broke out. The amount of\nenergy released during the deflagration phase is enough to cause the star to\nrapidly expand, so that when the ash reaches the antipodal point, the surface\ndensity is too low to initiate a detonation. Instead, as the ash flows into the\ncollision region (while mixing with surface fuel), the star reaches its\nmaximally expanded state and then contracts. The stellar contraction acts to\nincrease the density of the star, including the density in the collision\nregion. This both raises the temperature and density of the fuel-ash mixture in\nthe collision region and ultimately leads to thermodynamic conditions that are\nnecessary for the Zel'dovich gradient mechanism to produce a detonation. We\ndemonstrate feasibility of this scenario with three 3-dimensional (3D), full\nstar simulations of this model using the FLASH code.

This coupling causes hole states created by photon losses to\nbe rapidly refilled, and the system's many-body gap prevents further photons\nfrom being added once the strongly correlated ground state is reached. The\nfractional quantum Hall state (with a small, transient population of quasihole\nexcitations) is thus the most stable state of the system, and all other\nconfigurations will relax toward it over time.

We use the population\nsynthesis approach using an ABC-MCMC method to characterize the thick disc\nshape, scale height, scale length, local density and flare, and we investigate\nthe extend of the thick disc formation period by simulating several formation\nepisodes. We find that the vertical variation in density is not exponential,\nbut much closer to an hyperbolic secant squared. Assuming a single formation\nepoch, the thick disc is better fitted with a sech2 scale height of 470 pc and\na scale length of 2.3 kpc. However if one simulates two successive formation\nepisodes, mimicking an extended formation period, the older episode has a\nhigher scale height and a larger scale length than the younger episode,\nindicating a contraction during the collapse phase. The scale height decreases\nfrom 800 pc to 340 pc, and the scale length from 3.2 kpc to 2 kpc. The star\nformation increases from the old episode to the young one. During the fitting\nprocess, the halo parameters are also determined. The constraint on the halo\nshows that a transition between a inner and outer halo, if exists, cannot be at\na distance of less than about 30 kpc, which is the limit of our investigation\nusing turnoff halo stars. Finally, we show that extrapolating the thick disc\ntowards the bulge region explains well the stellar populations observed there,\nthat there is no longer need to invoke a classical bulge. To explain these\nresults, the most probable scenario for the thick disc is that it formed while\nthe Galaxy was gravitationally collapsing from well mixed gas-rich giant clumps\nsustained by high turbulence which awhile prevent a thin disc to form, as\nproposed by Bournaud et al. (2009). This scenario explains the observations in\nthe thick disc region as well as in the bulge region.

In this model,\nthe universe evolves from a matter-dominated phase of contraction to an\nEkpyrotic phase of contraction before the nonsingular bounce. The Ekpyrotic\nphase frees the model from unwanted anisotropies, but leaves the universe cold\nand empty of particles after the bounce. For this reason, we explore two\nparticle production mechanisms which take place during the course of the\ncosmological evolution: Parker particle production where the matter field\ncouples only to gravity and particle creation via interactions between the\nmatter field and the bounce field. Although we show that both mechanisms can\nproduce particles in this model, we find that Parker particle production is\nsufficient to reheat the universe to high temperatures.

Magnons pass through a stationary\ndomain wall without reflection and thus exert no force on it. However, they\nreverse their spin upon transmission, thereby transferring two quanta of\nangular momentum to the domain wall and causing it to precess. A precessing\ndomain wall partially reflects magnons back to the source. The reflection of\nspin waves creates a previously identified reactive force. We point out a\nsecond mechanism of propulsion, which we term redshift: magnons passing through\na precessing domain wall lower their frequency by twice the angular velocity of\nthe domain wall; the concomitant reduction of magnons' linear momentum\nindicates momentum transfer to the domain wall. We solve the equations of\nmotion for spin waves in the background of a uniformly precessing domain wall\nwith the aid of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and compute the net force and\ntorque applied by magnons to the domain wall. Redshift is the dominant\nmechanism of propulsion at low spin-wave intensities; reflection dominates at\nhigher intensities.

We develop a class\nof minimal models, denoted as sMSSM -- for flavor symmetry-based minimal\nsupersymmetric standard model, which respect a grand unified symmetry such as\nSO(10) and a non-Abelian flavor symmetry H which suppresses SUSY-induced flavor\nviolation. Explicit examples are constructed with the flavor symmetry being\ngauged SU(2)_H and SO(3)_H with the three families transforming as 2 + 1 and 3\nrepresentations respectively. A simple solution is found in the case of SU(2)_H\nfor suppressing the flavor violating D--terms based on an exchange symmetry.\nExplicit models based on SO(3)_H without the D--term problem are developed. In\naddition, models based on discrete non-Abelian flavor groups are presented\nwhich are automatically free from D--term issues. The permutation group S_3\nwith a 2 + 1 family assignment, as well as the tetrahedral group A_4 with a 3\nassignment are studied. In all cases, a simple solution to the SUSY CP problem\nis found, based on spontaneous CP violation leading to a complex quark mixing\nmatrix. We develop the phenomenology of the resulting sMSSM, which is\ncontrolled by seven soft SUSY breaking parameters for both the 2 + 1 assignment\nand the 3 assignment of fermion families. These models are special cases of the\nphenomenological MSSM (pMSSM), but with symmetry restrictions. We discuss the\nparameter space of sMSSM compatible with LHC searches, B physics constraints\nand dark matter relic abundance. Fine-tuning in these models is relatively\nmild, since all SUSY particles can have masses below about 3 TeV.\n","Comment: 31 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables"]}]

While Paper I concentrated on deriving age,\nmass, and extinction of star clusters for one fixed metallicity, we here derive\nthese parameters in case when metallicity is let free to vary. The results were\nobtained using several different filter systems ($UBVRI$, $UBVRIJHK$,\nGALEX+$UBVRI$), which allowed to optimally reduce the different degeneracies\nbetween the cluster physical parameters. The age, mass, and extinction of a\nsample of artificial star clusters were derived by comparing their broad-band\nintegrated magnitudes with the magnitudes of a large grid of cluster models\nwith various metallicities. A large collection of artificial clusters was\nstudied to model the different degeneracies in the age, mass, extinction, and\nmetallicity parameter space when stochasticity is taken into account in the\ncluster models. We show that, without prior knowledge on the metallicity, the\noptical bands ($UBVRI$) fail to allow a correct derivation of the age, mass,\nand extinction because of the strong degeneracies between models of different\nmetallicities. Adding near-infrared information ($UBVRI$+$JHK$) slightly helps\nin improving the parameter derivation, except for the metallicity. Adding\nultraviolet data (GALEX+$UBVRI$) helps significantly in deriving these\nparameters and allows constraining the metallicity when the photometric errors\nhave a Gaussian distribution with standard deviations 0.05 mag for $UBVRI$ and\n0.15 mag for the GALEX bands.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 9 figures"]}]

This is going to be even more challenging during Run II, with a\nhigher centre-of-mass energy, a higher instantaneous luminosity and pileup, and\nthe impact of out-of-time pileup due to the 25 ns bunch spacing. The online\nalgorithms need to be optimised for such a complex environment in order to keep\nthe output rate under control without impacting the physics efficiency of the\nonline selection. Tracking, for instance, will play an even more important role\nin the event reconstruction. In this poster we will present the performance of\nthe online track and vertex reconstruction algorithms, and their impact on the\nhadronic triggers that make use of b-tagging and of jets reconstructed with the\nParticle Flow technique. We will show the impact of these triggers on physics\nperformance of the experiment, and the latest plans for improvements in view of\nthe Run II data taking in 2015.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1403.1500"]}]

Advanced\nNMR experiments indicate that these conformational changes can occur in the\nabsence of ligand molecules (or with bound ligands), and that the ligands may\n'select' protein conformations for binding (or unbinding). In this review, we\nargue that this conformational selection requires transition times for ligand\nbinding and unbinding that are small compared to the dwell times of proteins in\ndifferent conformations, which is plausible for small ligand molecules. Such a\nseparation of timescales leads to a decoupling and temporal ordering of\nbinding/unbinding events and conformational changes. We propose that\nconformational-selection and induced-change processes (such as induced fit) are\ntwo sides of the same coin, because the temporal ordering is reversed in\nbinding and unbinding direction. Conformational-selection processes can be\ncharacterized by a conformational excitation that occurs prior to a binding or\nunbinding event, while induced-change processes exhibit a characteristic\nconformational relaxation that occurs after a binding or unbinding event. We\ndiscuss how the ordering of events can be determined from relaxation rates and\neffective on- and off-rates determined in mixing experiments, and from the\nconformational exchange rates measured in advanced NMR or single-molecule FRET\nexperiments.

In contrast to aesthetic or affective approaches to image\nanalysis, non-obvious attributes are not related to the personal perspective of\nthe viewer. Instead, they encode a conventional understanding of the world,\nwhich is tacit, rather than explicitly expressed. This paper introduces a\nprocedure for discovering non-obvious attributes using crowdsourcing. We\ndiscuss this procedure using a concrete example of a crowdsourcing task on\nAmazon Mechanical Turk carried out in the domain of fashion. An analysis\ncomparing discovered non-obvious attributes with user tags demonstrated the\nadded value delivered by our procedure.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures, Extended version of paper to appear in CrowdMM\n  2014: International ACM Workshop on Crowdsourcing for Multimedia"]}]

We show that a simple strategy of switching\nbetween different tariffs, based on a comparison of cost densities, delivers\nsignificant cost savings for the great majority of consumers.\n","Comment: 28 Pages, 12 Figures, 3 Tables"]}]
