The model also\npredicts the inverse process, by which the forced bending of a membrane induces\na flow of amphiphilic molecules towards areas of high curvature. In principle,\nnumerical values for the relevant diffusion coefficients should be verifiable\nby experiment.\n","Comment: 10 pages (incl. appendix and references), one figure"]}]

In this work we add chirality to the model monomer and a\nlock-and-key interaction. The self-assembly of free monomers into tubules\nyields a pitch value that often does not match the chirality of the monomer\n(including achiral monomers). We show that this mismatch occurs because of a\ntwist deformation that brings the lateral interaction sites into alignment when\nthe tubule pitch differs from the monomer chirality. The energy cost for this\ndeformation is small as the energy distributions substantially overlap for\nsmall differences in the pitch and chirality. In order to control the tubule\npitch by preventing the twist deformation, the interaction between the vertical\nsurfaces must be increased without resulting in kinetically trapped structures.\nFor this purpose, we employ the lock-and-key interactions and obtain good\ncontrol of the self-assembled tubule pitch. These results explain some\nfundamental features of microtubules. The vertical interaction strength is\nlarger than the lateral in microtubules because this yields a controlled\nassembly of tubules with the proper pitch. We also generally find that the\ncontrol of the assembly into tubules is difficult, which explains the wide\nrange of pitch and protofilament number observed in microtubule assembly.\n","Comment: To appear in Soft Matter, 14 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables,\n  Supplementary Material included"]}]

One of the key obstacles to the effective use of this\ntechnology is the difficulty in interpreting measured spectra to accurately and\nefficiently identify metabolites. Traditional methods for automated metabolite\nidentification compare the target MS or MS/MS spectrum to the spectra in a\nreference database, ranking candidates based on the closeness of the match.\nHowever the limited coverage of available databases has led to an interest in\ncomputational methods for predicting reference MS/MS spectra from chemical\nstructures.\n  This work proposes a probabilistic generative model for the MS/MS\nfragmentation process, which we call Competitive Fragmentation Modeling (CFM),\nand a machine learning approach for learning parameters for this model from\nMS/MS data. We show that CFM can be used in both a MS/MS spectrum prediction\ntask (ie, predicting the mass spectrum from a chemical structure), and in a\nputative metabolite identification task (ranking possible structures for a\ntarget MS/MS spectrum).\n  In the MS/MS spectrum prediction task, CFM shows significantly improved\nperformance when compared to a full enumeration of all peaks corresponding to\nsubstructures of the molecule.

The\nunderstanding of these heating and cooling processes is crucial to provide a\nreliable disk structure for the interpretation of dust continuum emission and\ngas line fluxes. Especially in the upper layers of the disk, where gas and dust\nare thermally decoupled, the infrared line emission is strictly related to the\ngas heating/cooling processes.

One important feature of SCN is that the synchronized\nperiod is close to the cell population mean of intrinsic periods. In this way,\nthe synchronized period of the SCN stays close to the periods of cells in\nperipheral tissues. This is important for SCN to entrain cells throughout the\nbody. However, the mechanism that drives the period of the coupled SCN cells to\nthe population mean is not known. We use mathematical modeling and analysis to\nshow that the mechanism of transcription repression plays a pivotal role in\nregulating the coupled period.

This relationship explains why transcriptional\nrepression appears to occur via protein sequestration in multicellular\norganisms, mammals and Drosophila, in contrast with the phosphorylation-based\nrepression in unicellular organisms.

The\ncapillary force between the tip and substrate is calculated as a function of\ntheir separation h. The force agrees with continuum predictions for h down to ~\n5 to 10nm. At smaller h, the force tends to be less attractive than predicted\nand has strong oscillations. This oscillatory component of the capillary force\nis completely missed in the continuum theory, which only includes contributions\nfrom the surface tension around the circumference of the meniscus and the\npressure difference over the cross section of the meniscus. The oscillation is\nfound to be due to molecular layering of the liquid confined in the narrow gap\nbetween the tip and substrate. This effect is most pronounced for large tip\nradii and/or smooth surfaces. The other two components considered by the\ncontinuum theory are also identified. The surface tension term, as well as the\nmeniscus shape, is accurately described by the continuum prediction for h down\nto ~ 1nm, but the capillary pressure term is always more positive than the\ncorresponding continuum result. This shift in the capillary pressure reduces\nthe average adhesion by a factor as large as 2 from its continuum value and is\nfound to be due to an anisotropy in the pressure tensor. The cross-sectional\ncomponent is consistent with the capillary pressure predicted by the continuum\ntheory (i.e., the Young-Laplace equation), but the normal pressure that\ndetermines the capillary force is always more positive than the continuum\ncounterpart.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 14 figures"]}]

In\nthis work, we establish an SU(2) Ginzburg-Landau theory for degenerate Fermi\ngases with the synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields.

A coarse-graining in quantum\nmeasurement has recently been suggested as its possible account in addition to\nthe usual decoherence model. We here investigate the reconstruction of a\nGaussian state (single mode and two modes) by coarse-grained homodyne\nmeasurements. To this aim, we employ two methods, the direct reconstruction of\nthe covariance matrix and the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE),\nrespectively, and examine the reconstructed state under each scheme compared to\nthe state interacting with a Gaussian (squeezed thermal) reservoir. We clearly\ndemonstrate that the coarse-graining model, though applied equally to all\nquadrature amplitudes, is not compatible with the decoherence model by a\nthermal (phase-insensitive) reservoir. Furthermore, we compare the performance\nof the direct reconstruction and the MLE methods by investigating the fidelity\nand the nonclassicality of the reconstructed states and show that the MLE\nmethod can generally yield a more reliable reconstruction, particularly without\ninformation on a reference frame (phase of input state).\n","Comment: published version, 9 pages, 5 figures"]}]
