This system\nconsists of two confirmed transiting planets, Kepler-51b ($P_{\\rm b} =\n45.2\\,\\mathrm{days}$) and Kepler-51c ($P_{\\rm c} = 85.3\\,\\mathrm{days}$), and\none transiting planet candidate KOI-620.02 ($P_{02} = 130.2\\,\\mathrm{days}$),\nwhich lie close to a $1:2:3$ resonance chain. Our analysis shows that their\nTTVs are consistently explained by the three-planet model, and constrains their\nmasses as $M_{\\rm b} = 2.1_{-0.8}^{+1.5} M_{\\oplus}$ (Kepler-51b), $M_{\\rm c} =\n4.0 \\pm 0.4 M_{\\oplus}$ (Kepler-51c), and $M_{02} = 7.6 \\pm 1.1 M_{\\oplus}$\n(KOI-620.02), thus confirming KOI-620.02 as a planet in this system. The masses\ninferred from the TTVs are rather small compared to the planetary radii based\non the stellar density and planet-to-star radius ratios determined from the\ntransit light curves. Combining these estimates, we find that all three planets\nin this system have densities among the lowest determined, $\\rho_p \\lesssim\n0.05\\,{\\rm g\\,cm^{-3}}$. With this feature, the Kepler-51 system serves as\nanother example of low-density compact multi-transiting planetary systems. We\nalso identify a curious feature in the archived Kepler light curve during the\ndouble transit of Kepler-51b and KOI-620.02, which could be explained by their\noverlapping on the stellar disk (a planet-planet eclipse). If this is really\nthe case, the sky-plane inclination of KOI-620.02's orbit relative to that of\nKepler-51b is given by $\\Delta \\Omega = -25.3_{-6.8}^{+6.2}\\mathrm{deg}$,\nimplying significant misalignment of their orbital planes. This interpretation,\nhowever, seems unlikely because such an event that is consistent with all of\nthe observations is found to be exceedingly rare.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

Hence to predict the\nfate of any individual variant, we must know the rate at which new mutations\ncreate competing lineages of higher fitness. Here, we directly measured the\neffect of this interference on the fates of specific adaptive variants in\nlaboratory Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations and used these measurements to\ninfer the distribution of fitness effects of new beneficial mutations.

Ideally, it is\nassumed that the covariance among independent variables will be zero (no\ncorrelation at all), however, typically there will be some colinearities.\nTherefore, we analyzed the role of slight covariance on influencing species\nvariation partitioning. We concluded that when the covariance between spatial\nand environmental predictors is positive, all the three components-pure\nenvironmental, spatial variations and mixed covariation were over-fitted, with\nthe sign of the true covariation being negative. In contrast, when the\ncovariance is negative, all the three components were under-fitted with the\nsign of true covariation being positive.

We analyzed a series of boxes taken\nover AR plages and the QS, to determine how the continuum intensity contrast of\nmagnetic elements, the amplitude of the vertical flows and the box-averaged\ncontrast were affected by the mean longitudinal field strength in the box\n(which scales with the total unsigned flux in the box).\n  Our results suggest that as the magnetic flux increases locally (e.g. from\nweak network to strong plage), the heating of the magnetic elements is reduced\nby the intermediate of a more suppressed convective energy transport within the\nlarger and stronger magnetic patches. This, together with the known presence of\nlarger magnetic features, could explain the previously found lower contrasts of\nthe brightest magnetic elements in ARs compared to the QS. The inhibition of\nconvection also affects the average continuum brightness of a photospheric\nregion, so that at disk center, an area of photosphere in strong network or\nplage appears darker than a purely quiet one.

Compared to the\ncorresponding numerical routines, we have identified three main difficulties\nspecific to linear algebra over finite fields. First, the arithmetic complexity\ncould be dominated by modular reductions. Therefore, it is mandatory to delay\nas much as possible these reductions while mixing fine-grain parallelizations\nof tiled iterative and recursive algorithms. Second, fast linear algebra\nvariants, e.g., using Strassen-Winograd algorithm, never suffer from\ninstability and can thus be widely used in cascade with the classical\nalgorithms. There, trade-offs are to be made between size of blocks well suited\nto those fast variants or to load and communication balancing. Third, many\napplications over finite fields require the rank profile of the matrix (quite\noften rank deficient) rather than the solution to a linear system. It is thus\nimportant to design parallel algorithms that preserve and compute this rank\nprofile. Moreover, as the rank profile is only discovered during the algorithm,\nblock size has then to be dynamic. We propose and compare several block\ndecomposition: tile iterative with left-looking, right-looking and Crout\nvariants, slab and tile recursive. Experiments demonstrate that the tile\nrecursive variant performs better and matches the performance of reference\nnumerical software when no rank deficiency occur. Furthermore, even in the most\nheterogeneous case, namely when all pivot blocks are rank deficient, we show\nthat it is possbile to maintain a high efficiency.\n"]}]

A permutation is bicrucial\nwith respect to squares if it is square-free but any extension of it to the\nright or to the left by any element gives a permutation that is not\nsquare-free.\n  Bicrucial permutations with respect to squares were studied by Avgustinovich\net al., who proved that there exist bicrucial permutations of lengths $8k+1,\n8k+5, 8k+7$ for $k\\ge 1$. It was left as open questions whether bicrucial\npermutations of even length, or such permutations of length $8k+3$ exist. In\nthis paper, we provide an encoding of orderings which allows us, using the\nconstraint solver Minion, to show that bicrucial permutations of even length\nexist, and the smallest such permutations are of length 32. To show that 32 is\nthe minimum length in question, we establish a result on left-crucial (that is,\nnot extendable to the left) square-free permutations which begin with three\nelements in monotone order. Also, we show that bicrucial permutations of length\n$8k+3$ exist for $k=2,3$ and they do not exist for $k=1$.\n  Further, we generalise the notions of right-crucial, left-crucial, and\nbicrucial permutations studied in the literature in various contexts, by\nintroducing the notion of $P$-crucial permutations that can be extended to the\nnotion of $P$-crucial words. In S-crucial permutations, a particular case of\n$P$-crucial permutations, we deal with permutations that avoid prohibitions,\nbut whose extensions in any position contain a prohibition. We show that\nS-crucial permutations exist with respect to squares, and minimal such\npermutations are of length 17.\n  Finally, using our software, we generate much of relevant data showing, for\nexample, that there are 162,190,472 bicrucial square-free permutations of\nlength 19.\n"]}]
