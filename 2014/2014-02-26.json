As another\napplication, we show that under our convexity assumptions, $q$-log-Sobolev\ninequalities ($q \\in [1,2]$) are equivalent to an appropriate family of\nisoperimetric inequalities, extending results of Bakry--Ledoux and\nBobkov--Zegarlinski. Our results extend to the more general setting of\nRiemannian manifolds with density which satisfy the $CD(0,\\infty)$\ncurvature-dimension condition of Bakry--\\'Emery.\n","Comment: 42 pages, to appear in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical\n  Society; small revision"]}]

The purpose of this\narticle is to shed more light on these interactions. We prove that if X and X'\nare cobordant closed smooth 4-manifolds with the same euler characteristics,\nand if one of them is simply-connected, then there is a cobordism between them\nwhich is composed of round 2-handles only, and therefore one can pass from one\nto the other via a sequence of generalized logarithmic transforms along tori.\nAs a corollary, we obtain a new proof of a theorem of Iwase's, which is a\n4-dimensional analogue of the Lickorish-Wallace theorem for 3-manifolds: Every\nclosed simply-connected 4-manifold can be produced by a surgery along a\ndisjoint union of tori contained in a connected sum of copies of CP^2, -CP^2\nand S^1 x S^3. These answer some of the open problems posted by Ron Stern,\nwhile suggesting more constraints on the cobordisms in consideration. We also\nuse round handles to show that every infinite family of mutually\nnon-diffeomorphic closed smooth oriented simply-connected 4-manifolds in the\nsame homeomorphism class constructed up to date consists of members that become\ndiffeomorphic after one stabilization with S^2 x S^2 if members are all\nnon-spin, and with S^2 x S^2 # -CP^2 if they are spin. In particular, we show\nthat simple cobordisms exist between knot surgered manifolds. We then show that\ngeneralized logarithmic transforms can be seen as standard logarithmic\ntransforms along fiber components of broken Lefschetz fibrations, and show how\nchanging the smooth structures on a fixed homeomorphism class of a closed\nsmooth 4-manifold can be realized as relevant modifications of a broken\nLefschetz fibration on it.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 1 figure.

Note that the traditional methods for proving minimality\n(calibrations and slicing arguments) do not apply here, we are obliged to use\nsome more complicated arguments such as a stopping time argument, harmonic\nextensions, Federer-Fleming projections, etc. that are rarely used to prove\nminimality (they are often used to prove regularity). The regularity results\nfor 2-dimensional Almgren minimal sets ([5],[6]) are also needed here.\n","Comment: 67 pages"]}]

The space M_8 comes with a natural embedding in P^{13}, or more precisely,\nthe projectivization of the S_8-representation V_{4,4}. There is a single\nS_8-skew cubic C in P^{13}. The fact that M_8 lies on the skew cubic C is a\nconsequence of Thomae's formula for hyperelliptic curves, but more is true: M_8\nis the singular locus of C. These constructions yield the free resolution of\nM_8, and are used in the determination of the \"single\" equation cutting out the\nGIT quotient of n points in P^1 in general. The space N'_8 comes with a natural\nembedding in P^{13}, or more precisely, PV_{2,2,2,2}. There is a single skew\nquintic Q containing N'_8, and N'_8 is the singular locus of the skew quintic\nQ. The skew cubic C and skew quintic Q are projectively dual. (In particular,\nthey are surprisingly singular, in the sense of having a dual of remarkably low\ndegree.) The divisor on the skew cubic blown down by the dual map is the secant\nvariety Sec(M_8), and the contraction Sec(M_8) - - > N'_8 factors through N_8\nvia the space of 8 points on a quadric surface.

Nonetheless, there are many challenging problems arising in\ntraining cascade detectors. One common issue is that the node classifier is\ntrained with a symmetric classifier. Having a low misclassification error rate\ndoes not guarantee an optimal node learning goal in cascade classifiers, i.e.,\nan extremely high detection rate with a moderate false positive rate.

To achieve this,\nwe separate the classifier training into two steps: finding a pool of\ndiscriminative weak classifiers/features and training the final classifier by\npruning weak classifiers which contribute little to the asymmetric learning\ncriterion (asymmetric classifier construction). Our model reduction approach\nhelps accelerate the learning time while achieving the pre-determined learning\nobjective.

For the harmonic\noscillator mean-field potential, we explicitly determine these solutions and\nthe corresponding eigenvalues, and derive the set of equations that determine\nself-consistently the parameters. To explore the relative importance of the\nvarious model features and approximations, we perform a preliminary scoping\ncalculation of the excitation energy of the first excited states in the light\nnuclei using a sum rule to determine the oscillation frequency. The preliminary\nresults indicate that, except in the lightest nuclei, the excitation energies\nare significantly overpredicted in the light nuclei due to the neglect, among\nother factors, of the deformation degree of freedom. The model derivation\npresented here serves as guide for eventually developing a corresponding model\nfor the vibrational-rotational motion in deformed nuclei.\n","Comment: 1.

Two main approaches to the calculation of\ndirectivity patterns of laser-generated sound are discussed for the most\nimportant case of thermo-optical regime of generation. The first approach,\nwhich is widely used in practice, is based on the simple modelling of the\nequivalent thermo-optical source as a mechanical dipole comprising two\nhorizontal forces applied to the surface in opposite directions. The second\napproach is based on the rigorous theory that takes into account all\nacoustical, optical and thermal parameters of a solid material and all\ngeometrical and physical parameters of a laser beam. Directivity patterns of\nlaser-generated bulk longitudinal and shear elastic waves, as well as the\namplitudes of generated Rayleigh surface waves, are calculated for different\nvalues of physical and geometrical parameters and compared with the directivity\npatterns calculated in case of dipole-source representation. It is demonstrated\nthat the simple approach using a dipole-source representation of\nlaser-generated sound is rather limited, especially for description of\ngenerated longitudinal acoustic waves. A practical criterion is established to\ndefine the conditions under which the dipole-source representation gives\npredictions with acceptable errors. It is shown that, for radiation in the\nnormal direction to the surface, the amplitudes of longitudinal waves are\nespecially sensitive to the values of thermal parameters and of the acoustic\nreflection coefficient from a free solid surface. A discussion is given on the\npossibility of using such a high sensitivity to the values of the reflection\ncoefficient for investigation of surface properties of real solids.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 7 figures"]}]

The flow randomization is a crucial phase before flow\ntransition to the turbulent state. According to existing literatures, the\nrandomization was caused by the big background noises and non-periodic spanwise\nboundary conditions. It was assumed that the large ring structure is affected\nby background noises first, and then the change of large ring structure affects\nthe small length scales quickly, which directly leads to randomization and\nformation of turbulence. However, by careful analysis of our high order DNS\nresults, we believe that the internal instability of multiple ring cycles\nstructure is the main reason. What we observed is that randomization begins\nwhen the third cycle overlaps the first and second cycles. A significant\nasymmetric phenomenon is originated from the second cycle in the middle of both\nstreamwise and spanwise directions. More technically, a visible asymmetric\nphenomenon in the middle vortex ring cycle starts at time step t=16.25T and\nx=838.9{\\delta}in where the top and bottom level rings are still completely\nsymmetric. The non-symmetric structure of middle level ring affects the small\nlength scale in boundary layer bottom quickly. The randomization phenomenon\nspreads to top level through ejections. Finally, the whole flow domain becomes\nrandomized. A hypothesis of C- and K-types shift is given as a possible\nmechanism of flow randomization.\n","Comment: 51st AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting. arXiv admin note: substantial\n  text overlap with arXiv:1402.5873"]}]

The key notions used in this paper and proposed by us in our\nprevious work are the notions of an order saturation monad and a saturator. A\nsaturator operator can be intuitively understood as a reflexive, transitive\nclosure operator. There are two approaches towards defining saturators for\ncoalgebras with internal moves. Here, we give necessary conditions for them to\nyield the same notion of weak bisimulation.\n  Finally, we propose a definition of trace semantics for coalgebras with\nsilent moves via a uniform fixed point operator.

We solve\nthe analogous problem for germs of generic rank 2 distributions in ${\\mathbb\nR}^n$ for n>5. We use a completely different approach based on the\nsymplectification of the problem. The main idea is to consider a special\nodd-dimensional submanifold $W_D$ of the cotangent bundle associated with any\nrank 2 distribution D. It is naturally foliated by characteristic curves, which\nare also called the abnormal extremals of the distribution D. The dynamics of\nvertical fibers along characteristic curves defines certain curves of flags of\nisotropic and coisotropic subspaces in a linear symplectic space. Using the\nclassical theory of curves in projective spaces, we construct the canonical\nframe of the distribution D on a certain (2n-1)-dimensional fiber bundle over\n$W_D$ with the structure group of all M\\\"obius transformations, preserving 0.\n","Comment: 21 pages, this is the long version of the short note math.DG/0504319\n  (the latter was published in C.R.
