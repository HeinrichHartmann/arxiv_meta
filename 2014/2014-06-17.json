The instability of the accretion disk caused by the\nsuperburst would be an explanation for the outburst, whereas the mass accretion\nof the matter evaporated from surface of the companion star by the superburst\nwould be another possibility.\n","Comment: 5 pages 4 figures"]}]

Robustness\nis achieved through the reciprocity of the embedding and detection invariants.\nThe embedded patterns are real onedimensional Mellin monomial patterns\ndistributed over two-dimensions.

In this paper, we show that all successful $MAP$\nand variational algorithms share a common framework, relying on the following\nkey principles: sparsity promotion in the gradient domain, $l_2$ regularization\nfor kernel estimation, and the use of convex (often quadratic) cost functions.\nOur observations lead to a unified understanding of the principles required for\nsuccessful blind deconvolution.

We vary the initial direction of the\ntotal spin S with respect to the orbital angular momentum L, covering the 2\ndimensional space of orientation angles with 38 configurations consisting of 36\nconfigurations distributed in the azimuthal angle phi and polar angle theta,\nand two configurations on the poles. In all cases, we set the initial\ndimensionless BH spins to 0.8. We observe that during the late-inspiral stage,\nthe total angular momentum of the system J remains within 5 deg of its original\ndirection, with the largest changes in direction occurring when the spins are\nnearly counter-aligned with the orbital angular momentum. We also observe that\nthe angle between S and L is nearly conserved during the inspiral phase. These\ntwo dynamical properties allow us to propose a new phenomenological formula for\nthe final mass and spin of merged BHs in terms of the individual masses and\nspins of the progenitor binary at far separations. We determine coefficients of\nthis formula (in the equal-mass limit) using a least-squares fit to the results\nof this new set of 38 runs, an additional set of five new configurations with\nspins aligned/counteraligned with the orbital angular momentum, and over 100\nrecent simulations. We find that our formulas reproduce the remnant mass and\nspin of these simulations to within a relative error of 2.5%. We discuss the\nregion of validity of this dynamical picture for precessing unequal-mass\nbinaries. Finally, we perform a statistical study to see the consequence of\nthis new formula for distributions of spin-magnitudes and remnant masses with\napplications to BH-spin distributions and gravitational radiation in\ncosmological scenarios involving several mergers.\n","Comment: Text and figures improved for clarity"]}]

Ranking algorithms based on random walks are particularly useful\nbecause they connect topological and diffusive properties of the network.\nPrevious methods based on random walks, as for example the PageRank, have\nfocused on static structures. However, several realistic networks are indeed\ndynamic, meaning that their structure changes in time. In this paper, we\npropose a centrality measure for temporal networks based on random walks which\nwe call TempoRank. While in a static network, the stationary density of the\nrandom walk is proportional to the degree or the strength of a node, we find\nthat in temporal networks, the stationary density is proportional to the\nin-strength of the so-called effective network. The stationary density also\ndepends on the sojourn probability q which regulates the tendency of the walker\nto stay in the node. We apply our method to human interaction networks and show\nthat although it is important for a node to be connected to another node with\nmany random walkers at the right moment (one of the principles of the\nPageRank), this effect is negligible in practice when the time order of link\nactivation is included.\n","Comment: main text + supplementary material"]}]

In previous papers, we studied the bosonic\nt-J model by both analytical methods and numerical Monte - Carlo (MC)\nsimulations. However, in the case of finite $J_z$, where $J_z$ is the\n$z$-component coupling constant of the pseudospin interaction, the phase\ndiagram of the model was investigated by assuming the checkerboard type of\nboson densities. In this study, we shall continue our previous study of the\nbosonic t-J model using both the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) theory and MC\nsimulations without assuming any pattern of boson densities. These two methods\ncomplement each other and give reliable results. We show that as $J_z$ is\nincreased, the superfluid state evolves into a supersolid (SS), and furthermore\ninto a genuine solid with the checkerboard symmetry. In the present study, we\npropose a method identifying quantum phase transitions in the GP theory.

Intrinsic stochasticity of human control in\n  virtual stick balancing"],"description":["  Understanding how humans control unstable systems is central to many research\nproblems, with applications ranging from quiet standing to aircraft landing.\nIncreasingly much evidence appears in favor of event-driven control hypothesis:\nhuman operators only start actively controlling the system when the discrepancy\nbetween the current and desired system states becomes large enough. The\nevent-driven models based on the concept of threshold can explain many features\nof the experimentally observed dynamics. However, much still remains unclear\nabout the dynamics of human-controlled systems, which likely indicates that\nhumans employ more intricate control mechanisms. The present paper argues that\ncontrol activation in humans may be not threshold-driven, but instead\nintrinsically stochastic, noise-driven. Specifically, we suggest that control\nactivation stems from stochastic interplay between the operator's need to keep\nthe controlled system near the goal state on one hand and the tendency to\npostpone interrupting the system dynamics on the other hand. We propose a model\ncapturing this interplay and show that it matches the experimental data on\nhuman balancing of virtual overdamped stick. Our results illuminate that the\nnoise-driven activation mechanism plays a crucial role at least in the\nconsidered task, and, hypothetically, in a broad range of human-controlled\nprocesses.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables"]}]

With the advent of\ngravitational-wave (GW) astronomy, environmental effects on the GW signal will\neventually have to be quantified. Here we present a wide survey of the\ncorrections due to these effects in two situations of great interest for GW\nastronomy: the black hole (BH) ringdown emission and the inspiral of two\ncompact objects. We take into account various effects such as: electric\ncharges, magnetic fields, cosmological evolution, possible deviations from\nGeneral Relativity, firewalls, and various forms of matter such as accretion\ndisks and dark matter halos. Our analysis predicts the existence of resonances\ndictated by the external mass distribution, which dominate the very late-time\nbehavior of merger/ringdown waveforms. The mode structure can drastically\ndiffer from the vacuum case, yet the BH response to external perturbations is\nunchanged at the time scales relevant for detectors. This is because although\nthe vacuum Schwarzschild resonances are no longer quasinormal modes of the\nsystem, they still dominate the response at intermediate times. Our results\nstrongly suggest that both parametrized and ringdown searches should use at\nleast two-mode templates. Our analysis of compact binaries shows that\nenvironmental effects are typically negligible for most eLISA sources, with the\nexception of very few special extreme mass ratio inspirals. We show in\nparticular that accretion and hydrodynamic drag generically dominate over\nself-force effects for geometrically thin disks, whereas they can be safely\nneglected for geometrically thick disk environments, which are the most\nrelevant for eLISA.

We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of this model on a range of document modelling tasks, achieving\nstrong results with no feature engineering and with a more compact model.\nInspired by recent advances in visualising deep convolution networks for\ncomputer vision, we present a novel visualisation technique for our document\nnetworks which not only provides insight into their learning process, but also\ncan be interpreted to produce a compelling automatic summarisation system for\ntexts.\n"]}]

A considerable effort is currently being made to\ndevelop theoretical models capable of providing a fully quantitative\ndescription of the neutrino-nucleus cross sections in the kinematical regime\nrelevant to LBNE.

This problem can be solved using the chase algorithm, which extends\nthe given set of facts with fresh facts in order to satisfy the rules. If the\nchase terminates, then CQs can be evaluated directly in the resulting set of\nfacts. The chase, however, does not terminate necessarily, and checking whether\nthe chase terminates on a given set of rules and facts is undecidable. Numerous\nacyclicity notions were proposed as sufficient conditions for chase\ntermination. In this paper, we present two new acyclicity notions called\nmodel-faithful acyclicity (MFA) and model-summarising acyclicity (MSA).\nFurthermore, we investigate the landscape of the known acyclicity notions and\nestablish a complete taxonomy of all notions known to us. Finally, we show that\nMFA and MSA generalise most of these notions.\n  Existential rules are closely related to the Horn fragments of the OWL 2\nontology language; furthermore, several prominent OWL 2 reasoners implement CQ\nanswering by using the chase to materialise all relevant facts. In order to\navoid termination problems, many of these systems handle only the OWL 2 RL\nprofile of OWL 2; furthermore, some systems go beyond OWL 2 RL, but without any\ntermination guarantees. In this paper we also investigate whether various\nacyclicity notions can provide a principled and practical solution to these\nproblems. On the theoretical side, we show that query answering for acyclic\nontologies is of lower complexity than for general ontologies. On the practical\nside, we show that many of the commonly used OWL 2 ontologies are MSA, and that\nthe number of facts obtained by materialisation is not too large. Our results\nthus suggest that principled development of materialisation-based OWL 2\nreasoners is practically feasible.\n"]}]
