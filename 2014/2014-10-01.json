We can alter these surface by performing the entirely local\noperations of adding handles and/or crosscaps, each of which increases genus.\n  The main result then shows that if we are given an alternating projection\nP(L) and a surface S spanning L, we can construct a surface T spanning L with\nthe same genus, orientability, and aggregate slope as S that is a basic layered\nsurface with respect to P, except perhaps at a collection of added crosscaps\nand/or handles. Furthermore, S must be connected if L is non-splittable. This\nresult has several useful corollaries. In particular, it allows for the\ndetermination of nonorientable genus for alternating links. It also can be used\nto show that mutancy of alternating links preserves nonorientable genus.

Tuning the itinerant electron density in the model\ndrives transitions between a heavy Fermi liquid phase with screened moments and\nvarious magnetic states. The dependence of the magnetic phenomena on the\nelectron density or gate voltage stems from competing magnetic interactions\nbetween the local moments and the different conduction bands. At low densities\nonly the lowest conduction band, composed of the $d_{xy}$ orbitals of Ti, is\noccupied. Its antiferromagnetic interaction with the local moments leads to\nscreening of the moments at a Kondo scale that increases with density. However,\nabove a critical density, measured in experiments to be $n_c\\approx 1.7\\times\n10^{13} cm^{-2}$, the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ bands begin to populate.

Recently, metallic LiOsO3, was discovered to be the\nfirst clear-cut example of an Anderson-Blount \"ferroelectric\" metal, which at\n140 K undergoes a ferroelectric-like structural transition similar to\ninsulating LiNbO3. This is very surprising because the mechanisms for\nstructural phase transitions are usually quite distinct in metals and\ninsulators. Through performing first principles calculations, here we reveal\nthat the local polar distortion in LiOsO3 is solely due to the instability of\nthe A-site Li atom, in contrast to the LiNbO3 case where the second order\nJahn-Teller effect of the B-site Nb ion also plays an additional role. More\nimportantly, the \"ferroelectric\"-like long range order of the local polar\ndistortion is found to be due to the predominantly ferroelectric short-range\npair interactions between the local polar modes which are not screened by\nconduction electrons. Furthermore, we predict that LiNbO3-type MgReO3 is also a\n\"ferroelectric\" metal, but with a much higher structural transition temperature\nby 391 K than LiOsO3.

Previously we have reported that the impurity reaches a\nnon-thermal steady state, characterized by an impurity momentum $p_\\infty$\ndepending on its initial momentum $p_0$. In the present paper the detailed\nderivation of $p_\\infty(p_0)$ is provided. We also study the motion of an\nimpurity under the action of a constant force $F$. It is demonstrated that if\nthe impurity is heavier than the host particles, $m_i>m_h$, damped oscillations\nof the impurity momentum develop, while in the opposite case, $m_i<m_h$,\noscillations are absent. The steady state momentum as a function of the applied\nforce is determined. In the limit of weak force it is found to be force\nindependent for a light impurity and proportional to $\\sqrt{F}$ for a heavy\nimpurity.\n"]}]

Furthermore, collisions of cosmic rays with the focal plane\nproduced transient signals in the data (glitches) with a wide range of\ncharacteristics. A study of cosmic ray impacts on the HFI detector modules has\nbeen undertaken to categorize and characterize the glitches, to correct the HFI\ntime-ordered data, and understand the residual effects on Planck maps and data\nproducts. This paper presents an evaluation of the physical origins of glitches\nobserved by the HFI detectors. In order to better understand the glitches\nobserved by HFI in flight, several ground-based experiments were conducted with\nflight-spare HFI bolometer modules. The experiments were conducted between 2010\nand 2013 with HFI test bolometers in different configurations using varying\nparticles and impact energies. The bolometer modules were exposed to 23 MeV\nprotons from the Orsay IPN TANDEM accelerator, and to $^{241}$Am and $^{244}$Cm\n$\\alpha$-particle and $^{55}$Fe radioactive X-ray sources. The calibration data\nfrom the HFI ground-based preflight tests were used to further characterize the\nglitches and compare glitch rates with statistical expectations under\nlaboratory conditions. Test results provide strong evidence that the dominant\nfamily of glitches observed in flight are due to cosmic ray absorption by the\nsilicon die substrate on which the HFI detectors reside. Glitch energy is\npropagated to the thermistor by ballistic phonons, while there is also a\nthermal diffusion contribution.

The latter decay\nchannel avoids the most stringent constraints of the sequestered setting.\nNevertheless, a rather robust prediction for a substantial amount of Dark\nRadiation can be made.

Special emphasis is laid on the\nanalysis of the spatial distribution of chemical abundances, emission-line\nratios and kinematics of the ISM, and to the recent star-forming activity in\nthis galaxy. This study is based on optical integral field unit spectroscopy\ndata from Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph at the Gemini North telescope and\narchival Sloan Digital Sky Survey images. The data were obtained in two\ndifferent positions across the galaxy, obtaining a total 4 arcsec X 8 arcsec\nfield which encompasses most of its ISM. Emission-line maps and broad-band\nimages obtained in this study indicate that HS 2236+1344 hosts three Giant HII\nregions. Our data also reveal some faint curved features in the BCD periphery\nthat might be due to tidal perturbations or expanding ionized-gas shells. The\nISM velocity field shows systematic gradients along the major axis of the BCD,\nwith its south-eastern and north-western half differing by ~80 km/s in their\nrecessional velocity.

The magnetic field is\nfound to be globally horizontal with a relatively weak field strength (8-15\nGauss).

The identification of more sources in this unique\nstage of stellar evolution will enable us to study the origin of bipolar PNe\nmorphologies in more detail. We present the results of seven sources observed\nwith the JVLA that were identified as water fountain candidates in an\nEffelsberg 100m telescope survey of 74 AGB and early post-AGB stars. We find\nthat our sample of water fountain candidates displays strong variability in\ntheir 22 GHz H2O maser spectra. The JVLA observations show an extended bipolar\nH2O maser outflow for one source, the OH/IR star IRAS 18455+0448. This source\nwas previously classified as a 'dying' OH/IR star based on the exponential\ndecrease of its 1612 MHz OH maser and the lack of H2O masers. We therefore also\nre-observed the 1612, 1665, and 1667 MHz OH masers.

Its kinematic age is approximately 70 yr, but could\nbe lower, depending on the distance and inclination. Previous observations\nindicate, with significant uncertainty, that IRAS 18455+0448 has a surprisingly\nlow mass compared to available estimates for other water fountain nebulae.

The presence of GRB-SNe is revealed by rebrightenings emerging from\nthe optical GRB afterglow $10$--$15$ days, in the rest-frame of the source,\nafter the prompt GRB emission. Aims: \\textit{Fermi}-GBM has a field of view\n(FoV) which is about 6.5 times larger than the FoV of \\textit{Swift}, therefore\nwe expect that a number of GRB-SN connections have been missed due to lack of\noptical and X-ray instruments on board of \\textit{Fermi}, which are essential\nto reveal SNe associated with GRBs. This fact has motivated our search in the\n\\textit{Fermi} catalogue for possible GRB-SN events. Methods: The search for\npossible GRB-SN associations follows two requirements: (1) SN should fall\ninside the \\textit{Fermi}-GBM error box of the considered long GRB, and (2)\nthis GRB should occur within $20$ days before the SN event. Results: We have\nfound $5$ cases, within $z<0.2$ fulfilling the above reported requirements. One\nof them, GRB 130702A-SN 2013dx, was already known as GRB-SN association. We\nhave analyzed the remaining $4$ cases and we concluded that three of them are,\nvery likely, just random coincidences, due to the \\textit{Fermi}-GBM large\nerror box associated with each GRB detection. We found one GRB possibly\nassociated with a SN 1998bw-like, GRB 120121B/SN 2012ba. Conclusions: The very\nlow redshift of GRB 120121B/SN 2012ba ($z = 0.017$) implies a low isotropic\nenergy of this burst ($E_{iso} = 1.39 \\times 10^{48}$) erg. We then compute the\nrate of \\textit{Fermi} low-luminosity GRBs connected with SNe to be $\\rho_{0,b}\n\\leq 770\\ $Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$.

We determined the dust composition from\nthe spectroscopic data, and derived the ejected dust mass, dust mass-loss rate,\nand other dust shell properties by modeling the SED of R71.

Our\nmodel calculation shows that dust is dominated by amorphous silicates, with\nsome crystalline silicates, metallic iron, and a very tiny amount of polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. The presence of both silicates and PAHs\nindicates that the dust has a mixed chemistry.

If K is a fixed finite complex, Greg Arone has\nrecently given an explicit model for the Goodwillie tower of the functor\nsending a space X to the suspension spectrum \\Sigma^\\infty Map_T(K,X). Applying\na generalized homology theory h_* to this tower yields a spectral sequence, and\nthis will converge strongly to h_*(Map_T(K,X)) under suitable conditions, e.g.\nif h_* is connective and X is at least dim K connected. Even when the\nconvergence is more problematic, it appears the spectral sequence can still\nshed considerable light on h_*(Map_T(K,X)). Similar comments hold when a\ncohomology theory is applied. In this paper we study how various important\nnatural constructions on mapping spaces induce extra structure on the towers.\nThis leads to useful interesting additional structure in the associated\nspectral sequences. For example, the diagonal on Map_T(K,X) induces a\n`diagonal' on the associated tower. After applying any cohomology theory with\nproducts h^*, the resulting spectral sequence is then a spectral sequence of\ndifferential graded algebras. The product on the E_\\infty -term corresponds to\nthe cup product in h^*(Map_T(K,X)) in the usual way, and the product on the\nE_1-term is described in terms of group theoretic transfers. We use explicit\nequivariant S-duality maps to show that, when K is the sphere S^n, our\nconstructions at the fiber level have descriptions in terms of the\nBoardman-Vogt little n-cubes spaces. We are then able to identify, in a\ncomputationally useful way, the Goodwillie tower of the functor from spectra to\nspectra sending a spectrum X to \\Sigma ^\\infty \\Omega ^\\infty X.\n","Comment: Published by Algebraic and Geometric Topology at\n  http://www.maths.warwick.ac.uk/agt/AGTVol2/agt-2-28.abs.html"]}]

The category U_0 is the one of locally finite modules, i.e. the\nmodules that are direct limit of finite modules. The conjecture is as follows,\nlet X be a space then :\n  * either H^*X is locally finite, * or H^*X does not belong to U_n, for all n.\n  As an example the cohomology of a finite space, or of the loop space of a\nfinite space are always locally finite.

The exception that they\nmention is the case in which V is symmetric, which leads to V-Cat being\nsymmetric as well. The symmetry in V-Cat is based upon the symmetry of V. The\nmotivation behind this paper is in part to describe how these facts relating V\nand V-Cat are in turn related to a categorical analogue of topological\ndelooping. To do so I need to pass to a more general setting than braided and\nsymmetric categories -- in fact the k-fold monoidal categories of Balteanu et\nal in [Iterated Monoidal Categories, Adv.

It seems\nthat the analogy of loop spaces is a good guide for how to define the concept\nof enrichment over various types of monoidal objects, including k-fold monoidal\ncategories and their higher dimensional counterparts. The main result is that\nfor V a k-fold monoidal category, V-Cat becomes a (k-1)-fold monoidal\n2-category in a canonical way. In the next paper I indicate how this process\nmay be iterated by enriching over V-Cat, along the way defining the 3-category\nof categories enriched over V-Cat.

These spaces are closed semi-algebraic subsets of the variety of\ncharacters of representations of the fundamental group of M in SL_{n+1}(R). The\nboundary was constructed as the tropicalization of this semi-algebraic set.\nHere we show that the geometric interpretation for the points of the boundary\ncan be constructed searching for a tropical analogue to an action of the group\non a projective space. To do this we need to construct a tropical projective\nspace with many invertible projective maps. We achieve this using a\ngeneralization of the Bruhat-Tits buildings for SL_{n+1} to non-archimedean\nfields with real surjective valuation. In the case n = 1 these objects are the\nreal trees used by Morgan and Shalen to describe the boundary points for the\nTeichmuller spaces. In the general case they are contractible metric spaces\nwith a structure of tropical projective spaces.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 1 figure; Changes in version 2: minor changes, some\n  references added.
