There is not a natural notion of\nrank-width for C-colored graphs. We define two notions of rank-width for them,\nboth based on a coding of C-colored graphs by edge-colored graphs where each\nedge has exactly one color from a field F and named respectively F-rank-width\nand F-bi-rank-width. The two notions are equivalent to clique-width.

A cubic-time algorithm to decide whether a\nF-colored graph has F-rank-width (resp. F-bi-rank-width) at most k, for fixed\nk, is also given.

As examples, we\napply our criterions to some non-trivially confluent settings such as classes\nof gradient systems with non-convex potentials or diffusions where the\nconfluence is generated by the diffusive component. We finally establish that\nthe weak confluence property is connected with an optimal transport problem. As\na main application, we apply our results to the optimization of the\nRichardson-Romberg extrapolation for the numerical approximation of the\ninvariant measure of the initial ergodic Brownian diffusion.\n","Comment: to appear in \"Annales de l'Institut Henri Poincar\\'e\""]}]

Developing model reduction methods for\ncomputational frameworks based on such methods seems however to be challenging.\nIndeed, most popular model reduction techniques are projection-based, and rely\non basis functions obtained from the compression of simulation snapshots. In a\ntraditional interface-fitted computational framework, the computation of such\nbasis functions is straightforward, primarily because the computational domain\ndoes not contain in this case a fictitious region. This is not the case however\nfor an embedded computational framework because the computational domain\ntypically contains in this case both real and ghost regions whose definitions\ncomplicate the collection and compression of simulation snapshots. The problem\nis exacerbated when the interface separating both regions evolves in time. This\npaper addresses this issue by formulating the snapshot compression problem as a\nweighted low-rank approximation problem where the binary weighting identifies\nthe evolving component of the individual simulation snapshots.

The IPN satellites provide accurate times of the bursts\nand sky localizations that vary significantly from degree scale to hundreds of\nsquare degrees. We search for both a well-modeled binary coalescence signal,\nthe favored progenitor model for short GRBs, and for generic, unmodeled\ngravitational wave bursts. Both searches use the event time and sky\nlocalization to improve the gravitational-wave search sensitivity as compared\nto corresponding all-time, all-sky searches. We find no evidence of a\ngravitational-wave signal associated with any of the IPN GRBs in the sample,\nnor do we find evidence for a population of weak gravitational-wave signals\nassociated with the GRBs. For all IPN-detected GRBs, for which a sufficient\nduration of quality gravitational-wave data is available, we place lower bounds\non the distance to the source in accordance with an optimistic assumption of\ngravitational-wave emission energy of $10^{-2}M_{\\odot}c^2$ at 150 Hz, and find\na median of 13 Mpc. For the 27 short-hard GRBs we place 90% confidence\nexclusion distances to two source models: a binary neutron star coalescence,\nwith a median distance of 12Mpc, or the coalescence of a neutron star and black\nhole, with a median distance of 22 Mpc. Finally, we combine this search with\npreviously published results to provide a population statement for GRB searches\nin first-generation LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave detectors, and a\nresulting examination of prospects for the advanced gravitational-wave\ndetectors.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables; for the science summary, see\n  http://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-IPNS56VSR123grb/index.php"]}]

We show that the quantum fidelity, defined as an\noverlap measurement between an arbitrary reference state and the iPEPS\ngroundstate of the system, can detect q-fold degenerate groundstates for the Zq\nbroken-symmetry phase. Accordingly, a multiple-bifurcation of the quantum\ngroundstate fidelity is shown to occur as the transverse magnetic field varies\nfrom the symmetry phase to the broken-symmetry phase, which means that a\nmultiple-bifurcation point corresponds to a critical point. A (dis-)continuous\nbehavior of quantum fidelity at phase transition points characterizes a\n(dis-)continuous phase transition. Similar to the characteristic behavior of\nthe quantum fidelity, the magnetizations, as order parameters, obtained from\nthe degenerate groundstates exhibit multiple bifurcation at critical points.\nEach order parameter is also explicitly demonstrated to transform under the\nsubgroup of the Zq symmetry group. We find that the q-state quantum Potts model\non the square lattice undergoes a discontinuous (first-order) phase transition\nfor q = 3 and q = 4, and a continuous phase transition for q = 2 (the 2D\nquantum transverse Ising model).\n","Comment: 7pages, 4figures"]}]

In particular, he observed that the argument does not rule out narrow\ntetraquarks associated with the leading-order connected diagrams; such\ntetraquarks would have a width scaling as $N_c^{-1}$. It is shown here,\nhowever, that while the standard analysis of tetraquarks does not rule them\nout, a more thorough analysis rules out quantum-number exotic tetraquarks\nassociated with the leading-order connected diagrams. This analysis is based\nentirely on conventional assumptions used in large $N_c$ physics applied to the\nanalytic properties of meson-meson scattering. Our result implies that one of\nthree possibilities must be true: i) quantum-number exotic tetraquarks do not\nexist at large $N_c$; ii) quantum-number exotic tetraquarks exist, but are\nassociated with subleading connected diagrams and have anomalously small widths\nthat scale as $N_c^{-2}$ or smaller; or iii) the conventional assumptions used\nin large $N_c$ analysis are inadequate.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 4 .eps figures"]}]

The standard solar model fails to predict the very low lithium\nabundance in the Sun, which is much lower than the proto-solar nebula. This Li\nproblem has been debated for decades, and it has been ascribed either to planet\nformation or to secular stellar depletion. In order to test the evolution of\nLi, it is important to find solar twins in a range of ages. Also, the study of\nstars similar to the Sun is relevant in relation to the signature of\nterrestrial planet formation around the Sun. [Methods]. We acquired\nhigh-resolution (R=110,000), high S/N (~300) ESO/VLT UVES spectra of several\nsolar twin candidates and the Sun (as reflected from the asteroid Juno). Among\nthe solar twin candidates we identify HIP 114328 as a solar twin and perform a\ndifferential line-by-line abundance analysis of this star relative to the Sun.\n[Results]. HIP 114328 has stellar parameters Teff = 5785+/-10 K, log g =\n4.38+/-0.03, [Fe/H] = -0.022+/-0.009, and a microturbulent velocity 0.05+/-0.03\nkm/s higher than solar. The differential analysis shows that this star is\nchemically very similar to the Sun. The refractory elements seem even slightly\nmore depleted than in the Sun, meaning that HIP 114328 may be as likely to form\nterrestrial planets as the Sun. HIP 114328 is about 2 Gyr older than the Sun,\nand is thus the second oldest solar twin analyzed at high precision. It has a\nLi abundance of A(Li)NLTE <= 0.46, which is about 4 times lower than in the Sun\n(A(Li)NLTE = 1.07 dex), but close to the oldest solar twin known, HIP 102152.\n[Conclusions]. Based on the lower abundances of refractory elements when\ncompared to other solar twins, HIP 114328 seems an excellent candidate to host\nrocky planets. The low Li abundance of this star is consistent with its old age\nand fits very well the emerging Li-age relation among solar twins of different\nages.\n","Comment: A&A Letters, in press"]}]

A high-level imperative network programming language, called ImpNet, is\npresented in this paper.

However, a number of experiments\nobserved an energy-dependent \\emph{\"large scale\"} anisotropy in the sidereal\ntime frame with an amplitude of about 10$^{-4}$ - 10$^{-3}$, revealing the\nexistence of two distinct broad regions: an excess distributed around\n40$^{\\circ}$ to 90$^{\\circ}$ in Right Ascension (commonly referred to as\n\"tail.in\" excess) and a deficit (the \"loss cone\") around 150$^{\\circ}$ to\n240$^{\\circ}$ in Right Ascension. In recent years the Milagro and ARGO-YBJ\ncollaborations reported the of a \"medium\" scale anisotropy inside the tail-in\nregion. The observation of such small features has been recently claimed by the\nIceCube experiment also in the Southern hemisphere. So far, no theory of cosmic\nrays in the Galaxy exists which is able to explain the origin of these\ndifferent anisotropies leaving the standard model of cosmic rays and that of\nthe galactic magnetic field unchanged at the same time.\n","Comment: 42 pages, updated version of the invited review in the book \"Homage\n  to the discovery of Cosmic Rays\", Nova Science Publishers, New York, 2013"]}]
