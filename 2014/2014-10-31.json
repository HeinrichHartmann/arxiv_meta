Some predictions are even in apparent conflict with observations\n(e.g. cuspy-cored halos and `missing satellite problem'). Therefore, it is\nimportant to consider different forms of CDM. We focus on dark matter comprised\nof ultralight bosons that form a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC), described by a\ncomplex scalar field, and solve the Klein-Gordon and Einstein field equations\nto evolve the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. We find, in addition to\nphases of radiation-, matter- and \\Lambda-domination, an earlier phase of\nscalar-field-domination. Moreover, while WIMP CDM is non-relativistic at all\ntimes after it decouples, BEC scalar field dark matter (SFDM) is relativistic\nat early times, evolving from stiff to radiation-like, before it becomes\nnon-relativistic (CDM-like) at late times.

In each round, every informed node sends the rumor to a\nrandom neighbor, and every uninformed node contacts a random neighbor and gets\nthe rumor from her if she knows it. We analyze this protocol on random\n$k$-trees, a class of power law graphs, which are small-world and have large\nclustering coefficients, built as follows: initially we have a $k$-clique. In\nevery step a new node is born, a random $k$-clique of the current graph is\nchosen, and the new node is joined to all nodes of the $k$-clique. When $k>1$\nis fixed, we show that if initially a random node is aware of the rumor, then\nwith probability $1-o(1)$ after $O\\left((\\log n)^{1+2/k}\\cdot\\log\\log n\\cdot\nf(n)\\right)$ rounds the rumor propagates to $n-o(n)$ nodes, where $n$ is the\nnumber of nodes and $f(n)$ is any slowly growing function.

Among the proposed methods, molecular\ncommunication via diffusion (MCvD) is particularly effective. One of the main\nchallenges in MCvD is the intersymbol interference (ISI), which inhibits\ncommunication at high data rates. Furthermore, at the nano scale, energy\nefficiency becomes an essential problem. Before addressing these problems, a\npre-determined threshold for the received signal must be calculated to make a\ndecision. In this paper, an analytical technique is proposed to determine the\noptimum threshold, whereas in the literature, these thresholds are generally\ncalculated empirically. Since the main goal of this paper is to build an MCvD\nsystem suitable for operating at high data rates without sacrificing quality,\nnew modulation and filtering techniques are proposed to decrease the effects of\nISI and enhance energy efficiency. As a transmitter-based solution, a\nmodulation technique for MCvD, molecular transition shift keying (MTSK), is\nproposed in order to increase the data rate via suppressing the ISI.\nFurthermore, for energy efficiency, a power adjustment technique that utilizes\nthe residual molecules is proposed. Finally, as a receiver-based solution, a\nnew energy efficient decision feedback filter (DFF) is proposed as a substitute\nfor the decoders such as minimum mean squared error (MMSE) and decision\nfeedback equalizer (DFE). The error performance of DFF and MMSE equalizers are\ncompared in terms of bit error rates, and it is concluded that DFF may be more\nadvantageous when energy efficiency is concerned, due to its lower\ncomputational complexity.\n"]}]

In order to determine the critical condition in which dust cooling\ninduces the formation of low-mass stars, we follow the thermal evolution of a\ncollapsing cloud by a one-zone semi-analytic collapse model. Earlier studies\nassume the dust amount in the local universe, where all refractory elements are\ndepleted onto grains, and/or assume the constant dust amount during gas\ncollapse.

We also follow accretion of heavy elements in the gas phase onto\ndust grains, i.e., grain growth, during gas contraction. We find that grain\ngrowth well alters the fragmentation property of the clouds, and that this\nstill does not approach to the value in the local universe.
