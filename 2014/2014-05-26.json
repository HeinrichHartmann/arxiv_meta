The loss per\ncycle is the largest at the end pancakes.

Indeed, the original version\nof Vigilant's countermeasure is actually broken, but not as much as Coron et\nal. thought it was. As a consequence, the repaired version they proposed can be\nsimplified. It can actually be simplified even further as two of the nine\nmodular verifications happen to be unnecessary.

In addition to small-world and scale-free properties, clustering is\nthe most common topological characteristic observed in many real networked\nsystems. In this paper, we report an extensive numerical study on the effects\nof clustering on the structural properties of complex networks. Strong\nclustering in heterogeneous networks induces the emergence of a core-periphery\norganization that has a critical effect on the percolation properties of the\nnetworks. We observe a novel double phase transition with an intermediate phase\nin which only the core of the network is percolated and a final phase in which\nthe periphery percolates regardless of the core. This result implies breaking\nof the same symmetry at two different values of the control parameter, in stark\ncontrast to the modern theory of continuous phase transitions.

False signals also depend\non the intensity ratio between the sources and are reduced for large ratio.

When the\nglobal solution is hard to attain, statisticians always use the better if there\nare two solutions for chosen, where the word \"better\" is understood in the\nsense of optimization. This seems reasonable in that the better solution is\nmore likely to be the global solution, whose statistical properties of interest\nusually have been well established. From the statistical perspective, we use\nthe better solution because we intuitively believe the principle, called better\nsolution principle (BSP) in this paper, that a better solution to a statistical\noptimization problem also has better statistical properties of interest. BSP\ndisplays some concordance between optimization and statistics, and is expected\nto widely hold. Since theoretical study on BSP seems to be neglected by\nstatisticians, this paper aims to establish a framework for discussing BSP in\nvarious statistical optimization problems. We demonstrate several simple but\neffective comparison theorems as the key results of this paper, and apply them\nto verify BSP in commonly encountered statistical optimization problems,\nincluding maximum likelihood estimation, best subsample selection, and best\nsubset regression. It can be seen that BSP for these problems holds under\nreasonable conditions, i.e., a better solution indeed has better statistical\nproperties of interest. In addition, guided by the BSP theory, we develop a new\nbest subsample selection method that performs well when there are clustered\noutliers.\n"]}]

The abstract notion of a \"pattern\"\nis introduced, which may be seen as an analogue of the space group of\nisometries preserving a tiling but where, instead, one considers partial\nisometries preserving portions of it. These inverse semigroups of partial\ntransformations are the suitable analogue of the space group for patterns with\nFLC but few global symmetries. In a similar vein we introduce the notion of a\n\\emph{collage}, a system of equivalence relations on the ambient space of a\npattern, which we show is capable of generalising many constructions applicable\nto the study of FLC tilings and Delone sets, such as the expression of the\ntiling space as an inverse limit of approximants.\n  An invariant is constructed for our abstract patterns, the so called\npattern-equivariant (PE) homology. These homology groups are defined using\ninfinite singular chains on the ambient space of the pattern, although we show\nthat one may define cellular versions which are isomorphic under suitable\nconditions. For FLC tilings these cellular PE chains are analogous to the PE\ncellular cochains \\cite{Sadun1}. The PE homology and cohomology groups are\nshown to be related through Poincar\\'{e} duality.\n  An efficient and highly geometric method for the computation of the PE\nhomology groups for hierarchical tilings is presented. The rotationally\ninvariant PE homology groups are shown not to be a topological invariant for\nthe associated tiling space and seem to retain extra information about global\nsymmetries of tilings in the tiling space.
