Traditionally, learning of the network structure has been done under\nthe assumption of chordality which ensures that efficient scoring methods can\nbe used. In general, non-chordal graphs have intractable normalizing constants\nwhich renders the calculation of Bayesian and other scores difficult beyond\nvery small-scale systems. Recently, there has been a surge of interest towards\nthe use of regularized pseudo-likelihood methods for structural learning of\nlarge-scale Markov network models, as such an approach avoids the assumption of\nchordality. The currently available methods typically necessitate the use of a\ntuning parameter to adapt the level of regularization for a particular dataset,\nwhich can be optimized for example by cross-validation.

We investigate analytically the interaction\nbetween such a skyrmion excitation and its small amplitude fluctuations, i.e.,\nthe magnons in a clean two-dimensional chiral magnet. The magnon spectrum is\nfound to include two magnon-skyrmion bound states corresponding to a breathing\nmode and, for intermediate fields, a quadrupolar mode, which will give rise to\nsubgap magnetic and electric resonances.

As a consequence of the skew scattering, a\nfinite density of skyrmions will generate a topological magnon Hall effect.\nUsing the conservation law for the energy-momentum tensor, we demonstrate that\nthe magnons also transfer momentum to the skyrmion.

We\nanalyze the assumption at the bases of their formulation and their claim that\nthis returns a lower limit for the local dark matter density, which is accurate\nwithin 20%. We find that the validity of their formulation depends on the\nunderlying mass distribution. We therefore analyze the predictions that their\nhypothesis casts on the radial gradient of the azimuthal velocity dV/dR and\ncompare it with observational data as a testbed for the validity of their\nformulation. We find that their hypothesis requires too steep a profile of\ndV(Z)/dR, which is inconsistent with the observational data both in the Milky\nWay and in external galaxies. As a consequence, their results are biased and\nlargely overestimate the mass density. Dynamical simulations also show that,\ncontrary to their claims, low values of dV/dR are compatible with a Milky Way\nlike potential with radially constant circular velocity. We nevertheless\nconfirm that, according to their criticism, our assumption dV/dR=0 is only an\napproximation. If this hypothesis is released, and the available information\nabout dV/dR in the thick disk is used, the resulting local dark matter density\nincreases by a tiny amount, from 0+-1 to 2+-3 mM_sun pc^(-3), with an upper\nlimit of ~3.5 mM_sun pc^(-3).

Both these enhanced [N/C] values\nand the C and N anomalies themselves are an obvious evidence of the presence on\na star's surface of mixed material from stellar interiors; so, a majority of\nprogramme stars passed through the deep mixing during the main sequence (MS)\nand/or the first dredge-up (FD) phase. Comparison with theoretical predictions\nincluding rotationally-induced mixing shows that the stars are either post-MS\nobjects with the initial rotational velocities V0 = 200-300 km/s or post-FD\nobjects with V0 = 0-300 km/s. The observed N vs. C anti-correlation reflects a\ndependence of the C and N anomalies on the V0 value: on average the higher V0\nthe greater the anomalies.
