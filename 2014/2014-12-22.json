Behavioural economists and psychologists, on the\nother hand, have demonstrated that humans consistently violate the EU postulate\nby switching from risk-averse to risk-taking behaviour. This paradox has led to\nthe development of descriptive theories of decisions, such as the celebrated\nprospect theory, which uses an $S$-shaped value function with concave and\nconvex branches explaining the observed asymmetry. Although successful in\nmodelling human behaviour, these theories appear to contradict the natural set\nof axioms behind the EU postulate.

Thus, unlike many\ndescriptive and `non-expected' utility theories that abandon the linearity\n(i.e. the `independence' axiom), we formulate a rigorous argument that the von\nNeumann and Morgenstern rational agents should be both risk-averse and\nrisk-taking if they are not indifferent to information.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 2 figures"]}]

In this paper we\nmake forecasts on its capability at observing or constraining the dark energy\nparameters and the primordial non-Gaussianity. From the LSS data one can use\nthe baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and the growth rate derived from the\nredshift space distortion (RSD) to measure the dark energy density and equation\nof state. The primordial non-Gaussianity can be constrained either by looking\nfor scale-dependent bias in the power spectrum, or by using the bispectrum.\nHere we consider three cases: the Tianlai cylinder array pathfinder which is\ncurrently being built, an upgrade of the pathfinder array with more receiver\nunits, and the full-scale Tianlai cylinder array. Using the full-scale Tianlai\nexperiment, we expect $\\sigma_{w_0} \\sim 0.082$ and $\\sigma_{w_a} \\sim 0.21$\nfrom the BAO and RSD measurements, $\\sigma_{\\rm f_{NL}}^{\\rm local} \\sim 14$\nfrom the power spectrum measurements with scale-dependent bias, and\n$\\sigma_{\\rm f_{NL}}^{\\rm local} \\sim 22$ and $\\sigma_{\\rm f_{NL}}^{\\rm equil}\n\\sim 157$ from the bispectrum measurements.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

When radial\nmigration is very efficient, a large fraction of disk stars experiences\nsignificant, permanent changes to their individual orbital angular momenta over\nthe lifetime of the disk, having strong implications for the evolution of disk\ngalaxies.

The Leggett-Garg (LG) inequality was derived to allow\nexperimental test of whether or not this doctrine is true; it is also often\nthought of as a temporal version of a Bell-inequality. Despite recent interest\nin the inequality, controversy remains regarding what would be shown by its\nviolation. Here we resolve this controversy, which arises due to an\ninsufficiently general and model-independent approach to the question so far.\nWe argue that LG's initial characterisation of MR does not pick out a\nparticularly natural realist position, so we articulate an operationally\nwell-defined and well-motivated position in its place. We show that much weaker\nconditions than LG's are sufficient to derive the inequality: in the first\ninstance, its violation only demonstrates that certain measurements fail to be\nnon-disturbing at the operational level. We articulate three distinct species\nof MR-ist position, and argue that it is only the first of these which can be\nrefuted by LG inequality violation. This first position is an attractive one,\nso ruling it out remains of interest, however. A crucial role is played in LG's\nargument by the assumption of noninvasive measurability. We show that this\nnotion is ambiguous between the weaker notion of disturbance at the operational\nlevel, and the stronger notion of invasiveness at the ontic level of properties\nof the system. Ontic noninvasiveness would be required to rule out MR per se\nbut this property is not entailed by MR, and its presence cannot be established\nin a model-independent way.

X-rays can penetrate much more\ndeeply than infrared light and could allow for nerve cell stimulation in any\npart of the brain.

The behaviour of the magnetic field is crucial not\nonly to integrate the disk instability model (Osaki 1974), but also to\ndetermine the cause and effect nexus among parameters affecting the behavior of\ncomplex systems. On the ground of our interpretation of the results emerging\nfrom the literature, we suggest that in models describing DNe outbursts, such\nas the disk instability model, the secondary instability model (Bath 1973) and\nthe thermonuclear runaway model (Mitrofanov 1978), the role of the magnetic\nfield is at least twofold. On the one hand, it activates a specific dynamic\npathway for the accreting matter by channelling it. On the other hand, it could\nbe indirectly responsible for switching a particular outburst modality. In\norder to represent these two roles of the magnetic field, we need to integrate\nthe disk instability model by looking at the global behaviour of the system\nunder analysis.

Weak free-free continuum emission in the centimeter\ndomain is associated with these jets.\n  Observations in the cm range are most useful to trace the base of the ionized\njets, close to the YSO and its accretion disk, where jets are accelerated and\ncollimated. Optical or near-IR images are obscured by the high extinction\npresent. Radio recombination lines in jets (in combination with proper motions)\nshould provide their 3D kinematics. SKA will be crucial to perform this kind of\nobservations.\n  Thermal radio jets are associated with both low and high mass protostars. The\nionizing mechanism appears to be related to shocks in the associated outflows,\nas suggested by the observed correlation between the centimeter luminosity and\nthe outflow momentum rate. From this correlation and that with the bolometric\nluminosity of the driving star it will be possible to discriminate with SKA\nbetween unresolved HII regions and jets, and to infer physical properties of\nthe embedded objects.\n  Some jets show indications of non-thermal emission (negative spectral\nindices) in their lobes. Linearly polarized synchrotron emission has been found\nin the lobes of the jet of HH 80-81, allowing us to measure the direction and\nintensity of the magnetic field, a clue ingredient in determining the jet\ncollimation and ejection mechanisms. As only a fraction of the emission is\npolarized, very sensitive observations such as those that will be feasible with\nSKA are required to perform these studies in other objects.\n  Jets are common in many kinds of astrophysical scenarios. Characterizing YSO\nradio jets, whose physical conditions can be reliably determined from their\nthermal emission, would be also useful in understanding acceleration and\ncollimation mechanisms in all kinds of astrophysical jets.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 3 figures, to be published in proceedings of \"Advancing\n  Astrophysics with the Square Kilometre Array\", PoS(AASKA14)121"]}]

The related studies also suggested an\ninteresting form of decoupling of the heavy Kaluza-Klein (KK) fermion states in\nthe warped 5D SM in the limit where the profile of the SM Higgs approaches the\nIR brane. We demonstrate that a similar phenomenon occurs when we include the\nmandatory KK excitations of the SM Higgs in loop diagrams giving dipole\noperators for SM fermions, where the earlier work only considered the SM Higgs\n(zero mode). In particular, in the limit of a quasi IR-localized SM Higgs, the\neffect from summing over KK Higgs modes is unsuppressed (yet finite), in\ncontrast to the naive expectation that KK Higgs modes decouple as their masses\nbecome large. In this case, a wide range of KK Higgs modes have\nquasi-degenerate masses and enhanced couplings to fermions relative to those of\nthe SM Higgs, which contribute to the above remarkable result. In addition, we\nfind that the total contribution from KK Higgs modes in general can be\ncomparable to that from the SM Higgs alone. It is also interesting that KK\nHiggs couplings to KK fermions of the same chirality as the corresponding SM\nmodes have an unsuppressed overall contribution, in contrast to the result from\nthe earlier studies involving the SM Higgs.
