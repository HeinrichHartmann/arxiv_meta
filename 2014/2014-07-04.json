In particular, a conjecture predicting\nan injective and surjective mapping $X = \\sigma(p^k)/p^k, Y = \\sigma(m^2)/m^2$\nbetween OPNs $N = {p^k}{m^2}$ (with Euler factor $p^k$) and rational points on\nthe hyperbolic arc $XY = 2$ with $1 < X < 1.25 < 1.6 < Y < 2$ and $2.85 < X + Y\n< 3$, is disproved.

From the\nlatter, we select other two subsamples: isolated centrals and bright field\ncentrals, both with the same magnitude limit. The stellar mass (Ms)\ndistributions of the field and group central galaxies are different, which\nexplains why in general the field central galaxies are mainly located in the\nblue cloud/star forming regions, whereas the group central galaxies are\nstrongly biased to the red sequence/passive regions. The isolated centrals\noccupy the same regions as the bright field centrals since both populations\nhave similar Ms distributions. At parity of Ms, the color and specific star\nformation rate (sSFR) distributions of the samples are similar, specially\nbetween field and group centrals. Furthermore, we find that the stellar-to-halo\nmass (Ms-Mh) relation of isolated galaxies does not depend on the color, sSFR\nand morphological type. For systems without satellites, the Ms-Mh relation\nsteepens at high halo masses compared to group centrals, which is a consequence\nof assuming a one-to-one relation between group total stellar mass and halo\nmass. Under the same assumption, the scatter around the Ms-Mh relation of\ncentrals with satellites increases with halo mass.

Two families of such spin-orbit\nresonances exist, alike in dignity but differentiated by whether the components\nof the two spins in the orbital plane are either aligned or antialigned. The\nfraction of binary black holes in each family is determined by the stellar\nevolution of their progenitors, so if gravitational-wave detectors could\nmeasure this fraction they could provide important insights into astrophysical\nformation scenarios for binary black holes. In this paper, we show that even\nunder the conservative assumption that binary black holes are observed along\nthe direction of $\\mathbf J$ (where precession-induced modulations to the\ngravitational waveforms are minimized), the waveforms of many members of each\nresonant family can be distinguished from all members of the opposing family in\nevents with signal-to-noise ratios $\\rho \\simeq 10$, typical of those expected\nfor the first detections with Advanced LIGO/Virgo.

We show that doped holes in\nvalence bands or electrons in conduction bands give rise to ferromagnetism at\nthe interfaces. The ferromagnetic states are ground states for both hole-doped\n(p-type) and electron-doped (n-type) interfaces by comparison with their\ncorresponding nonmagnetic and antiferromagnetic states. Carriers (holes or\nelectrons) concentrate near the interface to screen the polarization charge and\nthus the concentration of carrier varies with the ferroelectric polarization.\nFurthermore, the interface magnetization, which is nearly proportional to the\nconcentration of carrier, can be tuned by ferroelectric polarization reversal,\nleading to strong intrinsic magnetoelectric effects at the interface of\noriginally nonmagnetic KTaO3 and PbTiO3. Interestingly, a\nferromagnetic-nonmagnetic transition tuned by an applied electric field can be\nrealized at the p-type interface. This suggests an illuminating approach to\nmultiferroic materials beyond conventional single-phase multiferroics and\nmulti-phase multiferroics such as ferroelectric/ferromagnet heterostructures.\nThe KTaO3/PbTiO3 interfaces may be promising in future multiferroic devices\napplications.\n","Comment: 10 figures"]}]

The main weaknesses of existing\nalgorithms is that they assume either that the \\emph{average} probability of a\nnon-crashed processor returning incorrect results is inferior to $\\frac{1}{2}$,\nor that the probability of returning incorrect results is known to \\emph{each}\nprocessor.

In the first place, the algorithm maintains a\nstate of minimal partition size in the spanning tree due to edge deletion. This\nis realized by swapping peripheral edges, more precisely leaf edges, in most of\nedge exchange operations. Consequently, the main structure of the spanning\ntrees is preserved during the steps of the enumeration process. This extra\nconstraint proves to be advantageous in many applications where the partition\nsize is a factor in the solution cost. Secondly, we introduce, and utilize, the\nnew concept of edge promotion: the exchanged edges always share one end.\nPractically, and as a result of this property, the interface between the two\npartitions of the spanning tree during edge exchange has to be maintained from\none side only.\n  For a graph $G(V,E)$, MP algorithm requires $O(log V+E/V)$ expected time and\n$OV log V)$ worst case time for generating each spanning tree. MP algorithm\nrequires a total expected space limit of $O(E log V)$ with worst case limit of\n$O(EV)$.

A numerical solution to the PRISM integral equations is used to\ndetermine c0, by adjusting the value of the effective hard sphere diameter, d,\nto agree with the predicted equation of state. This single quantity\nparameterizes the coarse-grained potential, which is used to perform mesoscale\nsimulations that are directly compared with atomistic-level simulations of the\nsame system. We test our coarse-graining formalism by comparing structural\ncorrelations, isothermal compressibility, equation of state, Helmholtz and\nGibbs free energies, and potential energy and entropy using both united atom\nand coarse-grained descriptions.

An alternative is to use n-sorters,\ninstead of 2-sorters, as the basic building blocks so as to greatly reduce the\nnumber of sorters as well as the latency. Based on a modified Leighton's\ncolumnsort algorithm, an n-way merging algorithm, referred to as SS-Mk, that\nuses n-sorters as basic building blocks was proposed. In this work, we first\npropose a new multiway merging algorithm with n-sorters as basic building\nblocks that merges n sorted lists of m values each in 1 + ceil(m/2) stages (n\n<= m). Based on our merging algorithm, we also propose a sorting algorithm,\nwhich requires O(N log2 N) basic sorters to sort N inputs. While the asymptotic\ncomplexity (in terms of the required number of sorters) of our sorting\nalgorithm is the same as the SS-Mk, for wide ranges of N, our algorithm\nrequires fewer sorters than the SS-Mk.

To test the generality of our approach, we\nconsider Flickr metadata of more than 3.7M pictures in London and 1.3M in\nBoston, compute proxies for the crowdsourced beauty dimension (the one for\nwhich we have collected the most votes), and evaluate those proxies with 30\nparticipants in London and 54 in Boston. These participants have not only rated\nour recommendations but have also carefully motivated their choices, providing\ninsights for future work.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 7 figures, Proceedings of ACM Hypertext 2014"]}]

Focusing on the case of Slovenia, we study the dynamics of\ninterdisciplinary sciences from 1960 to 2010. Our approach relies on\nquantifying the interdisciplinarity of research communities detected in the\ncoauthorship network of Slovenian scientists over time. Examining the evolution\nof the community structure, we find that the frequency of interdisciplinary\nresearch is only proportional with the overall growth of the network. Although\nmarginal improvements in favor of interdisciplinarity are inferable during the\n70s and 80s, the overall trends during the past 20 years are constant and\nindicative of stalemate. We conclude that the flow of knowledge between\ndifferent fields of research in Slovenia is in need of further stimulation.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 4 figures; accepted for publication in PLoS ONE [related\n  work available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.4824 and\n  http://www.matjazperc.com/sicris/stats.html]"]}]

This makes active control\nparticularly challenging. Here, we show for aqueous electrolyte imbibition in\nnanoporous gold that the fluid flow can be reversibly switched on and off\nthrough electric potential control of the solid-liquid interfacial tension,\ni.e. we can accelerate the imbibition front, stop it, and have it proceed at\nwill. Simultaneous measurements of the mass flux and the electrical current\nallow us to document simple scaling laws for the imbibition kinetics, and to\nexplore the charge flow dynamics in the metallic nanopores.
