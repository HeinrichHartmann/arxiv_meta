In particular, we present a useful and powerful characterization of\nlinear trellis isomorphy. We also obtain a new proof of the Factorization\nTheorem of Koetter/Vardy and point out unnoticed problems for the group case.\n  Next, we apply our work to: describe all the elementary trellis\nfactorizations of linear trellises and consequently to determine all the\nminimal linear trellises for a given code; prove that nonmergeable one-to-one\nlinear trellises are strikingly determined by the edge-label sequences of\ncertain closed paths; prove self-duality theorems for minimal linear trellises;\nanalyze quasi-cyclic linear trellises and consequently extend results on\nreduced linear trellises to nonreduced ones. To achieve this, we also provide\nnew insight into mergeability and path connectivity properties of linear\ntrellises.\n  Our classification results are important for iterative decoding as we show\nthat minimal linear trellises can yield different pseudocodewords even if they\nhave the same graph structure.\n","Comment: 53 pages.

Enaction is considered a metaphor for artificial\nintelligence, as a number of the notions which it deals with are deemed\nincompatible with the phenomenal field of the virtual. After explaining this\nstance, we shall review previous works regarding this issue in terms of\nartifical life and robotics. We shall focus on the lack of recognition of\nco-evolution at the heart of these approaches. We propose to explicitly\nintegrate the evolution of the environment into our approach in order to refine\nthe ontogenesis of the artificial system, and to compare it with the enaction\nparadigm. The growing complexity of the ontogenetic mechanisms to be activated\ncan therefore be compensated by an interactive guidance system emanating from\nthe environment. This proposition does not however resolve that of the\nrelevance of the meaning created by the machine (sense-making). Such\nreflections lead us to integrate human interaction into this environment in\norder to construct relevant meaning in terms of participative artificial\nintelligence. This raises a number of questions with regards to setting up an\nenactive interaction. The article concludes by exploring a number of issues,\nthereby enabling us to associate current approaches with the principles of\nmorphogenesis, guidance, the phenomenology of interactions and the use of\nminimal enactive interfaces in setting up experiments which will deal with the\nproblem of artificial intelligence in a variety of enaction-based ways.\n"]}]

But this praxis has little philosophical\njustification, since there exist many notions of simplicity, and those that can\nbe defined precisely strongly depend on the language in which the theory is\nformulated. The language dependence is a natural feature - to some extent - but\nit is also believed to be a fatal problem, because, according to a common\ngeneral argument, the simplicity of a theory is always trivial in a suitably\nchosen language. But, this trivialization argument is typically either applied\nto toy-models of scientific theories or applied with little regard for the\nempirical content of the theory. This paper shows that the trivialization\nargument fails, when one considers realistic theories and requires their\nempirical content to be preserved. In fact, the concepts that enable a very\nsimple formulation, are not necessarily measurable, in general. Moreover, the\ninspection of a theory describing a chaotic billiard shows that precisely those\nconcepts that naturally make the theory extremely simple are provably not\nmeasurable. This suggests that - whenever a theory possesses sufficiently\ncomplex consequences - the constraint of measurability prevents too simple\nformulations in any language. This explains why the scientists often regard\ntheir assessments of simplicity as largely unambiguous. In order to reveal a\ncultural bias in the scientists' assessment, one should explicitly identify\ndifferent characterizations of simplicity of the assumptions that lead to\ndifferent theory selections. General arguments are not sufficient.\n"]}]

In\ncurrent practices of medical homes, a clinical-based prediction frame is\nrecommended because it can help match the portfolio capacity of PCMH teams with\nthe actual load generated by a set of patients. Without such balances in\nclinical supply and demand, issues such as excessive under and over utilization\nof physicians, long waiting time for receiving the appropriate treatment, and\nnon-continuity of care will eliminate many advantages of the medical home\nstrategy. In this paper, by extending the hierarchical generalized linear model\nto include multivariate responses, we develop a clinical workload prediction\nmodel for care portfolio demands in a Bayesian framework. The model allows for\nheterogeneous variances and unstructured covariance matrices for nested random\neffects that arise through complex hierarchical care systems. We show that\nusing a multivariate approach substantially enhances the precision of workload\npredictions at both primary and non-primary care levels. We also demonstrate\nthat care demands depend not only on patient demographics but also on other\nutilization factors, such as length of stay.
