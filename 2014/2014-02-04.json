First, the gas density\nnear the ionization front is 7x10^4 L_{i,45} r_{50}^{-2} cm^{-3}, where\nL_{i,45} is the ionizing luminosity in units of 10^45 erg/s and r_{50} is the\ndistance of the gas from the nucleus in units of 50 pc.

Yet, most of the photoionized gas in the Broad Line Region\n(BLR) follows Keplerian orbits, which suggests that the BLR originates from gas\nwith a large enough column for gravity to dominate. The photoionized surface\nlayer of the gas must develop a pressure gradient due to the incident radiation\nforce.

The gas is stratified, with a low-density\nhighly-ionized surface layer, a density rise inwards, and a uniform-density\ncooler inner region, where the gas pressure reaches the incident radiation\npressure. This radiation pressure confinement (RPC) of the photoionized layer\nleads to a universal ionization parameter $U\\sim 0.1$ in the inner photoionized\nlayer, independent of luminosity and distance. Thus, RPC appears to explain the\nuniversality of the BLR properties in AGN.

Nematic\norder breaks the discrete lattice rotational symmetry by making the $x$ and $y$\ndirections in the Fe plane non-equivalent. This can happen because of (i) a\ntetragonal to orthorhombic structural transition, (ii) a spontaneous breaking\nof an orbital symmetry, or (iii) a spontaneous development of an Ising-type\nspin-nematic order - a magnetic state that breaks rotational symmetry but\npreserves time-reversal symmetry. The Landau theory of phase transitions\ndictates that the development of one of these orders should immediately induce\nthe other two, making the origin of nematicity a physics realization of a\n\"chicken and egg problem\". The three scenarios are, however, quite different\nfrom a microscopic perspective. While in the structural scenario lattice\nvibrations (phonons) play the dominant role, in the other two scenarios\nelectronic correlations are responsible for the nematic order. In this review,\nwe argue that experimental and theoretical evidence strongly points to the\nelectronic rather than phononic mechanism, placing the nematic order in the\nclass of correlation-driven electronic instabilities, like superconductivity\nand density-wave transitions. We discuss different microscopic models for\nnematicity in the iron pnictides, and link nematicity to other ordered states\nof the global phase diagram of these materials -- magnetism and\nsuperconductivity. In the magnetic model nematic order pre-empts stripe-type\nmagnetic order, and the same interaction which favors nematicity also gives\nrise to an unconventional $s^{+-}$ superconductivity. In the charge/orbital\nmodel magnetism appears as a secondary effect of ferro-orbital order, and the\ninteraction which favors nematicity gives rise to a conventional $s^{++}$\nsuperconductivity.\n","Comment: 10-page review article; a revised version has been accepted for\n  publication in Nature Physics"]}]

Entity resolution-the data integration problem of performing\nnoisy joins on structured data-typically proceeds by first hashing each record\ninto zero or more blocks, scoring pairs of records that are co-blocked for\nsimilarity, and then matching pairs of sufficient similarity. In the most\ncommon case of matching two sources, it is often desirable for the final\nmatching to be one-to-one (a record may be matched with at most one other);\nmembers of the database and statistical record linkage communities accomplish\nsuch matchings in the final stage by weighted bipartite graph matching on\nsimilarity scores. Such matchings are intuitively appealing: they leverage a\nnatural global property of many real-world entity stores-that of being nearly\ndeduped-and are known to provide significant improvements to precision and\nrecall. Unfortunately unlike the bipartite case, exact max-weight matching on\nmulti-partite graphs is known to be NP-hard. Our two-fold algorithmic\ncontributions approximate multi-partite max-weight matching: our first\nalgorithm borrows optimization techniques common to Bayesian probabilistic\ninference; our second is a greedy approximation algorithm. In addition to a\ntheoretical guarantee on the latter, we present comparisons on a real-world ER\nproblem from Bing significantly larger than typically found in the literature,\npublication data, and on a series of synthetic problems. Our results quantify\nsignificant improvements due to exploiting multiple sources, which are made\npossible by global one-to-one constraints linking otherwise independent\nmatching sub-problems.

The main ingredient of this formalism is the dynamical formation of\nbound states with vanishing mass, which gives rise to effective vertices\ncontaining massless poles; these vertices, in turn, trigger the Schwinger\nmechanism, and allow for the gauge-invariant generation of an effective gluon\nmass. In this particular approach, the gluon mass is directly related to\nquantities that are intrinsic to the bound-state formation itself, such as the\n\"transition amplitude\" and the corresponding \"bound-state wave-function\".\nSpecifically, a set of powerful relations discussed in the text, allows one to\ndetermine the dynamical evolution of the gluon mass through a Bethe-Salpeter\nequation, which controls the dynamics of the relevant wave-function.

Second, the thesis introduces two\ndimensionality reduction steps, Random Projections, a known feature extraction\ntechnique based on the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, and a new method termed\nMass Transportation Distance (MTD) Feature Selection for discrete domains.\nThen, this thesis compares the performance of Random Projections with the k-NN\nclassifier against MTD Feature Selection and Random Forest, for predicting\nartery disease based on accuracy, the F-Measure, and area under the Receiver\nOperating Characteristic (ROC) curve.\n  The comparative results demonstrate that MTD Feature Selection with Random\nForest is vastly superior to Random Projections and k-NN. The Random Forest\nclassifier is able to obtain an accuracy of 0.6660 and an area under the ROC\ncurve of 0.8562 on the OHGS genetic dataset, when 3335 SNPs are selected by MTD\nFeature Selection for classification.
