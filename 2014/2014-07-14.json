This overall structure is in agreement with\nthat deduced from radio observations and optical interferometry at earlier\nepochs. We find that the asymmetry observed in the west lobe is an instrumental\neffect caused by the profile of the HST filter and hence demonstrate that this\nlobe is approaching the observer. We then conclude that the system has an\ninclination to the line of sight of 39$^{+1}_{-10}$ degrees. This is in\nagreement with the inclination of the binary orbit and lends support to the\nproposal that this morphology is due to the interaction of the outburst ejecta\nwith either an accretion disk around the central white dwarf and/or a\npre-existing red giant wind that is significantly denser in the equatorial\nregions of the binary than at the poles. The second epoch HST observation was\nalso modeled. However, as no spectra were taken at this epoch, it is more\ndifficult to constrain any model.

Prior\nempirical work on the diffusion of innovations in spatial regions or social\nnetworks has largely focused on the spread of one particular technology among a\nsubset of all potential adopters. It has also been difficult to determine\nwhether the observed collective behaviour is driven by natural influence\nprocesses, or whether it follows external signals such as media or marketing\ncampaigns. Here, we choose an online context that allows us to study social\ninfluence processes by tracking the popularity of a complete set of\napplications installed by the user population of a social networking site, thus\ncapturing the behaviour of all individuals who can influence each other in this\ncontext. By extending standard fluctuation scaling methods, we analyse the\ncollective behaviour induced by 100 million application installations, and show\nthat two distinct regimes of behaviour emerge in the system. Once applications\ncross a particular threshold of popularity, social influence processes induce\nhighly correlated adoption behaviour among the users, which propels some of the\napplications to extraordinary levels of popularity. Below this threshold, the\ncollective effect of social influence appears to vanish almost entirely in a\nmanner that has not been observed in the offline world.

Better physico-chemical understanding\nremains elusive because of the large number of variables involved, hence little\nguidance is available to systematically identify solution conditions that\npromote crystallization. To help determine relationships between macromolecular\nproperties and their crystallization propensity, we have trained statistical\nmodels on samples for 182 proteins supplied by the Northeast Structural\nGenomics consortium. Gaussian processes, which capture trends beyond the reach\nof linear statistical models, distinguish between two main physico-chemical\nmechanisms driving crystallization. One is characterized by low levels of side\nchain entropy and has been extensively reported in the literature. The other\nidentifies specific electrostatic interactions not previously described in the\ncrystallization context. Because evidence for two distinct mechanisms can be\ngleaned both from crystal contacts and from solution conditions leading to\nsuccessful crystallization, the model offers future avenues for optimizing\ncrystallization screens based on partial structural information. The\navailability of crystallization data coupled with structural outcomes analyzed\nthrough state-of-the-art statistical models may thus guide macromolecular\ncrystallization toward a more rational basis.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables.

Arguably the best process to study this coupling is the associa ted\nproduction of Higgs boson along with a $t\\bar t$ pair in a machine like the\nInternational Linear Collider (ILC). While detailed analyses of the sensitivity\nof the measurement assuming a Standard Model (SM) - like coupling are available\nin the context of ILC, conclude that th e coupling could be pinned down at\nabout 10\\% level with modest luminosity, our investigations show that the\nscenario could be different in case of a more general coupling. The modified\nLorentz structure resulting in a changed functional dependence of the cross\nsection on the couplin g, along with the difference in the cross section itself\nleads to considerable deviation in the sensitivity. Our studies with an ILC of\ncenter of mass energies of 500 GeV, 800 GeV and 1000 GeV show that moderate\nCP-mixing in the Higgs sector could change the sensitivity to about 20\\ %,\nwhile it could be worsened to 75\\% in cases which could accommodate more\ndramatic changes in the coupling. While detailed considerations of the decay\ndistributions point to a need for a relook at the analysis strategy followed\nfor the case of SM such as for a model independent analysis of the top quark\nYukawa coupling measurement. This study strongly suggests that, a joint\nanalysis of the CP properties and the Yukawa coupling measurement would be the\nway forward at the ILC and that caution must be excercised in the measurem ent\nof the Yukawa couplings and the conclusions drawn from it.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 7 figures, uses revtex"]}]

To make classification useful in practice, it is crucial\nto improve its accuracy while ensuring that it can run at big data scales. Many\napproaches use acoustic measures based on spectrogram-type data, such as the\nMel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features which represent a\nmanually-designed summary of spectral information. However, recent work in\nmachine learning has demonstrated that features learnt automatically from data\ncan often outperform manually-designed feature transforms.

In this work we introduce a technique for feature learning from\nlarge volumes of bird sound recordings, inspired by techniques that have proven\nuseful in other domains. We experimentally compare twelve different feature\nrepresentations derived from the Mel spectrum (of which six use this\ntechnique), using four large and diverse databases of bird vocalisations, with\na random forest classifier. We demonstrate that MFCCs are of limited power in\nthis context, leading to worse performance than the raw Mel spectral data.\nConversely, we demonstrate that unsupervised feature learning provides a\nsubstantial boost over MFCCs and Mel spectra without adding computational\ncomplexity after the model has been trained. The boost is particularly notable\nfor single-label classification tasks at large scale.

As the normal force between the surfaces increases,\nthe microscopic inclines would be compressed elastically. Consequently, the\ncoefficient of static friction does not remain constant but becomes smaller for\na larger normal force, since the load would then only need to be pushed over\nsmaller angles.

The relationship\nbetween the normal force and the common angle is therefore non-linear.

Under the assumption that frame\ncoefficients of images are sparse, several iterative thresholding algorithms\nfor the image inpainting problem have been proposed in the literature. The\noutputs of such iterative algorithms are closely linked to solutions of several\nconvex minimization models using the balanced approach which simultaneously\ncombines the $l_1$-regularization for sparsity of frame coefficients and the\n$l_2$-regularization for smoothness of the solution. Due to the redundancy of a\ntight frame, elements of a tight frame could be highly correlated and\ntherefore, their corresponding frame coefficients of an image are expected to\nclose to each other. This is called the grouping effect in statistics. In this\npaper, we establish the grouping effect property for frame-based convex\nminimization models using the balanced approach. This result on grouping effect\npartially explains the effectiveness of models using the balanced approach for\nseveral image restoration problems. Inspired by recent development on\ndirectional tensor product complex tight framelets (TP-CTFs) and their\nimpressive performance for the image denoising problem, in this paper we\npropose an iterative thresholding algorithm using a single tight frame derived\nfrom TP-CTFs for the image inpainting problem. Experimental results show that\nour proposed algorithm can handle well both cartoons and textures\nsimultaneously and performs comparably and often better than several well-known\nframe-based iterative thresholding algorithms for the image inpainting problem\nwithout noise. For the image inpainting problem with additive zero-mean i.i.d.\nGaussian noise, our proposed algorithm using TP-CTFs performs superior than\nother known state-of-the-art frame-based image inpainting algorithms.\n"]}]
