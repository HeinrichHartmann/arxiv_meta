One of the particularities of\nthis work lies in the fact that the CSI is distributed in the sense that each\nTX obtains its own estimate of the global multi-user MIMO channel with no\nfurther exchange of information being allowed between the TXs. Although this is\nwell suited to model the cooperation between non-colocated TXs, e.g., in\ncellular Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP) schemes, this type of setting has\nreceived little attention so far in the information theoretic society. We study\nin this work what are the CSI requirements at every TX, as a function of the\nnetwork geometry, to ensure that the maximal number of degrees-of-freedom (DoF)\nis achieved, i.e., the same DoF as obtained under perfect CSI at all TXs. We\nadvocate the use of the generalized DoF to take into account the geometry of\nthe network in the analysis. Consistent with the intuition, the derived DoF\nmaximizing CSI allocation policy suggests that TX cooperation should be limited\nto a specific finite neighborhood around each TX. This is in sharp contrast\nwith the conventional (uniform) CSI dissemination policy which induces CSI\nrequirements that grow unbounded with the network size. The proposed CSI\nallocation policy suggests an alternative to clustering which overcomes\nfundamental limitations such as (i) edge interference and (ii) unbounded\nincrease of the CSIT requirements with the cluster size.

We\nsuggest that a fast radio burst represents the final signal of a supramassive\nrotating neutron star that collapses to a black hole due to magnetic braking.\nThe neutron star is initially above the critical mass for non-rotating models\nand is supported by rapid rotation. As magnetic braking constantly reduces the\nspin, the neutron star will suddenly collapse to a black hole several thousand\nto million years after its birth. We discuss several formation scenarios for\nsupramassive neutron stars and estimate the possible observational signatures\n{making use of the results of recent numerical general-relativistic\ncalculations. While the collapse will hide the stellar surface behind an event\nhorizon, the magnetic-field lines will snap violently.

In\nthis paper, we study strategies to achieve fast rendezvous for two secondary\nusers.\n  The channel availability for secondary nodes is subject to temporal and\nspatial variation. Moreover, in a distributed system, one user is oblivious of\nthe other user's channel status.

Objectives: To examine the effect of ELF-MFs on cancer cells.\nMethods: Five cancer cell lines were exposed to ELF-MFs within the range of\n0.025-5 microTesla, and the cells were examined for karyotype changes after 6\ndays. Results: All cancer cells lines lost chromosomes from MF exposure, with a\nmostly flat dose-response. Constant MF exposures for three weeks allow a rising\nreturn to the baseline, unperturbed karyotypes.

Joomla is a very popular Content Management System\n(CMS) used for web page maintenance. This highly versatile software has found\nitself in both large corporate web portals, and simple web pages such as blogs.\nSuch popularity increases its vulnerability to potential attacks and therefore\nneeds an appropriate security management. ISO (the International Organization\nfor Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical Commission)\ncreated the series of standards aimed at providing a model for establishing,\nimplementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and improving an\nInformation Security Management System (ISMS). This paper shows how principles\nset in ISO/IEC 27000 series of standards can be used to improve security of\nJoomla based web portals.\n","Comment: Proceedings of the 15th International Research/Expert Conference\n  \"Trends in the Development of Machinery and Associated Technology\" TMT 2011,\n  (S.
