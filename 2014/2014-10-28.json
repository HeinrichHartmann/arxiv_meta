We do this for a variety\nof topologically-ordered systems such as the toric code, double semion, color\ncode, and quantum double models. As happens for the entanglement entropy, we\nfind that for sufficiently large block sizes the geometric entanglement is, up\nto possible sub-leading corrections, the sum of two contributions: a bulk\ncontribution obeying a boundary law times the number of blocks, and a\ncontribution quantifying the underlying pattern of long-range entanglement of\nthe topologically-ordered state. This topological contribution is also present\nin the case of single-spin blocks in most cases, and constitutes an alternative\ncharacterisation of topological order for these quantum states based on a\nmultipartite entanglement measure.

Additionally, we sift the outcome of the 3-3-1-1 model from precise\nelectroweak bounds to dark matter observables. The mass spectra of the scalar\nand gauge sectors are diagonalized when the scale of the 3-3-1-1 breaking is\ncompatible to that of the ordinary 3-3-1 breaking. All the interactions of the\ngauge bosons with the fermions and scalars are obtained. The 3-3-1-1 model\nprovides two dark matters which are stabilized by the W-parity conservation:\none fermion which may be either a Majorana or Dirac fermion and one complex\nscalar. We conclude that in the fermion dark matter setup the Z_2 gauge boson\nresonance sets the dark matter observables, whereas in the scalar one the Higgs\nportal dictates them.

Since the\ntotal energy is not conserved in the driven system, the continuity equation\nincludes the source terms which are shown to represent the Joule heating\neffects. For short times and weak drivings the energy current agrees with the\nlinear response theory. For stronger fields or longer times of driving the\nsystem enters the quasiequilibrium regime when the energy current gradually\ndiminishes due to the heating effects. Finally, for even stronger driving the\nenergy current is shown to undergo a damped Bloch oscillations. The energy\nspread also increases upon driving. However, the time--dependence of this\nquantity in the low field regime is quite unexpected since it is determined\nmostly by the time of driving being quite independent of the instantaneous\nenergy of the system.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 2 figures, Proc.

Fault-tolerance\ntypically has a high deployment cost -- special hardware might be required to\nimplement it -- and provides weak statistical guarantees. It is also based on\nthe assumption that faults are rare. In this paper, we consider scenarios where\nsecurity, rather than functional correctness, is the main asset to be\nprotected. Our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we develop a theory for\nexpressing confidentiality of data in the presence of transient faults. We show\nthat the natural probabilistic definition of security in the presence of faults\ncan be captured by a possibilistic definition. Furthermore, the possibilistic\ndefinition is implied by a known bisimulation-based property, called Strong\nSecurity. Secondly, we illustrate the utility of these results for a simple\nRISC architecture for which only the code memory and program counter are\nassumed fault-tolerant. We present a type-directed compilation scheme that\nproduces RISC code from a higher-level language for which Strong Security holds\n--- i.e. well-typed programs compile to RISC code which is secure despite\ntransient faults.

The algorithm under study consists of two steps: a\nlocal stochastic approximation step and a diffusion step which drives the\nnetwork to a consensus. The diffusion step uses row-stochastic matrices to\nweight the network exchanges. As opposed to previous works, exchange matrices\nare not supposed to be doubly stochastic, and may also depend on the past\nestimate.\n  We prove that non-doubly stochastic matrices generally influence the limit\npoints of the algorithm. Nevertheless, the limit points are not affected by the\nchoice of the matrices provided that the latter are doubly-stochastic in\nexpectation. This conclusion legitimates the use of broadcast-like diffusion\nprotocols, which are easier to implement.

Central point of the model implies the occurrence of unconventional\non-site quantum superpositions of the three valent states characterized by\ndifferent hole occupation, $n_h$=0,1,2, conventional spin s=1/2 for Cu$^{2+}$\nand s=0 for Cu$^{1+,3+}$ centers, and different orbital symmetry:$B_{1g}$ for\nthe ground states of the Cu$^{2+}$ center and $A_{1g}$ for the Cu$^{1+,3+}$\ncenters, respectively. The latter does result in a spontaneous orbital symmetry\nbreaking with emergence of the IUC orbital nematic order parameter of the\n$B_{1g}\\propto d_{x2-y2}$ symmetry. To describe the quantum local charge order\nwe develop an S=1 pseudospin model. Conventional spin density $\\rho_s$ for\nmixed valence superpositions can vary inbetween 0 and 1 in accordance with the\nweight of the Cu$^{2+}$ center in the superposition. We show that the\nsuperconductivity and spin magnetism are nonsymbiotic phenomena with competing\norder parameters.

The research also\ncomprises a multivariate detection of the transition probabilities changes at\ncertain sensitivity level in the multidimensional process. Additionally, the\nobservation of the random vector is depicted. Each chosen coordinate forms the\nMarkov process with different transition probabilities before and after some\nunknown moment. The aim of statisticians is to estimate the moments based on\nthe observation of the process. The Bayesian approach is used with the risk\nfunction depending on measure of chance of a false alarm and some cost of\noverestimation. The moment of the system's disorder is determined by the\ndetection of transition probabilities changes at some coordinates. The overall\nmodeling of the critical coordinates is based on the simple game.\n","Comment: 8. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1111.4504,\n  arXiv:1304.6986"]}]

Our main result takes advantage of this\nenlargement of the test functions, and provides an easier proof of comparison.\nThis is most remarkable in the context of the linear path-dependent heat\nequation. As a key ingredient for our methodology, we introduce a notion of\npunctual differentiation, similar to the corresponding concept in the standard\nviscosity solutions \\cite{CaffarelliCabre}, and we prove that semimartingales\nare almost everywhere punctually differentiable. This smoothness result can be\nviewed as the counterpart of the Aleksandroff smoothness result for convex\nfunctions. A similar comparison result was established earlier in \\cite{EKTZ}.\nThe result of this paper is more general and, more importantly, the arguments\nthat we develop do not rely on any representation of the solution.\n"]}]

During the first\nstage, engulfment is relatively slow and progressively slows down as\nphagocytosis proceeds. However, at approximately half-engulfment, the rate of\nengulfment increases dramatically, with complete engulfment attained soon\nafterwards. By studying simple mathematical models of phagocytosis, we suggest\nthat the first stage is due to a passive mechanism, determined by receptor\ndiffusion and capture, whereas the second stage is more actively controlled,\nperhaps with receptors being driven towards the site of engulfment. We then\nconsider a more advanced model that includes signaling and captures both stages\nof engulfment. This model predicts that there is an optimum ligand density for\nquick engulfment.

Variable selection is of critical importance in many\napplications, such as micro-array data analysis, where selecting a small number\nof discriminative features is crucial to developing useful models of disease\nmechanisms, as well as for prioritizing targets for drug discovery. The\nrecently proposed Minimal Complexity Machine (MCM) provides a way to learn a\nhyperplane classifier by minimizing an exact (\\boldmath{$\\Theta$}) bound on its\nVC dimension. It is well known that a lower VC dimension contributes to good\ngeneralization. For a linear hyperplane classifier in the input space, the VC\ndimension is upper bounded by the number of features; hence, a linear\nclassifier with a small VC dimension is parsimonious in the set of features it\nemploys. In this paper, we use the linear MCM to learn a classifier in which a\nlarge number of weights are zero; features with non-zero weights are the ones\nthat are chosen. Selected features are used to learn a kernel SVM classifier.\nOn a number of benchmark datasets, the features chosen by the linear MCM yield\ncomparable or better test set accuracy than when methods such as ReliefF and\nFCBF are used for the task. The linear MCM typically chooses one-tenth the\nnumber of attributes chosen by the other methods; on some very high dimensional\ndatasets, the MCM chooses about $0.6\\%$ of the features; in comparison, ReliefF\nand FCBF choose 70 to 140 times more features, thus demonstrating that\nminimizing the VC dimension may provide a new, and very effective route for\nfeature selection and for learning sparse representations.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1410.4573"]}]
