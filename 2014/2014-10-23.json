We have analyzed a large, astrophysically\nmotivated source population using real-time detection and sky localization\ncodes and higher-latency parameter estimation codes that have been expressly\nbuilt for operation in the Advanced LIGO/Virgo era. We show that for most BNS\nevents the rapid sky localization, available about a minute after a detection,\nis as accurate as the full parameter estimation. We demonstrate that Advanced\nVirgo will play an important role in sky localization, even though it is\nanticipated to come online with only one-third as much sensitivity as the\nAdvanced LIGO detectors. We find that the median 90% confidence region shrinks\nfrom ~500 square degrees in 2015 to ~200 square degrees in 2016. A few distinct\nscenarios for the first LIGO/Virgo detections emerge from our simulations.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables.

After introducing a lattice\nregularization, I solve the ansatz in order to obtain a set of concrete\nquasiparticle operators. In less than three space dimensions, they display the\nprecise anyonic features of the low-lying excitations of the fractional quantum\nHall fluids at general filling fractions with odd denominator. If the\nsingle-particle labels (\\alpha) include non-Abelian quantum numbers, then the\nansatz fractionalizes the electric charge of the fermions, but not their\nnon-Abelian charges. Charge breakup processes at the interface between a normal\nand a fractionalizing medium must be conserving processes for all the\nsymmetries of the system. The lattice-regularized ansatz can be modified in a\nnatural way to enforce this requirement. There always exists a local\ntransformation that maps the (C) quasiparticles into a new set of\nquasiparticles carrying definite values of both fractionalized electric and\nnon-fractionalized non-Abelian charges. To provide an application I study\nnumerically the zero-energy modes that emerge at the interface between a\none-dimensional electronic and a fractional topological superconductor.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 1 figure, submitted to PRB"]}]

Robust decompositions have\nshown to be good at splitting a corrupted matrix into an uncorrupted low-rank\nmatrix and a sparse matrix, containing outliers. However, this process only\nworks when matrices have relatively low rank with respect to their ambient\nspace, a property not met in motion estimation problems. As a solution, we\npropose to exploit the partial information present in the decomposition to\ndecide which matches are outliers. We provide evidences showing that even when\nit is not possible to recover an uncorrupted low-rank matrix, the resulting\ninformation can be exploited for outlier detection. To this end we propose the\nRobust Decomposition with Constrained Rank (RD-CR), a proximal gradient based\nmethod that enforces the rank constraints inherent to motion estimation. We\nalso present a general framework to perform robust estimation for stereo Visual\nOdometry, based on our RD-CR and a simple but effective compressed optimization\nmethod that achieves high performance.
