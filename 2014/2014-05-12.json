However, most studies assume\none combination of histone modification invariantly translates to one\ntranscriptional output regardless of local chromatin environment. In this study\nwe hypothesize that, the genome is organized into local domains that manifest\nsimilar enrichment pattern of histone modification, which leads to orchestrated\nregulation of expression of genes with relevant bio- logical functions. We\npropose a multivariate Bayesian Change Point (BCP) model to segment the\nDrosophila melanogaster genome into consecutive blocks on the basis of\ncombinatorial patterns of histone marks. By modeling the sparse distribution of\nhistone marks across the chromosome with a zero-inflated Gaussian mixture, our\npartitions capture local BLOCKs that manifest relatively homogeneous enrichment\npattern of histone modifications. We further characterized BLOCKs by their\ntranscription levels, distribution of genes, degree of co-regulation and GO\nenrichment. Our results demonstrate that these BLOCKs, although inferred merely\nfrom histone modifications, reveal strong relevance with physical domains,\nwhich suggest their important roles in chromatin organization and coordinated\ngene regulation.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 6 figures"]}]

Hi-C\nobserved an active region on 11 July 2012, which exhibits several interesting\nfeatures in the EUV line at 193\\AA: one of them is the existence of short,\nsmall brightenings ``sparkling\" at the edge of the active region; we call these\nEUV Bright Dots (EBDs).

These brightenings are not fully\nresolved by the SDO/AIA instrument at the same wavelength, however, they can be\nidentified with respect to the Hi-C location of the EBDs. In addition, EBDs are\nseen in other chromospheric/coronal channels of SDO/AIA suggesting a\ntemperature between 0.5 and 1.5 MK. Based on their frequency in the Hi-C time\nseries, we define four different categories of EBDs: single peak, double peak,\nlong duration, and bursty EBDs.

We used our MUESLI code to calculate GC\nsurvival rates for typical early-type galaxy potentials covering a wide range\nof observed galaxy properties. We do this for isotropic and radially\nanisotropic GC velocity distributions. We find that the calculated GC survival\nfraction, f_s, depends linearly on the logarithm of the 3D mass density,\nrho_3D, within the galaxy's half light radius, with f_s proportional to\n(rho_3D)^(-0.17). For a given galaxy, survival rates are lower for radially\nanisotropic configurations than for the isotropic GC cases. We apply these\nrelations to a literature sample of 219 early-type galaxies from Harris et al.\n(2013) in the range M_V=[-24.5:-15.5] mag. The expected GC survival fraction\nranges from ~50% for the most massive galaxies with the largest radii to ~10%\nfor the most compact galaxies. We find that intermediate luminosity galaxies\nM_V=[-20.5:-17.5] mag have the strongest expected GC erosion. Within the\nconsidered literature sample, the predicted GC survival fraction therefore\ndefines a u-shaped relation with M_V, similar to the relation between specific\nfrequency S_N and M_V. As a consequence, the u-shape of S_N vs. M_V gets erased\nalmost entirely when correcting the S_N values for the effect of GC erosion. We\nconclude that tidal erosion is an important contributor to the u-shaped\nrelation between GC specific frequency and host galaxy luminosity.

This paper initiates a study of\ncompletely transitive designs $\\mathcal{D}$. A classification is given of all\nexamples for which the automorphism group is not primitive on $X$. In the\nprimitive case the focus is on examples with the property that any two distinct\n$k$-subsets in $\\mathcal{D}$ have at most $k-3$ points in common. Here a\nreduction is given to the case where the automorphism group is $2$-transitive\non $X$. New constructions are given by classifying all examples for some\nfamilies of $2$-transitive groups, leaving several unresolved cases.\n","Comment: This manuscript dates from 1997 and is unpublished.

Sensitivity studies have been produced for the use of\ndisplaced-beam scintillometers over flat terrain. Many real field sites feature\nvariable topography. We develop here an analysis of the sensitivity of\ndisplaced-beam scintillometer derived sensible heat fluxes to uncertainties in\nspacially distributed topographic measurements. Sensitivity is shown to be\nconcentrated in areas near the center of the beam and where the underlying\ntopography is closest to the beam height. Uncertainty may be decreased by\ntaking precise topographic measurements in these areas.\n","Comment: To be submitted to Boundary Layer Meteorology"]}]

We present a framework for jointly tracking a\nset of features, which enables sharing information between the different\nfeatures in the scene. We show that our method can be employed to track\nfeatures for both rigid and nonrigid motions (possibly of few moving bodies)\neven when some features are occluded. Furthermore, it can be used to\nsignificantly improve tracking results in poorly-lit scenes (where there is a\nmix of good and bad features).

The QMF consists of\na 4-dimensional space-time manifold equipped with a one-parameter family of\nLorentzian 4-metrics parameterized by a (unique) global time function.\nEquivalently the QMF may be described as a 4-dimensional submanifold of a\n5-dimensional product manifold equipped with a degenerate metric, where the\nglobal time function represents one extra degenerate time dimension. A\nsymmetric and linear connection compatible with the non-degenerate piece of the\ndegenerate metric is defined, yielding equations of motion. These equations are\nidentical to the geodesic equation obtained from the connection. The role of\nthe degenerate dimension is to describe global scale changes between\ngravitational and non-gravitational systems. In particular this yields an\nalternative description of the expansion of the Universe. In this thesis a\nquasi-metric theory of gravity is constructed. The field equations have only\none dynamical degree of freedom coupled explicitly to matter, but there is also\na second, implicit dynamical degree of freedom. The existence of an implicit\ncoupling makes the field equations unsuitable for a standard PPN-analysis. This\nimplies that the experimental status of the theory is not completely clear at\nthis point in time. But the non-metric part of the theory may be tested rather\nindependently. That is, the theory predicts that vacuum gravitational fields\nand gravitationally bound bodies made of ideal gas expand like the expansion of\nthe Universe.

It is required that the gravitational field is\n\"metrically static\", meaning that it is static except for the effects of the\nglobal cosmic expansion on the spatial geometry. Dynamical equations for the\ngravitational field are set up and an exact solution is found for the exterior\npart. Besides, equations of motion applying to inertial test particles moving\nin the exterior gravitational field are set up. By construction the\ngravitational field of the system is not static with respect to the cosmic\nexpansion. This means that the radius of the source increases and that\ndistances between circular orbits of inertial test particles increase according\nto the Hubble law. Moreover it is shown that if this model of an expanding\ngravitational field is taken to represent the gravitational field of the Sun\n(or isolated planetary systems), this has no serious consequences for\nobservational aspects of planetary motion. On the contrary some observational\nfacts of the Earth-Moon system are naturally explained within the QMF.
