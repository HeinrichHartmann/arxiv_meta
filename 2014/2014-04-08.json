As a\nfunction of the frequency-dependent Hawking radiation intensity, we analyze the\ndegree of CS violation and the maximum violation temperature for a double\nbarrier structure separating two regions of subsonic and supersonic condensate\nflow. We also consider the case where the resonant sonic horizon is produced by\na space-dependent contact interaction. In some cases, CS violation can be\nobserved by direct atom counting in a time-of-flight experiment.

At the triple point where solid, liquid, and vapor phases meet we\nfind that the external force applied on the beam is parallel to the\nliquid-vapor interface. Moreover, in the case where solid-vapor and\nsolid-liquid interface energies do not depend on the extension state of the\nbeam, we show that the extension in the beam is continuous at the triple point\nand that the wetting angle satisfy the classical Young-Dupr\\'e relation.\n"]}]

In\nparticular, it is difficult to define a \"local\" region in a manifoldlike causal\nset, i.e., one that corresponds to an approximately flat spacetime region.\nFollowing up on suggestions from previous work, we bridge this lacuna by\nproposing a definition of locality based on the abundance of m-element\norder-intervals as a function of m in a causal set. We obtain analytic\nexpressions for the expectation value of this function for an ensemble of\ncausal set that faithfully embeds into an Alexandrov interval in d-dimensional\nMinkowski spacetime and use it to define local regions in a manifoldlike causal\nset. We use this to argue that evidence of local regions is a necessary\ncondition for manifoldlikeness in a causal set. This in addition provides a new\ncontinuum dimension estimator.

We show that\nif an asymptotically flat 3-manifold (M,g) of nonnegative scalar curvature\ncontains a non-compact, properly embedded minimal surface which is stable and\nhas quadratic area growth, then it is isometric to the flat R^{3}. This\nimplies, for instance, that in presence of a positive ADM mass any sequence of\nsolutions to the Plateau problem with diverging boundaries can never have\nuniform height bounds, even at a single point. The proof of this theorem is\nbased on a characterization of finite index minimal surfaces, on classical\ninfinitesimal rigidity results by Fischer-Colbrie and Schoen and on the\npositive mass theorem by Schoen-Yau. More specifically, we also show that a\ncomplete minimal surface of finite index inside an asymptotically flat\n3-manifold has finitely many ends and each of these is a graph of a function\nthat has a suitable expansion at infinity, in analogy with a classical result\nby Schoen for Euclidean spaces. In addition, we prove that a non-compact stable\nMOTS in an initial data set (M,g,k) is conformally diffeomorphic to either the\nplane C or to the cylinder A and in the latter case infinitesimal rigidity\nholds. If the data have harmonic asymptotics, the former case is also proven to\nbe globally rigid in the sense that the presence of a stable MOTS forces an\nisometric embedding of (M,g,k) in the Minkowski space-time (\\mathbb{M},\\eta) as\na space-like slice.\n","Comment: Sharper and more general results are proven in arXiv:1403.6459 (for\n  minimal hypersurfaces) and in arXiv:1404.0358 (for marginally trapped\n  surfaces), both by the same author"]}]

Further investigation of\nthe algorithm showed that it had three serious drawbacks, which prevented its\nuse by practitioners: it is difficult to understand, it has large memory\nrequirements, and it is slow. This paper presents an alternate formulation of\nSSS*, in which it is implemented as a series of Alpha-Beta calls that use a\ntransposition table (AB- SSS*). The reformulation solves all three perceived\ndrawbacks of SSS*, making it a practical algorithm. Further, because the search\nis now based on Alpha-Beta, the extensive research on minimax search\nenhancements can be easily integrated into AB-SSS*. To test AB-SSS* in\npractise, it has been implemented in three state-of-the- art programs: for\ncheckers, Othello and chess. AB-SSS* is comparable in performance to Alpha-Beta\non leaf node count in all three games, making it a viable alternative to\nAlpha-Beta in practise. Whereas SSS* has usually been regarded as being\nentirely different from Alpha-Beta, it turns out to be just an Alpha-Beta\nenhancement, like null-window searching. This runs counter to published\nsimulation results.

For three games (chess, Othello\nand checkers) we compute the size of the minimal tree and the minimal graph.\nEmpirical evidence shows that in all three games, enhanced Alpha-Beta search is\ncapable of building a tree that is close in size to that of the minimal graph.\nHence, it appears game-playing programs build nearly optimal search trees.\nHowever, the conventional definition of the minimal graph is wrong.

These unique\nproperties often originate primarily from the quantum confinement of free\nelectrons in a potential well, while electron-electron interactions do not play\na decisive role. A recent experimental study shows that self-assembled Ir\nnanowires grown on Ge(001) surface have a strong length preference: the\nnanowire lengths are an integer multiple of 4.8 nm. In this paper, a free\nelectron-gas model for geometries corresponding to the nanowires is used to\nanalyze the selection of these preferred or magic lengths. The model shows that\nthe inclusion of even numbers of free electrons in an Ir nanowire corresponds\nto these magic lengths once an electron spillage effect is taken into account.\nThe model also shows that the stability of the nanowire diminishes with its\nincreasing length, and consequently suggests why no long nanowires are observed\nin experiments. It is also shown that applying generic results for quantum size\neffects in a nanofilm geometry is not adequate to accurately describe the\nlength selection in the rather different nanowire geometry, where the\ntransverse dimensions smaller than the electron Fermi wavelength.

An application of this results is to revisit the classical backward\noptimization problem in the light of progressive utility theory, emphasizing\nintertemporal-consistency issue. Then we study the dynamics of the marginal\nutility yield curve, and give example with backward and progressive power\nutilities.\n"]}]

Many of the tools\nnecessary to make this information system a reality will require much more than\nindexing and will instead depend on community input paired with machine\nlearning, where mathematicians' expertise can fill the gaps of automatization.\nThis report proposes the establishment of an organization; the development of a\nset of platforms, tools, and services; the deployment of an ongoing applied\nresearch program to complement the development work; and the mobilization and\ncoordination of the mathematical community to take the first steps toward these\ncapabilities. The report recommends building on the extensive work done by many\ndedicated individuals under the rubric of the World Digital Mathematical\nLibrary, as well as many other community initiatives. Developing a 21st Century\nGlobal Library for Mathematics envisions a combination of machine learning\nmethods and community-based editorial effort that makes a significantly greater\nportion of the information and knowledge in the global mathematical corpus\navailable to researchers as linked open data through a central organizational\nentity-referred to in the report as the Digital Mathematics Library. This\nreport describes how such a library might operate - discussing development and\nresearch needs, role in facilitating discover and interaction, and establishing\npartnerships with publishers.\n"]}]
