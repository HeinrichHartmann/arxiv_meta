We address the question of revenue\nmaximization in the simplest possible multi-item setting: two items and a\nsingle buyer who has independently distributed values for the items, and an\nadditive valuation. In general, the revenue achievable from selling two\nindependent items may be strictly higher than the sum of the revenues\nobtainable by selling each of them separately. In fact, the structure of\noptimal (i.e., revenue-maximizing) mechanisms for two items even in this simple\nsetting is not understood.\n  In this paper we obtain approximate revenue optimization results using two\nsimple auctions: that of selling the items separately, and that of selling them\nas a single bundle. Our main results (which are of a \"direct sum\" variety, and\napply to any distributions) are as follows. Selling the items separately\nguarantees at least half the revenue of the optimal auction; for identically\ndistributed items, this becomes at least 73% of the optimal revenue.

A wide variety of\nschemes for both corrections have been proposed for decades. Regarding the\nimage-charge correction, Freysoldt, Neugebauer, and Van de Walle (FNV) recently\nproposed a novel method that enables us to accurately estimate the correction\nenergy a posteriori through alignment of the defect-induced potential to the\nmodel charge potential [Freysoldt et al., Phys.

Secondly, the long-range Coulomb interaction\nis assumed to be screened by a macroscopic dielectric constant. This is valid\nonly for cubic systems and can bring forth huge errors for defects in\nanisotropic materials. In this study, we use the atomic site electrostatic\npotential as a potential marker instead of the planar-averaged potential, and\nextend the FNV scheme by adopting the point charge model in an anisotropic\nmedium for estimating long-range interactions. We also revisit the conventional\npotential alignment correction and show that it is fully included in the\nimage-charge correction and therefore unnecessary. In addition, we show that\nthe potential alignment corresponds to a part of first-order and full of\nthird-order image-charge correction; thus the third-order image-charge\ncontribution is absent after the potential alignment. Finally, a systematic\nassessment of the accuracy of the extended FNV correction scheme is performed\nfor a wide range of material classes.

We developed an automated method, GALtoICL,\nbased on the software GALAPAGOS to obtain a refined version of typical BCG+ICL\nmaps. We applied this method to our test case MACS J1206.2-0847, a massive\ncluster located at z=0.44, that is part of the CLASH sample. Using deep\nmulti-band SUBARU images, we extracted the surface brightness (SB) profile of\nthe BCG+ICL and we studied the ICL morphology, color, and contribution to f*\nout to R500. We repeated the same analysis using a different definition of the\nICL, SBlimit method, i.e. a SB cut-off level, to compare the results. The most\npeculiar feature of the ICL in MACS1206 is its asymmetric radial distribution,\nwith an excess in the SE direction and extending towards the 2nd brightest\ncluster galaxy which is a Post Starburst galaxy. This suggests an interaction\nbetween the BCG and this galaxy that dates back to t <= 1.5 Gyr. The BCG+ICL\nstellar content is 8% of M_(*,500) and the (de-) projected baryon fraction in\nstars is f*=0.0177 (0.0116), in excellent agreement with recent results. The\nSBlimit method provides systematically higher ICL fractions and this effect is\nlarger at lower SB limits. This is due to the light from the outer envelopes of\nmember galaxies that contaminate the ICL. Though more time consuming, the\nGALtoICL method provides safer ICL detections that are almost free of this\ncontamination. This is one of the few ICL study at redshift z > 0.3. At\ncompletion, the CLASH/VLT program will allow us to extend this analysis to a\nstatistically significant cluster sample spanning a wide redshift range:\n0.2<z<0.6.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy and\n  Astrophysics"]}]

To assess the limiting performance of CPC (and therefore\nthe potential performance brought by this new approach), we derive, as a first\nstep towards many extensions of the present work, a general result which not\nonly concerns power control (PC) but also any scenario involving two\ndecision-makers (DMs) which communicate through their actions and have the\nfollowing information and decision structures. We assume that the DMs want to\nmaximize the average of an arbitrarily chosen instantaneous payoff function\nwhich depends on the DMs' actions and the state realization. DM 1 is assumed to\nknow non-causally the state (e.g., the channel state) which affects the common\npayoff while the other, say DM 2, has only a strictly causal knowledge of it.\nDM 1 can only use its own actions (e.g., power levels) to inform DM 2 about its\nbest action in terms of payoff. Importantly, DM 2 can only monitor the actions\nof DM 1 imperfectly and DM 1 does not observe DM 2. The latter assumption leads\nus to exploiting Shannon-theoretic tools in order to generalize an existing\ntheorem which provides the information constraint under which the payoff is\nmaximized. The derived result is then exploited to fully characterize the\nperformance of good CPC policies for a given instance of the interference\nchannel.\n","Comment: Information Theory Proceedings (ISIT), 2013 IEEE International\n  Symposium on Information Theory"]}]
