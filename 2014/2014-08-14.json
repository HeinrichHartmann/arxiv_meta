In this paper we develop a general\nframework that allows us to derive a number of new results, in particular when\n$f$ may be a non-monotone function. Our algorithms are based on (approximately)\nmaximizing the multilinear extension $F$ of $f$ over a polytope $P$ that\nrepresents the constraints, and then effectively rounding the fractional\nsolution. Although this approach has been used quite successfully, it has been\nlimited in some important ways. We overcome these limitations as follows.\n  First, we give constant factor approximation algorithms to maximize $F$ over\na down-closed polytope $P$ described by an efficient separation oracle.\nPreviously this was known only for monotone functions. For non-monotone\nfunctions, a constant factor was known only when the polytope was either the\nintersection of a fixed number of knapsack constraints or a matroid polytope.\nSecond, we show that contention resolution schemes are an effective way to\nround a fractional solution, even when $f$ is non-monotone. In particular,\ncontention resolution schemes for different polytopes can be combined to handle\nthe intersection of different constraints. Via LP duality we show that a\ncontention resolution scheme for a constraint is related to the correlation gap\nof weighted rank functions of the constraint. This leads to an optimal\ncontention resolution scheme for the matroid polytope.\n  Our results provide a broadly applicable framework for maximizing linear and\nsubmodular functions subject to independence constraints. We give several\nillustrative examples. Contention resolution schemes may find other\napplications.\n","Comment: Revision of previous version; extended abstract appeared at STOC 2011"]}]

Unlike QM it does not\nrefer to individual operators but rather to ensembles of observables which\nshare the same localization region, as a result it explains the probabilistic\naspects of QFT in terms of the impure KMS nature arising from the local\nrestriction of the pure vacuum. Whereas it played no important role in the\nperturbation theory of low spin particles, it becomes indispensible for\ninteractions which involve higher spin $s\\geq1$ fields, where is leads to the\nreplacement of the operator (BRST) gauge theory setting in Krein space by a new\nformulation in terms of stringlocal fields in Hilbert space.

We place these new findings into the broader context of ongoing\nconceptual changes within QFT which already led to new nonperturbative\nconstructions of models of integrable QFTs. It is also pointed out that modular\nlocalization does not support ideas coming from string theory, as extra\ndimensions and Kaluza-Klein dimensional reductions outside quasiclassical\napproximations. Apart from hologarphic projections on null-surfaces, holograhic\nrelations between QFT in different spacetime dimensions violate the causal\ncompleteness property, this includes in particular the Maldacena conjecture.\nLast not least, modular localization sheds light onto unsolved problems from\nQFT's distant past since it reveals that the Einstein-Jordan conundrum is\nreally an early harbinger of the Unruh effect.\n","Comment: a small text overlap with unpublished arXiv:1201.6328"]}]

To obtain the maximum throughput, the surface of the fibers should be\npolished in such a way that they are optically flat and free from scratches.\nThe optical fibers are inspected with a microscope at all stages of the\npolishing process to ensure high quality. The efficiency of the process may be\nimproved by using a cylindrical concave composite base as a substrate suitable\nfor diamond liquid solutions.

Most of the routing and data dissemination protocols of WSN assume\na homogeneous network architecture, in which all sensors have the same\ncapabilities in terms of battery power, communication, sensing, storage, and\nprocessing. Recently, there has been an interest in heterogeneous sensor\nnetworks, especially for real deployments. This research paper has proposed a\nnew energy aware clustering protocol (EACP) for heterogeneous wireless sensor\nnetworks. Heterogeneity is introduced in EACP by using two types of nodes:\nnormal and advanced. In EACP cluster heads for normal nodes are elected with\nthe help of a probability scheme based on residual and average energy of the\nnormal nodes. This will ensure that only the high residual normal nodes can\nbecome the cluster head in a round. Advanced nodes use a separate probability\nbased scheme for cluster head election and they will further act as a gateway\nfor normal cluster heads and transmit their data load to base station when they\nare not doing the duty of a cluster head. Finally a sleep state is suggested\nfor some sensor nodes during cluster formation phase to save network energy.\nThe performance of EACP is compared with SEP and simulation result shows the\nbetter result for stability period, network life and energy saving than SEP.\n","Comment: 15 Pages, 10 figures. in print at\n  http://airccse.org/journal/ijc2014.html"]}]

The proposed work here uses HSV color space, since HSV color space\nseparates color details from intensity. The enhancement of medical image is\nachieved by down sampling the original image into five versions, namely, tiny,\nsmall, medium, fine, and normal scale. This is due to the fact that the each\nversions of the image when independently enhanced and reconstructed results in\nenormous improvement in the visual quality. Further, the contrast stretching\nand MultiScale Retinex (MSR) techniques are exploited in order to enhance each\nof the scaled version of the image. Finally, the enhanced image is obtained by\ncombining each of these scales in an efficient way to obtain the composite\nenhanced image. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is validated by using\na wavelet energy metric in the wavelet domain. Reconstructed image using\nproposed method highlights the details (edges and tissues), reduces image noise\n(Gaussian and Speckle) and improves the overall contrast. The proposed\nalgorithm also enhances sharp edges of the tissue surrounding the spinal cord\nregions which is useful for diagnosis of spinal cord lesions.

The local bonding in those two structures is very\nsimilar, giving rise to a dispersive conduction band mostly consisting of\nmetal-d -states. Upon doping both compounds show structural changes, which lead\nto short metal-metal distances, indicating a bonding interaction that might be\nimportant for the appearance of superconductivity in these systems. We\nfurthermore draw analogies to other superconductors that are close to a charge\ndensity wave instability around a d 1 -configuration and offer a different\nperspective on this class of superconductors, which show non-BCS-like\nsuperconductivity.\n"]}]

Finite probability\ndistributions are a special case where the density matrix is restricted to be\ndiagonal. Density matrices are mixtures of dyads, where a dyad has the form uu'\nfor any any unit column vector u. These unit vectors are the elementary events\nof the generalized probability space. Perhaps the simplest case to see that\nsomething unusual is going on is the case of uniform density matrix, i.e. 1/n\ntimes identity. This matrix assigns probability 1/n to every unit vector, but\nof course there are infinitely many of them. The new normalization rule thus\nsays that sum of probabilities over any orthonormal basis of directions is one.\nWe develop a probability calculus based on these more general distributions\nthat includes definitions of joints, conditionals and formulas that relate\nthese, i.e. analogs of the theorem of total probability, various Bayes rules\nfor the calculation of posterior density matrices, etc. The resulting calculus\nparallels the familiar 'classical' probability calculus and always retains the\nlatter as a special case when all matrices are diagonal.\n  Whereas the classical Bayesian methods maintain uncertainty about which model\nis 'best', the generalization maintains uncertainty about which unit direction\nhas the largest variance. Surprisingly the bounds also generalize: as in the\nclassical setting we bound the negative log likelihood of the data by the\nnegative log likelihood of the MAP estimator.\n","Comment: Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty\n  in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)"]}]

This paper presents a method to account for feedforward inhibition\nso the usual mathematical approaches to stochastic synchronization can be\napplied.
