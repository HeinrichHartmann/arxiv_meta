Finding convex cuts is $\\mathcal{NP}$-hard for general graphs. To\ncharacterize convex cuts, we employ the Djokovic relation, a reflexive and\nsymmetric relation on the edges of a graph that is based on shortest paths\nbetween the edges' end vertices.\n  It is known for a long time that, if $G$ is bipartite and the Djokovic\nrelation is transitive on $G$, \\ie $G$ is a partial cube, then the cut-sets of\n$G$'s convex cuts are precisely the equivalence classes of the Djokovic\nrelation.

When the energy gained by the\nelectron-hole pair from the THz field is less than 3.2 times the ponderomotive\nenergy, the electron and the hole can be driven to the same position and\nrecombine without quantum tunneling, so the HSG will have large probability\namplitude. This leads to a plateau feature of the HSG spectrum with a\nhigh-frequency cutoff at about 3.2 times the ponderomotive energy above the\nband gap. Such a plateau feature is similar to the case of high-order harmonics\ngeneration in atoms where electrons have to overcome the binding energy to\nescape the atomic core.

The basis of our analysis is the\nlinearity of the probability measure related to the Born probability\ninterpretation, which excludes non-contextual hidden-variables models in $d\\geq\n3$. To be specific, we note the inconsistency of the non-contextual\nhidden-variables model in $d=4$ with the linearity of the quantum mechanical\nprobability measure in the sense $\\langle\\psi|{\\bf a}\\cdot {\\bf\n\\sigma}\\otimes{\\bf b}\\cdot {\\bf \\sigma}|\\psi\\rangle+\\langle\\psi|{\\bf a}\\cdot\n{\\bf \\sigma}\\otimes{\\bf b}^{\\prime}\\cdot {\\bf\n\\sigma}|\\psi\\rangle=\\langle\\psi|{\\bf a}\\cdot {\\bf \\sigma}\\otimes ({\\bf b}+{\\bf\nb}^{\\prime})\\cdot {\\bf \\sigma}|\\psi\\rangle$ for non-collinear ${\\bf b}$ and\n${\\bf b}^{\\prime}$.

We show that as the diameter\nis reduced, the phonon density-of-states and transmission function acquire a\nfinite value at low frequency, in contrast to approaching zero as in the bulk\nmaterial. It turns out that this effect results in what Ziman described as the\n\"problem of long longitudinal waves\" [1], which states that the thermal\nconductivity of a material increases as its length is increased due to the\nvanishing scattering for long-wavelength phonons. We show that this thermal\ntransport improvement also appears in nanowires as their diameter is decreased\nbelow D=5nm (not only as the length increases) originating from the increase in\nthe density of the long wavevector modes. The observation is present under\nballistic transport conditions, and further enhanced with the introduction of\nphonon-phonon scattering. Because of this, in such ultra-narrow nanowires, as\nthe diameter is reduced, phonon transport is dominated more and more by lower\nenergy phonons with longer mean-free paths.

We present a taxonomy of six soft global constraints,\ngenerated by combining the two latter ones and the two standard cost functions,\nwhich are either maximised or minimised. We characterise the complexity of\nachieving arc and bounds consistency on these constraints, resolving those\ncases for which NP-hardness was neither proven nor disproven. In particular, we\nexplore in depth the constraint ensuring that at least k pairs of variables\nhave a common value. We show that achieving arc consistency is NP-hard, however\nachieving bounds consistency can be done in polynomial time through dynamic\nprogramming. Moreover, we show that the maximum number of pairs of equal\nvariables can be approximated by a factor 1/2 with a linear time greedy\nalgorithm.

Since recent neutron experiments of\nNakamoto et al. show that the RRR of Cu is reduced from 200 to 50-120 for a\nfluence of 10^{21} n/cm^{2}, it follows that the inclusion of all high energy\nsources would lead to RRR values well below 50, thus endangering stability and\nprotection. This result confirms the necessity of including a tungsten shield\ninside the quadrupoles.\n","Comment: 7 pages, Contribution to WAMSDO 2013: Workshop on Accelerator Magnet,\n  Superconductor, Design and Optimization; 15 - 16 Jan 2013, CERN, Geneva,\n  Switzerland"]}]

While there has been significant progress in\ngeneral properties and technologies of energy storage, the systematic\ncharacterization of features particular to demand side management such as its\nintermittent, time-dependent potential seems to be lagging behind. As a\nconsequence, the development of efficient and sustainable strategies for demand\nside management and its integration into large-scale energy system models are\nimpeded.

On larger scales sector-specific\nprofiles can straightforwardly be taken into account. The potential for demand\nside management is then specified in terms of size and capacity of an\nequivalent storage device. This intermediate layer of abstraction isolates the\ngross effects and opportunities of demand side management from questions\nconcerning the operation of individual devices, which eases the integration of\nthe results in existing schemes for the commitment of production units and\nsystem models.

Therefore, without energy-aware transmission\nschemes, energy can deplete from sensor nodes with smaller energy budget faster\nthan from the rest of the sensor nodes in WSNs. This reduces the coverage area\nas well as the lifetime of WSNs. Collaborative beamforming (CB) has been\nproposed originally to achieve directional gain, however, it also inherently\ndistributes the corresponding energy consumption over the collaborative sensor\nnodes. In fact, CB can be seen as a physical layer solution (versus the media\naccess control/network layer solution) to balance the lifetimes of individual\nsensor nodes and extend the lifetime of the whole WSN. However, the\nintroduction of energy-aware CB schemes is critical for extending the WSNs\nlifetime.\n  In this paper, CB with power allocation (CB-PA) is developed to extend the\nlifetime of a cluster of collaborative sensor nodes by balancing the individual\nsensor node lifetimes. A novel strategy is proposed to utilize the residual\nenergy information available at each sensor node. It adjusts the energy\nconsumption rate at each sensor node while achieving the required average\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the destination. It is a semi-distributed\nstrategy and it maintains average SNR. Different factors affecting the energy\nconsumption are studied as well.

Our method\nis particularly suitable for applications to cosmology.\n","Comment: 14 pages, matches the published version. includes a modified version\n  of axodraw.sty that works with the Revtex4 class"]}]
