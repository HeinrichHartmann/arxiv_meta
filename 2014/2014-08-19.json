Here we combine\nthis knowledge from GWAS with robust population genetic modeling to identify\ntraits that may have been influenced by local adaptation. We exploit the fact\nthat GWAS provide an estimate of the additive effect size of many loci to\nestimate the mean additive genetic value for a given phenotype across many\npopulations as simple weighted sums of allele frequencies. We first describe a\ngeneral model of neutral genetic value drift for an arbitrary number of\npopulations with an arbitrary relatedness structure.

The receiver uses its channel state information (CSI) to distinguish\nstates, thus constructing an overlay erasure channel over the underlying fading\nchannels. By using this scheme, the capacity of a fading binary symmetric\nchannel is achieved without CSI at the transmitter. Noting that a fading AWGN\nchannel with BPSK modulation and demodulation corresponds to a fading binary\nsymmetric channel, this result covers a fairly large set of practically\nrelevant channel settings.\n  For fading additive exponential noise channels, expansion coding is used in\nconjunction to polar codes. Expansion coding transforms the continuous-valued\nchannel to multiple (independent) discrete-valued ones. For each level after\nexpansion, the approach described previously for fading binary symmetric\nchannels is used. Both theoretical analysis and numerical results are\npresented, showing that the proposed coding scheme approaches the capacity in\nthe high SNR regime.

Our analysis rests on the notion of useful flux, which for a\nthermoelectric system is the electrical current and for Feynman's ratchet is\nthe effective jump frequency. Our approach yields original insight into the\nderivation and analysis of the system's properties. In particular we define an\nentropy per tooth in analogy with the entropy per carrier or Seebeck\ncoefficient, and we derive the analogue to Kelvin's second relation for\nFeynman's ratchet. Owing to the formal similarity between the heat fluxes\nbalance equations for a thermoelectric generator (TEG) and those for Feynman's\nratchet, we introduce a distribution parameter that quantifies the amount of\nheat that flows through the cold and hot sides of both heat engines. While it\nis well established that $\\gamma$ = 1/2 for a TEG, it is equal to 1 for\nFeynman's ratchet. This implies that no heat may be rejected in the cold\nreservoir for the latter case. Further, the analysis of the efficiency at\nmaximum power shows that the so-called Feynman efficiency corresponds to that\nof an exoreversible engine, with $\\gamma$ = 1.

In such models, the dark\nmatter can annihilate into other hidden sector particles, which then decay into\nStandard Model fermions through a small degree of mixing with the photon, Z, or\nHiggs bosons. After discussing the gamma-ray signal from hidden sector dark\nmatter in general terms, we consider two concrete realizations: a hidden photon\nmodel in which the dark matter annihilates into a pair of vector gauge bosons\nthat decay through kinetic mixing with the photon, and a scenario within the\ngeneralized NMSSM in which the dark matter is a singlino-like neutralino that\nannihilates into a pair of singlet Higgs bosons, which decay through their\nmixing with the Higgs bosons of the MSSM.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 8 figures; v2: added discussion of AMS positron\n  constraints; v3: matches journal version"]}]

The Value-at-Risk constraint implies that when perceived risk is low,\nleverage is high and vice versa, a phenomenon that has been dubbed pro-cyclical\nleverage. We show that this leads to endogenous irregular oscillations, in\nwhich gradual increases in stock prices and leverage are followed by drastic\nmarket collapses, i.e. a leverage cycle. This phenomenon is studied using\nsimplified models that give a deeper understanding of the dynamics and the\nnature of the feedback loops and instabilities underlying the leverage cycle.\nWe introduce a flexible leverage regulation policy in which it is possible to\ncontinuously tune from pro-cyclical to countercyclical leverage. When the\npolicy is sufficiently countercyclical and bank risk is sufficiently low the\nendogenous oscillation disappears and prices go to a fixed point. While there\nis always a leverage ceiling above which the dynamics are unstable,\ncountercyclical leverage can be used to raise the ceiling. We also study the\nimpact on leverage cycles of direct, temporal control of the bank's riskiness\nvia the bank's required Value-at-Risk quantile. Under such a rule the regulator\nrelaxes the Value-at-Risk quantile following a negative stock price shock and\ntightens it following a positive shock. While such a policy rule can reduce the\namplitude of leverage cycles, its effectiveness is highly dependent on the\nchoice of parameters. Finally, we investigate fixed limits on leverage and show\nhow they can control the leverage cycle.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 9 figures"]}]

Using the vector fields approach, one has to face the major\nhurdle caused by the Ricci tensor of the metric for the quasi-linear wave\nequations. This posed a question that if the geometric approach can provide the\nsharp result for the non-geometric equations. In this paper, based on geometric\nnormalization and new observations on the mass aspect function, we prove the\nsharp local well-posedness of general quasilinear wave equation in ${\\Bbb\nR}^{1+3}$ by a vector field approach.\n"]}]

The proposed\ntensor techniques manifest the twofold benefits: (a) the entries of the Fock\nmatrix are computed by 1D operations using low-rank tensors represented on a 3D\ngrid, (b) the low-rank tensor structure in the diagonal blocks of the Fock\nmatrix in the Fourier space reduces the conventional 3D FFT to the product of\n1D FFTs. We describe fast numerical algorithms for the block circulant\nrepresentation of the core Hamiltonian in the periodic setting based on\nlow-rank tensor representation of arising multidimensional functions. Lattice\ntype systems in a box with open boundary conditions are treated by our previous\ntensor solver for single molecules, which makes possible calculations on large\n$(L_1,L_2,L_3)$ lattices due to reduced numerical cost for 3D problems. The\nnumerical simulations for box/periodic $(L,1,1)$ lattice systems in a 3D\nrectangular \"tube\" with $L$ up to several hundred confirm the theoretical\ncomplexity bounds for the tensor-structured eigenvalue solvers in the limit of\nlarge $L$.\n","Comment: This manuscript is the improved version of the preprint: V.\n  Khoromskaia, and B.N.

As far as enumeration of spanning trees is\nconcerned, our approach is incremental in nature and towards this end, we work\nwith the construction order of the 2-tree, i.e. enumeration of $n$-vertex trees\nare from $n-1$ vertex trees, $n \\geq 4$. Further, we also present a parallel\nalgorithm for spanning tree enumeration using $O(2^n)$ processors. To our\nknowledge, this paper makes the first attempt in designing a parallel algorithm\nfor this problem. We conclude this paper by presenting a sequential and\nparallel algorithm for enumerating all Perfect Elimination Orderings of a\nchordal graph.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 2 figures"]}]

These notions\nare used for a construction of noncommutative Wilson lines. Wilson lines can\nalso be constructed as global pure gauge fields on the universal covering\nspace.

The bounds apply, in particular, to the setting in which the\ntwo finite element spaces consist of continuous functions that are elementwise\npolynomials over shape-regular, quasi-uniform meshes that coincide except on a\nregion of measure $O(h^\\gamma)$, where $\\gamma$ is a nonnegative scalar and $h$\nis the mesh spacing. The projector may be, for example, the orthogonal\nprojector with respect to the $L^2$- or $H^1$-inner product. In these and other\ncircumstances, the bounds are superconvergent under a few mild regularity\nassumptions. That is, under mesh refinement, the two projections differ in norm\nby an amount that decays to zero at a faster rate than the amounts by which\neach projection differs from $u$. We present numerical examples to illustrate\nthese superconvergent estimates and verify the necessity of the regularity\nassumptions on $u$.\n"]}]
