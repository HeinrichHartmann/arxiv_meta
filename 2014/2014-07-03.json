These arise from the study of zero-communication protocols in which\nplayers are allowed to abort. Our scenario is inspired by the physics setup of\nBell experiments, where two players share a predefined entangled state but are\nnot allowed to communicate. Each is given a measurement as input, which they\nperform on their share of the system. The outcomes of the measurements should\nfollow a distribution predicted by quantum mechanics; however, in practice, the\ndetectors may fail to produce an output in some of the runs. The efficiency of\nthe experiment is the probability that the experiment succeeds (neither of the\ndetectors fails).\n  When the players share a quantum state, this gives rise to a new bound on\nquantum communication complexity (eff*) that subsumes the factorization norm.\nWhen players share randomness instead of a quantum state, the efficiency bound\n(eff), coincides with the partition bound of Jain and Klauck. This is one of\nthe strongest lower bounds known for randomized communication complexity, which\nsubsumes all the known combinatorial and algebraic methods including the\nrectangle (corruption) bound, the factorization norm, and discrepancy.\n  The lower bound is formulated as a convex optimization problem. In practice,\nthe dual form is more feasible to use, and we show that it amounts to\nconstructing an explicit Bell inequality (for eff) or Tsirelson inequality (for\neff*). We give an example of a quantum distribution where the violation can be\nexponentially bigger than the previously studied class of normalized Bell\ninequalities.\n  For one-way communication, we show that the quantum one-way partition bound\nis tight for classical communication with shared entanglement up to arbitrarily\nsmall error.\n","Comment: 21 pages, extended version"]}]

The considered resource allocation\nalgorithm design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem with a\nminimum required signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint at\nmultiple information receivers and a minimum required power transfer constraint\nat the energy harvesting receivers.

We develop colour and magnitude criteria that are based\nonly on WISE data to select asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with\ncircumstellar dust shells, and separate them into O-rich and C-rich classes.\nWith these criteria we produce an all-sky map for the count ratio of the two\npopulations. The map reveals differences between the Galactic disc, the\nMagellanic Clouds and the Sgr Dwarf Spheroidal galaxy, as well as a radial\ngradient in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) disc. We find that the C:O number\nratio for dusty AGB stars increases with distance from the LMC centre about\ntwice as fast as measured for near-IR selected samples of early AGB stars.\nDetailed radiative transfer models show that WISE colours are well explained by\nthe emission of centrally heated dusty shells where the dust has standard\nproperties of interstellar medium (ISM) grains. The segregation of different\nclasses of objects in WISE colour space arises from differences in properties\nof the dust shells: those around young stellar objects have uniform density\ndistributions while in evolved stars they have steep radial profiles.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 21 figures, 3 tables.

In this study, we developed a hybrid code to calculate an\nevolution of a differentially rotating system. With this code, we first\nconfirmed a linear growth of MRI. We also investigated a behavior of a\nparticular structure of a current sheet, which would exist in the turbulence in\nthe disk. From the calculation of the magnetic reconnection, we found an\nasymmetric structure in the out-of-plane magnetic field during the evolution of\nreconnection, which can be understood by a coupling of the Hall effect and the\ndifferential rotation. We also found a migration of X-point whose direction is\ndetermined only by an initial sign of J_0 \\times \\Omega_0, where J_0 is the\ninitial current density in the neutral sheet and \\Omega_0 is the rotational\nvector of the background Keplerian rotation. Associated with the migration of\nX-point, we also found a significant enhancement of the perpendicular magnetic\nfield compared to an ordinary MRI. MRI-Magnetic reconnection coupling and the\nresulting magnetic field enhancement can be an effective process to sustain a\nstrong turbulence in the accretion disk and to a transport of angular momentum.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 10 figures"]}]
