In particular, the methanol maser appears as an ideal tool to\nstudy the early phases of massive star formation. However, it is difficult to\nestablish the exact start of the methanol maser phase, and it would then be\ninteresting to detect and study low-flux density methanol masers (i.e., < 0.1\nJy or even << 0.1 Jy), in order to determine if they can effectively be used to\nmark a specific evolutionary phase in high-mass star formation. Past surveys\nhave been unable to systematically detect many low-flux density methanol\nmasers, and thus we do not yet know how many such masers exist in the Galaxy\nand what is their physical nature. Out of a sample of 107 observed Hi-GAL\nsources we detected a total of 32 methanol masers, with 22 sources being new\nand weak (median peak flux density 0.07 Jy) detections, in the Galactic\nlongitude range [32.0, 59.8]deg.

Our survey covers a similar range of source\ndistances as the \"Arecibo Methanol Maser Galactic Plane Survey\", but the\nmethanol masers detected by us are clearly shifted towards lower integrated\nflux densities. The newly detected methanol masers are mostly of low-luminosity\nand, except for some sources, their weakness is not due to distance effects or\npositional offsets. No specific correlation is found with the physical\nparameters of the Hi-GAL clumps, except for sources with both CH3OH and OH\nmasers which tend to have higher mass and luminosity. The intensity of the\nmethanol masers correlates well with the velocity range of the maser emission,\nwhich suggests that the low brightness of these masers is related to the number\nof maser spots in the emitting region and their evolution with time.\n","Comment: This paper contains a total of 14 figures and 7 tables.

Using our mixed and pure tensors approach, we were able to construct a\none-to-one map relating the usual gauge dependence of the Bardeen formalism\nwith the hyper-surface dependence inherent to the covariant approach. Finally,\nthrough the use of this map, we define full non-linear tensors that at first\norder correspond to the three known gauge invariant variables $\\Phi$, $\\Psi$\nand $\\Xi$, which are simultaneously foliation and gauge invariant.

In contrast to earlier work, our bound analysis is not\nbased on general purpose reasoners such as abstract interpreters, software\nmodel checkers or computer algebra tools. Rather, we derive bounds directly\nfrom abstract program models, which we obtain from programs by comparatively\nsimple invariant generation and symbolic execution techniques. As a result, we\nobtain an analysis that is more predictable and more scalable than earlier\napproaches. Our experiments demonstrate that our analysis is fast and at the\nsame time able to compute bounds for challenging loops in a large real-world\nbenchmark. Technically, our approach is based on lossy vector addition systems\n(VASS). Our bound analysis first computes a lexicographic ranking function that\nproves the termination of a VASS, and then derives a bound from this ranking\nfunction. Our methodology achieves amortized analysis based on a new insight\nhow lexicographic ranking functions can be used for bound analysis.\n"]}]

Flux reduction and spectral\ndistortions must be minimised by a careful planning of the observations --\nwhich is especially true for instruments that use slits instead of fibres. This\nis the case of VIMOS at the VLT, where MOS observations have been restricted,\nsince the start of operations, to a narrow two-hour range from the meridian to\nminimise slit losses. We revisit in detail the impact of atmospheric effects on\nthe quality of VIMOS-MOS spectra. We model slit losses across the entire VIMOS\nFOV as a function of target declination. We explore two different slit\norientations at the meridian: along the parallactic angle (North-South), and\nperpendicular to it (East-West). We show that, for fields culminating at zenith\ndistances larger than 20 deg, slit losses are minimised with slits oriented\nalong the parallactic angle at the meridian. The two-hour angle rule holds for\nthese observations using N-S orientations. Conversely, for fields with zenith\nangles smaller than 20 deg at culmination, losses are minimised with slits\noriented perpendicular to the parallactic angle at the meridian. MOS\nobservations can be effectively extended to plus/minus three hours from the\nmeridian in these cases. In general, night-long observations of a single field\nwill benefit from using the E-W orientation. All-sky or service mode\nobservations, however, require a more elaborate planning that depends on the\ntarget declination, and the hour angle of the observations.

The outcome of the dust radial migration is governed\nby simple criteria between the dust-to-gas ratio and the exponents p and q of\nthe surface density and temperature power laws. The transfer of radiation\nprovides an additional constraint between these quantities because the disc\nthermal structure is fixed by the dust spatial distribution. To assess which\ndiscs are primarily affected by the radial-drift barrier, we used the radiative\ntransfer code MCFOST to compute the temperature structure of a wide range of\ndisc models, stressing the particular effects of grain size distributions and\nvertical settling.\n  We find that the outcome of the dust migration process is very sensitive to\nthe physical conditions within the disc.

Multiband\n(BVRI) optical polarimetric observations were obtained during two nights in\n2008 at the ESO La Silla 3.6 m telescope (EFOSC2) in polarimetric mode. These\nobservations cover about the 30% of the 15.1 hours orbital period. J-band\nobservations were obtained in 2007 with the NICS (TNG) instrument at La Palma,\nfor a totality of 1 hour observation. We obtained 3-sigma upper limits to the\npolarisation degree in all the optical bands, with the most constraining one\nbeing in the I-band (P<0.5%). No phase-correlated variability has been noticed\nin all the filters. The J-band observations provided a 6% upper limit on the\npolarisation level. The constraining upper limits to the polarisation in the\noptical allowed us to evaluate the contribution of the possible emission of a\nrelativistic particles jet to the total system radiation to be less then the\n10%. This is in agreement with the observation of a spectral energy\ndistribution typical of a single black body of a K-spectral type main sequence\nstar irradiated from the compact object. Due to the low S/N ratio it was not\npossible to investigate the possible dependency of the polarisation degree from\nthe wavelength, that could be suggestive of polarisation induced by Thomson\nscattering of radiation with free electrons in the outer part of the accretion\ndisc. Observations with higher S/N ratio are required to examine in depth this\nhypothesis, searching for significant phase-correlated variability.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in section 7.

We express the spectral flow of the resulting\ncontinuous family of (unbounded) self-adjoint Fredholm operators in terms of\nthe Maslov index of two related curves of Lagrangian spaces. One curve is given\nby the varying domains, the other by the Cauchy data spaces. We provide\nrigorous definitions of the underlying concepts of spectral theory and\nsymplectic analysis and give a full (and surprisingly short) proof of our\nGeneral Spectral Flow Formula for the case of fixed maximal domain. As a side\nresult, we establish local stability of weak inner unique continuation property\n(UCP) and explain its role for parameter dependent spectral theory.\n","Comment: 22 pages"]}]
