In the first part, the\nthermodynamics of these spacetimes is investigated, while in the second part\nthe no hair theorem for these spacetimes in four dimensions is considered. In\npart I, first, the Euclidean actions of a d-dimensional charged rotating black\nbrane are computed through the use of the counterterms renormalization method\nboth in the canonical and the grand-canonical ensemble, and it is shown that\nthe logarithmic divergencies associated to the Weyl anomalies and matter field\nvanish. Second, a Smarr-type formula for the mass as a function of the entropy,\nthe angular momenta and the electric charge is obtained, which shows that these\nquantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. Third, by using the\nconserved quantities and the Euclidean actions, the thermodynamics potentials\nof the system in terms of the temperature, the angular velocities and the\nelectric potential are obtained both in the canonical and the grand-canonical\nensemble. Fourth, a stability analysis in these two ensembles is performed,\nwhich shows that the system is thermally stable. This is in commensurable with\nthe fact that there is no Hawking-Page phase transition for black object with\nzero curvature horizon. Finally, the logarithmic correction of the entropy due\nto the thermal fluctuation around the equilibrium is calculated. In part II,\nthe cosmological defects are studied, and it is shown that the Abelian Higgs\nfield equations in the background of a four-dimensional rotating charged black\nstring have vortex solutions.\n","Comment: PhD thesis, 130 pages and 23 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial\n  text overlap with arXiv:gr-qc/9610038 by other authors"]}]

The\nexchange of real and virtual photons between atoms gives rise to non-trivial\ninteractions the strength of which decreases rapidly with distance in three\ndimensions.
