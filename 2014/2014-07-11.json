Graph states are the original resource states for\nMBQC, and while it is not possible to obtain graph states as exact ground\nstates of two-body Hamiltonians here we construct two-body frustration-free\nHamiltonians that have arbitrarily good approximations of graph states as\nunique ground states.

We show that the speed of convergence of this protocol depends on the\ninitial color configuration as a whole, not just on the gap between the\nplurality and the second largest color community. This dependence is best\ncaptured by a novel notion we introduce, namely, the monochromatic distance\n${md}(\\bar{\\mathbf{c}})$ which measures the distance of the initial color\nconfiguration $\\bar{ \\mathbf {c}}$ from the closest monochromatic one. In the\ncomplete graph, we prove that, for a wide range of the input parameters, this\ndynamics converges within $O({md}(\\bar {\\mathbf {c}}) \\log {n})$ rounds. We\nprove that this upper bound is almost tight in the strong sense: Starting from\nany color configuration $\\bar {\\mathbf {c}}$, the convergence time is\n$\\Omega({md}(\\bar {\\mathbf {c}}))$. Finally, we adapt the Undecided-State\nDynamics to obtain a fast, random walk-based protocol for plurality consensus\non regular expanders. This protocol converges in $O({md}(\\bar {\\mathbf {c}})\n\\mathrm{polylog}(n))$ rounds using only $\\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ local memory. A\nkey-ingredient to achieve the above bounds is a new analysis of the maximum\nnode congestion that results from performing $n$ parallel random walks on\nregular expanders. All our bounds hold with high probability.\n","Comment: Corrected typos"]}]

Besides users' feedbacks (e.g.,\nnumerical ratings) on items as usually exploited by some typical recommendation\nalgorithms, there are often some additional data such as users' social circles\nand other behaviors. Such auxiliary data are usually related to users'\npreferences on items behind the numerical ratings. Collaborative recommendation\nwith auxiliary data (CRAD) aims to leverage such additional information so as\nto improve the personalization services, which have received much attention\nfrom both researchers and practitioners.\n  Transfer learning (TL) is proposed to extract and transfer knowledge from\nsome auxiliary data in order to assist the learning task on some target data.\nIn this paper, we consider the CRAD problem from a transfer learning view,\nespecially on how to achieve knowledge transfer from some auxiliary data.\nFirst, we give a formal definition of transfer learning for CRAD (TL-CRAD).\nSecond, we extend the existing categorization of TL techniques (i.e., adaptive,\ncollective and integrative knowledge transfer algorithm styles) with three\nknowledge transfer strategies (i.e., prediction rule, regularization and\nconstraint). Third, we propose a novel generic knowledge transfer framework for\nTL-CRAD. Fourth, we describe some representative works of each specific\nknowledge transfer strategy of each algorithm style in detail, which are\nexpected to inspire further works.
