This paper uses data-constrained\nNLFFF models of a solar active region that erupted on 2010 April 8 as initial\ncondition in MHD simulations. These models, constructed with the techniques of\nflux rope insertion and magnetofrictional relaxation, include a stable, an\napproximately marginally stable, and an unstable configuration. The simulations\nconfirm previous related results of magnetofrictional relaxation runs, in\nparticular that stable flux rope equilibria represent key features of the\nobserved pre-eruption coronal structure very well and that there is a limiting\nvalue of the axial flux in the rope for the existence of stable NLFFF\nequilibria. The specific limiting value is located within a tighter range, due\nto the sharper discrimination between stability and instability by the MHD\ndescription. The MHD treatment of the eruptive configuration yields very good\nagreement with a number of observed features like the strongly inclined initial\nrise path and the close temporal association between the coronal mass ejection\nand the onset of flare reconnection. Minor differences occur in the velocity of\nflare ribbon expansion and in the further evolution of the inclination; these\ncan be eliminated through refined simulations. We suggest that the slingshot\neffect of horizontally bent flux in the source region of eruptions can\ncontribute significantly to the inclination of the rise direction.

We present correlations between epsilon'/epsilon and rare decays\nK->pi nu bar{nu} with and without the Delta I=1/2 rule constraint and\ngeneralize the whole analysis to Z' with colour (G') and Z with FCNC couplings.\nIn the latter case no improvement on Re(A_0) can be achieved without destroying\nthe agreement of the SM with the data on Re(A_2). Moreover, this scenario is\nvery tightly constrained by epsilon'/epsilon. On the other hand in the context\nof the Delta I=1/2 rule G' is even more effective than Z': it provides the\nmissing piece in Re(A_0) for M_{G'}=(3.5-4.0) TeV.\n","Comment: 63 pages, 20 figures; clarifying comments added; version accepted for\n  publication in EPJC"]}]

Although intercell interference can be mitigated by Base\nStation (BS) Coordination, the demand on inter-BS information exchange and\ncomputational complexity grows rapidly with the number of cells, subcarriers,\nand users. On the other hand, some of the existing coordination beamforming\nmethods need computation of pseudo-inverse or generalized eigenvector of a\nmatrix, which are practically difficult to implement in a real system. To\nhandle these issues, we propose a novel linear beamforming across a set of\ncoordinated cells only with limiting backhaul signalling. Resource allocation\n(i.e. precoding and power control) is formulated as an optimization problem\nwith objective function of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) in\norder to maximize the instantaneous weighted sum-rate subject to power\nconstraints. Although the primal problem is nonconvex and difficult to be\noptimally solved, an iterative algorithm is presented based on the\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition. To have a practical solution with low\ncomputational complexity and signalling overhead, we present CB-REFIM\n(coordination beamforming-reference based interference management) and show the\nrecently proposed REFIM algorithm can be interpreted as a special case of\nCB-REFIM.

Our analysis allows us create a\ntaxonomy of the chase variations and the properties they satisfy. Two of the\nmost central problems regarding the chase is termination, and discovery of\nrestricted classes of sets of dependencies that guarantee termination of the\nchase. The search for the restricted classes has been motivated by a fairly\nrecent result that shows that it is undecidable to determine whether the chase\nwith a given dependency set will terminate on a given instance. There is a\nsmall dissonance here, since the quest has been for classes of sets of\ndependencies guaranteeing termination of the chase on all instances, even\nthough the latter problem was not known to be undecidable. We resolve the\ndissonance in this paper by showing that determining whether the chase with a\ngiven set of dependencies terminates on all instances is coRE-complete. For the\nhardness proof we use a reduction from word rewriting systems, thereby also\nshowing the close connection between the chase and word rewriting. The same\nreduction also gives us the aforementioned instance-dependent RE-completeness\nresult as a byproduct.

To resolve this difficulty, we introduce the useful notion\nof maximal reference set (MRS) which contains all the reference DMUs. Based on\nboth primal and dual formulations, we then propose a new mixed integer linear\nprogramming (MILP) based approach for determining the MRS. The proposed\napproach is more general than the existing ones, and has several desirable\nproperties: (i) having a unified formulation, (ii) adaptable with different DEA\nmodels, and (iii) compatible with both primal and dual forms of the DEA models.\nFurthermore, our approach is made computationally effective by establishing a\nLP-based procedure to treat with the primal-based MILP.\n"]}]

Our primary purpose is developing two generalized\ndirectional measures of super-efficiency that completely resolve the crucial\ninfeasibility issue, commonly arisen in the traditional super-efficiency\nmeasures. The secondary goal is to demonstrate that our directional\nsuper-efficiency models encompass the conventional ones as special cases. The\nproposed measures are advantageous because they circumvent biases in\nsuper-efficiency estimation due to input and output slacks. They are general,\nand satisfy several desirable properties, such as always feasibility,\nmonotonicity, unit independence, and translation invariance.\n"]}]

Such models are essential for many\naspects of the study of dark matter and dark energy, since we lack a\nsufficiently accurate analytic model of non-linear gravitational clustering. In\nJuly 2014, we made available to the general community our early data release,\nconsisting of over 55 Terabytes of simulation data products, including our\nlargest simulation to date, which used $1.07 \\times 10^{12}~(10240^3)$\nparticles in a volume $8h^{-1}\\mathrm{Gpc}$ across. Our simulations were\nperformed with 2HOT, a purely tree-based adaptive N-body method, running on\n200,000 processors of the Titan supercomputer, with data analysis enabled by\nyt. We provide an overview of the derived halo catalogs, mass function, power\nspectra and light cone data. We show self-consistency in the mass function and\nmass power spectrum at the 1% level over a range of more than 1000 in particle\nmass. We also present a novel method to distribute and access very large\ndatasets, based on an abstraction of the World Wide Web (WWW) as a file system,\nremote memory-mapped file access semantics, and a space-filling curve index.\nThis method has been implemented for our data release, and provides a means to\nnot only query stored results such as halo catalogs, but also to design and\ndeploy new analysis techniques on large distributed datasets.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 9 figures, project website at\n  http://darksky.slac.stanford.edu, repository at\n  http://bitbucket.org/darkskysims"]}]
