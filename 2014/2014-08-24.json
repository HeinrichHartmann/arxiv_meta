They\nallow the sharing of geographically distributed resources in an efficient way,\nextending the boundaries of what we perceive as distributed computing. Various\nsciences can benefit from the use of grids to solve CPU-intensive problems,\ncreating potential benefits to the entire society. Job scheduling is an\nintegrated part of parallel and distributed computing. It allows selecting\ncorrect match of resource for a particular job and thus increases the job\nthroughput and utilization of resources. Job should be scheduled in an\nautomatic way to make the system more reliable, accessible and less sensitive\nto subsystem failures. This paper provides a survey on various heuristic\nalgorithms, used for scheduling in grid.\n","Comment: 6 Pages, 1 FiguerE, \"Published with International Journal of Computer\n  Trends and Technology (IJCTT)\". arXiv admin note: contains excessive text\n  overlap with other internet sources"]}]
