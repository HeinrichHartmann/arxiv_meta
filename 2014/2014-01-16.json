Our starting\npoint is to treat this system as a combination of two max-plus eigenproblems,\nwith two additional constraints. Though infinite-dimensional, these two\neigenproblems can be treated by means of the \"standard\" max-plus spectral\ntheory. In particular, any solution to the system can be described as a\nmax-linear combination of fundamental eigenvectors associated with each\nsoliton. We then describe the operation of undressing using pairs of\nfundamental eigenvectors. We also study the solvability of the complete system\nof four equations as proposed by Willox et al.\n"]}]

Therefore, alternative popularity measures for Twitter users on the\nbasis of, for example, users' tweets and retweets, have been developed. In the\npresent work, we take a purely network approach to this fundamental question.\nFirst, we find that two relatively distinct types of users possessing a large\nnumber of followers exist, in particular for Japanese, Russian, and Korean\nusers among the seven language groups that we examined.

In contrast to previous work, we account for a\nstochastic turn-on time $t_i$ associated with the leading edge of a pulse\nsignaling one of the qubit states. This model is relevant to spin-qubit\nreadouts based on spin-to-charge conversion and would be generically reached in\nthe limit of large signal-to-noise ratio $r$ for several other physical\nsystems, including fluorescence-based readouts of ion-trap qubits and\nnitrogen-vacancy center spins.

However, when there are many alternatives, it is impractical to\nsimply ask agents to report their complete preferences. Rather, the agents\npreferences, or at least the relevant parts thereof, need to be elicited. This\nis done by asking the agents a (hopefully small) number of simple queries about\ntheir preferences, such as comparison queries, which ask an agent to compare\ntwo of the alternatives.

Forming effective\ncoalitions is a major research challenge in the field of multi-agent systems.\nCentral to this endeavour is the problem of determining which of the many\npossible coalitions to form in order to achieve some goal. This usually\nrequires calculating a value for every possible coalition, known as the\ncoalition value, which indicates how beneficial that coalition would be if it\nwas formed. Once these values are calculated, the agents usually need to find a\ncombination of coalitions, in which every agent belongs to exactly one\ncoalition, and by which the overall outcome of the system is maximized.\nHowever, this coalition structure generation problem is extremely challenging\ndue to the number of possible solutions that need to be examined, which grows\nexponentially with the number of agents involved. To date, therefore, many\nalgorithms have been proposed to solve this problem using different techniques\nranging from dynamic programming, to integer programming, to stochastic search\nall of which suffer from major limitations relating to execution time, solution\nquality, and memory requirements.\n  With this in mind, we develop an anytime algorithm to solve the coalition\nstructure generation problem. Specifically, the algorithm uses a novel\nrepresentation of the search space, which partitions the space of possible\nsolutions into sub-spaces such that it is possible to compute upper and lower\nbounds on the values of the best coalition structures in them. These bounds are\nthen used to identify the sub-spaces that have no potential of containing the\noptimal solution so that they can be pruned. The algorithm, then, searches\nthrough the remaining sub-spaces very efficiently using a branch-and-bound\ntechnique to avoid examining all the solutions within the searched subspace(s).\nIn this setting, we prove that our algorithm enumerates all coalition\nstructures efficiently by avoiding redundant and invalid solutions\nautomatically. Moreover, in order to effectively test our algorithm we develop\na new type of input distribution which allows us to generate more reliable\nbenchmarks compared to the input distributions previously used in the field.\nGiven this new distribution, we show that for 27 agents our algorithm is able\nto find solutions that are optimal in 0.175% of the time required by the\nfastest available algorithm in the literature. The algorithm is anytime, and if\ninterrupted before it would have normally terminated, it can still provide a\nsolution that is guaranteed to be within a bound from the optimal one.\nMoreover, the guarantees we provide on the quality of the solution are\nsignificantly better than those provided by the previous state of the art\nalgorithms designed for this purpose. For example, for the worst case\ndistribution given 25 agents, our algorithm is able to find a 90% efficient\nsolution in around 10% of time it takes to find the optimal solution.\n"]}]

Figuring prominently among these is automated Web\nService Composition (WSC) at the \"capability\" level, where services are\ndescribed in terms of preconditions and effects over ontological concepts. A\nkey issue in addressing WSC as planning is that ontologies are not only formal\nvocabularies; they also axiomatize the possible relationships between concepts.\nSuch axioms correspond to what has been termed \"integrity constraints\" in the\nactions and change literature, and applying a web service is essentially a\nbelief update operation. The reasoning required for belief update is known to\nbe harder than reasoning in the ontology itself. The support for belief update\nis severely limited in current planning tools.\n  Our first contribution consists in identifying an interesting special case of\nWSC which is both significant and more tractable. The special case, which we\nterm \"forward effects\", is characterized by the fact that every ramification of\na web service application involves at least one new constant generated as\noutput by the web service. We show that, in this setting, the reasoning\nrequired for belief update simplifies to standard reasoning in the ontology\nitself. This relates to, and extends, current notions of \"message-based\" WSC,\nwhere the need for belief update is removed by a strong (often implicit or\ninformal) assumption of \"locality\" of the individual messages. We clarify the\ncomputational properties of the forward effects case, and point out a strong\nrelation to standard notions of planning under uncertainty, suggesting that\neffective tools for the latter can be successfully adapted to address the\nformer.\n  Furthermore, we identify a significant sub-case, named \"strictly forward\neffects\", where an actual compilation into planning under uncertainty exists.\nThis enables us to exploit off-the-shelf planning tools to solve message-based\nWSC in a general form that involves powerful ontologies, and requires reasoning\nabout partial matches between concepts.

Alice\nand Bob have pre-shared keys and Eve is computationally unbounded. There are a\ntotal of $n$ paths and the three parties can have simultaneous access to at\nmost $t_a$, $t_b$, and $t_e$ paths.
