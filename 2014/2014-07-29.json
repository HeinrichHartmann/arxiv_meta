The concept\nof selective control is developed using cell death or apoptosis in\nheterogeneous cell populations as an example. Apoptosis signaling in\nheterogeneous cells is described by an ensemble of gene networks with identical\ntopology but different link strengths. Selective control depends on the\nstatistics of signaling in the ensemble of networks and we analyse the effects\nof superposition, non-linearity and feedback on these statistics. Parallel\npathways promote normal statistics while series pathways promote skew\ndistributions which in the most extreme cases become log-normal. We also show\nthat feedback and non-linearity can produce bimodal signaling statistics, as\ncan discreteness and non-linearity. Two methods for optimizing selective\ncontrol are presented. The first is an exhaustive search method and the second\nis a linear programming based approach. Though control of a single gene in the\nsignaling network yields little selectivity, control of a few genes typically\nyields higher levels of selectivity. The statistics of gene combinations\nsusceptible to selective control is studied and is used to identify general\ncontrol strategies. We found that selectivity is promoted by acting on the\nleast sensitive nodes in the case of weak populations, while selective control\nof robust populations is optimized through perturbations of more sensitive\nnodes. High throughput experiments with heterogeneous cell lines could be\ndesigned in an analogous manner, with the further possibility of incorporating\nthe selectivity optimization process into a closed-loop control system.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 16 figures.

For higher dimensional problems, no linear methods were\nknown up to now. We present a new procedure for finding the entire nondominated\nset of tricriteria optimization problems for which the number of scalarized\nsubproblems to be solved is at most three times the number of nondominated\npoints of the underlying problem. The approach includes an iterative update of\nthe search space that, given a (sub-)set of nondominated points, describes the\narea in which additional nondominated points may be located. In particular, we\nshow that the number of boxes, into which the search space is decomposed,\ndepends linearly on the number of nondominated points.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 8 figures, Journal of Global Optimization, 2014"]}]

In thin nanoribbons with thickness of ~40 nm, a\ntwo-fold rational symmetry of the low field AMR spectra and two sets of\n1/2-shifted (i.e. {\\gamma}=1/2) Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) quantum oscillations\nwith exact two- dimensional (2D) character were obtained. However, when the\nthickness of the ribbon increases, a 3D bulk-like SdH oscillations with\n{\\gamma}=0 and a four-fold rotational symmetry of the AMR spectra appear. These\nresults unambiguously provided the first transport evidence of the topological\n2D metallic surface states in thinner nanoribbons with an insulating bulk. Our\nobservations provide a promising pathway to understand the quantum phenomena in\nBi arising from the surface states.\n","Comment: Accepted by ACS Nano"]}]

Here we consider a\npolymer in a bacterial bath, i.e. in a solvent consisting of active particles\nwhich bring in nonequilibrium fluctuations. Using computer simulations of a\nself-avoiding polymer chain in two dimensions which is exposed to a dilute bath\nof active particles, we show that the Flory-scaling exponent is unaffected by\nthe bath activity provided the chain is very long. Conversely, for shorter\nchains, there is a nontrivial coupling between the bacteria intruding into the\nchain which may stiffen and expand the chain in a nonuniversal way. As a\nfunction of the molecular weight, the swelling first scales faster than\ndescribed by the Flory exponent, then an unusual plateau-like behaviour is\nreached and finally a crossover to the universal Flory behaviour is observed.\nAs a function of bacterial activity, the chain end-to-end distance exhibits a\npronounced non-monotonicity. Moreover, the mean-square displacement of the\ncenter of mass of the chain shows a ballistic behaviour at intermediate times\nas induced by the active solvent.

The availability of measures in different wavelengths has\nallowed us to validate our model with more efficiency.

In a\nfluid limit, a control producing asymptotic SSC corresponds to an ideal sliding\nmode control that forces the fluid trajectories to a lower-dimensional sliding\nmanifold. Within deterministic dynamical systems theory, it is well known that\nsliding-mode controls can cause the system to chatter back and forth along the\nsliding manifold due to delays in activation of the control. For the prelimit\nstochastic system, chattering implies fluid-scaled fluctuations that are larger\nthan typical stochastic fluctuations. In this paper we show that chattering can\noccur in the fluid limit of a controlled stochastic network when inappropriate\ncontrol parameters are used. The model has two large service pools operating\nunder the fixed-queue-ratio with activation and release thresholds (FQR-ART)\noverload control which we proposed in a recent paper. We now show that, if the\ncontrol parameters are not chosen properly, then delays in activating and\nreleasing the control can cause chattering with large oscillations in the fluid\nlimit. In turn, these fluid-scaled fluctuations lead to severe congestion, even\nwhen the arrival rates are smaller than the potential total service rate in the\nsystem, a phenomenon referred to as congestion collapse.

In\nparticular, we introduce a taxonomy specifically designed for scientific\ncomputing in the cloud, and further review the taxonomy with four major kinds\nof science applications, including life sciences, physics sciences, social and\nhumanities sciences, and climate and earth sciences. Our major finding is that,\ndespite existing efforts in developing cloud-based eScience, eScience still has\na long way to go to fully unlock the power of cloud computing paradigm.\nTherefore, we present the challenges and opportunities in the future\ndevelopment of cloud-based eScience services, and call for collaborations and\ninnovations from both the scientific and computer system communities to address\nthose challenges.\n"]}]

In s-deadlock, the entire\nsystem gets blocked and is unable to make any transition. Cache coherence\nprotocols consist of N symmetric cache agents, where N is an unbounded\nparameter; thus the verification of s-deadlock freedom is naturally a\nparameterized verification problem. Parametrized verification techniques work\nby using sound abstractions to reduce the unbounded model to a bounded model.\nEfficient abstractions which work well for industrial scale protocols typically\nbound the model by replacing the state of most of the agents by an abstract\nenvironment, while keeping just one or two agents as is. However, leveraging\nsuch efficient abstractions becomes a challenge for s-deadlock: a violation of\ns-deadlock is a state in which the transitions of all of the unbounded number\nof agents cannot occur and so a simple abstraction like the one above will not\npreserve this violation.

Obtained results indicate that protein can attract\nelectrostatically to the surface if ceramic material has a moderate dielectric\nconstant below or about 35 (in particularly ZrO2 or Ta2O5). This is in contrast\nto classical (local) consideration of the solvent, which demonstrates an\nunfavorable electrostatic interaction of protein with typical metal oxide\nceramic materials (dielectric constant>10). Thus, a solid implant coated by\ncombining oxide ceramic with a reduced dielectric constant can be beneficial to\nstrengthen the electrostatic binding of the protein-implant complex.\n","Comment: 21 page, 3 figures"]}]

L0 is known as the most essential\nsparsity measure and has nice theoretical properties, while the popular L1\nregularization is only a best convex relaxation of L0. Therefore, it is natural\nto expect that L0 regularized regression performs better than LASSO. However,\nit is well-known that L0 optimization is NP-hard and computationally\nchallenging. Instead of solving the L0 problems directly, most publications so\nfar have tried to solve an approximation problem that closely resembles L0\nregularization.\n  In this paper, we propose an efficient EM algorithm (L0EM) that directly\nsolves the L0 optimization problem. $L_0$EM is efficient with high dimensional\ndata.

The results indicate that L0 has better performance than LASSO\nand L0 with AIC or BIC has similar performance as computationally intensive\ncross-validation.
