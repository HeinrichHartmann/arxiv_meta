Our goal is to design practical scheduling\npolicies that can achieve provably good performance in terms of both throughput\nand delay, at a low complexity. While a class of $O(n^{2.5} \\log n)$-complexity\nhybrid scheduling policies are recently developed to guarantee both\nrate-function delay optimality (in the many-channel many-user asymptotic\nregime) and throughput optimality (in the general non-asymptotic setting),\ntheir practical complexity is typically high. To address this issue, we develop\na simple greedy policy called Delay-based Server-Side-Greedy (D-SSG) with a\n\\lower complexity $2n^2+2n$, and rigorously prove that D-SSG not only achieves\nthroughput optimality, but also guarantees near-optimal asymptotic delay\nperformance. Specifically, we show that the rate-function attained by D-SSG for\nany delay-violation threshold $b$, is no smaller than the maximum achievable\nrate-function by any scheduling policy for threshold $b-1$. Thus, we are able\nto achieve a reduction in complexity (from $O(n^{2.5} \\log n)$ of the hybrid\npolicies to $2n^2 + 2n$) with a minimal drop in the delay performance. More\nimportantly, in practice, D-SSG generally has a substantially lower complexity\nthan the hybrid policies that typically have a large constant factor hidden in\nthe $O(\\cdot)$ notation. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to validate\nour theoretical results in various scenarios.

Applying these\nresults, we obtain several phenomena of the Ocneanu ultraproduct of type III\nfactors, which are not present in the tracial ultraproducts. For instance, it\nturns out that the ultrapower $M^{\\omega}$ of a Type III$_0$ factor is never a\nfactor. Moreover we settle in the affirmative a recent problem by Ueda about\nthe connection between the relative commutant of $M$ in $M^{\\omega}$ and\nConnes' asymptotic centralizer algebra $M_{\\omega}$.\n","Comment: Reduced to 56 pages by changing layouts.

As\nbefore, there is no clear answer to this question even for the one-dimensional\ncompleted scattering (OCS). In this paper we show that this seemingly simple\nquestion stands alongside with such fundamental problems of quantum mechanics\n(QM) as the Schrodinger's-cat and and EPR-Bohm paradoxes. Their common feature\nis that the states of a scattered particle, a radioactive atom and electron\nEPR-pair represent pure {\\it micro-cat} states. It is widely accepted that the\nEPR-Bohm paradox implies the non-existence of local hidden variables (LHVs),\nthe cat paradox represents a macro-objectification problem and the tunneling\ntime is an observer-dependent quantity whose definitions must be 'operational'.\nAt the same time, according to the probabilistic approach (Accardi, Khrennikov,\nPhilipp, Hess {\\it et al.}) to Bell's inequality that underlies the EPR-Bohm\nexperiments, its experimental violation means simply that it contains\nprobability distributions associated with mutually incompatible statistical\ndata. We argue that this approach must be extended onto micro-cat states\nbecause they describe, too, mutually incompatible statistical data. The current\npractice to interpret the squared modulus of a micro-cat state as the\nprobability density should be recognized as erroneous. It is this practice that\nmakes QM incompatible with classical physical theories and, thereby, makes the\nmicro-world 'unspeakable'. The known 'operational' tunneling-time concepts,\nelaborated in line with this practice, are logically inconsistent. We argue\nthat the TTP and the cat paradox must be solved at the level of single\nelectrons and atoms, without resorting to environment and measurement contexts.\nWe present a new model of the OCS and solve the TTP on its basis.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 2 figures; thoroughly rewritten text"]}]

The modulus of the magnetic helicity spectrum shows a k^{-11/3} power\nlaw at large wavenumbers, which implies a k^{-5/3} spectrum for the modulus of\nthe current helicity. A k^{-5/3} spectrum is also obtained for the magnetic\nenergy.

For each criterion, we propose\na convergent on-policy Q-learning algorithm that operates on two timescales,\nwhile employing function approximation to handle the curse of dimensionality\nassociated with the underlying POMDP. Our proposed algorithm incorporates a\npolicy gradient update using a one-simulation simultaneous perturbation\nstochastic approximation (SPSA) estimate on the faster timescale, while the\nQ-value parameter (arising from a linear function approximation for the\nQ-values) is updated in an on-policy temporal difference (TD) algorithm-like\nfashion on the slower timescale.

For the sake of\ncomparison, in both discounted and average settings, we also develop a function\napproximation analogue of the Q-learning algorithm.

In this paper, we present a robust and\ncomputationally efficient algorithm for removing power line interference from\nneural recordings. The algorithm includes four steps. First, an adaptive notch\nfilter is used to estimate the fundamental frequency of the interference.\nSubsequently, based on the estimated frequency, harmonics are generated by\nusing discrete-time oscillators, and then the amplitude and phase of each\nharmonic are estimated through using a modified recursive least squares\nalgorithm. Finally, the estimated interference is subtracted from the recorded\ndata. The algorithm does not require any reference signal, and can track the\nfrequency, phase, and amplitude of each harmonic. When benchmarked with other\npopular approaches, our algorithm performs better in terms of noise immunity,\nconvergence speed, and output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While minimally\naffecting the signal bands of interest, the algorithm consistently yields fast\nconvergence and substantial interference rejection in different conditions of\ninterference strengths (input SNR from -30 dB to 30 dB), power line frequencies\n(45-65 Hz), and phase and amplitude drifts.

The coupling of Stokes and Biot equations represents a\nprototype problem for these phenomena, which feature multiple facets. On one\nhand it shares common traits with fluid-structure interaction. On the other\nhand it resembles the Stokes-Darcy coupling. For these reasons, the numerical\nsimulation of the Stokes-Biot coupled system is a challenging task. The need of\nlarge memory storage and the difficulty to characterize appropriate solvers and\nrelated preconditioners are typical shortcomings of classical discretization\nmethods applied to this problem. The application of loosely coupled time\nadvancing schemes mitigates these issues because it allows to solve each\nequation of the system independently with respect to the others. In this work\nwe develop and thoroughly analyze a loosely coupled scheme for Stokes-Biot\nequations. The scheme is based on Nitsche's method for enforcing interface\nconditions. Once the interface operators corresponding to the interface\nconditions have been defined, time lagging allows us to build up a loosely\ncoupled scheme with good stability properties. The stability of the scheme is\nguaranteed provided that appropriate stabilization operators are introduced\ninto the variational formulation of each subproblem. The error of the resulting\nmethod is also analyzed, showing that splitting the equations pollutes the\noptimal approximation properties of the underlying discretization schemes. In\norder to restore good approximation properties, while maintaining the\ncomputational efficiency of the loosely coupled approach, we consider the\napplication of the loosely coupled scheme as a preconditioner for the\nmonolithic approach.

Drosophila dorsal closure (DC) has emerged as\na model system for studying the interplay between tissue mechanics and cellular\nactivity.

We combined\nquantitation of live data, genetic and mechanical perturbation and cell\nbiology, to investigate how mechanical properties and contraction rate emerge\nfrom cytoskeletal activity.

The quantification of how the perturbation induced by\nlaser ablation decays throughout the tissue revealed that the tissue in these\ntwo mutant backgrounds reacts very differently. We suggest that the differences\nin the strain rate of cells in situations where Myosin activity or actin\npolymerization is increased arise from changes in how the contractile forces\nare transmitted and coordinated across the tissue through ECadherin mediated\nadhesion.

The inference\nproblem, to determine the probability of query answers in PLP, is intractable\nin general, thereby motivating the need for approximate techniques. In this\npaper, we present a technique for approximate inference of conditional\nprobabilities for PLP queries. It is an Adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) technique, where the distribution from which samples are drawn is\nmodified as the Markov Chain is explored. In particular, the distribution is\nprogressively modified to increase the likelihood that a generated sample is\nconsistent with evidence. In our context, each sample is uniquely characterized\nby the outcomes of a set of random variables. Inspired by reinforcement\nlearning, our technique propagates rewards to random variable/outcome pairs\nused in a sample based on whether the sample was consistent or not. The\ncumulative rewards of each outcome is used to derive a new \"adapted\ndistribution\" for each random variable. For a sequence of samples, the\ndistributions are progressively adapted after each sample. For a query with\n\"Markovian evaluation structure\", we show that the adapted distribution of\nsamples converges to the query's conditional probability distribution. For\nMarkovian queries, we present a modified adaptation process that can be used in\nadaptive MCMC as well as adaptive independent sampling.

Behavioural observations on the two\neusocial species \\textit{Ropalidia marginata} and \\textit{Ropalidia\ncyathiformis} suggest varying complexities in their social systems. The queen\nof R. cyathiformis is an aggressive individual who usually holds the top\nposition in the dominance hierarchy although she does not necessarily show the\nmaximum number of acts of dominance, while the R. marginata queen rarely shows\naggression and usually does not hold the top position in the dominance\nhierarchy of her colony. These differences are reflected in the distribution of\ndominance-subordinate interactions among the hierarchically ranked individuals\nin both the species. The percentage of dominance interactions decrease\ngradually with hierarchical ranks in R. marginata while in R. cyathiformis it\nfirst increases and then decreases. We use an agent-based model to investigate\nthe underlying mechanism that could give rise to the observed patterns for both\nthe species. The model assumes, besides some non-interacting individuals, that\nthe interaction probabilities of the agents depend on their pre-differentiated\nwinning abilities. Our simulations show that if the queen takes up a strategy\nof being involved in a moderate number of dominance interactions, one could get\nthe pattern similar to R. cyathiformis, while taking up the strategy of very\nlow interactions by the queen could lead to the pattern of R. marginata. We\ninfer that both the species follow a common interaction pattern, while the\ndifferences in their social organization are due to the slight changes in queen\nas well as worker strategies. These changes in strategies are expected to\naccompany the evolution of more complex societies from simpler ones.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables"]}]
