Quantum information provides a theoretical framework and the\nproper mathematical tools to accomplish this. In this context the notion of\ncodes and communication capacities have been introduced by generalizing them\nfrom the classical Shannon theory of information transmission and error\ncorrection. The underlying assumption of this approach is to consider the\nchannel not as acting on a single system, but on sequences of systems, which,\nwhen properly initialized allow one to overcome the noisy effects induced by\nthe physical process under consideration.

A slightly different, yet\nconceptually related, notion of correlated errors applies to a single quantum\nsystem which evolves continuously in time under the influence of an external\ndisturbance which acts on it in a non-Markovian fashion.

The variance of the temperature time series just\nabove the internal wave frequency band is well correlated with the Thorpe\nscale. The method is based on the time--frequency decomposition of variance\ncalled \"maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform\". The results show that the\nEllison length scale can be a viable alternative to the Thorpe scale for\nindirectly estimating turbulence dissipation rate from moored instruments in\nthe ocean if time resolution is sufficiently high.

We find that the\ncombination of these three statistics can break the degeneracy between $b_1$,\n$f$ and $\\sigma_8$. For dark matter particles the new model can be used to\nrecover $f$ and $\\sigma_8$ with $\\sim1%$ accuracy. For dark matter haloes we\nfind that $f$ and $\\sigma_8$ present larger systematic shifts, $\\sim10%$. The\nsystematic offsets arise because of limitations in the modelling of the\ninterplay between bias and redshift space distortions, and represent a\nlimitation as the statistical errors of forthcoming surveys reach this level.\nConveniently, we find that these residual systematics are mitigated for\ncombinations of parameters. The improvement on the modelling of the bispectrum\npresented in this paper will be useful for extracting information from current\nand future galaxy surveys.

These techniques are (a) from defining a local set of\nEulerian coordinates embedded into the Lagrangian frame; (b) from performing a\nspecific gauge transformation; and (c) from a fully non-perturbative approach\nbased on the ADM split. The latter approach shows that this decomposition is\nnot tied to a specific perturbative formulation for the solution of the\nEinstein equations.

Studying such different techniques is useful because it allows us\nto compare and develop further the various approximation techniques available\nin the Lagrangian formulation.

This naturally\nprovides a direct constraint on the relationship between lepton kinematics and\nneutrino energy.

For a search in the space of all possible topologies of the\nconnected network with N nodes and L links, genetic operators such as mutation\nand crossover are applied to the adjacency matrix through a string\nrepresentation. In the context of graphs, the mutation of strings in genetic\nalgorithm corresponds to the rewiring of graphs, while crossover corresponds to\nthe interchange of the sub-graphs. For small networks where the most reliable\nnetwork can be found by exhaustive search, genetic algorithm is very efficient.\nFor larger networks, our results not only demonstrate the efficiency of our\nalgorithm, but also suggest that the most reliable network will have high\nsymmetry.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables"]}]

Many\nSGB operators that extend SQL have been proposed in the literature, e.g.,\nsimilarity operators in the one-dimensional space. These operators have various\nsemantics. Depending on how these operators are implemented, some of the\nimplementations may lead to different groupings of the data. Hence, if SQL code\nis ported from one database system to another, it is not guaranteed that the\ncode will produce the same results. In this paper, we investigate the various\nsemantics for the relational similarity group-by operators in the\nmulti-dimensional space. We define the class of order-independent SGB operators\nthat produce the same results regardless of the order in which the input data\nis presented to them. Using the notion of interval graphs borrowed from graph\ntheory, we prove that, for certain SGB operators, there exist order-independent\nimplementations. For each of these operators, we provide a sample algorithm\nthat is order-independent. Also, we prove that for other SGB operators, there\ndoes not exist an order-independent implementation for them, and hence these\nSGB operators are ill-defined and should not be adopted in extensions to SQL to\nrealize similarity group-by. In this paper, we introduce an SGB operator,\nnamely SGB-All, for grouping multi-dimensional data using similarity. SGB-All\nforms groups such that a data item, say O, belongs to a group, say G, if and\nonly if O is within a user-defined threshold from all other data items in G. In\nother words, each group in SGB-All forms a clique of nearby data items in the\nmulti-dimensional space. We prove that SGB-All are order-independent, i.e.,\nthere is at least one algorithm for each option that is independent of the\npresentation order of the input data.\n","Comment: 13 pages"]}]

Compressive sensing (CS) is a novel data\nacquisition method whereby the compression is done in a sensor simultaneously\nwith the sampling. If the original sensed signal is sufficiently sparse in\nterms of some basis, the decompression can be done essentially perfectly up to\nsome critical compression ratio. In this article, a Bayesian compressive\nsensing (BCS) method is investigated that uses sparse Bayesian learning to\nreconstruct signals from a compressive sensor. By explicitly quantifying the\nuncertainty in the reconstructed signal, the BCS technique exhibits an obvious\nbenefit over existing regularized norm-minimization CS methods that provide a\nsingle signal estimate. However, current BCS algorithms suffer from a\nrobustness problem: sometimes the reconstruction errors are very large when the\nnumber of measurements is a lot less than the number of signal degrees of\nfreedom that are needed to capture the signal accurately in a directly sampled\nform. In this paper, we present improvements to the BCS reconstruction method\nto enhance its robustness so that even higher compression ratios can be used\nand we examine the tradeoff between efficiently compressing data and accurately\ndecompressing it. Synthetic data and actual acceleration data collected from a\nbridge SHM system are used as examples. Compared with the state-of-the-art BCS\nreconstruction algorithms, the improved BCS algorithm demonstrates superior\nperformance. With the same reconstruction error, the proposed BCS algorithm\nworks with relatively large compression ratios and it can achieve perfect\nlossless compression performance with quite high compression ratios.\nFurthermore, the error bars for the signal reconstruction are also quantified\neffectively.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 14 figures, 2 tables"]}]

This value indicates the dimension of the Hilbert space of these\nquantum knot system. $D^{(m,n)}$ is already found for $m,n \\leq 6$ by the\nauthors.\n  In this paper, we construct an algorithm producing the precise value of\n$D^{(m,n)}$ for $m,n \\geq 2$ that uses recurrence relations of state matrices\nthat turn out to be remarkably efficient to count knot mosaics. $$ D^{(m,n)} =\n2 \\, \\| (X_{m-2}+O_{m-2})^{n-2} \\| $$ where $2^{m-2} \\times 2^{m-2}$ matrices\n$X_{m-2}$ and $O_{m-2}$ are defined by $$ X_{k+1} = \\begin{bmatrix} X_k & O_k\n\\\\ O_k & X_k \\end{bmatrix} \\ \\mbox{and } \\ O_{k+1} = \\begin{bmatrix} O_k & X_k\n\\\\ X_k & 4 \\, O_k \\end{bmatrix} $$ for $k=0,1, \\cdots, m-3$, with $1 \\times 1$\nmatrices $X_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $O_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1\n\\end{bmatrix}$. Here $\\|N\\|$ denotes the sum of all entries of a matrix $N$.\nFor $n=2$, $(X_{m-2}+O_{m-2})^0$ means the identity matrix of size $2^{m-2}\n\\times 2^{m-2}$.\n"]}]

The main reason for the\nfeasibility to develop such a high-order scheme with compact stencil, which\ninvolves only neighboring cells, is due to the use of a high-order gas\nevolution model. Besides the evaluation of the time-dependent flux function\nacross a cell interface, the high-order gas evolution model also provides an\naccurate time-dependent solution of the flow variables at a cell interface.\nTherefore, the current scheme not only updates the cell averaged conservative\nflow variables inside each control volume, but also tracks the flow variables\nat the cell interface at the next time level. As a result, with both cell\naveraged and cell interface values the high-order reconstruction in the current\nscheme can be done compactly. Different from using a weak formulation for\nhigh-order accuracy in the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, the current\nscheme is based on the strong solution, where the flow evolution starting from\na piecewise discontinuous high-order initial data is precisely followed. The\ncell interface time-dependent flow variables can be used for the initial data\nreconstruction at the beginning of next time step. Even with compact stencil,\nthe current scheme has third-order accuracy in the smooth flow regions, and has\nfavorable shock capturing property in the discontinuous regions. Many test\ncases are used to validate the current scheme.

A widely used measure of scientific\nimpact is citations, with a growing body of literature focused on predicting\nthe number of citations obtained by any given publication. The effectiveness of\nsuch predictions, however, is fundamentally limited by the power-law\ndistribution of citations, whereby publications with few citations are\nextremely common and publications with many citations are relatively rare.\nGiven this limitation, in this work we instead address a related question asked\nby many academic researchers in the course of writing a paper, namely: \"Will\nthis paper increase my h-index?\" Using a real academic dataset with over 1.7\nmillion authors, 2 million papers, and 8 million citation relationships from\nthe premier online academic service ArnetMiner, we formalize a novel scientific\nimpact prediction problem to examine several factors that can drive a paper to\nincrease the primary author's h-index. We find that the researcher's authority\non the publication topic and the venue in which the paper is published are\ncrucial factors to the increase of the primary author's h-index, while the\ntopic popularity and the co-authors' h-indices are of surprisingly little\nrelevance. By leveraging relevant factors, we find a greater than 87.5%\npotential predictability for whether a paper will contribute to an author's\nh-index within five years. As a further experiment, we generate a\nself-prediction for this paper, estimating that there is a 76% probability that\nit will contribute to the h-index of the co-author with the highest current\nh-index in five years.
