A key breakthrough in the pursuit of these exotic particles\noriginated from Read and Green's observation that the Moore-Read quantum Hall\nstate and a (relatively simple) two-dimensional p+ip superconductor both\nsupport so-called Ising non-Abelian anyons. Here we establish a similar\ncorrespondence between the Z_3 Read-Rezayi quantum Hall state and a novel\ntwo-dimensional superconductor in which charge-2e Cooper pairs are built from\nfractionalized quasiparticles. In particular, both phases harbor Fibonacci\nanyons that---unlike Ising anyons---allow for universal topological quantum\ncomputation solely through braiding. Using a variant of Teo and Kane's\nconstruction of non-Abelian phases from weakly coupled chains, we provide a\nblueprint for such a superconductor using Abelian quantum Hall states\ninterlaced with an array of superconducting islands. Fibonacci anyons appear as\nneutral deconfined particles that lead to a two-fold ground-state degeneracy on\na torus. In contrast to a p+ip superconductor, vortices do not yield additional\nparticle types yet depending on non-universal energetics can serve as a trap\nfor Fibonacci anyons.

The most abundant amino acid, leucine, is nearly an order\nof magnitude more prevalent than the least abundant amino acid, cysteine. Amino\nacid metabolic costs differ similarly, constraining their incorporation into\nproteins. On the other hand, sequence diversity is necessary for protein\nfolding, function and evolution. Here we present a simple model for a\ncost-diversity trade-off postulating that natural proteomes minimize amino acid\nmetabolic flux while maximizing sequence entropy. The model explains the\nrelative abundances of amino acids across a diverse set of proteomes. We found\nthat the data is remarkably well explained when the cost function accounts for\namino acid chemical decay. More than one hundred proteomes reach comparable\nsolutions to the trade-off by different combinations of cost and diversity.\nQuantifying the interplay between proteome size and entropy shows that\nproteomes can get optimally large and diverse.\n"]}]

The unusual event, visible to the naked eye over NYC, can allow to\nmeasure the shape of the asteroid, with reaching a space resolution below the\ndiffraction limit of the eye, and of all instruments not based on\ninterferometry. Ultimately the aperture of the instrument is related to the\namount of scintillation affecting the light curve of the occultation,\nlimitating the accuracy of video recorded data. The asteroid profile scans the\nsurface of the star at a velocity of 6 mas/s; the diameter of the star is about\n1.3 mas and the detection of the stellar limb darkening signature is discussed,\ntaking into consideration also the Fresnel fringes. New data reduction with\nR-OTE software of the 2005 Regulus occultation and simulations of the 2014\noccultation with Fren_difl software are presented.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 9 figures, submitted to J. of Occultation Astronomy ISSN\n  0737-6766"]}]
