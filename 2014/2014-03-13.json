The aim is to find\nsignatures of the energy dependence of the barrier by comparing fusion\ncross-sections calculated from potentials obtained at different bombarding\nenergies with the experimental data. This comparison is made for the\n$^{40}$Ca+$^{40}$Ca and $^{16}$O+$^{208}$Pb systems. Fusion cross-sections are\ncomputed from potentials calculated with the density-constrained TDHF method.\nThe couplings decrease the barrier at low-energy in both cases. A deviation\nfrom the Woods-Saxon nuclear potential is also observed at the lowest energies.\nIn general, fusion cross-sections around a given energy are better reproduced\nby the potential calculated at this energy. The coordinate-dependent mass plays\na crucial role for the reproduction of sub-barrier fusion cross-sections.\nEffects of the energy dependence of the potential can be found in experimental\nbarrier distributions only if the variation of the barrier is significant in\nthe energy-range spanned by the distribution. It appears to be the case for\n$^{16}$O+$^{208}$Pb but not for $^{40}$Ca+$^{40}$Ca. These results show that\nthe energy dependence of the barrier predicted in TDHF calculations is\nrealistic. This confirms that the TDHF approach can be used to study the\ncouplings between relative motion and internal degrees of freedom in heavy-ion\ncollisions.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 10 figures"]}]

How does user information posting and seeking behavior\ninteract with the evolution of the underlying social network structure?\n  Here, we study ways in which network structure reacts to users posting and\nsharing content. We examine the complete dynamics of the Twitter information\nnetwork, where users post and reshare information while they also create and\ndestroy connections.

These bursts transform users' networks of followers to\nbecome structurally more cohesive as well as more homogenous in terms of\nfollower interests.

We explain these\nchanges with a comprehensive yet straightforward model of how teams of\ndifferent sizes emerge and grow. This model accurately reproduces the evolution\nof empirical team-size distribution over the period of 50 years. The modeling\nreveals that there are two modes of knowledge production. The first and more\nfundamental mode employs relatively small, core teams. Core teams form by a\nPoisson process and produce a Poisson distribution of team sizes in which\nlarger teams are exceedingly rare. The second mode employs extended teams,\nwhich started as core teams, but subsequently accumulated new members\nproportional to the past productivity of their members. Given time, this mode\ngives rise to a power-law tail of large teams (10-1000 members), which features\nin many fields today. Based on this model we construct an analytical functional\nform that allows the contribution of different modes of authorship to be\ndetermined directly from the data and is applicable to any field. The model\nalso offers a solid foundation for studying other social aspects of science,\nsuch as productivity and collaboration.\n","Comment: Published in PNAS. Model tested on astronomy.

Characterizing the\ncomposition and thermal and dynamical structure of the outflow provides\nconstraints that are essential for understanding AGB evolution, including the\nrate of mass loss and isotopic ratios.\n  We modeled the CO emission from the wind of the low mass-loss rate\noxygen-rich AGB star W Hya using data obtained by the HIFI, PACS, and SPIRE\ninstruments onboard the Herschel Space Observatory and ground-based telescopes.\n$^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO lines are used to constrain the intrinsic\n$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio from resolved HIFI lines.\n  The acceleration of the outflow up to about 5.5 km/s is quite slow and can be\nrepresented by a beta-type velocity law with index 5. Beyond this point,\nacceleration up the terminal velocity of 7 km/s is faster. Using the J=10-9,\n9-8, and 6-5 transitions, we find an intrinsic $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of\n$18\\pm10$ for W Hya, where the error bar is mostly due to uncertainties in the\n$^{12}$CO abundance and the stellar flux around 4.6 $\\mu$m. To match the\nlow-excitation CO lines, these molecules need to be photo-dissociated at about\n500 stellar radii. The radial dust emission intensity profile measured by PACS\nimages at 70 $\\mu$m shows substantially stronger emission than our model\npredicts beyond 20 arcsec.\n  The initial slow acceleration of the wind implies inefficient wind driving in\nthe lower part of the envelope. The final injection of momentum in the wind\nmight be the result of an increase in the opacity thanks to the late\ncondensation of dust species.

To\nminimize power consumption, the protocol parameters have to be optimized for a\ngiven application. Therefore, an energy-model that can predict the energy\nconsumption of a BLE-based wireless device for different parameter value\nsettings, is needed.

The multiscale model is divided\ninto three main phases: (i) in step 0, the elastic constants of collagen-water\nand mineral-water composites are calculated by averaging the upper and lower\nHill bounds; (ii) in step 1, the elastic properties of the collagen microfibril\nare computed using a trained neural network simulation.

The neural network outputs (elastic\nproperties of the microfibril) are used as inputs for the homogenisation\ncomputation to determine the properties of mineralised collagen fibril.

In all these applications, van der Waals forces\ndominate the interaction between the small guest molecules and the walls of the\nMOFs. In this review article, we describe how a combined theoretical and\nexperimental approach can successfully be used to study those weak interactions\nand elucidate the adsorption mechanisms important for various applications. On\nthe theory side, we show that, while standard density functional theory is not\ncapable of correctly describing van der Waals interactions, functionals\nespecially designed to include van der Waals forces exist, yielding results in\nremarkable agreement with experiment. From the experimental point of view, we\nshow examples in which IR adsorption and Raman spectroscopy are essential to\nstudy molecule/MOF interactions. Importantly, we emphasize throughout this\nreview that a combination of theory and experiment is crucial to effectively\ngain further understanding. In particular, we review such combined studies for\nthe adsorption mechanism of small molecules in MOFs, the chemical stability of\nMOFs under humid conditions, water cluster formation inside MOFs, and the\ndiffusion of small molecules into MOFs. The understanding of these phenomena is\ncritical for the rational design of new MOFs with desired properties.\n"]}]

While the\ncharge stripe ordering temperature TCO is independent of the magnetic field,\nthere is a significant shift of the spin stripe ordering temperature TSO of\nabout 1.5 K/ Tesla, if the magnetic fields are applied parallel to the\nNiO2-planes.
