We characterize the system behavior, establishing that only some\nconfigurations are possible. In particular we discover that coexistence of the\ntwo strains is not possible, under the assumptions of the model. A number of\ntranscritical bifurcations relate the more relevant system's equilibria.\nBistability is shown between a situation in which only the disease-unaffected\npopulation thrives and another one containing only the second population with\nendemic disease. An accurate computation of the separating surface of the\nbasins of attraction of these two mutually exclusive equilibria is obtained via\nnovel results in approximation theory.\n"]}]
