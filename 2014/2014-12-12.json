Using the Landauer-Buttiker formalism, we derive\ngeneral expressions for these quantities and consider their possible\nrelationships in the entire ranges of temperature, voltage and coupling to the\nenvironment or reservoirs. We introduce a dimensionless quantity given by the\nratio between the product of mixed noises and the product of charge and heat\nnoises, distinguishing between the auto-ratio defined in the same reservoir and\nthe cross-ratio between distinct reservoirs. From the linear response regime to\nthe high-voltage regime, we further specify the analytical expressions of\ndifferential conductances, noises and ratios of noises, and examine their\nbehavior in two concrete nanosystems: a quantum point contact in an ohmic\nenvironment and a single energy level quantum dot connected to reservoirs. In\nthe linear response regime, we find that these ratios are equal to each other\nand are simply related to the figure of merit. They can be expressed in terms\nof differential conductances with the help of the fluctuation-dissipation\ntheorem. In the non-linear regime, these ratios radically distinguish between\nthemselves as the auto-ratio remains bounded by one, while the cross-ratio\nexhibits rich and complex behaviors. In the quantum dot nanosystem, we moreover\ndemonstrate that the thermoelectric efficiency can be expressed as a ratio of\nnoises in the non-linear Schottky regime. In the intermediate voltage regime,\nthe cross-ratio changes sign and diverges, which evidences a change of sign in\nthe heat cross-noise.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables"]}]

It is therefore crucial to examine possible\ncorrections to quantum mechanics due to gravity. Indeed, the Heisenberg\nUncertainty Principle is one profound feature of quantum mechanics, which\nnevertheless may receive correction when gravitational effects become\nimportant. Such generalized uncertainty principle [GUP] has been motivated from\nnot only quite general considerations of quantum mechanics and gravity, but\nalso string theoretic arguments. We examine the role of GUP in the context of\nblack hole complementarity. We find that while complementarity can be violated\nby large N rescaling if one assumes only the Heisenberg's Uncertainty\nPrinciple, the application of GUP may save complementarity, but only if certain\nN-dependence is also assumed. This raises two important questions beyond the\nscope of this work, i.e., whether GUP really has the proposed form of\nN-dependence, and whether black hole complementarity is indeed correct.\n","Comment: Added footnote 5; version accepted by JHEP"]}]

We find a non-monotonic variation of the hairpin closing\ntime with temperature, in agreement with the experimental work of Wallace et\nal. [Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 2001, 98, 5584-5589]. The hairpin closing\nprocess involves the formation of an initial nucleus of one or two bonds\nbetween the stems followed by a rapid zippering of the stem. At high\ntemperatures, typically above the hairpin melting temperature, an effective\nnegative activation enthalpy is observed because the nucleus has a lower\nenthalpy than the open state. By contrast, at low temperatures, the activation\nenthalpy becomes positive mainly due to the increasing energetic cost of\nbending a loop that becomes increasingly highly stacked as the temperature\ndecreases. We show that stacking must be very strong to induce this\nexperimentally observed behavior, and that the existence of just a few weak\nstacking points along the loop can substantially suppress it. Non-native base\npairs are observed to have only a small effect, slightly accelerating hairpin\nformation.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 9 figures"]}]

For very big matrices a low rank approximation using SVD\nis not computationally feasible. In this case different approximations are\navailable. It seems that variants of CUR decomposition are most suitable. For\nd-mode tensors T with d>2, many generalizations of the singular value\ndecomposition have been proposed to obtain low tensor rank decompositions. The\nmost appropriate approximation seems to be best (r_1,...,r_d)-approximation,\nwhich maximizes the l_2 norm of the projection of T on a tensor product of\nsubspaces U_1,...,U_d, where U_i is an r_i-dimensional subspace. One of the\nmost common method is the alternating maximization method (AMM). It is obtained\nby maximizing on one subspace U_i, while keeping all other fixed, and\nalternating the procedure repeatedly for i=1,...,d. Usually, AMM will converge\nto a local best approximation.

For low dimensional problems, one of the most popular numerical\nprocedures for consistent inference is the class of approximations termed\nparticle filters or sequential Monte Carlo methods. However, in high\ndimensions, standard particle filters (e.g. the bootstrap particle filter) can\nhave a cost that is exponential in $d$ for the algorithm to be stable in an\nappropriate sense. We develop a new particle filter, called the\n\\emph{space-time particle filter}, for a specific family of state-space models\nin discrete time. This new class of particle filters provide consistent Monte\nCarlo estimates for any fixed $d$, as do standard particle filters. Moreover,\nwe expect that the state-space particle filter will scale much better with $d$\nthan the standard filter.

Some sign problems that had remained\nunsolved earlier can be solved within this framework. In this work we argue\nthat the fermion bag also gives insight into a new mechanism of fermion mass\ngeneration, especially at strong couplings where fermion masses are related to\nthe fermion bag size. On the other hand, chiral condensates arise due to zero\nmodes in the Dirac operator within a fermion bag. Although in traditional\nfour-fermion models the two quantities seem to be related, we show that they\ncan be decoupled. While fermion bags become small at strong couplings, the\nability of zero modes of the Dirac operator within fermion bags to produce a\nchiral condensate, can be suppressed by the presence of additional zero modes\nfrom other fermions. Thus, fermions can become massive even without a chiral\ncondensate. This new mechanism of mass generation was discovered long ago in\nlattice field theory, but has remained unappreciated. Recent work suggests that\nit may be of interest even in continuum quantum field theory.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 6 figures; talk presented at the 32nd International\n  Symposium on Lattice Field Theory, 23-28 June, 2014, Columbia University, New\n  York, USA"]}]

Analytical predictions and numerical\nsimulations of the complete equations within the Inertial\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (ILLG) model are presented. In addition to the usual\nprecession resonance, the inertial model gives a second resonance peak\nassociated to the nutation dynamics provided that the damping is not too large.\nThe analytical resolution of the equations of motion yields both the precession\nand nutation angular frequencies. They are function of the inertial dynamics\ncharacteristic time $\\tau$, the dimensionless damping $\\alpha$ and the static\nmagnetic field $H$. A scaling function with respect to $\\alpha\\tau\\gamma H$ is\nfound for the nutation angular frequency, also valid for the precession angular\nfrequency when $\\alpha\\tau\\gamma H\\gg 1$. Beyond the direct measurement of the\nnutation resonance peak, we show that the inertial dynamics of the\nmagnetization has measurable effects on both the width and the angular\nfrequency of the precession resonance peak when varying the applied static\nfield. These predictions could be used to experimentally identify the inertial\ndynamics of the magnetization proposed in the ILLG model.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 9 figures"]}]
