The chiral description\nsimplifies computations of the constraint algebra, and allows us to perform the\ncomplete canonical analysis of the system. In particular, we explicitly compute\nthe secondary constraint and carry out the stabilization procedure, thus\nproving that in general the theory propagates 7 degrees of freedom,\nconsistently with previous claims. Finally, we point out that the description\nin terms of 2-forms opens the door to an infinite class of ghost-free massive\nbi-gravity actions. Our results apply directly to Euclidean signature. The\nreality conditions to be imposed in the Lorentzian signature appear to be more\ncomplicated than in the usual gravity case and are left as an open issue.\n","Comment: 26 pages; extended discussion of reality conditions, added references"]}]

Multiple choice (or labeling) questions could be\nreferred to as a common type of problem which is solved by this approach. As an\napplication, crowd labeling is applied to find true labels for large machine\nlearning datasets. Since crowds are not necessarily experts, the labels they\nprovide are rather noisy and erroneous. This challenge is usually resolved by\ncollecting multiple labels for each sample, and then aggregating them to\nestimate the true label. Although the mechanism leads to high-quality labels,\nit is not actually cost-effective. As a result, efforts are currently made to\nmaximize the accuracy in estimating true labels, while fixing the number of\nacquired labels.\n  This paper surveys methods to aggregate redundant crowd labels in order to\nestimate unknown true labels. It presents a unified statistical latent model\nwhere the differences among popular methods in the field correspond to\ndifferent choices for the parameters of the model. Afterwards, algorithms to\nmake inference on these models will be surveyed.

Our starting point is the experimental observation\nthat RM codes have a smaller error probability than polar codes under MAP\ndecoding. This motivates us to introduce a family of codes that \"interpolates\"\nbetween RM and polar codes, call this family ${\\mathcal C}_{\\rm inter} =\n\\{C_{\\alpha} : \\alpha \\in [0, 1]\\}$, where $C_{\\alpha} \\big |_{\\alpha = 1}$ is\nthe original polar code, and $C_{\\alpha} \\big |_{\\alpha = 0}$ is an RM code.\nBased on numerical observations, we remark that the error probability under MAP\ndecoding is an increasing function of $\\alpha$. MAP decoding has in general\nexponential complexity, but empirically the performance of polar codes at\nfinite block lengths is boosted by moving along the family ${\\mathcal C}_{\\rm\ninter}$ even under low-complexity decoding schemes such as, for instance,\nbelief propagation or successive cancellation list decoder. We demonstrate the\nperformance gain via numerical simulations for transmission over the erasure\nchannel as well as the Gaussian channel.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 7 figures, in IEEE Transactions on Communications, 2014 and\n  in ISIT'14"]}]

CS theory enables exact reconstruction\nof a sparse signal from relatively few linear measurements via a suitable\nnonlinear minimization process. Conventional CS theory relies on vectorial data\nrepresentation, which results in good compression ratios at the expense of\nincreased computational complexity. In applications involving color images,\nvideo sequences, and multi-sensor networks, the data is intrinsically of\nhigh-order, and thus more suitably represented in tensorial form.

We demonstrate that GTCS offers an efficient means for\nrepresentation of multidimensional data by providing simultaneous acquisition\nand compression from all tensor modes.

We find that for $\\lambda''\n\\simeq {\\mathcal{O}}(0.3)$ light stop masses as low as 220 GeV are consistent\nwith the observed Higgs mass as well as flavour constraints while allowing for\na stable vacuum. The light stop in this scenario is often the lightest\nsupersymmetric particle.

Despite its popularity, SVM has a\nserious drawback, that is sensitivity to outliers in training samples. The\npenalty on misclassification is defined by a convex loss called the hinge loss,\nand the unboundedness of the convex loss causes the sensitivity to outliers. To\ndeal with outliers, robust variants of SVM have been proposed, such as the\nrobust outlier detection algorithm and an SVM with a bounded loss called the\nramp loss.

The major difficulties are associated with ill-posed boundary\nconditions, the missing angular (moment) equilibrium equation and the\nappearance of a non-physical extraneous vectorial electrostatic law. Therefore,\nthe strain gradient flexoelectricity must be classified as an inconsistent\ntheory. The present investigation further reveals that the new size-dependent\npiezoelectricity is the more consistent theory to describe linear\nelectromechanical coupling in dielectrics. Some new aspects of this theory are\npresented for isotropic and centrosymmetric cubic dielectric materials, whose\ncoupling effect is described by only one parameter.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 2 figures"]}]

The result is not only congestion and poor\nQuality-of-Experience, but also an unprecedented energy drain at both the\nnetwork and user devices. In order to sustain this continued growth, novel\ndisruptive paradigms of media delivery are urgently needed. We envision that\ntwo key contemporary advancements can be leveraged to develop greener media\ndelivery platforms: 1) the proliferation of navigation hardware and software in\nmobile devices has created an era of location-awareness, where both the current\nand future user locations can be predicted; and 2) the rise of context-aware\nnetwork architectures and self-organizing functionalities is enabling context\nsignaling and in-network adaptation. With these developments in mind, this\narticle investigates the opportunities of exploiting location-awareness to\nenable green end-to-end media delivery. In particular, we discuss and propose\napproaches for location-based adaptive video quality planning, in-network\ncaching, content prefetching, and long-term radio resource management. To\nprovide insights on the energy savings, we then present a cross-layer framework\nthat jointly optimizes resource allocation and multi-user video quality using\nlocation predictions. Finally, we highlight some of the future research\ndirections for location-aware media delivery in the conclusion.\n"]}]

However, identifying this circuitry\nrequires time-consuming, manual tracing (proofreading) due to the size and\nintricacy of these image datasets, thus limiting state-of-the-art analysis to\nvery small brain regions. Potential avenues to improve scalability include\nautomatic image segmentation and crowd sourcing, but current efforts have had\nlimited success. In this paper, we propose a new strategy, focused\nproofreading, that works with automatic segmentation and aims to limit\nproofreading to the regions of a dataset that are most impactful to the\nresulting circuit. We then introduce a novel workflow, which exploits\nbiological information such as synapses, and apply it to a large dataset in the\nfly optic lobe. With our techniques, we achieve significant tracing speedups of\n3-5x without sacrificing the quality of the resulting circuit. Furthermore, our\nmethodology makes the task of proofreading much more accessible and hence\npotentially enhances the effectiveness of crowd sourcing.\n"]}]

The problem is defined on two\ndifferent data domains sharing the same input and output spaces, named as\nsource domain and target domain. The outputs are structured, and for the data\nsamples of the source domain, the corresponding outputs are available, while\nfor most data samples of the target domain, the corresponding outputs are\nmissing. The input distributions of the two domains are significantly\ndifferent. The problem is to learn a predictor for the target domain to predict\nthe structured outputs from the input. Due to the limited number of outputs\navailable for the samples form the target domain, it is difficult to directly\nlearn the predictor from the target domain, thus it is necessary to use the\noutput information available in source domain. We propose to learn the target\ndomain predictor by adapting a auxiliary predictor trained by using source\ndomain data to the target domain. The adaptation is implemented by adding a\ndelta function on the basis of the auxiliary predictor. An algorithm is\ndeveloped to learn the parameter of the delta function to minimize loss\nfunctions associat- ed with the predicted outputs against the true outputs of\nthe data samples with available outputs of the target domain.\n"]}]
