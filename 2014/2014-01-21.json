Its predictions range from the existence of black holes, gravitational\nradiation to the cosmological models, predicting a primordial beginning, namely\nthe big-bang. All these solutions have been obtained by first considering a\nplausible distribution of matter, and through the Einstein field equation, the\nspacetime metric of the geometry is determined. However, one may solve the\nEinstein field equation in the reverse direction, namely, one first considers\nan interesting and exotic spacetime metric, then finds the matter source\nresponsible for the respective geometry. In this manner, it was found that some\nof these solutions possess a peculiar property, namely 'exotic matter,'\ninvolving a stress-energy tensor that violates the null energy condition. These\ngeometries also allow closed timelike curves, with the respective causality\nviolations. These solutions are primarily useful as 'gedanken-experiments' and\nas a theoretician's probe of the foundations of general relativity, and include\ntraversable wormholes and superluminal 'warp drive' spacetimes. Thus, one may\nbe tempted to denote these geometries as 'exotic' solutions of the Einstein\nfield equation, as they violate the energy conditions and generate closed\ntimelike curves. In this article, in addition to extensively exploring\ninteresting features, in particular, the physical properties and\ncharacteristics of these 'exotic spacetimes,' we also analyze other non-trivial\ngeneral relativistic geometries which generate closed timelike curves.\n","Comment: 52 pages, 20 figures, RevTex4.

We expect the jet's acceleration to produce a GW\nMemory signal. While all relativistic jet models display anti-beaming of GW\nradiation away from the jet axis, thus radiating away from directions of GRBs'\ngamma radiation, this effect is not overwhelming. The decrease of the signal\namplitude towards the cone of gamma-ray detectability is weak, and for some\nmodels and parameters the GW signal reaches a significant amplitude for much of\nthe gamma-ray cone. Thus both signals may be jointly detected. We find\ndifferent waveforms and fourier signatures for uniform jets and structured jet\nmodels - thus offering a method of using GW signatures to probe the internal\nstructure and acceleration of GRB jets. The GW signal peaks just outside the\njet (core) of a uniform (structuted) jet. Within the jet (core) the GW signal\ndisplays wiggles, due to a polarization effect; thus for a uniform jet, the\npeak amplitude accompanies a smoother signal than the peak of a structured jet.\nFor the most probable detection angle and for typical GRB parameters, we expect\nfrequencies < ~600Hz and amplitudes h~10^-25.

However, sensitivies of ~10^-25/sqrt(Hz)\nin the DECIGO band should suffice to detect typical long GRBs at 2Gpc and short\nGRBs at 200Mpc, implying a monthly event of a long GRB and a detection of a\nshort GRB every decade.

Motivated by this experimental finding, we decided to perform a\nsystematic theoretical investigation of the nature of the ground, and the\nlow-lying excited states of long acenes, with an emphasis on the\nsinglet-triplet gap, starting from naphthalene, all the way up to decacene.\nMethodology adopted in our work is based upon Pariser-Parr-Pople model (PPP)\nHamiltonian, along with large-scale multi-reference singles-doubles\nconfiguration interaction (MRSDCI) approach. Our results predict that even\nthough the singlet-triplet gap decreases with the increasing conjugation\nlength, nevertheless, it remains finite till decacene, thus providing no\nevidence of the predicted singlet-triplet crossover. We also analyze the nature\nof many-particle wavefunction of the correlated singlet ground state and find\nthat the longer acenes exhibit tendency towards a open-shell singlet ground\nstate. Moreover, when we compare the experimental absorption spectra of\noctacene and nonacene with their calculated singlet and triplet absorption\nspectra, we observe excellent agreement for the singlet case. Hence, the\noptical absorption results also confirm the singlet nature of the ground state\nfor longer acenes.\n","Comment: 58 pages (including supplementary information), 12 figures (included)"]}]

Protein contact map describes the pairwise spatial and functional\nrelationship of residues in a protein and contains key information for protein\n3D structure prediction. Although studied extensively, it remains very\nchallenging to predict contact map using only sequence information. Most\nexisting methods predict the contact map matrix element-by-element, ignoring\ncorrelation among contacts and physical feasibility of the whole contact map. A\ncouple of recent methods predict contact map based upon residue co-evolution,\ntaking into consideration contact correlation and enforcing a sparsity\nrestraint, but these methods require a very large number of sequence homologs\nfor the protein under consideration and the resultant contact map may be still\nphysically unfavorable.\n  Results. This paper presents a novel method PhyCMAP for contact map\nprediction, integrating both evolutionary and physical restraints by machine\nlearning and integer linear programming (ILP). The evolutionary restraints\ninclude sequence profile, residue co-evolution and context-specific statistical\npotential. The physical restraints specify more concrete relationship among\ncontacts than the sparsity restraint. As such, our method greatly reduces the\nsolution space of the contact map matrix and thus, significantly improves\nprediction accuracy. Experimental results confirm that PhyCMAP outperforms\ncurrently popular methods no matter how many sequence homologs are available\nfor the protein under consideration. PhyCMAP can predict contacts within\nminutes after PSIBLAST search for sequence homologs is done, much faster than\nthe two recent methods PSICOV and EvFold.\n  See http://raptorx.uchicago.edu for the web server.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 13 figures, 10 tables"]}]

Here we present\ntwo practical schemes for calculating the GSF using a radiation-gauge\nreconstructed metric as input.

By using\nthis obtained equation, it is possible to estimate unknown thickness of the Si\nthin film.

The most significant\nfeature of this method is that no expensive instruments are required.

The most important properties of unfounded sets and the well-founded\nsemantics for standard LP are retained by this generalization, notably\nexistence and uniqueness of the well-founded model, together with a strong\nrelationship to the answer set semantics for LPAma programs. We show that one\nof the D-well-founded semantics, defined by Pelov, Denecker, and Bruynooghe for\na broader class of aggregates using approximating operators, coincides with the\nwell-founded model as defined in this work on LPAma programs. We also discuss\nsome complexity issues, most importantly we give a formal proof of tractable\ncomputation of the well-founded model for LPA programs. Moreover, we prove that\nfor general LPA programs, which may contain aggregates that are neither\nmonotone nor antimonotone, deciding satisfaction of aggregate expressions with\nrespect to partial interpretations is coNP-complete. As a consequence, a\nwell-founded semantics for general LPA programs that allows for tractable\ncomputation is unlikely to exist, which justifies the restriction on LPAma\nprograms. Finally, we present a prototype system extending DLV, which supports\nthe well-founded semantics for LPAma programs, at the time of writing the only\nimplemented system that does so. Experiments with this prototype show\nsignificant computational advantages of aggregate constructs over equivalent\naggregate-free encodings.\n"]}]

Weighted constraint\nsatisfaction is a framework for modeling such problems, which consists of a set\nof cost functions to measure the degree of violation or preferences of\ndifferent combinations of variable assignments. Typical solution methods for\nweighted constraint satisfaction problems (WCSPs) are based on branch-and-bound\nsearch, which are made practical through the use of powerful consistency\ntechniques such as AC*, FDAC*, EDAC* to deduce hidden cost information and\nvalue pruning during search. These techniques, however, are designed to be\nefficient only on binary and ternary cost functions which are represented in\ntable form. In tackling many real-life problems, high arity (or global) cost\nfunctions are required. We investigate efficient representation scheme and\nalgorithms to bring the benefits of the consistency techniques to also high\narity cost functions, which are often derived from hard global constraints from\nclassical constraint satisfaction. The literature suggests some global cost\nfunctions can be represented as flow networks, and the minimum cost flow\nalgorithm can be used to compute the minimum costs of such networks in\npolynomial time. We show that naive adoption of this flow-based algorithmic\nmethod for global cost functions can result in a stronger form of null-inverse\nconsistency. We further show how the method can be modified to handle cost\nprojections and extensions to maintain generalized versions of AC* and FDAC*\nfor cost functions with more than two variables. Similar generalization for the\nstronger EDAC* is less straightforward. We reveal the oscillation problem when\nenforcing EDAC* on cost functions sharing more than one variable. To avoid\noscillation, we propose a weak version of EDAC* and generalize it to weak\nEDGAC* for non-binary cost functions. Using various benchmarks involving the\nsoft variants of hard global constraints ALLDIFFERENT, GCC, SAME, and REGULAR,\nempirical results demonstrate that our proposal gives improvements of up to an\norder of magnitude when compared with the traditional constraint optimization\napproach, both in terms of time and pruning.\n"]}]

The Bhattacharyya upper bound can further be tightened\nusing the Chernoff information that relies on the notion of best error\nexponent. In this paper, we first express Bayes' risk using the total variation\ndistance on scaled distributions. We then elucidate and extend the\nBhattacharyya and the Chernoff upper bound mechanisms using generalized\nweighted means. We provide as a byproduct novel notions of statistical\ndivergences and affinity coefficients. We illustrate our technique by deriving\nnew upper bounds for the univariate Cauchy and the multivariate\n$t$-distributions, and show experimentally that those bounds are not too\ndistant to the computationally intractable Bayes' error.\n","Comment: 22 pages, include R code.

With the aid of\nmobile agents, the nodes can get the dynamic network topology in time. In this\npaper, a mobile agent based congestion control mechanism is presented.\n","Comment: 9 Pages.

Reuse distance\nanalysis of memory address traces is a valuable tool to perform data locality\ncharacterization of programs. A single reuse distance analysis can be used to\nestimate the number of cache misses in a fully associative LRU cache of any\nsize, thereby providing estimates on the minimum bandwidth requirements at\ndifferent levels of the memory hierarchy to avoid being bandwidth bound.\nHowever, such an analysis only holds for the particular execution order that\nproduced the trace.
