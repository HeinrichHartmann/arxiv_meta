These\nquasiparticles act as weakly interacting bosons with very light mass, of the\norder of $10^{-4}$ times the vacuum electron mass. Many experiments have shown\neffects which can be viewed as due to a Bose-Einstein condensate, or\nquasicondensate, of these particles. The lifetime of the particles in most of\nthose experiments has been of the order of a few picoseconds, leading to\nsignificant nonequilibrium effects. By increasing the cavity quality, we have\nmade new samples with longer polariton lifetimes. With a photon lifetime on the\norder of 100-200 ps, polaritons in these new structures can not only come\ncloser to reaching true thermal equilibrium, a desired feature for many\nresearchers working in this field, but they can also travel much longer\ndistances. We observe the polaritons to ballistically travel on the order of\none millimeter, and at higher densities we see transport of a coherent\ncondensate, or quasicondensate, over comparable distances. In this paper we\nreport a quantitative analysis of the flow of the polaritons both in a\nlow-density, classical regime, and in the coherent regime at higher density.\nOur analysis gives us a measure of the intrinsic lifetime for photon decay from\nthe microcavity and a measure of the strength of interactions of the\npolaritons.\n"]}]

Quantum gravity should\nnot require such regularization, and it's been conjectured that the\nentanglement entropy there is always given by the black hole entropy formula\nevaluated on the entangling surface. We show that these statements have precise\nclassical counterparts at the level of the action. Specifically, we point out\nthat the action can have a non-additive imaginary part. In gravity, the latter\nis fixed by the black hole entropy formula, while in non-gravitating theories,\nit is arbitrary.

Two types of calculation are done. First, density functional theory\n(DFT) calculations based on plane waves and pseudo potentials that yield large\nsplittings, between 3 and 30 meV. Second, we derive a tight-binding model, that\npermits to address the atomic origin of the splitting. The basis set of the\nmodel is provided by the maximally localized Wannier orbitals, obtained from\nthe DFT calculation, and formed by 11 atomic-like orbitals corresponding to\n5$d$ and 3$p$ orbitals of the transition metal (W,Mo) and chalcogenide (S,Se)\natoms respectively. In the resulting Hamiltonian we can independently change\nthe atomic spin-orbit coupling constant of the two atomic species at the unit\ncell, which permits to analyse their contribution to the spin splitting at the\nhigh symmetry points. We find that ---in contrast to the valence band--- both\natoms give comparable contributions to the conduction band splittings.
