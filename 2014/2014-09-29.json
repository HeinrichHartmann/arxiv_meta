Strikingly, here we\nillustrate that this prevalent assumption is not quite true. A key ingredient\nthat has been overlooked is that of viable decoherence that thwarts the\nformation of resonances. As an example of this general mechanism, we focus on\nan experimentally relevant material and predict bound excitons in twisted\nbilayer graphene, which is a two-dimensional gapless structure exhibiting\nmetallic screening. The binding energies calculated by first-principles\nsimulations are surprisingly large. The low-energy effective model reveals that\nthese bound states are produced by a unique destructive coherence between two\nalike subband resonant excitons. In particular, this destructive coherent\neffect is not sensitive to the screening and dimensionality, and hence may\npersist as a general mechanism for creating bound excitons in various metallic\nstructures, opening the door for excitonic applications based on metallic\nstructures.\n","Comment: 12 pages and 5 figures"]}]

A variety of\ncrowdsourced queries have been investigated.

As a human-only solution is expensive,\nwe adopt a hybrid human-machine approach which first uses machines to generate\na candidate set of matching pairs, and then asks humans to label the pairs in\nthe candidate set as either matching or non-matching. Given the candidate\npairs, existing approaches will publish all pairs for verification to a\ncrowdsourcing platform. However, they neglect the fact that the pairs satisfy\ntransitive relations. As an example, if $o_1$ matches with $o_2$, and $o_2$\nmatches with $o_3$, then we can deduce that $o_1$ matches with $o_3$ without\nneeding to crowdsource $(o_1, o_3)$. To this end, we study how to leverage\ntransitive relations for crowdsourced joins. We propose a hybrid\ntransitive-relations and crowdsourcing labeling framework which aims to\ncrowdsource the minimum number of pairs to label all the candidate pairs.

The icosahedral B12 in the icosahedra chain is slightly elongated\nalong the china direction and directly bonded each other with the two-center\ncovalent bonds. A deformation of the icosahedra B12 was also found in the\ntwo-dimensional icosahedra sheets. In addition to the three-center bonding\nnature inside the icosahedra B12, there are two types of directional\ninter-icosahedra bonds in the icosahedra sheet structures, one is the single\nstrong covalent bond, and the other is a pair of the weak covalent {\\delta}\nbonds. In contrast to the boron monolayer, there is no buckling found in these\nicosahedra sheets. The deformation of the icosahedra B12 and the special\nbonding nature in these new icosahedra structures induce the energy band gap of\n0.74 eV in the icosahedra chain, 0.52 eV in the icosahedra {\\delta}6 sheet,\n0.39 eV in the icosahedra {\\delta}4 sheet, and the gapless in the icosahedra\n{\\alpha} sheet, respectively. The energy barrier per atom from the icosahedra\n{\\delta}6 sheet to the icosahedra {\\alpha} sheet is estimated to be 0.17 eV\nwhile it is estimated as 0.38 eV from the icosahedra {\\delta}6 sheet to the\nicosahedra {\\delta}4 sheet and 0.27 eV from the icosahedra {\\alpha} sheet to\nthe icosahedra {\\delta}4 sheet, respectively. Such high energy barriers\nindicate that these icosahedra sheets are relatively stable.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 7 figures"]}]

If the reflecting part of the boundary is (piecewise) flat, a\nreflection argument can be used to reduce the problem to the usual X-ray\ntransform. In some geometries one can use broken rays near the boundary to\ndetermine the values of the unknown function at the reflector, and even\nconstruct its Taylor series.

The development of cosmic ray induced atmospheric cascade is sensitive\nto the energy and mass of the primary cosmic ray particle. The largest\nuncertainties in Monte Carlo simulations of a cascade in the Earth atmosphere\nare due to assumed hadron interaction models, the so-called hadron generators.\nIn the work presented here we compare the ionization yield functions $Y$ for\nprimary cosmic ray nuclei, such as protons, $\\alpha$-particles, Oxygen and Iron\nnuclei, assuming different hadron interaction models. The computations are\nfulfilled with the CORSIKA 6.9 code using GHEISHA 2002, FLUKA 2011, UrQMD\nhadron generators for energy below 80 GeV/nucleon and QGSJET II for energy\nabove 80 GeV/nucleon. The observed difference between hadron generators is\nwidely discussed. The influence of different atmospheric parametrizations,\nnamely US standard atmosphere, US standard atmosphere winter and summer\nprofiles on ion production rate is studied. Assuming realistic primary cosmic\nray mass composition, the ion production rate is obtained at several rigidity\ncut-offs - from 1 GV (high latitudes) to 15 GV (equatorial latitudes) using\nvarious hadron generators. The computations are compared with experimental\ndata. A conclusion concerning the consistency of the hadron generators is\nstated.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 11 figures, extended version of paper accpted for\n  publication in JASTP"]}]
