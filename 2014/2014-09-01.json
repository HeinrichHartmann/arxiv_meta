In this paper, we prove this claim and\nshow that these designs are in fact $E$-optimal in the class of all approximate\ndesigns. Moreover, if the design space is the unit ball, $E$-optimal designs\nhave not been found so far and we also provide a complete solution to this\noptimal design problem. The main difficulty in the construction of $E$-optimal\ndesigns for the second-order response surface model consists in the fact that\nfor the multiplicity of the minimum eigenvalue of the \"optimal information\nmatrix\" is larger than one (in contrast to the case $k=1$) and as a consequence\nthe corresponding optimality criterion is not differentiable at the optimal\nsolution. These difficulties are solved by considering nonlinear Chebyshev\napproximation problems, which arise from a corresponding equivalence theorem.\nThe extremal polynomials which solve these Chebyshev problems are constructed\nexplicitly leading to a complete solution of the corresponding $E$-optimal\ndesign problems.\n","Comment: Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/14-AOS1241 the Annals of\n  Statistics (http://www.imstat.org/aos/) by the Institute of Mathematical\n  Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)"]}]

In this paper, we aim to understand know how to allocate\nthe limited recovery resources to efficiently prevent the spreading of\nepidemics. We study the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model\non directed scale-free networks. In the classic SIS model, a susceptible node\ncan be infected by an infected neighbor with the infection rate $\\beta$ and an\ninfected node can be recovered to be susceptible again with the recovery rate\n$\\delta$. In the steady state a fraction $y_\\infty$ of nodes are infected,\nwhich shows how severely the network is infected.

Therefore, a key stability question that has been\nunder-investigated is how strong the conditions of a system itself can change\nbefore the system moves to a qualitatively different behavior, i.e., how\nstructurally stable the systems is. Here, we introduce a framework to\ninvestigate the structural stability of socioeconomic systems formed by the\nnetwork of interactions among agents competing for resources. We measure the\nstructural stability of the system as the range of conditions in the\ndistribution and availability of resources compatible with the qualitative\nbehavior in which all the constituent agents can be self-sustained across time.\nTo illustrate our framework, we study an empirical representation of the global\nsocioeconomic system formed by countries sharing and competing for\nmultinational companies used as proxy for resources. We demonstrate that the\nstructural stability of the system is inversely associated with the level of\ncompetition and the level of heterogeneity in the distribution of resources.\nImportantly, we show that the qualitative behavior of the observed global\nsocioeconomic system is highly sensitive to changes in the distribution of\nresources.

For the simulated tempering (SP) in\nparticular -- useful due to its generality and conceptual simplicity -- the\nlatter aspect (closely related to the actual $R$) may be a key issue in\nproblems displaying metastability and trapping in certain regions of the phase\nspace.

It is based on a statistical model of the function learned from\nprevious evaluations and an infill criterion - the expected improvement - used\nto find a promising point for a new evaluation. The `expected improvement'\ninfill criterion takes into account the mean and variance of a predictive\nmultivariate Gaussian distribution.\n  The expected improvement algorithm has recently been generalized to\nmultiobjective optimization. In order to measure the improvement of a Pareto\nfront quantitatively the gain in dominated (hyper-)volume is used. The\ncomputation of the expected hypervolume improvement (EHVI) is a\nmultidimensional integration of a step-wise defined non-linear function related\nto the Gaussian probability density function over an intersection of boxes.\nThis paper provides a new algorithm for the exact computation of the expected\nimprovement to more than two objective functions. For the bicriteria case it\nhas a time complexity in $O(n^2)$ with $n$ denoting the number of points in the\ncurrent best Pareto front approximation. It improves previously known\nalgorithms with time complexity $O(n^3 \\log n)$. For tricriteria optimization\nwe devise an algorithm with time complexity of $O(n^3)$. Besides discussing the\nnew time complexity bounds the speed of the new algorithm is also tested\nempirically on test data. It is shown that further improvements in speed can be\nachieved by reusing data structures built up in previous iterations. The\nresulting numerical algorithms can be readily used in existing implementations\nof hypervolume-based expected improvement algorithms.\n","Comment: LIACS Technical Report"]}]

Specifically, we investigate the question of how many faults a network\ncan sustain so that it still contains a large (i.e. linear-sized) connected\ncomponent that still has approximately the same expansion as the original\nfault-free network. For this we apply a pruning technique which culls away\nparts of the faulty network which have poor expansion. This technique can be\napplied to both adversarial faults and to random faults. For adversarial faults\nwe prove that for every network with expansion alpha, a large connected\ncomponent with basically the same expansion as the original network exists for\nup to a constant times alpha n faults. This result is tight in the sense that\nevery graph G of size n and uniform expansion alpha(.), i.e. G has an expansion\nof alpha(n) and every subgraph G' of size m of G has an expansion of\nO(alpha(m)), can be broken into sublinear components with omega(alpha(n) n)\nfaults.\n  For random faults we observe that the situation is significantly different,\nbecause in this case the expansion of a graph only gives a very weak bound on\nits resilience to random faults. More specifically, there are networks of\nuniform expansion O(sqrt{n}) that are resilient against a constant fault\nprobability but there are also networks of uniform expansion Omega(1/log n)\nthat are not resilient against a O(1/log n) fault probability. Thus, a\ndifferent parameter is needed. For this we introduce the span of a graph which\nallows us to determine the maximum fault probability in a much better way than\nthe expansion can. We use the span to show the first known results for the\neffect of random faults on the expansion of d-dimensional meshes.\n","Comment: 8 pages; to appear at SPAA 2004"]}]
