The number of regressors K can\nbe much larger than the sample size. A key ingredient is sparsity, i.e., the\nvector of coefficients has many zeros, or approximate sparsity, i.e., it is\nwell approximated by a vector with many zeros. We can have less instruments\nthan regressors and allow for partial identification. Our procedure, called\nSTIV (Self Tuning Instrumental Variables) estimator, is realized as a solution\nof a conic program. The joint confidence sets can be obtained by solving K\nconvex programs. We provide rates of convergence, model selection results and\npropose three types of joint confidence sets relying each on different\nassumptions on the parameter space. Under the stronger assumption they are\nadaptive. The results are uniform over a wide classes of distributions of the\ndata and can have finite sample validity. When the number of instruments is too\nlarge or when one only has instruments for an endogenous regressor which are\ntoo weak, the confidence sets can have infinite volume with positive\nprobability. This provides a simple one-stage procedure for inference robust to\nweak instruments which could also be used for low dimensional models. In our IV\nregression setting, the standard tools from the literature on sparsity, such as\nthe restricted eigenvalue assumption are inapplicable. Therefore we develop new\nsharper sensitivity characteristics, as well as easy to compute data-driven\nbounds. All results apply to the particular case of the usual high-dimensional\nregression. We also present extensions to the high-dimensional framework of the\ntwo-stage least squares method and method to detect endogenous instruments\ngiven a set of exogenous instruments.\n"]}]

In this study we present an analytical treatment of the secular\nevolution of two bars that oscillate with respect one another. Two cases of\ninteraction, with and without geometrical deformation, are discussed. In the\nlatter case, the bars are described as modified Jacobi ellipsoids. These\ntriaxial systems are formed by a rotating fluid mass in gravitational\nequilibrium with its own rotational velocity and the gravitational field of the\nother bar. The governing equation for the variation of their relative angular\nseparation is then numerically integrated, which also provides the time\nevolution of the geometrical parameters of the bodies. The case of rigid,\nnon-deformable, bars produces in some cases an oscillatory motion in the bodies\nsimilar to that of a harmonic oscillator. For the other case, a deformable\nrotating body that can be represented by a modified Jacobi ellipsoid under the\ninfluence of an exterior massive body will change its rotational velocity to\nescape from the attracting body, just as if the gravitational torque exerted by\nthe exterior body were of opposite sign. Instead, the exchange of angular\nmomentum will cause the Jacobian body to modify its geometry by enlarging its\nlong axis, located in the plane of rotation, thus decreasing its axial ratios.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in AN"]}]

We develop an\nachievable rate region by employing rate-splitting, block Markov encoding,\nGelfand--Pinsker multicoding, superposition coding and joint typicality\ndecoding. In the proposed scheme, the encoders use a partial decoding strategy\nto collaborate in the next block, and the receiver uses a backward decoding\nstrategy with joint unique decoding at each stage. Our achievable rate region\nincludes several previously known regions proposed in the literature for\ndifferent scenarios of multiple-access and relay channels. Then, we consider\ntwo Gaussian GMACs with additive interference. In the first model, we assume\nthat the interference is known noncausally at both of the encoders and\nconstruct a multi-layer Costa precoding scheme that removes \\emph{completely}\nthe effect of the interference. In the second model, we consider a doubly dirty\nGaussian GMAC in which each of interferences is known noncausally only at one\nencoder. We derive an inner bound and analyze the achievable rate region for\nthe latter model and interestingly prove that if one of the encoders knows the\nfull CSI, there exists an achievable rate region which is \\emph{independent} of\nthe power of interference.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 8 pages"]}]

Such evaluations can be analyzed separately using signed social\nnetworks and textual sentiment analysis, but this misses the rich interactions\nbetween language and social context. To capture such interactions, we develop a\nmodel that predicts individual A's opinion of individual B by synthesizing\ninformation from the signed social network in which A and B are embedded with\nsentiment analysis of the evaluative texts relating A to B. We prove that this\nproblem is NP-hard but can be relaxed to an efficiently solvable hinge-loss\nMarkov random field, and we show that this implementation outperforms text-only\nand network-only versions in two very different datasets involving\ncommunity-level decision-making: the Wikipedia Requests for Adminship corpus\nand the Convote U.S. Congressional speech corpus.\n"]}]

A physicochemical simulation of infalling parcels of\nmatter is performed for a low-mass star-forming system to trace the chemical\nevolution from cloud to disc. An axisymmetric 2D semi-analytic model generates\nthe time-dependent density and velocity distributions, and full continuum\nradiative transfer is performed to calculate the dust temperature and the UV\nradiation field at each position as a function of time. A comprehensive\ngas-grain chemical network is employed to compute the chemical abundances along\ninfall trajectories. Two physical scenarios are studied, one in which the\ndominant disc growth mechanism is viscous spreading, and another in which\ncontinuous infall of matter prevails. The results show that the infall path\ninfluences the abundance of methanol entering each type of disc, ranging from\ncomplete loss of methanol to an enhancement by a factor of > 1 relative to the\nprestellar phase. Critical chemical processes and parameters for the methanol\nchemistry under different physical conditions are identified. The exact\nabundance and distribution of methanol is important for the budget of complex\norganic molecules in discs, which will be incorporated into forming planetary\nsystem objects such as protoplanets and comets. These simulations show that the\ncomet-forming zone contains less methanol than in the precollapse phase, which\nis dominantly of prestellar origin, but also with additional layers built up in\nthe envelope during infall.

In this chapter, we consider the radio resource\nallocation problem in a multi-tier orthogonal frequency division multiple\naccess (OFDMA)-based cellular (e.g., 5G LTE-A) network. In particular, we\npresent three novel approaches for distributed resource allocation in such\nnetworks utilizing the concepts of stable matching, factor-graph based message\npassing, and distributed auction. We illustrate each of the modeling schemes\nwith respect to a practical radio resource allocation problem.

There is a common set of radio\nresources (e.g., resource blocks [RBs]) available to the network tiers (e.g.,\nMBS, SBSs and DUEs). The SUEs and DUEs use the available resources (e.g., RB\nand power level) in an underlay manner as long as the interference caused to\nthe macro tier (e.g., macro user equipments [MUEs]) remains below a given\nthreshold. Followed by a brief theoretical overview of the modeling tools\n(e.g., stable matching, message passing and auction algorithm), we present the\ndistributed solution approaches for the resource allocation problem in the\naforementioned network setup.
