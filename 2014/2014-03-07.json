Additionally, lensing peak counts contain cosmological information\nbeyond the power spectrum. Both of these statistics can be affected by the\npreferential selection of source galaxies in patches of the sky with high\nmagnification, as well as by the dilution in the source galaxy surface density\nin such regions. If not accounted for, these biases introduce systematic errors\nfor cosmological measurements. Here we quantify these systematic errors, using\nconvergence maps from a suite of ray-tracing N-body simulations. At the cut-off\nmagnitude m of on-going and planned major weak lensing surveys, the logarithmic\nslope of the cumulative number counts s = dlog[n(>m)]/dlog(m) is in the range\n0.1 < s < 0.5. At s = 0.2, expected in the I band for LSST, the inferred values\nof Omega_m, w and sigma_8 are biased by many sigma (where sigma denotes the\nmarginalized error) and therefore the biases will need to be carefully modeled.\nWe also find that the parameters are biased differently in the (Omega_m, w,\nsigma_8) parameter space when the power spectrum and when the peak counts are\nused. In particular, w derived from the power spectrum is less affected than w\nderived from peak counts, while the opposite is true for the best-constrained\ncombination of [sigma_8 Omega_m^gamma] (with gamma=0.62 from the power spectrum\nand gamma = 0.48 from peak counts). This suggests that the combination of the\npower spectrum and peak counts can help mitigate the impact of magnification\nand size biases.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 11 figures"]}]

A key feature of the approach is that it provides\na closed integral expression for the time-dependence of the density matrix of\nthe molecular junction after switch-on of a bias or gate potential which can be\nevaluated without the necessity of propagating individual single-particle\norbitals. This allows for the study of time-dependent transport in large\nmolecular systems coupled to wide band leads. As an application of the\nformalism we study the transient dynamics of zigzag and armchair graphene\nnanoribbons of different symmetries. We find that the transient times can\nexceed several hundreds of femtoseconds while displaying a long time\noscillatory motion related to multiple reflections of the density wave in the\nnanoribbons at the ribbon--lead interface. This temporal profile has a shape\nthat scales with the length of the ribbons and is modulated by fast\noscillations described by intra-ribbon and ribbon--lead transitions. Especially\nin the armchair nanoribbons there exists a sequence of quasi-stationary states\nrelated to reflections at the edge state located at the ribbon--lead interface.\nIn the case of zigzag nanoribbons there is a predominant oscillation frequency\nassociated with virtual transitions between the edge states and the Fermi\nlevels of the electrode.

We present delay times of double-detonation SNe, in which\na sub-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf accretes non-dynamically\nfrom a helium-rich companion. One of the main uncertainties in quantifying SN\nrates from double-detonations is the (assumed) retention efficiency of He-rich\nmatter. Therefore, we implement a new prescription for the treatment of\naccretion/accumulation of He-rich matter on white dwarfs. In addition, we test\nhow the results change depending on which criteria are assumed to lead to a\ndetonation in the helium shell. In comparing the results to our standard case\n(Ruiter et al. 2011), we find that regardless of the adopted He accretion\nprescription, the SN rates are reduced by only 25% if low-mass He shells (<\n0.05 Msun) are sufficient to trigger the detonations. If more massive (0.1\nMsun) shells are needed, the rates decrease by 85% and the delay time\ndistribution is significantly changed in the new accretion model - only SNe\nwith prompt (< 500 Myr) delay times are produced. Since theoretical arguments\nfavour low-mass He shells for normal double-detonation SNe, we conclude that\nthe rates from double-detonations are likely to be high, and should not\ncritically depend on the adopted prescription for accretion of He.\n","Comment: Accepted to MNRAS Letters.

In this\nsetting, each job incurs a cost depending on its completion time, given by a\nprivate cost function, and one seeks to schedule the jobs to minimize the total\nsum of these costs. The framework captures many important scheduling objectives\nsuch as weighted flow time or weighted tardiness. Still, the general case as\nwell as the mentioned special cases are far from being very well understood\nyet, even for only one machine. Aiming for better general understanding of this\nproblem, in this paper we focus on the case of uniform job release dates on one\nmachine for which the state of the art is a 4-approximation algorithm. This is\ntrue even for a special case that is equivalent to the covering version of the\nwell-studied and prominent unsplittable flow on a path problem, which is\ninteresting in its own right. For that covering problem, we present a\nquasi-polynomial time $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm that yields an\n$(e+\\epsilon)$-approximation for the above scheduling problem. Moreover, for\nthe latter we devise the best possible resource augmentation result regarding\nspeed: a polynomial time algorithm which computes a solution with \\emph{optimal\n}cost at $1+\\epsilon$ speedup. Finally, we present an elegant QPTAS for the\nspecial case where the cost functions of the jobs fall into at most $\\log n$\nmany classes. This algorithm allows the jobs even to have up to $\\log n$ many\ndistinct release dates.\n","Comment: 2 pages, 1 figure"]}]

The DoF collapse even when perfect channel knowledge for one\nuser is available to the transmitter. This also settles a related recent\nconjecture by Tandon et al. The key to our proof is a bound on the number of\ncodewords that can cast the same image (within noise distortion) at the\nundesired receiver whose channel is subject to finite precision CSIT, while\nremaining resolvable at the desired receiver whose channel is precisely known\nby the transmitter. We are also able to generalize the result along two\ndirections. First, if the peak of the probability density function is allowed\nto scale as O(P^(\\alpha/2)), representing the concentration of probability\ndensity (improving CSIT) due to, e.g., quantized feedback at rate\n(\\alpha/2)\\log(P), then the DoF are bounded above by 1+\\alpha, which is also\nachievable under quantized feedback. Second, we generalize the result to the K\nuser broadcast channel with K antennas at the transmitter and a single antenna\nat each receiver. Here also the DoF collapse under non-degenerate channel\nuncertainty. The result directly implies a collapse of DoF to unity under\nnon-degenerate channel uncertainty for the general K-user interference and MxN\nuser X networks as well.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 3 figures"]}]

This is the\nelementary premise that pervades common models of evolution. Under extreme\nconditions, however, the process may no longer be probabilistic. Those that\nmeet certain conditions survive and may reproduce while others perish. By\nintroducing the corresponding binary birth-death dynamics to spatial\nevolutionary games, we observe solutions that are fundamentally different from\nthose reported previously based on imitation dynamics. Social dilemmas\ntransform to collective enterprises, where the availability of free expansion\nranges and limited exploitation possibilities dictates self-organized growth.\nStrategies that dominate are those that are collectively most apt in meeting\nthe survival threshold, rather than those who succeed in exploiting others for\nunfair benefits. Revisiting Darwinian principles with the focus on survival\nrather than imitation thus reveals the most counterintuitive ways of\nreconciling cooperation with competition.\n","Comment: 6 two-column pages, 6 figures; accepted for publication in\n  Europhysics Letters"]}]

The original paper introduced the homogeneous coordinate\nring of a toric variety (now called the total coordinate ring or Cox ring) and\ngave a quotient construction. The paper also studied sheaves on a toric\nvariety, and in Section 4 described its automorphism group. The error in the\nproof of Proposition 4.3 resulted from the faulty assumption that a certain set\nof graded endomorphisms forms a ring; rather, it is a monoid under composition.\nThe erratum notes this error and gives a correct proof of the proposition.\n","Comment: Erratum: 6 pages, LaTeX; Original paper: 28 pages, TeX C Version 3.0\n  with AMS fonts"]}]
