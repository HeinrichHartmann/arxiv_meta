Several numerical\nmethods are used to estimate $v_2$, resulting in various combinations of \"flow\"\nand \"nonflow\" that reveal systematic biases in the $v_2$ estimates. QCD jets\ncontribute strongly to azimuth correlations and specifically to the\n$\\cos(2\\phi)$ component. Purpose: We question the extent of jet-related\n(\"nonflow\") bias in and hydrodynamic \"flow\" interpretations of $v_2$\nmeasurements. Method: We introduce two-dimensional (2D) model fits to angular\ncorrelation data that distinguish accurately between jet-related correlation\ncomponents and a {\\em nonjet azimuth quadrupole} that might represent \"elliptic\nflow\" if that were relevant. We compare measured jet-related and \"flow\"-related\ndata systematics and determine the jet-related contribution to $v_2$\nmeasurements. Results: Jet structure does introduce substantial bias to\nconventional $v_2$ measurements, making interpretation difficult.

Within a \\auau centrality interval where\njets show no indication of rescattering or medium effects the nonjet quadrupole\namplitude rises to 60% of its maximum value. Conclusions: Disagreements between\nnonjet quadrupole systematics and hydro theory expectations, the large\nquadrupole amplitudes observed in more-peripheral \\auau collisions and a\nsignificant nonzero value in \\nn $\\approx$ \\pp collisions strongly suggest that\nthe nonjet quadrupole does not arise from a hydrodynamic \"flow\" mechanism.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 9 figures"]}]

First, we investigate which region of the neutron star's interior\nand of the equation of state is most responsible for the universality. We find\nthat the universal relation between the moment of inertia and the quadrupole\nmoment is dominated by the star's outer-core, a shell of width (50-95)% of the\ntotal radius, which corresponds to the density range\n$(10^{14}$-$10^{15})$g/cm$^3$. Second, we study the impact on the universality\nof approximating stellar isodensity contours as self-similar ellipsoids. An\nanalytical calculation in the Newtonian limit reveals that the shape of the\nellipsoids does not affect the universal relations, but relaxing the\nself-similarity assumption can completely destroy it. Third, we investigate the\neccentricity profiles of rotating relativistic stars and find that the\nellipticity is roughly constant, with variations of roughly (20-30)% in the\nregion that matters to the universal relations. Fourth, we repeat the above\nanalysis for non-compact, regular stars and find that the ellipticity is not\nconstant, with variations that easily exceed 100% and universality is lost.\nThese findings suggest that universality arises as an emergent approximate\nsymmetry: as one flows in the stellar-structure phase space from non-compact\nstar region to the relativistic star region, the eccentricity variation inside\nstars decreases, leading to approximate self-similarity in their isodensity\ncontours, which then leads to the universal behavior observed in their exterior\nmultipole moments.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 22 figures; matches version appearing in PRD"]}]

To overcome this\nlimitation it has been suggested to make chemical shift predictors based on\nquantum mechanical(QM) calculations.

Our final sample comprises 32 systems at\n\\textbf{$z<1.75$}, with 14 below $z = 0.35$. For these 14 systems we estimate\nvelocity dispersions ($\\sigma_{gr}$) and perform a virial analysis to obtain\nthe radii ($R_{200}$ and $R_{500}$) and total masses ($M_{200}$ and $M_{500}$)\nfor groups with at least five galaxy members. We use the Chandra X-ray\nobservations to derive the X-ray luminosity ($L_X$). We examine the performance\nof the group properties $\\sigma_{gr}$, $L_{opt}$ and $L_X$, as proxies for the\ngroup mass. Understanding how well these observables measure the total mass is\nimportant to estimate how precisely the cluster/group mass function is\ndetermined. Exploring the scaling relations built with the X-Bo\\\"otes sample\nand comparing these with samples from the literature, we find a break in the\n$L_X$-$M_{500}$ relation at approximately $M_{500} = 5\\times10^{13}$ M$_\\odot$\n(for $M_{500} > 5\\times10^{13}$ M$_\\odot$, $M_{500} \\propto L_X^{0.61\\pm0.02}$,\nwhile for $M_{500} \\leq 5\\times10^{13}$ M$_\\odot$, $M_{500} \\propto\nL_X^{0.44\\pm0.05}$). Thus, the mass-luminosity relation for galaxy groups\ncannot be described by the same power law as galaxy clusters. A possible\nexplanation for this break is the dynamical friction, tidal interactions and\nprojection effects which reduce the velocity dispersion values of the galaxy\ngroups. By extending the cluster luminosity function to the group regime, we\npredict the number of groups that new X-ray surveys, particularly eROSITA, will\ndetect. Based on our cluster/group luminosity function estimates, eROSITA will\nidentify $\\sim$1800 groups ($L_X = 10^{41}-10^{43}$ ergs s$^{-1}$) within a\ndistance of 200 Mpc.

Fitting regression mixtures is challenging and is usually\nperformed by maximum likelihood by using the expectation-maximization (EM)\nalgorithm. However, it is well-known that the initialization is crucial for EM.\nIf the initialization is inappropriately performed, the EM algorithm may lead\nto unsatisfactory results. The EM algorithm also requires the number of\nclusters to be given a priori; the problem of selecting the number of mixture\ncomponents requires using model selection criteria to choose one from a set of\npre-estimated candidate models. We propose a new fully unsupervised algorithm\nto learn regression mixture models with unknown number of components.

The\nproposed learning approach is fully unsupervised: 1) it simultaneously infers\nthe model parameters and the optimal number of the regression mixture\ncomponents from the data as the learning proceeds, rather than in a two-fold\nscheme as in standard model-based clustering using afterward model selection\ncriteria, and 2) it does not require accurate initialization unlike the\nstandard EM for regression mixtures. The developed approach is applied to curve\nclustering problems. Numerical experiments on simulated data show that the\nproposed robust EM algorithm performs well and provides accurate results in\nterms of robustness with regard initialization and retrieving the optimal\npartition with the actual number of clusters.

For the core problem of power balance, the\nlegacy paradigm of tailoring supply to follow random demand may be\ninappropriate under deep penetration of uncertain and intermittent renewable\ngeneration. In this situation, there is an emerging consensus that the\nalternative approach of controlling demand to follow random supply offers\ncompelling economic benefits in terms of reduced regulation costs. This\napproach exploits the flexibility of demand side resources and requires\nsensing, actuation, and communication infrastructure; distributed control\nalgorithms; and viable schemes to compensate participating loads. This paper\nconsiders rate-constrained energy services which are a specific paradigm for\nflexible demand. These services are characterized by a specified delivery\nwindow, the total amount of energy that must be supplied over this window, and\nthe maximum rate at which this energy may be delivered. We consider a forward\nmarket where rate-constrained energy services are traded. We explore allocation\npolicies and market decisions of a supplier in this market. The supplier owns a\ngeneration mix that includes some uncertain renewable generation and may also\npurchase energy in day-ahead and real-time markets to meet customer demand. The\nsupplier must optimally select the portfolio of rate-constrained services to\nsell, the amount of day-ahead energy to buy, and the policies for making\nreal-time energy purchases and allocations to customers to maximize its\nexpected profit.

However, it becomes evident as well that\npopulation growth as such is not a sufficient condition to generate a\npunctuated equilibrium dynamic in the war dynamics of the international system:\nother conditions and factors - and their interplay - contribute to this typical\ndynamic as well. From 1945 until the collapse of the Soviet Union (1991), the\nconditions of international system differed fundamentally from the conditions\nof the European international system during the period 1480-1945. It can be\nargued, that sooner or later a punctuated equilibrium war dynamic will resume.\n","Comment: Withdrawn.
