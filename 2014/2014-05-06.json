Much of the effort to\nstudy these new effects, like the breakdown of the conventional Fermi-liquid\ntheory of metals has been focused in narrow band electronic systems.\nFerroelectric crystals provide a very different type of quantum criticality\nthat arises purely from the crystalline lattice. In many cases the\nferroelectric phase can be tuned to absolute zero using hydrostatic pressure or\nchemical or isotopic substitution. Close to such a zero temperature phase\ntransition, the dielectric constant and other quantities change into radically\nunconventional forms due to the quantum fluctuations of the electrical\npolarization.

More precisely, it is of fundamental interest to understand\nhow the storage, manipulation, and transmission of information utilizing\nquantum systems are influenced by the fact that these processes take place in a\nrelativistic spacetime. In particular, many studies in RQI have been focused on\nthe effects of non-uniform motion on entanglement, the main resource of quantum\ninformation protocols. Early investigations in this direction were performed in\nhighly idealized settings that prompted questions as to the practical\naccessibility of these results. To overcome these limitations it is necessary\nto consider quantum systems that are in principle accessible to localized\nobservers. In this thesis we present such a model, the rigid relativistic\ncavity, and its extensions, focusing on the effects of motion on entanglement\nand applications such as quantum teleportation. We study cavities in (1+1)\ndimensions undergoing non-uniform motion, consisting of segments of uniform\nacceleration and inertial motion of arbitrary duration that allow the involved\nvelocities to become relativistic. The transitions between segments can be\nsharp or smooth and higher dimensions can be incorporated. The primary focus\nlies in the Bogoliubov transformations of the quantum fields, real scalar\nfields or Dirac fields, confined to the cavities. The Bogoliubov\ntransformations change the particle content and the occupation of the energy\nlevels of the cavity. We show how these effects generate entanglement between\nthe modes of the quantum fields inside a single cavity for various initial\nstates. The entanglement between several cavities, on the other hand, is\ndegraded by the non-uniform motion, influencing the fidelity of tasks such as\nteleportation.\n","Comment: PhD thesis, University of Nottingham, 2013, 200 pages, 34 figures,\n  available from e-theses server at http://etheses.nottingham.ac.uk/3795/ v2:\n  updated references"]}]

It is\ngenerally accepted that second order descent methods are the most robust, fast,\nand reliable approaches for nonlinear optimization of a general smooth\nfunction. However, in the context of computer vision, second order descent\nmethods have two main drawbacks: (1) the function might not be analytically\ndifferentiable and numerical approximations are impractical, and (2) the\nHessian may be large and not positive definite.

Hence the need arises for simulating and optimizing traffic\ncontrol algorithms to better accommodate this increasing demand. Fuzzy\noptimization deals with finding the values of input parameters of a complex\nsimulated system which result in desired output. This paper presents a MATLAB\nsimulation of fuzzy logic traffic controller for controlling flow of traffic in\nisolated intersections. This controller is based on the waiting time and queue\nlength of vehicles at present green phase and vehicles queue lengths at the\nother phases. The controller controls the traffic light timings and phase\ndifference to ascertain sebaceous flow of traffic with least waiting time and\nqueue length. In this paper, the isolated intersection model used consists of\ntwo alleyways in each approach. Every outlook has different value of queue\nlength and waiting time, systematically, at the intersection. The maximum value\nof waiting time and vehicle queue length has to be selected by using proximity\nsensors as inputs to controller for the ameliorate control traffic flow at the\nintersection. An intelligent traffic model and fuzzy logic traffic controller\nare developed to evaluate the performance of traffic controller under different\npre-defined conditions for oleaginous flow of traffic. Additionally, this fuzzy\nlogic traffic controller has emergency vehicle siren sensors which detect\nemergency vehicle movement like ambulance, fire brigade, Police Van etc. and\ngives maximum priority to him and pass preferred signal to it.\n","Comment: 7 Pages,7 Figure,CSIR Sponsored X Control Instrumentation System\n  Conference 2013; ISBN 978-93-82338-93-2"]}]
