We further\nprove that analog polar encoding can achieve the fundamental limit of\nachievable dimension rate with vanishing Pe across SANC. From the duality, a\nstructured construction scheme is proposed for the linear measurement matrix\nwhich achieves the minimum measurement requirement for noiseless CS.\n","Comment: 26 pages. Rev5 added new results of Theorem 2 (proving that analog\n  polar encoding achieves vanishing P_e while achieving the dimension rate\n  (1-p) across SANC(p)) and other modifications/additions.

We propose a\nmethodology, inspired by statistical physics, that characterizes a model\nthrough its 'phase diagram' in the space of parameters. Our first motivation is\nto understand the large macro-economic fluctuations observed in the 'Mark I'\nABM. Our major finding is the generic existence of a phase transition between a\n'good economy' where unemployment is low, and a 'bad economy' where\nunemployment is high. We introduce a simpler framework that allows us to show\nthat this transition is robust against many modifications of the model, and is\ngenerically induced by an asymmetry between the rate of hiring and the rate of\nfiring of the firms. The unemployment level remains small until a tipping\npoint, beyond which the economy suddenly collapses. If the parameters are such\nthat the system is close to this transition, any small fluctuation is amplified\nas the system jumps between the two equilibria. We have explored several\nnatural extensions of the model. One is to introduce a bankruptcy threshold,\nlimiting the leverage of firms. This leads to a rich phase diagram with, in\nparticular, a region where acute endogenous crises occur, during which the\nunemployment rate shoots up before the economy can recover. We also introduce\nsimple wage policies. This leads to inflation (in the 'good' phase) or\ndeflation (in the 'bad' phase), but leaves the overall phase diagram of the\nmodel essentially unchanged. We have also started exploring the effect of\nsimple monetary policies that attempt to contain rising unemployment and defang\ncrises. We end the paper with general comments on the usefulness of ABMs to\nmodel macroeconomic phenomena, in particular in view of the time needed to\nreach a steady state that raises the issue of ergodicity in these models.\n","Comment: 42 pages, 8 figures.

A special feature\nof spin liquids is that symmetries can be fractionalized, and different\npatterns of fractionalization imply distinct phases. The symmetry\nfractionalization pattern for the kagome spin liquid remains to be determined.\nA popular approach to studying spin liquids is to decompose the physical spin\ninto partons which are either bosonic (Schwinger bosons) or fermionic\n(Abrikosov fermions), which are then treated within mean field theory. A\nlongstanding question has been whether these two approaches are truly distinct\nor describe the same phase in complementary ways.

Given\nthe above motivation, the focus of this paper is not to build good static\napproximations for buffer overflow analysis but to show how given static\napproximations could be formalized in terms of stateless formulations so that\nthey become amenable to automatic construction of analysers.\n"]}]

However, this technique suffers from a major\ndrawback which is the high Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of the output\nsignals. In order to overcome this issue, several methods that require the\ntransmission of explicit Side Information (SI) bits have been proposed. In\nfact, the transmitted bits must be channel-encoded as they are particularly\ncritical to the performance of the considered OFDM system.

Then the exact information of halos within this 3D\nregion is identified by data mining in the merger tree files. To avoid visual\nclutter, all the halos are projected in 2D space with a MDS method.

The gains of the controllers are such chosen that the overall system\nbecomes singularly perturbed system, and different subsystems converge to their\ndesired values at different times. Then multi-time scale convergence analysis\nhas been carried out in this paper. Negative gradient of a potential based\nfunction has been added to the controller to ensure collision avoidance among\nthe robots.

When two spherical shells\ncollide and merge into one, we show that it is possible that $r$ remains to be\na good coordinate and the conservation laws hold.

Currently there exist a few different types of $q$-analogs of the MZVs\n($q$-MZVs) defined and studied by mathematicians and physicists. In this paper,\nwe give a uniform treatment of these $q$-MZVs by considering their double\nshuffle relations (DBSFs) and duality relations. The main idea is a\nmodification and generalization of the one used by Castillo Medina et al. who\nhave considered the DBSFs of a special type of $q$-MZVs. We generalize their\nmethod to a few other types of $q$-MZVs including the one defined by the author\nin 2003. With different approach, Takeyama has already studied this type by\n\"regularization\" and observed that there exist $\\mathbb Q$-linear relations\nwhich are not consequences of the DBSFs. He also discovered a new family of\nrelations which we call the duality relations in this paper. This deficiency of\nDBSFs occurs among other types, too, so we generalize the duality relations to\nall of these values and find that there are still some missing relations. This\nleads to the most general type of $q$-MZVs together with a new kind of\nrelations called $\\bf P$-$\\bf Q$ relations which are used to lower the\ndeficiencies further. As an application, we will confirm a conjecture of\nOkounkov on the dimensions of certain $q$-MZV spaces, either theoretically or\nnumerically, for the weight up to 12.

It is shown in the recent work [7] by using explicit Jacobi\nelliptic functions that the cubic NLS equation on a tadpole graph admits a rich\nstructure of standing waves. Among these, there are different branches of\nlocalized waves bifurcating from the edge of the essential spectrum of an\nassociated Schr\\\"odinger operator. We show by using a modified Lyapunov-Schmidt\nreduction method that the bifur- cation of localized standing waves occurs for\nevery positive power nonlinearity. We distinguish a primary branch of never\nvanishing standing waves bifurcating from the trivial solution and an infinite\nsequence of higher branches with oscillating behavior in the ring. The higher\nbranches bifurcate from the branches of degenerate standing waves with\nvanishing tail outside the ring. Moreover, we analyze stability of bifurcating\nstanding waves. Namely, we show that the primary branch is composed by\norbitally stable standing waves for subcritical power nonlinearities, while all\nnontrivial higher branches are linearly unstable near the bifurcation point.\nThe stability character of the degenerate branches remains inconclusive at the\nanalytical level, whereas heuristic arguments based on analysis of embedded\neigenvalues of negative Krein signatures support the conjecture of their linear\ninstability at least near the bifurcation point.

Therefore, the signals from cyclic ring moiety of these fatty acids\ncan be used as markers (a) for the identification of bacterial and\nmycobacterial infections and (b) for differential diagnosis of bacterial and\nfungal infections. However, these microbial fatty acids when present inside the\nmembrane are not easily detectable by NMR owing to their fast T2 relaxation.\nNonetheless, the problem can easily be circumvented if these fatty acids become\nsuspended in solution. This has been achieved by abolishing the membrane\nintegrity using broad spectrum antibiotics (including ampicillin). The\nsuspended fatty acids are then detected by NMR to probe the infection.\nTherefore, the method has been given the name AADNMR i.e. Add Antibiotic to\nDetect by NMR. The method has been tested here using both Gram positive and\nGram negative bacterial strains and finally the utility of method is\ndemonstrated for discriminating bacterial and fungal infections to aid timely\ndiagnosis of infectious peritonitis (a life threatening complication associated\nwith prolonged peritoneal dialysis).\n","Comment: 16 pages, 4 figures, and Graphical abstract Figure and highlights"]}]

Finite field-dependent BRST-antiBRST transformations are used\nto solve (perturbatively) the Gribov problem in the Gribov--Zwanziger approach.\nA modification of the path integral for theories with a gauge group, being\nconsistent with gauge invariance and providing a restriction of the integration\nmeasure to the first Gribov region with a non-vanishing Faddeev--Popov\ndeterminant, is suggested.\n","Comment: 13 pages, contribution to the Proceedings of QUARKS-2014, June 2-8,\n  2014, Suzdal, Russia"]}]

First,\nfor a number of the known radial velocity (RV) giants we computed traditional\nforward models of their atmospheric structure and clouds, given various input\nassumptions, and computed model albedo spectra. Such models have been computed\nbefore, but mostly for generic planets. Our new models demonstrate that there\nis likely interesting spectral diversity among those planets that are most\nfavorable for direct detection. Second, we applied a powerful Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) retrieval technique to synthetic noisy data of cool giants\nto better understand how well various atmospheric parameters--particularly\nmolecular abundances and cloud properties--could be constrained. This is the\nfirst time such techniques have been applied to this problem. The process is\ntime consuming, so only a dozen or so cases could be completed in the limited\ntime available. Nevertheless the results clearly show that even at S/N ~ 5,\nscientifically interesting and valuable conclusions can be drawn about the\nproperties of giant planet atmospheres from noisy spectra. We find that\natmospheric abundances are best constrained when the planet gravity is bounded.\nThus direct imaging observations of known radial velocity planets are extremely\nvaluable as limits on a target planet's gravity can be obtained from\nastrometric imaging and reflectivity and mass-radius relationship arguments\n(for mass and radius, respectively). Further retrieval studies are clearly\nwarranted and would be valuable to help guide instrument design decisions.\n","Comment: Report of a quick study of science return from direct-imaging\n  exoplanet missions, commissioned by the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program on\n  behalf of the WFIRST/AFTA Science Definition Team and the Exo-S and Exo-C\n  Science and Technology Definition Teams"]}]
