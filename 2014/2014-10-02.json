Hysteresis\nis widely used in electronic circuits, e.g., it is routinely observed in\nsuperconducting circuits and is essential in rf-superconducting quantum\ninterference devices [SQUIDs]. Furthermore, hysteresis is as fundamental to\nsuperfluidity (and superconductivity) as quantized persistent currents,\ncritical velocity, and Josephson effects. Nevertheless, in spite of multiple\ntheoretical predictions, hysteresis has not been previously observed in any\nsuperfluid, atomic-gas Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Here we demonstrate\nhysteresis in a quantized atomtronic circuit: a ring of superfluid BEC\nobstructed by a rotating weak link.

Our techniques allow us to tune the size of the hysteresis loop and to\nconsider the fundamental excitations that accompany hysteresis.

The understanding\nof the space group symmetry as a function of the number of layers is therefore\nimportant for the correct interpretation of the experimental data. Here we\npresent a thorough group theory study of the symmetry aspects relevant to\noptical and spectroscopic analysis, for the most common polytypes of TMDCs,\ni.e. $2Ha$, $2Hc$ and $1T$, as a function of the number of layers. Real space\nsymmetries, the group of the wave vectors, the relevance of inversion symmetry,\nirreducible representations of the vibrational modes, optical selection rules\nand Raman tensors are discussed.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Super-AGB stars are expected to\nhave slow winds with high mass-loss rates, so their wind density is high. The\nexplosions of super-AGB stars are therefore presumed to occur in this dense\nwind. We provide the first synthetic light curves (LCs) for such events by\nexploding realistic electron-capture supernova (ecSN) progenitors within their\nsuper-AGB winds. We find that the early LC, i.e. before the recombination wave\nreaches the bottom of the H-rich envelope of SN ejecta (the plateau phase), is\nnot affected by the dense wind. However, after the plateau phase, the\nluminosity remains higher when the super-AGB wind is taken into account. We\ncompare our results to the historical LC of SN 1054, the progenitor of the Crab\nNebula, and show that the explosion of an ecSN within an ordinary super-AGB\nwind can explain the LC features. We conclude that SN 1054 could have been a\nType IIn SN without any extra extreme mass loss which was previously suggested\nto be necessary to account for its early high luminosity. We also show that our\nLCs match Type IIn SNe with an early plateau phase (`Type IIn-P') and suggest\nthat they are ecSNe within super-AGB winds. Although some ecSNe can be bright\nin the optical spectral range due to the large progenitor radius, their X-ray\nluminosity from the interaction does not necessarily get as bright as other\nType IIn SNe whose optical luminosities are also powered by the interaction.\nThus, we suggest that optically-bright X-ray-faint Type IIn SNe can emerge from\necSNe. Optically-faint Type IIn SNe, such as SN 2008S, can also originate from\necSNe if their H-rich envelope masses are small. Some of them can be observed\nas `Type IIn-b' SNe due to the small H-rich envelope mass.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 6 figures, accepted by Astronomy & Astrophysics, abstract\n  abridged"]}]

This\ndownsizing trend in the AGN evolution seems to be contradictory to the\nhierarchical structure formation scenario. In this study, we present the AGN\nspace density evolution predicted by a semi-analytic model of galaxy and AGN\nformation based on the hierarchical structure formation scenario. We\ndemonstrate that our model can reproduce the downsizing trend of the AGN space\ndensity evolution. The reason for the downsizing trend in our model is a\ncombination of the cold gas depletion as a consequence of star formation, the\ngas cooling suppression in massive halos and the AGN lifetime scaling with the\ndynamical timescale. We assume that a major merger of galaxies causes a\nstarburst, spheroid formation, and cold gas accretion onto a supermassive black\nhole (SMBH). We also assume that this cold gas accretion triggers AGN activity.\nSince the cold gas is mainly depleted by star formation and gas cooling is\nsuppressed in massive dark halos, the amount of cold gas accreted onto SMBHs\ndecreases with cosmic time. Moreover, AGN lifetime increases with cosmic time.\nThus, at low redshifts, major mergers do not always lead to luminous AGNs.\nBecause the luminosity of AGNs is correlated with the mass of accreted gas onto\nSMBHs, the space density of luminous AGNs decreases more quickly than that of\nfaint AGNs.

In this Letter, we focus on the\ndifferent photocurrent generation mechanisms in a double-gated WSe2 device by\nmeasuring the photocurrent (and photovoltage) as the local gate voltages are\nvaried independently in combination with above- and below-bandgap illumination.\nThis enables us to distinguish between two main photocurrent generation\nmechanisms: the photovoltaic and photothermoelectric effect. We find that the\ndominant mechanism depends on the defined gate configuration. In the PN and NP\nconfigurations, photocurrent is mainly generated by the photovoltaic effect and\nthe device displays a maximum responsivity of 0.70 mA/W at 532 nm illumination\nand rise and fall times close to 10 ms. Photocurrent generated by the\nphotothermoelectric effect emerges in the PP configuration and is a factor of\ntwo larger than the current generated by the photovoltaic effect (in PN and NP\nconfigurations). This demonstrates that the photothermoelectric effect can play\na significant role in devices based on WSe2 where a region of strong optical\nabsorption, caused by e.g. an asymmetry in flake thickness or optical\nabsorption of the electrodes, generates a sizeable thermal gradient upon\nillumination.\n","Comment: Main text (4 figures) + Supp. Info.
