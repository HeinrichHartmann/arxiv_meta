The inner disk component has a temperature close to\nthe dust sublimation temperature and a quite narrow intensity distribution with\na radial extension from 0.11 AU to 0.14 AU.\n  Conclusions: Both our geometric and temperature-gradient models suggest that\nthe T Tauri star S CrA N is surrounded by a circumstellar disk that is\ntruncated at an inner radius of ~0.11 AU. The narrow extension of the inner\ntemperature-gradient disk component implies that there is a hot inner rim.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A, 7 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables"]}]

An explicit error probability analysis of the SWN\nreceiver is used to show that it achieves the quantum limit on the error\nprobability exponent, which is shown to be a factor of four greater than the\nerror probability exponent of an ideal heterodyne-detection receiver on the\nsame ensemble. We generalize the philosophy of the SWN receiver, which is\nitself adapted from some existing coherent-state receivers, and propose a\nreceiver -- the Sequential Testing (ST) receiver-- for discriminating n copies\nof M pure quantum states from an arbitrary Hilbert space. The ST receiver is\nshown to achieve the quantum Chernoff exponent in the limit of a large number\nof copies, and is remarkable in requiring only local operations and classical\ncommunication (LOCC) to do so. In particular, it performs adaptive copy-by-copy\nbinary projective measurements. Apart from being of fundamental interest, these\nresults are relevant to communication, sensing, and imaging systems that use\nlaser light and to photonic implementations of quantum information processing\nprotocols in general.\n","Comment: Performance comparison for PPM signals added; analysis in\n  Supplementary material clarified; 9 pages + 3 pages supplementary material, 4\n  figures"]}]

This is done by means of spectral energy distribution (SED)\nfitting. We use the excellent spectral coverage of the AKARI infrared space\ntelescope together with the rich ancillary data available in the NEP to build\nSEDs extending from UV to far-IR wavelengths. Through SED fitting we constrain\nboth the AGN and host galaxy components. We find a significant AGN component in\nour sample of relatively faint radio-sources ($<$mJy), that increases in power\nwith increasing radio-luminosity. At the highest radio-luminosities, the\npresence of powerful jets dominates the radio emission of these sources. A\npositive correlation is found between the luminosity of the AGN component and\nthat of star-formation in the host galaxy, independent of the radio luminosity.\nBy contrast, for a given redshift and AGN luminosity, we find that increasing\nradio-luminosity leads to a decrease in the specific star-formation rate. The\nmost radio-loud AGN are found to lie on the main sequence of star-formation for\ntheir respective redshifts. For the first time, such a two-sided feedback\nprocess is seen in the same sample.

These multiple types\nof links are usually represented by a multiplex network in which each layer has\na different topology. In real-world networks, however, not all nodes are\npresent on every layer. To generate a more realistic scenario, we use a\ngeneralized multiplex network and assume that only a fraction $q$ of the nodes\nare shared by the layers. We develop a theoretical framework for a branching\nprocess to describe the spread of an epidemic on these partially overlapped\nmultiplex networks.

We also theoretically determine the dependence of the epidemic\nthreshold on the fraction $q > 0$ of shared nodes in a system composed of two\nlayers. We find that in the limit of $q \\to 0$ the threshold is dominated by\nthe layer with the smaller isolated threshold. Although a system of two\ncompletely isolated networks is nearly indistinguishable from a system of two\nnetworks that share just a few nodes, we find that the presence of these few\nshared nodes causes the epidemic threshold of the isolated network with the\nlower propagating capacity to change discontinuously and to acquire the\nthreshold of the other network.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 4 figures"]}]

It relies on the disordered\nlocal moment formalism and the observation that the reduced magnetization in\neach of the investigated materials is accurately described by an equation of\nthe form $M(T)/M(0) = [ 1 -s (T/T_{\\rm C})^{3/2}- (1-s)(T/T_{\\rm C})^{p}\n]^{q}$. The present approach yields interesting results. The alloys at zero\nKelvin share several physical properties: the volume in a partially disordered\nlocal moment state shrinks as the fraction of Fe moments which point down\nincreases in the interval $0 < x^{{\\rm Fe}\\downarrow} < 1/2$, following closely\n$V(0) - 4 [V(0)-V(1/2)] x^{{\\rm Fe}\\downarrow} (1-x^{{\\rm Fe}\\downarrow})$,\nwhile the magnetization collapses, following closely $M(0) - 2 M(0) x^{{\\rm\nFe}\\downarrow}$; the volume in the homogeneous ferromagnetic state greatly\nexceeds that in the disordered local moment state; $x^{{\\rm Fe}\\downarrow}(0)$\nis close to zero. These common properties can account for a variety of\nintriguing phenomena displayed by both alloys, including the anomaly in the\nmagnetostriction at zero Kelvin and, more surprisingly perhaps, the scaling\nbetween the reduced magnetostriction and the reduced magnetization squared\nbelow the Curie temperature. However, the thermal evolution of the fraction of\nFe moments which point down depends strongly on the alloy under consideration.\nThis, in turn, can explain the observed marked difference in the temperature\ndependence of the reduced magnetization between the two alloys.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 7 figures, JPCM format"]}]

We observed a sample of\n59 high-mass star-forming regions at different evolutionary stages varying from\nthe early starless phase of infrared dark clouds to high-mass protostellar\nobjects to hot molecular cores and, finally, ultra-compact HII regions at 1mm\nand 3mm with the IRAM 30m telescope.

On average, the molecular abundances increase with time.\nWe modeled the chemical evolution, using a 1D physical model where density and\ntemperature vary from stage to stage coupled with an advanced gas-grain\nchemical model and derived the best-fit chi^2 values of all relevant\nparameters. A satisfying overall agreement between observed and modeled column\ndensities for most of the molecules was obtained.

In particular, most invasive\nplants are clonal, cluster through vegetative propagation, and compete locally.\nDispersal limitation implies that invasive spread occurs as advance of an\necological interface between invader and resident species. Interspecific\ncompetition along the interface produces random variation in the extent of\ninvasive growth. Development of these random fluctuations, termed stochastic\nroughening, will often structure the interface as a self-affine fractal; a\nseries of power-law scaling relationships follows as a result. For a diverse\narray of local growth processes exhibiting both forward and lateral\npropagation, the extent of invader advance becomes spatially correlated along\nthe interface, and the width of the interface (the area where invader and\nresident compete directly) increases as a power function of time. Once\nroughening equilibrates statistically, interface width and the location of the\nmost advanced invader (the \"front-runner\") beyond the mean incursion should\nboth increase as a power function of interface length. To test these\npredictions, we let white clover (Trifolium repens) invade ryegrass (Lolium\nperenne) experimentally. Spatial correlation developed as anticipated, and both\ninterface width and the front-runner's lead scaled as a power law of length.\nHowever, the scaling exponents differed, likely a consequence of clover's\ngrowth morphology. The theory of kinetic roughening offers a new framework for\nunderstanding causes and consequences of spatial pattern in between-species\ninteraction, and indicates when interface measures at a local scale predict\nproperties of an invasive front at extended spatial scales.\n"]}]
