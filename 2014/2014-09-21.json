One of the important technical point of our proof is an\n$\\displaystyle L^{2\\over m}$ extension theorem of Ohsawa-Takegoshi type, which\nis derived from the original result by a simple fixed point method. Moreover,\nwe show that these techniques combined with an appropriate form of\nthe\"invariance of plurigenera\" can be used in order to obtain a new proof of\nthe celebrated Y.
