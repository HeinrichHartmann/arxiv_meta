This material has been studied for decades in\nabsorption against background sources, but the sparseness of these inherently\none-dimensional probes preclude direct constraints on the three-dimensional\nmorphology of the underlying web. Here we report observations of a cosmic web\nfilament in Lyman-alpha emission, discovered during a survey for cosmic gas\nfluorescently \"illuminated\" by bright quasars at z=2.3. With a projected size\nof approximately 460 physical kpc, the Lyman-alpha emission surrounding the\nradio-quiet quasar UM287 extends well beyond the virial radius of any plausible\nassociated dark matter halo. The estimated cold gas mass of the nebula from the\nobserved emission is at least ten times larger than what is typically found by\ncosmological simulations, suggesting that a population of intergalactic gas\nclumps with sub-kpc sizes may be missing within current numerical models.\n","Comment: Published in Nature on January 19th, 2014 (online); 9 pages, 7\n  figures; includes \"Methods\" section.
