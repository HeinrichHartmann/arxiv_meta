We present experimental results on randomly\ngenerated graphs with different statistical properties, showing the crucial\neffects of the implementation, the robustness, and the empirical scalability of\nour intelligent algorithm. Furthermore, the computational experiments show that\nthe proposed strategy outperforms the heuristics recommended in the literature\nand is able to obtain optimal or near-optimal solutions in short computational\nrunning time.\n","Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the authors due to major\n  modifications on the algorithm which make obsolete and inconsistent the\n  computational results reported"]}]

In the context of star\nformation, many computational studies show that the mass spectrum of density\nand velocity fluctuations within dense clouds, as well as the distribution of\ntheir angular momenta, trace their origin to the statistical and physical\nproperties of gas that is lashed with shock waves. In this article, we review\nthe observations, simulations, and theories of how turbulent-like processes can\naccount for structures we see in molecular clouds. We then compare traditional\nideas of supersonic turbulence with a simpler physical model involving the\neffects of multiple shock waves and their interaction in the interstellar\nmedium. Planar intersecting shock waves produce dense filaments, and generate\nvortex sheets that are essential to create the broad range of density and\nvelocity structure in clouds. As an example, the lower mass behaviour of the\nstellar initial mass function can be traced to the tendency of a collection of\nshock waves to build-up a log-normal density distribution (or column density).\nVorticity - which is essential to produce velocity structure over a very broad\nrange of length scales in shocked clouds - can also be generated by the passage\nof curved shocks or intersecting planar shocks through such media. Two major\nadditional physical forces affect the structure of star forming gas - gravity\nand feedback processes from young stars.

By changing the\nneutrino luminosity and its decay time to obtain parametric explosions in\none-(1D) and two-dimensional (2D) models with or without a 13-isotope alpha\nnetwork, we study how the inclusion of nuclear burning could affect the\npostbounce dynamics for four progenitor models; three for 15.0 Msun stars, one\nfor an 11.2 Msun star. We find that the energy supply due to nuclear burning of\ninfalling material behind the shock can energize the shock expansion especially\nfor models that produce only marginal explosions in the absence of nuclear\nburning. These models are energized by nuclear energy deposition when the shock\nfront passes through the silicon-rich layer and/or later it touches the\noxygen-rich layer. Depending on the neutrino luminosity and its decay time, a\ndiagnostic energy of explosion increases up to a few times 10^50 erg for models\nwith nuclear burning compared to the corresponding models without. We point out\nthat these features are most remarkable for the Limongi-Chieffi progenitor in\nboth 1D and 2D, because the progenitor model possesses a massive oxygen layer\nwith its inner-edge radius being smallest among the employed progenitors, so\nthat the shock can touch the rich fuel on a shorter timescale after bounce. The\nenergy difference is generally smaller (~0.1-0.2 times 10^51 erg) in 2D than in\n1D (at most ~0.6 times 10^51 erg). This is because neutrino-driven convection\nand the shock instability in 2D models enhance the neutrino heating efficiency,\nwhich makes the contribution of nuclear burning relatively smaller compared to\n1D models. Considering uncertainties in progenitor models, our results indicate\nthat nuclear burning should remain as one of the important ingredients to\nfoster the onset of neutrino-driven explosions.\n","Comment: 41 pages, 24 figures, 2tables, 2 appendices, ApJ accepted"]}]

The\ndefining property of spatial networks is that edge distances are associated\nwith a cost, which may subtly influence the topology of the network. However,\nthe cost function over distance is rarely known, thus developing a model of\nconnections in spatial networks is a difficult task.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel model for capturing the interaction\nbetween spatial effects and network structure.

For example, a node's specific surroundings (e.g. network structure\nand node density) may make it more likely to form a long distance link than\nother nodes with the same degree. To capture this information, we attach a\nlatent variable to each node which represents a node's spatial reach. These\nvariables are inferred from the network structure using a Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo algorithm.\n  We experimentally evaluate our proposed model on 4 different types of\nreal-world spatial networks (e.g. transportation, biological, infrastructure,\nand social).

Here, we consider a simplified model to extract\nthe properties of this approach. We show that at the stable population size,\nthe structure of the frequency dependent evolutionary game emerges.

An intriguing analytical result of this work is that fitness of a\ngene depends on the current sex ratio in the subpopulation of its carriers, not\non the encoded individual strategy. Thus, the argument of the gene fitness\nfunction is not constant but is determined by the trajectory of the sex ratio\namong carriers of that gene. This aspect of the modelled phenomenon cannot be\nrevealed by the static analysis. Dynamics of the sex ratio among gene carriers\nis driven by a dynamic \"tug of war\" between female carriers expressing the\nencoded strategic trait value and random partners of male carriers expressing\nthe average population strategy (a primary sex ratio). This mechanism can be\ncalled \"double level selection\". Therefore, gene interest perspective leads to\nmulti-level selection.\n","Comment: 3 figures"]}]

It is well understood that the\ntwo types of cell divisions differ in terms of the stem cells' flexibility to\nexpand when needed.

In\nthis paper we study a stochastic model of a renewing tissue, and address the\noptimization problem of tissue architecture in the context of mutant\nproduction. Specifically, we study the process of tumor suppressor gene\ninactivation which usually takes place as a sequence of two consecutive \"hits\",\nand which is one of the most common patterns in carcinogenesis.

We show that such\nan instrument would have a dynamic range limited either by i) the readout noise\n(if perfect co-phasing), or ii) the photon noise due to stellar flux leakage\n(in the case of imperfect nulling). This concept is optimal when the readout\nnoise is not the main limitation, ie, for space interferometry or for ground\nbased observations of bright stellar hosts (apparent magnitude brighter than\n10).\n","Comment: 11 pages.

Starting from analytical\nresults for unweighted moments and general assumptions on the relation between\nmeasured and actual shear, we derive analytical expressions for the\nmultiplicative and additive bias, showing how these terms depend not only on\nthe shape measurement errors, but also on the properties of the source galaxies\n(namely, size, magnitude and spectral energy distribution). We are then able to\ncompute the amplitude of the systematics power spectrum and its scaling with\nredshift, while we propose a multigaussian expansion to model in a\nnon-parametric way its angular scale dependence. Our method allows to\nself-consistently propagate the systematics uncertainties to the finally\nobserved shear power spectrum, thus allowing us to quantify the departures from\nthe actual spectrum. We show that even a modest level of systematics can induce\nnon-negligible deviations, thus leading to a significant bias on the recovered\ncosmological parameters.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 5 tables, 4 figures"]}]

Specifically, we conduct experiments to track the\nmotion of aphids walking in a featureless circular arena in order to deduce\nindividual-level rules. We observe that each aphid transitions stochastically\nbetween a moving and a stationary state. Moving aphids follow a correlated\nrandom walk. The probabilities of motion state transitions, as well as the\nrandom walk parameters, depend strongly on distance to an aphid's nearest\nneighbor. For large nearest neighbor distances, when an aphid is essentially\nisolated, its motion is ballistic with aphids moving faster, turning less, and\nbeing less likely to stop. In contrast, for short nearest neighbor distances,\naphids move more slowly, turn more, and are more likely to become stationary;\nthis behavior constitutes an aggregation mechanism. From the experimental data,\nwe estimate the state transition probabilities and correlated random walk\nparameters as a function of nearest neighbor distance. With the\nindividual-level model established, we assess whether it reproduces the\nmacroscopic patterns of movement at the group level. To do so, we consider\nthree distributions, namely distance to nearest neighbor, angle to nearest\nneighbor, and percentage of population moving at any given time.

As a model, we use the chemotaxis\npathway of Escherichia coli, a canonical system for the study of how organisms\nsense, respond, and adapt to environmental stimuli. In bacterial chemotaxis,\nadaptation is mediated by two enzymes that localize to the clustered receptors\nand modulate their activity through methylation-demethylation.

These fluctuations arise\nfrom noise in the number of localized enzymes combined with saturated\nmodification kinetics between localized enzymes and receptor substrate. An\nanalytical model explains how saturated enzyme kinetics and large fluctuations\ncan coexist with an adapted state robust to variation in the expression level\nof the pathway constituents, a key requirement to ensure the functionality of\nindividual cells within a population.

This sequence of temperatures seems to reflect a corresponding\nhierarchy of the electronic correlations in the different bands.\n"]}]

Here we show that joint initialization,\nprojective readout and fast local and non-local gate operations are no longer\nconflicting requirements in those systems, even under ambient conditions. We\ndemonstrate high-fidelity initialization of a whole spin register (99 %) and\nsingle-shot readout of multiple individual nuclear spins by using the ancillary\nelectron spin of a nitrogen-vacancy defect in diamond. Implementation of a\nnovel non-local gate generic to our hybrid electron-nuclear quantum register\nallows to prepare entangled states of three nuclear spins, with fidelities\nexceeding 85 %. An important tool for scalable quantum computation is quantum\nerror correction. Combining, for the first time, optimal-control based error\navoidance with error correction, we realize a three-qubit phase-flip error\ncorrection algorithm. Utilizing optimal control, all of the above algorithms\nachieve fidelities approaching fault tolerant quantum operation, thus paving\nthe way to large scale integrations.

In the absence of such a deformation, a class of solutions can be found\nin the literature [R. Goswami and P. S.

However, when the phase-space is deformed, as implemented herein\nthis paper, we find that the singularity may be either removed or instead,\nattained faster. More precisely, for negative values of the deformation\nparameter, we identify the emergence of a negative pressure term, which slows\ndown the collapse so that the singularity is replaced with a bounce. In this\nrespect, the formation of a dynamical horizon can be avoided depending on the\nsuitable choice of the boundary surface of the star. Whereas for positive\nvalues, the pressure that originates from the deformation effects assists the\ncollapse toward the singularity formation. In this case, since the collapse\nspeed is unbounded, the condition on the horizon formation is always satisfied\nand furthermore the dynamical horizon develops earlier than when the\nphase-space deformations are absent.

The results can\noptionally be exported to Latex and Mathematica, or stored in a Python data\nstructure for further processing by other programs. For ease of use, we have\nimplemented an interactive mode for PyR@TE in form of an IPython Notebook.

While it is usually agreed that single-degenerate progenitor\nsystems would be luminous supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs), it was recently\nsuggested that double-degenerate progenitors might also go through a SSS phase.\nAims: We aim to examine the possibility of double-degenerate progenitor systems\nbeing SSSs, and place stringent upper limits on the maximally possible\ndurations of any SSS phases and expected number of these systems in a galactic\npopulation. Method: We employ the binary population synthesis code SeBa to\nexamine the mass-transfer characteristics of a possible SSS phase of\ndouble-degenerate type Ia SN progenitor systems for 1) the standard SeBa\nassumptions, and 2) an optimistic best-case scenario. The latter case\nestablishes firm upper limits on the possible population of supersoft source\ndouble-degenerate type Ia SN progenitor systems. Results: Our results indicate\nthat unlike what is expected for single-degenerate progenitor systems, the vast\nmajority of the material accreted by either pure wind mass transfer or a\ncombination of wind and RLOF mass transfer is helium rather than hydrogen. Even\nwith extremely optimistic assumptions concerning the mass-transfer and\nretention efficiencies, the average mass accreted by systems that eventually\nbecome double-degenerate type Ia SNe is small. Consequently, the lengths of\ntime that these systems may be SSSs are short, even under optimal conditions,\nand the expected number of such systems in a galactic population is negligible.\nConclusions: The population of double-degenerate type Ia SN progenitors that\nare SSSs is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the population of\nsingle-degenerate progenitors expected to be SSSs, and the supersoft X-ray\nbehaviour of double-degenerate systems typically ceases long before the SN\nexplosions.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures, A&A accepted"]}]

To do this, two classes of massive (M* >= 10^10.5 Msun) galaxy are\nselected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Munich semi-analytic\nmodel of galaxy formation, L-Galaxies. The first class is selected by high\nspecific star formation rates (sSFR) and high Zg, and the second class by low\nsSFR and low Zg. These criteria roughly distinguish disc-dominant galaxies from\nmetal-poor, elliptical galaxies. In the semi-analytic model, the second class\nof galaxies obtain low sSFR and low Zg due to gradual dilution of the\ninterstellar medium by accretion of metal-poor gas via infalling clumps and\nlow-mass satellites. This occurs after a merger-induced starburst and the\nassociated supernova feedback have quenched most of the original gas reservoir.\nA number of signatures of this evolution are present in these model galaxies at\nz=0, including low gas fractions, large central black holes, elliptical\nmorphologies, old ages, and importantly, low (Zg-Z*) indicating dilution after\nstar formation. Remarkably, all of these properties are also found in low-sSFR,\nlow-Zg, massive galaxies in the SDSS-DR7.

Because CEMP-s stars have\nhardly evolved since their formation, the study of their observed abundances\nprovides a way to probe our models of AGB nucleosynthesis at low metallicity.\nTo this end we included in our binary evolution model the results of the latest\nmodels of AGB nucleosynthesis and we simulated a grid of 100,000 binary stars\nat metallicity Z=0.0001 in a wide range of initial masses and separations. We\ncompared our modelled stars with a sample of 60 CEMP-s stars from the SAGA\ndatabase of metal-poor stars. For each observed CEMP-s star of the sample we\nfound the modelled star that reproduces best the observed abundances. The\nresult of this comparison is that we are able to reproduce simultaneously the\nobserved abundance of the elements affected by AGB nucleosynthesis (e.g. C, Mg,\ns-elements) for about 60% of the stars in the sample.\n","Comment: 4 pages, proceedings of the Conference \"Setting a new standard in the\n  analysis of binary stars\" held 16-19 September 2013 in Leuven.

Advances\nin next-generation sequencing technologies will lead to many more rare variants\nassociation studies. Several statistical methods have been proposed to assess\nthe effect of rare variants by aggregating information from multiple loci\nacross a genetic region and testing the association between the phenotype and\naggregated genotype. One limitation of existing methods is that they only look\ninto the marginal effects of rare variants but do not systematically take into\naccount effects due to interactions among rare variants and between rare\nvariants and environmental factors. In this article, we propose the summation\nof partition approach (SPA), a robust model-free method that is designed\nspecifically for detecting both marginal effects and effects due to gene-gene\n(G-G) and gene-environmental (G-E) interactions for rare variants association\nstudies. SPA has three advantages. First, it accounts for the interaction\ninformation and gains considerable power in the presence of unknown and\ncomplicated G-G or G-E interactions. Secondly, it does not sacrifice the\nmarginal detection power; in the situation when rare variants only have\nmarginal effects it is comparable with the most competitive method in current\nliterature. Thirdly, it is easy to extend and can incorporate more complex\ninteractions; other practitioners and scientists can tailor the procedure to\nfit their own study friendly.

We interpret these two configurations as\ncorresponding to chiral-symmetry breaking and preserving phases, respectively.\nWe present a simple diagnostic tool to examine the classical stability of the\nembedding, based on the concavity/convexity conditions for the relevant\nthermodynamic potentials. We use this criterion to show that U-shaped probes\nthat explore the walking region are unstable, hence providing a dynamical\norigin for the tachyonic mode found in the literature. Whenever this occurs,\nthe disconnected solution becomes favored energetically. We find that in one of\nthe two classes of backgrounds the U-shaped embedding is always unstable, and\nthus never realised dynamically. Consequently, these models cannot be used to\ndescribe chiral-symmetry breaking. In the second category of solutions, our\nanalysis reveals the presence of a first-order phase transition between\nchiral-symmetry broken and restored phases. Interestingly, this is in the same\nclass that contains a parametrically light scalar in the spectrum of glueballs\nof the dual field theory.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 8 figures; v2 minor corrections, results and analysis\n  unaffected, references amended"]}]

The optimal strategy for resolving a weak\nstochastic signal force on a huge background (typically given by thermal noise)\nis a crucial and debated topic, and the stability of the mechanical resonance\nis a further, related critical issue. We introduce and analyze the parametric\ncontrol of the optical spring, that allows to stabilize the resonance and\nprovides a phase reference for the oscillator motion, yet conserving a free\nevolution in one quadrature of the phase space. We also study quantitatively\nthe characteristics of our micro opto-mechanical system as detector of\nstochastic force for short measurement times (for quick, high resolution\nmonitoring) as well as for the longer term observations that optimize the\nsensitivity. We compare a simple, naive strategy based on the evaluation of the\nvariance of the displacement (that is a widely used technique) with an optimal\nWiener-Kolmogorov data analysis. We show that, thanks to the parametric\nstabilization of the effective susceptibility, we can more efficiently\nimplement Wiener filtering, and we investigate how this strategy improves the\nperformance of our system.

It envisages the possibility that a fraction of\nlow- and very low-mass cluster stars may accrete the ejecta of interacting\nmassive binary (and possibly also fast rotating massive) stars during the fully\nconvective, pre-main sequence stage, to reproduce the CN and ONa\nanticorrelations observed among stars in individual clusters. This scenario is\nassumed to be able to explain the presence (and properties) of the multiple\npopulations in the majority of globular clusters in the Milky Way. Here we have\nconsidered the well studied cluster NGC 2808, which displays a triple main\nsequence with well defined and separate He abundances. Knowledge of these\nabundances allowed us to put strong constraints on the He mass fraction and\namount of matter to be accreted by low-mass pre-main sequence stars. We find\nthat the minimum He mass fraction in the accreted gas has to be $\\sim0.44$ to\nproduce the observed sequences and that at fixed initial mass of the accreting\nstar, different efficiencies for the accretion are required to produce stars\nplaced onto the multiple main sequences. This may be explained by differences\nin the orbital properties of the progenitors and/or different spatial\ndistribution of intracluster gas with varying He abundances. Both O-Na and C-N\nanticorrelations appear naturally along the main sequences, once considering\nthe predicted relationship between He and CNONa abundances in the ejecta of the\npolluters. As a consequence of the accretion, we predict no discontinuity\nbetween the abundance ranges covered by intermediate and blue main sequence\nstars, but we find a sizeable (several 0.1 dex) discontinuity of the N and Na\nabundances between objects on the intermediate and red main sequences.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 9 figures, Astronomy & Astrophysics in press"]}]

The fraction of each clouds type depends on the cloud-cloud\ninteractions, which cause mergers to build up the GMA Type Bs and tidal\nfeatures in which the Type C clouds are formed. The number of cloud\ninteractions is greatest in the bar, followed by the spiral, causing a higher\nfraction of both cloud types compared to the disc.

We also detail an\napproach to account for nebular emission lines in the SED fitting process -\nwherein our models predict the strength of the [O III] line in an LAE spectrum.\nWe are able to study the success of this prediction because we can compare the\nmodel predictions to our actual near-infrared observations both in galaxies\nthat have [O III] detections and those that yielded non-detections.

The graphlet kernel of Shervashidze et\nal. [32] uses induced sub-graphs of k nodes (christened as graphlets by Przulj\n[28]) as motifs in the vector representation, and computes the kernel via a dot\nproduct between these vectors. One can easily show that this is a valid kernel\nbetween graphs. However, such a vector representation suffers from a few\ndrawbacks.
