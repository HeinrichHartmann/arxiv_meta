(2011) totalling 126 galaxies, covering a 2 dex metallicity\nrange, with 30% of the sample with 12+log(O/H) < 8.0. The dust masses are\nhomogeneously determined with a semi-empirical dust model, including submm\nconstraints. The atomic and molecular gas masses are compiled from the\nliterature. Two XCO are used to estimate molecular gas masses: the Galactic\nXCO, and a XCO depending on the metallicity (as Z^{-2}). Correlations with\nmorphological types, stellar masses, star formation rates and specific star\nformation rates are discussed. The trend between G/D and metallicity is\nempirically modelled using power-laws (slope of -1 and free) and a broken\npower-law. We compare the evolution of the G/D with predictions from chemical\nevolution models. We find that out of the five tested galactic parameters,\nmetallicity is the galactic property driving the observed G/D. The G/D versus\nmetallicity relation cannot be represented by a power-law with a slope of -1\nover the whole metallicity range. The observed trend is steeper for\nmetallicities lower than ~ 8.0. A large scatter is observed in the G/D for a\ngiven metallicity, with a dispersion of 0.37 dex in metallicity bins of ~0.1\ndex. The broken power-law reproduces best the observed G/D and provides\nestimates of the G/D that are accurate to a factor of 1.6. The good agreement\nof the G/D and its scatter with the three tested chemical evolution models\nshows that the scatter is intrinsic to galactic properties, reflecting the\ndifferent star formation histories, dust destruction efficiencies, dust grain\nsize distributions and chemical compositions across the sample.

We discuss different formation scenarios for\nthese KDCs in cluster environments and find that dwarf-dwarf wet mergers or gas\naccretion can explain the properties of these KDCs. Both of these mechanisms\nrequire that the progenitor had a close companion with a low relative velocity.\nThis suggests that KDCs were formed in galaxy pairs residing in a poor group\nenvironment or in isolation whose subsequent infall into the cluster quenched\nstar formation.\n","Comment: 14 pages, accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

This\nproblem departs from the previous studies on social influence maximization or\nseed minimization because it considers influence coverage with probabilistic\nguarantees instead of guarantees on expected influence coverage. We show that\nthe problem is not submodular, and thus is harder than previously studied\nproblems based on submodular function optimization. We provide an approximation\nalgorithm and show that it approximates the optimal solution with both a\nmultiplicative ratio and an additive error. The multiplicative ratio is tight\nwhile the additive error would be small if influence coverage distributions of\ncertain seed sets are well concentrated. For one-way bipartite graphs we\nanalytically prove the concentration condition and obtain an approximation\nalgorithm with an $O(\\log n)$ multiplicative ratio and an $O(\\sqrt{n})$\nadditive error, where $n$ is the total number of nodes in the social graph.\nMoreover, we empirically verify the concentration condition in real-world\nnetworks and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\nalgorithm comparing to commonly adopted benchmark algorithms.\n","Comment: Conference version will appear in KDD 2014"]}]

We\nprove that a polynomial of degree $d$ with $2d$ regularly spaced roots on the\nunit circle is a local maximum of the distance to the discriminant among\npolynomials with the same norm and number of roots. We conjecture that it is a\nglobal maximum and that the polynomial of degree $d$ with $2r$ regularly spaced\nroots on the unit circle is also a similar global maximum when $d < r \\leq 2d$.\nThis claim is supported by the fact that we were able to prove the consequence\nof this together with corollary \\ref{comblinbis} which yields to interesting\ntrigonometric identities that we could not find somewhere else (proposition\n\\ref{trigo} page \\pageref{trigo}).

Second, we will briefly relate\nrenormalization to Ernest Nagel's account of inter-theoretic relations,\nespecially reduction (Section 4).\n  One theme will be a contrast between two approaches to renormalization. The\nold approach, which prevailed from ca. 1945 to 1970, treated renormalizability\nas a necessary condition for being an acceptable quantum field theory. On this\napproach, it is a piece of great good fortune that high energy physicists can\nformulate renormalizable quantum field theories that are so empirically\nsuccessful. But the new approach to renormalization (from 1970 onwards)\nexplains why the phenomena we see, at the energies we can access in our\nparticle accelerators, are described by a renormalizable quantum field theory.\nFor whatever non-renormalizable interactions may occur at yet higher energies,\nthey are insignificant at accessible energies. Thus the new approach explains\nwhy our best fundamental theories have a feature, viz. renormalizability, which\nthe old approach treated as a selection principle for theories.\n  We also maintain that universality, a concept stressed in renormalization\ntheory, is essentially the familiar philosophical idea of multiple\nrealizability; and that it causes no problems for reductions of a Nagelian\nkind.\n","Comment: 48 pages, 1 figure, Forthcoming in Metaphysics in Contemporary\n  Physics: a volume of Poznan Studies in Philosophy of Science, eds.

In many\napplications information is only relevant for a fixed range of scales. We\npresent an algorithm to construct a hierarchical net-tree up to scale t which\nwe denote as the net-forest. We present a method based on Locality Sensitive\nHashing to compute all near neighbours of points within a certain distance. Our\nconstruction of the net-forest is probabilistic, and we guarantee that with\nhigh probability, the net-forest is supplemented with the correct neighbouring\ninformation. We apply our net-forest construction scheme to create an\napproximate Cech complex up to a fixed scale; and its complexity depends on the\nlocal intrinsic dimension up to that scale.\n","Comment: 13 pages"]}]
