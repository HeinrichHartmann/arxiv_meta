We discuss different formation scenarios for\nthese KDCs in cluster environments and find that dwarf-dwarf wet mergers or gas\naccretion can explain the properties of these KDCs. Both of these mechanisms\nrequire that the progenitor had a close companion with a low relative velocity.\nThis suggests that KDCs were formed in galaxy pairs residing in a poor group\nenvironment or in isolation whose subsequent infall into the cluster quenched\nstar formation.\n","Comment: 14 pages, accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

This\nproblem departs from the previous studies on social influence maximization or\nseed minimization because it considers influence coverage with probabilistic\nguarantees instead of guarantees on expected influence coverage. We show that\nthe problem is not submodular, and thus is harder than previously studied\nproblems based on submodular function optimization. We provide an approximation\nalgorithm and show that it approximates the optimal solution with both a\nmultiplicative ratio and an additive error. The multiplicative ratio is tight\nwhile the additive error would be small if influence coverage distributions of\ncertain seed sets are well concentrated. For one-way bipartite graphs we\nanalytically prove the concentration condition and obtain an approximation\nalgorithm with an $O(\\log n)$ multiplicative ratio and an $O(\\sqrt{n})$\nadditive error, where $n$ is the total number of nodes in the social graph.\nMoreover, we empirically verify the concentration condition in real-world\nnetworks and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\nalgorithm comparing to commonly adopted benchmark algorithms.\n","Comment: Conference version will appear in KDD 2014"]}]

We\nprove that a polynomial of degree $d$ with $2d$ regularly spaced roots on the\nunit circle is a local maximum of the distance to the discriminant among\npolynomials with the same norm and number of roots. We conjecture that it is a\nglobal maximum and that the polynomial of degree $d$ with $2r$ regularly spaced\nroots on the unit circle is also a similar global maximum when $d < r \\leq 2d$.\nThis claim is supported by the fact that we were able to prove the consequence\nof this together with corollary \\ref{comblinbis} which yields to interesting\ntrigonometric identities that we could not find somewhere else (proposition\n\\ref{trigo} page \\pageref{trigo}).

We extend Akbar--Cai derivation\n[hep-th/0609128] of Friedmann equations to accommodate a general entropy-area\nlaw. Studying the resulted Friedmann equations using a specific entropy-area\nlaw, which is motivated by the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP), reveals\nthe existence of a maximum energy density closed to Planck density. Allowing\nfor a general continuous pressure $p(\\rho,a)$ leads to bounded curvature\ninvariants and a general nonsingular evolution. In this case, the maximum\nenergy density is reached in a finite time and there is no cosmological\nevolution beyond this point which leaves the big bang singularity inaccessible\nfrom a spacetime prospective. The existence of maximum energy density and a\ngeneral nonsingular evolution is independent of the equation of state and the\nspacial curvature $k$. As an example we study the evolution of the equation of\nstate $p=\\omega \\rho$ through its phase-space diagram to show the existence of\na maximum energy which is reachable in a finite time.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 1 figure, minor revisions, To appear in JHEP"]}]

Thus the new approach explains\nwhy our best fundamental theories have a feature, viz. renormalizability, which\nthe old approach treated as a selection principle for theories.\n  We also maintain that universality, a concept stressed in renormalization\ntheory, is essentially the familiar philosophical idea of multiple\nrealizability; and that it causes no problems for reductions of a Nagelian\nkind.\n","Comment: 48 pages, 1 figure, Forthcoming in Metaphysics in Contemporary\n  Physics: a volume of Poznan Studies in Philosophy of Science, eds.
