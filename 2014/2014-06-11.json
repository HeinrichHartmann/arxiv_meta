As a function of the Hamiltonian\nparameters, the system is tuned through a dynamical transition, similar to the\nground state critical point, at which the local spin correlations establish\ntrue long range temporal order.

In particular, samarium hexaboride (SmB$_6$) has drawn much\nattention as it might represent a new class of condensed matter called\ntopological Kondo insulator. Kondo insulators (KI) can have non-trivial Z$_2$\ntopology because the energy gap opens at the Fermi energy ($E_F$) by\nhybridization between an odd- parity renormalized $f$ band and an even- parity\nconduction $d$ band. However, the characteristics of SmB$_6$ deviate from the\nconventional KI because its gap is insensitive to doping and pressure. Thus, it\nis unclear what makes the gap of SmB$_6$ different from that of KI, and how the\nband inversion features occur. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the\nimportance of charge fluctuations in SmB$_6$. Our angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES) results reveal that with decreasing temperature the bottom\nof the $d$-$f$ hybridized band at the $\\bar{\\text{X}}$ point gradually shifts\nfrom below to above $E_F$. This shift accompanies a redistribution of spectral\nweight from the upper to the lower quasiparticle band, and reflects the change\nin both carrier density and the number of localized $f$ electron. Moreover,\nbecause this hybridized band is predicted to have odd parity and to induce a\nnon-trivial $Z_{2}$ topology, we compare our ARPES spectra with theoretical\nsurface band structures and find signatures of topological surface states.\nTherefore, our results indicate that SmB$_6$ is a charge fluctuating\ntopological insulator having the odd-parity hybridized band above $E_F$ at the\n$X$ point.

The dependence of\nseveral parameters on initial rotation is studied. These parameters include\nmass, luminosity, temperature, lifetimes, equatorial velocity, surface\nabundances, and rates of period change. Several key results are obtained: i)\nmass-luminosity (M-L) relations depend on rotation, particularly during the\nblue loop phase; ii) luminosity increases between crossings of the IS. Hence,\nCepheid M-L relations at fixed initial rotation rate depend on crossing number\n(faster rotation yields greater luminosity difference between crossings); iii)\nthe Cepheid mass discrepancy problem vanishes when rotation and crossing number\nare taken into account, without a need for high core overshooting values or\nenhanced mass loss; iv) rotation creates dispersion around average parameters\npredicted at fixed mass and metallicity.

In particular, in dual space, small and large momenta\ndo not mix under renormalization, and therefore perturbative constraints from a\nshort-distance expansion in the parton picture can be implemented independently\nfrom non-perturbative modelling of long-distance effects. It also allows to\n(locally) resum perturbative logarithms from large dual momenta at fixed values\nof the renormalization scale. We construct a generic procedure to combine\nperturbative and non-perturbative information on the B-meson LCDA and compare\ndifferent model functions and the resulting logarithmic moments which are the\nrelevant hadronic parameters in QCD factorization theorems for exclusive\nB-meson decays.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 5 figures, minor layout issues resolved"]}]

Our model includes exchange and dipolar interactions, a\ncubic anisotropy term, and uniaxial out-of-plane and in-plane ones. According\nto the set of parameters chosen, the model including uniaxial out-of-plane\nanisotropy has a ground-state which consists of a canted state with stripes of\nopposite out-of-plane magnetization. When the cubic anisotropy is introduced\nzigzag patterns appear in the stripes at fields close to the remanence. An\nanalysis of the anisotropy terms of the model shows that this configuration is\nrelated to specific values of the ratio between the cubic and the effective\nuniaxial anisotropy. The mechanism behind this effect is related to particular\nfeatures of the anisotropy's energy landscape, since a global minima transition\nas a function of the applied field is required in the anisotropy terms. This\nnew mechanism for zigzags formation could be present in monocrystal\nferromagnetic thin films in a given range of thicknesses.\n","Comment: 910 pages, 10 figures"]}]

In the topologically trivial phase, the system undergos an\nabrupt transition from unbroken PT-symmetry region to spontaneously broken\n$\\mathcal{PT} $-symmetry region at a certain $\\gamma_{c}$, and a second\ntransition occurs at another transition point $\\gamma_{c^{'}}$ when further\nincreasing the strength of the imaginary potential $\\gamma$. But in the\ntopologically nontrivial phase, the zero-mode edge states become unstable for\narbitrary nonzero $\\gamma$ and the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry of the system is\nspontaneously broken, which is characterized by the emergence of a pair of\nconjugated imaginary modes.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures, Phys.

We show that such a pattern applies\nuniformly in call-by-name, call-by-value, and call-by-need, catching many\nmachines in the literature. We start by distilling the KAM, the CEK, and the\nZINC, and then provide simplified versions of the SECD, the lazy KAM, and\nSestoft's machine. Along the way we also introduce some new machines with\nglobal environments. Moreover, we show that distillation preserves the time\ncomplexity of the executions, i.e. the LSC is a complexity-preserving\nabstraction of abstract machines.\n","Comment: 63 pages"]}]

Unfortunately, it was\nrecently proved [F\\\"ugger et al., ASYNC'13] that no existing binary-valued\ncircuit model proposed so far, including the two most commonly used pure and\ninertial delay channels, faithfully captures glitch propagation: For the simple\nShort-Pulse Filtration (SPF) problem, which is related to a circuit's ability\nto suppress a single glitch, we showed that the quite broad class of bounded\nsingle-history channels either contradict the unsolvability of SPF in bounded\ntime or the solvability of SPF in unbounded time in physical circuits.\n  In this paper, we propose a class of binary circuit models that do not suffer\nfrom this deficiency: Like bounded single-history channels, our involution\nchannels involve delays that may depend on the time of the previous output\ntransition. Their characteristic property are delay functions which are based\non involutions, i.e., functions that form their own inverse. A concrete example\nof such a delay function, which is derived from a generalized first-order\nanalog circuit model, reveals that this is not an unrealistic assumption. We\nprove that, in sharp contrast to what is possible with bounded single-history\nchannels, SPF cannot be solved in bounded time due to the nonexistence of a\nlower bound on the delay of involution channels, whereas it is easy to provide\nan unbounded SPF implementation. It hence follows that binary-valued circuit\nmodels based on involution channels allow to solve SPF precisely when this is\npossible in physical circuits.

Highly precise Doppler\nmeasurements were obtained using the Coralie high-resolution spectrograph since\n2011. Particular care was taken to sample all phase points in order to very\naccurately trace the RV curve during multiple epochs and to search for\ndifferences in linear radius variations derived from observations obtained at\ndifferent epochs. Different timescales are sampled, ranging from cycle-to-cycle\nto months and years. The unprecedented combination of excellent phase coverage\nobtained during multiple epochs and high precision enabled the discovery of\nsignificant modulation in the RV curves of the short-period s-Cepheids QZ\nNormae and V335 Puppis, as well as the long-period fundamental mode Cepheids l\nCarinae and RS Puppis. The modulations manifest as shape and amplitude\nvariations that vary smoothly on timescales of years for short-period Cepheids\nand from one pulsation cycle to the next in the long-period Cepheids. The order\nof magnitude of the effect ranges from several hundred m/s to a few km/s. The\nresulting difference among linear radius variations derived using data from\ndifferent epochs can lead to systematic errors of up to 15% for\nBaade-Wesselink-type distances, if the employed angular and linear radius\nvariations are not determined contemporaneously. The different natures of the\nCepheids exhibiting modulation in their RV curves suggests that this phenomenon\nis common. The observational baseline is not yet sufficient to conclude whether\nthese modulations are periodic. To ensure the accuracy of Baade-Wesselink\ndistances, angular and linear radius variations should always be determined\ncontemporaneously.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures, 1 table.

The\nconfiguration $x_0$ can correspond to the bottom of a (meta)stable well, while\nthe target $G$ could be either a set of saddle (exit) points of the well, or a\nset of further (meta)stable configurations. Three types of results are\nreported: (1) A general theory is developed, based on the path-wise approach to\nmetastability, which has three important attributes. First, it is general in\nthat it does not assume reversibility of the process, does not focus only on\nhitting times to rare events and does not assume a particular starting measure.\nSecond, it relies only on the natural hypothesis that the mean hitting time to\n$G$ is asymptotically longer than the mean recurrence time to $x_0$ or $G$.\nThird, despite its mathematical simplicity, the approach yields precise and\nexplicit bounds on the corrections to exponentiality. (2) We compare and relate\ndifferent metastability conditions proposed in the literature so to eliminate\npotential sources of confusion. This is specially relevant for evolutions of\ninfinite-volume systems, whose treatment depends on whether and how relevant\nparameters (temperature, fields) are adjusted.

This control is particularly relevant for\nsystems with unbounded state space where nucleations leading to exit from\nmetastability can happen anywhere in the volume.

In the limit of infinite range of the interactions, systems\nwill exhibit mean-field critical behavior, i.e., critical behavior not affected\nby fluctuations of the order parameter. If the interaction range is finite, the\ncritical behavior asymptotically close to the critical point is determined by\nfluctuations and the actual critical behavior depends on the particular\nuniversality class. A variety of systems, including fluids and anisotropic\nferromagnets, belongs to the three-dimensional Ising universality class. Recent\nnumerical studies of Ising models with different interaction ranges have\nrevealed a spectacular crossover between the asymptotic fluctuation-induced\ncritical behavior and mean-field-type critical behavior. In this work, we\ncompare these numerical results with a crossover Landau model based on\nrenormalization-group matching. For this purpose we consider an application of\nthe crossover Landau model to the three-dimensional Ising model without fitting\nto any adjustable parameters. The crossover behavior of the critical\nsusceptibility and of the order parameter is analyzed over a broad range (ten\norders) of the scaled distance to the critical temperature. The dependence of\nthe coupling constant on the interaction range, governing the crossover\ncritical behavior, is discussed\n","Comment: 10 pages in two-column format including 9 figures and 1 table.\n  Submitted to J.
