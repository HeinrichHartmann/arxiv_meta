At sufficiently\nlarge scales such as the BAO scale, a standard approach for the bias problem on\nthe basis of the perturbation theory (PT) is to assume the `local bias' model\nin which the density field of biased tracers is deterministically expanded in\nterms of matter density field at the same position. The higher-order bias\nparameters are then determined by combining the power spectrum with\nhigher-order statistics such as the bispectrum. As is pointed out by recent\nstudies, however, nonlinear gravitational evolution naturally induces nonlocal\nbias terms even if initially starting only with purely local bias. As a matter\nof fact, previous works showed that the second-order nonlocal bias term, which\ncorresponds to the gravitational tidal field, is important to explain the\ncharacteristic scale-dependence of the bispectrum. In this paper we extend the\nnonlocal bias term up to third order, and investigate whether the PT-based\nmodel including nonlocal bias terms can simultaneously explain the power\nspectrum and the bispectrum of simulated halos in $N$-body simulations. We show\nthat the power spectrum, including density and momentum, and the bispectrum\nbetween halo and matter in $N$-body simulations can be simultaneously well\nexplained by the model including up to third-order nonlocal bias terms up to\nk~0.1h/Mpc. Also, the results seem in a good agreement with theoretical\npredictions of a simple coevolution picture, although the agreement is not\nperfect. These demonstration clearly shows a failure of the local bias model\neven at such large scales, and we conclude that nonlocal bias terms should be\nconsistently included in order to model statistics of halos.

Our analysis focuses on a one-dimensional version of the model\n(i.e. a single two-leg ladder) where we consider two forms of spin-Peierls (SP)\ninstabilities on the legs: columnar dimers (CD) and staggered dimers (SD).

The order parameter, which reflects the interplay\nbetween the SP and rung interactions, represents a crystal of 4-spin plaquettes\non which longitudinal and transverse dimers are in a superposition.

Sunspots\nare believed to result from the eruption of magnetic flux-tubes rising from the\ndeep interior of the Sun. The strong magnetic field locally reduces convective\nheat transport to the solar surface. Such flux-tube models have also been\ninvoked to explain starspot properties. However, these models use several\nsimplifications and so far the generation of either sunspots or starspots has\nnot been demonstrated in a self-consistent simulation of stellar magnetic\nconvection. Here we show that direct numerical simulations of a distributed\ndynamo operating in a density-stratified rotating spherical shell can\nspontaneously generate cool spots. Convection in the interior of the model\nproduces a large scale magnetic field which interacts with near surface\ngranular convection leading to strong concentrations of magnetic flux and\nformation of starspots.

Starting from vanishing initial\nconditions for the scalar field and for a time-dependent matter density\ncorresponding to the formation of an overdensity, we numerically check that the\nscalar field converges to the static solution. If $W_{-}$ is bounded, for\nhigh-density objects there are no static solutions throughout space, but one\ncan still define a static solution restricted to large radii. Our dynamical\nstudy shows that the scalar field relaxes to this static solution at large\nradii, whereas spatial gradients keep growing with time at smaller radii. If\n$W_{-}$ is not bounded but non-monotonic, there is an infinite number of\ndiscontinuous static solutions but they are not physical and these models are\nnot theoretically sound. Such K-mouflage scenarios provide an example of\ntheories that can appear viable at the cosmological level, for the cosmological\nbackground and perturbative analysis, while being meaningless at a nonlinear\nlevel for small-scale configurations. This shows the importance of small-scale\nnonlinear analysis of screening models.\n","Comment: 20 pages"]}]

Several theoretical models\nimplement AGN feedback to explain the observed galaxy luminosity function, and\npossibly the color and morphological transformation of spiral galaxies into\npassive ellipticals. To understand the importance of AGN feedback, a study of\nthe AGN populations in the radio-optical domain is crucial. A mass sequence\nlinking star-forming galaxies and AGN has been already noted in previous works,\nand it is now investigated as possible evolutionary sequence. We observed a\nsample of 119 intermediate-redshift (0.04<z<0.4) SDSS-FIRST radio emitters with\nthe Effelsberg 100-m telescope at 4.85 and 10.45 GHz and obtained spectral\nindices. We find indications of spectral index flattening in high-metallicity\nstar-forming galaxies, composite galaxies, and Seyferts. This \"flattening\nsequence\" along the [NII]-based emission-line diagnostic diagram is consistent\nwith the hardening of galaxy ionizing field, due to nuclear activity.

We find important differences between the results for the two\nsets of cross sections.

These\nextremely high-velocity (EHV) components are similar to those found in the\nL1448 and IRAS 04166+2706 outflows, and probably arise from a molecular jet\ndriven by L1157-mm.

The extended model can be viewed as a layered\nqueueing network, where the first layer consists of the queues of products and\nthe second layer is the ordinary machine-repair model. Since the repair time of\none machine may affect the time the other machine is not able to process\nproducts, the downtimes of the machines are correlated. This correlation leads\nto dependence between the queues of products in the first layer. Analysis of\nthese queue length distributions is hard, since the exact dependence structure\nfor the downtimes, or the queue lengths, is not known. Therefore, we obtain an\napproximation for the complete marginal queue length distribution of any queue\nin the first layer, by viewing such a queue as a single server queue with\ncorrelated server downtimes. Under an explicit assumption on the form of the\ndowntime dependence, we obtain exact results for the queue length distribution\nfor that single server queue. We use these exact results to approximate the\nmachine-repair model. We do so by computing the downtime correlation for the\nlatter model and by subsequently using this information to fine-tune the\nparameters we introduced to the single server queue. As a result, we\nimmediately obtain an approximation for the queue length distributions of\nproducts in the machine-repair model, which we show to be highly accurate by\nextensive numerical experiments.\n","Comment: We extended the original manuscript with an erratum at the end of the\n  document"]}]

We first analyze the well-posedness of the\nproblem establishing some key energy estimates. These allow us to derive\nrigorously an asymptotic formula of the boundary potential perturbation due to\nthe presence of the inhomogeneities, following an approach similar to the one\nintroduced by Capdeboscq and Vogelius in \\cite{capvoge} in the case of the\nlinear conductivity equation.

For moderate\ntracer-crowder attraction the motion is found to be fully ergodic, while at\nstronger attraction strength a transient disparity between ensemble and time\naveraged mean squared displacements occurs.
