We show that the rearranged curve is closer to the true\nquantile curve in finite samples than the original curve, establish a\nfunctional delta method for rearrangement-related operators, and derive\nfunctional limit theory for the entire rearranged curve and its functionals. We\nalso establish validity of the bootstrap for estimating the limit law of the\nthe entire rearranged curve and its functionals. Our limit results are generic\nin that they apply to every estimator of a monotone econometric function,\nprovided that the estimator satisfies a functional central limit theorem and\nthe function satisfies some smoothness conditions.

In simulations on studied empirical complex\nnetworks, it is shown that the ranking depends on the dynamical regime of the\ndisease spreading.

In systems where the\nallocation of resources to counter disease spreading to individual nodes is\nbased on their ranking, the dynamical regime of disease spreading is frequently\nnot known before the outbreak of the disease. Therefore, we introduce a\nquantity called epidemic centrality as an average over all relevant regimes of\ndisease spreading as a basis of the ranking.

Specifically, there is a sequence of random\nvariables whose probability density function will change at an unknown time.\nThe goal is to detect this change in a way such that a linear combination of\nthe average detection delay and the false alarm probability is minimized. Two\ntypes of sampling right constrains are discussed. The first one is a limited\nsampling right constraint, in which the observer can take at most $N$\nobservations from this random sequence. Under this setup, we show that the cost\nfunction can be written as a set of iterative functions, which can be solved by\nMarkov optimal stopping theory. The optimal stopping rule is shown to be a\nthreshold rule. An asymptotic upper bound of the average detection delay is\ndeveloped as the false alarm probability goes to zero. This upper bound\nindicates that the performance of the limited sampling right problem is close\nto that of the classic Bayesian quickest detection for several scenarios of\npractical interest. The second constraint discussed in this paper is a\nstochastic sampling right constraint, in which sampling rights are consumed by\ntaking observations and are replenished randomly. The observer cannot take\nobservations if there are no sampling rights left. We characterize the optimal\nsolution, which has a very complex structure. For practical applications, we\npropose a low complexity algorithm, in which the sampling rule is to take\nobservations as long as the observer has sampling rights left and the detection\nscheme is a threshold rule. We show that this low complexity scheme is first\norder asymptotically optimal as the false alarm probability goes to zero.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 5 figures"]}]

In this paper\nwe investigate the possible sizes of new physics signals in these searches in\nthe context of the $CP$-conserving two-Higgs doublet model of type II. Using\ncurrent constraints from flavour, electroweak precision, and Higgs signal\nstrength data, we determine the allowed sizes of the triple Higgs couplings and\nthe branching fractions of the heavy Higgs bosons into lighter Higgs bosons.\nIdentifying the observed Higgs resonance with the light $CP$-even 2HDM Higgs\nboson $h$, we find that the $hhh$ coupling cannot exceed its SM value, but can\nbe reduced by a factor of $0.56$ at the 2 $\\sigma$ level. The branching\nfractions of the heavy neutral Higgs bosons $H$ and $A$ into two-fermion or\ntwo-vector-boson final states can be reduced by factors of $0.4$ and $0.01$,\nrespectively, if decays into lighter Higgs boson are possible and if the mass\nof the decaying Higgs is below the $t\\bar t$ threshold. To facilitate future\nstudies of collider signatures in 2HDM scenarios with large triple Higgs\ncouplings or decay modes of the heavy Higgs bosons not covered by the SM Higgs\nsearches we provide a set of benchmark points which exhibit these features and\nagree with all current constraints. We also discuss the effect of the heavy\nHiggs bosons on the $gg\\to hh$ cross section at a 14 TeV LHC for some of these\nbenchmarks. For $m_H$ below the $hh$ threshold we see a reduction of the SM\n$gg\\to hh$ cross section due to destructive interference, but for $m_H$ above\nthe $hh$ threshold current constraints allow enhancement factors above 50.

Having formed overlapping coalitions and divided profits, some\nagents may feel dissatisfied with their share of the profits, and would like to\ndeviate from the given outcome. However, deviation in OCF games is a\ncomplicated matter: agents may decide to withdraw only some of their weight\nfrom some of the coalitions they belong to; that is, even after deviation, it\nis possible that agents will still be involved in tasks with non-deviators.\nThis means that the desirability of a deviation, and the stability of formed\ncoalitions, is to a great extent determined by the reaction of non-deviators.\nIn this work, we explore algorithmic aspects of OCF games, focusing on the core\nin OCF games. We study the problem of deciding if the core of an OCF game is\nnot empty, and whether a core payoff division can be found in polynomial time;\nmoreover, we identify conditions that ensure that the problem admits polynomial\ntime algorithms.

The traffic generated by our\nposition-publish protocol fits within the transport capacity of large mobile ad\nhoc networks (MANETs) with constant communication bandwidth allocated for\nrouting overhead, even as the network size increases. The routing protocol\nguarantees, with high probability, routes whose lengths are within a constant\n\"stretch\" factor of the shortest path from source to destination. The key idea\nunderlying the scalability of the publish protocol is for each potential\ndestination node to send location updates (with frequency decaying with\ndistance) to a subset of network nodes, structured as annular regions around it\n(the natural approach of updating circular regions in distance-dependent\nfashion does not scale). The routing protocol must therefore account for the\nfact that the source and/or relay nodes may not have estimates of the\ndestination's location (or may have stale estimates). Spatial and temporal\nscaling of protocol parameters are chosen so as to guarantee scalability, route\nreliability and route stretch, and these analytical design prescriptions are\nverified using simulations.\n","Comment: IEEE Transactions on Information Theory"]}]

This is equivalent (see [12]) with the\ncondition that for all random variables $Q_1, Q_2$ there exists a random\nvariable $\\Theta$ such that $$ {\\bf X} Q_1 + {\\bf X}' Q_2 \\stackrel{d}{=} {\\bf\nX} \\Theta, \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad (\\ast) $$ where ${\\bf X}, {\\bf X}',\nQ_1, Q_2, \\Theta$ are independent. In this paper we define weak generalized\nconvolution of measures defined by the formula $$ {\\mathcal L}(Q_1)\n\\otimes_{\\mu} {\\mathcal L}(Q_2) = {\\mathcal L}(\\Theta), $$ if the equation\n$(\\ast)$ holds for ${\\bf X}, Q_1, Q_2, \\Theta$ and $\\mu = {\\mathcal L}(X)$. We\nstudy here basic properties of this convolution and basic properties of\ndistributions which are infinitely divisible in the sense of this convolution.\nThe main result of this paper is the analog of the L\\'evy-Khintchine\nrepresentation theorem for $\\otimes_{\\mu}$-infinitely divisible distributions.\n"]}]

In a general system of n spins, the total\nnumber of elements in the state basis is >4^n. A system propagation step\nrequires an action by an operator on the state vector and thus requires >4^2n\nmultiplications. It is obvious that with current computers there is no way\nbeyond about ten spins, and the calculation complexity scales exponentially\nwith the spin system size.\n  We demonstrate that a polynomially scaling algorithm can be obtained if the\nstate space is reduced by neglecting unimportant or unpopulated spin states.\nThe class of such states is surprisingly wide. In particular, there are\nindications that very high multi-spin orders can be dropped completely, as can\nall the orders linking the spins that are remote on the interaction graph.\n  The computational cost of the propagation step for a ktuples-restricted\ndensely connected n-spin system with k<<n is O(n^2k).
