We attribute this surface structure to a shear strain\ngiving rise to a spatially varying rotation of the affected graphite layer\nrelative to the bulk substrate. We propose a simple method to understand these\nmoire patterns by looking at the fixed and rotated lattices in the Fourier\ntransformed k-space.

In short, a user searching for a target object\nnavigates through a database in the following manner: the user is asked to\nselect the object most similar to her target from a small list of objects. A\nnew object list is then presented to the user based on her earlier selection.\nThis process is repeated until the target is included in the list presented, at\nwhich point the search terminates. This problem is known to be strongly related\nto the small-world network design problem.\n  However, contrary to prior work, which focuses on cases where objects in the\ndatabase are equally popular, we consider here the case where the demand for\nobjects may be heterogeneous. We show that, under heterogeneous demand, the\nsmall-world network design problem is NP-hard. Given the above negative result,\nwe propose a novel mechanism for small-world design and provide an upper bound\non its performance under heterogeneous demand. The above mechanism has a\nnatural equivalent in the context of content search through comparisons, and we\nestablish both an upper bound and a lower bound for the performance of this\nmechanism. These bounds are intuitively appealing, as they depend on the\nentropy of the demand as well as its doubling constant, a quantity capturing\nthe topology of the set of target objects. They also illustrate interesting\nconnections between comparison-based search to classic results from information\ntheory.

It is unclear how this recent population growth,\ncombined with the effects of negative natural selection, has affected patterns\nof deleterious variation, as well as the number, frequencies, and effect sizes\nof mutations that contribute risk to complex traits. Here I use simulations\nunder population genetic models where a proportion of the heritability of the\ntrait is accounted for by mutations in a subset of the exome. I show that\nrecent population growth increases the proportion of nonsynonymous variants\nsegregating in the population, but does not affect the genetic load relative to\nthat in a population that did not expand. Under a model where a mutation's\neffect on a trait is correlated with its effect on fitness, rare variants\nexplain a greater portion of the additive genetic variance of the trait in a\npopulation that has recently expanded than in a population that did not\nrecently expand. Further, when using a single-marker test, for a given\nfalse-positive rate and sample size, recent population growth decreases the\nexpected number of significant association with the trait relative to the\nnumber detected in a population that did not expand. However, in a model where\nthere is no correlation between a mutation's effect on fitness and the effect\non the trait, common variants account for much of the additive genetic\nvariance, regardless of demography. Moreover, here demography does not affect\nthe number of significant association detected. These finding suggest recent\npopulation history may be an important factor influencing the power of\nassociation tests in accounting for the missing heritability of certain complex\ntraits.\n"]}]

Most of the dynamo models suggest\nthat the toroidal magnetic field that emerges on the surface and forms sunspots\nis generated near the bottom of the convection zone, in the tachocline.\nHowever, there is a number of theoretical and observational problems with\njustifying the deep-seated dynamo models. This leads to the idea that the\nsubsurface angular velocity shear may play an important role in the solar\ndynamo. Using helioseismology measurements of the internal rotation and\nmeridional circulation, we investigate a mean-field MHD model of dynamo\ndistributed in the bulk of the convection zone but shaped in a near-surface\nlayer. We show that if the boundary conditions at the top of the dynamo region\nallow the large-scale toroidal magnetic fields to penetrate into the surface,\nthen the dynamo wave propagates along the isosurface of angular velocity in the\nsubsurface shear layer, forming the butterfly diagram in agreement with the\nParker-Yoshimura rule and solar-cycle observations. Unlike the flux-transport\ndynamo models, this model does not depend on the transport of magnetic field by\nmeridional circulation at the bottom of the convection zone, and works well\nwhen the meridional circulation forms two cells in radius, as recently\nindicated by deep-focus time-distance helioseismology analysis of the SDO/HMI\nand SOHO/MDI data. We compare the new dynamo model with various characteristics\nif the solar magnetic cycles, including the cycle asymmetry (Waldmeier's\nrelations) and magnetic `butterfly' diagrams.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 10 figures"]}]

More than 26% of Italian IAU members are women: this is the\nlargest fraction among the world leading countries in astronomy. Most of this\nhigh fraction is due to their presence in INAF, where women make up 32% of the\nresearch staff (289 out of 908) and 40% of the technical/administrative staff\n(173 out of 433); the percentage is slightly lower among permanent research\nstaff (180 out of 599, about 30%). The presence of women is lower in the\nUniversities (27 out of 161, about 17%, among staff). In spite of these\n(mildly) positive facts, we notice that similarly to other countries (e.g. USA\nand Germany) career prospects for Italian astronomers are clearly worse for\nwomen than for men. Within INAF, the fraction of women is about 35-40% among\nnon-permanent position, 36% for Investigators, 17% for Associato/Primo\nRicercatore, and only 13% among Ordinario/Dirigente di Ricerca. The situation\nis even worse at University (only 6% of Professore Ordinario are women). We\nfound that similar trends are also present if researchers are ordered according\nto citation rather than position: for instance, women make up only 15% among\nthe 100 most cited astronomers working in Italy, a percentage which is however\ntwice that over all Europe. A similar fraction is found among first authors of\nmost influential papers, which cannot be explained as a residual of a lower\nfemale presence in the past.

We searched for effects of\nthe frequency-related delay of radiation in broadband Jovian radio storms\nconsisting of periodic S-bursts (S-burst trains) at 16 to 30 MHz.

For instance, rather than handling\ndegrees of similarity in an ad hoc manner, we consistently treat them as truth\nvalues, the same way as true (match) and false (mismatch) are treated in\nclassical theories. In addition, several notions intuitively embraced in the\npresence of grades, such as a degree of validity of a particular dependence or\na degree of entailment, naturally emerge and receive a conceptually clean\ntreatment in the presented approach. In the paper, we discuss motivations,\nprovide basic notions of syntax and semantics, and develop basic results which\ninclude entailment of dependencies, associated closure structures, a logic of\ndependencies with two versions of completeness theorem, results and algorithms\nregarding complete non-redundant sets of dependencies, relationship to and a\npossible reductionist interface to classical dependencies, and relationship to\nfunctional dependencies over domains with similarity.\n"]}]

The perceived processing time of a request is thus composed of\nthe time needed to route the request to the server and the true processing\ntime. Once a request reaches a target server, the processing time depends on\nthe total load of that server; this dependency is described by a load function.\nWe consider a broad class of load functions; we just require that they are\nconvex and two times differentiable. In particular our model can be applied to\nheterogeneous systems in which every server has a different load function. This\napproach allows us not only to generalize results for queuing theory and for\nbatches of requests, but also to use empirically-derived load functions,\nmeasured in a system under stress-testing. The optimal assignment of requests\nto servers is communication-balanced, i.e. for any pair of non\nperfectly-balanced servers, the reduction of processing time resulting from\nmoving a single request from the overloaded to underloaded server is smaller\nthan the additional communication latency. We present a centralized and a\ndecentralized algorithm for optimal load balancing. We prove bounds on the\nalgorithms' convergence.

Our results are in\nthe form of RAIRS and temperature-programmed desorption spectra of O2 and O3\nproduced via two pathways: O + O and O2 + O, investigated in a submonolayer\nregime and in the range of temperature between 6.5 and 30 K.
