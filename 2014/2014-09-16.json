The data set contains 412 data points in total to which\nwe add additional data from the literature. Furthermore, we present\nlow-resolution high signal-to-noise spectra of the afterglow.

Depending on the ones kept, the mission could provide\ninformation on the gravity field, the atmosphere and the magnetosphere of the\ntwo bodies as well as on the surface geology of Triton and on the nature of the\nplanetary rings around Neptune.\n","Comment: 61st International Astronautical Congress (Prague, Czech Republic -\n  September 2010), 7 pages"]}]

The learning algorithm is given access to independent samples\ndrawn from an unknown $k$-modal distribution $p$, and it must output a\nhypothesis distribution $\\widehat{p}$ such that with high probability the total\nvariation distance between $p$ and $\\widehat{p}$ is at most $\\epsilon.$ Our\nmain goal is to obtain \\emph{computationally efficient} algorithms for this\nproblem that use (close to) an information-theoretically optimal number of\nsamples.\n  We give an efficient algorithm for this problem that runs in time\n$\\mathrm{poly}(k,\\log(n),1/\\epsilon)$. For $k \\leq \\tilde{O}(\\log n)$, the\nnumber of samples used by our algorithm is very close (within an\n$\\tilde{O}(\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ factor) to being information-theoretically\noptimal.

We use Einstein gravity and a minimally\ncoupled scalar field with a quadratic potential. We restrict our attention to\nsmall mass and small field cases. In the Euclidean approach, we introduce the\nground state wave function which is approximated by instantons. We used a\nnumerical technique to find instantons that satisfy classicality. In the\nstochastic approach, we introduce the probability distribution of Hubble\npatches that can be approximated by locally homogeneous universes down to a\nsmoothing scale. We assume that the ground state wave function should\ncorrespond to the stationary state of the probability distribution of the\nstochastic universe. By comparing the dispersion of both approaches, we\nconclude three main results.

(2) The size of the universe of the\nEuclidean approach corresponds to the smoothing scale of the stochastic side;\nthe universe is homogeneous up to the Euclidean instanton. (3) In addition, as\nthe mass increases up to a critical value, both approaches break at the same\ntime. Hence, generation of classical inhomogeneity in the stochastic approach\nand the instability of classicality in the Euclidean approach are related.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 6 figures"]}]

The approach is compared with Kelly and Atwood's\nminimally informative Dirichlet prior for the alpha-factor model, which\nincorporated precise mean values for the alpha-factors, but which was otherwise\nquite diffuse.\n  Next, we explore the use of a set of Gamma priors to model epistemic\nuncertainty in the marginal failure rate, expressed via a lower and upper\nexpectation for this rate, again along with a learning parameter. As zero\ncounts are generally less of an issue here, we find that the choice of this\nlearning parameter is less crucial.\n  Finally, we demonstrate how both epistemic uncertainty models can be combined\nto arrive at lower and upper expectations for all common-cause failure rates.\nThereby, we effectively provide a full sensitivity analysis of common-cause\nfailure rates, properly reflecting epistemic uncertainty of the analyst on all\nlevels of the common-cause failure model.\n","Comment: 16 pages"]}]

The latter comprises\nnormal star-forming and passive galaxies with similar stellar masses and impact\nparameters as the starbursts. We used optical spectra from the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey(SDSS) to estimate the properties of the starbursts, inferring\naverage ages of 200 Myrs and burst fractions involving ~10% of their stellar\nmass. The COS data reveal highly ionized gas traced by CIV in 80%(4/5) of the\nstarburst and in 17%(2/12) of the control sample. The two control galaxies with\nCIV absorbers differed from the four starbursts in showing multiple\nlow-ionization transitions and strong saturated Lyman-alpha lines. They\ntherefore appear to be physically different systems. We show that the CIV\nabsorbers in the starburst CGM represent a significant baryon repository. The\nhigh detection rate of this highly ionized material in the starbursts suggests\nthat starburst-driven winds can affect the CGM out to radii as large as 200\nkpc. This is plausible given the inferred properties of the starbursts and the\nknown properties of starburst-driven winds. This would represent the first\ndirect observational evidence of local starbursts impacting the bulk of their\ngaseous halos, and as such provides new evidence of the importance of this kind\nof feedback in the evolution of galaxies.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

This alternative separation was initially proposed by\nToulouse et al. [Theor. Chem. Acc. 114, 305 (2005)] and relies on a long-range\ninteracting wavefunction instead of the non-interacting Kohn-Sham one. When\nsecond-order corrections to the density are neglected, the energy expression\nreduces to a range-separated double-hybrid (RSDH) type of functional, RSDHf,\nwhere \"f\" stands for \"full-range integrals\" as the regular full-range\ninteraction appears explicitly in the energy expression when expanded in\nperturbation theory. In contrast to usual RSDH functionals, RSDHf describes the\ncoupling between long- and short-range correlations as an orbital-dependent\ncontribution. Calculations on the first four noble-gas dimers show that this\ncoupling has a significant effect on the potential energy curves in the\nequilibrium region, improving the accuracy of binding energies and equilibrium\nbond distances when second-order perturbation theory is appropriate.\n","Comment: 5 figures"]}]

We also show\nthat both the locations and the heights of these Diracs converge toward those\nof the input measure when the noise drops to zero. The exact speed of\nconvergence is governed by a specific dual certificate, which can be computed\nby solving a linear system. We draw connections between the support of the\nrecovered measure on a continuous domain and on a discretized grid. We show\nthat when the signal-to-noise level is large enough, the solution of the\ndiscretized problem is supported on pairs of Diracs which are neighbors of the\nDiracs of the input measure.

To date, most algorithms that aim to find\ncommunity structures only focus either on unipartite or bipartite networks. A\nunipartite network consists of one set of nodes and a bipartite network\nconsists of two nonoverlapping sets of nodes with only links joining the nodes\nin different sets. However, a third type of network exists, defined here as the\nmixture network. Just like a bipartite network, a mixture network also consists\nof two sets of nodes, but some nodes may simultaneously belong to two sets,\nwhich breaks the nonoverlapping restriction of a bipartite network. The mixture\nnetwork can be considered as a general case, with unipartite and bipartite\nnetworks viewed as its limiting cases. A mixture network can represent not only\nall the unipartite and bipartite networks, but also a wide range of real-world\nnetworks that cannot be properly represented as either unipartite or bipartite\nnetworks in fields such as biology and social science. Based on this\nobservation, we first propose a probabilistic model that can find modules in\nunipartite, bipartite, and mixture networks in a unified framework based on the\nlink community model for a unipartite undirected network [B Ball et al (2011\nPhys. Rev. E 84 036103)]. We test our algorithm on synthetic networks (both\noverlapping and nonoverlapping communities) and apply it to two real-world\nnetworks: a southern women bipartite network and a human transcriptional\nregulatory mixture network. The results suggest that our model performs well\nfor all three types of networks, is competitive with other algorithms for\nunipartite or bipartite networks, and is applicable to real-world networks.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 8 figures.\n  (http://iopscience.iop.org/1367-2630/16/9/093001)"]}]

The quotient spacetime includes regions\nbeyond the singularity, \"whiskers\", containing timelike and lightlike closed\ncurves, which at first sight seem unphysical. The spacetime includes the usual\nAdS-asymptotic boundaries outside the horizons as well as boundary components\ninside the whiskers. We show that local boundary correlators with some\nendpoints in the whisker regions: (i) are a protected class of amplitudes,\ndominated by effective field theory even when the associated Witten diagrams\nappear to traverse the singularity, (ii) describe well-defined\ndiffeomorphism-invariant quantum gravity amplitudes in BTZ, (iii) sharply probe\nsome of the physics inside the horizon but outside the singularity, and (iv)\nare equivalent to correlators of specific non-local CFT operators in the\nstandard thermofield entangled state of two CFTs. In this sense, the whisker\nregions can be considered as purely auxiliary spacetimes in which these useful\nnon-local CFT correlators can be rendered as local boundary correlators, and\ntheir diagnostic value more readily understood. Our results follow by first\nperforming a novel reanalysis of the Rindler view of standard AdS/CFT duality\non the Poincare patch of AdS, followed by exploiting the simple quotient\nstructure of BTZ which turns the Rindler horizon into the BTZ black hole\nhorizon.

Thus, in addition to the non-blocking\ncondition, the challenge of the design of AWG-based multistage switching\nnetworks is to scale down the wavelength granularity and to reduce the\nconversion range of tunable wavelength converters (TWCs). We devise a logic\nscheme to partition the WDM switch network into wavelength autonomous cells,\nand show that the wavelength scalability problem can be solved by recursively\nreusing similar, but smaller, set of wavelengths in different cells.\nFurthermore, we prove that the rearrangeably non-blocking (RNB) condition and\nroute assignments in these AWG-based three-stage networks are consistent with\nthat of classical Clos networks. Thus, the optimal AWG-based non-blocking Clos\nnetworks also can achieve 100% utilization when all input and output wavelength\nchannels are busy.\n","Comment: Add some contents to the manuscript in page 2, 12 and 13"]}]

The problem of single\nparticle reconstruction (SPR) from cryo-EM is to use the resulting set of noisy\n2D projection images taken at unknown directions to reconstruct the 3D\nstructure of the molecule. In some situations, the molecule under examination\nexhibits structural variability, which poses a fundamental challenge in SPR.\nThe heterogeneity problem is the task of mapping the space of conformational\nstates of a molecule. It has been previously suggested that the leading\neigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the 3D molecules can be used to solve\nthe heterogeneity problem. Estimating the covariance matrix is challenging,\nsince only projections of the molecules are observed, but not the molecules\nthemselves. In this paper, we formulate a general problem of covariance\nestimation from noisy projections of samples. This problem has intimate\nconnections with matrix completion problems and high-dimensional principal\ncomponent analysis. We propose an estimator and prove its consistency. When\nthere are finitely many heterogeneity classes, the spectrum of the estimated\ncovariance matrix reveals the number of classes. The estimator can be found as\nthe solution to a certain linear system. In the cryo-EM case, the linear\noperator to be inverted, which we term the projection covariance transform, is\nan important object in covariance estimation for tomographic problems involving\nstructural variation. Inverting it involves applying a filter akin to the ramp\nfilter in tomography. We design a basis in which this linear operator is sparse\nand thus can be tractably inverted despite its large size.

Our analysis\nshows that the dust-to-gas gradient in M31 is steeper than the metallicity\ngradient, suggesting interstellar dust growth is (or has been) important in\nM31. We argue that M31 helps build a case for cosmic dust in galaxies being the\nresult of substantial interstellar grain growth, while the net dust production\nfrom stars may be limited. We note, however, that the efficiency of dust\nproduction in stars, e.g., in supernovae (SNe) ejecta and/or stellar\natmospheres, and grain destruction in the interstellar medium (ISM) may be\ndegenerate in our simple model.

We demonstrate that the\nfundamental theories of multi-commodity flows and matchings provide key\ninsights that lead to the strong relaxation. Our algorithmic proof of\nintegrality gap is obtained by finally accessing the rich toolbox of LP-based\nmethodologies: we present a constant factor approximation algorithm based on\nLP-rounding.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 6 figures; minor revisions"]}]

We then parametrically\nspecify impulsive heating of individual strands (flux tubes) comprising coronal\nloops. Next, we simulated the response of the entire active region (with LOS\nprojection effects) to the heating function (volumetric heating rate) scaled\nwith magnetic field and spatial scale parameters and find the best match\nbetween synthetic and actual (reconstructed) DEMs obtained by SDO.\n","Comment: To be appeared in 18th Cambridge Workshop on Cool Stars, Stellar\n  Systems, and the Sun Proceedings of Lowell Observatory (9-13 June 2014),\n  Edited by G. van Belle & H.

Such\na channel is $p$-bounded if it can erase at most a $p$ fraction of the input\nbits over the whole transmission duration.

Using this condition, Maurer and Wolf showed a remarkable \"all\nor nothing\" result: if the simulatability condition does not hold, the key\ncapacity over the non-authenticated public channel will be the same as that of\nthe case with a passive Eve, while the key capacity over the non-authenticated\nchannel will be zero if the simulatability condition holds.

However it suffers from low conversion efficiencies as the control of\nthe HHG spectral and temporal characteristics requires manipulating electron\ntrajectories on attosecond time scale. The phase matching mechanism has been\nemployed to selectively enhance specific quantum paths leading to HHG. A few\nimportant fundamental questions remain open, among those how much of the\nenhancement can be achieved by the single-emitter and what is the role of\ncorrelations (or the electronic structure) in the selectivity and control of\nHHG generation. Here we address those questions by examining computationally\nthe possibility of optimizing the HHG spectrum of isolated Hydrogen and Helium\natoms by shaping the slowly varying envelope of a 800 nm, 200-cycles long laser\npulse. The spectra are computed with a fully quantum mechanical description, by\nexplicitly computing the time-dependent dipole moment of the systems using a\nfirst-principles time-dependent density-functional approach (exact for the case\nof H). The sought optimization corresponds to the selective enhancement of\nsingle harmonics, which we find to be significant. This selectivity is entirely\ndue to the single atom response, and not due to any propagation or\nphase-matching effect. In fact, this single-emitter enhancement adds to the\nphase-matching techniques to achieving even larger HHG enhancement factors.\nMoreover, we see that the electronic correlation plays a role in the\ndetermining the degree of optimization that can be obtained.\n"]}]

Competition between the\ndifferent elastic energy components, together with a surface energy, determines\nthe equilibrium radius and twist-angle at the fibril surface. A simplified\nmodel with a twist-angle that is linear with radius is a reasonable\napproximation in some parameter regimes, and explains a power-law dependence of\nradius and twist-angle at the surface as parameters are varied. Fibril radius\nand twist-angle at the surface corresponding to an equilibrium free-energy\nminimum are consistent with existing experimental measurements of collagen\nfibrils.

The symmetry allows to predict new hadronic molecules, in\nparticular we find an isoscalar $1^{++}$ $B\\bar B^*$ bound state with a mass\nabout 10580 MeV and the isovector charmonium partners of the $Z_b(10610)$ and\nthe $Z_b(10650)$ states. Next, we study the $X(3872) \\to D^0 \\bar D^0\\pi^0$\nthree body decay. This decay mode is more sensitive to the long-distance\nstructure of the X(3872) resonance than its $J/\\psi\\pi\\pi$ and $J/\\psi3\\pi$\ndecays, which are mainly controlled by the short distance part of the X(3872)\nmolecular wave function.

We then give a\nprotocol for compressing a single copy of a protocol down to its quantum\ninformation cost, up to terms depending on the number of rounds and the allowed\nincrease in error. Two important tools to derive this protocol are a smooth\nconditional min-entropy bound for a one-shot quantum state redistribution\nprotocol, and the quantum substate theorem of Jain, Radhakrishnan and Sen\n(FOCS'02) to transform this bound into a von Neumann conditional entropy bound.\nThis result further establishes the newly introduced notions of quantum\ninformation cost and complexity as the correct quantum generalisations of the\nclassical ones in the standard communication complexity setting.
