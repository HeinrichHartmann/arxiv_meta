For bounded-size rules, all components of size greater than some\nfixed $K\\geq 1$ are accorded the same treatment.

We identify thermal\nemission from the shocked ambient gas along the outer boundary of the remnant.\nComparison of measured radial variations of spectroscopic parameters of the\nshocked ambient gas to the self-similar solutions of Chevalier show that Cas A\nis expanding into a circumstellar wind rather than into a uniform medium. We\nestimate a wind density nH ~ 0.9 $\\pm$ 0.3 cm$^{-3}$ at the current outer\nradius of the remnant (~3 pc), which we interpret as a dense slow wind from a\nred supergiant (RSG) star. Our results suggest that the progenitor star of Cas\nA had an initial mass around 16 Msun, and its mass before the explosion was\nabout 5 Msun, with uncertainties of several tens of percent. Furthermore, the\nresults suggest that, among the mass lost from the progenitor star (~11 Msun),\na significant amount (more than 6 Msun) could have been via its RSG wind.\n","Comment: ApJ Accepted. 11 pages (with emulateapj style)"]}]

This formulation is similar to the Berry phase description of\nelectric polarization and quantized charge transport in topological insulators.\nThe Bloch waves are quasiperiodic superpositions of localized Dirac zero modes.\nThey define a Berry connection around the Brillouin zone of the zero mode band\nwhich describes the local polarization of vacuum pairs, analogous to its role\nin topological insulator theory. In 4D Yang-Mills theory, the $\\theta$ domain\nwalls are 2+1-dimensional Chern-Simons membranes. The interpretation of the\n$\\theta$ parameter as a Berry phase describing the local polarization of\nbrane-antibrane pairs follows from the descent equations of 4D Yang-Mills\ntheory.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 2 figures"]}]

The category of Mackey functors is a closed symmetric monoidal\ncategory, so using the formalism of J.P. May for these categories, S. Bouc has\ndefined the so-called Burnside trace. Using this Burnside trace we produce\ntrace maps for Mackey algebras which generalize the usual trace map the group\nalgebras. These trace maps factorise through Burnside algebras. We prove that\nthe Mackey algebra $\\mu_{R}(G)$ is a symmetric algebra if and only if the\nfamily of Burnside algebras $(RB(H))_{H\\leqslant G}$ is a family of symmetric\nalgebras with a compatibility condition. As a corollary, we recover the well\nknown fact that over a field of characteristic zero, the Mackey algebra is\nalways symmetric. Over the ring of integers the Mackey algebra of $G$ is\nsymmetric if and only if the order of $G$ is square free.

The fading channels encountered by the system\nare usually time variant for a mobile receiver. Besides, the frequency response\nof the channel is frequency selective for urban environments where the delay\nspread is quite large compared to the symbol duration. Estimating the channel\nis essential for equalizing the received data and removing the Inter-Symbol\nInterference (ISI) resulting from the dispersive channel. Hence, conventional\ntransceivers insert pilot symbols of known values and detect the changes in it\nin order to deduce the channel response. Because these pilots carry no\ninformation, the throughput of the system is reduced. A Novel modulation scheme\nis presented in this work.

Thermal\nfluctuations in fluids are known to lead to a Brownian loss of the swimming\ndirection. As most cells or synthetic swimmers are immersed in external flows,\nwe consider theoretically in this paper the stochastic dynamics of a model\nactive particle (a self-propelled sphere) in a steady general linear flow. The\nstochasticity arises both from translational diffusion in physical space, and\nfrom a combination of rotary diffusion and run-and-tumble dynamics in\norientation space. We begin by deriving a general formulation for all\ncomponents of the long-time mean square displacement tensor for a swimmer with\na time-dependent swimming velocity and whose orientation decorrelates due to\nrotary diffusion alone. This general framework is applied to obtain the\nconvectively enhanced mean-squared displacements of a steadily-swimming\nparticle in three canonical linear flows (extension, simple shear, and\nsolid-body rotation). We then show how to extend our results to the case where\nthe swimmer orientation also decorrelates on account of run-and-tumble\ndynamics. Self-propulsion in general leads to the same long-time temporal\nscalings as for passive particles in linear flows but with increased\ncoefficients. In the particular case of solid-body rotation, the effective\nlong-time diffusion is the same as that in a quiescent fluid, and we clarify\nthe lack of flow-dependence by briefly examining the dynamics in elliptic\nlinear flows. By comparing the new active terms with those obtained for passive\nparticles we see that swimming can lead to an enhancement of the mean-square\ndisplacements by orders of magnitude, and could be relevant for biological\norganisms or synthetic swimming devices in fluctuating environmental or\nbiological flows.\n"]}]

For instance, does being recipient of an altruistic act increase\nyour probability of being cooperative with others? Plato's quote, 'Good actions\ngive strength to ourselves and inspire good actions in others', suggests that\nis possible. We have conducted an experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk to test\nthis mechanism using economic games.

The main modulation periodicity was found to\nbe 9.7374(54) d. This is one of the shortest known Blazhko periods among RRc\nstars. The second modulation period 21.5(2) d causes changes of the Blazhko\neffect itself. Some indices show that TV Boo could be affected by long-term\nchanges in the order of years. Basic physical parameters were estimated via a\nMUO V light curve solution using Fourier parameters. TV Boo seems to be a\nlow-metalicity star with [Fe/H]=-1.89.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables, published in MNRAS"]}]

Our calculations reveal CdS/ZnSe\ncoupled quantum dots to be of type-II in nature where the anion-p states play\nan important role in deciding the band offset for the highest occupied\nmolecular orbitals (HOMO). We show that the offsets of HOMO as well as the\nlowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) can be tuned by changing the sizes\nof the components of the coupled quantum dot, thereby providing an additional\ncontrol parameter to tune the band gap and the optical properties. Our\ninvestigations also suggest that formation of alloy near the interface has very\nlittle influence on the band offsets, although it affects the spatial\nlocalization of the quantum states from the individual components. Comparing\nthe influence of strain on coupled quantum dots and core/shell nanowires, we\nfind strain practically has no role in the electronic structure of coupled\nquantum dots as the small effective area of the interface in a coupled quantum\ndot helps a large part of the structure remain free from any substantial\nstrain. We argue that in contrast to core-shell nanowires, quantum confinement\nis the key parameter that controls the electronic properties of coupled quantum\ndot and should therefore be an ideal candidate for the design of a quantum\ndevice.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 8 figures"]}]
