We compare the performance of the proposed\nmethod to the original stochastic Newton MCMC method and to an independence\nsampler. The comparison of the three methods is conducted on a synthetic ice\nsheet inverse problem. For this problem, the stochastic Newton MCMC method with\na MAP-based Hessian converges at least as rapidly as the original stochastic\nNewton MCMC method, but is far cheaper since it avoids recomputing the Hessian\nat each step. On the other hand, it is more expensive per sample than the\nindependence sampler; however, its convergence is significantly more rapid, and\nthus overall it is much cheaper.

Pt-Pt force constants in the alloy, however, are predicted to be\nsofter compared to Ni-Ni, due to a large bond distance of the former.

We quantify this\nsensitivity, and discuss conditions that must be satisfied if observable\npredictions are to be insensitive to the dynamics of reheating. We demonstrate\nthat upon completion of reheating, all observable quantities take values within\nfinite ranges, the limits of which are determined completely by the conditions\nduring inflation. Furthermore, fluctuations in both fields play an important\nrole in determining the full dependence of the observables on the dynamics of\nreheating.

We study equilibration and relaxation of the\nsupercooled SW Si, in the temperature range of 1060 K--1070 K at zero pressure.\nWe find that as the relaxation of the metastable supercooled liquid phase\ninitiates, a straight line region (SLR) is formed in cumulative potential\nenergy distributions.

The SLR is found to be tangential to the\ndistribution of the metastable liquid phase and thus influences the broadness\nof the distribution. As the bath temperature is reduced from 1070 K to 1060 K,\nthe effective temperature approaches the bath temperature which results in\nbroadening of the metastable phase distribution.

Using the Sun, we want to test a\nmagnetic activity index based on the analysis of the photo- metric response and\nthen apply it to a sample of M dwarfs observed by Kepler. We estimate a global\nstellar magnetic activity index by measuring the standard deviation of the\nwhole time series, Sph. Because stellar variability can be related to\nconvection, pulsations, or magnetism, we need to ensure that this index mostly\ntakes into account magnetic effects. We define another stellar magnetic\nactivity index as the average of the standard deviation of shorter subseries\nwhich lengths are determined by the rotation period of the star.
