In particular, we prove the\nconjecture when $G$ is of one of the following types: (1) ${}^2A_n^*$, i.e.\n$G=\\mathbf{SU}(h)$ is the special unitary group of some hermitian form $h$ over\na pair $(D, \\tau)$, where $D$ is a central division algebra of square-free\nindex over a quadratic extension $L$ of $K$ and $\\tau$ is an involution of the\nsecond kind on $D$ such that $L^{\\tau}=K$; (2) $B_n$, i.e.,\n$G=\\mathbf{Spin}(q)$ is the spinor group of quadratic form of odd dimension\nover $K$; (3) $D_n^*$, i.e., $G=\\mathbf{Spin}(h)$ is the spinor group of a\nhermitian form $h$ over a quaternion $K$-algebra $D$ with an orthogonal\ninvolution.

Three examples:\n  Mercury, Io, and Kepler-10 b"],"description":["  In Efroimsky & Makarov (2014), we derived from the first principles a formula\nfor the tidal heating rate in a tidally perturbed homogeneous sphere. We\ncompared it with the formulae used in the literature, and pointed out the\ndifferences. Using this result, we now present three case studies - Mercury,\nKepler-10b, and a triaxial Io. A very sharp frequency-dependence of k2/Q near\nspin-orbit resonances yields a similarly sharp dependence of k2/Q on the spin\nrate. This indicates that physical libration may play a major role in tidal\nheating of synchronously rotating bodies. The magnitude of libration in the\nspin rate being defined by the planet's triaxiality, the latter should be a\nfactor determining the dissipation rate. Other parameters equal, a\nsynchronously rotating body with a stronger triaxiality should generate more\nheat than a similar body of a more symmetrical shape. Further in the paper, we\ndiscuss scenarios where initially triaxial objects melt and lose their\ntriaxiality. Thereafter, dissipation in them becomes less intensive; so the\nbodies freeze. The tidal bulge becomes a new permanent figure, with a new\ntriaxiality lower than the original. In the paper, we also derive simplified,\napproximate expressions for dissipation rate in a rocky planet of the Maxwell\nrheology, with a not too small Maxwell time. The three expressions derived\npertain to the cases of a synchronous spin, a 3:2 resonance, and a nonresonant\nrotation; so they can be applied to most close-in super-Earth exoplanets\ndetected thus far. In such bodies, the rate of tidal heating outside of\nsynchronous rotation is weakly dependent on the eccentricity and obliquity,\nprovided both these parameters are small or moderate. According to our\ncalculation, Kepler-10b could hardly survive the great amount of tidal heating\nwithout being synchronised, circularised and also reshaped through a complete\nor partial melt-down.\n"]}]

These impulsive hydrodynamic loads to a ship's hull are of short\nduration relative to ship motions and buoyant wave loads and often result in\nextremely high pressures. The physics of breaking waves is a poorly understood,\ncomplex, multiphase phenomenon involving violent jet sprays, strong\nfree-surface turbulence, air entrainment and bubble generation, all of which\ninteract with the flow field and the adjacent structure. This paper will\ndescribe a set of experiments that were performed, at the Naval Surface Warfare\nCenter, Carderock Division (NSWCCD), in 2006, to measure the hydrodynamic loads\nof regular nonbreaking and focused breaking waves on a 0.305 m x 0.305 m (1.0\nft x 1.0 ft) square plate and discuss the results of this study. The paper will\nalso discuss Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code predictions of breaking\nwaves and wave impact loads. The CFD code utilized in this study is Numerical\nFlow Analysis (NFA).\n","Comment: 12 pages, 27th Symposium on Naval Hydrodynamics, Seoul, Korea, 5-10\n  October 2008"]}]

In\nthe absence of dispersion, this channel behaves as a collection of parallel\nper-sample channels. The conditional probability density function of the\nnonlinear per-sample channels is derived using both a sum-product and a\nFokker-Planck differential equation approach. It is shown that, for a fixed\nnoise power, the per-sample capacity grows unboundedly with input signal. The\nchannel can be partitioned into amplitude and phase subchannels, and it is\nshown that the contribution to the total capacity of the phase channel declines\nfor large input powers. It is found that a two-dimensional distribution with a\nhalf-Gaussian profile on the amplitude and uniform phase provides a lower bound\nfor the zero-dispersion optical fiber channel, which is simple and\nasymptotically capacity-achieving at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). A\nlower bound on the capacity is also derived in the medium-SNR region. The exact\ncapacity subject to peak and average power constraints is numerically\nquantified using dense multiple ring modulation formats. The differential model\nunderlying the zero-dispersion channel is reduced to an algebraic model, which\nis more tractable for digital communication studies, and in particular it\nprovides a relation between the zero-dispersion optical channel and a $2 \\times\n2$ multiple-input multiple-output Rician fading channel. It appears that the\nstructure of the capacity-achieving input distribution resembles that of the\nRician fading channel, i.e., it is discrete in amplitude with a finite number\nof mass points, while continuous and uniform in phase.\n","Comment: Published in 2011"]}]

In the present work, transport properties of\nniobium thin films, with beta-Ga2O3 nanoparticles embedded within them, are\npresented. Nanoparticles of beta-Ga2O3 embedded in a Nb matrix were prepared at\nroom temperature by radio frequency co-sputtering technique on Si (100) and\nglass substrates held at room temperature. The thin films deposited on Si\nsubstrates were subjected to Ar annealing at a temperature range of 600-650 C\nfor 1 hour. Films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Micro-Raman\nand elemental identification was performed with an Energy Dispersive X-ray\nSpectroscopy (EDS). Transport measurements were performed down to liquid helium\ntemperatures by four-probe contact technique, showed characteristics analogous\nto those observed in the context of a Kondo system. A comparison of the\nexperimental data with the theoretical formalism of Kondo and Hamann is\npresented. It is suggested that this behavior arises from the existence of\nmagnetic moments associated with the oxygen vacancy defects in the\nnanoparticles of the nonmagnetic oxide Ga2O3.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Modern radio astronomical arrays have (or will have) more than one\norder of magnitude more receivers than classical synthesis arrays, such as the\nVLA and the WSRT. This makes gain calibration a computationally demanding task.\nSeveral alternating direction implicit (ADI) approaches have therefore been\nproposed that reduce numerical complexity for this task from $\\mathcal{O}(P^3)$\nto $\\mathcal{O}(P^2)$, where $P$ is the number of receive paths to be\ncalibrated.\n  Aims.

We computed the 10\nmost-cited journals and the 1000 most-cited articles each year for all 261\nsubject categories in Scholar Metrics. We marked the 10 most-cited journals in\na category as the elite journals for the category and the rest as non-elite.\n  There are two conclusions from our study. First, the fraction of top-cited\narticles published in non-elite journals increased steadily over 1995-2013.\nWhile the elite journals still publish a substantial fraction of high-impact\narticles, many more authors of well-regarded papers in diverse research fields\nare choosing other venues.\n  The number of top-1000 papers published in non-elite journals for the\nrepresentative subject category went from 149 in 1995 to 245 in 2013, a growth\nof 64%. Looking at broad research areas, 4 out of 9 areas saw at least\none-third of the top-cited articles published in non-elite journals in 2013.\nFor 6 out of 9 areas, the fraction of top-cited papers published in non-elite\njournals for the representative subject category grew by 45% or more.\n  Second, now that finding and reading relevant articles in non-elite journals\nis about as easy as finding and reading articles in elite journals, researchers\nare increasingly building on and citing work published everywhere. Considering\ncitations to all articles, the percentage of citations to articles in non-elite\njournals went from 27% in 1995 to 47% in 2013. Six out of nine broad areas had\nat least 50% of citations going to articles published in non-elite journals in\n2013.\n"]}]
