In particular, we prove the\nconjecture when $G$ is of one of the following types: (1) ${}^2A_n^*$, i.e.\n$G=\\mathbf{SU}(h)$ is the special unitary group of some hermitian form $h$ over\na pair $(D, \\tau)$, where $D$ is a central division algebra of square-free\nindex over a quadratic extension $L$ of $K$ and $\\tau$ is an involution of the\nsecond kind on $D$ such that $L^{\\tau}=K$; (2) $B_n$, i.e.,\n$G=\\mathbf{Spin}(q)$ is the spinor group of quadratic form of odd dimension\nover $K$; (3) $D_n^*$, i.e., $G=\\mathbf{Spin}(h)$ is the spinor group of a\nhermitian form $h$ over a quaternion $K$-algebra $D$ with an orthogonal\ninvolution.

Three examples:\n  Mercury, Io, and Kepler-10 b"],"description":["  In Efroimsky & Makarov (2014), we derived from the first principles a formula\nfor the tidal heating rate in a tidally perturbed homogeneous sphere. We\ncompared it with the formulae used in the literature, and pointed out the\ndifferences. Using this result, we now present three case studies - Mercury,\nKepler-10b, and a triaxial Io. A very sharp frequency-dependence of k2/Q near\nspin-orbit resonances yields a similarly sharp dependence of k2/Q on the spin\nrate. This indicates that physical libration may play a major role in tidal\nheating of synchronously rotating bodies. The magnitude of libration in the\nspin rate being defined by the planet's triaxiality, the latter should be a\nfactor determining the dissipation rate. Other parameters equal, a\nsynchronously rotating body with a stronger triaxiality should generate more\nheat than a similar body of a more symmetrical shape. Further in the paper, we\ndiscuss scenarios where initially triaxial objects melt and lose their\ntriaxiality. Thereafter, dissipation in them becomes less intensive; so the\nbodies freeze. The tidal bulge becomes a new permanent figure, with a new\ntriaxiality lower than the original. In the paper, we also derive simplified,\napproximate expressions for dissipation rate in a rocky planet of the Maxwell\nrheology, with a not too small Maxwell time. The three expressions derived\npertain to the cases of a synchronous spin, a 3:2 resonance, and a nonresonant\nrotation; so they can be applied to most close-in super-Earth exoplanets\ndetected thus far. In such bodies, the rate of tidal heating outside of\nsynchronous rotation is weakly dependent on the eccentricity and obliquity,\nprovided both these parameters are small or moderate. According to our\ncalculation, Kepler-10b could hardly survive the great amount of tidal heating\nwithout being synchronised, circularised and also reshaped through a complete\nor partial melt-down.\n"]}]

In\nthe absence of dispersion, this channel behaves as a collection of parallel\nper-sample channels. The conditional probability density function of the\nnonlinear per-sample channels is derived using both a sum-product and a\nFokker-Planck differential equation approach. It is shown that, for a fixed\nnoise power, the per-sample capacity grows unboundedly with input signal. The\nchannel can be partitioned into amplitude and phase subchannels, and it is\nshown that the contribution to the total capacity of the phase channel declines\nfor large input powers. It is found that a two-dimensional distribution with a\nhalf-Gaussian profile on the amplitude and uniform phase provides a lower bound\nfor the zero-dispersion optical fiber channel, which is simple and\nasymptotically capacity-achieving at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). A\nlower bound on the capacity is also derived in the medium-SNR region. The exact\ncapacity subject to peak and average power constraints is numerically\nquantified using dense multiple ring modulation formats. The differential model\nunderlying the zero-dispersion channel is reduced to an algebraic model, which\nis more tractable for digital communication studies, and in particular it\nprovides a relation between the zero-dispersion optical channel and a $2 \\times\n2$ multiple-input multiple-output Rician fading channel. It appears that the\nstructure of the capacity-achieving input distribution resembles that of the\nRician fading channel, i.e., it is discrete in amplitude with a finite number\nof mass points, while continuous and uniform in phase.\n","Comment: Published in 2011"]}]

Modern radio astronomical arrays have (or will have) more than one\norder of magnitude more receivers than classical synthesis arrays, such as the\nVLA and the WSRT. This makes gain calibration a computationally demanding task.\nSeveral alternating direction implicit (ADI) approaches have therefore been\nproposed that reduce numerical complexity for this task from $\\mathcal{O}(P^3)$\nto $\\mathcal{O}(P^2)$, where $P$ is the number of receive paths to be\ncalibrated.\n  Aims. We present an ADI method, show that it converges to the optimal\nsolution, and assess its numerical, computational and statistical performance.\nWe also discuss its suitability for application in self-calibration and report\non its successful application in LOFAR standard pipelines.\n  Methods. Convergence is proved by rigorous mathematical analysis using a\ncontraction mapping. Its numerical, algorithmic, and statistical performance,\nas well as its suitability for application in self-calibration, are assessed\nusing simulations.\n  Results. Our simulations confirm the $\\mathcal{O}(P^2)$ complexity and\nexcellent numerical and computational properties of the algorithm. They also\nconfirm that the algorithm performs at or close to the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB,\nlower bound on the variance of estimated parameters). We find that the\nalgorithm is suitable for application in self-calibration and discuss how it\ncan be included. We demonstrate an order-of-magnitude speed improvement in\ncalibration over traditional methods on actual LOFAR data.\n  Conclusions. In this paper, we demonstrate that ADI methods are a valid and\ncomputationally more efficient alternative to traditional gain calibration\nmethod and we report on its successful application in a number of actual data\nreduction pipelines.\n","Comment: accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics"]}]

It is shown that the found series represents the total\nradiation amplitude in the form of the sum of radiation amplitudes of electric\nand magnetis multipole photons. All information about the radiating system is\ncontained in the coefficients of the series which are the irreducible tensors\nbeing determined by the current density of transition. The expansion can be\nused for solving different problems that arise in studying electromagnetic\nfield-quantum system interaction both in long-wave approximation and outside\nits framework.\n","Comment: 7 pages"]}]

Production of\nmuons from pion decay is studied. Lithium lenses and solenoids are considered\nfor focussing pions from a target, and for matching the pions into a decay\nchannel.
