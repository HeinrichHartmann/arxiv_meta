Along the way, we show that invariance under (x,y) -> (y,x) is in\nfact more subtle than expected; we show that there exists a number of counter\nexamples, already in the case of the original Eynard-Orantin recursion, that\ndeserve further study.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 2 figures"]}]

The average spectrum shows a highly significant Fe feature. Our\nmodel-independent estimates of the equivalent width (EW) suggest a higher EW in\na broader range. The line, modelled as an unresolved Gaussian, is significant\nat 6.8 sigma and has an EW=95 eV (full sample). The current data can be fitted\nequally well adding a relativistic profile to the narrow component (in the full\nsample, EW=140 eV and 67 eV respectively for the relativistic and narrow\nlines). Thanks to the high quality of the XMM CDFS spectra and to the detailed\nmodelling of the continuum and instrumental effects, we have shown that the\nmost distant AGN exhibit a highly significant Fe emission feature.

Limited migration\namong allopatric populations and species interactions can also drive\nspeciation, but here we ask if trade-offs alone are sufficient to drive\nspeciation in the absence of other factors.

In this\nmodel resources are perfectly substitutable, and fitness is derived from the\nconsumption of these resources. The model contains no spatial parameters, and\nis therefore strictly sympatric. We quantify the degree of specialization by\nthe number of ecotypes formed and the niche breadth of the population, and\nobserve that these are sensitive to resource influx and trade-offs. Resource\ninflux has a strong effect on the degree of specialization, with a clear\ntransition between minimal diversification at high influx and multiple species\nevolving at low resource influx. At low resource influx the degree of\nspecialization further depends on the strength of the trade-offs, with more\necotypes evolving the stronger trade-offs are.

The lower cloud can account for the wing emission, and the upper\ncloud is mainly responsible for the absorption at line center. After choosing\ncarefully the free parameters, we get satisfactory fitting results. As\nexpected, the lower cloud shows an increase of the source function,\ncorresponding to a temperature increase of 400--1000 K in EBs relative to the\nquiet Sun. This is consistent with previous results deduced from semi-empirical\nmodels and confirms that a local heating occurs in the lower atmosphere during\nthe appearance of EBs. We also find that the optical depths can increase to\nsome extent in both the lower and upper clouds, which may result from either a\ndirect heating in the lower cloud, or illumination by an enhanced radiation on\nthe upper cloud. The velocities derived from this method, however, are\ndifferent from those obtained using the traditional bisector method, implying\nthat one should be cautious when interpreting this parameter.

We analytically compare the properties of our parallel GPs such as\ntime, space, and communication complexity. Empirical evaluation on two\nreal-world datasets in a cluster of 20 computing nodes shows that our parallel\nGPs are significantly more time-efficient and scalable than their centralized\ncounterparts and exact/full GP while achieving predictive performances\ncomparable to full GP.\n","Comment: Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth Conference on Uncertainty\n  in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2013)"]}]

Simply applying image-based warping algorithms to video-based\nface editing produces temporal incoherence in the synthesized videos because it\nis impossible to consistently localize facial features in two frames\nrepresenting two different faces in two different videos (or even two\nconsecutive frames representing the same face in one video). Therefore, high\nperformance face editing usually requires significant manual manipulation.

TSSW precisely estimates two\ncontrol lattices in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively from\nthe corresponding control lattices in the previous frame, by minimizing a novel\nenergy function that unifies a data-driven term, a smoothness term, and feature\npoint constraints. Corresponding warping surfaces then precisely map source\nframes to the target frames. Experimental testing on facial attractiveness\nenhancement, makeup transfer, face replacement, and expression manipulation\ndemonstrates that the proposed approaches can effectively preserve spatial\nsmoothness and temporal coherence in editing facial geometry, skin detail,\nidentity, and expression, which outperform the existing face editing methods.\nIn particular, TSSW is robust to subtly inaccurate localization of feature\npoints and is a vast improvement over image-based warping methods.\n"]}]

To achieve this, we first decompose the image\ninto its three color components, i.e., red, green and blue. Then, we get the\nbitplanes for each color, e.g., 8 bits-per-pixel, i.e., 8 bitplanes-per-color.\nFrom now on, we will work with the bitplane corresponding to the most\nsignificant bit (MSB) of each color, exclusive manner.

This\nmethodology allows us to avoid the problem of quantum measurement, which alters\nthe results of the measured except in the case of CBS.

Recently, Chen\nand Singer presented a method for deciding whether a rational function is\nsummable. To implement their method in the sense of algorithms, we need to\nsolve two problems. The first is to determine the shift equivalence of two\nbivariate polynomials. We solve this problem by presenting an algorithm for\ncomputing the dispersion sets of any two bivariate polynomials. The second is\nto solve a univariate difference equation in an algebraically closed field. By\nconsidering the irreducible factorization of the denominator of $f(x,y)$ in a\ngeneral field, we present a new criterion which requires only finding a\nrational solution of a bivariate difference equation. This goal can be achieved\nby deriving a universal denominator of the rational solutions and a degree\nbound on the numerator. Combining these two algorithms, we can decide the\nsummability of a bivariate rational function.\n","Comment: 18 pages"]}]

Nowadays\nstate of the art systems use deep learning on millions of labeled images with\nvery successful results on benchmarks, though it is unlikely to expect similar\nresults in unrestricted visual environments. Most learning schemes essentially\nignore the inherent sequential structure of videos: this might be a critical\nissue, since any visual recognition process is remarkably more complex when\nshuffling video frames. Based on this remark, we propose a re-foundation of the\ncommunication protocol between visual agents and the environment, which is\nreferred to as learning to see like children. Like for human interaction,\nvisual concepts are acquired by the agents solely by processing their own\nvisual stream along with human supervisions on selected pixels. We give a proof\nof concept that remarkable semantic labeling can emerge within this protocol by\nusing only a few supervised examples. This is made possible by exploiting a\nconstraint of motion coherent labeling that virtually offers tons of\nsupervisions. Additional visual constraints, including those associated with\nobject supervisions, are used within the context of learning from constraints.\nThe framework is extended in the direction of lifelong learning, so as our\nvisual agents live in their own visual environment without distinguishing\nlearning and test set. Learning takes place in deep architectures under a\nprogressive developmental scheme. In order to evaluate our Developmental Visual\nAgents (DVAs), in addition to classic benchmarks, we open the doors of our lab,\nallowing people to evaluate DVAs by crowd-sourcing.
