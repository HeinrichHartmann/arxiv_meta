We derive the orbit-averaged equations of motion and show\nthat in the limit of weak triaxiality, the pyramid orbits are integrable: the\nmotion consists of a two-dimensional libration of the major axis of the orbit\nabout the short axis of the triaxial figure, with eccentricity varying as a\nfunction of the two orientation angles, and reaching unity at the corners.\nBecause pyramid orbits occupy the lowest angular momentum regions of phase\nspace, they compete with collisional loss cone repopulation and with resonant\nrelaxation in supplying matter to BHs. General relativistic advance of the\nperiapse dominates the precession for sufficiently eccentric orbits, and we\nshow that relativity imposes an upper limit to the eccentricity: roughly the\nvalue at which the relativistic precession time is equal to the time for\ntorques to change the angular momentum. We argue that this upper limit to the\neccentricity should apply also to evolution driven by resonant relaxation, with\npotentially important consequences for the rate of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals\nin low-luminosity galaxies.

The loans were part of a general government policy which used\nindexation to the CPI to address the economic consequences of the\nhyperinflation. Although most other forms of indexation were subsequently\nremoved, loan indexation has remained, and these loans now comprise the\nmajority of mortgages in Iceland. Although it is still often argued that\nindex-linked loans helped to stop the hyperinflation, these arguments are\ntypically based on high level macro-economic interpretations of the Icelandic\neconomy, they fail to identify specific mechanisms to support their claims. In\nthis paper we take the opposite approach, and present a detailed analysis of\nthe monetary mechanics used for the loans at the double entry bookkeeping level\nof the banking system.\n  Based on this analysis there appears to be no evidence or mechanism that\nwould support the claim that index-linked loans reduce or stop inflation. On\nthe contrary: our research shows that the bookkeeping treatment of these loans\nwithin the banking system directly contributes to the banking system's monetary\nexpansion rate, and hence index-linked loans act to increase the inflation rate\nto which they are linked, rather than reducing it. They consequently create a\npositive feedback loop within the banking system's monetary regulation\noperating directly on the money supply. Since the feedback into monetary\nexpansion only occurs at annual CPI rates above approximately 2%, we suggest\none solution would be to stabilise the money supply to 0% growth, and we\nexplore some ways this could be achieved by modifying the Basel Regulatory\nFramework within the Icelandic Banking System.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 8 figures"]}]

Until now,\nhowever, most adaptive indexing algorithms have been designed single-threaded,\nyet with multi-core systems already well established, the idea of designing\nparallel algorithms for adaptive indexing is very natural. In this regard only\none parallel algorithm for adaptive indexing has recently appeared in the\nliterature: The parallel version of standard cracking. In this paper we\ndescribe three alternative parallel algorithms for adaptive indexing, including\na second variant of a parallel standard cracking algorithm. Additionally, we\ndescribe a hybrid parallel sorting algorithm, and a NUMA-aware method based on\nsorting. We then thoroughly compare all these algorithms experimentally; along\na variant of a recently published parallel version of radix sort. Parallel\nsorting algorithms serve as a realistic baseline for multi-threaded adaptive\nindexing techniques. In total we experimentally compare seven parallel\nalgorithms. Additionally, we extensively profile all considered algorithms. The\ninitial set of experiments considered in this paper indicates that our parallel\nalgorithms significantly improve over previously known ones. Our results\nsuggest that, although adaptive indexing algorithms are a good design choice in\nsingle-threaded environments, the rules change considerably in the parallel\ncase. That is, in future highly-parallel environments, sorting algorithms could\nbe serious alternatives to adaptive indexing.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 7 figures"]}]

Periodicity of the phase-factors with respect to action\nis shown in this article to impart corresponding periodicity to one parameter\nfamily of amplitudes generated by the translations of arclength. The\ntranslation parameter is also identified with arclength that can be adjoined to\nthe base space to obtain an extended manifold, which is endowed with a\nRiemannian structure induced in it by trajectories in the base. Further,\nperiodicity of the family of amplitudes with respect to the translation\nparameter together with the solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation are used to\ndevelop a quantized field formulation in the extended manifold of a collection\nof particles defined by the original particle. The extended manifold can\nreplace the base in this treatment and thus, the program continues for higher\ndimensional manifolds generated in the process. Results are illustrated with\nthe example of the base being the 3D Euclidean space, yielding the classical\nand quantum descriptions of a photon and its quantized field description with\nzero vacuum energy in the extended manifold, which with arclength identified\nwith time results in the Minkowski spacetime. Parallel formulation for a\nmassive particle is described briefly.\n"]}]

Many other new phenomena are being investigated\nfor nano-electronic memory as described in Part II of this book. It seems\nnatural to ask whether these advances in memory devices could also translate\ninto a new class of logic devices.\n  What makes logic devices different from memory is the need for one device to\ndrive another and this calls for gain, directionality and input-output\nisolation as exemplified by the transistor. With this in mind we will try to\npresent our perspective on how W and R devices in general, spintronic or\notherwise, could be integrated into transistor-like switches that can be\ninterconnected to build complex circuits without external amplifiers or clocks.\nWe will argue that the most common switch used to implement digital logic based\non complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) transistors can be viewed as\nan integrated W-R unit having an input-output asymmetry that give it gain and\ndirectionality. Such a viewpoint is not intended to provide any insight into\nthe operation of CMOS switches, but rather as an aid to understanding how W and\nR units based on spins and magnets can be combined to build transistor-like\nswitches. Next we will discuss the standard W and R units used for magnetic\nmemory devices and present one way to integrate them into a single unit with\nthe input electrically isolated from the output. But we argue that this\nintegrated W-R unit would not provide the key property of gain. We will then\nshow that the recently discovered giant spin Hall effect could be used to\nconstruct a W-R unit with gain and suggest other possibilities for spin\nswitches with gain.\n","Comment: 27 pages.
