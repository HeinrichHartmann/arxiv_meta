M. Li, W. Pedrycz, Fuzzy finite automata and fuzzy regular\nexpressions with membership values in lattice ordered monoids, Fuzzy Sets and\nSystems 156 (2005) 68--92] have proved fundamental results that provide\ndifferent equivalent ways to represent fuzzy languages with membership values\nin a lattice-ordered monoid, and generalize the well-known results of the\nclassical theory of formal languages. In particular, they have shown that a\nfuzzy language over an integral lattice-ordered monoid can be represented by a\nfuzzy regular expression if and only if it can be recognized by a fuzzy finite\nautomaton. However, they did not give any effective method for constructing an\nequivalent fuzzy finite automaton from a given fuzzy regular expression. In\nthis paper we provide such an effective method. Transforming scalars appearing\nin a fuzzy regular expression {\\alpha} into letters of the new extended\nalphabet, we convert the fuzzy regular expression {\\alpha} to an ordinary\nregular expression {\\alpha}_{R}. Then, starting from an arbitrary\nnondeterministic finite automaton A that recognizes the language ||{\\alpha}_R||\nrepresented by the regular expression {\\alpha}_R, we construct fuzzy finite\nautomata A_{\\alpha} and A_{\\alpha}^r with the same or even less number of\nstates than the automaton A, which recognize the fuzzy language ||{\\alpha}||\nrepresented by the fuzzy regular expression {\\alpha}. The starting\nnondeterministic finite automaton A can be obtained from {\\alpha}_R using any\nof the well-known constructions for converting regular expressions to\nnondeterministic finite automata, such as Glushkov-McNaughton-Yamada's position\nautomaton, Brzozowski's derivative automaton, Antimirov's partial derivative\nautomaton, or Ilie-Yu's follow automaton.\n","Comment: 26 pages, submitted to a journal"]}]

Kac in his study of\nmean-field limit for systems of $N$ undistinguishable particles. First, we\nquantitatively liken three usual measures of Kac's chaos, some involving the\nall $N$ variables, other involving a finite fixed number of variables. Next, we\ndefine the notion of entropy chaos and Fisher information chaos in a similar\nway as defined by Carlen et al (KRM 2010). We show that Fisher information\nchaos is stronger than entropy chaos, which in turn is stronger than Kac's\nchaos. More importantly, with the help of the HWI inequality of Otto-Villani,\nwe establish a quantitative estimate between these quantities, which in\nparticular asserts that Kac's chaos plus Fisher information bound implies\nentropy chaos. We then extend the above quantitative and qualitative results\nabout chaos in the framework of probability measures with support on the Kac's\nspheres. Additionally to the above mentioned tool, we use and prove an optimal\nrate local CLT in $L^\\infty$ norm for distributions with finite 6-th moment and\nfinite $L^p$ norm, for some $p>1$. Last, we investigate how our techniques can\nbe used without assuming chaos, in the context of probability measures mixtures\nintroduced by De Finetti, Hewitt and Savage. In particular, we define the\n(level 3) Fisher information for mixtures and prove that it is l.s.c. and\naffine, as that was done previously for the level 3 Boltzmann's entropy.\n","Comment: 80 pages.

Its main hypothesis states indeed\nthat the classical trajectories of the particles are identical to the sample\nfunctions of a diffusion Markov process, whose conditional probability density\nis proposed as a substitute for the wave function. The Schroedinger equation\nand the so-called Nelson equations are used to determine the diffusion tensor\nand the drift vectors characteristic of such a process.

Similarly,\ncombinatorial geometry is often concerned with the problem of bounding the\nbehaviour of arbitrary finite collections of geometric objects such as points,\nlines, or circles with respect to geometric operations such as incidence or\ndistance. Given the presence of arbitrary finite sets in these problems, the\nmethods used to attack these problems have primarily been combinatorial in\nnature. In recent years, however, many outstanding problems in these questions\nhave been solved by algebraic means (and more specifically, using tools from\nalgebraic geometry and/or algebraic topology), giving rise to an emerging set\nof techniques which is now known as the polynomial method.\n  While various instances of the polynomial method have been known for decades\n(e.g. Stepanov's method, the combinatorial nullstellensatz, or Baker's\ntheorem), the general theory of this method is still in the process of\nmaturing; in particular, the limitations of the polynomial method are not well\nunderstood, and there is still considerable scope to apply deeper results from\nalgebraic geometry or algebraic topology to strengthen the method further. In\nthis survey we present several of the known applications of these methods,\nfocusing on the simplest cases to illustrate the techniques. We will assume as\nlittle prior knowledge of algebraic geometry as possible.\n","Comment: 44 pages, no figures. Final revision, incorporating several minor\n  corrections"]}]

Comparisons between the PDOS\nmeasurements and the simulations show reasonable agreement overall, but they\nalso reveal important areas of disagreement for both high and low temperatures.\nThe discrepancies stem largely from an ~ 10 meV compression in the overall\nbandwidth (energy range) of the oxygen-dominated optical phonons in the\nsimulations. A similar linewidth-convoluted comparison performed with the PDOS\nspectrum of Dolling et al. obtained by shell-model fitting to their historical\nphonon dispersion measurements shows excellent agreement with the\ntime-of-flight PDOS measurements reported here.

We focus on a two-dimensional\nopen flow composed of a pair of vortices and its specular image, which is a\nsystem we represent as a vortex pair plus a wall along the symmetry line.\nConsidering particles that are much denser than the fluid, we show that two\npoint attractors form in the neighborhood of the vortex pair provided that the\nparticle Stokes number is smaller than a critical value of order unity. In the\nabsence of the wall, the boundaries of the basins of the attracting points are\nsmooth. When the wall is present, the point attractors describe\ncounter-rotating ellipses in this frame, with a period equal to half the period\nof one isolated vortex pair. However, their boundaries are shown to become\nfractal if the distance to the wall is smaller than a critical distance that\nscales with the inverse square root of the Stokes number. This transformation\nis related to the breakdown of a separatrix that gives rise to a heteroclinic\ntangle close to the vortices, which we describe using a Melnikov function. For\nan even smaller distance to the wall, we demonstrate that a second separatrix\nbreaks down and a new heteroclinic tangle forms farther away from the vortices.\nParticles released in the open part of the flow can approach the attractors and\nbe trapped permanently provided that they cross the two separatrices.\nFurthermore, the trapping of heavy particles from the open flow is shown to be\nrobust to the presence of gravity, viscosity, and noise.\n"]}]

The procedure leads naturally to an\nintuitive basis for estimating error that is used in conjunction with multiple\nmeshes to assure convergence. The methodology is demonstrate for a suite of\nthree experiments that had been previously published as part of a study on the\neffect of weld speed on friction stir welding. The probe interface temperatures\nand torques are estimated for all three weld speeds and the multi-mesh error\nestimation methodology is employed to quantify the rate of convergence.\nFinally, comparison of computed and measured power usage is used as a further\nvalidation.

The method is successful in identifying the presence or absence\nof marketing activity for product B about 84% of the time. We allude to the\nissue of whether, if one can infer marketing activity about product B from\nknowledge of marketing activity for product A and of sales volumes of both\nproducts, the reverse might be possible and one might be able to impute\nmarketing activity for product A from knowledge of that of product B.

Y is given by\ncomposition with a unique Colombeau generalized function from Y to X. We also\nidentify the multiplicative linear functionals from the special algebra of\nColombeau generalized functions on X to the ring of Colombeau generalized\nnumbers. Up to multiplication with an idempotent generalized number, they are\ngiven by an evaluation map at a compactly supported generalized point on X.\n","Comment: 10 pages"]}]
