Furthermore, unlike nonspatial CR methods, SCR models account for\nheterogeneity in capture probability arising from the juxtaposition of animal\nactivity centers and sample locations. Although the utility of SCR methods is\ngaining recognition, the requirement that all individuals can be uniquely\nidentified excludes their use in many contexts. In this paper, we develop\nmodels for situations in which individual recognition is not possible, thereby\nallowing SCR concepts to be applied in studies of unmarked or partially marked\npopulations. The data required for our model are spatially referenced counts\nmade on one or more sample occasions at a collection of closely spaced sample\nunits such that individuals can be encountered at multiple locations. Our\napproach includes a spatial point process for the animal activity centers and\nuses the spatial correlation in counts as information about the number and\nlocation of the activity centers. Camera-traps, hair snares, track plates,\nsound recordings, and even point counts can yield spatially correlated count\ndata, and thus our model is widely applicable.

In particular, Fulling et al. used the finite energy-momentum-stress\ntensor in the presence of a perfectly conducting wedge, calculated many years\nago by Deutsch and Candelas, to compute the torque on one of the wedge\nboundaries, where the latter was cutoff by integrating the torque density down\nto minimum lower radius greater than zero. They observed that that torque is\nnot equal to the negative derivative of the energy obtained by integrating the\nenergy density down to the same minimum radius. This motivated a calculation of\nthe torque and energy in an annular sector obtained by the intersection of the\nwedge with two coaxial cylinders. In a previous paper we showed that for the\nanalogous scalar case, which also exhibited a torque anomaly in the absence of\nthe cylindrical boundaries, the point-split regulated torque and energy indeed\nexhibit an anomaly, unless the point-splitting is along the axis direction. In\nany case, because of curvature divergences, no unambiguous finite part can be\nextracted. However, that ambiguity is linear in the wedge angle; if the\ncondition is imposed that the linear term be removed, the resulting torque and\nenergy is finite, and exhibits no anomaly. In this paper, we demonstrate the\nsame phenomenon takes place for the electromagnetic field, so there is no\ntorque anomaly present here either.

This\nis especially true in the case of mobile systems, where multipath propagation\ncauses the received signal to be seriously degraded. Over the years, many\ntechniques have been proposed to combat channel effects. Two of the most\npopular are linear equalisation (LE) and decision feedback equalisation (DFE).\nThese methods offer a good compromise between performance and computational\ncomplexity. LE and DFE are implemented using finite impulse response (FIR)\nfilters whose frequency spectrum approximates the inverse of the channel\nspectrum plus noise. In mobile systems, the equaliser is made adaptable in\norder to be able to respond to the channel variations. Adaptability is achieved\nusing adaptive FIR filters whose coefficients are iteratively updated. In\nprinciple, an infinite number of filter coefficients would be needed to achieve\nperfect channel inversion. In practice, the number of taps must be finite.\nSimulations show that, in realistic scenarios, making the equaliser longer than\na certain (undetermined) number of taps will not yield any benefit. Moreover,\ncomputation and power will be wasted. In battery powered devices, like mobile\nterminals, it would be desirable to have the equaliser properly dimensioned.\nThe equaliser's optimum length strongly depends on the particular scenario, and\nas channel conditions vary, this optimum is likely to vary. This thesis\npresents novel techniques to perform equaliser length adjustment. Methods for\nthe LE and the DFE have been developed. Simulations in many different scenarios\nshow that the proposed schemes optimise the number of taps to be used.\nMoreover, these techniques are able to detect changes in the channel and\nre-adjust the equaliser length appropriately.\n","Comment: PhD Thesis, University of Bradford (UK), 2002"]}]

A denser particle submerges itself to a\nconsiderable depth inside the gel and becomes buoyant by balancing its weight\nagainst the elastic force exerted by the surrounding medium. By virtue of a\nlarge elastic-capillary length, the surface of the gel wraps around the\nparticle and closes to create a line singularity connecting the particle to the\nfree surface of the gel. Substantial amount of tensile strain is thus developed\nin the gel network parallel to the free surface that penetrates to a\nsignificant depth inside the gel. The field of this tensile strain is rather\nlong range owing to a large correlation length and strong enough to pull two\nsubmerged particles into contact. The particles move towards each other with an\neffective force following an inverse linear distance law. When more monomers or\ndimers of the particles are released inside the gel, they orient rather freely\ninside the capsules they are in, and attract each other to form close packed\nclusters. Eventually, these clusters themselves interact and coalesce. This is\nan emergent phenomenon in which the gravity, the capillarity and the elasticity\nwork in tandem to create a long range interaction.

The value of the spin\nsplitting needed to fully polarize the hole gas, evidences a strong enhancement\nof the spin susceptibility of the hole gas due to carrier-carrier interaction.\nAt small values of the spin splitting, whatever the carrier density (non zero)\nis, photoluminescence lines are due to the formation of charged excitons in the\nsinglet state.

The methods are based\non a modified form of the Hellinger--Reissner variational principle that only\nweakly imposes the symmetry condition on the stresses. Although this approach\nhas been previously used by a number of authors, a key new ingredient here is a\nconstructive derivation of the elasticity complex starting from the de Rham\ncomplex. By mimicking this construction in the discrete case, we derive new\nmixed finite elements for elasticity in a systematic manner from known\ndiscretizations of the de Rham complex. These elements appear to be simpler\nthan the ones previously derived. For example, we construct stable\ndiscretizations which use only piecewise linear elements to approximate the\nstress field and piecewise constant functions to approximate the displacement\nfield.\n","Comment: to appear in Mathematics of Computation"]}]
