This article provides\na novel probabilistic framework for assessing whether the semantics of\nconceptual combinations are compositional, and so can be considered as a\nfunction of the semantics of the constituent concepts, or not. While the\nsystematicity and productivity of language provide a strong argument in favor\nof assuming compositionality, this very assumption is still regularly\nquestioned in both cognitive science and philosophy. Additionally, the\nprinciple of semantic compositionality is underspecified, which means that\nnotions of both \"strong\" and \"weak\" compositionality appear in the literature.\nRather than adjudicating between different grades of compositionality, the\nframework presented here contributes formal methods for determining a clear\ndividing line between compositional and non-compositional semantics. In\naddition, we suggest that the distinction between these is contextually\nsensitive. Utilizing formal frameworks developed for analyzing composite\nsystems in quantum theory, we present two methods that allow the semantics of\nconceptual combinations to be classified as \"compositional\" or\n\"non-compositional\". Compositionality is first formalised by factorising the\njoint probability distribution modeling the combination, where the terms in the\nfactorisation correspond to individual concepts. This leads to the necessary\nand sufficient condition for the joint probability distribution to exist. A\nfailure to meet this condition implies that the underlying concepts cannot be\nmodeled in a single probability space when considering their combination, and\nthe combination is thus deemed \"non-compositional\". The formal analysis methods\nare demonstrated by applying them to an empirical study of twenty-four\nnon-lexicalised conceptual combinations.\n","Comment: Revisions (Journal of Mathematical Psychology)"]}]

Because it is NP-hard, some heuristics\nwere proposed to find sub-optimal solutions. Still, one of the commonly used\nassumption is the one that seeds are chosen on the static network, not the\ndynamic one. This static approach is in fact far from the real-world networks,\nwhere new nodes may appear and old ones dynamically disappear in course of\ntime.\n  The main purpose of this paper is to analyse how the results of one of the\ntypical models for spread of influence - linear threshold - differ depending on\nthe strategy of building the social network used later for choosing seeds. To\nshow the impact of network creation strategy on the final number of influenced\nnodes - outcome of spread of influence, the results for three approaches were\nstudied: one static and two temporal with different granularities, i.e. various\nnumber of time windows. Social networks for each time window encapsulated\ndynamic changes in the network structure. Calculation of various node\nstructural measures like degree or betweenness respected these changes by means\nof forgetting mechanism - more recent data had greater influence on node\nmeasure values. These measures were, in turn, used for node ranking and their\nselection for seeding.\n  All concepts were applied to experimental verification on five real datasets.\nThe results revealed that temporal approach is always better than static and\nthe higher granularity in the temporal social network while seeding, the more\nfinally influenced nodes. Additionally, outdegree measure with exponential\nforgetting typically outperformed other time-dependent structural measures, if\nused for seed candidate ranking.\n"]}]

We show that the thermal instability does not operate at\nthe present very low level of the Sgr A* activity. However, Sgr A* was much\nmore luminous in the past. For the highest luminosity states the two-phase\nmedium can be created up to 1.4 pc from the centre. The presence of dust grains\ntends to suppress the instability, but the dust is destroyed in the presence of\nstrong radiation field and hot plasma. The clumpiness is thus induced in the\nhigh activity period, and the cooling/heating timescales are long enough to\npreserve later the past multi-phase structure. The instability enhances the\nclumpiness of the mini-spiral medium and creates a possibility of episodes of\nenhanced accretion of cold clumps towards Sgr A*. The mechanism determines the\nrange of masses and sizes of clouds; under the conditions of Sgr A*, the likely\nvalues come out $1$ - $10^2M_{\\oplus}$ for the cloud typical mass.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS, 10 pages, 7 figures"]}]

To this end, this paper investigates the performance limits of\nwireless communication in HSRs scenario. Since the hybrid information\ntransmitted between train and base station usually has diverse quality of\nservice (QoS) requirements, QoS-based achievable rate region is utilized to\ncharacterize the transmission performance in this paper.

The corresponding optimal power allocation strategy is also given\nto achieve the maximal boundary of achievable rate region.

While\nsuch coarse models are robust and allow for reliable object detection, they\ndiscard much of the information about objects' 3D shape and pose, and thus do\nnot lend themselves well to higher-level reasoning. Here, we propose to base\nscene understanding on a high-resolution object representation. An object class\n- in our case cars - is modeled as a deformable 3D wireframe, which enables\nfine-grained modeling at the level of individual vertices and faces. We augment\nthat model to explicitly include vertex-level occlusion, and embed all\ninstances in a common coordinate frame, in order to infer and exploit\nobject-object interactions. Specifically, from a single view we jointly\nestimate the shapes and poses of multiple objects in a common 3D frame. A\nground plane in that frame is estimated by consensus among different objects,\nwhich significantly stabilizes monocular 3D pose estimation. The fine-grained\nmodel, in conjunction with the explicit 3D scene model, further allows one to\ninfer part-level occlusions between the modeled objects, as well as occlusions\nby other, unmodeled scene elements. To demonstrate the benefits of such\ndetailed object class models in the context of scene understanding we\nsystematically evaluate our approach on the challenging KITTI street scene\ndataset.

One may thus wonder if there\nexists a meaningful convex objective function for the inference problem in\nhuman computation. In this paper, we investigate this convexity issue for human\ncomputation. We take an axiomatic approach by formulating a set of axioms that\nimpose two mild and natural assumptions on the objective function for the\ninference. Under these axioms, we show that it is unfortunately impossible to\nensure convexity of the inference problem. On the other hand, we show that\ninterestingly, in the absence of a requirement to model \"spammers\", one can\nconstruct reasonable objective functions for crowdsourcing that guarantee\nconvex inference.\n","Comment: AAAI 2015"]}]

In the framework of static clustering, we start by\nintroducing a soft kernel spectral clustering (SKSC) algorithm, which can\nbetter deal with overlapping clusters with respect to kernel spectral\nclustering (KSC) and provides more interpretable outcomes. Afterwards, a whole\nstrategy based upon KSC for community detection of static networks is proposed,\nwhere the extraction of a high quality training sub-graph, the choice of the\nkernel function, the model selection and the applicability to large-scale data\nare key aspects. This paves the way for the development of a novel clustering\nalgorithm for the analysis of evolving networks called kernel spectral\nclustering with memory effect (MKSC), where the temporal smoothness between\nclustering results in successive time steps is incorporated at the level of the\nprimal optimization problem, by properly modifying the KSC formulation. Later\non, an application of KSC to fault detection of an industrial machine is\npresented. Here, a smart pre-processing of the data by means of a proper\nwindowing operation is necessary to catch the ongoing degradation process\naffecting the machine. In this way, in a genuinely unsupervised manner, it is\npossible to raise an early warning when necessary, in an online fashion.\nFinally, we propose a new algorithm called incremental kernel spectral\nclustering (IKSC) for online learning of non-stationary data. This ambitious\nchallenge is faced by taking advantage of the out-of-sample property of kernel\nspectral clustering (KSC) to adapt the initial model, in order to tackle\nmerging, splitting or drifting of clusters across time.
