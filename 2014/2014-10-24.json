At the same time single photons\nand pairs of single photons are important building blocks in the fields of\nlinear optical based quantum computation and quantum repeater infrastructure.\nThese fields possess enormous potential and much scientific and technological\nprogress has been made in developing individual components, like quantum\nmemories and photon sources using various physical implementations. However,\nfurther progress suffers from the lack of compatibility between these different\ncomponents. Ultimately, one aims for a versatile source of single photons and\nphoton pairs in order to overcome this hurdle of incompatibility. Such a photon\nsource should allow for tuning of the spectral properties (wide wavelength\nrange and narrow bandwidth) to address different implementations while\nretaining high efficiency. In addition, it should be able to bridge different\nwavelength regimes to make implementations compatible. Here we introduce and\nexperimentally demonstrate such a versatile single photon and photon pair\nsource based on the physics of whispering gallery resonators. A disk-shaped,\nmonolithic and intrinsically stable resonator is made of lithium niobate and\nsupports a cavity-assisted triply-resonant spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion process. Measurements show that photon pairs are efficiently\ngenerated in two highly tunable resonator modes. We verify wavelength tuning\nover 100 nm between both modes with a controllable bandwidth between 7.2 and 13\nMHz. Heralding of single photons yields anti-bunching with $g^{(2)}(0) < 0.2$.\nThis compact source provides unprecedented possibilities to couple to different\nphysical quantum systems and renders it ideal for the implementation of quantum\nrepeaters and optical quantum information processing.\n"]}]

This Jeans filtering scale\nhas fundamental cosmological implications: it provides a thermal record of heat\ninjected by UV photons during reionization events, determines the clumpiness of\nthe IGM, and sets the minimum mass scale for gravitational collapse, a key\nquantity in galaxy formation. Unfortunately, it is extremely challenging to\nmeasure via the standard analysis of purely longitudinal Lyman-alpha forest\nspectra, because the thermal Doppler broadening of absorption lines is highly\ndegenerate with Jeans pressure smoothing. In this work we show that the Jeans\nscale can be directly measured by characterizing the coherence of correlated\nLyman-alpha absorption in quasar pairs with separations small enough to resolve\nit.

For each fixed $M\\in\\S^d$, $F(\\om,y,M)$ is a stationary\nprocess, that is, $F(\\om,y,M)=\\tilde F(T(y)\\om,M):= F(T(y)\\om,0,M)$, where\n$T(y):\\Om\\to\\Om$ is an ergodic group of measure preserving mappings such that\nthe mapping $(\\om,y)\\to T(y)\\om$ is measurable. Also, $F(\\om,y,M)$, $M\\in\\S^d$,\nis uniformly elliptic, with ellipticity constants $0<\\l<\\gL$ independent of\n$(\\om,y)\\in\\Om\\X\\R^d$. The result presented here is a particular instance of\nthe general theorem of Caffarelli, Souganidis and Wang, in CPAM 2005. Our point\nhere is just to show a straightforward proof for this special case, which\nserves as a motivation for that general theorem, whose proof involves much more\nintricate arguments. We remark that any continuous stationary process verifies\nthe property that almost all realizations belong to an ergodic algebra, and\nthat $\\APs(\\R^d)$ is, so far, the greatest known ergodic algebra on $\\R^d$.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1305.4167"]}]

The clock time\nof each polarimeter event is used to unfold the 120-kHz spin precession and\nassign events to bins according to the direction of the horizontal\npolarization. After accumulation for one or more seconds, the down-up\nscattering asymmetry can be calculated for each direction and matched to a\nsinusoidal function whose magnitude is proportional to the horizontal\npolarization. This requires prior knowledge of the spin tune or polarization\nprecession rate. An initial estimate is refined by re-sorting the events as the\nspin tune is adjusted across a narrow range and searching for the maximum\npolarization magnitude. The result is biased toward polarization values that\nare too large, in part because of statistical fluctuations but also because\nsinusoidal fits to even random data will produce sizeable magnitudes when the\nphase is left free to vary. An analysis procedure is described that matches the\ntime dependence of the horizontal polarization to templates based on\nemittance-driven polarization loss while correcting for the positive bias. This\ninformation will be used to study ways to extend the horizontal polarization\nlifetime by correcting spin tune spread using ring sextupole fields and thereby\nto support the feasibility of searching for an intrinsic electric dipole moment\nusing polarized beams in a storage ring.

Using results from the literature on diffusion-influenced reactions, we\nderive an analytical expression for the lower bound on the precision of\ntranscriptional regulation. In our theory, transcription factors can perform\nmultiple rounds of 1D diffusion along the DNA and 3D diffusion in the cytoplasm\nbefore binding to the promoter. Comparing our expression for the lower bound on\nthe precision against results from Green's Function Reaction Dynamics\nsimulations shows that the theory is highly accurate under biologically\nrelevant conditions. Our results demonstrate that, to an excellent\napproximation, the promoter switches between the transcription-factor bound and\nunbound state in a Markovian fashion. This remains true even in the presence of\nsliding, i.e. with 1D diffusion along the DNA. This has two important\nimplications: (1) minimizing the noise in the promoter state is equivalent to\nminimizing the search time of transcription factors for their promoters; (2)\nthe complicated dynamics of 3D diffusion in the cytoplasm and 1D diffusion\nalong the DNA can be captured in a well-stirred model by renormalizing the\npromoter association and dissociation rates, making it possible to efficiently\nsimulate the promoter dynamics using Gillespie simulations.

Backbone rigidity, hydrogen-bonding\ncapability and degree of functionalization (<i>F</i>: 16&plusmn12 &ndash\n91&plusmn7 mol.-%) of introduced moieties governed the structure-property\nrelationships in resulting collagen networks, so that the swelling ratio\n(<i>SR</i>: 707&plusmn51 &ndash 1996&plusmn182 wt.-%), bulk compressive modulus\n(<i>E<sub>c</sub></i>: 30&plusmn7 &ndash 168&plusmn40 kPa) and Atomic Force\nMicroscopy elastic modulus (<i>E<sub>AFM</sub></i>: 16&plusmn2 &ndash\n387&plusmn66 kPa) were readily adjusted. In light of their remarkably high\nswelling and mechanical properties, these tunable collagen hydrogels may be\nfurther exploited for the design of advanced dressings for chronic wound care.\n","Comment: Accepted in \"Journal of the Royal Society Interface\""]}]

However, once the confining quantum well is\nsufficiently large, this situation is changed and the density can no longer be\nassumed as a $\\delta$ function. In addition, it is known that the density\nprofile is not a single peaked function, instead can present more than one\nmaxima, depending on the well width. In this work, the electron density\ndistributions in the growth direction considering a variety of wide quantum\nwells are investigated as function of temperature. We show that, the double\npeak in the density profile varies from symmetric (similar peak height) to\nasymmetric while changing the temperature for particular growth parameters. The\nalternation from symmetric to asymmetric density profiles is known to exhibit\nintriguing phase transitions and is decisive in defining the properties of the\nground state wavefunction in the presence of an external magnetic field, i.e\nfrom insulating phases to even denominator fractional quantum Hall states.\nHere, by solving the temperature and material dependent Schr\\\"odinger and\nPoisson equations self-consistently, we found that such a phase transition may\nelaborated by taking into account direct Coulomb interactions together with\ntemperature.\n"]}]
