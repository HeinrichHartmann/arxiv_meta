A real circle can be defined as the image of\nthe real axis under a Moebius transformation in the complex field. Likewise,\nand roughly speaking, a hypercircle can be defined as the image of a line (\"the\n${\\mathbb{K}}$-axis\") in a $n$-degree finite algebraic extension\n$\\mathbb{K}(\\alpha)\\thickapprox\\mathbb{K}^n$ under the transformation\n$\\frac{at+b}{ct+d}:\\mathbb{K}(\\alpha)\\to\\mathbb{K}(\\alpha)$.\n  The aim of this article is to extend, to the case of hypercircles, some of\nthe specific properties of circles. We show that hypercircles are precisely,\nvia $\\mathbb{K}$-projective transformations, the rational normal curve of a\nsuitable degree. We also obtain a complete description of the points at\ninfinity of these curves (generalizing the cyclic structure at infinity of\ncircles). We characterize hypercircles as those curves of degree equal to the\ndimension of the ambient affine space and with infinitely many\n${\\mathbb{K}}$-rational points, passing through these points at infinity.\nMoreover, we give explicit formulae for the parametrization and implicitation\nof hypercircles. Besides the intrinsic interest of this very special family of\ncurves, the understanding of its properties has a direct application to the\nsimplification of parametrizations problem, as shown in the last section.\n","Comment: 31 pages, 1 figure"]}]

The key challenge in practical full-duplex systems is uncancelled\nself-interference signal, which is caused by a combination of hardware and\nimplementation imperfections. Thus, we first present a signal model which\ncaptures the effect of significant impairments such as oscillator phase noise,\nlow-noise amplifier noise figure, mixer noise, and analog-to-digital converter\nquantization noise. Using the detailed signal model, we study the rate gain\nregion, which is defined as the region of received signal-of-interest strength\nwhere full-duplex systems outperform half-duplex systems in terms of achievable\nrate. The rate gain region is derived as a piece-wise linear approximation in\nlog-domain, and numerical results show that the approximation closely matches\nthe exact region. Our analysis shows that when phase noise dominates mixer and\nquantization noise, full-duplex systems can use either active analog\ncancellation or base-band digital cancellation to achieve near-identical rate\ngain regions. Finally, as a design example, we numerically investigate the\nfull-duplex system performance and rate gain region in typical indoor\nenvironments for practical wireless applications.\n","Comment: Accepted on 09-May-2013 for publications at IEEE Transactions on\n  Wireless Communications (check the IEEE website for the final published\n  version)"]}]

We measure an integrated flux density of\n$7.3\\pm1.1$ mJy at 610 MHz for the radio halo, resulting in a 1.4 GHz radio\npower of $5.1 \\times 10^{24}$ W/Hz.

When $k=1$, this is\nequivalent to the zero forcing number, usually denoted with $Z(G)$, a recently\nintroduced invariant that gives an upper bound on the maximum nullity of a\ngraph.

In this work we propose to\ncompute the seismic observable $\\beta$, which is a proxy of the phase shift of\nthe acoustic modes propagating in the envelope of the Sun-like stars. This\nseismic parameter $\\beta$ can be used to identify rapid variation regions\nusually known as glitches. We show that a small variation in the structure,\nsmaller than 1% in the sound speed, produces a glitch in the acoustic potential\nthat could explain the oscillatory character of $\\beta$. This method allows us\nto determine the location and the thickness of the glitch with precision. We\napplied this idea to the Sun-like star $\\alpha$ Centauri A and found a glitch\nlocated at approximately $0.94\\,R$ (1400 s) and with a thickness of 0.2% of the\nstars' radius. This is fully consistent with the data and also validates other\nseismic tests.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables"]}]

A Theoretical Assessment (Part II)"],"description":["  An extreme learning machine (ELM) can be regarded as a two stage feed-forward\nneural network (FNN) learning system which randomly assigns the connections\nwith and within hidden neurons in the first stage and tunes the connections\nwith output neurons in the second stage. Therefore, ELM training is essentially\na linear learning problem, which significantly reduces the computational\nburden. Numerous applications show that such a computation burden reduction\ndoes not degrade the generalization capability. It has, however, been open that\nwhether this is true in theory. The aim of our work is to study the theoretical\nfeasibility of ELM by analyzing the pros and cons of ELM. In the previous part\non this topic, we pointed out that via appropriate selection of the activation\nfunction, ELM does not degrade the generalization capability in the expectation\nsense. In this paper, we launch the study in a different direction and show\nthat the randomness of ELM also leads to certain negative consequences. On one\nhand, we find that the randomness causes an additional uncertainty problem of\nELM, both in approximation and learning. On the other hand, we theoretically\njustify that there also exists an activation function such that the\ncorresponding ELM degrades the generalization capability. In particular, we\nprove that the generalization capability of ELM with Gaussian kernel is\nessentially worse than that of FNN with Gaussian kernel. To facilitate the use\nof ELM, we also provide a remedy to such a degradation. We find that the\nwell-developed coefficient regularization technique can essentially improve the\ngeneralization capability. The obtained results reveal the essential\ncharacteristic of ELM and give theoretical guidance concerning how to use ELM.\n","Comment: 13 pages"]}]

Since most\nexisting methods are supervised and require large corpora, which for many\nlanguages do not exist, we have concentrated our efforts to reduce the need for\nannotated data as much as possible. This paper presents two different\nalgorithms towards this goal. The first algorithm is a weakly supervised\nmachine learning approach for classification of temporal relations between\nevents. In the first stage, the algorithm learns a general classifier from an\nannotated corpus. Then, inspired by the hypothesis of \"one type of temporal\nrelation per discourse, it extracts useful information from a cluster of\ntopically related documents. We show that by combining the global information\nof such a cluster with local decisions of a general classifier, a bootstrapping\ncross-document classifier can be built to extract temporal relations between\nevents. Our experiments show that without any additional annotated data, the\naccuracy of the proposed algorithm is higher than that of several previous\nsuccessful systems. The second proposed method for temporal relation extraction\nis based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Within EM, we used\ndifferent techniques such as a greedy best-first search and integer linear\nprogramming for temporal inconsistency removal. We think that the experimental\nresults of our EM based algorithm, as a first step toward a fully unsupervised\ntemporal relation extraction method, is encouraging.\n"]}]
