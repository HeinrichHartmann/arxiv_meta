We observed phase-separated structures and\ndetermined the membrane miscibility temperatures in several binary and ternary\nlipid mixtures of unsaturated neutral lipid, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine\n(DOPC), saturated neutral lipid, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC),\nunsaturated charged lipid, dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol\n(DOPG$^{\\scriptsize{(-)}}$), saturated charged lipid,\ndipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG$^{\\scriptsize{(-)}}$), and cholesterol.\nIn binary mixtures of saturated and unsaturated charged lipids, the combination\nof the charged head with the saturation of hydrocarbon tail is a dominant\nfactor for the stability of membrane phase separation.\nDPPG$^{\\scriptsize{(-)}}$ enhances phase separation, while\nDOPG$^{\\scriptsize{(-)}}$ suppresses it. Furthermore, the addition of\nDPPG$^{\\scriptsize{(-)}}$ to a binary mixture of DPPC/cholesterol induces phase\nseparation between DPPG$^{\\scriptsize{(-)}}$-rich and cholesterol-rich phases.\nThis indicates that cholesterol localization depends strongly on the electric\ncharge on the hydrophilic head group rather than on the ordering of the\nhydrocarbon tails. Finally, when DPPG$^{\\scriptsize{(-)}}$ was added to a\nneutral ternary system of DOPC/DPPC/Cholesterol (a conventional model of\nmembrane rafts), a three-phase coexistence was produced. We conclude by\ndiscussing some qualitative features of the phase behaviour in charged\nmembranes using a free energy approach.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 6 figures"]}]

Our model is of the same conceptional simplicity than the model\nof Held & Suarez (1994) and is thus computationally fast.

We confirm that the $P_{rot}$ = 10 days case is\nmore dominated by equatorial superrotation dynamics than the $P_{rot}$ = 36.5\ndays case, which shows diminishing influence of standing Rossby- Kelvin waves\nand increasing influence of divergence at the top of the atmosphere. We argue\nthat this dynamical regime change relates to the increase in Rossby deformation\nradius, in agreement with previous studies.

When the population totals of some auxiliary variables are known\nand when the inclusion probabilities are known by design, survey statisticians\nhave developed calibration methods for improving efficiencies of the inverse\nprobability weighting estimators and the methods can be applied to missing data\nanalysis. Model-based calibration has been proposed in the survey sampling\nliterature, where multidimensional auxiliary variables are first summarized\ninto a predictor function from a working regression model. Usually, one working\nmodel is being proposed for each parameter of interest and results in different\nsets of calibration weights for estimating different parameters. This paper\nconsiders calibration using multiple working regression models for estimating a\nsingle or multiple parameters. Contrary to a common belief that overfitting\nhurts efficiency, we present three rather unexpected results. First, when the\nmissing probability is correctly specified and multiple working regression\nmodels for the conditional mean are posited, calibration enjoys an oracle\nproperty: the same semiparametric efficiency bound is attained as if the true\noutcome model is known in advance. Second, when the missing data mechanism is\nmisspecified, calibration can still be a consistent estimator when any one of\nthe outcome regression models is correctly specified. Third, a common set of\ncalibration weights can be used to improve efficiency in estimating multiple\nparameters of interest and can simultaneously attain semiparametric efficiency\nbounds for all parameters of interest.

At first glance, it seems\nto be bizarre and even ridiculous to apply ideas of quantum physics in order to\nimprove current psychological and linguistic or semantic ideas. However, a\ncloser look shows that there are some parallels in the development of quantum\nphysics and advanced theories of cognitive science. In psychology, geometric\nmodels of meaning have a long tradition. However, they suffer from many\nshortcomings which are illustrated by discussing several puzzles of bounded\nrationality. In the first part of this article, we argue that the present\naccount of quantum cognition - taking quantum probabilities rather than\nclassical probabilities - can give a more systematic description of these\npuzzles than the alternate and rather eclectic treatments in the traditional\nframework of bounded rationality. Unfortunately, the quantum probabilistic\ntreatment does not always and does not automatically provide a deeper\nunderstanding and a true explanation of these puzzles. In the second part of\nthis article, we explain the foundational issue from the perspective of Piron,\nFoulis, Randall, and others, and we apply it to the foundation of quantum\ncognition. In this connection, we show that quantum probabilities are of\n(virtual) conceptual necessity if grounded in an abstract algebraic framework\nof orthomodular lattices. This framework is motivated by assuming partial\nBoolean algebras (describing particular perspectives) that are combined into a\nuniform system while considering certain capacity restrictions.

Kannan,\nM. Naor, S. Rudich, Implicit representation of graphs, SIAM J. Discrete\nMathematics, 5 (1992) 596--603] and can be defined as follows. A representation\nof an $n$-vertex graph $G$ is said to be implicit if it assigns to each vertex\nof $G$ a binary code of length $O(\\log n)$ so that the adjacency of two\nvertices is a function of their codes. Since an implicit representation of an\n$n$-vertex graph uses $O(n\\log n)$ bits, any class of graphs admitting such a\nrepresentation contains $2^{O(n\\log n)}$ labelled graphs with $n$ vertices. In\nthe terminology of [J. Balogh, B. Bollob\\'{a}s, D. Weinreich, The speed of\nhereditary properties of graphs, J. Combin. Theory B 79 (2000) 131--156] such\nclasses have at most factorial speed of growth. In this terminology, the\nimplicit graph conjecture can be stated as follows: every class with at most\nfactorial speed of growth which is hereditary admits an implicit\nrepresentation. The question of deciding whether a given hereditary class has\nat most factorial speed of growth is far from being trivial. In the present\npaper, we introduce a number of tools simplifying this question. Some of them\ncan be used to obtain a stronger conclusion on the existence of an implicit\nrepresentation.

For this, we consider two families of distribution-free test\nstatistics that converge weakly to an extreme value type I distribution. We\nfurther study the powers of the corresponding tests against certain\nalternatives. In particular, we show that the powers tend to one when the\nmaximum magnitude of the pairwise Pearson's correlation coefficients is larger\nthan C(log d/n)^{1/2} for some absolute constant C. This result is rate\noptimal. As important examples, we show that the tests based on Kendall's tau\nand Spearman's rho are rate optimal tests of independence. For further\ngeneralization, we consider accelerating the rate of convergence via\napproximating the exact distributions of the test statistics. We also study the\ntests of two more structural hypotheses: m-dependence and data homogeneity. For\nthese, we propose two rank-based tests and show their optimality.\n","Comment: 45 pages"]}]

The pre-scanning of mobile nodes, along with\npre-authenticating neighbouring access points and pre-reassociation is used to\nreduce the scan delay, authentication delay and re-association delay\nrespectively. The model implements first stage reservation by using prediction\nresults and does second stage reservation based on the packet content type, so\nthat sufficient resources can be reserved when the mobile node does the handoff\nto the next access point. The overall mobility management scheme thus reduces\nthe handoff delay. The performance simulations are done to verify the proposed\nmodel.\n","Comment: 16 pages"]}]
