However, deep sequencing and assembly of all of\nmillions of cells in a sample is prohibitively costly. A property that can come\nto rescue is that deep sequencing of every cell should not be necessary to\ncapture all distinct genomes, as the majority of cells are biological\nreplicates. Biologically important samples are often sparse in that sense. In\nthis paper, we propose an adaptive compressed method, also known as distilled\nsensing, to capture all distinct genomes in a sparse microbial community with\nreduced sequencing effort. As opposed to group testing in which the number of\ndistinct events is often constant and sparsity is equivalent to rarity of an\nevent, sparsity in our case means scarcity of distinct events in comparison to\nthe data size. Previously, we introduced the problem and proposed a distilled\nsensing solution based on the breadth first search strategy. We simulated the\nwhole process which constrained our ability to study the behavior of the\nalgorithm for the entire ensemble due to its computational intensity. In this\npaper, we modify our previous breadth first search strategy and introduce the\ndepth first search strategy. Instead of simulating the entire process, which is\nintractable for a large number of experiments, we provide a dynamic programming\nalgorithm to analyze the behavior of the method for the entire ensemble. The\nensemble analysis algorithm recursively calculates the probability of capturing\nevery distinct genome and also the expected total sequenced nucleotides for a\ngiven population profile. Our results suggest that the expected total sequenced\nnucleotides grows proportional to $\\log$ of the number of cells and\nproportional linearly with the number of distinct genomes.\n"]}]

Since clouds can exert a\ndominant control on planetary radiation balance, rotation rate could be\ncritical for determining mean planetary climate. Here we investigate this idea\nusing a three-dimensional general circulation model with a sophisticated cloud\nscheme. We find that slowly rotating planets (like Venus) can maintain an\nEarth-like climate at nearly twice the stellar flux as rapidly rotating planets\n(like Earth). This suggests that many exoplanets previously believed to be too\nhot may actually be habitable, depending on their rotation rate. The\nexplanation for this behavior is that slowly rotating planets have a weak\nCoriolis force and long daytime illumination, which promotes strong convergence\nand convection in the substellar region. This produces a large area of\noptically thick clouds, which greatly increases the planetary albedo. In\ncontrast, on rapidly rotating planets a much narrower belt of clouds form in\nthe deep tropics, leading to a relatively low albedo. A particularly striking\nexample of the importance of rotation rate suggested by our simulations is that\na planet with modern Earth's atmosphere, in Venus' orbit, and with modern\nVenus' (slow) rotation rate would be habitable.

The central limit theorems (CLT's) for linear spectral statistics of\nhigh-dimensional non-centered sample covariance matrices have received\nconsiderable attention in random matrix theory and have been applied to many\nhigh-dimensional statistical problems. However, known population mean vectors\nare assumed for non-centered sample covariance matrices, some of which even\nassume Gaussian-like moment conditions. In fact, there are still another two\nmost frequently used sample covariance matrices: the MLE (by subtracting the\nsample mean vector from each sample vector) and the unbiased sample covariance\nmatrix (by changing the denominator $n$ as $N=n-1$ in the MLE) without\ndepending on unknown population mean vectors. In this paper, we not only\nestablish new CLT's for non-centered sample covariance matrices without\nGaussian-like moment conditions but also characterize the non-negligible\ndifferences among the CLT's for the three classes of high-dimensional sample\ncovariance matrices by establishing a {\\em substitution principle}: substitute\nthe {\\em adjusted} sample size $N=n-1$ for the actual sample size $n$ in the\nmajor centering term of the new CLT's so as to obtain the CLT of the unbiased\nsample covariance matrices. Moreover, it is found that the difference between\nthe CLT's for the MLE and unbiased sample covariance matrix is non-negligible\nin the major centering term although the two sample covariance matrices only\nhave differences $n$ and $n-1$ on the dominator.

We impose no condition on the growth of the automorphic\nforms at the cusps.\n  For real weights that are not an integer at least 2 we similarly characterize\nthe space of cusp forms and the space of entire automorphic forms. We give a\nrelation between the cohomology classes attached to holomorphic automorphic\nforms of real weight and the existence of harmonic lifts.\n  A tool in establishing these results is the relation to cohomology groups\nwith values in modules of \"analytic boundary germs\", which are represented by\nharmonic functions on subsets of the upper half-plane. Even for positive\nintegral weights cohomology with these coefficients can distinguish all\nholomorphic automorphic forms, unlike the classical Eichler theory.\n","Comment: 150 pages.

Many interesting\nsemantics have been proposed. Brewka and Eiter's Principle I expresses the\nbasic intuition behind the preferences. All the approaches that satisfy\nPrinciple I introduce a rather imperative feature into otherwise declarative\nlanguage. They understand preferences as the order, in which the rules of a\nprogram have to be applied. In this paper we present two purely declarative\napproaches for preference handling that satisfy Principle I, and work for\ngeneral conflicts, including direct and indirect conflicts between rules. The\nfirst approach is based on the idea that a rule cannot be defeated by a less\npreferred conflicting rule. This approach is able to ignore preferences between\nnon-conflicting rules, and, for instance, is equivalent with the answer set\nsemantics for the subclass of stratified programs. It is suitable for the\nscenarios, when developers do not have full control over preferences. The\nsecond approach relaxes the requirement for ignoring conflicting rules, which\nensures that it stays in the NP complexity class. It is based on the idea that\na rule cannot be defeated by a rule that is less preferred or depends on a less\npreferred rule. The second approach can be also characterized by a\ntransformation to logic programs without preferences. It turns out that the\napproaches form a hierarchy, a branch in the hierarchy of the approaches by\nDelgrande et. al., Wang et. al., and Brewka and Eiter.

When applied\nto spins, AC produces ensembles of highly polarized spins, which enhance the\nsignal strength in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). According to this cooling\napproach, spin-half nuclei in a constant magnetic field are considered as bits,\nor more precisely, quantum bits, in a known probability distribution.\nAlgorithmic steps on these bits are then translated into specially designed NMR\npulse sequences using common NMR quantum computation tools. The $algorithmic$\ncooling of spins is achieved by alternately combining reversible,\nentropy-preserving manipulations (borrowed from data compression algorithms)\nwith $selective$ $reset$, the transfer of entropy from selected spins to the\nenvironment. In theory, applying algorithmic cooling to sufficiently large spin\nsystems may produce polarizations far beyond the limits due to conservation of\nShannon entropy.\n  Here, only selective reset steps are performed, hence we prefer to call this\nprocess \"heat-bath\" cooling, rather than algorithmic cooling. We experimentally\nimplement here two consecutive steps of selective reset that transfer entropy\nfrom two selected spins to the environment. We performed such cooling\nexperiments with commercially-available labeled molecules, on standard\nliquid-state NMR spectrometers.

Our central premise is that cancer is an evolving\nsystem subject to mutation and selection, and the primary conduit for these\nprocesses to occur is the cancer cell whose behaviour is regulated on multiple\nbiological scales. The selection pressure is mainly driven by the\nmicroenvironment that the tumour is growing in and this acts directly upon the\ncell phenotype. In turn, the phenotype is driven by the intracellular pathways\nthat are regulated by the genotype.

We will focus on models that use neural networks as\na means of connecting these different biological scales, since they allow us to\neasily create heterogeneity for selection to act upon and importantly this\nheterogeneity can be implemented at different biological scales. More\nspecifically, we consider three different neural networks that bridge different\naspects of these scales and the dialogue with the micro-environment, (i) the\nimpact of the micro-environment on evolutionary dynamics, (ii) the mapping from\ngenotype to phenotype under drug-induced perturbations and (iii) pathway\nactivity in both normal and cancer cells under different micro-environmental\nconditions.\n"]}]

Thus, it constitutes further progress towards an efficient quantum\nalgorithm for simulating the Standard Model of particle physics.\n","Comment: 29 pages"]}]

Atomic force\nmicroscopy reveals a surprisingly sharp and well-defined threshold of potential\nenergy carried into the collision of about 14 keV for hillock formation.\nEstimates of the energy density deposited suggest that the threshold is linked\nto a solid-liquid phase transition (``melting'') on the nanoscale.
