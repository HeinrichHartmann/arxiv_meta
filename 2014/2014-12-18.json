It is known that finding an optimum\nsequential estimator, which minimizes the average sample number for a given\ntarget accuracy level, is an intractable problem with a general stopping rule\nthat depends on the complete observation history. By properly restricting the\nsearch space to stopping rules that depend on a specific subset of the complete\nobservation history, we derive the optimum sequential estimator in the\ncentralized case via optimal stopping theory. However, finding the optimum\nstopping rule in this case requires numerical computations that {\\em\nquadratically} scales with the number of parameters to be estimated. For the\ndecentralized setup with stringent energy constraints, under an alternative\nproblem formulation that is conditional on the observed regressors, we first\nderive a simple optimum scheme whose computational complexity is {\\em constant}\nwith respect to the number of parameters. Then, following this simple optimum\nscheme we propose a decentralized sequential estimator whose computational\ncomplexity and energy consumption scales {\\em linearly} with the number of\nparameters. Specifically, in the proposed decentralized scheme a\nclose-to-optimum average stopping time performance is achieved by infrequently\ntransmitting a single pulse with very short duration.\n"]}]

We develop cellular (co)sheaves as a new\ntool for topological data analysis, network coding and sensor networks. A\nfoundation for multi-dimensional level-set persistent homology is laid via\nconstructible cosheaves, which are equivalent to representations of\nMacPherson's entrance path category.

A cosheaf version of the i'th derived\npushforward of the constant sheaf along a definable map is constructed directly\nas a representation of this category. We go on to clarify the relationship of\ncellular sheaves to cosheaves by providing a formula that defines a derived\nequivalence, which in turn recovers Verdier duality. Compactly-supported sheaf\ncohomology is expressed as the coend with the image of the constant sheaf\nthrough this equivalence. The equivalence is further used to establish\nrelations between sheaf cohomology and a herein newly introduced theory of\ncellular sheaf homology. Inspired to provide fast algorithms for persistence,\nwe prove that the derived category of cellular sheaves over a 1D cell complex\nis equivalent to a category of graded sheaves. Finally, we introduce the\ninterleaving distance as an extended pseudo-metric on the category of sheaves.\nWe prove that global sections partition the space of sheaves into connected\ncomponents.

A brief derivation of the path integral formulation of\nquantum mechanics in its original form using the orthonormal position and\nmomentum basis is reviewed. For spin systems such as single molecule magnets,\nthe formulation of path integral requires the use of non-orthonormal spin\ncoherent state in $(2s+1)$ dimensional Hilbert space, the coordinate\nindependent and the coordinate dependent form of the spin coherent state path\nintegral is derived. These two forms of spin coherent state path integral are\napplied to the tunneling of single molecule magnets through its magnetic\nanisotropy barrier. Most experimental and numerical results are presented. The\nsuppression of tunneling for half-odd integer spin (spin-parity effect) at zero\nmagnetic field is derived from both forms, which shows that this result\n(spin-parity effect) is independent of the coordinate. At nonzero magnetic\nfield we present both the experimental and the theoretical results of the\noscillation of tunneling splitting as a function of the applied magnetic field\napplied along the spin hard anisotropy axis direction.

Small cells enhance the spectrum efficiency and\nthus enlarge the capacity of mobile networks. Although SCBSs consume much less\npower than macro BSs (MBSs) do, the overall power consumption of a large number\nof SCBSs is phenomenal. As the energy harvesting technology advances, base\nstations (BSs) can be powered by green energy to alleviate the on-grid power\nconsumption. For mobile networks with high BS density, traffic load balancing\nis critical in order to exploit the capacity of SCBSs. To fully utilize\nharvested energy, it is desirable to incorporate the green energy utilization\nas a performance metric in traffic load balancing strategies. In this paper, we\nhave proposed a traffic load balancing framework that strives a balance between\nnetwork utilities, e.g., the average traffic delivery latency, and the green\nenergy utilization. Various properties of the proposed framework have been\nderived. Leveraging the software-defined radio access network architecture, the\nproposed scheme is implemented as a virtually distributed algorithm, which\nsignificantly reduces the communication overheads between users and BSs. The\nsimulation results show that the proposed traffic load balancing framework\nenables an adjustable trade-off between the on-grid power consumption and the\naverage traffic delivery latency, and saves a considerable amount of on-grid\npower, e.g., 30%, at a cost of only a small increase, e.g., 8%, of the average\ntraffic delivery latency.\n"]}]

In order\nto reach even higher resolutions before the advent of future high-energy\ncolliders, it is necessary to consider indirect probes of New Physics (NP), a\nprime example being Delta F=2 neutral meson mixing processes, which are\nsensitive to much shorter distance scales. However Delta F=2 processes alone\ncannot tell us much about the structure of NP beyond the LHC scales. To\nidentify for instance the presence of new quark flavour-changing dynamics of a\nleft-handed (LH) or right-handed (RH) nature, complementary results from Delta\nF=1 rare decay processes are vital. We therefore address the important question\nof whether NP could be seen up to energy scales as high as 200 TeV,\ncorresponding to distances as small as 10^{-21}m -- the Zeptouniverse -- in\nrare K and B_{s,d} decays, subject to present Delta F=2 constraints and\nperturbativity. We focus in particular on a heavy Z' gauge boson. If restricted\nto purely LH or RH Z' couplings to quarks, we find that rare K decays, in\nparticular KL-> pi^0 nu nubar and K^+->pi^+ nu nubar, allow us to probe the\nZeptouniverse. On the other hand rare B_s and B_d decays, which receive\nstronger Delta F=2 constraints, allow us to reach about 15 TeV. Allowing for\nboth LH and RH couplings a loosening of the Delta F=2 constraints is possible,\nand we find that the maximal values of M_Z' at which NP effects that are\nconsistent with perturbative couplings could be found are approximately 2000\nTeV for K decays and 160 TeV for rare B_{s,d} decays. Finally we present a\nsimple idea for an indirect determination of M_Z' that could be realised at the\nnext linear e^+e^- or mu^+ mu^- collider and with future precise flavour data.\n","Comment: 43 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables; new section on the role of heavy\n  neutral scalars in reaching Zeptouniverse added; clarifying comments and\n  references added"]}]

Hence, we\nreasonably assume that the goal of a human observer is to rate the distortion\npresent in the test image.

The\nreasons for these are tracked down to the anomalously low atomic p orbital\nenergy in the boron and to the unusually strong s-s repulsion in BAs relative\nto most other III-V compounds. We find unexpected valence band offsets of BAs\nwith respect to GaAs and AlAs. The valence band maximum (VBM) of BAs is\nsignificantly higher than that of AlAs, despite the much smaller bond length of\nBAs, and the VBM of GaAs is only slightly higher than in BAs. These effects\nresult from the unusually strong mixing of the cation and anion states at the\nVBM. For the BAs-GaAs alloys, we find (i) a relatively small (~3.5 eV) and\ncomposition-independent band gap bowing. This means that while addition of\nsmall amounts of nitrogen to GaAs lowers the gap, addition of small amounts of\nboron to GaAs raises the gap (ii) boron ``semi-localized'' states in the\nconduction band (similar to those in GaN-GaAs alloys), and (iii) bulk mixing\nenthalpies which are smaller than in GaN-GaAs alloys. The unique features of\nboride III-V alloys offer new opportunities in band gap engineering.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 14 figures, 6 tables, 61 references. Accepted for\n  publication in Phys. Rev. B.

Such a mass-charge\nduality explains the availability in the neutrino of the naturally united rest\nmass and charge equal to all its mass and charge consisting of the electric,\nweak, strong and the range of other the innate components. From their point of\nview, we discuss a new theory of a grand unification. In this theory, the\ngravitational field is a naturally united field of the unified system of the\nmost diverse combinations of the electric photons, magnetic monophotons, weak\nbosons and the strong gluons where the four pairs of forces of a different\nnature are united. Some consequences and laboratory confirmations of the\ndiscussed theory have been listed, in which graviton is predicted as a grand\nunited gauge boson. Therefore, the gravitons constitute a natural light\ntestifying in favor of gravitational force. They show that to each type of\nlight corresponds a kind of force. Thereby, the suggested field theory that\nunites all gauge bosons in gravitons gives the possibility to directly look on\nthe nature of gravitational matter elucidating the interratio of intragraviton\nforces and the problem of elementary particle fundamental symmetries.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 2 figures, LaTex"]}]
