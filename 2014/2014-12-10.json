A consequence of our results is that for models that are\nrich enough to contain an orthonormal basis, the existence of an L2/L2 instance\noptimal decoder is only possible when the linear operator is not substantially\ndimension-reducing. This covers well-known cases (sparse vectors, low-rank\nmatrices) as well as a number of seemingly new situations (structured sparsity\nand sparse inverse covariance matrices for instance). We exhibit an\noperator-dependent norm which, under a model-specific generalization of the\nRestricted Isometry Property (RIP), always yields a feasible instance\noptimality property. This norm can be upper bounded by an atomic norm relative\nto the considered model.\n","Comment: To appear in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory"]}]

We exploit the ultradeep spectroscopic observations collected by the\nVIMOS Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS) to build an unique, complete and unbiased sample\nof 4000 spectroscopically confirmed star forming galaxies at 2<z<6. Our galaxy\nsample UV luminosities brighter than M* at 2<z<6, and luminosities down to one\nmagnitude fainter than M* at 2<z<3.5. Results. We find that 80% of the star\nforming galaxies in our sample have EW0(Lya)<10A, and correspondingly\nfesc(Lya)<1%. By comparing these results with literature, we conclude that the\nbulk of the Lya luminosity at 2<z<6 comes from galaxies that are fainter in the\nUV than those we sample in this work. The strong Lya emitters constitute, at\neach redshift, the tail of the distribution of the galaxies with extreme\nEW0(Lya) and fesc(Lya) . This tail of large EW0 and fesc(Lya) becomes more\nimportant as the redshift increases, and causes the fraction of Lya with EW0>\n25A to increase from 5% at z=2 to 30% at z=6, with the increase being\nrelatively stronger beyond z=4. We observe no difference, for the narrow range\nof UV luminosities explored in this work, between the fraction of strong Lya\nemitters among galaxies fainter or brighter than M*, although the fraction for\nthe FUV faint galaxies evolves faster, at 2<z<3.5, than for the bright ones.

In particular,\nthe amount of ionised gas and dust has been derived here. Such quantities have\nalso been estimated for the very young PN CRL618, where the strong variability\nobserved in its radio and millimetre emission has previously prevented the\nconstruction of its SED. A morphological study of the Helix Nebula has also\nbeen performed. Planck maps reveal, for the first time, the spatial\ndistribution of the dust inside the envelope, allowing us to identify different\ncomponents, the most interesting of which is a very extended component (up to\n1pc) that may be related to a region where the slow expanding envelope is\ninteracting with the surrounding interstellar medium.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 14 figures; accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

This is important for the planetary mass-radius relation since\nk_gr affects the H/He envelope mass of low-mass planets and the critical core\nmass of giant planets. Aims. The goal of this study is to derive an analytical\nmodel for k_gr. Methods. Our model is based on the comparison of the timescales\nof microphysical processes like grain settling in the Stokes and Epstein\nregime, growth by Brownian motion coagulation and differential settling, grain\nevaporation, and grain advection due to envelope contraction. With these\ntimescales we derive the grain size, abundance, and opacity. Results. We find\nthat the main growth process is differential settling. In this regime, k_gr has\na simple functional form and is given as 27 Q/8 H rho in the Epstein regime and\nas 2 Q/H rho for Stokes drag. Grain dynamics lead to a typical radial structure\nof k_gr with high ISM-like values in the top layers but a strong decrease in\nthe deeper parts where the grain-free molecular opacities take over.\nConclusions. In agreement with earlier results we find that k_gr is typically\nmuch lower than in the ISM. The equations also show that a higher dust input in\nthe top layer does not strongly increase k_gr with two important implications.\nFirst, for a formation of giant planet cores via pebbles, there could be the\nissue that pebbles increase the grain input high in the atmosphere due to\nablation. This could potentially increase k_gr hindering giant planet\nformation. Our study shows that this adverse effect should not occur. Second,\nit means that a higher stellar [Fe/H] which presumably leads to a higher\nsurface density of planetesimals only favors giant planet formation without\nbeing detrimental to it due to an increased k_gr. This corroborates the result\nthat core accretion explains the increase of the giant planet frequency with\n[Fe/H].\n","Comment: 33 pages, 19 figures. Accepted to A&A.

This background is expected to contain unique\ninformation from throughout the history of the universe that is unavailable\nthrough standard electromagnetic observations, making its study of fundamental\nimportance to understanding the evolution of the universe. We carry out a\nsearch for the stochastic background with the latest data from LIGO and Virgo.\nConsistent with predictions from most stochastic gravitational-wave background\nmodels, the data display no evidence of a stochastic gravitational-wave signal.\nAssuming a gravitational-wave spectrum of\nOmega_GW(f)=Omega_alpha*(f/f_ref)^alpha, we place 95% confidence level upper\nlimits on the energy density of the background in each of four frequency bands\nspanning 41.5-1726 Hz. In the frequency band of 41.5-169.25 Hz for a spectral\nindex of alpha=0, we constrain the energy density of the stochastic background\nto be Omega_GW(f)<5.6x10^-6. For the 600-1000 Hz band, Omega_GW(f)<0.14*(f/900\nHz)^3, a factor of 2.5 lower than the best previously reported upper limits. We\nfind Omega_GW(f)<1.8x10^-4 using a spectral index of zero for 170-600 Hz and\nOmega_GW(f)<1.0*(f/1300 Hz)^3 for 1000-1726 Hz, bands in which no previous\ndirect limits have been placed. The limits in these four bands are the lowest\ndirect measurements to date on the stochastic background. We discuss the\nimplications of these results in light of the recent claim by the BICEP2\nexperiment of the possible evidence for inflationary gravitational waves.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 2 figures, 1 table"]}]

Several recent\nexperiments on the electronic structure have shown that the Fermi surface in\nthe hidden order phase is quite close to the result of band-structure\ncalculations within the framework of itinerant electron picture assuming the\nantiferromagnetism. This provides strong evidence for the band folding along\nthe c-axis with the ordering vector of $(0\\,0\\,1)$, corresponding to broken\ntranslational symmetry. In addition to this, there is growing evidence for\nfourfold rotational symmetry breaking in the hidden-order phase from\nmeasurements of the in-plane magnetic anisotropy and the effective mass\nanisotropy in the electronic structure, as well as the orthorhombic lattice\ndistortion. This broken fourfold symmetry gives a stringent constraint that the\nsymmetry of the hidden order parameter should belong to the degenerate $E$-type\nirreducible representation. We also discuss a possibility that time reversal\nsymmetry is also broken, which further narrows down the order parameter that\ncharacterizes the hidden order.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 5 figures.

An apparatus for in-situ measurements of\nthe secondary electron yield (SEY) of samples in the vacuum chamber of the\nCornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) has been developed in connection with EC\nstudies for the CESR Test Accelerator program (CesrTA). The CesrTA in-situ\nsystem, in operation since 2010, allows for SEY measurements as a function of\nincident electron energy and angle on samples that are exposed to the\naccelerator environment, typically 5.3 GeV counter-rotating beams of electrons\nand positrons. The system was designed for periodic measurements to observe\nbeam conditioning of the SEY with discrimination between exposure to direct\nphotons from synchrotron radiation versus scattered photons and cloud\nelectrons. The SEY chambers can be isolated from the CESR beam pipe, allowing\nus to exchange samples without venting the CESR vacuum chamber. Measurements so\nfar have been on metal surfaces and EC-mitigation coatings. The goal of the SEY\nmeasurement program is to improve predictive models for EC build-up and\nEC-induced beam effects.

Using the radiative transfer\ncode CMFGEN, we investigate the recently-reported 15.5 h post-explosion\nspectrum of the type IIb SN 2013cu. For the first time, we are able to directly\nmeasure the chemical abundances of a SN progenitor and find a relatively H-rich\nwind, with H and He abundances (by mass) of X=0.46 +- 0.2 and Y=0.52 +- 0.2,\nrespectively. The wind is enhanced in N and depleted in C relative to solar\nvalues (mass fractions of 8.2e-3 and 1e-5).

To ensure the imaging performance during the\nmirror manufacturing, a fundamental step is predicting the mirror point spread\nfunction (PSF) from the metrology of its surface. Traditionally, the PSF\ncomputation in X-rays is assumed to be different depending on whether the\nsurface defects are classified as figure errors or roughness. [...] The aim of\nthis work is to overcome this limit by providing analytical formulae that are\nvalid at any light wavelength, for computing the PSF of an X-ray mirror shell\nfrom the measured longitudinal profiles and the roughness power spectral\ndensity (PSD), without distinguishing spectral ranges with different\ntreatments. The method we adopted is based on the Huygens-Fresnel principle for\ncomputing the diffracted intensity from measured or modeled profiles. In\nparticular, we have simplified the computation of the surface integral to only\none dimension, owing to the grazing incidence that reduces the influence of the\nazimuthal errors by orders of magnitude. The method can be extended to optical\nsystems with an arbitrary number of reflections - in particular the Wolter-I,\nwhich is frequently used in X-ray astronomy - and can be used in both near- and\nfar-field approximation. Finally, it accounts simultaneously for profile,\nroughness, and aperture diffraction. We describe the formalism with which one\ncan self-consistently compute the PSF of grazing-incidence mirrors, [...]\nFinally, we validate this by comparing the simulated PSF of a real Wolter-I\nmirror shell with the measured PSF in hard X-rays.\n","Comment: Final version with typos corrected"]}]

The source, named MAGIC J2001+439, is detected for the\nfirst time at VHE with MAGIC at a statistical significance of 6.3 {\\sigma} (E >\n70 GeV) during a 1.3-hour long observation on 2010 July 16. The\nmulti-instrument observations show variability in all energy bands with the\nhighest amplitude of variability in the X-ray and VHE bands. We also organized\ndeep imaging optical observations with the Nordic Optical Telescope in 2013 to\ndetermine the source redshift. We determine for the first time the redshift of\nthis BL Lac object through the measurement of its host galaxy during low blazar\nactivity. Using the observational evidence that the luminosities of BL Lac host\ngalaxies are confined to a relatively narrow range, we obtain z = 0.18 +/-\n0.04. Additionally, we use the Fermi-LAT and MAGIC gamma-ray spectra to provide\nan independent redshift estimation, z = 0.17 +/- 0.10. Using the former (more\naccurate) redshift value, we adequately describe the broadband emission with a\none-zone SSC model for different activity states and interpret the few-day\ntimescale variability as produced by changes in the high-energy component of\nthe electron energy distribution.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 15 figures, Accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

Substantial mass depletion and global evolution need to occur to shut\ndown accretion in a protoplanetary disk, even if the disk has inner holes.\nDisks likely follow different evolutionary paths: Low disk masses do not imply\nopening inner holes, and having inner holes does not require low disk masses.\nThe mini-clusters reveal multi-episodic star formation in Tr37. The long\nsurvival of mini-clusters suggest that they formed from the fragmentation of\nthe same core. Their various morphologies favour different formation/triggering\nmechanisms acting within the same cluster.

However, the dissociation mechanism on most\noxide surfaces is not well understood due to the experimental challenges of\npreparing surface structures and characterizing reaction pathways. To remedy\nthis problem, we propose the metal organic framework MOF-74 as an ideal model\nsystem to study water reactions. Its crystalline structure is well\ncharacterized; the metal oxide node mimics surfaces with exposed cations; and\nit degrades in water. Combining in situ IR spectroscopy and first-principles\ncalculations, we explored the MOF-74/water interaction as a function of vapor\npressure and temperature. Here, we show that, while adsorption is reversible\nbelow the water condensation pressure (~19.7 Torr) at room temperature, a\nreaction takes place at ~150 centigrades even at low water vapor pressures.\nThis important finding is unambiguously demonstrated by a clear spectroscopic\nsignature for the direct reaction using D2O, which is not present using H2O due\nto strong phonon coupling. Specifically, a sharp absorption band appears at 970\ncm-1 when D2O is introduced at above 150 centigrades, which we attribute to an\nO-D bending vibration on the phenolate linker. Although H2O undergoes a similar\ndissociation reaction, the corresponding O-H mode is too strongly coupled to\nMOF vibrations to detect. In contrast, the O-D mode falls in the phonon gap of\nthe MOF and remains localized.\n"]}]

Using\nlocal properties of the Trefftz polynomials, we can establish the\nwell-posedness of the resulting discontinuous Galerkin Trefftz method.\nConsistency, stability, and energy dissipation then follow immediately from the\nresults about the abstract framework. The method proposed in this paper\ntherefore shares many of the advantages of more standard discontinuous Galerkin\nmethods, while at the same time, it yields a substantial reduction in the\nnumber of degrees of freedom and the cost for assembling.

As a key establishment primitive, QKD however does not\nprovide a standalone security service in its own: the secret keys established\nby QKD are in general then used by a subsequent cryptographic applications for\nwhich the requirements, the context of use and the security properties can\nvary. It is therefore important, in the perspective of integrating QKD in\nsecurity infrastructures, to analyze how QKD can be combined with other\ncryptographic primitives. The purpose of this survey article, which is mostly\ncentered on European research results, is to contribute to such an analysis. We\nfirst review and compare the properties of the existing key establishment\ntechniques, QKD being one of them. We then study more specifically two generic\nscenarios related to the practical use of QKD in cryptographic infrastructures:\n1) using QKD as a key renewal technique for a symmetric cipher over a\npoint-to-point link; 2) using QKD in a network containing many users with the\nobjective of offering any-to-any key establishment service. We discuss the\nconstraints as well as the potential interest of using QKD in these contexts.\nWe finally give an overview of challenges relative to the development of QKD\ntechnology that also constitute potential avenues for cryptographic research.\n","Comment: Revised version of the SECOQC White Paper.
