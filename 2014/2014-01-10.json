Time scales of\nvariations are estimated by the most common definition of the variability time\nscale and the zero-crossing time of the autocorrelation function of the optical\nlight curves for each source. The measured time scales of variations by the two\nmethods are consistent with each other.

Such light $\\widetilde{\\chi}^0_1$,\n$\\widetilde{\\chi}^0_2$ and $\\widetilde{\\chi}^{\\pm}_1$ states can be almost mass\ndegenerate, and their decays are then difficult to observe at colliders. In\naddition to the generic naturalness argument, light higgsinos are well\nmotivated from a top-down perspective. For instance, they arise naturally in\ncertain models of hybrid gauge-gravity mediation. In the present analysis, we\nstudy two benchmark points which have been derived in the framework of such a\nmodel, which exhibit mass differences of O(GeV) in the higgsino sector. For\nchargino pair and neutralino associated production with initial-state photon\nradiation, we simulate the detector response and determine how accurately the\nsmall mass differences, the absolute masses and the cross sections can be\nmeasured at the International Linear Collider. Assuming that 500/fb has been\ncollected at each of two beam-polarisations $P(e^+,e^-)=(\\pm 30\\%,\\mp 80\\%)$,\nwe find that the mass differences can be measured to 40-300 MeV, the cross\nsections to 2-5%, and the absolute masses to 1.5-3.3 GeV, where the range of\nvalues correspond to the different scenarios and channels. Based on these\nobservables we perform a parameter fit in the MSSM, from which we infer that\nthe higgsino mass parameter $\\mu$ can be measured to a precision of about\n$\\Delta\\mu=$2--7 GeV. For the electroweak gaugino mass parameters $M_1$, $M_2$,\nwhich are chosen in the multi-TeV range, a narrow region is compatible with the\nmeasurements.

Instead of using the conventional power-series\ndescription of the non-singular part of the Laurent expansion, we represent\nthis part by a convergent series of Pietarinen functions. As the analytic\nstructure of the non-singular part is usually very well known (physical cuts\nwith branch points at inelastic thresholds, and unphysical cuts in the negative\nenergy plane), we find that one Pietarinen series per cut represents the\nanalytic structure fairly reliably. The number of terms in each Pietarinen\nseries is determined by the quality of the fit. The method is tested in two\nways: on a toy model constructed from two known poles, various background\nterms, and two physical cuts, and on several sets of realistic piN elastic\nenergy-dependent partial-wave amplitudes (GWU/SAID - [1, 2], and\nDubna-Mainz-Taipei - [3, 4]).

On the other hand, as particles become larger their inertia affects\ntheir motions, and they move differently than the air. These inertial dynamics\nimpact cloud evolution and ultimately climate prediction, since clouds govern\nthe earth's energy balances. Yet we lack a simple description of the dynamics.\nFalkovich et al. describes theoretically a new dynamical mechanism called the\n\"sling effect\" by which extreme events in the turbulent air cause idealized\ninertial cloud particles to break free from the airflow (Falkovich G, Fouxon A,\nStepanov MG 2002 Nature 419, 151). The sling effect thereafter causes particle\ntrajectories to cross each other within isolated pockets in the flow, which\nincreases the chance of collisions that form larger particles. We combined\nexperimental techniques that allow for precise control of a turbulent flow with\nthree-dimensional tracking of multiple particles at unprecedented resolution.\nIn this way, we could observe both the sling effect and crossing trajectories\nbetween real particles. We isolated the inertial sling dynamics from those\ncaused by turbulent advection by conditionally averaging the data. We found the\ndynamics to be universal in terms of a local Stokes number that quantifies the\nlocal particle velocity gradients. We measured the probability density of this\nquantity, which shows that sharp gradients become more frequent as the global\nStokes number increases. We observed that sharp compressive gradients in the\nairflow initiated the sling effect, and that thereafter gradients in the\nparticle flow ran away and steepened in a way that produced singularities in\nthe flow in finite time.

In particular, two very important\nissues that may limit the application of green networking techniques concern,\nrespectively, network survivability, i.e. the network capability to react to\ndevice failures, and robustness to traffic variations. We propose novel\nmodelling techniques to minimize the daily energy consumption of IP networks,\nwhile explicitly guaranteeing, in addition to typical QoS requirements, both\nnetwork survivability and robustness to traffic variations. The impact of such\nlimitations on final network consumption is exhaustively investigated. Daily\ntraffic variations are modelled by dividing a single day into multiple time\nintervals (multi-period problem), and network consumption is reduced by putting\nto sleep idle line cards and chassis. To preserve network resiliency we\nconsider two different protection schemes, i.e. dedicated and shared\nprotection, according to which a backup path is assigned to each demand and a\ncertain amount of spare capacity has to be available on each link. Robustness\nto traffic variations is provided by means of a specific modelling framework\nthat allows to tune the conservatism degree of the solutions and to take into\naccount load variations of different magnitude. Furthermore, we impose some\ninter-period constraints necessary to guarantee network stability and preserve\nthe device lifetime. Both exact and heuristic methods are proposed.\nExperimentations carried out with realistic networks operated with flow-based\nrouting protocols (i.e. MPLS) show that significant savings, up to 30%, can be\nachieved also when both survivability and robustness are fully guaranteed.\n"]}]

These unknown frailty terms with their imposed distribution are\nused to express the association between the different individuals in a cluster.\nCopula models on the other hand assume that the joint survival function of the\nindividuals within a cluster is given by a copula function, evaluated in the\nmarginal survival function of each individual. It is the copula function which\ndescribes the association between the lifetimes within a cluster. A major\ndisadvantage of the present copula models over the frailty models is that the\nsize of the different clusters must be small and equal in order to set up\nmanageable estimation procedures for the different model parameters. We\ndescribe in this manuscript a copula model for clustered survival data where\nthe clusters are allowed to be moderate to large and varying in size by\nconsidering the class of Archimedean copulas with completely monotone\ngenerator. We develop both one- and two-stage estimators for the different\ncopula parameters. Furthermore we show the consistency and asymptotic normality\nof these estimators. Finally, we perform a simulation study to investigate the\nfinite sample properties of the estimators. We illustrate the method on a data\nset containing the time to first insemination in cows, with cows clustered in\nherds.\n"]}]

Particular attention is paid to the\ncoherence, or correlation, length associated with these transitions in the\nRFOT.

In this work, we investigate\nthe characteristics of the node degree distributions constructed by using HVG,\nfor time series corresponding to $28$ chaotic maps and $3$ different stochastic\nprocesses. We thoroughly study the methodology proposed by Lacasa and Toral\nfinding several cases for which their hypothesis is not valid. We propose a\nmethodology that uses the HVG together with Information Theory quantifiers. An\nextensive and careful analysis of the node degree distributions obtained by\napplying HVG allow us to conclude that the Fisher-Shannon information plane is\na remarkable tool able to graphically represent the different nature,\ndeterministic or stochastic, of the systems under study.\n","Comment: Submitted to PLOS One"]}]
