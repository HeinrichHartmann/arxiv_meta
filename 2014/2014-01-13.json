Channel hardening refers\nto the phenomenon where the off-diagonal terms of the ${\\bf H}^H{\\bf H}$ matrix\nbecome increasingly weaker compared to the diagonal terms as the size of the\nchannel gain matrix ${\\bf H}$ increases. Specifically, we propose a message\npassing detection (MPD) algorithm which works with the real-valued matched\nfiltered received vector (whose signal term becomes ${\\bf H}^T{\\bf H}{\\bf x}$,\nwhere ${\\bf x}$ is the transmitted vector), and uses a Gaussian approximation\non the off-diagonal terms of the ${\\bf H}^T{\\bf H}$ matrix. We also propose a\nsimple estimation scheme which directly obtains an estimate of ${\\bf H}^T{\\bf\nH}$ (instead of an estimate of ${\\bf H}$), which is used as an effective\nchannel estimate in the MPD algorithm. We refer to this receiver as the {\\em\nchannel hardening-exploiting message passing (CHEMP)} receiver. The proposed\nCHEMP receiver achieves very good performance in large-scale MIMO systems\n(e.g., in systems with 16 to 128 uplink users and 128 base station antennas).\nFor the considered large MIMO settings, the complexity of the proposed MPD\nalgorithm is almost the same as or less than that of the minimum mean square\nerror (MMSE) detection. This is because the MPD algorithm does not need a\nmatrix inversion. It also achieves a significantly better performance compared\nto MMSE and other message passing detection algorithms using MMSE estimate of\n${\\bf H}$. We also present a convergence analysis of the proposed MPD\nalgorithm.

Due to the reduced mass, in\nMicroBooNE the anti-neutrino signal is too weak for a sensitive comparison.\nHence, a definitive clarification of the LSND anomaly requires the exploration\nof the anti-neutrino signal provided by the much larger T600.

The basic principle is\nto ignite a plasma using argon, and then to introduce a small additional\nnitrogen flow to achieve the nitridation of a Nb target. Subsequent sputtering\nleads to the deposition of NbN onto the host substrate. The characteristics of\na sputtered film depend on a number of parameters: argon pressure, nitrogen\nflow rate and time-evolution profile, substrate material, etc. Crucially, the\nhysteresis in the target voltage as a function of the nitrogen flow can be used\nto provide a highly effective monitor of nitrogen consumption during the\nreactive process. By studying these dependencies we have been able to achieve\nhighly reproducible film characteristics on sapphire, silicon dioxide on\nsilicon, and silicon nitride on silicon.

Thus, the automatic negotiation of\nService Level Agreements (SLAs) between consumers and providers is key for\nenabling service-based value chains.\n  The process of finding appropriate providers for web services seems to be\nsimple. Consumers contact several providers and take the provider which offers\nthe best matching SLA. However, currently consumers are not able forecasting\nthe probability of finding a matching provider for their requested SLA. So\nconsumers contact several providers and check if their offers are matching. In\ncase of continuing faults, on the one hand consumers may adapt their Service\nLevel Objects (SLOs) of the required SLA or on the other hand simply accept\noffered SLAs of the contacted providers.\n  By forecasting the probability of finding a matching provider, consumers\ncould assess their chances of finding a provider offering the requested SLA. If\na low probability is predicted, consumers can immediately adapt their SLOs or\nincrease the numbers of providers to be contacted.\n  Thus, this paper proposes an analytical forecast model, which allows\nconsumers to get a realistic assessment of the probability to find matching\nproviders. Additionally, we present an optimization algorithm based on the\nforecast results, which allows adapting the SLO parameter ranges in order to\nfind at least one matching provider. Not only consumers, but also providers can\nuse this forecast model to predict the prospective demand. So providers are\nable to assess the number of potential consumers based on their offers too.\n  Justification of our approach is done by simulation of practical examples\nchecking our theoretical findings.\n","Comment: Conference submission, not published yet"]}]

Quantitative models for conversion of kerogen into oil and gas and\nthe timing of hydrocarbon generation have been well documented. However, lack\nof consensus about the kinetics of hydrocarbon formation in source rocks,\nexpulsion timing and how the resulting hydrocarbons escape from or are retained\nin the source rocks motivates further investigation. In particular, many\nmechanisms for the transport of hydrocarbons from the source rocks in which\nthey are generated into adjacent rocks with higher permeabilities and smaller\ncapillary entry pressures have been proposed, and a better understanding of\nthis complex process (primary migration) is needed. To characterize these\nprocesses it is imperative to use the latest technological advances. In this\nstudy, it is shown how insights into hydrocarbon migration in source rocks can\nbe obtained by using sequential high resolution synchrotron X-ray tomography.\nThree-dimensional (3D) images of several immature \"shale\" samples were\nconstructed at resolutions close to 5 micrometers. This is sufficient to\nresolve the source rock structure down to the grain level, but very fine\ngrained silt particles, clay particles and colloids cannot be resolved. Samples\nused in this investigation came from the R-8 unit in the upper part of the\nGreen River Shale, which is organic rich, varved, lacustrine marl formed in\nEocene Lake Uinta, United States of America. One Green River Shale sample was\nheated in-situ up to 400{\\deg}C as X-ray tomography images were recorded. The\nother samples were scanned before and after heating at 400{\\deg}C. During the\nheating phase, the organic matter was decomposed, and gas was released. Gas\nexpulsion from the low permeability shales was coupled with formation of\nmicrocracks. The main technical difficulty was numerical extraction of\nmicrocracks that have apertures in the 5 to 30 micrometer range (with 5\nmicrometers being the resolution limit) from a large 3D volume of X-ray\nattenuation data. The main goal of the work presented here is to develop a\nmethodology to process these 3D data and image the cracks. This methodology is\nbased on several levels of spatial filtering and automatic recognition of\nconnected domains. Supportive petrographic and thermogravimetric data were an\nimportant complement to this study. An investigation of the strain field using\ntwo-dimensional image correlation analyses was also performed. As one\napplication of the four-dimensional (4D, space + time) microtomography and the\ndeveloped workflow, we show that fluid generation was accompanied by crack\nformation. Under different conditions, in the subsurface, this might provide\npaths for primary migration.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 10 figures"]}]
