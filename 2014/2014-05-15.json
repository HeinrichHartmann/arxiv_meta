The\ntime-dependent, \"plus\" and \"cross\" polarizations are expanded in Bessel\nfunctions, which are then self-consistently re-expanded in a power series about\nzero initial eccentricity to eighth order. The stationary phase approximation\nis then employed to obtain explicit analytic expressions for the Fourier\ntransform of the post-circular expanded, time-domain signal. We exemplify this\nframework by considering Newtonian-accurate waveforms, which in the\npost-circular scheme give rise to higher harmonics of the orbital phase and\namplitude corrections both to the amplitude and the phase of the Fourier domain\nwaveform. Such higher harmonics lead to an effective increase in the inspiral\nmass reach of a detector as a function of the binary's eccentricity e_0 at the\ntime when the binary enters the detector sensitivity band. Using the largest\ninitial eccentricity allowed by our approximations (e_0 < 0.4), the mass reach\nis found to be enhanced up to factors of approximately 5 relative to that of\ncircular binaries for Advanced LIGO, LISA, and the proposed Einstein Telescope\nat a signal-to-noise ratio of ten.

The most effective method to look for a signal with a\nwell understood waveform, such as the binary black hole signal, is matched\nfiltering against a library of model waveforms. Current model waveforms are\ncomprised solely of the dominant radiation mode, the quadrupole mode, although\nit is known that there can be significant power in the higher-order modes.

In this paper,\nwe investigate the degree to which gravitational-wave searches could be\nimproved by the inclusion of higher modes in the model waveforms, for signals\nwith a variety of initial mass ratios and generic spins.

There is a corresponding 30% increase in detection volume\nthat could be achieved by adding higher modes to the search; however, this is\nmitigated by the fact that the mismatch is largest for signals which radiate\nthe least energy and to which the search is therefore least sensitive.\nLikewise, the mismatch is largest in directions from the source along which the\nleast energy is radiated.\n"]}]

While it is found that AWs\ndissipate quickly in the ABC field, surprisingly, AW perturbation energy\nincreases in time. In the case of the harmonic AW perturbation energy growth is\ntransient in time, attaining peaks in both velocity and magnetic perturbation\nenergies within timescales much smaller than resistive time. In the case of the\nGaussian AW pulse velocity perturbation energy growth is still transient in\ntime, attaining a peak within few resistive times, while magnetic perturbation\nenergy continues to grow. It is also shown that the total magnetic energy\ndecreases in time and this is governed by the resistive evolution of the\nbackground ABC magnetic field rather than AW damping. On contrary, when\nbackground magnetic field is uniform, the total magnetic energy decrease is\nprescribed by AW damping, because there is no resistive evolution of the\nbackground. By considering runs with different amplitudes and by analysing\nperturbation spectra, possible dynamo action by AW perturbation-induced\nperistaltic flow and inverse cascade of magnetic energy have been excluded.\nTherefore, the perturbation energy growth is attributed to a new instability.\nThe growth rate appears to be dependent on the value of the resistivity and\nspatial scale of the AW disturbance. Thus, when going beyond WKB approximation,\nAW damping, described by full MHD equations, does not guarantee decrease of\nperturbation energy.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Phys.

Moreover, our answer is\ncompletely machine-independent and based over a standard notion in the theory\nof $\\lambda$-calculus: the length of a leftmost-outermost derivation to normal\nform is an invariant cost model. Such a theorem cannot be proved by directly\nrelating $\\lambda$-calculus with Turing machines or random access machines,\nbecause of the size explosion problem: there are terms that in a linear number\nof steps produce an exponentially long output. The first step towards the\nsolution is to shift to a notion of evaluation for which the length and the\nsize of the output are linearly related. This is done by adopting the linear\nsubstitution calculus (LSC), a calculus of explicit substitutions modelled\nafter linear logic and proof-nets and admitting a decomposition of\nleftmost-outermost derivations with the desired property. Thus, the LSC is\ninvariant with respect to, say, random access machines. The second step is to\nshow that LSC is invariant with respect to the $\\lambda$-calculus.

By\ncomputing the average Dopplershift, we derive a new temperature diagnostic for\ncoronal loops: the temperature at which the average Dopplershift vanishes is\nthe mean temperature along the coronal loop. In addition, the temperature\nestimate at the footpoints of the loop when the average Dopplershift vanishes\nis a lower bound of the temperature along the loop. To compare closely with\nobservations, we thus model typical Hinode/EIS rasters with a spatial\nresolution of 1\", an exposure time of 50s and a step of 3\".

The refractive index profile\nautomatically defines a scattering potential, but with a significant difference\ncompared to the standard quantum mechanical form: the potential is k-dependent.\nA consequence of this is that there are no bound states for this system. The\ncorrespondences between the resonant modes in scattering by a potential of the\nwell-barrier type and the behavior of electromagnetic rays in a transparent (or\ndielectric) sphere are discussed. The poles and saddle points of the associated\nscattering matrix have quite profound connections to electromagnetic tunneling,\nresonances and bows arising within and from the sphere.

Here we describe the real world structure\nemergence and dynamics as manifestation of the universal symmetry of complexity\nof initially homogeneous interaction between two protofields. It provides the\nunified complex-dynamic, causally complete origin of physically real, 3D space,\ntime, elementary particles, their properties (mass, charge, spin, etc.),\nquantum, relativistic, and classical behaviour, as well as fundamental\ninteraction forces, including naturally quantized gravitation. The old and new\ncosmological problems (including \"dark\" mass and energy) are basically solved\nfor this explicitly emerging, self-tuning world structure characterised by\nstrictly positive (and large) energy-complexity. A general relation is obtained\nbetween the numbers of world dimensions and fundamental forces, excluding\nplausible existence of hidden dimensions. The unified, causally explained\nquantum, classical, and relativistic properties (and types of behaviour) are\ngeneralised to all higher levels of complex world dynamics. The real world\nstructure, dynamics, and evolution are exactly reproduced by the probabilistic\ndynamical fractal, which is obtained as the truly complete general solution of\na problem and the unique structure of the new mathematics of complexity. We\noutline particular, problem-solving applications of always exact, but\nirregularly structured symmetry of unreduced dynamic complexity to microworld\ndynamics, including particle physics, genuine quantum chaos, real\nnanobiotechnology, and reliable genomics.\n","Comment: 46 pages, 64 eqs, 44 refs; Report at the Sixth Conference \"Symmetry\n  in Nonlinear Mathematical Physics\" (Kiev, 20-26 June 2005),\n  http://www.imath.kiev.ua/~appmath/Abstracts2005/Kirilyuk.html; Russian\n  translation is published in Nanosystems, Nanomaterials, Nanotechnologies\n  11(3) (2013) 437-517, see\n  http://www.imp.kiev.ua/nanosys/en/articles/2013/3/nano_vol11_iss3_p0437p0517_2013_abstract.html"]}]
