In this paper, we study diversity multiplexing\ntradeoff for both FDD and TDD systems, when both receiver and transmitter\nknowledge about the channel is noisy and potentially mismatched. For FDD\nsystems, we first extend the achievable tradeoff region for 1.5 rounds of\nmessage passing to get higher diversity compared to the best known scheme, in\nthe regime of higher multiplexing gains. We then break the mold of all current\nchannel state based protocols by using multiple rounds of conferencing to\nextract more bits about the actual channel.

The\nprotocols are on-demand in nature, using high powers for training and feedback\nonly when the channel is in poor states. The key result is that the diversity\nmultiplexing tradeoff with perfect training and K levels of perfect feedback\ncan be achieved, even when there are errors in training the receiver and errors\nin the feedback link, with a multi-round protocol which has K rounds of\ntraining and K-1 rounds of binary feedback.

In this paper, we characterize the impact\nof distributed decisions on the global network performance in terms of\nachievable sum-rates. We first formalize the concept of local view by proposing\na protocol abstraction using the concept of local message passing. In the\nproposed protocol, nodes forward information about the network state to other\nneighboring nodes, thereby allowing network state information to trickle to all\nthe nodes. The protocol proceeds in rounds, where all transmitters send a\nmessage followed by a message by all receivers. The number of rounds then\nprovides a natural metric to quantify the extent of local information at each\nnode.\n  We next study three network connectivities, Z-channel, a three-user double\nZ-channel and a reduced-parametrization $K$-user stacked Z-channel. In each\ncase, we characterize achievable sum-rate with partial message passing leading\nto three main results. First, in many cases, nodes can make distributed\ndecisions with only local information about the network and can still achieve\nthe same sum-capacity as can be attained with global information irrespective\nof the actual channel gains. Second, for the case of three-user double\nZ-channel, we show that universal optimality is not achievable if the per node\ninformation is below a threshold.

For\nexample, Tambara's theorem states that the category of finite polynomial\nfunctors is the Lawvere theory for commutative semirings.

An attractive feature of this theory is that with the correct\nhomotopical approach - homotopy slices, homotopy pullbacks, homotopy colimits,\netc. - the groupoid case looks exactly like the set case. After some standard\nexamples, I will illustrate the notion of data-types-with-symmetries with\nexamples from quantum field theory, where the symmetries of complicated tree\nstructures of graphs play a crucial role, and can be handled elegantly using\npolynomial functors over groupoids.

In previous studies, the control of\nresistance of organic spin valves is generally achieved by the alignment of the\nmagnetization directions of the two ferromagnetic electrodes, generating\nmagnetoresistance.1 Here we employ a new knob to tune the resistance of organic\nspin valves by adding a thin ferroelectric interfacial layer between the\nferromagnetic electrode and the organic spacer.

This new tunability can be understood in\nterms of the change of relative energy level alignment between ferromagnetic\nelectrode and the organic spacer caused by the electric dipole moment of the\nferroelectric layer.

I hypothesize that\nPlasmodium falciparum has an Achilles' heel that can be attacked with\nerythritol, the well-known sweetener that is classified as generally safe. Most\norganisms have in their cell membrane two types of water-channel proteins:\naquaporins to maintain hydro-homeostasis across the membrane and\naquaglyceroporins to uptake glycerols etc. In contrast, P. falciparum has only\none type of such proteins---the multi-functional aquaglyceroporin (PfAQP)\nexpressed in the PPM---to do both jobs. Moreover, the parasite also uses PfAQP\nto excrete its metabolic wastes (ammonia included) produced at a very high rate\nin the blood stage. This extremely high efficiency of the bug using one protein\nfor multiple essential tasks makes the parasite fatally vulnerable. Erythritol\nin the blood stream can kill the parasite by clogging up its PfAQP channel that\nneeds to be open for maintaining hydro-homeostasis and for excreting toxic\nwastes across the bug's PPM. In vitro tests are to measure the growth/death\nrate of P. falciparum in blood with various erythritol concentrations. In vivo\nexperiments are to administer groups of infected mice with various doses of\nerythritol and monitor the parasite growth levels from blood samples drawn from\neach group.

A combination of random and correlated deposition\nis modeled by performing random walks of length $N$ from randomly selected\ninitial sites, the balance between the two processes being determined by $N$.\nWe found that the dependence of bulk modulus, $B(N,c)$, on both $N$ and the\nfraction of stiff springs, $c$, can be described by a strikingly simple set of\nempirical equations.\n  Our results suggest that the spatial correlation of collagen deposition in\nthe fibrotic lung has a strong effect on the rate of lung function decline and\non the mechanical environment in which the cells responsible for remodeling\nfind themselves.\n"]}]

For sources dominated by cosmic\nray-induced ionization (e.g., W49B), the ionization profiles can be used in the\nfuture to map the spatial structure of hadronic gamma rays and\nrotation-vibrational lines induced by cosmic ray protons, helping to identify\nsources of hadronic cosmic rays.\n","Comment: published in Astronomy and Astrophysics, 20 pages, 17 figures"]}]

We find that $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$\ntakes discrete values between $0.188$ and $0.220$ in the standard model plus\nthree right-handed neutrinos, depending on whether the decay into heavier\nright-handed neutrinos are kinematically accessible or not.

Here we explore the\neffect of lattice distortions on the formation of the collective spin-orbital\nstates which include not only conventionally ordered phases but also gapped and\ngapless spin-orbital liquids. In particular, we demonstrate that in the\npresence of spatial anisotropies of the exchange couplings conventionally\nordered states are formed through an order-by-disorder selection which is not\nonly sensitive to the type of exchange anisotropy but also to the relative\nstrength of the Heisenberg and Kitaev couplings. The spin-orbital liquid phases\nof the Kitaev limit -- a gapless phase in the vicinity of spatially isotropic\ncouplings and a gapped Z$_2$ phase for a dominant spatial anisotropy of the\nexchange couplings -- show vastly different sensitivities to the inclusion of a\nHeisenberg exchange. While the gapless phase is remarkably stable, the gapped\nZ$_2$ phase quickly breaks down in what might be a rather unconventional phase\ntransition driven by the simultaneous condensation of its elementary\nexcitations.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 19 figures"]}]

Rather than obfuscating network\nidentity through higher level protocols, we propose a more direct solution: a\nrouting protocol that allows communication without exposing network identity,\nproviding a strong foundation for Internet privacy, while allowing identity to\nbe defined in those higher level protocols where it adds value.\n  Given current research initiatives advocating \"clean slate\" Internet designs,\nan opportunity exists to design an internetwork layer routing protocol that\ndecouples identity from network location and thereby simplifies the anonymity\nproblem. Recently, Hsiao et al. proposed such a protocol (LAP), but it does not\nprotect the user against a local eavesdropper or an untrusted ISP, which will\nnot be acceptable for many users. Thus, we propose Dovetail, a next-generation\nInternet routing protocol that provides anonymity against an active attacker\nlocated at any single point within the network, including the user's ISP. A\nmajor design challenge is to provide this protection without including an\napplication-layer proxy in data transmission. We address this challenge in path\nconstruction by using a matchmaker node (an end host) to overlap two path\nsegments at a dovetail node (a router). The dovetail then trims away part of\nthe path so that data transmission bypasses the matchmaker. Additional design\nfeatures include the choice of many different paths through the network and the\njoining of path segments without requiring a trusted third party. We develop a\nsystematic mechanism to measure the topological anonymity of our designs, and\nwe demonstrate the privacy and efficiency of our proposal by simulation, using\na model of the complete Internet at the AS-level.\n"]}]

Classical robust procedures\nwere designed to cope with this setting and the impact of observations were\nlimited whenever necessary.

In the proposed model, the network state consists of flows and\nactivation status of the links. Network dynamics is determined by a, possibly\nstate-dependent and adversarial, disturbance process that reduces flow capacity\non the links, and routing policies at the nodes that have access to the network\nstate, but are oblivious to the presence of disturbance. Under the proposed\ndynamics, a link becomes irreversibly inactive either due to overload condition\non itself or on all of its immediate downstream links. The coupling between\nlink activation and flow dynamics implies that links to become inactive\nsuccessively are not necessarily adjacent to each other, and hence the pattern\nof cascading failure under our model is qualitatively different than standard\ncascade models. The magnitude of a disturbance process is defined as the sum of\ncumulative capacity reductions across time and links of the network, and the\nmargin of resilience of the network is defined as the infimum over the\nmagnitude of all disturbance processes under which the links at the origin node\nbecome inactive. We propose an algorithm to compute an upper bound on the\nmargin of resilience for the setting where the routing policy only has access\nto information about the local state of the network. For the limiting case when\nthe routing policies update their action as fast as network dynamics, we\nidentify sufficient conditions on network parameters under which the upper\nbound is tight under an appropriate routing policy.

Despite\nintensive experimental and theoretical study, it has remained unclear the\nextent to which the hydrodynamic flows generated by swimming cells, rather than\npurely steric interactions between them, drive the self-organization. Here we\nutilize the recent discovery of a spiral-vortex state in confined suspensions\nof \\textit{B. subtilis} to study this issue in detail. Those experiments showed\nthat if the radius of confinement in a thin cylindrical chamber is below a\ncritical value the suspension will spontaneously form a steady single-vortex\nstate encircled by a counter-rotating cell boundary layer, with spiral cell\norientation within the vortex. Left unclear, however, was the flagellar\norientation, and hence the cell swimming direction, within the spiral vortex.\nHere, using a fast simulation method that captures oriented cell-cell and\ncell-fluid interactions in a minimal model of discrete-particle systems, we\npredict the striking, counterintuitive result that in the presence of\ncollectively-generated fluid motion the cells within the spiral vortex actually\nswim upstream against those flows.
