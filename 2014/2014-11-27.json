In a noncollinear local Andreev\nreflection, the spin polarizations of the injected and the retro-reflected\ncarriers are typically at an angle which is tunable via system parameters.\nWhile in a nonlocal transport, this noncollinearity enables us to identify and\nblock, at different voltage configurations, the noncollinear cross Andreev\nreflection and the direct charge transfer processes. We demonstrate that the\nintriguing noncollinearity originates from the spin-dependent coupling between\ncarriers in the lead and the lowest discrete states in the wire, which, for a\ntopological superconducting nanowire, are related to the overlap-induced\nhybridization of Majorana edge states in a finite system. These interesting\nphenomena can be observed in semiconductor nanowires of experimentally relevant\nlengths, and are potentially useful for spintronics.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures.

A novel ingredient is that such a Fermi surface encloses a Weyl\npoint with definite chirality, referred to as a chiral Fermi surface, which can\narise from breaking of either time reversal or inversion symmetry in systems\nwith strong spin-orbit coupling, responsible for both Berry curvature and\nchiral anomaly. As a result, electromagnetic properties of the Weyl metallic\nstate are described not by conventional Maxwell equations but by axion\nelectrodynamics, where Maxwell equations are modified with a\ntopological-in-origin spatially modulated $\\theta(\\bm{r}) \\bm{E} \\cdot \\bm{B}$\nterm.

However,\nbecause of the highly multi-dimensional nature of the PEL it is hard to\ndetermine, or even visualize, the actual details of the energy landscape. In\nthis article we introduce a modified concept of the local energy landscape\n(LEL) which is limited in phase space, and demonstrate its usefulness using\nmolecular dynamics simulation on a simple liquid at high temperatures. The\nlocal energy landscape is given as a function of the local coordination number,\nthe number of the nearest neighbor atoms.

Our motivation is an effective analysis of the finite-length\nbehavior of polar codes, and the assumption of $q$ being prime is necessary.\nFor $X$ supported on infinite groups without a finite subgroup and no\nconditioning, a sumset inequality for the absolute increase in (unnormalized)\nentropy was shown by Tao (2010).\n  We use our sumset inequality to analyze Ar{\\i}kan's construction of polar\ncodes and prove that for any $q$-ary source $X$, where $q$ is any fixed prime,\nand any $\\epsilon > 0$, polar codes allow {\\em efficient} data compression of\n$N$ i.i.d. copies of $X$ into $(H(X)+\\epsilon)N$ $q$-ary symbols, as soon as\n$N$ is polynomially large in $1/\\epsilon$. We can get capacity-achieving source\ncodes with similar guarantees for composite alphabets, by factoring $q$ into\nprimes and combining different polar codes for each prime in factorization.\n  A consequence of our result for noisy channel coding is that for {\\em all}\ndiscrete memoryless channels, there are explicit codes enabling reliable\ncommunication within $\\epsilon > 0$ of the symmetric Shannon capacity for a\nblock length and decoding complexity bounded by a polynomial in $1/\\epsilon$.\nThe result was previously shown for the special case of binary input channels\n(Guruswami-Xia '13 and Hassani-Alishahi-Urbanke '13), and this work extends the\nresult to channels over any alphabet.\n"]}]

This method is based on the use of the modified Dirac equations for the\nparticles wave functions, in which the correspondent effective potentials that\naccount for the matter influence on particles are included. The developed\napproach establishes a basis for investigation of different phenomena which can\narise when neutrinos and electrons move in dense media, including those\npeculiar for astrophysical and cosmological environments. The approach\ndeveloped is similar to the Furry representation of quantum electrodynamics,\nwidely used for description of particles interactions in the presence of\nexternal electromagnetic fields, and it works when a macroscopic amount of the\nbackground particles are confined within the scale of a neutrino or electron de\nBroglie wave lengths. We consider the modified Dirac equations for neutrinos\n(of both Dirac and Majorana types) and electrons having the standard model\ninteractions with the background matter, however generalization to extensions\nof the standard model is just straightforward. To illustrate how the developed\nmethod works, we elaborate the quantum theories of the spin light of neutrino\n($SL\\nu$) and spin light of electron ($SLe$) in matter.\n","Comment: 22 pages in LaTex, 2 figures"]}]
