The model has attracted attention in recent years because it\ncaptures eavesdropping attack in wireless communication. The wiretap adversary\nis a passive eavesdropping adversary at the physical layer of communication.

AWTP codes provide secrecy and\nreliability for communication over these channels. We give security and\nreliability definitions and measures for these codes, and define secrecy\ncapacity of an AWTP channel that represents the secrecy potential of the\nchannel. The paper has two main contributions.

PSAM characteristics of an electric field (intensity)\nare compactly described by the Jones (Stokes/Mueller) calculus.

Methods. I derive the\nPTAM calculi of electric fields and intensities by combining the POAM and PSAM\ncalculi. I show how these quantities propagate from celestial sphere to image\nplane.

Our aim is to assess whether they have completed their\nmass growth at their redshift or significant mass and/or size growth can or\nmust take place until z=0 in order to understand whether elliptical galaxies of\nclusters follow the observed size evolution of passive galaxies. To compare our\ndata with the local universe we considered the Kormendy relation derived from\nthe early-type galaxies of a local Coma Cluster reference sample and the WINGS\nsurvey sample. The comparison with the local Kormendy relation shows that the\nluminosity evolution due to the aging of the stellar content already assembled\nat z=1.27 brings them on the local relation. Moreover, this stellar content\nplaces them on the size-mass relation of the local cluster ellipticals. These\nresults imply that for a given mass, the stellar mass at z~1.3 is distributed\nwithin these ellipticals according to the same stellar mass profile of local\nellipticals. We find that a pure size evolution, even mild, is ruled out for\nour galaxies since it would lead them away from both the Kormendy and the\nsize-mass relation. If an evolution of the effective radius takes place, this\nmust be compensated by an increase in the luminosity, hence of the stellar mass\nof the galaxies, to keep them on the local relations. We show that to follow\nthe Kormendy relation, the stellar mass must increase as the effective radius.\nHowever, this mass growth is not sufficient to keep the galaxies on the\nsize-mass relation for the same variation in effective radius. Thus, if we want\nto preserve the Kormendy relation, we fail to satisfy the size-mass relation\nand vice versa.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A, updated to match final journal\n  version"]}]

Depending on\nthe thermodynamic conditions, i.e., the effectiveness of radiative cooling, and\nthe radial surface density profile, planets migrate inward or outward. Clearly,\nthis will influence the semimajor axis - mass distribution of planets as\npredicted by population synthesis simulations. Aims: Our goal is to study the\nglobal effects of radiative cooling, viscous torque desaturation and gap\nopening as well as stellar irradiation on the tidal migration of a synthetic\nplanet population. Methods: We combine results from several analytical studies\nand 3D hydrodynamic simulations in a new semi-analytical migration model for\nthe application in our planet population synthesis calculations. Results: We\nfind a good agreement of our model with torques obtained in a 3D radiative\nhydrodynamic simulations. We find three convergence zones in a typical disc,\ntowards which planets migrate from the in- and outside, affecting strongly the\nmigration behavior of low-mass planets. Interestingly, this leads to slow type\nII like migration behavior for low-mass planets captured in those zones even\nwithout an ad hoc migration rate reduction factor or a yet to be defined\nhalting mechanism. This means that the new prescription of migration including\nnon-isothermal effects makes the preciously widely used artificial migration\nrate reduction factor obsolete. Conclusions: Outward migration in parts of a\ndisc makes some planets survive long enough to become massive. The convergence\nzones lead to a potentially observable accumulations of low-mass planets at\ncertain semimajor axes.

We used the dust\nradiative transfer code MCFOST and the thermochemical code ProDiMo to derive\nthe disk structure from the simultaneous modeling of the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED), VLT/CRIRES CO P(10) 4.75 micron, Herschel/PACS [O I] 63\nmicron, Spitzer-IRS, and JCMT 12CO J=3-2 spectra, VLTI/PIONIER H-band\nvisibilities, and constraints from (sub-)mm continuum interferometry and\nnear-IR imaging. We found a disk model able to describe the current\nobservations simultaneously. This disk has the following structure. (1) To\nreproduce the SED, the near-IR interferometry data, and the CO ro-vibrational\nemission, refractory grains (we suggest carbon) are present inside the silicate\nsublimation radius (0.08<R<0.2 AU). (2) The dust cavity (R<30 AU) is filled\nwith gas, the surface density of this gas must increase with radius to fit the\nCO P(10) line profile, a small gap of a few AU in the gas is compatible with\ncurrent data, and a large gap in the gas is not likely. (4) The gas/dust ratio\ninside the cavity is > 100 to account for the 870 micron continuum upper limit\nand the CO P(10) line flux. (5) The gas/dust ratio at 30<R<200 AU is < 10 to\nsimultaneously describe the [O I] 63 micron line flux and the CO P(10) line\nprofile. (6) In the outer disk, most of the mass should be located in the\nmidplane, and a significant fraction of the dust is in large grains.\nConclusions: Simultaneous modeling of the gas and dust is required to break the\nmodel degeneracies and constrain the disk structure. An increasing gas surface\ndensity with radius in the inner dust cavity echoes the effect of a migrating\nJovian planet.

We also find that the impact of an AGN in ULIRGs is strong, increasing\nsigma by a factor 1.5 on average. The observed weak dependency of sigma with\nSFR surface density for local U/LIRGs is in very good agreement with that\nmeasured in some high-z samples.\n  Ionized outflows. The presence of ionized gas outflows in U/LIRGs seems\nuniversal based on the detection of a broad, usually blueshifted, Halpha line.\nAGNs in U/LIRGs are able to generate faster (x2) and more massive (x1.4)\nionized gas outflows than pure starbursts. The derived ionized mass loading\nfactors are in general below one, with only a few AGNs above this limit. Only a\nsmall fraction of the ionized material from low mass LIRGs (log(Mdyn/Msun) <\n10.4) could reach the intergalactic medium, with more massive galaxies\nretaining the gas. The observed average outflow properties in U/LIRGs are\nsimilar to high-z galaxies of comparable SFR. In the bright SF clumps found in\nLIRGs, ionized gas outflows appear to be very common. For a given SFR surface\ndensity, outflows in LIRG clumps would be about one to two orders of magnitude\nless energetic than those launched by clumps in high-z SF galaxies.\n","Comment: 36 pages, 20 figures, 6 tables.

An excess of X-ray emission below about 2 keV, called soft-excess, is\nvery common in Type 1 AGN spectra. The origin of this feature remains debated.\nOriginally modeled with a blackbody, there are now several possibilities to\nmodel the soft-excess, including warm Comptonization and blurred ionized\nreflection. In this paper, we test ionized-reflection models on Mrk 509, a\nbright Seyfert 1 galaxy for which we have a unique data set, in order to\ndetermine whether it can be responsible for the strong soft-excess. We use ten\nsimultaneous XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL observations performed every four days. We\npresent here the results of the spectral analysis, the evolution of the\nparameters and the variability properties of the X-ray emission. The\napplication of blurred ionized-reflection models leads to a very strong\nreflection and an extreme geometry, but fails to reproduce the broad-band\nspectrum of Mrk 509. Two different scenarios for blurred ionized reflection are\ndiscussed: stable geometry and lamp-post configuration. In both cases we find\nthat the model parameters do not follow the expected relations, indicating that\nthe model is fine-tuned to fit the data without physical justification. A\nlarge, slow variation of the soft-excess without counterpart in the hard X-rays\ncould be explained by a change in ionization of the reflector. However, such a\nchange does not naturally follow from the assumed geometrical configuration.\nWarm Comptonization remains the most probable origin of the soft-excess in this\nobject. Nevertheless, it is possible that both ionized reflection and warm\nComptonization mechanisms can explain the soft-excess in all objects, one\ndominating the other one, depending on the physical conditions of the disk and\nthe corona.\n","Comment: 12 pages, A&A accepted"]}]

There, by\nexploring a very broad range of possible model parameters several scenarios\ncapable of explaining the observations were suggested.

In our models we consider collisions, direct\nradiation pressure, and drag forces, i.e. the actual physical processes\noperating in debris discs. We find that all scenarios discussed in Ertel et al.\nare physically sensible and can reproduce the observed SED along with the PACS\nsurface brightness profiles reasonably well. In one model, the dust is produced\nbeyond 120au in a narrow planetesimal belt and is transported inwards by\nPoynting-Robertson and stellar wind drag.

Another model consists of two spatially separated planetesimal\nbelts, a warm inner and a cold outer one.

The analysis is furthermore important in\nthat the high-precision detection of the cooperative physical phenomena is\npossible even from low-precision experimental data.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 10 figures, REVTeX4.1"]}]

We also performed an\natmospheric analysis of the component spectra with the Spectroscopy Made Easy\n(SME) package. Our analysis shows that AK For consists of two active, cool\ndwarfs having masses of $M_1=0.6958 \\pm 0.0010$ and $M_2=0.6355 \\pm 0.0007$\nM$_\\odot$ and radii of $R_1=0.687 \\pm 0.020$ and $R_2=0.609 \\pm 0.016$\nR$_\\odot$, slightly less metal abundant than the Sun.

Its orbital period is one of the longest and rotational velocities\none of the lowest, which allows us to obtain very precise radial velocity\nmeasurements. The precision in physical parameters we obtained places AK For\namong the binaries with the best mass measurements in the literature. It also\nfills the gap in our knowledge of stars in the range of 0.5-0.8 M$_\\odot$, and\nbetween short and long-period systems.

Based on Fe II (5169) and Si (II) (6355), our spectrum indicates an\nunusually low expansion velocity of 4000-6350 km/s, the lowest ever measured\nfor a GRB-SN. Additionally, we determined the brightness and shape of each\naccompanying SN relative to a template supernova (SN 1998bw), which were used\nto estimate the amount of nickel produced via nucleosynthesis during each\nexplosion. We find that our derived nickel masses are typical of other GRB-SNe,\nand greater than those of SNe Ibc that are not associated with GRBs. For GRB\n130831A / SN 2013fu, we use our well-sampled R-band light curve (LC) to\nestimate the amount of ejecta mass and the kinetic energy of the SN, finding\nthat these too are similar to other GRB-SNe. For GRB 130215A, we take advantage\nof contemporaneous optical/NIR observations to construct an optical/NIR\nbolometric LC of the afterglow. We fit the bolometric LC with the millisecond\nmagnetar model of Zhang & Meszaros (2001), which considers dipole radiation as\na source of energy injection to the forward shock powering the optical/NIR\nafterglow. Using this model we derive an initial spin period of P=12 ms and a\nmagnetic field of B=1.1 x 10^15 G, which are commensurate with those found for\nproposed magnetar central engines of other long-duration GRBs.\n","Comment: Archive copy - 24 pages, 12 Figures, 3 Tables.

To do so, we isolate the two main time scales of quasi\nregular gaps in the data.

The spectra obtained after filling the gaps in the selected\nsolar-like stars show a net reduction in the overall background level, as well\nas a change in the background parameters. The inferred convective properties\ncould change as much as 200% in the selected example, introducing a bias in the\np-mode frequency of maximum power. When global asteroseismic scaling relations\nare used, this bias can lead up to a variation in the surface gravity of 0.05\ndex.

The follow-up X-ray (0.2 - 10 keV) observations on HESS J1507-622 are\nreported, and possibilities regarding the nature of the VHE source and that of\nthe newly discovered X-ray sources are investigated.

Such a cosmology could arise naturally in the well-motivated moduli\nscenario in the context of supersymmetry (SUSY) -- in particular in models of\nSplit-SUSY.

In particular, in the moduli scenario with wino or\nhiggsino dark matter we find that the dark matter particles produced from\nmoduli decays would thermalize with radiation and kinetically decouple below\nthe reheating temperature. Thus, the growth of dark matter perturbations is not\nsustained, and the predictions for the matter power spectrum are similar to a\nstandard thermal history.

We have used\nALMA to map the emission of a set of dense molecular gas tracers (CO(3-2),\nCO(6-5), HCN(4-3), HCO+(4-3) and CS(7-6)) and their underlying continuum\nemission in the central r ~ 2kpc of NGC1068 with spatial resolutions ~\n0.3\"-0.5\" (~ 20-35pc). Molecular line and dust continuum emissions are detected\nfrom a r ~ 200pc off-centered circumnuclear disk (CND), from the\n2.6kpc-diameter bar region, and from the r ~ 1.3kpc starburst (SB) ring. Most\nof the emission in HCO+, HCN and CS stems from the CND. Molecular line ratios\nshow dramatic order-of-magnitude changes inside the CND that are correlated\nwith the UV/X-ray illumination by the AGN, betraying ongoing feedback. The gas\nkinematics from r ~ 50pc out to r ~ 400pc reveal a massive (M_mol ~ 2.7 (+0.9,\n-1.2) x 10^7 Msun) outflow in all molecular tracers. The tight correlation\nbetween the ionized gas outflow, the radio jet and the occurrence of outward\nmotions in the disk suggests that the outflow is AGN-driven. The outflow rate\nestimated in the CND, dM/dt ~ 63 (+21, -37) Msun yr^-1, is an order of\nmagnitude higher than the star formation rate at these radii, confirming that\nthe outflow is AGN-driven. The power of the AGN is able to account for the\nestimated momentum and kinetic luminosity of the outflow. The CND mass load\nrate of the CND outflow implies a very short gas depletion time scale of <=1\nMyr.\n","Comment: Version accepted for publication in A&A (June 4th).

Results: The target cores are located\nacross the nebula, span visual extinctions between 5 and 67 mag, and effective\ndust temperatures (averaged along the lines of sight) between 13 and 19 K. The\nextinction-normalized integrated line intensities, a proxy for the abundance in\nconstant excitation conditions of optically thin lines, vary within an order of\nmagnitude for a given molecule.

Out of the 48 targets, we confirm 15 high probability members.\nConsidering the metallicity measurements for 9 of them, we find that the iron\nabundance of Chamaeleon I is slightly subsolar with a mean value\n[Fe/H]=-0.08+/-0.04 dex. This result is in agreement with the metallicity\ndetermination of other nearby star-forming regions and suggests that the\nchemical pattern of the youngest stars in the solar neighborhood is indeed more\nmetal-poor than the Sun. We argue that this evidence may be related to the\nchemical distribution of the Gould Belt that contains most of the nearby\nstar-forming regions and young clusters.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables, Accepted for publication in Astronomy\n  & Astrophysics"]}]

The N band\ngroup delay and phase delay values could be predicted by computing the relative\nchange in the differential water vapor column density from FSU-A data.\nVisibility measurements in the K band were carried out using a scanning mode of\nthe FSU-A. Results: Using the FSU-A K band group delay and phase delay\nmeasurements, we were able to predict the corresponding N band values with high\naccuracy with residuals of less than 1 micrometer. This allows the coherent\nintegration of the MIDI fringes of faint or resolved N band targets,\nrespectively. With that method we could decrease the detection limit of\ncorrelated fluxes of MIDI down to 0.5 Jy (vs. 5 Jy without FSU-A) and 0.05 Jy\n(vs. 0.2 Jy without FSU-A) using the ATs and UTs, respectively. The K band\nvisibilities could be measured with a precision down to ~2%.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 13 figures, Accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

Travel times are deduced from the cross-covariance of the random wave\nfield. Here we consider travel times and also products of travel times as\nobservables. They contain information about e.g. the statistical properties of\nconvection in the Sun. The basic assumption of the model is that noise is the\nresult of the stochastic excitation of solar waves, a random process which is\nstationary and Gaussian. We generalize the existing noise model (Gizon and\nBirch 2004) by dropping the assumption of horizontal spatial homogeneity. Using\na recurrence relation, we calculate the noise covariance matrices for the\nmoments of order 4, 6, and 8 of the observed wave field, for the moments of\norder 2, 3 and 4 of the cross-covariance, and for the moments of order 2, 3 and\n4 of the travel times. All noise covariance matrices depend only on the\nexpectation value of the cross-covariance of the observed wave field. For\nproducts of travel times, the noise covariance matrix consists of three terms\nproportional to $1/T$, $1/T^2$, and $1/T^3$, where $T$ is the duration of the\nobservations.

In this work, we present an extended study of the dust environment of a\nsample of short period comets and their dynamical history. With this aim, we\ncharacterized the dust tails when the comets are active, and we made a\nstatistical study to determine their dynamical evolution. The targets selected\nwere 22P/Kopff, 30P/Reinmuth 1, 78P/Gehrels 2, 115P/Maury, 118P/Shoemaker-Levy\n4, 123P/West-Hartley, 157P/Tritton, 185/Petriew, and P/2011 W2 (Rinner).\nMethods. We use two different observational data: a set of images taken at the\nObservatorio de Sierra Nevada and the Afrho curves provided by the amateur\nastronomical association Cometas-Obs. To model these observations, we use our\nMonte Carlo dust tail code. From this analysis, we derive the dust parameters,\nwhich best describe the dust environment: dust loss rates, ejection velocities,\nand size distribution of particles. On the other hand, we use a numerical\nintegrator to study the dynamical history of the comets, which allows us to\ndetermine with a 90% of confidence level the time spent by these objects in the\nregion of Jupiter Family Comets. Results. From the Monte Carlo dust tail code,\nwe derived three categories attending to the amount of dust emitted: Weakly\nactive (115P, 157P, and Rinner), moderately active (30P, 123P, and 185P), and\nhighly active (22P, 78P, and 118P). The dynamical studies showed that the\ncomets of this sample are young in the Jupiter Family region, where the\nyoungest ones are 22P (100 yr), 78P (500 yr), and 118P (600 yr). The study\npoints to a certain correlation between comet activity and time spent in the\nJupiter Family region, although this trend is not always fulfilled.

Earlier experiments in the\nmass region A=190-200 close to the beta-stability line, using the (p,f) and\n(\\alpha,f) reactions, observed a more symmetric distribution of fission\nfragments. While the beta-delayed fission of 180Hg can be associated with\nrelatively low excitation energy, this is not the case for light-ion reactions,\nwhich result in warm compound nuclei. Purpose: To elucidate the roles of proton\nand neutron numbers and excitation energy in determining symmetric and\nasymmetric fission yields, we compute and analyze the isentropic potential\nenergy surfaces of 174,180,198Hg and 196,210Po. Methods: We use the\nfinite-temperature superfluid nuclear density functional theory, for excitation\nenergies up to E*=30MeV and zero angular momentum. For our theoretical\nframework, we consider the Skyrme energy density functional SkM* and a\ndensity-dependent pairing interaction. Results: For 174,180Hg, we predict\nfission pathways consistent with asymmetric fission at low excitation energies,\nwith the symmetric fission pathway opening very gradually as excitation energy\nis increased. For 198Hg and 196Po, we expect the nearly-symmetric fission\nchannel to dominate. 210Po shows a preference for a slightly asymmetric pathway\nat low energies, and a preference for a symmetric pathway at high energies.\nConclusions: Our self-consistent theory suggests that excitation energy weakly\naffects the fission pattern of the nuclei considered.

Improvements have also been made for CO photodissociation.\nFor the first time, we use accurate N$_2$ and CO photodissociation rates and\nshielding functions in a model of the circumstellar envelope of the carbon-rich\nAGB star, IRC +10216. We use a state-of-the-art chemical model of an AGB\nenvelope, the latest CO and N$_2$ photodissociation data, and a new method for\nimplementing molecular shielding functions in full spherical geometry with\nisotropic incident radiation. We compare computed column densities and radial\ndistributions of molecules with observations. The transition of N$_2$ $\\to$ N\n(also, CO $\\to$ C $\\to$ C$^+$) is shifted towards the outer envelope relative\nto previous models. This leads to different column densities and radial\ndistributions of N-bearing species, especially those species whose\nformation/destruction processes largely depend on the availability of atomic or\nmolecular nitrogen, for example, C$_n$N ($n$=1, 3, 5), C$_n$N$^-$ ($n$=1, 3,\n5), HC$_n$N ($n$=1, 3, 5, 7, 9), H$_2$CN and CH$_2$CN. The chemistry of many\nspecies is directly or indirectly affected by the photodissociation of N$_2$\nand CO, especially in the outer shell of AGB stars where photodissociation is\nimportant. Thus, it is important to include N$_2$ and CO shielding in\nastrochemical models of AGB envelopes and other irradiated environments. In\ngeneral, while differences remain between our model of IRC +10216 and the\nobserved molecular column densities, better agreement is found between the\ncalculated and observed radii of peak abundance.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 17 figures, 3 tables.

Based on simulated light curves, transients are shown to occupy a\nspecific region in the Abbe versus Excess Abbe diagram, distinct from sources\npresenting pulsating-like features in their light curves or having featureless\nlight curves.\n  The method is tested on real light curves taken from EROS-2 and OGLE-II\nsurveys in a 0.50deg x 0.17deg field of the sky in the LMC. The method\nidentifies 43 EROS-2 transient candidates out of a total of ~1300 variable\nstars, and 19 more OGLE-II candidates. The efficiency of the method is further\ntested by comparing the list of transient candidates with known Be stars in the\nliterature.

CO transitions are\nobserved with Herschel, and together, these lines trace the excitation of CO.\nWe study Arp 299, a colliding galaxy group, with one component harboring an AGN\nand two more undergoing intense star formation. For Arp 299 A, we present PACS\nspectrometer observations of high-J CO lines up to J=20-19 and JCMT\nobservations of $^{13}$CO and HCN to discern between UV heating and alternative\nheating mechanisms. There is an immediately noticeable difference in the\nspectra of Arp 299 A and Arp 299 B+C, with source A having brighter high-J CO\ntransitions. This is reflected in their respective spectral energy line\ndistributions. We find that photon-dominated regions (PDRs) are unlikely to\nheat all the gas since a very extreme PDR is necessary to fit the high-J CO\nlines. In addition, this extreme PDR does not fit the HCN observations, and the\ndust spectral energy distribution shows that there is not enough hot dust to\nmatch the amount expected from such an extreme PDR. Therefore, we determine\nthat the high-J CO and HCN transitions are heated by an additional mechanism,\nnamely cosmic ray heating, mechanical heating, or X-ray heating. We find that\nmechanical heating, in combination with UV heating, is the only mechanism that\nfits all molecular transitions. We also constrain the molecular gas mass of Arp\n299 A to 3e9 Msun and find that we need 4% of the total heating to be\nmechanical heating, with the rest UV heating.\n"]}]

One of the main limitation of this technique is the effects\nof stellar activity, which up until now, have been taken into account only by\nassessing the effect of non-occulted stellar spots on the estimates of\nplanet-to-star radius ratio. In this paper, we study, for the first time, the\nimpact of the occultation of a stellar spot and plage on the transmission\nspectra of transiting exoplanets. We simulated this effect by generating a\nlarge number of transit light curves for different transiting planets, stellar\nspectral types, and for different wavelengths. Results of our simulations\nindicate that the anomalies inside the transit light curve can lead to a\nsignificant underestimation or overestimation of the planet-to-star radius\nratio as a function of wavelength. At short wavelengths, the effect can reach\nto a difference of up to 10% in the planet-to-star radius ratio, mimicking the\nsignature of light scattering in the planetary atmosphere. Atmospheric\nscattering has been proposed to interpret the increasing slopes of transmission\nspectra toward blue for exoplanets HD 189733b and GJ 3470b. Here we show that\nthese signatures can be alternatively interpreted by the occultation of stellar\nplages. Results also suggest that the best strategy to identify and quantify\nthe effects of stellar activities on the transmission spectrum of a planet is\nto perform several observations during the transit epoch at the same\nwavelength. This will allow for identifying the possible variations in transit\ndepth as a function of time due to stellar activity variability.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 6 figures, Accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

We have also used the\nWesterbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) at 350 MHz to image the same\nregion. The LOFAR and WSRT images show a similar complex morphology, at\ncomparable brightness levels, but their spatial correlation is very low.

Recent technological advances help in the development\nof wide variety of sensor nodes. Heterogeneity takes the advantage of different\ntypes of sensor nodes and improves the energy efficiency and network life.\nGenerally sensors are deployed randomly and densely in a sensing region so\nshort distance multihop communication reduces the long distance transmission in\nthe sensor network. In this research paper MEEP (multihop energy efficient\nprotocol for heterogeneous sensor network) is proposed. The proposed protocol\ncombines the idea of clustering and multihop communication. Heterogeneity is\ncreated in the network by using some nodes of high energy. Low energy nodes use\na residual energy based scheme to become a cluster head. High energy nodes act\nas the relay nodes for low energy cluster head when they are not performing the\nduty of a cluster head to save their energy further.

One of the most unique and robust experimental facts\nabout iron-based superconductors [2-4] is the renormalization of the conduction\nband by factor of 3 near the Fermi level [5-9]. Obviously related to\nsuperconductivity, this unusual behaviour remains unexplained. Here, by\nstudying the momentum-resolved spectrum of the whole valence band in a\nrepresentative material, we show that this phenomenon originates from\nelectronic interaction on a much larger energy scale. We observe an abrupt\ndepletion of the spectral weight in the middle of the Fe $3d$ band, which is\naccompanied by a drastic increase of the scattering rate. Remarkably, all\nspectral anomalies including the low-energy renormalization can be explained by\ncoupling to excitations, strongly peaked at about 0.5 eV. Such high-energy\ninteraction distinguishes all unconventional superconductors from common\nmetals.\n"]}]

However, eGFR values are recorded without reference to\nthe creatinine (SCr) assays used to derive them, and newer assays were\nintroduced at different time points across laboratories in UK. These changes\nmay cause systematic bias in eGFR reported in routinely collected data; even\nthough laboratory reported eGFR values have a correction factor applied.\n  Design: An algorithm to detect changes in SCr which affect eGFR calculation\nmethod by comparing the mapping of SCr values on to eGFR values across a\ntime-series of paired eGFR and SCr measurements.\n  Setting: Routinely collected primary care data from 20,000 people with the\nrichest renal function data from the Quality Improvement in Chronic Kidney\nDisease (QICKD) trial.\n  Results: The algorithm identified a change in eGFR calculation method in 80\n(63%) of the 127 included practices. This change was identified in 4,736\n(23.7%) patient time series analysed. This change in calibration method was\nfound to cause a significant step change in reported eGFR values producing a\nsystematic bias. eGFR values could not be recalibrated by applying the\nModification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation to the laboratory\nreported SCr values.\n  Conclusions: This algorithm can identify laboratory changes in eGFR\ncalculation methods and changes in SCr assay. Failure to account for these\nchanges may misconstrue renal function changes over time. Researchers using\nroutine eGFR data should account for these effects.\n"]}]
