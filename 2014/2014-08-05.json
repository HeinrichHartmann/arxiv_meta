This approach leads to a spontaneous\nbreaking of the particle-number symmetry and mixing of states with different\nparticle numbers. In order to restore the particle number, various methods have\nbeen employed, which are based on projection approaches before or after\nvariation. Approximate variation-after-projection (VAP) schemes, utilizing the\nLipkin method, have mostly been used within the Lipkin-Nogami prescription.\n  Purpose: Without recurring to the Lipkin-Nogami prescription, and using\ninstead states rotated in the gauge space, we derive the Lipkin method of\nparticle-number restoration up to sixth order and we test the convergence and\naccuracy of the obtained expansion.\n  Methods: We perform self-consistent calculations using the higher-order\nLipkin method to restore the particle-number symmetry in the framework of\nsuperfluid nuclear energy-density functional theory.

While the large scale nature of the\nproblem entails to find distributed solutions, game theory appears to be a\nnatural tool. We propose a novel distributed algorithm based on group formation\ngames, called \\textit{the hedonic decision algorithm}. This formalism is\nconstructive: a new class of group formation games is introduced where the\nutility of players within a group is separable and symmetric being a\ngeneralized version of parity-affiliation games. The proposed hedonic decision\nalgorithm is also suitable for any set-covering problem. To evaluate the\nperformance of our algorithm, we propose other approaches to which our\nalgorithm is compared. We first develop a centralized recursive algorithm\ncalled \\textit{the hold minimum} being able to find the optimal assignments.\nHowever, because of the NP-hard complexity of the mobile assignment problem, we\npropose a centralized polynomial-time heuristic algorithm called \\textit{the\ncolumn control} producing near-optimal solutions when the operational power\ncosts of base stations are taken into account. Starting from this efficient\ncentralized approach, a \\textit{distributed column control algorithm} is also\nproposed and compared to \\textit{the hedonic decision algorithm}. We also\nimplement the nearest base station algorithm which is very simple and intuitive\nand efficiently manage fast-moving users served by macro BSs.

Our\nalgorithm can compute $\\lambda$ exactly in $O((\\sqrt{n} \\log^{*} n+D)\\lambda^4\n\\log^2 n)$ time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that\nexplicitly studies computing the exact minimum cut in the distributed setting.\nPreviously, non-trivial sublinear time algorithms for this problem are known\nonly for unweighted graphs when $\\lambda\\leq 3$ due to Pritchard and\nThurimella's $O(D)$-time and $O(D+n^{1/2}\\log^* n)$-time algorithms for\ncomputing $2$-edge-connected and $3$-edge-connected components.\n  By using the edge sampling technique of Karger's, we can convert this\nalgorithm into a $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation $O((\\sqrt{n}\\log^{*}\nn+D)\\epsilon^{-5}\\log^3 n)$-time algorithm for any $\\epsilon>0$.

In the first case, the\ninfluence of the confinement of the critical nucleus between two parallel\nmisfitting substrates is investigated using scaling arguments. We present phase\ndiagrams giving the nature of the nucleation regime as a function of the\ndriving force and the degree of confinement. We complement this analytical\nstudy by amplitude equations simulations. In the second case, the influence of\na screw dislocation inside a nanowire on the development of the morphological\nsurface stability of the wire, related to the Rayleigh-Plateau instability, is\nexamined. Here the screw dislocation provokes a torsion of the wire known as\nEshelby twist. Numerical calculations using the finite element method and the\namplitude equations are performed to support analytical investigations. It is\nshown that the screw dislocation promotes the Rayleigh-Plateau instability.\n","Comment: 16 pages"]}]

In 2012 and 2013, three novae were detected in gamma rays and stood\nin contrast to the first gamma-ray detected nova V407 Cygni 2010, which belongs\nto a rare class of symbiotic binary systems. Despite likely differences in the\ncompositions and masses of their white dwarf progenitors, the three classical\nnovae are similarly characterized as soft spectrum transient gamma-ray sources\ndetected over 2-3 week durations. The gamma-ray detections point to unexpected\nhigh-energy particle acceleration processes linked to the mass ejection from\nthermonuclear explosions in an unanticipated class of Galactic gamma-ray\nsources.\n","Comment: 34 pages, includes Supplementary Materials; corresponding authors:\n  C.C.

The simulations\npresented here employ the s-${\\alpha}$ tokamak equilibrium model. Local\ngyrokinetic calculations, using GS2 have been performed over a range of radial\nsurfaces, x, and for ballooning phase angle, p, in the range -${\\pi} {\\leq} p\n{\\leq\\pi}$, to map out the complex local mode frequency, ${\\Omega_0(x, p) =\n\\omega_0(x, p) + i\\gamma_0(x, p)}$. Assuming a quadratic radial profile for the\ndrive, namely ${\\eta_i = L_n/L_T}$, (holding constant all other equilibrium\nprofiles such as safety factor, magnetic shear etc.), ${\\Omega_0(x, p)}$ has a\nstationary point. The reconstructed global mode then sits on the outboard mid\nplane of the tokamak plasma, and is known as a conventional or isolated mode,\nwith global growth rate, ${\\gamma}$ ~ Max[${\\gamma_0(x, p)}$], where\n${\\gamma_0(x, p)}$ is the local growth rate. Taking the radial variation in\nother equilibrium profiles (e.g safety factor q(x)) into account, removes the\nstationary point in ${\\Omega_0(x, p)}$ and results in a mode that peaks\nslightly away from the outboard mid-plane with a reduced global growth rate.\nFinally, the influence of flow shear has also been investigated through a\nDoppler shift, ${\\omega_0 \\rightarrow \\omega_0 + n\\Omega^{\\prime}x}$, where n\nis the toroidal mode number and ${\\Omega^{\\prime}}$ incorporates the effect of\nflow shear. The equilibrium profile variation introduces an asymmetry to the\ngrowth rate spectrum with respect to the sign of ${\\Omega^{\\prime}}$,\nconsistent with recent global gyrokinetic calculations.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 8 figures and 1 table"]}]

This connection comes from\nup-regulation of glycolysis by tumor cells, which can lead to active\ncompetition for resources in the tumor microenvironment between tumor and\nimmune cells. Here it is further proposed that cancer stem cells (CSCs) can\ncircumvent the anti-tumor immune response by creating a 'protective shield' of\nnon-stem cancer cells around them. This shield can protect the CSCs both by\ncreating a physical barrier between them and cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs), and\nby promoting competition for the common resources, such as glucose, between\nnon-stem cancer cells and CTLs. The implications of this hypothesis are\ninvestigate using an agent-based model, leading to a prediction that relative\nCSC to non-CSC ratio will vary with the strength of the host immune response,\nwith the highest occurring at an intermediate state of immune activation.
