This image will be act as reference image to hide the text. Using this\ngrey scale reference image any text can be hidden. Single character of a text\ncan be represented by 8-bit. The 8-bit character can be split into 4X2 bit\ninformation. If the reference image and the data file are transmitted through\nnetwork separately, we can achieve the effect of Steganography. Here the image\nis not at all distorted because said image is only used for referencing. Any\nhuge mount of text material can be hidden using a very small image. Decipher\nthe text is not possible intercepting the image or data file separately. So, it\nis more secure.\n","Comment: http://ijict.org/index.php/ijoat/article/view/approach-of-stegnagraphy .\n  arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sigpro.2009.08.010 by other authors without\n  attribution"]}]
