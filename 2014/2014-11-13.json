On the largest\nself-gravitating scales ('first crossing'), these correspond to GMCs, and on\nthe smallest non-fragmenting self-gravitating scales ('last crossing'), to\nprotostellar cores. Here, we extend this formalism to rigorously calculate the\nauto and cross-correlation functions of cores (and by extension, young stars)\nas a function of spatial separation and mass, in analogy to the cosmological\ncalculation of halo clustering. We show that this generically predicts that\nstar formation is very strongly clustered on small scales: stars form in\nclusters, themselves inside GMCs. Outside the binary-star regime, the projected\ncorrelation function declines as a weak power-law, until a characteristic scale\nwhich corresponds to the characteristic mass scale of GMCs. On much larger\nscales the clustering declines such that star formation is not strongly biased\non galactic scales, relative to the actual dense gas distribution. The precise\ncorrelation function shape depends on properties of the turbulent spectrum, but\nits qualitative behavior is quite general. The predictions agree well with\nobservations of young star and core autocorrelation functions over ~4 dex in\nradius. Clustered star formation is a generic consequence of supersonic\nturbulence if most of the power in the velocity field, hence the contribution\nto density fluctuations, comes from large scales. The distribution of\nself-gravitating masses near the sonic length is then imprinted by fluctuations\non larger scales.

Our simulations include fully explicit treatment of both the\nmulti-phase ISM (molecular through hot) and stellar feedback. The stellar\nfeedback inputs (energy, momentum, mass, and metal fluxes) are taken directly\nfrom stellar population models. These sources of stellar feedback, with zero\nadjusted parameters, reproduce the observed relation between stellar and halo\nmass up to M_halo~10^12 M_sun (including dwarfs, satellites, MW-mass disks, and\nsmall groups). By extension, this leads to reasonable agreement with the\nstellar mass function for M_star<10^11 M_sun. We predict weak redshift\nevolution in the M_star-M_halo relation, consistent with current constraints to\nz>6. We find that the M_star-M_halo relation is insensitive to numerical\ndetails, but is sensitive to the feedback physics.

Star formation rates agree well with the\nobserved Kennicutt relation at all redshifts. The galaxy-averaged Kennicutt\nrelation is very different from the numerically imposed law for converting gas\ninto stars in the simulation, and is instead determined by self-regulation via\nstellar feedback. Feedback reduces star formation rates considerably and\nproduces a reservoir of gas that leads to rising late-time star formation\nhistories significantly different from the halo accretion history.

The model reveals that the mechanism of cell death and the geometry\nof the snowflake interact in complex, evolutionarily important ways. We find\nthat the organization of snowflake yeast imposes powerful limitations on the\navailable space for new cell growth. By dying more frequently, cells in\nclusters avoid encountering space limitations, and, paradoxically, reach higher\nnumbers. In addition, selection for particular group sizes can explain the\nincreased rate of apoptosis both in terms of total cell number and total\nnumbers of collectives.

The striking\npoint in this result is that the coordinator is not required to be unique and\ncan change arbitrarily from round to round.

Candidates for such fields are dark\nmatter (including axions) and dark energy, as well as several more exotic\nsources described by standard-model extensions. Existing parity nonconservation\nexperiments in Cs, Dy, Yb, and Tl are combined with our calculations to\ndirectly place limits on the interaction strength between the temporal\ncomponent, b_0, of a static pseudovector cosmic field and the atomic electrons,\nwith the most stringent limit of |b_0^e| < 7*10^(-15) GeV, in the laboratory\nframe of reference, coming from Dy. From a measurement of the nuclear anapole\nmoment of Cs, and a limit on its value for Tl, we also extract limits on the\ninteraction strength between the temporal component of this cosmic field, as\nwell as a related tensor cosmic-field component d_00, with protons and\nneutrons.

(ii) A search strategy to optimize the measure over the\nsubset space in a reasonable amount of time.

Analytical studies with effective models suggest that QCD may break\nparity in dense systems. Besides, P- and CP- odd bubbles may appear in a finite\nvolume due to local large topological fluctuations in a hot medium. The last\neffect may be treated in a quasi-equilibrium description by means of a\nnon-trivial axial chemical potential. We consider the 'two flavour'\nNambu--Jona-Lasinio model in the presence of a vector and an axial external\nchemical potentials and study the phase structure of the model at zero\ntemperature. These magnitudes could trigger a phase where parity could be\nbroken in QCD. Analogies and differences with the expected behaviour in QCD are\ndiscussed besides the limitations of the model. We also consider the low energy\nrealization of QCD in terms of mesons when an axial chemical potential is\npresent. The eigenstates of strong interactions do not have a definite parity\nand interactions that would otherwise be forbidden compete with the familiar\nones. We focus on scalars and pseudoscalars that are described by a generalized\nlinear sigma model. Finally, we investigate how local parity breaking may\naffect vector physics. A modified dispersion relation is derived for the\nlightest vector mesons rho and omega.

We construct\ntwo languages $\\mathcal{L}^{\\ast}(x)$ and $\\mathcal{L}(x)$ with classical\nset-theoretical semantics which allow us to illustrate those meanings and to\nshow that the non-Boolean lattice of propositions of quantum logic (QL) can be\nobtained by selecting a subset of \\textit{p-testable} propositions within the\nBoolean lattice of all propositions associated with sentences of\n$\\mathcal{L}(x)$. Yet, the aforesaid semantics is incompatible with the\nstandard interpretation of quantum mechanics (QM) because of known no-go\ntheorems. But if one accepts our criticism of these theorems and the ensuing SR\n(semantic realism) interpretation of QM, the incompatibility disappears, and\nthe classical and quantum notions of truth can coexist, since they refer to\ndifferent metalinguistic concepts (\\textit{truth} and \\textit{verifiability\naccording to QM}, respectively). Moreover one can construct a quantum language\n$\\mathcal{L}_{TQ}(x)$ whose Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra is isomorphic to QL, the\nsentences of which state (testable) properties of individual samples of\nphysical systems, while standard QL does not bear this interpretation.\n","Comment: 15 pages, no figure, standard LateX"]}]
