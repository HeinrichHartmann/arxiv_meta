We directly work with this\nelliptic system on the contact manifold without involving the symplectization\nprocess. We establish the local a priori $C^k$ coercive pointwise estimates for\nall $k \\geq 2$ in terms of $\\|dw\\|_{C^0}$ by doing tensorial calculations on\ncontact manifold itself using the contact triad connection introduced by\npresent the authors. Equipping the punctured Riemann surface $(\\dot \\Sigma,j)$\nwith a cylindrical K\\\"ahler metric and isothermal coordinates near every\npuncture, we prove the asymptotic (subsequence) convergence to the `spiraling'\ninstantons along the `rotating' Reeb orbit for any solution $w$, not\nnecessarily for $w^*\\lambda \\circ j$ being exact (i.e., allowing non-zero\n`charge' $Q \\neq 0$), with bounded gradient $\\|d w\\|_{C^0} < C$ and finite\n$\\pi$-harmonic energy. For nondegenerate contact forms, we employ the\n`three-interval method' to prove the exponential convergence to a closed Reeb\norbit when $Q = 0$. (The Morse-Bott case using this method is treated in a\nsequel.) In particular, this also provides a new proof of the exponential\nconvergence result even for the case of pseudo-holomorphic curves in\nsymplectization, which was established by Hofer-Wyosocki-Zehnder and by\nBourgeois.\n","Comment: v3; change of the title, largely re-written, much simplification and\n  improvement of the presentation of the a priori estimates, new proof of\n  exponential convergence via the 3-interval method, 3 appendices added"]}]

Measurements of the\nRayleigh-Brillouin spectral scattering profile were conducted at high\nsignal-to-noise ratio for all three species, yielding high-quality spectra\nunambiguously showing the small differences between scattering in air, and its\nconstituents N2 and O2. Comparison of the experimental spectra with\ncalculations using the Tenti S6 model, developed in 1970s based on linearized\nkinetic equations for molecular gases, demonstrates that this model is valid to\nhigh accuracy. After previous measurements performed at 366 nm, the Tenti S6\nmodel is here verified for a second wavelength of 403 nm. Values for the bulk\nviscosity for the gases are derived by optimizing the model to the\nmeasurements. It is verified that the bulk viscosity parameters obtained from\nprevious experiments at 366 nm, are valid for wavelengths of 403 nm. Also for\nair, which is treated as a single-component gas with effective gas transport\ncoefficients, the Tenti S6 treatment is validated for 403 nm as for the\npreviously used wavelength of 366 nm, yielding an accurate model description of\nthe scattering profiles for a range of temperatures and pressures, including\nthose of relevance for atmospheric studies. It is concluded that the Tenti S6\nmodel, further verified in the present study, is applicable to LIDAR\napplications for exploring the wind velocity and the temperature profile\ndistributions of the Earth's atmosphere. Based on the present findings,\npredictions can be made on the spectral profiles for a typical LIDAR\nbackscatter geometry, which deviate by some 7 percent from purely Gaussian\nprofiles at realistic sub-atmospheric pressures occurring at 3-5 km altitude in\nthe Earth's atmosphere.\n"]}]

In Comparison with the linear calibration methods, which\nemploys one point, there is large difference in the strength of longitudinal\nfield $B_l$ and tranverse field $B_t$, caused by the non-linear relationship,\nbut the discrepancy is little in the case of inclination and azimuth. We\nconclude that it is better to deal with the non-linear effects in the\ncalibration of $B_l$ and $B_t$ using six points. Moreover, in comparison with\nSDO/HMI, SMFT has larger stray light and acquires less magnetic field strength.\nFor vector magnetic fields in two sunspot regions, the magnetic field strength,\ninclination and azimuth angles between SMFT and HMI are roughly in agrement,\nwith the linear fitted slope of 0.73/0.7, 0.95/1.04 and 0.99/1.1. In the case\nof pores and quiet regions ($B_l$ $<$ 600 G), the fitted slopes of the\nlongitudinal magnetic field strength are 0.78 and 0.87 respectively.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 9 figures, Accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

The difficulty is\nthat the traditional estimate of the superconducting coherence length is very\nshort and anisotropic in these materials, typically ~2 nm in the a-b plane and\n~0.2 nm along the c-axis. The coherence volume encloses very few\nsuperconducting pairs, so even the presence of small scale inhomogeneities can\nlocally disrupt superconductivity unlike in conventional superconductors.\nTherefore the electrical properties of Josephson junctions are sensitive to\nchemical variations and structural defects on atomic length scales, thus to\nmake multiple uniform HTS junctions, control at the atomic level is required.\nIn this letter, we demonstrate very high-quality all-HTS Josephson\nsuperconducting tunnel junctions (both Josephson and quasiparticle tunneling)\ncreated by using a 500 pm diameter focused beam of helium ions to direct-write\ntunnel barriers into YBa2Cu3O7(YBCO) thin films.

Although many methods have been proposed for image\nauto-annotation, the question of how to determine the number of tags to be\nselected per image remains open. The main challenge is that for a large tag\nvocabulary, there is often a lack of ground truth data for acquiring optimal\ncutoff thresholds per tag. In contrast to previous works that pre-specify the\nnumber of tags to be selected, we propose in this paper adaptive tag selection.\nThe key insight is to divide the vocabulary into two disjoint subsets, namely a\nseen set consisting of tags having ground truth available for optimizing their\nthresholds and a novel set consisting of tags without any ground truth. Such a\ndivision allows us to estimate how many tags shall be selected from the novel\nset according to the tags that have been selected from the seen set.

Brook's\nTheorem states that every graph with maximum degree k is k-colorable unless it\ncontains a subgraph isomorphic to K_{k+1} (or an odd cycle for k=2).\nEquivalently, for all k>=4, the only k-critical graph of maximum degree k-1 is\nK_k. A natural generalization of Brook's theorem is to consider the Ore-degree\nof a graph, which is the maximum of d(u)+d(v) over all edges uv. Kierstead and\nKostochka proved that for all k>=6 the only k-critical graph with Ore-degree at\nmost 2k-1 is K_k. Kostochka, Rabern and Steibitz proved that the only\n5-critical graphs with Ore-degree at most 9 are K_5 and a graph they called\nO_5.\n  A different generalization of Brook's theorem, motivated by Hajos'\nconstruction, is Gallai's conjectured bound on the minimum density of a\nk-critical graph. Recently, Kostochka and Yancey proved Gallai's conjecture.\nTheir proof for k>=5 implies the above results on Ore-degree. However, the case\nfor k=4 remains open, which is the subject of this paper.\n  Kostochka and Yancey's short but beautiful proof for the case k=4 says that\nif $G$ is a $4$-critical graph, then |E(G)|>= (5|V(G)|-2)/3. We prove the\nfollowing bound which is better when there exists a large independent set of\ndegree three vertices: if G is a 4-critical graph G, then |E(G)|>= 1.6 |V(G)| +\n.2 alpha(D_3(G)) - .6, where D_3(G) is the graph induced by the degree three\nvertices of G. As a corollary, we characterize the 4-critical graphs with\nOre-degree at most seven as precisely the graphs of Ore-degree seven in the\nfamily of graphs obtained from K_4 and Ore compositions.\n","Comment: 35 pages"]}]
