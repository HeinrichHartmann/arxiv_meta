In this work, we are interested in the\nfollowing question: Can we explore some other stable social attributes to\nquantify the centrality and similarity of nodes? Taking GPS traces of human\nwalks from the real world, we find that there exist two known phenomena. One is\npublic hotspot, the other is personal hotspot. Motivated by this observation,\nwe present Hoten (hotspot and entropy), a novel routing metric to improve\nrouting performance in DTNs. First, we use the relative entropy between the\npublic hotspots and the personal hotspots to compute the centrality of nodes.\nThen we utilize the inverse symmetrized entropy of the personal hotspots\nbetween two nodes to compute the similarity between them. Third, we exploit the\nentropy of personal hotspots of a node to estimate its personality. Besides, we\npropose a method to ascertain the optimized size of hotspot. Finally, we\ncompare our routing strategy with other state-of-the-art routing schemes\nthrough extensive trace-driven simulations, the results show that Hoten largely\noutperforms other solutions, especially in terms of combined overhead/packet\ndelivery ratio and the average number of hops per message.\n","Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to further studies"]}]

We detected 102 C\nIV lines in the range: 4.35 < z < 6.2 of which 27 are above z ~ 5. Thanks to\nthe characteristics of resolution and spectral coverage of X-shooter, we could\nalso detect 25 Si IV doublets associated with the C IV at z>5. The column\ndensity distribution function of the C IV line sample is observed to evolve in\nredshift for z>~ 5.3, with respect to the normalization defined by low redshift\n(1.5 < z <4) C IV lines. This behaviour is reflected in the redshift evolution\nof the C IV cosmic mass density, Omega_CIV, of lines with column density in the\nrange 13.4 < log N(C IV) < 15, which is consistent with a drop of a factor of\n~2 for z>~ 5.3. Considering only the stronger C IV lines (13.8 < log N(CIV) <\n15), Omega_CIV gently rises by a factor of ~10 between z ~ 6.2 and z~ 1.5 with\na possible flattening toward z ~ 0. The increase is well fitted by a power law:\nOmega_CIV = (2+-1)x10^{-8} [(1+z)/4]^{-3.1+-0.1}. An insight into the\nproperties of the C IV absorbers and their evolution with redshift is obtained\nby comparing the observed column densities of associated C IV, Si IV and C II\nabsorptions with the output of a set of CLOUDY photo-ionization models. As\nalready claimed by cosmological simulations, we find that C IV is a good tracer\nof the metallicity in the low-density intergalacitc medium gas at z ~ 5-6 while\nat z ~ 3 it arises in gas with over density delta ~100.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS.

An inversion technique based on the spherically symmetric\ngeometry (Spherically Symmetric Inversion, SSI) was developed in the 1950s, and\nhas been widely applied to interpret various observations. However, to date\nthere is no study about uncertainty estimation of this method. In this study we\npresent the detailed assessment of this method using a three-dimensional (3D)\nelectron density in the corona from 1.5 to 4 Rsun as a model, which is\nreconstructed by tomography method from STEREO/COR1 observations during solar\nminimum in February 2008. We first show in theory and observation that the\nspherically symmetric polynomial approximation (SSPA) method and the Van de\nHulst inversion technique are equivalent. Then we assess the SSPA method using\nsynthesized pB images from the 3D density model, and find that the SSPA density\nvalues are close to the model inputs for the streamer core near the plane of\nthe sky (POS) with differences generally less than a factor of two or so; the\nformer has the lower peak but more spread in both longitudinal and latitudinal\ndirections than the latter. We estimate that the SSPA method may resolve the\ncoronal density structure near the POS with angular resolution in longitude of\nabout 50 degrees. Our results confirm the suggestion that the SSI method is\napplicable to the solar minimum streamer (belt) as stated in some previous\nstudies. In addition, we demonstrate that the SSPA method can be used to\nreconstruct the 3D coronal density, roughly in agreement with that by\ntomography for a period of low solar activity. We suggest that the SSI method\nis complementary to the 3D tomographic technique in some cases, given that the\ndevelopment of the latter is still an ongoing research effort.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 16 figures.

The existing methods such as linear\ninterpolation, least-square interpolation, or interpolation based on radial\nbasis functions (RBFs) work to some extent, but often yield blurred features\n(edges, corners, etc.).

For communities of up to medium\ndiversity, e.g. excluding environments such as soil, this is often achieved by\na combination of sequence assembly and binning, where sequences are grouped\ninto 'bins' representing taxa of the underlying microbial community from which\nthey originate. Assignment to low-ranking taxonomic bins is an important\nchallenge for binning methods as is scalability to Gb-sized datasets generated\nwith deep sequencing techniques. One of the best available methods for the\nrecovery of species bins from an individual metagenome sample is the\nexpert-trained PhyloPythiaS package, where a human expert decides on the taxa\nto incorporate in a composition-based taxonomic metagenome classifier and\nidentifies the 'training' sequences using marker genes directly from the\nsample. Due to the manual effort involved, this approach does not scale to\nmultiple metagenome samples and requires substantial expertise, which\nresearchers who are new to the area may not have. With these challenges in\nmind, we have developed PhyloPythiaS+, a successor to our previously described\nmethod PhyloPythia(S). The newly developed + component performs the work\npreviously done by the human expert. PhyloPythiaS+ also includes a new k-mer\ncounting algorithm, which accelerated k-mer counting 100-fold and reduced the\noverall execution time of the software by a factor of three.

The affine feasibility problem with sparsity and\nnonnegativity ($AFP_{SN}$ for short) is to find a sparse and nonnegative vector\n$x\\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ with $Ax=b$ if such $x$ exists. In this paper, we focus on\nestablishment of optimization approach to solving the $AFP_{SN}$. By discussing\ntangent cone and normal cone of sparse constraint, we give the first necessary\noptimality conditions, $\\alpha$-Stability, T-Stability and N-Stability, and the\nsecond necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for the related\nminimization problems with the $AFP_{SN}$. By adopting Armijo-type stepsize\nrule, we present a framework of gradient support projection algorithm for the\n$AFP_{SN}$ and prove its full convergence when matrix $A$ is $s$-regular. By\ndoing some numerical experiments, we show the excellent performance of the new\nalgorithm for the $AFP_{SN}$ without and with noise.\n"]}]

In such scenarios, the stored data or a content of\na failed node can only be reconstructed from the available live nodes belonging\nto available blocks. To analyze the resilience of the system against such block\nfailures, this work introduces the framework of Block Failure Resilient (BFR)\ncodes, wherein the data (e.g., file in DSS) can be decoded by reading out from\na same number of codeword symbols (nodes) from each available blocks of the\nunderlying codeword. Further, repairable BFR codes are introduced, wherein any\ncodeword symbol in a failed block can be repaired by contacting to remaining\nblocks in the system. Motivated from regenerating codes, file size bounds for\nrepairable BFR codes are derived, trade-off between per node storage and repair\nbandwidth is analyzed, and BFR-MSR and BFR-MBR points are derived. Explicit\ncodes achieving these two operating points for a wide set of parameters are\nconstructed by utilizing combinatorial designs, wherein the codewords of the\nunderlying outer codes are distributed to BFR codeword symbols according to\nprojective planes.\n"]}]
