The entropy profiles are robustly measured at least out to\nR_1000 in all systems and out to R_500 in 13 systems. Compared to theoretical\nexpectations, the observed distributions show a radial and mass-dependent\nexcess entropy that is greater and extends to larger radii in lower mass\nsystems. At R_500, the mass dependence and entropy excess are both negligible\nwithin the uncertainties. Mirroring this behaviour, the scaling of gas entropy\nis shallower than self-similar in the inner regions, but steepens with radius,\nbecoming consistent with self-similar at R_500. The dispersion in scaled\nentropy in the inner regions is linked to the presence of cool cores and\ndynamical activity; at larger radii the dispersion decreases by a factor of two\nand the dichotomy between subsamples disappears. Parameterising the profiles\nwith a power law plus constant model, there are two peaks in central entropy\nK_0; however, we cannot distinguish between a bimodal or a left-skewed\ndistribution. The outer slopes are correlated with system temperature; their\ndistribution is unimodal with a median value of 0.98. Renormalising the\ndimensionless entropy profiles by the gas mass fraction profile f_gas(< R),\nleads to a remarkable reduction in the scatter, implying that gas mass fraction\nvariations with radius and mass are the cause of the observed entropy\nproperties. We discuss a tentative scenario to explain the behaviour of the\nentropy and gas mass fraction in the REXCESS sample, in which extra heating and\nmerger mixing maintains an elevated central entropy level in the majority of\nthe population, and a smaller fraction of systems develops a cool core.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 9 figures, A&A, in press.

Here, we are given numbers\n$l_1,\\dots,l_K$ and $n_1,\\dots,n_K$ and we need to find a path that visits at\nleast $n_h$ points within path distance $l_h$ from the starting point for all\n$h\\in\\{1,\\dots,K\\}$. A solution is $\\alpha$-approximate if at least $n_h$\npoints are visited within distance $\\alpha l_h$. It is shown that any algorithm\nthat is $\\alpha$-approximate for \\emph{every constant} $K$ in some metric\nspace, gives an $\\alpha(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation for the TRP in the same\nmetric space. Subsequently, approximation schemes are given for this segmented\nTSP problem in the plane and on weighted trees. The segmented TSP with only one\nsegment ($K=1$) is equivalent to the $k$-TSP for which a\n$(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation is known for a general metric space. Hence, this\napproach through the segmented TSP gives new impulse for improving on the\n3.59-approximation for TRP in a general metric space. A similar reduction\napplies to many other minimum latency problems. To illustrate the strength of\nthis approach we apply it to the well-studied scheduling problem of minimizing\ntotal weighted completion time under precedence constraints, $1|prec|\\sum\nw_{j}C_{j}$, and present a polynomial time approximation scheme for the case of\ninterval order precedence constraints. This improves on the known\n$3/2$-approximation for this problem. Both approximation schemes apply as well\nif release dates are added to the problem.\n"]}]

Using this we show\nhow to compute (i) the Euclidean 1-center of a set of points in $\\IR^2$, and\n(ii) the weighted 1-center and weighted 2-center of a tree network. The running\ntime of all these algorithms are $O(n~poly(\\log n))$. While the result of (i)\ngives a positive answer to an open question asked by Asano, Mulzer, Rote and\nWang in 2011, the technique used can be applied to other problems which admit\nsolutions by prune-and-search paradigm. For example, we can apply the technique\nto solve two and three dimensional linear programming in $O(n~poly(\\log n))$\ntime in this model. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first\nsub-quadratic time algorithms for all the above mentioned problems in the\nconstant-work-space model.

Gelation is induced by crossing the\ngas-liquid phase-separation line and the resulting rapid densification of the\ncolloid-rich phase leads to a sharp change in dynamics and local structure.\nThus, we find that gelation is first-order-like and can occur at much higher\ndensities than previously thought: far from being low-density networks, gels\nhave a clear \"thermodynamic\" definition which nevertheless leads to a\nnon-equilibrium state with a distinct local structure characteristic of a\nrapidly quenched glass. In contrast, approaching the glass transition, the\ndynamics slow continuously accompanied by the emergence of local five-fold\nsymmetric structure. Our findings provide a general thermodynamic, kinetic, and\nstructural basis upon which to distinguish gelation from vitrification.\n","Comment: 12 pages"]}]

This model assumes that the height of the tropical troposphere is\nisobaric. Here problems with this model are identified. A revised relationship\nbetween $p_s$ and $T_a$ is derived governed by two parameters -- the isobaric\nand isothermal heights -- rather than just one. Further insight is provided by\nthe model of R S Lindzen and S Nigam [J. Atmos. Sci. 44 (1987) 2418], which was\nthe first to use the concept of isobaric height to relate tropical $p_s$ to air\ntemperature, and did this by assuming that isobaric height is always around 3\nkm and isothermal height is likewise near constant. Observational data,\npresented here, show that neither of these heights is spatially universal nor\ndo their mean values match previous assumptions. Analyses show that the ratio\nof the long-term changes in $p_s$ and $T_a$ associated with land-sea\ntemperature contrasts in a warming climate -- the focus of Bayr and Dommenget\n[2013] -- is in fact determined by the corresponding ratio of spatial\ndifferences in the annual mean $p_s$ and $T_a$. The latter ratio, reflecting\nlower pressure at higher temperature in the tropics, is dominated by meridional\npressure and temperature differences rather than by land-sea contrasts.\nConsiderations of isobaric heights are shown to be unable to predict either\nspatial or temporal variation in $p_s$. As noted by Bayr and Dommenget [2013],\nthe role of moisture dynamics in generating sea level pressure variation\nremains in need of further theoretical investigations.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 11 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1404.1011"]}]

We found that attributes based on the specificity\ncriterion may improve side effect signalling algorithms but the experiment and\ndosage criteria attributes investigated in this paper did not offer sufficient\nadditional information.\n","Comment: The 26th IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical\n  Systems, Porto, pp. 548 - 549, 2013"]}]

One such improvement is to reduce the Main\nInjector cycle time, by performing slip stacking, previously done in the Main\nInjector, in the now repurposed Recycler Ring. Recycler slip stacking requires\ntwo new RF cavities operating at slightly different frequencies (df = 1260Hz).\nThese are copper, coaxial, quarter wave cavities with R/Q =13 ohms. They\noperate at a peak gap voltage of 150 kV with 150 kW peak drive power (60% duty\nfactor), and are resonant at 52.809 MHz with a 10 kHz tuning range. Two have\nbeen completed and installed.

In this paper, we considerably\nweaken these assumptions in order to allow for the diffusion coefficient to\neven vanish on an open set.\n  As a consequence, it is no longer the case that the effective diffusivity\nmatrix is necessarily non-degenerate. It turns out that, provided that some\nvery weak regularity conditions are met, the range of the effective diffusivity\nmatrix can be read off the shape of the support of the invariant measure for\nthe periodic diffusion. In particular, this gives some easily verifiable\nconditions for the effective diffusivity matrix to be of full rank.
