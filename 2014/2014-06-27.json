First, we compare the stationary\nphase equations in the classical limit for three different non-commutative\nstructures corresponding to the symmetric, Duflo and Freidel-Livine-Majid\nquantization maps. We find that in order to unambiguously recover discrete\ngeometric constraints for non-commutative metric boundary data through the\nstationary phase method, the deformation structure of the phase space must be\naccounted for in the variational calculus. When this is understood, our results\ndemonstrate that the non-commutative metric representation facilitates a\nconvenient semi-classical analysis of the Ponzano-Regge model, which yields as\nthe dominant contribution to the amplitude the cosine of the Regge action in\nagreement with previous studies. We also consider the asymptotics of the ${\\rm\nSU}(2)$ $6j$-symbol using the non-commutative phase space path integral for the\nPonzano-Regge model, and explain the connection of our results to the previous\nasymptotic results in terms of coherent states.\n"]}]

This\nsuggests that new QKD protocols may exist with higher secret key rates and\neffective ranges larger than the metro-area limits of BB84 QKD over optical\nfiber. In this paper we illustrate such a possibility with a new protocol\ncalled Amplified Quantum Key Distribution (AQKD), which will be compatible with\nthe optical amplification typically encountered on inter-city fiber spans. We\nanalyze one instantiation of AQKD, in which the transmitter enclave contains an\noptical amplifier (OA), with security against passive optical tapping. For this\nscenario AQKD is shown to: give three times the secret key rate of BB84 at\nspans up to 100km, increasing to more than a ten-fold gain at 140km; and double\nthe maximum single-span optical fiber transmission range to inter-city\ndistances (300km). Essential to these performance gains is a new\ninformation-theoretic protocol post-processing stage called generalized\nadvantage distillation (GAD). AQKD could be implemented with commercial\noff-the-shelf (COTS) hardware as an augmentation of present-day BB84 QKD.
