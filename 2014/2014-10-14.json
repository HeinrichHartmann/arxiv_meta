The restrictions on the sampled energy density along the\nworldlines of accelerated observers are much weaker than for inertial\nobservers.

A generating function for q-dimensions\nof these spaces is what we suggest to call the primary T-deformation of HOMFLY\npolynomial -- because, as we demonstrate, it can be explicitly reduced to\ncalculations of ordinary HOMFLY polynomials, i.e. to manipulations with quantum\nR-matrices. The second step is a certain minimization of residues of this new\npolynomial with respect to T+1. Minimization is ambiguous and is actually\nspecified by the choice of commuting cut-and-join morphisms, acting along the\nedges of the hypercube -- this promotes it to Abelian quiver, and KR polynomial\nis a Poincare polynomial of associated complex, just in the original Khovanov's\nconstruction at N=2. This second step is still somewhat sophisticated -- though\nincomparably simpler than its conventional matrix-factorization counterpart. In\nthis paper we concentrate on the first step, and provide just a mnemonic\ntreatment of the second step. Still, this is enough to demonstrate that all the\ncurrently known examples of KR polynomials in the fundamental representation\ncan be easily reproduced in this new approach. As additional bonus we get a\nsimple description of the DGR relation between KR polynomials and\nsuperpolynomials and demonstrate that the difference between reduced and\nunreduced cases, which looks essential at KR level, practically disappears\nafter transition to superpolynomials. However, a careful derivation of all\nthese results from cohomologies of cut-and-join morphisms remains for further\nstudies.\n","Comment: 146 pages; some points clarified, some typos corrected"]}]

In order to extract an economically useful amount of power, tens to\nhundreds of tidal turbines need to be placed within an array. The layout of\nthese turbines can have a significant impact on the power extracted and hence\non the viability of the site. Funke et al. formulated the question of the best\nturbine layout as an optimisation problem constrained by the shallow water\nequations and solved it using a local, gradient-based optimisation algorithm.\nGiven the local nature of this approach, the question arises of how optimal the\nlayouts actually are. This becomes particularly important for scenarios with\ncomplex bathymetry and layout constraints, both of which typically introduce\nlocally optimal layouts. Optimisation algorithms which find the global optima\ngenerally require orders of magnitude more iterations than local optimisation\nalgorithms and are thus infeasible in combination with an expensive flow model.\nThis paper presents an analytical wake model to act as an efficient proxy to\nthe shallow water model. Based upon this, a hybrid global-local two-stage\noptimisation approach is presented in which turbine layouts are first optimised\nwith the analytical wake model via a global optimisation algorithm, and further\noptimised with the shallow water model via a local gradient-based optimisation\nalgorithm. This procedure is applied to a number of idealised cases and a more\nrealistic case with complex bathymetry in the Pentland Firth, Scotland. It is\nshown that in cases where bathymetry is considered, the two-stage optimisation\nprocedure is able to improve the power extracted from the array by as much as\n25% compared to local optimisation for idealised scenarios and by as much as\n12% for the more realistic Pentland Firth scenario whilst in many cases\nreducing the overall computation time by approximately 35%.\n","Comment: 36 pages, 21 figures"]}]

As\na result, we introduce a novel AS, Weighted Alignment VotEr (WAVE), which can\noptimize any measures of node and edge conservation, and which can be used with\nany NCF or combination of multiple NCFs. Using WAVE on top of established\nstate-of-the-art NCFs leads to superior alignments compared to the existing\nmethods that optimize only node conservation or only edge conservation or that\ntreat each conserved edge the same.

Biring is algebra which\ndefines on the set two correlated structures of the ring.\n  As in the commutative case, solutions of a system of linear equations build\nup right or left vector space depending on type of system. We study vector\nspaces together with the system of linear equations because their properties\nhave a close relationship. As in a commutative case, the group of automorphisms\nof a vector space has a single transitive representation on a frame manifold.\nThis gives us an opportunity to introduce passive and active representations.\n  Studying a vector space over a division ring uncovers new details in the\nrelationship between passive and active transformations, makes this picture\nclearer.\n  Considering of twin representations of division ring in Abelian group leads\nto the concept of D vector space and their linear map. Based on polyadditive\nmap I considered definition of tensor product of rings and tensor product of D\nvector spaces.\n","Comment: English text - 158 pages; Russian text - 163 pages.
