Because a study of information rates led to the Noiseless\nand Noisy Coding Theorems, two of the most important results of Shannon's\ntheory, we begin the paper by defining a pragmatic information rate, showing\nthat all of the relevant limits make sense, and interpreting them as the\nimprovement in compression obtained from using the correct distribution of\ntransmitted symbols.\n  The first of two applications of the theory extends the information theoretic\nanalysis of the Kelly Criterion, and its generalization, the horse race, to a\nseries of races where the stochastic process of winning horses, payoffs, and\nstrategies depend on some stationary process, including, but not limited to the\nhistory of previous races. If the bettor is receiving messages (side\ninformation) about the probability distribution of winners, the doubling rate\nof the bettor's winnings is bounded by the pragmatic information of the\nmessages.\n  A second application is to the question of market efficiency. An efficient\nmarket is, by definition, a market in which the pragmatic information of the\n\"tradable past\" with respect to current prices is zero. Under this definition,\nmarkets whose returns are characterized by a GARCH(1,1) process cannot be\nefficient.\n  Finally, a pragmatic informational analogue to Shannon's Noisy Coding Theorem\nsuggests that a cause of market inefficiency is that the underlying\nfundamentals are changing so fast that the price discovery mechanism simply\ncannot keep up. This may happen most readily in the run-up to a financial\nbubble, where investors' willful ignorance degrade the information processing\ncapabilities of the market.\n","Comment: Revised to clarify the text"]}]

For definiteness, we bound\nourselves to the case of Lovelock gravities. These theories are known to have\nseveral branches of asymptotically AdS solutions. Here, extending our previous\nwork, we show that phase transitions among some of these branches are driven by\na thermalon configuration: a bubble separating two regions of different\neffective cosmological constants, generically hosting a black hole in the\ninterior. Above some critical temperature, this thermalon configuration is\npreferred with respect to the finite-temperature AdS space, triggering a\nsophisticated version of the Hawking-Page transition. After being created, the\nunstable bubble configuration can in general dynamically change the asymptotic\ncosmological constant. While this phenomenon already occurs in the case of a\ngravity action with square curvature terms, we point out that in the case of\nLovelock theory with cubic (and higher) terms new effects appear. For instance,\nthe theory may admit more than one type of bubble and branches that are in\nprinciple free of pathologies may also decay through the thermalon mechanism.\nWe also find ranges of the gravitational couplings for which the theory becomes\nsick.

Recent\nmultiwavelength observations of Galactic black hole transients show that the\nsituation is not so simple. Fast variability in the OIR band, OIR excesses\nabove the thermal emission and a complicated interplay between the X-ray and\nthe OIR light curves imply that the OIR emitting region is much more compact.\nOne of the popular hypotheses is that the jet contributes to the OIR emission\nand even is responsible for the bulk of the X-rays. However, this scenario is\nlargely ad hoc and is in contradiction with many previously established facts.\nAlternatively, the hot accretion flow, known to be consistent with the X-ray\nspectral and timing data, is also a viable candidate to produce the OIR\nradiation. The hot-flow scenario naturally explains the power-law like OIR\nspectra, fast OIR variability and its complex relation to the X-rays if the hot\nflow contains non-thermal electrons (even in energetically negligible\nquantities), which are required by the presence of the MeV tail in Cyg X-1. The\npresence of non-thermal electrons also lowers the equilibrium electron\ntemperature in the hot flow model to <100 keV, making it more consistent with\nobservations.

To demonstrate the\nfeasibility of our design, the system is simulated and tested on a human face\nimage dataset and its performance is compared with traditional intensity\nthreshold based algorithms. Our system shows both better performance and higher\nnoise tolerance than traditional methods.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 14 figures, the 51th Design Automation Conference 2014, Work\n  in Progress Poster Session"]}]

We\npresent a streamlined proof of Drucker's theorem.\n  An AND-compression is a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm that maps a\nset of SAT-instances $x_1,\\dots,x_t$ to a single SAT-instance $y$ of size\npoly(max $|x_i|$) such that $y$ is satisfiable if and only if all $x_i$ are\nsatisfiable.

Methods. We analyse the full sample of\nMASSIV galaxies for which a metallicity estimate has been possible, that is 48\nstar-forming galaxies at $z\\sim 0.9-1.8$, and compute the integrated values of\nsome fundamental parameters, such as the stellar mass, the metallicity and the\nstar formation rate (SFR). The sample of star-forming galaxies at similar\nredshift from zCOSMOS (P\\'erez-Montero et al. 2013) is also combined with the\nMASSIV sample. We study the cosmic evolution of the mass-metallicty relation\n(MZR) together with the effect of close environment and galaxy kinematics on\nthis relation. We then focus on the so-called fundamental metallicity relation\n(FMR) proposed by Mannucci et al. (2010) and other relations between stellar\nmass, SFR and metallicity as studied by Lara-L\\'opez et al. (2010). We\ninvestigate if these relations are really fundamental, i.e. if they do not\nevolve with redshift. Results. The MASSIV galaxies follow the expected\nmass-metallicity relation for their median redshift. We find however a\nsignificant difference between isolated and interacting galaxies as found for\nlocal galaxies: interacting galaxies tend to have a lower metallicity. The\nstudy of the relation between stellar mass, SFR and metallicity gives such\nlarge scattering for our sample, even combined with zCOSMOS, that it is\ndiffcult to confirm or deny the existence of a fundamental relation.\n"]}]

The mechanisms that form extreme bipolar planetary nebulae remain\nunclear. Aims. The physical properties, structure, and dynamics of the bipolar\nplanetary nebula, MyCn 18, are investigated in detail with the aim of\nunderstanding the shaping mechanism and evolutionary history of this object.\nMethods. VLT infrared images, VLT ISAAC infrared spectra, and long-slit optical\nEchelle spectra are used to investigate MyCn 18. Morpho-kinematic modelling was\nused to firmly constrain the structure and kinematics of the source. A\ntimescale analysis was used to determine the kinematical age of the nebula and\nits main components. Results. A spectroscopic study of MyCn 18's central and\noffset region reveals the detailed make-up of its nebular composition.\nMolecular hydrogen, atomic helium, and Bracket gamma emission are detected from\nthe central regions of MyCn 18. ISAAC spectra from a slit position along the\nnarrow waist of the nebula demonstrate that the ionised gas resides closer to\nthe centre of the nebula than the molecular emission. A kinematical age of the\nnebula and its components were obtained by the P-V arrays and timescale\nanalysis. Conclusions. The structure and kinematics of MyCn 18 are better\nunderstood using an interactive 3-D modelling tool called shape. A dimensional\nand timescale analysis of MyCn 18's major components provides a possible\nmechanism for the nebula's asymmetry. The putative central star is somewhat\noffset from the geometric centre of the nebula, which is thought to be the\nresult of a binary system.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can\nproduce these functional connectomes, however, large amounts of data and\nlengthy computation times add important overhead to this task. Previous work\nhas demonstrated that fMRI data admits a sparse representation in the form a\ndiscrete point-process containing sufficient information for the efficient\nestimation of functional connectivity between all pairs of voxels.

The second is a large database (n=1147) of\nsubjects in which we look at the age-related reorganization of the voxel-wise\nnetwork of functional connections. In both cases it is shown that the proposed\nmethod compares well with standard techniques, despite requiring of the order\nof 1 % of the original fMRI time series.

This approach is very efficient,\nbecause the local detemination of suitable representatives can be carried out\nquickly and independently from each other. Furthermore, based on the scalable\nnumber of the most suitable local representatives, the global clustering can be\ndone very effectively and efficiently.

Motivating examples of partial semimodules include probability\ndistributions, multicommodity capacity constraints, and logical propositions.\nDirected (co)homology theories for such sheaves describes familar constructs on\nnetworks. First homology classifies locally decomposable flows, an orientation\nsheaf over a semiring generalizes directions, connecting maps for homology\nassign values to flows, connecting maps for cohomology assign values to cuts,\nand a Poincare Duality describes a decomposition of flows as local flows over\ncuts. A consequent interpretation of feasible flow-values as a homotopy limit\ngeneralizes MFMC for edge weights in certain ordered monoids [Frieze] and hence\nalso classical MFMC. Certain duality gaps are explained as a failure for\ndirected sheaf (co)homology to satisfy a natural generalization of exactness.\n"]}]
