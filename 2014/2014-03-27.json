In\npractical situation, surfaces obtained from range scanners often have holes\nwhere the 3D models are incomplete. In order to analyze the 3D shapes\neffectively, restoring the incomplete shape by filling in the surface holes is\nnecessary. In this paper, we propose a novel conformal approach to inpaint\nsurface holes on a Riemann surface based on its surface geometry. The basic\nidea is to represent the Riemann surface using its conformal factor and mean\ncurvature. According to Riemann surface theory, a Riemann surface can be\nuniquely determined by its conformal factor and mean curvature up to a rigid\nmotion. Given a Riemann surface $S$, its mean curvature $H$ and conformal\nfactor $\\lambda$ can be computed easily through its conformal parameterization.\nConversely, given $\\lambda$ and $H$, a Riemann surface can be uniquely\nreconstructed by solving the Gauss-Codazzi equation on the conformal parameter\ndomain. Hence, the conformal factor and the mean curvature are two geometric\nquantities fully describing the surface. With this $\\lambda$-$H$ representation\nof the surface, the problem of surface inpainting can be reduced to the problem\nof image inpainting of $\\lambda$ and $H$ on the conformal parameter domain.\nOnce $\\lambda$ and $H$ are inpainted, a Riemann surface can be reconstructed\nwhich effectively restores the 3D surface with missing holes. Since the\ninpainting model is based on the geometric quantities $\\lambda$ and $H$, the\nrestored surface follows the surface geometric pattern. We test the proposed\nalgorithm on synthetic data as well as real surface data.

Surface registration between simple surfaces,\nsuch as simply-connected open surfaces, has been well studied. However, very\nfew works have been carried out for the registration of high-genus surfaces.\nThe high-genus topology of the surface poses great challenge for surface\nregistration. A possible approach is to partition surfaces into\nsimply-connected patches and registration is done patch by patch. Consistent\ncuts are required, which are usually difficult to obtain and prone to error. In\nthis work, we propose an effective way to obtain geometric registration between\nhigh-genus surfaces without introducing consistent cuts. The key idea is to\nconformally parameterize the surface into its universal covering space, which\nis either the Euclidean plane or the hyperbolic disk embedded in\n$\\mathbb{R}^2$. Registration can then be done on the universal covering space\nby minimizing a shape mismatching energy measuring the geometric dissimilarity\nbetween the two surfaces. Our proposed algorithm effectively computes a smooth\nregistration between high-genus surfaces that matches geometric information as\nmuch as possible. The algorithm can also be applied to find a smooth and\nbijective registration minimizing any general energy functionals. Numerical\nexperiments on high-genus surface data show that our proposed method is\neffective for registering high-genus surfaces with geometric matching.

We observe a series of characteristic force spikes when the\npulling force is measured against the cantilever displacement during detachment\nat constant velocity $v_c$ (displacement control mode) and find that the\naverage magnitude of this force increases as $v_c$ grows. The probability\ndistributions of the pulling force and the end-monomer distance from the\nsurface at the moment of final detachment are investigated for different\nadsorption energy $\\epsilon$ and pulling velocity $v_c$. Our extensive\nMD-simulations validate and support the main theoretical findings. Moreover,\nthe simulation reveals a novel behavior: for a strong-friction and massive\ncantilever the force spikes pattern is smeared out at large $v_c$.

However, the use of very large antenna arrays at the base stations\n(BSs) brings new issues, such as the significantly increased hardware and\nsignal processing costs. In order to reap the enormous gain of massive MIMO and\nyet reduce its cost to an affordable level, this paper proposes a novel system\ndesign by integrating an electromagnetic (EM) lens with the large antenna\narray, termed the EM-lens enabled MIMO. The EM lens has the capability of\nfocusing the power of an incident wave to a small area of the antenna array,\nwhile the location of the focal area varies with the angle of arrival (AoA) of\nthe wave. Therefore, in practical scenarios where the arriving signals from\ngeographically separated users have different AoAs, the EM-lens enabled system\nprovides two new benefits, namely energy focusing and spatial interference\nrejection. By taking into account the effects of imperfect channel estimation\nvia pilot-assisted training, in this paper we analytically show that the\naverage received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in both the single-user and\nmultiuser uplink transmissions can be strictly improved by the EM-lens enabled\nsystem.

B 84, 201308(R) (2011), an isolated Majorana\nstate bound to one edge of a long enough Kitaev chain in the topological phase\nand connected to a quantum dot, results in a robust transmittance of $1/2$ at\nzero-bias. In this work, we show that the removal of such a hallmark can be\nachieved by using a metallic surface hosting two adatoms in a scenario where\nthere is a lack of symmetry in the Fano effect, which is feasible by coupling\nthe Kitaev chain to one of these adatoms. Thus in order to detect this feature\nexperimentally, one should apply the following two-stage procedure: (i) first,\nattached to the adatoms, one has to lock AFM tips in opposite gate voltages\n(symmetric detuning of the levels) and measure by an STM tip, the zero-bias\nconductance; (ii) thereafter, the measurement of the conductance is repeated\nwith the gates swapped. For the absolute value of the detuning away from the\nFermi energy and in the case of strong coupling tip-host, this approach reveals\nin the transmittance, a persistent dip placed at zero-bias and immune to the\naforementioned permutation, but characterized by an amplitude that fluctuates\nslightly around $1/2$. However, in the case of a tip acting as a probe, the\nadatom decoupled from the Kitaev chain becomes completely inert and no\nfluctuation is observed. Therefore, the STM tip must be considered in the same\nfooting as the \"host+adatoms\" system. As a result, we have found that despite\nthe small difference between these two Majorana dips, the zero-bias\ntransmittance as a function of the symmetric detuning yields two distinct\nbehaviors, in which one of them is unpredictable by the standard Fano's theory.\nTherefore, to access such a non trivial pattern of Fano interference, the\nhypothesis of the STM tip acting as a probe should be discarded.\n"]}]
