An inductive dissection algorithm is developed for constructing such a\nbijection. We prove that the algorithm is correct and then analyze its\ncomplexity.

Slavemaking ants are social parasites that exploit workers of\nanother species to rear their offspring.

We use a simple mathematical model to examine whether the\nsmall-scale population structure of the host species could explain the\nevolution of this potentially altruistic defence trait against slavemaking\nants. We find that this is the case if enslaved host workers are related to\nnearby host nests. In a population genetic study we confirm that enslaved\nworkers are, indeed, more closely related to host nests within the raiding\nrange of their resident slavemaker nest, than to host nests outside the raiding\nrange. This small-scale population structure seems to be a result of polydomy\n(e.g. the occupation of several nests in close proximity by a single colony)\nand could have enabled the evolution of 'rebellion' by kin selection.\n","Comment: This manuscript was reviewed at Peerage of Science.

The\nsimulations predict a slightly steeper wavefront towards East than towards\nWest, but this asymmetry is negligible against the measurement uncertainties of\nLOPES. At axis distances $\\gtrsim 50\\,$m, the wavefront can be approximated by\na simple cone. According to the simulations, the cone angle is clearly\ncorrelated with the shower maximum. Thus, we confirm earlier predictions that\narrival time measurements can be used to study the longitudinal shower\ndevelopment, but now using a realistic wavefront. Moreover, we show that the\nhyperbolic wavefront is compatible with our measurement, and we present several\nexperimental indications that the cone angle is indeed sensitive to the shower\ndevelopment. Consequently, the wavefront can be used to statistically study the\nprimary composition of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. At LOPES, the\nexperimentally achieved precision for the shower maximum is limited by\nmeasurement uncertainties to approximately $140\\,$g/cm$^2$. But the simulations\nindicate that under better conditions this method might yield an accuracy for\nthe atmospheric depth of the shower maximum, $X_\\mathrm{max}$, better than\n$30\\,$g/cm$^2$. This would be competitive with the established air-fluorescence\nand air-Cherenkov techniques, where the radio technique offers the advantage of\na significantly higher duty-cycle. Finally, the hyperbolic wavefront can be\nused to reconstruct the shower geometry more accurately, which potentially\nallows a better reconstruction of all other shower parameters, too.\n","Comment: accepted by JCAP"]}]

The introduction of dilaton field generates the anisotropy in\nboundary spatial directions. In analogy of isotropic case, we have two black\nhole solutions below certain critical temperature $T_c$, the anisotropic\ncharged black hole with and without scalar hair, corresponding respectively to\nthe supercooled normal phase and superconducting phase in the boundary theory.\nWe observe a nonlinear evolution from a supercooled anisotropic black hole\nwithout scalar hair to a anisotropic hairy black hole. Via AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence, we extract time evolution of the condensate operator, which\nshows an exponential growth and subsequent saturation, similar to the isotropic\ncase. Furthermore, we obtain a nontrivial time evolution of the boundary\npressure, while in isotropic case it remains a constant. We also generalize\nquasinormal modes calculation to anisotropic black holes and shows scalar\nquasinormal modes match with relaxation time scale of the condensate operator.\nIn addition, we present the final temperature and anisotropic pressure as\nfunctions of initial temperature and background anisotropy.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 12 figures. v2: minor revision and references added"]}]

Linear polarization data reveal the properties\nof the dust grains in the distinct phases of the interstellar medium. Our goal\nis to investigate how the polarization degree and angle correlate with the\ncloud and core gas. We use optical, near infrared and submillimeter\npolarization observations toward the starless object Pipe-109 in the Pipe\nnebula. Our data cover a physical scale range of 0.08 to 0.4 pc, comprising the\ndense gas, envelope and the surrounding cloud. The cloud polarization is well\ntraced by the optical data. The near infrared polarization is produced by a\nmixed population of grains from the core border and the cloud gas. The optical\nand near infrared polarization toward the cloud reach the maximum possible\nvalue and saturate with respect to the visual extinction. The core polarization\nis predominantly traced by the submillimeter data and have a steep decrease\nwith respect to the visual extinction. Modeling of the submillimeter\npolarization indicates a magnetic field main direction projected onto the\nplane-of-sky and loss of grain alignment for densities higher than\n$6\\times10^4$ cm$^{-3}$ (or $A_V > 30$ mag). Pipe-109 is immersed in a\nmagnetized medium, with a very ordered magnetic field. The absence of internal\nsource of radiation significantly affects the polarization efficiencies in the\ncore, creating a polarization hole at the center of the starless core. This\nresult supports the theory of dust grain alignment via radiative torques.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in A&A Letters"]}]

The development of high-contrast imaging techniques in\nthe past 20 years is now allowing the detection of faint material around bright\nstars with high angular resolution, hence opening an avenue to study in detail\nthe structures of circumstellar disks and their relation to planetary\nformation.\n  Aims. The purpose of this paper is to revisit the morphology of the almost\nedge-on debris disk around HD 15115.\n  Methods. We analyzed data from the Gemini science archive obtained in 2009\nand 2011 with the Near-Infrared Coronagraphic Imager instrument in the H and Ks\nbands using coronagraphy and angular differential imaging tech- niques.\n  Results. We resolved the disk in both the H and Ks bands.

We\nwere able to detect the bow-like shape of the disk suspected from other\nobservations.

The inner part is likely depleted of\ndust. The fainter side of the disk is suspected but not firmly detected, which\nalso indicates a large anisotropic scattering factor.\n  Conclusions. The morphological symmetry of the disk contrasts with the\nobvious brightness asymmetry. This asymmetry may be explained by the\ncoexistence of several types of grains in this disk and/or variable dust\ndensity.

For the near detector, a high-pressure gas TPC\nembedded in a calorimeter and a magnet is the baseline design.

The\ndynamic nature of the environment causes previous knowledge of how agents\ninteract to become outdated.

In\nexaptation, a trait that originally evolved to solve one problem is co-opted to\nsolve a new problem; thus the trait or traits in question must be necessary and\nsufficient to solve the new problem. Sol claims that traits such as persistence\nand neophilia, are necessary and sufficient for animal innovation, which is a\nmatter of trial and error. We suggest that this explanation does not extend to\nhuman innovation, which involves strategy, logic, intuition, and insight, and\nrequires traits that evolved, not as a byproduct of some other function, but\nfor the purpose of coming up with adaptive responses to environmental\nvariability itself. We point to an agent based model that indicates the\nfeasibility of two such proposed traits: (1) chaining, the ability to construct\ncomplex thoughts from simple ones, and (2) contextual focus, the ability to\nshift between convergent and divergent modes of thought. We agree that there is\na sense in which innovation is exaptation--it occurs when an existing object or\nbehaviour is adapted to new needs or tastes--and refer to a mathematical model\nof biological and cultural exaltation.
