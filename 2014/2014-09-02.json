The first step\nin segmentation is to remove intrusive objects such as stain debris and other\nnoises. The next step is detection of touching and overlapping chromosomes, and\nthe final step is separation of such chromosomes. Common methods for separation\nbetween touching chromosomes are interactive and require human intervention for\ncorrect separation between touching and overlapping chromosomes. In this paper,\na geometric-based method is used for automatic detection of touching and\noverlapping chromosomes and separating them. The proposed scheme performs\nsegmentation in two phases. In the first phase, chromosome clusters are\ndetected using three geometric criteria, and in the second phase, chromosome\nclusters are separated using a cut-line. Most of earlier methods did not work\nproperly in case of chromosome clusters that contained more than two\nchromosomes. Our method, on the other hand, is quite efficient in separation of\nsuch chromosome clusters. At each step, one separation will be performed and\nthis algorithm is repeated until all individual chromosomes are separated.\nAnother important point about the proposed method is that it uses the geometric\nfeatures of chromosomes which are independent of the type of images and it can\neasily be applied to any type of images such as binary images and does not\nrequire multispectral images as well.

The topological spin $\\theta_a=2\\pi h_a$ is an\nimportant property of a topological quasi-particle, which is the Berry phase\nobtained in the adiabatic self-rotation of the quasi-particle by $2\\pi$. For\nchiral topological states with robust chiral edge states, another fundamental\ntopological property is the edge state chiral central charge $c$. In this paper\nwe propose a new approach to compute the topological spin and chiral central\ncharge in lattice models by defining a new quantity named as the momentum\npolarization. Momentum polarization is defined on the cylinder geometry as a\nuniversal subleading term in the average value of a \"partial translation\noperator\". We show that the momentum polarization is a quantum entanglement\nproperty which can be computed from the reduced density matrix, and our\nanalytic derivation based on edge conformal field theory shows that the\nmomentum polarization measures the combination $h_a-\\frac{c}{24}$ of\ntopological spin and central charge.

We focus on STDMA (Spatial\nReuse TDMA)) scheduling, where a predefined cycle is repeated, and where each\nnode has fixed transmission opportunities during specific slots (defined by\ncolors). We assume a STDMA algorithm that takes advantage of the regularity of\ngrid topology to also provide a spatially periodic coloring (\"tiling\" of the\nsame color pattern). In this setting, the key challenges are: 1) minimizing the\naverage routing delay by ordering the slots in the cycle 2) being energy\nefficient. Our work follows two directions: first, the baseline performance is\nevaluated when nothing specific is done and the colors are randomly ordered in\nthe STDMA cycle. Then, we propose a solution, ORCHID that deliberately\nconstructs an efficient STDMA schedule. It proceeds in two steps. In the first\nstep, ORCHID starts form a colored grid and builds a hierarchical routing based\non these colors. In the second step, ORCHID builds a color ordering, by\nconsidering jointly both routing and scheduling so as to ensure that any node\nwill reach a sink in a single STDMA cycle. We study the performance of these\nsolutions by means of simulations and modeling. Results show the excellent\nperformance of ORCHID in terms of delays and energy compared to a shortest path\nrouting that uses the delay as a heuristic. We also present the adaptation of\nORCHID to general networks under the SINR interference model.\n"]}]

Specifically, in the\nscenarios presented here, its movement permanently deviates from the desired\ntrajectory. To address this problem, we extend the single chaotic CPG to\nmultiple CPGs with learning. The learning mechanism is based on a simulated\nannealing algorithm. In a normal situation, the CPGs synchronize and their\ndynamics are identical. With leg malfunction or disability, the CPGs lose\nsynchronization leading to independent dynamics.

Recently there is\nan increasing interest on the use of mobile anchors for localizing sensors.\nMost of the works available in the literature either looks into the aspect of\nreducing path length of mobile anchor or tries to increase localization\naccuracy. The challenge is to design a movement strategy for a mobile anchor\nthat reduces path length while meeting the requirements of a good range-free\nlocalization technique. In this paper we propose two cost-effective movement\nstrategies i.e., path planning for a mobile anchor so that localization can be\ndone using the localization scheme \\cite{Lee2009}. In one strategy we use a\nhexagonal movement pattern for the mobile anchor to localize all sensors inside\na bounded rectangular region with lesser movement compared to the existing\nworks in literature. In other strategy we consider a connected network in an\nunbounded region where the mobile anchor moves in the hexagonal pattern to\nlocalize the sensors. In this approach, we guarantee localization of all\nsensors within $r/2$ error-bound where $r$ is the communication range of the\nmobile anchor and sensors.

In this paper, we present the SSELab, a\nframework for web- based project portals that attempts to migrate more software\ndevelopment tools from desktop to server environments, but still allows their\nintegration into modern desktop IDEs. It supports the deployment of tools as\nhosted services using plug-in systems on the server-side. Additionally, it\nprovides access to these tools by a set of clients that can be used in\ndifferent contexts, either from the command line, from within IDEs such as\nEclipse, or from web pages. In the paper, we discuss the architecture and the\nextensibility of the SSELab framework. Furthermore, we share our experiences\nwith creating an instance of the framework and integrating various tools for\nour own software development projects.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 5 figures.
