Present days models of\nradially pulsating stars assume radial symmetry and have the\npulsation-convection interaction included via model equations containing ad hoc\nclosures and moreover parameters whose values are barely known. We intend to\nconstruct ever more realistic multidimensional models of Cepheids. In the\npresent paper, the first of a series, we describe the basic numerical approach\nand how it is motivated by physical properties of these objects which are\nsometimes more, sometimes less obvious. - For the construction of appropriate\nmodels a polar grid co-moving with the mean radial velocity has been introduced\nto optimize radial resolution throughout the different pulsation phases. The\ngrid is radially stretched to account for the change of spatial scales due to\nvertical stratification and a new grid refinement scheme is introduced to\nresolve the upper, hydrogen ionisation zone where the gradient of temperature\nis steepest. We demonstrate that the simulations are not conservative when the\noriginal weighted essentially non-oscillatory method implemented in ANTARES is\nused and derive a new scheme which allows a conservative time evolution. The\nnumerical approximation of diffusion follows the same principles. Moreover, the\nradiative transfer solver has been modified to improve the efficiency of\ncalculations on parallel computers. We show that with these improvements the\nANTARES code can be used for realistic simulations of the convection-pulsation\ninteraction in Cepheids.

Generalizing the counitality of a comodule to the\nmultiplier setting, we consider the particular class of so-called full\ncomodules.

We propose an\napproach to this problem and describe the underlying theory, based on the\nunsupervised, automatic learning of a ``good'' representation for supervised\nlearning, characterized by small sample complexity ($n$).

The\nstarting point is the conjecture, proved in specific cases, that image\nrepresentations which are invariant to translations, scaling and other\ntransformations can considerably reduce the sample complexity of learning. We\nprove that an invariant and unique (discriminative) signature can be computed\nfor each image patch, $I$, in terms of empirical distributions of the\ndot-products between $I$ and a set of templates stored during unsupervised\nlearning. A module performing filtering and pooling, like the simple and\ncomplex cells described by Hubel and Wiesel, can compute such estimates.\nHierarchical architectures consisting of this basic Hubel-Wiesel moduli inherit\nits properties of invariance, stability, and discriminability while capturing\nthe compositional organization of the visual world in terms of wholes and\nparts. The theory extends existing deep learning convolutional architectures\nfor image and speech recognition. It also suggests that the main computational\ngoal of the ventral stream of visual cortex is to provide a hierarchical\nrepresentation of new objects/images which is invariant to transformations,\nstable, and discriminative for recognition---and that this representation may\nbe continuously learned in an unsupervised way during development and visual\nexperience.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 10 figures.

The\nflavor changing neutral Higgs (FCNH) effects in the minimal version of this\nmodel (LRSM), however, push the second Higgs mass to more than 15 TeV making it\ninaccessible at the LHC. Furthermore since the second Higgs mass is directly\nlinked to the $W_R$ mass, discovery of a \"low\" mass $W_R$ ($M_{W_R}\\leq 5-6$\nTeV) at the LHC would require values for some Higgs self couplings larger than\none.

It is then possible to search for these heavier Higgs\nbosons at the LHC, without conflicting with FCNH constraints. A right handed\n$W_R$ mass in the few TeV range is quite natural in this class of models\nwithout having to resort to large scalar coupling parameters.

Furthermore, it is shown that no POVM exists, which approximately\nagrees with the probability current on a very natural set of wave functions;\nnevertheless, the choice of the set is crucial, and on more restrictive sets\nthe probability current does provide a good arrival time prediction. Some ideas\nto experimentally detect quantum effects in time measurements are discussed.\n  In the second part of the work the energy-time uncertainty relation is\nconsidered, in particular for a model of alpha decay for which the variance of\nthe energy can be calculated explicitly, and the variance of time can be\nestimated. This estimate is tight for systems with long lifetimes, in which\ncase the uncertainty relation is shown to be satisfied.

Combining several\nsimulations in any predetermined range of frequencies, at any resolution, we\ninvestigate the dispersion relations for different kinds of magnonic crystals:\na dot array, an antidot array, and a bicomponent film.
