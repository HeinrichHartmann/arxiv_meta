The\ndynamics of these condensations falling in the solar corona is investigated in\nthis paper using a simple fully ionised plasma model. We find that the presence\nof a heavy condensation gives rise to a dynamical rearrangement of the coronal\npressure that results in the formation of a large pressure gradient that\nopposes gravity. Eventually this pressure gradient becomes so large that the\nblob acceleration vanishes or even points upwards. Then, the blob descent is\ncharacterised by an initial acceleration phase followed by an essentially\nconstant velocity phase.

Both the duration of the first\nstage and the velocity attained by the blob increase for larger values of the\nratio of blob to coronal density, for larger blob mass, and for smaller coronal\ntemperature. Dense blobs are characterised by a detectable density growth (up\nto 60% in our calculations) and by a steepening of the density in their lower\npart, that could lead to the formation of a shock.
