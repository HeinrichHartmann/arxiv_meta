The walking algorithm\nused here aims to select a subset of push recovery problem i.e. disturbance\nfrom environment. We applied the physics at each joint of Halo with some degree\nof freedom. The proposed model, Halo is different from other models as\npreviously developed model were inconsistent with data for different persons.\nThis would lead to development of the generalized biped model in future and\nwill bridge the gap between performance and inconsistency. In this paper the\nproposed model is applied to data of different persons. Accuracy of model,\nperformance and result is measured using the behavior negotiation capability of\nmodel developed. In order to improve the performance, proposed model gives the\nfreedom to handle each joint independently based on the belongingness value for\neach joint. The development can be considered as important development for\nfuture world of robotics. The accuracy of model is 70% in one go.\n"]}]
