A divergent behavior of the real and the\nimaginary part of the AC susceptibility and a sharp increase of the DC\nmagnetization was observed at $T^*$, indicating the magnetic phase transition\nat $T^*$.

These\nmodels extend spatially the static stability models adopted in geotechnical\nengineering, and adopt an infinite-slope geometry to balance the resisting and\nthe driving forces acting on the sliding mass. An infiltration model is used to\ndetermine how rainfall changes pore-water conditions, modulating the local\nstability/instability conditions. A problem with the operation of the existing\nmodels lays in the difficulty in obtaining accurate values for the several\nvariables that describe the material properties of the slopes. The problem is\nparticularly severe when the models are applied over large areas, for which\nsufficient information on the geotechnical and hydrological conditions of the\nslopes is not generally available. To help solve the problem, we propose a\nprobabilistic Monte Carlo approach to the distributed modeling of\nrainfall-induced shallow landslides. For the purpose, we have modified the\nTransient Rainfall Infiltration and Grid-Based Regional Slope-Stability\nAnalysis (TRIGRS) code. The new code (TRIGRS-P) adopts a probabilistic approach\nto compute, on a cell-by-cell basis, transient pore-pressure changes and\nrelated changes in the factor of safety due to rainfall infiltration.\nInfiltration is modeled using analytical solutions of partial differential\nequations describing one-dimensional vertical flow in isotropic, homogeneous\nmaterials. Both saturated and unsaturated soil conditions can be considered.\nTRIGRS-P copes with the natural variability inherent to the mechanical and\nhydrological properties of the slope materials by allowing values of the TRIGRS\nmodel input parameters to be sampled randomly from a given probability\ndistribution.

When scaling up\nthe quantum registers in such devices, several challenges arise: individual\naddressing of qubits in a dense spectrum while suppressing crosstalk, creation\nof entanglement between distant nodes, and decoupling from unwanted\ninteractions. The experimental implementation of optimal control is a\nprerequisite to meeting these challenges. Using engineered microwave pulses, we\nexperimentally demonstrate optimal control of a prototype solid state spin\nqubit system comprising thirty six energy levels. The spin qubits are\nassociated with proximal nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. We\ndemonstrate precise single-electron spin qubit operations with an unprecedented\nfidelity F \\approx 0.99 in combination with high-efficiency storage of electron\nspin states in a nuclear spin quantum memory. Matching single-electron spin\noperations with spin-echo techniques, we further realize high-quality entangled\nstates (F > 0.82) between two electron spins on demand. After exploiting\noptimal control, the fidelity is mostly limited by the coherence time and\nimperfect initialization. Errors from crosstalk in a crowded spectrum of 8\nlines as well as detrimental effects from active dipolar couplings have been\nsimultaneously eliminated to unprecedented extent. Finally, by entanglement\nswapping to nuclear spins, nuclear spin entanglement over a length scale of 25\nnm is demonstrated.

Nonlocal correlations could, however, be even more\nnonlocal than quantum theory allows, while still complying with basic physical\nprinciples such as no-signaling. So why is quantum mechanics not as nonlocal as\nit could be? Are there other physical or information-theoretic principles which\nprohibit this? So far, the proposed answers to this question have been only\npartially successful, partly because they are lacking genuinely multipartite\nformulations. In Nat. Comm. 4, 2263 (2013) we introduced the principle of Local\nOrthogonality (LO), an intrinsically multipartite principle which is satisfied\nby quantum mechanics but is violated by non-physical correlations.\n  Here we further explore the LO principle, presenting new results and\nexplaining some of its subtleties. In particular, we show that the set of\nno-signaling boxes satisfying LO is closed under wirings, present a\nclassification of all LO inequalities in certain scenarios, show that all\nextremal tripartite boxes with two binary measurements per party violate LO,\nand explain the connection between LO inequalities and unextendible product\nbases.\n","Comment: Typos corrected; data files uploaded"]}]

A small fraction of\nthese stars shows dipole modes with unexpectedly low amplitudes. The reduction\nin amplitude is more pronounced for stars with higher frequency of maximum\npower. In this work we want to characterize KIC 8561221 in order to confirm\nthat it is currently the least evolved star among this peculiar subset and to\ndiscuss several hypotheses that could help explain the reduction of the dipole\nmode amplitudes. We used Kepler short- and long-cadence data combined with\nspectroscopic observations to infer the stellar structure and dynamics of KIC\n8561221. We then discussed different scenarios that could contribute to the\nreduction of the dipole amplitudes such as a fast rotating interior or the\neffect of a magnetic field on the properties of the modes. We also performed a\ndetailed study of the inertia and damping of the modes. We have been able to\ncharacterize 37 oscillations modes, in particular, a few dipole modes above\nnu_max that exhibit nearly normal amplitudes. We have inferred a surface\nrotation period of around 91 days and uncovered the existence of a variation in\nthe surface magnetic activity during the last 4 years. As expected, the\ninternal regions of the star probed by the l = 2 and 3 modes spin 4 to 8 times\nfaster than the surface. With our grid of standard models we are able to\nproperly fit the observed frequencies. Our model calculation of mode inertia\nand damping give no explanation for the depressed dipole modes.

They could\nseem to be in contradiction with natural selection, as non-cooperators have an\nincreased fitness compared to cooperators. Understanding the emergence of\ncooperation has necessitated the development of concepts and models (inclusive\nfitness, multilevel selection, ...) attributing deterministic advantages to\nthis behavior. In contrast to these models, we show here that cooperative\nbehaviors can emerge by taking into account the stochastic nature of\nevolutionary dynamics : when cooperative behaviors increase the carrying\ncapacity of the habitat, they also increase the genetic drift against\nnon-cooperators. Using the Wright-Fisher models of population genetics, we\ncompute exactly this increased genetic drift and its consequences on the\nfixation probability of both types of individuals. This computation leads to a\nsimple criterion: cooperative behavior dominates when the relative increase in\ncarrying capacity of the habitat caused by cooperators is higher than the\nselection pressure against them. This is a purely stochastic effect with no\ndeterministic interpretation.\n"]}]

It is a contribution to categorical logic,\nin particular to the theory of realizability toposes.\n  While the tools of categorical logic have proven very successful in analyzing\nand organizing proof theoretic realizability interpretations, it was remarked\nby experts (notably Peter Johnstone) that the field of realizability toposes\nitself was not clearly delineated, and lacked a powerful theory analogous to\nthat of Grothendieck toposes.\n  The present work sets out to remedy this situation to a certain extent. We\nargue that realizability toposes are best understood using Grothendieck\nfibrations, and develop a framework of fibrational cocompletions, which allows\nto view certain constructions from realizability in precise analogy to\nconstructions of presheaf and sheaf toposes. Using these techniques, and a\nclass of posetal fibrations that we call uniform preorders, we are able to give\nan extensional characterization of partial combinatory algebras and of the\nrealizability toposes that are constructed from these algebras.\n  Striving to develop the analogy to Grothendieck toposes further, we outline\nhow to apply our techniques on arbitrary base toposes, and give a decomposition\ntheorem for constant objects functors induced by triposes, analogous to the\nknown decompositions of geometric morphisms. Finally, we sketch an approach of\nhow to find a unified framework for Grothendieck toposes and realizability\ntoposes, based on the observation that uniform preorders can be identified with\npreorders internal to a category of sheaves.\n"]}]
