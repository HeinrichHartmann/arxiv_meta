Based on this model,\nthe microscopic quantum structure of Schwarzschild black hole and quantum\nstatistical origin of its gravity are studied. The cutoff of black hole horizon\nleads to Casimir effect inside the horizon. This effect makes the inside vacuum\nhas less zero quantum fluctuation energy than that of outside vacuum and the\nspin 1/2 radiation hole excitations are resulted inside the horizon. The mean\nenergy of the radiation hole excitations is related to the temperature decrease\nof the Hawking-Unruh type by the period law of the Fermion temperature greens\nfunction and a temperature difference as well as gravity are created on the\nhorizon. A dual relation of the gravity potentials between inside and outside\nregions of the black hole is found. An attractor behaviour of the horizon\nsurface is unveiled. The gravity potential inside the black hole is linear in\nradial coordinate and no singularity exists at the origin of the black hole, in\ncontrast to the conventional conjecture. All the particles absorbed by the\nblack hole have fallen down to the horizon and converted into spin 1/2\nradiation quanta with the mean energy related to the Hawking-Unruh temperature,\nthe thermodynamic equilibrium and the mechanical balance make the radiation\nquanta be tightly bound in the horizon. The gravitation mass $2M$ and physical\nmass $M$ of the black hole are calculated. The calculated entropy of the black\nhole is well consistent with Hawking. Outside the horizon, there exist\nthermodynamic non-equilibrium and mechanical non-balance which lead to an\noutward centrifugal energy flow and an inward gravitation energy flow. The lost\nvacuum energy in the negative gravitation potential region has been removed to\nthe black hole surface to form a spherical Planckon shell with the thickness of\nPlanckon diameter so that energy conservation is guaranteed.\n","Comment: 22 pages, revised version"]}]

HFI photometric calibration and mapmaking"],"description":["  This paper describes the processing applied to the HFI cleaned time-ordered\ndata to produce photometrically calibrated maps. HFI observes the sky over a\nbroad range of frequencies, from 100 to 857 GHz. To get the best accuracy on\nthe calibration on such a large range, two different photometric calibration\nschemes have to be used. The 545 and 857 \\GHz\\ data are calibrated using Uranus\nand Neptune flux density measurements, compared with models of their\natmospheric emissions to calibrate the data. The lower frequencies (below 353\nGHz) are calibrated using the cosmological microwave background dipole.One of\nthe components of this anisotropy results from the orbital motion of the\nsatellite in the Solar System, and is therefore time-variable. Photometric\ncalibration is thus tightly linked to mapmaking, which also addresses low\nfrequency noise removal. The 2013 released HFI data show some evidence for\napparent gain variations of the HFI bolometers' detection chain. These\nvariations were identified by comparing observations taken more than one year\napart in the same configuration. We developed an effective correction to limit\nits effect on calibration, and assess its accuracy. We present several methods\nused to estimate the precision of the photometric calibration. We distinguish\nrelative (from one detector to another, or from one frequency to another) and\nabsolute uncertainties. In both cases, we found that these uncertainties range\nfrom a few $10^{-3}$ to several per cents from 100 to 857 GHz. We describe the\npipeline producing the maps from the HFI timelines, based on the photometric\ncalibration parameters and we detail the scheme used to a posteriori set the\nzero level of the maps. We also briefly discuss the cross-calibration between\nHFI and the SPIRE instrument on board Herschel. We finally summarize the basic\ncharacteristics of the set of the HFI maps from the 2013 Planck data release.\n","Comment: Submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics. 25 pages, 25 figures, 14\n  tables. high resolution version available from the ESA website :\n  http://www.sciops.esa.int/index.php?project=PLANCK&page=Planck_Published_Papers\n  (21/01/14) New version with referee's comments resubmitteed to AA"]}]

Component separation"],"description":["  Planck has produced detailed all-sky observations over nine frequency bands\nbetween 30 and 857 GHz. These observations allow robust reconstruction of the\nprimordial cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature fluctuations over\nnearly the full sky, as well as new constraints on Galactic foregrounds. This\npaper describes the component separation framework adopted by Planck. We test\nfour foreground-cleaned CMB maps derived using qualitatively different\ncomponent separation algorithms. The quality of our reconstructions is\nevaluated through detailed simulations and internal comparisons, and shown\nthrough various tests to be internally consistent and robust for CMB power\nspectrum and cosmological parameter estimation up to l = 2000. The parameter\nconstraints on LambdaCDM cosmologies derived from these maps are consistent\nwith those presented in the cross-spectrum based Planck likelihood analysis. We\nchoose two of the CMB maps for specific scientific goals. We also present maps\nand frequency spectra of the Galactic low-frequency, CO, and thermal dust\nemission. The component maps are found to provide a faithful representation of\nthe sky, as evaluated by simulations. For the low-frequency component, the\nspectral index varies widely over the sky, ranging from about beta = -4 to -2.\nConsidering both morphology and prior knowledge of the low frequency\ncomponents, the index map allows us to associate a steep spectral index (beta <\n-3.2) with strong anomalous microwave emission, corresponding to a spinning\ndust spectrum peaking below 20 GHz, a flat index of beta > -2.3 with strong\nfree-free emission, and intermediate values with synchrotron emission.\n","Comment: 31 pages, 32 figures, submitted to A&A"]}]

Two different component separation methods are used to extract\nthe CO maps from Planck HFI data. The maps obtained are then compared to one\nanother and to existing external CO surveys. From these quality checks the best\nCO maps in terms of signal to noise and/or residual foreground contamination\nare selected. Three sets of velocity-integrated CO emission maps are produced:\nType 1 maps of the CO (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2) rotational transitions with low\nforeground contamination but moderate signal-to-noise ratio; Type 2 maps for\nthe (1-0) and (2-1) transitions with a better signal-to-noise ratio; and one\nType 3 map, a line composite map with the best signal-to-noise ratio in order\nto locate the faintest molecular regions. The maps are described in detail.\nThey are shown to be fully compatible with previous surveys of parts of the\nGalactic Plane and also of fainter regions out of the Galactic plane. The\nPlanck HFI velocity-integrated CO maps for the (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2)\nrotational transitions provide an unprecedented all-sky CO view of the Galaxy.\nThese maps are also of great interest to monitor potential CO contamination on\nCMB \\Planck\\ studies.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 17 figures"]}]

Planets, minor bodies, and diffuse interplanetary dust\nemission (IPD) are all observed.

We use the Planck data to\ninvestigate the behaviour of zodiacal emission over the whole sky at\nsub-millimetre and millimetre wavelengths. We fit the Planck data to find the\nemissivities of the various components of the COBE zodiacal model -- a diffuse\ncloud, three asteroidal dust bands, a circumsolar ring, and an Earth-trailing\nfeature. The emissivity of the diffuse cloud decreases with increasing\nwavelength, as expected from earlier analyses. The emissivities of the dust\nbands, however, decrease less rapidly, indicating that the properties of the\ngrains in the bands are different from those in the diffuse cloud. We fit the\nsmall amount of Galactic emission seen through the telescope's far sidelobes,\nand place limits on possible contamination of the CMB results from both\nzodiacal and far-sidelobe emission. When necessary, the results are used in the\nPlanck pipeline to make maps with zodiacal emission and far sidelobes removed.\nWe show that the zodiacal correction to the CMB maps is small compared to the\nPlanck CMB temperature power spectrum and give a list of flux densities for\nsmall Solar System bodies.\n"]}]

CMB power spectra and likelihood"],"description":["  We present the Planck likelihood, a complete statistical description of the\ntwo-point correlation function of the CMB temperature fluctuations. We use this\nlikelihood to derive the Planck CMB power spectrum over three decades in l,\ncovering 2 <= l <= 2500. The main source of error at l <= 1500 is cosmic\nvariance. Uncertainties in small-scale foreground modelling and instrumental\nnoise dominate the error budget at higher l's. For l < 50, our likelihood\nexploits all Planck frequency channels from 30 to 353 GHz through a physically\nmotivated Bayesian component separation technique. At l >= 50, we employ a\ncorrelated Gaussian likelihood approximation based on angular cross-spectra\nderived from the 100, 143 and 217 GHz channels. We validate our likelihood\nthrough an extensive suite of consistency tests, and assess the impact of\nresidual foreground and instrumental uncertainties on cosmological parameters.\nWe find good internal agreement among the high-l cross-spectra with residuals\nof a few uK^2 at l <= 1000. We compare our results with foreground-cleaned CMB\nmaps, and with cross-spectra derived from the 70 GHz Planck map, and find broad\nagreement in terms of spectrum residuals and cosmological parameters. The\nbest-fit LCDM cosmology is in excellent agreement with preliminary Planck\npolarisation spectra. The standard LCDM cosmology is well constrained by Planck\nby l <= 1500. For example, we report a 5.4 sigma deviation from n_s /= 1.\nConsidering various extensions beyond the standard model, we find no indication\nof significant departures from the LCDM framework. Finally, we report a tension\nbetween the best-fit LCDM model and the low-l spectrum in the form of a power\ndeficit of 5-10% at l <~ 40, significant at 2.5-3 sigma. We do not elaborate\nfurther on its cosmological implications, but note that this is our most\npuzzling finding in an otherwise remarkably consistent dataset.

The well matched redshift distribution of\nthese two signals leads to a detection significance with a peak value of 42\n\\sigma at 545 GHz and a correlation as high as 80% across these two tracers.\nOur full set of multi-frequency measurements (both CIB auto- and CIB-lensing\ncross-spectra) are consistent with a simple halo-based model, with a\ncharacteristic mass scale for the halos hosting CIB sources of\nlog_{10}(M/M_sun) = 10.5 \\pm 0.6. Leveraging the frequency dependence of our\nsignal, we isolate the high redshift contribution to the CIB, and constrain the\nstar formation rate (SFR) density at z>1. We measure directly the SFR density\nwith around 2 sigma significance for three redshift bins between z=1 and 7,\nthus opening a new window into the study of the formation of stars at early\ntimes.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 21 figures, submitted to A&A"]}]

The three-valued semantics proposed by\nFitting and by Kunen are closely related to what is computed by a logic\nprogram, the third truth value being associated with non-termination. A\ndifferent three-valued semantics, proposed by Naish, shared much with those of\nFitting and Kunen but incorporated allowances for programmer intent, the third\ntruth value being associated with underspecification. Naish used an\n(apparently) novel \"arrow\" operator to relate the intended meaning of left and\nright sides of predicate definitions. In this paper we suggest that the\nadditional truth values of Fitting/Kunen and Naish are best viewed as duals. We\nuse Belnap's four-valued logic, also used elsewhere by Fitting, to unify the\ntwo three-valued approaches. The truth values are arranged in a bilattice which\nsupports the classical ordering on truth values as well as the \"information\nordering\". We note that the \"arrow\" operator of Naish (and our four-valued\nextension) is essentially the information ordering, whereas the classical arrow\ndenotes the truth ordering.

We use observations with the new Interface\nRegion Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) to show the conversion of mutual helicity\ninto self-helicity in coronal structures on the Sun. Methods. Using far UV\nspectra and slit-jaw images from IRIS and coronal images and magnetograms from\nSDO, we investigated the evolution of two crossing loops in an active region,\nin particular, the properties of the Si IV line profile in cool loops. Results.\nIn the early stage two cool loops cross each other and accordingly have mutual\nhelicity. The Doppler shifts in the loops indicate that they wind around each\nother. As a consequence, near the crossing point of the loops (interchange)\nreconnection sets in, which heats the plasma. This is consistent with the\nobserved increase of the line width and of the appearance of the loops at\nhigher temperatures. After this interaction, the two new loops run in parallel,\nand in one of them shows a clear spectral tilt of the Si IV line profile. This\nis indicative of a helical (twisting) motion, which is the same as to say that\nthe loop has self-helicity. Conclusions. The high spatial and spectral\nresolution of IRIS allowed us to see the conversion of mutual helicity to\nself-helicity in the (interchange) reconnection of two loops.

We propose a method to circumvent them by a simple modification of the\ndensity of state method. We first argue that the standard version of the\ndensity of state method, which is invented to solve the overlapping problem, is\neffective only for a certain `good' class of observables. We then modify it so\nas to solve the overlap problem for `bad' observables as well. While, in the\nstandard version of the density of state method, we usually constrain an\nobservable we are interested in, we fix a different observable in our new\nmethod which has a sharp peak at some particular value characterizing the\ncorrect vacuum of the target theory. In the finite-density QCD, such an\nobservable is the pion condensate. The average phase becomes vanishingly small\nas the value of the pion condensate becomes large, hence it is enough to\nconsider configurations with small values of pion condensate, where the zero\nmode does not appear. We demonstrate an effectiveness of our method by using a\ntoy model (the chiral random matrix theory) which captures the properties of\nfinite-density QCD qualitatively.

Consequently, PNiPAM is\ninsoluble in the intermediate range of solvent composition, where neither\nhydrophobic hydration nor the mixing contributions prevail. This accounts for\nthe co-nonsolvency phenomenon observed for PNiPAM in water-alcohol mixtures.\n"]}]

One key\nfinding is that when the receiver only exploits CSIR for the direct link, the\nsum of spectral efficiencies linearly improves as the density increases, when\nthe number of receive antennas increases as a certain super-linear function of\nthe density. When each receiver exploits CSIR for a set of dominant interfering\nlinks in addition to the direct link, the sum of spectral efficiencies linearly\nincreases with both the density and the path loss exponent if the number of\nantennas is a linear function of the density. This observation demonstrates\nthat having CSIR for dominant interfering links provides a multiplicative gain\nin the scaling law.

In particular,\nthe distribution of the Band function's low-energy power law index, $\\alpha$,\nhas led to the so-called synchrotron \"line-of-death\" (LOD) which is a statement\nthat the distribution cannot be explained by the simplest of synchrotron models\nalone.

However, these\nconclusions rely on the Band function's ability to fit a synchrotron spectrum\nwithin the observed energy band. In order to investigate if this is the case,\nwe simulate synchrotron and synchrotron+blackbody spectra and fold them through\nthe instrumental response of the $Fermi$ Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). We then\nperform a standard data analysis by fitting the simulated data with both Band\nand Band+blackbody models.

We evaluate the appropriateness of these two suggestions on over\n13,000 applications from Google's Play Store, of which 3,302 use SSL in\nnon-advertisement code, and find that 1,889 (57.20%) of these SSL applications\nwould benefit.\n","Comment: In Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Mobile Security Technologies\n  (MoST) 2014 (http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.6674)"]}]

With these sensors, apps\ncan gather more information and therefore provide end users with more\nfunctionality. However, these sensors also introduce the potential risk of\nleaking a user's private information because apps can access these sensors\nwithout requiring security permissions. By monitoring a device's motion, a\nmalicious app may be able to infer sensitive information about the owner of the\ndevice. For example, related work has shown that sensitive information entered\nby a user on a device's touchscreen, such as numerical PINs or passwords, can\nbe inferred from accelerometer and gyroscope data.\n  In this paper, we study these motion-based keystroke inference attacks to\ndetermine what information they need to succeed. Based on this study, we\npropose two novel approaches to defend against keystroke inference attacks: 1)\nReducing sensor data accuracy; 2) Random keyboard layout generation. We present\nthe design and the implementation of these two defences on the Android platform\nand show how they significantly reduce the accuracy of keystroke inference\nattacks.
