SDSS\nsatellites behave differently around high- and low-mass primaries: those\norbiting objects with $M_*>10^{11}M_\\odot$ are mostly red and are less\nconcentrated towards their host than the inferred dark matter halo, an effect\nthat is very pronounced for the few blue satellites. On the other hand, less\nmassive primaries have steeper satellite profiles that agree quite well with\nthe expected dark matter distribution and are dominated by blue satellites,\neven in the inner regions where strong environmental effects are expected. In\nfact, such effects appear to be strong only for primaries with $M_* >\n10^{11}M_\\odot$. This behaviour is not reproduced by current semi-analytic\nsimulations, where satellite profiles always parallel those of the dark matter\nand satellite populations are predominantly red for primaries of all masses.\nThe disagreement with SDSS suggests that environmental effects are too\nefficient in the models. Modifying the treatment of environmental and star\nformation processes can substantially increase the fraction of blue satellites,\nbut their radial distribution remains significantly shallower than observed.

In this paper,\nperformance of network-assisted D2D communication is investigated where D2D\ntraffic is carried through relay nodes. Considering a multi-user and\nmulti-relay network, we propose a distributed solution for resource allocation\nwith a view to maximizing network sum-rate. An optimization problem is\nformulated for radio resource allocation at the relays. The objective is to\nmaximize end-to-end rate as well as satisfy the data rate requirements for\ncellular and D2D user equipments under total power constraint. Due to\nintractability of the resource allocation problem, we propose a solution\napproach using message passing technique where each user equipment sends and\nreceives information messages to/from the relay node in an iterative manner\nwith the goal of achieving an optimal allocation. Therefore, the computational\neffort is distributed among all the user equipments and the corresponding relay\nnode. The convergence and optimality of the proposed scheme are proved and a\npossible distributed implementation of the scheme in practical LTE-Advanced\nnetworks is outlined.

The new state of matter discovered at\nRHIC seems to be perfect fluid rather than free plasma. Its shear viscosity is\nassumed to be almost zero. In this work, I first considered the theoretical and\nphenomenological consequences of this discovery and finally asked questions\nabout the nature of phase transition and properties of matter. It is important\nto answer these questions, otherwise QGP will remain a kind of black box; one\nsends a signal via new experiments or simulations or models and gets another\none from it. I will show that some promising ideas have already been suggested\na long time ago. I will also suggest a new phase diagram with separated\ndeconfinement and freeze-out boundaries and a mixed state of thermal quark\nmatter and bubbles of hadron gas.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 6 figures"]}]
