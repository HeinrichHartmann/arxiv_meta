With the growing\nnumbers of these synthesis models, model comparison becomes an important\nanalysis to choose a suitable model for upgrade. Along with the model\ncomparison, we reinvestigate the technique of modified Str\\\"omgren photometry\nto measure reliable parameter-sensitive colours and estimate precise model ages\nand metallicities. The assessment of Rakos/Schulz models with GALEV and\nWorthey's Lick/IDS model find smaller colour variation: \\Delta(uz-vz) $\\leq$\n0.056, \\Delta(bz-yz) $\\leq$ -0.05 and \\Delta(vz-yz) $\\leq$ 0.061. The study\nconveys a good agreement of GALEV models with the modified Str\\\"omgren colours\nbut with poor UV model predictions with the observed globular cluster data,\nwhile the spectroscopic models perform badly due to the use of older isochrone\nand stellar spectral libraries with inaccurate/insufficient knowledge of\nvarious stellar phases and their treatment. Overall, the assessment finds\nmodified Str\\\"omgren photometry well suited to study different types stellar\npopulations by mitigating the effects of the age-metallicity degeneracy.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, Accepted, JOAA"]}]
