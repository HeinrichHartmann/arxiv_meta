Thus, the bulk of metals are outside of\ngalaxies, produced in the progenitors of today's $L^*$ galaxies.

As pieces of the puzzle are taken\nthree reliable entities : (i) influence of a potential vector on the de Broglie\nwavelength (ii) a G.P. Thomson-like experimental arrangement and (iii) a\nspecial coil designed to create a homogeneous vector potential. The alluded\nproperty is not connected with magnetic fluxes surrounded by the vector\npotential field lines, but it depends on the fluxes which are outside of the\nrespective lines. Also the same property shows that in the tested case the\nvector potential field is uniquely defined physical quantity, free of any\nadjusting gauge. So the phenomenology of the suggested quantum test differs on\nthat of macroscopic theory where the vector potential is not uniquely defined\nand allows a gauge adjustment. Of course that the proposed test has to be\nsubjected to adequate experimental validation.\n","Comment: 12pages, 2 figures, 18 references"]}]

This rigorously defined machine consciousness is different from\nboth natural consciousness and any mechanistic, dynamically single-valued\nimitation of the latter.
