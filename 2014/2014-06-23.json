Understanding the effects of such a monopole field on\nits surroundings is crucial to its observation and provides a better grasp of\nfundamental physical theory.

From the Physics and Optimization points of view, it convenient to\ngeneralize the problem replacing $B$ by a nonnegative measure $d M$ and\nimposing on $d M$ the condition that its total mass is $<= m$. The problem is\nto design for a given frequency $\\alpha \\in R$ a medium that generates a\nresonance $ \\omega $ on the line $\\alpha + i R$ with a minimal possible decay\nrate $| Im \\omega |$. Such resonances are said to be of minimal decay and form\na Pareto frontier. We show that corresponding optimal measures consist of\nfinite number of point masses, and that this result yields non-existence of\noptimizers for the problem over the set of absolutely continuous measures $B(x)\ndx$. Then we derive restrictions on optimal point masses and their positions.\nThese restrictions are strong enough to calculate optimal $d M$ if the optimal\nresonance $ \\omega $, the first point mass $m_1$, and one more geometric\nparameter are known. This reduces the original infinitely-dimensional problem\nto optimization over four real parameters. For small frequencies, we explicitly\nfind the Pareto set and the corresponding optimal measures $d M$.

We answer this question for the simplest class of\ntopological phases, namely those with abelian braiding statistics.\nSpecifically, we find that an abelian topological phase can be realized by a\nstring-net model if and only if (i) it has a vanishing thermal Hall conductance\nand (ii) it has at least one Lagrangian subgroup --- a subset of quasiparticles\nwith particular topological properties. Equivalently, we find that an abelian\ntopological phase is realizable if and only if it supports a gapped edge. We\nconjecture that the latter criterion generalizes to the non-abelian case. We\nestablish these results by systematically constructing all possible abelian\nstring-net models and analyzing the quasiparticle braiding statistics in each\nmodel. We show that the low energy effective field theories for these models\nare multicomponent U(1) Chern-Simons theories, and we derive the K-matrix\ndescription of each model. An additional feature of this work is that the\nmodels we construct are more general than the original string-net models, due\nto several new ingredients. First, we introduce two new objects $\\gamma,\n\\alpha$ into the construction which are related to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and\n$\\mathbb{Z}_3$ Frobenius-Schur indicators. Second, we do not assume parity\ninvariance. As a result, we can realize topological phases that were not\naccessible to the original construction, including phases that break\ntime-reversal and parity symmetry.\n","Comment: 36 pages, 17 figures"]}]

This failure is mediated by the propagation along the interface of\nvarious types of rupture fronts, covering a wide range of velocities. Among\nthem are so-called slow fronts, which are recently discovered fronts much\nslower than the materials' sound speeds. Despite intense modelling activity,\nthe mechanisms underlying slow fronts remain elusive.

We identify slow slip immediately following the arrest of a\nfast front as a phenomenon sufficient for the front to propagate further at a\nmuch slower pace. Whether slow fronts are actually observed is controlled both\nby the interfacial stresses and by the width of the local distribution of\nforces among micro-junctions.

With such\nsmall scatter this star-formation main sequence (SFMS) has been interpreted as\ndeterministic and fundamental. Here we demonstrate that it is a simple\nconsequence of the central limit theorem. Our derivation begins by\napproximating in situ stellar mass growth as a stochastic process, much like a\nrandom walk (where the expectation of SFR at any time is equal to the SFR at\nthe previous time). We then derive expectation values for median SSFR of\nstar-forming disks and their scatter over time. We generalize the results for\nstochastic changes in SFR that are not independent of each other but are\ncorrelated over time. For unbiased samples of (disk) galaxies, we derive an\nexpectation that <SSFR> should be independent of mass, decline as 1/T, and have\na relative scatter that is independent of mass and time. The derived SFMS and\nits evolution matches published data to z=10 with sufficient accuracy to\nconstrain cosmological parameters. The framework reproduces several important\nobservables, including: the scatter in SSFR at fixed mass; the SFHs of nearby\ndwarf galaxies and the Milky Way; and the scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation.\nThe evolution of the mass function is less well reproduced and we discuss ways\nto generalize the framework to include other sources of stellar mass such as\nmergers. The predicted dispersion in SSFR has consequences for the\nclassification of quiescent galaxies, as such galaxies have heterogeneous\nformation histories, and many may only be temporarily diminished in their\nstar-formation activity. The implied dispersion in SFHs, and the SFMS's\ninsensitivity to timescales of stochasticity, thus substantially limits the\nability to connect massive galaxies to their progenitors over long cosmic\nbaselines.

To understand this\ncomplexity, the magnetic skeleton of the coronal field can be calculated. The\nskeleton highlights the separatrix surfaces that divide the field into\ntopologically distinct regions, allowing open-field regions on the solar\nsurface to be located. Furthermore, separatrix surfaces and their intersections\n(separators) are important likely energy release sites. This paper\ninvestigates, throughout the solar cycle, the nature of coronal magnetic-field\ntopologies that arise under the potential-field source-surface approximation.\nIn particular, we characterise the typical global fields at solar maximum and\nminimum. Global magnetic fields are extrapolated from observed Kitt Peak and\nSOLIS synoptic magnetograms, from Carrington rotations 1645 to 2144, using the\npotential-field source-surface model. Hence, variations in the coronal skeleton\nare studied over three solar cycles. Key building blocks which make up magnetic\nfields are identified and classified according to the nature of their\nseparatrix surfaces. The magnetic skeleton reveals that, at solar maximum, the\nglobal coronal field involves a multitude of topological structures at all\nlatitudes. Many open-field regions exist originating anywhere on the\nphotosphere. At solar minimum, the coronal topology is heavily influenced by\nthe solar dipole. A strong dipole results in a simple large-scale structure\ninvolving just two large polar open-field regions, but, at short radial\ndistances between plus or minus 60 deg latitude, the small-scale topology is\ncomplex. If the solar dipole if weak, as in the recent minimum, then the\nlow-latitude quiet-sun magnetic fields may be globally significant enough to\ncreate many disconnected open-field regions at low latitudes, in addition to\nthe two polar open-field regions.\n"]}]

We\nfirst show that extant work in quantifying liquidity commonality through the\ndegree of explanatory power of the dominant modes of variation of liquidity\n(extracted through Principal Component Analysis) fails to account for heavy\ntailed features in the data, thus producing potentially misleading results. We\nemploy Independent Component Analysis, which both decorrelates the liquidity\nmeasures in the asset cross-section, but also reduces higher-order statistical\ndependencies.\n  To measure commonality in liquidity resilience, we utilise a novel\ncharacterisation as the time required for return to a threshold liquidity\nlevel. This reflects a dimension of liquidity that is not captured by the\nmajority of liquidity measures and has important ramifications for\nunderstanding supply and demand pressures for market makers in electronic\nexchanges, as well as regulators and HFTs. When the metric is mapped out across\na range of thresholds, it produces the daily Liquidity Resilience Profile (LRP)\nfor a given asset. This daily summary of liquidity resilience behaviour from\nthe vast LOB dataset is then amenable to a functional data representation. This\nenables the comparison of liquidity resilience in the asset cross-section via\nfunctional linear sub-space decompositions and functional regression. The\nfunctional regression results presented here suggest that market factors for\nliquidity resilience (as extracted through functional principal components\nanalysis) can explain between 10 and 40% of the variation in liquidity\nresilience at low liquidity thresholds, but are less explanatory at more\nextreme levels, where individual asset factors take effect.\n"]}]
