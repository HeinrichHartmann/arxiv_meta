The general\ntheory of locally compact quantum groups in the operator algebra setting\nimplies the existence of the dual quantum group. The first main goal of the\npaper is to give an explicit description of the dual quantum group for this\nexample involving the quantized enveloping algebra U_q(su(1,1)). It turns out\nthat U_q(su(1,1)) does not suffice to generate the dual quantum group. The dual\nquantum group is graded with respect to commutation and anticommutation with a\nsuitable analogue of the Casimir operator characterized by an affiliation\nrelation to a von Neumann algebra. This is used to obtain an explicit set of\ngenerators. Having the dual quantum group the left regular corepresentation of\nthe quantum group analogue of the normalizer of SU(1,1) in SL(2,C) is\ndecomposed into irreducible corepresentations. Upon restricting the irreducible\ncorepresentations to U_q(su(1,1))-representation one finds combinations of the\npositive and negative discrete series representations with the strange series\nrepresentations as well as combinations of the principal unitary series\nrepresentations.

Yet, in a number of materials, in particular the\nhigh-temperature superconductors and the layered organic superconductors, they\nfail. In these lecture notes for an international school, I emphasize that even\nthough the low energy properties of a phase of matter are generally emergent\nand entirely determined by the broken symmetry, there are many differences\nbetween a strongly correlated and a weakly correlated state of matter. For\nexample, spin waves are an emergent property for antiferromagnets, but for weak\ncorrelations the normal phase of a (Slater) antiferromagnet is metallic,\nwhereas it is insulating (Heisenberg) for strong correlations. As a function of\ninteraction strength, above the antiferromagnetic phase, the crossover between\na metal and a local moment paramagnetic insulator is described by the Mott\ntransition, whose mean-field theory down to T=0 is best formulated with\ndynamical mean-field theory. A similar situation occurs for superconductors:\ndespite similar emergent properties, there are many differences between both\nkinds of superconductors. Experimental evidence suggests that hole-doped\ncuprates are strongly correlated whereas the correlations are weaker in the\nelectron-doped case, especially near optimal doping. Evidence for a pseudogap\narising from antiferromagnetic fluctuations is strong in the latter case,\nwhereas in the hole-doped case the pseudogap temperature appears as a\nconsequence of Mott physics. In cluster dynamical mean-field theory, the\npseudogap line T* is a Widom line arising from a T=0 first-order transition\nthat terminates at a finite T critical point. Strongly correlated\nsuperconductors are much more resilient to near-neighbor repulsion than their\nweakly correlated counterpart. Many different methods to attack these problems\ntheoretically are described.\n","Comment: These lecture notes were completed in early July 2013 for the \"Autumn\n  School on Correlated Electrons: Emergent Phenomena in Correlated Matter\n  September 23-27, 2013, Forschungszentrum J\\\"ulich, Germany\".

Specifically,\nthe channel dispersion is shown to be zero regardless of whether the fading\nrealizations are available at both transmitter and receiver, at only one of\nthem, or at neither of them.

A\nrecently published round-robin study that circulated the same samples to\nseveral alpha counting centers showed wide center-to-center variations in\nmeasured alpha emissivity. A separate analysis of these results hypothesized\nthat much of the variation might arise from differences in sample-to-entrance\nwindow separations. XIA recently introduced an ultra low background counter,\nthe UltraLo-1800 (UltraLo), that operates in a fundamentally different manner\nfrom the proportional counters used at most of the centers in the original\nstudy. In particular, by placing the sample within the counting volume, it\neliminates the sample-to-entrance window separation issue noted above, and so\noffers an opportunity to test this hypothesis. In this work we briefly review\nhow the UltraLo operates and describe a new round-robin study conducted\nentirely on UltraLo instruments using a set of standard samples that included\ntwo samples used in the original study.

Variations\nin ULA (Ultra-Low Alpha < 2 alpha/khr-cm$^2$) sample measurements were reduced\nthree-fold, compared to the earlier study, with the measurements suggesting\nthat residual activity variations now primarily arise from site-to-site\ndifferences in the cosmogenic background.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables; Fixed typos, added discussion on\n  potential for positive systematic bias per reviewer comments, quick\n  formatting refresh.

When long-range\nmagnetic order is suppressed under pressure, the key characteristic of the\nskyrmion lattice - that is, the topological Hall signal due to the emergent\nmagnetic flux associated with their topological winding - is unaffected in sign\nor magnitude and becomes an important characteristic of the metallic state. The\nregime of the topological Hall signal in temperature, pressure and magnetic\nfield coincides thereby with the exceptionally extended regime of a pronounced\nnon-Fermi-liquid resistivity. The observation of this topological Hall signal\nin the regime of the NFL resistivity suggests empirically that spin\ncorrelations with non-trivial topological character may drive a breakdown of\nFermi liquid theory in pure metals.\n"]}]

Two cases\nare studied for every parameter: (i) the case where the halo component is\nprolate and (ii) the case where an oblate dark halo is present. Our numerical\ninvestigation indicates that all the dynamical quantities affect, more or less,\nthe overall orbital structure. It was observed that the mass of the nucleus,\nthe halo flattening parameter, the scale length of the halo, the angular\nmomentum, and the orbital energy are the most influential quantities, while the\neffect of all the other parameters is much weaker. It was also found that all\nthe parameters corresponding to the disk only have a minor influence on the\nnature of orbits. Furthermore, some other quantities, such as the minimum\ndistance to the origin, the horizontal, and the vertical force, were tested as\npotential chaos detectors. Our analysis revealed that only general information\ncan be obtained from these quantities. We also compared our results with early\nrelated work.\n","Comment: Published in Astronomy & Astrophysics (A&A) journal"]}]

However, especially for\narc-evaporated Ti-Al-Ta-N coatings only limited information on the detailed\ninfluence of the elements on various properties is available. Therefore, we\nhave developed arc-evaporated Ti1-x-yAlxTayN coatings with various Al (x = 0.50\n- 0.65) and Ta (y = 0.00 - 0.15) contents. While the thermal stability of our\ncoatings during annealing in inert He atmosphere increases with increasing Ta\ncontent, best results are obtained for specific Ta-Al ratios during oxidation.\nSingle phase cubic Ti0.32Al0.60Ta0.08N yields a mass-gain of only ~5 % after 5\nh at 950 {\\deg}C in synthetic air, whereas Ti0.35Al0.65N is completely oxidized\nafter 15 min. This is in part based on the suppressed anatase and direct rutile\nTiO2 formation at a defined Ta-Al content. Consequently, the anatase-to-rutile\ntransformation, generally observed for Ti1-xAlxN, is absent. This reduces the\ngeneration of pores and cracks within the oxide scale and especially at the\nnitride-oxide interface, leading to the formation of a protective rutile and\ncorundum based oxide scale. This is also reflected in the pronounced decrease\nin activation energy for the protective scale formation from 232 kJ/mol for\nTi0.35Al0.65N down to 14.5 kJ/mol for Ti0.32Al0.60Ta0.08N. Based on our results\nwe can conclude that especially phase transformations within the oxide scale\nneed to be suppressed, as the connected volume changes lead to the formation of\ncracks and pores.\n"]}]

One\nmajor hurdle to the extensive use of stable distributions is the lack of a\nclosed-form analytical expression for their densities.
