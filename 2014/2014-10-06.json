The method used a construction of\nRieffel referred to as the \"Heisenberg bimodule\" in which the two\nnoncommutative solenoid corresponds to two different twisted group algebras\nassociated to dual lattices in $(\\mathbb Q_p\\times \\mathbb R)^2.$ In this\npaper, we make three additional observations: first, that at each stage, the\nsubalgebra given by the irrational rotation algebra corresponding to\n$\\alpha_{2j}=(\\theta+1)/p^{2j}$ is strongly Morita equivalent to the irrational\nrotation algebra corresponding to the irrational rotation algebra corresponding\nto $\\beta_{2j}= 1-\\frac{\\theta+1}{p^{2j}\\theta}$ by a different construction of\nRieffel, secondly, that that Rieffel's Heisenberg module relating the two non\ncommutative solenoids can be constructed as the closure of a nested sequence of\nfunction spaces associated to a multiresolution analysis for a $p$-adic\nwavelet, and finally, at each stage, the equivalence bimodule between\n$A_{\\alpha_{2j}}$ and $A_{\\beta_{2j}}$ can be identified with the\nsubequivalence bimodules arising from the $p$-adic MRA. Aside from its\ninstrinsic interest, we believe this construction will guide us in our efforts\nto show that certain necessary conditions for two noncommutative solenoids to\nbe strongly Morita equivalent are also sufficient.\n","Comment: 30 pages"]}]

Some form of vehicle-to-vehicle and/or\nvehicle-to-infrastructure cooperation is required to ensure a safe and\nefficient global transportation system. This thesis deals with a particular\nform of cooperation by studying the problem of coordinating multiple mobile\nrobots at an intersection area. Most of coordination systems proposed in\nprevious work consist in planning a trajectory and to control the robots along\nthe planned trajectory: that is the plan-as-program paradigm where planning is\nconsidered as a generative mechanism of action. The approach of the thesis is\nto plan priorities -- the relative order of robots to go through the\nintersection -- which is much weaker as many trajectories respect the same\npriorities. More precisely, priorities encode the homotopy classes of solutions\nto the coordination problem. Priority assignment is equivalent to the choice of\nsome homotopy class to solve the coordination problem instead of a particular\ntrajectory. Once priorities are assigned, robots are controlled through a\ncontrol law preserving the assigned priorities, i.e., ensuring the described\ntrajectory belongs to the chosen homotopy class. It results in a more robust\ncoordination system -- able to handle a large class of unexpected events in a\nreactive manner -- particularly well adapted for an application to the\ncoordination of autonomous vehicles at intersections where cars, public\ntransport and pedestrians share the road.\n","Comment: PhD Thesis, 182 pages"]}]

Our use of the probit model in the context of topic\ndiscovery is novel, as many authors have so far con- centrated solely of the\nlogistic model partly due to the formidable inefficiency of the multinomial\nprobit model even in the case of very small topical spaces.

For applications in quantum communication, two metrics of this process\nare particularly important: heralding efficiency and total joint rate. Here, we\nderive expressions for both quantities for a variety of different beam\ngeometries and frequencies. We pay specific attention to the spectrum of both\nbiphotons and individual photons. We reveal the underlying mechanisms\nresponsible for the spectral shape and show they differ for different\ngeometries and frequencies. We then use these spectra to calculate heralding\nefficiency and joint count rate and examine how each of these metrics changes\nwith different geometries, frequencies, and spectral filtering and beam\nparameters. Interestingly, we find very high heralding efficiencies are\nachievable for collinear geometries, while noncollinear geometries require\nspectral filtering for high heralding efficiency, ultimately limiting the joint\ncount rate. We also find that the the spectrum is narrower in nondegenerate\ncases, leading to lower joint count rates and higher heralding efficiency in\nthe noncollinear case. In addition to the theory, we verify selected\npredictions with experimental results.\n"]}]

Design decisions taken in this phase may significantly\ncontribute to the building performance. On account of this reason, it is\nimportant to estimate and compare alternative solutions, when it is still\nmanageable to change the building design.\n  The authors have been developing a prototype tool to assist architects during\nthis initial design phase. It is made up of two algorithms. The first algorithm\ngenerates alternative floor plans according to the architect's preferences and\nrequirements, and the client's design program. It consists in one evolutionary\nstrategy approach enhanced with local search technique to allocate rooms on\nseveral levels in the two-dimensional space. The second algorithm evaluates,\nranks, and optimizes those floor plans according to thermal performance\ncriteria. The prototype tool is coupled with dynamic simulation program, which\nestimates the thermal behavior of each solution. A sequential variable\noptimization is used to change several geometric values of different\narchitectural elements in the floor plans to explore the improvement potential.\n  In the present communication, the two algorithms are used in an iterative\nprocess to generate and optimize the thermal performance of alternative floor\nplans.
