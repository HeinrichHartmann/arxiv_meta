To increase\nthe realism of existing simulations, we simulated for the first time a disk\ngalaxy exposed to a uniformly magnetized wind including radiative cooling and\nself-gravity of the gas. We find that B-fields have a strong effect on the\nmorphology of the gas in the tail of the galaxy. While in the pure hydro case\nthe tail is very clumpy, the MHD case shows very filamentary structures in the\ntail. The filaments can be strongly supported by magnetic pressure and, when\nthis is the case, the B-field vectors tend to be aligned with the filaments.\nThe ram pressure stripping may lead to the formation of magnetized density\ntails that appear as bifurcated in the plane of the sky and resemble the double\ntails observed in ESO 137-001 and ESO 137-002. Such tails can be formed under a\nvariety of situations, both for the disks oriented face-on with respect to the\nICM wind and for the tilted ones. While this bifurcation is due to the generic\ntendency for the B-fields to produce very filamentary tail morphology, the tail\nproperties are further shaped by the combination of the B-field orientation and\nthe sliding of the field past the disk surface exposed to the wind. Magnetic\ndraping does not strongly change the rate of gas stripping. For a face-on\ngalaxy, the field tends to reduce the amount of stripping compared to the pure\nhydro case, and is associated with the formation of a magnetic draping layer on\nthe side of the galaxy exposed to the ICM wind. For significantly tilted disks,\nthe stripping rate may be enhanced by the ``scraping'' of the disk surface by\nthe B-fields sliding past the ISM/ICM interface.\n","Comment: ApJ in press. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:0909.3097 by\n  other authors"]}]

A precise\naccount of the density is needed to constrain the expected gamma ray flux from\nDM self-annihilation and to distinguish between cold and warm dark matter\nmodels. Unfortunately the traditional method of fitting the second order Jeans\nequation to the tracer dispersion suffers from an unbreakable degeneracy of\nsolutions due to the unknown velocity anisotropy of the projected system. To\ntackle this degeneracy one can appeal to higher moments of the Jeans equation.\nBy introducing an analog to the Binney anisotropy parameter at fourth order,\nbeta' we create a framework that encompasses all solutions to the fourth order\nJeans equations rather than those in the literature that impose unnecessary\ncorrelations between anisotropy of second and fourth order moments.

This domain promiscuity challenge to the\nproblem of inferring reliable DDIs from PPIs has been recognized, and a number\nof work-arounds have been proposed. In this paper, we report an application of\nFormal Concept Analysis (FCA) to this problem. We find that the relationship\nbetween formal concepts provide a natural way for rare domains to elevate the\nrank of promiscuous domains, and enrich highly ranked domain-pairs with\nreliable DDIs. This piggy-backing of promiscuous domains onto rare domains is\npossible due to the domain architecture of proteins which mixes promiscuous\nwith rare domains.\n"]}]

The collective properties of the system are\ncharacterized by means of the persistence probability of equivalent spin\nvariables that define two phases, and by a magnetization-like order parameter\nthat measures the phase-ordering behavior. As a consequence of the global\ninteraction, the persistence probability saturates for all values of the\ncoupling parameter, in contrast to the transition observed in the temporal\nbehavior of the persistence in coupled maps on regular lattices. A\ndiscontinuous transition from a non-ordered state to a collective phase-ordered\nstate takes place at a critical value of the coupling. On an interval of the\ncoupling parameter, we find three distinct realizations of the phase-ordered\nstate, which can be discerned by the corresponding values of the saturation\npersistence.

An uprising alternative to GPU is\nIntel MIC; supercomputers like Tianhe-2, currently top of TOP500, is built with\n48,000 MIC boards to offer ~55 PFLOPS. The CPU-like architecture of MIC allows\nCPU-based software to be parallelized easily; however, the performance is often\ninferior to GPU counterparts as an MIC board contains only ~60 cores (while a\nGPU board typically has over a thousand cores). Results: To better utilize\nMIC-enabled computers for NGS data analysis, we developed a new short-read\naligner MICA that is optimized in view of MICs limitation and the extra\nparallelism inside each MIC core. Experiments on aligning 150bp paired-end\nreads show that MICA using one MIC board is 4.9 times faster than the BWA-MEM\n(using 6-core of a top-end CPU), and slightly faster than SOAP3-dp (using a\nGPU).

However, nearly all theoretic work in the SINR model\ndepends on the assumption of smooth geometric decay, one that is true in free\nspace but is far off in actual environments. The challenge is to model\nrealistic environments, including walls, obstacles, reflections and anisotropic\nantennas, without making the models algorithmically impractical or analytically\nintractable.\n  We present a simple solution that allows the modeling of arbitrary static\nsituations by moving from geometry to arbitrary decay spaces.

All results that hold\nin the SINR model in general metrics carry over to decay spaces, with the\nresulting time complexity and approximation depending on Z in the same way that\nthe original results depends on the path loss term alpha. For distributed\nalgorithms, that to date have appeared to necessarily depend on the planarity,\nwe indicate how they can be adapted to arbitrary decay spaces.\n  Finally, we explore the dependence on Z in the approximability of core\nproblems. In particular, we observe that the capacity maximization problem has\nexponential upper and lower bounds in terms of Z in general decay spaces. In\nEuclidean metrics and related growth-bounded decay spaces, the performance\ndepends on the exact metricity definition, with a polynomial upper bound in\nterms of Z, but an exponential lower bound in terms of a variant parameter phi.\nOn the plane, the upper bound result actually yields the first approximation of\na capacity-type SINR problem that is subexponential in alpha.\n"]}]
