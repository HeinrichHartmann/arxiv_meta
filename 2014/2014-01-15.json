Under the de Broglie-Bohm ontology, the box contains an\nobjectively-existing 'pilot wave' which guides the electron trajectory, and\nthis is represented mathematically by a Schroedinger wave function composed of\na finite out-of-phase superposition of M energy eigenstates (with M ranging\nfrom 4 to 64).

It is well known that modular\ninvariance fixes strong constraints that in some cases appear only at higher\ngenus. Here we classify all the Weyl and modular invariant partition functions\ngiven by the path integral on the world-sheet metric, together with space-time\ncoordinates, b-c and/or beta-gamma systems, that correspond to volume forms on\nM_g. This was a long standing question, advocated by Belavin and Knizhnik,\ninspired by the Serre GAGA principle and based on the properties of the Mumford\nforms. The key observation is that the Bergman reproducing kernel provides a\nWeyl and modular invariant way to remove the point dependence that appears in\nthe above string determinants, a property that should have its superanalog\nbased on the super Bergman reproducing kernel. This is strictly related to the\nproperties of the propagator associated to the space-time coordinates. Such\npartition functions Z[J] have well-defined asymptotic behavior and can be\nconsidered as a basis to represent a wide class of string theories. In\nparticular, since non-critical bosonic string partition functions Z_D are\nvolume forms on M_g, we suggest that there is a mapping, based on bosonization\nand degeneration techniques, from the Liouville sector to first order systems\nthat may identify Z_D as a subclass of the Z[J]. The appearance of b-c and\nbeta-gamma systems of any conformal weight shows that such theories are related\nto W algebras. The fact that in a large N 't Hooft-like limit 2D W_N minimal\nmodels CFTs are related to higher spin gravitational theories on AdS_3,\nsuggests that the string partition functions introduced here may lead to a\nformulation of higher spin theories in a string context.\n","Comment: 30 pp. New results on Quillen metric and its relations with the\n  Mumford forms and the tautological classes.

This suggests a new and interesting feature of the\nbehavior of perturbed AAdS black holes and black branes, which is not readily\ncaptured by a standard quasinormal mode analysis. Namely, for sufficiently\nlarge perturbed black objects (with long-lived quasinormal modes), nonlinear\neffects transfer energy from short to long wavelength modes via a turbulent\ncascade within the metric perturbation. As long wavelength modes have slower\ndecay, this lengthens the overall lifetime of the perturbation.

In a nutshell, highly\nnon-linear out-of-equilibrium systems subjected to exogenous perturbations tend\nto exhibit a long phase of slow apparent stable evolution, which are nothing\nbut slow maturations towards instabilities, failures and changes of regimes.\nWith examples from history where a small event had a cataclysmic consequence,\nwe propose a novel view of the current state of the world via the logical\nscenarios that derive, avoiding the traps of an illusionary stability and\nsimple linear extrapolation. The endogenous scenarios are \"muddling along\",\n\"managing through\" and \"blood red abyss\". The exogenous scenarios are \"painful\nadjustment\" and \"golden east\".\n","Comment: 16 pages with 5 figures. Notenstein White Paper Series, November 2013"]}]

Two fundamental limit\ntheorems about random binary strings are the central limit theorem and the law\nof the iterated logarithm (LIL).

Sum-over-histories quantum mechanics can be generalized to deal\nwith spacetime alternatives that are not \"at definite moments of time\". An\nexample in field theory is the set of alternative ranges of values of a field\naveraged over a spacetime region. An example in particle mechanics is the set\nof the alternatives defined by whether a particle never crosses a fixed\nspacetime region or crosses it at least once. The general notion of a set of\nspacetime alternatives is a partition (coarse-graining) of the histories into\nan exhaustive set of exclusive classes.
