In particular\nwe present an algorithm that, for a collection of $n$ aligned sequences of\nlength $m$, can compute the blocks of the associated quasi-median graph\ntogether with the information required to correctly connect these blocks\ntogether in run time $\\mathcal O(n^2m^2)$, independent of the size of the\nsequence alphabet. Our primary motivation for presenting this algorithm is the\nfact that the quasi-median graph associated to a sequence alignment must\ncontain all most parsimonious trees for the alignment, and therefore\nprecomputing the blocks of the graph has the potential to help speed up any\nmethod for computing such trees.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 2 figures"]}]

In addition, using a combined strategy which involves the generalized\n$K$-core and the recently introduced $M$-core, the elites of the different\n'nations' present in the game are perfectly identified as modules of the\ngeneralized $K$-core. Interesting sudden shifts in the composition of the elite\ncores are observed at deep levels. We show that elite detection with the\ntraditional $K$-core is not possible in a reliable way.

More\nrecently, analysis of high-Reynolds number experimental boundary layer data has\nshown that also the variance and higher-order moments of the streamwise\nvelocity fluctuations $u'^{+}$ display logarithmic laws. Such experimental\nobservations motivate the question whether LES can accurately reproduce the\nvariance and the higher-order moments, in particular their logarithmic\ndependency on distance to the wall. In this study we perform LES of very high\nReynolds number wall-modeled channel flow and focus on profiles of variance and\nhigher-order moments of the streamwise velocity fluctuations. In agreement with\nthe experimental data, we observe an approximately logarithmic law for the\nvariance in the LES, with a `Townsend-Perry' constant of $A_1\\approx 1.25$. The\nLES also yields approximate logarithmic laws for the higher-order moments of\nthe streamwise velocity. Good agreement is found between $A_p$, the generalized\n`Townsend-Perry' constants for moments of order $2p$, from experiments and\nsimulations. Both are indicative of sub-Gaussian behavior of the streamwise\nvelocity fluctuations. The near-wall behavior of the variance, the ranges of\nvalidity of the logarithmic law and in particular possible dependencies on\ncharacteristic length scales such as the roughness scale $z_0$, the LES grid\nscale $\\Delta$, and sub-grid scale (SGS) mixing length $C_s\\Delta$ are\nexamined.

The model flow\nis parametrized by its amplitudes (thereby admitting the possibility of\nanisotropy), lengthscales, and multiple time scales, and the outcome of the\nphase separation is investigated as a function of these parameters as well as\nthe dimensionality. In this way, a parameter regime is identified wherein the\nphase separation and the associated coarsening phenomenon are not only arrested\nbut in fact the concentration variance decays, thereby opening up the\npossibility of describing the dynamics of the concentration field using the\ntheories of advection diffusion. This parameter regime corresponds to long flow\ncorrelation times, large flow amplitudes and small diffusivities. The onset of\nthis hyperdiffusive regime is interpreted by introducing Batchelor\nlengthscales. A key result is that in the hyperdiffusive regime, the\ndistribution of concentration (in particular, the frequency of extreme values\nof concentration) depends strongly on the dimensionality. Anisotropic scenarios\nare also investigated: for scenarios wherein the variance saturates\n(corresponding to coarsening arrest), the direction in which the domains align\ndepends on the flow correlation time.

Second, PAW can provide a solution to some of the convergence problems\nexhibited in other OFDFT implementations based on Kohn-Sham codes.

In this metaphor dishes corresponds to latent features, attributes,\npreferences shared by individuals. The IBP, and its generalizations, represent\nan exciting class of models well suited to handle high dimensional statistical\nproblems now common in this information age. The IBP is based on the usage of\nconditionally independent Bernoulli random variables, coupled with completely\nrandom measures acting as Bayesian priors, that are used to create sparse\nbinary matrices. This Bayesian non-parametric view was a key insight due to\nThibaux and Jordan (2007). One way to think of generalizations is to to use\nmore general random variables.

For the class of polyhedra arising from\ntotally unimodular constraint matrices, this implies a bound of $O(n^3 \\ln n)$.\nFor linear optimization, given an initial feasible vertex, we show that an\noptimal vertex can be found using an expected $O(\\frac{n^3}{\\delta} \\ln\n\\frac{n}{\\delta})$ simplex pivots, each requiring $O(m n)$ time to compute. An\ninitial feasible solution can be found using $O(\\frac{m n^3}{\\delta} \\ln\n\\frac{n}{\\delta})$ pivot steps.\n"]}]

In an effort to\nanswer this question, we propose a new equilibrium concept: perfect cooperative\nequilibrium (PCE), and two related variants: max-PCE and cooperative\nequilibrium. PCE may help explain players' behavior in games where cooperation\nis observed in practice. A player's payoff in a PCE is at least as high as in\nany NE. However, a PCE does not always exist.

In particular, I state and\nprove three theorems about PCA, which I paraphrase as follows: 1). PCA without\ndiscarding eigenvector rows is injective, but looses this injectivity when\neigenvector rows are discarded 2). PCA without discarding eigen- vector rows\npreserves pair-wise distances, but tends to cause pair-wise distances to shrink\nwhen eigenvector rows are discarded. 3). For any pair of points, the shrinkage\nin pair-wise distance is bounded above by an L1 norm reconstruction error\nassociated with the points. Clearly, 3). suggests that there might exist some\ncorrelation between shrinkages in pair-wise distances and mean square\nreconstruction error which is defined as the sum of those eigenvalues\nassociated with the discarded eigenvectors. I therefore decided to perform\nnumerical experiments to obtain the corre- lation between the sum of those\neigenvalues and shrinkages in pair-wise distances. In addition, I have also\nperformed some experiments to check respectively the effect of the sum of those\neigenvalues and the effect of the shrinkages on classification accuracies under\nthe PCA map. So far, I have obtained the following results on some publicly\navailable data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: 1).

Our proposals derive from the\nobservation that the SC framework enforces a one-to-one correspondence between\nsample points, and that this leads to two possible drawbacks. First, this\ndenies the framework the opportunity to effect advantageous many-to-many\nmatching between points on the two shapes being compared. Second, this calls\nfor the Hungarian algorithm which unfortunately usurps cubic time. While the\ndynamic-space-warping dynamic programming algorithm has provided a standard\nsolution to the first problem above, it demands quintic time for general\nmulti-contour shapes, and w times quadratic time for the special case of\nsingle-contour shapes, even after an heuristic search window of width w has\nbeen chosen. Therefore, in this work, we propose a simple method for computing\n\"many-to-many\" correspondences for the class of all 2-d shapes in quadratic\ntime. Our approach is to explicitly let each point on the first shape choose a\nbest match on the second shape, and vice versa. Along the way, we also propose\nthe use of data-clustering techniques for dealing with the outliers problem,\nand, from another viewpoint, it turns out that this clustering can be seen as\nan autonomous, rather than pre-computed, sampling of shape boundary.\n"]}]

Unlike prior Sybil-resistant P2P\nsystems based on social networks, Persea does not rely on two key assumptions:\n(i) that the social network is fast mixing, and (ii) that there is a small\nratio of attack edges to honest peers.

The method is expected to give a reason \"why 4 colours suffice\"\nand suggests that every two dimensional geometric graph of arbitrary degree and\norientation can be coloured by 5 colours: since the projective plane can not be\na boundary of a 3-dimensional graph and because for higher genus surfaces, the\ninterior H is not simply connected, we need in general to embed a surface into\na 4-dimensional simply connected graph in order to colour it. This explains the\nappearance of the chromatic number 5 for higher degree or non-orientable\nsituations, a number we believe to be the upper limit. For every surface type,\nwe construct examples with chromatic number 3,4 or 5, where the construction of\nsurfaces with chromatic number 5 is based on a method of Fisk. We have\nimplemented and illustrated all the topological aspects described in this paper\non a computer. So far we still need human guidance or simulated annealing to do\nthe refinements in the higher dimensional host graph.\n","Comment: 81 pages, 48 figures"]}]

The problem is defined as follows. We are given an interconnection\nnetwork and a number of load items, which are arbitrarily distributed among the\nnodes of the network. The goal is to redistribute the load in iterative\ndiscrete steps such that at the end each node has (almost) the same number of\nitems. In diffusion load balancing nodes are only allowed to balance their load\nwith their direct neighbors.\n  We show three main results. Firstly, we present a general framework for\nrandomly rounding the flow generated by continuous diffusion schemes over the\nedges of a graph in order to obtain corresponding discrete schemes. Compared to\nthe results of Rabani, Sinclair, and Wanka, FOCS'98, which are only valid\nw.r.t. the class of homogeneous first order schemes, our framework can be used\nto analyze a larger class of diffusion algorithms, such as algorithms for\nheterogeneous networks and second order schemes. Secondly, we bound the\ndeviation between randomized second order schemes and their continuous\ncounterparts. Finally, we provide a bound for the minimum initial load in a\nnetwork that is sufficient to prevent the occurrence of negative load at a node\nduring the execution of second order diffusion schemes.\n  Our theoretical results are complemented with extensive simulations on\ndifferent graph classes. We show empirically that second order schemes, which\nare usually much faster than first order schemes, will not balance the load\ncompletely on a number of networks within reasonable time. However, the maximum\nload difference at the end seems to be bounded by a constant value, which can\nbe further decreased if first order scheme is applied once this value is\nachieved by second order scheme.\n","Comment: Full version of paper submitted to ICDCS 2015"]}]
