The\ntangling clustering instability in the temperature stratified turbulence is\nessentially different from the inertial clustering instability that occurs in\nnon-stratified isotropic and homogeneous turbulence. While the inertial\nclustering instability is caused by the centrifugal effect of the turbulent\neddies, the mechanism of the tangling clustering instability is related to the\ntemperature fluctuations generated by the tangling of the mean temperature\ngradient by the velocity fluctuations. Temperature fluctuations produce\npressure fluctuations and cause particle clustering in regions with increased\npressure fluctuations.

Accordingly we identify our geometric scalar\nfield---actually of the type of an abelian gauge field---with the recently\ndiscovered scalar field. There are two constants in the theory: the first,\nnamed $m$, is positive and defines a mass scale for the universe; the second,\nnamed $\\Lambda$, is the cosmological constant. For the space-time to be\neverywhere non-singular, equivalently for the (strict) dominant energy\ncondition to hold, these constants must obey the inequality $\\Lambda > m^2/4$.\n","Comment: 11 pages"]}]

For definiteness, we consider the role of light and heavy\nsterile neutrinos. In this case, the effective Majorana mass parameter can be\nredefined to take into account all contributions and its value gets suppressed.\nHence, larger values of neutrino masses are required for the same half-life.\nThe canonical light neutrino contribution can not saturate the present limits\nof half-lives or the positive claim of observation of neutrinoless double beta\ndecay, once the stringent bounds from cosmology are taken into account. For the\ncase of cancellation, where all the sterile neutrinos are heavy, the tension\nbetween the results from neutrinoless double beta decay and cosmology becomes\nmore severe. We show that the inclusion of light sterile neutrinos in this set\nup can resolve this issue. Using the recent results from GERDA, we derive upper\nlimits on the active-sterile mixing angles and compare it with the case of no\ncancellation.

These formulas allow for an effective\nderivation of reduced ODE systems, aimed to model the evolution of the low-mode\ntruncation of the controlled state variable, where the high-mode part is\napproximated by the PM function applied to the low modes. A priori error\nestimates between the resulting PM-based low-dimensional suboptimal controller\n$u_R^\\ast$ and the optimal controller $u^*$ are derived. These estimates\ndemonstrate that the closeness of $u_R^\\ast$ to $u^*$ is mainly conditioned on\ntwo factors: (i) the parameterization defect of a given PM, associated\nrespectively with $u_R^\\ast$ and $u^*$; and (ii) the energy kept in the high\nmodes of the PDE solution either driven by $u_R^\\ast$ or $u^*$ itself. The\npractical performances of such PM-based suboptimal controllers are numerically\nassessed for various optimal control problems associated with a Burgers-type\nequation.

Our numerical and analytical results suggest\nthe following. Firstly, the CS is associated with the existence of the\nanomalous counter-propagating (ACP) modes reported recently. Specifically, we\nshow that a particular form of CS protects the ACP modes occurring at\nquasienergies of $\\pm \\pi$. We also find that these modes are only present\nalong selected boundaries, suggesting that they are a weak topological effect.\nSecondly, we find that CS can give rise to protected $0$ and $\\pi$ quasienergy\nmodes, and that the number of these modes may increase without bound as we tune\nup certain system parameters. Like the ACP modes, these $0$ and $\\pi$ modes\nalso appear only along selected boundaries and thus appear to be a weak\ntopological effect. To our knowledge, this work represents the first detailed\nstudy of weak topological effects in periodically driven systems. Our findings\nadd to the still-growing knowledge on driven topological systems.\n","Comment: 37 pages, 5 figures, to appear in Physical Review B"]}]

However, there is still a debate about\ntheir stellar masses and their nature in the context of the general galaxy\npopulation. To test the reliability of their stellar mass determinations, we\nused a sample of simulated submm galaxies for which we derived stellar masses\nvia spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling (with Grasil, Magphys, Hyperz\nand LePhare) adopting various star formation histories (SFHs). We found that\nthe assumption of SFHs with two independent components leads to the most\naccurate stellar masses. Exponentially declining SFHs (tau) lead to lower\nmasses (albeit still consistent with the true values), while the assumption of\nsingle-burst SFHs results in a significant mass underestimation. Thus, we\nconclude that studies based on the higher masses inferred from fitting the SEDs\nof real submm galaxies with double SFHs are most likely to be correct, implying\nthat submm galaxies lie on the high-mass end of the main sequence of\nstar-forming galaxies.

We have demonstrated that the\nderived theoretical dependence of turbulent diffusion coefficient versus the\nturbulent Damk\\\"{o}hler number is in a good agreement with that obtained\npreviously in the numerical modelling of a reactive front propagating in a\nturbulent flow and described by the Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov-Fisher\nequation. We have found that turbulent cross-effects, e.g., turbulent mutual\ndiffusion of gaseous admixtures and turbulent Dufour-effect of the chemically\nreacting gaseous admixtures, are less sensitive to the values of stoichiometric\ncoefficients. The mechanisms of the turbulent cross-effects are different from\nthe molecular cross effects known in irreversible thermodynamics. In a fully\ndeveloped turbulence and at large Peclet numbers the turbulent cross-effects\nare much larger than the molecular ones. The obtained results are applicable\nalso to heterogeneous phase transitions.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 1 figures, REVTEX4-1, revised version"]}]

We show that\nin this case, the leptogenesis bound on $M_{W_R}$ can be substantially weaker,\ni.e. $M_{W_R}\\gtrsim 3$ TeV for $M_N \\lesssim M_{W_R}$. This happens due to\nconsiderable reduction of the dilution effects from $W_R$-mediated decays and\nscatterings, while the washout effects due to inverse decays are under control\nfor certain parameter ranges of the Yukawa couplings. We also show that this\nmodel is consistent with all other low energy constraints, such as lepton\nflavor violation and neutrinoless double beta decay. Thus, a discovery of the\nright-handed gauge bosons alone at the LHC will not falsify leptogenesis as the\nmechanism behind the matter-antimatter asymmetry in our Universe.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables; some clarifications and references\n  added; version accepted for publication in Phys.

In this paper we\ninvestigate in isolation the impact of a variable star formation history on the\nmeasurement of the SFR. Methods. We combine 23 state-of-the-art hydrodynamical\nsimulations of 1<z<2 galaxies on the main sequence with the cigale spectral\nenergy distribution modelling code.

We find that except for the Lyman continuum, classical\nSFR estimators calibrated over 100 Myr overestimate the SFR from ~25% in the\nFUV band to ~65% in the U band. Such biases are due 1) to the contribution of\nstars living longer than 100 Myr, and 2) to variations of the SFR on timescales\nlonger than a few tens of Myr. Rapid variations of the SFR increase the\nuncertainty on the determination of the instantaneous SFR but have no long term\neffect. Conclusions.

We study the gas and dust distributions of a disk\nhosting two massive planets as function of different disk and dust parameters.\nObservational signatures, such as the spectral energy distribution,\nsub-millimetre, and polarised images are simulated for the various parameters.\nWe confirm that planets can lead to particle trapping, although for a disk with\nhigh viscosity ($\\alpha_{\\rm{turb}}=10^{-2}$), the planet should be more\nmassive than $5 M_{\\rm{Jup}}$ and dust fragmentation should occur with low\nefficiency ($v_{f}\\sim30\\rm{m s}^{-1}$). This will lead to a ring-like feature\nas observed in transition disks in the millimetre. When trapping occurs, we\nfind that a smooth distribution of micron sized grains throughout the disk,\nsometimes observed in scattered light, can only happen if the combination of\nplanet mass and turbulence is such that small grains are not fully filtered\nout. A high disk viscosity ($\\alpha_{\\rm{turb}}=10^{-2}$) ensures a\nreplenishment of the cavity in micron-sized dust, while for lower viscosity\n($\\alpha_{\\rm{turb}}=10^{-3}$), the planet mass is constrained to be less than\n$5 M_{\\rm{Jup}}$. In these cases, the gas distribution is likely to show\nlow-amplitude azimuthal asymmetries caused by disk eccentricity rather than by\nlong-lived vortices.\n","Comment: Minor changes after language edition (Accepted for publication in\n  A&A)"]}]

In this\npaper we show how these effects can be used to reliably switch perpendicularly\nmagnetized layers and to move domain walls. A drift-diffusion treatment of the\nanomalous Hall effect and the anisotropic magnetoresistance describes the spin\ncurrents that flow in directions perpendicular to the electric field. In\nsystems with two ferromagnetic layers separated by a spacer layer, an in-plane\nelectric field cause spin currents to be injected from one layer into the\nother, creating spin transfer torques. Unlike the related spin Hall effect in\nnon-magnetic materials, the anomalous Hall effect and the anisotropic\nmagnetoresistance allow control of the orientation of the injected spins, and\nhence torques, by changing the direction of the magnetization in the injecting\nlayer. The torques on one layer show a rich angular dependence as a function of\nthe orientation of the magnetization in the other layer. The control of the\ntorques afforded by changing the orientation of the magnetization in a fixed\nlayer makes it possible to reliably switch a perpendicularly magnetized free\nlayer. Our calculated critical current densities for a representative\nCoFe/Cu/FePt structure show that the switching can be efficient for appropriate\nmaterial choices.
