Reconstructions can be propagated in a form of target\npropagation playing a role similar to back-propagation but helping to reduce\nthe reliance on derivatives in order to perform credit assignment across many\nlevels of possibly strong non-linearities (which is difficult for\nback-propagation). A regularized auto-encoder tends produce a reconstruction\nthat is a more likely version of its input, i.e., a small move in the direction\nof higher likelihood. By generalizing gradients, target propagation may also\nallow to train deep networks with discrete hidden units. If the auto-encoder\ntakes both a representation of input and target (or of any side information) in\ninput, then its reconstruction of input representation provides a target\ntowards a representation that is more likely, conditioned on all the side\ninformation. A deep auto-encoder decoding path generalizes gradient propagation\nin a learned way that can could thus handle not just infinitesimal changes but\nlarger, discrete changes, hopefully allowing credit assignment through a long\nchain of non-linear operations.

Therefore, we may approximate\ndelta distribution by Gaussian distribution with very small variance.

At low strains, the smectic layers\nare reoriented with layer-normals distributed in a plane perpendicular to the\nstretch direction. The system relaxes relatively slowly (time-constant ~ 45\nminutes) which is attributed to the flow properties of the LC layers embedded\nin the elastomer network. At high strains, the equilibration time (~ 4 - 8\nminutes) conforms to a faster relaxation and appears to have its origin in the\npolymer components of the system. Due to misaligned microdomains at small\nstrains, the value of global orientational order parameter S for the mesogenic\nparts is initially small (~ 0.15). With increasing strain, the local\ndomain-directors, the mesogens, and the polymer chains, all tend to align\nparallel to the stretch direction giving rise to a higher measured value of S ~\n0.83 at a strain of 4.0.

Then we minimize this\nfunction using an infeasible active-set method that was already successfully\napplied to similar problems. After this we update the Lagrange multiplier for\nthe equality constraints. Finally we try to solve convex quadratic program\ndirectly, again with the infeasible active-set method, starting from the\noptimal solution of the actual Lagrange function. Computational experience with\nour method indicates that typically only few (most of the time only one) outer\niterations (multiplier-updates) and also only few (most of the time less than\nten) inner iterations (minimization of the Lagrange function) are required to\nreach the optimal solution.\n  The diploma thesis is organized as follows. We close this chapter with some\nnota- tion used throughout. In Chapter 2 we show the equivalence of different\nQP problem formulations and present some important so-called direct methods for\nsolving equality-constrained QPs. We cover the most important aspects for\npractically successful interior point methods for linear and convex quadratic\nprogramming in Chapter 3.

Recently, MCTS was reported to be able to find near\noptimal schemes. However, several parameters had to be fine-tuned manually. In\nthis work, we investigate the state space properties of Horner schemes and find\nthat the domain is relatively flat and contains only a few local minima. As a\nresult, the Horner space is appropriate to be explored by Stochastic Local\nSearch (SLS), which has only two parameters: the number of iterations\n(computation time) and the neighborhood structure. We found a suitable\nneighborhood structure, leaving only the allowed computation time as a\nparameter. We performed a range of experiments. The results obtained by SLS are\nsimilar or better than those obtained by MCTS. Furthermore, we show that SLS\nobtains the good results at least 10 times faster.

One such phenomenon - Zeno executions - is\ncharacterized by an infinite number of discrete events or transitions occurring\nover a finite interval of time. This phenomenon is not necessarily undesirable\nand may indeed be used to capture physical phenomena. In this paper, we examine\nthe problem of proving the existence and stability of zero executions. Our\napproach is to develop a polynomial-time algorithm - based on the\nsum-of-squares methodology - for verifying the stability of a Zeno execution.\nWe begin by stating Lyapunov-like theorems for local Zeno stability based on\nexisting results. Then, for hybrid systems with polynomial vector fields, we\nuse polynomial Lyapunov functions and semialgebraic geometry\n(Positivstellensatz results) to reduce the local Lyapunov-like conditions to a\nconvex feasibility problem in polynomial variables. The feasibility problem is\nthen tested using an algorithm for sum-of-squares programming - SOSTOOLS. We\nalso extend these results to hybrid system with parametric uncertainty, where\nthe uncertain parameters lie in a semialgebriac set. We also provide several\nexamples illustrating the use of our technique.\n","Comment: Submitted to Automatica"]}]
