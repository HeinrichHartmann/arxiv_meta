Observed in all experiments, the ankle is usually\ninterpreted as transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays. Using the\nmass composition measured by HiRes, Telescope Array (TA) and Auger detectors at\nenergy (1-3) EeV, calculated anisotropy of galactic cosmic rays at these\nenergies, and the elongation curves we strongly argue against the\ninterpretation of the ankle given above.

The other\nprediction of this model, the shape of the dip, is well confirmed by HiRes, TA,\nAGASA and Yakutsk detectors, and, after recalibration of energies, by Auger\ndetector. Predicted beginning of GZK cutoff and E_{1/2} agree well with HiRes\nand TA data. However, directly measured mass composition remains a puzzle.\nWhile HiRes and TA detectors observe the proton-dominated mass composition, as\nrequired by the dip model, the data of Auger detector strongly evidence for\nnuclei mass composition becoming steadily heavier at energy higher than 4 EeV\nand reaching Iron at energy about 35 EeV. The Auger-based scenario is\nconsistent with another interpretation of the ankle at energy E_a=4 EeV as\ntransition from extragalactic protons to extragalactic nuclei.

These links have to be very well known to use the\nobserved frequency of different types of SN events for probing the star\nformation rate and massive star evolution in different types of galaxies.\n<Aims> We investigate the link between LBV as SN progenitors and the appearance\nof episodic radio light curve modulations of the SN event. <Methods> We use the\n20Msun and 25Msun models with rotation at solar metallicity, part of an\nextended grid of stellar models computed by the Geneva team. At their pre-SN\nstage, these two models have recently been shown to have spectra similar to\nthose of LBV stars and possibly explode as Type IIb SNe.

This structure is used as input for computing the SN\nradio light curve. <Results> We find that the 20Msun model shows radio light\ncurves with episodic luminosity modulations, similar to those observed in some\nType IIb SNe. This occurs because the evolution of the 20Msun model terminates\nin a region of the HR diagram where radiative stellar winds present strong\ndensity variations, caused by the bistability limit.

The\nAI mimics human experts and distinguishes pulsars from noise and interferences\nby looking for patterns from candidate. The information from each pulsar\ncandidate is synthesized in four diagnostic plots, which consist of up to\nthousands pixel of image data. The AI takes these data from each candidate as\nits input and uses thousands of such candidates to train its ~9000 neurons.\nDifferent from other pulsar selection programs which use pre-designed patterns,\nthe PICS AI teaches itself the salient features of different pulsars from a set\nof human-labeled candidates through machine learning. The deep neural networks\nin this AI system grant it superior ability in recognizing various types of\npulsars as well as their harmonic signals. The trained AI's performance has\nbeen validated with a large set of candidates different from the training set.\nIn this completely independent test, PICS ranked 264 out of 277 pulsar-related\ncandidates, including all 56 previously known pulsars, to the top 961 (1%) of\n90008 test candidates, missing only 13 harmonics.

In other\nwords, 100% of the pulsars were ranked in the top 1% of all candidates, while\n80% were ranked higher than any noise or interference.

It is shown that essential structural knowledge about the\nunknown data matrices in the data equation that relates Hankel matrices\nconstructed from input and output data can be used in the first step of the\nnumerical solution presented. The structural knowledge comprises the low rank\nproperty of a matrix that is the product of the extended observability matrix\nand the state sequence and the Toeplitz structure of the matrix of Markov\nparameters (of the system in innovation form). The new subspace identification\nmethod is referred to as the N2SID (twice the N of Nuclear Norm and SID for\nSubspace IDentification) method. In addition to include key structural\nknowledge in the solution it integrates the subspace calculation with\nminimization of a classical prediction error cost function. The nuclear norm\nrelaxation enables us to perform such integration while preserving convexity.\nThe advantages of N2SID are demonstrated in a numerical open- and closed-loop\nsimulation study. Here a comparison is made with another widely used SID\nmethod, i.e. N4SID. The comparison focusses on the identification with short\ndata batches, i.e. where the number of measurements is a small multiple of the\nsystem order.\n","Comment: Submitted to 2014 IFAC World Congress"]}]

The slowdown close to the transition is connected\nwith the emergence of the groups of mediator agents which are very small but\nhave decisive role in the process of social convergence. More detailed study\nshows that the histogram of the evolution times is composed of several peaks.\nThese peaks are unambiguously interpreted as corresponding to mediator groups\nconsisting of one, two, three etc. agents.

If neighbouring domains interact and share results, access to the\nspecific data needs to be synchronized to avoid race conditions. This is the\ncase for a variety of applications, like most molecular dynamics and many\ncomputational fluid dynamics codes. Here we present an unexpected problem which\ncan occur in dependency-driven task parallelization models like StarSs: the\ntasks accessing a specific spatial domain are treated as interdependent, as\ndependencies are detected automatically via memory addresses. Thus, the order\nin which tasks are generated will have a severe impact on the dependency tree.\nIn the worst case, a complete serialization is reached and no two tasks can be\ncalculated in parallel. We present the problem in detail based on an example\nfrom molecular dynamics, and introduce a theoretical framework to calculate the\ndegree of serialization. Furthermore, we present strategies to avoid this\nunnecessary problem. We recommend treating these strategies as best practice\nwhen using dependency-driven task parallel programming models like StarSs on\nsuch scenarios.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 9 figures, published at ISPA2012"]}]

However, there's still a lack of comprehensive\nstudies on chunk scheduling for the smooth playout of layered streams in P2P\nnetworks. In these situations, a playout smoothing mechanism can be used to\nensure the uniform delivery of the layered stream. This can be achieved by\nreducing the quality changes that the stream undergoes when adapting to\nchanging network conditions. This paper complements previous efforts in\nthroughput maximization and delay minimization for P2P streaming by considering\nthe consequences of playout smoothing on the scheduling mechanisms for stream\nlayer acquisition. The two main problems to be considered when designing a\nplayout smoothing mechanism for P2P streaming are the fluctuation in available\nbandwidth between peers and the unreliability of user-contributed\nresources--particularly peer churn. Since the consideration of these two\nfactors in the selection and scheduling of stream layers is crucial to maintain\nsmooth stream playout, the main objective of our smoothing mechanism becomes\nthe determination of how many layers\n"]}]
