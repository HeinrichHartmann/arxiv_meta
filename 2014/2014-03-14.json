If that mapping is not surjective, then the solution variety\nprojects into the input space in a singular way and the projection is a\nzero-measure set.

Evidence points towards a\nsecondary origin of the gas as opposed to being a direct remnant form the\ninitial protoplanetary disk, although the dominant gas production mechanism is\nso far not identified. The origin of the observed overabundance of C and O\ncompared to solar abundances of metallic elements, e.g. Na and Fe, is also\nunclear.

Methods: We used\nthe HIFI instrument onboard Herschel to observe and spectrally resolve CII\nemission at 158 $\\mu$m from the {\\beta} Pic debris disk. Assuming Keplerian\nrotation, we use the spectrally resolved line profile to constrain the spatial\ndistribution of the gas.

The data suggest that more gas is located on the\nsouthwest side of the disk than on the northeast side. The data are consistent\nwith the hypothesis of a well-mixed gas (constant C/Fe ratio throughout the\ndisk). Assuming instead a spatial profile expected from a simplified accretion\ndisk model, we found it to give a significantly worse fit to the observations.\nConclusions: Since the bulk of the gas is found outside 30 AU, we argue that\nthe cometary objects known as \"falling evaporating bodies\" are unlikely to be\nthe dominant source of gas; production from grain-grain collisions or\nphotodesorption seems more likely.

We find that the BN monolayer is the\nmost effective sheet to decouple the interlayer vdW coupling of the MoS2\nbilayer, and the resulting sandwich trilayer can recover the electronic\nstructures of the MoS2 monolayer, particularly the direct-gap character.\nFurther study of the MoS2/BN superlattices confirms the effectiveness of the BN\nmonolayer for the decoupling of the MoS2-MoS2 interaction. In addition, the\nintercalation of transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) MoSe2 or WSe2 sheet\nrenders the sandwich trilayer undergoing an indirect-gap to direct-gap\ntransition due to the newly formed heterogeneous S/Se interfaces. In contrast,\nthe MoS2/WS2/MoS2 sandwich trilayer still retains the indirect-gap character of\nthe MoS2 bilayer due to the lack of the heterogeneous S/Se interfaces.\nMoreover, the 3D superlattice of the MoS2/TMDC heterostructures also exhibits\nsimilar electronic band characters as the MoS2/TMDC/MoS2 trilayer\nheterostructures, albeit slight decrease of the bandgap than the trilayers.\nCompared to the bulk MoS2, the 3D MoS2/TMDC superlattice can give rise to new\nand distinctive properties.

In general, such complexity is seen to increase with the\ncomplexity of the organism, with a concomitant increase of the accuracy and\nspecificity of the cellular processes. The question thus arises how the\ncomplexification of systems - modeled here by simple interacting birth-death\ntype processes - can lead to a reduction of the noise - described by the\nvariance of the number of molecules. To gain understanding of this issue, we\ninvestigated the difference between a single system containing molecules that\nare produced and degraded, and the same system - with the same average number\nof molecules - connected to a buffer. We modeled these systems using Ito\nstochastic differential equations in discrete time, as they allow\nstraightforward analytical developments. In general, when the molecules in the\nsystem and the buffer are positively correlated, the variance on the number of\nmolecules in the system is found to decrease compared to the equivalent system\nwithout a buffer. Only buffers that are too noisy by themselves tend to\nincrease the noise in the main system. We tested this result on two model\ncases, in which the system and the buffer contain proteins in their active and\ninactive state, or protein monomers and homodimers. We found that in the second\ntest case, where the interconversion terms are non-linear in the number of\nmolecules, the noise reduction is much more pronounced; it reaches up to 20%\nreduction of the Fano factor with the parameter values tested in numerical\nsimulations on an unperturbed birth-death model.
