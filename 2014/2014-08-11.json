The identification of the carriers of diffuse interstellar bands\n(DIBs) remains one of the long-standing mysteries in astronomy. The detection\nof a polarisation signal in a DIB profile can be used to distinguish between a\ndust or gas-phase carrier. The polarisation profile can give additional\ninformation on the grain or molecular properties of the absorber. In order to\ndetect and measure the linear and circular polarisation of the DIBs we observed\nreddened lines of sight showing continuum polarisation. For this study we\nselected two stars HD 197770 and HD 194279. We used high-resolution (R~64.000)\nspectropolarimetry in the wavelength range from 3700 to 10480 Angstrom with the\nESPaDOnS echelle spectrograph mounted at the CFHT.\n  Results. High S/N and high resolution Stokes V (circular), Q and U (linear)\nspectra were obtained. We constrained upper limits by a factor of 10 for\npreviously observed DIBs. Furthermore, we analysed ~30 additional DIBs for\nwhich no spectropolarimetry data has been obtained before. This included the\n9577 A DIB and the 8621 A DIB.\n  Conclusions. The lack of polarisation in 45 DIB profiles suggests that none\nof the absorption lines is induced by a grain-type carrier. The strict upper\nlimits, less than ~0.01%, derived for the observed lines-of-sight imply that if\nDIBs are due to gas-phase molecules these carriers have polarisation\nefficiencies which are at least 6 times, and up to 300 times, smaller than\nthose predicted for grain-related carriers.\n","Comment: 6 pages + 13 pages online material, submitted to A&A"]}]

In this work,\nstrain effect on the electronic band structure of phosphorene was studied using\nfirst principles methods. It was found that phosphorene can withstand a surface\ntension and tensile strain up to 10 N/m and 30%, respectively. The band gap of\nphosphorene experiences a direct-indirect-direct transition when axial strain\nis applied. A moderate -2% compression in the zigzag direction can trigger this\ngap transition. With sufficient expansion (+11.3%) or compression (-10.2%\nstrains), the gap can be tuned from indirect to direct again. Five strain zones\nwith distinct electronic band structure were identified and the critical\nstrains for the zone boundaries were determined. The origin of the gap\ntransition was revealed and a general mechanism was developed to explain energy\nshifts with strain according to the bond nature of near-band-edge electronic\norbitals. Effective masses of carriers in the armchair direction are an order\nof magnitude smaller than that of the zigzag axis indicating the armchair\ndirection is favored for carrier transport. In addition, the effective masses\ncan be dramatically tuned by strain, in which its sharp jump/drop occurs at the\nzone boundaries of the direct-indirect gap transition.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 8 figures"]}]

A real-time prediction learner was implemented to predict\nimpact-related electrical load experienced by a robot limb; the learning\nsystem's predictions were then communicated to the device's user to aid in\ntheir interactions with a workspace.

We used the NCBI Disease corpus as a gold standard for refining and\nbenchmarking our crowdsourcing protocol. After several iterations, we arrived\nat a protocol that reproduced the annotations of the 593 documents in the\ntraining set of this gold standard with an overall F measure of 0.872\n(precision 0.862, recall 0.883). The output can also be tuned to optimize for\nprecision (max = 0.984 when recall = 0.269) or recall (max = 0.980 when\nprecision = 0.436). Each document was examined by 15 workers, and their\nannotations were merged based on a simple voting method. In total 145 workers\ncombined to complete all 593 documents in the span of 1 week at a cost of $.06\nper abstract per worker. The quality of the annotations, as judged with the F\nmeasure, increases with the number of workers assigned to each task such that\nthe system can be tuned to balance cost against quality. These results\ndemonstrate that microtask crowdsourcing can be a valuable tool for generating\nwell-annotated corpora in BioNLP.\n","Comment: Preprint of an article submitted for consideration in the Pacific\n  Symposium on Biocomputing copyright 2015; World Scientific Publishing Co.,\n  Singapore, 2015; http://psb.stanford.edu/.

It is the first such implementation for\nwhich an upper bound on amortized time complexity has been proved. In our\nimplementation, operations access the list via cursors. Each cursor is\nassociated with an item in the list and is local to a process. The\nimplementation supports two update operations, insertBefore and delete, and two\nmove operations, moveRight and moveLeft. An insertBefore(c, x) operation\ninserts an item x into the list immediately before the cursor c's location. A\ndelete(c) operation removes the item at the cursor c's location and sets the\ncursor to the next item in the list. The move operations move the cursor one\nposition to the right or left. The update operations use single-word\nCompare&Swap instructions. The move operations only read shared memory and\nnever change the state of the data structure. If all update operations modify\ndifferent parts of the list, they run completely concurrently. Let cp(op) be\nthe maximum number of active cursors at any one time during the operation op.\nThe amortized complexity of each update operation op is O(cp(op)) and each move\noperation is O(1).

We are particularly\nconcerned by the time between these extreme events, called respectively waiting\ntime and quiet time. If the thresholds are high enough it is possible to\njustify the existence of scaling laws for the probability distribution of the\ntimes as a function of the threshold value, although the scaling functions are\ndifferent in each case. For point processes, in addition to the trivial Poisson\nprocess, one can obtain double-power-law distributions with no finite mean\nvalue. This is justified in the context of renormalization-group\ntransformations, where such distributions arise as limiting distributions after\niterations of the transformation. Clear connections with the generalized\ncentral limit theorem are established from here. The non-existence of finite\nmoments leads to a semi-parametric scaling law in terms of the sample mean\nwaiting time, in which the (usually unkown) scale parameter is eliminated but\nnot the exponents. In the case of time series, scaling can arise by considering\nrandom-walk-like signals with absorbing boundaries, resulting in distributions\nwith a power-law \"bulk\" and a faster decay for long times. For large thresholds\nthe moments of the quiet-time distribution show a power-law dependence with the\nscale parameter, and isolation of the latter and of the exponents leads to a\nnon-parametric scaling law in terms only of the moments of the distribution.\nConclusions about the projections of changes in the occurrence of natural\nhazards lead to the necessity of distinguishing the behavior of the mean of the\ndistribution with the behavior of the extreme events.\n","Comment: Submitted to a Chaos, Solitons and Fractals special issue on Extreme\n  Events"]}]
