Parrondo's game consists of two individual games, game A\nand game B. Game A is a slightly losing coin-tossing game. Game B has two\ncoins, with an integer parameter $M$. If the current cumulative capital (in\ndiscrete unit) is a multiple of $M$, an unfavorable coin $p_b$ is used,\notherwise a favorable $p_g$ coin is used. Paradoxically, combination of game A\nand game B could lead to a winning game, which is the Parrondo effect. We\nextend the original Parrondo's game to include the possibility of $M$ being\neither $M_1$ or $M_2$. Also, we distinguish between strong Parrondo effect,\ni.e. two losing games combine to form a winning game, and weak Parrondo effect,\ni.e. two games combine to form a better-performing game. We find that when\n$M_2$ is not a multiple of $M_1$, the combination of $B(M_1)$ and $B(M_2)$ has\nstrong and weak Parrondo effect for some subsets in the parameter space\n$(p_b,p_g)$, while there is neither strong nor weak effect when $M_2$ is a\nmultiple of $M_1$.

It appears possible that some of them originate from stellar\nexplosions induced by the pair instability mechanism. Recent stellar evolution\nmodels also predict pair instability supernovae (PISNe) from very massive stars\nat fairly high metallicities (i.e. Z~0.004). We provide supernova (SN) models\nand synthetic light curves for two progenitor models, a 150 Msun red-supergiant\nand a 250 Msun yellow-supergiant at a metallicity of Z=0.001, for which the\nevolution from the main sequence to collapse, and the initiation of the PISN\nitself, has been previously computed in a realistic and self-consistent way. We\nare using the radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA to describe the SN evolution\nof both models over a time frame of about 500 days. We describe the\nshock-breakout phases of both SNe which are characterized by a higher\nluminosity, a longer duration and a lower effective temperature than those of\nordinary SNeIIP. We derive the bolometric as well as the U, B, V, R and I light\ncurves of our PISN models, which show a long-lasting plateau phase with maxima\nat Mbol=-19.3 mag and -21.3 mag for our lower and higher mass model,\nrespectively. We also describe the photospheric composition and velocity as\nfunction of time. We conclude that the light curve of the explosion of our\ninitially 150 Msun star resembles those of relatively bright SNeIIP, whereas\nits photospheric velocity at early times is smaller. Its 56Ni mass of 0.04 Msun\nalso falls well into the range found in ordinary core collapse SNe. The light\ncurve and photospheric velocity of our 250 Msun models has a striking\nresemblance with that of the superluminous SN2007bi, strengthening its\ninterpretation as PISN.

As preprocessing of quantum error correction, our\nscheme estimates the current noise level through a negligible amount of\nclassical computation using error syndromes and updates the decoder's knowledge\non the spot before inferring the locations of errors. This preprocessing\nrequires no additional quantum interaction or modification in the system. The\nestimate can be of higher quality than the maximum likelihood estimate based on\nperfect knowledge of channel parameters, thereby eliminating the need of the\nunrealistic assumption that the decoder accurately knows channel parameters a\npriori. Simulations demonstrate that not only can the decoder pick up on a\nchange of channel parameters, but even if the channel stays the same, a quantum\nlow-density parity-check code can perform better when the decoder exploits the\non-the-spot estimates instead of the true error probabilities of the quantum\nchannel.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 1 figure"]}]

OSNs allow users to change their\nonline attributes with time, to reflect changes in their real-life. Temporal\nchanges in users' content and network attributes have been well studied in\nliterature, however little research has explored temporal changes in profile\nattributes of online users. This work makes the first attempt to study changes\nto a unique profile attribute of a user - username and on a popular OSN which\nallows users to change usernames multiple times - Twitter. We collect, monitor\nand analyze 8.7 million Twitter users at macroscopic level and 10,000 users at\nmicroscopic level to understand username changing behavior. We find that around\n10% of monitored Twitter users opt to change usernames for possible reasons\nsuch as space gain, followers gain, and username promotion. Few users switch\nback to any of their past usernames, however prefer recently dropped usernames\nto switch back to. Users who change usernames are more active and popular than\nusers who don't. In-degree, activity and account creation year of users are\nweakly correlated with their frequency of username change. We believe that past\nusernames of a user and their associated benefits inferred from the past, can\nhelp Twitter to suggest its users a set of suitable usernames to change to.\nPast usernames may also help in other applications such as searching and\nlinking multiple OSN accounts of a user and correlating multiple Twitter\nprofiles to a single user.\n"]}]

To\nfind out the result of a measurement on a particular circuit, we consider a\nweighted distribution of histories between some initial and final time, such\nthat each individually obeys ordinary quantum mechanics. The weight of a\nparticular history is given by a joint distribution over the values of a part\nof the system dubbed the time machine, at two chosen times. In the dual\npost-selection picture the weight is simply the probability for the 'periodic\nbit' to satisfy the constraint, plus a small noise part, often assumed\nconstant, representing the error rate of the time machine's channel. The\nemerging bit is one of a Bell pair, its partner kept in reserve to test that\nthe bit entering the time machine later matches the one which emerged. This is\ndone by interfering the incoming bit with the reserve member of the pair and\nkeeping the experimental runs that interfere constructively. Noise can be\neffectively simulated by keeping a small proportion of runs that interfere\ndestructively, or by perturbing the reserve bit to decohere it by a similar\namount. Paradoxes remain but are tractable.\n"]}]

The structure of the dual is now radically different, and an\ninteresting generalization of the $q$-exponential appears in the formulas for\nthe Universal T- and R-matrices.

Returning to the general case, we study deformations of\nthe standard R-matrix and the associated Hopf algebras. A preliminary\ninvestigation of the first order deformations uncovers a class of deformations\nthat incompasses the quantization of all Kac-Moody algebras of finite and\naffine type. The corresponding exact deformations are described as generalized\ntwists, $ R_\\epsilon = (F^t)^{-1}RF$, where $R$ is the standard R-matrix and\nthe cocycle $F$ (a power series in the deformation parameter $\\epsilon$) is the\nsolution of a linear recursion relation of the same type as that which\ndetermines $R$. Included here is the universal R-matrix for the elliptic\nquantum groups associated with $sl(n)$, a big surprise! Specializing again, to\nthe case of quantized Kac-Moody algebras, and taking the classical limit of\nthese esoteric quantum groups, one re-discovers all the trigonometric and\nelliptic r-matrices of Belavin and Drinfeld. The formulas obtained here are\neasier to use than the original ones, and the structure of the space of\nclassical r-matrices is more transparent. The r-matrices obtained here are more\ngeneral in that they are defined on the full Kac-Moody algebras, the central\nextensions of the loop groups.\n","Comment: 62 pages, plain Tex.

This paper calculates deformations of standard quantum groups (with\nor without spectral parameter) in the category of quasi-Hopf algebras. An\nearlier investigation of the deformations of quantum groups, in the category of\nHopf algebras, showed that quantum groups are generically rigid: Hopf algebra\ndeformations exist only under some restrictions on the parameters. In\nparticular, affine Kac-Moody algebras are more rigid than their loop algebra\nquotients; and only the latter (in the case of sl(n)) can be deformed to\nelliptic Hopf algebras. The generalization to quasi-Hopf deformations lifts\nthis restriction. The full elliptic quantum groups (with central extension)\nassociated with $sl(n)$ are thus quasi-Hopf algebras. The universal R-matrices\nsatisfy a modified Yang-Baxter relation and are calculated more or less\nexplicitly. The modified classical Yang-Baxter relation is obtained, and the\nelliptic solutions are worked out explicitly.
