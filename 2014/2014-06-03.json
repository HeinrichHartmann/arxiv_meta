Algorithms commonly used in the analysis of such\nlarge-scale data often depend on a complete set. Missing value imputation\noffers a solution to this problem. However, the majority of available\nimputation methods are restricted to one type of variable only: continuous or\ncategorical. For mixed-type data the different types are usually handled\nseparately. Therefore, these methods ignore possible relations between variable\ntypes.

The exhibition focuses on understanding of\nthe external field frequency and amplitude effect on the overall behavior of\nsystem for several powerful treatments. The particular attention has been paid\non the dynamical parametric evolution of the special point at which the\ncritical temperature of the three-dimensional infinite bulk system, where the\nsurface and the modified exchange parameter are of no importance. Important\ncharacteristics of the films, such as surface enhancement phenomenon, effect of\nthickness on the dynamic process etc. have been introduced together with well\nknown other characteristics. An attempt has been made to explain the relations\nbetween the competing time scales (intrinsic microscopic relaxation time of the\nsystem and the time period of the external oscillatory field) and frequency\ndispersion of the critical temperature coordinate of the special point.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 7 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1206.5425"]}]

When combining\nthis fact with the motivation from fundamental theory for shift-symmetric\nscalars (moduli) prior to SUSY breaking, this leads to a non-thermal history\nfor the early universe. Such a history implies different expectations for the\nmicroscopic properties of dark matter, as well as the possibility of dark\nradiation and a cosmic axion background. In this paper we examine how\ncorrelated and mixed isocurvature perturbations are generated in such models,\nas well as the connection to dark radiation. WMAP constraints on multiple\ncorrelated isocurvature modes allow up to half of the primordial perturbations\nto be isocurvature, contrary to the case of a single isocurvature mode where\nperturbations must be dominantly adiabatic. However, such bounds are strongly\nprior dependent, and have not been investigated with the latest Planck data. In\nthis paper we use the example of a SUSY non-thermal history to establish\ntheoretical priors on cosmological parameters. Of particular interest, we find\nthat priors on dark radiation are degenerate with those on the total amount of\nisocurvature -- they are inversely correlated. Dark radiation is tightly\nconstrained in the early universe and has been used recently to place stringent\nconstraints on string-based approaches to beyond the standard model. Our\nresults suggest such constraints can require more input from theory.

Here we study the contribution of\ninhibition-dominated random recurrent networks to orientation selectivity, and\nmore generally to sensory processing. By simulating and analyzing large-scale\nnetworks of spiking neurons, we investigate tuning amplification and contrast\ninvariance of orientation selectivity in these networks. In particular, we show\nhow selective attenuation of the common mode and amplification of the\nmodulation component take place in these networks. Selective attenuation of the\nbaseline, which is governed by the exceptional eigenvalue of the connectivity\nmatrix, removes the unspecific, redundant signal component and ensures the\ninvariance of selectivity across different contrasts. Selective amplification\nof modulation, which is governed by the operating regime of the network and\ndepends on the strength of coupling, amplifies the informative signal component\nand thus increases the signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we perform a mean-field\nanalysis which accounts for this process.\n","Comment: 19 figures"]}]

As an example, the semiconductor technologies\nare used to highlight the complexities especially with respect to energy and\nwater consumption. The need for specific representations and metric to\nseparately assess products and technologies is discussed. It is highlighted\nthat applying product-oriented approaches would result in abandoning or\ndisfavoring of new technologies that could otherwise help toward a better\nworld. Second, several believed-untouchable hot spots are highlighted to\nemphasize on their importance and footprint. The list includes, but not limited\nto, i) User Computer-Interfaces (UCIs), especially screens and displays, ii)\nNetwork-Computer Interlaces (NCIs), such as electronic and optical ports, and\niii) electricity power interfaces. In addition, considering cross-regional\nsocial and economic impacts, and also taking into account the marketing nature\nof the need for many ICT's product and services in both forms of hardware and\nsoftware, the complexity of End of Life (EoL) stage of ICT products,\ntechnologies, and services is explored. Finally, the impact of smart management\nand intelligence, and in general software, in ICT solutions and products is\nhighlighted. In particular, it is observed that, even using the same\ntechnology, the significance of software could be highly variable depending on\nthe level of intelligence and awareness deployed. With examples from an\ninterconnected network of data centers managed using Dynamic Voltage and\nFrequency Scaling (DVFS) technology and smart cooling systems, it is shown that\nthe unadjusted assessments could be highly uncertain, and even inconsistent, in\ncalculating the management component's significance on the ICT impacts.\n","Comment: 10 pages.

Here it is\nshown that thermodynamics itself dictates a kind of temperature suppression\ninside each small cluster in any gas-cluster mixture. This gives a different\nperspective on the \"translation-rotation\" paradox in that this gives a time\naveraged steady state thermal inhomogeneity rather than just temporal\nfluctuations in the energy. This not only reduces the barrier to nucleation but\nalso suggests a change in the thermal radiation spectrum from such a mixture\nthat is not just a result of the inhibited radiation spectrum from Mie\nradiators. Either verification or refutation of this effect will be shown have\nimportant consequences for thermodynamics.

We used previously published phase curves of the planet\nthat were reproduced over the full range of phase angles with model predictions\nbased on a realistic description of the Venus atmosphere. We assumed that the\noptical properties of the planet as a whole can be described by a uniform and\nstable cloud cover, an assumption that agrees well with observational evidence.\nResults.

While these properties are rather\npoorly known for galactic and interstellar plasmas due to the lack of in situ\nmeasurements, the heliospheric plasma environment has been probed by spacecraft\nfor decades and provides a unique opportunity for testing transport theories.\nOf particular interest for the 3D heliospheric transport of energetic particles\nare structures such as corotating interaction regions (CIRs), which, due to\nstrongly enhanced magnetic field strengths, turbulence, and associated shocks,\ncan act as diffusion barriers on the one hand, but also as accelerators of low\nenergy CRs on the other hand as well. In a two-fold series of papers we\ninvestigate these effects by modeling inner-heliospheric solar wind conditions\nwith a numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) setup (this paper), which will serve\nas an input to a transport code employing a stochastic differential equation\n(SDE) approach (second paper).

This technique is particularly attractive for a\ncomparison of the two transitions because distinct features in the spectra can\nbe associated with the direct and indirect gaps. However, detailed modeling of\nthese room temperature spectra is required to extract the band gap values with\nthe high accuracy required to determine the Sn concentration $y_{c}$ at which\nthe alloy becomes a direct gap semiconductor. For the direct gap, this is\naccomplished using a microscopic model that allows the determination of direct\ngap energies with meV accuracy. For the indirect gap, it is shown that current\ntheoretical models are inadequate to describe the emission properties of\nsystems with close indirect and direct transitions. Accordingly, an ad hoc\nprocedure is used to extract the indirect gap energies from the data. For $y$ <\n0.1 the resulting direct gap compositional dependence is given by $\\Delta E_{0}\n= -(3.57 \\pm 0.06)y$ (in eV). For the indirect gap, the corresponding\nexpression is $\\Delta E_{\\text{ind}} = -(1.64\\pm 0.10)y$ (in eV).
