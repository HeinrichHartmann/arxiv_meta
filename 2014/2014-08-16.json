Colloids are\ntreated as hard spheres with a directional conical asssociation site. We\nrestrict the system such that only patches between unlike species share\nattractions; meaning there are AB attractions but no AA or BB attractions. The\ntheory is derived in Wertheim's two density formalism for one site associating\nfluids. Since the patches are doubly bondable, associated chains, of all chain\nlengths, as well as 4-mer rings consisting of two species A and two species B\ncolloids are accounted for. With the restriction of only AB attractions,\ntriatomic rings of doubly bonded colloids, which dominate the corresponding\npure component case, cannot form. The theory is shown to be in good agreement\nwith Monte Carlo simulaion data for the structure and thermodynamics of these\npatchy colloid mixtures as a function of temperature, density, patch size and\ncomposition. It is shown that 4-mer rings dominate at low temperatures,\ninhibiting the polymerization of the mixture into long chains. Mixtures of this\ntype have been recently synthesized by researchers. This work provides the\nfirst theory capable of accurately modelling these mixtures.\n"]}]
