A characteristic\nfeature of vacuum energy is that it has a pressure with the same amplitude, but\nopposite sign to its energy density, while all the precision tests of General\nRelativity are either in vacuum, or for media with negligible pressure.\nTherefore, one may wonder whether an anomalous coupling to pressure might be\nresponsible for decoupling vacuum from gravity.

First, we show that the fairly common idea according to\nwhich this pattern is decaying in \"modern\" societies is not altogether true.\nFor instance, around 2000, in well urbanized countries like South Korea or\nSpain this pattern was still as strong as it was in France (and other European\ncountries) in the late 19th century.

More specifically, we try two decompositions of monthly\nsuicides: (i) according to suicide methods (ii) according to age-groups.\n  The first decomposition points out the key-role of hanging and drowning. The\nsecond shows the crucial role of the $ 15-20 $ and $ 65+ $ age-groups. Then, we\npresent a number of cases in which age-group decomposition provides adequate\npredictions.

To address this issue, one popular\napproach is convex relaxation. However, such an approach may produce suboptimal\nestimators due to the relaxation effect. To optimally estimate sparse principal\nsubspaces, we propose a two-stage computational framework named \"tighten after\nrelax\": Within the 'relax' stage, we approximately solve a convex relaxation of\nsparse PCA with early stopping to obtain a desired initial estimator; For the\n'tighten' stage, we propose a novel algorithm called sparse orthogonal\niteration pursuit (SOAP), which iteratively refines the initial estimator by\ndirectly solving the underlying nonconvex problem. A key concept of this\ntwo-stage framework is the basin of attraction. It represents a local region\nwithin which the `tighten' stage has desired computational and statistical\nguarantees. We prove that, the initial estimator obtained from the 'relax'\nstage falls into such a region, and hence SOAP geometrically converges to a\nprincipal subspace estimator which is minimax-optimal within a certain model\nclass. Unlike most existing sparse PCA estimators, our approach applies to the\nnon-spiked covariance models, and adapts to non-Gaussianity as well as\ndependent data settings. Moreover, through analyzing the computational\ncomplexity of the two stages, we illustrate an interesting phenomenon that\nlarger sample size can reduce the total iteration complexity.
