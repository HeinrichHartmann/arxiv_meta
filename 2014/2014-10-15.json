However, a degeneracy\nin the information carried by gravitational waves between the total rest-frame\nmass $M$ and the redshift $z$ of the source implies that neither can be\ndirectly extracted from the signal, but only the combination $M(1+z)$, the\nredshifted mass. Recent work has shown that for binary neutron star systems, a\ntidal correction to the gravitational-wave phase in the late-inspiral signal\nthat depends on the rest-frame source mass could be used to break the\nmass-redshift degeneracy. We propose here to use the signature encoded in the\npost-merger signal to deduce the redshift to the source. This will allow an\naccurate extraction of the intrinsic rest-frame mass of the source, in turn\npermitting the determination of source redshift and luminosity distance solely\nfrom gravitational-wave observations. This will herald a new era in precision\ncosmography and astrophysics. Using numerical simulations of binary neutron\nstar mergers of very slightly different mass, we model gravitational-wave\nsignals at different redshifts and use Bayesian parameter estimation to\ndetermine the accuracy with which the redshift can be extracted for a source of\nknown mass. We find that the Einstein Telescope can determine the source\nredshift to $sim 10$--$20%$ at redshifts of $z<0.04$.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures; same as the version before except for\n  acknowledgments"]}]

Scalar masses arise from one-loop finite contributions as\nwell as direct gravity-mediated contributions. Like split supersymmetry, one\nHiggs doublet is fine-tuned to be light. The scale at which the Dirac gauginos\nare introduced to make the Higgs quartic zero is the same as is necessary for\ngauge coupling unification. Thus, gauge coupling unification persists\n(nontrivially, due to adjoint multiplets), though with a somewhat higher\nunification scale $\\gtrsim 10^{17}$ GeV. The $\\mu$-term is naturally at the\nweak scale, and provides an opportunity for experimental verification. We\npresent two manifestations of Split Dirac Supersymmetry. In the \"Pure Dirac\"\nmodel, the lightest Higgsino must decay through R-parity violating couplings,\nleading to an array of interesting signals in colliders. In the \"Hypercharge\nImpure\" model, the bino acquires a Majorana mass that is one-loop suppressed\ncompared with the Dirac gluino and wino.

We consider the dependence of the spike signal on\nastrophysical and particle parameters and conclude that if the GC excess is due\nto DM, then a canonical adiabatic spike is disfavored by the data. We discuss\nalternative Galactic histories that predict different spike signals, including:\n(i) the nonadiabatic growth of the black hole, possibly associated with halo\nand/or black hole mergers, (ii) gravitational interaction of DM with baryons in\nthe dense core, such as heating by stars, or (iii) DM self-interactions. We\nemphasize that the spike signal is sensitive to a different combination of\nparticle parameters than the halo signal, and that the inclusion of a spike\ncomponent to any DM signal in future analyses would provide novel information\nabout both the history of the GC and the particle physics of DM annihilations.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures"]}]

Breaking the symmetries that\nunderlie the gapless nature of the surface modes is predicted to give rise to\nexotic new states of matter. In particular, it has recently been predicted and\nshown that breaking of time reversal symmetry in the form of ferromagnetism can\ngive rise to a gapped state characterized by a zero magnetic field quantized\nHall response and dissipationless longitudinal transport known as the Quantum\nAnomalous Hall (QAH) state. A key question that has thus far remained\nexperimentally unexplored is the relationship of this new type of quantum Hall\nstate with the previously known orbitally driven quantum Hall states. Here, we\nshow experimentally that a ferromagnetic topological insulator exhibiting the\nQAH state is well described by the global phase diagram of the quantum Hall\neffect. By mapping the behavior of the conductivity tensor in the parameter\nspace of temperature, magnetic field, and chemical potential in the vicinity of\nthe QAH phase, we find evidence for quantum criticality and delocalization\nbehavior that can quantitatively be described by the renormalization group\nproperties of the quantum Hall ground state. This result demonstrates that the\nQAH state observed in ferromagnetic topological insulators can be understood\nwithin the context of the law of corresponding states which governs the quantum\nHall state. This suggests a roadmap for studying the QAH effect including\ntransitions to possible adjacent topologically non-trivial states and a\npossible universality class for the QAH transition.\n","Comment: Nature Physics, forthcoming. 15 pages, 4 figures"]}]

We\nespecially wish to know when the spin-down flow forced by the mass loss\nsupersedes the baroclinic flows that pervade the radiative envelope of rotating\nstars. We consider a Boussinesq fluid enclosed in a rigid sphere whose flows\nare forced both by the baroclinic torque, the spin-down of an outer layer, and\nan outward mass flux. The spin-down forcing is idealized in two ways: either by\na rigid layer that imposes its spinning down velocity at some interface or by a\nturbulent layer that imposes a stress at this same interface to the interior of\nthe star. In the case where the layer is rigid and imposes its velocity, we\nfind that, as the mass-loss rate increases, the flow inside the star shows two\ntransitions: the meridional circulation associated with baroclinic flows is\nfirst replaced by its spin-down counterpart, while at much stronger mass-loss\nrates the baroclinic differential rotation is superseded by the spin-down\ndifferential rotation. In fact, we find three wind regimes: weak (or no wind),\nmoderate, and strong. In the first case, the flow in the radiative envelope is\nof baroclinic origin. In the moderate case, the circulation results from the\nspin-down while the differential rotation may either be of baroclinic or of\nspin-down origin, depending on the coupling between mass and angular momentum\nlosses. For fast rotating stars, our model says that the moderate wind regime\nstarts when mass loss is higher than ~1e-11 Msun/yr. In the strong wind case,\nthe flow in the radiative envelope is mainly driven by angular momentum\nadvection. This latter transition depends on the mass and the rotation rate of\nthe star, being around 1e-8 Msun/yr for a 3 Msun ZAMS star rotating at 200 km/s\naccording to our model.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 9 figures, to appear in Astronomy and Astrophysics"]}]

VMS have strong stellar winds and extremely high\nionising fluxes, which are thought to be critical sources of both mechanical\nand radiative feedback in giant Hii regions. However, how VMS mass-loss\nproperties change during stellar evolution is poorly understood. In the\nframework of the VLT-Flames Tarantula Survey (VFTS), we explore the mass-loss\ntransition region from optically thin O to denser WNh star winds, thereby\ntesting theoretical predictions.

We analyzed the molecular gas mass derived from\nCO(1-0), MH2, and its kinematics, and then compared it to the mass of the warm\nmolecular gas, the stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR). Our results are\nthe following. (i) The mass ratio between the CO-derived and the warm H2\nmolecular gas is in the same range as for field galaxies. (ii) Some galaxies,\nmostly MOHEGs, have very broad CO linewidths of up to 1000 kms. The line shapes\nare irregular and show various components. (iii) The mapped objects show\nasymmetric distributions of the cold molecular gas. (iv) The star formation\nefficiency (= SFR/MH2) of galaxies in HCGs is similar to isolated galaxies. No\nsignificant difference between MOHEGs and non-MOHEGs or between early-types and\nspirals has been found. (v) The molecular gas masses, MH2, and MH2/LK are lower\nin MOHEGs (predominantly early-types) than in non-MOHEGs (predominantly\nspirals). This trend remains when comparing MOHEGs and non-MOHEGs of the same\nmorphological type.

The first gamma-ray pulsars to be detected were the most\nintense and/or those with narrow pulses. Aims: As the Fermi mission progresses,\nprogressively fainter objects can be studied. In addition to more distant\npulsars (thus probing a larger volume of the Galaxy), or ones in high\nbackground regions (thus improving the sampling uniformity across the Galactic\nplane), we detect pulsars with broader pulses or lower luminosity. Adding\npulsars to our catalog with inclination angles that are rare in the observed\nsample, and/or with lower spindown power, will reduce the bias in the currently\nknown gamma-ray pulsar population. Methods: We use rotation ephemerides derived\nfrom radio observations to phase-fold gamma rays recorded by the Fermi Large\nArea Telescope, to then determine the pulse profile properties. Spectral\nanalysis provides the luminosities and, when the signal-to-noise ratio allows,\nthe cutoff energies.

The scheme is compared to results calculated from a `classical'\nprescription. Using our stellar binary evolution code BINSTAR, we calculate the\norbital evolution of Algol binaries undergoing case A and case B mass transfer,\nby applying the osculating scheme.

This allows us to determine the\nchange of linear momentum of each star, and the gravitational force applied by\nthe mass transfer stream. Torques applied on the stellar spins by tides and\nmass transfer are also considered. Using the osculating formalism gives shorter\npost-mass transfer orbital periods typically by a factor of 4 compared to the\nclassical scheme, owing to the gravitational force applied onto the stars by\nthe mass transfer stream. Additionally, during the rapid phase of mass\nexchange, the donor star is spun down on a timescale shorter than the tidal\nsynchronization timescale, leading to sub-synchronous rotation. Consequently,\nbetween 15 and 20 per cent of the material leaving the inner-Lagrangian point\nis accreted back onto the donor (so-called `self-accretion'), further enhancing\norbital shrinkage. Self-accretion, and the sink of orbital angular momentum\nwhich mass transfer provides, may potentially lead to more contact binaries.\nEven though Algols are mainly considered, the osculating prescription is\napplicable to all types of interacting binaries, including those with eccentric\norbits.\n","Comment: A&A in press.

The evolution of the magnetic flux in active regions is\ncomputed using a surface flux transport model fed with the observed record of\nsunspot group areas and positions. The magnetic flux in ephemeral regions is\ntreated separately using the concept of overlapping cycles. To model the\nephemeral region cycles, we assume that their length and amplitude are related\nto that of the sunspot cycles. We then use a version of the SATIRE model to\ncompute the TSI. The area coverage and the distribution of different magnetic\nfeatures as a function of time, which are required by SATIRE, are extracted\nfrom the simulated magnetograms and the modelled ephemeral region magnetic\nflux.

Here we present the design and\nnumerical study of a zoned metamaterial lens with such characteristics, for\npossible deployment with the 83-130 GHz ECE radiometer in the DIII-D tokamak.\nThe lens consists of a concentric array of miniaturized element phase-shifters.\nThese were reverse-engineered starting from the desired Gaussian beam waist\nlocations and further optimized to account for diffraction and finite-aperture\neffects that tend to displace the waist. At the same time we imposed high and\nuniform transmittance, averaged over all phase-shifters. The focal length is\nshown to increase from 1.37 m to 1.97 m over the frequency range of interest,\nas desired for low-field DIII-D discharges (B = -1.57 T). Retracting the lens\nto receded positions rigidly moves the waists accordingly, resulting in a good\nmatch -within a fraction of the Rayleigh length- of the EC-emitting layer\npositions at higher fields (up to B = -2.00 T). Further, it is shown how\nvarying the lens aperture might move the waists \"non-rigidly\" to better match\nthe non-rigid movement of the EC-emitting layers with the magnetic field. The\nnumerical method presented is very general and can be used to engineer any\ndependence of the focal length on the frequency, including zero or minimal\nchromatic aberration.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 9 figures,\n  http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10762-013-9987-1"]}]

The novelty of approach lies therein - using only language\nagnostic techniques, while achieving competitive performance.\n  Our method learns distributed word representations (word embeddings) which\nencode semantic and syntactic features of words in each language. Then, we\nautomatically generate datasets from Wikipedia link structure and Freebase\nattributes. Finally, we apply two preprocessing stages (oversampling and exact\nsurface form matching) which do not require any linguistic expertise.\n  Our evaluation is two fold: First, we demonstrate the system performance on\nhuman annotated datasets.
