To address this issue, we\nuse a split version of the proximal point algorithm for minimizing a sum of\nconvex functions and prove that this algorithm produces a sequence converging\nto a minimizer of the objective function, which extends a recent result of D.\nBertsekas (2001) into Hadamard spaces. The method is quite robust and not only\ndoes it yield algorithms for the median and the mean, but it also applies to\nvarious other optimization problems. We moreover show that another algorithm\nfor computing the Frechet mean can be derived from the law of large numbers due\nto K.-T. Sturm (2002). In applications, computing medians and means is probably\nmost needed in tree space, which is an instance of an Hadamard space, invented\nby Billera, Holmes, and Vogtmann (2001) as a tool for averaging phylogenetic\ntrees. It turns out, however, that it can be also used to model numerous other\ntree-like structures. Since there now exists a polynomial-time algorithm for\ncomputing geodesics in tree space due to M. Owen and S. Provan (2011), we\nobtain efficient algorithms for computing medians and means, which can be\ndirectly used in practice.\n","Comment: Corrected version.

In analogy with the\nconfiguration-interaction singles (CIS), singles-and-doubles (CISD),\nsingles-doubles-and-triples (CISDT) methods in quantum chemistry, the\nTD-RASSCF-S, -SD, and -SDT methods are introduced as extensions of the\nTD-RASSCF dou- bles (-D) method [Phys.

For the 1D\nberyllium atom, a state-resolved analysis of the HHG spectrum based on the\ntime-independent HF orbitals shows that while only single-orbital excitations\nare needed in the region below the cutoff, single- and double-orbital\nexcitations are es- sential beyond, where accordingly the\nsingle-active-electron (SAE) approximation and the TDCIS method break down. On\nthe other hand, the TD-RASSCF-S and -D methods accurately describe the\nmulti-orbital excitation processes throughout the entire region of the HHG\nspectrum. For the 1D carbon atom, our calculations show that multi-orbital\nexcitations are essential in the HHG process even below the cutoff. Hence, in\nthis test system a very accurate treatment of electron correlation is required.\nThe TD-RASSCF-S and -D approaches meet this demand, while the SAE approximation\nand the TDCIS method are inadequate.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 8 figures"]}]

Here, we report the realization of\nmodulation and reversal of large magnetization (M) by E in a multiferroic\ncrystal Ba0.5Sr1.5Zn2(Fe0.92Al0.08)12O22, in which a transverse conical spin\nstate exhibits a remanent M and electric polarization below ~150 K. Upon\nsweeping E between +- 2 MV/m, M is quasi-linearly varied between +- 2\n{\\mu}B/f.u., resulting in the M reversal. Moreover, the remanent M shows\nnon-volatile changes of {\\Delta}M = +- 0.15 {\\mu}B/f.u., depending on the\nhistory of the applied electric fields. The large modulation and the\nnon-volatile two-states of M at zero magnetic field are observable up to ~150 K\nwhere the transverse conical spin state is stabilized. Nuclear magnetic\nresonance measurements provide microscopic evidences that the electric field\nand the magnetic field play an equivalent role, rendering the volume of\nmagnetic domains change accompanied by the domain wall motion. The present\nfindings point to a new pathway for realizing the large magnetization reversal\nby electric fields at fairly high temperatures.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 7 figures, originally submitted version"]}]
