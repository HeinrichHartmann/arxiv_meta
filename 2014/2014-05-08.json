Aims: To empirically determine the radial\nvelocity (RV) precision of GES data, construct a kinematically unbiased sample\nof cluster members and characterise their dynamical state. Methods: Targets\nwere selected from colour-magnitude diagrams and intermediate resolution\nspectroscopy used to derive RVs and assess membership from the strength of the\nLi6708A line.

Results: The GES RV precision\nis about 0.25km/s and sufficient to resolve velocity structure in the low-mass\npopulation around gamma^2 Vel. The structure is well fitted by two kinematic\ncomponents with roughly equal numbers of stars; the first has an intrinsic\ndispersion of 0.34+/-0.16km/s, consistent with virial equilibrium. The second\nhas a broader dispersion of 1.60+/-0.37km/s and is offset from the first by\n~2km/s.

We use synchrotron emission\nprocess to explain the observed non-thermal X-ray fluxes from different regions\nof the shell. These result in estimation of the model parameters, which are\nthen used to explain TeV gamma-ray emission spectrum. We also use hadronic\nscenario to explain both GeV and TeV fluxes simultaneously. We show that a\nleptonic model alone cannot explain the GeV-TeV data. Therefore, we need to\ninvoke a hadronic model to explain the observed GeV-TeV fluxes.

The LBV\nG79.29+0.46 powered two concentric infrared rings which may interact with the\ninfrared dark cloud (IRDC) G79.3+0.3. The Effelsberg 100m telescope was used to\nobserve the NH_3 (1,1), (2,2) emission surrounding G79.29+0.46 and the IRDC. In\naddition, we observed particular positions in the (3,3) transition toward the\nstrongest region of the IRDC. We report here the first coherent shell-like\nstructure of dense NH_3 gas associated with an evolved massive star. The shell,\ntwo or three orders of magnitude more tenuous than the IRDC, is well traced in\nboth ammonia lines, and surrounds the ionized nebula. The NH_3 emission in the\nIRDC is characterized by a low and uniform rotational temperature (T_rot ~ 10\nK) and moderately high opacities in the (1,1) line. The rest of the observed\nfield is spotted by warm or hot zones (T_rot > 30 K) and characterized by\noptically thin emission of the (1,1) line. The NH_3 abundances are about\n10^{-8} in the IRDC, and 10^{-10}-10^{-9} elsewhere. The warm temperatures and\nlow abundances of NH_3 in the shell suggest that the gas is being heated and\nphoto-dissociated by the intense UV field of the LBV star. An outstanding\nregion is found to the south-west (SW) of the LBV star within the IRDC. The\nNH_3 (3,3) emission at the centre of the SW region reveals two velocity\ncomponents tracing gas at temperatures > 30K. The northern edge of the SW\nregion agrees with the border of the ring nebula and a region of continuum\nenhancement; here, the opacity of the (1,1) line and the NH_3 abundance do not\ndecrease as expected in a typical clump of an isolated cold dark cloud. This\nstrongly suggests some kind of interaction between the ring nebula and the\nIRDC.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 13 figures, accepted by A&A.

Our main results are: (a) The fractional rms in the\n0.125-256 Hz range in different spectral states shows complex behavior that\ndepends on the energy range considered. It reaches its maximum not in the hard\nstate, but in the soft state in the Comptonized tail above 10 keV. (b) The\nshape of power spectra in hard and intermediate states and the normalization in\nthe soft state are strongly energy dependent in the 2.1-15 keV range. This\nemphasizes the need for an energy-dependent treatment of power spectra and a\ncareful consideration of energy- and mass-scaling when comparing the\nvariability of different source types, e.g., black hole binaries and AGN. PSDs\nduring extremely hard and extremely soft states can be easily confused for\nenergies above ~5 keV in the 0.125-256 Hz range. (c) The coherence between\nenergy bands drops during transitions from the intermediate into the soft state\nbut recovers in the soft state. (d) The time lag spectra in soft and\nintermediate states show distinct features at frequencies related to the\nfrequencies of the main variability components seen in the power spectra and\nshow the same shift to higher frequencies as the source softens. [...abridged]\nIn particular, we discuss how the timing properties of Cyg X-1 can be used to\nassess the evolution of variability with spectral shape in other black hole\nbinaries.

We aim to analyse the atomic and molecular components of N107, as well\nas its radio continuum emission.

From the observations of the HI (I-GALFA) and 13CO (GRS) lines we\nderive the bubble's kinematical distance and masses of the atomic and molecular\ncomponents. With the algorithm DENDROFIND, we decompose molecular material into\nindividual clumps. From the continuum observations at 1420 MHz (VGPS) and 327\nMHz (WSRT), we derive the radio flux density and the spectral index. With the\nnumerical code ring, we simulate the evolution of stellar-blown bubbles similar\nto N107.\n  Results. The total HI mass associated with N107 is 5.4E3 Msun. The total mass\nof the molecular component (a mixture of cold gasses of H2, CO, He and heavier\nelements) is 1.3E5 Msun, from which 4.0E4 Msun is found along the bubble\nborder. We identified 49 molecular clumps distributed along the bubble border,\nwith the slope of the clump mass function of -1.1. The spectral index of -0.30\nof a strong radio source located apparently within the bubble indicates\nnonthermal emission, hence part of the flux likely originates in a supernova\nremnant, not yet catalogued. The numerical simulations suggest N107 is likely\nless than 2.25 Myr old. Since first supernovae explode only after 3 Myr or\nlater, no supernova remnant should be present within the bubble.

We investigate the different manifestations of AGN feedback in the\nevolved, powerful radio source 3C293 and their impact on the molecular gas of\nits host galaxy, which harbors young star-forming regions and fast outflows of\nHI and ionized gas. Methods. We study the distribution and kinematics of the\nmolecular gas of 3C293 using high spatial resolution observations of the\nCO(1-0) and CO(2-1) lines, and the 3 and 1mm continuum taken with the IRAM\nPdBI. We mapped the molecular gas of 3C293 and compared it with the dust and\nstar-formation images of the host. We searched for signatures of outflow\nmotions in the CO kinematics, and reexamined the evidence of outflowing gas in\nthe HI spectra. We also derived the star formation rate (SFR) and efficiency\n(SFE) of the host with all available SFR tracers from the literature, and\ncompared them with the SFE of young and evolved radio galaxies and normal\nstar-forming galaxies. Results. The CO(1-0) emission line shows that the\nmolecular gas in 3C293 is distributed along a massive (2.2E10 Msun) warped disk\nwith diameter of 21 kpc that rotates around the AGN. Our data show that the\ndust and the star formation are clearly associated with the CO disk. The\nCO(2-1) emission is located in the inner 7 kpc (diameter) region around the\nAGN, coincident with the inner part of the CO(1-0) disk. Both the CO(1-0) and\nCO(2-1) spectra reveal the presence of an absorber against the central regions\nof 3C293 that is associated with the disk. We do not detect any fast (>500\nkm/s) outflow motions in the cold molecular gas. The host of 3C293 shows an SFE\nconsistent with the Kennicutt-Schmidt law. The apparently low SFE of evolved\nradio galaxies may be caused by an underestimation of the SFR and/or an\noverestimation of the molecular gas densities in these sources.

Integrated intensity\nratios between these line are compared with similar observations from the\nliterature towards active galaxies including starburst galaxies (SB), active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN), luminous infrared galaxies (LIRG), and GMCs in M33. A\nsignificantly high ratio of CCH with respect to HCN, HCO+, and HNC is found\ntowards CIG 638 when compared with all other galaxies where these species have\nbeen detected. This points to either an overabundance of CCH or to a relative\nlack of dense molecular gas as supported by the low HCN/CO ratio, or both. The\ndata suggest that the CIG 638 is naturally a less perturbed galaxy where a\nlower fraction of dense molecular gas, as well as a more even distribution\ncould explain the measured ratios. In this scenario the dense gas tracers would\nbe naturally dimmer, while the UV enhanced CCH, would be overproduced in a less\nshielded medium.\n","Comment: Letter accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

In this sense, the behaviour of an ISCO\naround a rotating oblate neutron star is formed by the interplay between\nrelativistic and Newtonian effects. Here we briefly explore the consequences of\nthis interplay using a straightforward analytic approach as well as numerical\nmodels that involve modern NS equations of state. We examine the ratio K\nbetween the ISCO radius and the radius of the neutron star. We find that, with\ngrowing NS spin, the ratio K first decreases, but then starts to increase. This\nnon-monotonic behaviour of K can give rise to a neutron star spin interval in\nwhich ISCO appears for two very different ranges of NS mass. This may strongly\naffect the distribution of neutron stars that have an ISCO (ISCO-NS). When\n(all) neutron stars are distributed around a high mass M0, the ISCO-NS spin\ndistribution is roughly the same as the spin distribution corresponding to all\nneutron stars. In contrast, if M0 is low, the ISCO-NS distribution can only\nhave a peak around a high value of spin. Finally, an intermediate value of M0\ncan imply an ISCO-NS distribution divided into two distinct groups of slow and\nfast rotators. Our findings have immediate astrophysical applications.

Thanks to the heroic observational campaigns carried out in recent\nyears we now have large samples of metal-poor stars for which measurements of\ndetailed abundances exist.

We aim to explain the scatter in Sr, Ba, Y, and Eu abundance\nratio diagrams unveiled by the metal-poor halo stars. Methods. We computed\ninhomogeneous chemical evolution models for the Galactic halo assuming\ndifferent scenarios for the r-process site: the electron-capture supernovae\n(EC) and the magnetorotationally driven (MRD) supernovae scenario. We also\nconsidered models with and without the contribution of fast-rotating massive\nstars (spinstars) to an early enrichment by the s-process. A detailed\ncomparison with the now large sample of stars with measured abundances of Sr,\nBa, Y, Eu, and Fe is provided (both in terms of scatter plots and number\ndistributions for several abundance ratios). Results. The scatter observed in\nthese abundance ratios of the very metal-poor stars (with [Fe/H] < -2.5) can be\nexplained by combining the s-process production in spinstars, and the r-process\ncontribution coming from massive stars. For the r-process we have developed\nmodels for both the EC and the MRD scenario that match the observations.\nConclusions. With the present observational and theoretical constraints we\ncannot distinguish between the EC and the MRD scenario in the Galactic halo.\nIndependently of the r-process scenarios adopted, the production of elements by\nan s-process in spinstars is needed to reproduce the spread in abundances of\nthe light neutron capture elements (Sr and Y) over heavy neutron capture\nelements (Ba and Eu).

Such hypothesis can, for\nexample, be a decision boundary in classification, a set of centroids in\nclustering, or a set of frequent item-sets in association rule mining.\nDepending on the hypothesis space and how the final hypothesis is selected, we\nshow that a learning process can be assigned a numeric score, called learning\ncapacity, which is analogous to Shannon's channel capacity and satisfies\nsimilar interesting properties as well such as the data-processing inequality\nand the information-cannot-hurt inequality. In addition, learning capacity\nprovides the tightest possible bound on the difference between true risk and\nempirical risk of the learning process for all loss functions that are\nparametrized by the chosen hypothesis. It is also shown that the notion of\nlearning capacity equivalently quantifies how sensitive the choice of the final\nhypothesis is to a small perturbation in the training set. Consequently,\nalgorithmic stability is both necessary and sufficient for generalization.\nWhile the theory does not rely on concentration inequalities, we finally show\nthat analogs to classical results in learning theory using the Probably\nApproximately Correct (PAC) model can be immediately deduced using this theory,\nand conclude with information-theoretic bounds to learning capacity.\n"]}]

Coupled with environmental fluctuations in\ndemographic rates, Allee effects can have subtle effects on population\npersistence and extinction. To understand the interplay between these\ndeterministic and stochastic forces, we analyze discrete-time single species\nmodels allowing for general forms of density-dependent feedbacks and stochastic\nfluctuations in demographic rates. Our analysis provide criteria for stochastic\npersistence, asymptotic extinction, and conditional persistence. Stochastic\npersistence requires that the geometric mean of fitness at low densities is\ngreater than one. When this geometric mean is less than one, asymptotic\nextinction occurs with a high probability whenever the initial population\ndensity is low. If in addition the population only experiences positive\ndensity-dependent feedbacks, conditional persistence occurs provided the\ngeometric mean of fitness at high population densities is greater than one.\nHowever, if the population experiences both positive and negative\ndensity-dependent feedbacks, conditional persistence is only possible if\nfluctuations in demographic rates are sufficiently small. Applying our results\nto stochastic models of mate-limitation, we illustrate counter-intuitively that\nthe environmental fluctuations can increase the probability of persistence when\npopulations are initially at low densities, and decrease the likelihood of\npersistence when populations are initially at high densities. Alternatively,\nfor stochastic models accounting for predator saturation and negative\ndensity-dependence, environmental stochasticity can result in asymptotic\nextinction at intermediate predation rates despite conditional persistence\noccurring at higher predation rates.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 3 figures"]}]

We first prove a new upper bound that achieves a\nnear-optimal speed-up of $(D^2/n +D) \\cdot 2^{O(\\ell)}$ for $\\chi({\\cal A})\n\\leq 3 \\log \\log D + O(1)$. In particular, for $\\ell \\in O(1)$, the speed-up is\nasymptotically optimal. By comparison, the existing results for this problem\n[Feinerman et al.] that achieve similar speed-up require $\\chi({\\cal A}) =\n\\Omega(\\log D)$. We then show that this threshold is tight by describing a\nlower bound showing that if $\\chi({\\cal A}) < \\log \\log D - \\omega(1)$, then\nwith high probability the target is not found within $D^{2-o(1)}$ moves per\nagent. Hence, there is a sizable gap to the straightforward $\\Omega(D^2/n + D)$\nlower bound in this setting.\n","Comment: appears in PODC 2014"]}]
