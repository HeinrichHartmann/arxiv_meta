As a result, the conductivity of the ribbon increases and can\nbe almost an order of magnitude larger that of the intrinsic unbiased material\n- a change that can be induced with a strain of only ~2-3%. The conductivity is\nproportional to the applied strain and the magnitude of the effect is tunable\nwith the bias field. Such layer-asymmetric strains can be achieved by bending,\nwith forces on the order of ~1nN resulting in a layer-asymmetric strain of ~1%.\nThis new electromechanical effect has a wide potential for application in the\nareas of nano-force microscopy and pressure sensing on the atomic scale.\n","Comment: Updated to journal version with new title and revised figures. 8\n  pages, 6 figures"]}]

The cooling luminosity around merger\nis only marginally smaller than that of a single, non-spinning black hole.\nIncipient jets are launched independently of the mass ratio, while the same\ninitial disk accreting on a single non-spinning black hole does not lead to a\njet, as expected. For all mass ratios we see a transient behavior in the\ncollimated, magnetized outflows lasting $2-5 ( M/10^8M_\\odot ) \\rm days$ after\nmerger: the outflows become increasingly magnetically dominated and accelerated\nto higher velocities, boosting the Poynting luminosity. These sudden changes\ncan alter the electromagnetic emission across the jet and potentially help\ndistinguish mergers of black holes in AGNs from single accreting black holes\nbased on jet morphology alone.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 6 figures, matches published version"]}]

We first focused on the semantics to see how Astell\nbuilds her vindication of the female sex, which words she uses to sensitise\nwomen to their alienated condition and promote their education. Then we studied\nthe morphology of the lexemes (which is different from contemporary English)\nused by the author, thanks to the NooJ tools we have devised for this purpose.\nNooJ has great functionalities for lexicographic work. Its commands and graphs\nprove to be most efficient in the spotting of archaic words or variants in\nspelling. Introduction In our previous articles, we have studied the\nsingularities of 17 th century English within the framework of a diachronic\nanalysis thanks to syntactical and morphological graphs and thanks to the\ndictionaries we have compiled from a corpus that may be expanded overtime. Our\nearly work was based on a limited corpus of English travel literature to Greece\nin the 17 th century. This article deals with a late seventeenth century text\nwritten by a woman philosopher and essayist, Mary Astell (1666--1731),\nconsidered as one of the first English feminists. Astell wrote her essay at a\ntime in English history when women were \"the weaker vessel\" and their main\nbusiness in life was to charm and please men by their looks and submissiveness.\nIn this essay we will see how NooJ can help us analyse Astell's rhetoric (what\npoint of view does she adopt, does she speak in her own name, in the name of\nall women, what is her representation of men and women and their relationships\nin the text, what are the goals of education?). Then we will turn our attention\nto the morphology of words in the text and use NooJ commands and graphs to\ncarry out a lexicographic inquiry into Astell's lexemes.\n","Comment: Zoe Gavriilidou, Elina Chadjipapa, Lena Papadopoulou, Max\n  Silberztein.

Moreover - and this is the combinatorial aspect - it is enough to know only\nthe signs of the entries, the actual values do not matter.

Both AGN components\n(direct and reprocessed) and like Star Formation (SF) are needed to model its\nSED. From the SED and their UV-optical spectra we have estimated the mass of\nthe black hole ($M_{BH} = 10^9 - 10^{10} M_{SUN}$) and bolometric luminosities\nof AGN ($L_{BOL} = (0.8-20) \\times 10^{13} L_{SUN}$). These objects show very\nhigh luminosities in the far infrared range (at the H/ULIRG levels) and very\nhigh rates of SF (SFR = 400-1400 $M_{SUN}$/y). Known their current SFR and\ntheir BH masses, we deduce that their host galaxies must be already very\nmassive, or would not have time to get to the local relation between BH mass\nand bulge. Finally, we found evidence of a possible correlation between the\ncolumn density of ionized gas detected in X-rays ($NH_{ion}$) and SFR, which\nwould provide a link between AGN and SF processes.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 6 figures, SEA 2014 proceedings"]}]

The discrete pressure is defined on the primal\ntriangular grid and the discrete velocity field is defined on an edge-based\nstaggered dual grid. While staggered meshes are state of the art in classical\nfinite difference approximations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations,\ntheir use in the context of high order DG schemes is novel and still quite\nrare. Formal substitution of the discrete momentum equation into the discrete\ncontinuity equation yields a sparse four-point block system for the scalar\npressure, which is conveniently solved with a matrix-free GMRES algorithm.

The\nproposed relation is tested using two different non-Gaussian distributions,\nnamely $q$-Gaussian and Levy distributions.

On the other hand, if the second moment of the\ndistribution is infinite, then the kurtosis seems to never converge to a single\nvalue. The converged kurtosis value for the finite second moment distributions\nand the number of data points needed to reach this value depend on the\ndeviation of the original distribution from the Gaussian case. We also argue\nthat the use of kurtosis to compare distributions to decide which one deviates\nfrom the Gaussian more can lead to incorrect results even for finite second\nmoment distributions for small data sets, whereas it is totally misleading for\ninfinite second moment distributions where the difference depends on $N$ for\nall finite $N$.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 8 figures"]}]

For this to occur, homologous genes need to\nfind and recognize each other. However, despite its central role in homologous\nrecombination, the mechanism of homology recognition is still an unsolved\npuzzle. While specific proteins are known to play a role at later stages of\nrecombination, an initial coarse grained recognition step has been proposed.\nThis relies on the sequence dependence of the DNA structural parameters, such\nas twist and rise, mediated by intermolecular interactions, in particular\nelectrostatic ones. In this proposed mechanism, sequences having the same base\npair text, or are homologous, have lower interaction energy than those\nsequences with uncorrelated base pair texts; the difference termed the\nrecognition energy. Here, we probe how the recognition energy changes when one\nDNA fragment slides past another, and consider, for the first time, homologous\nsequences in antiparallel alignment. This dependence on sliding was termed the\nrecognition well. We find that there is recognition well for anti-parallel,\nhomologous DNA tracts, but only a very shallow one, so that their interaction\nwill differ little from the interaction between two nonhomologous tracts. This\nfact may be utilized in single molecule experiments specially targeted to test\nthe theory. As well as this, we test previous theoretical approximations in\ncalculating the recognition well for parallel molecules against MC simulations,\nand consider more rigorously the optimization of the orientations of the\nfragments about their long axes. The more rigorous treatment affects the\nrecognition energy a little, when the molecules are considered rigid.

They provide answers to scientific needs in\nthe fields of conservation, preservation, restoration and mediation of\narchitectural, archaeological and cultural heritage [2] [6] [7] [9].\nPhotogrammetry on ceramic fragments was one of the first applications\ncontemporary of the development of this technique applied in the archaeological\ncommunity [3]. More recently and due to its democratization, it was applied\nmore generally to artifacts [5]. Finally joined today by the rise of 3D\nprinting [8] [10], it can restore fragmented artifacts [1] [12]. These examples\ntarget one or several particular objects and use different types of equipment\nthat can be expensive. These aspects can put off uninitiated archaeologists. So\nit would be appropriate to see if these techniques could be generalized to a\nwhole class of geometrically simple and common artifacts, such as ceramics.\nFrom these observations, associated to ceramics specialists with fragments of\nbroken ceramics, we aimed at arranging different tools and methods, including\nphotogrammetry, to explore opportunities for a cheap and attainable\nreconstruction methodology and its possible applications. Our first objective\nwas to establish a protocol for scanning fragments with photogrammetry, and for\nreconstruction of original ceramics. We used the digital reconstitutions of the\nceramics we got following our process to calculate some metrics and to design\nand 3D print a display for the remaining fragments of one pottery.\n","Comment: International Conference on Culturage Heritage, EuroMed, 2014, Nov\n  2014, Lemessos, Cyprus"]}]

Such codes\ncan take as input a high number of uncertain parameters and it is important to\nidentify their influences via a global sensitivity analysis (GSA). However,\nthese codes can be time consuming which prevents a GSA based on the classical\nSobol' indices, requiring too many simulations. This is especially true as the\nnumber of inputs is important. To address this limitation, we consider recent\nadvances in dependence measures, focusing on the distance correlation and the\nHilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). Our objective is to study these\nindices and use them for a screening purpose. Numerical tests reveal some\ndifferences between dependence measures and classical Sobol' indices, and\npreliminary answers to \"What sensitivity indices to what situation?\" are\nderived. Then, two approaches are proposed to use the dependence measures for a\nscreening purpose. The first one directly uses these indices with independence\ntests; asymptotic tests and their spectral extensions exist and are detailed.\nFor a higher accuracy in presence of small samples, we propose a non-asymptotic\nversion based on bootstrap sampling. The second approach is based on a linear\nmodel associating two simulations, which explains their output difference as a\nweighed sum of their input differences. From this, a bootstrap method is\nproposed for the selection of the influential inputs. We also propose a\nheuristic approach for the calibration of the HSIC Lasso method. Numerical\nexperiments are performed and show the potential of these approaches for\nscreening when many inputs are not influential.\n"]}]
