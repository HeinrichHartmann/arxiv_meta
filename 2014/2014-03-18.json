We show that both electronic and thermal transport\nproperties converge fast toward the bulk limit with increasing length of the\nlattice: only a few repetitions (~6) of the fundamental unit cell are required\nto recover the electronic band gap of the infinite lattice as a transport gap\nfor the finite lattice. We investigate how different antidot shapes and sizes\naffect the thermoelectric properties. The resulting thermoelectric figure of\nmerit, ZT, can exceed 0.25, and it is highly sensitive to the atomic\narrangement of the antidot edges. Specifically, hexagonal holes with pure\nzigzag edges lead to an order-of-magnitude smaller ZT as compared to pure\narmchair edges. We explain this behavior as a consequence of the localization\nof states, which predominantly occurs for zigzag edges, and of an increased\nsplitting of the electronic minibands, which reduces the power factor.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 13 figures.

This paper proposes\nthat the spatial selectivity of higher auditory neurons emerges as a direct\nconsequence of learning efficient codes for natural binaural sounds. Firstly,\nit is demonstrated that a linear efficient coding transform - Independent\nComponent Analysis (ICA) trained on spectrograms of naturalistic simulated\nbinaural sounds extracts spatial information present in the signal. A simple\nhierarchical ICA extension allowing for decoding of sound position is proposed.\nFurthermore, it is shown that units revealing spatial selectivity can be\nlearned from a binaural recording of a natural auditory scene. In both cases a\nrelatively small subpopulation of learned spectrogram features suffices to\nperform accurate sound localization. Representation of the auditory space is\ntherefore learned in a purely unsupervised way by maximizing the coding\nefficiency and without any task-specific constraints.

In this work we study the statistics of current\nfluctuations in nonequilibrium diffusive systems, using macroscopic fluctuation\ntheory as theoretical framework, and advanced Monte Carlo simulations of\nseveral stochastic lattice gases as a laboratory to test the emerging picture.\nOur quest will bring us from (1) the confirmation of an additivity conjecture\nin one and two dimensions, which considerably simplifies the MFT complex\nvariational problem to compute the thermodynamics of currents, to (2) the\ndiscovery of novel isometric fluctuation relations, which opens an unexplored\nroute toward a deeper understanding of nonequilibrium physics by bringing\nsymmetry principles to the realm of fluctuations, and to (3) the observation of\ncoherent structures in fluctuations, which appear via dynamic phase transitions\ninvolving a spontaneous symmetry breaking event at the fluctuating level.

While previous work focused\nparticularly on sampling schemes used to estimate certain graph properties\n(e.g. triangle count), much less is known for the case when we need to estimate\nvarious graph properties with the same sampling scheme. In this paper, we\npropose a generic stream sampling framework for big-graph analytics, called\nGraph Sample and Hold (gSH). To begin, the proposed framework samples from\nmassive graphs sequentially in a single pass, one edge at a time, while\nmaintaining a small state. We then show how to produce unbiased estimators for\nvarious graph properties from the sample. Given that the graph analysis\nalgorithms will run on a sample instead of the whole population, the runtime\ncomplexity of these algorithm is kept under control. Moreover, given that the\nestimators of graph properties are unbiased, the approximation error is kept\nunder control. Finally, we show the performance of the proposed framework (gSH)\non various types of graphs, such as social graphs, among others.\n"]}]

The principle of this method is to\nuse a functional basis with elements that already include these fine structure\nso as to avoid these extra costs.

Since measurements are made over an irregularly\nsampled Fourier plane, synthesising an intensity image from interferometric\nmeasurements requires substantial processing. Furthermore there are distortions\nthat have to be corrected. In this thesis, a new high-performance image\nsynthesis tool (imaging tool) for radio interferometry is developed.\nImplemented in C++ and CUDA, the imaging tool achieves unprecedented\nperformance by means of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The imaging tool is\ndivided into several components, and the back-end handling numerical\ncalculations is generalised in a new framework. A new feature termed\ncompression arbitrarily increases the performance of an already highly\nefficient GPU-based implementation of the w-projection algorithm. Compression\ntakes advantage of the behaviour of oversampled convolution functions and the\nbaseline trajectories. A CPU-based component prepares data for the GPU which is\nmulti-threaded to ensure maximum use of modern multi-core CPUs. Best\nperformance can only be achieved if all hardware components in a system do work\nin parallel. The imaging tool is designed such that disk I/O and work on CPU\nand GPUs is done concurrently. Test cases show that the imaging tool performs\nnearly 100$\\times$ faster than another general CPU-based imaging tool.\nUnfortunately, the tool is limited in use since deconvolution and A-projection\nare not yet supported. It is also limited by GPU memory. Future work will\nimplement deconvolution and A-projection, whilst finding ways of overcoming the\nmemory limitation.\n","Comment: This is a Masters Thesis read at the University of Malta"]}]

After background subtraction, keypoints\non the contour of the foreground blobs are detected using DCE (Discrete Curve\nEvolution)technique. These keypoints are then described by the local shape at\neach point of the obtained polygon. The keypoints are matched based on the\nconvexity of polygon's vertices and Euclidean distance between them. Only good\nmatches for each local shape polygon in a frame, are kept. To achieve a global\naffine transformation that maximises the overlapping of infrared and visible\nforeground pixels, the matched keypoints of each local shape polygon are stored\ntemporally in a buffer for a few number of frames.

Any solution of this system supplies us a solution for the\nintegrability solution of Knizhnic-Zamolodchikov equation. We shall approach\nthis equation by introducing a new class of bialgebras, which we call Long\nbialgebras. A FRT type theorem is given: in the finite case any solution of the\nabove equation is a co-homotety where the vector spase is a comodule over a\nLong bialgebra.\n","Comment: 16 pg. Latex2e"]}]
