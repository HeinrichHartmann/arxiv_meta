From the solution of the system we found the\nevolution of the Keplerian orbital elements in the special case when the\norbital elements are determined with respect to a plane perpendicular to the\ngas flow velocity vector. Transformation of the Keplerian orbital elements\ndetermined for this special case into orbital elements determined with respect\nto an arbitrary oriented plane is presented. The orbital elements of the dust\nparticle change periodically with a constant oscillation period or remain\nconstant. Planar, perpendicular and stationary solutions are discussed.\n  The applicability of this solution in the Solar system is also investigated.\nWe consider icy particles with radii from 1 to 10 micrometers. The presented\nsolution is valid for these particles in orbits with semi-major axes from 200\nto 3000 AU and eccentricities smaller than 0.8, approximately. The oscillation\nperiods for these orbits range from 10^5 to 2 x 10^6 years, approximately.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 3 figures; Accepted for publication in Celestial Mechanics\n  and Dynamical Astronomy"]}]

In this paper, we propose using the Bayesian\nLASSO (BLASSO) and the non-negative Bayesian LASSO (nBLASSO) to analyse the\ninteractions between miRNA and mRNA using expression data. The proposed\nBayesian methods explore the posterior distributions for those parameters\nrequired to model the miRNA-mRNA interactions.

The complexity\nof the problem gets shifted into the choice of the number and shape of the\ninitial wavefunctions that should only be specified at the beginning of the\ncomputation (we stress that these wavefunctions have nothing to do with quantum\nnature of the actual dark matter particles). We discuss different prescriptions\nto generate the initial wave functions from the initial conditions and\ndemonstrate the validity of the technique on two simple test cases. This new\nsimulation algorithm can in principle be used on an arbitrary distribution\nfunction, enabling the simulation of warm and hot dark matter structure\nformation scenarios.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 9 figures.

Here we report systematic high\nresolution angle-resolved photoemission measurements that have provided direct\nevidence on the existence of strongly anisotropic Dirac cones in SrMnBi2 and\nCaMnBi2. Distinct behaviors of the Dirac cones between SrMnBi2 and CaMnBi2 are\nalso observed.

Given that the bare fine structure constant in graphene is of order\nunity, which is neither small to justify a perturbative expansion nor large\nenough for strong-coupling theories to be applicable, the problem is a\ndifficult one, with some similarity to 2+1-dimensional strong-coupling quantum\nelectrodynamics (QED). In this work, we take a systematic and comprehensive\nanalytical approach, working primarily at the Dirac point (intrinsic graphene),\nby going up to three loops in the diagrammatic expansion to both ascertain the\nvalidity of perturbation theory and to estimate quantitatively higher-order\nrenormalization effects. While no direct signatures for non-Fermi liquid\nbehavior at the Dirac point have yet been observed experimentally, there is\nample evidence for the interaction-induced renormalization of the graphene\nvelocity as the carrier density approaches zero. We provide a critical\ncomparison between theory and experiment, using both bare- and\nscreened-interaction (RPA) calculations. We find that while the one-loop RG\nanalysis gives reasonable agreement with the experimental data, especially when\nscreening and finite-density effects are included through the RPA, the two-loop\nanalysis reveals a strong-coupling critical point in suspended graphene,\nsignifying either a quantum phase transition or a breakdown of the\nweak-coupling RG approach. We show that the latter is more likely by adapting\nDyson's argument for the breakdown of perturbative QED to the case of graphene.\nWe propose future experiments and theoretical directions to make further\nprogress on this important and difficult problem.\n","Comment: 60 pages, 28 figures, PRB version"]}]

Since the introduction of prime event structures, many variants of\nevent structures have been proposed with different behavioural relations and,\nhence, with differences in their expressive power. One of the possible benefits\nof using a more expressive event structure is that of having a more compact\nrepresentation for the same behaviour when considering the number of events\nused in a prime event structure. Therefore, this article addresses the problem\nof reducing the size of an event structure while preserving behaviour under a\nwell-known notion of equivalence, namely history preserving bisimulation. In\nparticular, we investigate this problem on two generalisations of the prime\nevent structures.

More specifically, we\ndescribe the conditions under which a set of events in an event structure can\nbe folded into a single event while preserving the original behaviour. The\nsuccessive application of this folding operation leads to a minimal size event\nstructure. However, the order on which the folding operation is applied may\nlead to different minimal size event structures.

Inspecting images in a running difference approach,\nwe find that the seemingly diffuse, quasi-static cusp-shaped structure consists\nof multiple nested loops that repeatedly rise upward and disappear approaching\nthe cusp edge. Over the gradual phase, we detect numerous episodes of loop\nrising, each lasting minutes. A differential emission measure analysis reveals\nthat the temperature is highest at the top of the arcade and becomes cooler at\nhigher altitudes within the cusp-shaped structure, contrary to typical\nlong-duration flares. With a nonlinear force-free model, our analysis shows\nthat the event mainly involves two adjacent sheared arcades separated by a\nT-type hyperbolic flux tube (HFT). One of the arcades harbors a magnetic flux\nrope, which is identified with a filament that survives the flare owing to the\nstrong confining field. We conclude that a new emergence of magnetic flux in\nthe other arcade triggers the flare, while the preexisting HFT and flux rope\ndictate the structure and dynamics of the flare loops and ribbons during the\nlong-lasting decay phase, and that a quasi-separatrix layer high above the HFT\ncould account for the cusp-shaped structure.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

For such a cognitive network, there are two important and limited\nresources that should be distributed in a comprehensive manner, namely feedback\nbits and time duration. First, regarding the feedback bits, there are two\ncomponents: sensing component (used to convey various users' sensing results)\nand accessing component (used to feedback channel state information). A large\nsensing component can support more users to perform cooperative sensing, which\nresults in high sensing precision. However, a large accessing component is\npreferred as well, as it has a direct impact on the performance in the\nmultiuser cognitive network when multi-antenna technique, such as zero-forcing\nbeamforming (ZFBF), is utilized. Second, the tradeoff of sensing and accessing\nduration in a transmission interval needs to be determined, so that the sum\ntransmission rate is optimized while satisfying the interference constraint. In\naddition, the above two resources are interrelated and inversive under some\nconditions. Specifically, sensing time can be saved by utilizing more sensing\nfeedback bits for a given performance objective. Hence, the resources should be\nallocation in a jointly manner. Based on the joint optimization framework and\nthe intrinsic relationship between the two resources, we propose two joint\nresource allocation schemes by maximizing the average sum transmission rate in\na multiuser multi-antenna cognitive network.
