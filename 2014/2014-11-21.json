We consider a model where a phase of inflation is preceded by a\ncosmic bounce. While we consider in this paper only that the bounce is due to\nloop quantum gravity, most of the results presented here can be applied for\ndifferent bouncing cosmologies. We concentrate on the scenario where the scalar\nfield, as the result of contraction of the universe, is driven from the bottom\nof the potential well. The field is amplified, and finally the phase of the\nstandard slow-roll inflation is realized. Such an evolution modifies the\nstandard inflationary spectrum of perturbations by the additional oscillations\nand damping on the large scales. We extract the parameters of the model from\nthe observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation. In particular,\nthe value of inflaton mass is equal to $m=(2.6 \\pm 0.6) \\cdot 10^{13}$ GeV. In\nour considerations we base on the seven years of observations made by the WMAP\nsatellite.

After all, non-commutative geometry does not purport yet to\nsolve the riddle of quantum gravity; it is more of an insurance policy against\nthe probable failure of the other approaches. The plan is as follows: the\nintroduction invites students to the fruitful doubts and conundrums besetting\nthe application of even classical gravity. Next, the first experiments\ndetecting quantum gravitational states inoculate us a healthy dose of\nskepticism on some of the current ideologies. In Section 3 we look at the\naction for general relativity as a consequence of gauge theory for quantum\ntensor fields. Section 4 briefly deals with the unimodular variants. Section 5\narrives at non-commutative geometry. I am convinced that, if this is to play a\nrole in quantum gravity, commutative and non-commutative manifolds must be\ntreated on the same footing; which justifies the place granted to the\nreconstruction theorem. Together with Section 3, this part constitutes the main\nbody of the notes. Only very summarily at the end of this section we point to\nsome approaches to gravity within the non-commutative realm.

Our argument is based on the recent entropic\nreinterpretation of Newton's laws of motion. We propose a duality between cold\ndark matter and modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). We introduce the concept of\nMONDian dark matter, and discuss some of its phenomenological implications. At\ncluster as well as cosmological scales, the MONDian dark matter would behave as\ncold dark matter, but at the galactic scale, the MONDian dark matter would act\nas MOND.\n","Comment: 5 pages, v3: version to appear in PLB with the title changed and more\n  discussions"]}]

These theories can be\nformulated as integrable deformations of gauged WZW models. In this work we\nconsider the class of symmetric spaces CP^{n+1} and solve the corresponding\ngeneralized sine-Gordon theories at the quantum level by finding the exact\nspectrum of topological solitons, or kinks, and their S-matrix. The latter\ninvolves a trignometric solution of the Yang-Baxer equation which exhibits a\nquantum group symmetry with a tower of states that is bounded, unlike for\nmagnons, as a result of the quantum group deformation parameter q being a root\nof unity. We test the S-matrix by taking the semi-classical limit and comparing\nwith the time delays for the scattering of classical solitons. We argue that\nthe internal CP^{n-1} moduli space of collective coordinates of the solitons in\nthe classical theory can be interpreted as a q-deformed fuzzy space in the\nquantum theory. We analyse the n=1 case separately and provide a further test\nof the S-matrix conjecture in this case by calculating the central charge of\nthe UV CFT using the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz.\n","Comment: 33 pages, important correction to S-matrix to ensure crossing\n  symmetry"]}]

The equations split into two uncoupled systems,\none for the sum, the other for the difference, of the fluctuations in the two\nsectors. The former is governed strictly by Newtonian dynamics. The latter is\ngoverned by MOND dynamics, which entails stronger gravity, and nonlinearity\neven for the smallest of perturbations. These cause the difference to grow\nfaster than the sum, conducing to matter-twin-matter segregation. The\nnonlinearity also causes interaction between nested perturbations on different\nscales. Because matter and twin matter (TM) repel each other in the MOND\nregime, matter inhomogeneities grow not only by their own self gravity, but\nalso through shepherding by flanking TM overdensitie. The relative importance\nof gravity and pressure in the MOND system depends also on the strength of the\nperturbation. The development of structure in the universe, in either sector,\nthus depends crucially on two initial fluctuation spectra: that of matter alone\nand that of the matter-TM difference.

In the vacuum DLH model, we find a periodic solution expressible\nin terms of elliptic integrals. Mapping the vacuum solution over to Taub-NUT\ncoordinates, recovers the standard (non-periodic) Taub-NUT solution in the Taub\nregion, where Taub-NUT time takes positive values, but does not exhibit the two\nNUT regions known in the standard Taub-NUT solution. Conversely, mapping the\ncomplete Taub-NUT solution to the DLH case reveals that the NUT regions\ncorrespond to imaginary time and space in DLH coordinates. We show that many of\nthe well-known `pathologies' of the Taub-NUT solution arise because the\ntraditional coordinates are connected by a multivalued transformation to the\nphysically more meaningful DLH coordinates.

For J1206, we find a steeply rising continuum and significant\n[S IV] emission, suggesting that a moderately hard radiation field is powering\ncontinuum emission from small dust grains. The strength of the [S IV] emission\nalso implies a sub-solar metallicity of ~ 0.5 Z_{Sun}, confirming published\nrest-frame optical measurements. In J0901, the PAH lines have large rest-frame\nequivalent widths (> 1 micron) and the continuum rises slowly with wavelength,\nsuggesting that any AGN contribution to L_{IR} is insignificant, in contrast to\nthe implications of optical emission-line diagnostics. Using [O III] line flux\nas a proxy for AGN strength, we estimate that the AGN in J0901 provides only a\nsmall fraction of its mid-infrared continuum flux. By combining the detection\nof [Ar II] with an upper limit on [Ar III] emission, we infer a metallicity of\n> 1.3 Z_{Sun}.

Specifically, in\nthe downlink, we implement an IEEE 802.11ac-compliant MU-MIMO transmission\nscheme to allow the AP to simultaneously send frames to a group of STAs. In the\nuplink, we extend the traditional one round channel access contention to two\nrounds, which coordinate multiple STAs to transmit frames to the AP\nsimultaneously. 2-nd round Contention Window (CW2nd), a parameter that makes\nthe length of the 2-nd contention round elastic according to the traffic\ncondition, is introduced. Uni-MUMAC is evaluated through simulations in\nsaturated and non-saturated conditions when both downlink and uplink traffic\nare present in the system. We also propose an analytic saturation model to\nvalidate the simulation results. By properly setting CW2nd and other\nparameters, Uni-MUMAC is compared to a prominent multi-user transmission scheme\nin the literature.
