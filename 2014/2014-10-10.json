Most studies in collective\nanimal behaviour have aimed to understand how a globally ordered state may\nemerge from simple behavioural rules. Less effort has been devoted to\nunderstanding the origin of collective response, namely the way the group as a\nwhole reacts to its environment. Yet collective response is the adaptive key to\nsurvivor, especially when strong predatory pressure is present. Here we argue\nthat collective response in animal groups is achieved through scale-free\nbehavioural correlations.

We found that the range of such spatial correlation does not have a\nconstant value, but it scales with the linear size of the flock. This result\nindicates that behavioural correlations are scale-free: the change in the\nbehavioural state of one animal affects and is affected by that of all other\nanimals in the group, no matter how large the group is. Scale-free correlations\nextend maximally the effective perception range of the individuals, thus\ncompensating for the short-range nature of the direct inter-individual\ninteraction and enhancing global response to perturbations.

The practical passive eavesdropping scenario we\nconsider is where channel state information (CSI) from the eavesdropper is not\navailable at the transmitter.

During this transition,\nthe efficiency of information transport is a key factor to prevent cohesion\nloss and preserve robustness. The precise mechanism by which natural groups\nachieve such efficiency, though, is currently not fully understood. Here, we\npresent an experimental study of starling flocks performing collective turns in\nthe field. We find that the information to change direction propagates across\nthe flock linearly in time with negligible attenuation, hence keeping group\ndecoherence to a minimum. This result contrasts with current theories of\ncollective motion, which predict a slower and dissipative transport of\ndirectional information. We propose a novel theory whose cornerstone is the\nexistence of a conserved spin current generated by the gauge symmetry of the\nsystem. The theory turns out to be mathematically identical to that of\nsuperfluid transport in liquid helium and it explains the dissipationless\npropagating mode observed in turning flocks. Superfluidity also provides a\nquantitative expression for the speed of propagation of the information,\naccording to which transport must be swifter the stronger the group's\norientational order. This prediction is verified by the data. We argue that the\nlink between strong order and efficient decision-making required by\nsuperfluidity may be the adaptive drive for the high degree of behavioural\npolarization observed in many living groups. The mathematical equivalence\nbetween superfluid liquids and turning flocks is a compelling demonstration of\nthe far-reaching consequences of symmetry and conservation laws across\ndifferent natural systems.\n"]}]

Attention to the gauge generator G\nof Rosenfeld, Anderson, Bergmann, Castellani et al., a specially tuned sum of\nfirst-class constraints, facilitates seeing that a solitary first-class\nconstraint in fact generates not a gauge transformation, but a bad physical\nchange in electromagnetism (changing E) or GR. The change spoils the Lagrangian\nconstraints in terms of the physically relevant velocities rather than\nauxiliary canonical momenta. While Maudlin has defended change in GR much as G.\nE. Moore resisted skepticism, there remains a need to exhibit the technical\nflaws in the argument.\n  Insistence on Hamiltonian-Lagrangian equivalence, a theme emphasized by\nMukunda, Castellani, Sugano, Pons, Salisbury, Shepley and Sundermeyer among\nothers, holds the key. Taking objective change to be ineliminable time\ndependence, there is change in vacuum GR just in case there is no time-like\nvector field satisfying Killing's equation. Throwing away the spatial\ndependence of GR for convenience, one finds that the time evolution from\nHamilton's equations is real change just when there is no time-like Killing\nvector. Hence change is real and local even in the Hamiltonian formalism.\n  The considerations here resolve the Earman-Maudlin standoff: the Hamiltonian\nformalism is helpful, and, suitably reformed, it does not have absurd\nconsequences for change. Hence the classical problem of time is resolved, apart\nfrom the issue of observables, for which the solution is outlined. The quantum\nproblem of time, however, is not automatically resolved due to issues of\nquantum constraint imposition.\n","Comment: Accepted by Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics"]}]

The reformulations use the martingale representation\ntheorem.

The\napplication of the simple geometrical model to the Douglas-fir and Scots pine\ndata suggests that the slope of the self-thinning curve will not remain\nconstant during the course of growth and self-thinning of a single forest\nstand. Most probable, at the initial stages of stand growth the slope will be\nless than -3/2 and at old ages of the stand the slope will be higher than -3/2.\nInevitably, a time will come when the slope is exactly equals -3/2. In other\nwords, the slope -3/2 is an obligatory state in the course of self-thinning of\na forest stand. At the very time of -3/2 slope two particular features coincide\nwith it. One is that the total bole surface area remains constant. The length\nof the constancy stage would probably vary with species, initial stand\ndensities, their spatial arrangements, conditions of growth, and other specific\nfactors. Another feature of the time is that a geometric similarity in the\ngrowth of the forest stand takes place, which is not in a contradiction with\nthe -3/2 rule as it had been formulated by its authors. To put it shortly, the\nslope -3/2: i) is a very specific and obligatory state in the process of forest\nstand growth and ii) is not an asymptote but rather a transitional point (span)\nin the time of growth. These two assertions may be called a transitional status\nof the -3/2 rule. The geometric model of a forest stand (Gavrikov, 2014) has\nproved to be rather helpful at analyzing of real forest stand structure and\ndynamics. Despite of its extreme simplicity (it uses cones as representations\nof trees) the model looks like having enough similarity with real even-aged\nforests since the model's predictions are often reasonably close to measured\nvalues of power exponents.\n","Comment: A draft manuscript"]}]

When the branes and\nantibranes are well separated and the brane's spike is far from the antibrane's\nspike, wormhole isn't formed however when two branes are close to each other,\nthey can be connected by a wormhole. In this condition, there exists many\nchannels for flowing energy from extra dimensions into our universe and\ninflation may naturally occur in a warm region. We present a model that allows\nall cosmological parameters like the scale factor $a$, the Hubble parameter $H$\nand universe energy density depend on the shape function and temperature of\nwormhole in transverse dimension between two branes. In our model, the\nexpansion of 4D universe is controlled by the thermal wormhole between branes\nand ends up in Big-Rip singularity.

To combine the\nadvantages of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and\nmultiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) technologies, we consider a MIMO-OFDM\ncognitive radio network where wireless users with multiple antennas communicate\nover several non-interfering frequency bands. As the network's primary users\n(PUs) come and go in the system, the communication environment changes\nconstantly (and, in many cases, randomly).

In this dynamic setting, static solution\nconcepts (such as Nash equilibrium) are no longer relevant, so we focus on\ndynamic transmit policies that lead to no regret: specifically, we consider\npolicies that perform at least as well as (and typically outperform) even the\nbest fixed transmit profile in hindsight. Drawing on the method of matrix\nexponential learning and online mirror descent techniques, we derive a\nno-regret transmit policy for the system's SUs which relies only on local\nchannel state information (CSI). Using this method, the system's SUs are able\nto track their individually evolving optimum transmit profiles remarkably well,\neven under rapidly (and randomly) changing conditions.
