For undulator and bending magnet radiation from a single electron, the\nWD function can be explicitly calculated. In the case of an electron beam with\na finite emittance the brightness is given by the maximum of the convolution of\na single electron WD function and the probability distribution of the electrons\nin phase space. In the particular case when both electron beam size and\nelectron beam divergence dominate over the diffraction size and the diffraction\nangle, one can use a geometrical optics approach. However, there are\nintermediate regimes when only the electron beam size or the electron beam\ndivergence dominate. In this asymptotic cases the geometrical optics approach\nis still applicable, and the brightness definition used here yields back once\nmore the maximum photon flux density in phase space.

A case in point is inflationary cosmology, the\ncurrent paradigm for describing the very early universe, where one is often\ninterested only in the time-dependence of a subsystem. In inflationary\ncosmology it is assumed that a slowly rolling scalar field leads to an\nexponential increase in the size of space. At the end of this phase, the scalar\nfield begins to oscillate and transfers its energy to regular matter. This\ntransfer typically involves a parametric resonance instability. This article\nreviews work which the author has done in collaboration with Walter Craig\nstudying the role which random noise can play in the parametric resonance\ninstability of matter fields in the presence of the oscillatory inflaton field.\nWe find that the particular idealized form of the noise studied here renders\nthe instability more effective. As a corollary, we obtain a new proof of\nAnderson localization.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 3 figures, invited contribution to the Fields Institute\n  workshop \"Hamiltonian PDEs: Analysis, Computations and Applications\", to be\n  published in the proceedings"]}]

In this context heterostructures containing a\ntwo-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) are a key technology. In particular\nGaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures, with a 2DEG at typically 100 nm below the\nsurface, are widely studied. In order to explore electron transport in such\nsystems, low-resistance ohmic contacts are required that connect the 2DEG to\nmacroscopic measurement leads at the surface. Here we report on designing and\nmeasuring a dedicated device for unraveling the various resistance\ncontributions in such contacts, which include pristine 2DEG series resistance,\nthe 2DEG resistance under a contact, the contact resistance itself, and the\ninfluence of pressing a bonding wire onto a contact. We also report here a\nrobust recipe for contacts with very low resistance, with values that do not\nchange significantly for annealing times between 20 and 350 sec, hence\nproviding the flexibility to use this method for materials with different 2DEG\ndepths. The type of heating used for annealing is found to strongly influence\nthe annealing process and hence the quality of the resulting contacts.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables"]}]
