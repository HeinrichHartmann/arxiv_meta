The HAWC observatory will be\nsensitive to diverse searches for dark matter annihilation, including\nannihilation from extended dark matter sources, the diffuse gamma-ray emission\nfrom dark matter annihilation, and gamma-ray emission from non-luminous dark\nmatter subhalos. Here we consider the HAWC sensitivity to a subset of these\nsources, including dwarf galaxies, the M31 galaxy, the Virgo cluster, and the\nGalactic center. We simulate the HAWC response to gamma rays from these sources\nin several well-motivated dark matter annihilation channels. If no gamma-ray\nexcess is observed, we show the limits HAWC can place on the dark matter\ncross-section from these sources. In particular, in the case of dark matter\nannihilation into gauge bosons, HAWC will be able to detect a narrow range of\ndark matter masses to cross-sections below thermal. HAWC should also be\nsensitive to non-thermal cross-sections for masses up to nearly 1000 TeV.

However, there are many\nphysical examples where the dynamics is continuous and only approximately\ndiscrete, or where it is favourable to discuss the dynamics on a discretized\nand a continuous level in parallel. An example is the hindered motion of\nparticles through potential landscapes with barriers. In the present paper we\npropose a consistent generalisation of the WTD from the discrete case to\nsituations where the particles perform continuous barrier-crossing\ncharacterised by a finite duration. To this end, we introduce a recipe to\ncalculate the WTD from the Fokker-Planck/Smoluchowski equation. In contrast to\nthe closely related first passage time distribution (FPTD), which is frequently\nused to describe continuous processes, the WTD contains information about the\ndirection of motion. As an application, we consider the paradigmatic example of\nan overdamped particle diffusing through a washboard potential. To verify the\napproach and to elucidate its numerical implications, we compare the WTD\ndefined via the Smoluchowski equation with data from direct simulation of the\nunderlying Langevin equation and find full consistency provided that the jumps\nin the Langevin approach are defined properly. Moreover, for sufficiently large\nenergy barriers, the WTD defined via the Smoluchowski equation becomes\nconsistent with that resulting from the analytical solution of a (two-state)\nmaster equation model for the short-time dynamics developed previous by us [PRE\n86, 061135 (2012)]. Thus, our approach \"interpolates\" between these two types\nof stochastic motion. We illustrate our approach for both symmetric systems and\nsystems under constant force.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 10 figures"]}]

The thermal emission of CCOs\ncan be modeled to obtain constraints on the physical parameters of the star\nsuch as its mass, radius, effective temperature, and chemical composition.\nAims: The CCO in HESS, J1731-347 is one of the brightest objects of this class.\nWe present our analysis of two new XMM-Newton observations of the source which\nincrease the total exposure time of the by a factor of five compared to the\nanalyses presented before. Methods: We use our numerical spectral models for\ncarbon and hydrogen atmospheres to fit the spectrum of the CCO.

We also\nuse the new data to derive new upper limits on pulsations and to confirm the\nabsence of a long-term variability. Results: The analysis shows that atmosphere\nspectral models are clearly preferred by the fit over the blackbody function.\nUnder the assumption that the X-ray emission is uniformly produced by the\nentire star surface, hydrogen atmosphere models lead to uncomfortably large\ndistances of the CCO, above 7-8 kpc.

Particularly significant determinization methods\nare those that provide a minimal crisp-deterministic fuzzy automaton equivalent\nto the original fuzzy finite automaton, called canonization methods. One\ncanonization method for fuzzy finite automata, the Brzozowski type\ndeterminization, has been developed recently by Jan\\v{c}i\\'{c} and\n\\'{C}iri\\'{c} in [10]. Here we provide another canonization method for a fuzzy\nfinite automaton $\\cal A=(A,\\sigma, \\delta,\\tau)$ over a complete residuated\nlattice $\\cal L$, based on the degrees of inclusion of the right fuzzy\nlanguages associated with states of $\\cal A$ into the left derivatives of the\nfuzzy language recognized by $\\cal A$. The proposed procedure terminates in a\nfinite number of steps whenever the membership values taken by $\\delta $,\n$\\sigma $ and $\\tau $ generate a finite subsemiring of the semiring reduct of\n$\\cal L$. This procedure is generally faster than the Brzozowski type\ndeterminization, and if the basic operations in the residuated lattice $\\cal L$\ncan be performed in constant time, it has the same computational time as all\nother determinization procedures provided in [8], [11], [12].\n","Comment: Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems. arXiv admin note:\n  substantial text overlap with arXiv:1402.6510, arXiv:1311.5799"]}]

The small intrinsic losses in silicon yield relatively high\nquality factors and low non-radiative decay rates of emitters close to the\ncavity, both of which will lead to low thresholds.

Different\napproaches have been adopted to simulate pedestrian movement under various\ncircumstances and interactions. In the present work, bi-directional crowd\nmovement is simulated where an equal numbers of individuals try to reach the\nopposite sides of an environment. Two movement methods are considered. First a\nLeast Effort Model (LEM) is investigated where agents try to take an optimal\npath with as minimal changes from their intended path as possible. Following\nthis, a modified form of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is proposed, where\nindividuals are guided by a goal of reaching the other side in a least effort\nmode as well as a pheromone trail left by predecessors. The basic idea is to\nincrease agent interaction, thereby more closely reflecting a real world\nscenario. The methodology utilizes Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for general\npurpose computing using the CUDA platform. Because of the inherent parallel\nproperties associated with pedestrian movement such as proximate interactions\nof individuals on a 2D grid, GPUs are well suited. The main feature of the\nimplementation undertaken here is that the parallelism is data driven. The data\ndriven implementation leads to a speedup up to 18x compared to its sequential\ncounterpart running on a single threaded CPU. The numbers of pedestrians\nconsidered in the model ranged from 2K to 100K representing numbers typical of\nmass gathering events.

The reduction of\nriboflavin by NADPH catalyzed by flavin reductase has been studied by static\nand rapid kinetics absorption spectroscopies.
