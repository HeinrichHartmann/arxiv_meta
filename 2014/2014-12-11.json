Unfortunately, CNN\nsuffers from over-fiting when it is trained on existing fine-grained image\nclassification benchmarks, which typically only consist of less than a few tens\nof thousands training images. Therefore, we first construct a large-scale\nfine-grained car recognition dataset that consists of 333 car classes with more\nthan 150 thousand training images. With this large-scale dataset, we are able\nto build a strong baseline for CNN with top-1 classification accuracy of 81.6%.\nOne major challenge in fine-grained image classification is that many classes\nare very similar to each other while having large within-class variation. One\ncontributing factor to the within-class variation is cluttered image\nbackground. However, the existing CNN training takes uniform window sampling\nover the image, acting as blind on the location of the object of interest. In\ncontrast, this paper proposes an \\emph{object-centric sampling} (OCS) scheme\nthat samples image windows based on the object location information. The\nchallenge in using the location information lies in how to design powerful\nobject detector and how to handle the imperfectness of detection results. To\nthat end, we design a saliency-aware object detection approach specific for the\nsetting of fine-grained image classification, and the uncertainty of detection\nresults are naturally handled in our OCS scheme. Our framework is demonstrated\nto be very effective, improving top-1 accuracy to 89.3% (from 81.6%) on the\nlarge-scale fine-grained car classification dataset.\n"]}]

Density functional calculations on related models"],"description":["  Superoxide reductase (SOR) is an Fe protein that catalyzes the reduction of\nsuperoxide to give H(2)O(2). Recently, the mutation of the Glu47 residue into\nalanine (E47A) in the active site of SOR from Desulfoarculus baarsii has\nallowed the stabilization of an iron-peroxo species when quickly reacted with\nH(2)O(2) [Math{\\'e} et al. (2002) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 124, 4966-4967]. To further\ninvestigate this non-heme peroxo-iron species, we have carried out a\nM{\\\"o}ssbauer study of the (57)Fe-enriched E47A SOR from D. baarsii reacted\nquickly with H(2)O(2). Considering the M{\\\"o}ssbauer data, we conclude, in\nconjunction with the other spectroscopic data available and with the results of\ndensity functional calculations on related models, that this species\ncorresponds to a high-spin side-on peroxo-Fe(3+) complex. This is one of the\nfirst examples of such a species in a biological system for which M{\\\"o}ssbauer\nparameters are now available: delta(/Fe) = 0.54 (1) mm/s, DeltaE(Q) = -0.80 (5)\nmm/s, and the asymmetry parameter eta = 0.60 (5) mm/s. The M{\\\"o}ssbauer and\nspin Hamiltonian parameters have been evaluated on a model from the side-on\nperoxo complex (model 2) issued from the oxidized iron center in SOR from\nPyrococcus furiosus, for which structural data are available in the literature\n[Yeh et al. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 2499-2508]. For comparison, similar\ncalculations have been carried out on a model derived from 2 (model 3), where\nthe [CH(3)-S](1)(-) group has been replaced by the neutral [NH(3)](0) group\n[Neese and Solomon (1998) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 120, 12829-12848]. Both models 2\nand 3 contain a formally high-spin Fe(3+) ion (i.e., with empty minority spin\norbitals). We found, however, a significant fraction (approximately 0.6 for 2,\napproximately 0.8 for 3) of spin (equivalently charge) spread over two occupied\n(minority spin) orbitals. The quadrupole splitting value for 2 is found to be\nnegative and matches quite well the experimental value. The computed quadrupole\ntensors are rhombic in the case of 2 and axial in the case of 3. This\ndifference originates directly from the presence of the thiolate ligand in 2. A\ncorrelation between experimental isomer shifts for Fe(3+) mononuclear complexes\nwith computed electron densities at the iron nucleus has been built and used to\nevaluate the isomer shift values for 2 and 3 (0.56 and 0.63 mm/s,\nrespectively). A significant increase of isomer shift value is found upon going\nfrom a methylthiolate to a nitrogen ligand for the Fe(3+) ion, consistent with\ncovalency effects due to the presence of the axial thiolate ligand. Considering\nthat the isomer shift value for 3 is likely to be in the 0.61-0.65 mm/s range\n[Horner et al. (2002) Eur. J. Inorg. Chem., 3278-3283], the isomer shift value\nfor a high-spin eta(2)-O(2) Fe(3+) complex with an axial thiolate group can be\nestimated to be in the 0.54-0.58 mm/s range. The occurrence of a side-on peroxo\nintermediate in SOR is discussed in relation to the recent data published for a\nside-on peroxo-Fe(3+) species in another biological system [Karlsson et al.\n(2003) Science 299, 1039-1042].\n","Comment: Biochemistry, American Chemical Society, 2004, pp.8815-25"]}]

We investigate\nrelaxation of nonequilibrium quasiparticles in a small volume Au layer between\nthe Nb tunnel junction and the NbTiN circuit. We find a saturation in the\neffective heat-transfer coefficient consistent with a simple theoretical model.\nThis saturation is determined by the thickness of the Au layer. Our findings\nare important for the design of the ideal Au energy relaxation layer for\npractical SIS heterodyne mixers and we suggest two geometries, one, using a\ncircular Au layer and, two, using a half-circular Au layer.
