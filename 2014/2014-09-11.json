One\ncomplicating factor is that, as the computer adapts to the user, the user also\nadapts to the computer and probably changes their handwriting. This paper\ninvestigates the dynamics of co-adaptation, a process in which both the\ncomputer and the user are adapting their behaviors in order to improve the\nspeed and accuracy of the communication through handwriting. We devised an\ninformation-theoretic framework for quantifying the efficiency of a handwriting\nsystem where the system includes both the user and the computer.

We show that additional external time-periodic fields with zero mean may\ngenerate nonzero time-averaged spin components which are vanishing for the\ntime-averaged Hamiltonian. The reason is a lowering of the dynamical symmetry\nof the system. A harmonic signal with proper orientation is enough to display\nthe effect. We analyze the problem both with and without dissipation, both for\nquantum spins (s=1/2,1) and classical spins. The results are of importance for\ncontrolling the system's state using high or low frequency fields and for using\nnew resonance techniques which probe internal system parameters, to name a few.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 2 figures"]}]

A trial wave function composed of a\nrenormalized single particle Gaussian and a hard sphere Jastrow function for\npair correlations is used to study the sensitivity of condensate and\nnon-condensate properties to the hard sphere radius and the number of\nparticles. Special attention is given to diagonalizing the one body density\nmatrix and obtaining the corresponding single particle natural orbitals and\ntheir occupation numbers for the system. The condensate wave function and\ncondensate fraction are then obtained from the single particle orbital with\nhighest occupation. The effect of interaction on other quantities such as the\nground state energy, the mean radial displacement, and the momentum\ndistribution are calculated as well.

In this paper we explain the dynamical\norigin of this current. We show that the dc current is induced by the presence\nand desymmetrization of ballistic channels inside the stochastic layer. The\nexistence of these channels is due to resonance islands with non-zero winding\nnumbers. The characterization of the flights dynamics inside ballistic channels\nis described by distribution functions.
