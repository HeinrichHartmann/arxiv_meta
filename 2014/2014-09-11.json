In contrast to the Virgo, the red sequence of the Ursa Major cluster\nis only sparsely populated in the optical and ultraviolet colour-magnitude\nrelations. It also shows a statistically significant gap between -18 < Mr < -17\nmag, i.e. the Ursa Major cluster lacks early-type dwarf galaxies at the bright\nend of their luminosity function. We discover that the majority of early-type\ndwarf galaxies in the Ursa Major cluster have blue cores with hints of recent\nor ongoing star formation. We suggest that gravitational tidal interactions can\ntrigger central blue star forming regions in early-type dwarfs. After that,\nstar formation would only fade completely when the galaxies experience ram\npressure stripping or harassment, both of which are nearly absent in the Ursa\nMajor cluster.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 18 figures, 2 tables, Accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

The trivial 2DEG and TSS can both exhibit clear Shubnikov-de Haas\noscillations in magnetoresistance, with different Berry phases ~0 and ~pi that\ndistinguish their different topological characters. We also report a deviation\nfrom the typical weak antilocalization behavior, possibly due to high mobility\nTSS. Our study enables distinguishing, controlling and harnessing electronic\ntransport of TI surface carriers with different topological natures.\n"]}]
