In OFDMA system, each user requires different number of\nsubcarriers to meet its rate requirement. This resource requirement depends on\nthe Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR) experienced by a user. Traditional\nmethods to compute blocking probability cannot be used in relay based cellular\nOFDMA networks. In this paper, we present an approach to compute the blocking\nprobability of such networks. We determine an expression of the probability\ndistribution of the users resource requirement based on its experienced SIR and\nthen classify the users into various classes depending upon their subcarrier\nrequirement. We consider the system to be a multidimensional system with\ndifferent classes and evaluate the blocking probability of system using the\nmulti-dimensional Erlang loss formulas.\n","Comment: 33 pages, 10 figures"]}]

In this paper, we examine clustered\nmutations that are segregating in a set of 1,092 human genomes, demonstrating\nthat MNMs become enriched as large numbers of individuals are sampled. We\nleverage the size of the dataset to deduce new information about the allelic\nspectrum of MNMs, estimating the percentage of linked SNP pairs that were\ngenerated by simultaneous mutation as a function of the distance between the\naffected sites and showing that MNMs exhibit a high percentage of transversions\nrelative to transitions. These findings are reproducible in data from multiple\nsequencing platforms.

The main goal of the short-term\nrecovery is to bounce the damaged system back to the operating standards\nenabling residents in damaged cities to survive, and fast supply with vital\nresources to them is one of its important elements. We propose a general\nprinciple by which the required redistribution of vital resources between the\naffected and neighbouring cities can be efficiently implemented. The short-term\nrecovery is a rescuer operation where uncertainty in evaluating the state of\ndamaged region is highly probable. To allow for such an operation the developed\nprinciple involves two basic components. The first one of ethic nature is the\ntriage concept determining the current city priority in the resource delivery.\nThe second one is the minimization of the delivery time subjected to this\npriority. Finally a certain plan of the resource redistribution is generated\naccording to this principle. Several specific examples are studied numerically.\nIt elucidates, in particular, the effects of system characteristics such as the\ncity limit capacity in resource delivery, the type of initial resource\nallocation among the cities, the number of cities able to participate in the\nresource redistribution, and the damage level in the affected cities. As far as\nthe uncertainty in evaluating the state of damaged region is concerned, some\nspecific cases were studied.

Funding costs and specific close-out procedures at default break the\nbilateral nature of the deal price and render the valuation problem a\nnon-linear and recursive one. CVA and FVA are in general not really additive\nadjustments, and the risk for double counting is concrete. We introduce a new\nadjustment, called a Non-linearity Valuation Adjustment (NVA), to address\ndouble-counting. The theoretical risk free rate disappears from our final\nequations. The framework can be tailored also to CCP trading under initial and\nvariation margins, as explained in detail in Brigo and Pallavicini (2014). In\nparticular, we allow for asymmetric collateral and funding rates, replacement\nclose-out and re-hypothecation. The valuation equation takes the form of a\nbackward stochastic differential equation or semi-linear partial differential\nequation, and can be cast as a set of iterative equations that can be solved by\nleast-squares Monte Carlo. We propose such a simulation algorithm in a case\nstudy involving a generalization of the benchmark model of Black and Scholes\nfor option pricing. Our numerical results confirm that funding risk has a\nnon-trivial impact on the deal price, and that double counting matters too.

It does this, for the period\nfrom the present to 2050, for a comprehensive range of future global fossil\nfuel energy use scenarios. The results show that even for a business-as-usual\n(the mid-level IPCC) fossil fuel use estimate, global surface temperature will\nrise at a slower rate than for the recent period 1960-2000. Concerning peak\nfossil fuel, for the most common scenario the currently observed\n(1998-2013)temperature plateau will turn into a decrease. The observed trend to\ndate for temperature is compared with that for global climate disasters: these\npeaked in 2005 and are notably decreasing. The temperature and disaster results\ntaken together are consistent with either a reduced business-as-usual fossil\nfuel use scenario into the future, or a peak fossil fuel scenario, but not with\nthe standard business-as-usual scenario. If the future follows a peak fossil\nfuel pathway, a markedly decreasing trend in global surface temperature should\nbecome apparent over the next few years. If entertained, these results are\nevidence that the climate problem may require less preventative action. If so,\nthe same evidence is support for the case that the peak fossil fuel problem\ndoes require preventative action. This action is the same as it would have been\nfor climate - the rapid transition to a predominantly renewable global energy\nsystem.\n"]}]

The parameter estimation for HMMs from time series data is an\nimportant learning problem. The predominant methods for parameter estimation\nare based on local search heuristics, most notably the expectation-maximization\n(EM) algorithm. These methods are prone to local optima and oftentimes suffer\nfrom high computational and sample complexity. Recent years saw the emergence\nof spectral methods for the parameter estimation of HMMs, based on a method of\nmoments approach. Two spectral learning algorithms as proposed by Hsu, Kakade\nand Zhang 2012 (arXiv:0811.4413) and Anandkumar, Hsu and Kakade 2012\n(arXiv:1203.0683) are assessed in this work. Using experiments with synthetic\ndata, the algorithms are compared with each other. Furthermore, the spectral\nmethods are compared to the Baum-Welch algorithm, a well-established method\napplying the EM algorithm to HMMs. The spectral algorithms are found to have a\nmuch more favorable computational and sample complexity. Even though the\nalgorithms readily handle high dimensional observation spaces, instability\nissues are encountered in this regime.
