The\navailability of wide entropy variations motivated us for an investigation over\nthe suitability preference of these versions to specific operations.\nMethodologies were implemented in Matlab and were enhanced with entropy\nvariations. Evaluation of various implementations was based on different\nstatistical parameters with reference to the study area The popular available\nversions like Tsalli's, Shanon's, and Renyi's entropies were analysed in\ncontext of various remote sensing operations namely thresholding, clustering\nand registration.\n"]}]

For example, the main concern of clustering-based outlier detection\nalgorithms is to find clusters and outliers, which are often regarded as noise\nthat should be removed in order to make more reliable clustering. In this\narticle, we present an algorithm that provides outlier detection and data\nclustering simultaneously. The algorithmimprovesthe estimation of centroids of\nthe generative distribution during the process of clustering and outlier\ndiscovery. The proposed algorithm consists of two stages.
