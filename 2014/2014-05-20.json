We previously reported that a liquid film in an external\nelectric field rotates when an electric current passes through it, naming it\nthe liquid film motor (LFM). In this paper we report a novel technique, in\nwhich a similar device can be used as an electric generator, converting the\nrotating mechanical energy to electrical energy. The liquid film electric\ngenerator (LFEG) is in stark contrast to the LFM, both of which could be\ndesigned similarly in very small scales like micro scales with different\napplications.

The phenomenon\nwhich more competitive nodes become richer links can help us to understand the\nevolution of many competitive systems in nature and society. In general, the\npaper provides an explicit analytical expression of degree distributions of the\nnetwork. In particular, the model yields a nontrivial time evolution of nodes'\nproperties and scale-free behavior with exponents depending on the microscopic\nparameters characterizing the competition rules. Secondly, through theoretical\nanalysis and numerical simulations, it reveals that our model has not only the\nuniversality for the homogeneous weighted network, but also the character for\nthe heterogeneous weighted network. Thirdly, the paper also develops a model\nbased on a profit-driven mechanism. It can better describe the observed\nphenomenon in enterprise cooperation networks. We show that standard\npreferential attachment, the growing random graph, the initial attractiveness\nmodel, the fitness model and weighted networks, can all be seen as degenerate\ncases of our model.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 6 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1101.1638; and with arXiv:cond-mat/0406238 by other authors"]}]

A power scan from dcMS-like to HiPIMS plasmas was\nperformed, with a 2-inch magnetron and a titanium target as sputter source and\nargon as working gas. Clear differences in the transport as well in the\nenergetic properties of Ar$^{+}$, Ar$^{2+}$, Ti$^+$ and Ti$^{2+}$ were\nobserved. For discharges with highest peak power densities a high energetic\ngroup of Ti$^+$ and Ti$^{2+}$ could be identified. A cold group of ions is\nalways present. It is found that hot ions are observed only, when the plasma\nenters the spokes regime, which can be monitored by oscillations in the\nIV-characteristics in the MHz range that are picked up by the used VI-probes.\nThese oscillations are correlated with the spokes phenomenon and are explained\nas an amplification of the Hall current inside the spokes as hot ionization\nzones. To explain the presence of energetic ions, we propose a double layer\n(DL) confining the hot plasma inside a spoke: if an atom becomes ionized inside\nthe spokes region it is accelerated because of the DL to higher energies\nwhereas its energy remains unchanged if it is ionized outside. In applying this\nDL model to our measurements the observed phenomena as well as several\nmeasurements from other groups can be explained. Only if spokes and a double\nlayer are present the confined particles can gain enough energy to leave the\nmagnetic trap. We conclude from our findings that the spoke phenomenon\nrepresents the essence of HiPIMS plasmas, explaining their good performance for\nmaterial synthesis applications.\n","Comment: Intended for Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics, Special issue\n  \"Fundamentals of plasma-surface interactions\""]}]

Specifically, in the case of\n$\\mu < \\mu_c$, the shapes of the resistivity (dephasing rate) curves for\ndifferent $\\mu$ are nearly identical. However, as temperature decreases, they\nstart to increase to their maxima at a lower $T/T_K$ but more rapidly [as\n$(T_K/T)^{3/2}$] than in normal metals [here $T$ ($T_K$) denotes the (Kondo)\ntemperature]. As $T$ further decreases, after reaching the maximum, the\ndephasing rate drops more quickly than in normal metals, behaving as\n$(T/T_K)^3$ instead of $(T/T_K)^2$. Furthermore, the resistivity has a distinct\npeak above the saturation value near $T_K$. In the case of $\\mu > \\mu_c$, in\ncontrast, the resistivity curve has an additional broad shoulder above 10$T_K$\nand the dephasing rate exhibits an interesting shoulder-peak shape. In the\nnarrow boundary region ($\\mu \\approx \\mu_c$), both the resistivity and\ndephasing rate curves are similar to the corresponding ones in normal metals.\nThis explains the conventional Kondo like resistivity from recent experiments\non graphene with defects. The resistivity and dephasing rate are analysized in\nterms of the calculated $T$-dependent spectral function, correlation\nself-energy and renormalized impurity level.\n"]}]

A CA\ncomprises a lattice of cells whose states change over time based on a discrete\nupdate function. One challenge to developing CA is that the relationship of an\nupdate function, which describes the local behavior of each cell, to the global\nbehavior of the entire CA is often unclear.

A main merit of the proposed\nstrategy is its ability to effectively identify and mitigate the dominant\ninterference for each user. Different from existing works, each user selects\nthe coordinating base stations (BSs) based on the relative distance between the\nhome BS and the interfering BSs, called the interference nulling (IN) range,\nand thus interference nulling adapts to each user's own interference situation.\nBy adopting a random spatial network model, we derive an approximate expression\nof the successful transmission probability to the typical user, which is then\nused to determine the optimal IN range. Simulation results shall confirm the\ntightness of the approximation, and demonstrate significant performance gains\n(about 35%-40%) of the proposed coordination strategy, compared with the\nnon-coordination case. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed strategy\noutperforms other interference nulling methods.
