We\nconduct a time series analysis on X-ray light curves ($0.3-10$ keV) of a sample\nof active galactic nuclei (AGNs). A statistically significant bend frequency is\ninferred in 9 of 58 light curves (16 %) from 3 AGNs for which the break\ntimescale is consistent with the reported BH spin but not with the reported BH\nmass. Upper limits of $2.85 \\times 10^7 M_\\odot$ in NGC 4051, $8.02 \\times 10^7\nM_\\odot$ in MRK 766 and $4.68 \\times 10^7 M_\\odot$ in MCG-6-30-15 are inferred\nfor maximally spinning BHs. For REJ 1034+396, where a QPO at 3733 s was\nreported, we obtain an emission region size of $(6 - 6.5) M$ and a BH spin\n$a\\lesssim$ 0.08. The relativistic inner region of a thin disk, dominated by\nradiation pressure and electron scattering is likely to host the orbital\nfeatures as the simulated $Q$ ranges from $6.3 \\times 10^{-2}$ to $4.25 \\times\n10^6$, containing the observed $Q$. The derived value of $Q \\sim$ 32 for REJ\n1034+396 therefore suggests that the AGN hosts a thin disk.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 11 figures (9 sub-figures); 4 Tables; 1 appendix; published\n  in the Astrophysical Journal"]}]

The strength of the alignment is dependent on the properties of both the\nsatellites and centrals. Theoretical studies using dissipationless N-body\nsimulations are limited by their inability to directly predict the shape of\nCGs. Using hydrodynamical simulations including gas cooling, star formation,\nand feedback, we carry out a study of galaxy alignment and its dependence on\nthe galaxy properties predicted directly from the simulations.We found that the\nobserved alignment signal is well produced, as is the color dependence: red\nsatellites and red centrals both show stronger alignments than their blue\ncounterparts. The reason for the stronger alignment of red satellites is that\nmost of them stay in the inner region of the dark matter halo where the shape\nof the CG better traces the dark matter distribution. The dependence of\nalignment on the color of CGs arises from the halo mass dependence, since the\nalignment between the shape of the central stellar component and the inner halo\nincreases with halo mass. We also find that the alignment of satellites is most\nstrongly dependent on their metallicity, suggesting that the metallicity of\nsatellites, rather than color, is a better tracer of galaxy alignment on small\nscales.

The equations of state from the relativistic mean\nfield theory and the MIT bag model are adopted to simulate compact stars.\nNumerical calculations of rigidly rotating neutron stars are performed using\nthe RNS code in the framework of general relativity by solving the Einstein\nequations for stationary axis-symmetric spacetime. The crust structure of\ncompact stars is found to be a key factor to determine the maximum value of the\nspin parameter $j_{\\rm max}$. For the stars with inclusion of the crust,\n$j_{\\rm max}\\sim 0.7$ is sustained for various kinds of compact stars with\n$M>0.5 M_{\\odot}$, and is found to be insensitive to the mass of star and\nselected equations of state. For the traditional neutron stars, hyperonic\nneutron stars and hybrid stars without crust structure, the value $j_{\\rm max}$\nlies in the range of $[0.7, 1.0]$. Thus, not $j>0.7$ but $j>1$ could be treated\nas the candidate criterion to distinguish the strange quark stars from the\nother kinds of compact stars. Furthermore, a universal formula\n$j=0.48(f/f_K)^3-0.42(f/f_K)^2+0.63(f/f_K)$ is suggested to calculate the spin\nparameter at any rotational frequency for all kinds of compact stars with crust\nstructure and $M>0.5M_{\\odot}$.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables"]}]

The value of q is\ntypically determined from a piece of data and then fixed over the range of\ninterest. On the other hand, from a phenomenological viewpoint, there are\ninstances in which q cannot be treated as a constant.\n  We present two distinct approaches for determining q depending on the form of\nthe equations of constraint for the particular system. In the first case the\nequations of constraint for an operator O can be written as $Tr[F^{q}O]=C$,\nwhere C may be an explicit function of the distribution function, F. In this\ncase one can solve an equivalent MAXENT problem which yields q as a function of\nthe corresponding Lagrange Multiplier. As an illustration the exact solutions\nto the static Generalized Fokker-Planck Equation (GFP) are obtained from\nMAXENT. As in the case where C is a constant if q is treated as a variable\nwithin the MAXENT framework, the entropic measure is maximized for all values\nof q trivially. Therefore q must be determined from existing data. In the\nsecond case an additional equation of constraint exists which cannot be brought\ninto the above form.
