Instead we propose that a 90-deg\nleft-turn around the body-axis evolved in a common ancestor of all vertebrates.\nCompensatory migrations of the tissues during development restore body\nsymmetry.

The number of donor hearts available currently is less than 3,000 per\nannum worldwide. Apart from the relatively fortunate people who receive donor\nhearts for transplant, the only alternative for people with HF is the\nimplantation of rotary blood pump (IRBP). In fact, an IRBP with its continuous\noperation requires a more complex controller to achieve basic physiological\nrequirements. The essential control requirement of an IRBP needs to mimic the\nway that the heart pumps as much blood to the arterial circulation as it\nreceives from the venous circulation. This research aims to design, develop and\nimplement novel control strategies combining sensorless and non-invasive data\nmeasurements to provide an adaptive and fairly robust preload sensitive\ncontroller for IRBPs subjected to varying patient conditions, model\nuncertainties and external disturbances. A sensorless pulastile flow estimator\nwas developed using collected data from animal experiments.

Immediate responses of the controllers to short-term circulatory\nchanges as well as adaptive characteristics of the controllers in response to\nlong-term changes are examined in a parameter-optimised model of CVS - IRBP\ninteractions.

In mechanism design, auctions are usually designed\nto incentivize advertisers to bid their truthful valuations and to assure both\nthe advertisers and the auctioneer a non-negative utility. Nonetheless, in\nsponsored search auctions, the click-through-rates (CTRs) of the advertisers\nare often unknown to the auctioneer and thus standard truthful mechanisms\ncannot be directly applied and must be paired with an effective learning\nalgorithm for the estimation of the CTRs. This introduces the critical problem\nof designing a learning mechanism able to estimate the CTRs at the same time as\nimplementing a truthful mechanism with a revenue loss as small as possible\ncompared to an optimal mechanism designed with the true CTRs. Previous work\nshowed that, when dominant-strategy truthfulness is adopted, in single-slot\nauctions the problem can be solved using suitable exploration-exploitation\nmechanisms able to achieve a per-step regret (over the auctioneer's revenue) of\norder $O(T^{-1/3})$ (where T is the number of times the auction is repeated).\nIt is also known that, when truthfulness in expectation is adopted, a per-step\nregret (over the social welfare) of order $O(T^{-1/2})$ can be obtained. In\nthis paper we extend the results known in the literature to the case of\nmulti-slot auctions.

Second, we\npropose two algorithms for modelling and resource provisioning of MapReduce\napplications (a well-known parametric distributed framework currently used by\nGoogle, Yahoo, Facebook and LinkedIn) based on its configuration parameters.\nCertainly, estimating the performance (e.g., execution time or CPU clock ticks)\nof a MapReduce application can be later used for smart scheduling of such\napplications in clouds or clusters.\n  To evaluate the algorithms, we have conducted extensive simulation and real\nexperiments on a 5-node physical cluster with up to 25 virtual nodes, using\nboth synthetic and real world applications. Also, the proposed new algorithms\nare compared with existing algorithms by experimentation, and the experimental\nresults reveal new information on the performance of these algorithms, as well\nas on the properties of MapReduce and DVFS.

In this paper, we study new models\nfor optimizing fare inspection strategies in transit networks based on bilevel\nprogramming. In the first level, the leader (the network operator) determines\nprobabilities for inspecting passengers at different locations, while in the\nsecond level, the followers (the fare-evading passengers) respond by optimizing\ntheir routes given the inspection probabilities and travel times. To model the\nfollowers' behavior we study both a non-adaptive variant, in which passengers\nselect a path a priori and continue along it throughout their journey, and an\nadaptive variant, in which they gain information along the way and use it to\nupdate their route. For these problems, which are interesting in their own\nright, we design exact and approximation algorithms and we prove a tight bound\nof 3/4 on the ratio of the optimal cost between adaptive and non-adaptive\nstrategies. For the leader's optimization problem, we study a fixed-fare and a\nflexible-fare variant, where ticket prices may or may not be set at the\noperator's will. For the latter variant, we design an LP based approximation\nalgorithm. Finally, using a local search procedure that shifts inspection\nprobabilities within an initially determined support set, we perform an\nextensive computational study for all variants of the problem on instances of\nthe Dutch railway and the Amsterdam subway network. This study reveals that our\nsolutions are within 95% of theoretical upper bounds drawn from the LP\nrelaxation.\n"]}]

A poset is a reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive digraph. The\nproblem encompasses the fundamental embedding problem of finding an isomorphic\ncopy of a poset as an induced substructure of another poset.\n  Model checking existential logic is already NP-hard on a fixed poset; thus we\ninvestigate structural properties of posets yielding conditions for\nfixed-parameter tractability when the problem is parameterized by the sentence.\nWe identify width as a central structural property (the width of a poset is the\nmaximum size of a subset of pairwise incomparable elements); our main\nalgorithmic result is that model checking existential logic on classes of\nfinite posets of bounded width is fixed-parameter tractable. We observe a\nsimilar phenomenon in classical complexity, where we prove that the isomorphism\nproblem is polynomial-time tractable on classes of posets of bounded width;\nthis settles an open problem in order theory.\n  We surround our main algorithmic result with complexity results on less\nrestricted, natural neighboring classes of finite posets, establishing its\ntightness in this sense. We also relate our work with (and demonstrate its\nindependence of) fundamental fixed-parameter tractability results for model\nchecking on digraphs of bounded degree and bounded clique-width.\n","Comment: accepted at CSL-LICS 2014"]}]

This\neffectively alters the synaptic strength of a connection. Much work on\nneuromodulation has rested on the assumption that these effects are uniform at\nevery neuron. However, there is considerable evidence to suggest that\npresynaptic regulation may be in effect synapse-specific. This would define a\nsecond \"weight modulation\" matrix, which reflects presynaptic receptor efficacy\nat a given site. Here we explore functional consequences of this hypothesis. By\nanalyzing and comparing the weight matrices of networks trained on different\naspects of a task, we identify the potential for a low complexity \"modulation\nmatrix\", which allows to switch between differently trained subtasks while\nretaining general performance characteristics for the task. This means that a\ngiven network can adapt itself to different task demands by regulating its\nrelease of neuromodulators. Specifically, we suggest that (a) a network can\nprovide optimized responses for related classification tasks without the need\nto train entirely separate networks and (b) a network can blend a \"memory mode\"\nwhich aims at reproducing memorized patterns and a \"novelty mode\" which aims to\nfacilitate classification of new patterns.
