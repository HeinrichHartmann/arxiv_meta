In a traditional linear receiver architecture, the\nreceive antennas are used to separate out the codewords sent by each transmit\nantenna, which can then be decoded individually. Although easy to implement,\nthis approach can be highly suboptimal when the channel matrix is near\nsingular. This paper develops a new linear receiver architecture that uses the\nreceive antennas to create an effective channel matrix with integer-valued\nentries. Rather than attempting to recover transmitted codewords directly, the\ndecoder recovers integer combinations of the codewords according to the entries\nof the effective channel matrix. The codewords are all generated using the same\nlinear code which guarantees that these integer combinations are themselves\ncodewords. Provided that the effective channel is full rank, these integer\ncombinations can then be digitally solved for the original codewords. This\npaper focuses on the special case where there is no coding across transmit\nantennas and no channel state information at the transmitter(s), which\ncorresponds either to a multi-user uplink scenario or to single-user V-BLAST\nencoding. In this setting, the proposed integer-forcing linear receiver\nsignificantly outperforms conventional linear architectures such as the\nzero-forcing and linear MMSE receiver. In the high SNR regime, the proposed\nreceiver attains the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff for the standard\nMIMO channel with no coding across transmit antennas. It is further shown that\nin an extended MIMO model with interference, the integer-forcing linear\nreceiver achieves the optimal generalized degrees-of-freedom.\n","Comment: 40 pages, 16 figures, to appear in the IEEE Transactions on\n  Information Theory"]}]

The\nprecise shape of the signal is governed by the interplay of gravity, rotation,\nnuclear equation of state (EOS), and electron capture during collapse.

In this paper, we point out that the\nrecent observations of Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropies by the Planck\nsatellite and by the BICEP2 experiment constrain these parameters with such a\nhigh level of accuracy that the primordial deuterium abundance can be inferred\nwith remarkable precision. For a given cosmological model, one can obtain\nindependent information on nuclear processes in the energy range relevant for\nBBN, which determine the eventual ^2H/H yield. In particular, assuming the\nstandard cosmological model, we show that a combined analysis of Planck data\nand of recent deuterium abundance measurements in metal-poor damped Lyman-alpha\nsystems provides independent information on the cross section of the radiative\ncapture reaction d(p,\\gamma)^3He converting deuterium into helium.\nInterestingly, the result is higher than the values suggested by a fit of\npresent experimental data in the BBN energy range (10 - 300 keV), whereas it is\nin better agreement with ab initio theoretical calculations, based on models\nfor the nuclear electromagnetic current derived from realistic interactions.\nDue to the correlation between the rate of the above nuclear process and the\neffective number of neutrinos Neff, the same analysis points out a Neff>3 as\nwell. We show how this observation changes when assuming a non-minimal\ncosmological scenario. We conclude that further data on the d(p,\\gamma)^3He\ncross section in the few hundred keV range, that can be collected by\nexperiments like LUNA, may either confirm the low value of this rate, or rather\ngive some hint in favour of next-to-minimal cosmological scenarios.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 9 figures"]}]

So far, this relation has also been\ntrue for artificial atoms made out of superconducting circuits or quantum dots,\ninteracting with microwave radiation. However, recent and ongoing experiments\nusing surface acoustic waves show that a single artificial atom can be coupled\nto a bosonic field at several points wavelengths apart. Here, we theoretically\nstudy this type of system. We find that the multiple coupling points give rise\nto a frequency dependence in the coupling strength between the atom and its\nenvironment, and also in the Lamb shift of the atom. The frequency dependence\nis given by the discrete Fourier transform of the coupling point coordinates\nand can therefore be designed. We discuss a number of possible applications for\nthis phenomenon, including tunable coupling, single-atom lasing, and other\neffects that can be achieved by designing the relative coupling strengths of\ndifferent transitions in a multi-level atom.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 8 figures"]}]

Special cases are classification (the problem of estimating a map\nfrom a set of to-be-classified elements to a set of labels), clustering (the\nproblem of estimating an equivalence relation on a set) and ranking (the\nproblem of estimating a linear order on a set). We contribute a family of\nprobability measures on the set of all relations between two finite, non-empty\nsets, which offers a joint abstraction of multi-label classification,\ncorrelation clustering and ranking by linear ordering. Estimating (learning) a\nmaximally probable measure, given (a training set of) related and unrelated\npairs, is a convex optimization problem. Estimating (inferring) a maximally\nprobable relation, given a measure, is a 01-linear program. It is solved in\nlinear time for maps. It is NP-hard for equivalence relations and linear\norders. Practical solutions for all three cases are shown in experiments with\nreal data. Finally, estimating a maximally probable measure and relation\njointly is posed as a mixed-integer nonlinear program.

Determining the affinity and kinetic steps of such\ninteractions is challenging due to the competition between hydrophobic\nself-aggregating forces and electrostatic binding forces. Kahalalide F (KF) is\nan anticancer hydrophobic peptide which contains a single positive charge that\nconfers strong aggregative properties with polyanions. This makes KF an ideal\nmodel to elucidate the mechanisms by which self-aggregation competes with\nbinding to a strongly charged polyelectrolyte such as DNA. We use optical\ntweezers to apply mechanical forces to single DNA molecules and show that KF\nand DNA interact in a two-step kinetic process promoted by the electrostatic\nbinding of DNA to the aggregate surface followed by the stabilization of the\ncomplex due to hydrophobic interactions. From the measured pulling curves we\ndetermine the spectrum of binding affinities, kinetic barriers and lengths of\nDNA segments sequestered within the KF-DNA complex. We find there is a capture\ndistance beyond which the complex collapses into compact aggregates stabilized\nby strong hydrophobic forces, and discuss how the bending rigidity of the\nnucleic acid affects such process. We hypothesize that within an in vivo\ncontext, the enhanced electrostatic interaction of KF due to its aggregation\nmight mediate the binding to other polyanions. The proposed methodology should\nbe useful to quantitatively characterize other compounds or proteins in which\nthe formation of aggregates is relevant.\n","Comment: 34 pages, 8 figures, Supplementary Information"]}]

Chang proved that any totally\nordered $MV$-algebra $A$ was isomorphic to the segment $A \\cong \\Gamma(A^*, u)$\nof a totally ordered $l$-group with strong unit $A^*$. This was done by the\nsimple intuitive idea of putting denumerable copies of $A$ on top of each other\n(indexed by the integers). Moreover, he also show that any such group $G$ can\nbe recovered from its segment since $G \\cong \\Gamma(G, u)^*$, establishing an\nequivalence of categories. In \"Interpretation of AF $C^*$-algebras in\nLukasiewicz sentential calculus\" (J. Funct. Anal. Vol. 65) D. Mundici extended\nthis result to arbitrary $MV$-algebras and $l$-groups with strong unit. He\ntakes the representation of $A$ as a sub-direct product of chains $A_i$, and\nobserves that $A \\overset {} {\\hookrightarrow} \\prod_i G_i$ where $G_i =\nA_i^*$. Then he let $A^*$ be the $l$-subgroup generated by $A$ inside $\\prod_i\nG_i$. He proves that this idea works, and establish an equivalence of\ncategories in a rather elaborate way by means of his concept of good sequences\nand its complicated arithmetics. In this note, essentially self-contained\nexcept for Chang's result, we give a simple proof of this equivalence taking\nadvantage directly of the arithmetics of the the product $l$-group $\\prod_i\nG_i$, avoiding entirely the notion of good sequence.\n","Comment: 6 pages"]}]
