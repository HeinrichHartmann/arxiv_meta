In this thesis, variational integrators are developed\nfor several important models of plasma physics: guiding centre dynamics\n(particle dynamics), the Vlasov-Poisson system (kinetic theory), and ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamics (plasma fluid theory). Special attention is given to\nphysical conservation laws like conservation of energy and momentum.\n  Most systems in plasma physics do not possess a Lagrangian formulation to\nwhich the variational integrator methodology is directly applicable. Therefore\nthe theory is extended towards nonvariational differential equations by linking\nit to Ibragimov's theory of integrating factors and adjoint equations. It\nallows us to find a Lagrangian for all ordinary and partial differential\nequations and systems thereof. Consequently, the applicability of variational\nintegrators is extended to a much larger family of systems than envisaged in\nthe original theory. This approach allows for the application of Noether's\ntheorem to analyse the conservation properties of the system, both at the\ncontinuous and the discrete level.\n  In numerical examples, the conservation properties of the derived schemes are\nanalysed. In case of guiding centre dynamics, momentum in the toroidal\ndirection of a tokamak is preserved exactly. The particle energy exhibits an\nerror, but the absolute value of this error stays constant during the entire\nsimulation. Therefore numerical dissipation is absent. In case of the kinetic\ntheory, the total number of particles, total linear momentum and total energy\nare preserved exactly, i.e., up to machine accuracy.

We study\nan event which occurred in NOAA 8471, where a flare and the activation of (at\nleast) two filaments were observed on 28 February 1999.

The extrapolation of the magnetic field lines is done using the\nSOHO/MDI magnetograms and assuming a potential field.

The proposed saliency learning and matching\nframework consists of four steps: (1) To handle misalignment caused by drastic\nviewpoint change and pose variations, we apply adjacency constrained patch\nmatching to build dense correspondence between image pairs.

(3) saliency\nmatching is proposed based on patch matching. Matching patches with\ninconsistent saliency brings penalty, and images of the same identity are\nrecognized by minimizing the saliency matching cost. (4) Furthermore, saliency\nmatching is tightly integrated with patch matching in a unified structural\nRankSVM learning framework. The effectiveness of our approach is validated on\nthe VIPeR dataset and the CUHK01 dataset.

The aim of this paper is to analyse the previously discovered\ndiscontinuity of the periodicity of the GeV $\\gamma$-ray emission of the\nradio-loud X-ray binary LS I +61{\\deg}303 and to determine its physical origin.\nMethods. We used wavelet analysis to explore the temporal development of\nperiodic signals. The wavelet analysis was first applied to the whole data set\nof available Fermi-LAT data and then to the two subsets of orbital phase\nintervals $\\Phi = 0.0 - 0.5$ and $\\Phi = 0.5 - 1.0$. We also performed a\nLomb-Scargle timing Analysis. We investigated the similarities between GeV\n$\\gamma$-ray emission and radio emission by comparing the folded curves of the\nFermi-LAT data and the Green Bank Interferometer radio data. Results. During\nthe epochs when the timing analysis fails to determine the orbital periodicity,\nthe periodicity is present in the two orbital phase intervals $\\Phi = 0.0 -\n0.5$ and $\\Phi = 0.5 - 1.0$. That is, there are two periodical signals, one\ntowards periastron (i.e., $\\Phi = 0.0 - 0.5$) and another one towards apoastron\n($\\Phi = 0.5 - 1.0$).

Conclusions. The\n$\\gamma$-ray emission of the apoastron peak normally just broadens the emission\nof the peak around periastron. Only when it appears at $\\Phi \\approx 0.8 -\n1.0$, because of the orbital shift, it is enough detached from the first peak\nto become recognisable as a second orbital peak, which is the reason why the\ntiming analysis fails.

Our framework describes several semidefinite and polyhedral\nrelaxations of the stable set polytope of a graph as generalized theta bodies.\nAs a by-product of our approach, we introduce the notion of \"Schur Lifting\" of\ncones which is dual to PSD Lifting (more commonly used in SDP relaxations of\ncombinatorial optimization problems) in our axiomatic generalization. We also\ngeneralize the notion of complements of graphs to diagonally scaling-invariant\npolyhedral cones.

First, a real-valued function is learned by minimizing a\nsurrogate loss for binary classification, such as logistic loss, on the\ntraining sample. Then, a threshold is tuned on a separate validation sample, by\ndirect optimization of AMS. We show that the regret of the resulting\n(thresholded) classifier measured with respect to the squared AMS, is\nupperbounded by the regret of the underlying real-valued function measured with\nrespect to the logistic loss. Hence, we prove that minimizing logistic\nsurrogate is a consistent method of optimizing AMS.\n","Comment: 9 pages, HEPML workshop at NIPS 2014"]}]

The alluded growth rate is estimated through the\nvariation in the number of eggs per gram (EPG) of faeces in animals. In\naccordance with earlier studies, our analysis too shows that rainfall is the\ndominant variable in determining EPG infection rates compared to other\nmacro-parameters like temperature and humidity. Our statistical analysis\nclearly indicates an oscillatory dependence of EPG levels on rainfall\nfluctuations. Monsoon recorded the highest infection with a comparative\nincrease of at least 2.5 times compared to the next most infected period\n(summer). A least square fit of the EPG versus rainfall data indicates an\napproach towards a super diffusive (i. e. root mean square displacement growing\nfaster than the square root of the elapsed time as obtained for simple\ndiffusion) infection growth pattern regime for low rainfall regimes\n(technically defined as zeroth level dependence) that gets remarkably augmented\nfor large rainfall zones. Our analysis further indicates that for low\nfluctuations in temperature (true on the bulk data), EPG level saturates beyond\na critical value of the rainfall, a threshold that is expected to indicate the\nonset of the nonlinear regime. The probability density functions (PDFs) of the\nEPG data show oscillatory behavior in the large rainfall regime (greater than\n500 mm), the frequency of oscillation, once again, being determined by the\nambient wetness (rainfall, and humidity). Data recorded over three pilot\nprojects spanning three measures of rainfall and humidity bear testimony to the\nuniversality of this statistical argument.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 12 figures"]}]
