D2D\nconnections can be instrumental in localized aggregation of uplink M2M traffic\nto a more capable cellular device, before being finally delivered to the Base\nStation (BS).

While assuming that $B$ knows the channel $B-U$, but not the interfering\nchannels from the MTDs to $U$, we prove that there is a positive downlink rate\nthat can always be decoded by $U$, leading to zero-outage of the downlink\nsignal. This is a rather surprising consequence of the features of the multiple\naccess channel and the fixed rate $R_M$.

This is\nexacerbated by the fact that, in general, a given protein cannot be defined by\na fixed sequence of amino acids due to the existence of splice variants and\nisoforms of that protein. Therefore, the problem of protein inference could be\nconsidered as one of identifying sequences of amino acids with some limited\ntolerance. Two problems arise from this: a) due to these variations, the\napplicability of exact string matching methodologies could be questioned and b)\nthe difficulty of defining a reference sequence for a particular set of\nproteins that are functionally indistinguishable, but with some variation in\nfeatures. This paper presents a model-based inference approach that is\ndeveloped and validated to solve the inference problem. Our approach starts\nfrom an examination of the known set of splice variants and isoforms of a\ntarget protein to identify the Greatest Common Stable Substring (GCSS) of amino\nacids and the Substrings Subjects to Limited Variation (SSLV) and their\nrespective locations on the GCSS.

Continuum models\nfall into two classes: sharp-interface models, where interfaces are singular\nsurfaces; and regularized-interface models, such as phase-field models, where\ninterfaces are smeared out. The former are challenging for numerical solutions\nbecause the interfaces need to be explicitly tracked, but have the advantage\nthat the kinetics of existing interfaces and the nucleation of new interfaces\ncan be transparently and precisely prescribed.

Here, we present a universal analytic framework\nthat enables systematic characterisation of nonlocality in a wide variety of\ntransport regimes. A generalised diffusivity kernel $D^{\\ast}$ fully embodies\nthe spatiotemporal flux memory with respect to the gradient. An extension of\nthe flux-gradient relation for subdiffusive transport is also proposed. Several\nconservation and invariance properties can be deduced, including that\nPoissonian flight processes have no flux memory in time while fractional time\ndiffusion has no flux memory in space. We derive analytical expressions for\n$D^{\\ast}(x,t)$ in several types of anomalous transport dynamics that are\ncommonly encountered in practice, being fractional diffusion equations,\ntempered L\\'evy superdiffusion, and tempered fractional time diffusion. This\ndetailed knowledge of the shape and nature of the flux memory, and the\ncorresponding length and time scales over which nonlocal effects are physically\nimportant, remain completely hidden in conventional analyses based on tracer\ndistributions or flux-gradient diagrams.

A first\nstep involves dualising a criterion for the reality of the wavefunction\nproposed by Harrigan & Spekkens, which was central to the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph\ntheorem. The resulting criterion has several advantages, including the\navoidance of certain technical difficulties relating to sets of measure zero.\nBy considering the 'reality' not of the wavefunction but of the observable\nproperties of any ontological physical theory a new characterisation of\nnon-locality and contextuality is found. Secondly, a careful analysis of\npreparation independence, one of the key assumptions of the PBR theorem, leads\nto a precise analogy with the kind of locality prohibited by Bell's theorem.\nMotivated by this, we propose a weakening of the assumption to something\nanalogous to no-signalling. This amounts to allowing global or non-local\ncorrelations in the joint ontic state, which nevertheless do not allow for\nsuperluminal signalling. This is, at least, consistent with the Bell and\nKochen-Specker theorems. We find a counter-example to the PBR argument, which\nviolates preparation independence, but does satisfy this physically motivated\nassumption. The question of whether the PBR result can be strengthened to hold\nunder the relaxed assumption is therefore posed.\n","Comment: In Proceedings QPL 2014, arXiv:1412.8102"]}]

This feature\narises by fluorescence when the accretion disc is illuminated by hot corona\nabove it. Due to central location of the corona the illumination and thus also\nthe line emission decrease with radius. It was reported in the literature that\nthis decrease is very steep in some of the sources, suggesting a highly compact\ncorona.\n  We revisit the lamp-post setup in which the corona is positioned on the axis\nabove the rotating black hole and investigate to what extent the steep\nemissivity can be explained by this scenario. We show the contributions of the\nrelativistic effects to the disc illumination by the primary source - energy\nshift, light bending and aberration. The lamp-post radial illumination pattern\nis compared to the widely used radial broken power-law emissivity profile. We\nfind that very steep emissivities require the primary illuminating source to be\npositioned very near the black hole horizon and/or the spectral power-law index\nof the primary emission to be very high. The broken power-law approximation of\nthe illumination can be safely used when the primary source is located at\nlarger heights. However, for low heights the lamp-post illumination\nconsiderably differs from this approximation.\n  We also show the variations of the iron line local flux over the disc due to\nthe flux dependence on incident and emission angles. The former depends mainly\non the height of the primary source while the latter depends on the inclination\nangle of the observer. Thus the strength of the line varies substantially\nacross the disc.

Firstly, we verify many advance properties of the general RKBSs\nsuch as density, continuity, implicit representation, imbedding, compactness,\nand representer theorems for learning methods. Next, we develop a new concept\nof generalized Mercer kernels to construct the $p$-norm RKBSs for $1\\leq\np\\leq\\infty$. The $p$-norm RKBSs preserve the same simple format as the Mercer\nrepresentation of RKHSs. Moreover, the p-norm RKBSs are isometrically\nequivalent to the standard p-norm spaces of countable sequences; hence the\n$p$-norm RKBSs possess more abundant geometrical structures than RKHSs\nincluding sparsity. To be more precise, the suitable countable expansion terms\nof the generalized Mercer kernels can be used to represent the pairs of\nSchauder bases and biorthogonal systems of the $p$-norm RKBSs such that the\ngeneralized Mercer kernels become the reproducing kernels of the $p$-norm\nRKBSs. The theory of the generalized Mercer kernels also cover many well-known\nkernels, for instance, min kernels, Gaussian kernels, and power series kernels.\nFinally, we propose to solve the support vector machines in the $p$-norm RKBSs,\nwhich are to minimize the regularized empirical risks over the $p$-norm RKBSs.\nWe show that the infinite-dimensional support vector machines in the $p$-norm\nRKBSs can be equivalently transferred into the finite dimensional convex\noptimization problems such that we can obtain the finite dimensional\nrepresentations of their support vector machine solutions for practical\napplications and computer programs. In particular, we verify that some typical\nsupport vector machines in the $1$-norm RKBSs are equivalent to the classical\n$1$-norm sparse regressions.\n","Comment: 111 pages and 2 figures"]}]

This difference is also reflected in the classical\nlimit: for the integrable case the stable fixed point in phase space suffers a\nbifurcation of Hopf type whereas for the second one a pitchfork type\nbifurcation has been reported.\n"]}]

First, within the two-mode\napproximation, we demonstrate that a Schrodinger cat-like can be dynamically\ngenerated and, by controlling the Josephson-like coupling strength, the number\nof coherent states in the superposition can be varied. Later, we analyze\nnumerically the dynamics of the whole system when interspecies collisions are\ninhibited. Variables such as fractional population, Mandel parameter and\nvariances of annihilation and number operators are used to show that the\nevolved state is entangled and exhibits sub-Poisson statistics.\n"]}]
