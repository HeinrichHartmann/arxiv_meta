Using a sample of eight different cold nuclear\nphysics equations of state, we have computed models of maximum field strength,\nas well as the distortion coefficients for the surface and the quadrupolar\ndeformations. Surprisingly, we find that non-rotating models admit arbitrary\nlevels of magnetization, accompanied by a growth of size and quadrupole\ndistortion to which we could not find a limit. Rotating models, on the other\nhand, are subject to a mass-shedding limit at frequencies well below the\ncorresponding ones for unmagnetized stars. Overall, the space of solutions can\nbe split into three distinct classes for which the surface deformation and the\nquadrupole distortion are either prolate and prolate, oblate and prolate, or\noblate and oblate, respectively. We also derive a simple formula expressing the\nrelativistic distortion coefficients, which allows one to compute the surface\ndeformation and the quadrupole distortion up to significant levels of rotation\nand magnetization, essentially covering all known magnetars. Such a formula\nreplaces Newtonian equivalent expressions that overestimate the magnetic\nquadrupole distortion by about a factor of 6 and are inadequate for strongly\nrelativistic objects like neutron stars.\n","Comment: Published version with additional correction of remaining typos"]}]

For information transmission,\nwe consider two types of multiple access schemes, namely, time division\nmultiple access (TDMA) and orthogonal frequency division multiple access\n(OFDMA). At the receiver side, due to the practical limitation that circuits\nfor harvesting energy from radio signals are not yet able to decode the carried\ninformation directly, each user applies either time switching (TS) or power\nsplitting (PS) to coordinate the energy harvesting (EH) and information\ndecoding (ID) processes. For the TDMA-based information transmission, we employ\nTS at the receivers; for the OFDMA-based information transmission, we employ PS\nat the receivers. Under the above two scenarios, we address the problem of\nmaximizing the weighted sum-rate over all users by varying the time/frequency\npower allocation and either TS or PS ratio, subject to a minimum harvested\nenergy constraint on each user as well as a peak and/or total transmission\npower constraint. For the TS scheme, by an appropriate variable transformation\nthe problem is reformulated as a convex problem, for which the optimal power\nallocation and TS ratio are obtained by the Lagrange duality method. For the PS\nscheme, we propose an iterative algorithm to optimize the power allocation,\nsubcarrier (SC) allocation and the PS ratio for each user. The performances of\nthe two schemes are compared numerically as well as analytically for the\nspecial case of single-user setup. It is revealed that the peak power\nconstraint imposed on each OFDM SC as well as the number of users in the system\nplay a key role in the rate-energy performance comparison by the two proposed\nschemes.\n","Comment: submitted for possible journal publication"]}]

However, in general, this result requires to precode the data bearing\nsignals over a signal space of asymptotically large diversity, e.g., over an\ninfinite number of dimensions for time-frequency varying fading channels, or\nover an infinite number of rationally independent signal levels, in the case of\ntime-frequency invariant channels. In this work we consider a wireless cellular\nsystem scenario where the promised optimal DoFs are achieved with linear\nprecoding in one-shot (i.e., over a single time-frequency slot). We focus on\nthe uplink of a symmetric cellular system, where each cell is split into three\nsectors with orthogonal intra-sector multiple access. In our model,\ninterference is \"local\", i.e., it is due to transmitters in neighboring cells\nonly. We consider a message-passing backhaul network architecture, in which\nnearby sectors can exchange already decoded messages and propose an alignment\nsolution that can achieve the optimal DoFs. To avoid signaling schemes relying\non the strength of interference, we further introduce the notion of\n\\emph{topologically robust} schemes, which are able to guarantee a minimum rate\n(or DoFs) irrespectively of the strength of the interfering links. Towards this\nend, we design an alignment scheme which is topologically robust and still\nachieves the same optimum DoFs.\n"]}]

This is indeed observed in some extrinsically enhanced\nmetal-poor stars, but not in all. An extensive study of intrinsically s-process\nenriched objects is essential for improving our knowledge of the AGB third\ndredge-up and associated s-process nucleosynthesis.

The low S/N in\nthe Pb line region made the result of our previous study inconclusive. We\nacquired additional data covering the region of the strongest Pb line. Methods:\nBy carefully complementing re-reduced previous data, with newly acquired UVES\noptical spectra, we improve the S/N of the spectrum around the strongest Pb\nline. Therefore, an upper limit for the Pb abundance is estimated from a merged\nweighted mean spectrum using synthetic spectral modeling. We then compare the\nabundance results from the combined spectra to predictions of tailored AGB\nevolutionary models from two independent evolution codes.

We characterize the sample of known and\ncandidate FUORS in an homogeneous and consistent way, deriving stellar and\ncircumstellar parameters for each object. We emphasize the analysis in those\nparameters that are supposed to vary during the FUORS stage. We modeled the\nSEDs of 24 of the 26 currently known FUORS, using the radiative transfer code\nof Whitney et al (2003b). We compare our models with those obtained by\nRobitaille et al. (2007) for Taurus class II and I sources in quiescence\nperiods, by calculating the cumulative distribution of the different\nparameters. FUORS have more massive disks: we find that $\\sim80\\%$ of the disks\nin FUORS are more massive than any Taurus class II and I sources in the sample.\nMedian values for the disk mass accretion rates are ~ 1.e-7 Msun/yr vs ~ 1.e-5\nMsun/yr for standard YSOs (young stellar objects) and FUORS, respectively.\nWhile the distributions of envelope mass accretion rates for class I FUORS and\nfor standard class I objects are similar, FUORS, on average, have higher\nenvelope mass accretion rates than standard class II and class I sources. Most\nFUORS (~ 70%) have envelope mass accretion rates above 1.e-7 Msun/yr. In\ncontrast, 60% of the classical YSO sample have accretion rates below this\nvalue. Our results support the current scenario in which changes experimented\nby the circumstellar disk explain the observed properties of these stars.\nHowever, the increase in the disk mass accretion rate is smaller than\ntheoretically predicte (Frank et al. 1992; Hartmann & Kenyon 1996), though in\ngood agreement with previous determinations.\n","Comment: 66 pages with 27 figures and 6 tables.

We\nprovide in this paper a general version of a turnpike theorem, valuable for\nnonlinear dynamics without any specific assumption, and for very general\nterminal conditions. Not only the optimal trajectory is shown to remain\nexponentially close to a steady-state, but also the corresponding adjoint\nvector of the Pontryagin maximum principle. The exponential closedness is\nquantified with the use of appropriate normal forms of Riccati equations. We\nshow then how the property on the adjoint vector can be adequately used in\norder to initialize successfully a numerical direct method, or a shooting\nmethod. In particular, we provide an appropriate variant of the usual shooting\nmethod in which we initialize the adjoint vector, not at the initial time, but\nat the middle of the trajectory.\n"]}]
