One receives either n i.i.d. samples from a\ndistribution p in P or from a distribution q in Q and wants to decide from\nwhich set the points were sampled. It is known that the optimal exponential\nrate at which errors decrease can be achieved by a simple maximum-likelihood\nratio test which does not depend on p or q, but only on the sets P and Q.\n  We consider an adaptive generalization of this model where the choice of p in\nP and q in Q can change in each sample in some way that depends arbitrarily on\nthe previous samples. In other words, in the k'th round, an adversary, having\nobserved all the previous samples in rounds 1,...,k-1, chooses p_k in P and q_k\nin Q, with the goal of confusing the hypothesis test. We prove that even in\nthis case, the optimal exponential error rate can be achieved by a simple\nmaximum-likelihood test that depends only on P and Q.\n  We then show that the adversarial model has applications in hypothesis\ntesting for quantum states using restricted measurements. For example, it can\nbe used to study the problem of distinguishing entangled states from the set of\nall separable states using only measurements that can be implemented with local\noperations and classical communication (LOCC). The basic idea is that in our\nsetup, the deleterious effects of entanglement can be simulated by an adaptive\nclassical adversary.\n  We prove a quantum Stein's Lemma in this setting: In many circumstances, the\noptimal hypothesis testing rate is equal to an appropriate notion of quantum\nrelative entropy between two states.

We further propose a simple optimality measure and\nreveal the convergence rate of LADMPSAP in an ergodic sense. For programs with\nextra convex set constraints, with refined parameter estimation we devise a\npractical version of LADMPSAP for faster convergence. Finally, we generalize\nLADMPSAP to handle programs with more difficult objective functions by\nlinearizing part of the objective function as well. LADMPSAP is particularly\nsuitable for sparse representation and low-rank recovery problems because its\nsubproblems have closed form solutions and the sparsity and low-rankness of the\niterates can be preserved during the iteration.

A polymatroid is entropic if its rank function is given\nby the Shannon entropy of the subsets of some discrete random variables. The\nbook is a special iterated adhesive extension of a polymatroid with the\nproperty that entropic polymatroids have $n$-page book extensions over an\narbitrary spine. We prove that every polymatroid has an $n$-page book extension\nover a single element and over an all-but-one-element spine. Consequently, for\npolymatroids on four elements, only book extensions over a two-element spine\nshould be considered. F. Mat\\'{u}\\v{s} proved that the Zhang-Yeung inequalities\ncharacterize polymatroids on four elements which have such a 2-page book\nextension. The $n$-page book inequalities, defined in this paper, are\nconjectured to characterize polymatroids on four elements which have $n$-page\nbook extensions over a two-element spine. We prove that the condition is\nnecessary; consequently every book inequality is an information inequality on\nfour random variables. Using computer-aided multiobjective optimization, the\nsufficiency of the condition is verified up to 9-page book extensions.\n"]}]

We employ rapid purification in a rotating frame whose frequency is\nestimated and periodically updated via a Bayesian estimation scheme. The\nBayesian estimation protocol employs the continuous measurement record to\nimprove the estimate, which in turn purifies the qubit more. This procedure\nstabilizes the qubit. Such an adaptive measurement scheme serves the purpose of\npurifying the state, while minimally interfering with the phase estimation.\n","Comment: 5 pages, RevTeX4-1"]}]
