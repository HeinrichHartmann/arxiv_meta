To\nillustrate our theorem, first we define a noncommutative deformation of the\nZ/2Z-principal bundle $S^2\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}P^2$ that yields a piecewise\ntrivial principal comodule algebra. It is the C*-algebra of a quantum cube\nboundary whose each face is given by the Toeplitz algebra. The Z/2Z-invariant\nsubalgebra defines the C*-algebra of a quantum $\\mathbb{R}P^2$. It is given as\na triple-pullback of Toeplitz algebras. Next, we prolongate this noncommutative\nZ/2Z-principal bundle to a noncommutative U(1)-principal bundle, so that the\nformer becomes a reduction of the latter instantiating our theorem. Moreover,\nusing K-theory results, we prove that the prolongated noncommutative bundle is\nnot trivial.\n","Comment: 29 pages, one example removed into a different paper"]}]

Autocalibration\nenables the estimation of the camera parameters without using a calibration\ndevice, but by enforcing simple constraints on the camera parameters. In the\nabsence of information about the internal camera parameters such as the focal\nlength and the principal point, the knowledge of the camera pixel shape is\nusually the only available constraint. Given a projective reconstruction of a\nrigid scene, we address the problem of the autocalibration of a minimal set of\ncameras with known pixel shape and otherwise arbitrarily varying intrinsic and\nextrinsic parameters. We propose an algorithm that only requires 5 cameras (the\ntheoretical minimum), thus halving the number of cameras required by previous\nalgorithms based on the same constraint.

We\nshow that the set of solutions of the Euclidean upgrading problem for three\ncameras with known pixel shape can be parameterized in a computationally\nefficient way.

In college, we learned that there are much more than\nfour states of matter. For example, there are ferromagnetic states as revealed\nby the phenomenon of magnetization and superfluid states as defined by the\nphenomenon of zero-viscosity. The various phases in our colorful world are so\nrich that it is amazing that they can be understood systematically by the\nsymmetry breaking theory of Landau. In this paper, we will review the progress\nin last 20 -- 30 years, during which we discovered that there are even more\ninteresting phases that are beyond Landau symmetry breaking theory. We discuss\nnew \"topological\" phenomena, such as topological degeneracy, that reveal the\nexistence of those new phases - topologically ordered phases. Just like\nzero-viscosity defines the superfluid order, the new \"topological\" phenomena\ndefine the topological order at macroscopic level. As a new type of order,\ntopological order requires a new mathematical frame work, such as fusion\ncategory and group cohomology, to describe it. More recently, we find that, at\nmicroscopical level, topological order is due to long-range quantum\nentanglements, just like fermion superfluid is due to fermion-pair\ncondensation. Long-range quantum entanglements lead to many amazing emergent\nphenomena, such as fractional quantum numbers, fractional/non-Abelian\nstatistics, and perfect conducting boundary channels. Long-range quantum\nentanglements can even provide a unified origin of light and electrons (or more\ngenerally, gauge interactions and Fermi statistics): light waves (gauge fields)\nare fluctuations of long-range entanglements, and electrons (fermions) are\ndefects of long-range entanglements.\n","Comment: A gentle review of topological order. 43 pages 22 figures"]}]

This is a well known\nfinancial puzzle to explain, since assuming foreign exchange risk is\nuninhibited and the markets have rational risk-neutral investors, then one\nwould not expect profits from such strategies. That is uncovered interest rate\nparity (UIP), the parity condition in which exposure to foreign exchange risk,\nwith unanticipated changes in exchange rates, should result in an outcome that\nchanges in the exchange rate should offset the potential to profit from such\ninterest rate differentials. The two primary assumptions required for interest\nrate parity are related to capital mobility and perfect substitutability of\ndomestic and foreign assets. Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, the\ninterest rate parity condition implies that the expected return on domestic\nassets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted expected return on foreign\ncurrency assets.\n  However, it has been shown empirically, that investors can actually earn\narbitrage profits by borrowing in a country with a lower interest rate,\nexchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a\nhigher interest rate, whilst allowing for any losses (or gains) from exchanging\nback to their domestic currency at maturity. Therefore trading strategies that\naim to exploit the interest rate differentials can be profitable on average.\nThe intention of this paper is therefore to reinterpret the currency carry\ntrade puzzle in light of heavy tailed marginal models coupled with multivariate\ntail dependence features in the analysis of the risk-reward for the currency\nportfolios with high interest rate differentials and low interest rate\ndifferentials.\n"]}]

While global isometric matching is well\nunderstood, only a few heuristic solutions are known for partial matching.\nPartial matching is particularly important for robustness to topological noise\n(incomplete data and contacts), which is a common problem in real-world 3D\nscanner data. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to partial, intrinsic\nisometric matching.

From this\nidea, we develop a new representation for partial isometric maps based on\nequivalence classes of correspondences between pairs of points and their\ntangent spaces. From this, we derive a local propagation algorithm that find\nsuch mappings efficiently. In contrast to previous heuristics based on RANSAC\nor expectation maximization, our method is based on a simple and sound\ntheoretical model and fully deterministic.

Here, we study generally covariant metric-torsion theories of gravity\npresented more concretely, setting that their Lagrangians are \\emph{manifestly}\ngenerally covariant scalars. It is assumed that Lagrangians depend on metric\ntensor, curvature tensor, torsion tensor and its first and second covariant\nderivatives, besides, on an arbitrary set of other tensor (matter) fields and\ntheir first and second covariant derivatives. Thus, both the standard minimal\ncoupling with the Riemann-Cartan geometry and non-minimal coupling with the\ncurvature and torsion tensors are considered.\n  The studies and results are as follow. (a) A physical interpretation of the\nNoether and Klein identities is examined. It was found that they are the basis\nfor constructing equations of balance of energy-momentum tensors of various\ntypes (canonical, metrical and Belinfante symmetrized). The equations of\nbalance are presented. (b) Using the generalized equations of balance, new\n(generalized) manifestly generally covariant expressions for canonical\nenergy-momentum and spin tensors of the matter fields are constructed. In the\ncases, when the matter Lagrangian contains both the higher derivatives and\nnon-minimal coupling with curvature and torsion, such generalizations are\nnon-trivial.

However, it was an open\nquestion whether or not the exact wave equations can admit them in finite water\ndepth. Besides, it was traditionally believed that cusped solitary waves, whose\n1st-derivative tends to infinity at crest, are essentially different from\npeaked solitary ones with finite 1st-derivative. Currently, based on the\nsymmetry and the exact water wave equations, Liao [1] proposed a unified wave\nmodel (UWM) for progressive gravity waves in finite water depth. The UWM admits\nnot only all traditional smooth progressive waves but also the peaked solitary\nwaves in finite water depth: in other words, the peaked solitary progressive\nwaves are consistent with the traditional smooth ones. In this paper, in the\nframe of the linearized UWM, we further give, for the first time, the cusped\nsolitary waves in finite water depth, and besides reveal a close relationship\nbetween the cusped and peaked solitary waves: a cusped solitary wave is consist\nof an infinite number of peaked solitary ones with the same phase speed, so\nthat it can be regarded as a special peaked solitary wave. This also well\nexplains why and how a cuspon has an infinite 1st-derivative at crest. It is\nfound that, like peaked solitary waves, the vertical velocity of a cusped\nsolitary wave in finite water depth is also discontinuous at crest (x=0), and\nespecially its phase speed has nothing to do with wave height, too. In\naddition, it is unnecessary to consider whether the peaked/cusped solitary\nwaves given by the UWM are weak solution or not, since the governing equation\nis not necessary to be satisfied at crest. All of these would deepen and enrich\nour understandings about the cusped solitary waves.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 2 figures"]}]

The primary goal of the research work is to counter balance the\nperilous impact of non-relevant songs through Progressive Filtering (PF) for\nQuery by Humming (QBH) system. PF is a technique of problem solving through\nreduced space. This paper presents the concept of PF and its efficient design\nbased on Multi-Resolution Histograms (MRH) to accomplish searching in\nmanifolds. Initially the entire music database is searched to obtain high\nrecall rate and narrowed search space. Later steps accomplish slow search in\nthe reduced periphery and achieve additional accuracy.\n  Experimentation on large music database using recursive programming\nsubstantiates the potential of the method. The outcome of proposed strategy\nglimpses that MRH effectively locate the patterns. Distances of MRH at lower\nlevel are the lower bounds of the distances at higher level, which guarantees\nevasion of false dismissals during PF. In due course, proposed method helps to\nstrike a balance between efficiency and effectiveness. The system is scalable\nfor large music retrieval systems and also data driven for performance\noptimization as an added advantage.\n","Comment: 12 Pages, 6 Figures, Full version of the paper published at\n  ICMCCA-2012 with the same title,\n  Link:http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-81-322-1143-3_21"]}]

To date, a wide variety of approaches to\ngeo-semantic similarity have been devised. A judgment of similarity is not\nintrinsically right or wrong, but obtains a certain degree of cognitive\nplausibility, depending on how closely it mimics human behavior. Thus selecting\nthe most appropriate measure for a specific task is a significant challenge. To\naddress this issue, we make an analogy between computational similarity\nmeasures and soliciting domain expert opinions, which incorporate a subjective\nset of beliefs, perceptions, hypotheses, and epistemic biases. Following this\nanalogy, we define the semantic similarity ensemble (SSE) as a composition of\ndifferent similarity measures, acting as a panel of experts having to reach a\ndecision on the semantic similarity of a set of geographic terms. The approach\nis evaluated in comparison to human judgments, and results indicate that an SSE\nperforms better than the average of its parts. Although the best member tends\nto outperform the ensemble, all ensembles outperform the average performance of\neach ensemble's member. Hence, in contexts where the best measure is unknown,\nthe ensemble provides a more cognitively plausible approach.\n","Comment: Special feature on Semantic and Conceptual Issues in GIS (SeCoGIS)"]}]

The CSCP system\npredicts the correlation(s) among primary disease (the disease for which the\npatient visits the doctor) and secondary disease/s (which is/are other\nassociated disease/s carried by the same patient having the primary disease).\n","Comment: 5 pages, MEDINFO 2010, C.

We propose the \"participant\" concept to encourage elder people\nto participate in those group activities that they are able to. Their roles in\nthese activities are not passively requesting help, but actively participating\nto some healthcare processes. Characteristics of the participant approach are\nthat medical resources are efficiently spared with this model, and the social\nnetwork of the elder people is kept. A \"virtual community\" for mutual\nassistance is set up in this paper, and the simulations demonstrate that the\n\"participant\" model could fully utilize the community resources. Furthermore,\nthe psychological health of the elder people will be improved.\n","Comment: Twentieth IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical\n  Systems, 2007. CBMS '07"]}]

In the\nevolution leading up to the eruption, and for some time after it, a\ncounter-clockwise rotation of the sunspot of about 30 degrees was observed. We\nsuggest that the rotation triggered the eruption by progressively expanding the\nmagnetic field above the filament. To test this scenario, we study the effect\nof twisting the initially potential field overlying a pre-existing flux-rope,\nusing three-dimensional zero-$\\beta$ MHD simulations. We first consider a\nrelatively simple and symmetric system, and then study a more complex and\nasymmetric magnetic configuration, whose photospheric flux distribution and\ncoronal structure are guided by the observations and a potential field\nextrapolation. In both cases, we find that the twisting leads to the expansion\nof the overlying field. As a consequence of the progressively reduced magnetic\ntension, the flux-rope quasi-statically adapts to the changed environmental\nfield, rising slowly. Once the tension is sufficiently reduced, a distinct\nsecond phase of evolution occurs where the flux-rope enters an unstable regime\ncharacterized by a strong acceleration.

The\nmain result is the surprising fact that, in the $p$-adic framework, a function\nis solution of a differential equation if and only if it is solution of a\n$q$-difference equation. This fact implies an equivalence, called\n``Confluence'', between the category of differential equations and those of\n$q$-difference equations. We obtain this result by introducing a category of\n``sheaves'' on the disk $\\mathrm{D}^-(1,1)$, whose stalk at 1 is a differential\nequation, the stalk at $q$ is a $q$-difference equation if $q$ is not a root of\nunity $\\xi$, and the stalk at a root of unity is a mixed object, formed by a\ndifferential equation and an action of $\\sigma_\\xi$.\n","Comment: 43 pages"]}]
