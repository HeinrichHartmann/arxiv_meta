It is thus important to\nlearn which statistical changes in the input do, and which do not, invoke\nadaptive responses, and ask about the reasons for potential limits to\nadaptation. We measured the ganglion cell responses in the tiger salamander\nretina to controlled changes in the second (contrast), third (skew) and fourth\n(kurtosis) moments of the light intensity distribution of spatially uniform\ntemporally independent stimuli. The skew and kurtosis of the stimuli were\nchosen to cover the range observed in natural scenes. We quantified adaptation\nin ganglion cells by studying two-dimensional linear-nonlinear models that\ncapture well the retinal encoding properties across all stimuli. We found that\nthe retinal ganglion cells adapt to contrast, but exhibit remarkably invariant\nbehavior to changes in higher-order statistics. Finally, by theoretically\nanalyzing optimal coding in LN-type models, we showed that the neural code can\nmaintain a high information rate without dynamic adaptation despite changes in\nstimulus skew and kurtosis.\n"]}]

Even without symmetry breaking, the bosons can\nstill be in many exotic new states of matter, such as symmetry-protected\ntrivial (SPT) phases which are short-range entangled and symmetry-enriched\ntopological (SET) phases which are long-range entangled. It is well-known that\nnon-interacting fermionic topological insulators are SPT states protected by\ntime-reversal symmetry and U(1) fermion number conservation symmetry. In this\npaper, we construct three-dimensional exotic phases of bosons with\ntime-reversal symmetry and boson number conservation U(1) symmetry by means of\nfermionic projective construction. We first construct an algebraic bosonic\ninsulator which is a symmetric bosonic state with an emergent U(1) gapless\ngauge field. We then obtain many gapped bosonic states that do not break the\ntime-reversal symmetry and boson number conservation via proper dyon\ncondensations. We identify the constructed states by calculating the allowed\nelectric and magnetic charges of their excitations, as well as the statistics\nand the symmetric transformation properties of those excitations. This allows\nus to show that our constructed states can be trivial SPT states (i.e. trivial\nMott insulators of bosons with symmetry), non-trivial SPT states (i.e. bosonic\ntopological insulators) and SET states (i.e. fractional bosonic topological\ninsulators). In non-trivial SPT states, the elementary monopole (carrying zero\nelectric charge but unit magnetic charge) and elementary dyon (carrying both\nunit electric charge and unit magnetic charge) are fermionic and bosonic,\nrespectively.

In this paper, we study the properties of correlated MIMO\nmultiple-access channels in the presence of external interference. Using the\nreplica method from statistical physics, we derive the ergodic sum-rate of the\ncommunication for arbitrary signal constellations when the numbers of antennas\nat both ends of the channel grow large. Based on these asymptotic expressions,\nwe also address the problem of sum-rate maximization using statistical channel\ninformation and linear precoding. The numerical results demonstrate that when\nthe interfering terminals use discrete constellations, the resulting\ninterference becomes easier to handle compared to Gaussian signals. Thus, it\nmay be possible to accommodate more interfering transmitter-receiver pairs\nwithin the same area as compared to the case of Gaussian signals. In addition,\nwe demonstrate numerically for the Gaussian and QPSK signaling schemes that it\nis possible to design precoder matrices that significantly improve the\nachievable rates at low-to-mid range of signal-to-noise ratios when compared to\nisotropic precoding.\n","Comment: To appear in IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications"]}]

To be specific, grain to grain sliding under dry or wet\ncondition is idealized and appears as a simple contact law embedded in a\ncontinuum framework.

Consequently, a\nbound on the size of such a code can be obtained from bounds on the matching\nnumber of a hypergraph.

In the second case, we\nallow the campaigner to adjust the effective spreading rate by incentivizing\nthe infected in the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, in addition to\nthe direct recruitment. We consider time varying information spreading rate in\nour formulation to model the changing interest level of individuals in the\ncampaign, as the deadline is reached. In both the cases, we show the existence\nof a solution and its uniqueness for sufficiently small campaign deadlines. For\nthe fixed spreading rate, we show the effectiveness of the optimal control\nstrategy against the constant control strategy, a heuristic control strategy\nand no control. We show the sensitivity of the optimal control to the spreading\nrate profile when it is time varying.\n","Comment: Proofs for Theorems 4.2 and 5.2 which do not appear in the published\n  journal version are included in this version.

One of these is how to generate representative wave functions for\nground states on other geometries than the planar and spherical. We study one\nsuch geometry, the toroidal one, where the periodic boundary conditions must be\nproperly taken into account.\n  As a tool to study the torus we investigate the properties of various types\nof localized states, similar to the coherent states of the harmonic oscillator,\nwhich are maximally localized in phase space. We consider two alternative\ndefinitions of localized states in the lowest Landau level (LLL) on a torus.\nOne is the projection of the coordinate delta function onto the LLL. Another\ndefinition, proposed by Haldane & Rezayi, is to consider the set of functions\nwhich have all their zeros at a single point. Since all LLL wave functions on a\ntorus, are uniquely defined by the position of their zeros, this defines a set\nof functions that are expected to be localized around the point maximally far\naway from the zeros.\n  These two families of localized states have many properties in common with\nthe coherent states on the plane and on the sphere, e.g. a simple resolution of\nunity and a simple self-reproducing kernel. However, we show that only the\nprojected delta function is maximally localized.\n  We find that because of modular covariance, there are severe restrictions on\nwhich wave functions that are acceptable on the torus. As a result, we can\nwrite down a trial wave function for the $\\nu=\\frac{2}{5}$ state, that respects\nthe modular covariance, and has good numerical overlap with the exact coulomb\nground state.\n  Finally we present preliminary calculations of the antisymmetric component of\nthe viscosity tensor for the proposed, modular covariant, $\\nu=\\frac{2}{5}$\nstate, and find that it is in agreement with theoretical predictions.\n","Comment: Licentiate Thesis by Mikael Fremling, May 2014 at Stockholm\n  University"]}]

Requirement of very little human\nintervention is one of the most desirable features of WSNs, thus making it a\ncheaper and safer alternative for securing large areas such as international\nborders. Jamming attacks in WSNs can be applied to disrupt communications among\nthe sensor nodes in the network. Since it is difficult to prevent jamming\nattacks, detection and mapping out the jammed regions is critical to overcome\nthis problem. In a security monitoring scenario, the network operators will be\nable to take proper measures against jamming once the jammed regions in the\nnetwork are known to them.

Our results generalise this uniformization. The proof closely\nfollows the ideas of Rapoport--Zink. In particular, analogies of $p$-divisible\ngroups play an important role. As a crucial intermediate step we prove that in\na family of abelian sheaves with good reduction at infinity, the set of points\nwhere the abelian sheaf is uniformizable in the sense of Anderson, is formally\nclosed.\n","Comment: Final version, appears in \"Number Fields and Function Fields - Two\n  Parallel Worlds\", Papers from the 4th Conference held on Texel Island, April\n  2004, edited by G. van der Geer, B.

It is an interesting\nquestion, and the main objective of the present article to see how\nuniformizability behaves in families. Since uniformizability is an analytic\nnotion, we have to work with families over a rigid analytic base. We provide\nmany basic results, and in fact a large part of this article concentrates on\nlaying foundations for studying the above question.
