We find that the degree of condensation,defined as the relative change of\nthe saturated water vapor mixing ratio in the region of condensation, is a\nmajor factor determining Hp. We estimate from theory that the mean large-scale\nrate of frictional dissipation associated with total precipitation in the\ntropics lies between 1 and 2 W m-2 and show that our estimate is supported by\nempirical evidence. We show that under terrestrial conditions frictional\ndissipation constitutes a minor fraction of the dynamic power of\ncondensation-induced atmospheric circulation,which is estimated to be at least\n2.5 times larger. However,because Hp increases with surface temperature Ts, the\nrate of frictional dissipation would exceed that of condensation-induced\ndynamics, and thus block major circulation, at Ts >~320 K in a moist adiabatic\natmosphere.\n","Comment: 12 pp, 2 figures"]}]

Interference of Josephson currents through two tunnel junctions\nconnected in parallel was achieved one year later leading to the first ever\nsuperconducting quantum interferometer. The latter, together with Rowell's\nobservations, constituted the unequivocal demonstration of the Josephson\nsupercurrent-phase relation. Yet, the Josephson effect has further profound\nimplications going beyond electrical transport, as the interplay between the\nCooper condensate and unpaired electrons provides thermal flow through the\njunction with phase coherence as well. Here we report the first demonstration\nof quantum diffraction of a heat flux showing that a temperature-biased single\nJosephson junction is exploited as a diffractor for thermal currents.\nSpecifically, thermal diffraction manifests itself with a peculiar modulation\nof the electron temperature in a small metallic electrode nearby-contacted to\nthe junction when sweeping the magnetic flux $\\Phi$.

These binary asteroids have wide semi-major\naxes relative to most near-Earth and Main Belt asteroid systems. Confirmed\nmembers have rapidly rotating primaries and satellites that are not tidally\nlocked. Previously suggested formation mechanisms from impact ejecta, planetary\nflybys and directly from rotational fission events cannot satisfy all of the\nobservations. The newly hypothesized mechanism works as follows: (i) these\nsystems are formed from rotational fission, (ii) their satellites are tidally\nlocked, (iii) their orbits are expanded by the BYORP effect, (iv) their\nsatellites de-synchronize due to the adiabatic invariance between the libration\nof the secondary and the mutual orbit, and (v) the secondary avoids\nresynchronization due to the the YORP effect. This seemingly complex chain of\nevents is a natural pathway for binaries with satellites that have particular\nshapes, which define the BYORP effect torque that acts on the system. After\ndetailing the theory, we analyze each of the wide asynchronous binary members\nand candidates to assess their most likely formation mechanism.

Towards this end, major progress was recently made with the\nintroduction of highly resistive Bi$_2$Te$_2$Se, in which surface state\nconductance and quantum oscillations are observed at low temperatures.\nNevertheless, an unresolved and pivotal question remains: while room\ntemperature ARPES studies reveal clear evidence of TI surface states, their\nobservation in transport experiments is limited to low temperatures. A better\nunderstanding of this surface state suppression at elevated temperatures is of\nfundamental interest, and crucial for pushing the boundary of device\napplications towards room-temperature operation.

Important phenomena that cannot be revealed\ninclude non-negligible variance and bi-modal population distributions. A\nless-known approximation proposed by Kurtz applies stochastic differential\nequations (SDEs) and provides information about the stochastic nature of the\nprocess. In this paper we apply and extend this diffusion approximation to\nstudy stochastic Petri nets. We identify a class of nets whose underlying\nstochastic process is a density dependent Markov chain whose indexing parameter\nis a multiplicative constant which identifies the population level expressed by\nthe initial marking and we provide means to automatically construct the\nassociated set of SDEs. Since the diffusion approximation of Kurtz considers\nthe process only up to the time when it first exits an open interval, we extend\nthe approximation by a machinery that mimics the behavior of the Markov chain\nat the boundary and allows thus to apply the approach to a wider set of\nproblems. The resulting process is of the jump-diffusion type. We illustrate by\nexamples that the jump-diffusion approximation which extends to bounded domains\ncan be much more informative than that based on ODEs as it can provide accurate\nquantity distributions even when they are multi-modal and even for relatively\nsmall population levels.

Lindzen and Nigam (1987) noted that sea level pressure (SLP) gradients\nare proportional to surface temperature gradients if isobaric height (the\nheight where pressure does not vary in the horizontal plane) is constant; their\nown model of low-level circulation assumed that isobaric height in the tropics\nis around 3 km.

Observations show that isobaric height is\ntoo variable to determine a universal spatial or temporal relationship between\nlocal values of air temperature and SLP. Since isobaric height cannot be\ndetermined from independent considerations, the relationship between SLP and\ntemperature is not evidence that differential heating drives low-level\ncirculation. An alternative theory suggests SLP gradients are determined by the\ncondensation of water vapor as moist air converges towards the equator. This\ntheory quantifies the meridional SLP differences observed by season across the\nHadley cells reasonably well. Higher temperature of surface air where SLP is\nlow may be determined by equatorward transport and release of latent heat below\nthe trade wind inversion layer.

In the case of General Relativity, this problem is under study since\nthe theory was published. Several methods have been developed and different\napproaches are avalaible in the literature to interpret the relativistic\ncontributions in the motion under gravity influence. The main goal in this\nthesis is to study a general method to face the equation of motion for extended\nbodies in General Relativity. We started with a proposal in the Newtonian\ntheory, which consists in a multipolar expansion for the gravitational\npotentials as a function of the mass density moments and other physical\nvariables as the stress tensor. The methodology give us the equation of motion\nfor an isolated and self-gravitating system of extended bodies in Newtonian\nmechanics. A geometrical approach to get the equation of motion is also used\nfor the Newtonian problems, it allows us to extend the methodology to General\nRelativity. In General Relativity, some new concepts are necessary: world tube,\nworld line, generalized ideas of momentum, angular momentum, torque and center\nof mass are introduced in a general context. General expressions for the\nequation of motion in the case of extended bodies are written without any\nrestriction. In order to gain some physical understanding, we compute the\nPapapetrous's equation of motion for a test extended body in a static and\nisotropic metric. Finally, we study a system of two extended bodies in the\npost-Newtonian approximation. We define the mass multipole moments and momentum\nfrom the gravitational potentials (metric functions) to the first\npost-Newtonian order. We follow the Landau-Liftshitz formalism to find out the\nequation of motion for the moments and applying the standard coordinate\ntransformation for this theory, we write the traslational equation of motion.\n","Comment: M.Sc.

However, there also exist critical utility thresholds beyond which\ndistinguished players are no longer able to percolate.
