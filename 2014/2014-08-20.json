Phys. Cond. Matter {\\bf\n16}, 8025 (2004)] approaches to quantum transport for the average current, the\nentanglement entropy and the semiclassical full-counting statistics (FCS). Our\nfocus is on the applicability of these approaches to isolated quantum systems\nsuch as ultra-cold atoms in engineered optical potentials. For two lattices\nconnected by a junction, we find that the current and particle number\nfluctuations from the microcanonical approach compare well with the values\npredicted by the Landauer formalism and FCS assuming a binomial distribution.\nHowever, we demonstrate that well-defined reservoirs (i.e., particles in\nFermi-Dirac distributions) are not present for a substantial duration of the\nquasi-steady state. Thus, the Landauer assumption of reservoirs and/or\ninelastic effects is not necessary for establishing a quasi-steady state.\nMaintaining such a state indefinitely requires an infinite system, and in this\nlimit well-defined Fermi-Dirac distributions can occur. A Kubo approach -- in\nthe spirit of the microcanonical picture -- bridges the gap between the two\nformalisms, giving explicit analytical expressions for the formation of the\nsteady state. The microcanonical formalism is designed for closed, finite-size\nquantum systems and is thus more suitable for studying particle dynamics in\nultra-cold atoms. Our results highlight both the connection and differences\nwith more traditional approaches to calculating transport properties in\ncondensed matter systems, and will help guide the way to their simulations in\ncold-atom systems.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 15 figures"]}]
