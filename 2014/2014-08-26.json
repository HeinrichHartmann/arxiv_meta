A recent work by Makarov (2012) has demonstrated that\ntrapping into this resonance is certain if the eccentricity is larger than 0.2,\nprovided that we use a realistic tidal model, the one which is based on the\nDarwin-Kaula expansion of the tidal torque. The physics-based tidal model\nchanges dramatically the statistics of the possible final spin states. First,\nwe discover that after only one encounter with the spin-orbit 3:2 resonance\nthis resonance becomes the most probable end-state. Second, if a capture into\nthis (or any other) resonance takes place, the capture becomes final, several\ncrossings of the same state being forbidden by our model. Third, within our\nmodel the trapping of Mercury happens much faster than previously believed: for\nmost histories, 10 - 20 Myr are sufficient. Fourth, even a weak laminar\nfriction between the solid mantle and a molten core would most likely result in\na capture in the 2:1 or even higher resonance. So the principal novelty of our\npaper is that the 3:2 end-state is more ancient than the same end-state\nobtained when the constant time lag model is employed. The swift capture\njustifies our treatment of Mercury as a homogeneous, unstratified body whose\nliquid core had not yet formed by the time of trapping. We also provide a\ncritical analysis of the hypothesis by Wieczorek et al. (2012) that the early\nMercury might had been retrograde, whereafter it synchronised its spin and then\naccelerated it to the 3:2 resonance. Accurate processing of the available data\non cratering does not support that hypothesis, while the employment of a\nrealistic rheology invalidates a key element of the hypothesis, an intermediate\npseudosynchronous state needed to spin-up to the 3:2 resonance.\n","Comment: Extended version of the submitted paper, accepted for publication in\n  Icarus"]}]

Both\nindirect and direct metallicity measurements of 13 BSG SN host galaxies are\npresented, and compared to those of other CC SN types. Indirect measurements\nare based on the known luminosity-metallicity relation and on published\nmetallicity gradients of spiral galaxies.

Both parameters do not correlate with line-of-sight velocity\ndifference dV of galaxies. Dp and P are better measures of interaction strength\nthan dV. The latter correlates with the density of large-scale environment and\nwith the morphologies of galaxies. Both galaxies in a pair are of the same\nnature, the only difference is that MRK galaxies are usually brighter than\ntheir neighbors in average by 0.9 mag. Specific star formation rates (SSFR) of\ngalaxies in pairs with smaller Dp or dV is in average 0.5 dex higher than that\nof galaxies in pairs with larger Dp or dV. Closeness of a neighbor with the\nsame and later morphological type increases the SSFR, while earlier-type\nneighbors do not increase SSFR. Major interactions/mergers trigger SF and AGN\nmore effectively than minor ones. The fraction of AGNs is higher in more\nperturbed pairs and pairs with smaller Dp.

A prominent example is non-locality. Non-local\ncorrelations cannot be explained, in classical terms, by shared information but\nonly by communication. On the other hand, the phenomenon does not allow for\n(potentially faster-than-light) message transmission. The fact that some\nnon-local and non-signaling correlations are predicted by quantum theory,\nwhereas others fail to be, asks for a criterion, as simple as possible, that\ncharacterizes which joint input-output behaviors are ``quantum'' and which are\nnot. In the context of the derivation of such criteria, it is of central\nimportance to understand when non-local correlations can be amplified by a\nnon-interactive protocol, i.e., whether some types of weak non-locality can be\ndistilled into stronger by local operations. Since it has been recognized that\nthe searched-for criteria must inherently be multi-partite, the question of\ndistillation, extensively studied and understood two-party scenarios, should be\nadressed in the multi-user setting, where much less is known. Considering the\nspace of intrinsically n-partite correlations, we show the possibility of\ndistilling weak non-local boxes to the algebraically maximal ones without any\ncommunication.

It has also been claimed that the resulting Z(M,SFR)\nrelation is invariant with redshift - the so-called Fundamental Metallicity\nRelation (FMR). Given a number of difficulties in determining metallicities,\nespecially at higher redshifts, the form of the Z(M,SFR) relation and whether\nit is really independent of redshift is still very controversial. To explore\nthis issue at z>2, we used VLT-SINFONI and Subaru-MOIRCS near-infrared\nspectroscopy of 20 zCOSMOS-deep galaxies at 2.1<z<2.5 to measure the strengths\nof up to five emission lines: [OII], Hbeta, [OIII], Halpha, and [NII]. This\nnear-infrared spectroscopy enables us to derive O/H metallicities, and also\nSFRs from extinction corrected Halpha measurements. We find that the\nmass-metallicity relation (MZR) of these star-forming galaxies at z~2.3 is\nlower than the local SDSS MZR by a factor of three to five, a larger change\nthan found by Erb et al. (2006) using [NII]/Halpha-based metallicities from\nstacked spectra. We discuss how the different selections of the samples and\nmetallicity calibrations used may be responsible for this discrepancy. The\ngalaxies show direct evidence that the SFR is still a second parameter in the\nmass-metallicity relation at these redshifts. However, determining whether the\nZ(M,SFR) relation is invariant with epoch depends on the choice of\nextrapolation used from local samples, because z>2 galaxies of a given mass\nhave much higher SFRs than the local SDSS galaxies. We find that the zCOSMOS\ngalaxies are consistent with a non-evolving FMR if we use the\nphysically-motivated formulation of the Z(M,SFR) relation from Lilly et al.\n(2003), but not if we use the empirical formulation of Mannucci et al.

Surprising\nphenomena appear, even in this minimal model, where the only control parameters\nare the numbers of each subgroup: $N_{I,E}$.

Different with the original J2 problem, the\ngravitational orbit-rotation coupling of the rigid body is considered in this\ngeneralized problem. The linear stability of the classical type of relative\nequilibria of the rigid body, which have been obtained in our previous paper,\nis studied in the framework of geometric mechanics with the second-order\ngravitational potential. Non-canonical Hamiltonian structure of the problem,\ni.e., Poisson tensor, Casimir functions and equations of motion, are obtained\nthrough a Poisson reduction process by means of the symmetry of the problem.\nThe linear system matrix at the relative equilibria is given through the\nmultiplication of the Poisson tensor and Hessian matrix of the variational\nLagrangian. Based on the characteristic equation of the linear system matrix,\nthe conditions of linear stability of the relative equilibria are obtained.\nWith the stability conditions obtained, the linear stability of the relative\nequilibria is investigated in details in a wide range of the parameters of the\ngravity field and the rigid body. We find that both the zonal harmonic J2 and\nthe characteristic dimension of the rigid body have significant effects on the\nlinear stability.

In this\nhovering model, both the position and attitude of the spacecraft are kept to be\nstationary in the asteroid body-fixed frame. A Hamiltonian structure-based\nfeedback control law is proposed to stabilize the relative equilibria of the\nfull dynamics to achieve the orbit-attitude hovering. The control law is\nconsisted of two parts: potential shaping and energy dissipation. The potential\nshaping is to make the relative equilibrium a minimum of the modified\nHamiltonian on the invariant manifold by modifying the potential artificially.\nWith the energy-Casimir method, it is shown that the unstable relative\nequilibrium can always be stabilized in the Lyapunov sense by the potential\nshaping with sufficiently large feedback gains. Then the energy dissipation\nleads the motion to converge asymptotically to the minimum of the modified\nHamiltonian on the invariant manifold, i.e., the relative equilibrium. The\nfeasibility of the proposed stabilization control law is validated through\nnumerical simulations in the case of a spacecraft orbiting around a small\nasteroid. The main advantage of the proposed hovering control law is that it is\nvery simple and is easy to implement autonomously by the spacecraft with little\ncomputation. This advantage is attributed to the utilization of dynamical\nbehaviors of the system in the control design.\n","Comment: The 24th AAS/AIAA Space Flight Mechanics Meeting, AAS 14-352, Santa\n  Fe, New Mexico, January 26-30, 2014"]}]

Thus, there have been many paradigms\ndeveloped to decrease the complexity of the de Bruijn graph. One obvious\ncombinatorial paradigm for this is to allow the value of $k$ to vary; having a\nlarger value of $k$ where the graph is more complex and a smaller value of $k$\nwhere the graph would likely contain fewer spurious edges and vertices. One\nopen problem that affects the practicality of this method is how to predict the\nvalue of $k$ prior to building the de Bruijn graph. We show that optimal values\nof $k$ can be predicted prior to assembly by using the information contained in\na phylogenetically-close genome and therefore, help make the use of multiple\nvalues of $k$ practical for genome assembly.\n  Results: We present HyDA-Vista, which is a genome assembler that uses\nhomology information to choose a value of $k$ for each read prior to the de\nBruijn graph construction. The chosen $k$ is optimal if there are no sequencing\nerrors and the coverage is sufficient. Fundamental to our method is the\nconstruction of the {\\em maximal sequence landscape}, which is a data structure\nthat stores for each position in the input string, the largest repeated\nsubstring containing that position. In particular, we show the maximal sequence\nlandscape can be constructed in $O(n + n \\log n)$-time and $O(n)$-space.\nHyDA-Vista first constructs the maximal sequence landscape for a homologous\ngenome. The reads are then aligned to this reference genome, and values of $k$\nare assigned to each read using the maximal sequence landscape and the\nalignments. Eventually, all the reads are assembled by an iterative de Bruijn\ngraph construction method.

In this context, we investigate whether it is possible to\nsynthesize a stabilizing event-triggered feedback law for networked control\nsystems (NCS) which have two time-scales, based only on an approximate model of\nthe slow dynamics. We follow an emulation-like approach as we assume that we\nknow how to solve the problem in the absence of sampling and then we study how\nto design the event-triggering rule under communication constraints. The NCS is\nmodeled as a hybrid singularly perturbed system which exhibits the feature to\ngenerate jumps for both the fast variable and the error variable induced by the\nsampling. The first conclusion is that a triggering law which guarantees the\nstability and the existence of a uniform minimum amount of time between two\ntransmissions for the slow model may not ensure the existence of such a time\nfor the overall system, which makes the controller not implementable in\npractice. The objective of this contribution is twofold. We first show that\nexisting event-triggering conditions can be adapted to singularly perturbed\nsystems and semiglobal practical stability can be ensured in this case. Second,\nwe propose another technique that combines event-triggered and time-triggered\nresults in the sense that transmissions are only allowed after a predefined\namount of time has elapsed since the last transmission. This technique has the\nadvantage, under an additional assumption, to ensure a global asymptotic\nstability property and to allow the user to directly tune the minimum\ninter-transmission interval.

Phys, \\textbf{136}, 124121], which\ndescribed a spin-adapted (SU(2) symmetry) density matrix renormalization group\n(DMRG) algorithm, to additionally utilize general non-Abelian point group\nsymmetries. A key strength of the present formulation is that the requisite\ntensor operators are not hard-coded for each symmetry group, but are instead\ngenerated on the fly using the appropriate Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. This\nallows our single implementation to easily enable (or disable) any non-Abelian\npoint group symmetry (including SU(2) spin symmetry). We use our implementation\nto compute the ground state potential energy curve of the C$_2$ dimer in the\ncc-pVQZ basis set (with a frozen-core), corresponding to a Hilbert space\ndimension of 10$^{12}$ many-body states. While our calculated energy lies\nwithin the 0.3 mE$_h$ error bound of previous initiator full configuration\ninteraction quantum Monte Carlo (i-FCIQMC) and correlation energy extrapolation\nby intrinsic scaling (CEEIS) calculations, our estimated residual error is only\n0.01 mE$_h$, much more accurate than these previous estimates. Further, due to\nthe additional efficiency afforded by the algorithm, we compute the potential\nenergy curves of twelve states: the three lowest levels for each of the\nirreducible representations $^1\\Sigma^+_g$, $^1\\Sigma^+_u$, $^1\\Sigma^-_g$ and\n$^1\\Sigma^-_u$, to an estimated accuracy within 0.1 mE$_h$ of the exact result\nin this basis.\n"]}]

High-level synthesis (HLS) raises the design abstraction from\nHDL to languages such as C/C++/Scala/Java. Despite this, in order to get a good\nquality of result (QoR), a designer must carefully craft the HLS code. In other\nwords, HLS designers must implement the application using an abstract language\nin a manner that generates an efficient micro-architecture; we call this\nprocess writing restructured code. This reduces the benefits of implementing\nthe application at a higher level of abstraction and limits the impact of HLS\nby requiring explicit knowledge of the underlying hardware architecture.\nDevelopers must know how to write code that reflects low level implementation\ndetails of the application at hand as it is interpreted by HLS tools. As a\nresult, FPGA design still largely remains job of either hardware engineers or\nexpert HLS designers. In this work, we aim to take a step towards making HLS\ntools useful for a broader set of programmers.
