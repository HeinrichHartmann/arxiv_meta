This method may be viewed as subspace iteration\ncombined with a model reduction procedure. Specifically, starting with a test\nsolution, the method solves a reduced model to obtain a more precise solution,\nand it repeats this process until sufficient accuracy is achieved. The reduced\nmodel is obtained by projecting the full model onto a subspace that is spanned\nby the dominant modes of an extended data ensemble. The learning procedure is\ncomputed in the online stage, as opposed to being computed offline, which is\nused in many projection-based model reduction techniques that require prior\ncalculations or experiments.

Our findings\nimply that an optimal value $U^\\ast$ of the Hubbard parameter could be\ndetermined, which ensures that the HSE+$U^\\ast$ calculation reproduces the\nexperimental band gap. It is shown that an improved description not only of the\nelectronic structure but also of the crystal structure and energetics is\nobtained by adding the $U^\\ast$ term to the HSE functional, proving the utility\nof HSE+$U^\\ast$ approach in modeling semiconductors with localized electronic\nstates.\n"]}]

We carry out a detailed X-ray spectral analysis with the\ntwofold aim of measuring redshifts and characterizing the properties of the\nIntra-Cluster Medium (ICM). Optical counterparts and spectroscopic or\nphotometric redshifts are obtained with a cross-correlation with NED.\nAdditional photometric redshifts are computed with a dedicated follow-up\nprogram with the TNG and a cross-correlation with the SDSS. We also detect the\niron emission lines in 35% of the sample, and hence obtain a robust measure of\nthe X-ray redshift zX. We use zX whenever the optical redshift is not\navailable. Finally, for all the sources with measured redshift,\nbackground-subtracted spectra are fitted with a mekal model. We perform\nextensive spectral simulations to derive an empirical formula to account for\nfitting bias. The bias-corrected values are then used to investigate the\nscaling properties of the X-ray observables. Overall, we are able to\ncharacterize the ICM of 46 sources. The sample is mostly constituted by\nclusters with temperatures between 3 and 10 keV, plus 14 low-mass clusters and\ngroups with temperatures below 3 keV. The redshift distribution peaks around\nz~0.25 and extends up to z~1, with 60% of the sample at 0.1<z<0.4. We derive\nthe Luminosity-Temperature relation for these 46 sources, finding good\nagreement with previous studies. The quality of the SWXCS sample is comparable\nto other samples available in the literature and obtained with much larger\nX-ray telescopes.

Then, we show that\nribbons with supported-edges have a sample-size dependent energy gap in the\nphonon spectrum which is particularly large for in-plane modes. Irrespective to\nthe calculation method and the boundary condition, the dependence of the energy\ngap for the low-energy optical phonon modes against the ribbon width W is found\nto be proportional to 1/W for in-plane, and 1/W$^2$ for out-of-plane phonon\nmodes. Using the 5NNFCM, the ballistic thermal conductance and its\ncontributions from every single phonon mode are then obtained by the non\nequilibrium Green's function technique. We found that, while edge and central\nlocalized single atomic vacancies do not affect the low-energy transmission\nfunction of in-plane phonon modes, they reduce considerably the contributions\nof the flexural modes. On the other hand, in-plane modes contributions are\nstrongly dependent on the boundary conditions and at low temperatures can be\nhighly reduced in supported-edges samples.

Contextual information\nretrieval (CIR) is a critical technique for these search engines to facilitate\nqueries and return relevant information. Despite its importance, little\nprogress has been made in CIR due to the difficulty of capturing and\nrepresenting contextual information about users. Numerous contextual\ninformation retrieval approaches exist today, but to the best of our knowledge\nnone of them offer a similar service to the one proposed in this paper.\n  This paper proposes an alternative framework for contextual information\nretrieval from the WWW. The framework aims to improve query results (or make\nsearch results more relevant) by constructing a contextual profile based on a\nuser's behaviour, their preferences, and a shared knowledge base, and using\nthis information in the search engine framework to find and return relevant\ninformation.\n","Comment: Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Adaptive Systems\n  and Software Engineering (IASSE 2005)"]}]

In the case of positive solutions, our estimates allow\nus to extend previous radial symmetry results. In particular, by combining our\nresults and a result of Damascelli-Ramaswamy, we are able to extend a recent\nresult of Damascelli-Merch\\'an-Montoro-Sciunzi on the symmetry of positive\nsolutions in $D^{1,p}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ of the equation $-\\Delta_pu=u^{p^*-1}$,\nwhere $p^*:=np/(n-p)$.\n"]}]

During this stage,\nmacro-molecules called ribosomes travel along the mRNA strand linking\namino-acids together in a specific order to create a functioning protein. An\nimportant question is how to maximize protein production. Indeed, translation\nis known to consume most of the cell's energy and it is natural to assume that\nevolution shaped this process so that it maximizes the protein production rate.\nIf this is indeed so then one can estimate various parameters of the\ntranslation machinery by solving an appropriate mathematical optimization\nproblem. The same problem also arises in the context of synthetic biology,\nnamely, re-engineer heterologous genes in order to maximize their translation\nrate in a host organism. We consider the problem of maximizing the protein\nproduction rate using a computational model for translation-elongation called\nthe ribosome flow model (RFM). This model describes the flow of the ribosomes\nalong an mRNA chain of length n using a set of n first-order nonlinear ODEs. It\nalso includes n+1 positive parameters: the ribosomal initiation rate into the\nmRNA chain, and n elongation rates along the chain sites. We show that the\nsteady-state translation rate in the RFM is a strictly concave function of its\nparameters. This means that the problem of maximizing the translation rate\nunder a suitable constraint always admits a unique solution, and that this\nsolution can be determined using highly-efficient algorithms for solving convex\noptimization problems even for large values of n. Furthermore, our analysis\nshows that the optimal translation rate can be computed based only on the\noptimal initiation rate and the elongation rate of the codons near the\nbeginning of the ORF. We discuss some applications of the theoretical results\nto synthetic biology, molecular evolution, and functional genomics.\n"]}]
