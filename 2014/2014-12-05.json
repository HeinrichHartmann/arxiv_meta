The\nprevailing fundamental question would be how these two mechanisms contrive to\naccomplish emergent anomalous behaviors. Here, we have grown high quality\nperovskite SrIrO3 thin films, containing a strong spin orbit coupled 5d element\nIr, on various substrates such as GdScO3 (110), DyScO3 (110), SrTiO3 (001), and\nNdGaO3 (110) with increasing lattice mismatch, in order to carry out a\nsystematic study on the transport properties. We found that metal insulator\ntransitions can be induced in this system; by either reducing thickness (on\nbest lattice matched substrate) or changing degree of lattice strain (by\nlattice mismatch between film and substrates) of films. Surprisingly these two\npathways seek two distinct types of metal insulator transitions; the former\nfalls into disorder driven Anderson type whereas the latter turns out to be of\nunconventional Mott-Anderson type with the interplay of disorder and\ncorrelation. More interestingly, in the metallic phases of SrIrO3, unusual\nnon-Fermi liquid characteristics emerge in resistivity as the resistivity\nexponent evolves from from 4/5 to 1 to 3/2 with increasing lattice strain. We\ndiscuss theoretical implications of these phenomena to shed light on the metal\ninsulator transitions.\n","Comment: Some figures are redrawn, appears in Journal of Applied Physics"]}]

Stochastic switching between different phenotypes can occur as the\nresult of random fluctuations in molecular copy numbers of mRNA and proteins\narising in transcription, translation, transport, and binding. However, which\ncomponent of a pathway triggers such a transition is generally not known. By\nlinking single-cell experiments on the lactose-uptake pathway in E. coli to\nmolecular simulations, we devise a general method to pinpoint the particular\nfluctuation driving phenotype switching and apply this method to the transition\nbetween the uninduced and induced states of the lac genes.

Interest in\nmeta-analysis in brain mapping is also driven by a recent focus on so-called\n\"reverse inference\": where as traditional \"forward inference\" identifies the\nregions of the brain involved in a task, a reverse inference identifies the\ncognitive processes that a task engages. Such reverse inferences, however,\nrequire a set of meta-analysis, one for each possible cognitive domain.\nHowever, existing methods for neuroimaging meta-analysis have significant\nlimitations. Commonly used methods for neuroimaging meta-analysis are not model\nbased, do not provide interpretable parameter estimates, and only produce null\nhypothesis inferences; further, they are generally designed for a single group\nof studies and cannot produce reverse inferences.

In particular, foci from each\ntype of study are modeled as a cluster process driven by a random intensity\nfunction that is modeled as a kernel convolution of a gamma random field.

It has been shown to be NP-hard by [Thomassen '89] and a\nlinear-time fixed-parameter algorithm has been obtained by [Mohar '99]. Despite\nextensive study, the approximability of the Euler genus remains wide open.\nWhile the existence of an $O(1)$-approximation is not ruled out, the currently\nbest-known upper bound is a trivial $O(n/g)$-approximation that follows from\nbounds on the Euler characteristic.\n  In this paper, we give the first non-trivial approximation algorithm for this\nproblem. Specifically, we present a polynomial-time algorithm which given a\ngraph $G$ of Euler genus $g$ outputs an embedding of $G$ into a surface of\nEuler genus $g^{O(1)}$. Combined with the above $O(n/g)$-approximation, our\nresult also implies a $O(n^{1-\\alpha})$-approximation, for some universal\nconstant $\\alpha>0$.\n  Our approximation algorithm also has implications for the design of\nalgorithms on graphs of small genus. Several of these algorithms require that\nan embedding of the graph into a surface of small genus is given as part of the\ninput. Our result implies that many of these algorithms can be implemented even\nwhen the embedding of the input graph is unknown.\n"]}]

A $k$-neighborhood in $G$ is a set of vertices\nconsisting of all the vertices at distance at most $k$ from some vertex of $G$.\nThe hypergraph on vertex set $V$ which edge set consists of all the\n$k$-neighborhoods of $G$ for all $k$ is the neighborhood hypergraph of $G$. Our\ngoal in this paper is to investigate the complexity of a graph in terms of its\nneighborhoods. Precisely, we define the distance VC-dimension of a graph $G$ as\nthe maximum taken over all induced subgraphs $G'$ of $G$ of the VC-dimension of\nthe neighborhood hypergraph of $G'$. For a class of graphs, having bounded\ndistance VC-dimension both generalizes minor closed classes and graphs with\nbounded clique-width.\n  Our motivation is a result of Chepoi, Estellon and Vax\\`es asserting that\nevery planar graph of diameter $2\\ell$ can be covered by a bounded number of\nballs of radius $\\ell$. In fact, they obtained the existence of a function $f$\nsuch that every set $\\cal F$ of balls of radius $\\ell$ in a planar graph admits\na hitting set of size $f(\\nu)$ where $\\nu$ is the maximum number of pairwise\ndisjoint elements of $\\cal F$.\n  Our goal is to generalize the proof of Chepoi, Estellon and Vax\\`es with the\nunique assumption of bounded distance VC-dimension of neighborhoods. In other\nwords, the set of balls of fixed radius in a graph with bounded distance\nVC-dimension has the Erd\\H{o}s-P\\'osa property.\n"]}]
