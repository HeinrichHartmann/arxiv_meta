For quantum-coherence on\ngalactic scales of radius R and mass M, either the de-Broglie wavelength\nlambda_deB <~ R, requiring m >~ m_H \\cong 10^{-25}(R/100 kpc)^{-1/2}(M/10^{12}\nM_solar)^{-1/2} eV, or else lambda_deB << R but self-interaction balances\ngravity, requiring m >> m_H and g >> g_H \\cong 2 x 10^{-64} (R/100\nkpc)(M/10^{12} M_solar)^{-1} eV cm^3. Here we study the largely-neglected\neffects of angular momentum. Spin parameters lambda \\cong 0.05 are expected\nfrom tidal-torquing by large-scale structure, just as for sCDM. Since lab BECs\ndevelop quantum vortices if rotated rapidly enough, we ask if this angular\nmomentum is sufficient to form vortices in BEC haloes, affecting their\nstructure with potentially observable consequences. The minimum angular\nmomentum for this, L_{QM} = $\\hbar M/m$, requires m >= 9.5 m_H for lambda =\n0.05, close to the particle mass required to influence structure on galactic\nscales. We study the equilibrium of self-gravitating, rotating BEC haloes which\nsatisfy the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations, to calculate if and when\nvortices are energetically favoured. Vortices form as long as self-interaction\nis strong enough, which includes a large part of the range of m and g of\ninterest for BEC-CDM haloes.\n","Comment: Several typos and numerical typos (incl. in Fig.6, Table 2 and Table\n  3) have been corrected and references have been updated after proof-reading\n  stage; MNRAS in press; 29 pages; 11 figures"]}]

We show that the\nfull posterior probability distributions for the redshifts of galaxies with\nfive-band photometry exhibit good agreement with redshifts estimated from\nthirty-band photometry in the COSMOS field. The growth of shear with increasing\ndistance behind each galaxy cluster shows the expected redshift-distance\nrelation for a flat Lambda-CDM cosmology. Photometric redshifts and calibrated\ncolors are used in subsequent papers to measure the masses of 51 galaxy\nclusters from their weak gravitational shear. We make our Python code for\nstellar locus matching available at http://big-macs-calibrate.googlecode.com;\nthe code requires only a catalog and filter functions.\n","Comment: Accepted by MNRAS with only minor revisions.

From an\ninformation theoretic point of view, accounting for such topological aspects\nhas remained largely unexplored, despite strong indications that such aspects\ncan crucially affect transceiver and feedback design, as well as the overall\nperformance.\n  The work here takes a step in exploring this interplay between topology,\nfeedback and performance. This is done for the two user broadcast channel with\nrandom fading, in the presence of a simple two-state topological setting of\nstatistically strong vs. weaker links, and in the presence of a practical\nternary feedback setting of alternating channel state information at the\ntransmitter (alternating CSIT) where for each channel realization, this CSIT\ncan be perfect, delayed, or not available.\n  In this setting, the work derives generalized degrees-of-freedom bounds and\nexact expressions, that capture performance as a function of feedback\nstatistics and topology statistics. The results are based on novel topological\nsignal management (TSM) schemes that account for topology in order to fully\nutilize feedback. This is achieved for different classes of feedback mechanisms\nof practical importance, from which we identify specific feedback mechanisms\nthat are best suited for different topologies. This approach offers further\ninsight on how to split the effort --- of channel learning and feeding back\nCSIT --- for the strong versus for the weaker link.

Furthermore,\nsome sophisticated banks are including an FVA (Funding Valuation Adjustment),\nbut since DVA can be interpreted as a funding benefit the oft-debated issue\nregarding a possible double-counting of funding benefits arises, with little\nconsensus as to its resolution. One possibility is to price the derivative by\nreplication, guaranteeing a consistent inclusion of costs and benefits.\nHowever, as has recently been noted, DVA is (at least partially) unhedgeable,\nhaving no exact market hedge. Furthermore, current frameworks shed little light\non the controversial question, raised by Hull (2012), of whether the effect a\nderivative has on the riskiness of an institution's debt should be taken into\naccount when calculating FVA.\n  In this paper we propose a solution to these two problems by identifying an\ninstrument, a fictitious CDS written on the hedging counterparty which is\nimplicitly contained in any given derivatives transaction. This allows us to\nshow that the hedger's unhedged jump-to-default risk has, despite not being\nactively managed, a well defined value associated to a funding benefit.\nCarrying out the replication including such a CDS, we obtain a price for the\nderivative consisting of its collateralized equivalent, a contingent CVA, a\ncontingent DVA, and an FVA, coupled to the price via the hedger's short-term\nbond-CDS basis.\n  The resulting funding cost is non-zero, but substantially smaller than what\nis obtained in alternative approaches due to the effect the derivative has on\nthe recovery of the hedger's liabilities.

Multiple game-theoretic models have been proposed to better\nunderstand and predict such behavior and the outcomes it induces. However,\nthese models often make unrealistic assumptions regarding voters' behavior and\nthe information on which they base their vote.\n  We suggest a new model for strategic voting that takes into account voters'\nbounded rationality, as well as their limited access to reliable information.\nWe introduce a simple behavioral heuristic based on \\emph{local dominance},\nwhere each voter considers a set of possible world states without assigning\nprobabilities to them.

The recently identified\ncoordinated data injection attacks to meter measurements can bypass the current\nsecurity system and introduce errors to the state estimates. The conventional\nwisdom to mitigate such attacks is by securing meter measurements to evade\nmalicious injections. In this paper, we provide a novel alternative to defend\nagainst false-data injection attacks using covert power network topological\ninformation. By keeping the exact reactance of a set of transmission lines from\nattackers, no false data injection attack can be launched to compromise any set\nof state variables.

A mixed integer\nlinear programming (MILP) formulation is introduced to obtain the optimal mixed\ndefending strategy.

Two key points underlie\nthe work: (i) the soil suction at drying coincides with that of the soil\nintra-aggregate matrix and contributive clay; and (ii) both the soil suction\nand volume shrinkage at drying depend on the same soil water content. In\naddition the two following results are used: (i) the available two-factor\n(capillarity and shrinkage) model of clay suction enables one to connect a clay\nsuction and clay water content using the clay matrix structure; and (ii) the\nrecent reference shrinkage curve model based on the concepts of intra-aggregate\nsoil structure permits one to connect the soil water content at shrinkage with\nthe water content of the contributive clay. With that the available two-factor\nmodel was essentially modified and, in particular, the effect of adsorbed water\nfilm was taken into account. The developed model includes the following input\nparameters: the solid density, relative volume of contributive-clay solids,\nrelative volume of contributive clay in the oven-dried state, soil clay\ncontent, aggregate/intra-aggregate mass ratio, and specific volume of lacunar\npores in the aggregates at maximum swelling.

The comparisons,\nwhich are performed as a function of collision centrality and the mean\ntransverse momentum for pion pairs, indicate strikingly similar patterns for\nthe $d$$+$Au and Au$+$Au systems. They also indicate a linear dependence of\nR$_{{\\rm side}}$ on the initial transverse geometric size $\\bar{R}$, as well as\na smaller freeze-out size for the $d$$+$Au system.

Typically, the measured\nsignal is enhanced using large numerical aperture collection optics and high\ngain detectors. We show that the signal in remote detection techniques can be\nenhanced by using a long-lived air waveguide generated by an array of\nfemtosecond filaments. We present a proof of principle experiment using an air\nplasma spark source and a ~1 m air waveguide showing an increase in collected\nsignal of ~50%. For standoff distances of 100 m, this implies that the\nsignal-to-noise ratio can be increased by a factor ~10$^4$.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 4 figures"]}]
