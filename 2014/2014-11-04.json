Among various\nconstraints in designing such a system, three important constraints are energy\nconsumption, data compression, and device cost. Conventional data compression\nmethodologies, although effective in data compression, consumes significant\nenergy and cannot reduce device cost. Compressed sensing (CS), as an emerging\ndata compression methodology, is promising in catering to these constraints.\nHowever, EEG is non-sparse in the time domain and also non-sparse in\ntransformed domains (such as the wavelet domain). Therefore, it is extremely\ndifficult for current CS algorithms to recover EEG with the quality that\nsatisfies the requirements of clinical diagnosis and engineering applications.\nRecently, Block Sparse Bayesian Learning (BSBL) was proposed as a new method to\nthe CS problem. This study introduces the technique to the telemonitoring of\nEEG. Experimental results show that its recovery quality is better than\nstate-of-the-art CS algorithms, and sufficient for practical use. These results\nsuggest that BSBL is very promising for telemonitoring of EEG and other\nnon-sparse physiological signals.\n","Comment: Matlab codes can be downloaded at:\n  http://dsp.ucsd.edu/~zhilin/BSBL.html, or\n  http://sites.google.com/site/researchbyzhang/bsbl"]}]

This paper does not deal with the\nlatter issue with respect to why, and instead investigates whether Zipf's law\nholds in a global setting, thus involving all cities around the world. Unlike\nprevious studies, which have mainly relied on conventional census data such as\npopulations, and census-bureau-imposed definitions of cities, we adopt\nnaturally (in terms of data speaks for itself) delineated cities, or natural\ncities, to be more precise, in order to examine Zipf's law. We find that Zipf's\nlaw holds remarkably well for all natural cities at the global level, and\nremains almost valid at the continental level except for Africa at certain time\ninstants. We further examine the law at the country level, and note that Zipf's\nlaw is violated from country to country or from time to time. This violation is\nmainly due to our limitations; we are limited to individual countries, or to a\nstatic view on city-size distributions. The central argument of this paper is\nthat Zipf's law is universal, and we therefore must use the correct scope in\norder to observe it. We further find Zipf's law applied to city numbers; the\nnumber of cities in the first largest country is twice as many as that in the\nsecond largest country, three times as many as that in the third largest\ncountry, and so on.

Less expected, we also show\nthat the nature of the extracellular and intracellular media influence the\naxial current, and thus also influence neuronal magnetic fields.

The X-ray activities of the\nsystem might also be connected with the mass ejection events from the Be star.\nWhen the ejected materials were transported from the surface of the Be star to\nthe orbit of neutron star, an X-ray flare could be observed in its X-ray light\ncurves. We use the neutron star as a probe to constrain the motion of the\nejected material in the circumstellar disk. With the diffusion time of the\nejected material from the surface of Be star to the orbit of neutron star, the\nviscosity parameter {\\alpha} of the circumstellar disk is estimated to be 0.39\nand 0.28 for the different time, indicating that the disk around Be star may be\ntruncated by the neutron star at the 2:1 resonance radius and Type I X-ray\noutburst is unlikely to be observed in X Per.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 5 figure, 1 table"]}]

To\novercome this weakness, we propose FUSE, a multiple network aligner that\nutilizes all functional and topological information in all PPI networks. It\nworks in two steps. First, it computes novel similarity scores of proteins\nacross the PPI networks by fusing from all aligned networks both the protein\nwiring patterns and their sequence similarities.

When we apply NMTF on the five\nlargest and most complete PPI networks from BioGRID, we show that NMTF finds a\nlarger number of protein pairs across the PPI networks that are functionally\nconserved than can be found by using protein sequence similarities alone. This\ndemonstrates complementarity of protein sequence and their wiring patterns in\nthe PPI networks. In the second step, FUSE uses a novel maximum weight\nk-partite matching approximation algorithm to find an alignment between\nmultiple networks.

Critically, we do not detect an\nemission feature at the predicted energy and line flux in the Coma, Virgo and\nOphiuchus clusters. The formal 99.5 per cent upper limits on the strengths of\nan emission line in each cluster are below the decaying DM model predictions,\nscaling from the Perseus Cluster center, apparently ruling the model out. In\nthe light of these results, we search for other explanations for the ~3.55 keV\nemission feature in Perseus. Our results suggest that systematic effects\nassociated with modeling the complex spectra for the Perseus Cluster core,\ndetails of the assumed ionization balance, and errors in the predicted\nemissivities of the spectral lines may in part be responsible for the ~3.5 keV\nfeature.\n","Comment: submitted to MNRAS"]}]

Our\nobjective in this study was to assess metabolic diversity in sesame by\nnontargeted metabolic profiling and elucidate the relationship between\nmetabolic and genome diversity in this crop. Results: Ten sesame accessions\nwere selected that represent most of the genome diversity of sesame grown in\nIndia, Western Asia, Sudan and Venezuela based on previous AFLP studies.\nEthanolic seed extracts were separated by HPLC, metabolites were ionized by\npositive and negative electrospray and ions were detected with an ion trap mass\nspectrometer in full-scan mode for m/z from 50 to 1000.

The relationship between biodiversity at the genome and at\nthe metabolome levels was assessed by correlation analysis and multivariate\nstatistics. Conclusion: Patterns of diversity at the genomic and metabolic\nlevels differed, indicating that selection played a significant role in the\nevolution of metabolic diversity in sesame. This result implies that when used\nfor the selection of genotypes in breeding and conservation, diversity\nassessment based on neutral DNA markers should be complemented with metabolic\nprofiles.

Finally, we repeated the computation for two other\ndefinitions of older articles, 15 years and older and 20 years and older.\n  There are three conclusions from our study. First, the impact of older\narticles has grown substantially over 1990-2013. In 2013, 36% of citations were\nto articles that are at least 10 years old; this fraction has grown 28% since\n1990.

We then give\nmore details on recent results on the dynamics of singular-hyperbolic\n(Lorenz-like) attractors.\n","Comment: 40 pages; 10 figures; Keywords: sensitive dependence on initial\n  conditions, physical measure, singular-hyperbolicity, expansiveness, robust\n  attractor, robust chaotic flow, positive Lyapunov exponent, large deviations,\n  hitting and recurrence times.
