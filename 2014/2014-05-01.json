This is commonly achieved by creating sub-wavelength\nlattices of electronic or plasmonic structures, so-called meta-atoms, that\ndetermine the interaction between light and metamaterial. One of the ultimate\ngoals for these tailored media is the ability to control their properties\nin-situ which has led to a whole new branch of tunable and switchable\nmetamaterials. Many of the present realizations rely on introducing\nmicroelectromechanical actuators or semiconductor elements into their meta-atom\nstructures. Here we show that superconducting quantum interference devices\n(SQUIDs) can be used as fast, intrinsically switchable meta-atoms. We found\nthat their intrinsic nonlinearity leads to simultaneously stable dynamic\nstates, each of which is associated with a different value and sign of the\nmagnetic susceptibility in the microwave domain. Moreover, we demonstrate that\nit is possible to switch between these states by applying a nanosecond long\npulse in addition to the microwave probe signal.

The solution we develop builds on the so-called model-based\nprobably approximately correct Markov decision process (PAC-MDP) methodology.\nThe algorithm attains an $\\varepsilon$-approximately optimal policy with\nprobability $1-\\delta$ using samples (i.e. observations), time and space that\ngrow polynomially with the size of the MDP, the size of the automaton\nexpressing the temporal logic specification, $\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}$,\n$\\frac{1}{\\delta}$ and a finite time horizon. In this approach, the system\nmaintains a model of the initially unknown MDP, and constructs a product MDP\nbased on its learned model and the specification automaton that expresses the\ntemporal logic constraints. During execution, the policy is iteratively updated\nusing observation of the transitions taken by the system. The iteration\nterminates in finitely many steps. With high probability, the resulting policy\nis such that, for any state, the difference between the probability of\nsatisfying the specification under this policy and the optimal one is within a\npredefined bound.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 5 figures, Accepted by 2014 Robotics: Science and Systems\n  (RSS)"]}]

In this model, there are m distributed sites each\nobserving a distinct stream of data (where each element is a row of a\ndistributed matrix) and has a communication channel with a coordinator, and the\ngoal is to track an eps-approximation to the norm of the matrix along any\ndirection.

As we prove, this protocol is optimal, in the sense that there is no\npopulation protocol that always computes majority with fewer than 4 states per\nvertex. However this does not rule out the existence of a protocol with 3\nstates per vertex that is correct with high probability. To this end, we\nexamine a very natural majority protocol with 3 states per vertex, introduced\nin [Angluin et al. 2008] where its performance has been analyzed for the clique\ngraph. We study the performance of this protocol in arbitrary networks. We\nprove that, when the two initial states are put uniformly at random on the\nvertices, this protocol converges to the initial majority with probability\nhigher than the probability of converging to the initial minority.

APU is based on two easy principles: 1) nodes whose arrangements are\nharder to guess update their positions more recurrently (and vice versa), and\n(ii) nodes faster to forwarding paths update their positions more recurrently\n(and vice versa). Our speculative analysis, which is validated by NS2\nsimulations of a well-known geographic routing procedure, Greedy Perimeter\nStateless Routing Protocol (GPSR),shows that APU can drastically reduce the\nupdate cost and pick up the routing performance in terms of packet delivery\nratio and regular end-to-end delay in assessment with periodic beaconing and\nother recently proposed updating schemes. The benefits of APU are additional\nconfirmed by responsibility evaluations in realistic network scenarios, which\naccount for localization error, practical radio propagation, and sparse system.\n","Comment: 7 PAGES, 5 FIGURES"]}]

Several recent papers have attempted to extend this work to\nmixed-integer conic programs. In this paper we study the structure of the\nconvex hull of a two-term disjunction applied to the second-order cone, and\ndevelop a methodology to derive closed-form expressions for convex inequalities\ndescribing the resulting convex hull. Our approach is based on first\ncharacterizing the structure of undominated valid linear inequalities for the\ndisjunction and then using conic duality to derive a family of convex, possibly\nnonlinear, valid inequalities that correspond to these linear inequalities. We\nidentify and study the cases where these valid inequalities can equivalently be\nexpressed in conic quadratic form and where a single inequality from this\nfamily is sufficient to describe the convex hull. In particular, our results on\ntwo-term disjunctions on the second-order cone generalize related results on\nsplit cuts by Modaresi, Kilinc, and Vielma, and by Andersen and Jensen.\n"]}]
