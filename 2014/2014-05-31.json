We announced our findings a few months\nago, on March 21$^{st}$, 2013. I describe some of the relevant steps we took to\nobtain these results, sketching the measurement process, how we processed the\ndata to obtain full sky maps at 9 different frequencies, and how we extracted\nthe CMB temperature anisotropies map and angular power spectrum. I conclude by\ndescribing some of the main cosmological implications of the statistical\ncharacteristics of the CMB we found. Of course, this is a very much shortened\nand somewhat biased view of the \\Planck\\ 2013 results, written with the hope\nthat it may lead some of the students to consult the original papers.\n","Comment: 53 p.-34 fig; for spacetime consideration, the file here is not\n  paying justice to the actual thing; a closer approximation of it can be found\n  at\n  https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Francois_Bouchet/publication/262004262_The_Planck_Mission/file/e0b495363b042e81dd.pdf"]}]
