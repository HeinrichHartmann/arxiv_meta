Within\nthese environments, XCS either fails, or only develops a suboptimal policy,\nsince it has no memory. In this work, we develop a new classifier system based\non XCS to tackle this problem. It adds an internal message list to XCS as the\nmemory list to record input sensation history, and extends a small number of\nclassifiers with memory conditions. The classifier's memory condition, as a\nfoothold to disambiguate non-Markov states, is used to sense a specified\nelement in the memory list. Besides, a detection method is employed to\nrecognize non-Markov states in environments, to avoid these states controlling\nover classifiers' memory conditions. Furthermore, four sets of different\ncomplex maze environments have been tested by the proposed method. Experimental\nresults show that our system is one of the best techniques to solve partially\nobservable environments, compared with some well-known classifier systems\nproposed for these environments.\n","Comment: 34 pages, 15 figures, 1 table"]}]

The explicit breaking term for the\nvacuum alignment gives rise to a mass of the tHiggs, which is protected by the\nsymmetry and hence naturally controlled against radiative corrections.\nRealistic top quark mass is easily realized similarly to the top-seesaw\nmechanism by introducing an extra (subcritical) four-fermion coupling which\nexplicitly breaks the residual U(2) x U(1)' symmetry.
