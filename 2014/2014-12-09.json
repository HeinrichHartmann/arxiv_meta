The pseudo equivalent width (pEW) and Doppler\nshift of absorption-line-like features, such as Si II 6150A, Ca II HK 3750A,\nand the Ca II IR-triplet 8150A quantities that are often associated with the\noptical depth and the velocity of a shell of interacting material, are\nimportant tools for interpreting and classifying the SN Ia spectra. In this\npaper, we examine the nature of spectral features in SN Ia spectra using W7\nmodel spectra and a technique that we call \"knock-out\" spectra. We show that\nthe P-Cyg profiles of Si II 6150A and many other features are largely emission\ndominated, rather than absorption dominated, and that the concepts of\n\"absorption line\" and \"continuum\" are therefore not adequate to describe the\nnature of spectral features in SNe Ia. Apparent absorption features, like Si II\n6150A, are frequently just coincidental troughs between two (or more)\nuncorrelated emission features. In this situation, the pEW measured between\nthese emission peaks is little related to the true strength of the presumed\nabsorption feature. Furthermore, using the same knock-out technique, we\ndemonstrate how spectral features overlap each other at different times after\nthe explosion. This overlap distorts individual line profiles and affects\nmeasured absorption-line velocities. With synthetic SN Ia ejecta\nstratifications that are tuned to match specific observations, the method\npresented in this paper can in principle be used to quantify the effects of\nspecific line opacities on measured line velocity, line strength, and line\nblending, and improve the interpretation and informative value of observed SN\nIa spectra.\n","Comment: Submitted to ApJ"]}]

Five WBCs, three belonging to the\nsurface energy (SE) formulation using the linear, cubic and sine functions\n(denoted as LinSE, CubSE and SinSE), the fourth using a geometric formulation\n(Geom), and the fifth using a characteristic interpolation (CI), were compared\nwith each other through the study of several problems: (1) the static contact\nangle of a drop; (2) a Poiseuille flow-driven liquid column; (3) a wettability\ngradient (WG)-driven liquid column; (4) drop dewetting. It was found that while\nall WBCs can predict the static contact angle fairly accurately, they may\naffect the simulation outcomes of dynamic problems differently, depending on\nthe driving mechanism. For the flow-driven problem, to use different WBCs had\nalmost no effect on the flow characteristics over a large scale. But for other\ncapillarity-driven problems, the WBC had some noticeable effects. For the\nWG-driven liquid column, Geom gave the most consistent prediction between the\ndrop velocity and dynamic contact angles, and LinSE delivered the poorest\nprediction in this aspect. Except for Geom, the dynamic contact angle differed\nfrom the prescribed (static) one when other WBCs were used. For drop dewetting,\nGeom led to the most violent drop motion whereas CubSE caused the weakest\nmotion; the initial contact line velocity was also found to be dependent on the\nWBC. For several problems, CubSE and SinSE gave almost the same results, and\nthose by Geom and CI were close as well, possibly due to similar consideration\nin their design. Besides various comparisons, a new implementation that may be\nused for all WBCs was proposed to mimic the wall energy relaxation and control\nthe degree of slip.

Most EnKF algorithms assume that\nthe underlying probability distributions are Gaussian. Although this assumption\nis well accepted, it is too restrictive when applied to large nonlinear models,\nnonlinear observation operators, and large levels of uncertainty. Several\napproaches have been proposed in order to avoid the Gaussianity assumption.

Under Rank-1 model, we first consider a single-user system\nwith N transmit and M receive antennas, and focus on the problem of\npower-scaling law when the transmit power is scaled down proportionally to\n1/MN. It can be shown that as MN grows large, the scattered interference\nvanishes, and the ergodic achievable rate is higher than that of the\ncorresponding BF scheme based fast fading and minimum mean-square error (MMSE)\nchannel estimation. Then we further consider uplink and downlink single-cell\nscenarios where the base station (BS) has M antennas and each of K users has N\nantennas. When the transmit power for each user is scaled down proportionally\nto 1/MN, it can be shown for finite users that as M grows without bound, each\nuser obtains finally the same rate performance as in the single-user case. Even\nwhen N grows without bound, however, there still remains inter-user LOS\ninterference that can not be cancelled. Regarding infinite users, there exists\nsuch a power scaling law that when K and the b-th power of M go to infinity\nwith a fixed and finite ratio for a given b in (0, 1), not only inter-user LOS\ninterference but also fast fading effect can be cancelled, while fast fading\neffect can not be cancelled if b=1. Extension to multi-cells and\nfrequency-selective channels are also discussed shortly. Moreover, numerical\nresults indicate that spacial antenna correlation does not have serious\ninfluence on the rate performance, and the BS antennas may be allowed to be\nplaced compactly when M is very large.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 11 figures"]}]

A now standard method\nfor recovering the unknown signal is to solve a convex optimization problem\nthat enforces some prior knowledge about its structure. This has proved\nefficient in many problems routinely encountered in imaging sciences,\nstatistics and machine learning. This chapter delivers a review of recent\nadvances in the field where the regularization prior promotes solutions\nconforming to some notion of simplicity/low-complexity. These priors encompass\nas popular examples sparsity and group sparsity (to capture the compressibility\nof natural signals and images), total variation and analysis sparsity (to\npromote piecewise regularity), and low-rank (as natural extension of sparsity\nto matrix-valued data). Our aim is to provide a unified treatment of all these\nregularizations under a single umbrella, namely the theory of partial\nsmoothness. This framework is very general and accommodates all low-complexity\nregularizers just mentioned, as well as many others. Partial smoothness turns\nout to be the canonical way to encode low-dimensional models that can be linear\nspaces or more general smooth manifolds. This review is intended to serve as a\none stop shop toward the understanding of the theoretical properties of the\nso-regularized solutions. It covers a large spectrum including: (i) recovery\nguarantees and stability to noise, both in terms of $\\ell^2$-stability and\nmodel (manifold) identification; (ii) sensitivity analysis to perturbations of\nthe parameters involved (in particular the observations), with applications to\nunbiased risk estimation ; (iii) convergence properties of the forward-backward\nproximal splitting scheme, that is particularly well suited to solve the\ncorresponding large-scale regularized optimization problem.\n"]}]

Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to\na particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many\ndatasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to\nspecific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been\nstudied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality\nversus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural\nnetwork and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively\naffected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons\nto their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which\nwas expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks\nbetween co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network\ntrained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may\ndominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom,\nmiddle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of\nfeatures decreases as the distance between the base task and target task\nincreases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better\nthan using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a\nnetwork with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce\na boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target\ndataset.\n","Comment: To appear in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 27\n  (NIPS 2014)"]}]

RNMDP propagates Risk Notification Messages (RNMs) from\ntheir location of origin (called the Risk Zone) to vehicles approaching the\nRisk Zone. RNMDP assumes each node is aware of its current location in the\nnetwork. The protocol works as follows: A RNM is broadcast in the neighborhood\nof the Risk Zone. A node receiving the RNM from another node waits for a\nRebroadcast-Wait-Time before deciding to rebroadcast the message. The\nRebroadcast-Wait-Time for a node is modeled based on the ratio of the distance\nbetween the node and the immediate sender of the RNM and the direction of\nmovement of the node. Priority for rebroadcast is given for nodes farthest away\nfrom the sender and traveling towards the Risk Zone. Nodes that are traveling\nin lanes in direction away from the Risk Zone are also considered for\nrebroadcast, albeit with a larger Rebroadcast-Wait-Time. During the\nRebroadcast-Wait-Time, if a node hears the same RNM again rebroadcast in the\nneighborhood, then the node stops from further broadcasting the message. If a\nnode does not hear the RNM in its neighborhood during the RebroadcastWait-Time,\nthe node broadcasts the message in its neighborhood. A RNM is considered to\nhave been delivered to all the vehicles in the road, if the message reaches the\nTarget Zone. The performance of RNMDP has been compared with that of the\ncommonly used flooding strategy through extensive simulations conducted for\nhighway networks with different number of lanes and lane density.

In particular, polynomial approximations to the\nsign function underly algorithms for agnostically learning halfspaces, as well\nas pseudorandom generators for halfspaces. In this work, we investigate the\nlimits of these techniques by proving inapproximability results for the sign\nfunction.\n  Firstly, the polynomial regression algorithm of Kalai et al. (SIAM J. Comput.\n2008) shows that halfspaces can be learned with respect to log-concave\ndistributions on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ in the challenging agnostic learning model. The\npower of this algorithm relies on the fact that under log-concave\ndistributions, halfspaces can be approximated arbitrarily well by low-degree\npolynomials. We ask whether this technique can be extended beyond log-concave\ndistributions, and establish a negative result. We show that polynomials of any\ndegree cannot approximate the sign function to within arbitrarily low error for\na large class of non-log-concave distributions on the real line, including\nthose with densities proportional to $\\exp(-|x|^{0.99})$.\n  Secondly, we investigate the derandomization of Chernoff-type concentration\ninequalities. Chernoff-type tail bounds on sums of independent random variables\nhave pervasive applications in theoretical computer science. Schmidt et al.\n(SIAM J. Discrete Math. 1995) showed that these inequalities can be established\nfor sums of random variables with only $O(\\log(1/\\delta))$-wise independence,\nfor a tail probability of $\\delta$. We show that their results are tight up to\nconstant factors.\n  These results rely on techniques from weighted approximation theory, which\nstudies how well functions on the real line can be approximated by polynomials\nunder various distributions. We believe that these techniques will have further\napplications in other areas of computer science.\n","Comment: 22 pages"]}]

In this work, we generalize the optimality of\nTIN to compound networks. We show that for a K-user compound Gaussian\ninterference channel, if in every possible state for each receiver, the channel\nalways satisfies the TIN-optimality condition identified by Geng et al., then\nthe GDoF region of the compound channel is the intersection of the GDoF regions\nof all possible network realizations, which is achievable by power control and\nTIN. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for a general K-user compound\ninterference channel, regardless of the number of states of each receiver, we\ncan always construct a counterpart K-user regular interference channel that has\nthe same TIN region as the original compound channel. The regular interference\nchannel has only one state for each receiver, which may be different from all\nof the original states. Solving the GDoF-based power control problem for the\ncompound channel is equivalent to solving the same problem in its regular\ncounterpart. Exploring the power control problem further we develop a\ncentralized power control scheme for K-user compound interference channels, to\nachieve all the Pareto optimal GDoF tuples. Finally, based on this scheme, we\ndevise an iterative power control algorithm which requires at most K updates to\nobtain the globally optimal power allocation for any feasible GDoF tuple.\n"]}]

Here we provided analysis of processes of ionization and emission\nbasing on analytical and numerical calculations of kinetic equations which\ndescribe processes of particle propagation and their energy losses. The origin\nof gamma rays could be either due to collisions of relativistic protons with\nthe dense gas of the surrounding circumnuclear disk (CND) or bremsstrahlung and\ninverse Compton scattering of relativistic electrons. The hydrogen ionization\nin this case is produced by a low energy component of the CR spectrum. We found\nthat if ionization is produced by protons the expected ionization rate of\nhydrogen in the CND is of the same order as derived from IR observations. So we\ndo not see any discrepancy between the gamma-ray and ionization data for the\nhadronic model. In the case of ionization by electrons we obtained the\nionization rate one order of magnitude higher than follows from the IR data. In\nprinciple, a selection between the leptonic and hadronic interpretations can be\nperformed basing on measurements of radio and X-ray fluxes from this region\nbecause the leptonic and hadronic models give different values of the fluxes\nfrom there. We do not exclude that gamma-ray production and hydrogen ionization\nin the CND are due to a past activity of Sgr A* which occurred about 100 year\nago.
