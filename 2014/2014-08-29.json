The proxy for\npeak height, which is proposed as a better alternative than the virial mass,\nconsists in the total mass given by the mass of neighbour host haloes in\ncylinders centred at each central galaxy. The radius of the cylinder is\nparametrized as a function of stellar age and virial mass. The best-fitting set\nof parameters that make the assembly bias signal lower than 5$-$15 per cent for\nboth SDSS and mock central galaxies are similar. The idea behind the\nparametrization is not to minimize the bias, but it is to use this method to\nunderstand the physical features that produce the assembly bias effect. Even\nthough the tracers of the density field used here differ significantly from\nthose used in paper I, our analysis of the simulated catalogue indicates that\nthe different tracers produce correlated proxies, and therefore the reason\nbehind this assembly bias is the crowding of peaks in both simulations and the\nSDSS.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 11 figures.

The more recent network coding approach, in contrast, prompts\nintermediate nodes to mix and code together messages. It has been shown that\ncertain wired networks have an asymptotic network coding gap, that is, they\nhave asymptotically higher broadcast throughput when using network coding\ncompared to routing. Whether such a gap exists for wireless networks has been\nan open question of great interest. We approach this question by studying the\nbroadcast throughput of the radio network model which has been a standard\nmathematical model to study wireless communication.\n  We show that there is a family of radio networks with a tight $\\Theta(\\log\n\\log n)$ network coding gap, that is, networks in which the asymptotic\nthroughput achievable via routing messages is a $\\Theta(\\log \\log n)$ factor\nsmaller than that of the optimal network coding algorithm.

Since such environments are more complex than those of isolated\ncores, it is essential to understand how the observed line profiles from\ncollapsing cores with non-spherical geometry are affected by filaments. In this\nstudy, we investigate line profile asymmetries by performing radiative transfer\ncalculations on hydrodynamic models of three collapsing cores that are embedded\nin filaments. We compare the results to those that are expected for isolated\ncores. We model the five lowest rotational transition line (J = 1-0, 2-1, 3-2,\n4-3, and 5-4) of both optically thick (HCN, HCO$^+$) as well as optically thin\n(N$_2$H$^+$, H$^{13}$CO$^+$) molecules using constant abundance laws. We find\nthat less than 50% of simulated (1-0) transition lines show blue infall\nasymmetries due to obscuration by the surrounding filament. However, the\nfraction of collapsing cores that have a blue asymmetric emission line profile\nrises to 90% when observed in the (4-3) transition. Since the densest gas\ntowards the collapsing core can excite higher rotational states, upper level\ntransitions are more likely to produce blue asymmetric emission profiles. We\nconclude that even in irregular, embedded cores one can trace infalling gas\nmotions with blue asymmetric line profiles of optically thick lines by\nobserving higher transitions. The best tracer of collapse motions of our sample\nis the (4-3) transition of HCN, but the (3-2) and (5-4) transitions of both HCN\nand HCO$^+$ are also good tracers.\n","Comment: accepted by MNRAS; 13 pages, 16 figures, 6 tables"]}]

In their analysis, Baikov et al. relied on the\nconventional practice of simply guessing the renormalization scale and taking\nan arbitrary range to estimate the pQCD uncertainties. This procedure\ninevitably introduces an arbitrary, scheme-dependent theoretical systematic\nerror in the predictions. In this paper, we show that the renormalization scale\nuncertainties for hadronic $Z$ decays can be greatly reduced by applying the\nprinciple of maximum conformality (PMC), a rigorous extension of the BLM\nmethod. The PMC prediction is independent of the choice of renormalization\nscheme; i.e., it respects renormalization group invariance, and thus it\nprovides an optimal and theoretically rigorous method for setting the\nrenormalization scale. We show that the convergence of the pQCD prediction for\nthe $Z$ hadronic width is greatly improved using the PMC since the divergent\nrenormalon series does not appear. The magnitude of the high-order corrections\nquickly approach a steady point. The PMC predictions also have the property\nthat any residual dependence on the choice of initial scale is highly\nsuppressed, even for low-order predictions. Thus, one obtains optimal\nfixed-order predictions for the $Z$-boson hadronic decay rates thus enabling\nhigh precision tests of the Standard Model.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 4 figures"]}]

An outstanding disadvantage of imposing such a restriction on the set\nfunction is that no result is implied for set functions deviating from the\nrestriction, even slightly. A more flexible approach, studied by Feige and\nIzsak, is to design an approximation algorithm whose approximation ratio\ndepends on the complexity of the instance, as measured by some complexity\nmeasure. Specifically, they introduced a complexity measure called supermodular\ndegree, measuring deviation from submodularity, and designed an algorithm for\nthe welfare maximization problem with an approximation ratio that depends on\nthis measure.\n  In this work, we give the first (to the best of our knowledge) algorithm for\nmaximizing an arbitrary monotone set function, subject to a k-extendible\nsystem.

Characterizations of these sets are given, and an\ninclusion relationship is discovered. In the second part, we investigate the\npossible scenarios where spurious solutions occur. We show that when certain\nbimodal Gaussian mixtures distributions are involved, there may exist spurious\nsolutions that are attractive fixed points of FastICA. In this case, popular\nnonlinearities such as \"gauss\" or \"tanh\" tend to yield spurious solutions,\nwhereas only \"kurtosis\" may give reliable results.

The $p+ip$ SC\nstate has an instability towards a potential non-Fermi liquid with a large but\nfinite $U$. However, a small Zeeman field term stabilizes the $p+ip$ SC state.\nRelevant realistic materials are also proposed.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures"]}]

Thus the interplay\nbetween positive and negative relationships in such networks has become an\nimportant research topic. Most recent investigations focus upon edge sign\ninference using structural balance theory or social status theory. Neither of\nthese two theories, however, can explain an observed edge sign well when the\ntwo nodes connected by this edge do not share a common neighbor (e.g., common\nfriend). In this paper we develop a novel approach to handle this situation by\napplying a new model for node types. Initially, we analyze the local node\nstructure in a fully observed signed directed network, inferring underlying\nnode types. The sign of an edge between two nodes must be consistent with their\ntypes; this explains edge signs well even when there are no common neighbors.\nWe show, moreover, that our approach can be extended to incorporate directed\ntriads, when they exist, just as in models based upon structural balance or\nsocial status theory. We compute Bayesian node types within empirical studies\nbased upon partially observed Wikipedia, Slashdot, and Epinions networks in\nwhich the largest network (Epinions) has 119K nodes and 841K edges. Our\napproach yields better performance than state-of-the-art approaches for these\nthree signed directed networks.\n","Comment: To appear in the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in\n  Social Network Analysis and Mining (ASONAM), 2014"]}]
