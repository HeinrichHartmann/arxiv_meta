In the summer of 2014, there was great uncertainty\nabout the answers to several key policy questions concerning the path to\ncontainment. In recent years, epidemic models have been used to guide public\nhealth interventions. But, model-based policy relies on high quality causal\nunderstanding of transmission, including the availability of appropriate\ndynamic transmission models and reliable reporting about the sequence of case\nincidence for model fitting, which were lacking for this epidemic. To\ninvestigate the range of potential transmission scenarios, we developed a\nmulti-type branching process model that incorporates key heterogeneities and\ntime-varying parameters to reflect changing human behavior and deliberate\ninterventions. Ensembles of this model were evaluated at a set of parameters\nthat were both epidemiologically plausible and capable of reproducing the\nobserved trajectory. Results suggest that epidemic outcome depends on both\nhospital capacity and individual behavior. The model predicts that if hospital\ncapacity is not increased soon, then transmission may outpace the rate of\nisolation and the ability to provide care for the ill, infectious, and dying.\nSimilarly, containment will probably require individuals to adopt behaviors\nthat increase the rates of case identification and isolation and secure burial\nof the deceased.

Moreover, the capillary forcing term in the\nDarcy equation is separated from the pressure gradient at the time discrete\nlevel by using an operator-splitting strategy. Thus the computation of the\nnonlinear Cahn-Hilliard equation is completely decoupled from the update of\npressure.

The onset\nof the AFM phase is associated to a metamagnetic transition with a critical\nfield increasing from H{cr}=0 at x~0.55 to ~6Tesla at x=1, coincident with an\nincreasing contribution of the first excited crystal electric field doublet.

It follows that non-unique ergodicity leads to\ndistortion when projecting to the complex of free factors, and we give two\napplications of this fact. First, we show that if a subgroup $H$ of $Out(\\FN)$\nquasi-isometrically embeds into the complex of free factors via the orbit map,\nthen the limit set of $H$ in the boundary of Outer space consists of trees that\nare uniquely ergodic and have uniquely ergodic dual lamination.
