Different from traditional approaches, which directly utilize\n$\\ell_1$ norm to measure the sparseness, LHR introduces a more reasonable\nlog-sum measurement to enhance the sparsity in both the intrinsic low-rank\nstructure and in the sparse corruptions. Although the proposed LHR optimization\nis no longer convex, it still can be effectively solved by a\nmajorization-minimization (MM) type algorithm, with which the non-convex\nobjective function is iteratively replaced by its convex surrogate and LHR\nfinally falls into the general framework of reweighed approaches. We prove that\nthe MM-type algorithm can converge to a stationary point after successive\niteration. We test the performance of our proposed model by applying it to\nsolve two typical problems: robust principal component analysis (RPCA) and\nlow-rank representation (LRR).\n  For RPCA, we compare LHR with the benchmark Principal Component Pursuit (PCP)\nmethod from both the perspectives of simulations and practical applications.\nFor LRR, we apply LHR to compute the low-rank representation matrix for motion\nsegmentation and stock clustering.

This extends the\nidea of a migraine generator region in the brainstem to a larger network and is\nstill simple and explicit enough to open up possibilities for mathematical\nmodeling in the future. In this study, it is suggested that the migraine\ngenerator network (MGN) is driven and may therefore respond differently to\ndifferent spatio-temporal noxious input in the migraine subtypes MWA and MWoA.\nThe noxious input is caused by a cortical perturbation of homeostasis, known as\nspreading depression (SD). The MGN might even trigger SD in the first place by\na failure in vasomotor control. As a consequence, migraine is considered as an\ninherently dynamical disease to which a linear course from upstream to\ndownstream events would not do justice. Minimally invasive and noninvasive\nneuromodulation techniques are briefly reviewed and their rational is discussed\nin the context of the proposed mechanism.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 8 figures, revised version"]}]

Network visualization provides a\nqualitative estimate of functional diversity within a superfamily, but is\nunable to quantitate explicit boundaries, when present, between neighboring\nfamilies in sequence space. This limits the potential of existing\nsequence-based algorithms to generate functional predictions from superfamily\ndatasets.\n  Results: By building on current network analysis tools, we have developed a\nnew algorithm for elucidating pairs of homologous families within a sequence\ndataset. Our algorithm is able to filter through a dense similarity network in\norder to estimate both the boundaries of individual families and also how the\nfamilies neighbor one another. Globally, these neighboring families define a\ntopology across the entire superfamily. The topology is simple to interpret by\nvisualizing the network output generated by our filtration protocol. We have\ncompared the network topology within the kinase superfamily against available\nphylogenetic data. Our results suggest that neighbors within the filtered\nkinase network are more likely to share structural and functional properties\nthan more distant network clusters.\n"]}]

By introducing the\nlow level of random mutation of strategies, we demonstrate that the presence of\nselfish punishment with avoiding mechanism can alleviate the two kinds of\nsocial dilemmas for various parametrizations. In addition, we propose an\nextended pair approximation method, whose solutions can essentially estimate\nthe dynamical behaviors and final evolutionary frequencies of the four\nstrategies. At last, considering the analogy between our model and the\nclassical Lotka-Volterra system, we introduce interaction webs based on the\nspatial replicator dynamics and the transformed payoff matrix to qualitatively\ncharacterize the emergent co-exist strategy phases, and its validity are\nsupported by extensive simulations.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 11 figures, J.

The difficulty lies in the fact that consistency of\noverdetermined systems is not a continuous property. Our certification is based\non hybrid symbolic-numeric methods to compute the exact \"rational univariate\nrepresentation\" (RUR) of a component of the input system from approximate\nroots. For overdetermined polynomial systems with simple roots, we compute an\ninitial RUR from approximate roots. The accuracy of the RUR is increased via\nNewton iterations until the exact RUR is found, which we certify using exact\narithmetic. Since the RUR is well-constrained, we can use it to certify the\ngiven approximate roots using alpha-theory. To certify isolated singular roots,\nwe use a determinantal form of the \"isosingular deflation\", which adds new\npolynomials to the original system without introducing new variables. The\nresulting polynomial system is overdetermined, but the roots are now simple,\nthereby reducing the problem to the overdetermined case.

We conclude that results produced by our\nsector-based factor model are more interpretable than those produced by the\nclassic non-sector-based model for at least some stock sectors.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 6 figures"]}]

This\namounts to solving a linear problem. However, in its original formulation this\nlinear problem has a very large number of linear constraints, too many to be\nenforced in practice. In the literature this is addressed by a reformulation of\nthe problem using so-called dummy variables. This reduces the large number of\nconstraints in the original linear problem at the cost of increasing the number\nof variables. In the context of reinsurance portfolio optimization we observe\nthat the increase in variable count can lead to situations where solving the\nreformulated problem takes a long time. Therefore we suggest a different\napproach. We solve the original linear problem with cutting-plane method: The\nproposed algorithm starts with the solution of a relaxed problem and then\niteratively adds cuts until the solution is approximated within a preset\nthreshold. This is a new approach. For a reinsurance case study we show that a\nsignificant reduction of necessary computer resources can be achieved.\n"]}]

Spectral unmixing problem refers to decomposing mixed\npixels into a set of endmembers and abundance fractions. Due to nonnegativity\nconstraint on abundance fractions, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)\nmethods have been widely used for solving spectral unmixing problem. In this\nletter we proposed using multilayer NMF (MLNMF) for the purpose of\nhyperspectral unmixing. In this approach, spectral signature matrix can be\nmodeled as a product of sparse matrices. In fact MLNMF decomposes the\nobservation matrix iteratively in a number of layers. In each layer, we applied\nsparseness constraint on spectral signature matrix as well as on abundance\nfractions matrix. In this way signatures matrix can be sparsely decomposed\ndespite the fact that it is not generally a sparse matrix. The proposed\nalgorithm is applied on synthetic and real datasets. Synthetic data is\ngenerated based on endmembers from USGS spectral library. AVIRIS Cuprite\ndataset has been used as a real dataset for evaluation of proposed method.\nResults of experiments are quantified based on SAD and AAD measures.

Based on the type of routing for queries among their nodes, they\nare classified into three groups: structured, unstructured and small-world P2P\nnetworks. Each of these categories has its own applications and benefits.\nStructured networks by using Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) can forward request\nsearch queries more efficiency. These networks usually organize a specific\ntopology and make a geometrical shape. A circular topology is a prevalent\ndesign which was first introduced by Chord. In this paper, we propose BSROne, a\ncircular structured P2P design which attempts to consider several shortcomings\nin the current networks. In our proposed method, we want to achieve O(1)\nrouting time without requiring all of the nodes to know about each other. By\nremoving the real connections between nodes and tying all of them with\nsuper-nodes, we gave the network an ability to scale up by introducing one\nlayer above super-nodes. We achieved this by emulating the design of binary\nsearch algorithm for supreme-nodes. In this paper, at first we introduce a\ndesign where fixed super-nodes with unlimited resources are given to the\ndistributed network. In the next step, we explain how it can manage to work as\na P2P application.
