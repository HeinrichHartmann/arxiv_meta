The result of our analysis is that, considering the error of\nthe measured lines, and adopting our best estimate for the coronal EUV\nillumination, the value A(He)=0.075 +/- 0.010 in the chromosphere (for T>6300\nK) and transition region yields reasonably good matches for all the observed\nlines.

An important feature, observed on both laboratory and geophysical\nscale, is that the MHz radiation systematically precedes the kHz one. Yet, the\nlink between an individual EM precursor and a distinctive stage of the EQ\npreparation comprises a crucial open question. A recently proposed two-stage\nmodel on preseismic EM activity suggests that the MHz EM emission is due to the\nfracture of the highly heterogeneous system that surrounds the fault. The\nfinally emerged kHz EM emission is rooted in the final stage of EQ generation,\nnamely, the fracture of entities sustaining the system. In this work we try to\nfurther penetrate and elucidate the link of the precursory kHz EM activity with\nthe last stage of EQ generation building on two theoretical models for EQ\ndynamics. Firstly, the self-affine model states that an EQ is due to the\nslipping of two rough and rigid fractional Brownian profiles, one over the\nother, when there is an intersection between them. Secondly, the\nfragment-asperity model, rooted in a nonextensive Tsallis framework starting\nfrom first principles, consists of two rough profiles interacting via fragments\nfilling the gap. In the latter approach, the mechanism of triggering EQ is\nestablished through the interaction of the irregularities of the fault planes\nand the fragments between them. This paper shows that these models of EQ\ndynamics can be linked with the detected kHz EM emission. In this framework of\nanalysis of preseismic EM activity, we identify sufficient criteria that offer\nthe possibility to discriminate whether a seismic shock is sourced in the\nfracture of fragments filling the gap between the rough profiles or in the\nfracture of \"teeth\" distributed across the fractional Brownian profiles that\nsustain the system.\n"]}]

They suffer, however, from an\ninter-carrier/inter-symbol interference that complicates signal processing\ntasks such as channel estimation. Most of the methods reported thus far rely on\nthe assumption of (almost) flat subchannels to more easily tackle this problem,\naddressing it in a way similar to OFDM. However, this assumption may be often\nquite inaccurate, due to the high freq. selectivity of the channel and/or the\nsmall number of subcarriers employed to cope with frequency dispersion in fast\nfading. In such cases, severe error floors are exhibited at medium to high SNR\nvalues, which cancel the advantage of FBMC over OFDM. Moreover, the existing\nmethods provide estimates of the subchannel responses, most commonly in the\nfrequency domain. The goal of this paper is to revisit this problem through an\nalternative formulation that focuses on the estimation of the channel impulse\nresponse itself and makes no assumption on the degree of frequency selectivity\nof the subchannels. The possible gains in estimation performance offered by\nsuch an approach are investigated through the design of optimal (in the MSE\nsense) preambles, of both the full and sparse types, and of the smallest\npossible duration of only one pilot FBMC symbol. Existing designs for flat\nsubchannels are then shown to result as special cases. Longer preambles,\nconsisting of two consecutive pilot FBMC symbols, are also analyzed.

An equally fundamental\nproperty is the shape of these objects in velocity space which is the\nanisotropy of the global velocity dispersion tensor. Here we make use of\nkinematical data comprising around 600 nearby clusters and rich groups of\ngalaxies from the SDSS to place constraints on the phase-space shapes of these\nobjects, i.e. their shapes in both position and velocity space. We show that\nthe line of sight velocity dispersion normalised by a mass dependent velocity\nscale correlates with the apparent elongation, with circular (elongated)\nclusters exhibiting an excessive (decremental) normalised velocity dispersion.\nThis correlation holds for dynamically young or old clusters and, therefore, it\noriginates from projecting their intrinsic phase-space shapes rather than from\ndynamical evolution. It signifies that clusters are preferentially prolate not\nonly in position space, but also in velocity space. The distribution of the\naxial ratios in position space is found to be well approximated by a Gaussian\nwith a mean 0.66+/-0.01 and a dispersion 0.07+/-0.008. The velocity ellipsoids\nrepresenting the shapes in velocity space are more spherical, with a mean axial\nratio of 0.78+/-0.03. This finding has important implications for mass\nmeasurements based on the line of sight velocity dispersion profiles in\nindividual clusters.

First, we extend traditional definitions\nof network communities by building on the observation that nodes can be densely\ninterlinked in two different ways: In cohesive communities nodes link to each\nother, while in 2-mode communities nodes link in a bipartite fashion, where\nlinks predominate between the two partitions rather than inside them. Our\nmethod successfully detects both 2-mode as well as cohesive communities, that\nmay also overlap or be hierarchically nested. Second, while most existing\ncommunity detection methods treat directed edges as though they were\nundirected, our method accounts for edge directions and is able to identify\nnovel and meaningful community structures in both directed and undirected\nnetworks, using data from social, biological, and ecological domains.\n","Comment: Published in the proceedings of WSDM '14"]}]

The origin of the macroeconomic\ndynamics is therefore found in the granularity induced by the wealth / capital\nof the wealthiest investors. - Economic cycles consist of a Schumpeter\n'creative destruction' pattern whereby the maxima are cusp-shaped while the\nminima are smooth. In between the cusps, the cycle consists of the sum of 2\n'crossing exponentials': one decaying and the other increasing.\n  This unification within the same theoretical framework of short term market\nfluctuations and long term economic cycles offers the perspective of a genuine\nconceptual synthesis between micro- and macroeconomics.

Since quantum behaviour dynamically\nemerges as the lowest complexity level (arXiv:quant-ph/9902016), quantum\ninteraction randomness can only be relatively strong, which reveals the causal\norigin of quantum indeterminacy (arXiv:quant-ph/9511037) and true quantum chaos\n(arXiv:quant-ph/9511035), but rigorously excludes the possibility of unitary\nquantum computation, even in an \"ideal\", noiseless system. Any real computation\nis an internally chaotic (multivalued) process of system complexity development\noccurring in different regimes. Unitary quantum machines, including their\npostulated \"magic\", cannot be realised as such because their dynamically\nsingle-valued scheme is incompatible with the irreducibly high dynamic\nrandomness at quantum complexity levels and should be replaced by explicitly\nchaotic, intrinsically creative machines already realised in living organisms\nand providing their quite different, realistic kind of magic. The related\nconcepts of reality-based, complex-dynamical nanotechnology, biotechnology and\nintelligence are outlined, together with the ensuing change in research\nstrategy. The unreduced, dynamically multivalued solution to the many-body\nproblem reveals the true, complex-dynamical basis of solid-state dynamics,\nincluding the origin and internal dynamics of macroscopic quantum states. The\ncritical, \"end-of-science\" state of unitary knowledge and the way to positive\nchange are causally specified within the same, universal concept of complexity.\n","Comment: 383 pages, 75 eqs, 451 refs; modified format and title, updated\n  references and minor linguistic changes in v5 (published version)"]}]
