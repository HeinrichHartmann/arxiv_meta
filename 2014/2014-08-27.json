Consequently,\nmuch of the extant research on this topic is either model specific or relies on\nweaker notions of equilibria. We consider a modified formulation in which every\nleader is cognizant of the equilibrium constraints of all leaders. Equilibria\nof this modified game contain the equilibria, if any, of the original game. The\nnew formulation has a constraint structure called shared constraints, and our\nmain result shows that if the leader objectives admit a potential function, the\nglobal minimizers of the potential function over the shared constraint are\nequilibria of the modified formulation.

The observed images are related to the high spectral and\nhigh spatial resolution image to be recovered through physical degradations,\ne.g., spatial and spectral blurring and/or subsampling defined by the sensor\ncharacteristics. The fusion problem is formulated within a Bayesian estimation\nframework. An appropriate prior distribution exploiting geometrical\nconsideration is introduced. To compute the Bayesian estimator of the scene of\ninterest from its posterior distribution, a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm\nis designed to generate samples asymptotically distributed according to the\ntarget distribution. To efficiently sample from this high-dimension\ndistribution, a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo step is introduced in the Gibbs\nsampling strategy. The efficiency of the proposed fusion method is evaluated\nwith respect to several state-of-the-art fusion techniques. In particular, low\nspatial resolution hyperspectral and multispectral images are fused to produce\na high spatial resolution hyperspectral image.\n"]}]

Motion proceeds by the nucleation and propagation of\natomic-sized kink pairs susceptible of being studied using molecular dynamics\n(MD). However, MD's natural inability to properly sample thermally-activated\nprocesses as well as to capture $\\{110\\}$ screw dislocation glide calls for the\ndevelopment of other methods capable of overcoming these limitations. Here we\ndevelop a kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) approach to study single screw dislocation\ndynamics from room temperature to $0.5T_m$ and at stresses\n$0<\\sigma<0.9\\sigma_P$, where $T_m$ and $\\sigma_P$ are the melting point and\nthe Peierls stress. The method is entirely parameterized with atomistic\nsimulations using an embedded atom potential for tungsten. To increase the\nphysical fidelity of our simulations, we calculate the deviations from Schmid's\nlaw prescribed by the interatomic potential used and we study single\ndislocation kinetics using both projections. We calculate dislocation\nvelocities as a function of stress, temperature, and dislocation line length.\nWe find that considering non-Schmid effects has a strong influence on both the\nmagnitude of the velocities and the trajectories followed by the dislocation.\nWe finish by condensing all the calculated data into effective stress and\ntemperature dependent mobilities to be used in more homogenized numerical\nmethods.\n"]}]

An outstanding question is which collective\ntopological behaviors of interacting particles are made possible by the Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling. Here we addresses one aspect of this question by exploring\nthe Rashba SU(2) analogues of vortices in superconductors. Using the\nLandau-Ginzburg approach and conservation laws, we classify the prominent\ntwo-dimensional condensates of two- and three-component spin-orbit-coupled\nbosons, and characterize their vortex excitations. There are two prominent\ntypes of condensates that take advantage of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling.\nTheir vortices exist in multiple flavors whose number is determined by the spin\nrepresentation, and interact among themselves through logarithmic or linear\npotentials as a function of distance. The vortices that interact linearly\nexhibit confinement and asymptotic freedom similar to quarks in quantum\nchromodynamics. One of the two condensate types supports small metastable\nneutral quadruplets of vortices, and their tiles as metastable vortex lattices.\nQuantum melting of such vortex lattices could give rise to non-Abelian\nfractional topological insulators, SU(2) analogues of fractional quantum Hall\nstates. The physical systems in which these states could exist are trapped two-\nand three-component bosonic ultra-cold atoms subjected to artificial gauge\nfields, as well as solid-state quantum wells made either from Kondo insulators\nsuch as SmB$_6$ or conventional topological insulators interfaced with\nconventional superconductors.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 8 figures"]}]

Evidence of CDW formation is found for\n0.45<x<0.93, but not for samples with x<0.44 that exhibit incommensurate\nspin-density-wave order, and in slightly overdoped samples with x=0.99. This\nsuggests the presence of two proximate zero-temperature CDW critical points at\ndoping pc1~0.08 and pc2~0.18. The CDW reflections are observed at\nincommensurate in-plane wave vectors (d_a, 0) and (0, d_b). Both decrease\nlinearly with increasing doping, in agreement with recent reports on Bi-based\nhigh-Tc superconductors, but in sharp contrast to the behavior of the 214\nfamily. The CDW intensity and correlation length exhibit maxima at p~0.12,\ncoincident with a plateau in the superconducting transition temperature Tc. The\nonset temperature of the CDW reflections depends non-monotonically on p, with a\nmaximum of~160 K for p~0.12. The RXS reflections exhibit a uniaxial intensity\nanisotropy. We further observe a depression of CDW correlations upon cooling\nbelow Tc, and (for samples with p> 0.09) an enhancement of the signal when an\nexternal magnetic field up to 6 T is applied in the superconducting state. For\nsamples with p~0.08, where prior work has revealed a field-enhancement of\nincommensurate magnetic order, the RXS signal is field-independent. This\nsupports a previously suggested scenario in which incommensurate charge and\nspin orders compete against each other, in addition to individually competing\nagainst.

Test\noracle performs an important role in software testing. The focus in this\nresearch is to perform class level test by introducing a testing framework. A\ntechnique is developed to generate test oracle for specification-based software\ntesting using Vienna Development Method (VDM++) formal language. A three stage\ntranslation process, of VDM++ specifications of container classes to C++ test\noracle classes, is described in this paper. It is also presented that how\nderived test oracle is integrated into a proposed functional testing framework.\nThis technique caters object oriented features such as inheritance and\naggregation, but concurrency is not considered in this work. Translation\nissues, limitations and evaluation of the technique are also discussed. The\nproposed approach is illustrated with the help of popular triangle problem case\nstudy.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 1 figure"]}]

We derive a new\nnon-adiabatic-Boussinesq (NAB) expression for the modified Brunt-Vaisala\nfrequency $(\\omega_b)$, without considering the adiabatic compressibility\ncondition of OB approach.

Here $\\eta$ is the ratio of\nhydrostatic density to the total density. We perform numerical experiments of\nCI for the conditionally stable troposphere i.e for the troposphere that has\nthe environmental lapse rate negative but smaller than the adiabatic lapse\nrate. A novel feature of the present study is that the CI grows under proposed\nNAB approach in spite the conditionally stable condition and remains suppressed\nunder OB approach.
