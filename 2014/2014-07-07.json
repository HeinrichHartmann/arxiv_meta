Triangles can have\nimportant interpretations in real-world graphs, especially social and other\ninteraction networks. Despite the lack of provably efficient (linear, or\nslightly super-linear) worst-case algorithms for this problem, practitioners\nrun simple, efficient heuristics to find all triangles in graphs with millions\nof vertices. How are these heuristics exploiting the structure of these special\ngraphs to provide major speedups in running time?\n  We study one of the most prevalent algorithms used by practitioners. A\ntrivial algorithm enumerates all paths of length $2$, and checks if each such\npath is incident to a triangle. A good heuristic is to enumerate only those\npaths of length $2$ where the middle vertex has the lowest degree. It is easily\nimplemented and is empirically known to give remarkable speedups over the\ntrivial algorithm.\n  We study the behavior of this algorithm over graphs with heavy-tailed degree\ndistributions, a defining feature of real-world graphs. The erased\nconfiguration model (ECM) efficiently generates a graph with asymptotically\n(almost) any desired degree sequence.

Thus, the narrowest\npart of the neck, associated with the shortest nontrivial closed geodesic of\nthe surface, has the highest curvature and is the fastest-moving. Just before\nonset of the instability there exists on the stable surface a shortest closed\ngeodesic, which is the initial condition for evolution of the neck's geodesics,\nall of which have the same topological relationship to the frame. We make the\nplausible conjectures that if the initial geodesic is linked to the boundary\nthen the singularity will occur at the boundary, whereas if the two are\nunlinked initially then the singularity will occur in the bulk.

Working with publicly available EEG database, we put our scheme to\nexperiment and illustrate that if it is only a matter of estimating the\nfrequency content of the signal in various EEG bands, then all the channels\nneed not be recorded. We have achieved an average error below 15% between the\noriginal and reconstructed signals with respect to estimation of the spectral\ncontent in the delta, theta and alpha bands.
