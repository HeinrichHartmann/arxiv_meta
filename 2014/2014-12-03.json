Moreover, we modify the probability distribution used in\nthe technique to achieve better running time; in particular, this gives an\nimprovement from $2^{2^{O(k)}}$ to $2^{O(k^2)}$ in the parameter dependence of\nthe Directed Multiway Cut algorithm of Chitnis et al.

As a result, the slope in the\nage-metallicity relation flattens significantly at Galactic radii larger than\nsolar. The radial metallicity and [Mg/Fe] gradients in our model show\nsignificant variations with height above the plane due to changes in the\nmixture of stellar ages. An inversion in the radial metallicity gradient is\nfound from negative to weakly positive (at r<10 kpc), and from positive to\nnegative for the [Mg/Fe] gradient, with increasing distance from the disk\nplane. We relate this to the combined effect of (i) the predominance of young\nstars close to the disk plane and old stars away from it, (ii) the more\nconcentrated older stellar component, and (iii) the flaring of mono-age disk\npopulations.

Circumstellar disks are known to contain a significant mass in dust\nranging from micron to centimeter size. Meteorites are evidence that individual\ngrains of those sizes were collected and assembled into planetesimals in the\nyoung solar system. Aims. We assess the efficiency of dust collection of a\nswarm of non-drifting planetesimals {\\rev with radii ranging from 1 to\n$10^3$\\,km and beyond. Methods. We calculate the collision probability of dust\ndrifting in the disk due to gas drag by planetesimal accounting for several\nregimes depending on the size of the planetesimal, dust, and orbital distance:\nthe geometric, Safronov, settling, and three-body regimes. We also include a\nhydrodynamical regime to account for the fact that small grains tend to be\ncarried by the gas flow around planetesimals. Results. We provide expressions\nfor the collision probability of dust by planetesimals and for the filtering\nefficiency by a swarm of planetesimals. For standard turbulence conditions\n(i.e., a turbulence parameter $\\alpha=10^{-2}$), filtering is found to be\ninefficient, meaning that when crossing a minimum-mass solar nebula (MMSN) belt\nof planetesimals extending between 0.1 AU and 35 AU most dust particles are\neventually accreted by the central star rather than colliding with\nplanetesimals. However, if the disk is weakly turbulent ($\\alpha=10^{-4}$)\nfiltering becomes efficient in two regimes: (i) when planetesimals are all\nsmaller than about 10 km in size, in which case collisions mostly take place in\nthe geometric regime; and (ii) when planetary embryos larger than about 1000 km\nin size dominate the distribution, have a scale height smaller than one tenth\nof the gas scale height, and dust is of millimeter size or larger in which case\nmost collisions take place in the settling regime. These two regimes have very\ndifferent properties: we find that the local filtering efficiency\n$x_{filter,MMSN}$ scales with $r^{-7/4}$ (where $r$ is the orbital distance) in\nthe geometric regime, but with $r^{-1/4}$ to $r^{1/4}$ in the settling regime.\nThis implies that the filtering of dust by small planetesimals should occur\nclose to the central star and with a short spread in orbital distances. On the\nother hand, the filtering by embryos in the settling regime is expected to be\nmore gradual and determined by the extent of the disk of embryos. Dust\nparticles much smaller than millimeter size tend only to be captured by the\nsmallest planetesimals because they otherwise move on gas streamlines and their\ncollisions take place in the hydrodynamical regime. Conclusions. Our results\nhint at an inside-out formation of planetesimals in the infant solar system\nbecause small planetesimals in the geometrical limit can filter dust much more\nefficiently close to the central star. However, even a fully-formed belt of\nplanetesimals such as the MMSN only marginally captures inward-drifting dust\nand this seems to imply that dust in the protosolar disk has been filtered by\nplanetesimals even smaller than 1 km (not included in this study) or that it\nhas been assembled into planetesimals by other mechanisms (e.g., orderly\ngrowth, capture into vortexes).

The results of this work\nshow that considering CO isotopologue ratios as constants can lead to an\nunderestimate of disk masses by up to almost two orders of magnitude if grains\nhave grown to larger sizes.

The\nmotivation comes from studies of human brain development, in which $t$ denotes\nage whereas $s$ refers to brain locations. Analogously to varying-coefficient\nmodels, in which the mean response is linear in $t$, the \"varying-smoother\"\nmodels that we consider exhibit nonlinear dependence on $t$ that varies\nsmoothly with $s$. We discuss three approaches to estimating varying-smoother\nmodels: (a) methods that employ a tensor product penalty; (b) an approach based\non smoothed functional principal component scores; and (c) two-step methods\nconsisting of an initial smooth with respect to $t$ at each $s$, followed by a\npostprocessing step. For the first approach, we derive an exact expression for\na penalty proposed by Wood, and an adaptive penalty that allows smoothness to\nvary more flexibly with $s$.

Clinically,\nit is a challenge to determine whether resistance arises prior to, or as a\nresult of, cancer therapy. Further, a number of different intracellular and\nmicroenvironmental factors have been correlated with the emergence of drug\nresistance. With the goal of better understanding drug resistance and its\nconnection with the tumor microenvironment, we have developed a hybrid\ndiscrete-continuous mathematical model. In this model, cancer cells described\nthrough a particle-spring approach respond to dynamically changing oxygen and\nDNA damaging drug concentrations described through partial differential\nequations. We thoroughly explored the behavior of our self-calibrated model\nunder the following common conditions: a fixed layout of the vasculature, an\nidentical initial configuration of cancer cells, the same mechanism of drug\naction, and one mechanism of cellular response to the drug. We considered one\nset of simulations in which drug resistance existed prior to the start of\ntreatment, and another set in which drug resistance is acquired in response to\ntreatment. This allows us to compare how both kinds of resistance influence the\nspatial and temporal dynamics of the developing tumor, and its clonal\ndiversity.

Its 2500\nscintillator strips have a Gd loaded reflective cover. Light is collected with\n3 wave length shifting fibers per strip and read out with 50 PMTs and 2500\nSiPMs. The DANSS will be installed under the industrial 3GW$_{th}$ reactor of\nthe Kalinin Nuclear Power Plant at distances varying from 9.7m to 12.2m from\nthe reactor core. PMTs and SiPMs collect about 30 photo electrons per MeV\ndistributed approximately equally between two types of the readout. Light\ncollection non-uniformity across and along the strip is about $\\pm13\\%$ from\nmaximum to minimum. The resulting energy resolution is modest, $\\sigma/E=15\\%$\nat 5MeV. This leads to a smearing of the oscillation pattern comparable with\nthe smearing due to the large size of the reactor core. Nevertheless because of\nthe large counting rate ($\\sim 10000$ / day), small background ($<1\\%$) and\ngood control of systematic uncertainties due to frequent changes of positions,\nthe DANSS is quite sensitive to reactor antineutrino oscillations to\nhypothetical sterile neutrinos with a mass in eV ballpark suggested recently to\nexplain a so-called \"reactor anomaly\".

Yet it has remained unsolved whether the oligomers\nare a necessary step in the formation of amyloid fibrils, or just a dangerous\nby-product. Analogously, it has not been resolved if the amyloid nucleation\nprocess is a classical one-step nucleation process, or a two-step process\ninvolving pre-nucleation clusters. We use coarse-grained computer simulations\nto study the effect of non-specific attractions between peptides on the primary\nnucleation process underlying amyloid fibrillization. We find that for peptides\nthat do not attract, the classical one-step nucleation mechanism is possible,\nbut only at non-physiologically high peptide concentrations. At low peptide\nconcentrations, which mimic the physiologically relevant regime, attractive\ninter-peptide interactions are essential for fibril formation. Nucleation then\ninevitably takes place through a two-step mechanism involving prefibrillar\noligomers. We show that oligomers not only help peptides meet each other, but\ncreate an environment that facilitates the conversion of monomers into the\n$\\beta$-sheet rich form characteristic of fibrils. Nucleation typically does\nnot proceed via the most prevalent oligomers, but via an oligomer size that is\nonly observed in rare fluctuations, which is why such aggregates might be hard\nto capture experimentally. Finally, we find that the nucleation of amyloid\nfibrils cannot be described by classical nucleation theory: in the two-step\nmechanism the critical nucleus size increases both with an increase in\nconcentration and in the inter-peptide interactions, in direct contrast with\npredictions from classical nucleation theory.\n"]}]

Accurate representation of these urban\ninfrastructural features is critical in terms of sub-grid modeling, because it\nuniquely affects the fluid flux through each grid cell side, which ultimately\ndetermines the water depth and extent of flooding via distribution of water\nvolume within each grid cell. Incorporation of buildings and highway\nunderpasses allow for the model to improve overall absolute mean distance error\nmetrics from 38m to 32m and area comparisons from 75% spatial match to 80% with\nminimal additional effort.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 10 Figures, 5 Tables"]}]

The solution to this\nequation can describe a steady state of the process of anomalous diffusion. The\nprocess arises from interactions within complex and non-homogeneous background.\nWe present a numerical method which is based on the finite differences method.\nWe consider a boundary value problem (Dirichlet conditions) for an equation\nwith the Riesz-Feller fractional derivative.
