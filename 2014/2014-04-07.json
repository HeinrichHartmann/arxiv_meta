The starting point of our perturbative expansion is a\nzeroth-order Hamiltonian for an electron confined in a quantum wire with an\neffective spin-orbit induced magnetic field along the wire, obtained by\nproperly rotating the usual spin-orbit Hamiltonian. We find that the\nspin-orbit-related transverse coupling terms can be recast into two parts W and\nV, which couple crossing and non-crossing adjacent transverse modes,\nrespectively. Interestingly, the zeroth-order Hamiltonian together with W can\nbe solved exactly, as it maps onto the Jaynes-Cummings model of quantum optics.\nWe treat the V coupling by performing a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation. This\nallows us to obtain an effective Hamiltonian to third order in the coupling\nstrength k_Rl of V, which can be straightforwardly diagonalized via an\nadditional unitary transformation. We also apply our approach to other types of\neffective parabolic confinement, e.g., 2D electrons in a perpendicular magnetic\nfield. To demonstrate the usefulness of our approximate eigensolutions, we\nobtain analytical expressions for the n^th Landau-level g_n-factors in the\npresence of both Rashba and Dresselhaus couplings. For small values of the bulk\ng-factors, we find that spin-orbit effects cancel out entirely for particular\nvalues of the spin-orbit couplings. By solving simple transcendental equations\nwe also obtain the band minima of a Rashba-coupled quantum wire as a function\nof an external magnetic field.

We assume a self-similar process (e.g. Levy process, fractional\nBrownian motion or fractal process) and define a new risk measure, the\np-variation, which reduces to the variance if the process is a brownian motion.\nWe deduce the explicit formula for the TC and IS algorithms under a\nself-similar process. We show that there is an equivalence between selfsimilar\nmodels and a family of risk measures called p-variations: assuming a\nself-similar process and calibrating empirically the parameter p for the\np-variation yields the same result as assuming a Brownian motion and using the\np-variation as risk measure instead of the variance. We also show that p can be\nseen as a measure of the aggressiveness: p increases if and only if the TC\nalgorithm starts later and executes faster. Finally, we show how the parameter\np of the p-variation can be implied from the optimal starting time of TC, and\nthat under this framework p can be viewed as a measure of the joint impact of\nmarket impact (i.e. liquidity) and volatility.\n","Comment: 27 pages"]}]

Valiant (2012) considered evolvability of real-valued\nfunctions and also showed that weak-optimization algorithms that use\nweak-evaluation oracles could be converted to evolutionary mechanisms.\n  In this work, we focus on the complexity of representations of evolutionary\nmechanisms. In general, the reductions of Feldman and P. Valiant may result in\nintermediate representations that are arbitrarily complex (polynomial-sized\ncircuits). We argue that biological constraints often dictate that the\nrepresentations have low complexity, such as constant depth and fan-in\ncircuits. We give mechanisms for evolving sparse linear functions under a large\nclass of smooth distributions. These evolutionary algorithms are\nattribute-efficient in the sense that the size of the representations and the\nnumber of generations required depend only on the sparsity of the target\nfunction and the accuracy parameter, but have no dependence on the total number\nof attributes.\n"]}]

The particles in each bin\nare represented by a dummy particle at the center of mass of the original\nparticle distribution and with a state vector that is the average of the states\nof all particles in the same bin.

We derive upper bounds on the approximation error of the\nso-obtained piecewise constant function representation, and analyze how bin\nsize affects tracking accuracy and runtime. Further, we show numerically that\nthe ASIR approximation error converges to that of sequential importance\nsampling/resampling (SIR) as the bin size is decreased.

This is done by\nassuming that a residual symmetry $S_\\nu$ appropriate for describing a massless\nneutrino is contained in $G_f$. It is shown that all the groups $G_f$ admitting\nthree dimensional faithful irreducible representation and generated from a\nspecific set of $3\\times 3$ matrices imply only one of the three flavour\ncompositions for the massless state namely, unmixed, maximally mixed with equal\nprobabilities and bimaximally mixed with probabilities (0,1/2,1/2) and their\npermutations.

We use hybrid Sigma_SFR maps (GALEX FUV plus Spitzer 24 mu),\nRC maps at 22/18 cm from the WSRT SINGS survey, and H-alpha maps to correct for\nthermal RC emission. We compare azimuthally averaged radial profiles of the RC\nand FUV/MIR-based Sigma_SFR maps and study pixel-by-pixel correlations at fixed\nlinear scales of 1.2 and 0.7 kpc. The ratio of the integrated SFRs from the RC\nemission to that of the FUV/MIR-based SF tracers is R_int = 0.78 +/- 0.38,\nconsistent with Condon's relation. We find a tight correlation between the\nradial profiles of the radio and FUV/MIR-based Sigma_SFR for the entire extent\nof the disk. The ratio R of the azimuthally averaged radio to FUV/MIR-based\nSigma_SFR agrees with the integrated ratio with only small quasi-random\nfluctuations as function of radius.

This paper\naddresses the following question: What if team A wants to game the system? Can\nit gain an advantage by putting its players in a different order?\n  The first example of this problem in history (to the author's knowledge) was\na match of three horse races between the King of Qi and general Tian Ji, in\nChina, in the fourth century B.C. Tian Ji's protege, Sun Bin, advised the\ngeneral to throw the first race, running his #3 horse against the king's #1,\nand then to race his #1 horse against the king's #2 and his #2 horse against\nthe king's #3. In this way, Tian Ji won the match, 2-1, and Sun Bin ensured his\nreputation as a great strategist.\n  The paper introduces a card-game version of this puzzle, called One Round\nWar, and derives the optimal strategy in case each side has N cards (the\nanalogue of N horses). The problem is recast as a linear assignment problem.\nThe optimal solution involves sacrificing the weakest k cards/horses (for some\nk = k(N)) against the opponent's strongest k in reverse order (weakest vs.\nstrongest), and then playing the remaining N-k cards/horses against the\nopponent's remaining cards in forward order. An exact formula is derived for\nk(N), and asymptotically we show that k(N) ~ sqrt (N ln N/2).\n  Note: This paper proves that the strategy described above is optimal for\nsufficiently large N (e.g., for N greater than 10^7). It has also been verified\nby computer to be optimal for N less than 60. We conjecture that it is also\ntrue for N between 60 and 10^7.

Our method uses\nclassical results in complex symplectic geometry and some results from\narXiv:1304.4508. The algebraic version of our result has already been obtained\nby the author et al. in arXiv:1211.3259 using different methods, where we used,\nin particular, the recent new theory of algebraic d-critical loci introduced by\nJoyce in arXiv:1304.4508. This resolves a long-standing question in the\ncategorification of Lagrangian intersection numbers and it may have important\nconsequences in symplectic geometry and topological field theory.\n  Our second main result proves that (oriented) complex Lagrangian\nintersections in complex symplectic manifolds for any pair of Lagrangian\nsubmanifolds in the complex analytic topology carry the structure of (oriented)\nanalytic d-critical loci in the sense of arXiv:1304.4508.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1211.3259"]}]
