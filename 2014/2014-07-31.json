We consider a\nfamily of integrable hard-core lattice anyon models that continuously\ninterpolates between noninteracting spinless fermions and strongly interacting\nhard-core bosons. A generalized Jordan-Wigner transformation maps the entire\nfamily to noninteracting fermions. We find that, aside from the singular\nfree-fermion limit, the entire single-particle density matrix and therefore all\none-body observables relax to the predictions of the generalized Gibbs ensemble\n(GGE). This demonstrates that, in the presence of interactions, correlations\nbetween particles in the many-body wave function provide the effective\ndissipation required to drive relaxation of all one-body observables to the\nGGE. This relaxation does not depend on translational invariance, or the\ntracing out of any spatial domain of the system.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures, plus supplementary material (6 pages, 4 figures).\n  v2: Text shortened, and other minor revisions.

The differences between\nstrengthless material models and including the full elasto-plastic model for\nsolid bodies with brittle failure and fragmentation when treating collisions of\nasteroid-sized bodies as they occur frequently in early planetary systems are\ndemonstrated.

We study impacts of bodies of Ceres-mass with a solid\nrock impactor and a target with 30 weight-% water content as surface ice.} The\ninitial impact velocities and impact parameters are varied between the escape\nvelocity $v_\\mathrm{esc}$ to about 6 $v_\\mathrm{esc}$ and from head-on\ncollisions to close fly-bys, respectively.

In contrast to other three-dimensional (3D)\ntopological insulators (e.g. Bi2Se3), a TKI is truly insulating in the bulk\n[4]. Furthermore, strong electron correlations are present in the system, which\nmay interact with the novel topological phase. Applying spin- and\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SARPES) to the Kondo insulator SmB6,\na promising TKI candidate, we reveal that the surface states of SmB6 are spin\npolarized, and the spin is locked to the crystal momentum. Counter-propagating\nstates (i.e. at k and -k) have opposite spin polarizations protected by\ntime-reversal symmetry. Together with the odd number of Fermi surfaces of\nsurface states between the 4 time-reversal invariant momenta in the surface\nBrillouin zone [5], these findings prove, for the first time, that SmB6 can\nhost non-trivial topological surface states in a full insulating gap in the\nbulk stemming from the Kondo effect. Hence our experimental results establish\nthat SmB6 is the first realization of a 3D TKI. It can also serve as an ideal\nplatform for the systematic study of the interplay between novel topological\nquantum states with emergent effects and competing order induced by strongly\ncorrelated electrons.\n","Comment: 4 figures"]}]
