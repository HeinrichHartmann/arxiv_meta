We prove strong generic regularity results\nwhich imply (for bundles with \"odd\" first Chern class) the existence of a\nconnected, dense open set of \"good\" metrics for which all the reductions in the\nUhlenbeck compactification of the moduli space are simultaneously regular.\nThese results can be used to define new Donaldson type invariants for definite\n4-manifolds. The idea behind this construction is to notice that, for a good\nmetric $g$, the geometry of the instanton moduli spaces around the reduction\nloci is always the same, independently of the choice of $g$. The connectedness\nof the space of good metrics is important, in order to prove that no\nwall-crossing phenomena (jumps of invariants) occur.

Using it we give new proofs and\nsubstantially extend a number of classical results concerning the combinatorics\nof the chromatic polynomial.

The new viewpoint presented here explains that\nTutte's identity is special to these values of the parameter Q. A natural\ncontext for analyzing such properties of the chromatic polynomial is provided\nby the {\\em chromatic algebra}, whose Markov trace is the chromatic polynomial\nof an associated graph.

Whyte proved a geometric\nversion of the von Neumann Conjecture by showing that a finitely generated\ngroup is non-amenable if and only if it admits a translation-like action by any\n(equivalently every) non-abelian free group.

Stars\ncrossing this radius can move from orbiting the cluster centre to independently\norbiting the galaxy. In this paper, the stability radius of a globular cluster\nis estimated using a novel approach from the theoretical standpoint of the\ngeneral three-body problem. This is achieved by an analytical formula for the\ntransition radius between stable and unstable orbits in a globular cluster. A\nstability analysis, outlined by Mardling, is used here to predict the\noccurrence of unstable stellar orbits in the outermost region of a globular\ncluster in a distant orbit around a galaxy. It is found that the eccentricity\nof the cluster-galaxy orbit has a far more significant effect on the stability\nradius of globular clusters than previous theoretical results of the tidal\nradius have found. A simple analytical formula is given for determining the\ntransition between stable and unstable orbits, which is analogous to the tidal\nradius for a globular cluster. The stability radius estimate is interior to\ntidal radius estimates and gives the innermost region from which stars can\nrandom walk to their eventual escape from the cluster. The time-scale for this\nrandom walk process is also estimated using numerical three-body scattering\nexperiments.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 9 figures, MNRAS in press"]}]

An efficient novelty detection algorithm can\nsave the user a great deal of time and resources when browsing through relevant\nyet usually previously-seen content. Most of the recent research on detection\nof novel documents in text streams has been building upon either geometric\ndistances or distributional similarities, with the former typically performing\nbetter but being much slower due to the need of comparing an incoming document\nwith all the previously-seen ones. In this paper, we propose a new approach to\nnovelty detection in text streams.

It appears from work with\nCCD cameras at the 1.55 m astrometric reflector in Flagstaff that an accuracy\nof 1 mas is the best possible from the ground during one night observing when\nusing ordinary telescopes, i.e. without wave-front correctors, and for field\nsizes larger than 2 arcmin. It has been seen that the same accuracies can be\nreached with the much larger 4-m class telescope on Hawaii although it is not\nspecifically designed for astrometry. The accuracy of 1 mas from the ground\nrefers mainly to non-moving point sources, but it is expected that 1 mas can be\nreached from the ground for solar system bodies from many nights of\nobservations when phase effects are taken into account.\n","Comment: 5 pages.

The temporal\nfluctuations around stationary values exhibit universal power-law decay in\ntime, with an exponent set by the localization length and the diagonal entropy\nof the initial state. Such a power-law decay holds for any local observable and\nis related to the logarithmic in time growth of entanglement in the MBL phase.\nThis behaviour distinguishes the MBL phase from both the Anderson insulator\n(where no stationary state is reached), and from the ergodic phase (where\nrelaxation is expected to be exponential).

The physical objective as a functional of the field\nforms the quantum control landscape, whose topology, under certain conditions,\nhas been shown to contain no critical point suboptimal traps, thereby enabling\neffective searches for fields that give the global maximum of the objective.\nThis paper addresses the structure of the landscape as a complement to\ntopological critical point features. Recent work showed that landscape\nstructure is highly favorable for optimization of state-to-state transition\nprobabilities, in that gradient-based control trajectories to the global\nmaximum value are nearly straight paths. The landscape structure is codified in\nthe metric $R\\geq 1.0$, defined as the ratio of the length of the control\ntrajectory to the Euclidean distance between the initial and optimal controls.\nA value of $R=1$ would indicate an exactly straight trajectory to the optimal\nobservable value.

However, the interplay of\noptimization trajectories with critical saddle submanifolds is found to\ninfluence landscape structure. A fundamental relationship necessary for\nperfectly straight gradient-based control trajectories is derived wherein the\ngradient on the quantum control landscape must be an eigenfunction of the\nHessian.

We\ndescribe here a new method using time-delay lensed quasars where one or several\nimages are affected by microlensing due to stars in the lensing galaxy. Because\nmicrolensing decreases (or increases) the flux of the continuum compared to the\nbroad line region, it changes the contrast between these two emission\ncomponents. We show that this effect can be used to effectively disentangle the\nintrinsic variability of those two regions, offering the opportunity to perform\nreverberation mapping based on single band photometric data. Based on simulated\nlight curves generated using a damped random walk model of quasar variability,\nwe show that measurement of the size of the broad line region can be achieved\nusing this method, provided one spectrum has been obtained independently during\nthe monitoring. This method is complementary to photometric reverberation\nmapping and could also be extended to multi-band data. Because the effect\ndescribed above produces a variability pattern in difference light curves\nbetween pairs of lensed images which is correlated with the time-lagged\ncontinuum variability, it can potentially produce systematic errors in\nmeasurement of time delays between pairs of lensed images. Simple simulations\nindicate that time-delay measurement techniques which use a sufficiently\nflexible model for the extrinsic variability are not affected by this effect\nand produce accurate time delays.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics"]}]

The discussion here is restricted to the Galactic\nsynchrotron radiation, the most dominant foreground component after point\nsource removal. Our theoretical analysis is validated using simulations at 150\nMHz, mainly for GMRT and also briefly for LOFAR. The Bare Estimator uses\npairwise correlations of the measured visibilities, while the Tapered Gridded\nEstimator uses the visibilities after gridding in the uv plane. The former is\nvery precise, but computationally expensive for large data. The latter has a\nlower precision, but takes less computation time which is proportional to the\ndata volume. The latter also allows tapering of the sky response leading to\nsidelobe suppression, an useful ingredient for foreground removal. Both\nestimators avoid the positive bias that arises due to the system noise. We\nconsider amplitude and phase errors of the gain, and the w-term as possible\nsources of errors . We find that the estimated angular power spectrum is\nexponentially sensitive to the variance of the phase errors but insensitive to\namplitude errors. The statistical uncertainties of the estimators are affected\nby both amplitude and phase errors. The w-term does not have a significant\neffect at the angular scales of our interest.

Ultraviolet radiation plays a crucial role in molecular clouds.\nRadiation and matter are tightly coupled and their interplay influences the\nphysical and chemical properties of gas. In particular, modeling the radiation\npropagation requires calculating column densities, which can be numerically\nexpensive in high-resolution multidimensional simulations. Aims. Developing\nfast methods for estimating column densities is mandatory if we are interested\nin the dynamical influence of the radiative transfer. In particular, we focus\non the effect of the UV screening on the dynamics and on the statistical\nproperties of molecular clouds. Methods. We have developed a tree-based method\nfor a fast estimate of column densities, implemented in the adaptive mesh\nrefinement code RAMSES. We performed numerical simulations using this method in\norder to analyze the influence of the screening on the clump formation.\nResults. We find that the accuracy for the extinction of the tree-based method\nis better than 10%, while the relative error for the column density can be much\nmore. We describe the implementation of a method based on precalculating the\ngeometrical terms that noticeably reduces the calculation time. To study the\ninfluence of the screening on the statistical properties of molecular clouds we\npresent the probability distribution function (PDF) of gas and the associated\ntemperature per density bin and the mass spectra for different density\nthresholds. Conclusions. The tree-based method is fast and accurate enough to\nbe used during numerical simulations since no communication is needed between\nCPUs when using a fully threaded tree. It is then suitable to parallel\ncomputing. We show that the screening for far UV radiation mainly affects the\ndense gas, thereby favoring low temperatures and affecting the fragmentation.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 20 figures"]}]

We further apply the method to\nexperimental data from retinal ganglion cells of mouse and salamander, in which\nwe identify cell-groups that correspond to known functional types, and to\nhippocampal recordings from rats exploring a linear track, where we detect\nplace cells with high fidelity.\n  Conclusions: We present a versatile method to detect neural assemblies in\nspiking data applicable across a spectrum of relevant scales that contributes\nto understanding spatio-temporal information gathered from systems neuroscience\nexperiments.\n","Comment: 18 pages; 13 Figures; published as open access in J Neuro Methods"]}]

However, using wireless sensor networks to\nestimate fire weather indices is a challenge due to data quality issues, lack\nof standard data formats and lack of agreement on thresholds and methods for\ncalculating fire weather indices. Within the scope of this paper, we propose a\nstandardized approach to calculating Fire Weather Indices (a.k.a. fire danger\nratings) and overcome a number of the challenges by applying Semantic Web\nTechnologies to the processing of data streams from a wireless sensor network\ndeployed in the Springbrook region of South East Queensland. This paper\ndescribes the underlying ontologies, the semantic reasoning and the Semantic\nFire Weather Index (SFWI) system that we have developed to enable domain\nexperts to specify and adapt rules for calculating Fire Weather Indices. We\nalso describe the Web-based mapping interface that we have developed, that\nenables users to improve their understanding of how fire weather indices vary\nover time within a particular region.Finally, we discuss our evaluation results\nthat indicate that the proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art techniques\nin terms of accuracy, precision and query performance.\n","Comment: 20pages, 12 figures"]}]

In particular, the explicit relational\nstructure implies that network data is not i.i.d. data. Network data also often\ncomes with significant metadata (i.e., attributes) associated with each entity\n(node). Moreover, due to the diversity and variation in network data (e.g.,\nmulti-relational links or multi-category entities), various tasks can be\nperformed and often a rich correlation exists between them. Learning algorithms\nshould exploit all of these additional sources of information for better\nperformance. In this work we take a metric-learning point of view for the MTL\nproblem in the network context. Our approach builds on structure preserving\nmetric learning (SPML). In particular SPML learns a Mahalanobis distance metric\nfor node attributes using network structure as supervision, so that the learned\ndistance function encodes the structure and can be used to predict link\npatterns from attributes. SPML is described for single-task learning on single\nnetwork. Herein, we propose a multi-task version of SPML, abbreviated as\nMT-SPML, which is able to learn across multiple related tasks on multiple\nnetworks via shared intermediate parametrization. MT-SPML learns a specific\nmetric for each task and a common metric for all tasks. The task correlation is\ncarried through the common metric and the individual metrics encode task\nspecific information. When combined together, they are structure-preserving\nwith respect to individual tasks. MT-SPML works on general networks, thus is\nsuitable for a wide variety of problems. In experiments, we challenge MT-SPML\non two real-word problems, where MT-SPML achieves significant improvement.\n"]}]

Two such approaches, using different techniques that exploit each of\nthese properties, have previously been published, and show promising results\nfrom both simulation and experimental data for the detection of shielded high-Z\nmaterials and density variations from volcanic assay. Both detector systems are\nbased on scintillator and photomultiplier technologies. Results from dedicated\nsimulation studies using both these technologies and image reconstruction\ntechniques are presented for an intermediate-sized nuclear waste storage\nfacility filled with concrete and an array of uranium samples. Both results\nhighlight the potential to identify uranium objects of varying thicknesses\ngreater than 5cm within real-time durations of several weeks. Increased\ncontributions from Coulomb scattering within the concrete of the structure\nhinder the ability of both approaches to resolve objects of 2cm dimensions even\nwith increased statistics. These results are all dependent on both the position\nof the objects within the facility and the locations of the detectors. Results\nfor differing thicknesses of concrete, which reflect the unknown composition of\nthe structures under interrogation, are also presented alongside studies\nperformed for a series of data collection durations.

Roughly speaking, this rational presentation of\nthe Kontsevich integral would sum formal power series into rational functions\nwith prescribed denominators. Rozansky's conjecture was soon proven by the\nsecond author. We begin our paper by reviewing Rozansky's conjecture and the\nmain ideas that lead to its proof. The natural question of extending this\nconjecture to links leads to the class of boundary links, and a proof of\nRozansky's conjecture in this case. A subtle issue is the fact that a `hair'\nmap which replaces beads by the exponential of hair is not 1-1. This raises the\nquestion of whether a rational invariant of boundary links exists in an\nappropriate space of trivalent graphs whose edges are decorated by rational\nfunctions in noncommuting variables. A main result of the paper is to construct\nsuch an invariant, using the so-called surgery view of boundary links and after\ndeveloping a formal diagrammatic Gaussian integration.\n  Since our invariant is one of many rational forms of the Kontsevich integral,\none may ask if our invariant is in some sense canonical. We prove that this is\nindeed the case, by axiomatically characterizing our invariant as a universal\nfinite type invariant of boundary links with respect to the null move.

We show that if X is\n`strongly slide-free' then it is the unique reduced tree in its deformation\nspace.\n  These methods allow us to extend the rigidity theorem of Bass and Lubotzky to\ntrees that are not locally finite. This yields a unique factorization theorem\nfor certain graphs of groups. We apply the theory to generalized\nBaumslag-Solitar groups and show that many have canonical decompositions. We\nalso prove a quasi-isometric rigidity theorem for strongly slide-free G-trees.\n","Comment: Published in Geometry and Topology at\n  http://www.maths.warwick.ac.uk/gt/GTVol6/paper8.abs.html"]}]

Extending to formal linear combinations x=Sum_i(a_i M_i) yields a\nsesquilinear pairing p=<,> with values in (formal linear combinations of)\nclosed manifolds. Topological quantum field theory (TQFT) represents this\nuniversal pairing p onto a finite dimensional quotient pairing q with values in\nC which in physically motivated cases is positive definite. To see if such a\n\"unitary\" TQFT can potentially detect any nontrivial x, we ask if <x,x> is\nnon-zero whenever x is non-zero. If this is the case, we call the pairing p\npositive. The question arises for each dimension d=0,1,2,.... We find p(d)\npositive for d=0,1, and 2 and not positive for d=4. We conjecture that p(3) is\nalso positive. Similar questions may be phrased for (manifold, submanifold)\npairs and manifolds with other additional structure.

The determination of the homotopy type of quaternionic algebraic\ncycles is more involved than in the real case, but has a similarly simple\ndescription. The stabilized space of quaternionic algebraic cycles admits a\nnontrivial infinite loop space structure yielding, in particular, a delooping\nof the total Pontrjagin class map. This stabilized space is directly related to\nan extended notion of quaternionic spaces and bundles (KH-theory), in analogy\nwith Atiyah's real spaces and KR-theory, and the characteristic classes that we\nintroduce for these objects are nontrivial.

It was a startling\nconsequence of the work of Casson and Gordon that in the classical case the\nkernel of phi on C_1 is infinitely generated. Beyond this, little has been\ndiscovered about the pair (C_1,phi).\n  In this paper we present a new approach to studying C_1 by introducing a\ngroup, M, defined as the quotient of the set of knots by the equivalence\nrelation generated by concordance and positive mutation, with group operation\ninduced by connected sum. We prove there is a factorization of phi,\nC_1-->M-->G_-. Our main result is that both maps have infinitely generated\nkernels.\n  Among geometric constructions on classical knots, the most subtle is positive\nmutation. Positive mutants are indistinguishable using classical abelian knot\ninvariants as well as by such modern invariants as the Jones, Homfly or\nKauffman polynomials. Distinguishing positive mutants up to concordance is a\nfar more difficult problem; only one example has been known until now. The\nresults in this paper provide, among other results, the first infinite families\nof knots that are distinct from their positive mutants, even up to concordance.\n","Comment: Published in Geometry and Topology at\n  http://www.maths.warwick.ac.uk/gt/GTVol5/paper26.abs.html"]}]
