The\ncombination of interferometry with spectroscopy will offer a unique and\nindependent estimate of the Cepheid masses.

We employed plastic and\nfluorescent nuclear track detectors (PNTDs and FNTDs) in the entrance channel\nof a monoenergetic carbon ion beam covering the therapeutically useful energy\nrange from 80 to 425 MeV/u. About 99 % of all primary particle tracks detected\nby both detectors were successfully matched, while 1 % of the particles were\nonly detected by the FNTDs because of their superior spatial resolution. We\nconclude that both PNTDs and FNTDs are suitable for clinical carbon beam\ndosimetry with a detection efficiency of at least 98.82 % and 99.83 %\nrespectively, if irradiations are performed with low fluence in the entrance\nchannel of the ion beam. The investigated method can be adapted to other\nnuclear track detectors and offers the possibility to characterize new track\ndetector materials against well-known detectors. Further, by combining two\ndetectors with a restricted working range in the presented way a\nhybrid-detector system can be created with an extended and optimized working\nrange.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables"]}]

The\nexperiment is performed on a sub-section of the SC lattice with three\nsuperconducting transmon qubits, in which two independent outer code qubits are\njoined to a central syndrome qubit via two linking bus resonators. With\nall-microwave high-fidelity single- and two-qubit nearest-neighbour entangling\ngates, we demonstrate entanglement distributed across the entire sub-section by\ngenerating a three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state with fidelity\n~94%. Then, via high-fidelity measurement of the syndrome qubit, we\ndeterministically entangle the otherwise un-coupled outer code qubits, in\neither an even or odd parity Bell state, conditioned on the syndrome state.\nFinally, to fully characterize this parity readout, we develop a new\nmeasurement tomography protocol to obtain a fidelity metric (90% and 91%). Our\nresults reveal a straightforward path for expanding superconducting circuits\ntowards larger networks for the SC and eventually a primitive logical qubit\nimplementation.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 4 main figures, 3 extended data figures"]}]

In addition to the\nintrinsic antiferromag- netic solution, as predicted for charge neutral\nhexagonal nanoflake, fully polarized ferromagnetic, and mixed phase solutions\nare obtained depending on the doped carrier concentration, and on-site Coulomb\ninteraction. The complexity arises due to the competing nature of local Coulomb\nin- teraction and carrier doping, favoring antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic\ncoupling, respectively. Chemical modification of the edge atoms by hydrogen\nleads to partial quenching of local moments, giving rise to a richer phase\ndiagram consisting of antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic, mixed, and nonmagnetic\nphases. We further report the influence of temperature on the long-range\nmagnetic ordering at the edge using ab initio molecular dynamics. In agreement\nwith the recent experimental observations, we find that temperature can also\nalter the magnetic state of neutral nanoflake, which is otherwise\nantiferromagnetic at zero temperature.

For instance, we shall see that the drift\ncharacterization of Liouville groups, due to Kaimanovich-Vershik and\nKarlsson-Ledrappier (and to Varopoulos in some important special cases) admits\na very short and quite elementary proof. Furthermore, we give a new, and rather\nshort proof of (a weak version of) an observation of Kaimanovich (as well as a\nsmall strengthening thereof) that the Poisson boundary of any symmetric\nmeasured group $(G,\\mu)$, is doubly ergodic, and the diagonal $G$-action on its\nproduct is ergodic with unitary coefficients. We also offer a characterization\nof weak mixing for ergodic $(G,\\mu)$-spaces parallel to the measure-preserving\ncase.\n  We shed some new light on Nagaev's classical technique to prove central limit\ntheorems for random walks on groups. In the interesting special case when the\nmeasured group admits a product current, we define a Besov space structure on\nthe space of bounded harmonic functions with respect to which the the\nassociated convolution operator is quasicompact without any assumptions on\nfinite exponential moments. For Gromov hyperbolic measured groups, this gives\nan alternative proof of the fact that every H\\\"older continuous function with\nzero integral with respect to the unique stationary probability measure on the\nGromov boundary is a co-boundary.\n  Finally, we give a new and almost self-contained proof of a special case of a\nrecent combinatorial result about piecewise syndeticity of product sets in\ngroups by the author and A.

Expert opinions differ widely and fracture mechanicians must\nwonder why fracking works. Fracture mechanics of individual pressurized cracks\nhas recently been clarified but the vital problem of stability of interacting\nhydraulic cracks escaped attention. Progress in this regard would likely allow\noptimization of fracking and reduction of environmental footprint. The present\narticle first focuses on the classical solutions of the critical states of\nlocalization instability of a system of cooling or shrinkage cracks and shows\nthat these solutions can be transferred to the system of hydraulic cracks. It\nis concluded that if the profile of hydraulic pressure along the cracks can be\nmade almost uniform, with a steep pressure drop at the front, the localization\ninstability can be avoided. To achieve this kind of profile the pumping rate\n(corrected for the leak rate) must not be too high. Subsequently, numerical\nsolutions are presented to show that an idealized system of circular\nequidistant vertical cracks propagating from a horizontal borehole behaves\nsimilarly. It is pointed out that one important role of proppants, as well as\nacids that promote creation debris in the new cracks, is that they partially\nhelp to limit crack closings and thus localization. Based on the extremely low\npermeability of gas shale, one must imagine a hierarchical progressively\nrefined crack systems in which the finest cracks have spacing in the\nsub-centimeter range. The overall conclusion is that what makes fracking work\nis the suppression or mitigation of localization instabilities of crack\nsystems, which requires achieving uniform pressure profiles along the cracks.\n"]}]

Prior\nwork has demonstrated the benefits of in-network content caching in a wired,\nInternet context. We investigate the problem of developing optimal routing and\ncaching policies in a hybrid network supporting in-network caching with the\ngoal of minimizing overall content-access delay. Here, needed content may\nalways be accessed at a back-end server via the cellular infrastructure;\nalternatively, content may also be accessed via cache-equipped \"cluster\" nodes\nwithin the MANET. To access content, MANET nodes must thus decide whether to\nroute to in-MANET cluster nodes or to back-end servers via the cellular\ninfrastructure; the in-MANET cluster nodes must additionally decide which\ncontent to cache. We model the cellular path as either i) a\ncongestion-insensitive fixed-delay path or ii) a congestion-sensitive path\nmodeled as an M/M/1 queue. We demonstrate that under the assumption of\nstationary, independent requests, it is optimal to adopt static caching (i.e.,\nto keep a cache's content fixed over time) based on content popularity. We also\nshow that it is optimal to route to in-MANET caches for content cached there,\nbut to route requests for remaining content via the cellular infrastructure for\nthe congestion-insensitive case and to split traffic between the in-MANET\ncaches and cellular infrastructure for the congestion-sensitive case.

The criterion which is commonly employed is\nI-divergence between nonnegative matrices. The problem becomes that of finding,\nfor assigned $k$, the factorization $WH$ closest to $V$ in I-divergence. An\niterative algorithm, EM like, for the construction of the best pair $(W, H)$\nhas been proposed in the literature.
