A Mordell-Weil generating set is a subset B of S(K) of minimal\ncardinality which generates S(K) via successive secant and tangent\nconstructions. Let r(S,K) be the cardinality of such a Mordell-Weil generating\nset.

In\nthis paper, we prove a special case of this conjecture. Namely, if S contains\ntwo skew lines both defined over K then r(S,K) = 1. One of the difficulties in\nstudying the secant and tangent process on cubic surfaces is that it does not\nlead to an associative binary operation as in the case of elliptic curves. As a\npartial remedy we introduce an abelian group H_S(K) associated to a cubic\nsurface S/K, naturally generated by the K-rational points, which retains much\ninformation about the secant and tangent process. In particular, r(S, K) is\nlarge as soon as the minimal number of generators of H_S(K) is large. In\nsituations where weak approximation holds, H_S has nice local-to-global\nproperties. We use these to construct a family of smooth cubic surfaces over\nthe rationals such that r(S,K) is unbounded in this family.

Changes to cis-regulatory\nelements are widely believed to be the predominant means by which regulatory\nnetworks evolve, yet examples of regulatory network divergence due to\ntranscription factor (TF) variation have also been observed. To systematically\nascertain the extent to which TFs contribute to regulatory divergence, we\nanalyzed the evolution of the largest class of metazoan TFs, Cys2-His2 zinc\nfinger (C2H2-ZF) TFs, across 12 Drosophila species spanning ~45 million years\nof evolution.

In addition to loss and recruitment of C2H2-ZF\ndomains, we found diverging DNA-contacting residues in ~47% of domains shared\nbetween D. melanogaster and the other fly species. These diverging\nDNA-contacting residues, found in ~66% of the D. melanogaster C2H2-ZF genes in\nour analysis and corresponding to ~24% of all annotated D. melanogaster TFs,\nshow evidence of functional constraint: they tend to be conserved across\nphylogenetic clades and evolve slower than other diverging residues. These same\nvariations were rarely found as polymorphisms within a population of D.\nmelanogaster flies, indicating their rapid fixation. The predicted\nspecificities of these dynamic domains gradually change across phylogenetic\ndistances, suggesting stepwise evolutionary trajectories for TF divergence.\nFurther, whereas proteins with conserved C2H2-ZF domains are enriched in\ndevelopmental functions, those with varying domains exhibit no functional\nenrichments.

One of their aims has been to replace the\nfirst generation of file sharing software with scalable peer-to-peer\narchitectures. On other fronts, the same techniques are applied, for example,\nto content delivery networks, streaming networks, cooperative caches,\ndistributed file systems, and grid computing architectures for scientific use.\nThis trend has emerged because with cooperative peers it is possible to\nasymptotically enhance the use of resouces in sharing of data compared to the\nbasic client-server architecture.\n  The need for distribution of data is wide and one could argue that it is as\nfundamental a building block as the message passing of the Internet. As an\nanswer to this need a new scalable architecture is introduced: Hybrid\nCommunication Architecture (HCA), which provides both data sharing and message\npassing as communication primitives for applications. HCA can be regarded as an\nabstraction layer for communication which is further encapsulated by a\nhigher-level middleware. HCA is aimed at general use, and it is not designed\nfor any particular application. One key idea is to combine data sharing with\nstreaming since together they enable many applications not easily implementable\nwith only one of these features. For example, a game application could share\nthe game world state between clients and modify it by using streaming. The\nother distinctive feature of the system is the use of knowledge of the physical\nnetwork topology in the optimization of the communication. With a feasible\nbusiness model, fault-tolerance, and security features, HCA is aimed eventually\nfor real-life adoption.\n  This thesis presents the specification of the C++ client interface of HCA and\nthe architecture and protocol of the distributed nodes forming the\nimplementation.\n","Comment: 120 pages"]}]

This compound has been studied for a quarter\nof century because of a so-called hidden order ground state visible by most of\nthe bulk experiments but almost invisible by microscopic probes like neutrons,\nmuons NMR or x-ray. We stress on some aspects that were not addressed\npreviously. Firstly, the comparison of the cell parameters in the 1-2-2 systems\nseems to point that the magnetic properties of URu2Si2 are leading by an U4+\nelectronic state. Secondly, a compilation of the different studies of the tiny\nantiferromagnetic moment indicates that the tiny antiferromagnetic moment has a\nconstant value which may indicate that it is not necessary extrinsic. We also\npresent the last development on the magnetic form factor measurement in which\nthe magnetic density rotates when entering in the hidden order state. To end,\nthe thermal dependence of the two most intense magnetic excitation at\nQ0=(1,0,0) and Q1=(0.6,0,0) seems to indicate two different origins or\nprocesses for these excitations.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 18 figures, published in Philosophical Magazine, 2014"]}]

The flat-rate pricing encourages the\nmaximum usage, while the usage-based pricing can flexibly attract more users\nespecially those with low valuations in mobile Internet access. First, we use\ntheoretical analysis to compare the two schemes and show that for a single\nprovider in a market, as long as the WiFi capacity is abundant, the flat-rate\npricing leads to more revenue. Second, we study how a global provider (e.g.,\nSkype) collaborates with this monopolist in each local market to provide a\nglobal WiFi service. We formulate {the interactions between the global and\nlocal providers as a dynamic game. In Stage I, the global provider bargains\nwith the local provider in each market to determine the global WiFi service\nprice and revenue sharing agreement. In Stage II, local users and travelers\nchoose local or global WiFi services. We analytically show that the global\nprovider prefers to use the usage-based pricing to avoid a severe competition\nwith the local provider. At the equilibrium, the global provider always shares\nthe majority of his revenue with the local provider to incentivize the\ncooperation. Finally, we analytically study how the interaction changes if the\nlocal market has more than one local provider. In this case, the global\nprovider can integrate the coverages of multiple local providers and provide a\nbetter service. Compared to the local monopoly case, local market competition\nenables the global provider to share less revenue with each of the local\nproviders. However, we numerically show that the global provider's revenue\ncould decrease, as he shares his revenue with more providers and can only\ncharge a lower price.\n","Comment: 18 pages including appendices"]}]

Often, one uses inverse probability weighted (IPW)\nestimators to estimate population effects in such studies.

However, if one wishes to sample from a\nposterior distribution of interest, a particle filter is only able to produce\ndependent draws. Particle smoothing algorithms are complicated and far less\nrobust, often requiring cumbersome post-processing, \"forward-backward\"\nrecursions, and multiple passes through subroutines. In this paper we introduce\nan alternative algorithm for both filtering and smoothing that is based on\nrejection sampling \"in windows\" .
