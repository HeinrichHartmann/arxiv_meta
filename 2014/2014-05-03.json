We show how such a logic can be used,\nwith worlds as instants of time, as an unified framework to encode both\nbiological systems and temporal properties of their dynamic behaviour. To\nillustrate our methodology, we consider a model of the P53/Mdm2 DNA-damage\nrepair mechanism. We prove several properties that are important for such a\nmodel to satisfy and serve to illustrate the promise of our approach. We\nformalize the proofs of these properties in the Coq Proof Assistant, with the\nhelp of a Lambda Prolog prover for partial automation of the proofs.\n","Comment: (2014)"]}]
