This can be understood in an analysis, based on\na particle Lagrangian with Maxwell term, boson-boson coupling and massless\nfermions (quantons), in which hadrons are described as stationary systems of\nquantons bound by an electric interaction, whereas leptons represent systems\nbound magnetically.\n","Comment: Improved version with boundary conditions for magnetic bound states.\n  13 pages, 3 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1104.2575"]}]
