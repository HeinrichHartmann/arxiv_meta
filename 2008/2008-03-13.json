Methods:Deep near-infrared\nK-band data complete enough to sample the substellar population in IC348 and\nOTC are obtained from the literature. The spatial distribution of the K-band\npoint sources is analysed using the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) method.

Superconductivity in OsN$_2$ would originate from\nthe stretching of covalently bonded dinitrogen units embedded in the\ntransition-metal matrix, thus adding dinitrides to the class of superconductors\ncontaining covalently bonded light elements. The dinitrogen vibrations are\nstrongly coupled to the electronic states at the Fermi level and generate\nnarrow peaks in the Eliashberg spectral function $\\alpha^2F(\\omega)$. The total\nelectron-phonon coupling of OsN$_2$ is $\\lambda=0.37$ and the estimated\nsuperconducting temperature T$_c \\approx 1$ K. We suggest that the\nsuperconducting temperature can be substantially increased by hole doping of\nthe pristine compound and show that T$_c$ increases to 4 K with a doping\nconcentration of 0.25 holes/OsN$_2$ unit.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 5 figures"]}]

The imaging and\ndynamics of the piezoelectric response at the nanoscale is perhaps the most\ndirect means of probing polarization, as has been demonstrated in a number of\nthin films and nanostructures . Here we report the use of piezoresponse force\nmicroscopy (PFM) and switching spectroscopy PFM (SSPFM) to image the\nferroelectric properties, domain structure, and polarization switching of\nultrathin ferroelectric Langmuir-Blodgett films of poly(vinylidene\nfluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) copolymers. PFM imaging of\nP(VDF-TrFE) thin films reveals ferroelectric domain sizes on the order of 25-50\nnm and an imaging resolution below 5 nm. The feature sizes in topography and\nPFM images are comparable and the boundaries of uniformly polarized regions\ncoincide with topographic features.
