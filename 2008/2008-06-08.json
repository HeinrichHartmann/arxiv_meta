Roughly\nspeaking, this rule states that if the wave function of a particle is split\ninto non-overlapping wave packets, the particle stays approximately inside the\nsupport of one of the wave packets, without jumping to the others.\n  In this paper a formal definition of this rule is given in terms of {\\it\nimprecise probability}. An imprecise probability space is a measurable space\n$(\\Omega, {\\cal A})$ endowed with a {\\it set} of probability measures $\\cal P$.\nThe quantum formalism and the quantum typicality rule allow us to define a set\nof probabilities ${\\cal P}_\\Psi$ on $(X^T, {\\cal F})$, where $X$ is the\nconfiguration space of a quantum system, $T$ is a time interval and ${\\cal F}$\nis the $\\sigma$-algebra generated by the cylinder sets. Thus, it is proposed\nthat a quantum system can be represented as the {\\it imprecise stochastic\nprocess} $(X^T, {\\cal F}, {\\cal P}_\\Psi)$, which is a canonical stochastic\nprocess in which the single probability measure is replaced by a set of\nmeasures. It is argued that this mathematical model, when used to represent\nmacroscopic systems, has sufficient predictive power to explain both the\nresults of the statistical experiments and the quasi-classical structure of the\nmacroscopic evolution.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 1 figure.
