We study this by means of 1-D driven lattice gas models that conserve\nboth mass and momentum. The most elementary version of this is the\nArndt-Heinzel-Rittenberg (AHR) process, which is usually presented as a two\nspecies diffusion process, with particles of opposite charge hopping in\nopposite directions and with a variable passing probability.\n  From the hydrodynamics perspective this can be viewed as two coupled Burgers\nequations, with the number of positive and negative momentum quanta\nindividually conserved. We determine the dynamic scaling dimension of the AHR\nprocess from the time evolution of the two-point correlation functions, and\nfind numerically that the dynamic critical exponent is consistent with simple\nKardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) type scaling. We establish that this is the result of\nperfect screening of fluctuations in the stationary state. The two-point\ncorrelations decay exponentially in our simulations and in such a manner that\nin terms of quasi-particles, fluctuations fully screen each other at coarse\ngrained length scales. We prove this screening rigorously using the analytic\nmatrix product structure of the stationary state. The proof suggests the\nexistence of a topological invariant. The process remains in the KPZ\nuniversality class but only in the sense of a factorization, as $({KPZ})^2$.\nThe two Burgers equations decouple at large length scales due to the perfect\nscreening.\n","Comment: 14 pages and 15 figures"]}]

Our argument can be extended to prove a lower bound\nof Omega(\\sqrt{nD}) rounds for broadcasting in radio networks of radius D. This\nresolves one of the open problems posed in [29], where in the authors proved a\nlower bound of $\\Omega(n^{1/4}) rounds for broadcasting in constant diameter\nnetworks.\n  We prove the new lower $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ bound for a special family of\nradius 2 networks.
