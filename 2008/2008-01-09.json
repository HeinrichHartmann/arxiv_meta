Fuzzy spaces are approximations to the algebra of functions of a\ncontinuous space by a finite matrix algebra. In the limit of infinitely large\nmatrices the formulation is exact. An attractive feature of this approach is\nthat it transparently shows how the geometrical properties of the continuous\nspace are preserved. In the study of the non-perturbative regime of QFT, fuzzy\nspaces provide a possible alternative to the lattice as a regularisation\nmethod. The thesis is divided into two parts. We perform Monte Carlo\nsimulations of a $\\lambda \\phi^4$ theory on a 3-dimensional Euclidean space. We\nidentify the phase diagram of this model. In addition to the usual disordered\nand uniform ordered phases we find a third phase of non-uniform ordering. This\nindicates the existence of the phenomenon called UV-IR mixing in the strong\ncoupling regime. Second we present a geometrical analysis of the scalar field\ntheory on a 4-dimensional fuzzy sphere, S4_F. Nevertheless a fuzzy version of\nS4 cannot be achieved by quantisation of the classical space. The problem is\ncircumvented by defining a scalar theory on a larger space, CP3 which is\n6-dimensional. It includes degrees of freedom related to S^4 plus others beyond\nS4. Those extra degrees of freedom are dynamically suppressed through a\nprobabilistic method. The analysis of the geometrical structures allows us to\ninterpret this procedure as a Kaluza-Klein reduction of CP3 to S4.\n","Comment: Phd thesis, 185 pages"]}]

We show that graphs representing several\nsuch codes with high minimum distance can be described as nested regular graphs\nhaving minimum regular vertex degree and containing long cycles. Two graphs\ncorrespond to equivalent quantum codes if they are related by a sequence of\nlocal complementations. We use this operation to generate orbits of graphs, and\nthus classify all inequivalent self-dual additive codes over GF(4) of length up\nto 12, where previously only all codes of length up to 9 were known. We show\nthat these codes can be interpreted as quadratic Boolean functions, and we\ndefine non-quadratic quantum codes, corresponding to Boolean functions of\nhigher degree. We look at various cryptographic properties of Boolean\nfunctions, in particular the propagation criteria. The new aperiodic\npropagation criterion (APC) and the APC distance are then defined. We show that\nthe distance of a zero-dimensional quantum code is equal to the APC distance of\nthe corresponding Boolean function. Orbits of Boolean functions with respect to\nthe {I,H,N}^n transform set are generated. We also study the peak-to-average\npower ratio with respect to the {I,H,N}^n transform set (PAR_IHN), and prove\nthat PAR_IHN of a quadratic Boolean function is related to the size of the\nmaximum independent set over the corresponding orbit of graphs. A construction\ntechnique for non-quadratic Boolean functions with low PAR_IHN is proposed. It\nis finally shown that both PAR_IHN and APC distance can be interpreted as\npartial entanglement measures.\n","Comment: Master's thesis. 105 pages, 33 figures"]}]
