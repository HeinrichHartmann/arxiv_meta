The new phase, termed the\nHaldane Insulator (HI) in analogy with the gapped phase of spin-1 chains, is\ncharacterized by a non local order parameter, which can only be written as an\ninfinite string in terms of the bosonic densities. We show that the string\norder can nevertheless be probed with physical fields that couple locally, via\nthe effect those fields have on the quantum phase transitions separating the\nexotic phase from the conventional Mott and density wave phases. Using a field\ntheoretical analysis we show that a perturbation which breaks lattice inversion\nsymmetry gaps the critical point separating the Mott and Haldane phases and\neliminates the sharp distinction between them. This is remarkable given that\nneither of these phases involves broken inversion symmetry. We also investigate\nthe evolution of the phase diagram with the tunable coupling between parallel\nchains in an optical lattice setup. We find that inter-chain tunneling destroys\nthe direct phase transition between the Mott and Haldane insulators by\nestablishing an intermediate superfluid phase. On the other hand coupling the\nchains only by weak repulsive interactions does not modify the structure of the\nphase diagram. The theoretical predictions are confirmed with numerical\ncalculations using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG).\n","Comment: 15 pages, 8 figures.

Moreover,\nwe prove a unique decomposition theorem for the elements of the semigroup.\n  The comparison between valuations in $V$, the approximation of a reduced\nplane curve singularity $C$ by families of sets $V^{(k)}$ of divisorial\nvaluations, and the relationship between the value semigroup of $C$ and the\nsemigroups of the sets $V^{(k)}$, allow us to obtain the (finite) minimal\ngenerating sequences for $C$ as well as for $V$.\n  We also analyze the structure of the homogeneous components of $\\gr_V R$. The\nstudy of their dimensions allows us to relate the Poincar\\'e series for $V$ and\nfor a general curve $C$ of $V$. Since the last series coincides with the\nAlexander polynomial of the singularity, we can deduce a formula of A'Campo\ntype for the Poincar\\'e series of $V$. Moreover, the Poincar\\'e series of $C$\ncould be seen as the limit of the series of $V^{(k)}$, $k\\ge 0$.\n"]}]

One should therefore be cautious when\nusing a two-phase model to account for empirically derived $t^2$ values. We\npresent a correction of a recent work by Giammanco & Beckman, who use a\ntwo-phase model to estimate the ionization rate of H II regions by cosmicrays.\nWe show that a very small amount of cold gas is sufficient to account for t2\nvalues typically inferred for H II regions.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 1 figure, accepted for publication in A&A"]}]
