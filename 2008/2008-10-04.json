The resulting Hamiltonian for $a(t)$ is just the first\nFriedmann equation of the traditional approach (i.e. the Robertson-Walker\ncosmology of General Relativity), as might be expected. The utility of this\napproach however stems from the fact that each of the terms matter, radiation,\nand vacuum, and including the kinetic / gravitational field term, are formally\nenergy densities, and the equation as a whole becomes a formal statement of\nenergy conservation. An advantage of this approach is that it facilitates an\nintuitive understanding of energy balance and exchange on the cosmological\nscale that is otherwise absent in the traditional presentation. Each coordinate\nsystem has its own internally consistent explanation for how energy balance is\nachieved. For example, in the spacetime with line element $ds^2 = dt^2 - a^2(t)\nd{\\bf{x}}^2$, cosmological red-shift emerges as due to a post-recombination\ninteraction between the scalar field $a(t)$ and the EM fields in which the\nlatter loose energy as if propagating through a homogeneous lossy medium, with\nthe energy lost to the scale factor helping drive the cosmological expansion.\n","Comment: References updated, submitted to CQG"]}]

At\nthe same time, we address some recent criticisms that have been published (or\nprivately communicated to us) attempting to cast doubts on the fundamental\npossibility of such running. In this work, we argue that while there is no\ncomprehensive proof of the CC running, there is no rigorous proof of the\nnon-running either. In particular, some purported \"non-running theorem\"\nrecently adduced in the literature is, in our opinion, completely insubstantial\nand formally incorrect.

In this paper, we consider such behavior in\natomic congestion games. We propose to study concurrent imitation dynamics that\nemerge when each player samples another player and possibly imitates this\nagents' strategy if the anticipated latency gain is sufficiently large. Our\nmain focus is on convergence properties. Using a potential function argument,\nwe show that our dynamics converge in a monotonic fashion to stable states. In\nsuch a state none of the players can improve its latency by imitating somebody\nelse. As our main result, we show rapid convergence to approximate equilibria.\nAt an approximate equilibrium only a small fraction of agents sustains a\nlatency significantly above or below average. In particular, imitation dynamics\nbehave like fully polynomial time approximation schemes (FPTAS). Fixing all\nother parameters, the convergence time depends only in a logarithmic fashion on\nthe number of agents. Since imitation processes are not innovative they cannot\ndiscover unused strategies. Furthermore, strategies may become extinct with\nnon-zero probability. For the case of singleton games, we show that the\nprobability of this event occurring is negligible. Additionally, we prove that\nthe social cost of a stable state reached by our dynamics is not much worse\nthan an optimal state in singleton congestion games with linear latency\nfunction. Finally, we discuss how the protocol can be extended such that, in\nthe long run, dynamics converge to a Nash equilibrium.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 1 figure"]}]
