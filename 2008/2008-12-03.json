With the help of a multilevel\ntracking (MLT) algorithm the sizes, brightnesses, and trajectories of 12836\numbral dots were found and analyzed. The MLT allows UDs with very low contrast\nto be reliably identified. Inside the umbra we determine a UD filling factor of\n11%.

In field theory \"conservation\nlaws\" are those that claim the existence of conservative physical quantities or\nobjects. These are conservation laws for physical fields. In contrast to that\nin physics (and mechanics) of material systems the concept of \"conservation\nlaws\" relates to conservation laws for energy, linear momentum, angular\nmomentum, and mass that establish the balance between the change of physical\nquantities and external action.\n  In the paper presented it is proved that there exist a connection between of\nconservation laws for physical fields and those for material systems. This\npoints to the fact that physical fields are connected with material systems.\nSuch results has an unique significance for field theories. This enables one to\nsubstantiate many basic principles of field theories, such as, for example, the\nunity of existing field theories and the causality. The specific feature of\nfield theory equations, namely, their connection to the equations for material\nsystems, is elicited. Such results have been obtained by using skew-symmetric\ndifferential forms, which reflect the properties of conservation laws.\n","Comment: 20 pages; LaTex 2e"]}]

It has recently been studied extensively in scientific databases\nand other settings due to its importance in helping scientists judge data\nvalidity, quality and integrity. However, most models of provenance have been\nstated as ad hoc definitions motivated by informal concepts such as \"comes\nfrom\", \"influences\", \"produces\", or \"depends on\". These models lack clear\nformalizations describing in what sense the definitions capture these intuitive\nconcepts. This makes it difficult to compare approaches, evaluate their\neffectiveness, or argue about their validity.\n  We introduce provenance traces, a general form of provenance for the nested\nrelational calculus (NRC), a core database query language. Provenance traces\ncan be thought of as concrete data structures representing the operational\nsemantics derivation of a computation; they are related to the traces that have\nbeen used in self-adjusting computation, but differ in important respects. We\ndefine a tracing operational semantics for NRC queries that produces both an\nordinary result and a trace of the execution. We show that three pre-existing\nforms of provenance for the NRC can be extracted from provenance traces.\nMoreover, traces satisfy two semantic guarantees: consistency, meaning that the\ntraces describe what actually happened during execution, and fidelity, meaning\nthat the traces \"explain\" how the expression would behave if the input were\nchanged. These guarantees are much stronger than those contemplated for\nprevious approaches to provenance; thus, provenance traces provide a general\nsemantic foundation for comparing and unifying models of provenance in\ndatabases.\n","Comment: Technical report"]}]
