Our main\nresult is the following description of the set Emb^6(N) of embeddings N\\to R^6\nup to isotopy.\n  The Whitney invariant W : Emb^6(N) \\to H_1(N;Z) is surjective. For each u \\in\nH_1(N;Z) the Kreck invariant \\eta_u : W^{-1}u \\to Z_{d(u)} is bijective, where\nd(u) is the divisibility of the projection of u to the free part of H_1(N;Z).\n  The group Emb^6(S^3) is isomorphic to Z (Haefliger). This group acts on\nEmb^6(N) by embedded connected sum. It was proved that the orbit space of this\naction maps under W bijectively to H_1(N;Z) (by Vrabec and Haefliger's\nsmoothing theory).

In particular, we show how abstract algebraic constructions appear\nnaturally in the study of geometric problems. Before giving a general\nconstruction, we illustrate the main ideas in simple but important particular\ncases, in which the essence is not veiled by technicalities.\n  More specifically, we present several classical and modern results on the\nembedding and knotting of manifolds in Euclidean space. We state many concrete\nresults (in particular, recent explicit classification of knotted tori). Their\nstatements (but not proofs!) are simple and accessible to non-specialists. We\noutline a general approach to embeddings via the classical van\nKampen-Shapiro-Wu-Haefliger-Weber 'deleted product' obstruction. This approach\nreduces the isotopy classification of embeddings to the homotopy classification\nof equivariant maps, and so implies the above concrete results. We describe the\nrevival of interest in this beautiful branch of topology, by presenting new\nresults in this area (of Freedman, Krushkal, Teichner, Segal, Spiez and the\nauthor): a generalization the Haefliger-Weber embedding theorem below the\nmetastable dimension range and examples showing that other analogues of this\ntheorem are false outside the metastable dimension range.\n","Comment: 70 pages; to appear in London Mathematical Society Lecture Notes"]}]
