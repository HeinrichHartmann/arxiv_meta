The method can be applied, for example, for 100 nm\nthin high-T_c films grown on insulator substrate 10 mm X 10 mm. In Corbino\ngeometry two Ohmic contacts have to be made on the film evaporating Ag or using\nsilver paste: one circle with radius r_a (1) and a ring electrode with internal\nradius r_b (2). In the in-between space (r_a,r_b) a ring electrode from mylar\nassures a capacitive connection between the superconducting layer and the\nmetallized surface (3) of the mylar. In such a way we have an field effect\ntransistor (FET) type structure with a circular gate. When at low enough\ntemperatures T << T_c an AC current with frequency omega is applied between the\ncircle source (1) and the ring-shaped drain (2) an AC Bernoulli voltage with\ndouble frequency 2f appears between the gate (3) and the source (1).

METHODS: We\nproduce 4D radio images on time-scales of nanoseconds using digital\nbeam-forming. Each pixel of the image is calculated for three spatial\ndimensions and as a function of time.

Many cellular forces, e.g. those generated in cyclic\nconformational changes of biological machines, have repetitive components.\nHowever, little is known about how proteins process repetitive mechanical\nstresses. To obtain first insights into dynamic protein mechanics, we probed\nthe mechanical stability of single and multimeric ubiquitins perturbed by\nperiodic forces. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we were\nable to model repetitive forces with periods about two orders of magnitude\nlonger than the relaxation time of folded ubiquitins. We found that even a\nsmall periodic force weakened the protein and shifted its unfolding pathways in\na frequency- and amplitude-dependent manner. Our results also showed that the\ndynamic response of even a small protein can be complex with transient\nrefolding of secondary structures and an increasing importance of local\ninteractions in asymmetric protein stability. These observations were\nqualitatively and quantitatively explained using an energy landscape model and\ndiscussed in the light of dynamic single-molecule measurements and\nphysiological forces.
