However, the problem is\ncomputationally hard; as a result, virtually all the existing pipelines use\nfast but approximate scoring functions, in spite of the fact that they have\nbeen shown to systematically produce incorrect results. A few interesting exact\napproaches are known, but they are very slow and hence not practical in the\ncase of realistic sequences. Results: We give an exact solution, solely based\non deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs), to the problem of finding not\nonly the p-value, but the whole relevant part of the Markovian probability\ndistribution function of a motif in a biological sequence. In particular, the\ntime complexity of the algorithm in the most interesting regimes is far better\nthan that of Nuel (2006), which was the fastest similar exact algorithm known\nto date; in many cases, even approximate methods are outperformed. Conclusions:\nDFAs are a standard tool of computer science for the study of patterns, but so\nfar they have been sparingly used in the study of biological motifs. Previous\nworks do propose algorithms involving automata, but there they are used\nrespectively as a first step to build a Finite Markov Chain Imbedding (FMCI),\nor to write a generating function: whereas we only rely on the concept of DFA\nto perform the calculations. This innovative approach can realistically be used\nfor exact statistical studies of very long genomes and protein sequences, as we\nillustrate with some examples on the scale of the human genome.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 7 figures and 2 tables"]}]
