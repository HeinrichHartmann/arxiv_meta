The governing\nNavier-Stokes equation for the fluid flow is solved using the projection method\nwith finite difference scheme, while the fibre-related equations are directly\nsolved with the Runge-Kutta method. Our findings indicate that the fibre motion\nhas strong influence on the distributions of the streamwise and transverse\nvelocities in the fountain flow. Fibre motion produces strong normal stress\nnear the wall which leads to the reduction of transversal velocity as compared\nto the Newtonian flow without fibres and in turn the streamwise velocity near\nthe wall is increased. Thus, the fibre addition to the flow weakens the\nstrength of the fountain flow. It is also found that the fibre orientation is\nnot always along the direction of velocity vector in the process of mold\nfilling. In the region of the fountain flow, the fibre near the centerline is\nmore oriented cross the streamwise direction comparing to that in the region\nfar behind the flow front. This leads to that the fibre near the centreline in\nthe region of fountain flow is more extended along the transverse direction.\nSince fibre orientation in the suspension flow and the shape of the flow front\nhave great bearing on the quality of the product made from injection molding,\nthis study has much implications for engineering applications.

In order to solve for the high\nstress at high concentration, the Discrete Adaptive Viscoelastic Stress\nSplitting (DAVSS) method is employed. For the axisymmetric contraction and\nexpansion passages with different geometry ratios, the results obtained are\ncompared to available constitutive models and experiments. The predicted vortex\nlength for dilute suspensions agrees well with experimental data in literature.\nOur numerical results show clearly the effect on vortex enhancement with\nincrease of the volume fractions and the aspect ratios. Effect of aspect ratio\nof fibres on the vortex length is also studied. It is found that for the lower\nexpansion ratio flows the vortex dimension in the corner region is fairly\nindependent of fibre concentration and aspect ratio of fibres while the said\nvortex dimension increases with the increase of fibre concentration for\ncontraction flows. The finding suggests that the aligned fibre approximation\ntraditionally employed in previous work does not exactly describe the effect of\nfibre motion, and the present BFC method is deemed more suitable for the flow\nof dilute fibre suspensions.

The effective area of\nMilagro peaks at energies E~10TeV, however it is still large even down to a few\nhundred GeV (~10m^2 at 100GeV). The wide field of view (~2sr) and high duty\ncycle (>90%) of Milagro make it ideal for continuously monitoring the overhead\nsky for transient Very High Energy (VHE) emissions. This study searched the\nMilagro data for such emissions. Even though the search was optimized primarily\nfor detecting the emission from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), it was still sensitive\nto the emission from the last stages of the evaporation of Primordial Black\nHoles or to any other kind of phenomena that produce bursts of VHE gamma rays.\nMeasurements of the GRB spectra by satellites up to few tens of GeV showed no\nsigns of a cutoff. Even though multiple instruments sensitive to $GeV/TeV$\ngamma rays have performed observations of GRBs, there has not yet been a\ndefinitive detection of such an emission yet. One of the reasons for that is\nthat gamma rays with energies E>~100GeV are attenuated by interactions with the\nextragalactic background light or are absorbed internally at the site of the\nburst. There are many models that predict VHE gamma-ray emission from GRBs. A\ndetection or a constraint of such an emission can provide useful information on\nthe mechanism and environment of GRBs. This study performed a blind search of\nthe Milagro data of the last five years for bursts of VHE gamma rays with\ndurations ranging from 100musec to 316sec.

For the first time, a\nmodel derived strictly from physics is proposed to show that the flow\ninstability under finite amplitude disturbance leads to turbulent transition.\nThe proposed model is named as \"energy gradient method.\" It is demonstrated\nthat it is the transverse energy gradient that leads to the disturbance\namplification while the disturbance is damped by the energy loss due to\nviscosity along the streamline. It is also shown that the threshold of\ndisturbance amplitude obtained is scaled with the Reynolds number by an\nexponent of -1, which exactly explains the recent modern experimental results\nby Hof et al. for pipe flow. The mechanism for velocity inflection and hairpin\nvortex formation are explained with reference to analytical results.
