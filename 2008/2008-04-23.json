In our system, we consider a\nquasi-static fading environment and we incorporate both high-rate and low-rate\nfeedback channels with possible feedback errors. To utilize feedback\ninformation, a class of code constellations is proposed, inspired from\northogonal designs and precoded space-time block codes, which is called\ngeneralized partly orthogonal designs or generalized PODs. Furthermore, to\nmodel feedback errors, we assume that the feedback bits go through binary\nsymmetric channels (BSCs). Two cases are studied: first, when the BSC bit error\nprobability is known a priori to the transmission ends and second, when it is\nnot known exactly. In the first case, we derive a minimum pairwise error\nprobability (PEP) design criterion for generalized PODs. Then we design the\nquantizer for the erroneous feedback channel and the precoder codebook of PODs\nbased on this criterion. The quantization scheme in our system is a channel\noptimized vector quantizer (COVQ). In the second case, the design of the\nquantizer and the precoder codebook is based on similar approaches, however\nwith a worst-case design strategy. The attractive property of our combining\nscheme is that it converges to conventional space-time coding with low-rate and\nerroneous feedback and to directional beamforming with high-rate and error-free\nfeedback.
