These Hamiltonians have the following properties:\ntheir ground states are known exactly; all equal-time correlation functions of\nlocal operators are short-ranged; and correlation functions of certain\nnon-local operators are critical. A variational argument shows gaplessness with\n$\\omega \\propto k^2$ at critical points defined by the absence of certain terms\nin the Hamiltonian, which is remarkable because equal-time correlation\nfunctions of local operators remain short-ranged. We call such critical points,\nin which spatial and temporal scaling are radically different,\nquasi-topological. When these terms are present in the Hamiltonian, the models\nare in gapped topological phases which are of special interest in the context\nof topological quantum computation.\n","Comment: v2: The version published in Phys.
