The theory points out at the\nlimitations of the weak field approximation and proposes a drift in the proper\ntime of the spacecraft outside the framework of general relativity. The theory\nyields a very accurate and precise value for the anomalous acceleration. In\nthis theory the proper time of a body is associated with the gravitational\nfrequency shift of the constituent fundamental particles of the body. The\nfrequency shift changes the energy level of the body which gets reflected in\nits relativistic mass and therefore in its motion. This change in energy level\ncauses the time like geodesics to deviate from that of the standard theoretical\nmodels. We introduce proper time in the line element of a metric theory\naccording to a fixed set of rules laid down by general relativity for\nintroducing deviation in the flat Minkowski metric. The frequency shift for\nbodies of different composition traversing different trajectories however, is\nnot the same and this gets reflected in its motion as an unmodeled anomalous\neffect. This association of proper time with the gravitational frequency shift\nof the body requires the flat Minkowski metric to deviate in different ways for\ndifferent two body systems. The solution to Pioneer anomaly given here yields\nanomalous acceleration within the limits of observational accuracy.\nGravitational redshift of light, bending of light and perihelic precession of\nplanets are within the permissible limits.

We find that mergers with 10-20% mass of the mass of the\nhost lead to the formation of thick disks whose characteristics are similar,\nboth in morphology as in kinematics, to those observed. Despite the relatively\nlarge mass ratios, the host disks are not fully destroyed by the infalling\nsatellites: a remaining kinematically cold and thin component containing\n~15-25% of the mass can be identified, which is embedded in a hotter and\nthicker disk.
