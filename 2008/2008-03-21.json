Most analyses using this new form of energy describe\nthe observed data with great accuracy, although there has been no laboratory\nconfirmation of it. The present work analyzes the consequences of Thomson\nscattering on Type Ia supernovae data for two significant reasons; (i) recently\nobserved data reveal the existence of sufficient amount of ionized baryonic\n(hydrogen) dark matter in the intergalactic medium, a necessary ingredient for\nThomson scattering, and (ii) its effects have not been considered previously in\ndetermining distances to the supernovae from their observed distance moduli.\nQuantitative results of the present investigation based on observed data and\ncorrected for Thomson scattering are consistent with the prediction of Hubble\nexpansion of the universe.\n  Subject headings: cosmology: theory - distances and redshifts - supernovae,\nHubble expansion: constituents of universe - missing dark matter\n","Comment: 9 pages including 3 figures and 1 table; typo in equation 6\n  corrected; references replaced"]}]

The motivation for these theories lies in the desire to have a\ngauge invariant system --with a fiber bundle formulation-- in more than three\ndimensions, which could provide a firm ground for constructing a quantum theory\nof the gravitational field. The starting point is a gravitational action which\ngeneralizes the Einstein theory for dimensions D>4 --Lovelock gravity. It is\nthen shown that in odd dimensions there is a particular choice of the arbitrary\nparameters of the action that makes the theory gauge invariant under the\n(anti-)de Sitter or the Poincare groups. The resulting lagrangian is a\nChern-Simons form for a connection of the corresponding gauge groups and the\nvielbein and the spin connection are parts of this connection field. These\ntheories also admit a natural supersymmetric extension for all odd D where the\nlocal supersymmetry algebra closes off-shell and without a need for auxiliary\nfields. No analogous construction is available in even dimensions.
