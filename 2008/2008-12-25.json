At low energies the behavior of the\nsymmetry energy around saturation influences dissipation and fragment\nproduction mechanisms.

Important Iso-EOS\neffects are stressed. Reactions induced by unstable 132Sn beams appear to be\nvery promising tools to test the sub-saturation Isovector EoS. New Isospin\nsensitive observables are also presented for deep-inelastic, fragmentation\ncollisions and Isospin equilibration measurements (Imbalance Ratios). The high\ndensity symmetry term can be derived from isospin effects on heavy ion\nreactions at relativistic energies (few AGeV range), that can even allow a\n``direct'' study of the covariant structure of the isovector interaction in the\nhadron medium.

This implies that the study of global behaviour of\nflat surfaces requires the study of singular points as well. If a flat surface\n$f$ admits singularities but its Gauss map $\\nu$ can be smoothly extended\nacross the singular set, $f$ is called a frontal. In addition, if the pair\n$(f,\\nu)$ gives an immersion, $f$ is called a front. A front $f$ is called flat\nif the Gauss map degenerates everywhere. The parallel surfaces and the focal\nsurface of a flat front $f$ are also flat fronts. In this paper, we generalize\nthe classical notion of completeness to flat fonts, and give a representation\nformula for complete flat fronts. As an application, we show that a complete\nflat front has properly embedded ends if and only if its Gauss image is a\nconvex curve.
