The large tunneling\nmagnetoresistance (TMR) observed in MTJs garnered much attention due to\npossible application in random access memories and magnetic field sensors. This\nled to a number of fundamental questions regarding the phenomenon of SDT. One\nsuch question is the role of interfaces in MTJs and their effect on the spin\npolarization of the tunneling current and TMR. In this paper we consider\ndifferent models which suggest that the spin polarization is primarily\ndetermined by the electronic and atomic structure of the ferromagnet/insulator\ninterfaces rather than by their bulk properties. First, we consider a simple\ntight-binding model which demonstrates that the existence of interface states\nand their contribution to the tunneling current depend on the degree of\nhybridization between the orbitals on metal and insulator atoms. The decisive\nrole of the interfaces is further supported by studies of spin-dependent\ntunneling within realistic first-principles models of Co/vacuum/Al,\nCo/Al2O3/Co, Fe/MgO/Fe, and Co/SrTiO3/Co MTJs. We find that variations in the\natomic potentials and bonding strength near the interfaces have a profound\neffect resulting in the formation of interface resonant states, which\ndramatically affect the spin polarization and TMR. The strong sensitivity of\nthe tunneling spin polarization and TMR to the interface atomic and electronic\nstructure dramatically expands the possibilities for engineering optimal MTJ\nproperties for device applications.\n","Comment: 22 pages"]}]
