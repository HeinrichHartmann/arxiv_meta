In this paper we propose a new\nscheme for reconstructing multiband sparse signals using a small number of\nsampling channels. The scheme, which we call synchronous multirate sampling\n(SMRS), entails gathering samples synchronously at few different rates whose\nsum is significantly lower than the Nyquist sampling rate. The signals are\nreconstructed by solving a system of linear equations. We have demonstrated an\naccurate and robust reconstruction of signals using a small number of sampling\nchannels that operate at relatively high rates. Sampling at higher rates\nincreases the signal to noise ratio in samples. The SMRS scheme enables a\nsignificant reduction in the number of channels required when the sampling rate\nincreases. We have demonstrated, using only three sampling channels, an\naccurate sampling and reconstruction of 4 real signals (8 bands). The matrices\nthat are used to reconstruct the signals in the SMRS scheme also have low\ncondition numbers. This indicates that the SMRS scheme is robust to noise in\nsignals. The success of the SMRS scheme relies on the assumption that the\nsampled signals are sparse. As a result most of the sampled spectrum may be\nunaliased in at least one of the sampling channels. This is in contrast to\nmulticoset sampling schemes in which an alias in one channel is equivalent to\nan alias in all channels. We have demonstrated that the SMRS scheme obtains\nsimilar performance using 3 sampling channels and a total sampling rate 8 times\nthe Landau rate to an implementation of a multicoset sampling scheme that uses\n6 sampling channels with a total sampling rate of 13 times the Landau rate.\n"]}]

Taking into account that any manifold of this\nclass locally is a warped product Kaehler manifold, we describe all warped\nproduct Bochner-Kaehler metrics. We find four families of complete metrics of\nthis type.\n","Comment: 28"]}]

So far, bounds on the optimum\nsuccess probability have been derived [1]. For two mixed states they are given\nin terms of the fidelity. Here we give tighter bounds as well as necessary and\nsufficient conditions for two mixed states to reach these bounds. Moreover we\nconstruct the corresponding optimal measurement strategies. With this result,\nwe provide analytical solutions for unambiguous discrimination of a class of\ngeneric mixed states. This goes beyond known results which are all reducible to\nsome pure state case. Additionally, we show that examples exist where the\nbounds cannot be reached.\n","Comment: 10 pages"]}]
