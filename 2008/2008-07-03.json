The trailed spectra,\nspectrograms and Doppler maps show characteristics typical of IP Pegasi during\nthe early stages of its outburst. The high-ionisation line of HeII 4686A is the\nmost centrally located line and has the greatest radial extension compared to\nthe HeI lines.

The application, for the first time, of the\nmodulation Doppler tomography technique, maps any harmonically varying\ncomponents present in the system configuration.

For the Balmer lines the level of the modulation, compared to the\naverage emission, decreases when moving to higher series.
