The timescale for this process can be less than the age\nof the Solar System, for plausible tidal parameters and moon masses. However,\nas we show numerically and analytically, the effects of the 2:1 and 3:1\nresonant forcing terms between Nix and Charon complicate this picture. In the\npresence of Charon's tidal damping, the 2:1 term forces Nix to migrate outward\nand the 3:1 term changes the eccentricity damping rate, sometimes leading to\neccentricity growth. We conclude that this mechanism probably does not explain\nNix and Hydra's current orbits.

At the solid-liquid state there are two kinds\nof processes in the reaction between analytes and ligands: the mass transport\nprocess and the chemical reaction process. The mass transport process is\nrelated to convection and diffusion. Total or partial limit of mass transport\nwould retard the diffusion from the bulk fluid to the interface of reaction.\nThis effect decreases the possibility of adsorption of analyte and ligand\nbecause the chemical reaction is faster than the diffusion. In order to solve\nthis problem, we apply an ac electric field to induce a vortex field by the\nelectrothermal effect, which helps in increasing the rate of diffusion. By\nusing the finite element analysis software, COMSOL Multiphysics, we optimized\nseveral parameters of the microelectrode structures and the position of the\nreacting surface, i.e. the microcantilever, by a simplified 2-D model and a 3-D\nmodel. It is successful in accelerating the reacting rate of the molecule which\nis limited by mass transport. The factor of the efficiency is about 1.429 when\nthe operating voltage is 15 Vrms peak-to-peak. In addition, the surface\nconcentration of the complex on the microcantilever has been simulated.\n","Comment: Submitted on behalf of EDA Publishing Association\n  (http://irevues.inist.fr/EDA-Publishing)"]}]

In contrast to the parent compound LaCoO_3 an inelastic\npeak at energy transfer ~0.75 meV was found at temperatures below 30 K. This\nexcitation apparently corresponds to a transition between a ground state\norbital singlet and a higher excited orbital doublet, originating from a\nhigh-spin triplet split by a small trigonal crystal field. Another inelastic\npeak at an energy transfer ~0.6 meV was found at intermediate temperatures\nstarting from T > 30 K. This confirms the presence of a thermally induced\nspin-state transition from the low-spin Co^3+ to a magnetic high-spin state in\nthe non-disturbed LaCoO_3 matrix. We suggest that hole doping of LaCoO_3 leads\nto the creation of a magnetic polaron and hence to the low-to-high spin state\ntransition on the relevant Co sites.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures; based on a talk given at ICM'06, Kyoto; to appear\n  in JMMM"]}]

The\ncontributions of Part I are threefold. (i) First, we lay down the theoretical\nfoundation for PF. Specifically, we present the fundamental properties and\nphysical/economic interpretation of PF. We show by general mathematical\narguments that PF leads to equal airtime allocation to users for the\nsingle-channel case; and equal equivalent airtime allocation to users for the\nmulti-channel case, where the equivalent airtime enjoyed by a user is a\nweighted sum of the airtimes enjoyed by the user on all channels, with the\nweight of a channel being the price or value of that channel. We also establish\nthe Pareto efficiency of PF solutions. (ii) Second, we derive characteristics\nof PF solutions that are useful for the construction of PF-optimization\nalgorithms. We present several PF-optimization algorithms, including a fast\nalgorithm that is amenable to parallel implementation. (iii) Third, we study\nthe use of PF utility for capacity allocation in large-scale WiFi networks\nconsisting of many adjacent wireless LANs. We find that the PF solution\nsimultaneously achieves higher system throughput, better fairness, and lower\noutage probability with respect to the default solution given by today's 802.11\ncommercial products.
