Recent studies have shown that Loop Quantum\nCosmology may provide a non-singular framework where these questions can be\naddressed.

We study the system\nlevel dynamical properties of the genetic network of Escherichia coli that\nregulates its metabolism, and show how its design leads to biologically useful\ncellular properties. Our study uses the database (Covert et al., Nature 2004)\ncontaining 583 genes and 96 external metabolites which describes not only the\nnetwork connections but also the boolean rule at each gene node that controls\nthe switching on or off of the gene as a function of its inputs. We have\nstudied how the attractors of the boolean dynamical system constructed from\nthis database depend on the initial condition of the genes and on various\nenvironmental conditions corresponding to buffered minimal media. We find that\nthe system exhibits homeostasis in that its attractors, that turn out to be\nfixed points or low period cycles, are highly insensitive to initial conditions\nor perturbations of gene configurations for any given fixed environment. At the\nsame time the attractors show a wide variation when external media are varied\nimplying that the system mounts a highly flexible response to changed\nenvironmental conditions. The regulatory dynamics acts to enhance the cellular\ngrowth rate under changed media. Our study shows that the reconstructed genetic\nnetwork regulating metabolism in {\\it E. coli} is hierarchical, modular, and\nlargely acyclic, with environmental variables controlling the root of the\nhierarchy. This architecture makes the cell highly robust to perturbations of\ngene configurations as well as highly responsive to environmental changes.
