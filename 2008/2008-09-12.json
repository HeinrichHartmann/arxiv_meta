It is assumed that the\nCR protects the PR transmission by applying the so-called\ninterference-temperature constraint, whereby the CR is allowed to transmit\nregardless of the PR's on/off status provided that the resultant interference\npower level at the PR receiver is kept below some predefined threshold. For the\nfading PR and CR channels, the interference-power constraint at the PR receiver\nis usually one of the following two types: One is to regulate the average\ninterference power (AIP) over all the fading states, while the other is to\nlimit the peak interference power (PIP) at each fading state. From the CR's\nperspective, given the same average and peak power threshold, the AIP\nconstraint is more favorable than the PIP counterpart because of its more\nflexibility for dynamically allocating transmit powers over the fading states.\nOn the contrary, from the perspective of protecting the PR, the more\nrestrictive PIP constraint appears at a first glance to be a better option than\nthe AIP. Some surprisingly, this paper shows that in terms of various forms of\ncapacity limits achievable for the PR fading channel, e.g., the ergodic and\noutage capacities, the AIP constraint is also superior over the PIP. This\nresult is based upon an interesting interference diversity phenomenon, i.e.,\nrandomized interference powers over the fading states in the AIP case are more\nadvantageous over deterministic ones in the PIP case for minimizing the\nresultant PR capacity losses. Therefore, the AIP constraint results in larger\nfading channel capacities than the PIP for both the CR and PR transmissions.\n"]}]

This does not\nrealistically model the Generalized Second Price (GSP) auction used in\npractice, in which bidders pay the next-highest bid for keywords that they are\nallocated. Towards the goal of more realistically modeling these auctions, we\nintroduce the Second-Price Ad Auctions problem, in which bidders' payments are\ndetermined by the GSP mechanism. We show that the complexity of the\nSecond-Price Ad Auctions problem is quite different than that of the more\nstudied First-Price Ad Auctions problem. First, unlike the first-price variant,\nfor which small constant-factor approximations are known, it is NP-hard to\napproximate the Second-Price Ad Auctions problem to any non-trivial factor,\neven when the bids are small compared to the budgets. Second, this discrepancy\nextends even to the 0-1 special case that we call the Second-Price Matching\nproblem (2PM). Offline 2PM is APX-hard, and for online 2PM there is no\ndeterministic algorithm achieving a non-trivial competitive ratio and no\nrandomized algorithm achieving a competitive ratio better than 2. This\ncontrasts with the results for the analogous special case in the first-price\nmodel, the standard bipartite matching problem, which is solvable in polynomial\ntime and which has deterministic and randomized online algorithms achieving\nbetter competitive ratios. On the positive side, we provide a 2-approximation\nfor offline 2PM and a 5.083-competitive randomized algorithm for online 2PM.\nThe latter result makes use of a new generalization of a result on the\nperformance of the \"Ranking\" algorithm for online bipartite matching.\n"]}]
