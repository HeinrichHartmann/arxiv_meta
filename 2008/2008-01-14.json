In this work, we report visible spectroscopic\nobservations of two candidate V-type asteroids, (7472) Kumakiri and (10537)\n1991 RY16, located in the outer Main Belt (a > 2.85 UA). These candidate have\nbeen previously identified by Roig and Gil-Hutton (2006, Icarus 183, 411) using\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey colors. The spectroscopic observations have been\nobtained at the Calar Alto Observatory, Spain, during observational runs in\nNovember and December 2006. The spectra of these two asteroids show the steep\nslope shortwards of 0.70 microns and the deep absorption feature longwards of\n0.75 microns that are characteristic of V-type asteroids. However, the presence\nof a shallow but conspicuous absorption band around 0.65 microns opens some\nquestions about the actual mineralogy of these two asteroids. Such band has\nnever been observed before in basaltic asteroids with the intensity we detected\nit. We discuss the possibility for this shallow absorption feature to be caused\nby the presence of chromium on the asteroid surface. Our results indicate that,\ntogether with (1459) Magnya, asteroids (7472) Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16\nmay be the only traces of basaltic material found up to now in the outer Main\nBelt.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables"]}]

The\nformulation of the joint problem of finding the regional model solution and\ndata assimilation, as a PDE-constrained optimization problem, gives the\npossibility to obtain the exact numerical solution of the regional model. Three\nsimple model examples (ODE Burgers equation, Rossby-Oboukhov equation,\nKorteweg-de Vries equation) were considered in this paper. The result of\nperformed numerical experiments indicates that the optimization approach can\nsignificantly improve the precision of the sought numerical solution, even in\nthe cases in which the solution of Cauchy-Dirichlet problem is very sensitive\nto the errors in the boundary condition.\n","Comment: Paper contents 14 pages and 12 figures.

The proof is based\non the strategy of R\\'emond (following Bombieri, Masser and Zannier) with two\nnew ingredients, one of them, being at the heart of this article : it is a\nlower bound for the N\\'eron-Tate height of points on Abelian varieties $A/K$ of\nC.M. type in the spirit of Lehmer's problem. This lower bound is an analog of\nthe similar result of Amoroso and David \\cite{ad2003} on $\\G_m^n$ and is a\ngeneralisation of the theorem of David and Hindry \\cite{davidhindry} on the\nabelian Lehmer's problem. The proof is an adaptation of \\cite{davidhindry}\nusing in our abelian case the new ideas introduced in \\cite{ad2003}.\nFurthermore, as in \\cite{ad2003} and adapting in the abelian case their proof,\nwe give another application of our result : a lower bound for the absolute\nminimum of a subvariety $V$ of $A$. Although lower bounds for this minimum were\nalready known (decreasing multi-exponential function of the degree for\nBombieri-Zannier), our methods enable us to prove, up to an $\\epsilon$ the\noptimal result that can be conjectured.\n","Comment: 41 pages, titre modifi\\'e ; accept\\'e pour publication aux Annales de\n  l'Institut Fourier"]}]
