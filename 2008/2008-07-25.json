This expansion has been facilitated by the\ncontinued increase in the capacity and speed of RDF database repositories known\nas triple-stores. High-end RDF triple-stores can hold and process on the order\nof 10 billion triples. In an effort to provide a seamless integration of the\ndata contained in RDF repositories, the Linked Data community is providing\nspecifications for linking RDF data sets into a universal distributed graph\nthat can be traversed by both man and machine. While the seamless integration\nof RDF data sets is important, at the scale of the data sets that currently\nexist and will ultimately grow to become, the \"download and index\" philosophy\nof the World Wide Web will not so easily map over to the Semantic Web. This\nessay discusses the importance of adding a distributed RDF process\ninfrastructure to the current distributed RDF data structure.\n","Comment: written as a column for the Semantic Web and Information Systems\n  Bulletin, AIS Special Interest Group on Semantic Web and Information Systems\n  (SIGSEMIS), ISSN: 1556-2301"]}]
