The main features in the radio\ndynamic spectrum were a frequency-drifting continuum and two type II bursts.\nOur analysis shows that if the first type II burst was formed in the low\ncorona, the burst heights and speed are close to the projected distances and\nspeed of the Moreton wave (a chromospheric shock wave signature). The\nfrequency-drifting radio continuum, starting above 1 GHz, was formed almost two\nminutes prior to any shock features becoming visible, and a fast-expanding\npiston (visible as the continuum) could have launched another shock wave. A\npossible scenario is that a flare blast overtook the earlier transient, and\nignited the first type II burst. The second type II burst may have been formed\nby the same shock, but only if the shock was propagating at a constant speed.\nThis interpretation also requires that the shock-producing regions were located\nat different parts of the propagating structure, or that the shock was passing\nthrough regions with highly different atmospheric densities.

One important finding is\na linear relation between the depletion layer thickness and the applied\nvoltage, which is in contrast to the predictions of standard space charge\ntheory. The average electric field in the layer is independent of the voltage\nand is close to the dielectric breakdown field of alkali ion conducting\nglasses. Furthermore, we observe that the thickness of the depletion layer is\nestablished on a much shorter time scale than the resistance. We explain these\nresults by assuming that the huge electric fields created under the anode\nduring Na+ ion depletion lead to a strong increase of the electronic mobility\nin the layer and to charge compensation via extraction of electrons. It is\nshown that in the initial stages of the depletion process, a relative Na+ ion\ndepletion of only 400 ppm is sufficient to generate electric fields of the\norder of the dielectric breakdown field.\n"]}]

The textbook treatments of \"relativistic mechanics\" can be\nmisleading; the discussions usually deal with only one particle experiencing\nprescribed forces and so make no mention of these additional velocity- and\nacceleration-dependent forces. A simple example for a situation analogous to a\nparallel-plate capacitor is analyzed for all the conservation laws of Galilean\ninvariance or Lorentz invariance. For this system, Galilean invariance requires\nthat the mechanical momentum is given by pmech=mv but places no restriction on\nthe position-dependent potential function.

A non-linear kinetic system with conservation of supports\nfor distributions has generically finite-dimensional asymptotics. Such systems\nare apparent in many areas of biology, physics (the theory of parametric wave\ninteraction), chemistry and economics. This conservation of support has a\nbiological interpretation: inheritance. The finite-dimensional asymptotics\ndemonstrates effects of \"natural\" selection. Estimations of the asymptotic\ndimension are presented. After some initial time, solution of a kinetic\nequation with conservation of support becomes a finite set of narrow peaks that\nbecome increasingly narrow over time and move increasingly slowly. It is\npossible that these peaks do not tend to fixed positions, and the path covered\ntends to infinity as t goes to infinity. The drift equations for peak motion\nare obtained. Various types of distribution stability are studied: internal\nstability (stability with respect to perturbations that do not extend the\nsupport), external stability or uninvadability (stability with respect to\nstrongly small perturbations that extend the support), and stable realizability\n(stability with respect to small shifts and extensions of the density peaks).\nModels of self-synchronization of cell division are studied, as an example of\nselection in systems with additional symmetry.
