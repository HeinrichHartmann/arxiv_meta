Our protocol allows local filtering measurements and involves\nshared ancilla states that do not themselves violate CHSH. Our result follows\nfrom two main steps. We first provide a simple characterization of the states\nthat violate the CHSH-inequality after local filtering operations in terms of\nwitness-like operators. Second, we prove that for each entangled state\n$\\sigma$, there exists another state $\\rho$ not violating CHSH, such that\n$\\rho\\otimes\\sigma$ violates CHSH. Hence, in this scenario, $\\sigma$ cannot be\nsubstituted by classical correlations without changing the statistics of the\nexperiment; we say that $\\sigma$ is not simulable by classical correlations and\nour result is that entanglement is equivalent to non-simulability.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 1 figure"]}]
