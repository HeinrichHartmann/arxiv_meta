Some of their main aspects will be studied in further detail. Yet\nthis text remains self- sufficient. The questions asked following these studies\nwill be answered. The consistency of these developments in addition to the\nexperimental results, enable to strongly support the existence of a preferred\naether frame and of the anisotropy of the one-way speed of light in the Earth\nframe. The theory demonstrates that the apparent invariance of the speed of\nlight results from the systematic measurement distortions entailed by length\ncontraction, clock retardation and the synchronization procedures with light\nsignals or by slow clock transport. Contrary to what is often believed, these\ntwo methods have been demonstrated to be equivalent by several authors [1]. The\ncompatibility of the relativity principle with the existence of a preferred\naether frame and with mass-energy conservation is discussed and the relation\nexisting between the aether and inertial mass is investigated. The experimental\nspace-time transformations connect co-ordinates altered by the systematic\nmeasurement distortions. Once these distortions are corrected, the hidden\nvariables they conceal are disclosed. The theory sheds light on several points\nof physics which had not found a satisfactory explanation before.

In ref [1], we have derived a set of space-time transformations\nreferred to as the extended space-time transformations. These transformations,\nwhich assume the existence of a preferred aether frame and the variability of\nthe one-way speed of light in the other frames, are compared to the\nLorentz-Poincare transformations. We demonstrate that the extended\ntransformations can be converted into a set of equations that have a similar\nmathematical form to the Lorentz-Poincare transformations, but which differ\nfrom them in that they connect reference frames whose co-ordinates are altered\nby the systematic unavoidable measurement distortions due to length contraction\nand clock retardation and by the usual synchronization procedures, a fact that\nthe conventional approaches of relativity do not show. As a result, we confirm\nthat the relativity principle is not a fundamental principle of physics [i.e,\nit does not rigorously apply in the physical world when the true co-ordinates\nare used]. It is contingent but seems to apply provided that the distorted\ncoordinates are used. The apparent invariance of the speed of light also\nresults from the measurement distortions. The space-time transformations\nrelating experimental data, therefore, conceal hidden variables which deserved\nto be disclosed for a deeper understanding of physics.\n","Comment: PDF, 14 pages, 1 figure.
