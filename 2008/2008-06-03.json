Important role, in that method, is played by the initial\ngrid which, once refined, gives a description of the invariant manifold: the\ninvariant grid. A convenient way to get a first approximation of the SIM is\ngiven by the Spectral Quasi Equilibrium Manifold (SQEM) [1-2]. In the present\npaper, a flexible numerical method to construct the discrete analog of a Quasi\nEquilibrium Manifold, in any dimension, is presented. That object is named\nQuasi Equilibrium Grid (QEG), while the procedure Quasi Equilibrium Grid\nAlgorithm. Extensions of the QEM notion are also suggested. The QEG is a\nnumerical tool which can be used to find a grid-based approximation for the\nlocus of minima of a convex function under some linear constraints.
