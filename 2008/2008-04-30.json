We conduct a quantitative\ncomparison of the resolved stellar populations in these fields and identify\nseveral striking trends. The color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), which reach ~3\nmagnitudes below the red clump, can be classified into two main categories\nbased on their morphologies. `Stream-like' fields, so named for their\nsimilarity to the CMD of the giant stellar stream, are characterized by a red\nclump that slants bluewards at fainter magnitudes and an extended horizontal\nbranch. On the other hand, `disk-like' fields exhibit rounder red clumps with\nsignificant luminosity width, lack an obvious horizontal branch and show\nevidence for recent star formation (~0.25 - 2.0 Gyr ago). We compare the\nspatial and line-of-sight distribution of stream-like fields with a recent\nsimulation of the giant stream progenitor orbit and find an excellent\nagreement. These fields, found across the face of M31, attest to the high\ndegree of pollution caused by this event. Disk-like material resides in the\nextended disk structure of M31 and is detected out to 44 kpc (projected); the\nuniform populations in these fields, including the ubiquitous presence of young\npopulations, and the strong rotation reported elsewhere are most consistent\nwith a scenario in which this structure has formed through heating and\ndisruption of the existing thin disk, perhaps due to the impact of the giant\nstream progenitor.

Apart from the choice of\nthe central wavelength, we emphasize the importance of the saturation intensity\nreached by self-guided pulses, together with their temporal duration and\npropagation length as key players acting on both supercontinuum generation of\nthe pump wave and emergence of the third harmonics.
