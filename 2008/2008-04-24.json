These results\nlead to a partial algorithm for finding Liouvillian first integrals. However,\nthere are two main complications on the way to obtaining polynomials in the\nintegrating factor form. First of all, one has to find an upper bound for the\ndegrees of the polynomials in the product above, an unsolved problem, and then\nthe set of coefficients for each of the polynomials by the\ncomputationally-intensive method of undetermined parameters.

If both the numerator and the denominator of\nthe right-hand side of such ODE are not constants, the method can determine in\nfinite terms an explicit expression of an integrating factor if the ODE permits\nintegrating factors of the above mentioned form and then the Liouvillian first\nintegral.

Up to a sign,\nvalues of antisymmetric orbit functions are repeated on copies of the\nfundamental domain $F$ of the affine Weyl group (determined by the initial Weyl\ngroup) in the entire Euclidean space $E_n$. Antisymmetric orbit functions are\nsolutions of the corresponding Laplace equation in $E_n$, vanishing on the\nboundary of the fundamental domain $F$. Antisymmetric orbit functions determine\na so-called antisymmetrized Fourier transform which is closely related to\nexpansions of central functions in characters of irreducible representations of\nthe group $G$. They also determine a transform on a finite set of points of $F$\n(the discrete antisymmetric orbit function transform). Symmetric and\nantisymmetric multivariate exponential, sine and cosine discrete transforms are\ngiven.\n","Comment: Published in SIGMA (Symmetry, Integrability and Geometry: Methods and\n  Applications) at http://www.emis.de/journals/SIGMA/"]}]

As a result of the discretization,\na system of linear polynomial difference equations is derived for the unknown\nfunctions and their partial derivatives.
