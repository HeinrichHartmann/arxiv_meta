A screw dislocation\nbows out to undergo depinning on the original glide plane at low temperatures,\nwhere the behavior of the depinning stress is consistent with that obtained by\na continuum model. If the temperature is higher than 300 K, the motion of a\nscrew dislocation is no longer restricted to a single glide plane due to cross\nslip on the void surface. Several depinning mechanisms that involve multiple\nglide planes are found. In particular, a depinning mechanism that produces an\nintrinsic prismatic loop is found.
