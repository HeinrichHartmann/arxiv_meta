We discuss the\npossibility for an astrophysical scenario to (dis)confirm new physics for heavy\nparticles beyond TeV energy scale. In our scenario, the KK protons (the KK\nexcited quarks/gluons within protons) within the framework of universal extra\ndimensions (UEDs), are produced by high energy p + p collisions in Fermi\naccelerated environments, with protonic isotropic spectrum d N / d E \\propto\nE^-2 up to at least 10^18 eV. Thus, because they are also electrically charged,\nthey should be re-accelerated by mechanism similar to normal protons.

Hence, if we have techniques to\nidentify them from air shower data, we can constrain UEDs scenario. Our method\nis an \"existence proof\" that we can constrain new physics beyond TeV scale or\nmuch higher by classical astrophysical scenarios, which can also be generalized\nto supersymmetric models, the bulk Standard Model fields within the RS model,\nand the endlessly emerging new models.
