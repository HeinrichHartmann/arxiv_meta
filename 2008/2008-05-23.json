Second, the\nexternal periodic forces can induce 4:1 and 1:1 frequency-locking and spatially\nhomogeneous oscillation phenomena to appear. Finally, the resonant patterns are\nobserved in the system when the spatial noises and external periodic forces are\nboth turned on. Moreover, we found that the 4:1 frequency-locking transform\ninto 1:1 frequency-locking when the noise intensity increased.

Significantly, oscillations are\nenhanced in the system when the noise term presents.

Our emphases are on fundamental quantum theory and atomistic\nmodels. We begin with an introduction of the Landauer formula for ballistic\nthermal transport and give its derivation from scattering wave point of view.\nSeveral methods (scattering boundary condition, mode-matching, Piccard and\nCaroli formulas) of calculating the phonon transmission coefficients are given.\nThe nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method is reviewed and the Caroli\nformula is derived. We also give iterative methods and an algorithm based on a\ngeneralized eigenvalue problem for the calculation of surface Green's\nfunctions, which are starting point for an NEGF calculation. A systematic\nexposition for the NEGF method is presented, starting with the fundamental\ndefinitions of the Green's functions, and ending with equations of motion for\nthe contour ordered Green's functions and Feynman diagrammatic expansion. In\nthe later part, we discuss the treatments of nonlinear effects in heat\nconduction, including a phenomenological expression for the transmission, NEGF\nfor phonon-phonon interactions, molecular dynamics (generalized Langevin) with\nquantum heat-baths, and electron-phonon interactions.
