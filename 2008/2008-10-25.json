At each round,\none is presented with r random edges from the edge set of the complete graph on\nn vertices, and is asked to choose one of them. The selected edges are\ncollected into a graph, which thus grows at the rate of one edge per round.\nThis is a natural generalization of what is known in the literature as an\nAchlioptas process (the original version has r=2), which has been studied by\nmany researchers, mainly in the context of delaying or accelerating the\nappearance of the giant component.\n  In this paper, we investigate the small subgraph problem for Achlioptas\nprocesses. That is, given a fixed graph H, we study whether there is an online\nalgorithm that substantially delays or accelerates a typical appearance of H,\ncompared to its threshold of appearance in the random graph G(n, M). It is easy\nto see that one cannot accelerate the appearance of any fixed graph by more\nthan the constant factor r, so we concentrate on the task of avoiding H. We\ndetermine thresholds for the avoidance of all cycles C_t, cliques K_t, and\ncomplete bipartite graphs K_{t,t}, in every Achlioptas process with parameter r\n>= 2.\n","Comment: 43 pages; reorganized and shortened"]}]

Chains with similar properties and\nconstraints have been discussed in a seminal paper of Edwards and Goodyear\nusing an approach based on the Langevin equation. The GNLSM has been proposed\nin a previous publication in order to describe the dynamics of a two\ndimensional chain. In this paper the model is extended to d dimensions and a\nbending energy term is added to its action. As an application, two observables\nare computed in the case of a very stiff chain. The first observable is the\ndynamical form factor of a ring shaped chain. The second observable is a\nstraightforward generalization to dynamics of the static form factor. This\nobservable is relevant in order to estimate the average distance between two\narbitrary points of the chain. Finally, a variant of the GNLNM is presented, in\nwhich the topological conditions which constrain the motion of two linked\nchains are imposed with the help of the Gauss linking invariant.\n","Comment: 21 pages, Latex + revtex 4, the text of the manuscript has been\n  largely revised, misprints have been corrected and new references have been\n  added"]}]
