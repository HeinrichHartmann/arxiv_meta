To address this need, MIMO techniques, which are\ncapable of offering several-fold increase in capacity, hold significant\npromise. Most previous work on capacity analysis of ad-hoc networks is based on\nan implicit assumption that each node has only one antenna. Core to the\nanalysis therein is the characterization of a geometric area, referred to as\nthe exclusion region, which quantizes the amount of spatial resource occupied\nby a link. When multiple antennas are deployed at each node, however, multiple\nlinks can transmit in the vicinity of each other simultaneously, as\ninterference can now be suppressed by spatial signal processing. As such, a\nlink no longer exclusively occupies a geometric area, making the concept of\n\"exclusion region\" not applicable any more. In this paper, we investigate\nlink-layer throughput capacity of MIMO ad-hoc networks. In contrast to previous\nwork, the amount of spatial resource occupied by each link is characterized by\nthe actual interference it imposes on other links. To calculate the link-layer\ncapacity, we first derive the probability distribution of post-detection SINR\nat a receiver. The result is then used to calculate the number of active links\nand the corresponding data rates that can be sustained within an area. Our\nanalysis will serve as a guideline for the design of medium access protocols\nfor MIMO ad-hoc networks.

This work is an attempt to understand the fundamental\nperformance of WLANs under unsaturated condition.

Using a multiple-vacation queueing model, we\nderive an explicit expression for packet delay distribution, from which\nnecessary conditions for finite mean delay and delay jitter are established. It\nis found that under some circumstances, mean delay and delay jitter may\napproach infinity even when the traffic load is way below the saturation\nthroughput. Saturation throughput is therefore not a sound measure of WLAN\ncapacity when the underlying applications are delay sensitive. To bridge the\ngap, we define safe-bounded-mean-delay (SBMD) throughput and\nsafe-bounded-delay-jitter (SBDJ) throughput that reflect the actual network\ncapacity users can enjoy when they require bounded mean delay and delay jitter,\nrespectively.

In 1D QP chains of pinning\nsites, the peaks in J_c(Phi) are shown to be determined by a sequence of\nharmonics of long and short periods of the chain. This sequence includes as a\nsubset the sequence of successive Fibonacci numbers. We also analyze the\nevolution of J_c(Phi) while a continuous transition occurs from a periodic\nlattice of pinning centers to a QP one; the continuous transition is achieved\nby varying the ratio gamma = a_S/a_L of lengths of the short a_S and the long\na_L segments, starting from gamma = 1 for a periodic sequence. We find that the\npeaks related to the Fibonacci sequence are most pronounced when gamma is equal\nto the \"golden mean\". The critical current J_c(Phi) in QP lattice has a\nremarkable self-similarity. This effect is demonstrated both in real space and\nin reciprocal k-space. In 2D QP pinning arrays (e.g., Penrose lattices), the\npinning of vortices is related to matching conditions between the vortex\nlattice and the QP lattice of pinning centers. Although more subtle to analyze\nthan in 1D pinning chains, the structure in J_c(Phi) is determined by the\npresence of two different kinds of elements forming the 2D QP lattice. Indeed,\nwe predict analytically and numerically the main features of J_c(Phi) for\nPenrose lattices. Comparing the J_c's for QP (Penrose), periodic (triangular)\nand random arrays of pinning sites, we have found that the QP lattice provides\nan unusually broad critical current J_c(Phi), that could be useful for\npractical applications demanding high J_c's over a wide range of fields.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 15 figures (figures 7, 9, 10, 13, 15 in separate \"png\"\n  files)"]}]
