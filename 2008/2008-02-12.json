Most models in the literature assume that the inducer\nenters the cell via the carrier (permease), and exits by a diffusion-like\nprocess. The diffusive influx and carrier efflux are neglected. However,\nanalysis of the data shows that in non-induced cells, the diffusive influx is\ncomparable to the carrier influx, and in induced cells, the carrier efflux is 7\ntimes the diffusive efflux. Since bistability entails the coexistence of steady\nstates corresponding to both non-induced and induced cells, neither one of\nthese fluxes can be ignored. Here, we formulate a model accounting for both\nfluxes. We show that: (a) The thresholds of bistability are profoundly affected\nby both fluxes.

The carrier efflux increases the off\nthreshold by decreasing inducer accumulation in induced cells.

In these modes, the spanwise normal velocities are not zero. Thus, it\nindicates that one should take into account of the detailed geometry of the\ncochlear duct for a more quantitative result.

A geometric distance\n  from its light echoes"],"description":["  Context: The bright southern Cepheid RS Pup is surrounded by a circumstellar\nnebula reflecting the light from the central star. The propagation of the light\nvariations from the Cepheid inside the dusty nebula creates spectacular light\nechoes that can be observed up to large distances from the star itself. This\nphenomenon is currently unique in this class of stars. Aims: For this\nrelatively distant star, the trigonometric parallax available from Hipparcos\nhas a low accuracy. A careful observation of the light echoes has the potential\nto provide a very accurate, geometric distance to RS Pup. Methods: We obtained\na series of CCD images of RS Pup with the NTT/EMMI instrument, covering the\nvariation period of the star (P=41.4d). This allowed us to track the\nprogression of the light wavefronts over the nebular features surrounding the\nstar. We measured precisely the phase lag of the photometric variation in\nseveral regions of the circumstellar nebula. Results: From our phase lag\nmeasurements, we derived a geometric distance of 1992 +/- 28 pc to RS Pup. This\ndistance is affected by a total uncertainty of 1.4%, and corresponds to a\nparallax of pi = 0.502 +/- 0.007 mas and a distance modulus of mu = 11.50 +/-\n0.03. Conclusions: The geometric distance we derived is by far the most\naccurate to a Cepheid, and among the most accurate to any star. RS Pup appears\nboth as somewhat neglected and particularly promising to investigate the\nmass-loss history of Cepheids. Thanks to its highly accurate distance, it is\nalso bound to become an important luminosity fiducial for the long period part\nof the period-luminosity diagram.\n","Comment: 14 pages in electronic form.
