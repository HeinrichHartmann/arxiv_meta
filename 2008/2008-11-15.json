It is believed that N defects play important roles in\nachieving the high temperature ferromagnetism in good samples. Motivated by\nthese experimental advances, we use a full-potential density-functional-theory\nmethod and supercell approach to investigate N defects and their effects on\nferromagnetism of (Al,Cr)N with N vacancies (V_N). Calculated results are in\nagreement with experimental observations and facts of real Cr-doped AlN samples\nand their synthesis. Our first-principles results are useful to elucidating the\nmechanism for the ferromagnetism and exploring high-performance Cr-doped AlN\ndiluted magnetic semiconductors.\n","Comment: 8 pages with figures included"]}]

Numerical analysis based on the\ntrailing of saddle-node bifurcations is used to locate the n:1 Arnold tongues\nwhere synchronization occurs. Several of them are wide enough for high-order\nsynchronization to be seen in passive observations. By sweeping the system\nparameters within a certain range, we find that the stronger the dependence of\n$\\dot\\theta$ on $\\theta$, the wider the regions of synchronization. Use of a\nsynchronization index reveals a vast number of very narrow n:m Arnold tongues.\nA competition phenomenon among the tongues is observed, in that they \"push\" and\n\"squeeze\" one another: as some tongues widen, others narrow. Two mechanisms for\ntransitions between different n:m synchronization states are considered: slow\nvariation of the driving frequency, and the influence of low-frequency noise on\nthe rotator.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 7 figures, revtex.
