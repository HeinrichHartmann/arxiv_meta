Since SA\nhas polynomial complexity while the best classical factoring algorithms are\nsub-exponential, SA is cited as evidence that quantum computers are more\npowerful than classical computers. SA is critically dependent on the Quantum\nFourier Transform (QFT) and it is known that the QFT is sensitive to errors in\nthe quantum state input to it. In this paper, we show that the polynomial\nscaling of SA is destroyed by input errors to the QFT part of the algorithm. We\nalso show that Quantum Error Correcting Codes (QECC) are not capable of\nsuppressing errors due to operator imprecision and that propagation of operator\nprecision errors is sufficient to severely degrade the effectiveness of SA.\nAdditionally we show that operator imprecision in the error correction circuit\nfor the Calderbank-Shor-Steane QECC is mathematically equivalent to decoherence\non every physical qubit in a register. We conclude that, because of the effect\nof operator precision errors, it is likely that physically realizable quantum\ncomputers will be capable of factoring integers no more efficiently than\nclassical computers.\n","Comment: 15 pages"]}]
