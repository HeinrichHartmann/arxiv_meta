The models\nsucceed for some luminosity and redshift ranges and fail for others. A notable\nsuccess is that the Bower et al. model provides a good match to the observed LF\nat z~3. However, all models predict an increase with time of the rest-frame\nV-band luminosity density, whereas the observations show a decrease. The models\nalso have difficulty matching the observed rest-frame colors of galaxies. In\nall models the luminosity density of red galaxies increases sharply from z~3 to\nz~2.2, whereas it is approximately constant in the observations.

We investigate\ndistributed power allocation strategies for this system with limited channel\nstate information at the source and the relay nodes.

The decision mechanism calls for each\nrelay that is able to decode the information from the source to compare its\nrelay-to-destination channel gain with a given threshold.

The strategy dictates the optimum choices for the\nsource power as well as the threshold value at the relays. Next, we consider\ntwo simpler distributed power allocation strategies, namely the passive source\nmodel where the source power and the relay threshold are fixed, and the single\nrelay model where only one relay is allowed to forward the source data. These\nmodels are motivated by limitations on the available channel state information\nas well as ease of implementation as compared to the optimum distributed\nstrategy.

Our\napproach is to use hybrid systems to solve this problem: the complex dynamic is\nreplaced by piecewise affine approximations which allow an analytical\nresolution. The sequence of affine models then forms a sequence of states of a\nhybrid automaton. Given a sequence of states, we introduce an hybrid\napproximation of the nonlinear controllable domain and propose a new algorithm\ncomputing a controllable, piecewise convex approximation. The same way the\nnonlinear optimal control problem is replaced by an hybrid piecewise affine\none. Stating a hybrid maximum principle suitable to our hybrid model, we deduce\nthe global structure of the hybrid optimal control steering the system to the\ntarget.\n"]}]
