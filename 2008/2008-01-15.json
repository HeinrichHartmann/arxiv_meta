Telemedicine and teleconsultation are key areas that attempt to address\nthis problem by leveraging remote expertise for local problems. This paper\npresents an overview of teleconsultation in the developing world, with a\nparticular focus on how lessons learned apply to Africa. By teleconsultation,\nwe are addressing non-real-time communication between health care professionals\nfor the purposes of providing expertise and informal recommendations, without\nthe real-time, interactive requirements typical of diagnosis and patient care,\nwhich is impractical for the vast majority of existing medical practices. From\nthese previous experiences, we draw a set of guidelines and examine their\nrelevance to Ghana in particular. Based on 6 weeks of needs assessment, we\nidentify key variables that guide our framework, and then illustrate how our\nframework is used to inform the iterative design of a prototype system.\n","Comment: 5 pages"]}]

We keep\ntrack of the baryonic and observable properties of the central galaxies in a\nsample of dark matter halos with masses ranging from 10^{10} M_sol to 10^{13}\nM_sol. We find very different responses depending on the halo mass. For small\ndark matter halos its central galaxy responds in a highly predictable way to\nsmall perturbation in the star formation and feedback efficiency. For massive\ndark matter halos, minor perturbations in the input parameters can induce large\nfluctuations on the properties of its central galaxy, at least $\\sim 0.1$ in\n(B-V) color or $\\sim 0.5$ mag in U or r filter, in a seemingly random fashion.\nWe quantify this behavior through an objective scalar function we call\npredictability.
