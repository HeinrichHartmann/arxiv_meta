These quantities are\ncharacterised in terms of their relative precession phase offsets.

This paper shows that conformal maps, under\nthe Floquet condition, leads to coincidence between exponential stretching or\nLyapunov exponent, conformal factor of fast dynamos. Unfolding conformal dynamo\nmaps can be obtained in Riemann-flat manifolds since here, Riemann curvature\nplays the role of folding. Previously, Oseledts [Geophys Astrophys Fluid Dyn\n\\textbf{73} (1993)] has shown that the number of twisted and untwisting orbits\nin a two torus on a compact Riemannian manifold induces a growth of fast dynamo\naction. In this paper, the stretching of conformal thin magnetic flux tubes is\nconstrained to vanish, in order to obtain the conformal factor for\nnon-stretching non-dynamos. Since thin flux tube can be considered as a twisted\nor untwisting two-torus map, it is shown that the untwisting, weakly torsion,\nand non-stretching conformal torus map cannot support a fast dynamo action, a\nmarginal dynamo being obtained. This is an example of an anti-fast dynamo\ntheorem besides the ones given by Vishik and Klapper and Young [Comm Math Phys\n\\textbf{173}(1996)] in ideally high conductive flow. From the Riemann curvature\ntensor it is shown that new conformal non-dynamo, is actually singular as one\napproaches the magnetic flux tube axis.
