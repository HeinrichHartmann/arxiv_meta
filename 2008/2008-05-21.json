The first is important for large scale dynamo\ntheory: what prevents the magnetic backreaction forces from shutting down the\ndynamo cycle? The second question is: what determines the handedness of twist\nand writhe in magnetized coronal ejecta? Magnetic helicity conservation is\nimportant for answering both questions. Conservation implies that dynamo\ngeneration of large scale writhed structures is accompanied by the oppositely\nsigned twist along these structures. The latter is associated with the\nbackreaction force. We suggest that coronal mass ejections (CME's)\nsimultaneously liberate small scale twist and large scale writhe of opposite\nsign, helping to prevent the cycle from quenching and enabling a net magnetic\nflux change in each hemisphere. Observations and helicity spectrum measurements\nfrom a simulation of a rising flux ribbon support this idea. We show a new\npictorial of dynamo flux generation that includes the backreaction and magnetic\nhelicity conservation by characterizing the field as a 2-D ribbon rather than a\n1-D line.\n","Comment: 11 pages LaTeX, 2 figures (last 2 pages), submitted to ApJL"]}]

It is therefore inevitable that virtually all domains of engineering\nand physics need reference oscillators. The oscillator noise can be decomposed\ninto amplitude noise and phase noise. The latter, far more important, affects\ntiming, for it is related to precision and accuracy of measurements.\n  The oscillator, inherently, turns the phase noise of the internal parts into\nfrequency noise. This is a necessary consequence of the Barkhausen condition,\nwhich states that the loop gain must be of one, with zero phase, for stationary\noscillation. There follows that oscillator phase noise, which is the integral\nof the frequency noise, diverges in the long run. This is the Leeson effect.\n  The topics covered can be divided into three parts. Chapter 1 addresses\nlanguage and general physical mechanisms. Chapter 2 aims at understanding the\ninside of commercial oscillators through the analysis of the specifications.\nChapter 3 and 4 focus on the use of the Laplace transform to describe the\noscillator and its phase noise.\n  Since spring 2004, I had the opportunity to give some seminars on noise in\noscillators at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, at the IEEE Frequency Control\nSymposium, at the FEMTO-ST Laboratory, and at the Universite' Henri Poincare'.\nThese seminars had the purpose to provide a TUTORIAL, as opposed to a report on\nadvanced science, addressed to a variety of people including technicians, PhD\nstudents, and senior scientists.
