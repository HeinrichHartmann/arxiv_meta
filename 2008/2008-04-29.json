So it distinguishes any pair\nof links which are distinguishable by Jones'. This new invariant, denoted {\\em\nVSE-invariant} is strictly stronger than Jones': I detected a pair of links\nwhich are not distinguished by Jones' but are distinguished by the new\ninvariant. The full VSE-invariant has $3^n$ states. However, there are useful\nspecializations of it parametrized by an integer k, having\n$O(n^k)=\\sum_{\\ell=0}^k {n \\choose \\ell} 2^\\ell $ states. The link with more\ncrossings of the pair which was distinguished by the VSE-invariant has 20\ncrossings. The specialization which is enough to distinguish corresponds to k=2\nand has only 801 states, as opposed to the $2^{20} = 1,048,576$ states of the\nJones polynomial of the same link. The full VSE-invariant of it has $3^{20} =\n3,486,784,401$ states. The VSE-invariant is a good alternative for the Jones\npolynomial when the number of crossings makes the computation of this\npolynomial impossible. For instance, for $k=2$ the specialization of the\nVSE-invariant of a link with $n=500$ crossings can be computed in a few\nminutes, since it has only $2 n^2+1 = 500,001$ states.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 12 figures, some colored"]}]

We\nintroduce a new box-covering algorithm that is a modified version of the\noriginal algorithm introduced by Song et al. [Nature (London) 433, 392 (2005)];\nthis algorithm enables effective computation and easy implementation. Fractal\nnetworks are viewed as comprising a skeleton and shortcuts. The skeleton,\nembedded underneath the original network, is a special type of spanning tree\nbased on the edge betweenness centrality; it provides a scaffold for the\nfractality of the network. When the skeleton is regarded as a branching tree,\nit exhibits a plateau in the mean branching number as a function of the\ndistance from a root. Based on these observations, we construct a fractal\nnetwork model by combining a random branching tree and local shortcuts. The\nscaffold branching tree can be either critical or supercritical, depending on\nthe small-worldness of a given network. For the network constructed from the\ncritical (supercritical) branching tree, the average number of vertices within\na given box grows with the lateral size of the box according to a power-law (an\nexponential) form in the cluster-growing method. The distribution of box\nmasses, i.e., the number of vertices within each box, follows a power law\nP_m(M) sim M^{-eta}. The exponent eta depends on the box lateral size ell_B.\nFor small values of ell_B, eta is equal to the degree exponent gamma of a given\nscale-free network, whereas eta approaches the exponent tau=gamma/(gamma-1) as\nell_B increases, which is the exponent of the cluster-size distribution of the\nrandom branching tree.
