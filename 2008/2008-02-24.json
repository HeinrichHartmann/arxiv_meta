In this technique the\nnumber of EAS events with arrival directions falling in error circles centered\nabout the moving moon is compared to the mean number of events falling in error\ncircles with centers randomly chosen in the sky. For any assumed angular radius\nof the error circle the deficit in EAS event count in the direction of moon\ni.e., Nsky-Nmoon which is a moon-related effect is interpreted as the shadow of\nthe moon. A simple theoretical model has been developed to relate Nsky to the\nangular radius of the error circle and has been applied to the counts from the\nmoon's direction in order to extract the physical parameters of the shadow of\nthe moon. The technique and the theoretical model has been used on 1.7 *10^5\nEAS events recorded at Alborz observatory.\n"]}]

For example,\ncounting the pth frequency moment has been a very active area of research, in\ntheoretical computer science, databases, and data mining. When p=1, the task\n(i.e., counting the sum) can be accomplished using a simple counter.\n  Compressed Counting (CC) is proposed for efficiently computing the pth\nfrequency moment of a data stream signal A_t, where 0<p<=2. CC is applicable if\nthe streaming data follow the Turnstile model, with the restriction that at the\ntime t for the evaluation, A_t[i]>= 0, which includes the strict Turnstile\nmodel as a special case. For natural data streams encountered in practice, this\nrestriction is minor.\n  The underly technique for CC is what we call skewed stable random\nprojections, which captures the intuition that, when p=1 a simple counter\nsuffices, and when p = 1+/\\Delta with small \\Delta, the sample complexity of a\ncounter system should be low (continuously as a function of \\Delta). We show at\nsmall \\Delta the sample complexity (number of projections) k = O(1/\\epsilon)\ninstead of O(1/\\epsilon^2).\n  Compressed Counting can serve a basic building block for other tasks in\nstatistics and computing, for example, estimation entropies of data streams,\nparameter estimations using the method of moments and maximum likelihood.\n  Finally, another contribution is an algorithm for approximating the\nlogarithmic norm, \\sum_{i=1}^D\\log A_t[i], and logarithmic distance.
