In this work, we develop a new methodology,\nbased on the analysis of the almost constant separation of the dipole gravity\nmodes, to introduce new constraints on the solar models. To validate this\nanalysis procedure, several solar models -- including different physical\nprocesses and either old or new chemical abundances (from, respectively,\nGrevesse and Noels (Origin and evolution of the elements. Cambridge, England,\n199, 15, 1993) and Asplund, Grevesse, and Sauval (Astron. Soc. Pac. CS, San\nFrancisco, 36, 25, 2005)) -- have been compared to another model used as a\nreference. The analysis clearly shows that this methodology has enough\nsensitivity to distinguish between some of the models, in particular, between\nthose with different compositions. The comparison of the models with the g-mode\nasymptotic signature detected in GOLF data favors the ones with old abundances.\nTherefore, the physics of the core -- through the analysis of the g-mode\nproperties -- is in agreement with the results obtained in the previous studies\nbased on the acoustic modes, which are mostly sensitive to more external layers\nof the Sun.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Solar Physics. 14 pages, 5 figures"]}]

This\nstability was achieved by the european grid system and a large flexible and\nreliable spare power plant capacity.

The obvious consequence is that the\nreliable spare capacity has been reduced and that a further yearly demand\ngrowth of 1-2% for electric energy can only be achieved if new power plants\nwill be constructed soon. Data from various European countries, provided by the\nUCTE, indicate that the system stress during peak load times and especially\nduring particular cold winter days is much larger than generally assumed. In\nfact, the latest UCTE data on reliable power capacity indicate that already\nduring the Winter 2007/8 only a few very cold winter days in Western Europe\ncould have resulted in very unpleasant supply problems during the early evening\npeak load times in France and the neighboring countries.\n  An analysis of the potential to build and operate new power plants\ndemonstrates that no short term solution, which allows a further continuous\n1-2% consumption growth seems to exist. Thus, without any action from the\nvarious governments in Europe to reduce the electricity demand in a serious\nway, the risk of blackouts will increase dramatically in the near future.\nInstead of simply waiting for the blackout disaster to happen, a few simple\nshort term political actions are suggested.\n","Comment: 16 pages no figures"]}]

By comparison with a so-called Earth\nsystem model of intermediate complexity (CLIMBER-2), in which the events\nrepresent oscillations between two climate states corresponding to two\nfundamentally different modes of deep-water formation in the North Atlantic, we\ndemonstrate that the conceptual model captures fundamental aspects of the\nnonlinearity of the events in that model. We use the conceptual model in order\nto reproduce and reanalyse nonlinear resonance mechanisms that were already\nsuggested in order to explain the characteristic time scale of\nDansgaard-Oeschger events. In doing so we identify a new form of stochastic\nresonance (i.e. an overshooting stochastic resonance) and provide the first\nexplicitly reported manifestation of ghost resonance in a geosystem, i.e. of a\nmechanism which could be relevant for other systems with thresholds and with\nmultiple states of operation. Our work enables us to explicitly simulate\nrealistic probability measures of Dansgaard-Oeschger events (e.g. waiting time\ndistributions, which are a prerequisite for statistical analyses on the\nregularity of the events by means of Monte-Carlo simulations).

In this paper, we argue that the naive\napproach to this problem is doomed to failure because, unlike matrices, tensors\nof order 3 or higher can fail to have best rank-r approximations. The\nphenomenon is much more widespread than one might suspect: examples of this\nfailure can be constructed over a wide range of dimensions, orders and ranks,\nregardless of the choice of norm (or even Bregman divergence). Moreover, we\nshow that in many instances these counterexamples have positive volume: they\ncannot be regarded as isolated phenomena. In one extreme case, we exhibit a\ntensor space in which no rank-3 tensor has an optimal rank-2 approximation. The\nnotable exceptions to this misbehavior are rank-1 tensors and order-2 tensors.\nIn a more positive spirit, we propose a natural way of overcoming the\nill-posedness of the low-rank approximation problem, by using weak solutions\nwhen true solutions do not exist. In our work we emphasize the importance of\nclosely studying concrete low-dimensional examples as a first step towards more\ngeneral results. To this end, we present a detailed analysis of equivalence\nclasses of 2-by-2-by-2 tensors, and we develop methods for extending results\nupwards to higher orders and dimensions. Finally, we link our work to existing\nstudies of tensors from an algebraic geometric point of view. The rank of a\ntensor can in theory be given a semialgebraic description; i.e., can be\ndetermined by a system of polynomial inequalities. In particular we make\nextensive use of the 2-by-2-by-2 hyperdeterminant.\n","Comment: To appear in the SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications.\n  Includes another 7 pages of additional materials not in the earlier Tech\n  Report version"]}]

Instead of a base manifold S^3, we consider here a base manifold\nof dimension $n\\ge 2$ with a boundary and use Dirichlet boundary conditions on\nconnections as defined by Marini. A key step in the method of Narasimhan and\nRamadas consisted in showing that the linear space spanned by the curvature\nform at one specially chosen connection is dense in the holonomy Lie algebra\nwith respect to an appropriate Sobolev norm.\n  Our objective is to explore the effect of the presence of a boundary on this\nconstruction of the holonomy Lie algebra. Fixing appropriate Sobolev norms, it\nwill be shown that the space spanned, linearly, by the curvature form at any\none connection is never dense in the holonomy Lie algebra. In contrast, the\nlinear space spanned by the curvature form and its first commutators at the\nflat connection is dense and, in the $C^\\infty$ category, is in fact the entire\nholonomy Lie algebra. The former, negative, theorem is proven for a general\nprinciple bundle over $M$, while the latter, positive, theorem is proven only\nfor a product bundle over the closure of a bounded open subset of\n$\\mathbb{R}^n$. Our technique for proving absence of density consists in\nshowing that the linear space spanned by the curvature form at one point is\ncontained in the kernel of a linear map consisting of a third order\ndifferential operator, followed by a restriction operation at the boundary;\nthis mapping is determined by the mean curvature of the boundary.\n","Comment: 27 pages, paper version of PhD thesis Version Notes: Generalized over\n  for manifolds of dimension 2 and greater, clearer statement of results,\n  clearer abstract, typos corrected"]}]
