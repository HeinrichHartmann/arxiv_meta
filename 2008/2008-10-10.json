The symmetry of the SC gap, along with the\nmechanism of its emergence from the ``normal'' state is a central issue in this\ncontext. Here, motivated by a host of experimental signatures suggesting strong\ncorrelations in the Fe-pnictides, we undertake a detailed study of their normal\nstate.

In particular, we\npropose that near-total normal state incoherence, resulting from strong, {\\it\nlocal} correlations in the Fe $d$-shell in Fe-pnictides, underpins the\nincoherent normal state transport found in these materials, and discuss the\nspecific electronic mechanisms leading to such behavior.
