Thus the\nshortest times obtained depend on the coupling topology as well as on the\ncharacteristicratio of the time scales for local controls {\\em vs} non-local\n({\\em i.e.} coupling) evolutions in the specific experimental setting. Relating\nthese minimal times to the number of qubits gives the tightest known upper\nbounds to the actual time complexity of the quantum modules. As will be shown,\ntime complexity is a more realistic measure of the experimental cost than the\nusual gate complexity.\n  In the limit of fast local controls (as {\\em e.g.} in NMR), time-optimised\nrealisations are shown for the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and the multiply\ncontrolled {\\sc not}-gate ({\\sc c$^{n-1}$not}) in various coupling topologies\nof $n$ qubits. The speed-ups are substantial: in a chain of six qubits the\nquantum Fourier transform so far obtained by optimal control is more than eight\ntimes faster than the standard decomposition into controlled phase, Hadamard\nand {\\sc swap} gates, while the {\\sc c$^{n-1}$not}-gate for completely coupled\nnetwork of six qubits is nearly seven times faster.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures, REVTEX"]}]
