In this paper\nwe provide new and substantial evidence that also near-ignorance cannot be\nreally regarded as a way out of the problem of starting statistical inference\nin conditions of very weak beliefs. The key to this result is focusing on a\nsetting characterized by a variable of interest that is latent. We argue that\nsuch a setting is by far the most common case in practice, and we show, for the\ncase of categorical latent variables (and general manifest variables) that\nthere is a sufficient condition that, if satisfied, prevents learning to take\nplace under prior near-ignorance.

Moreover, border bases have proved to be an excellent tool\nfor describing zero-dimensional ideals when the coefficients are inexact. And\nin this situation they show a clear advantage with respect to Groebner bases\nwhich, nevertheless, can also be used in the study of Hilbert schemes, since\nthey provide tools for constructing suitable stratifications.\n  In this paper we compare Groebner basis schemes with border basis schemes. It\nis shown that Groebner basis schemes and their associated universal families\ncan be viewed as weighted projective schemes. A first consequence of our\napproach is the proof that all the ideals which define a Groebner basis scheme\nand are obtained using Buchberger's Algorithm, are equal. Another result is\nthat if the origin (i.e. the point corresponding to the unique monomial ideal)\nin the Groebner basis scheme is smooth, then the scheme itself is isomorphic to\nan affine space. This fact represents a remarkable difference between border\nbasis and Groebner basis schemes. Since it is natural to look for situations\nwhere a Groebner basis scheme and the corresponding border basis scheme are\nequal, we address the issue, provide an answer, and exhibit some consequences.\nOpen problems are discussed at the end of the paper.\n","Comment: Some typos fixed, some small corrections done.

This irrevocable property is highly\ndesirable from a practical perspective. As a consequence of this property, our\nheuristic entails a minimum amount of `exploration'. At the same time, we find\nthat the price of irrevocability is limited for a broad useful class of bandits\nwe characterize precisely. This class includes one of the most common\napplications of the bandit model, namely, bandits whose arms are `coins' of\nunknown biases. Computational experiments with a generative family of large\nscale problems within this class indicate losses of up to 5 to 10% relative to\nan upper bound on the performance of an optimal policy with no restrictions on\nexploration. We also provide a worst-case theoretical analysis that shows that\nfor this class of bandit problems, the price of irrevocability is uniformly\nbounded: our heuristic earns expected rewards that are always within a factor\nof 1/8 of an optimal policy with no restrictions on exploration. In addition to\nbeing an indicator of robustness across all parameter regimes, this analysis\nsheds light on the structural properties that afford a low price of\nirrevocability.\n","Comment: 29 pages"]}]
