We also find that\ngalaxies having local radio deficits appear to have enhanced global radio\nfluxes. Our preferred physical picture is that the observed radio deficit\nregions arise from the ICM wind sweeping away cosmic-ray (CR) electrons and the\nassociated magnetic field, thereby creating synchrotron tails observed for some\nof our galaxies. CR particles are also re-accelerated by ICM-driven shocklets\nbehind the observed radio deficit regions which in turn enhances the remaining\nradio disk brightness. The high radio polarization and lack of coincidental\nsignatures in the total synchrotron power in these regions arises from shear,\nand possibly mild compression, as the ICM wind drags and stretches the magnetic\nfield.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 3 figures; To appear in the proceeding from \"The Evolving\n  ISM in the Milky Way and Nearby Galaxies\""]}]

An important application of consensus methods is to\ncombine gene trees to estimate a species tree. To investigate the theoretical\nproperties of consensus trees that would be obtained from large numbers of loci\nevolving according to a basic evolutionary model, we construct consensus trees\nfrom independent gene trees that occur in proportion to gene tree probabilities\nderived from coalescent theory. We consider majority-rule, rooted triple (R*),\nand greedy consensus trees constructed from known gene trees, both in the\nasymptotic case as numbers of gene trees approach infinity and for finite\nnumbers of genes. Our results show that for some combinations of species tree\nbranch lengths, increasing the number of independent loci can make the\nmajority-rule consensus tree more likely to be at least partially unresolved\nand the greedy consensus tree less likely to match the species tree. However,\nthe probability that the R* consensus tree has the species tree topology\napproaches 1 as the number of gene trees approaches infinity. Although the\ngreedy consensus algorithm can be the quickest to converge on the correct\nspecies tree when increasing the number of gene trees, it can also be\npositively misleading. The majority-rule consensus tree is not a misleading\nestimator of the species tree topology, and the R* consensus tree is a\nstatistically consistent estimator of the species tree topology. Our results\ntherefore suggest a method for using multiple loci to infer the species tree\ntopology, even when it is discordant with the most likely gene tree.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 2 tables, 8 figures"]}]

Also, in the linear regime, the scalar field\ndark matter (SFDM) hypothesis predicts the same structure formation as the cold\ndark matter one. This means that CDM and SFDM are equivalent from the\ncosmological point of view. The free parameters of the SFDM model can be fixed\nusing cosmological observations. In a previous work, we showed by solving the\nEinstein Klein Gordon equations, that if we use such parameters, the scalar\nfield collapses forming stable objects with a mass around $10^{12}M_{\\odot}$.\nIn the present work we use analytical solutions of the flat and weak field\nlimit of the Einstein- Klein-Gordon equations. With this solutions we show that\nits scalar field density profile corresponds to a halo with an almost flat\ncentral density and that this halo coincides with the CDM model in a large\nouter region. Such a result could solve the problem of the cusp DM halo in\ngalaxies without extra hypothesis, adding to the viability of the SFDM model.\nThus, the SFDM model can be seen as an alternative model to the CDM one, with a\nself interacting WIMP.\n","Comment: 12 pages and 16 figures, minor changes in main text to match the\n  accepted version for RevMexAA publication"]}]
