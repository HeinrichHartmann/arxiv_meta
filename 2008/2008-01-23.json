By averaging ensembles of\nexperimentally-obtained force networks in different ways, we compare the\nobserved behavior with various predictions for granular silos. We identify\nseveral differences between the mean behavior in our system and that predicted\nby Janssen-like models: We find that the redirection parameter describing how\nthe force network transfers vertical forces to the walls varies with depth. We\nfind that changes in the preparation of the material can cause the pressure\nwithin the silo to either saturate or to continue building with depth. Most\nstrikingly, we observe a non-linear response to overloads applied to the top of\nthe material in the silo. For larger overloads we observe the previously\nreported \"giant overshoot\" effect where overload pressure decays only after an\ninitial increase [G. Ovarlez et al., Phys. Rev.

For\nsmaller overloads we find that additional pressure propagates to great depth.\nThis effect depends on the particle stiffness, as given for instance by the\nYoung's modulus, E, of the material from which the particles are made.\nImportant measures include E, the unscreened hydrostatic pressure, and the\napplied load. These experiments suggest that when the load and the particle\nweight are comparable, particle elasticity acts to stabilize the force network,\nallowing non-linear network effects to be seen in the mean behavior.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 17 figures"]}]
