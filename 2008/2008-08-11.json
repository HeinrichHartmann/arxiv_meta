If the boundaries favor the low shear rate state, then the high shear\nrate band can lie in the center of the flow cell, leading to a three-band\nconfiguration. Sufficiently strong stress gradients due to curved flow\ngeometries, such as that of cylindrical Couette flow, can convert this to a\ntwo-band state by forcing the high shear rate phase against the wall of higher\nstress, and can suppress the hysteresis loop observed during a shear rate\nsweep.\n","Comment: 13 figures 21 pages"]}]

However, pinning down the co-evolution of galaxies and BH on an\nobject-by-object basis remains elusive. I present results from new models for\nthe joint evolution of galaxies, SMBH, and AGN, which may be able to help\nresolve some of the observational puzzles. A unique aspect of these models is\nour treatment of self-regulated BH growth based on hydrodynamic simulations of\ngalaxy-galaxy mergers. Although these models do quite well at reproducing the\nobserved evolution of galaxies, they do not reproduce the observed history of\nBH accretion, predicting too much early accretion and not enough at late times.\nI suggest two possible resolutions to this problem.\n","Comment: to appear in \"Panoramic Views of Galaxy Formation and Evolution\",\n  First Subaru International Conference, Hayama, Japan, December 2007"]}]
