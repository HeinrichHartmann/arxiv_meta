A culminating path is a path of Z^2\nthat starts from (0,0), consists of steps (1,a) and (1,-b), stays above the\nx-axis and ends at the highest ordinate it ever reaches. These paths were first\nencountered in bioinformatics, in the analysis of similarity search algorithms.\nThey are also related to certain models of Lorentzian gravity in theoretical\nphysics. We first show that the language on a two letter alphabet that\nnaturally encodes culminating paths is not context-free. Then, we focus on the\nenumeration of culminating paths. A step by step approach, combined with the\nkernel method, provides a closed form expression for the generating fucntion of\nculminating paths ending at a (generic) height k. In the case a=b, we derive\nfrom this expression the asymptotic behaviour of the number of culminating\npaths of length n. When a>b, we obtain the asymptotic behaviour by a simpler\nargument. When a<b, we only determine the exponential growth of the number of\nculminating paths. Finally, we study the uniform random generation of\nculminating paths via various methods. The rejection approach, coupled with a\nsymmetry argument, gives an algorithm that is linear when a>= b, with no\nprecomputation stage nor non-linear storage required. The choice of the best\nalgorithm is not as clear when a<b.

Rational Kripke models are based on (generally infinite) rational\ngraphs, with vertices labeled by the words in some regular language and\ntransitions recognized by asynchronous two-head finite automata, also known as\nrational transducers. Every atomic proposition in a rational Kripke model is\nevaluated in a regular set of states. We show that every formula of Kt has an\neffectively computable regular extension in every rational Kripke model, and\ntherefore local model checking and global model checking of Kt in rational\nKripke models are decidable. These results are lifted to a number of extensions\nof Kt. We study and partly determine the complexity of the model checking\nprocedures.\n","Comment: To appear in: Proceedings of the International Conference on Infinity\n  in Logic and Computation ILC'2007, Springer LNAI"]}]

An analytic procedure is implemented to fit light, color,\nand velocity curves. We find that the V-I color toward the end of the plateau\ncan be used to estimate host-galaxy reddening with a precision of 0.2 mag. The\nluminosity-expansion velocity relation previously reported in the literature is\nrecovered. Using this relation and assuming a standard reddening law (R_V =\n3.1), we obtain Hubble diagrams in the BVI bands with approximate dispersions\nof 0.4 mag. Allowing R_V to vary and minimizing the spread in the Hubble\ndiagrams, we obtain a dispersion of 0.25-0.30 mag, which implies that these\nobjects can deliver distances with a precision of 12-14 %. The resulting value\nof R_V is 1.4 +/- 0.1. Using two supernovae with known Cepheid host-galaxy\ndistances, we obtain H_0 = 70 +/- 8 km/s/Mpc, in very good agreement with the\naverage value obtained with other modern, reliable methods.\n","Comment: MSc thesis, Universidad de Chile, 80 pages, 29 figures"]}]

In 2004, it was conjectured by Fendleyet al. that for some rectangular\ngrids, with toric boundary conditions, the alternating number of independent\nsets is extremely simple. More precisely, under a coprimality condition on the\nsides of the rectangle, the number of independent sets of even and odd\ncardinality always differ by 1. In physics terms, this means looking at the\nhard-particle model on these grids at activity -1. This conjecture was recently\nproved by Jonsson. Here we produce other families of grid graphs, with open or\ncylindric boundary conditions, for which similar properties hold without any\nsize restriction: the number of independent sets of even and odd cardinality\nalways differ by 0, 1,-1, or, in the cylindric case, by some power of 2. We\nshow that these results reflect a stronger property of the independence\ncomplexes of our graphs. We determine the homotopy type of these complexes\nusing Forman's discrete Morse theory. We find that these complexes are either\ncontractible, or homotopic to a sphere, or, in the cylindric case, to a wedge\nof spheres. Finally, we use our enumerative results to determine the spectra of\ncertain transfer matrices describing the hard-particle model on our graphs at\nactivity -1.
