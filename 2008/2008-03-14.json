The fit of the spectrum was carried out in the frame\nof the full multiple scattering (FMS) approach, via the MXAN program, starting\nfrom a muffin-tin (MT) form of the molecular potential. We have applied the\nMXAN analysis to the time-resolved XANES difference spectrum obtained between a\n100 ps life-time photoexcited state of Ni(II)TMP (a relaxed triplet state, T1,\nobtained by exciting the Soret band) and the ground state, S0. From our direct\nsimulation of the laser on/laser off difference spectrum, we obtain the\nfraction of T1 population (0.41-0.63) A in agreement with optical transient\nabsorption determination, and a 0.05-0.1 A elongation of the d(Ni-N) and\nd(Ni-C) distances. The overall uncertainty on these results mostly depends on\nuncertainty on the chemical shift between the T1 and S0 state, that is assumed\na priori in the differential analysis. Still our results are in good agreement\nwith previous EXAFS data (obtained on a reconstructed absolute spectrum of the\nT1 state). Our best fit corresponds to no chemical shift, 54% fraction of T1\nstate, and either a (0.04 +/- 0.01) elongation of the average d(Ni-N) or a\n(0.06 +/- 0.01) elongation of the average d(Ni-pyrrol) when pyrrol rings are\ntreated as perfectly rigid bodies. This work demonstrates that XANES\nspectroscopy can be used to provide structural information on square-planar\ntransition metal compounds by analysing the metal K-edge via MS method under\nthe MT approximation, and that XANES differential analysis can be successfully\napplied to study electronic/structural relationships in transient photoexcited\nspecies from time-resolved experiments.\n"]}]
