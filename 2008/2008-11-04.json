The\nbasic approach is to investigate the stability and monotonicity of a non-linear\nscheme in terms of its corresponding scheme in variations. Such an approach\nleads to application of the stability theory for linear equation systems to\nestablish stability of the corresponding non-linear scheme. The main\nmethodological innovation is the theorems establishing the notion that a\nnon-linear scheme is stable (and monotone) if the corresponding scheme in\nvariations is stable (and, respectively, monotone). Criteria are developed for\nmonotonicity and stability of difference schemes associated with the numerical\nanalysis of systems of partial differential equations. The theorem of\nFriedrichs (1954) is generalized to be applicable to variational schemes with\nnon-symmetric matrices. A new modification of the central Lax-Friedrichs (LxF)\nscheme is developed to be of the second order accuracy. A monotone piecewise\ncubic interpolation is used in the central schemes to give an accurate\napproximation for the model in question. The stability and monotonicity of the\nmodified scheme are investigated. Some versions of the modified scheme are\ntested on several conservation laws, and the scheme is found to be accurate and\nrobust. As applied to hyperbolic conservation laws with, in general, stiff\nsource terms, it is constructed a second order scheme based on\noperator-splitting techniques.\n","Comment: 48 pages, 6 figures.

In this paper,\nwe question this picture on the specific example of the directed polymer in a\ntwo dimensional random medium. We have recently shown (C. Monthus and T. Garel,\narxiv:0802.2502) that its dynamics for F=0 can be analyzed in terms of a strong\ndisorder renormalization procedure, where the distribution of renormalized\nbarriers flows towards some \"infinite disorder fixed point\". In the present\npaper, we obtain that for small $F$, this \"infinite disorder fixed point\"\nbecomes a \"strong disorder fixed point\" with an exponential distribution of\nrenormalized barriers. The corresponding distribution of trapping times then\nonly decays as a power-law $P(\\tau) \\sim 1/\\tau^{1+\\alpha}$, where the exponent\n$\\alpha(F,T)$ vanishes as $\\alpha(F,T) \\propto F^{\\mu}$ as $F \\to 0$. Our\nconclusion is that in the small force region $\\alpha(F,T)<1$, the divergence of\nthe averaged trapping time $\\bar{\\tau}=+\\infty$ induces strong\nnon-self-averaging effects that invalidate the usual creep formula obtained by\nreplacing all trapping times by the typical value.

This analysis is confirmed by numerical\nsimulations of a directed polymer with a metric constraint driven in a traps\nlandscape.

Randomly distributed, clustered SNe explosions cause\nthe formation of hot superbubbles that drive either galactic fountains or\nsupersonic winds out of the galactic disk. In a galactic fountain, the ejected\ngas is re-captured by the gravitational potential and falls back onto the disk.\n  From 3D non-equilibrium radiative cooling hydrodynamical simulations of these\nfountains, we find that they may reach altitudes smaller than 5 kpc in the halo\nand hence explain the formation of the so-called intermediate-velocity-clouds\n(IVCs). On the other hand, the high-velocity-clouds (HVCs) that are observed at\nhigher altitudes (of up to 12 kpc) require another mechanism to explain their\nproduction. We argue that they could be formed either by the capture of gas\nfrom the intergalactic medium and/or by the action of magnetic fields that are\ncarried out to the halo with the gas in the fountains. Due to angular momentum\nlosses (of 10-15%) to the halo, we find that the fountain material falls back\nto smaller radii and is not largely spread over the galactic disk, as\npreviously expected. This result is consistent with the metal distribution\nderived from recent chemical models of the galaxy. We also find that after\nabout 150 Myr, the gas circulation between the halo and the disk in the\nfountains reaches a steady state regime (abridged).\n","Comment: 9 pages, 7 figures, invited paper accepted to: \"Magnetic Fields in\n  the Universe II: from Laboratory and Stars to the Primordial Structures\",\n  RevMexAA"]}]

As a by--product of our electronic band\nstructure calculations, the effective masses of the binary compounds as well as\ntheir related alloys were calculated. We show that the calculated properties\nfor the binary compounds, as well as for the studied alloys, show good\nagreement with most of the previously reported results. Finally, using the\nfrozen phonon approach, the A$_1(TO)$ mode for the different systems studied in\nthis work was calculated. Our calculations show good agreement with\nexperimental values reported for the binary compounds. For the ternary alloys,\nour calculations reproduce experimental values for Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N as well as\ntheoretical predictions for In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 4 figures"]}]
