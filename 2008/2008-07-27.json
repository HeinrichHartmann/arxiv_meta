An\nasymptotic expansion of this wave function at large interparticle distances is\nderived, from which is defined a quantity $D$ named three-body scattering\nhypervolume, which is an analog of the two-body scattering length. Given any\nfinite-range interaction potentials, one can thus predict the effective\nthree-body force from a numerical solution of the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation. In\nthis way the constant $D$ for hard-sphere bosons is computed, leading to the\ncomplete result for the ground state energy per particle of a dilute\nBose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of hard spheres to order $\\rho^2$, where $\\rho$\nis the number density. Effects of $D$ are also demonstrated in the three-body\nenergy in a finite box of size $L$, which is expanded to the order $L^{-7}$,\nand in the three-body scattering amplitude in vacuum. Another key prediction is\nthat there is a violation of the effective field theory (EFT) in the condensate\nfraction in dilute BECs, caused by short-range physics. EFT predictions for the\nground state energy and few-body scattering amplitudes, however, are\ncorroborated.\n","Comment: 24 pages, no figure"]}]

When applied to computations in non-deterministic Turing machines,\nthis method may produce contradictory (and therefore trivial) theories,\nconsidering classical logic as the underlying logic. By substituting in such\ntheories the underlying logic by a paraconsistent logic we define a new\ncomputation model, the paraconsistent Turing machine. This model allows a\npartial simulation of superposed states of quantum computing. Such a feature\nallows the definition of paraconsistent algorithms which solve (with some\nrestrictions) the well-known Deutsch's and Deutsch-Jozsa problems. This first\nmodel of computation, however, does not adequately represent the notions of\nentangled states and relative phase, which are key features in quantum\ncomputing. In this way, a more sharpened model of paraconsistent Turing\nmachines is defined, which better approaches quantum computing features.\nFinally, we define complexity classes for such models, and establish some\nrelationships with classical complexity classes.\n","Comment: We chage the title of the paper (to be more appropriate) and add some\n  lines clarifying our points"]}]

Three typical Galactic-disk PNe have been mapped with the\n11.5''x7.2'' Argus array: two dimensional spectral maps of NGC 5882, 6153 and\n7009 with 297 spatial pixels per target were obtained at sub-arcsec resolutions\nand 297 spectra per target were obtained in the 396.4-507.8 nm range. Spatially\nresolved maps of emission lines and of nebular physical properties were\nproduced. The abundances of helium and of doubly ionized carbon and oxygen were\nderived from optical recombination lines (ORLs), while those of O^2+ were also\nderived from the collisionally excited lines (CELs). The abundance discrepancy\nproblem was investigated by mapping the ratio of ORL/CEL abundances for O^2+\n(the abundance discrepancy factor; ADF) across the face of the PNe. The ADF\nvaries between targets and also with position within the targets attaining\nvalues of ~40 in the case of NGC 6153. Correlations of the ADF with geometric\ndistance from the nucleus, as well as with [O III] electron temperature, plasma\nionization state and other physical properties are established. Very small\nvalues of the temperature fluctuation parameter in the plane of the sky are\nfound in all cases. It is argued that these results provide further evidence\nfor the existence in typical PNe of a distinct nebular component consisting of\nhydrogen-deficient plasma. The zones containing this posited component appear\nas undulations in the C II and C II ORL abundance diagnostics of about 2\nspatial pixels across; any associated structures should have physical sizes of\nless than ~1000 astronomical units. We propose that circumstellar disks, Abell\n30-type knots, or Helix-type cometary globules may be involved.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 18 figures (the resolution of some figures has been\n  reduced); Accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

For\nseveral collapse periods the output chemistry of infall tracer species such as\nHCO+, CS, and N2H+, is then coupled to an accelerated Lambda-iteration\nradiative transfer code, which predicts the emerging molecular line profiles\nusing two different input gas/dust temperature distributions. We investigate\nthe sensitivity of the predicted spectral line profiles and line asymmetry\nratios to the core temperature distribution, the time-dependent model\nchemistry, as well as to ad hoc abundance distributions. The line asymmetry is\nfound to be strongly dependent on the adopted chemical abundance distribution.\nIn general, models with a warm central region show higher values of blue\nasymmetry in optically thick HCO+ and CS lines than models with a starless core\ntemperature profile. We find that in the formal context of Shu-type inside-out\ninfall, and in the absence of rotation or outflows, the relative blue asymmetry\nof certain HCO+ and CS transitions is a function of time and, subject to the\nforegoing caveats, can act as a collapse chronometer.
