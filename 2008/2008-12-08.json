In order to be a viable dark energy candidate, the present\nenergy density contrast of dark energy ($\\Omega_{\\DE}^{(0)}$) should be close\nto an observed value (0.73) at the same time. However, a simple toy model of\nthe theory can not satisfy both $\\omega_{\\DE}^{(0)} \\simeq -1$ and\n$\\Omega_{\\DE}^{(0)} = 0.73$.

Therefore a closer look at the impact of ICT in\npublic financial management and performance is highly justified. Public finance\nis defined as a field of economics concerned with paying for collective or\ngovernmental activities, and with the administration and design of those\nactivities. Activities will be viewed as services or more precisely as public\nservices. We believe that there is need to consider performance from the\nperspective of effective performance and the perceived performance. In fact the\nreal or effective performance might not correspond to the perceived\nperformance. A service can be considered from the perspective of the\ndecision-maker, who in our case could be a government or a collectivity. ICT\ncan be employed in the three phases that concern the decision-maker: design,\nimplementation and evaluation. The beneficiaries of a service can employ ICT in\nany of the three phases - awareness, exploitation and assessment - for\nguarantying a high level of efficiency. Each phase in the environment of a\nservice will be presented as well as illustrations of how ICT can be employed\nin order to improve the end-result of each one of them. We believe that a high\nefficiency of each phase will produce a high global efficiency. It should be\nnoted however that the effectiveness of any system is highly dependent on the\nhuman engagement in the system. Therefore, the impact of ICT in public\nfinancial management will be felt only if the decision-makers and the end-users\nof the services engage themselves in the success of the system.
