The measurement consists in detecting fluorescence signals from\nseveral spots on the microarray surface onto which different probe sequences\nare grafted. One of the problems of the data analysis is that the signal\ncontains a noisy background component due to non-specific binding. This paper\npresents a physical model for background estimation in Affymetrix Genechips. It\ncombines two different approaches. The first is based on the sequence\ncomposition, specifically its sequence dependent hybridization affinity. The\nsecond is based on the strong correlation of intensities from locations which\nare the physical neighbors of a specific spot on the chip. Both effects are\nincorporated in a background functional which contains 24 free parameters,\nfixed by minimization on a training data set. In all data analyzed the sequence\nspecific parameters, obtained by minimization, are found to strongly correlate\nwith empirically determined stacking free energies for RNA/DNA hybridization in\nsolution. Moreover, there is an overall agreement with experimental background\ndata and we show that the physics-based model proposed in this paper performs\non average better than purely statistical approaches for background\ncalculations.

Firstly, we study features of the main phase of the flare, when\nthe strongest emissions from microwaves up to 200 MeV gamma-rays were observed.\nSecondly, we relate our results to a long-standing controversy on the origin of\nSEPs arriving at Earth, i.e., acceleration in flares, or shocks ahead of CMEs.\nAll emissions from microwaves up to 2.22 MeV line gamma-rays during the main\nflare phase originated within a compact structure located just above sunspot\numbrae. A huge radio burst with a frequency maximum at 30 GHz was observed,\nindicating the presence of a large number of energetic electrons in strong\nmagnetic fields. Thus, protons and electrons responsible for flare emissions\nduring its main phase were accelerated within the magnetic field of the active\nregion. The leading, impulsive parts of the GLE, and highest-energy gamma-rays\nidentified with pi^0-decay emission, are similar and correspond in time. The\norigin of the pi^0-decay gamma-rays is argued to be the same as that of lower\nenergy emissions. We estimate the sky-plane speed of the CME to be 2000-2600\nkm/s, i.e., high, but of the same order as preceding non-GLE-related CMEs from\nthe same active region. Hence, the flare itself rather than the CME appears to\ndetermine the extreme nature of this event. We conclude that the acceleration,\nat least, to sub-relativistic energies, of electrons and protons, responsible\nfor both the flare emissions and the leading spike of SEP/GLE by 07 UT, are\nlikely to have occurred simultaneously within the flare region. We do not rule\nout a probable contribution from particles accelerated in the CME-driven shock\nfor the leading GLE spike, which seemed to dominate later on.\n","Comment: 34 pages, 14 Postscript figures.
