This paper deals with the infinite family\n$G(r,1,n)$ of complex reflection groups; our goal is to study the standard\nmodules using a commutative subalgebra $\\ttt$ of $\\HH$ discovered by Dunkl and\nOpdam. In this case, the irreducible $W$-modules are indexed by certain\nsequences $\\lambda$ of partitions. We first show that $\\ttt$ acts in an upper\ntriangular fashion on each standard module $M(\\lambda)$, with eigenvalues\ndetermined by the combinatorics of the set of standard tableaux on $\\lambda$.\nAs a consequence, we construct a basis for $M(\\lambda)$ consisting of\northogonal functions on $\\CC^n$ with values in the representation $S^\\lambda$.\nFor $G(1,1,n)$ with $\\lambda=(n)$ these functions are the non-symmetric Jack\npolynomials.

Then we study the corresponding cat(K)-diagrams in various\nalgebraic Quillen model categories, and interpret their homotopy colimits as\nalgebraic models for X_K. Such models encode many standard algebraic\ninvariants, and their existence is assured by the Quillen structure. We provide\nseveral illustrative calculations, often over the rationals, including proofs\nthat quasitoric manifolds (and various generalisations) are rationally formal;\nthat the rational Pontrjagin ring of the loop space \\Omega DJ(K) is isomorphic\nto the quadratic dual of the Stanley-Reisner algebra Q[K] for flag complexes K;\nand that DJ(K) is coformal precisely when K is flag.
