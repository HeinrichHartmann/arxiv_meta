The resulting `imbalanced\nsuperfluid' has been realized experimentally for ultracold atomic gases with\ns-wave interactions. Inspired by high-temperature superconductivity, we\ninvestigate the case of d-wave interactions, and find marked differences from\nthe s-wave superfluid. Whereas s-wave imbalanced Fermi gases tend to phase\nseparate in real space, in a balanced condensate and an imbalanced normal halo,\nwe show that the d-wave gas can phase separate in reciprocal space so that\nimbalance and superfluidity can coexist spatially. We show that the mechanism\nexplaining this property is the creation of polarized excitations in the nodes\nof the gap. The Sarma mechanism, present only at nonzero temperatures for the\ns-wave case, is still applicable in the temperature zero limit for the d-wave\ncase. As a result, the d-wave BCS superfluid is more robust with respect to\nimbalance, and a region of the phase diagram can be identified where the s-wave\nBCS superfluidity is suppressed whereas the d-wave superfluidity is not.

Recently Bair et al (2006)\nproposed an efficient prediction method based on supervised principal component\nregression (PCR). Motivated by the fact that a larger number of principal\ncomponents results in better regression performance, this paper extends the\nmethod of Bair et al in several ways: a comprehensive variable ranking is\ncombined with a selection of the best number of components for PCR, and the new\nmethod further extends to regression with multivariate responses. The new\nmethod is particularly suited to HDLSS problems. Applications to simulated and\nreal data demonstrate the performance of the new method. Comparisons with Bair\net al (2006) show that for high-dimensional data in particular the new ranking\nresults in a smaller number of predictors and smaller errors.\n","Comment: Submitted to the Electronic Journal of Statistics\n  (http://www.i-journals.org/ejs/) by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics\n  (http://www.imstat.org)"]}]

Introducing a graphic notation, it is shown that for every\nstacky Lie monoid there is a natural morphism, called the preinverse, which is\na Morita equivalence if and only if the monoid is a stacky Lie group. As\nexample we describe explicitly the stacky Lie group structure of the irrational\nKronecker foliation of the torus.\n","Comment: 40 pages; definition of group objects in higher categories added;\n  coherence relations for groups in 2-categories given (section 4)"]}]
