We also consider advanced meta-interpreters,\nwhich make use of graph-based characterizations and often allow for more\nefficient computations. Our approach shows the suitability of ASP in general\nand of DLV in particular for fast prototyping. This can be fruitfully exploited\nfor experimenting with new languages and knowledge-representation formalisms.\n","Comment: 34 pages, appeared as a Technical Report at KBS of the Vienna\n  University of Technology, see http://www.kr.tuwien.ac.at/research/reports/"]}]

As for problem solving, we provide a formal definition of its\nkernel language, function-free disjunctive logic programs (also known as\ndisjunctive datalog), extended by weak constraints, which are a powerful tool\nto express optimization problems. We then illustrate the usage of DLV as a tool\nfor knowledge representation and reasoning, describing a new declarative\nprogramming methodology which allows one to encode complex problems (up to\n$\\Delta^P_3$-complete problems) in a declarative fashion. On the foundational\nside, we provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the\nlanguage of DLV, and by deriving new complexity results we chart a complete\npicture of the complexity of this language and important fragments thereof.\n  Furthermore, we illustrate the general architecture of the DLV system which\nhas been influenced by these results. As for applications, we overview\napplication front-ends which have been developed on top of DLV to solve\nspecific knowledge representation tasks, and we briefly describe the main\ninternational projects investigating the potential of the system for industrial\nexploitation. Finally, we report about thorough experimentation and\nbenchmarking, which has been carried out to assess the efficiency of the\nsystem. The experimental results confirm the solidity of DLV and highlight its\npotential for emerging application areas like knowledge management and\ninformation integration.\n","Comment: 56 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables"]}]
