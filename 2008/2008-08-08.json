Asymptotic properties for\nthese types of procedures in settings like linear regression and ARMA time\nseries have been studied, but these do not naturally extend to nonstandard\nsituations such as mixed effects models, where simple definition of the sample\nsize is not meaningful. This paper introduces a new class of strategies, known\nas fence methods, for mixed model selection, which includes linear and\ngeneralized linear mixed models. The idea involves a procedure to isolate a\nsubgroup of what are known as correct models (of which the optimal model is a\nmember). This is accomplished by constructing a statistical fence, or barrier,\nto carefully eliminate incorrect models. Once the fence is constructed, the\noptimal model is selected from among those within the fence according to a\ncriterion which can be made flexible. In addition, we propose two variations of\nthe fence. The first is a stepwise procedure to handle situations of many\npredictors; the second is an adaptive approach for choosing a tuning constant.\nWe give sufficient conditions for consistency of fence and its variations, a\ndesirable property for a good model selection procedure.

We\nfocus on the optimization of two design parameters associated with the LA: 1)\ninitial position upon LA update; 2) distance threshold for triggering of LA\nupdate. Based on the popular continuous-time random walk (CTRW) mobility model,\nwe propose a novel analytical framework that uses a diffusion equation to\nminimize the location management cost. In this framework, a number of\nmeasurable physical parameters, such as length of road section, angle between\nroad sections, and road section crossing time, can be integrated into the\nsystem design. This framework allows us to easily evaluate the total cost under\ngeneral call arrival distributions and LA of different shapes. For the\nparticular case of circular LA and small Poisson call-arrival rate, we prove\nthe following: (1) When the drift is weak, the optimal initial position\napproaches the center of the LA; when the drift is strong, it approaches the\nboundary of the LA. (2) Comparing the optimal initial-position and\ncenter-initial-position solutions (which is assumed in most prior work), when\nthe drift is weak, the optimal distance threshold and the minimum total cost\nare roughly equal; when the drift is strong, the optimal distance threshold in\nthe later is about 1.260 times that in the former, and the minimum total cost\nin the later is about 1.587 times that in the former. That is, optimizing on\ninitial position, which previous work did not consider, has the potential of\nreducing the cost measure by 37%.\n"]}]
