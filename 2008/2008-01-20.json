Various\nmechanisms, such as the hyperfine interaction with the surrounding nuclei, the\nDresselhaus spin-orbit coupling together with the electron--bulk-phonon\ninteraction, the $g$-factor fluctuations, the direct spin-phonon coupling due\nto the phonon-induced strain, and the coaction of the\nelectron--bulk/surface-phonon interaction together with the hyperfine\ninteraction are included. The relative contributions from these spin\ndecoherence mechanisms are compared in detail. In our calculation, the\nspin-orbit coupling is included in each mechanism and is shown to have marked\neffect in most cases. The equation-of-motion approach is applied in studying\nboth the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and the spin dephasing time $T_2$, either\nin Markovian or in non-Markovian limit. When many levels are involved at finite\ntemperature, we demonstrate how to obtain the spin relaxation time from the\nFermi Golden rule in the limit of weak spin-orbit coupling. However, at high\ntemperature and/or for large spin-orbit coupling, one has to use the\nequation-of-motion approach when many levels are involved. Moreover, spin\ndephasing can be much more efficient than spin relaxation at high temperature,\nthough the two only differs by a factor of two at low temperature.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 13 figures, to be published in PRB"]}]
