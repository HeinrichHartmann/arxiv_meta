The distribution function has a $\\delta$-like\nsingularity at the Fermi momentum $k_F$. The Fourier spectrum of the density\nhas a step-like form at the wavevector $2k_F$, with the harmonics being absent\nor vanishing above this threshold.

Fe70Cr10B20 crystallizes following a two-step process: an\neutectic crystallization of alfa-Fe (bcc) and the metastable tetragonal phase\n(Fe0.8Cr0.2)3B followed by another eutectic transformation to the stable phase\n(Fe0.75Cr0.25)2B and more segregation of alfa-Fe. These tetragonal phases are\nmagnetically anisotropic, giving rise to a large increase of the coercivity.\nThis behaviour is similar to that of Fe80B20 alloys, with Cr atoms replacing\nthe Fe positions in both crystalline phases. Fe80Zr10B10 shows also a two-step\nprocess in which two polymorphic transformations take place.\n","Comment: 3 pages.

It is essential to consider the effect of\nsolar heating loads in the design process; otherwise, it can shorten the life\nexpectancy of the electronic product or lead to catastrophic failure. In this\npaper we analyze and compare the effectiveness of different cooling techniques\nused for outdoor electronics. Various cooling techniques were compared like\nspecial coatings and paints on the outer surface, radiation shields,\ndouble-walled vented enclosures, fans for internal air circulation and\nair-to-air heat exchangers. A highly simplified, typical outdoor system was\nselected for this study measuring approximately 300x300x400 mm (WxLxH). Solar\nradiation was incident on 3 sides of the enclosure. There were 8 equally spaced\nPCBs inside the enclosure dissipating 12.5W each uniformly (100 watts total). A\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the system was built and analyzed.\nThis was followed by building a mock-up of the system and conducting\nexperiments to validate the CFD model. It was found that some of the simplest\ncooling techniques like white oil paint on the outer surface can significantly\nreduce the impact of solar loads. Adding internal circulation fans can also be\nvery effective. Using air-to-air heat exchangers was found to be the most\neffective solution although it is more complex and costly.\n","Comment: Submitted on behalf of TIMA Editions\n  (http://irevues.inist.fr/tima-editions)"]}]

For the study of configuration space topology, one\nconsiders the subsets M_v, consisting of all points from configuration space\nwith a potential energy per particle equal to or less than a given v. For\nfinite systems, topology changes of M_v are intimately related to nonanalytic\npoints of the microcanonical entropy (which, as a surprise to many, do exist).\nIn the thermodynamic limit, a more complex relation between nonanalytic points\nof thermodynamic functions (i.e., phase transitions) and topology changes is\nobserved. For some class of short-range systems, a topology change of the M_v\nat v=v_t was proved to be necessary for a phase transition to take place at a\npotential energy v_t. In contrast, phase transitions in systems with long-range\ninteractions or in systems with non-confining potentials need not be\naccompanied by such a topology change. Instead, for such systems the\nnonanalytic point in a thermodynamic function is found to have some\nmaximization procedure at its origin. These results may foster insight into the\nmechanisms which lead to the occurrence of a phase transition, and thus may\nhelp to explore the origin of this physical phenomenon.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 6 figures"]}]
