We consider this system in two different field\nconfigurations. In the first case, parallel external fields with the intensity\ndifference at each spin being proportional to the time-dependent interaction\nbetween the spins. General exact solution describing this system is presented\nand analyzed to adjust parameters of the field. Then we consider parallel\nfields with intensity difference at each spin being constant and the\ninteraction between the spins switching on and off adiabatically. In both cases\nwe adjust characteristics of the external fields (their intensities and\nduration) in order to have the parallel pulse adequate for constructing the XOR\ngate. In order to provide a complete theoretical description of all the cases,\nwe derive relations between the spin interaction, the inter-dot distance, and\nthe external field.\n","Comment: 12 pages"]}]
