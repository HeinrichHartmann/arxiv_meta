Very\nrecently, pore network modelling has been applied to model the gas diffusion\nlayer (GDL) of a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell. Discrete pore\nnetwork models have the potential to elucidate transport phenomena in the GDL\nwith high computational efficiency, in contrast to continuum or molecular\ndynamics modelling that require extensive computational resources.

In\nthis work, we discuss the first stage of developing and validating a\nGDL-representative pore network model.

One basic question tackled in the work is the relation between the\nterms 'grading' and 'group grading'. Although these terms have originally been\nclaimed to coincide for simple Lie algebras, it was revealed later that the\nproof of this assertion was incorrect. Therefore, the crucial statements about\none-to-one correspondence between fine gradings and MAD-groups had to be\nrevised and re-formulated for fine group gradings instead.
