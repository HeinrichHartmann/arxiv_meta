The three-component model\nconsists of a soft component, a reflection component from cold matter, and an\nabsorbed power-law component. The soft component can be represented by thin\nthermal emission with kT~0.56 keV or by a scattered component with a scattering\nfraction of 0.4%. Fixing the photon indices of the power law and reflection\ncomponents at 1.9, we found that the power law component, heavily absorbed by\ngas with a column density of ~1.5x10^24 cm^-2, has an intrinsic 2-10 keV\nluminosity of ~1.7x10^42 erg/s.

Besides formation of\nlanes of uniform walking direction and oscillations at bottlenecks at moderate\ndensities, it was recently discovered that stop-and-go waves [D. Helbing et\nal., Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 168001 (2006)] and a phenomenon called \"crowd\nturbulence\" can occur at high pedestrian densities [D. Helbing et al., Phys.\nRev. E 75, 046109 (2007)]. Although the behavior of pedestrian crowds under\nextreme conditions is decisive for the safety of crowds during the access to or\negress from mass events as well as for situations of emergency evacuation,\nthere is still a lack of empirical studies of extreme crowding. Therefore, this\npaper discusses how one may study high-density conditions based on suitable\nvideo data. This is illustrated at the example of pilgrim flows entering the\nprevious Jamarat Bridge in Mina, 5 kilometers from the Holy Mosque in Makkah,\nSaudi-Arabia. Our results reveal previously unexpected pattern formation\nphenomena and show that the average individual speed does not go to zero even\nat local densities of 10 persons per square meter. Since the maximum density\nand flow are different from measurements in other countries, this has\nimplications for the capacity assessment and dimensioning of facilities for\nmass events. When conditions become congested, the flow drops significantly,\nwhich can cause stop-and-go waves and a further increase of the density until\ncritical crowd conditions are reached.

In addition, heavy flavor quarkonia production is thought to be\nuniquely sensitive to the deconfined medium of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP)\nthrough color screening. Heavy quark production has been studied by the PHENIX\nexperiment at RHIC via measurements of single leptons from semi-leptonic decays\nin both the electron channel at mid-rapidity and in the muon channel at\nforward-rapidity. Large suppression and azimuthal anisotropy of single\nelectrons have been observed in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s) = 200 GeV. These\nresults suggest a large energy loss and flow of the heavy quarks in the hot,\ndense matter. The PHENIX experiment has also measured J/psi production up to\nsqrt(s) = 200 GeV in p+p, d+Au, Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions, both at mid\n(|y|<0.35) and forward (1.2<|y|<2.2) rapidities. In the most energetic\ncollisions (central Au+Au), more suppression is observed at forward rapidity\nthan at central rapidity.
