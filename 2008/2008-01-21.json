Quite differently, in\nunderdoped high-TC superconducting cuprates, a pseudogap, whose relation to the\nsuperconducting gap remains a mystery, develops well above TC. Whether the\npseudogap is a distinct phenomenon or the incoherent continuation of the\nsuperconducting gap above TC is one of the central questions in high-TC\nresearch. While some experimental evidence suggests they are distinct, this\nissue is still under intense debate. A crucial piece of evidence to firmly\nestablish this two-gap picture is still missing: a direct and unambiguous\nobservation of a single-particle gap tied to the superconducting transition as\nfunction of temperature. Here we report the discovery of such an energy gap in\nunderdoped Bi2212 in the momentum space region overlooked in previous\nmeasurements. Near the diagonal of Cu-O bond direction (nodal direction), we\nfound a gap which opens at TC and exhibits a canonical (BCS-like) temperature\ndependence accompanied by the appearance of the so-called Bogoliubov\nquasiparticles, a classical signature of superconductivity. This is in sharp\ncontrast to the pseudogap near the Cu-O bond direction (antinodal region)\nmeasured in earlier experiments.

It is well known that DPLL is\nunable to find the ground states in the clustered phase of the problem, i.e.\nthat it leads to contradictions with probability 1. However, no solid argument\nsupports this is general. A class of heuristics, which includes the well known\nUC and GUC, is introduced and studied. It is shown that any heuristic in this\nclass must fail if the clause to variable ratio is larger than some constant,\nwhich depends on the heuristic but is always smaller than the clustering\nthreshold.\n  The second result concerns the properties of random k-SAT at large clause to\nvariable ratios.

A general\ntechnique (based on the Replica method) to restrict the distribution to\nsatisfiable instances with uniform weight is introduced, and is used to\ncharacterize their solutions.

Res. Lett., 1995) which asserts that for certain values of r\nthe space of r-overconvergent p-adic modular forms of tame level N and weight k\nshould be spanned by the finite slope Hecke eigenforms. Using methods adapted\nfrom the work of Buzzard and Calegari I show that for p=2, k = 0, N = 1, this\nholds for all r in (5/12, 7/12). The proof relies on a certain factorisation of\nthe U_p operator which is known in this case but I conjecture also holds for p\n= 3 and 5; this conjecture also implies exact formulae for the set of slopes\nsimilar to those proved for p=2 by Buzzard and Calegari.\n  The same methods also provide an efficient approach to explicit computations\nof q-expansions of small slope overconvergent eigenforms, extending the\ncomputations of Gouvea and Mazur.\n","Comment: Updated version fixing some minor typos"]}]
