However, the\nstandard measure of local neighborhood clustering is typically not defined if a\nnode has one or no neighbors. In such cases, local clustering has traditionally\nbeen set to zero and this value influenced the global clustering coefficient.\nSuch a procedure leads to underestimation of the neighborhood clustering in\nsparse networks. We propose to include $\\theta$ as the proportion of leafs and\nisolated nodes to estimate the contribution of these cases and provide a\nformula for estimating a clustering coefficient excluding these cases from the\nWatts and Strogatz (1998 Nature 393 440-2) definition of the clustering\ncoefficient.
