Our study is motivated by the tight user-network\ncoupling in future mobile societies. In such a paradigm, messages are sent to\ninferred behavioral profiles, instead of explicit IDs. Our paper provides a\nsystematic framework in providing such services. First, user behavioral\nprofiles are constructed based on traces collected from two large wireless\nnetworks, and their spatio-temporal stability is analyzed. The implicit\nrelationship discovered between mobile users could be utilized to provide a\nservice for message delivery and discovery in various network environments. As\nan example application, we provide a detailed design of such a service in\nchallenged opportunistic network architecture, named CSI. We provide a fully\ndistributed solution using behavioral profile space gradients and small world\nstructures.\n  Our analysis shows that user behavioral profiles are surprisingly stable,\ni.e., the similarity of the behavioral profile of a user to its future\nbehavioral profile is above 0.8 for two days and 0.75 for one week, and remains\nabove 0.6 for five weeks. The correlation coefficient of the similarity metrics\nbetween a user pair at different time instants is above 0.7 for four days, 0.62\nfor a week, and remains above 0.5 for two weeks. Leveraging such a stability in\nuser behaviors, the CSI service achieves delivery rate very close to the\ndelay-optimal strategy (above 94%), with minimal overhead (less than 84% of the\noptimal).

We find for torus quotients of Grassmannians (for GL(n)) that we\nobtain the classical notion of \"association of projective point sets\" (see Ch.\nIII of Dolgachev-Ortland, Asterisque 165). We say a weight variety is\n\"self-dual\" if it is carried into itself by the action of the Chevalley\ninvolution. Our main theorem is a classification of those self-dual weight\nvarieties for which the induced self-map is the identity. This problem is the\n\"classical problem\" associated to the \"quantum problem\" of classifying the\nself-dual representations V of G for which the induced action of the Chevalley\ninvolution on the zero weight space V[0] is a scalar. This latter problem is\nimportant in the study of the representation of the Artin group associated to G\non V[0] obtained as the monodromy representation of the Casimir connection -\nsee Millson - Toledano Laredo arXiv:math.QA/0305062.\n"]}]
