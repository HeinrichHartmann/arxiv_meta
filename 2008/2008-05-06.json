In a variant of these\ngames, agents measure the performance of their available strategies over a\nfixed-length rolling window of prior time-steps. These are the so-called Time\nHorizon MG/MAJG/$G (THMG, THMAJG, TH$G). Their probabilistic dynamics may be\ncompletely characterized in Markov-chain formulation. Games of both the\nstandard and TH variants generate time-series that may be understood as arising\nfrom a stochastically perturbed determinism because a coin toss is used to\nbreak ties. The average over the binomially-distributed coin-tosses yields the\nunderlying determinism. In order to quantify the degree of this determinism and\nof higher-order perturbations, we decompose the sign of the time-series they\ngenerate (analogous to a market price time series) into a superposition of\nweighted Hamiltonian cycles on graphs (exactly in the TH variants and\napproximately in the standard versions). The cycle decomposition also provides\na ``dissection'' of the internal dynamics of the games and a quantitative\nmeasure of the degree of determinism. We discuss how the outperformance of\nstrategies relative to agents in the THMG (the ``illusion of control'') and the\nreverse in the THMAJG and TH$G (i.e., genuine control) may be understood on a\ncycle-by-cycle basis. The decomposition offers as well a new metric for\ncomparing different game dynamics to real-world financial time-series and a\nmethod for generating predictors. We apply the cycle predictor a real-world\nmarket, with significantly positive returns for the latter.\n","Comment: 58 page including 16 figures and 9 tables"]}]

The HGV2C\nmethod involves the construction of a computer ego (CE) based on an individual\nobject that can be either a part of the system under analysis or a newly\ncreated object based on a certain hypothesis. The CE provides a capability to\nanalyze data from a specific standpoint, e.g. from a viewpoint of a certain\nobject. The CE is constructed from two identical copies of a query object, and\nits functioning mechanism involves: a hypothesis-parameter (HP) and\ninfothyristor (IT). HP is a parameter that is introduced into an existing set\nof parameters. The HP value for one of the clones of a query object is set to\nequal 1, whereas for another clone it is greater than 1. The IT is based on the\npreviously described algorithm of iterative averaging and performs three\nfunctions: 1) computation of a similarity matrix for the group of three objects\nincluding two clones of a query object and a target object; 2) division of the\ngroup into two alternative subgroups; and 3) a successive increase of the HP\nweight in the totality of all the parameters. Initially, both clones of the\nquery object appear together in one of the subgroups as all of their parameter\nvalues, except the HP, are identical. At a certain point of the HP\nmultiplication, one of the clones moves to the group of the target object. A\nrespective number of the HP multiplications represents the dissimilarity (D)\nbetween the query and target objects. The product of D multiplied by the\ndifference in HP values of the clones is strictly constant and linearly\nincreases as the difference in HP values of the clones decreases.

We compare $G_0W_0$ quasiparticle\nband structures calculated upon LDA, sX, HSE03, PBE0, and HF functionals for\nexchange and correlation (XC) for Si, InN and ZnO. Furthermore, the HSE03\nfunctional is studied and compared to the GGA for 15 non-metallic materials for\nits use as a starting point in the calculation of quasiparticle excitation\nenergies. For this case, also the effects of selfconsistency in the $GW$\nself-energy are analysed. It is shown that the use of a gKS scheme as a\nstarting point for a perturbative QP correction can improve upon the\ndeficiencies found for LDA or GGA staring points for compounds with shallow $d$\nbands. For these solids, the order of the valence and conduction bands is often\ninverted using local or semi-local approximations for XC, which makes\nperturbative $G_0W_0$ calculations unreliable. The use of a gKS starting point\nallows for the calculation of fairly accurate band gaps even in these difficult\ncases, and generally single-shot $G_0W_0$ calculations following calculations\nusing the HSE03 functional are very close to experiment.\n"]}]
