One of characterizations of Peano\ncovering maps is via the uniqueness of homotopy lifting property for all\nlocally path-connected spaces.\n  Regular Peano covering maps over path-connected spaces are shown to be\nidentical with generalized regular covering maps introduced by Fischer and\nZastrow. If $X$ is path-connected, then every Peano covering map is equivalent\nto the projection $\\widetilde X/H\\to X$, where $H$ is a subgroup of the\nfundamental group of $X$ and $\\widetilde X$ equipped with the basic topology.\nThe projection $\\widetilde X/H\\to X$ is a Peano covering map if and only if it\nhas the unique path lifting property. We define a new topology on $\\widetilde\nX$ for which one has a characterization of $\\widetilde X/H\\to X$ having the\nunique path lifting property if $H$ is a normal subgroup of $\\pi_1(X)$. Namely,\n$H$ must be closed in $\\pi_1(X)$. Such groups include $\\pi(\\mathcal{U},x_0)$\n($\\mathcal{U}$ being an open cover of $X$) and the kernel of the natural\nhomomorphism from the fundamental group to the Cech fundamental group.\n","Comment: 25 pages, several references added plus Proposition 4.12 and Example\n  4.13"]}]

Its most important\napplication is an exact derivation of the Lamb shift formula by using no\nrenormalization.

Since then this is the only tool for handling these\ninfinities. The relation between this renormalization theory and our\nnon-perturbative theory is also discussed in this paper.\n  Our key insight is the realization that the natural complex Heisenberg group\nrepresentation splits the Hilbert space of complex valued functions defined on\nan even dimensional Euclidean space into irreducible subspaces (alias zones)\nwhich are invariant also under the action of the Landau-Zeeman operator. After\na natural modification, also the Coulomb operator can be involved into this\nzonal theory. Thus these zones can be separately investigated, both from\ngeometrical and physical point of view. In the literature only the zone spanned\nby the holomorphic polynomials has been investigated so far. This zone is the\nwell known Fock space. This paper explicitly explores also the ignored\n(infinitely many) other zones. It turns out that quantities appearing as\ninfinities on the total Hilbert space are finite in the zonal setting.
