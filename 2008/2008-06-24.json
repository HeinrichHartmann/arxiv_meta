This paper presents a measurement based probabilistic\nmodel of the dynamic process of learning that explains the experimentally\nobserved features of the normalized gain. In Hake's study with thousands of\nstudents' pre-post testing results, he observed that on average 48 courses\nemploying \"interactive engagement\" types of instruction achieved average\nnormalized gains about two standard deviations greater than did 14 courses\nsubjected to traditional instruction.

This\nfeature of the normalized gain has allowed researchers to investigate the\neffectiveness of instruction using data collected from classes with widely\ndifferent average pretest scores. However, the question of why the average\nnormalized gain has this feature and to what extent this feature is generally\npresent is not well understood. In addition, there have been debates as to what\nthe normalized gain actually measures, and concerns that it lacks a probability\nframework that undergirds psychometric methods such as Item Response Theory\n(IRT).
