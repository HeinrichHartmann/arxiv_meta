Because the comb is self-calibrating and can be shifted into\nthe ultraviolet spectral region via harmonic generation, it offers the prospect\nof greatly improved accuracy for UV and far-UV transitions. To take advantage\nof this accuracy an ultracold helium sample is needed. For measurements of the\ntriplet spectrum a magneto-optical trap (MOT) can be used to cool and trap\nmetastable 2^3S state atoms. We analyze schemes for measuring the two-photon\n$2^3S \\to 4^3S$ interval, and for resonant two-photon excitation to high\nRydberg states, $2^3S \\to 3^3P \\to n^3S,D$. We also analyze experiments on the\nsinglet-state spectrum. To accomplish this we propose schemes for producing and\ntrapping ultracold helium in the 1^1S or 2^1S state via intercombination\ntransitions. A particularly intriguing scenario is the possibility of measuring\nthe $1^1S \\to 2^1S$ transition with extremely high accuracy by use of\ntwo-photon excitation in a magic wavelength trap that operates identically for\nboth states. We predict a ``triple magic wavelength'' at 412 nm that could\nfacilitate numerous experiments on trapped helium atoms, because here the\npolarizabilities of the 1^1S, 2^1S and 2^3S states are all similar, small, and\npositive.\n","Comment: Shortened slightly and reformatted for Eur.

The average periodicity of the stripes, measured\nby fluorescence microscopy, is in the micrometer range, varying between 2 and 8\nmicrons. The observed stripe-like patterns are stabilized due to dipole-dipole\ninteractions between terminal -CF3 groups. These interactions are particularly\nstrong as compared with non-fluorinated lipids due to the low dielectric\nconstant of the surrounding media (air). These long-range dipolar interactions\ntend to elongate the domains, in contrast to the line tension that tends to\nminimize the length of the domain boundary. This behavior should be compared\nwith that of the lipid monolayer having alkyl chains, and which form spherical\nmicro-domains (bubbles) at the gas-liquid coexistence. The measured stripe\nperiodicity agrees quantitatively with a theoretical model.
