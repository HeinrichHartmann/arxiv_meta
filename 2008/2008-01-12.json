These conditions for timelike and\nspacelike conformal Ricci and conformal matter collineations for anisotropic\nfluid reduce to the conditions of perfect fluid when the heat flux and the\ntraceless anisotropic stress tensor vanish. Further, for $\\alpha=0$ (the\nconformal factor), we recover the earlier results of Ricci collineations and\nmatter collineations in each case of timelike and spacelike conformal Ricci\ncollineations and conformal matter collineations for the perfect fluid. Thus\nour results give the generalization of the results already available in the\nliterature. It is worth noticing that the conditions of conformal matter\ncollineations can be derived from the conditions of conformal Ricci\ncollineations or vice versa under certain constraints.\n","Comment: 16 pages, accepted for publication in Chinese J.
