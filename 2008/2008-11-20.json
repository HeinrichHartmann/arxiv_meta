They are especially useful in external\nmemory, where their query performance approaches the ideal cost of just one\ndisk access. Knuth gave an elegant analysis showing that with some simple\ncollision resolution strategies such as linear probing or chaining, the\nexpected average number of disk I/Os of a lookup is merely $1+1/2^{\\Omega(b)}$,\nwhere each I/O can read a disk block containing $b$ items. Inserting a new item\ninto the hash table also costs $1+1/2^{\\Omega(b)}$ I/Os, which is again almost\nthe best one can do if the hash table is entirely stored on disk. However, this\nassumption is unrealistic since any algorithm operating on an external hash\ntable must have some internal memory (at least $\\Omega(1)$ blocks) to work\nwith. The availability of a small internal memory buffer can dramatically\nreduce the amortized insertion cost to $o(1)$ I/Os for many external memory\ndata structures. In this paper we study the inherent query-insertion tradeoff\nof external hash tables in the presence of a memory buffer. In particular, we\nshow that for any constant $c>1$, if the query cost is targeted at\n$1+O(1/b^{c})$ I/Os, then it is not possible to support insertions in less than\n$1-O(1/b^{\\frac{c-1}{4}})$ I/Os amortized, which means that the memory buffer\nis essentially useless. While if the query cost is relaxed to $1+O(1/b^{c})$\nI/Os for any constant $c<1$, there is a simple dynamic hash table with $o(1)$\ninsertion cost.

The\nmodelled results are examined at the surface and on a series of time-height\ncross sections at several locations spread over the Atlantic, the Indian, and\nthe Pacific Oceans. Comparison of model with surface measurements at remote MBL\nstations indicate a close agreement. The most striking feature of the\nhemispheric spring ozone maximum in the MBL can be most easily identified at\nthe NH sites of Westman Island, Bermuda, and Mauna Loa, and at the SH site of\nSamoa. Modelled ozone vertical distributions in the troposphere are compared\nwith ozone profiles. For the Atlantic and the Indian sites, the model generally\nproduces a hemispheric spring ozone maximum close to those of the measurements.\nThe model also produces a spring ozone maximum in the northeastern and tropical\nnorth Pacific close to those measurements, and at sites in the NH high\nlatitudes. The good agreement between model and measurements indicate that the\nmodel can reproduce the proposed mechanisms responsible for producing the\nspring ozone maximum in these regions of the MBL, lending confidence in the use\nof the model to investigate MBL ozone chemistry (see part 2 and part 3). The\nspring ozone maximum in the tropical central south Pacific and eastern\nequatorial Pacific are less well reproduced by the model, indicating that both\nthe transport of $O_3$ precursors from biomass burning emissions taking place\nin southeastern Asia, Australia, Oceania, southern Africa, and South America\nare not well represented in the model in these regions. Overall, the model\nproduces a better simulation at sites where the stratosphere and biomass\nburning emissions are the major contributors.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 8 figures"]}]

While there are\nconceptual issues already when the mean rate of background is precisely known,\nthe issues are even more difficult when the mean background rate has\nnon-negligible uncertainty. After describing a variety of methods to be found\nin the HEP and GRA literature, we consider in detail three classes of\nalgorithms and evaluate them over a wide range of parameter space, by the\ncriterion of how close the ensemble-average Type I error rate (rejection of the\nbackground-only hypothesis when it is true) compares with the nominal\nsignificance level given by the algorithm. We recommend wider use of an\nalgorithm firmly grounded in frequentist tests of the ratio of Poisson means,\nalthough for very low counts the over-coverage can be severe due to the effect\nof discreteness. We extend the studies of Cranmer, who found that a popular\nBayesian-frequentist hybrid can undercover severely when taken to high Z\nvalues. We also examine the profile likelihood method, which has long been used\nin GRA and HEP; it provides an excellent approximation in much of the parameter\nspace, as previously studied by Rolke and collaborators.\n","Comment: In v4, added line to Table 1 so that Z_PL is given separately for L_G\n  and L_P; made numerics in Z_PL identical to C++ code which is now posted at\n  http://phystat.org/0811001 .
