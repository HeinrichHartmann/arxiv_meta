It has recently\nbeen suggested that in the low-stimulus regime (h ~ 0) the response function\nF(h) of hypercubic deterministic systems behaves as a power law, F ~ h^m.\nMoreover the response exponent m has been predicted to depend only on the\ndimensionality d of the lattice, m = 1/(1+d) [T.

In order to test this prediction, we study the response\nfunction of excitable lattices modeled by either coupled Morris-Lecar equations\nor Greenberg-Hastings cellular automata. We show that the prediction is\nverified in our model systems for d = 1, 2, and 3, provided that a minimum set\nof conditions is satisfied. Under these conditions, the dynamic range - which\nmeasures the range of stimulus intensities that can be coded by the network\nactivity - increases with the dimensionality d of the network. The power law\nscenario breaks down, however, if the system can exhibit self-sustained\nactivity (spiral waves). In this case, we recover a scenario that is common to\nprobabilistic excitable media: as a function of the conductance coupling G\namong the excitable elements, the dynamic range is maximized precisely at the\ncritical value G_c above which self-sustained activity becomes stable.

We find an effective\ntemperature (T_eff) and surface gravity (log g) for each DA WD by fitting\nBalmer-line profiles from model atmospheres to the observed spectra. WD\nevolutionary models are then invoked to derive masses and cooling times for\neach DA WD. Of the 17 DAs, five are at the approximate distance modulus of the\ncluster. Another WD with a distance modulus 0.45 mag brighter than that of the\ncluster could be a double-degenerate binary cluster member, but is more likely\nto be a field WD. We place the five single cluster member WDs in the empirical\ninitial-final mass relation and find that three of them lie very close to the\npreviously derived linear relation; two have WD masses significantly below the\nrelation. These outliers may have experienced some sort of enhanced mass loss\nor binary evolution; however, it is quite possible that these WDs are simply\ninterlopers from the field WD population. Eight of the 17 DA WDs show\nsignificant CaII K absorption; comparison of the absorption strength with the\nWD distances suggests that the absorption is interstellar, though this cannot\nbe confirmed with the current data.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 13 figures.
