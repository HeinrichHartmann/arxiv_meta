In this paper we propose an agent-based model to show that randomly\ndistributed social behavior by way of local interaction converges to a state\nwith a multimodal distribution of behavior. This can be interpreted as a\ncoexistence of different social norms, a result that goes beyond previous\ninvestigations. The model is discrete in time and space, behavior is\ncharacterized in a continuous state space. The adaptation of social behavior by\neach agent is based on attractive and repulsive forces caused by friendly and\nadversary relations among agents. The model is analyzed both analytically and\nby means of spatio-temporal computer simulations. It provides conditions under\nwhich we find convergence towards a single norm, coexistence of two opposing\nnorms, and coexistence of a multitude of norms. For the latter case, we also\nshow the evolution of the spatio-temporal distribution of behavior.\n"]}]
