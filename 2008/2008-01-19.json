A wide distribution of spin-flip times\nis derived from the single-phonon cross-relaxation mechanism for a\ndangling-bond interacting with the tunneling two-level systems of the amorphous\ninterface. The temperature and frequency dependence is sensitive to three\nenergy scales: The dangling-bond spin Zeeman energy delta, as well as the\nminimum (E_min) and maximum (E_max) values for the energy splittings of the\ntunneling two-level systems. We compare and fit our model parameters to a\nrecent experiment probing spin coherence of antimony donors implanted in\nnuclear-spin-free silicon [T. Schenkel {\\it et al.}, Appl. Phys. Lett. 88,\n112101 (2006)], and conclude that a dangling-bond area density of the order of\n10^{14}cm^{-2} is consistent with the data. This enables the prediction of\nsingle spin qubit coherence times as a function of the distance from the\ninterface and the dangling-bond area density in a real device structure. We\napply our theory to calculations of magnetic flux noise affecting SQUID devices\ndue to their Si/SiO_2 substrate. Our explicit estimates of flux noise in SQUIDs\nlead to a noise spectral density of the order of 10^{-12}Phi_{0}^{2} {Hz}^{-1}\nat f=1Hz. This value might explain the origin of flux noise in some SQUID\ndevices. Finally, we consider the suppression of these effects using surface\npassivation with hydrogen, and the residual nuclear-spin noise resulting from a\nperfect silicon-hydride surface.\n","Comment: Final published version"]}]

Based on an algorithmic idea by\nHenley, we simulate a stochastic process of classical dimer configurations in\ncontinuous time and perform a stochastic analytical continuation to obtain the\ndynamical correlations in momentum space and the frequency domain. This\napproach allows us to observe directly the dispersion relations and the\nevolution of the spectral intensity within the Brillouin zone beyond the\nsingle-mode approximation. On the square lattice, we confirm analytical\npredictions related to soft modes close to the wavevectors (pi,pi) and (pi,0)\nand further reveal the existence of shadow bands close to the wavevector (0,0).\nOn the cubic lattice the spectrum is also gapless but here only a single soft\nmode at (pi,pi,pi) is found, as predicted by the single mode approximation. The\nsoft mode has a quadratic dispersion at very long wavelength, but crosses over\nto a linear behavior very rapidly. We believe this to be the remnant of the\nlinearly dispersing \"photon\" of the Coulomb phase. Finally the triangular\nlattice is in a fully gapped liquid phase where the bottom of the dimer\nspectrum exhibits a rich structure. At the M point the gap is minimal and the\nspectral response is dominated by a sharp quasiparticle peak. On the other\nhand, at the X point the spectral function is much broader. We sketch a\npossible explanation based on the crossing of the coherent dimer excitations\ninto the two-vison continuum.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 7 figures, published version"]}]
