The disk inclination, which\nsignificantly affect SED modeling, is often unknown. We attempted to resolve\nthe disks around CQ Tau and MWC 758, to provide accurate constraints on the\ndisk parameters, in particular the temperature and surface density\ndistribution. We report arcsecond resolution observations of dust and CO line\nemissions with the IRAM array. The disk properties are derived using a standard\ndisk model. We use the Meudon PDR code to study the chemistry. The two disks\nshare some common properties. The mean CO abundance is low despite disk\ntemperatures above the CO condensation temperature. Furthermore, the CO surface\ndensity and dust opacity have different radial dependence. The CQ Tau disk\nappears warmer, and perhaps less dense than that of MWC 758. Modeling the\nchemistry, we find that photodissociation of CO is a viable mechanism to\nexplain the low abundance. The photospheric flux is not sufficient for this: a\nstrong UV excess is required. In CQ Tau, the high temperature is consistent\nwith expectation for a PDR. The PDR model has difficulty explaining the mild\ntemperatures obtained in MWC 758, for which a low gas-to-dust ratio is\npreferred. A yet unexplored alternative could be that, despite currently high\ngas temperatures, CO remains trapped in grains, as the models suggest that\nlarge grains can be cold enough to prevent thermal desorption of CO. The low\ninclination of the CQ Tau disk, ~30^\\circ, challenges previous interpretations\ngiven for the UX Ori - like luminosity variations of this star.

Their recursion relations have a more special form; the\nbest way to describe them is in terms of the free cumulant generating function\nof the state of orthogonality, which turns out to satisfy a type of\nsecond-order difference equation. If the difference equation is in fact first\norder, and the state is tracial, we show that the state is necessarily a\nrotation of a free product state. We also describe interesting examples of\nnon-tracial infinitely divisible states with orthogonal free Sheffer\npolynomials.\n","Comment: 19 pages; minor improvements"]}]

In social dilemma games with a fixed\npopulation size, heterogeneity in the number of contacts per player is known to\npromote evolution of cooperation. Under a common assumption of positively\nbiased payoff structure, well-connected players earn much by playing\nfrequently, and cooperation once adopted by well-connected players is\nunbeatable and spreads to others. However, maintaining a social contact can be\ncostly, which would prevent local payoffs from being positively biased. In\nreplicator-type evolutionary dynamics, it is shown that even a relatively small\nparticipation cost extinguishes the merit of heterogeneous networks in terms of\ncooperation. In this situation, more connected players earn less so that they\nare no longer spreaders of cooperation. Instead, those with fewer contacts win\nand guide the evolution. The participation cost, or the baseline payoff, is\nirrelevant in homogeneous populations but is essential for evolutionary games\non heterogeneous networks.\n","Comment: 4 figures + 3 supplementary figures"]}]
