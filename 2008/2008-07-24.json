This is accomplished through a mapping to\nthe kagome Ising model, for which exact analytic solutions exist. We derive the\ncomplete finite temperature phase diagram for this XXZ-Ising model, including\nthe residual zero temperature entropies of the seven ground state phases.\nWhereas the disordered (spin liquid) ground state of the pure Ising TKL model\nhas macroscopic residual entropy ln72=4.2767... per unit cell, the introduction\nof transverse(quantum) couplings between neighboring $a$-spins reduces this\nentropy to 2.5258... per unit cell. In the presence of applied magnetic field,\nwe map the TKL XXZ-Ising model to the kagome Ising model with three-spin\ninteractions, and derive the ground state phase diagram. A small (or even\ninfinitesimal) field leads to a new phase that corresponds to a\nnon-intersecting loop gas on the kagome lattice, with entropy 1.4053... per\nunit cell and a mean magnetization for the b-spins of 0.12(1) per site.

To study\ntheir efficiency and compare it to one of the deterministic solutions, one is\nled to compute certain quantities, namely the hitting times and the cover time.\nUntil now, only bounds on these quantities were defined. First, this paper\npresents two generalizations of the notions of hitting and cover times to\nweighted graphs. Indeed, the properties of random walks on symmetrically\nweighted graphs provide interesting results on random walk based distributed\nalgorithms, such as local load balancing. Both of these generalization are\nproposed to precisely represent the behaviour of these algorithms, and to take\ninto account what the weights represent. Then, we propose an algorithm to\ncompute the n^2 hitting times on a weighted graph of n vertices, which we\nimprove to obtain a O(n^3) complexity. This complexity is the lowest up to now.\nThis algorithm computes both of the generalizations that we propose for the\nhitting times on a weighted graph. Finally, we provide the first algorithm to\ncompute the cover time (in both senses) of a graph. We improve it to achieve a\ncomplexity of O(n^3 2^n). The algorithms that we present are all robust to a\ntopological change in a limited number of edges. This property allows us to use\nthem on dynamic graphs.\n","Comment: 18 pages"]}]

Recently, flexible boundary\nconditions have been developed to produce the correct long-range strain field\nfrom a defect--effectively \"embedding\" a defect in a finite cell with infinite\nbulk response, isolating it from either periodic images or free surfaces.\nFlexible boundary conditions require the calculation of the bulk response with\nthe lattice Green function (LGF). While the LGF can be computed from the\ndynamical matrix, for supercell methods (periodic boundary conditions) it can\nonly be calculated up to a maximum range. We illustrate how to accurately\ncalculate the lattice Green function and estimate the error using a cutoff\ndynamical matrix combined with knowledge of the long-range behavior of the\nlattice Green function. The effective range of deviation of the lattice Green\nfunction from the long-range elastic behavior provides an important length\nscale in multiscale quasi-continuum and flexible boundary-condition\ncalculations, and measures the error introduced with periodic boundary\nconditions.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 6 figures"]}]
