Such bi-directional traffic occurring in a narrow channel can\neasily lead to jamming. How then is passage between the nucleus and cytoplasm\nmaintained under the varying conditions that arise during the lifetime of the\ncell? Here, we address this question using computer simulations in which the\nbehaviour of the ensemble of transporting cargoes is analyzed under different\nconditions. We suggest that traffic can exist in two distinct modes, depending\non concentration of cargoes and dissociation rates of the transport\nreceptor-cargo complexes from the pores. In one mode, which prevails when\ndissociation is quick and cargo concentration is low, transport in either\ndirection proceeds uninterrupted by the other direction. The result is that\noverall-traffic-direction fluctuates rapidly and unsystematically between\nimport and export. Remarkably, when cargo concentrations are high and\ndissociation is slow, another mode takes over in which traffic proceeds in one\ndirection for a certain extent of time, after which it flips direction for\nanother period. The switch between this, more regulated, mode of transport and\nthe other, quickly fluctuating state, does not require an active gating\nmechanism but rather occurs spontaneously through the dynamics of the\ntransported particles themselves. The determining factor for the behaviour of\ntraffic is found to be the exit rate from the pore channel, which is directly\nrelated to the activity of the Ran system that controls the loading and release\nof cargo in the appropriate cellular compartment.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 4 figures"]}]

For example, in this way we obtain the fastest known algorithm\nfor the P-matrix generalized linear complementarity problem with a constant\nnumber of blocks. We also give two new characterizations of LP-type problems:\nthey are equivalent to acyclic violator spaces, as well as to concrete LP-type\nproblems (informally, the constraints in a concrete LP-type problem are subsets\nof a linearly ordered ground set, and the value of a set of constraints is the\nminimum of its intersection).\n","Comment: 28 pages, 5 figures, extended abstract was presented at ESA 2006;\n  author spelling fixed"]}]

We propose\ntwo methods of reduction of dynamics to the form of planar Hamiltonian\ndynamical systems for models with a time dependent equation of state. The\nsolutions are analyzed on two-dimensional phase space in the variables $(x,\n\\dot{x})$ where $x$ is a function of a scale factor $a$. Then we show how the\nhorizon problem may be solved on some evolutional paths. It is shown that the\nmodels with negative curvature overcome the horizon and flatness problems. The\npresented method of reduction can be adopted to the analysis of dynamics of the\nuniverse with the general form of the equation of state $p=\\gamma(a)\\epsilon$.\nThis is demonstrated using as an example the dynamics of VSL models filled with\na non-interacting fluid. We demonstrate a new type of evolution near the\ninitial singularity caused by a varying speed of light. The singularity-free\noscillating universes are also admitted for positive cosmological constant. We\nconsider a quantum VSL FRW closed model with radiation and show that the\nhighest tunnelling rate occurs for a constant velocity of light if $c(a)\n\\propto a^n$ and $-1 < n \\le 0$. It is also proved that the considered class of\nmodels is structurally unstable for the case of $n < 0$.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 5 figures, RevTeX4; final version to appear in PRD"]}]
