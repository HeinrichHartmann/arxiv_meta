However, most of those that have\nappeared in the literature are either planar or are obtained from perturbations\nof planar orbits. Here we exhibit a number of new three-dimensional periodic\nn-body orbits with equal masses and cubic symmetry. We found these orbits\nnumerically by minimizing the action as a function of the trajectories' Fourier\ncoefficients. We also give numerical evidence that a planar 3-body orbit first\nfound in [H\\'enon, 1976], rediscovered by [Moore 1993], and found to exist for\ndifferent masses by [Nauenberg 2001], is dynamically stable.\n  It is a pleasure to dedicate this paper to Philip Holmes.\n","Comment: Corrected initial conditions of the cubic orbit to match the\n  published version"]}]

We model movement of\nqubits with noisy SWAP operations. For this architecture we design a\nfault-tolerant coding scheme using the concatenated [[7,1,3]] Steane code. Our\nscheme is potentially applicable to ion-trap and solid-state quantum\ntechnologies. We calculate a lower bound on the noise threshold for our local\nmodel using a detailed failure probability analysis. We obtain a threshold of\n1.85 x 10^-5 for the local setting, where memory error rates are one-tenth of\nthe failure rates of gates, measurement, and preparation steps. For the\nanalogous nonlocal setting, we obtain a noise threshold of 3.61 x 10^-5.
