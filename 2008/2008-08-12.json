In this paper I work out\nthe diagram and show that that result, though mathematically sound, is not\nphysically correct, because it misses a fundamental physical constraint imposed\nby the conservation of momentum, which should reduce by one the total number of\nlinearly independent (l.i.) functions $F_4$ in the overall solution. Taking\ninto account that the momenta flowing along the three legs of the diagram are\nconstrained by momentum conservation, the number of overall l.i. functions that\nenter the most general solution must reduce accordingly.\n  To determine the exact structure and content of the analytic solution for the\nthree-point function, I use the analogy that exists between Feynman diagrams\nand electric circuit networks, in which the electric current flowing in the\nnetwork plays the role of the momentum flowing in the lines of a Feynman\ndiagram. This analogy is employed to define exactly which three out of the four\nhypergeometric functions are relevant to the analytic solution for the Feynman\ndiagram. The analogy is built based on the equivalence between electric\nresistance circuit networks of type \"Y\" and \"Delta\" in which flows a conserved\ncurrent.

Entanglement, a quantum phenomenon with no\nclassical counterpart, has been identified as an important and quantifiable\nresource in many areas of theoretical quantum information science, including\nquantum error correction, quantum cryptography, and quantum algorithms. We\nfirst investigate the equivalence classes of a particular class of entangled\nstates (known as graph states due to their association with mathematical\ngraphs) under local operations. We prove that for graph states corresponding to\ngraphs with neither cycles of length 3 nor 4, the equivalence classes can be\ncharacterized in a very simple way. We also present software for analyzing and\nmanipulating graph states. We then study quantum error-correcting codes whose\ncodewords are highly entangled states. An important area of investigation\nconcerning QECCs is to determine which resources are necessary in order to\ncarry out any computation on the code to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while\nsimultaneously maintaining a high degree of resistance to noise. We prove that\ntransversal gates, which are designed to prevent the propagation of errors\nthrough a system, are insufficient to achieve universal computation on almost\nall QECCs. Finally, we study the problem of creating efficient quantum circuits\nfor creating entangling measurements. Entangling measurements can be used to\nharness the apparent extra computing power of quantum systems by allowing us to\nextract information about the global, collective properties of a quantum state\nusing local measurements.

The NS picture is equivalent to\nthe CS picture, as long as the phases $\\phi$ in the laser fields are randomly\ndistributed, as M{\\o}lmer argues [\\pra {\\bf 55}, 3195 (1997)]. However, the\nclaim by Rudolph and Sanders [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 87}, 077903 (2001)] has a\nfew gaps. First, they make an assumption that is not necessarily true in the\ncalculation of a density operator involved with a two-mode squeezed state. We\nshow that there exists entanglement in the density operator without defying the\nassumption that phases are randomly distributed. Moreover, using a concept of\npicture-invariance, we argue that it is not that criteria for quantum\nteleportation are not satisfied. We discuss an analogy between the controversy\non the CS versus NS pictures to that on the heliocentric versus geocentric\npictures.\n","Comment: 4 pages, RevTex"]}]
