A PIC group decoding decodes the symbols embedded in\nan STBC by dividing them into several groups and decoding each group separately\nafter a linear PIC operation is implemented. It can be viewed as an\nintermediate decoding between the maximum likelihood (ML) receiver that decodes\nall the embedded symbols together, i.e., all the embedded symbols are in a\nsingle group, and the zero-forcing (ZF) receiver that decodes all the embedded\nsymbols separately and independently, i.e., each group has and only has one\nembedded symbol, after the ZF operation is implemented. Our proposed design\ncriterion for the PIC group decoding to achieve full diversity is an\nintermediate condition between the loosest ML full rank criterion of codewords\nand the strongest ZF linear independence condition of the column vectors in the\nequivalent channel matrix. We also propose asymptotically optimal (AO) group\ndecoding algorithm, which is an intermediate decoding between the MMSE decoding\nalgorithm and the ML decoding algorithm. The design criterion for the PIC group\ndecoding applies to the AO group decoding algorithm. It is well-known that the\nsymbol rate for a full rank linear STBC can be full, i.e., n_t for n_t transmit\nantennas. It has been recently shown that its rate is upper bounded by 1 if a\ncode achieves full diversity with a linear receiver. The intermediate criterion\nproposed in this paper provides the possibility for codes of rates between n_t\nand 1 that achieve full diversity with a PIC group decoding. This therefore\nprovides a complexity-performance-rate tradeoff.\n","Comment: 45 pages, 3 figures, partially appeared in the International Symp. on\n  Information Theory (ISIT), Toronto, Canada, July 6-11, 2008"]}]

We stratify the types of\ndeformations allowed into three problems. The main result for each problem\nstates that the moduli space is locally homeomorphic to the kernel of a smooth\nmap between smooth manifolds. In each case, the map in question can be\nconsidered as a projection from the infinitesimal deformation space onto the\nobstruction space. Thus, when there are no obstructions the moduli space is a\nsmooth manifold. Furthermore, we calculate a lower bound on the expected\ndimension of the moduli space. Finally we show that, in weakening the condition\non the G_2 structure of the ambient 7-manifold, there is a generic smoothness\nresult for the moduli spaces of deformations corresponding to our second and\nthird problems.\n","Comment: 48 pages"]}]
