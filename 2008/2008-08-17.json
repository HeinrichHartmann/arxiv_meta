Quasiperturbative connected quadruple\nexcitations, (Q), converge smoothly as $\\propto L^{-3}$ starting with the\ncc-pVTZ basis set, while the cc-pVDZ basis set causes overshooting of the\ncontribution in highly polar systems. Higher-order connected quadruples display\nonly weak, but somewhat erratic, basis set dependence. Connected quintuple\nexcitations converge very rapidly with the basis set, to the point where even\nan unpolarized double-zeta basis set yields useful numbers. In cases where\nfully iterative CCSDTQ5 (coupled cluster up to connected quintuples)\ncalculations are not an option, CCSDTQ(5) (i.e., coupled cluster up to\nconnected quadruples plus a quasiperturbative connected quintuples correction)\ncannot be relied upon in the presence of significant nondynamical correlation,\nwhereas CCSDTQ(5)$_\\Lambda$ represents a viable alternative.

However, experimentally the\nopposite effect has been recently observed: ferromagnetism appears in some\nnano-sized manganites with a composition such that the antiferromagnetic\ncharge-ordered CE state is observed in the bulk. A possible origin is the\ndevelopment of ferromagnetic correlations at the surface of these small\nsystems. To clarify these puzzling experimental observations, we have studied\nthe two-orbital double-exchange model near half-doping n=0.5, using open\nboundary conditions to simulate the surface of either bulk or nano-sized\nmanganites. Considering the enhancement of surface charge density due to a\npossible AO termination (A = trivalent/divalent ion composite, O = oxygen), an\nunexpected surface phase-separated state emerges when the model is studied\nusing Monte Carlo techniques on small clusters.
