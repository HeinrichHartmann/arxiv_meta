For this\npurpose, a particularly simple Lorentz-violating modification of the Maxwell\ntheory of photons is considered, which maintains gauge invariance, CPT, and\nrenormalization. With a standard spin-one-half Dirac particle minimally coupled\nto this nonstandard photon, the resulting modified-quantum-electrodynamics\nmodel involves nineteen dimensionless \"deformation parameters.\" Ten of these\nparameters lead to birefringence and are already tightly constrained by\nastrophysics. New bounds on the remaining nine nonbirefringent parameters have\nbeen obtained from the inferred absence of vacuum Cherenkov radiation in\nultrahigh-energy-cosmic-ray (UHECR) events. The resulting astrophysics bounds\nimprove considerably upon current laboratory bounds and the implications of\nthis \"null experiment\" may be profound, both for elementary particle physics\nand cosmology.\n","Comment: plenary talk at the 20-th Rencontre de Blois \"Challenges in Particle\n  Astrophysics\", May 18-23, 2008; v4: final arXiv version with minor changes"]}]

GMR arises from differential scattering of\nthe majority and minority spin electrons by a ferromagnet (FM) so that the\nresistance when the FM layers separated by non-magnetic (NM) spacers are\naligned by an applied field is different to when they are antiparallel. In 1996\nSlonczewski[3] and Berger[4] predicted that a large spin-polarised current\ncould transfer spin-angular momentum and so exert a spin transfer torque (STT)\nsufficient to switch thin FM layers between stable magnetisation states[5] and,\nfor even higher current densities, drive continuous precession which emits\nmicrowaves[6]. Thus, while GMR is a purely passive phenomenon which ultimately\ndepends on the intrinsic band structure of the FM, STT adds an active element\nto spintronics by which the direction of the magnetisation may be manipulated.\nHere we show that highly non-equilibrium spin injection can modify the\nscattering asymmetry and, by extension, the intrinsic magnetism of a FM.

TPM experiments exploit the Brownian motion of a DNA-tethered\nbead to probe biologically relevant conformational changes of the tether. In\nthese experiments, a change in the extent of the bead's random motion is used\nas a reporter of the underlying macromolecular dynamics and is often deemed\nsufficient for TPM analysis. However, a complete understanding of how the\nmotion depends on the physical properties of the tethered particle complex\nwould permit more quantitative and accurate evaluation of TPM data. For\ninstance, such understanding can help extract details about a looped complex\ngeometry (or multiple coexisting geometries) from TPM data. To better\ncharacterize the measurement capabilities of TPM experiments involving DNA\ntethers, we have carried out a detailed calibration of TPM magnitude as a\nfunction of DNA length and particle size. We also explore how experimental\nparameters such as acquisition time and exposure time affect the apparent\nmotion of the tethered particle. We vary the DNA length from 200bp to 2.6kbp\nand consider particle diameters of 200, 490 and 970nm.
