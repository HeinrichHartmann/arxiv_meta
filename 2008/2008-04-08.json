Both Ne and S are primary elements produced in\nalpha-chain reactions, following C and O burning in stars, making their yields\ndepend very little on the stellar metallicity.

Such large MIMO\nsystems will be of immense interest because of the very high spectral\nefficiencies possible in such systems.

With an outer turbo code, the proposed detector achieves good\ncoded bit error performance as well. For example, in a 600 transmit and 600\nreceive antennas V-BLAST system with a high spectral efficiency of 200 bps/Hz\n(using BPSK and rate-1/3 turbo code), our simulation results show that the\nproposed detector performs close to within about 4.6 dB from theoretical\ncapacity.

It is assumed that every node in the\nnetwork has its own power constraint. A two-step amplify-and-forward protocol\nis used, in which the transmitter and relays not only use match filters to form\na beam at the receiver but also adaptively adjust their transmit powers\naccording to the channel strength information. For a network with any number of\nrelays and no direct link, the optimal power control is solved analytically.\nThe complexity of finding the exact solution is linear in the number of relays.\nOur results show that the transmitter should always use its maximal power and\nthe optimal power used at a relay is not a binary function. It can take any\nvalue between zero and its maximum transmit power. Also, this value depends on\nthe quality of all other channels in addition to the relay's own channels.\nDespite this coupling fact, distributive strategies are proposed in which, with\nthe aid of a low-rate broadcast from the receiver, a relay needs only its own\nchannel information to implement the optimal power control. Simulated\nperformance shows that network beamforming achieves the maximal diversity and\noutperforms other existing schemes. Then, beamforming in networks with a direct\nlink are considered. We show that when the direct link exists during the first\nstep only, the optimal power control is the same as that of networks with no\ndirect link. For networks with a direct link during the second step, recursive\nnumerical algorithms are proposed to solve the power control problem.\nSimulation shows that by adjusting the transmitter and relays' powers\nadaptively, network performance is significantly improved.\n","Comment: 33 pages, 12 figures.
