The model does not\nrequire any plasma effects to be involved in order to make the reconnection\nfast. In fact, it shows that the degree of magnetic field stochasticity\ncontrols the reconnection. The turbulence in the model is assumed to be\nsubAlfvenic, with the magnetic field only slightly perturbed. This ensures that\nthe reconnection happens in generic astrophysical environments and the model\ndoes not appeal to any unphysical concepts, similar to the turbulent magnetic\ndiffusivity concept, which is employed in the kinematic magnetic dynamo. The\ninterest to that model has recently increased due to successful numerical\ntestings of the model predictions. In view of this, we discuss implications of\nthe model, including the first-order Fermi acceleration of cosmic rays, that\nthe model naturally entails, bursts of reconnection, that can be associated\nwith Solar flares, as well as, removal of magnetic flux during star-formation.\n","Comment: 8 pages, invited talk, \"Revista Mexicana\", couple of typos corrected"]}]

At the string scale, we can break the gauge symmetry\ndown to the Standard Model (SM) gauge symmetry, achieve the gauge coupling\nunification naturally, and decouple all the extra chiral exotic particles.\nThus, we have the supersymmetric SMs with/without SM singlet(s) below the\nstring scale.
