We describe how this scheme\nallows to establish multiparticle entanglement between particles belonging to\ndistant users in a communication network through a prior distribution of\nsinglets followed by only local measurements. We show that this scheme can be\nregarded as a method of generating entangled states of many particles and\ncompare it with existing schemes using simple quantum computational networks.\nWe highlight the practical advantages of using a series of entanglement\nswappings during the distribution of entangled particles between two parties.\nApplications of multiparticle entangled states in cryptographic conferencing\nand in reading messages from more than one source through a single measurement\nare also described.\n","Comment: 9 pages revtex, 7 eps figures"]}]

A quantum robot is a mobile quantum\nsystem that includes a quantum computer and needed ancillary systems on board.\nQuantum robots carry out tasks whose goals include specified changes in the\nstate of the environment or carrying out measurements on the environment. Each\ntask is a sequence of alternating computation and action phases. Computation\nphase activities include determination of the action to be carried out in the\nnext phase and possible recording of information on neighborhood environmental\nsystem states. Action phase activities include motion of the quantum robot and\nchanges of neighborhood environment system states. Models of quantum robots and\ntheir interactions with environments are described using discrete space and\ntime. To each task is associated a unitary step operator T that gives the\nsingle time step dynamics. T = T_{a}+T_{c} is a sum of action phase and\ncomputation phase step operators. Conditions that T_{a} and T_{c} should\nsatisfy are given along with a description of the evolution as a sum over paths\nof completed phase input and output states. A simple example of a task carrying\nout a measurement on a very simple environment is analyzed. A decision tree for\nthe task is presented and discussed in terms of sums over phase paths. One sees\nthat no definite times or durations are associated with the phase steps in the\ntree and that the tree describes the successive phase steps in each path in the\nsum.\n","Comment: 30 Latex pages, 3 Postscript figures, Minor mathematical corrections,\n  accepted for publication, Phys Rev A"]}]
