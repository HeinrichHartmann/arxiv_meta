We adopt the Kuhfuss (1986) model of convection, reformulated for\nthe use in stellar pulsation hydrocodes. Physical as well as numerical\nassumptions of the code are described in detail. Described tests show, that our\nmodels are numerically robust and reproduce basic observational constraints.\n  We discuss the effects of different treatment of some quantities in other\npulsation hydrocodes. Our most important finding concerns the treatment of the\nturbulent source function in convectively stable regions. In our code we allow\nfor negative values of source function in convectively stable zones, which\nreflects negative buoyancy. However, some authors restrict the source term to\nnon-negative values. We show that this assumption leads to very high turbulent\nenergies in convectively stable regions. The effect looks like overshooting,\nbut it is not, because turbulence is generated by pulsations. Also, turbulent\nelements do not carry kinetic nor thermal energy, into convectively stable\nlayers.
