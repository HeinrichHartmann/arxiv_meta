The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees\nwith this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the\nMoon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil\nevidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5\nbillion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests\nthat the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the\nEarth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from\nEarth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1).
