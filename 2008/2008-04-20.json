Quantumness coincides with the previously proposed measures\nin special cases and it vanishes for separable states - a feature not captured\nby the measures proposed earlier. It is found that an optimal generalized\nmeasurement on one of the parts leaves the overall state in its closest\nseparable form, which shares the same marginal for the other part, implying\nthat quantumness is non-zero for all entangled bipartite states and it serves\nas an upper bound to the relative entropy of entanglement.\n","Comment: 5 pages, no figures, Revtex, Minor changes; Accepted for publication\n  in Physical Review Letters"]}]

This cohomology is intimately related to vector-valued Siegel modular\nforms. The corresponding scheme in level 1 was carried out in [FvdG].
