Considering a particular (though simple)\nregression problem, we prove that VFCV with a bounded V is suboptimal for model\nselection, because it ``overpenalizes'' all the more that V is large. Hence,\nasymptotic optimality requires V to go to infinity. However, when the\nsignal-to-noise ratio is low, it appears that overpenalizing is necessary, so\nthat the optimal V is not always the larger one, despite of the variability\nissue. This is confirmed by some simulated data. In order to improve on the\nprediction performance of VFCV, we define a new model selection procedure,\ncalled ``V-fold penalization'' (penVF). It is a V-fold subsampling version of\nEfron's bootstrap penalties, so that it has the same computational cost as\nVFCV, while being more flexible. In a heteroscedastic regression framework,\nassuming the models to have a particular structure, we prove that penVF\nsatisfies a non-asymptotic oracle inequality with a leading constant that tends\nto 1 when the sample size goes to infinity. In particular, this implies\nadaptivity to the smoothness of the regression function, even with a highly\nheteroscedastic noise.
