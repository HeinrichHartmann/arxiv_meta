Under weak energy condition, this would imply $\\rho = \\Lambda =0$ for\nESU. This means that if one would need to invoke a source of ``repulsive\ngravity'' in some model, (i) the model must be non-static, (ii) the repulsive\ngravity must be due to a ``quintessence'' or a ``dark energy'' fluid with\nnegative pressure and appear on the right hand side (RHS) of the Einstein\nequation through $T_{ij}$ rather than through a fundamental constant residing\non the LHS of the same equation, and (iii) energy density of both normal matter\nand the ``dark energy fluid'' should be time dependent. In fact, the repulsive\ngravity would be due to a time independent $\\Lambda$, it would be extremely\ndifficult to understand why the associated energy density should be\napproximately $10^{120}$ times lower than the value predicted by quantum\ngravity. On the other hand, for a dark energy fluid whose energy density is\ntime dependent, it would be much easier to understand such an extremely low\npresent energy density: the original initial value of the energy density of the\nfluid could be equal to the quantum gravity value while the present low value\nis due to decay with time.\n","Comment: Revised after referee comments"]}]

For\nevery nonnegative t we consider the transformation $\\mathbb B_t : M \\to M$\ndefined for any given element in M by taking succesively the the (1+t) power\nwith respect to free additive convolution and then the 1/(1+t) power with\nrespect to Boolean convolution of the given element. We show that the family of\nmaps {\\mathbb B_t|t\\geq 0} is a semigroup with respect to the operation of\ncomposition and that, quite surprisingly, every $\\mathbb B_t$ is a homomorphism\nfor the operation of free multiplicative convolution.\n  We prove that for t=1 the transformation $\\mathbb B_1$ coincides with the\ncanonical bijection $\\mathbb B : M \\to M_{inf-div}$ discovered by Bercovici and\nPata in their study of the relations between infinite divisibility in free and\nin Boolean probability. Here M_{inf-div} stands for the set of probability\ndistributions in M which are infinitely divisible with respect to free additive\nconvolution. As a consequence, we have that $\\mathbb B_t(\\mu)$ is infinitely\ndivisible with respect to free additive convolution for any for every $\\mu$ in\nM and every t greater than or equal to one.\n  On the other hand we put into evidence a relation between the transformations\n$\\mathbb B_t$ and the free Brownian motion; indeed, Theorem 4 of the paper\ngives an interpretation of the transformations $\\mathbb B_t$ as a way of\nre-casting the free Brownian motion, where the resulting process becomes\nmultiplicative with respect to free multiplicative convolution, and always\nreaches infinite divisibility with respect to free additive convolution by the\ntime t=1.\n","Comment: 30 pages, minor changes; to appear in Indiana University Mathematics\n  Journal"]}]
