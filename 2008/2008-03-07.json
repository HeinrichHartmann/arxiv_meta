Unlike previous works, which considered\nthermodynamic quantities averaged over many different inhomogeneous sequences,\nwe focused on precise sequences and investigated the succession of local\nopenings that lead to their dissociation. For this purpose, we performed\nTransfer Integral type calculations with two different dynamical models, namely\nthe heterogeneous Dauxois-Peyrard-Bishop model and the model based on finite\nstacking enthalpies we recently proposed. It appears that, for both models, the\nessential effect of heterogeneity is to let different portions of the\ninvestigated sequences open at slightly different temperatures. Besides this\nmacroscopic effect, the local aperture of each portion indeed turns out to be\nvery similar to that of a homogeneous sequence with the same length. Rounding\nof each local opening transition is therefore merely a size effect. For the\nDauxois-Peyrard-Bishop model, sequences with a few thousands base pairs are\nstill far from the thermodynamic limit, so that it is inappropriate, for this\nmodel, to discuss the order of the transition associated with each local\nopening. In contrast, sequences with several hundreds to a few thousands base\npairs are pretty close to the thermodynamic limit for the model we proposed.\nThe temperature interval where power laws holds is consequently broad enough to\nenable the estimation of critical exponents.

In many plasmas, long-lived metastable atomic levels are depopulated\nby collisions (quenched) before they decay radiatively. In low-density regions,\nhowever, the low collision rate may allow depopulation by electric dipole (E1)\nforbidden radiative transitions, so-called forbidden lines (mainly M1 and E2\ntransitions). If the atomic transition data are known, these lines are\nindicators of physical plasma conditions and used for abundance determination.\nAims. Transition rates can be derived by combining relative intensities between\nthe decay channels, so-called branching fractions (BFs), and the radiative\nlifetime of the common upper level. We use this approach for forbidden [Sc ii]\nlines, along with new calculations. Methods. Neither BFs for forbidden lines,\nnor lifetimes of metastable levels, are easily measured in a laboratory.\nTherefore, astrophysical BFs measured in Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph\n(STIS) spectra of the strontium filament of Eta Carinae are combined with\nlifetime measurements using a laser probing technique on a stored ion-beam\n(CRYRING facility,MSL, Stockholm). These quantities are used to derive the\nabsolute transition rates (A-values). New theoretical transition rates and\nlifetimes are calulated using the CIV3 code. Results. We report experimental\nlifetimes of the Sc ii levels 3d2 a3P0,1,2 with lifetimes 1.28, 1.42, and 1.24\ns, respectively, and transition rates for lines from these levels down to 3d4s\na3D in the region 8270-8390 A. These are the most important forbidden [Sc ii]\ntransitions. New calculations for lines and metastable lifetimes are also\npresented, and are in good agreement with the experimental data.\n","Comment: 5 pages. Accepted for A&A"]}]
