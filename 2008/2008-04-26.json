Using the\nmaximum entropy method we obtained the underlying distribution of pilots by\ntheir skill. We find that the variance of this skill distribution is not very\nlarge, and that the top aces achieved their victory scores mostly by luck. For\nexample, the ace of aces, Manfred von Richthofen, most likely had a skill in\nthe top quarter of the active WWI German fighter pilots and was no more special\nthan that. When combined with our recent study (cond-mat/0310049), showing that\nfame grows exponentially with victory scores, these results (derived from real\ndata) show that both outstanding achievement records and resulting fame are\nmostly due to chance.\n"]}]

In this paper, we present\ngeneral bounds for the sample complexity of the identification and decision\nversions of the hidden subgroup problem. As a consequence of the bounds, we\nshow that the sample complexity for both of the decision and identification\nversions is $\\Theta(\\log|\\HH|/\\log p)$ for a candidate set $\\HH$ of hidden\nsubgroups in the case that the candidate subgroups have the same prime order\n$p$, which implies that the decision version is at least as hard as the\nidentification version in this case. In particular, it does so for the\nimportant instances such as the dihedral and the symmetric hidden subgroup\nproblems. Moreover, the upper bound of the identification is attained by the\npretty good measurement. This shows that the pretty good measurement can\nidentify any hidden subgroup of an arbitrary group with at most $O(\\log|\\HH|)$\nsamples.\n","Comment: 11 pages.
