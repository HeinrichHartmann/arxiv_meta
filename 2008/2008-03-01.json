My objective is to illustrate the fundamental role of contacts\nand demons in transport and energy conversion. The discussion is kept at an\nacademic level steering clear of real world details, but the illustrative\ndevices we use are very much within the capabilities of present-day technology.\nFor example, recent experiments on thermoelectric effects in molecular\nconductors agree well with the predictions from our model. The Maxwell's demon\ndevice itself is very similar to the pentalayer spin-torque device which has\nbeen studied by a number of groups though we are not aware of any discussion of\nthe possibility of using the device as a nanoscale heat engine or as a\nrefrigerator as proposed here.
