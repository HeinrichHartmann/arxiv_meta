We first consider the scheme in the case of a trivial\nsingle-qubit code, which provides useful insights into the workings of\ncontinuous error correction and the difference between Markovian and\nnon-Markovian decoherence. We then study the model of a bit-flip code with each\nqubit coupled to an independent bath qubit and subject to continuous\ncorrection, and find its solution. We show that for sufficiently large\nerror-correction rates, the encoded state approximately follows an evolution of\nthe type of a single decohering qubit, but with an effectively decreased\ncoupling constant. The factor by which the coupling constant is decreased\nscales quadratically with the error-correction rate. This is compared to the\ncase of Markovian noise, where the decoherence rate is effectively decreased by\na factor which scales only linearly with the rate of error correction. The\nquadratic enhancement depends on the existence of a Zeno regime in the\nHamiltonian evolution which is absent in purely Markovian dynamics. We analyze\nthe range of validity of this result and identify two relevant time scales.\nFinally, we extend the result to more general codes and argue that the\nperformance of continuous error correction will exhibit the same qualitative\ncharacteristics.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 4 figures, minor typos corrected, references updated"]}]

If the initial state of the system does not\nbelong entirely to the subspace in question, the restriction of the state to\nthe otherwise correctable subsystem may not remain invariant after the\napplication of noise and error correction. It is known that in the case of\ndecoherence-free subspaces and subsystems (DFSs) the condition for perfect\nunitary evolution inside the code imposes more restrictive conditions on the\nnoise process if one allows imperfect initialization. It was believed that\nthese conditions are necessary if DFSs are to be able to protect imperfectly\nencoded states from subsequent errors. By a similar argument, general OQEC\ncodes would also require more restrictive error-correction conditions for the\ncase of imperfect initialization. In this study, we examine this requirement by\nlooking at the errors on the encoded state. In order to quantitatively analyze\nthe errors in an OQEC code, we introduce a measure of the fidelity between the\nencoded information in two states for the case of subsystem encoding. A major\npart of the paper concerns the definition of the measure and the derivation of\nits properties. In contrast to what was previously believed, we obtain that\nmore restrictive conditions are not necessary neither for DFSs nor for general\nOQEC codes. This is because the effective noise that can arise inside the code\nas a result of imperfect initialization is such that it can only increase the\nfidelity of an imperfectly encoded state with a perfectly encoded one.\n","Comment: 8 pages, no figures"]}]
