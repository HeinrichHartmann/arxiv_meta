The present paper addresses invariant random matrix\nensembles with symmetry group U(n), O(n), or USp(n), giving precise definitions\nand conditions of validity in each case. The method is illustrated at the\nexample of Wegner's n-orbital model.

This phenomenon, called glass transition, is\ncharacterized by a marked increase of viscosity, about 14 orders of magnitude,\nin a narrow temperature interval. The microscopic mechanism behind the glass\ntransition is still poorly understood. However, recently, great advances have\nbeen made in the identification of cooperative rearranging regions, or\ndynamical heterogeneities, i.e. domains of the liquid whose relaxation is\nhighly correlated. The growth of the size of these domains is now believed to\nbe the driving mechanism for the increase of the viscosity. Recently a tool to\nquantify the size of these domains has been proposed. We apply this tool to a\nwide class of materials to investigate the correlation between the size of the\nheterogeneities and their configurational entropy, i.e. the number of states\naccessible to a correlated domain. We find that the relaxation time of a given\nsystem, apart from a material dependent pre-factor, is a universal function of\nthe configurational entropy of a correlated domain. As a consequence, we find\nthat at the glass transition temperature, the size of the domains and the\nconfigurational entropy per unit volume are anti-correlated, as originally\npredicted by the Adam-Gibbs theory. Finally, we use our data to extract some\nexponents defined in the framework of the Random First Order Theory, a recent\nquantitative theory of the glass transition.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables"]}]
