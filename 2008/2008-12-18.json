We proposed to study the\ninvisible decay of the Higgs boson via the pair production of them, in which\none Higgs boson decays into bottom quarks and the other decays invisibly. Our\ndetail simulation for signals and backgrounds showed that the observation of\nsignal can reach $5\\sigma$ significance for $m_H=260$ GeV and $m_h=115$ GeV\nwith $10 fb^{-1}$integrated luminosity at the LHC.

Three\nscenarios have been suggested for their ejection; binary disruption by a MBH,\nscattering by inspiraling IMBH and scattering by stellar BHs close to MBH.\nThese scenarios involve different stellar populations in the Galactic center.\nHere we use observations of the Galactic center stellar population together\nwith dynamical and evolutionary arguments to obtain strong constraints on the\nnature and origin of HVSs. We show that the IMBH inspiral scenario requires too\nmany (O(10^3)) main sequence B stars to exist close to the MBH (<0.01 pc) at\nthe time of inspiral, where current observations show O(10) such stars.\nScattering by SBHs also require too many B stars to be observed in the GC, but\nit may contribute a small fraction of the currently observed HVSs. The binary\ndisruption scenario is still consistent with current observations. In addition\nit is shown that recently suggested signatures for HVSs origin such as\nhypervelocity binaries and slow rotating HVSs are much weaker than suggested\nand require too large statistics. In addition, we show that due to the\nconditions close to the MBH most binary star systems are not expected to\nsurvive for long in this region.

We confirm a strong\ncorrelation of aromatic emission with metallicity, with a threshold at a\nmetallicity [12+log(O/H)]~8. The large scatter in both the metallicity and\nradiation hardness dependence of this behavior implies that it is not due to a\nsingle effect, but to some combination. We show that the far-infrared color\ntemperature of the large dust grains increases towards lower metallicity,\npeaking at a metallicity of 8 before turning over. We compute dust masses and\ncompare them to HI masses from the literature to derive the gas to dust ratio,\nwhich increases by nearly 3 orders of magnitude between solar metallicity and a\nmetallicity of 8, below which it flattens out. The abrupt change in aromatic\nemission at mid-infrared wavelengths thus appears to be reflected in the\nfar-infrared properties, indicating that metallicity changes affect the\ncomposition of the full range of dust grain sizes that dominate the infrared\nemission. In addition, we find that the ratio L(8 micron)/L(TIR), important for\ncalibrating 24 micron measurements of high redshift galaxies, increases\nslightly as the metallicity decreases from ~solar to ~50% of solar, and then\ndecreases by an order of magnitude with further decreases in metallicity.\nAlthough the great majority of galaxies show similar patterns of behavior as\ndescribed above, there are three exceptions, SBS 0335-052E, Haro 11, and SHOC\n391. Their infrared SEDs are dominated energetically by the mid-IR near 24\nmicron rather than by the 60 - 200 micron region. (Abridged)\n","Comment: 34 pages, 11 figures, accepted to ApJ"]}]

One of the most significant\nis the auxiliary information (also called external knowledge, background\nknowledge, or side information) that an adversary gleans from other channels\nsuch as the web, public records, or domain knowledge. This paper explores how\none can reason about privacy in the face of rich, realistic sources of\nauxiliary information. Specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of\ncurrent anonymization schemes in preserving privacy when multiple organizations\nindependently release anonymized data about overlapping populations. 1. We\ninvestigate composition attacks, in which an adversary uses independent\nanonymized releases to breach privacy. We explain why recently proposed models\nof limited auxiliary information fail to capture composition attacks. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that even a simple instance of a composition attack can\nbreach privacy in practice, for a large class of currently proposed techniques.\nThe class includes k-anonymity and several recent variants. 2. On a more\npositive note, certain randomization-based notions of privacy (such as\ndifferential privacy) provably resist composition attacks and, in fact, the use\nof arbitrary side information. This resistance enables stand-alone design of\nanonymization schemes, without the need for explicitly keeping track of other\nreleases.

We\nfocus on the regime where the initial inter-atomic interactions dominate over\nthe kinetic energy and the disorder. At equilibrium in a trapping potential and\nfor small disorder, the condensate shows a Thomas-Fermi shape modified by the\ndisorder. When the condensate is released from the trap, a strong suppression\nof the expansion is obtained in contrast to the situation in a periodic\npotential with similar characteristics. This effect crucially depends on both\nthe momentum distribution of the expanding BEC and the strength of the\ndisorder. For strong disorder, the suppression of the expansion results from\nthe fragmentation of the core of the condensate and from classical reflections\nfrom large modulations of the disordered potential in the tails of the\ncondensate. We identify the corresponding disorder-induced trapping scenario\nfor which large atom-atom interactions and strong reflections from single\nmodulations of the disordered potential play central roles. For weak disorder,\nthe suppression of the expansion signals the onset of Anderson localization,\nwhich is due to multiple scattering from the modulations of the disordered\npotential.

For modeling, it usually comes to coupling a reactor model\n(describing the phenomena at the macroscopic scale) with a so-called grain\nmodel (simulating the behavior of a single grain or a particle). An interesting\napproach proposed by H.Y. Sohn (1978) is to use the law of additive reaction\ntimes in order to calculate, approximately but analytically, the reaction rate\nof a particle in the reactor model. Its great advantage, compared to a\nnumerical grain model, is to drastically reduce the computation time,\nparticularly in the case of complex reactor models. This is the approach we\nretained for modeling the moving bed furnace, a counter-current gas-solid\nreactor used in the nuclear fuel-making route for producing uranium\ntetrafluoride from uranium trioxide. The numerical model we developed is\n2-dimensional, steady-state and based on the finite volume method. It describes\nsolid and gas flow, convective, conductive and radiative heat transfers, and\nsix chemical reactions involved in the process. The law of additive reaction\ntimes is used to calculate analytically the rate of the three principal\ngas-solid reactions at every discrete point in the reactor.

In this paper, we propose two\nnovel types of regularization in the context of the multicategory SVM (MSVM)\nfor simultaneous classification and variable selection. The MSVM generally\nrequires estimation of multiple discriminating functions and applies the argmax\nrule for prediction. For each individual variable, we propose to characterize\nits importance by the supnorm of its coefficient vector associated with\ndifferent functions, and then minimize the MSVM hinge loss function subject to\na penalty on the sum of supnorms. To further improve the supnorm penalty, we\npropose the adaptive regularization, which allows different weights imposed on\ndifferent variables according to their relative importance. Both types of\nregularization automate variable selection in the process of building\nclassifiers, and lead to sparse multi-classifiers with enhanced\ninterpretability and improved accuracy, especially for high dimensional low\nsample size data. One big advantage of the supnorm penalty is its easy\nimplementation via standard linear programming.

Most proposed solutions use variants of flooding or\nblind searching when a void is encountered. In this paper, we propose a\nspanning-path virtual coordinate system which can be used as a complete routing\nalgorithm or as the complementary algorithm to greedy forwarding that is\ninvoked when voids are encountered. With this approach, and for the first time,\nwe demonstrate a stateless and delivery guaranteed geometric routing algorithm\non VCS. When used in conjunction with our previously proposed aligned virtual\ncoordinate system (AVCS), it out-performs not only all geometric routing\nprotocols on VCS, but also geographic routing with accurate location\ninformation.\n"]}]

It is riddled with both misconceptions and\nerrors of fact. Purporting to cast doubt on the NAA (neutron activation\nanalysis) work conducted by Dr. Vincent Guinn in the investigation of the\nassassination of President John F. Kennedy, it fails miserably.

The authors opine; ``If the assassination fragments are\nderived from three or more separate bullets, then a second assassin is likely,\nas the additional bullet would not be attributable to the main suspect, Mr.\nOswald.'' This statement relating to the likelihood of a second assassin based\non the premise of three or more separate bullets is demonstrably false.

In addition, we have received letters, emails and telephone\ncalls. One of our favorites was a voicemail message asking us to return a call\nto Australia at which point we would learn who really killed JFK. We welcome\nthe opportunity to respond to the letter to the editor from Mr. Fiorentino. Mr.\nFiorentino claims that our ``statement relating to the likelihood of a second\nassassin based on the premise of three or more separate bullets is demonstrably\nfalse.'' In response we would like to simply quote from page 327 of Gerald\nPosner's book Case Closed, one of the most well known works supporting the\nsingle assassin theory: ``If Connally was hit by another bullet, it had to be\nfired from a second shooter, since the Warren Commission's own reconstructions\nshowed that Oswald could not have operated the bolt and refired in 1.4\nseconds.'' Mr. Fiorentino also claims that the ``second fatal flaw is the use\nof a rather uncomplicated formula based on Bayes Theorem.'' Let $E$ denote the\nevidence and $T$ denote the theory that there were just two bullets (and hence\na single shooter). We used Bayes Theorem to hypothetically calculate $P(T|E)$\nfrom $P(E|T)$ and the prior probability $P(T)$. In order to make $P(T|E)$ ten\ntimes more likely than $P(\\bar{T}|E)$, the ratio of the prior probabilities\n[i.e., $P(T) / P(\\bar{T})$] would have to be greater than 15. Thus, we again\nconclude that this casts serious doubt on Dr. Guinn's conclusion that the\nevidence supported just two bullets. Sadly, this is far from the first time\nthat probability has been misunderstood and/or misapplied in a case of public\ninterest. A notable British example is the Clark case.

A difficulty arises because matrices associated with\ntrend filters are finite approximations of Toeplitz operators and therefore\nvery little is known about their eigenstructure, which also depends on the\nboundary conditions or, equivalently, on the filters for trend estimation at\nthe end of the sample. Assuming reflecting boundary conditions, we derive a\ntime series decomposition in terms of periodic latent components and\ncorresponding smoothing eigenvalues.

The latter implies disappearance of the volume element\n$\\sqrt{-g}d^4x$ of 4-D space-time. We pay attention that besides $\\sqrt{-g}$,\nthe 4-D space-time differentiable manifold possesses also a \"manifold volume\nmeasure\" (MVM)described by a 4-form which is sign indefinite and generically\nindependent of the metric. The FOF proceeds with originally independent\nconnection and metric structures of the space-time manifold. We bring up the\nquestion whether the FOF should be supplemented with degrees of freedom of MVM.\nAdding such manifold degrees of freedom to the action principle in the FOF we\nrealize very interesting dynamics. Such Two Measures Theory enables radically\nnew approaches to resolution of the cosmological constant problem. We show that\nfine tuning free solutions describing a transition to $\\Lambda =0$ state\ninvolve oscillations of $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ and MVM around zero.

Sign indefiniteness of MVM in a natural way yields a dynamical\nrealization of a phantom cosmology ($w<-1$).

The global SED of M101 shows strong aromatic feature (commonly\ncalled PAH feature) emission. The spatially resolved spectral and photometric\nmeasurements of the aromatic feature emission show strong variations with\nsignificantly weaker emission at larger radii. We compare these variations with\nchanges in the ionization index (as measured by [NeIII]/[NeII] and [SIV/SIII],\nwhich we probe over the ranges 0.03-20 and 0.044-15 respectively) and\nmetallicity (expressed as log(O/H)+12, which ranges from 8.1 to 8.8). Over\nthese ranges, the spectroscopic equivalent widths of the aromatic features from\n7 HII regions and the nucleus were found to correlate better with ionization\nindex than with metallicity. This implies that the weakening of the aromatic\nemission in massive star forming regions is due primarily to processing of the\ndust grains in these environments, not to differences in how they form\n(although formation could still be important on a secondary basis). The\nbehavior of the correlation between the aromatic feature equivalent widths and\nionization index can be described as a constant equivalent width until a\nthreshold in ionization index is reached ([NeIII]/[NeII] ~ 1), above which the\nequivalent widths decrease with a power law dependence. This behavior for M101\nHII regions is also seen for the sample of starburst galaxies presented in the\ncompanion study of Engelbracht et al. (2008) which expands the range of\n[NeIII]/[NeII] ratios to 0.03-25 and log(O/H)+12 values to 7.1-8.8.

Micro features with line-width as small as several\nmicrometers were formed on the ceramic green substrates. The dynamic\nthermo-mechanical analysis indicated that extending the holding time at certain\ntemperature range would harden the green substrates with little effect on\nimproving the embossing fidelity. Ceramic substrates with embossed micro\npatterns were obtain d after co-firing. The embedded micro channels were also\nobtained by laminating the green tapes on the embossed substrates.\n","Comment: Submitted on behalf of EDA Publishing Association\n  (http://irevues.inist.fr/handle/2042/16838)"]}]

To define and quantify `chance success' is\nknotty. Some null hypotheses ascribe chance to the Earth: Seismicity is modeled\nas random. The null distribution of the number of successful predictions -- or\nany other test statistic -- is taken to be its distribution when the fixed set\nof predictions is applied to random seismicity. Such tests tacitly assume that\nthe predictions do not depend on the observed seismicity. Conditioning on the\npredictions in this way sets a low hurdle for statistical significance.\nConsider this scheme: When an earthquake of magnitude 5.5 or greater occurs\nanywhere in the world, predict that an earthquake at least as large will occur\nwithin 21 days and within an epicentral distance of 50 km. We apply this rule\nto the Harvard centroid-moment-tensor (CMT) catalog for 2000--2004 to generate\na set of predictions. The null hypothesis is that earthquake times are\nexchangeable conditional on their magnitudes and locations and on the\npredictions--a common ``nonparametric'' assumption in the literature. We\ngenerate random seismicity by permuting the times of events in the CMT catalog.\nWe consider an event successfully predicted only if (i) it is predicted and\n(ii) there is no larger event within 50 km in the previous 21 days. The\n$P$-value for the observed success rate is $<0.001$: The method successfully\npredicts about 5% of earthquakes, far better than `chance,' because the\npredictor exploits the clustering of earthquakes -- occasional foreshocks --\nwhich the null hypothesis lacks. Rather than condition on the predictions and\nuse a stochastic model for seismicity, it is preferable to treat the observed\nseismicity as fixed, and to compare the success rate of the predictions to the\nsuccess rate of simple-minded predictions like those just described.

Despite\ncorrelative relations between noise level and awakenings, the scientific\ncommunity has not reached consensus regarding a specific action of these\nfactors on the different sleep stages. In animal research, 2 complementary main\nfields of research exist. One is focused on the positive modulation of sleep by\nrepeated tone stimulation. The other concerns noise-related sleep disturbances.\nThe few studies that have investigated noise-related sleep disturbances suggest\nthe following conclusions. First, sleep disturbances are greater upon exposure\nto environmental noise, whose frequency spectrum is characterized by high and\nultrasonic sounds, than white noise. Second, unpredictability and pattern of\nnoise events are responsible for extractions from both SWS and PS. Third,\nchronic exposure to noise permanently reduces and fragments sleep. Finally, in\nchronic noise exposure, an inter-individual variability in SWS deficits is\nobserved and correlated to a psychobiological profile related to an\nincapability to face stressful situations. Based on results from other\nresearch, acute noise-related sleep perturbations could result from an\nimbalance in the sleep-wake cycle in favor of arousing ascending systems.\nChronic noise-related sleep disturbances may arise due to imbalance of the\nsleep-wake cycle and malfunctioning of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis\nwhich may both contribute to the development of pathology.\n"]}]

The sampling\nin sensors is conventionally time triggered with fixed periods. In this\ncontext, only worse-than-possible quality of control (QoC) can be achieved when\nthe network is underloaded, while overloaded conditions may significantly\ndegrade the QoC, even causing system instability. This is particularly true\nwhen the bandwidth of the wireless network is limited and shared by multiple\ncontrol loops. To address these problems, a flexible time-triggered sampling\nscheme is presented in this work. Smart sensors are used to facilitate dynamic\nadjustment of sampling periods, which enhances the flexibility and resource\nefficiency of the system based on time-triggered sampling. Feedback control\ntechnology is exploited for adapting sampling periods in a periodic manner. The\ndeadline miss ratio in each control loop is maintained at/around a desired\nlevel, regardless of workload variations.

The\nintrinsic luminosity of the X-ray source determined from the modeling and the\nmeasured flux (F_X = 4.1x10^-13 ergs cm-2 s-1) is L_X~8.6x10^32 erg\ns-1(assuming D = 1.2kpc). These gratings spectroscopy results are generally\nconsistent with earlier results obtained from X-ray CCD imaging spectroscopy of\nBD+30 3639, but are far more precise. The tight constraints placed on the\n(nonsolar) abundances directly implicate the present-day central star -- hence,\nultimately, the intershell region of the progenitor asymptotic giant branch\nstar -- as the origin of the shocked plasma now emitting in X-rays.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ (29 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables,\n  Abstract abridged)"]}]

We consider the possibility that the source\nof NP contributions to FCNC processes share the same flavor symmetry underlying\nthe SM source of FCNC processes which are the quark and lepton mass matrices.\nWe call this the principle of shared flavor symmetry. In the flavor symmetric\nlimit, the quark and lepton mixing matrices have fixed forms and there are no\nNP FCNC processes. In the flavor symmetric limit, we take the quark mixing\nmatrix to be the identity matrix and the lepton mixing matrix to be given by\ntri-bimaximal mixing.

New contributions to FCNC processes arise\nbecause of non universal breaking of the flavor symmetry in the quark and\nlepton mass matrices and the NP sources of FCNC processes. In particular, we\nwill focus on new FCNC effects that arise due to the breaking of flavor\nsymmetry only in the quark and charged lepton mass matrices but not in the NP\nsector.

The model in\nits infinite-size limit exhibits shape-phase transitions between spherical,\ndeformed prolate, and deformed oblate forms of the ground state.

Simultaneously, the model\nserves as a theoretical laboratory for studying diverse general features of\nQPTs in interacting many-body systems, which differ in many respects from\nlattice models of solid-state physics. We outline the most important fields of\nthe present interest: (a) The coexistence of first- and second-order phase\ntransitions supports studies related to the microscopic origin of the QPT\nphenomena. (b) The competing quantum phases are characterized by specific\ndynamical symmetries and novel symmetry related approaches are developed to\ndescribe also the transitional dynamical domains. (c) In some parameter\nregions, the QPT-like behavior can be ascribed also to individual excited\nstates, which is linked to the thermodynamic and classical descriptions of the\nsystem. (d) The model and its phase structure can be extended in many\ndirections: by separating proton and neutron excitations, considering\nodd-fermion degrees of freedom or different particle-hole configurations, by\nincluding other types of bosons, higher order interactions, and by imposing\nexternal rotation. All these aspects of IBM phase transitions are relevant in\nthe interpretation of experimental data and important for a fundamental\nunderstanding of the QPT phenomenon.\n","Comment: a review article, 71 pages, 18 figures"]}]

It is assumed that a test particle experiences a\nsimilar parametric resonance mechanism such as the one described in paper I and\nII but now the resonance is induced by the interaction between a spiral density\nwave in the accretion disk, excited close to the innermost stable circular\norbit, and vertical epicyclic oscillations.

This appears to remove any possibility of a meaningful unification\nprediction and is often viewed as a strong argument against direct mediation.\nWe propose two ways that Seiberg duality can circumvent this problem. In the\nfirst, which we call \"deflected-unification\", the SUSY-breaking hidden sector\nis a magnetic theory which undergoes a duality to an electric phase, with fewer\nelementary degrees of freedom coupled to the MSSM. This changes the\nbeta-functions of the MSSM gauge couplings so as to push their Landau poles\nabove the unification scale. We show that this scenario is realised for\nrecently suggested models of gauge mediation based on a metastable SCQD-type\nhidden sector directly coupled to MSSM. The second possibility, which we call\n\"dual-unification\", begins with the observation that, if the mediating fields\nfall into complete SU(5) multiplets, then the MSSM+messengers exhibits a fake\nunification at unphysical values of the gauge couplings. We show that, in known\nexamples of electric/magnetic duals, such a fake unification in the magnetic\ntheory reflects a real unification in the electric theory. We therefore propose\nthat the Standard Model could itself be a magnetic dual of some unknown\nelectric theory in which the true unification takes place. This scenario\nmaintains the unification prediction (and unification scale) even in the\npresence of Landau poles in the magnetic theory below the GUT scale.

Similarly, for\nM-theory, we relate semi-simple Lie superalgebras H with 16 fermionic\ngenerators which are subalgebras of OSp(8^*|4) or OSp(8|4,R) to families of\nhalf-BPS solutions which are invariant under H, and locally asymptotic to AdS_7\nx S^4 or AdS_4 x S^7 respectively.

The primary energy release in solar flares is almost certainly due\nto magnetic reconnection, making this a strong candidate as a mechanism for\nparticle acceleration. While particle acceleration in 2D geometries has been\nwidely studied, investigations in 3D are a recent development. Two main classes\nof reconnection regimes at a 3D magnetic null point have been identified: fan\nand spine reconnection Aims. Here we investigate particle trajectories and\nacceleration during reconnection at a 3D null point, using a test particle\nnumerical code, and compare the efficiency of the fan and spine regimes in\ngenerating an energetic particle population. Methods. We calculated the time\nevolution of the energy spectra. We discuss the geometry of particle escape\nfrom the two configurations and characterise the trapped and escaped\npopulations. Results. We find that fan reconnection is less efficent than spine\nreconnection in providing seed particles to the region of strong electric field\nwhere acceleration is possible. The establishment of a steady-state spectrum\nrequires approximately double the time in fan reconnection. The steady-state\nenergy spectrum at intermediate energies (protons 1 keV to 0.1 MeV) is\ncomparable in the fan and spine regimes. While in spine reconnection particle\nescape takes place in two symmetric jets along the spine, in fan reconnection\nno jets are produced and particles escape in the fan plane, in a ribbon-like\nstructure.\n"]}]

Usual method to measure this decay rate is through\nthe integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect-large scale structure (LSS) cross\ncorrelation. However, the interpretation of the measured correlation signal is\ncomplicated by the galaxy bias and matter power spectrum. This could bias\nand/or degrade its constraints to the nature of dark energy and gravity.

Much of the progress in understanding the physics of\ngalaxy formation and comparison with observations would not have been possible\nwithout N-Body simulations. Given the importance of this tool, it is essential\nto understand its limitations as ignoring these can easily lead to interesting\nbut unreliable results.

We explicitly construct the correction\nterm arising due to a finite box size and study its generic features for\nclustering of matter and also on mass functions. We show that the correction to\nmass function is maximum near the scale of non-linearity, as a corollary we\nshow that the correction to the number density of haloes of a given mass\nchanges sign at this scale; the number of haloes at small masses is over\nestimated in simulations. This over estimate results from a delay in mergers\nthat lead to formation of more massive haloes. The same technique can be used\nto study corrections to other physical quantities. The corrections are\ntypically small if the scale of non-linearity is much smaller than the\nbox-size. However, there are some cases of physical interest in which the\nrelative correction term is of order unity even though a simulation box much\nlarger than the scale of non-linearity is used. Within the context of the\nconcordance model, our analysis suggests that it is very difficult for present\nday simulations to resolve mass scales smaller than 100 solar masses accurately\nand the level of difficulty increases as we go to even smaller masses, though\nthis constraint does not apply to multi-scale simulations.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 6 figure, MNRAS format.

Previous studies for simple initial configurations with two\nequal-mass planets revealed some discrepancies between the results of numerical\nsimulations and the observed orbital elements of extrasolar planets. Here, we\nshow that simulations with two unequal mass planets starting on nearly circular\norbits predict a reduced frequency of collisions and a broader range of final\neccentricities. The two-planet scattering model can easily reproduce the\nobserved eccentricities with a plausible distribution of planet mass ratios.\nFurther, the two-planet scattering model predicts a maximum eccentricity of\nabout 0.8, independent of the distribution of planet mass ratios, provided that\nboth planets are initially place on nearly circular orbits. This compares\nfavorably with current observations and will be tested by future planet\ndiscoveries.

Orbital migration due to planet scattering could play\nan important role in explaining the increased rate of giant planets with very\nshort period orbits.

We also find that the duration-energy\nrelationship for bursts previously observed above 25keV (Fenimore et al. 1995)\nextends down to 1.5 keV. This result suggests that the same radiation mechanism\nis operating from X-rays to gamma-rays and is in agreement with radiative\ncooling by synchotron emission. A fast evolution of the spectrum is found, in\nwhich the ratio of X- to gamma-ray intensities varies over three orders of\nmagnitude.

This is due to the possible mixing between brane and bulk components of\nthe Higgs boson, that is, the non-trivial brane-bulk `location' of the lightest\nHiggs. To parametrize this mixing, we consider two Higgs doublets, one confined\nto the usual space dimensions and the other propagating in the bulk.\nCalculating the production and decay rates for the lightest Higgs boson, we\nfind that compared to the standard model (SM), the cross section receives a\nsuppression well below but an enhancement close to and above the\ncompactification scale M_c.

In this paper, we investigate the production and decay of\nthese particles at the high energy e^+ e^- experiments, LEP II and NLC. We find\nthat, in WTC models, the production of neutral PGBs can be significantly\nenhanced, by one or two orders of magnitude, with respect to the predictions of\ntraditional (QCD-like) TC models. The origin of such an enhancement is the\nexistence of several low energy TC scales, that are likely to appear in WTC\ntheories. This could allow the PGBs to be observed even at the energy and\nluminosity of the LEP II experiment. At LEP II, the PGBs are expected to be\nproduced in the e^+ e^- ==> P \\gamma channel, and, possibly, in the e^+ e^- ==>\nP e^+ e^- channel, with a total rate that can be of the order of several tenths\nper year. Due to the typical large values of PGB masses, the relative branching\nratios of PGB decays, in WTC theories, are different from those predicted in\ntraditional TC models. In particular, a large fraction of these decays can\noccur in the P ==> \\gamma \\gamma channel. In considering the PGB production, at\nLEP II, we find that, in most of the final states, the distinctive signatures\nof WTC events should allow the Standard Model background to be reduced to a\nnegligible level. We also find that, at a 500 GeV NLC experiment, the\nproduction of neutral PGBs can occur in several channels, and can be of the\norder of 10^3 events per year. Instead, when we consider traditional TC models,\nwe find that no PGB are typically predicted to be observed, both at LEP II and\nthe NLC experiment.\n","Comment: 36 pages LaTeX + 10 uuencoded figures.

The\nfluid's long-distance behavior is studied using renormalization-group (RG)\nmethods, as begun by Forster, Nelson, and Stephen [Phys. Rev. A 16, 732\n(1977)]. With friction, which dissipates energy at low wavenumbers, one expects\na stationary inverse energy cascade for strong enough stirring. While such\ndeveloped turbulence is beyond the quantitative reach of perturbation theory, a\ncombination of exact and perturbative results suggests a coherent picture of\nthe inverse cascade. The zero-friction fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) is\nderived from a generalized time-reversal symmetry and implies zero anomalous\ndimension for the velocity even when friction is present. Thus the Kolmogorov\nscaling of the inverse cascade cannot be explained by any RG fixed point. The\nbeta function for the dimensionless coupling ghat is computed through two\nloops; the ghat^3 term is positive, as already known, but the ghat^5 term is\nnegative. An ideal cascade requires a linear beta function for large ghat,\nconsistent with a Pad\\'e approximant to the Borel transform. The conjecture\nthat the Kolmogorov spectrum arises from an RG flow through large ghat is\ncompatible with other results, but the accurate k^{-5/3} scaling is not\nexplained and the Kolmogorov constant is not estimated. The lack of scale\ninvariance should produce intermittency in high-order structure functions, as\nobserved in some but not all numerical simulations of the inverse cascade.

In the latter case the pattern was of the same color as\nthe laser light (the Schwarz-Hora effect). This effect was discussed\nextensively in the early 1970s.

Issues such as\nuniversality, complexity and scalability are addressed and several steps are\ntaken towards the physical implementation of this model.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 3 figures, REVTEX"]}]
