Polycrystalline samples URh$_{1-x}$Ru$_x$Ge ($x \\leq $0.6),\nURh$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Ge ($x \\leq $0.9) and URhGe$_{1-x}$Si$_x$ ($x \\leq $0.2) have\nbeen prepared and the magnetic properties have been investigated by\nmagnetization and transport experiments. In the case of Ru doping, $T_{\\rm C}$\ninitially increases, but then decreases linearly as a function of $x$ and is\ncompletely suppressed for $x_{\\rm cr} \\approx 0.38$. The Curie temperature in\nthe URh$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Ge series has a broad maximum $T_{\\rm C} = 20$ K near\n$x=0.6$ and then drops to 8 K for $x=0.9$. In the case of Si doping $T_{\\rm C}$\nstays roughly constant. We conclude that the alloy systems URh$_{1-x}$Ru$_x$Ge\nand URh$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Ge are interesting candidates to study the ferromagnetic\ninstability.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 12 figures; revised & shortened version"]}]

The\nadjacency graph of a $t$-fold MDS code is not connected if and only if the\ncharacteristic function of the code is the repetition-free sum of the\ncharacteristic functions of $t$-fold MDS codes of smaller lengths.\n  In the case $t=2$, the theory has the following application. The union of two\ndisjoint $(n,4^{n-1},2)$ MDS codes in $\\{0,1,2,3\\}^n$ is a double-MDS-code. If\nthe adjacency graph of the double-MDS-code is not connected, then the\ndouble-code can be decomposed into double-MDS-codes of smaller lengths.
