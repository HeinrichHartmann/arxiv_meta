In particular, these stellar clusters (SCs)\npresent combinations of age and metallicity that are not found for this class\nof objects in the Milky Way, being therefore very useful templates to test and\nto calibrate integrated light simple stellar population (SSP) models applied to\nunresolved distance galaxies. On its turn, the age and metallicity for a\ncluster can be determined spatially resolving its stars, by means of analysis\nof its colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). In this work we present our method to\ndetermine self-consistent physical parameters (age, metallicity, distance\nmodulus and reddening) for a stellar cluster, from CMDs modelling of relatively\nunstudied SCs in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) imaged in the BVI filters\nwith the 4.1 m SOAR telescope.
