Then the\ndimension formula and basis function construction of bilinear spline spaces of\nsmoothness order zero over T-meshes are discussed in detail, and a dimension\nlower bound of biquadratic spline spaces over general T-meshes is provided.\nFurthermore, using level structure of hierarchical T-meshes, a dimension\nformula of biquadratic spline space over hierarchical T-meshes are proved.

These phenomena shall be described\nand exemplified by computer simulations of the Asakura-Oosawa model for\ncolloid-polymer mixtures, but applications to other soft matter systems (e.g.\nconfined polymer blends) will also be mentioned. Typically a wall will prefer\none of the phases, and hence the composition of the system in the direction\nperpendicular to the walls will not be homogeneous. If both walls are of the\nsame kind, this effect leads to a distortion of the phase diagram of the system\nin thin film geometry, in comparison with the bulk, analogous to the phenomenon\nof \"capillary condensation\" of simple fluids in thin capillaries. In the case\nof \"competing walls\", where both walls prefer different phases of the two\nphases coexisting in the bulk, a state with an interface parallel to the walls\ngets stabilized. The transition from the disordered phase to this \"soft mode\nphase\" is rounded by the finite thickness of the film and not a sharp phase\ntransition. However, a sharp transition can occur where this interface gets\nlocalized at (one of) the walls. The relation of this interface localization\ntransition to wetting phenomena is discussed. Finally, an outlook to related\nphenomena is given, such as the effects of confinement in cylindrical pores on\nthe phase behavior, and more complicated ordering phenomena (lamellar\nmesophases of block copolymers or nematic phases of liquid crystals under\nconfinement).\n","Comment: 25 pages, 17 figures, to be published in Soft Matter"]}]
