We show that under a suitable pinching\ncondition, the hypersurface is diffeomorpic and almost isometric to a standard\nsphere. Moreover, as a corollary, we show that a hypersurface of the Euclidean\nspace which is almost Einstein is diffeomorpic and almost isometric to a\nstandard sphere.\n","Comment: 18 pages"]}]

Mathematically,\ninput continuity helps to show how a large network, constructed recursively\nfrom smaller blocks, can exhibit robust specific properties according to its\ninput. By extending earlier work on synchrony and symmetry, we exploit input\ncontinuity of contracting systems to ensure robust control of diverse spatial\nand spatio-temporal symmetries of the output signal in such a network.\n","Comment: Last editorial changes, long version of the paper"]}]
