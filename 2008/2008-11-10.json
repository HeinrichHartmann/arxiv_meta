Methods: We consider\ncases where the magnetic Reynolds number is either marginal or moderately\nsupercritical with respect to small-scale dynamo action in the absence of shear\nand rotation. The effects of magnetic helicity fluxes are studied by comparing\nresults for the magnetic field with open and closed boundaries. Results:\nWithout shear no large-scale dynamos are found even if the ingredients\nnecessary for the alpha-effect (rotation and stratification) are present in the\nsystem. When uniform horizontal shear is added, a large-scale magnetic field\ndevelops, provided the boundaries are open. In this case the mean magnetic\nfield contains a significant fraction of the total field. For those runs where\nthe magnetic Reynolds number is between 60 and 250, small-scale dynamo is\nexpected to be excited, but the field distribution is found to be similar to\ncases with smaller magnetic Reynolds number where the small-scale dynamo is not\nexcited. In the case of closed (perfectly conducting) boundaries, magnetic\nhelicity fluxes are suppressed and no large-scale fields are found. Similarly,\npoor large-scale field development is seen when vertical shear is used in\ncombination with periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal directions. If,\nhowever, open (normal-field) boundary conditions are used in the x-direction, a\nlarge-scale field develops.

It is motivated by our theory of deformed\nW-algebras. We show that the q-characters give rise to a homomorphism from the\nGrothendieck ring of representations of a quantum affine algebra to a\npolynomial ring. We conjecture that the image of this homomorphism is equal to\nthe intersection of certain \"screening operators\". We also discuss the\nconnection between q-characters and Bethe Ansatz.\n","Comment: 47 pages, Latex2e"]}]
