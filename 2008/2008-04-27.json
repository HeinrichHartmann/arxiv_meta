The\neigenfunctions are constructed from the wave functions of non-interacting\nspinless fermions, based on Girardeau's Fermi-Bose mapping, and from the wave\nfunctions of distinguishable spins. We show that the spinor bosons behave like\na compound of non-interacting spinless fermions and non-interacting\ndistinguishable spins. This duality is especially reflected in the spin\ndensities and the energy spectrum. We find that the momentum distribution of\nthe eigenstates depends on the symmetry of the spin function.

In a recent publication [Eur. Phys. J. E 19, 461 (2006)] we have shown\nthat for an inextensible freely jointed ring this divergence turns into a\nsecond-order transition from a crumpled state, where the mean area scales as\n$<A> \\sim N$, to a smooth state with $<A> \\sim N^2$. In the current work we\nextend these two models to the case where the swelling of the ring is caused by\ntrapped ideal-gas particles. The Gaussian model is solved exactly, and the\nfreely jointed one is treated using a Flory argument, mean-field theory, and\nMonte Carlo simulations. For fixed number $Q$ of trapped particles the\ncriticality disappears in both models through an unusual mechanism, arising\nfrom the absence of an area constraint. In the Gaussian case the ring swells to\nsuch a mean area, $<A> \\sim NQ$, that the pressure exerted by the particles is\nat $p_c$ for any $Q$. In the freely jointed model the mean area is such that\nthe particle pressure is always higher than $p_c$, and $<A>$ consequently\nfollows a single scaling law, $<A> \\sim N^2 f(Q/N)$, for any $Q$. By contrast,\nwhen the particles are in contact with a reservoir of fixed chemical potential,\nthe criticality is retained. Thus, the two ensembles are manifestly\ninequivalent in these systems.\n","Comment: 8 pages"]}]
