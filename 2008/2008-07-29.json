In some notable cases, typical\nlensing analyses assuming isothermal galaxy density profiles produce low values\nfor the Hubble constant, inconsistent with the result of the HST Key Project\n(72 +- 8 km/s/Mpc). Possible systematics in the values of the Hubble constant\nderived from galaxy lensing systems can result from a number of factors, e.g.\nneglect of environmental effects, assumption of isothermality, or contamination\nby line-of-sight structures. One additional potentially important factor is the\ntriaxial structure of the lensing galaxy halo; most lens models account for\nhalo shape simply by perturbing the projected spherical lensing potential, an\napproximation that is often necessary but that is inadequate at the levels of\ntriaxiality predicted in the CDM paradigm. To quantify the potential error\nintroduced by this assumption in estimates of the Hubble parameter, we strongly\nlens a distant galaxy through a sample of triaxial softened isothermal halos\nand use an MCMC method to constrain the lensing halo profile and the Hubble\nparameter from the resulting multiple image systems. We explore the major\ndegeneracies between the Hubble parameter and several parameters of the lensing\nmodel, finding that without a way to accurately break these degeneracies\naccurate estimates of the Hubble parameter are not possible. Crucially, we find\nthat triaxiality does not significantly bias estimates of the Hubble constant,\nand offer an analytic explanation for this behaviour in the case of isothermal\nprofiles.

Based on these results, we define\na new class of perfect graphs, which we call co-linear graphs, and study their\ncomplement graphs, namely linear graphs. The linear coloring of a graph $G$ is\na vertex coloring such that two vertices can be assigned the same color, if\ntheir corresponding clique sets are associated by the set inclusion relation (a\nclique set of a vertex $u$ is the set of all maximal cliques containing $u$);\nthe linear chromatic number $\\mathcal{\\lambda}(G)$ of $G$ is the least integer\n$k$ for which $G$ admits a linear coloring with $k$ colors.

To generate such formulas -- randomly permute all 2^k\\binom{n}{k}\npossible clauses over the variables x_1, ..., x_n, and starting from the empty\nformula, go over the clauses one by one, including each new clause as you go\nalong if after its addition the formula remains satisfiable. We study the\nevolution of this process, namely the distribution over formulas obtained after\nscanning through the first m clauses (in the random permutation's order).\n  Random processes with conditioning on a certain property being respected are\nwidely studied in the context of graph properties. This study was pioneered by\nRuci\\'nski and Wormald in 1992 for graphs with a fixed degree sequence, and\nalso by Erd\\H{o}s, Suen, and Winkler in 1995 for triangle-free and bipartite\ngraphs.

For m \\geq cn, c=c(k) a sufficiently\nlarge constant, we are able to characterize the structure of the solution space\nof a typical formula in this distribution.

Several of these regularities will be discussed.\nIt will be shown that in all of the three limiting symmetries of the IBA [U(5),\nSU(3), and O(6)], energies of 0+ states grow linearly with their ordinal\nnumber. Furthermore, it will be proved that the narrow transition region\nseparating the symmetry triangle of the IBA into a spherical and a deformed\nregion is described quite well by the degeneracies E(0_2^+)=E(6_1^+), E(0_3^+)\n=E(10_1^+), E(0_4^+)=E(14_1^+), the energy ratio E(6_1^+) /E(0_2^+) turning out\nto be a simple, empirical, easy-to-measure effective order parameter,\ndistinguishing between first- and second-order transitions.

In the setup of the second spectral sequence, a complex\nisomorphic to the suspension of the cycle-free chessboard complex of Vrecica\nand Zivaljevic appears. Homology operations are defined on the symmetric\nhomology groups over Z/p, p a prime. Finally, an explicit partial resolution is\npresented, permitting the computation of the zeroth and first symmetric\nhomology groups of finite-dimensional algebras.\n","Comment: xi+155 pages.

The dynamics of the charged particle is investigated using\nclassical treatment, Fourier expansion technique, time-evolution method, and\nLewis-Riesenfeld approach. We have shown that, by properly managing the\nboundary conditions, a time-dependent wave function can be obtained using a\ngeneral non-Hermitian time-dependent invariant, which is a specific linear\ncombination of initial angular-momentum and azimuthal-angle operators. It is\nshown that the linear invariant eigenfunction can be realized as a\nGaussian-type wave packet with a peak moving along the classical angular\ntrajectory, while the distribution of the wave packet is determined by the\nratio of the coefficient of the initial angle to that of the initial canonical\nangular momentum. From the topologically nontrivial nature as well as the\nclassical trajectory and angular momentum, one can determine the dynamical\nmotion of the wave packet. It should be noted that the peak position is no\nlonger an expectation value of the angle operator, and hence the Ehrenfest\ntheorem is not directly applicable in such a topologically nontrivial system.\n","Comment: 6 pages"]}]

Determinism was challenged by quantum mechanics and chaos theory.\nSystems theory replaced reductionism by a scientifically based holism.\nCybernetics and postmodern social science showed that knowledge is\nintrinsically subjective.

Its central paradigm is the multi-agent system.\nAgents are intrinsically subjective and uncertain about their environment and\nfuture, but out of their local interactions, a global organization emerges.\nAlthough different philosophers, and in particular the postmodernists, have\nvoiced similar ideas, the paradigm of complexity still needs to be fully\nassimilated by philosophy.
