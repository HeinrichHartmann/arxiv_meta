Campisi. Stud. Hist. Phil. M. P. 36 (2005) 275-290) we\nhave addressed the mechanical foundations of equilibrium thermodynamics on the\nbasis of the Generalized Helmholtz Theorem. It was found that the volume\nentropy provides a good mechanical analogue of thermodynamic entropy because it\nsatisfies the heat theorem and it is an adiabatic invariant. This property\nexplains the ``equal'' sign in Clausius principle ($S_f \\geq S_i$) in a purely\nmechanical way and suggests that the volume entropy might explain the ``larger\nthan'' sign (i.e. the Law of Entropy Increase) if non adiabatic transformations\nwere considered. Based on the principles of microscopic (quantum or classical)\nmechanics here we prove that, provided the initial equilibrium satisfy the\nnatural condition of decreasing ordering of probabilities, the expectation\nvalue of the volume entropy cannot decrease for arbitrary transformations\nperformed by some external sources of work on a insulated system. This can be\nregarded as a rigorous quantum mechanical proof of the Second Law. We discuss\nhow this result relates to the Minimal Work Principle and improves over\nprevious attempts. The natural evolution of entropy is towards larger values\nbecause the natural state of matter is at positive temperature. Actually the\nLaw of Entropy Decrease holds in artificially prepared negative temperature\nsystems.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 1 figure"]}]

The instability is Rayleigh-Taylor, and develops\nfor a fairly broad range of accretion rates and stellar rotation rates and\nmagnetic fields. It manifests itself in the form of tall, thin tongues of\nplasma that penetrate the magnetosphere in the equatorial plane. The shape and\nnumber of the tongues changes with time on the inner-disk dynamical timescale.\nIn contrast with funnel flows, which deposit matter mainly in the polar region,\nthe tongues deposit matter much closer to the stellar equator. The instability\nappears for relatively small misalignment angles, $\\Theta\\lesssim30^\\circ$,\nbetween the star's rotation and magnetic axes, and is associated with higher\naccretion rates. The hot spots and light curves during accretion through\ninstability are generally much more chaotic than during stable accretion. The\nunstable state of accretion has possible implications for quasi-periodic\noscillations and intermittent pulsations from accreting systems, as well as\nplanet migration.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 22 figs.
