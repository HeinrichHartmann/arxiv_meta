It thus follows quickly from the observation\nin this note that this concordance group contains a subgroup isomorphic to a\nfree abelian group on three generators.\n","Comment: In the first version of this note, the main result was applied to\n  show that the smooth concordance group of topologically slice knots contains\n  a summand isomorphic to a free abelian group on two generators.
