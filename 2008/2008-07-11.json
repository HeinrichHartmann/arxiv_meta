In the absence of electrolyte and surfactant,\nparticle interactions exhibit a long-range repulsion, yet the variation of the\ninteraction for different particle pairs is found to be considerable. Averaging\nover several particle pairs was hence found to be necessary to obtain reliable\nassessment of the effects of salt and surfactant. It has previously been\nsuggested that the repulsion is consistent with electrostatic interactions\nbetween a small number of dissociated charges in the oil phase, leading to a\ndecay with distance to the power -4 and an absence of any effect of electrolyte\nconcentration. However, the present work demonstrates that increasing the\nelectrolyte concentration does yield, on average, a reduction of the magnitude\nof the interaction force with electrolyte concentration. This implies that\ncharges on the water side also contribute significantly to the electrostatic\ninteractions. An increase in the concentration of SDS leads to a similar\ndecrease of the interaction force. Moreover the repulsion at fixed SDS\nconcentrations decreases over longer times. Finally, measurements of three-body\ninteractions provide insight into the anisotropic nature of the interactions.\nThe unique time-dependent and anisotropic interactions between particles at the\noil-water interface allow tailoring of the aggregation kinetics and structure\nof the suspension structure.\n","Comment: Submitted to Langmuir"]}]

After discussing the electromagnetism via\nchiral differential forms, we point out the optical activity of a given\nmaterial medium, closely related to topological spin, and the Faraday rotation,\nassociated to topological torsion. Both quantities are defined in terms of the\nmagnetic potential and the electric and magnetic fields and excitations. We\nrevisit some properties of material media and the associated Green dyadics.\nSome related features of ferrite are also investigated. It is well-known that\nthe constitutive tensor is essentially equivalent to the Riemann curvature\ntensor. In order to investigate the propagation of electromagnetic waves in\nmaterial media, we prove that it is analogous to consider the electromagnetic\nwave propagation in the vacuum, but this time in a curved spacetime, which is\nobtained by a deformation of the lorenztian metric of Minkowski spacetime.\nSpacetime deformations leave invariant the form of Maxwell equations. Also,\nthere exists a close relation between Maxwell equations in curved spacetime and\nin an anisotropic material medium, indicating that electromagnetism and\nspacetime properties are deeply related. Besides, the geometrical aspects of\nwave propagation can be described by an effective geometry which represents a\ndeformation of the lorentzian metric of Minkowski spacetime.\n","Comment: 21 pages"]}]

We give a picture on \"creation\" of\nthe Universe. By analogy with the original Brans-Dicke relation, several other\nsimilar relations were obtained in a previous paper (Berman, 2007d), which we\nnow extend, by relating the angular momentum L, absolute temperature T, and the\ncosmological \"constant\", with R, where R, M stand for the radius (scale-factor)\nand the mass of the causally related Universe. We show here that these\nproperties, which characterize Machian Universes, can be put in the form of\nequalities, which can be derived, from the conjecture that the total energy of\nthe Universe is null, alike with the effective energy density, and we therefore\nimply that R depends linearly with M ; the angular momentum runs like squared R\n; T, like R to the power -1/2 ; lambda, as R to the power -2 so that the total\nentropy of the Universe grows with R to the power 3/2, and, then, also as M to\nthe power 3/2. The \"loss of information paradox\", for black holes, is\ndismantled. It must be obvious, from this paper, that each type of energy\ncontribution, to the total energy of the Universe, divided by M multiplied by\nc-squared, yields a constant, during all times, so that, for instance, if the\npresent contribution of the cosmological \"constant\", drives the present\nUniverse, it also must have driven alike, in all the lifespan of the Machian\nUniverse: the relative contributions of densities of each kind, towards the\ntotal density, remain the same during all times.
