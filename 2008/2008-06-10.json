The MAPLE algorithm finds the\ndesired optimal power control solution by constructing a series of polyblocks\nthat approximate the feasible SINR region in increasing precision. Furthermore,\nby tuning the approximation factor in MAPEL, we could engineer a desirable\ntradeoff between optimality and convergence time.

Two cases were considered: direct circulation provided by a rim\nheater at the periphery and indirect circulation provided by a central heater.\nThe detailed 3D structure of the mean large-scale velocity field is\nreconstructed using the PIV technique. Due to the action of the Coriolis force\nthe meridional flow results in differential rotation. Differential rotation is\ncharacterized by the mean values of radial and vertical gradients of azimuthal\nvelocity. Strong negative mean radial gradient which grows with the Grasshoff\nnumber is provided by direct circulation. In the case of indirect circulation a\npronounced negative gradient arises at moderate Grashoff number. The behavior\nof the mean vertical gradient is quite different: a positive vertical gradient\ngrows logarithmically with Grasshoff number under direct circulation, whereas a\nweak negative gradient characterizes the indirect circulation. This difference\nfollows from the structure of the flow -- the direct circulation provides a\nlarge cyclonic area localized above the anticyclonic flow, while indirect\ncirculation leads to a strong separation of these two areas in the radial\ndirection (the central part is occupied by the cyclonic flow and the periphery\nby the anticyclonic flow). Meridional circulation leads to substantial\nvariation of the integral angular momentum. Direct circulation results in the\ngrowth of the integral angular momentum and indirect circulation causes it to\ndecrease. At the same heating power, the increase of angular momentum at direct\ncirculation is much stronger than its decrease at indirect circulation.\n"]}]

Such an isotropic field of an individual object can be viewed as a\nprototype of computer ego. It allows visualization of a holistic space of\nmulti-object relations (HSMOR) which has a complex structure depending on the\nnumber of objects, their mutual arrangement in space, and the type of metric\nused for assessment of (dis)similarities between the objects. In the course of\ncomputer simulation of cooperative interactions between the objects, only those\npoints of the space were registered which corresponded to transitions in\nhierarchical grouping. Such points appeared to aggregate into complex spatial\nstructures determining a unique internal organization of a respective HSMOR. We\ndescribe some of the peculiarities of such structures, referred to by us as\nattractor membranes, and discuss their properties. We also demonstrate the\npeculiarities of the changing of intergroup similarities which occurs when a\ndrifter infinitely moves away from the fixed objects.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 16 figures"]}]

We are interested in\nparticular in the situation where frozen disorder is present. These polymer\nmodels undergo a localization/delocalization transition. There is a large\n(bio)-physics literature on the subject since these systems describe, for\ninstance, the statistics of thermally created loops in DNA double strands and\nthe interaction between (1+1)-dimensional interfaces and disordered walls. In\nthese cases the transition corresponds, respectively, to the DNA denaturation\ntransition and to the wetting transition. More abstractly, one may see these\nmodels as random and inhomogeneous perturbations of renewal processes.\n  The last few years have witnessed a great progress in the mathematical\nunderstanding of the equilibrium properties of these systems. In particular,\nmany rigorous results about the location of the critical point, about critical\nexponents and path properties of the polymer in the two thermodynamic phases\n(localized and delocalized) are now available.\n  Here, we will focus on some aspects of this topic - in particular, on the\nnon-perturbative effects of disorder. The mathematical tools employed range\nfrom renewal theory to large deviations and, interestingly, show tight\nconnections with techniques developed recently in the mathematical study of\nmean field spin glasses.\n","Comment: Lecture Notes from the 5th Prague Summer School on Mathematical\n  Statistical Mechanics, September 11-22, 2006. to appear on Lecture Notes in\n  Mathematics. 34 pages, 1 figure; v2: references updated"]}]
