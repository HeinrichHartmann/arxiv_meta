We investigate the non-analyticity of this entropy at\ndisorder-dominated quantum phase transitions in non-interacting electronic\nsystems. At these critical points, the von Neumann entropy is determined by the\nsingle particle wave function intensity which exhibits complex scale invariant\nfluctuations. We find that the concept of multifractality is naturally suited\nfor studying von Neumann entropy of the critical wave functions. Our numerical\nsimulations of the three dimensional Anderson localization transition and the\ninteger quantum Hall plateau transition show that the entanglement at these\ntransitions is well described using multifractal analysis.\n","Comment: v3, 5 pages, published version"]}]
