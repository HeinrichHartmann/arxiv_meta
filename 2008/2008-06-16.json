The conditioning problem is thus to\ntransform a probabilistic database of priors into a posterior probabilistic\ndatabase which is materialized for subsequent query processing or further\nrefinement. It turns out that the conditioning problem is closely related to\nthe problem of computing exact tuple confidence values.\n  It is known that exact confidence computation is an NP-hard problem. This has\nled researchers to consider approximation techniques for confidence\ncomputation. However, neither conditioning nor exact confidence computation can\nbe solved using such techniques.\n  In this paper we present efficient techniques for both problems. We study\nseveral problem decomposition methods and heuristics that are based on the most\nsuccessful search techniques from constraint satisfaction, such as the\nDavis-Putnam algorithm.
