A powerful tool in the\ndescription of heavy fermion metals is the large N expansion, which expands the\nphysics in powers of 1/N about a solvable limit where particles carry a large\nnumber (N) of spin components. As it stands, this method is unable to jointly\ndescribe the spin quenching and superconductivity which develop in PuCoGa_{5}\nand NpPd_{5}Al_{2}. Here, we solve this problem with a new class of large N\nexpansion that employs the symplectic symmetry of spin to protect the odd\ntime-reversal parity of spin and sustain Cooper pairs as well-defined singlets.\nWith this method we show that when a lattice of magnetic ions exchange spin\nwith their metallic environment in two distinct symmetry channels, they are\nable to simultaneously satisfy both channels by forming a condensate of\ncomposite pairs between between local moments and electrons. In the tetragonal\ncrystalline environment relevant to PuCoGa_{5} and NpPd_{5}Al_{2} the lattice\nstructure selects a natural pair of spin exchange channels, giving rise to the\nprediction of a unique anisotropic paired state with g-wave symmetry. This\npairing mechanism predicts a large upturn in the NMR relaxation rate above\nT_{c}, a strong enhancement of Andreev reflection in tunneling measurements and\nan enhanced superconducting transition temperature T_{c} in Pu doped\nNp_{1-x}Pu_{x}Pd_{5}Al_{2}.\n","Comment: This is a substantially revised version of the original paper,\n  focussing on the high temperature heavy electron superconductors PuCoGa_5 and\n  NpPd_5Al_2.
