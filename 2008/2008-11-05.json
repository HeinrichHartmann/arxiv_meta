The advantage of the harmonic\ninteractions is that the integration of the equations of motion in the\nstreaming step can be performed analytically. Therefore, the algorithm is\ncomputationally as efficient as the original MPC algorithm for Newtonian\nfluids. The collision step is the same as in the original MPC method. All\nparticles are confined between two solid walls moving oppositely, so that both\nsteady and oscillatory shear flows can be investigated.

We find that both in steady and oscillatory shear flow, a\nboundary layer develops near the wall, with a higher velocity gradient than in\nthe bulk. The thickness of this layer is proportional to the average dumbbell\nsize. We determine the zero-shear viscosities as a function of the spring\nconstant of the dumbbells and the mean free path. For very high shear rates, a\nvery weak ``shear thickening'' behavior is observed.

A formulation is employed in which the binary\nclassifier is constructed as a thresholded linear superposition of a set of\nweak classifiers. The weights in the superposition are optimized in a learning\nprocess that strives to minimize the training error as well as the number of\nweak classifiers used. No efficient solution to this problem is known. To bring\nit into a format that allows the application of adiabatic quantum computing\n(AQC), we first show that the bit-precision with which the weights need to be\nrepresented only grows logarithmically with the ratio of the number of training\nexamples to the number of weak classifiers. This allows to effectively\nformulate the training process as a binary optimization problem. Solving it\nwith heuristic solvers such as tabu search, we find that the resulting\nclassifier outperforms a widely used state-of-the-art method, AdaBoost, on a\nvariety of benchmark problems. Moreover, we discovered the interesting fact\nthat bit-constrained learning machines often exhibit lower generalization error\nrates. Changing the loss function that measures the training error from 0-1\nloss to least squares maps the training to quadratic unconstrained binary\noptimization. This corresponds to the format required by D-Wave's\nimplementation of AQC. Simulations with heuristic solvers again yield results\nbetter than those obtained with boosting approaches. Since the resulting\nquadratic binary program is NP-hard, additional gains can be expected from\napplying the actual quantum processor.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 5 figures"]}]

In addition we\nused NACO to achieve the first spatially resolved mid-resolution spectra in the\nH- and K-band for a precise spectral type determination. The near-IR spectrum\nof Kelu-1A reveals a distinct dip in the H-band providing evidence that Kelu-1\nA itself is a spectroscopic binary. We derive spectral types of L0.5+- 0.5 for\nKelu- 1 Aa and T7.5+-1 for Kelu-1 Ab. Kelu-1B is classified as spectral type\nL3pec +-1.5. From the relative orbit, we derive an orbital period of 38 +8 -6\nyears and a semi-major axis of 6.4+2.4 -1.3 AU. This yields the first\ndynamically determined total system mass of 177 +113 -55 Mjup for the Kelu-1AB\nsystem, with the uncertainties mainly attributed to the error of the system\ndistance measurement and the yet missing apastron passage. The derived\nproperties of Kelu-1AB allow us to test common theoretical models. The\ncomparison of our results with color-magnitude diagrams based on evolutionary\nmodels yields a slightly revised age estimate (0.3 - 0.5 Gyr) and a discrepancy\nbetween dynamically and theoretically derived masses, stressing the importance\nfor further dynamical mass determinations of brown dwarf binaries.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 7 figures.
