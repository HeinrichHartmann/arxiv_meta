This model\ncombines epidemic spreading (dynamics on the network) with rewiring of network\nconnections (topological evolution of the network). We propose and implement a\ncomputational approach that enables us to study the dynamics of the network\ndirectly on an emergent, coarse-grained level. The approach sidesteps the\nderivation of closed low-dimensional approximations. Our investigations reveal\nthat global coupling, which enters through the awareness of the population to\nthe disease, can result in robust large-amplitude oscillations of the state and\ntopology of the network.\n","Comment: revised version 6 pages, 4 figures"]}]
