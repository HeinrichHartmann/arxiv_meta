Our proposal allows for conditional\nstrategies, as two rational agents make a choice from a restricted set of\ntwo-qubit unitary operations. Several frequently used classical strategies give\nrise to families of corresponding quantum strategies. A quantum version of the\nPrisoner's Dilemma in which both players use mixed strategies is presented as a\nspecific example. Since there are now quantum walk physical implementations at\na proof-of principle stage, this connection may represent a step towards the\nexperimental realization of quantum games.\n","Comment: Revtex 4, 6 pages, 3 figures.
