Typically a helicase translocates along one of\nthe NA single strands while unwinding and uses adenosine triphosphate (ATP)\nhydrolysis as an energy source. Here we model of a helicase motor that can\nswitch between two states, which could represent two different points in the\nATP hydrolysis cycle. Our model is an extension of the earlier\nBetterton-J\\\"ulicher model of helicases to incorporate switching between two\nstates. The main predictions of the model are the speed of unwinding of the\ndsNA and fluctuations around the average unwinding velocity. Motivated by a\nrecent claim that the NS3 helicase of Hepatitis C virus follows a flashing\nratchet mechanism, we have compared the experimental results for the NS3\nhelicase with a special limit of our model which corresponds to the flashing\nratchet scenario. Our model accounts for one key feature of the experimental\ndata on NS3 helicase. However, contradictory observations in experiments\ncarried out under different conditions limit the ability to compare the model\nto experiments.\n","Comment: minor modifications"]}]
