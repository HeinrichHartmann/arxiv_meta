Indeed, we derive generic SR\nequations from a polymer stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystal (LC) cell,\nwhich is a typical soft matter representative constituting one of the basic\ncomponents in several electro-optic applications. We generalize these equations\nfurther in order to study an even broader class of qualitatively different\nsystems, especially disclosing the influence of different types of static\ndisorder and interaction ranges amongst LC molecules on the SR response. We\ndetermine the required conditions for the observation of SR in the examined\nsystem, and moreover, reveal that a random field type static disorder yields\nqualitatively different responses with respect to random dilution, random bond\nand spin glass universality classes. In particular, while the latter three\ndecrease the level of dynamic disorder (Gaussian noise) warranting the optimal\nresponse, the former evokes exactly the opposite effect, hence increasing the\noptimal noise level that is needed to resonantly fine-tune the system's\nresponse in accordance with the weak deterministic electric field.

The latter equations\nare both known to be integrable, and admit peaked soliton (peakon) solutions\nwith discontinuous derivatives at the peaks. A combination of a reciprocal\ntransformation with Painlev\\'e analysis provides strong evidence that the\nPopowicz system is non-integrable. Nevertheless, we are able to construct exact\ntravelling wave solutions in terms of an elliptic integral, together with a\ndegenerate travelling wave corresponding to a single peakon. We also describe\nthe dynamics of N-peakon solutions, which is given in terms of an Hamiltonian\nsystem on a phase space of dimension 3N.\n","Comment: 8 pages, AIMS class file.
