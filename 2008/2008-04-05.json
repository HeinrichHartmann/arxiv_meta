These billiards have mixed\nregular-chaotic dynamics but different structures in their classical phase\nspaces. The spectrum of each billiard is represented as a time series where the\nlevel order plays the role of time. Two most important findings follow from the\ntime-series analysis. First, the spectra can be characterized by two distinct\nrelaxation lengths. This is a prerequisite for the validity of the\nsuperstatistical approach which is based on the folding of two distribution\nfunctions. Second, the shape of the resulting probability density function of\nthe so-called superstatistical parameter is reasonably approximated by an\ninverse chi-square distribution. This distribution is used to compute\nnearest-neighbor spacing distributions and compare them with those of the\nresonance frequencies of billiards with mixed dynamics within the framework of\nsuperstatistics. The obtained spacing distribution is found to present a good\ndescription of the experimental ones and is of the same or even better quality\nas a number of other spacing distributions, including the one from Berry and\nRobnik. However, in contrast to other approaches towards a theoretical\ndescription of spectral properties of systems with mixed dynamics,\nsuperstatistics also provides a description of properties of the\neigenfunctions.
