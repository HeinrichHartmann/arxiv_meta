The steerable\nwavelet constructed from the second derivative of a Gaussian allows one to\ndefine three local morphological measures, namely the signed-intensity,\norientation and elongation of local features. Detections of correlation between\nthe WMAP and NVSS data are made with each of these morphological measures. The\nmost significant detection is obtained in the correlation of the\nsigned-intensity of local features at a significance of 99.9%. By inspecting\nsigned-intensity sky maps, it is possible for the first time to see the\ncorrelation between the WMAP and NVSS data by eye. Foreground contamination and\ninstrumental systematics in the WMAP data are ruled out as the source of all\nsignificant detections of correlation. Our results provide new insight on the\nISW effect by probing the morphological nature of the correlation induced\nbetween the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure of the\nUniverse. Given the current constraints on the flatness of the Universe, our\ndetection of the ISW effect again provides direct and independent evidence for\ndark energy.

One manifestation of electron-phonon coupling is a mass renormalization of\nthe electronic dispersion at the energy scale associated with the phonons. This\nrenormalization is directly observable in photoemission experiments. In\ncontrast, there remains little consensus on the pairing mechanism in cuprate\nhigh temperature superconductors.

When the\nreference set is finite and when n denotes the size of the training data, we\nprovide minimax convergence rates of the form C ([log |G|]/n)^v with tight\nevaluation of the positive constant C and with exact v in ]0;1], the latter\nvalue depending on the convexity of the loss function and on the level of noise\nin the output distribution. The risk upper bounds are based on a sequential\nrandomized algorithm, which at each step concentrates on functions having both\nlow risk and low variance with respect to the previous step prediction\nfunction. Our analysis puts forward the links between the probabilistic and\nworst-case viewpoints, and allows to obtain risk bounds unachievable with the\nstandard statistical learning approach. One of the key idea of this work is to\nuse probabilistic inequalities with respect to appropriate (Gibbs)\ndistributions on the prediction function space instead of using them with\nrespect to the distribution generating the data. The risk lower bounds are\nbased on refinements of the Assouad's lemma taking particularly into account\nthe properties of the loss function. Our key example to illustrate the upper\nand lower bounds is to consider the L_q-regression setting for which an\nexhaustive analysis of the convergence rates is given while q describes\n[1;+infinity[.\n"]}]
