The first topic concerns weak measurements and their\nuniversality as a means of generating quantum operations. It is shown that\nevery generalized measurement can be implemented as a sequence of weak\n(infinitesimal) measurements. The second topic is an application of this result\nto the theory of entanglement. Necessary and sufficient differential conditions\nfor entanglement monotones are derived and are used to find a new entanglement\nmonotone for three-qubit states. The third topic is a study of the performance\nof different master equations for the description of non-Markovian dynamics.\nThe system studied is a qubit coupled to a spin bath via the Ising interaction.\nThe fourth topic investigates continuous QEC in the presence of non-Markovian\nnoise. It is shown that due to the existence of a Zeno regime in non-Markovian\ndynamics, the performance of continuous QEC exhibits a quadratic improvement\nfor a sufficiently high time resolution of the error-correcting operations. The\nfifth topic studies the conditions for correctability of subsystem codes under\ncontinuous dynamics. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the Lindbladian and\nthe system-environment Hamiltonian are derived. The sixth topic examines the\nrobustness of operator QEC codes against initialization errors. A new measure\nof fidelity for encoded information is introduced and is used to show that\noperator codes are robust against imperfect initialization without the need for\nrestriction of the standard operator QEC conditions. The last topic concerns\nholonomic quantum computation (HQC) and stabilizer codes. A fault-tolerant\nscheme for HQC is presented, proving the scalability of the holonomic approach.\n","Comment: Ph.D. thesis, University of Southern California, 2008, 256 pages"]}]

We compare the general\nlog-likelihood ratio (the G or G2 statistic) statistic between the evolutionary\ntree model and the multinomial model with that of marginalized tests applied to\nan alignment (using placental mammal coding sequence data). It is seen that the\nmost general test does not reject the fit of data to model (p~0.5), but the\nmarginalized tests do. Tests on pair-wise frequency (F) matrices, strongly (p <\n0.001) reject the most general phylogenetic (GTR) models commonly in use.

Recently, by studying 6 lensing systems,\nFerreras et al. (2008) claimed that MOND still needs dark matter even in\ngalactic scales. When we study the same systems, however, we yield an opposite\nconclusion. In this contribution, we report our result and conclude that MOND\ndoes not need dark matter in galactic lensing systems. Furthermore, we extend\nour study to 22 SLACS (Sloan Lens ACS Survey) lenses, and obtain the same\nconclusion as well, i.e., no dark matter is needed in elliptical galaxies.\n","Comment: 2pages, 1 figure, conference"]}]

At high temperatures and\nlow frequencies, thermal noise assists delocalization of the pinned particles,\nrendering the system to recover net motion along the gentler direction of the\nsubstrate potential. The joint effect of high temperature and high frequency,\non the other hand, induces an additional current inversion, this time favoring\nmotion along the direction where the ratchet potential is steeper.

These are fossil and/or biogeographic evidence that give estimates of\nthe absolute age of nodes (ancestors) and molecular estimates that give us\nestimates of the relative ages of nodes in a molecular evolutionary tree. Both\nforms of data are often best characterized as yielding continuous probability\ndistributions on nodes. Here, the distributions modeling older fossil\ncalibrations within the tree of placental (eutherian) mammals are reconsidered.\nIn particular the Horse/Rhino, Human/Tarsier, Whale/ Hippo, Rabbit/Pika and\nRodentia calibrations are reexamined and adjusted. Inferring the relative ages\nof nodes in a phylogeny also requires the assumption of a model of evolutionary\nrate change across the tree. Here nine models of evolutionary rate change, are\ncombined with various continuous distributions modeling fossil calibrations.\nFit of model is measured both relative to a normalized fit, which assumes that\nall models fit well in the absence of multiple fossil calibrations, and also by\nthe linearity of their residuals. The normalized fit used attempts to track\ntwice the log likelihood difference from the best expected model. The results\nsuggest there is a very large difference in the age of the root proposed by\ncalibrations in Supraprimates (informally Euarchontoglires) versus\nLaurasiatheria. Combining both sets of calibrations results in the penalty\nfunction vastly increasing in all cases.
