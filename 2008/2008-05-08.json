Recently, there has been renewed\ninterest in decoding RS codes without using syndromes. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the complexity of syndromeless decoding for RS codes, and compare\nit to that of syndrome-based decoding. Aiming to provide guidelines to\npractical applications, our complexity analysis differs in several aspects from\nexisting asymptotic complexity analysis, which is typically based on\nmultiplicative fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques and is usually in big O\nnotation. First, we focus on RS codes over characteristic-2 fields, over which\nsome multiplicative FFT techniques are not applicable. Secondly, due to\nmoderate block lengths of RS codes in practice, our analysis is complete since\nall terms in the complexities are accounted for. Finally, in addition to fast\nimplementation using additive FFT techniques, we also consider direct\nimplementation, which is still relevant for RS codes with moderate lengths.\nComparing the complexities of both syndromeless and syndrome-based decoding\nalgorithms based on direct and fast implementations, we show that syndromeless\ndecoding algorithms have higher complexities than syndrome-based ones for high\nrate RS codes regardless of the implementation. Both errors-only and\nerrors-and-erasures decoding are considered in this paper. We also derive\ntighter bounds on the complexities of fast polynomial multiplications based on\nCantor's approach and the fast extended Euclidean algorithm.\n","Comment: 11 pages, submitted to EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and\n  Networking"]}]

Only three BL Lacs are known so\nfar to contain a kpc-scale X-ray jet. In this paper, we present the evidence\nfor the existence of a fourth extended X-ray jet in the classical\nradio-selected source S5 2007+777, which for its hybrid FRI/II radio morphology\nhas been classified as a HYMOR (HYbrid MOrphology Radio source). Our Chandra\nACIS-S observations of this source revealed an X-ray counterpart to the\n19\"-long radio jet. Interestingly, the X-ray properties of the kpc-scale jet in\nS5 2007+777 are very similar to those observed in FRII jets. First, the X-ray\nmorphology closely mirrors the radio one, with the X-rays being concentrated in\nthe discrete radio knots. Second, the X-ray continuum of the jet/brightest knot\nis described by a very hard power law, with photon index Gamma_x~1, although\nthe uncertainties are large. Third, the optical upper limit from archival HST\ndata implies a concave radio-to-X-ray SED. If the X-ray emission is attributed\nto IC/CMB with equipartition, strong beaming (delta=13) is required, implying a\nvery large scale (Mpc) jet. The beaming requirement can be somewhat relaxed\nassuming a magnetic field lower than equipartition. Alternatively, synchrotron\nemission from a second population of very high-energy electrons is viable.\nComparison to other HYMOR jets detected with Chandra is discussed, as well as\ngeneral implications for the origin of the FRI/II division.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ, 19 pages, 3 figures"]}]

The\nprobability of particle localization in either of the wells is studied in\ndetail. Certain field-averaged correlation functions for quantum-mechanical\nprobabilities and the distribution function for the probabilities of final\nstates (which can be considered as random variables in the presence of a random\nfield) are calculated. The calculated correlators are used to discuss the\ndependence of the final state on the initial state. One of the main results of\nthis work is that, although the off-diagonal elements of density matrix\ndisappear with time, a particle in the system is localized incompletely\n(wave-packet reduction does not occur), and the distribution function for the\nprobability of finding particle in one of the wells is a constant at infinite\ntime.\n","Comment: 5 pages"]}]
