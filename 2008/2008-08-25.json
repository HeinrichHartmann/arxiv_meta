We develop a cluster-correlation\nexpansion (CCE) theory for the spin bath dynamics relevant to the qubit\ndecoherence problem. A cluster correlation term is recursively defined as the\nevolution of a group of bath spins divided by the cluster correlations of all\nthe subgroups. The so-defined correlation accounts for the authentic collective\nexcitations within a given group. The bath propagator is the product of all\npossible cluster correlation terms. For a finite-time evolution as in the qubit\ndecoherence problem, a convergent result can be obtained by truncating the\nexpansion up to a certain cluster size. The two-spin cluster truncation of the\nCCE corresponds to the pair-correlation approximation [PRB 74,195301(2006)]. In\nterms of the standard linked cluster expansion, a cluster correlation term is\nthe infinite summation of all the connected diagrams with all and only the\nspins in the group flip-flopped, and thus the expansion is exact whenever\nconverges. When the individual contribution of each higher-order correlation\nterm to the decoherence is small, as the usual case for relatively large baths\nwhere the decoherence could complete well within the bath spin flip-flop time,\nthe CCE coincides with the cluster expansion [PRB 74,035322(2006)]. For small\nbaths, however, the qubit decoherence may not complete within the bath spin\nflip-flop timescale and thus individual higher-order cluster correlations could\ngrow significant. In such cases, only the CCE converges to the exact coherent\ndynamics of multi-spin clusters.

An effective black\nholes (BH) in curved Riemannian spacetime in a random walk plasmas is endowed\nwith a naked singularity, when plasmas are in the lowest diffusion mode. The\nplasma particle diffusion is encoded in the effective metric. The diffusive\nsolution has a horizon when the plasma flow reaches the sound velocity in the\nmedium and a shock wave is obtained inside the slab. The sonic black hole\ncurved Riemannian metric is also found in terms of particle number density in\nplasmas. The sonic BH singularity is found at the center of the plasma\ndiffusive slab from the study of the Ricci curvature scalar for constant\ndiffusion coefficient. It is suggested and shown that the Hawking temperature\nis proportional to the plasma Kelvin temperature through diffusion coefficient\ndependence to this temperature. Therefore Unruh sonic or dumb BH is shown to\nhave a relation between Hawking and plasma diffusive temperatures. BH\nevaporation is analogous to the diffusive phenomena in plasmas, since in both\ncases Hawking temperature is inversely proportional to mass. It is shown that\nHawking analogue temperature of a plasma torus is\n$T_{H}(torus)\\approx{10^{-4}K}$ which is much higher than the gravitational\nHawking temperature of a one solar mass BH, ${T_{H}}^{GR}\\approx{10^{-8}K}$,\nbut still very small for being detectable in plasma laboratories.\n","Comment: Dept fisica teorica-UERJ-Brasil"]}]
