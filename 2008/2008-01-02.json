A\nreversible Finsler space is geodesically reversible, but the converse need not\nbe true.\n  In this note, building on recent work of LeBrun and Mason, it is shown that a\ngeodesically reversible Finsler metric of constant flag curvature on the\n2-sphere is necessarily projectively flat.\n  As a corollary, using a previous result of the author, it is shown that a\nreversible Finsler metric of constant flag curvature on the 2-sphere is\nnecessarily a Riemannian metric of constant Gauss curvature, thus settling a\nlong-standing problem in Finsler geometry.\n","Comment: 11 pages, references added, some arguments improved and exposition\n  rearranged"]}]

In a previous paper, the authors showed that the\nT-equivariant K-theory of the manifold M surjects onto the ordinary integral\nK-theory of the symplectic quotient M \\mod T of M by T, under certain technical\nconditions on the moment map. In this paper, we use equivariant Morse theory to\ngive a method for computing the K-theory of the symplectic quotient by\nobtaining an explicit description of the kernel of the surjection \\kappa:\nK^*_T(M) \\onto K^*(M \\mod T). Our results are K-theoretic analogues of the work\nof Tolman and Weitsman for Borel equivariant cohomology. Further, we prove that\nunder suitable technical conditions on the T-orbit stratification of M, there\nis an explicit Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson (``GKM'') type combinatorial\ndescription of the K-theory of a Hamiltonian T-space in terms of fixed point\ndata. Finally, we illustrate our methods by computing the ordinary K-theory of\ncompact symplectic toric manifolds, which arise as symplectic quotients of an\naffine space \\C^N by a linear torus action.\n","Comment: 15 pages; typos corrected"]}]

The\npresent scheme is efficient in that all the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states\nused in the quantum secret sharing scheme are used to generate shared secret\nmessages except those chosen for checking eavesdropper. In our scheme, the\nmeasuring basis of communication parties is invariable and the classical\ninformation used to check eavesdropping needs only the results of measurements\nof the communication parties. Another nice feature of our scheme is that the\nsender transmit her secret messages to the receivers directly and the receivers\nrecover the sender's secret by combining their results, different from the QSS\nscheme whose object is essentially to allow a sender to establish a shared key\nwith the receivers.
