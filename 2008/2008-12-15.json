Multi-layer\nMirroring Neural Network is a neural network that can be trained with\ngeneralized data inputs (different categories of image patterns) to perform\nnon-linear dimensionality reduction and the resultant low-dimensional code is\nused for unsupervised pattern classification using Forgy's algorithm.

The class of alpha-critical graphs has several\nnice structural properties, most of them related to their defect which is the\nnumber of vertices minus two times the stability number. In particular, a\nremarkable result of Lov\\'asz (1978) is the finite basis theorem for\nalpha-critical graphs of a fixed defect. The class of alpha-critical graphs is\nalso of interest for at least two topics of polyhedral studies.

Doignon, Fiorini\nand Joret (2006) handle the weighted case and thus define facet-defining\ngraphs.

By contrast to the\nGalton-Watson case, here random environments and the branching process can\nconspire to achieve atypical events such as $Z_n \\le e^{cn}$ when $c$ is\nsmaller than the typical geometric growth rate $\\bar L$ and $ Z_n \\ge e^{cn}$\nwhen $c > \\bar L$.

Sampling from these distributions is crucial for parameter\nestimation hypothesis testing, and more generally for understanding basic\nfeatures of the network model itself. In practice sampling is typically carried\nout using Markov chain Monte Carlo, in particular either the Glauber dynamics\nor the Metropolis-Hasting procedure.\n  In this paper we characterize the high and low temperature regimes of the\nexponential random graph model. We establish that in the high temperature\nregime the mixing time of the Glauber dynamics is $\\Theta(n^2 \\log n)$, where\n$n$ is the number of vertices in the graph; in contrast, we show that in the\nlow temperature regime the mixing is exponentially slow for any local Markov\nchain. Our results, moreover, give a rigorous basis for criticisms made of such\nmodels. In the high temperature regime, where sampling with MCMC is possible,\nwe show that any finite collection of edges are asymptotically independent;\nthus, the model does not possess the desired reciprocity property, and is not\nappreciably different from the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graph.\n","Comment: 20 pages"]}]

Though there exists codes for 4 and 16\ntransmit antennas with no zero entry, there is no general method of\nconstruction which gives codes for any number of transmit antennas. In this\npaper, we construct SCODs for any power of 2 number of transmit antennas having\nall its entries non-zero.
