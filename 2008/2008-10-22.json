The embedded contact homology (ECH) index associates\nan integer to each relative 2-dimensional homology class of surfaces whose\nboundary is the difference between two unions of Reeb orbits. This integer\ndetermines the relative grading on ECH; the ECH differential counts holomorphic\ncurves in the symplectization of Y whose relative homology classes have ECH\nindex 1. A known index inequality implies that such curves are (mostly)\nembedded and satisfy some additional constraints. In this paper we prove four\nnew results about the ECH index.

Second, we extend the ECH index\ninequality to symplectic cobordisms between three-manifolds with Hamiltonian\nstructures, and simplify the proof. Third, we establish general inequalities on\nthe ECH index of unions and multiple covers of holomorphic curves in\ncobordisms. Finally, we define a new relative filtration on ECH, or any other\nkind of contact homology of a contact 3-manifold, which is similar to the ECH\nindex and related to the Euler characteristic of holomorphic curves.

Above 10 keV all the observations have been obtained\nwith collimated detectors or coded mask instruments. To make a leap step\nforward in X-ray astronomy above 10 keV it is necessary to extend the principle\nof focusing X ray optics to higher energies, up to 80 keV and beyond.

We\nhave compared our results of gluon structure function with global MRST 2004 and\nGRV 1998 gluon parameterizations and the results of deuteron structure function\nwith New Muon Collaboration (NMC) data. We have shown that the solutions of\ncoupled equations give accurate results for the structure functions and also\nthe compatibility of Regge behaviour of quark and gluon structure functions\nwith perturbative quantum chromodynamics (PQCD) at low-x.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Here we show how the route can be\nunderstood through a planar dynamical system in which a limit cycle becomes the\nhomoclinic orbit of a saddle point (saddle-loop bifurcation). The whole picture\nis unveiled, and the mechanism by which this reduction occurs from the full\ninfinite-dimensional dynamical system is studied. Finally, it is shown that the\nbifurcation leads to an excitability regime, under the application of suitable\nperturbations. Excitability is an emergent property for this system, as it\nemerges from the spatial dependence since the system does not exhibit any\nexcitable behavior locally.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 9 figures"]}]

Particularly, it is\nfound that the neglect of the finite-size effect on the pionium lifetime\nmeasurement in the experiment DIRAC at CERN could lead to the lifetime\noverestimation comparable with the 10% statistical error.
