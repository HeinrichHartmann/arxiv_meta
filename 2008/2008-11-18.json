The polarization across the broad H\nalpha, H beta, and He I 5876 lines of SN 1997eg forms closed loops when viewed\nin the Stokes q-u plane. Such loops occur when the geometrical symmetry of one\nor both of the Stokes parameters across spectral lines is broken, in this case\nmost likely by occultation of the ejecta by the equatorial circumstellar matter\nconcentration. The polarization of the narrow Balmer lines possesses an\nintrinsic axis that differs by 12 degrees from that of the elongated ejecta and\nprobably indicates the orientation of the disk-like circumstellar material. The\nexistence of two different axes of symmetry in SN 1997eg suggests that neither\nrotation of the progenitor nor the influence of a companion star can be the\nsole mechanism creating a preferred axis within the supernova system.

Thousands of IRDCs have already been identified. To date, it has not\nbeen resolved whether IRDCs always show star formation activity and, if so, if\nmassive star formation (> 8 solar masses) is the rule or the exception in\nIRDCs. Previous analysis of sub-millimeter cores in the cloud MSXDC\nG048.65-00.29 (G48.65) indicates embedded star formation activity. To\ncharacterize this activity in detail, mid-infrared photometry (3-30 micron) has\nbeen obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope. This paper analyzes the point\nsources seen in the 24 micron band, combined with counterparts or upper limits\nat shorter and longer wavelengths. Data points in wavelength bands ranging from\n1 up to 850 micron are used to compare each 24 micron source to a set of\nSpectral Energy Distributions of Young Stellar Object (YSO) models. By\nassessing the models that fit the data, an attempt is made to identify YSOs as\nsuch and determine their evolutionary stages and stellar masses. A total of 17\nsources are investigated, 13 of which are classified as YSOs, primarily - but\nnot exclusively - in an early embedded phase of star formation. The modeled\nmasses of the central stellar objects range from sub-solar to ~8 solar masses.\nEvery YSO is at less than 1 pc projected distance from its nearest YSO\nneighbor. We conclude that IRDC G48.65 is a region of active star formation. We\nfind YSOs in various evolutionary phases, indicating that the star formation in\nthis cloud is not an instantaneous process.

The\nsoftening process can also be observed in the later phase of the bursts and its\ncause has also been unknown. Recently, it was suggested that, influenced by the\ncurvature effect, emission from high latitudes would shift the Band function\nspectrum from higher energy band to lower band, and this would give rise to the\nobserved softening process accompanied by a steep decay of the flux density.\nThe curvature effect scenario predicts that the terminating time of the\nsoftening process would be correlated with the duration of the process. In this\npaper, based on the data from the UNLV GRB group web-site, we found an obvious\ncorrelation between the two quantities. In addition, we found that the\nsoftening process can be divided into two classes: the early type softening\n($t_{s,max}\\leq \"4000\"s$) and the late type softening ($t_{s,max} > \"4000\"s$).\nThe two types of softening show different behaviors in the duration vs.\nterminating time plot. In the relation between the variation rates of the flux\ndensity and spectral index during the softening process, a discrepancy between\nthe two types of softening is also observed. According to their time scales and\nthe discrepancy between them, we propose that the two types are of different\norigins: the early type is of internal shock origin and the late type is of\nexternal shock origin. The early softening is referred to the steep decay just\nfollowing the prompt emission, whereas the late decay typically conceives the\ntransition from flat decay to late afterglow decay. We suspect that there might\nbe a great difference of the Lorentz factor in two classes which is responsible\nfor the observed discrepancy.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, Accepted for Publication to Journal of\n  Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics (JCAP)"]}]

The analysis in [1] is based on the following\nessential approximations: 1. The SNR was defined in terms of total\nafter-projection signal and noise powers, and the BER was analyzed based on\ntheir ratio. This corresponds to a non-coherent (power-wise) equal-gain\ncombining of both the signal and the noise, and it is not optimum since it does\nnot provide the maximum output SNR. 2. The definition of the total\nafter-projection noise power at each step ignored the fact that the\nafter-projection noise vector had correlated components. 3. The after-combining\nnoises at different steps (and hence the errors) were implicitly assumed to be\nindependent of each other. Under non-coherent equal-gain combining, that is not\nthe case.

The dynamics is parameterized by a so-called\npropensity parameter $p$ that determines the tendency of negative links to\nbecome positive. As a function of $p$ we find a phase transition between\ndifferent kind of absorbing states. The phases differ by the existence of an\ninfinitely connected (percolated) cluster of negative links that forms whenever\n$p\\leq p_c$. Moreover, for $p\\leq p_c$, the time to reach the absorbing state\ngrows powerlike with the system size $L$, while it increases logarithmically\nwith $L$ for $p > p_c$.

It is of importance in tasks such as\nefficiently solving a large linear system over GF[2], or iterative decoding of\nlow-density parity-check codes used over the binary erasure channel. Similar\nstructures emerge in a variety of NP-hard combinatorial optimization and\ndecision problems, from vertex cover to satisfiability. For a uniformly chosen\nrandom hypergraph of $m=n\\rho$ vertices and $n$ hyperedges, each consisting of\nthe same fixed number $l\\geq3$ of vertices, the size of the core exhibits for\nlarge $n$ a first-order phase transition, changing from $o(n)$ for $\\rho>\\rho\n_{\\mathrm{c}}$ to a positive fraction of $n$ for $\\rho<\\rho_{\\mathrm{c}}$, with\na transition window size $\\Theta(n^{-1/2})$ around $\\rho_{\\mathrm{c}}>0$.\nAnalyzing the corresponding ``leaf removal'' algorithm, we determine the\nassociated finite-size scaling behavior. In particular, if $\\rho$ is inside the\nscaling window (more precisely, $\\rho=\\rho_{\\mathrm{c}}+rn^{-1/2}$), the\nprobability of having a core of size $\\Theta(n)$ has a limit strictly between 0\nand 1, and a leading correction of order $\\Theta(n^{-1/6})$. The correction\nadmits a sharp characterization in terms of the distribution of a Brownian\nmotion with quadratic shift, from which it inherits the scaling with $n$. This\nbehavior is expected to be universal for a wide collection of combinatorial\nproblems.\n","Comment: Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/07-AAP514 the Annals of\n  Applied Probability (http://www.imstat.org/aap/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)"]}]

Jon Kleinberg showed that in some graphs of this\ntype it is possible to route, or navigate, between vertices in few steps even\nwith very little knowledge of the graph itself. In an attempt to understand how\nsuch graphs arise we introduce a different criterion for graphs to be navigable\nin this sense, relating the neighbor selection of a vertex to the hitting\nprobability of routed walks. In several models starting from both discrete and\ncontinuous settings, this can be shown to lead to graphs with the desired\nproperties. It also leads directly to an evolutionary model for the creation of\nsimilar graphs by the stepwise rewiring of the edges, and we conjecture,\nsupported by simulations, that these too are navigable.\n","Comment: Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/07-AAP499 the Annals of\n  Applied Probability (http://www.imstat.org/aap/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)"]}]
