With this study we can investigate\nthe properties of both the spin transport and the spin relaxation at the same\ntime. The Fourier component of the spin signal decays double exponentially with\ntwo decay rates $1/\\tau_+$ and $1/\\tau_-$. In high temperature regime, the\naverage of these two rates varies with the grating wave-vector $q$\nquadratically, i.e., $(1/\\tau_++1/\\tau_-)/2=D_sq^2+1/\\tilde{\\tau}_s$, with\n$D_s$ and $\\tilde{\\tau}_s$ representing the spin diffusion coefficient and the\naverage of the out-of-plane and the in-plane spin relaxation times\nrespectively. $\\tau_{\\pm}$ calculated from our theory are in good agreement\nwith the experimental data by Weber {\\em et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 98},\n076604 (2007)]. By comparing $D_s$ with and without the electron-electron\nCoulomb scattering, we calculate the contribution of Coulomb drag to the spin\ndiffusion coefficient. With the transient spin grating result, we further\nreveal the relations among different characteristic parameters such as spin\ndiffusion coefficient $D_s$, spin relaxation time $\\tau_s$, and spin injection\nlength $L_s$. We show that in the presence of the Dresselhaus and/or Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling, the widely used relation $L_s=\\sqrt{D_s\\tau_s}$ is\ngenerally inaccurate and can even be very wrong in some special cases. We\npresent an accurate way to extract the steady-state transport characteristic\nparameters from the transient spin grating signals.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 4 figures, to be published in JAP"]}]
