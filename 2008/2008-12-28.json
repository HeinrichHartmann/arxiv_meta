Our results also imply,\nmore generally, that there are no superpolynomial separations between\nquantum-classical and classical-classical SMP protocols for functional\nproblems. This contrasts with the situation for relational problems, where\nexponential gaps between quantum-classical and classical-classical SMP\nprotocols are known.
