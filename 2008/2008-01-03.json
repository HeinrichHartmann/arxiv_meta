The frozen configuration creates a pinning field on the\nsurface of the free sphere. The pinning field forces the sphere to stay in the\nmetastable phase as long as its size is smaller than the critical nucleus. We\ntest our method in two first-order systems, both on a two-dimensional lattice:\na system where the parameter tuning the transition is the magnetic field, and a\nsecond system where the tuning parameter is the temperature. In both cases the\nresults are satisfying.
