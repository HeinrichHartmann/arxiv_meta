The first purpose is to present an\nexplicit description of expanded cyclic codes defined in $\\GF(q^m)$. The\nproposed explicit construction of expanded generator matrix and expanded parity\ncheck matrix maintains the symbol-wise algebraic structure and thus keeps many\nimportant original characteristics. The second purpose of this paper is to\nidentify a class of constant-weight cyclic codes. Specifically, we show that a\nwell-known class of $q$-ary BCH codes excluding the all-zero codeword are\nconstant-weight cyclic codes. Moreover, we show this class of codes achieve the\nPlotkin bound. The last purpose of the paper is to characterize expanded cyclic\ncodes utilizing the proposed expanded generator matrix and parity check matrix.\nWe characterize the properties of component codewords of a codeword and\nparticularly identify the precise conditions under which a codeword can be\nrepresented by a subbasis. Our developments reveal an alternative while more\ngeneral view on the subspace subcodes of Reed-Solomon codes. With the new\ninsights, we present an improved lower bound on the minimum distance of an\nexpanded cyclic code by exploiting the generalized concatenated structure. We\nalso show that the fixed-rate binary expanded Reed-Solomon codes are\nasymptotically \"bad\", in the sense that the ratio of minimum distance over code\nlength diminishes with code length going to infinity. It overturns the\nprevalent conjecture that they are \"good\" codes and deviates from the ensemble\nof generalized Reed-Solomon codes which asymptotically achieves the\nGilbert-Varshamov bound.\n","Comment: 23 pages.

These cavity-based\nRaman schemes can be used to coherently manipulate both the internal and the\nmotional degrees of freedom of the atom, and thus provide powerful tools for\nstudying cavity quantum electrodynamics. We give a detailed theoretical\nanalysis of each scheme, both for a three-level atom and for a multi-level\ncesium atom.

To explain these\nobservations qualitatively we suggest that the onset of subcritical instability\nis related to decline of viscosity of the fluid: friction between fluid layers\nfails with the increase of the velocity gradient. To describe the declinie of\nfriction theoretically we relax the the assumption of the stability of the\nfluid material and introduce a constant of fluid strength.

The\nclasical model is obtained from the enhanced one when strength goes to\ninfinity. We use the modified Navier-Stokes model to analyze the Couette flow\nbetween two parallel plates and find that the lateral perturbations can\ndestabilize the flow and the critical Reynolds number is proportional to the\nfluid strength.

Similar to bit commitment schemes, such schemes are supposed to\nbe binding, i.e Alice cannot change her choice after committing, and concealing\ni.e. Bob cannot find Alice's committed string before Alice reveals it.\n  Ideal commitment schemes are known to be impossible. Even if some degrees of\ncheating is allowed, Buhrman, Christandl, Hayden, Lo and Wehner\n(quant-ph/0504078) have recently shown that there are some binding-concealing\ntrade-offs that any quantum string commitment scheme (QSC) must follow. They\nshowed trade-offs both in the scenario of single execution of the protocol and\nin the asymptotic regime of sufficiently large number of parallel executions of\nthe protocol.\n  We present here new trade-offs in the scenario of single execution of a QSC\nprotocol. Our trade-offs also immediately imply the trade-off shown by Buhrman\net al. in the asymptotic regime. We show our results by making a central use of\nan important information theoretic tool called the substate theorem due to\nJain, Radhakrishnan and Sen. Our techniques are quite different from that of\nBuhrman et al. and may be of independent interest.\n","Comment: To appear in Journal of Cryptology, 10 pages, ver5"]}]
