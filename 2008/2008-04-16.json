We prove that the cardinality of the complement of the\nhyperplanes is a quasi-polynomial in two ways, first via the theory of\nelementary divisors and then via the theory of the Ehrhart quasi-polynomials.\nThis result is useful for determining the characteristic polynomial of the\ncorresponding real arrangement. With the former approach, we also prove that\nintersection lattices modulo $q$ are periodic except for a finite number of\n$q$'s.\n"]}]

The present approach\ncomplements the multi-fractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) method\nand is quite accurate for small size data sets. As compared to polynomial fits\nin the MF-DFA, a single Daubechies wavelet is used here for de-trending\npurposes. The natural, built-in variable window size in wavelet transforms\nmakes this procedure well suited for non-stationary data. We illustrate the\nworking of this method through the analysis of binomial multi-fractal model.\nFor this model, our results compare well with those calculated analytically and\nobtained numerically through MF-DFA. To show the efficacy of this approach for\nfinite data sets, we also do the above comparison for Gaussian white noise time\nseries of different size. In addition, we analyze time series of three\nexperimental data sets of tokamak plasma and also spin density fluctuations in\n2D Ising model.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 7 figures"]}]
