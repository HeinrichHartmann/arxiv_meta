Once the spectrum has got quite a wide mass gap, it\nallows us to approximate the bag contribution into the potential by a constant\nvalue of bag mass at low distances less than the bag size. The bag mass can be\nevaluated in a constituent model. The analysis is given for the bag\ncontribution into the distribution over the invariant mass of two pions in the\nhadronic transition between the S-wave states of bag-quarkonium and heavy\nquarkonium, that leads to the anomaly violating the chiral limit in the region\nof low invariant masses, which agrees with the observational data. Leptonic\nconstants of vector states are investigated in the presence of exotic states in\nthe framework of quasilocal sum rules.

The importance of our approach is to model\nthe Brownian motion more realistically than the usual one based on the\nclassical Langevin equation, in that it takes into account also the retarding\neffects due to hydrodynamic backflow, i.e. the added mass and the Basset memory\ndrag.

The random\nforce has been shown to be represented by a superposition of the usual white\nnoise with a \"fractional\" noise. The velocity correlation function is no longer\nexpressed by a simple exponential but exhibits a slower decay, proportional to\n$t^{-3/2}$ as $t \\to \\infty$, which indeed is more realistic. Finally, the mean\nsquared displacement has been shown to maintain, for sufficiently long times,\nthe linear behaviour which is typical of normal diffusion, with the same\ndiffusion coefficient of the classical case.
