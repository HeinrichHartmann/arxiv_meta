We examine six\nnearby star-forming galaxies to disentangle the role of the dust from other\nparameters such as gas kinematics, geometry and ISM morphology in the\nobscuration of Ly-alpha. Thereby we aim to understand the Ly-a escape physics\nand infer the implications for high-redshift studies.

In the case of a dense,\nstatic HI covering, we observe a damped absorption with a declining\nrelationship between Lya and E(B-V). We found that the Lya escape fraction does\nnot exceed 10% in all our galaxies and is mostly about 3% or below. Finally,\nbecause of the radiative transfer complexity of the Lya line, star formation\nrate based on Lya luminosity is underestimated with respect to that derived\nfrom UV luminosity. The failure of simple dust correction to recover the\nintrinsic Lya/Ha ratio or the total star formation rate should prompt us to be\nmore cautious when interpreting high-z observations and related properties,\nsuch as SFRs based on Lya alone.

The modulus is defined on a\nramified sector in the canonical perturbation parameter $\\eps$. As in the case\nof the Ecalle-Voronin modulus, the modulus is defined up to a linear scaling\ndepending only on $\\eps$.\n  Here, we characterize the moduli space for such unfoldings by finding the\ncompatibility conditions on the modulus which are necessary and sufficient for\nrealization as the modulus of an unfolding.\n  The compatibility condition is obtained by considering the region of\nsectorial overlap in $\\eps$-space. This lies in the Glutsyuk sector where the\ntwo fixed points are hyperbolic and connected by the orbits of the\ndiffeomorphism. In this region we have two representatives of the modulus which\ndescribe the same dynamics. We identify the necessary compatibility condition\nbetween these two representatives by comparing them both with their common\nGlutsyuk modulus.\n  The compatibility condition implies the existence of a linear scaling for\nwhich the modulus is 1/2-summable in $\\eps$, whose direction of non-summability\ncoincides with the direction of real multipliers at the fixed points.\nConversely, we show that the compatibility condition (which implies the\nsummability property) is sufficient to realize the modulus as coming from an\nanalytic unfolding, thus giving a complete description of the space of moduli.\n","Comment: 48 pages"]}]

This method, which yields results\npractically equivalent to the Generalized Mean Spherical Approximation and\nincludes thermodynamic consistency, is an alternative to the usual integral\nequation approaches and requires as input only the contact values of the radial\ndistribution functions and the isothermal compressibility.

An announcement of these\nresults in the case of surfaces without boundary -- where the role of tube type\ndomains had already been emphasized -- appeared in 2003 by the same authors.\n  The congruence relations for the Toledo invariant involve a rotation number\nfunction related to a continuous homogeneous quasimorphism which gives an\nexplicit way to compute the Toledo invariant. This rotation number generalizes\nconstructions due to Ghys, Barge--Ghys, and Clerc--Koufany.\n  We establish moreover properties of boundary maps associated to maximal\nrepresentations which generalize naturally, for the causal structure of the\nShilov boundary, monotonicity properties of quasiconjugations of the circle.\nThis, together with the congruence relations leads to the result that the\nsubset of maximal representations is always real semialgebraic.\n","Comment: 56 pages, no figures.
