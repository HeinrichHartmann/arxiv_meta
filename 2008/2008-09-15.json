We examine six\nnearby star-forming galaxies to disentangle the role of the dust from other\nparameters such as gas kinematics, geometry and ISM morphology in the\nobscuration of Ly-alpha. Thereby we aim to understand the Ly-a escape physics\nand infer the implications for high-redshift studies.

In the case of a dense,\nstatic HI covering, we observe a damped absorption with a declining\nrelationship between Lya and E(B-V). We found that the Lya escape fraction does\nnot exceed 10% in all our galaxies and is mostly about 3% or below. Finally,\nbecause of the radiative transfer complexity of the Lya line, star formation\nrate based on Lya luminosity is underestimated with respect to that derived\nfrom UV luminosity. The failure of simple dust correction to recover the\nintrinsic Lya/Ha ratio or the total star formation rate should prompt us to be\nmore cautious when interpreting high-z observations and related properties,\nsuch as SFRs based on Lya alone.

SPICA is one of the few space missions selected\nto go to the next stage of ESA's Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 selection process. In\nthis White Paper we present the main specifications of the three instruments\ncurrently baselined for SPICA: a mid-infrared (MIR) coronagraph (~3.5 to ~27\num) with photometric and spectral capabilities (R~200), a MIR wide-field camera\nand high resolution spectrometer (R~30,000), and a far-infrared (FIR ~30 to\n~210 um) imaging spectrometer - SAFARI - led by a European consortium.

It will also\ndirectly detect and characterize Jupiter/Neptune-size planets orbiting at\nlarger separation from their parent star (>5-10 AU), by performing quantitative\natmospheric spectroscopy and studying proto-planetary and debris disks. In\naddition, SPICA will be a scientific and technological precursor for future,\nmore ambitious, IR space missions for exo-planet direct detection as it will,\nfor example, quantify the prevalence exo-zodiacal clouds in planetary systems\nand test coronographic techniques, cryogenic systems and lightweight, high\nquality telescopes.

The modulus is defined on a\nramified sector in the canonical perturbation parameter $\\eps$. As in the case\nof the Ecalle-Voronin modulus, the modulus is defined up to a linear scaling\ndepending only on $\\eps$.\n  Here, we characterize the moduli space for such unfoldings by finding the\ncompatibility conditions on the modulus which are necessary and sufficient for\nrealization as the modulus of an unfolding.\n  The compatibility condition is obtained by considering the region of\nsectorial overlap in $\\eps$-space. This lies in the Glutsyuk sector where the\ntwo fixed points are hyperbolic and connected by the orbits of the\ndiffeomorphism. In this region we have two representatives of the modulus which\ndescribe the same dynamics. We identify the necessary compatibility condition\nbetween these two representatives by comparing them both with their common\nGlutsyuk modulus.\n  The compatibility condition implies the existence of a linear scaling for\nwhich the modulus is 1/2-summable in $\\eps$, whose direction of non-summability\ncoincides with the direction of real multipliers at the fixed points.\nConversely, we show that the compatibility condition (which implies the\nsummability property) is sufficient to realize the modulus as coming from an\nanalytic unfolding, thus giving a complete description of the space of moduli.\n","Comment: 48 pages"]}]

The profiles of pressure, density, temperature and\nheat flux are seen to be quite sensitive to the value of the gravity\nacceleration $g$. If the gravity field and the heat flux are parallel ($g>0$),\nthe magnitudes of both the temperature gradient and the heat flux are smaller\nthan in the opposite case ($g<0$). When considering the actual heat flux\nrelative to the value predicted by the Fourier law, it is seen that, if $g>0$,\nthe ratio increases as the reduced local field strength increases, while the\nopposite happens if $g<0$.
