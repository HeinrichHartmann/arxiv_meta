Recent studies have shown that\nthe tunnelling conductance can be fit using a BCS-type density of states for a\nd-wave superconductor with a local quasiparticle scattering rate. The fit is\nmade with a scattering rate which varies linearly with energy and has a slope\nthat is positively correlated with the local value of the gap. We revisit a\nmodel of quasiparticle scattering by impurities and spin fluctuations which was\npreviously used to describe the lifetimes of nodal quasiparticles measured by\nangle-resolved photoemission (ARPES). We argue that the broadening of the local\ndensity of states is in general determined by the imaginary part of the\nself-energy of the system averaged over a small region. The size of this region\nis set by a mean free path which depends upon the energy. At low energies, this\nregion is found to be significantly larger than a gap \"patch\", so that the\ndensity of states measured by STS is homogeneous in this energy range. At\nhigher energies where the mean free path is comparable with the patch size, the\ndensity of states is inhomogeneous. We show that a local self-energy in the\nimpurity-plus-spin fluctuation model, while not strictly linear, yields a local\ndensity of states (LDOS) nearly identical to the full theory, and argue that it\nis consistent with the STS data as well as the phenomenological linear\nscattering rate extracted from experiment.

The electron and\nhole energy spectra are obtained by numerically solving the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation, both for a single-band Hamiltonian and for a non-symmetrical 6-band\nHamiltonian. The deformation potential and spin-orbit interaction are taken\ninto account. For increasing built-in field, generated by the piezoelectric\npolarization and by the spontaneous polarization, the energy of size\nquantization rises and the number of size quantized electron and hole levels in\na quantum well decreases. The exciton energy spectrum is obtained using\nelectron and hole wave functions and two-dimensional Coulomb wave functions as\na basis. We have calculated the exciton oscillator strengths and identified the\nexciton states active in optical absorption. For different values of the Al\ncontent x, a quantitative interpretation, in a good agreement with experiment,\nis provided for (i) the red shift of the zero-phonon photoluminescence peaks\nfor increasing the quantum-well width, (ii) the relative intensities of the\nzero-phonon and one-phonon photoluminescence peaks, found within the\nnon-adiabatic approach, and (iii) the values of the photoluminescence decay\ntime as a function of the quantum-well width.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 9 figures"]}]

We extend this method to show that, for\na large class of loop groups, a connection order $(_a^b)$ map, for $a<0<b$,\nsplits uniquely into a pair of $(_a^{-1})$ and $(_1^b)$ maps.
