In \\cite{DR2} we gave characterizations of\nmonomorphisms (resp. epimorphisms) in arbitrary pro-categories, pro-(C), where\n(C) has direct sums (resp. weak push-outs). In this paper we introduce the\nnotions of strong monomorphism and strong epimorphism. Part of their\nsignificance is that they are preserved by functors. These notions and their\ncharacterizations lead us to important classical properties and problems in\nshape and pro-homotopy. For instance, strong epimorphisms allow us to give a\ncategorical point of view of uniform movability and to introduce a new kind of\nmovability, the sequential movability. Strong monomorphisms are connected to a\nproblem of K.Borsuk regarding a descending chain of retracts of ANRs. If (f: X\n\\to Y) is a bimorphism in the pointed shape category of topological spaces, we\nprove that (f) is a weak isomorphism and (f) is an isomorphism provided (Y) is\nsequentially movable and $X$ or $Y$ is the suspension of a topological space.\nIf (f: X \\to Y) is a bimorphism in the pro-category pro-(H_0) (consisting of\ninverse systems in (H_0), the homotopy category of pointed connected CW\ncomplexes) we show that (f) is an isomorphism provided (Y) is sequentially\nmovable.\n","Comment: to appear in the Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra"]}]
