A treatment with a\nfocused ion beam allowed us to reduce the plasma frequency down to $f_p$$\\sim$5\nGHz at $T$=0.3 K in naturally stacked Josephson junctions in a crystal. We\nobserved Shapiro steps at frequencies as low as $\\sim$5 GHz. Well-developed\nzero-crossing Shapiro steps were observed at frequencies as low as $\\sim$10\nGHz. They appeared as constant-voltage plateaus with a non-zero voltage\noccurring at zero bias current. We confirmed that zero-crossing Shapiro steps\nin the Bi-2212 stacked junctions can be observed when the irradiated frequency\nis sufficiently larger than $f_p$. The observed high-order fractional steps in\nthe microwave responses indicate that the interlayer-coupled Bi-2212 Josephson\njunctions have nonsinusoidal current-phase relation.
