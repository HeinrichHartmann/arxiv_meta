Our calculations\nare based on density-functional theory for the description of the electronic\nstructure and on a Landauer-Buttiker approach for the current. The\ncurrent-carrying states correspond to the six conduction band minima of Si,\nwhich, when projected on the (001) surface Brillouin zone (SBZ), form five\nconductance hot spots: one at the SBZ center and four symmetric satellites. The\nsatellites yield a current polarization of about 50%, while the SBZ center can,\nunder very low gate voltage, yield up to almost 100%, showing a zero-gate\nanomaly. This extremely high polarization is traced back to the symmetry\nmismatch of the minority-spin Fe wavefunctions to the conduction band\nwavefunctions of Si at the SBZ center. The tunneling current is determined by\nthe complex band structure of Si in the [001] direction, which shows\nqualitative differences compared to that of direct-gap semiconductors.\nDepending on the Fermi level position and Schottky barrier thickness, the\ncomplex band structure can cause the contribution of the satellites to be\norders of magnitude higher or lower than the central contribution. Thus, by\nappropriate tuning of the interface properties, there is a possibility to cut\noff the satellite contribution and to reach high injection efficiency.

First, the activity in the auditory cortex is sparse, and firing rates\ncan be described by a lognormal distribution. Second, the distribution of\nnon-zero synaptic strengths between nearby cortical neurons can also be\ndescribed by a lognormal distribution. Here we use a simple model of cortical\nactivity to reconcile these observations. The model makes the experimentally\ntestable prediction that synaptic efficacies onto a given cortical neuron are\nstatistically correlated, i.e. it predicts that some neurons receive many more\nstrong connections than other neurons. We propose a simple Hebb-like learning\nrule which gives rise to both lognormal firing rates and synaptic efficacies.\nOur results represent a first step toward reconciling sparse activity and\nsparse connectivity in cortical networks.\n"]}]

Experiments have shown that there\nmay be serious problems operating rf in the required magnetic fields. The use\nof high pressure gas to avoid these problems is discussed, including possible\nloss problems from electron and ion production by the passage of an ionizing\nbeam. It is also noted that high pressure gas cannot be used in later stages of\ncooling for a muon collider. Experimental observations using vacuum rf cavities\nin magnetic fields are discussed, current published models of breakdown with\nand without magnetic fields are summarized, and some of their predictions\ncompared with observations.\n  A new theory of magnetic field dependent breakdown is presented. It is\nproposed that electrons emitted by field emission on asperities on one side of\na cavity are focused by the magnetic field to the other side where they melt\nthe cavity surface in small spots. Metal is then electrostatically drawn from\nthe molten spots, becomes vaporized and ionized by field emission from the\nremaining damage and cause breakdown. The theory is fitted to existing 805 MHz\ndata and predictions are made for performance at 201 MHz. The model predicts\nbreakdown gradients significantly below those specified for either the\nInternational Scoping Study (ISS) Neutrino Factory or a Muon Collider.\n  Possible solutions to these problems are discussed, including designs for\n`magnetically insulated rf' in which the cavity walls are designed to be\nparallel to a chosen magnetic field contour line and consequently damage from\nfield emission is suppressed. An experimental program to study these problems\nand their possible solution is outlined.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 21 figures, 2 tables"]}]

We examine\ncases where the dark matter follows a pure NFW profile and where an initial NFW\nhalo contracts adiabatically in response to the formation of the galaxy. We\nfind that both of these scenarios can produce a reasonable fit to the observed\nrotation curve data. However, a pure NFW model requires a concentration\nc_{vir}=51 that is well outside the range predicted in LCDM cosmology and is\ntherefore disfavoured. An adiabatically contracted NFW halo favors an initial\nconcentration c_{vir}=20 and virial mass 8.2x10^{11} M_{\\odot}, and this is in\nline with the cosmological expectations for a galaxy of the size of M31. The\nbest-fit mass is consistent with published estimates from Andromeda Stream\nkinematics, satellite galaxy radial velocities, and planetary nebulae studies.\nFinally, using the known linear correlation between rotation curve shear and\nspiral arm pitch angle, we show that the stellar spiral arm pitch angle of M31\n(which cannot be deduced from imaging data due to the galaxy's inclination) is\nP=24.7\\pm4.4 degrees.\n","Comment: 14 pages, now accepted for publication in MNRAS.
