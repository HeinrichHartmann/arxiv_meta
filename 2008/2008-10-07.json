The first\nattempt at CMB observations from the Plateau was an expedition to the South\nPole in December 1986 by the Radio Physics Research group at Bell Laboratories.\nSky noise and opacity were measured. The results were sufficiently encouraging\nthat in the Austral summer of 1988-1989, three CMB groups participated in the\n\"Cucumber\" campaign, where a temporary site dedicated to CMB anisotropy\nmeasurements was set up 2 km from South Pole Station. Winter-time observations\nbecame possible with the establishment in 1990 of the Center for Astrophysical\nResearch in Antarctica (CARA), a National Science Foundation Science and\nTechnology Center. CARA developed year-round observing facilities in the \"Dark\nSector\", a section of Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station dedicated to\nastronomical observations. CARA scientists fielded several astronomical\ninstruments: AST/RO, SPIREX, White Dish, Python, Viper, ACBAR, and DASI. By\n2001, data from CARA, together with BOOMERANG, a CMB experiment on a\nlong-duration balloon launched from McMurdo Station on the coast of Antarctica,\nshowed clear evidence that the overall geometry of the Universe is flat, as\nopposed to being positively or negatively curved. In 2002, the DASI group\nreported the detection of polarization in the CMB. These observations strongly\nsupport the concordance model of cosmology, where the dynamics of a flat\nUniverse are dominated by forces exerted by the Dark Energy and Dark Matter.\nThe South Pole Telescope (SPT) is a newly-operational 10 m diameter offset\ntelescope designed to rapidly measure anisotropies on scales much smaller than\n1 degree.\n","Comment: For publication in \"Smithsonian at the Poles\", proceedings of\n  Smithsonian IPY conference"]}]

Aims: The evolutionary status and GC origin of the\nHVS SDSS J113312.12+010824.9 (HVS7) is constrained from a detailed study of its\nstellar parameters and chemical composition. Methods: High-resolution spectra\nof HVS7 obtained with UVES on the ESO VLT were analysed using state-of-the-art\nNLTE/LTE modelling techniques that can account for a chemically-peculiar\ncomposition via opacity sampling. Results: Instead of the expected slight\nenrichments of alpha-elements and near-solar Fe, huge chemical peculiarities of\nall elements are apparent. The He abundance is very low (<1/100 solar), C, N\nand O are below the detection limit, i.e they are underabundant (<1/100, <1/3\nand <1/10 solar). Heavier elements, however, are overabundant: the iron group\nby a factor of ~10, P, Co and Cl by factors ~40, 80 and 440 and rare-earth\nelements and Hg even by ~10000. An additional finding, relevant also for other\nchemically peculiar stars are the large NLTE effects on abundances of TiII and\nFeII (~0.6-0.7dex). The derived abundance pattern of HVS7 is characteristic for\nthe class of chemical peculiar magnetic B stars on the main sequence. The\nchemical composition and high vsini=55+-2km/s render a low mass nature of HVS7\nas a blue horizontal branch star unlikely. Conclusions: Such a surface\nabundance pattern is caused by atomic diffusion in a possibly magnetically\nstabilised, non-convective atmosphere. Hence all chemical information on the\nstar's place of birth and its evolution has been washed out. High precision\nastrometry is the only means to validate a GC origin for HVS7.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 3 figures"]}]
