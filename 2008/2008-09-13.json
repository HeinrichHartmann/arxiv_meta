In previous papers and software, the\nasymptotic null distribution of likelihood ratio tests for detecting genetic\nlinkage in multivariate variance components models has been stated to be a\nmixture of chi-square distributions with binomial mixing probabilities. Here we\nshow, by simulation and by theoretical arguments based on the geometry of the\nparameter space, that all aspects of the previously stated asymptotic null\ndistribution are incorrect--both the binomial mixing probabilities and the\nchi-square components. Correcting the null distribution gives more conservative\ncritical values than previously stated, yielding P values that can easily be\nten times larger. The true mixing probabilities give the highest probability to\nthe case where all variance parameters are estimated positive, and the mixing\ncomponents show severe departures from chi-square distributions. Thus, the\nasymptotic null distribution has complex features that raise challenges for the\nassessment of significance of multivariate linkage findings.

A central question is how\nit is possible that so many initial configurations proceed to fold to a unique\nfinal configuration. We put energy and dynamical considerations temporarily\naside and focus upon the geometry alone. We parameterize the structure of an\nidealized protein using the concept of a ribbon from differential geometry. The\ndeformation of the ribbon is described by introducing a generic twisting\nAnsatz. The folding process in this picture entails a change in shape guided by\nthe local amino acid geometry. The theory is reparamaterization invariant from\nthe start, so the final shape is independent of folding time. We develop\ndifferential equations for the changing shape. For some parameter ranges, a\nsine-Gordon torsion soliton is found. This purely geometric waveform has\nproperties similar to dynamical solitons.
