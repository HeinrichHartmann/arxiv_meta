Based on Fisher's articles and books it is justified that by\nestimation Fisher meant the construction of likelihood intervals or regions\nfrom appropriate likelihood function and that an estimate is a statistic, that\nis, a function from a sample space to a parameter space such that the\nlikelihood function obtained from the sampling distribution of the statistic at\nthe observed value of the statistic is used to construct likelihood intervals\nor regions. Thus Problem of Estimation is how to choose the 'best' estimate.\nFisher's solution for the problem of estimation is Maximum Likelihood Estimate\n(MLE). Fisher's Theory of Statistical Estimation is a chain of ideas used to\njustify MLE as the solution of the problem of estimation. The construction of\nconfidence intervals by the delta method from the asymptotic normal\ndistribution of MLE is based on Fisher's ideas, but is against his 'logic of\nstatistical inference'. Instead the construction of confidence intervals from\nthe profile likelihood function of a given interest function of the parameter\nvector is considered as a solution more in line with Fisher's 'ideology'. A new\nmethod of calculation of profile likelihood-based confidence intervals for\ngeneral smooth interest functions in general statistical models is considered.\n","Comment: Submitted to the Electronic Journal of Statistics\n  (http://www.i-journals.org/ejs/) by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics\n  (http://www.imstat.org)"]}]
