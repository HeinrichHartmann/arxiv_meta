We prove that the second leading\ncoefficient of an Ehrhart quasi-polynomial always has maximal expected period\nand present a general theorem that yields maximal periods for the coefficients\nof certain quasi-polynomials. We present a construction for (Ehrhart)\nquasi-polynomials that exhibit maximal period behavior and use it to answer a\nquestion of Zaslavsky on convolutions of quasi-polynomials.\n","Comment: 7 pages, to appear in JCT-A"]}]

In this article, for\nany closed symplectic four manifold $N$ with $b+$ greater than 1, we show that\nthere is a Hamiltonian six manifold $M$ such that its fixed points set is the\ndisjoint union of two copies of $N$ and such that its Duistermaat-Heckman\nfunction is not log-concave.\n  On the other hand, we prove that if there is a torus action of complexity two\nsuch that all the symplectic reduced spaces taken at regular values satisfy the\ncondition $b+=1$, then its Duistermaat-Heckman function has to be log-concave.\nAs a consequence, we prove the log-concavity conjecture for Hamiltonian circle\nactions on six manifolds such that the fixed points sets have no four\ndimensional components, or only have four dimensional pieces with $b+=1$.\n","Comment: This is the version which is going to appear in Inter.

From that, the gravitational mass has a corresponding,\nassociated, equivalent frequency, f. Using that frequency a new result is\nobtained in which the significance of the Planck Length is clarified. The\nPlanck Length is fundamental to gravitation and in effect supercedes G in that\nrole because it is found that there is operational or mechanical significance\nto the role of the Planck Length in gravitation whereas G is simply a constant\nof proportionality. It further is shown that the Planck Length [and, likely the\nPlanck mass and the Planck time] are slightly mis-defined by the use of h-bar\n[h/2pi] rather than simply Planck's constant, h. Theoretical implications of\nthese results are presented. In addition, the applicability of using the\nfrequency aspect of mass in the analysis of gravitation, and the nature of the\nresults obtained, would appear to imply a considerably greater significance for\nthe frequency, that is the WAVE, aspect of mass, matter, and particles in\ngeneral than has been heretofore recognized.\n","Comment: 6 pages.
