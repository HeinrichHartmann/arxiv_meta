The definition is largely motivated by the\nstructures utilized in the Berlekamp-Massey-Sakata (BMS) decoding algorithm,\nwith Feng-Rao majority voting for unknown syndromes, applied to one-point\ngeometric Goppa codes constructed from curves. However, order domains are much\nmore general, and O'Sullivan has shown that the BMS algorithm can be applied to\ndecode all codes constructed from order domains by a suitable generalization of\nGoppa's procedure for curves. In this article we will first discuss the\nconnection between order domains and valuations on function fields over a\nfinite field. Under some mild conditions, we will see that a general projective\nvariety over a finite field has projective models which can be used to\nconstruct order domains and Goppa-type codes for which the BMS algorithm is\napplicable. We will then give a slightly different interpretation of Geil and\nPellikaan's extrinsic characterization of order domains via the theory of\nGr\\\"obner bases, and show that their results are related to the existence of\ntoric deformations of varieties. To illustrate the potential usefulness of\nthese observations, we present a series of new explicit examples of order\ndomains associated to varieties with many rational points over finite fields:\nHermitian hypersurfaces, Grassmannians, and flag varieties.\n","Comment: 21 pages; AMS-LaTeX.
