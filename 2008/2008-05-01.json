Thus,\nthe embedding map can target periodic orbits as well as chaotic structures in\nboth the aerosol and bubble regimes at certain values of the dissipation\nparameter. The bifurcation diagram of the 4-d map is useful for the\nidentification of regimes where such structures can be found. An attractor\nmerging and widening crisis is seen for a special region for the aerosols. At\nthe crisis, two period-10 attractors merge and widen simultaneously into a\nsingle chaotic attractor.

For a\nprecise characterization a high spatial resolution is mandatory. In particular,\nthe perspective to study quantum gases in optical lattices makes a resolution\nwell below one micrometer highly desirable. Here, we report on a novel\nmicroscopy technique which is based on scanning electron microscopy and allows\nfor the detection of single atoms inside a quantum gas with a spatial\nresolution of better than 150 nm. Imaging a Bose-Einstein condensate in a\none-dimensional optical lattice with 600 nm period we demonstrate single site\naddressability in a sub-um optical lattice. The technique offers exciting\npossibilities for the preparation, manipulation and analysis of quantum gases.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 5 figures"]}]

The Born\nprobabilities emerge as the relative frequencies of outcomes in long runs of\nmeasurements on a quantum system; it is not necessary to adopt the frequency\ninterpretation of single-case probabilities (which will be the subject of a\nsequel paper).
