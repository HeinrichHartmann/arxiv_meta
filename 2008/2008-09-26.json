In the majority of studies on CSMA wireless networks, a\ncontention graph is used to model the carrier sensing relationships (CS) among\nlinks. This is a 0-1 model in which two links can either sense each other\ncompletely or not. In real experiments, we observed that this is generally not\nthe case: the CS relationship between the links are often probabilistic and can\nvary dynamically over time. This is the case even if the distance between the\nlinks is fixed and there is no drastic change in the environment. Furthermore,\nthis partial carrier sensing relationship is prevalent and occurs over a wide\nrange of distances between the links. This observation is not consistent with\nthe 0-1 contention graph and implies that many results and conclusions drawn\nfrom previous theoretical studies need to be re-examined.
