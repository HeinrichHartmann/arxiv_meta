The disk torque\ndistribution per unit disk mass as a function of radius provides an important\ndiagnostic for the nature of the disk-planet interactions. We first consider\ntorque distributions for nonmigrating planets of fixed mass and show that there\nis general agreement with the expectations of resonance theory. We then present\nresults of simulations for mass-gaining, migrating planets. For planets with an\ninitial mass of 5 Earth masses, which are embedded in disks with standard\nparameters and which undergo run-away gas accretion to one Jupiter mass (Mjup),\nthe torque distributions per unit disk mass are largely unaffected by migration\nand accretion for a given planet mass. The migration rates for these planets\nare in agreement with the predictions of the standard theory for planet\nmigration (Type I and Type II migration). The planet mass growth occurs through\ngas capture within the planet's Bondi radius at lower planet masses, the Hill\nradius at intermediate planet masses, and through reduced accretion at higher\nplanet masses due to gap formation. During run-away mass growth, a planet\nmigrates inwards by only about 20% in radius before achieving a mass of ~1\nMjup. For the above models, we find no evidence of fast migration driven by\ncoorbital torques, known as Type III migration. We do find evidence of Type III\nmigration for a fixed mass planet of Saturn's mass that is immersed in a cold\nand massive disk. In this case the planet migration is assumed to begin before\ngap formation completes. The migration is understood through a model in which\nthe torque is due to an asymmetry in density between trapped gas on the leading\nside of the planet and ambient gas on the trailing side of the planet.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 29 figures.

Although the\nintrinsic stochasticity inherent in biochemistry is relatively well understood,\ncellular variation, or 'noise', is predominantly generated by interactions of\nthe system of interest with other stochastic systems in the cell or its\nenvironment. Such extrinsic fluctuations are nonspecific, affecting many system\ncomponents, and have a substantial lifetime, comparable to the cell cycle (they\nare 'colored'). Here, we extend the standard stochastic simulation algorithm to\ninclude extrinsic fluctuations. We show that these fluctuations affect mean\nprotein numbers and intrinsic noise, can speed up typical network response\ntimes, and can explain trends in high-throughput measurements of variation. If\nextrinsic fluctuations in two components of the network are correlated, they\nmay combine constructively (amplifying each other) or destructively\n(attenuating each other). Consequently, we predict that incoherent feedforward\nloops attenuate stochasticity, while coherent feedforwards amplify it. Our\nresults demonstrate that both the timescales of extrinsic fluctuations and\ntheir nonspecificity substantially affect the function and performance of\nbiochemical networks.\n","Comment: 16 pages and 5 figures"]}]
