In\nnon-relativistic quantum mechanics, these are independent, resulting in large\ndegeneracies in atomic spectra. However, relativistic effects couple the spin\nand orbital motion leading to the well-known fine structure in their spectra.\nThe electronic states in defect-free carbon nanotubes (NTs) are widely believed\nto be four-fold degenerate, due to independent spin and orbital symmetries, and\nto also possess electron-hole symmetry. Here we report measurements\ndemonstrating that in clean NTs the spin and orbital motion of electrons are\ncoupled, thereby breaking all of these symmetries. This spin-orbit coupling is\ndirectly observed as a splitting of the four-fold degeneracy of a single\nelectron in ultra-clean quantum dots. The coupling favours parallel alignment\nof the orbital and spin magnetic moments for electrons and anti-parallel\nalignment for holes. Our measurements are consistent with recent theories that\npredict the existence of spin-orbit coupling in curved graphene and describe it\nas a spin-dependent topological phase in NTs.

We\nbegin with a comprehensive review of the integrability of the gauge theory\nspin-chain and that of the string sigma model. In the light of the AdS/CFT\nduality, they should be just two ways of describing the same underlying\nintegrability, and it is believed that the unified integrability can be\ncharacterised by a set of Bethe ansatz equations which is valid for all values\nof the 't Hooft coupling. By studying the asymptotic spectrum of the AdS/CFT in\nthe infinite spin/R-charge limit, we first identify the corresponding solitonic\ncounterparts in the context of the AdS/CFT, which are the so-called dyonic\ngiant magnons and the SYM magnon boundstates. Then we show that the S-matrix\ncomputed directly from the string solitons scattering precisely reproduces the\nprediction from the conjecture. We further perform an analyticity test by\nstudying the singularities of the conjectured magnon boundstate S-matrix and\nchecking the physicality conditions. These tests give strong positive supports\nfor the integrability of large-N AdS/CFT as well as the specific form of the\nconjectured Bethe ansatz equations.
