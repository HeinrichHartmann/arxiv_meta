Our purpose\nis to obtain explicit bond and equity option pricing formulas that can be\ncalibrated to find a risk neutral model that matches a set of observed market\nprices. This risk neutral model can then be used to price more exotic, illiquid\nor over-the-counter derivatives. We observe that the model implied credit\ndefault swap (CDS) spread matches the market CDS spread and that our model\nproduces a very desirable CDS spread term structure. This is observation is\nworth noticing since without calibrating any parameter to the CDS spread data,\nit is matched by the CDS spread that our model generates using the available\ninformation from the equity options and corporate bond markets. We also observe\nthat our model matches the equity option implied volatility surface well since\nwe properly account for the default risk premium in the implied volatility\nsurface. We demonstrate the importance of accounting for the default risk and\nstochastic interest rate in equity option pricing by comparing our results to\nFouque, Papanicolaou, Sircar and Solna (2003), which only accounts for\nstochastic volatility.\n","Comment: Keywords: Credit Default Swap, Defaultable Bond, Defaultable Stock,\n  Equity Options, Stochastic Interest Rate, Implied Volatility, Multiscale\n  Perturbation Method"]}]
