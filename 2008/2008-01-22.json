These profiles are starting to be used as markers to improve prognosis\nor diagnosis of cancer, which implies that methods for automated supervised\nclassification of arrayCGH data are needed. Like gene expression profiles,\narrayCGH profiles are characterized by a large number of variables usually\nmeasured on a limited number of samples. However, arrayCGH profiles have a\nparticular structure of correlations between variables, due to the spatial\norganization of BACs along the genome. This suggests that classical\nclassification methods, often based on the selection of a small number of\ndiscriminative features, may not be the most accurate methods and may not\nproduce easily interpretable prediction rules.\n  Results: We propose a new method for supervised classification of arrayCGH\ndata. The method is a variant of support vector machine (SVM) that incorporates\nthe biological specificities of DNA copy number variations along the genome as\nprior knowledge. The resulting classifier is a sparse linear classifier based\non a limited number of regions automatically selected on the chromosomes,\nleading to easy interpretation and identification of discriminative regions of\nthe genome. We test this method on three classification problems for bladder\nand uveal cancer, involving both diagnosis and prognosis. We demonstrate that\nthe introduction of the new prior on the classifier leads not only to more\naccurate predictions, but also to the identification of known and new regions\nof interest in the genome.\n  Availability: All data and algorithms are publicly available.\n"]}]

These properties of planetary systems have been identified\nthrough calculation of two parameters that describe the interaction.

From this form a\nLagrangian is built, and equations of motion, boundary conditions and\nassociated Noether currents are derived. A subspace separation method, based on\nthe extended Cartan homotopy formula, is proposed, which allows to (i) split\nthe Lagrangian in 'bulk' and 'boundary' contributions and (ii) separate the\nbulk term in sublagrangians corresponding to the subspaces of the gauge\nalgebra.\n  Use is made of Abelian semigroups to develop an expansion method for Lie\n(super)algebras, based on the work by de Azcarraga, Izquierdo, Picon and\nVarela. The main idea consists in considering the direct product between an\nAbelian semigroup S and a Lie (super)algebra g. General conditions under which\nsmaller algebras can be extracted from S \\otimes g are given. It is shown how\nto recover the known expansion cases in this new context. Several d=11\nsuperalgebras are obtained as examples of the application of the method.\nGeneral theorems that allow to find an invariant tensor for the expanded\nalgebra from an invariant tensor for the original algebra are formulated.\n  Finally, a d=11 gauge theory for the M Algebra is considered by using the\nideas developed in the Thesis. The dynamical properties of this theory are\nbriefly analyzed.\n","Comment: Ph.D. Thesis, Universidad de Concepci\\'on, Chile (2006). 153 pages, 6\n  figures, in Spanish"]}]

Recently this notion has led to a more general\nnotion of quantum error correction known as operator quantum error correction.\nIn standard quantum error correcting codes, one requires the ability to apply a\nprocedure which exactly reverses on the error correcting subspace any\ncorrectable error. In contrast, for operator error correcting subsystems, the\ncorrection procedure need not undo the error which has occurred, but instead\none must perform correction only modulo the subsystem structure. This does not\nlead to codes which differ from subspace codes, but does lead to recovery\nroutines which explicitly make use of the subsystem structure. Here we present\ntwo examples of such operator error correcting subsystems. These examples are\nmotivated by simple spatially local Hamiltonians on square and cubic lattices.\nIn three dimensions we provide evidence, in the form a simple mean field\ntheory, that our Hamiltonian gives rise to a system which is self-correcting.\nSuch a system will be a natural high-temperature quantum memory, robust to\nnoise without external intervening quantum error correction procedures.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 3 figures, typos fixed, references added"]}]

For any pair of states (pure or mixed) on the\nHilbert space of the system, we explicitly show how to construct a Kraus map\nthat transforms one state into another. Moreover, we prove by construction the\nexistence of a Kraus map that transforms all initial states into a predefined\ntarget state (such a process may be used, for example, in quantum information\ndilution). Thus, in sharp contrast to unitary control, Kraus-map dynamics\nallows for the design of controls which are robust to variations in the initial\nstate of the system. The general formalism is illustrated with examples of\nstate-to-state Kraus transformations in a two-level system. In particular, we\nconstruct a family of non-unitary Kraus maps, which transform one pure state\ninto another. The problem of dynamic state controllability of open quantum\nsystems (i.e., controllability of state-to-state transformations, given a set\nof available dynamical resources such as coherent controls, incoherent\ninteractions with the environment, and measurements) is also discussed.\n","Comment: 16 pages"]}]
