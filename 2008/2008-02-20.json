The model is a pure Z_2 gauge theory in which randomly\nchosen plaquettes (occuring with concentration p) have couplings with the\n``wrong sign'' so that magnetic flux is energetically favored on these\nplaquettes. Excitations of the model are one-dimensional ``flux tubes'' that\nterminate at ``magnetic monopoles.'' Electric confinement can be driven by\nthermal fluctuations of the flux tubes, by the quenched background of magnetic\nmonopoles, or by a combination of the two. Like the RBIM, the RPGM has enhanced\nsymmetry along a ``Nishimori line'' in the p-T plane (where T is the\ntemperature). The critical concentration p_c of wrong-sign plaquettes at the\nconfinement-Higgs phase transition along the Nishimori line can be identified\nwith the accuracy threshold for robust storage of quantum information using\ntopological error-correcting codes: if qubit phase errors, qubit bit-flip\nerrors, and errors in the measurement of local check operators all occur at\nrates below p_c, then encoded quantum information can be protected perfectly\nfrom damage in the limit of a large code block. Numerically, we measure p_{c0},\nthe critical concentration along the T=0 axis (a lower bound on p_c), finding\np_{c0}=.0293 +/- .0002.
