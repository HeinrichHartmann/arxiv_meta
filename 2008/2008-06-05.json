We write down the full\nnon-linear equations that relate the primordial perturbation to the curvaton\nperturbations on large scales, and solve them in a sudden-decay approximation.\nWe calculate the power spectrum of the primordial perturbation, and finally go\nto second order to find the non-linearity parameter, fNL.\n  Not surprisingly, we find large positive values of fNL if the energy\ndensities of the curvatons are sub-dominant when they decay, as in the single\ncurvaton case. But we also find a novel effect, which can be present only in\nmulti-curvaton models: fNL becomes large even if the curvatons dominate the\ntotal energy density in the case when the inhomogeneous radiation produced by\nthe first curvaton decay is diluted by the decay of a second nearly homogeneous\ncurvaton. The minimum value min(fNL)=-5/4 which we find is the same as in the\nsingle-curvaton case.\n  Using (non-)Gaussianity observations, Planck can be able to distinguish\nbetween single-field inflation and curvaton model. Hence it is important to\nderive theoretical predictions for curvaton model.

In this protocol, our bounds are tight and a multiple-access channel\ntransmission from the two users to the relay followed by a coded broadcast-type\ntransmission from the relay to the users achieves all points in the two-phase\ncapacity region.\n  The second protocol considers sequential transmissions from the two users\nfollowed by a transmission from the relay while the third protocol is a hybrid\nof the first two protocols and has four phases. In the latter two protocols the\ninner and outer bounds are not identical, and differ in a manner similar to the\ninner and outer bounds of Cover's relay channel. Numerical evaluation shows\nthat at least in some cases of interest our bounds do not differ significantly.\n  Finally, in the Gaussian case with path loss, we derive achievable rates and\ncompare the relative merits of each protocol in various regimes.
