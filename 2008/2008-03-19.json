Another important\nquestion is what keeps them inside the hadron, which is known to have\nspace-time extension.

The hadron moving with speed\nclose to that of light appears as a collection of Feynman's partons. In other\nwords, the same object looks differently to observers in two different frames,\nas Einstein's energy-momentum relation takes different forms for those\nobservers. In order to explain this, it is necessary to construct a quantum\nbound-state picture valid in all Lorentz frames. It is noted that Paul A.

The new\naspect of this presentation is the description of range of the validity of this\nFundamental Identity of Gabor Analysis using Wiener amalgam spaces and\nFeichtinger's algebra $S_0(\\R^d)$. Our approach is inspired by Rieffel's use of\nthe Fundamental Identity of Gabor Analysis in the study of operator algebras\ngenerated by time-frequency shifts along a lattice, which was later\nindependently rediscovered by Tolmieri/Orr, Janssen, and Daubechies et al., and\nFeichtinger/Kozek at various levels of generality, in the context of Gabor\nanalysis.\n","Comment: Some typos are fixed"]}]
