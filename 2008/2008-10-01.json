By analyzing the resulting secrecy capacity we quantify the loss\nof the secrecy capacity due to the correlation.

A simple mean-field description predicts a critical diffusivity if\nthe hopping amplitude vanishes for a certain walker density. Actually, we\nevidence that, even if the density equals this pseudo-critical value, the\nsystem does not present any criticality but only a dynamical slowing down. This\nproperty is confirmed by the fact that, in spite of interaction, the particle\ndistribution at equilibrium is simply described in terms of a product of\nPoissonians. For mesoscopic systems with a stationary flux, a very effect of\ninteraction among particles consists in the amplification of fluctuations,\nwhich is especially relevant close to the pseudo-critical density.

Our work uses the results of refinement\ncalculus to express valid refinement patterns and their properties.\nIntuitively, a low-level security policy is compliant to a high-level security\npolicy if there is a valid refinement path from the high-level security policy\nto the low-level security policy.
