Labeled Cortical Distance Map (LCDM), can be a powerful tool to\nquantize such morphometric differences. In this article, we investigate various\nissues regarding the analysis of LCDM distances in relation to morphometry. The\nlength of the LCDM distance vector provides the number of voxels (approximately\na multiple of volume (in mm^3)); median, mode, range, and variance of LCDM\ndistances are all suggestive of size, thickness, and shape differences. However\nthese measures provide a crude summary based on LCDM distances which may convey\nmuch more information about the tissue in question. To utilize more of this\ninformation, we pool (merge) the LCDM distances from subjects in the same group\nor condition. The statistical methodology we employ require normality and\nwithin and between sample independence. We demonstrate that the violation of\nthese assumptions have mild influence on the tests. We specify the types of\nalternatives the parametric and nonparametric tests are more sensitive for. We\nalso show that the pooled LCDM distances provide powerful results for group\ndifferences in distribution, left-right morphometric asymmetry of the tissues,\nand variation of LCDM distances. As an illustrative example, we use gray matter\n(GM) tissue of ventral medial prefrontal cortices (VMPFCs) from subjects with\nmajor depressive disorder, subjects at high risk, and control subjects.

Potent\nImmunoglobulins are discovered in this model via clonal selection and affinity\nmaturation. Possible outcomes of an infection (extinction of cells, survival\nwith complete elimination of viruses, or persistent infection) crucially depend\non mutation rates of viral and Immunoglobulin proteins. The model predicts that\nthere is an optimal Somatic Hypermutation (SHM) rate close to experimentally\nobserved 10-3 per nucleotide per replication. Further, we developed an\nanalytical theory which explains the physical reason for an optimal SHM program\nas a compromise between deleterious effects of random mutations on nascent\nmaturing Immunoglobulins (adversity) and the need to generate diverse pool of\nmutated antibodies from which highly potent ones can be drawn (diversity). The\ntheory explains such effects as dependence of B cell fate on affinity for an\nincoming antigen, ceiling in affinity of mature antibodies, Germinal Center\nsizes and maturation times. The theory reveals the molecular factors which\ndetermine the efficiency of affinity maturation, providing insight into\nvariability of immune response to cytopathic (direct response by germline\nantibodies) and poorly cytopathic viruses (crucial role of SHM in response).\nThese results demonstrate the feasibility and promise of microscopic\nsequence-based models of immune system, where population dynamics of evolving\nImmunoglobulins is explicitly tied to their molecular properties.\n"]}]

The\nirregularity caused by the use of pointers and indirection arrays are a major\nchallenge for optimizing compilers. Codes containing such patterns are\nnotoriously hard to optimize but they have a huge impact on the performance of\nmodern architectures, which are under-utilized when encountering irregular\nmemory accesses. In this paper, a set of benchmarks is described that\nexplicitly measures the performance of kernels containing a variety of\ndifferent access patterns found in real world applications. By offering a\nvarying degree of complexity, we provide a platform for measuring the\neffectiveness of transformations. The difference in complexity stems from a\ndifference in traversal patterns, the use of multiple indirections and control\nflow statements. The kernels used cover a variety of different access patterns,\nnamely pointer traversals, indirection arrays, dynamic loop bounds and run-time\ndependent if-conditions. The kernels are small enough to be fully understood\nwhich makes this benchmark set very suitable for the evaluation of\nrestructuring transformations.\n"]}]

We use results by Toth and\nSchmidt-Conze to prove recurrence for a large class of such processes,\nincluding all \"invertible\" walks in elliptic random environments. Furthermore,\nrewriting our Newtonian walks as ordinary random walks in a suitable graph, we\ngain a better idea of the geometric features of the problem, and obtain further\nexamples of recurrence.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 7 figures"]}]
