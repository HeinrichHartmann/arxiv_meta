Our approach starts with the\nfollowing version of the classical Baumslag-Solitar relations $u t = t^2 u$\nwhere $t$ is a unitary operator in a Hilbert space $\\mathcal H$ and $u$ is an\nisometry in $\\mathcal H$. There are isometric dilations of this system into a\nbigger Hilbert space, relevant for wavelets. For a variety of carefully\nselected dilations, the ``bigger'' Hilbert space may be $L^2(\\br)$, and the\ndilated operators may be the unitary operators which define a dyadic wavelet\nmultiresolutions of $L^2(\\br)$ with the subspace $\\mathcal H$ serving as the\ncorresponding resolution subspace. That is, the initialized resolution which is\ngenerated by the wavelet scaling function(s). In the dilated Hilbert space, the\nBaumslag-Solitar relations then take the more familiar form $u t u^{-1} = t^2$.\n  We offer an operator theoretic framework including the standard construction;\nand we show how the representations of certain discrete semidirect group\nproducts serve to classify the possibilities.

The power\nspectrum of their amplitudes displays a frequency-power law leading to the\nobservation of a magnetic wave turbulence regime which is experimentally shown\nto involve a 4-wave interaction process. The existence of the regimes of\ngravity, magnetic and capillary wave turbulence is reported in the phase space\nparameters as well as a triple point of coexistence of these three regimes.\nMost of these features are understood using dimensional analysis or the\ndispersion relation of the ferrohydrodynamics surface waves.\n"]}]
