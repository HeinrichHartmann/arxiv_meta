Moreover, we give a polynomial estimate of this ratio. Our proof is\nbased on doubling property. As a matter of fact, the result remains true in a\nwide class of doubling metric measured spaces including manifolds and graphs.\nAs an application, we obtain a balls averages L^p-pointwise ergodic theorem for\nprobability G-spaces, with G of polynomial growth and for all p greater than 1.\n","Comment: 20 pages"]}]
