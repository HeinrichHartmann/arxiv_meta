The global signature depends on the choice of the initial\npoint and does not allow us to compare fragments of curves, and is therefore\nsensitive to occlusions. The local signature, although is slightly more\nsensitive to noise, is independent of the choice of the initial point and is\nnot sensitive to occlusions in an image.

These\nobjects are extremely luminous at rest-frame near and mid-IR (nu L_nu(5um) ~\n10^{38}-10^{39} W), consistent with accretion near the Eddington limit and\nfurther implying that they host buried QSOs. The majority of the IRAC detected\nOIRSs have flat 3.6 to 24um SEDs, implying comparable emission from stellar\nphotospheres and hot AGN illuminated dust. This may reflect relatively small\namounts of dust close to the central engine or current low mass accretion\nrates. A small subset of OIRSs appear to be starburst dominated with\nphotometric redshifts from 1.0 to 4.5. The OIMSs and OIRSs with significant\nstarburst components have similar L_K and stellar masses (M* ~ 10^{11} M_solar)\nassuming minimal AGN contribution. Roughly half of the OIRSs are not detected\nby Spitzer's IRAC or MIPS. These are most likely z > 2 radio galaxies. The IRAC\ndetected OIRSs are more likely than OIMSs to appear non point-like in the 3.6um\nand 4.5um images, suggesting that interactions play a role in triggering their\nactivity.
