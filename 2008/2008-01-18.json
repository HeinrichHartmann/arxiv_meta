We\ncharacterize the finite block length DMT and give new explicit code\nconstructions. The finite block length analysis illuminates a few key aspects\nthat have been neglected in the previous literature: 1) we show that one\ndominating cause of degradation with respect to the infinite block length\nregime is the event of decoding error at the relay; 2) we explicitly take into\naccount the fact that the destination does not generally know a priori the\nrelay decision time at which the relay switches from listening to transmit\nmode. Both the above problems can be tackled by a careful design of the\ndecoding algorithm. In particular, we introduce a decision rejection criterion\nat the relay based on Forney's decision rule (a variant of the Neyman-Pearson\nrule), such that the relay triggers transmission only when its decision is\nreliable.

Recent technological developments provide many possible\nrealizations of effectively one-dimensional systems. These devices promise to\ngive us access to a new range of phenomena. It is therefore very interesting to\ndevelop theoretical methods specific for such systems to model their behavior\nand calculate the correlators of the resulting theory. Incidentally, one such\nmethod exists and is known as Bosonization. It can be applied to\none-dimensional systems and effectively describes low energy excitations in a\nuniversal way. We use the example of a correlator known as the Emptiness\nFormation Probability to show that Bosonization fails to describe some long\nrange correlators corresponding to large disturbances (the EFP measures the\nprobability for the ground state of the system to develop a region without\nparticles). We trace this failure to the fact that Bosonization is constructed\nas a linear approximation of the full theory and we set up to develop a\ncollective description with the required non-linearity. The resulting scheme is\nessentially a Hydrodynamic paradigm for quantum systems. We show how to\nconstruct such a hydrodynamic description for a variety of exactly integrable\nmodels and illustrate how it can be used to make new predictions. For the\nspecial case of the spin-1/2 XY model we take advantage of the structure of the\nmodel to express the EFP as a determinant of a very special type of matrix,\nknown as Toeplitz Matrix. We use the theory of Toeplitz determinants to\ncalculate the asymptotic behavior of the EFP in the XY model and discuss its\nrelation with the criticality of the theory.\n","Comment: Ph.D. Graduation Thesis, University of Stony Brook, New York (U.S.A)\n  211 Pages, 21 Figures, 1 Table"]}]
