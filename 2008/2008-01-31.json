If the spin noncollinearity is high, then the DE mode\ndispersion assumes a curve with the backward character.

A way to do this is examined in this study. A bare\nmagnetic dipole containing a flux quantum spins stably, and produces an inverse\nsquare E= -vxB electric field similar to what one finds from charge. Gauss' law\nfinds charge in this model, though there be none. For stability, a current loop\nabout the waist of the magnetic dipole is needed and we must go beyond the\nclassical Maxwell's equations to find it. A spinning E field is equivalent to\nan electric displacement current. The sideways motion of the spinning E (of\nconstant magnitude) creates a little-recognized transverse electric\ndisplacement current about the waist. This differs from Maxwell's electric\ndisplacement current, in which E increases in magnitude. The sideways motion of\nE supports the dipolar B field, B=vxE/c^2. Beyond the very core of the magnetic\ndipole, each of these two velocities is essentially c and vxE/c^2 =\nvx(-vxB)/c^2 = B, the spinning E field wholly sourcing the dipolar B field. The\nanisotropy of the vxB field is cured by precession about an inclined axis.\nChoosing a Bohr magneton for the magnetic dipole and assuming it spins at the\nCompton frequency, Gauss' law finds Q = e. The vxB field, normally thought to\nbe solenoidal, becomes instead a conservative field in this model. Charge is\nrecognized as merely a mathematical construct, not fundamental but nevertheless\nuseful.
