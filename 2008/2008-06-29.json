As a\ncorollary, it follows that in the fractional case the autonomous Hamiltonian\ndoes not define anymore a conservation law. Instead, it is proved that the\nfractional conservation law adds to the Hamiltonian a new term which depends on\nthe fractional-order of differentiation, the generalized momentum, and the\nfractional derivative of the state variable.\n","Comment: The original publication is available at http://www.springerlink.com\n  Nonlinear Dynamics"]}]

A late-time evolution\nof magnetic reconnection in relativistic pair plasmas is demonstrated by\nparticle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. In the outflow regions, powerful\nreconnection jet piles up the magnetic fields and then a tangential\ndiscontinuity appears there. Further downstream, it is found that the\ntwo-dimensional extension of the relativistic Weibel instability generates\nelectro-magnetic fields, which are comparable to the anti-parallel or piled-up\nfields. In a microscopic viewpoint, the instability allows plasma's multiple\ninteractions with the discontinuity. In a macroscopic viewpoint, the\ninstability leads to rapid expansion of the current sheet and then the\nreconnection jet front further propagates into the downstream. Possible\napplication to the three-dimensional case is briefly discussed.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 9 figures; References and typos are fixed"]}]

In the\nfirst half of the work we study a system of a single level coupled to a\none-dimensional wire with interacting spinless electrons, when the wire is\neither clean or disordered. We utilize the density-matrix renormalization-group\n(DMRG) method to investigate the influence of the level on several\nthermodynamic properties of the clean interacting wire, which can be in one of\ntwo phases: Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid and charge density wave phases. When the\nwire is disordered, we investigate the Friedel oscillations, exploring the\ndifference between the two phases and comparing them to the clean\nnon-interacting case, for which we develop an exact formula for the\noscillations. In the second half of the dissertation we study two cases of an\nisolated two-dimensional QD. We begin by an investigation of a new numerical\nmethod, the particle-hole DMRG (PH-DMRG), which is used to calculate the GS\nenergy of a disordered QD consisting of interacting spinless electrons. We show\nthat this method is much more accurate than the Hartree-Fock method, and we\nsuggest an improvement of the algorithm, which reduces the error rate by almost\n30 percents. Finally we study the magnetization of a QD with spin 1/2\nelectrons, in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and interactions. We\ncalculate the g-factor and the expectation values of the spin operators in the\nGS, and find that when the QD is occupied by an even number of electrons, the\nGS can have a finite magnetization.\n","Comment: PhD dissertation, Bar-Ilan university, Israel, 2007 (177 pages)"]}]

They are so unusual that the traditional Landau\nparadigm of quasiparticles does not apply. It is widely believed that utterly\nnew concepts are required to describe the underlying physics. There is a\nfundamental question: how many concepts do we need to describe the above\nphysical mechanisms? This cannot be answered on purely experimental or\ntheoretical grounds. Rather, we have to use both of them. Recently, in HTSC,\nthe new and exciting measurements have been performed, demonstrating a puzzling\nmagnetic field induced transition from non-Fermi liquid to Landau Fermi liquid\nbehavior. We show, that in spite of very different microscopic nature of HTSC\nand HF metals, the behavior of HTSC is similar to that observed in HF\ncompounds.
