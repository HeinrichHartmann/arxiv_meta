Suppose the cost\nof a link of length $\\ell$ and capacity $c$ scales as $\\ell c^\\beta$ for fixed\n$0<\\beta<1$. Under appropriate standardization, the cost of the minimum cost\nGilbert network grows essentially as $n^{\\alpha(\\beta)}$, where $\\alpha(\\beta)\n= 1 - \\frac{\\beta}{2}$ on $0 < \\beta \\leq {1/2}$ and $\\alpha(\\beta) = {1/2} +\n\\frac{\\beta}{2}$ on ${1/2} \\leq \\beta < 1$. This quantity is an upper bound in\nthe worst case (of vertex positions), and a lower bound under mild regularity\nassumptions. Essentially the same bounds hold if we constrain the network to be\nefficient in the sense that average route-length is only $1 + o(1)$ times\naverage straight line length. The transition at $\\beta = {1/2}$ corresponds to\nthe dominant cost contribution changing from short links to long links. The\nupper bounds arise in the following type of hierarchical networks, which are\ntherefore optimal in an order of magnitude sense. On the large scale, use a\nsparse Poisson line process to provide long-range links. On the medium scale,\nuse hierachical routing on the square lattice. On the small scale, link\nvertices directly to medium-grid points. We discuss one of many possible\nvariant models, in which links also have a designed maximum speed $s$ and the\ncost becomes $\\ell c^\\beta s^\\gamma$.\n","Comment: 13 pages"]}]

Opt. Soc. Am., 1938, v.28, 215) concludes that the\nspectral emission of a moving atom exhibits always a redshift which informs not\nthe direction of the atom's motion. The conclusion is also evident from a\nsimple energy relation: atomic spectral radiation is emitted as an orbiting\nelectron consumes a portion of its internal energy on transiting to a\nlower-energy state which however has in a moving atom an additional energy\ngain; this results in a redshift in the emission frequency. Based on auxiliary\nexperimental information and a scheme for de Broglie particle formation, we\ngive a vigorous elucidation of the mechanism for deceleration radiation of\natomic electron; the corresponding prediction of the redshift is in complete\nagreement with the Ives and Stilwell's experimental formula.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 2 figures"]}]

As a consequence these states can withstand an\narbitrary amount of white noise before they admit a description within a local\nhidden variable model. This is in sharp contrast with the bipartite case, where\nall violations are bounded by Grothendieck's constant. We will discuss the\npossibility of determining the Hilbert space dimension from the obtained\nviolation and comment on implications for communication complexity theory.\nMoreover, we show that the violation obtained from generalized GHZ states is\nalways bounded so that, in contrast to many other contexts, GHZ states do in\nthis case not lead to extremal quantum correlations. The results are based on\ntools from the theories of operator spaces and tensor norms which we exploit to\nprove the existence of bounded but not completely bounded trilinear forms from\ncommutative C*-algebras.\n","Comment: Substantial changes in the presentation to make the paper more\n  accessible for a non-specialized reader"]}]
