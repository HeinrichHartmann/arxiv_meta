In 1996, Diaconis surveyed this\nphenomenon, and asked how one could recognize its occurrence in families of\nfinite ergodic Markov chains. In 2004, the third author noted that a necessary\ncondition for cutoff in a family of reversible chains is that the product of\nthe mixing-time and spectral-gap tends to infinity, and conjectured that in\nmany settings, this condition should also be sufficient. Diaconis and\nSaloff-Coste (2006) verified this conjecture for continuous-time\nbirth-and-death chains, started at an endpoint, with convergence measured in\nseparation. It is natural to ask whether the conjecture holds for these chains\nin the more widely used total-variation distance.\n  In this work, we confirm the above conjecture for all continuous-time or lazy\ndiscrete-time birth-and-death chains, with convergence measured via\ntotal-variation distance. Namely, if the product of the mixing-time and\nspectral-gap tends to infinity, the chains exhibit cutoff at the maximal\nhitting time of the stationary distribution median, with a window of at most\nthe geometric mean between the relaxation-time and mixing-time.\n  In addition, we show that for any lazy (or continuous-time) birth-and-death\nchain with stationary distribution $\\pi$, the separation $1 - p^t(x,y)/\\pi(y)$\nis maximized when $x,y$ are the endpoints. Together with the above results,\nthis implies that total-variation cutoff is equivalent to separation cutoff in\nany family of such chains.\n","Comment: 25 pages"]}]
