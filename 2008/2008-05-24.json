This feature is not\nobserved in the Swift redshift distribution and to account for this\ndiscrepancy, a dominant bias, independent of the Swift sensitivity, is\nrequired. Furthermore, despite rapid localization, about 40-50% of Swift and\npre-Swift GRBs do not have a measured redshift. We employ a heuristic technique\nto extract this redshift bias using 66 GRBs localized by Swift with redshifts\ndetermined from absorption or emission spectroscopy. For the Swift and\nHETE+BeppoSAX redshift distributions, the best model fit to the bias in z < 1\nimplies that if GRB rate evolution follows the SFR, the bias cancels this rate\nincrease. We find that the same bias is affecting both Swift and HETE+BeppoSAX\nmeasurements similarly in z < 1. Using a bias model constrained at a 98% KS\nprobability, we find that 72% of GRBs in z < 2 will not have measurable\nredshifts and about 55% in z > 2. To achieve this high KS probability requires\nincreasing the GRB rate density in small z compared to the high-z rate. This\nprovides further evidence for a low-luminosity population of GRBs that are\nobserved in only a small volume because of their faintness.\n","Comment: 5 pages, submitted to MNRAS"]}]
