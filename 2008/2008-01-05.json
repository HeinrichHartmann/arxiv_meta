It is\nsuggested that the spin fluctuations are driven by the Fermi surface, which is\nprone to nesting; they couple to the itinerant holes via the on-site Coulomb\ncorrelation energy, which inhibits double occupancy of spins or holes. The\nmaximum energy of the fluctuations gives an appropriate energy scale for the\nsuperconducting $T_{\\rm c}$. Based on this model, one can specify the design of\nsolids that will exhibit ``high $T_{\\rm c}$'' superconductivity.\n"]}]

The virtual reality concept is\nfamiliar to us from online worlds, but our world as a virtual reality is\nusually a subject for science fiction rather than science. Yet logically the\nworld could be an information simulation running on a multi-dimensional\nspace-time screen. Indeed, if the essence of the universe is information,\nmatter, charge, energy and movement could be aspects of information, and the\nmany conservation laws could be a single law of information conservation. If\nthe universe were a virtual reality, its creation at the big bang would no\nlonger be paradoxical, as every virtual system must be booted up. It is\nsuggested that whether the world is an objective reality or a virtual reality\nis a matter for science to resolve. Modern information science can suggest how\ncore physical properties like space, time, light, matter and movement could\nderive from information processing. Such an approach could reconcile relativity\nand quantum theories, with the former being how information processing creates\nspace-time, and the latter how it creates energy and matter.\n","Comment: The argument that virtual reality information simulations may be\n  relevant to modern physics theory is a little outside the mainstream, but\n  even people in Physics now consider this possibility, e.g. Svozil"]}]

We suggest here a new test that is valid at z\\simeq 0.\nIt is based on existing observational data, numerical simulations, and three\nwell known analytic models that evaluate the bias parameter b, the ratio of\ngalaxy to dark matter (DM) fluctuations. These analytic models are based on the\nphysical processes involved in the formation of stars and in the formation and\nmerging of galaxies. The value of b(z) obtained in each model is a function of\nthe DM growth factor D(z), which, in turn, is a function of the DE. We show\nthat the equations for b in all three analytic models can be reduced to the\nform of a known constant plus the term E[D(z=0)/D(z)]^{\\alpha}, where \\alpha=1\nor 2 and E is a free parameter. Using the value of b obtained by the 2dFGRS\nconsortium for the \\LambdaCDM model, to normalize E, we find that all three\nanalytic models predict b^2(0)=1\\pm 0.1 for all DE models. Numerical\nsimulations that evaluated b^2(0) for the \\LambdaCDM and CDM (\\Lambda=0) models\nalso obtained b^2(0)=1\\pm 0.1. Since this value of b^2(0) is indicated by\nnumerical simulations as well as by all three popular analytic models, which\nare normalized by the 2dFGRS consortium result for the \\LambdaCDM model, we\nsuggest the condition that b^2(0)=1\\pm 0.1 at z=0 as a new test for the\nviability of dark energy models. Thus, for a given observed galaxy fluctuation\nspectrum such as that of the 2dFGRS consortium, if the DM fluctuations are\ngreater or less than the galaxy fluctuations by more than 10%, the DE model can\nbe discarded.\n","Comment: improved discussion"]}]
