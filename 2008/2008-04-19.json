The algorithm of image processing\nutilises a nonparametric statistical criterion that identifies a straight-line\nsegment as a linear feature (lineament) if the photospheric brightness at a\ncertain distance from this line is on both sides stochastically lower or higher\nthan at the line itself. Curvilinear features can be detected as chains of\nlineaments, using a criterion modified in some way. Once the input parameters\nused by the algorithm are properly adjusted, the algorithm highlights\n``ridges'' and ``trenches'' in the relief of the brightness field, drawing\nwhite and dark lanes. The most remarkable property of the trenching patterns is\na nearly-universally-present parallelism of ridges and trenches. Since the\nmaterial upflows are brighter than the downflows, the alternating parallel\nlight and dark lanes should reflect the presence of roll convection in the\nsubphotospheric layers. If the numerous images processed by us are\nrepresentative, the patterns revealed suggest a widespread occurrence of roll\nconvection in the outer solar convection zone. In particular, the roll systems\ncould form the fine structure of larger-scale, supergranular and/or\nmesogranular convection flows. Granules appear to be overheated blobs of\nmaterial that could develop in convection rolls due to some instabilities of\nroll motion.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 7 figures; accepted by Solar Physics"]}]

This method is\ndemonstrated on diverse relativistic and nonrelativistic models with finite and\ninfinite degrees of freedom. It is shown that under stochastic deformation the\nmodel of a nonrelativistic particle interacting with the electromagnetic field\non a curved background passes into the stochastic model described by the\nFokker-Planck equation with the diffusion tensor being the inverse metric\ntensor.
