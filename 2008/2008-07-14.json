It is well-known that the maximum possible throughput of a slotted\nAloha system with a large number of nodes is 1/e = 0.3679. Indeed, a saturation\nthroughput of 1/e can be achieved with an exponential backoff factor of r =\ne/(e-1)=1.5820. The binary backoff factor of r = 2 is assumed in the majority\nof prior work, and in many practical multiple-access networks such as the\nEthernet and WiFi. For slotted Aloha, the saturation throughput 0.3466 for r =\n2 is reasonably close to the maximum of 1/e, and one could hardly raise\nobjection to adopting r = 2 in the system. However, this paper shows that if\nmean queuing delay is to be bounded, then the sustainable throughput when r = 2\nis only 0.2158, a drastic 41% drop from 1/e . Fortunately, the optimal setting\nof r = 1.3757 under the bounded mean-delay requirement allows us to achieve\nsustainable throughput of 0.3545, a penalty of only less than 4% relative to\n1/e. A general conclusion is that the value of r may significantly affect the\nqueuing delay performance. Besides analyzing mean queuing delay, this paper\nalso delves into the phenomenon of starvation, wherein some nodes are deprived\nof service for an extended period of time while other nodes hog the system.\nSpecifically, we propose a quantitative definition for starvation and show that\nthe conditions to guarantee bounded mean delay and non-starved operation are\none of the same, thus uniting these two notions. Finally, we show that when\nmean delay is large and starvation occurs, the performance results obtained\nfrom simulation experiments may not converge.

We find two superconducting\ngaps with different values: a large gap (~ 12 meV) on the two small hole-like\nand electron-like FS sheets, and a small gap (~ 6 meV) on the large hole-like\nFS. Both gaps, closing simultaneously at the bulk Tc, are nodeless and nearly\nisotropic around their respective FS sheets. The isotropic pairing interactions\nare strongly orbital dependent, as the ratio 2Delta/kBTc switches from weak to\nstrong coupling on different bands. The same and surprisingly large\nsuperconducting gap due to strong pairing on the two small FS, which are\nconnected by the (pi, 0) spin-density-wave vector in the parent compound,\nstrongly suggests that the pairing mechanism originates from the inter-band\ninteractions between these two nested FS sheets.\n","Comment: 4 figures"]}]

Given a set of robots with\narbitrary initial location and no initial agreement on a global coordinate\nsystem, gathering requires that all robots reach the exact same but not\npredetermined location while scattering aims at scatter robots such that no two\nrobots share the same location. Both deterministic gathering and scattering\nhave been proved impossible under arbitrary schedulers therefore probabilistic\nsolutions have been recently proposed.
