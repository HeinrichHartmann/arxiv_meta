Recent experiments on Fermi gases have realized a\nphase transition to a Fermi superfluid state with strong interparticle\ninteractions. This system is a realization of the BCS-BEC crossover connecting\nthe physics of BCS superconductivity and that of Bose-Einstein condensation\n(BEC). While many aspects of this system have been investigated, it has not yet\nbeen possible to measure the single-particle excitation spectrum, which is a\nfundamental property directly predicted by many-body theories. Here we show\nthat the single-particle spectral function of the strongly interacting Fermi\ngas at T ~ Tc is dramatically altered in a way that is consistent with a large\npairing gap. We use photoemission spectroscopy to directly probe the elementary\nexcitations and energy dispersion in the Fermi gas of atoms. In these\nphotoemission experiments, an rf photon ejects an atom from our strongly\ninteracting system via a spin-flip transition to a weakly interacting state. We\nmeasure the occupied single-particle density of states for an ultracold Fermi\ngas of 40-potassium atoms at the cusp of the BCS-BEC crossover and on the BEC\nside of the crossover, and compare these results to that for a nearly ideal\nFermi gas. Our results probe the many-body physics in a way that could be\ncompared to data for high-Tc superconductors. This new measurement technique\nfor ultracold atom gases, like photoemission spectroscopy for electronic\nmaterials, directly probes low energy excitations and thus can reveal\nexcitation gaps and/or pseudogaps.

The reversible formation of an\nadsorbed film, which precedes capillary condensation, results in an extension\nof the porous material while, in the hysteresis region, the negative liquid\npressures under the concave menisci contract the porous matrix. The elastic\ndeformation exhibits an hysteresis loop in the same pressure region as the\nadsorption phenomenon.

We find that the\nvariation of the surface free energy related to the elastic deformation is an\nimportant component of the total free energy.

A central question is whether the ligand\ninduces the conformational change (induced-fit), or rather selects and\nstabilizes a complementary conformation from a pre-existing equilibrium of\nground and excited states of the protein (selected-fit). We consider here the\nbinding kinetics in a simple four-state model of ligand-protein binding. In\nthis model, the protein has two conformations, which can both bind the ligand.\nThe first conformation is the ground state of the protein when the ligand is\noff, and the second conformation is the ground state when the ligand is bound.\nThe induced-fit mechanism corresponds to ligand binding in the unbound ground\nstate, and the selected-fit mechanism to ligand binding in the excited state.\nWe find a simple, characteristic difference between the on- and off-rates in\nthe two mechanisms if the conformational relaxation into the ground states is\nfast. In the case of selected-fit binding, the on-rate depends on the\nconformational equilibrium constant, while the off-rate is independent. In the\ncase of induced-fit binding, in contrast, the off-rate depends on the\nconformational equilibrium, while the on-rate is independent. Whether a protein\nbinds a ligand via selected-fit or induced-fit thus may be revealed by\nmutations far from the protein's binding pocket, or other \"perturbations\" that\nonly affect the conformational equilibrium. In the case of selected-fit, such\nmutations will only change the on-rate, and in the case of induced-fit, only\nthe off-rate.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures; to appear in \"Proteins: Structure, Function, and\n  Bioinformatics\""]}]
