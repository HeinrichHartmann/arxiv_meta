We show that the orbifold quantum cohomology of $\\mathcal{C}_{k,m}$\ncoincides with $M_{k,m}$ as Frobenius manifolds. Modulo some\nyet-to-be-clarified details, this implies that the descendant (respectively the\nancestor) potential of $M_{k,m}$ is a generating function for the descendant\n(respectively ancestor) orbifold Gromov--Witten invariants of\n$\\mathcal{C}_{k,m}$.\n  There is a certain similarity between our HQE and the Lax operators of the\nExtended bi-graded Toda hierarchy, introduced by G. Carlet in \\cite{car}.\nTherefore, it is plausible that our HQE characterize the tau-functions of this\nhierarchy and we expect that the Extended bi-graded Toda hierarchy governs the\nGromov--Witten theory of $\\mathcal{C}_{k,m}.$\n","Comment: v2: Typos and mistakes fixed, to appear in Journal fuer die reine und\n  angewandte Mathematik (Crelle's Journal). v3: Mistakes fixed and references\n  updated"]}]
