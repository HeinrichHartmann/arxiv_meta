In this study we neglect the influence of the\nparticle on the membrane dynamics, thus the membrane dynamics agrees with that\nof a freely fluctuating membrane. Overall, we find that this curvature-coupling\nsubstantially enhances the diffusion coefficient. We compare the ratio of the\nprojected or measured diffusion coefficient and the free intramembrane\ndiffusion coefficient, which is a parameter of the simulations, with analytical\nresults that rely on several approximations. We find that the simulations\nalways lead to a somewhat smaller diffusion coefficient than our analytical\napproach. A detailed study of the correlations of the forces acting on the\nparticle indicates that the diffusing inclusion tries to follow favorable\npositions on the membrane, such that forces along the trajectory are on average\nsmaller than they would be for random particle positions.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 8 figures"]}]

There, a single molecule fluctuates between two or more\nstates, and the experimental observable depends on the state's occupation time\ndistribution. To mathematically describe the observable there was a need to\ncalculate a single state occupation time distribution.\n  In this paper, we consider a Markov process with countably many states. In\norder to find a one-stete occupation time density, we use a combination of\nFourier and Laplace transforms in the way that allows for inversion of the\nFourier transform. We derive an explicit expression for an occupation time\ndensity in the case of a simple continuous time random walk on Z. Also we\nexamine the spectral measures in Karlin-McGregor diagonalization in an attempt\nto represent occupation time densities via modified Bessel functions.\n","Comment: 13 pages"]}]
