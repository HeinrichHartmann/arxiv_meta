We characterize spread-out probability measures on $G$ that are mixing\nby convolutions by means of their Fourier transforms. A key tool is a spectral\nradius formula for the Fourier transform of a regular Borel measure on $G$ that\nwe develop, and which is analogous to the well-known Beurling--Gelfand spectral\nradius formula. For spread-out probability measures on $G$, we also\ncharacterize ergodicity by means of the Fourier transform of the measure.\nFinally, we show that spread-out probability measures on such groups are mixing\nif and only if they are weakly mixing.\n"]}]
