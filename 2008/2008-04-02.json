We\nassume that a fraction of jet energy, which is generated by an AGN, is\ntransferred to the surrounding gas as thermal energy. Combining a theoretical\nmodel of mass accretion onto black holes with a multiphase description of\nstar-forming gas, we self-consistently follow evolution of both galaxies and\ntheir central black holes. The novelty in our model is that we consider two\ndistinct accretion modes: standard radiatively efficient thin accretion disks\nand radiatively inefficient accretion flows which we will generically refer to\nas RIAFs; motivated by theoretical models for jet production in accretion\ndisks, we assume that only the RIAF is responsible for the AGN feedback. We\nfind that, after an initial episode of bursting star formation, the accretion\nrate onto the central black hole drops so that the accretion disk switches to a\nRIAF structure. At this point, the feedback from the AGN becomes efficient and\nslightly suppresses star formation in the galactic disk and almost completely\nhalts star formation in the bulge. As a result, the nucleus becomes a\nstochastically fuelled low-luminosity AGN (Seyfert galaxy) with recurrent\nshort-lived episodes of activity after the star bursts. Our model predicts\nseveral properties of the low-luminosity AGN including the bolometric\nluminosity, jet powers, the effect on kpc-scale of the radio jet and the AGN\nlifetime, which are in broad agreement with observations of Seyfert galaxies\nand their radio activity. We also find that the mass ratios between the central\nblack hole and the the host spheroid at z = 0 are ~10^{-3} regardless of the\nstrength of either supernova feedback or AGN feedback.

Both mean flows are linearly\nunstable for a range of supersonic Mach numbers ($M$). For a given $M$, the\ncritical Reynolds number ($Re$) is significantly smaller for the uniform shear\nflow than its non-uniform shear counterpart. An analysis of perturbation energy\nreveals that the instability is primarily caused by an excess transfer of\nenergy from mean-flow to perturbations. It is shown that the energy-transfer\nfrom mean-flow occurs close to the moving top-wall for ``mode I'' instability,\nwhereas it occurs in the bulk of the flow domain for ``mode II''. For the\nnon-modal analysis, it is shown that the maximum amplification of perturbation\nenergy, $G_{\\max}$, is significantly larger for the uniform shear case compared\nto its non-uniform counterpart. For $\\alpha=0$, the linear stability operator\ncan be partitioned into ${\\cal L}\\sim \\bar{\\cal L} + Re^2{\\cal L}_p$, and the\n$Re$-dependent operator ${\\cal L}_p$ is shown to have a negligibly small\ncontribution to perturbation energy which is responsible for the validity of\nthe well-known quadratic-scaling law in uniform shear flow: $G(t/{\\it Re}) \\sim\n{\\it Re}^2$.

The Fuchsian singularities\nare allowed to be of arbitrary resonant index; the irregular singularities are\nalso allowed to be resonant in the sense that the leading coefficient matrix at\neach singularity may have arbitrary Jordan canonical form, with a genericity\ncondition on the Lidskii submatrix of the subleading term. We also give the\nrelevant notion of isomonodromic tau function extending the one of non-resonant\ndeformations introduced by Miwa-Jimbo-Ueno. The tau function is expressed\npurely in terms of spectral invariants of the matrix of the connection.\n","Comment: 48 pages"]}]

We show that these polynomials satisfy certain\nrecurrence relations with a number of terms d_i depending on the number of\nhard-edges and on the degree of the rational functions V_i'. Using these\nrelations we derive Christoffel-Darboux identities satisfied by the\nbiorthogonal polynomials: this enables us to give explicit formulae for the\ndifferential equation satisfied by d_i+1 consecutive polynomials, We also\ndefine certain integral transforms of the polynomials and use them to formulate\na Riemann-Hilbert problem for (d_i+1) x (d_i+1) matrices constructed out of the\npolynomials and these transforms. Moreover we prove that the\nChristoffel-Darboux pairing can be interpreted as a pairing between two dual\nRiemann-Hilbert problems.\n","Comment: 47 pages, 4 figures"]}]

We use a weighted network representation where vertices\ncorrespond to towns and the edges to the actual commuting flows among those. We\ncharacterize quantitatively both the topological and weighted properties of the\nresulting network. Interestingly, the statistical properties of commuting\ntraffic exhibit complex features and non-trivial relations with the underlying\ntopology. We characterize quantitatively the traffic backbone among large\ncities and we give evidences for a very high heterogeneity of the commuter\nflows around large cities. We also discuss the interplay between the\ntopological and dynamical properties of the network as well as their relation\nwith socio-demographic variables such as population and monthly income. This\nanalysis may be useful at various stages in environmental planning and provides\nanalytical tools for a wide spectrum of applications ranging from impact\nevaluation to decision-making and planning support.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 12 figures, 4 tables; 1 missing ref added and minor\n  revisions"]}]

We suggest a\nrelativistic energy operator, which in the classical limit reduces to the\nEinstein-Infeld-Hoffmann Hamiltonian for massive particles and correctly\ndescribes the effects of gravity on photons, including the light bending, the\nShapiro delay, the gravitational time dilation and the red shift.
