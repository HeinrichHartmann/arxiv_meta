Because of the thermoelectric effect, there is no net\ncharge current but there is a heat flow from the hot side to the cold side. We\nperform the theoretical calculation of dynamical thermospin Hall conductivity\nin a two-dimensional Rashba spintronic system. It has been shown that the\ndirect interband optical transition dominates the ordering and manipulation of\nspin in the generation of a transverse intrinsic spin current. In view of the\nrole of the thermoelectric effect, the contributions to the thermospin Hall\neffect are classified as that originating from a direct contribution of thermal\nelectronic diffusion and that from the compensatory electron flow in balance\nwith the thermal diffusion. For a finite system, the analysis yields evidence\nthat the spin accumulation around the edges of a plate determines the\nmagnetization. In equilibrium, a field created by a magnetization gradient\nemerges in the direction perpendicular to the temperature gradient. The\nexperimental observation of the thermospin Hall effect is proposed by measuring\nthe longitudinal temperature difference with the injection of a transverse spin\ncurrent and by analyzing the Hall angle.

If these distributions have\nfractal geometry, it must be reflected in the geometry of voids; in particular,\nwe expect scaling sizes of voids. However, this scaling is not well\ndemonstrated in galaxy surveys yet. AIMS: Our objective is to understand the\ngeometry of cosmic voids in relation to a fractal structure of matter. We\nintend to distinguish monofractal voids from multifractal voids, regarding\ntheir scaling properties. We plan to analyse voids in the distributions of mass\nconcentrations (halos) in a multifractal and their relation to galaxy voids.\nMETHODS: We make a statistical analysis of point distributions based on the\nvoid probability function and correlation functions. We assume that voids are\nspherical and devise a simple spherical void finder. For continuous mass\ndistributions, we employ the methods of fractal geometry. We confirm the\nanalytical predictions with numerical simulations. Smoothed mass distributions\nare suitable for the method of excursion sets. RESULTS: Voids are very\nnonlinear and non-perturbative structures. Voids reflect the fractal geometry\nof the matter distribution but not always directly: scaling sizes of voids\nimply fractal geometry, but fractal voids may have a complicated geometry and\nmay not have scaling sizes. Proper multifractal voids are of this type. A\nnatural multifractal biasing model implies that the voids in the galaxy\ndistribution inherit the same complicated geometry. CONCLUSIONS: Current galaxy\nsurveys as well as cosmological N-body simulations indicate that cosmic voids\nare proper multifractal voids.

In this paper, we explore the effects of alcohol availability on\nassault crimes at the census tract level over time. The statistical analysis is\nchallenged by several features of the data: (1) the effects of possible\ncovariates (for example, the alcohol outlet density of each census tract) on\nthe assaultive crime rates may be complex; (2) the covariates may be highly\ncorrelated with each other; (3) there are a lot of missing inputs in the data;\nand (4) spatial correlations exist in the outcome assaultive crime rates. We\npropose a hierarchical additive model, where the nonlinear correlations and the\ncomplex interaction effects are modeled using the multiple additive regression\ntrees (MART) and the spatial variances in the assaultive rates that cannot be\nexplained by the specified covariates are smoothed trough the Conditional\nAutoregressive (CAR) model. We develop a two-stage algorithm that connect the\nnon-parametric trees with CAR to look for important variables covariates\nassociated with the assaultive crime rates, while taking account of the spatial\ncorrelations among adjacent census tracts. The proposed methods are applied to\nthe Los Angeles assaultive data (1990-1999) and compared with traditional\nmethod.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 4 figures, submitted"]}]

Here we report an observation, made for 37 fully sequenced\neukaryotic genomes, which indicates that eukaryotes require a certain minimum\namount of non-coding DNA (ncDNA). This minimum increases quadratically with the\namount of DNA located in exons. Based on a simple model of the growth of\nregulatory networks, we derive a theoretical prediction of the required\nquantity of ncDNA and find it to be in excellent agreement with the data. The\namount of additional ncDNA (in basepairs) which eukaryotes require obeys Ndef =\n1/2 (Nc / Np) (Nc - Np), where Nc is the amount of exonic DNA, and Np is a\nconstant of about 10Mb. This value Ndef corresponds to a few percent of the\ngenome in Homo sapiens and other mammals, and up to half the genome in simpler\neukaryotes. Thus our findings confirm that eukaryotic life depends on a\nsubstantial fraction of ncDNA and also make a prediction of the size of this\nfraction, which matches the data closely.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in J.
