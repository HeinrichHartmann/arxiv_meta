All geometric objects defined in this\ngeometry are not only functions of the positional argument $x$, but also depend\non the directional argument $y$. In other words, instead of dealing with\ngeometric objects defined on the manifold $M$, as in the case of classical\nAP-geometry, we are dealing with geometric objects in the pullback bundle\n$\\pi^{-1}(TM)$ (the pullback of the tangent bundle $TM$ by $ \\pi: T\nM\\longrightarrow M$). Many new geometric objects, which have no counterpart in\nthe classical AP-geometry, emerge in this more general context. We refer to\nsuch a geometry as generalized AP-geometry (GAP-geometry). In analogy to\nAP-geometry, we define a $d$-connection in $\\pi^{-1}(TM)$ having remarkable\nproperties, which we call the canonical $d$-connection, in terms of the unique\ntorsion-free Riemannian $d$-connection. In addition to these two\n$d$-connections, two more $d$-connections are defined, the dual and the\nsymmetric $d$-connections. Our space, therefore, admits twelve curvature\ntensors (corresponding to the four defined $d$-connections), three of which\nvanish identically. Simple formulae for the nine non-vanishing curvatures\ntensors are obtained, in terms of the torsion tensors of the canonical\n$d$-connection. The different $W$-tensors admitted by the space are also\ncalculated. All contractions of the $h$- and $v$-curvature tensors and the\n$W$-tensors are derived. Second rank symmetric and skew-symmetric tensors,\nwhich prove useful in physical applications, are singled out.\n","Comment: 20 pages, LaTeX file, Presented in \"The International Conference on\n  Finsler Extensions of Relativity Theory\" held at Cairo, Egypt, November\n  4-10,2006.

(2007), we study the average colour and average concentration of satellite\ngalaxies as function of (i) their stellar mass, (ii) their group mass, and\n(iii) their group-centric radius. We find that the colours and concentrations\nof satellite galaxies are (almost) completely determined by their stellar mass.\nIn particular, at fixed stellar mass, the average colours and concentrations of\nsatellite galaxies are independent of either halo mass or halo-centric radius.\nWe find clear evidence for mass segregation of satellite galaxies in haloes of\nall masses, and argue that this explains why satellites at smaller halo-centric\nradii are somewhat redder and somewhat more concentrated. In addition, the weak\ncolour and concentration dependence of satellite galaxies on halo mass is\nsimply a reflection of the fact that more massive haloes host, on average, more\nmassive satellites. Combining these results with the fact that satellite\ngalaxies are, on average, redder and somewhat more concentrated than central\ngalaxies of the same stellar mass, the following picture emerges: galaxies\nbecome redder and somewhat more concentrated once they fall into a bigger halo\n(i.e., once they become a satellite galaxy). This is a clear manifestation of\nenvironment dependence. However, there is no indication that the magnitude of\nthe transformation (or its timescale) depends on environment; a galaxy\nundergoes a transition when it becomes a satellite, but it does not matter\nwhether it becomes a satellite of a small (Milky Way sized) halo, or of a\nmassive cluster.

Supporting this paradigm, we define two\nentropic measures of nonclassical correlation of a multipartite quantum system.\nOne is defined as the minimum uncertainty about a joint system after we collect\noutcomes of particular local measurements. The other is defined by taking the\nmaximum over all local systems about the minimum distance between a genuine set\nand a mimic set of eigenvalues of a reduced density matrix of a local system.\nThe latter measure is based on an artificial game to create mimic eigenvalues\nof a reduced density matrix of a local system from eigenvalues of a density\nmatrix of a global system. Numerical computation of these measures for several\nexamples is performed.\n","Comment: v1: 10 pages, 8 figures, IOPART, v2: introduction modified, figure 7\n  replaced, v3: 10 pages, 10 figures, RevTeX4, major revision with an\n  additional measure introduced, title changed (previous title: Non-classical\n  correlation in a multi-partite quantum system reconsidered), to appear in\n  Phys.
