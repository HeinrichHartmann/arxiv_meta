Both the soft-hard-soft\n(impulsive) phase and the hardening (gradual) phase are well described by\npiecewise linear dependence of the photon spectral index on the logarithm of\nthe hard X-ray flux.

For sufficiently small aspect ratios, a gap appears in\nthe first Brillouin zone of the chain lattice in which propagating modes do not\nexist. depending on the SPP polarization, the gap extends to certain intervals\nof the Bloch wave number q. Thus, for transverse polarization, no propagating\nSPPs exist with wave numbers q such that q_c^\\perp < | q | < \\pi/h, h being the\nchain period.

In a\nroom-temperature experiment, we made efforts to improve the sensitivity. The\ncurrent best sensitivity at 300 K is about $6 \\times 10^{-21} /\\sqrt{\\rm Hz}$\naround 400 Hz. Below 20 Hz, the strain (not displacement) sensitivity is\ncomparable to that of LIGO, although the baselines of CLIO are 40-times shorter\n(CLIO: 100m, LIGO: 4km). This is because seismic noise is extremely small in\nKamioka mine. We operated the interferometer at room temperature for\ngravitational wave observations. We obtained 86 hours of data. In the cryogenic\nexperiment, it was confirmed that the mirrors were sufficiently cooled (14 K).\nHowever, we found that the radiation shield ducts transferred 300K radiation\ninto the cryostat more effectively than we had expected. We observed that noise\ncaused by pure aluminum wires to suspend a mirror was suppressed by cooling the\nmirror.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 9 figures. Amaldi7 proceedings, J. Phys.: Conf.
