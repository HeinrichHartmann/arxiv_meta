The said theory is generalizing reference frames theory in\nGR. Physical structure (P-structure) and corresponding physical geometry\n(P-geometry) notions, representing properties invariance of some physical\nobjects and their relations, are introduced. P-structure of classical physical\ntime and its corresponding chronogeometry is considered as an example. Some\nquantitative characteristics of observer's visual space geometry are\nexperimentally determined. The affine model of visual geometry is offered to\ninterpret experimentally sampled data.
