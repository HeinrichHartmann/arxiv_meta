We present new high spatial resolution narrowband imaging\nobservations of extraplanar diffuse ionized gas (eDIG) in four late-type,\nactively star forming edge-on spirals, obtained with ACS on-board HST. Our\nF658N (H-alpha) observations reveal a multitude of structures on both small and\nlarge scales. Whereas all four galaxies have been studied with ground-based\ntelescopes before, here the small scale structure of the extended emission line\ngas is presented for the first time at a spatial resolution of 0.05\",\ncorresponding to 5.0 pc at the mean distance to the target galaxies. The eDIG\nmorphology is very different for all four targets, probably as a result of\ntheir different levels of star formation activity. We find that the morphology\nof the eDIG, in particular the break-up of diffuse emission into filaments in\ngalaxy halos, shows a strong dependence on the level of star formation activity\nper unit area, and eDIG can be arranged into a morphological sequence. NGC4634\nand NGC5775 have the highest SF rate per unit area in our sample and the\nobserved morphology suggests that the break-up of the smooth eDIG layer into\nindividual resolved filaments occurs only above a certain threshold of SF\nactivity per unit area. Combined with ground-based data for samples that span a\nlarger range of galaxy mass our results indicate that the gravitational\npotential also plays an important role in the eDIG morphology. In low-mass\ngalaxies the gas can be expelled due to shallow gravitational potentials more\neasily and couple with strong star formation driven outflows on a local scale.\nThis is in contrast to the more massive galaxies, which show smooth eDIG\nlayers, unless they are powered by a superwind, as in the case of nucleated\nstarburst galaxies.\n","Comment: submitted to The Astronomical Journal, 21 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables,\n  article with full resolution figures is available at\n  http://www.astro.ufl.edu/~jrossa/transfer/acsdighalos042308.pdf"]}]
