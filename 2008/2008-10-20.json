This new SO term\nis non-zero even in symmetric geometries, as it arises from the intersubband\ncoupling between confined states of distinct parities, and its strength is\ncomparable to that of the ordinary Rashba. Starting from the $8 \\times 8$ Kane\nmodel, here we present a detailed derivation of this new SO Hamiltonian and the\ncorresponding SO coupling. In addition, within the self-consistent Hartree\napproximation, we calculate the strength of this new SO coupling for realistic\nsymmetric modulation-doped wells with two subbands. We consider gated\nstructures with either a constant areal electron density or a constant chemical\npotential. In the parameter range studied, both models give similar results. By\nconsidering the effects of an external applied bias, which breaks the\nstructural inversion symmetry of the wells, we also calculate the strength of\nthe resulting induced Rashba couplings within each subband. Interestingly, we\nfind that for double wells the Rashba couplings for the first and second\nsubbands interchange signs abruptly across the zero bias, while the\nintersubband SO coupling exhibits a resonant behavior near this symmetric\nconfiguration. For completeness we also determine the strength of the\nDresselhaus couplings and find them essentially constant as function of the\napplied bias.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 12 figures"]}]
