In this arrangement, a diamond anvil\nhigh-pressure cell (DAC) containing a microscopic sample of typical diameter\n~50-100 micrometer, is mounted on a precision X-Y nanomotor stage that forms\npart of an IR laser heating optical assembly. Automation of this stage has been\naccomplished using a LabVIEW virtual instrument program to manipulate the X and\nY stages using nanopositioning systems. This has a major feature of enabling a\nrastered heating of the sample over a user-defined circular area, without any\noperator intervention in addition to a virtual joystick to position the sample\nwith respect to the laser spot. This auto-rastering feature has the advantage\nof offering uniform exposure of a circular area of the sample to the incident\nheating laser beam apart from drastic reduction in scan time compared to a\nmanual scan. The diameter of the circle can be varied from a maximum of ~24 mm\ndown to the focal spot size of the laser (~few micrometers), enabling thereby\nusage of the laser heating arrangement for heating microscopic samples under\nhigh-pressure in a DAC, as well as bulk samples at atmospheric pressure.\nExamples for both macro and micro scale automated laser-heating experiments\nhave been presented. In particular, at the micro scale, auto-raster heated\ncarbon samples at ~ 17 GPa and ~2000 K showed excellent signatures of diamond\nformation compared to manually raster heated samples, highlighting the unique\nadvantage of auto-raster heating.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 4 figures, prepared for submitting to appropriate journal"]}]

The\nmismatched decoding model is well-defined for finite, yet arbitrary, block\nlengths, and naturally captures the channel memory among the bits belonging to\nthe same symbol. We give two independent proofs of the achievability of the\nBICM capacity calculated by Caire et al. where BICM was modeled as a set of\nindependent parallel binary-input channels whose output is the bitwise\nlog-likelihood ratio. Our first achievability proof uses typical sequences, and\nshows that due to the random coding construction, the interleaver is not\nrequired. The second proof is based on the random coding error exponents with\nmismatched decoding, where the largest achievable rate is the generalized\nmutual information. We show that the generalized mutual information of the\nmismatched decoder coincides with the infinite-interleaver BICM capacity. We\nalso show that the error exponent -and hence the cutoff rate- of the BICM\nmismatched decoder is upper bounded by that of coded modulation and may thus be\nlower than in the infinite-interleaved model. We also consider the mutual\ninformation appearing in the analysis of iterative decoding of BICM with EXIT\ncharts. We show that the corresponding symbol metric has knowledge of the\ntransmitted symbol and the EXIT mutual information admits a representation as a\npseudo-generalized mutual information, which is in general not achievable.

The approach of the\npaper is based on applications of classic results of Tak\\'acs (1967) and the\nTauberian theorem with remainder of Postnikov (1979-1980) associated with the\nrecurrence relation of convolution type. The main result of the paper is\nassociated with asymptotic behavior of the loss probability. Specifically it is\nshown that in some cases (precisely described in the paper) where the load of\nthe system approaches 1 from the left and $n$ increases to infinity, the loss\nprobability of the $GI/M/m/n$ queue becomes asymptotically independent of the\nparameter $m$.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 12pt, 1 table, to apear in \"Quality Technology and\n  Quantitative Management\""]}]

The problem\nbecomes stiff as the spectral parameter grows. Consequently, the\nGauss--Legendre method has previously been used for such problems; however more\nrecently, methods based on the Magnus expansion have been proposed. Here we\nextensively examine the stiff regime for a general scalar Schr\\\"odinger\noperator. We show that although the fourth-order Magnus method suffers from\norder reduction, a fortunate cancellation when computing the Evans matching\nfunction means that fourth-order convergence in the end result is preserved.\nThe Gauss--Legendre method does not suffer from order reduction, but it does\nnot experience the cancellation either, and thus it has the same order of\nconvergence in the end result. Finally we discuss the relative merits of both\nmethods as spectral tools.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 3 figures; removed superfluous material (+/- 1 page), added\n  paragraph to conclusion and two references"]}]
