Local read-write is shown to be an atomic abstraction for\nsynchronizing neighborhood states in sensor networks. The paper compares local\nread-write to similar lightweight operations in wireless sensor networks, such\nas read-all, write-all, and a transaction-based abstraction: for some\noptimistic scenarios, local read-write is a more efficient neighborhood\noperation. A partial implementation is described, which shows that three\noutcomes characterize operation response: success, failure, and cancel. A\nfailure response indicates possible inconsistency for the operation result,\nwhich is the result of a timeout event at the operation's initiator.
