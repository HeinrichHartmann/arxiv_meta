The imaginary time formalism allows one to monitor the system as\na function of temperature. The family of classical paths, saddle points for the\naction, is derived in terms of Jacobian elliptic functions whose periodicity\nsets the energy-temperature correspondence. The period of the classical\noscillations varies monotonically with the energy up to the sphaleron, pointing\nto a smooth crossover from the quantum to the activated regime. The softening\nof the quantum fluctuation spectrum is evaluated analytically by the theory of\nthe functional determinants and computed at low $T$ up to the crossover. In\nparticular, the negative eigenvalue, causing an imaginary contribution to the\npartition function, is studied in detail by solving the Lam\\`{e} equation which\ngoverns the fluctuation spectrum. For a heavvy particle mass, the decay rate\nshows a remarkable temperature dependence mainly ascribable to a low lying soft\nmode and, approaching the crossover, it increases by a factor five over the\npredictions of the zero temperature theory.

Two multiple-access techniques are considered for scheduling\ntransmissions from each MT to the BS at the same frequency, which are\nspace-division multiple-access (SDMA) and time-division multiple-access (TDMA).\nFor SDMA, all MTs transmit simultaneously to the BS and their individual\nsignals are resolved at the BS via multiple receive antennas while for TDMA,\neach MT transmits independently to the BS during mutually orthogonal time\nslots. It is assumed that the channel-state information (CSI) of the fading\nchannel from each MT to the BS is unknown at each MT transmitter, but is\nperfectly known at the BS receiver. Thereby, the BS can acquire the long-term\nchannel-distribution information (CDI) for each MT. This paper extends the\nwell-known transmit-covariance feedback scheme for the point-to-point fading\nMIMO channel to the fading MIMO-MAC, whereby the BS jointly optimizes the\ntransmit signal covariance matrices for all MTs based on their CDI, and then\nsends each transmit covariance matrix back to the corresponding MT via a\nfeedback channel. The main goal of this paper is to characterize the so-called\nmultiuser power region under the multiuser transmit-covariance feedback scheme\nfor both SDMA and TDMA. The power region is defined as the constitution of all\nuser transmit power-tuples that can achieve reliable transmissions for a given\nset of user target rates.

This approach is\nbased on the random phase approximation (RPA) and includes the single particle\ncontinuum as well as the coupling to low-lying collectives states which are\nconsidered in a consistent microscopic way. For $^{44}Ca$ we also include\npairing correlations. We obtain good agreement with the experimental data for\nthe gross properties of both resonances. It is demonstrated that the recently\nmeasured A-dependence of the strength of the PDR below 10 MeV is well\nunderstood in our model:due to the phonon coupling some of the strength in\n$^{48}Ca$ is simply shifted beyond 10 MeV. The predicted fragmentation of the\nPDR can be investigated in $(e,e')$ and $(\\gamma ,\\gamma')$ experiments.\nWhereas the isovector dipole strength of the PDR is small in all Ca isotopes,\nwe find in this region surprisingly strong isoscalar dipole states, in\nagreement with an $(\\alpha,\\alpha'\\gamma)$ experiment. We conclude that for the\ndetailed understanding of the structure of excited nuclei e.g. the PDR and GDR\nan approach like the present one is absolutely necessary.\n","Comment: 6 figures"]}]
