An ad-hoc network is characterized by energy constrained nodes,\nbandwidth constrained links and dynamic topology. With the growing use of\nwireless networks (including ad-hoc networks) for real-time applications, such\nas voice, video, and real-time data, the need for Quality of Service (QoS)\nguarantees in terms of delay, bandwidth, and packet loss is becoming\nincreasingly important. Providing QoS in ad-hoc networks is a challenging task\nbecause of dynamic nature of network topology and imprecise state information.\nHence, it is important to have a dynamic routing protocol with fast re-routing\ncapability, which also provides stable route during the life-time of the flows.\n  In this thesis, we have proposed a novel, energy aware, stable routing\nprotocol named, Stability-based QoS-capable Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector\n(SQ-AODV), which is an enhancement of the well-known Ad-hoc On-demand Distance\nVector (AODV) routing protocol for ad-hoc wireless networks. SQ-AODV utilizes a\ncross-layer design approach in which information about the residual energy of a\nnode is used for route selection and maintenance. An important feature of\nSQ-AODV protocol is that it uses only local information and requires no\nadditional communication or co-operation between the network nodes. SQ-AODV\npossesses a make-before-break re-routing capability that enables near-zero\npacket drops and is compatible with the basic AODV data formats and operation,\nmaking it easy to adopt in ad-hoc networks.\n","Comment: 65 pages, Master's Thesis, Department of Elecrical Engineering, IIT\n  Bombay"]}]

The sender transmits coded data packets back-to-back before\nstopping to wait for the receiver to acknowledge (ACK) the number of degrees of\nfreedom, if any, that are required to decode correctly the information. We\nprovide an analysis of this problem to show that there is an optimal number of\ncoded data packets, in terms of mean completion time, to be sent before\nstopping to listen.

Such states are elusive to the description with\nperiodic Bloch waves. Mathematically this difficulty is manifested through the\ndiffusion pole in the electron-hole irreducible vertex. The pole leads to a\nclash with analyticity of the self-energy, reflecting causality of the theory,\nwhen norm conservation is enforced by the Ward identity between one- and\ntwo-particle averaged Green functions.\n","Comment: REVTeX4, 8 pages, no figures"]}]
