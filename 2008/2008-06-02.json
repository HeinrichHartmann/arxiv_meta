Thirdly, if the distance is related to the redshift, then the\nvariables of fluence and peak flux definitely cannot be separated from the\nvariable of redshift in distribution functions of both the fluence-redshift and\nthe peak flux-redshift; while the variables separation tests show that they in\neffect do, and we then can exactly forecast the values of the fluence and the\npeak flux for the GRBs with redshift z > 4.5.

The amplitude of the potential induced by a 24 nm-6 nm Au/Ti film is\non the order of a few hundreds of ueV measured at 6 ~ 8 K. Since the metal\nlayer makes the electromagnetic fields to be close to zero at the\nmetal-semiconductor interface, the photon mode is confined more inside of the\ncavity. As a consequence, the effective cavity length is reduced under the\nmetal film, and the corresponding cavity resonance is blue-shifted. Our\nexperimental results are in a good agreement with theoretical estimates. In\naddition, by applying a DC electric voltage to the metal film, we are able to\nmodify the quantum well exciton mode due to the quantum confined Stark effect,\ninducing a ~ 1 meV potential at ~ 20 kV/cm.

The corresponding two-body amplitude is unitarized by\nressumming s-channel diagrams and can be expressed in terms of the usal phase\nshifts $\\delta$. This procedure preserves the chiral properties of the\namplitude at low-energies. Final state interactions also involve another phase\n$\\omega$, which describes intermediate two-meson propagation and is\ntheoretically unambiguous. This phase is absent in the K-matrix approximation.\nPartial contributions to the decay amplitude involve a real term, another one\nwith phase $\\delta$ and several others with phases $\\delta+\\omega$.
