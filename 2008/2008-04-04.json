Specifically, we argue that the scattering of\nquantum fluctuations off surface roughness affects the nature of the boundary\ncondition, and that this has important consequences including a new theorized\ncritical speed and the presence of normal fluid at any nonzero speed, even if\nthe boundary is held at zero temperature. This hydrodynamic boundary condition\nis relevant not only for superfluid helium experiments but also for experiments\nwith trapped dilute Bose-Einstein condensates, in particular those involving\natomic waveguides near surfaces.\n","Comment: Accepted to Phys.

Our main result is that these\nlinear systems, which are symmetric and positive semidefinite, are well\napproximated by symmetric diagonally dominant matrices. Our framework for\ndefining matrix approximation is support theory. Significant graph theoretic\nwork has already been developed in the support framework for preconditioners in\nthe diagonally dominant case, and in particular it is known that such systems\ncan be solved with iterative methods in nearly linear time. Thus, our\napproximation result implies that these graph theoretic techniques can also\nsolve a class of finite element problems in nearly linear time. We show that\nthe support number bounds, which control the number of iterations in the\npreconditioned iterative solver, depend on mesh quality measures but not on the\nproblem size or shape of the domain.\n","Comment: Added ref to Chen & Toledo in Section 9 Added description of how to\n  form RHS; added ref to Wang and Sarin"]}]
