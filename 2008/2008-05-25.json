The experiments involved the simultaneous\nLaser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) measurements of fluid velocity at two locations,\ni.e. in the boundary layer and far away from it in the bulk, for Rayleigh\nnumbers varying between $1.6 \\times 10^7$ and $2.4 \\times 10^9$. In parallel,\ndirect numerical simulations (DNS) have been performed for the same\nconfiguration for Rayleigh numbers between $7.0 \\times 10^4$ and $7.7 \\times\n10^7$. The temperature and velocity probability density functions and the power\nspectra of the horizontal velocity fluctuations measured in the boundary layer\nand in the bulk flow are found to be practically identical. Except for the\nsmallest Rayleigh numbers, the spectra in the boundary layer and in the bulk\ncentral region are continuous and have a wide range of active scales. This\nindicates that both the bulk and the boundary layers are turbulent in the\n$\\textrm{Ra}$ number range considered. However, molecular effects can still be\nobserved and the boundary layer does not behave like a classical shear-driven\nturbulent boundary layer.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 6 figures, Accepted for publication in Phys.
