As a consequence, the pore waters become more reactive, which\nleads to enhanced dissolution-precipitation processes and a modification of the\nmechanical and hydrological properties of the rock. This effect is especially\nimportant for limestones given that the solubility and reactivity of carbonates\nis strongly dependent on pH and the partial pressure of CO2. The main mechanism\nthat couples dissolution, precipitation and rock matrix deformation is commonly\nreferred to as intergranular pressure solution creep (IPS) or pervasive\npressure solution creep (PSC). This process involves dissolution at\nintergranular grain contacts subject to elevated stress, diffusion of dissolved\nmaterial in an intergranular fluid, and precipitation in pore spaces subject to\nlower stress. This leads to an overall and pervasive reduction in porosity due\nto both grain indentation and precipitation in pore spaces. The percolation of\nCO2-rich fluids may influence on-going compaction due to pressure solution and\ncan therefore potentially affect the reservoir and its long-term CO2 storage\ncapacity. We aim at quantifying this effect by using a 2D numerical model to\nstudy the coupling between dissolution-precipitation processes, local mass\ntransfer, and deformation of the rock over long time scales.
