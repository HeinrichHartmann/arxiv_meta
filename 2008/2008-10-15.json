In the absence of topological obstructions the\nholomorphic map may be chosen to have pointwise maximal rank. The analogous\nresult holds for any compact Hausdorff family of maps, but it fails in general\nfor a noncompact family. Our main results are actually proved for smooth almost\ncomplex source manifolds (X,J) with the correct handlebody structure. The paper\ncontains another proof of Eliashberg's (Int J Math 1:29--46, 1990) homotopy\ncharacterization of Stein manifolds and a slightly different explanation of the\nconstruction of exotic Stein surfaces due to Gompf (Ann Math 148 (2):619--693,\n1998; J Symplectic Geom 3:565--587, 2005).

The effect of vaccine therapy is\nconsidered as a parametric perturbation of the model. In the case of a weak\nimmune response, neither immunotherapy nor chemotherapy is found to cause tumor\nregression to a small size, which would be below the clinically detectable\nthreshold. Numerical simulations show that the efficiency of vaccine therapy\ndepends on both the tumor size and the condition of immune system as well as on\nthe response of the organism to vaccination. In particular, we found that\nvaccine therapy becomes more effective when used without time delay from a\nprescribed date of vaccination after surgery and is ineffective without\npreliminary treatment. For a strong immune response, our model predicts the\ntumor remission under vaccine therapy. Our study of successive chemo/immuno,\nimmuno/chemo and concurrent chemoimmunotherapy shows that the chemo/immuno\nsequence is more effective while concurrent chemoimmunotherapy is more sparing.\n","Comment: 34 pages, 9 figures.

This is achieved by\nfirst identifying and removing links which close up feedback loops in the\noriginal network and hierarchically arranging nodes in the remaining network.\nIn mathematical language this corresponds to a problem of making a graph\nacyclic by removing as few links as possible and thus altering the original\ngraph in the least possible way. Practically in all applications the exact\nsolution of this problem requires an enumeration of all combinations of removed\nlinks, which is computationally intractable. We introduce and compare two\nalgorithms: the deterministic, 'greedy' algorithm that preferentially cuts the\nlinks that participate in the largest number of feedback cycles, and the\nprobabilistic one based on a simulated annealing of a hierarchical layout of\nthe network which minimizes the number of ``backward'' links going from lower\nto higher hierarchical levels. We find that the annealing algorithm outperforms\nthe deterministic one in terms of speed, memory requirement, and the actual\nnumber of removed links.
