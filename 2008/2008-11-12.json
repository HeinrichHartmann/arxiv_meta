Exactly speaking, due to the net energy flow, the\nblack hole evaporation is a nonequilibrium process. To study details of\nevaporation process, nonequilibrium effects of the net energy flow should be\ntaken into account. In this article we simplify the situation so that the\nHawking radiation consists of non-self-interacting massless matter fields and\nalso the energy accretion onto the black hole consists of the same fields. Then\nwe find that the nonequilibrium nature of black hole evaporation is described\nby a nonequilibrium state of that field, and we formulate nonequilibrium\nthermodynamics of non-self-interacting massless fields. By applying it to black\nhole evaporation, followings are shown: (1) Nonequilibrium effects of the\nenergy flow tends to accelerate the black hole evaporation, and, consequently,\na specific nonequilibrium phenomenon of semi-classical black hole evaporation\nis suggested. Furthermore a suggestion about the end state of quantum size\nblack hole evaporation is proposed in the context of information loss paradox.\n(2) Negative heat capacity of black hole is the physical essence of the\ngeneralized second law of black hole thermodynamics, and self-entropy\nproduction inside the matter around black hole is not necessary to ensure the\ngeneralized second law. Furthermore a lower bound for total entropy at the end\nof black hole evaporation is given.

In\ncontrast, the notion of algorithmic stability can be used to derive tight\ngeneralization bounds that are tailored to specific learning algorithms by\nexploiting their particular properties. However, as in much of learning theory,\nexisting stability analyses and bounds apply only in the scenario where the\nsamples are independently and identically distributed. In many machine learning\napplications, however, this assumption does not hold.

We prove novel and distinct stability-based\ngeneralization bounds for stationary phi-mixing and beta-mixing sequences.\nThese bounds strictly generalize the bounds given in the i.i.d. case and apply\nto all stable learning algorithms, thereby extending the use of\nstability-bounds to non-i.i.d. scenarios.\n  We also illustrate the application of our phi-mixing generalization bounds to\ngeneral classes of learning algorithms, including Support Vector Regression,\nKernel Ridge Regression, and Support Vector Machines, and many other kernel\nregularization-based and relative entropy-based regularization algorithms.\nThese novel bounds can thus be viewed as the first theoretical basis for the\nuse of these algorithms in non-i.i.d. scenarios.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 1 figure, submitted to JMLR"]}]
