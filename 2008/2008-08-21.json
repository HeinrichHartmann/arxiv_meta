This additive process linearly increases or decreases while the\nbackground state is unchanged, and may have upward jumps at the transition\ninstants of the background state. It is known that the hitting probabilities of\nthis additive process at lower levels have a matrix exponential form. We here\nstudy the hitting probabilities at upper levels, which do not have a matrix\nexponential form in general. These probabilities give the ruin probabilities in\nthe terminology of the risk process. Our major interests are in their analytic\nexpressions and their asymptotic behavior when the hitting level goes to\ninfinity under light tail conditions on the jump sizes. To derive those\nresults, we use a certain duality on the hitting probabilities, which may have\nan independent interest because it does not need any Markovian assumption.\n"]}]
