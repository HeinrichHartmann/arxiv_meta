Synthesis is based on an initial user-assisted analysis\nphase in which the system recognizes distinct types of strokes (hatching and\nstippling) and organizes them according to perceptual grouping criteria. The\nsynthesized strokes are produced by combining properties (eg. length,\norientation, parallelism, proximity) of the stroke groups extracted from the\ninput examples. We illustrate our technique with a drawing application that\nallows the control of attributes and scale-dependent reproduction of the\nsynthesized patterns.\n"]}]

A\n``noncoherent'' or ``channel oblivious'' model is assumed where neither\ntransmitter nor receiver is assumed to have knowledge of the channel transfer\ncharacteristic. Motivated by the property that linear network coding is\nvector-space preserving, information transmission is modelled as the injection\ninto the network of a basis for a vector space $V$ and the collection by the\nreceiver of a basis for a vector space $U$. A metric on the projective geometry\nassociated with the packet space is introduced, and it is shown that a minimum\ndistance decoder for this metric achieves correct decoding if the dimension of\nthe space $V \\cap U$ is sufficiently large. If the dimension of each codeword\nis restricted to a fixed integer, the code forms a subset of a finite-field\nGrassmannian, or, equivalently, a subset of the vertices of the corresponding\nGrassmann graph. Sphere-packing and sphere-covering bounds as well as a\ngeneralization of the Singleton bound are provided for such codes. Finally, a\nReed-Solomon-like code construction, related to Gabidulin's construction of\nmaximum rank-distance codes, is described and a Sudan-style ``list-1'' minimum\ndistance decoding algorithm is provided.\n","Comment: This revised paper contains some minor changes and clarifications"]}]

Indirect information about relative rates and other\nintrinsic parameters of these three basic processes is contained in the\nproteome-wide distribution of sequence identities of pairs of paralogous\nproteins. We introduce a simple mathematical framework based on a stochastic\nbirth-and-death model that allows one to extract some of this information and\napply it to the set of all pairs of paralogous proteins in seven model\norganisms. It was found that the histogram of sequence identities p generated\nby an all-to-all alignment of all protein sequences encoded in a genome is well\nfitted with a power-law form ~p^(-gamma) with the value of the exponent gamma\naround 4 for the majority of organisms used in this study.
