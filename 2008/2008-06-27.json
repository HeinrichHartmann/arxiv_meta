The first aim of the work is to test how the present Langevin model is\nable to describe this phenomenon and to outline the physical as- pects which\nplay a major role in particle deposition. The general features and\ncharacteristics of the present stochastic model are first recalled. Then,\nresults obtained with the standard form of the model are presented along with\nan analysis which has been carried out to check the sensitivity of the\npredictions on different mean fluid quantities. These results show that the\nphysical repre- sentation of the near-wall physics has to be improved and that,\nin particular, one possible route is to introduce specific features related to\nthe near-wall coherent structures. In the following, we propose a simple\nphenomenological model that introduces some of the effects due to the presence\nof turbulent coherent structures on particles in a thin layer close to the\nwall. The results obtained with this phenomenological model are in good\nagreement with experimental evidence and this suggests to pursue in that\ndirection, towards the development of more general and rigorous stochastic\nmodels that provide a link between a geometrical description of turbulent flow\nand a statistical one.\n","Comment: 40 pages, 8 figures"]}]

For\ninvariance to be preserved in the newly stated theory, the covariant derivative\nshould be generalized, as follows.

Such a further\ndevelopment has been mainly due to the experimental and theoretical advantages\noffered by CV systems, i.e., quantum systems described by a set of observables,\nlike position and momentum, which have a continuous spectrum of eigenvalues.\nAccording to this novel trend, quantum information protocols like quantum\nteleportation have been suitably extended to the CV framework. Here, we briefly\nreview some mathematical tools relative to CV systems and we consequently\ndevelop the concepts of quantum entanglement and teleportation in the CV\nframework, by analogy with the qubit-based approach. Some connections between\nteleportation fidelity and entanglement properties of the underlying quantum\nchannel are inspected. Next, we face the study of CV quantum teleportation\nnetworks where more users share a multipartite state and an arbitrary pair of\nthem performs quantum teleportation. In this context, we show alternative\nprotocols and we investigate the optimal strategy that maximizes the\nperformance of the network.\n","Comment: Review article. 26 pages, 4 figures"]}]
