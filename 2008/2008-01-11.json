In these cases, the two spin-densities\nare correlated: the spin-minority electrons have directional bond paths with\ndeep minima in the minority density, while the spin-majority electrons fill\nthese holes, reducing bond directionality. The presence of two distinct spin\ntopologies suggests that a well-known magnetic phase transition in iron can be\nfruitfully reexamined in light of these topological changes.

The dominating elastic collisions are treated within a t-matrix\napproximation, which combines the description of weak (Born) and strong\n(unitary) impurity scattering. In the long wavelength limit a two-fluid\ndescription of both response and transport emerges. Collisions are here seen to\nexclusively dominate the relaxational dynamics of the (Bogoliubov)\nquasiparticle system and the analysis allows for a clear connection of response\nand transport phenomena. When applied to quasi-2-d superconductors like the\ncuprates, it turns out that the transport parameter associated with the Raman\nscattering intensity for B1g and B2g photon polarization is closely related to\nthe corresponding components of the shear viscosity tensor, which dominates the\nattenuation of ultrasound. At low temperatures we present analytic solutions of\nthe transport equations, resulting in a non-power-law behavior of the transport\nparameters on temperature.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 3 figures"]}]

We establish strong\nconsistency of the estimators and show them to be asymptotically normal for\nH<3/4.
