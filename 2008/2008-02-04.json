We write Maxwell's equations in Schr\\\"odinger form with the\nelectromagnetic propagator playing the role of the Hamiltonian.

Entanglement is at the\nheart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for\napplications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably,\nentanglement can be \"swapped\": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs\nA1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a \"Bell-State\nMeasurement\", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled\nstate, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common\npast[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],\nbut here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,\nas originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp\nsynchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the\ncoherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased,\nexceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be\nreplaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing\nfor the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment\nexploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the\nefficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear\ncrystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters.

A finite backscattered current at finite edge-bias is explained\nfrom a Landauer-Buttiker analysis as arising from the splitting of edge current\ncaused by the difference in the filling fractions of the bulk ($\\nu_{1}$) and\nconstriction ($\\nu_{2}$) quantum Hall fluid regions. We develop a hydrodynamic\ntheory for bosonic edge modes inspired by this model. The constriction region\nsplits the incident long-wavelength chiral edge density-wave excitations among\nthe transmitting and reflecting edge states encircling it. The competition\nbetween two interedge tunneling processes taking place inside the constriction,\nrelated by a quasiparticle-quasihole (qp-qh) symmetry, is accounted for by\ncomputing the boundary theories of the system. This competition is found to\ndetermine the strong coupling configuration of the system. A separatrix of\nqp-qh symmetric gapless critical states is found to lie between the relevant RG\nflows to a metallic and an insulating configuration of the constriction system.\nThis constitutes an interesting generalisation of the Kane-Fisher quantum\nimpurity model. The features of the RG phase diagram are also confirmed by\ncomputing various correlators and chiral linear conductances of the system. In\nthis way, our results find excellent agreement with many recent puzzling\nexperimental results for the cases of $\\nu_{1}=1/3,~1$. We also discuss and\nmake predictions for the case of a constriction system with $\\nu_{2}=5/2$.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 9 figures"]}]

While the regular fast\nconvolution of vectors $V_1,V_2$ whose sizes are $N_1,N_2$ respectively, takes\n$O(N_1 \\log N_2)$ using FFT, using the new technique for length reduction, the\nalgorithm proposed in \\cite{LR07} performs the convolution in $O(n_1 \\log^3\nn_1)$, where $n_1$ is the number of non-zero values in $V_1$. The algorithm\nassumes that $V_1$ is given in advance, and $V_2$ is given in running time. The\nnovel technique presented in this paper improves the convolution time to $O(n_1\n\\log^2 n_1)$ {\\sl deterministically}, which equals the best running time given\nachieved by a {\\sl randomized} algorithm.\n  The preprocessing time of the new technique remains the same as the\npreprocessing time of \\cite{LR07}, which is $O(n_1^2)$. This assumes and deals\nthe case where $N_1$ is polynomial in $n_1$. In the case where $N_1$ is\nexponential in $n_1$, a reduction to a polynomial case can be used. In this\npaper we also improve the preprocessing time of this reduction from $O(n_1^4)$\nto $O(n_1^3{\\rm polylog}(n_1))$.\n","Comment: 7 pages"]}]

A general formula for this covering is\nderived, and is used to reduce certain hyperelliptic integrals to elliptic\nones. Degeneracies between band edges, which can occur if the Lam\\'e equation\nparameters take complex values, are investigated. If the Lam\\'e equation is\nviewed as a differential equation on an elliptic curve, a formula is\nconjectured for the number of points in elliptic moduli space (elliptic curve\nparameter space) at which degeneracies occur. Tables of spectral polynomials\nand Lam\\'e polynomials, i.e., band edge solutions, are given. A table in the\nolder literature is corrected.\n","Comment: 38 pages, 1 figure; final revisions"]}]

This work is concerned by the de\nBroglie-Bohm account of the properties of semiclassical systems. Semiclassical\nsystems are quantum systems that display the manifestation of classical\ntrajectories: the wavefunction and the observable properties of such systems\ndepend on the trajectories of the classical counterpart of the quantum system.\nFor example the quantum properties have a regular or disordered aspect\ndepending on whether the underlying classical system has regular or chaotic\ndynamics. In contrast, Bohmian trajectories in semiclassical systems have\nlittle in common with the trajectories of the classical counterpart, creating a\ndynamical mismatch relative to the quantum-classical correspondence visible in\nthese systems. Our aim is to describe this mismatch (explicit illustrations are\ngiven), explain its origin, and examine some of the consequences on the status\nof Bohmian trajectories in semiclassical systems. We argue in particular that\nsemiclassical systems put stronger constraints on the empirical acceptability\nand plausibility of Bohmian trajectories because the usual arguments given to\ndismiss the mismatch between the classical and the de Broglie-Bohm motions are\nweakened by the occurrence of classical trajectories in the quantum\nwavefunction of such systems.\n","Comment: Figures downgraded to low resolution.
