HCN emission is a star formation indicator,\ntracing dense molecular hydrogen gas (n(H2) >= 10^4 cm^-3) within star-forming\nmolecular clouds. No emission was detected in the deep interferometer maps of\nJ1148+5251. We derive a limit for the HCN line luminosity of L'(HCN) < 3.3 x\n10^9 K km/s pc^2, corresponding to a HCN/CO luminosity ratio of L'(HCN)/L'(CO)\n< 0.13. This limit is consistent with a fraction of dense molecular gas in\nJ1148+5251 within the range of nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs;\nmedian value: L'(HCN)/L'(CO) = 0.17 {+0.05/-0.08}) and HCN-detected z>2\ngalaxies (0.17 {+0.09/-0.08}). The relationship between L'(HCN) and L(FIR) is\nconsidered to be a measure for the efficiency at which stars form out of dense\ngas. In the nearby universe, these quantities show a linear correlation, and\nthus, a practically constant average ratio. In J1148+5251, we find\nL(FIR)/L'(HCN) > 6600. This is significantly higher than the average ratios for\nnormal nearby spiral galaxies (L(FIR)/L'(HCN) = 580 {+510/-270}) and ULIRGs\n(740 {+505/-50}), but consistent with a rising trend as indicated by other z>2\ngalaxies (predominantly quasars; 1525 {+1300/-475}). It is unlikely that this\nrising trend can be accounted for by a contribution of AGN heating to L(FIR)\nalone, and may hint at a higher median gas density and/or elevated\nstar-formation efficiency toward the more luminous high-redshift systems. There\nis marginal evidence that the L(FIR)/L'(HCN) ratio in J1148+5251 may even\nexceed the rising trend set by other z>2 galaxies; however, only future\nfacilities with very large collecting areas such as the SKA will offer the\nsensitivity required to further investigate this question.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, to appear in ApJL (accepted October 24,\n  2007)"]}]
