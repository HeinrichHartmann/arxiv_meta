Firstly, the fundamental theorem of skew invariant theory for the\nsymplectic group giving the generators and relations of symplectic invariants\nis established. The relations are the so called P_n relations which appear in\nthe study of certain 3-manifold invariants. Next a class of cohomology groups\nare introduced, called Pluri-Hodge groups (somewhat in keeping with the notion\nof pluri-canonical groups). These are Dolbeault groups on a complex manifold X\nwith values in tensor powers of sheaves of holomorphic forms of various\ndegrees. By Riemann-Roch one shows that knowledge of the Pluri-Hodge groups\ngives precise formulae for all Chern numbers of the manifold. When X is\nholomorphic symplectic the Pluri-Hodge groups form representations of Sp(g)\nwhere g counts the number of tensor products. Still with X holomorphic\nsymplectic, the Pluri-Hodge groups are vectors in the vector space H_g(X) of\nstates in the topological field theory of Rozansky and Witten for a 3-manifold\nwith boundary a Riemann surface of genus g.
