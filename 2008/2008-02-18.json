Variants of\nthese games - defined by the type of moves allowed for the players - have been\nfound to be closely connected to graph decompositions and associated width\nmeasures such as path- or tree-width. Of particular interest is the question\nwhether these games are monotone, i.e. whether the cops can catch a robber\nwithout ever allowing the robber to reach positions that have been cleared\nbefore. The monotonicity problem for graph searching games has intensely been\nstudied in the literature, but for two types of games the problem was left\nunresolved. These are the games on digraphs where the robber is invisible and\nlazy or visible and fast. In this paper, we solve the problems by giving\nexamples showing that both types of games are non-monotone. Graph searching\ngames on digraphs are closely related to recent proposals for digraph\ndecompositions generalising tree-width to directed graphs. These proposals have\npartly been motivated by attempts to develop a structure theory for digraphs\nsimilar to the graph minor theory developed by Robertson and Seymour for\nundirected graphs, and partly by the immense number of algorithmic results\nusing tree-width of undirected graphs and the hope that part of this success\nmight be reproducible on digraphs using a directed tree-width.

The graded multiplicity spaces appearing in the decomposition\nof the fusion product into irreducible sl(n)-modules are identified with the\nmultiplicity spaces of the Specht modules in R(mu). This proves that the Kostka\npolynomial gives the character of the fusion product in this case. In the case\nof the product of fundamental evaluation modules, we give the precise\ncorrespondence with the reduced wedge product, and thus the usual wedge space\nconstruction of irreducible level-1 ^sl(n)-modules in the limit N->infty.
