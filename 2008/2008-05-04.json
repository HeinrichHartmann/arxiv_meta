After a short introduction to\nthe basic elements of QCD in the vacuum, most notably quark confinement and\nmass generation, we discuss how these phenomena relate to phase changes in\nstrongly interacting matter at high temperature. We briefly review the main\nexperimental findings at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) which\nprovide strong evidence that a QGP has been produced, with unprecedentedly\nsmall viscosity and large opacity. We discuss how heavy quarks (charm and\nbottom) can be utilized to quantitatively probe the transport properties of a\nstrongly coupled QGP (sQGP). The large heavy-quark (HQ) mass allows to set up a\nBrownian motion approach, which can serve to evaluate different approaches for\nHQ interactions in the sQGP. The implementation of lattice QCD based HQ\npotentials generates pre-hadronic resonance structures in HQ scattering in the\nmedium, leading to large interaction rates and small diffusion coefficients.\nThe resonance correlations are strongest close to the critical temperature\n(T_c), suggesting an intimate connection to the hadronization of the QGP. The\nimplementation of HQ transport into Langevin simulations of an expanding QGP\nfireball at RHIC enables quantitative comparisons with experiment. The\nextracted HQ diffusion coefficients are employed for schematic estimates of the\nshear viscosity, corroborating the notion of a strongly-coupled QGP in the\nvicinity of T_c.\n","Comment: Review article, 56 pages, 33 figures, v2: some typos corrected,\n  reference added"]}]
