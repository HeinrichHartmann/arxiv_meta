In this paper is presented the idea\nof cheap artificial inflatable mountains, which may cardinally change the\nclimate of a large region or country. Additional benefits: The potential of\ntapping large amounts of fresh water and energy. The mountains are inflatable\nsemi-cylindrical constructions from thin film (gas bags) having heights of up\nto 3 - 5 km. They are located perpendicular to the main wind direction.\nEncountering these artificial mountains, humid air (wind) rises to crest\naltitude, is cooled and produces rain (or rain clouds). Many natural mountains\nare sources of rivers, and other forms of water and power production - and\nartificial mountains may provide these services for entire nations in the\nfuture. The film of these gasbags is supported at altitude by small additional\natmospheric overpressure and may be connected to the ground by thin cables. The\nauthor has shown (in previous works about the AB-Dome) that this closed AB-Dome\nallows full control of the weather inside the Dome (the day is always fine, the\nrain is only at night, no strong winds) and influence to given region. This is\na realistic and cheap method of economical irrigation, getting energy and\nvirtual weather control on Earth at the current time.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 20 figures, 4 tables.

We\nargue that the substrate-free experiments done in the diffusive regime are\nconsistent with our theory and verify many of our earlier predictions including\n(i) removal of the substrate will increase mobility since most of the charged\nimpurities are in the substrate, (ii) the minimum conductivity is not\nuniversal, but depends on impurity concentration with cleaner samples having a\nhigher minimum conductivity. We further argue that experiments on suspended\ngraphene put strong constraints on the two parameters involved in our theory,\nnamely, the charged impurity concentration n_imp and d, the typical distance of\na charged impurity from the graphene sheet. The recent experiments on suspended\ngraphene indicate a residual impurity density of 1-2 \\times 10^{10} cm^{-2}\nwhich are presumably stuck to the graphene interface, compared to impurity\ndensities of ~10^{12} cm^{-2} for graphene on SiO_2 substrate.
