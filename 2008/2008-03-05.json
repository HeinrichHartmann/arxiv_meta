Since only the spin degrees of freedom are involved in\nthe Kondo interaction, and due to spin-charge separation in 1D, the universal\nlow energy long distance physics of the Kondo model also arises when a magnetic\nimpurity is coupled to the end of a gap-less antiferromagnetic J_1-J_2 spin-1/2\nchain, where J_1(J_2) is the (next-)nearest neighbor coupling. Experimental\nrealizations of such spin chain models are possible and using various\nanalytical and numerical techniques, we present a detailed and quantitative\ncomparison between the usual free electron Kondo model and such spin chain\nversions of the Kondo problem. For the gap-less J_1-J_2 spin chain two cases\nare studied, with zero next nearest neighbor coupling, J_2=0, and with a\ncritical second neighbor coupling, J_2=J_2c. We first focus on the spin chain\nimpurity model at J_2c~0.2412 where a bulk marginal coupling present in the\nspin chain model for J_2<J_2c vanishes. At J_2c, the usual Kondo physics is\nrecovered in the spin chain model in the low energy regime. We then analyze the\nnearest-neighbor model (J_2=0) where a new kind of Kondo effect occurs due to\nthe presence of the bulk marginal coupling. This marginal coupling leads to a\nslower variation of the Kondo temperature T_K with the bare Kondo coupling. In\nthe exact Bethe ansatz solution of this spin chain impurity model (J_2=0) Frahm\nand Zvyagin noted this relation as well as the connection to the Kondo problem.\nHere, we provide further evidence for the connection to Kondo physics and\npresent low temperature QMC results for the impurity susceptibility that\nfurther support this connection.\n","Comment: 32 Pages, 11 Figures, JSTAT macros"]}]

To describe the latter, vortices in turbulent flow are modelled\nwith stable vortex filaments. While this is an idealization in classical\nfluids, vortices are real topologically stable quantized objects in\nsuperfluids. Thus superfluid turbulence is thought to hold the key to new\nunderstanding on turbulence in general. The fermion superfluid 3He offers\nfurther possibilities owing to a large variation in its hydrodynamic\ncharacteristics over the experimentally accessible temperatures. While studying\nthe hydrodynamics of the B phase of superfluid 3He, we discovered a sharp\ntransition at 0.60Tc between two regimes, with regular behaviour at\nhigh-temperatures and turbulence at low-temperatures. Unlike in classical\nfluids, this transition is insensitive to velocity and occurs at a temperature\nwhere the dissipative vortex damping drops below a critical limit. This\ndiscovery resolves the conflict between existing high- and low-temperature\nmeasurements in 3He-B: At high temperatures in rotating flow a vortex loop\ninjected into superflow has been observed to expand monotonically to a single\nrectilinear vortex line, while at very low temperatures a tangled network of\nquantized vortex lines can be generated in a quiescent bath with a vibrating\nwire.
