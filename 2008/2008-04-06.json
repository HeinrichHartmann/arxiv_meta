Each image contains the nucleus and covers at least 10^6 km of each\ncomet's orbit. Debris trails due to mm-sized or larger particles were found\nalong the orbits of 27 comets; 4 comets had small-particle dust tails and a\nviewing geometry that made debris trails impossible to distinguish; and only 3\nhad no debris trail despite favorable observing conditions. There are now 30\nJupiter-family comets with known debris trails, of which 22 are reported in\nthis paper for the first time. The detection rate is >80%, indicating that\ndebris trails are a generic feature of short-period comets. By comparison to\norbital calculations for particles of a range of sizes ejected over 2 yr prior\nto observation, we find that particles comprising 4 debris trails are typically\nmm-sized while the remainder of the debris trails require particles larger than\nthis. The lower-limit masses of the debris trails are typically 10^11 g, and\nthe median mass loss rate is 2 kg/s. The mass-loss rate in trail particles is\ncomparable to that inferred from OH production rates and larger than that\ninferred from visible-light scattering in comae.\n","Comment: accepted by Icarus; figures compressed for astro-ph"]}]

We obtain adjustments\nto the Birnbaum--Saunders profile likelihood function. The modified versions of\nthe likelihood function were obtained for both the shape and scale parameters,\ni.e., we take the shape parameter to be of interest and the scale parameter to\nbe of nuisance, and then consider the situation in which the interest lies in\nperforming inference on the scale parameter with the shape parameter entering\nthe modeling in nuisance fashion. Modified profile maximum likelihood\nestimators are obtained by maximizing the corresponding adjusted likelihood\nfunctions. We present numerical evidence on the finite sample behavior of the\ndifferent estimators and associated likelihood ratio tests. The results favor\nthe adjusted estimators and tests we propose. A novel aspect of the profile\nlikelihood adjustments obtained in this paper is that they yield improved point\nestimators and tests. The two profile likelihood adjustments work well when\ninference is made on the shape parameter, and one of them displays superior\nbehavior when it comes to performing hypothesis testing inference on the scale\nparameter. Two empirical applications are briefly presented.\n","Comment: Paper accepted for publication in Computational Statistics and Data\n  Analysis"]}]
