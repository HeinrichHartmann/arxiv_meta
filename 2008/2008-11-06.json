The corresponding hydrostatic\nequilibria are most relevant to the dynamics of the protosolar nebula before\nand during the stages of planet and satellite formation. The nonrotating\nsolution for the mass density is analytic, nonsingular, monotonically\ndecreasing with radius, and it satisfies easily the usual physical boundary\nconditions at the center. When differential rotation is added to the\nLane--Emden equation, an entire class of exact solutions for the mass density\nappears. We have determined all of these solutions analytically as well. Within\nthis class, solutions that are power laws or combinations of power laws are not\ncapable of satisfying the associated boundary--value problem, but they are\nnonetheless of profound importance because they constitute \"baselines\" to which\nthe actual solutions approach when the central boundary conditions are imposed.\nNumerical integrations that enforce such physical boundary conditions show that\nthe actual radial equilibrium density profiles emerge from the center close to\nthe nonrotating solution, but once they cross below the corresponding\nbaselines, they cease to be monotonic. The actual solutions are forced to\noscillate permanently about the baseline solutions without ever settling onto\nthem because the central boundary conditions strictly prohibit such settling,\neven in the asymptotic regime of large radii. Based on our results, we expect\nthat quasistatically--evolving protoplanetary disks should develop oscillatory\ndensity profiles in their midplanes during their isothermal phase.

In general, a change of\nvariables leads to new Riesz means that contain different information from the\nold ones. In particular, for the standard second-order elliptic operators,\nRiesz means with respect to the square root of the spectral parameter\ncorrespond to terms in the asymptotics of elliptic and hyperbolic Green\nfunctions associated with the operator, and these quantities contain \"nonlocal\"\ninformation not contained in the usual Riesz means and their correlates in the\nheat kernel.
