The balance between the exciton and the\nfree carrier populations within the electron-hole plasma is discussed in terms\nof ionization degree in the nondegenerate regime. Assuming a two-dimensional\nCoulomb potential statically screened by the free carrier gas, we apply the\nvariable phase method to obtain the excitonic wavefunctions, which we use to\ncalculate the 1$s$ exciton--free carrier matrix elements that describe the\nscattering of excitons into the light cone where they can radiatively\nrecombine. The photon emission rates due to the carrier-assisted exciton\nrecombination in semiconductor quantum-wells (QWs) at room temperature and in a\nlow density regime are obtained from Fermi's golden rule, and studied for\nmid-gap and wide-gap materials. The quantitative comparison of the direct and\nexchange terms of the scattering matrix elements shows that fermion exchange is\nthe dominant mechanism of the exciton--carrier scattering process. This is\nconfirmed by our analysis of the rates of photon emission induced by\nelectron-assisted and hole-assisted exciton recombinations.\n","Comment: Thoroughly revised version of previous work.
