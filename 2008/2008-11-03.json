In most previous studies only detached populations of\ncompact object binaries have been considered. Here, we investigate the\ninfluence of Galactic populations of compact mass transferring binaries on the\nshape and strength of the LISA signal and compare our results with the signal\nfor detached binaries only. Our population synthesis includes all binary\nsystems containing two compact remnants.

We find that\nthe mass transferring binaries contributing to the confusion limited noise\ndominate the population of LISA systems by number (60%), due to their long\nlifetimes (few Gyrs). However, due to the very specific physical properties of\nmass transferring systems, it is found that their contribution to the noise is\nnegligible at low frequencies and detached systems will set the magnitude of\nthe confusion-limited signal in this range. However, the mass transferring\nsystems begin to dominate the signal at higher frequencies (f>6 mHz).

Strictness of the Morita context is\nshown to imply the Galois property of $\\Sigma$ as a $\\cC$-comodule and a Weak\nStructure Theorem. Sufficient conditions are found also for a Strong Structure\nTheorem to hold.\n  Cleft property of an $L$-$\\cC$ bicomodule $\\Sigma$ -- implying strictness of\nthe associated Morita context -- is introduced. It is shown to be equivalent to\nbeing a Galois $\\cC$-comodule and isomorphic to $\\End^\\cC(\\Sigma)\\otimes_{L}\n\\cD$, in the category of left modules for the ring $\\End^\\cC(\\Sigma)$ and right\ncomodules for the coring $\\cD$, i.e. satisfying the normal basis property.\n  Algebra extensions, that are cleft extensions by a Hopf algebra, a coalgebra\nor a pure Hopf algebroid, as well as cleft entwining structures (over\ncommutative or non-commutative base rings) and cleft weak entwining structures,\nare shown to provide examples of cleft bicomodules.\n  Cleft extensions by arbitrary Hopf algebroids are described in terms of\nMorita contexts that do not necessarily correspond to coring extensions.\n","Comment: 34 pages LaTeX. v2:A missing purity assumption is added throughout\n  Sections 3, 4 and 5"]}]

Up to now only two cases have been described completely.\nThe complete picture for the hook case has been obtained by\n  N. Spaltenstein and J.A. Vargas, and for two-row case by\n  F.Y.C. Fung. They have shown in particular that the intersection of a pair of\ncomponents of a Springer fiber is either irreducible or empty. In both cases\nall the components are non-singular and the irreducibility of the intersections\nis strongly related to the non-singularity. As it has been shown in [8] a\nbijection between orbital varieties and components of the corresponding\nSpringer fiber in GL_n extends to a bijection between the irreducible\ncomponents of the intersections of orbital varieties and the irreducible\ncomponents of the intersections of components of Springer fiber preserving\ntheir codimensions. Here we use this bijection to compute the intersections of\nthe irreducible components of Springer fibers for two-column case. In this case\nthe components are in general singular. As we show the intersection of two\ncomponents is non-empty. The main result of the paper is a necessary and\nsufficient condition for the intersection of two components of the Springer\nfiber to be irreducible in two-column case. The condition is purely\ncombinatorial. As an application of this characterization, we give first\nexamples of pairs of componentswith a reducible intersection having components\nof different dimensions.\n","Comment: 20 pages; the final version, to appear in Indagationes Mathematicae"]}]
