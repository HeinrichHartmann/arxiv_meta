The calculations are based on\ndensity functional theory and the local density approximation. We use the\naugmented spherical wave (ASW) method. The observed alternation of low- and\nhigh-spin states along the Co-Rh and Fe-Rh chains is related to differences in\nthe oxygen coordination of the transition metal sites. Due to strong\nhybridization the O 2p states are polarized, giving rise to extended localized\nmagnetic moments centered at the high-spin sites. Strong metal-metal overlap\nalong the chains leads to a substantial contribution of the low-spin Rh\n4d_{3z^2-r^2} orbitals to the exchange coupling of the extended moments.\nInterestingly, this mechanism holds for both compounds, even though the\ncoupling is ferromagnetic for the cobalt and antiferromagnetic for the iron\ncompound.

Finally, we provide a series of benchmark\nsimulations of different types of networks of spiking neurons, including\nHodgkin-Huxley type, integrate-and-fire models, interacting with current-based\nor conductance-based synapses, using clock-driven or event-driven integration\nstrategies.
