This belief is supported by the discovery that a\nnoiseless (pure) state quantum computer must generate a large amount of\nentanglement in order to offer any speed up over a classical computer. However,\ndeterministic quantum computation with one pure qubit (DQC1), which employs\nnoisy (mixed) states, is an efficient model that generates at most a marginal\namount of entanglement. Although this model cannot implement any arbitrary\nalgorithm it can efficiently solve a range of problems of significant\nimportance to the scientific community. Here we experimentally implement a\nfirst-order case of a key DQC1 algorithm and explicitly characterise the\nnon-classical correlations generated. Our results show that while there is no\nentanglement the algorithm does give rise to other non-classical correlations,\nwhich we quantify using the quantum discord - a stronger measure of\nnon-classical correlations that includes entanglement as a subset. Our results\nsuggest that discord could replace entanglement as a necessary resource for a\nquantum computational speed-up. Furthermore, DQC1 is far less resource\nintensive than universal quantum computing and our implementation in a scalable\narchitecture highlights the model as a practical short-term goal.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures"]}]
