The purpose of this paper is to extend this approach in the case of\nan arbitrary totally real field, which necessitates an appeal of\nJacquet-Langlands' theory and the adelization of the problem. To show that the\n$L$-function (resp. its derivative) of a positive density of forms does not\nvanish at 1/2, we follow Selberg's method of mollified moments (Iwaniec,\nSarnak, Kowalski, Michel and VanderKam among others applied it successfully in\nthe case of classical modular forms). We generalize the Petersson formula, and\nuse it to estimate the first two harmonic moments, this then allows us to match\nthe same unconditional densities as the ones proved over $\\Q$ by Kowalski,\nMichel and VanderKam. In this setting, there is an additional term, coming from\nold forms, to control. Finally we convert our estimates for the harmonic\nmoments into ones for the natural moments.\n","Comment: 97 pages"]}]

Neither of the four known fundamental\ninteractions can account for this repulsive force. Gravity is known to be the\ninteraction responsible for the large scale structure and evolution of the\nUniverse. The problem with gravity is that it gives rise to a force which is\nattractive only. Gravity theories, including General Relativity, deals with\ngravity as an attractive force. Although this is consistent with our experience\nin the solar system and other similar astrophysical systems, gravity theories\nfail to account for SN type Ia observation. So, we are in a real problem\nconcerning the interpretation of these observation. This problem is only ten\nyears old. In order to go out of this problematic situation, scientists have\nsuggested the existence of a type of energy in the Universe that is responsible\nfor the above mentioned repulsive force. They have given this type of energy\nthe exotic term {\\it \"Dark Energy\"}. Although this type of energy forms more\nthan two thirds of the energetic contents of our Universe, its reasonable\nnature is missing in all gravity theories.\n  The aim of the present work is to review the present status of the problem of\ndark energy. Also, to suggest a new geometric solution for this problem.\n","Comment: 9 pages, LaTeX- file.

The\nfundamental tradeoffs between individual frame rates, individual frame\ndistortions, and encoding/decoding frame-delays are derived in terms of a\nsingle-letter information-theoretic characterization of the rate-distortion\nregion for general inter-frame source correlations and certain types of\npotentially frame specific and coupled single-letter fidelity criteria. The\nsum-rate-distortion region is characterized in terms of generalized directed\ninformation measures highlighting their role in delayed sequential source\ncoding problems. For video sources which are spatially stationary memoryless\nand temporally Gauss-Markov, MSE frame distortions, and a sum-rate constraint,\nour results expose the optimality of idealized differential predictive coding\namong all causal sequential coders, when the encoder uses a positive rate to\ndescribe each frame. Somewhat surprisingly, causal sequential encoding with\none-frame-delayed noncausal sequential decoding can exactly match the\nsum-rate-MSE performance of joint coding for all nontrivial MSE-tuples\nsatisfying certain positive semi-definiteness conditions. Thus, even a single\nframe-delay holds potential for yielding significant performance improvements.\nGeneralizations to higher order Markov sources are also presented and\ndiscussed.
