The basic\nidea underlying the new perspective is to exploit the fact that, typically, the\nlegacy channel is not fully loaded by the legacy service, thus leaving a\nnon-negligible margin to accommodate the cognitive transmission. The\nexploitation of such a load margin is optimized by shaping the spectrum of the\ntransmitted cognitive signal. It is shown that non-trivial coexistence of\nlegacy and cognitive systems is possible even without sharing the legacy\nmessage with the cognitive transmitter. Surprisingly, the optimized cognitive\ntransmitter is no longer limited by its interference power at the legacy\nreceiver, and can always transmit at its full available device power.\nAnalytical development and numerical illustration are presented, in particular\nfocusing on the logarithmic growth rate, {\\it i.e.}, the prelog coefficient, of\ncognitive transmission in the high-power regime.\n","Comment: To appear in DySPAN'08"]}]
