Benefiting from the extreme-value theoretic results of\n\\cite{Oyman_isit07}, we characterize the power-bandwidth tradeoff and the\nassociated energy and spectral efficiency measures of the bandwidth-limited\nhigh signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and power-limited low SNR regimes, and utilize\nthem in investigating the large system behavior of the multiuser relay channel\nas a function of the number of users and physical channel SNRs. Our analysis\nresults in very accurate closed-form formulas in the large (but finite) $K$\nregime that quantify energy and spectral efficiency performance, and provides\ninsights on the impact of multihop relaying and multiuser diversity techniques\non the power-bandwidth tradeoff.\n","Comment: 7 pages, to appear in Proc. of 46th Annual Allerton Conference on\n  Communication, Control and Computing, Monticello, IL, U.S.A., Sep. 2008"]}]

We call\nthis class of control problems Ensemble Control, a notion coming from the study\nof spin dynamics in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and imaging\n(MRI). This subject involves controlling a continuum of parameterized dynamical\nsystems with the same open-loop control input. From a viewpoint of mathematical\ncontrol theory, this class of problems is challenging because it requires\nsteering a continuum of dynamical systems between points of interest in an\ninfinite dimensional state space by use of the same control function. The\nexistence of such a control raises fundamental questions of ensemble\ncontrollability. We derive the necessary and sufficient controllability\nconditions and an accompanying analytical optimal control law for ensemble\ncontrol of time-varying linear systems. We show that ensemble controllability\nis in connection with singular values of the operator characterizing the system\ndynamics. In addition, we study the problem of optimal ensemble control of\nharmonic oscillators to demonstrate our main results. We show that the optimal\nsolutions are pertinent to the study of time-frequency limited signals and\nprolate spheroidal wave functions. A systematic study of ensemble control\nsystems has immediate applications to systems with parameter uncertainties as\nwell as to broad areas of quantum control systems as arising in coherent\nspectroscopy and quantum information processing. The new mathematical\nstructures appearing in such problems are an excellent motivation for new\ndevelopments in control theory.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 5 figures"]}]
