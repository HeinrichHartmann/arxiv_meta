I develop a quantitative\ntheory for the market impact of hidden orders (orders that reflect the true\nintention of buying and selling) that matches the empirically measured result\nand that reproduces some of the non-trivial and universal properties of stock\nreturns (returns are percent changes in stock price). The theory is based on a\nsimple premise, that the stock market can be modeled in a mechanical way - as a\ndevice that translates order flow into an uncorrelated price stream. Given that\norder flow is highly autocorrelated, this premise requires that market impact\n(1) depends on past order flow and (2) is asymmetric for buying and selling.

A linear system on a\nhomogeneous space is a system whose drift part is affine and whose controlled\npart is invariant.

By varying these properties in a class of models,\nwe find that the mass hierarchy of collisional parton energy loss can be\nmodified considerably and can even be inverted, compared to that of radiative\nparton energy loss.

We conjecture that in times of speculative\nexcitement, short-term investors may instinctively imagine stock prices to be\nevolving in a time measure different from that of calendar time.

This measures\nhow well (or how bad) the asset performs over that given period of time. It has\nbeen established that the distribution of returns exhibits ``fat tails''\nindicating that large returns occur more frequently than what is expected from\nstandard Gaussian stochastic processes (Mandelbrot-1967,Stanley1,Doyne).\nInstead of estimating this ``fat tail'' distribution of returns, we propose\nhere an alternative approach, which is outlined by addressing the following\nquestion: What is the smallest time interval needed for an asset to cross a\nfixed return level of say 10%? For a particular asset, we refer to this time as\nthe {\\it investment horizon} and the corresponding distribution as the {\\it\ninvestment horizon distribution}. This latter distribution complements that of\nreturns and provides new and possibly crucial information for portfolio design\nand risk-management, as well as for pricing of more exotic options. By\nconsidering historical financial data, exemplified by the Dow Jones Industrial\nAverage, we obtain a novel set of probability distributions for the investment\nhorizons which can be used to estimate the optimal investment horizon for a\nstock or a future contract.\n","Comment: Latex, 5 pages including 4 figurs"]}]

Our\nnew analysis shows clearly that price impact and volume are related by a\nsquare-root functional form of market impact for large volumes, in contrast to\nthe claim of FL that this relationship increases as a power law with a smaller\nexponent. Since large orders are usually executed by splitting into smaller\nsize trades, procedures used by FL give a downward bias for this power law\nexponent. Second, FL analyze 3 stocks traded on the London Stock Exchange, and\nsolely on this basis they claim that the distribution of transaction volumes do\nnot have a power-law tail for the London Stock Exchange.

We give some financial\nexamples covered by (b) but note that most practical cases of poor Monte Carlo\nperformance, Digital Cliquet contracts for instance, can be dealt with by the\nextended BEL formula and hence without any reliance on Malliavin calculus at\nall. We then discuss some of the approximations, often ignored in the\nliterature, needed to justify the use of the Malliavin weights in the context\nof standard jump diffusion models. Finally, as all this is meant to improve\nnumerics, we give some numerical results with focus on Cliquets under the\nHeston model with jumps.\n"]}]

The\nleptokurtic portfolio theory provides an optimal portfolio for investors, who\ndefine their risk-aversion as unwillingness to experience sharp drawdowns in\nasset prices. Two types of risks in asset returns are defined: a fluctuation\nrisk, that has Gaussian distribution, and a drawdown risk, that deals with\ndistribution tails. These risks are quantitatively measured by defining the\n\"noise kernel\" -- an ellipsoidal cloud of points in the space of asset returns.\nThe size of the ellipse is controlled with the threshold parameter: the larger\nthe threshold parameter, the larger return are accepted for investors as normal\nfluctuations. The return vectors falling into the kernel are used for\ncalculation of fluctuation risk. Analogously, the data points falling outside\nthe kernel are used for the calculation of drawdown risks. As a result the\nportfolio optimisation problem becomes three-dimensional: in addition to the\nreturn, there are two types of risks involved. Optimal portfolio for\ndrawdown-averse investors is the portfolio minimising variance outside the\nnoise kernel.

At longer times, the exponential law\ncontinuously evolves into Gaussian distribution.\n  After characterizing the stock returns at mesoscopic time lags, we study the\nsubordination hypothesis. The integrated volatility V_t constructed from the\nnumber of trades process can be used as a subordinator for a Brownian motion.\nThis subordination is able to describe approximatly 85% of the stock returns\nfor time lags that start at 1 hour but are shorter than one day. Finally, we\nshow that the CIR process describes well enough the empirical V_t process, such\nthat the corresponding Heston model is able to describe the log-returns x_t\nprocess, with approximately the maximum quality that the subordination allows.\n  Finally, we study the time evolution of the personal income distribution.

In this paper we summarize these areas as statistical\ndistribution, economic mobility, transfer rate and money creation. First, money\ndistribution (or income distribution) can be exhibited by recording the money\nstock (flow). Second, the economic mobility can be shown by tracing the change\nin wealth or income over time for each agent. Third, the transfer rate of money\nand its determinants can be analyzed by tracing the transferring process of\neach one unit of money.

We present new\nevidence that shows that efficiency is maintained by a liquidity imbalance that\nco-moves with the imbalance of buyer vs. seller initiated transactions. For\nexample, during a period where there is an excess of buyer initiated\ntransactions, there is also more liquidity for buy orders than sell orders, so\nthat buy orders generate smaller and less frequent price responses than sell\norders. At the moment a buy order is placed the transaction sign imbalance\ntends to dominate, generating a price impact. However, the liquidity imbalance\nrapidly increases with time, so that after a small number of time steps it\ncancels all the inefficiency caused by the transaction sign imbalance, bounding\nthe price impact. While the view presented by Bouchaud et al. of a fixed and\ntemporary bare price impact is self-consistent and formally correct, we argue\nthat viewing this in terms of a variable but permanent price impact provides a\nsimpler and more natural view. This is in the spirit of the original conjecture\nof Lillo and Farmer, but generalized to allow for finite time lags in the build\nup of the liquidity imbalance after a transaction.

Our results show that small values of $v$\nare regularly \\emph{anti-correlated} with values at other scales of traded\nvolume. This is consistent with the high liquidity of the 30 equities analysed\nand the asymmetric form of the multi-fractal spectrum for traded volume which\nhas supported the dynamical scenario presented by us.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 2 figures"]}]

To explain these empirical facts, a\ntheory is developed that incorporates both the fluctuations of a single firm's\nsales and the statistical differences among many firms. The theory reproduces\nboth the scaling in the standard deviation and the non-Gaussian distribution of\ngrowth rates. Earlier models reproduce the same empirical features by splitting\nfirms into somewhat ambiguous subunits; by decomposing total sales into\nindividual transactions, this ambiguity is removed. The theory yields\nverifiable predictions and accommodates any form of business organization\nwithin a firm. Furthermore, because transactions are fundamental to economic\nactivity at all scales, the theory can be extended to all levels of the\neconomy, from individual products to multinational corporations.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures"]}]
