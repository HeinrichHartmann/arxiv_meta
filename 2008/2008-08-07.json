Consequently, the weight vectors are highly\nsensitive to noise. Moreover, this causes LLE to converge to a linear\nprojection of the input, as opposed to its non-linear embedding goal. To\novercome both of these problems, we propose to compute the weight vectors using\na low-dimensional neighborhood representation.

This\nconfirms the idea that large MBAs, over hundreds millions of years,have\ndeveloped a fine and thick thermally insulating regolith layer, responsible for\nthe low values of their thermal inertia, whereas km-sized asteroids, having\ncollisional lifetimes of only some millions years, have less regolith, and\nconsequently a larger surface thermal inertia. Because it is believed that\nregolith on asteroids forms as a result of impact processes, a better knowledge\nof asteroid thermal inertia values and its correlation with size, taxonomic\ntype, and density can be used as an important constraintfor modeling of impact\nprocesses on asteroids. However, our knowledge of asteroids' thermal inertia\nvalues is still based on few data points with NEAs covering the size range\n0.1-20 km and MBAs that >100 km.

It is shown that the recent\nformalism, making use of discrete approximations to derivatives of the\ntransition energies (or of the energy levels) gives results consistent with the\ntraditional formulae. In both regions it is seen that the first vanishing of\nthe staggering occurs at higher values of the angular momentum I in nuclei\nexhibiting higher staggering at low I. Since these nuclei happen to be good\nrotators, the observed slow decrease of the amplitude of the staggering with\nincreasing I is in good agreement with the parameter independent predictions of\nthe su(3) (rotational) limit of several algebraic models. In the actinides it\nhas been found that within each series of isotopes the odd-even staggering\nexhibits minima at N=134 and N=146, while a local maximum is shown at N=142,\nthese findings being in agreement with the recent suggestion of a secondary\nmaximum of octupole deformation around N=146.\n","Comment: LaTeX, 30 pages plus 14 postscript figures"]}]
