The 2\nsmallest representations of SU(2/1) adequately describe the electron, neutrino,\nup and down quarks and correlate their chiralities with their U(1) charges, and\nthe Higgs fields have the quantum numbers of the odd generators. But so far,\nthere was an apparent conflict with unitarity, because the quark representation\nis not Hermitian and the super-Killing metric is not positive definite. We\nsolve this paradox by assuming the existence of 2 complex Higgs doublets\nminimally coupled to the Fermions via the chiral projections of the odd\ngenerators of SU(2/1). We find that Lagrangian induced by the Fermion loops is\nunitary, thanks to the balance between the leptons and the quarks needed to\ncancel the triangle anomaly and that the super-Jacobi identity guarantees that\nthe photon remains massless after symmetry breaking. In addition, the\nLagrangian has a classical geometric interpretation in terms of the curvature\nof the corresponding Hermitian algebra. Assuming that the relative strength of\nthe scalar and vector couplings does not depend on the number of families\nconstrains the mass of the Higgs to $M^2_{H^0_1} + M^2_{H^0_2} = 32/9 M^2_W = 2\n(107.2 GeV)^2$.

The motivation for the\npartially connected IC comes from the fact that not all interferences are\nequally strong in practice. The MUXG is characterized as a function of the\nnumber ($K$) of users and the number ($N \\geq 1$) of interfering links. Our\nanalysis is mainly based on the interference alignment (IA) technique to\nmitigate interference. Our main results are as follows: One may expect that\nhigher MUXG can be attained when some of interfering links do not exist.\nHowever, when $N$ is odd and $K=N+2$, the MUXG is not increased beyond the\noptimal MUXG of fully connected IC, which is $\\frac{KM}{2}$. The number of\ninterfering links has no influence on the achievable MUXG using IA, but affects\nthe efficiency in terms of the number of required channel realizations: When\nN=1 or 2, the optimal MUXG of the fully connected IC is achievable with a\nfinite number of channel realizations.
