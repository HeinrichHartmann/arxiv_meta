A new class of\nnegative index metamaterials - chiral NIMs, have been recently proposed. In\ncontrast to the conventional NIMs, chiral NIMs do not require the above\ncondition, thus presenting a very robust route toward negative refraction. Here\nwe present the first experimental demonstration of a chiral metamaterial\nexhibiting negative refractive index down to n=-5 at terahertz frequencies,\nwith only a single chiral resonance.

Chiral NIM are predicted to possess\nintriguing electromagnetic properties that go beyond the traditional NIMs, such\nas opposite signs of refractive indices for the two circular polarizations and\nnegative reflection.
