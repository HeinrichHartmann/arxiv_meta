Our primary interest is the use of this ring to define and explore\nalgebraic versions of isomorphism problems of graphs, such as Ulam's\nreconstruction conjecture. There is a huge body of literature on invariant\ntheory which provides both general results and algorithms. However, there is a\ncombinatorial explosion in the computations involved and, to our knowledge, the\nring I_n has only been completely described for n<=4. This led us to study the\nring I_n in its own right. We used intensive computer exploration for small n,\nand developed PerMuVAR, a library for MuPAD, for computing in invariant rings\nof permutation groups. We present general properties of the ring I_n, as well\nas results obtained by computer exploration for small n, including the\nconstruction of a medium sized generating set for I_5. We address several\nconjectures suggested by those results (low degree system of parameters,\nunimodality), for I_n as well as for more general invariant rings. We also show\nthat some particular sets are not generating, disproving a conjecture of Pouzet\nrelated to reconstruction, as well as a lemma of Grigoriev on the invariant\nring over digraphs. We finally provide a very simple minimal generating set of\nthe field of invariants.\n"]}]

Some general properties of\nchannels of this class are described. In particular, a special sufficient\ncondition of existence of an optimal measure is obtained and examples of\nchannels with no optimal measure are constructed.\n  It is shown that each channel with finite Holevo capacity has a natural\nextension to the set of all positive normalized functionals on the algebra of\nall bounded operators. General properties of such an extension are described.\n  The class of infinite dimensional channels, for which the Holevo capacity can\nbe explicitly determined, is considered.\n","Comment: 23 pages"]}]
