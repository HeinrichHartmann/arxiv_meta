Guruswami et al. (2005) propose this\nproblem and give logarithmic approximations (in the number of consumers) when\neach consumer's values for bundles are known precisely. Subsequently several\nversions of the problem have been shown to have poly-logarithmic\ninapproximability. This problem has direct ties to the important open question\nof better understanding the Bayesian optimal mechanism in multi-parameter\nsettings; however, logarithmic approximations are inadequate for this purpose.\nIt is therefore of vital interest to consider special cases where constant\napproximations are possible. We consider the unit-demand variant of this\nproblem. Here a consumer has a valuation for each different item and their\nvalue for a set of items is simply the maximum value they have for any item in\nthe set. We assume that the preferences of the consumers are drawn from a\ndistribution, the standard assumption in economics; furthermore, the setting of\na specific set of customers with known preferences, which is employed in all\nprior work in algorithmic pricing, is a special case of this general problem,\nwhere there is a discrete Bayesian distribution for preferences specified by\npicking one consumer uniformly from the given set of consumers. Our work\ncomplements these existing works by considering the case where the consumer's\nvaluations for the different items are independent random variables. Our main\nresult is a constant approximation that makes use of an interesting connection\nbetween this problem and the concept of virtual valuations from the\nsingle-parameter Bayesian optimal mechanism design literature.\n","Comment: A preliminary version of this work appeared at the ACM EC'07\n  conference.
