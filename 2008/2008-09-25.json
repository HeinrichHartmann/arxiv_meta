The idea of syndrome-based\ndecoding and error detection is introduced for BNEC, which removes the effect\nof input data and hence decreases the complexity. Next, an efficient\nthree-stage syndrome-based BNEC decoding scheme for network error correction is\nproposed, in which prior to finding the error values, the position of the edge\nerrors are identified based on the error spaces at the receivers.

Also, a complete maximum\nlikelihood decoding scheme for BNEC is proposed. As the probability of error in\ndifferent network edges is not equal in general, and given the equivalency of\ncertain edge errors within the network at a particular receiver, the number of\nedge errors, assessed in the refined Singleton bound, is not a sufficient\nstatistic for ML decoding.\n"]}]
