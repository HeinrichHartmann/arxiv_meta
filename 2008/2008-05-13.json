Such a phase transition, accompanied by a density jump\nrho_N --> rho_S, is characterized by rho_S/rho_N > 3/2(1+P_0/rho_N c^2), where\nP_0 is the pressure, at which phase transition occurs. Configurations with\nsmall S-phase cores are then unstable and collapse into stars with large\nS-phase cores. The energy release is equal to the difference in mass-energies\nbetween the initial (normal) configuration and the final configuration\ncontaining an S-phase core, total stellar baryon mass and angular momentum\nbeing kept constant. The calculations of the energy release are based on\nprecise numerical 2-D calculations. Polytropic equations of state (EOSs) as\nwell as realistic EOS with strong first-order phase transition due to kaon\ncondensation are used. For polytropic EOSs, a large parameter space is studied.\nFor a fixed \"overpressure\", dP, defined as the relative excess of central\npressure of collapsing metastable star over the pressure of equilibrium\nfirst-order phase transition, the energy release E_rel does not depend on the\nstellar angular momentum. It coincides with that for nonrotating stars with the\nsame dP. Therefore, results of 1-D calculations of E_rel(dP) for non-rotating\nstars can be used to predict, with very high precision, the outcome of much\nharder to perform 2-D calculations for rotating stars with the same dP. This\nresult holds also for dP_min < dP < 0, corresponding to phase transitions with\nclimbing over the energy barrier separating metastable N-phase configurations\nfrom those with an S-phase core. Such phase transitions could be realized in\nthe cores of newly born, hot, pulsating neutron stars.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 12 figures, submitted to A&A"]}]

In contrast to existing\nprobabilistic methods, our approach does not depend on the feasibility of\ncomputing deterministic robustness margin. We have developed efficient methods\nsuch as probabilistic comparison, probabilistic bisection and backward\niteration to facilitate the computation. In particular, confidence interval for\nbinomial random variables has been frequently used in the estimation of\nprobabilistic robustness margin and in the accuracy evaluation of estimating\nrobustness degradation function. Motivated by the importance of fast computing\nof binomial confidence interval in the context of probabilistic robustness\nanalysis, we have derived an explicit formula for constructing the confidence\ninterval of binomial parameter with guaranteed coverage probability. The\nformula overcomes the limitation of normal approximation which is asymptotic in\nnature and thus inevitably introduce unknown errors in applications. Moreover,\nthe formula is extremely simple and very tight in comparison with classic\nClopper-Pearson's approach.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 7 figures"]}]

A growing number of systems are reported to be in\nresonance, which is thought to arise from the planet migration process. If\nplanets are brought together and moved inward through torques produced by\ncircumstellar disks, then disk turbulence can act to prevent planets from\nstaying in a resonant configuration. This paper studies this process through\nnumerical simulations and via analytic model equations, where both approaches\ninclude stochastic forcing terms due to turbulence. We explore how the\namplitude and forcing time intervals of the turbulence affect the maintenance\nof mean motion resonances. If turbulence is common in circumstellar disks\nduring the epoch of planet migration, with the amplitudes indicated by current\nMHD simulations, then planetary systems that remain deep in mean motion\nresonance are predicted to be rare. More specifically, the fraction of resonant\nsystems that survive over a typical disk lifetime of 1 Myr is of order 0.01. If\nmean motion resonances are found to be common, their existence would place\ntight constraints on the amplitude and duty cycle of turbulent fluctuations in\ncircumstellar disks.

The neighbor-net algorithm is an\nextension of the neighbor-joining algorithm and is used for constructing split\nnetworks. We begin by describing the output of neighbor-net in terms of the\ntessellation of $\\bar{\\MM}_{0}^n(\\mathbb{R})$ by associahedra. This highlights\nthe fact that neighbor-net outputs a tree in addition to a circular ordering\nand we explain when the neighbor-net tree is the neighbor-joining tree. A key\nobservation is that the tree constructed in existing implementations of\nneighbor-net is not a neighbor-joining tree. Next, we show that neighbor-net is\na greedy algorithm for finding circular split systems of minimal balanced\nlength. This leads to an interpretation of neighbor-net as a greedy algorithm\nfor the traveling salesman problem. The algorithm is optimal for Kalmanson\nmatrices, from which it follows that neighbor-net is consistent and has optimal\nradius 1/2. We also provide a statistical interpretation for the balanced\nlength for a circular split system as the length based on weighted least\nsquares estimates of the splits. We conclude with applications of these results\nand demonstrate the implications of our theorems for a recently published\ncomparison of Papuan and Austronesian languages.\n"]}]
