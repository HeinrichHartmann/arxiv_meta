We consider an axisymmetric plume, and model the dissolution\nby means of the Ranz-Marshall equation in which there occurs a mass transfer\ncoefficient dependent on the plume properties. Our kinetic energy approach is\nmoreover generalized so as to take into account variable slip velocities.\n  The theoretical model is compared with various experiments, and satisfactory\nagreement is found. One central ingredient in the model is the turbulent\ncorrelation parameter, called I, playing a role analogous to the conventional\nentrainment coefficient \\alpha in the more traditional plume theories. We use\nexperimental data to suggest a relationship between I, the initial gas flux at\nthe source, and the depth of the gas release. This relationship is used to make\npredictions for five distinct case studies.\n  Comparison with various experimental data shows that the kinetic energy\napproach built upon use of the parameter I in practice has the order of\npredictive power as the conventional entrainment-coefficient models. Moreover,\nan advantage of the present model is that its predictions are very quickly\nworked out numerically.\n  Finally, we give a sensitivity analysis of the kinetic energy approach.
