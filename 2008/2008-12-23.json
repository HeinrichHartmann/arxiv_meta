We assume that for each embedded Reeb\norbit gamma, the total multiplicity of the negative ends of U_+ at covers of\ngamma agrees with the total multiplicity of the positive ends of U_- at covers\nof gamma. However, unlike in the usual gluing story, here the individual\nmultiplicities are allowed to differ. In this situation, one can often glue U_+\nand U_- to an index 2 curve by inserting genus zero branched covers of\nR-invariant cylinders between them. This paper shows that the signed count of\nsuch gluings equals a signed count of zeroes of a certain section of an\nobstruction bundle over the moduli space of branched covers of the cylinder.\nPart I obtained a combinatorial formula for the latter count and, assuming the\nresult of the present paper, deduced that the differential d in embedded\ncontact homology satisfies d^2=0. The present paper completes all of the\nanalysis that was needed in Part I. The gluing technique explained here is in\nprinciple applicable to more gluing problems.

Here we use 2.5D,\nrelativistic, fully electromagnetic PIC (Particle-In-Cell) code and an analytic\nMHD (Magnetohydrodynamic) formulation, to establish the following points: (i)\nUsing the generalised Ohm's law we find that the parallel electric field is\nsupported mostly by the electron pressure tensor, with a smaller contribution\nfrom the electron inertia term. (ii) The generated parallel electric field and\nthe fraction of accelerated electrons are independent of the IC wave frequency\nremaining at a level of six orders of magnitude larger than the Dreicer value\nand approximately 20% respectively. The generated parallel electric field and\nthe fraction of accelerated electrons increase with the increase of IC wave\namplitude. The generated parallel electric field seems to be independent of\nplasma beta, while the fraction of accelerated electrons strongly increases\nwith the decrease of plasma beta (for plasma beta of 0.0001 the fraction of\naccelerated electrons can be as large as 47%). (iii) In the collisionless\nregime IC wave dissipation length (that is defined as the distance over which\nthe wave damps) variation with the driving frequency shows a deviation from the\nanalytical MHD result, which we attribute to a possible frequency dependence of\nthe effective resistivity. (iv) Effective anomalous resistivity, inferred from\nour numerical simulations, is at least four orders of magnitude larger than the\nclassical Spitzer value.\n","Comment: Final version, accepted for publication in Physics of Plasmas"]}]

Abramowicz et al. show that in general, the cosmological redshift\nis not a Doppler shift and they consider this fact as a proof that space\nexpands. Again, nobody believes (perhaps except Milne) that for non-empty\nuniverses the origin of the redshift is purely Dopplerian. From the Principle\nof Equivalence it follows that there must be also a gravitational shift in\npresence of matter. Indeed, it is well known in cosmology that for small\nredshifts, the cosmological redshift can be decomposed into a Doppler component\nand a gravitational component. In a forthcoming paper, we shall perform such a\ndecomposition for arbitrarily large values of the redshift.\n","Comment: short communication"]}]

However, according to R\\'ev\\'esz (1977), his estimator has\ntwo main drawbacks: on the one hand, its convergence rate is smaller than that\nof the nonrecursive Nadaraya-Watson's kernel regression estimator, and, on the\nother hand, the required assumptions on the density of the random variable $X$\nare stronger than those usually needed in the framework of regression\nestimation. We first come back on the study of the convergence rate of\nR\\'ev\\'esz's estimator. An approach in the proofs completely different from\nthat used in R\\'ev\\'esz (1977) allows us to show that R\\'ev\\'esz's recursive\nestimator may reach the same optimal convergence rate as Nadaraya-Watson's\nestimator, but the required assumptions on the density of $X$ remain stronger\nthan the usual ones, and this is inherent to the definition of R\\'ev\\'esz's\nestimator. To overcome this drawback, we introduce the averaging principle of\nstochastic approximation algorithms to construct the averaged R\\'ev\\'esz's\nregression estimator, and give its asymptotic behaviour. Our assumptions on the\ndensity of $X$ are then usual in the framework of regression estimation. We\nprove that the averaged R\\'ev\\'esz's regression estimator may reach the same\noptimal convergence rate as Nadaraya-Watson's estimator. Moreover, we show\nthat, according to the estimation by confidence intervals point of view, it is\nbetter to use the averaged R\\'ev\\'esz's estimator rather than Nadaraya-Watson's\nestimator.\n"]}]
