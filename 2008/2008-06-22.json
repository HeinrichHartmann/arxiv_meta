In this work we show that a classical model containing a local\nprobabilistic interaction in the measurement process can lead to a violation of\nthe Bell inequalities. We first introduce two-particle phase-space\ndistributions in classical mechanics constructed to be the analogs of quantum\nmechanical angular momentum eigenstates. These distributions are then employed\nin four schemes characterized by different types of detectors measuring the\nangular momenta. When the model includes an interaction between the detector\nand the measured particle leading to ensemble dependencies, the relevant Bell\ninequalities are violated if total angular momentum is required to be\nconserved. The violation is explained by identifying assumptions made in the\nderivation of Bell's theorem that are not fulfilled by the model. These\nassumptions will be argued to be too restrictive to see in the violation of the\nBell inequalities a faithful signature of nonlocality.\n","Comment: Extended manuscript.

We have shown that in the case of a broken mirror parity\n(MP), the evolutions of fine structure constants in the O- and M-worlds are not\nidentical. It is assumed that E_6-unification inspired by superstring theory\nrestores the broken MP at the scale \\sim 10^{18} GeV, what unavoidably leads to\nthe different E_6-breakdowns at this scale: E_6 \\to SO(10)\\times U(1)_Z - in\nthe O-world, and E'_6 \\to SU(6)'\\times SU(2)'_Z - in the M-world. Considering\nonly asymptotically free theories, we have presented the running of all the\ninverse gauge constants \\alpha_i^{-1} in the one-loop approximation. Then a\n`quintessence' scenario is discussed for our model of accelerating universe.\nSuch a scenario is related with an axion (`acceleron') of a new gauge group\nSU(2)'_Z which has a coupling constant g_Z extremely growing at the scale\n\\Lambda_Z\\sim 10^{-3} eV.\n","Comment: 31 pages, 7 figures"]}]

It seems plausible that the size of the\nsmallest self-assembly program that builds a shape and the shape's\ndescriptional (Kolmogorov) complexity should be related. We show that when\nusing a notion of a shape that is independent of scale, this is indeed so: in\nthe Tile Assembly Model, the minimal number of distinct tile types necessary to\nself-assemble a shape, at some scale, can be bounded both above and below in\nterms of the shape's Kolmogorov complexity. As part of the proof of the main\nresult, we sketch a general method for converting a program outputting a shape\nas a list of locations into a set of tile types that self-assembles into a\nscaled up version of that shape. Our result implies, somewhat\ncounter-intuitively, that self-assembly of a scaled-up version of a shape often\nrequires fewer tile types. Furthermore, the independence of scale in\nself-assembly theory appears to play the same crucial role as the independence\nof running time in the theory of computability. This leads to an elegant\nformulation of languages of shapes generated by self-assembly. Considering\nfunctions from integers to shapes, we show that the running-time complexity,\nwith respect to Turing machines, is polynomially equivalent to the scale\ncomplexity of the same function implemented via self-assembly by a finite set\nof tile types. Our results also hold for shapes defined by Wang tiling -- where\nthere is no sense of a self-assembly process -- except that here time\ncomplexity must be measured with respect to non-deterministic Turing machines.\n","Comment: Extended abstract appears in DNA Computing 10; this is the full\n  version and will be submitted elsewhere. 25 pages"]}]
