Although M_{k,1} has only\none non-zero J-class and k-1 non-zero D-classes, the R- and the L-preorder are\ncomplicated; in particular, <_R is dense (even within an L-class), and <_L is\ndense (even within an R-class).\n  We study the computational complexity of the R- and the L-preorder. When\ninputs are given by words over a finite generating set of M_{k,1}, the R- and\nthe L-preorder decision problems are in P. The main result of the paper is that\nover a \"circuit-like\" generating set, the R-preorder decision problem of\nM_{k,1} is Pi_2^P-complete, whereas the L-preorder decision problem is\ncoNP-complete. We also prove related results about circuits: For combinational\ncircuits, the surjectiveness problem is Pi_2^P-complete, whereas the\ninjectiveness problem is coNP-complete.\n","Comment: 36 pages"]}]

The goal is to find a minimum-cost\nsubset $E^*$ of edges, that satisfies the given set of pairwise connectivity\nrequirements. In the edge-connectivity version we need to ensure that there are\n$r(u,v)$ edge-disjoint paths for every pair $u, v$ of vertices, while in the\nvertex-connectivity version the paths are required to be vertex-disjoint. The\nedge-connectivity version of SNDP is known to have a 2-approximation. However,\nno non-trivial approximation algorithm has been known so far for the vertex\nversion of SNDP, except for special cases of the problem. We present an\nextremely simple algorithm to achieve an $O(k^3 \\log n)$-approximation for this\nproblem, where $k$ denotes the maximum connectivity requirement, and $n$\ndenotes the number of vertices. We also give a simple proof of the recently\ndiscovered $O(k^2 \\log n)$-approximation result for the single-source version\nof vertex-connectivity SNDP. We note that in both cases, our analysis in fact\nyields slightly better guarantees in that the $\\log n$ term in the\napproximation guarantee can be replaced with a $\\log \\tau$ term where $\\tau$\ndenotes the number of distinct vertices that participate in one or more pairs\nwith a positive connectivity requirement.\n","Comment: 8 pages"]}]

We introduce the Latent Relation Mapping\nEngine (LRME), which combines ideas from SME and Latent Relational Analysis\n(LRA) in order to remove the requirement for hand-coded representations. LRME\nbuilds analogical mappings between lists of words, using a large corpus of raw\ntext to automatically discover the semantic relations among the words. We\nevaluate LRME on a set of twenty analogical mapping problems, ten based on\nscientific analogies and ten based on common metaphors. LRME achieves\nhuman-level performance on the twenty problems.

Using some approximations and simplifications for 2 and\n4-points Green's functions an effective Lagrangian describing both phases from\nthe SU(3) Lagrangian is obtained.
