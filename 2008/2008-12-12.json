To achieve this aim,\nthe gravitational interaction between two extended bodies and more precisely\nthe interaction between mass multipole moments of their gravitational fields\nand the associated tidal phenomena are studied. Use of Cartesian Symmetric\nTrace Free (STF) tensors, of their relation with spherical harmonics and of the\nKaula's transform enables to derive analytically the tidal and mutual\ninteraction potentials as well as the associated disturbing functions in\nextended bodies systems. The tidal and mutual interaction potentials of two\nextended bodies are derived. Next, the external gravitational potential of such\ntidally disturbed extended body is obtained, using the Love's number theory, as\nwell as the associated disturbing function. Finally, the dynamical evolution\nequations for such systems are given in their more general form without any\nlinearization.

Our model\nattributes the observed gradual decrease in the number of sectors at the\nleading edge to an unbiased random walk of sector boundaries. Natural selection\nintroduces a deterministic bias in the wandering of domain boundaries that\nrenders beneficial mutations more likely to escape genetic drift and become\nestablished in a sector.

As a\nconsequence, expanding frontiers are susceptible to deleterious mutations as\nrevealed by the high fraction of mutants at mutation-selection balance.\nNumerically, we also determine the condition at which the wild type is lost in\nfavor of deleterious mutants (genetic meltdown) at a growing front.

We confirm the predictions of the Lazarian\n& Vishniac model. In particular, we report the growth of the reconnection speed\nproportional to ~ V^2, where V is the amplitude of velocity at the injection\nscale. It depends on the injection scale l as ~ (l/L)^(2/3), where L is the\nsize of the system, which is somewhat faster but still roughly consistent with\nthe theoretical expectations. We also show that for 3D reconnection the Ohmic\nresistivity is important in the local reconnection events only, and the global\nreconnection rate in the presence of turbulence does not depend on it.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 8 figures"]}]

Here we develop a simple physical model\ndescribing the partitioning of cellular RNAP into different classes: RNAPs\ntranscribing mRNA and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), RNAPs non-specifically bound to\nDNA, free RNAP, and immature RNAP. Available experimental data for E. coli\nallow us to determine the two unknown parameters of the model and hence deduce\nthe free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. The results allow us to\npredict the growth-rate dependence of the activities of constitutive\n(unregulated) promoters, and to disentangle the growth-rate dependent\nregulation of promoters (e.g., the promoters of rRNA operons) from changes in\ntranscription due to changes in the free RNAP concentration at different growth\nrates. Our model can quantitatively account for the observed changes in gene\nexpression patterns in mutant E. coli strains with altered levels of RNAP\nexpression without invoking additional parameters.

The\nneighbourhood is then explored with a branch-and-bound solver. We propose a\nlocal branching scheme for (nonconvex) MINLPs which is based on iteratively\nsolving MILPs and NLPs.
