This problem is sometimes known as {\\em the curse of the boundary nodes}.\nTo overcome this problem, an approach based on coalition games is proposed, in\nwhich the boundary nodes can use cooperative transmission to help the backbone\nnodes in the middle of the network. In return, the backbone nodes are willing\nto forward the boundary nodes' packets. Here, the concept of core is used to\nstudy the stability of the coalitions in such games. Then three types of\nfairness are investigated, namely, min-max fairness using nucleolus, average\nfairness using the Shapley function, and a newly proposed market fairness.\nBased on the specific problem addressed in this paper, market fairness is a new\nfairness concept involving fairness between multiple backbone nodes and\nmultiple boundary nodes. Finally, a protocol is designed using both repeated\ngames and coalition games.

The standard approach is based on the optimization of a quality\nfunction, modularity, which is a relative quality measure for a partition of a\nnetwork into modules. Recently some authors [1,2] have pointed out that the\noptimization of modularity has a fundamental drawback: the existence of a\nresolution limit beyond which no modular structure can be detected even though\nthese modules might have own entity. The reason is that several topological\ndescriptions of the network coexist at different scales, which is, in general,\na fingerprint of complex systems. Here we propose a method that allows for\nmultiple resolution screening of the modular structure. The method has been\nvalidated using synthetic networks, discovering the predefined structures at\nall scales. Its application to two real social networks allows to find the\nexact splits reported in the literature, as well as the substructure beyond the\nactual split.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 5 figures"]}]
