Tc of MgB2 crystals with simultaneously substituted Li for\nMg and C for B decreases more than in the case where C is substituted alone.\nThis means that holes introduced by Li cannot counterbalance the effect of\ndecrease of Tc caused by introduction of electrons coming from C. The possible\nreason of it can be that holes coming from Li occupy the pi band while\nelectrons coming from C fill the sigma band. The temperature dependences of the\nupper critical field Hc2 for Al and Li substituted crystals with the same Tc\nshow a similar dHc2/dT slope at Tc and a similar Hc2(T) behavior, despite of\nmuch different substitution level. This indicates that the mechanism\ncontrolling Hc2 and Tc is similar in both hole and electron doped crystals.\nElectrical transport measurements show an increase of resistivity both in Li\nsubstituted crystals and in Li and C co-substituted crystals.

The observed behavior can be explained as a result\nof two effects, influencing both Tc and Hc2. The first one is doping related to\nthe changes in the carrier concentration, which may lead to the decrease or to\nthe increase of Tc.

The local region around a protoplanet in a protoplanetary disk is\nconsidered with sufficient spatial resolution: the region from outside the Hill\nsphere to the Jovian radius is covered by the nested-grid method. To\ninvestigate the thermal effects of the circumplanetary disk, various equations\nof state are adopted. Large thermal energy around the protoplanet slightly\nchanges the structure of the circumplanetary disk. Compared with a model\nadopting an isothermal equation of state, in a model with an adiabatic equation\nof state, the protoplanet's gas envelope extends farther, and a slightly thick\ndisk appears near the protoplanet. However, different equations of state do not\naffect the acquisition process of angular momentum for the protoplanetary\nsystem. Thus, the specific angular momentum acquired by the system is fitted as\na function only of the protoplanet's mass. A large fraction of the total\nangular momentum contributes to the formation of the circumplanetary disk. The\ndisk forms only in a compact region in very close proximity to the protoplanet.\nAdapting the results to the solar system, the proto-Jupiter and Saturn have\ncompact disks in the region of r < 21 r_J (r < 0.028 r_HJ) and r < 66 r_S (r <\n0.061 r_HS), respectively, where r_J (r_HJ) and r_S (r_HS) are the Jovian and\nSaturnian (Hill) radius, respectively. The surface density has a peak in these\nregions due to the balance between centrifugal force and gravity of the\nprotoplanet.

Since any subsurface reflector actually has a\nnon-uniform spatial variation, the use of a more comprehensive principle of\nmigration, by adopting the wave equation, has been argued to be necessary. By\nthis approach an expression has been derived for both the amplitude and the\nphase of a subsurface wavefield with vertical velocity variation. This\ntreatment has entailed the application of the WKB approximation, whose\nself-consistency has been established by the fact that the logarithmic\nvariation of the velocity is very slow in the vertical direction, a feature\nthat is much more strongly upheld at increasingly greater subsurface depths.\nFinally, it has been demonstrated that for a planar subsurface wavefield, there\nis an equivalence between the constant velocity Stolt Migration algorithm and\nthe stationary phase approximation method (by which the origin of the reflected\nsubsurface signals is determined).\n","Comment: 11 pages, 4 figures"]}]

This theorem, dating back to the\nfifties essentially states that a Markov chain is uniquely ergodic if it admits\na ``small'' set which is visited infinitely often. This gives an extension of\nthe ideas of Doeblin to the unbounded state space setting. Often this is\nestablished by finding a Lyapunov function with ``small'' level sets. This\ntopic has been studied by many authors (cf. Harris, Hasminskii, Nummelin, Meyn\nand Tweedie). If the Lyapunov function is strong enough, one has a spectral gap\nin a weighted supremum norm (cf. Meyn and Tweedie).\n  Traditional proofs of this result rely on the decomposition of the Markov\nchain into excursions away from the small set and a careful analysis of the\nexponential tail of the length of these excursions. There have been other\nvariations which have made use of Poisson equations or worked at getting\nexplicit constants. The present proof is very direct, and relies instead on\nintroducing a family of equivalent weighted norms indexed by a parameter\n$\\beta$ and to make an appropriate choice of this parameter that allows to\ncombine in a very elementary way the two ingredients (existence of a Lyapunov\nfunction and irreducibility) that are crucial in obtaining a spectral gap.\n  The original motivation of this proof was the authors' work on spectral gaps\nin Wasserstein metrics. The proof presented in this note is a version of our\nreasoning in the total variation setting which we used to guide the\ncalculations in arXiv:math/0602479. While we initially produced it for that\npurpose, we hope that it will be of interest in its own right.\n"]}]
