The Parisi solution is presented as\nreflecting the ansatz that it suffices to restrict the variation to hierarchal\nstructures which are discussed here in some detail. While the Parisi solution\nwas proven to be correct, through recent works of F. Guerra and M. Talagrand,\nthe reasons for the effectiveness of the Parisi ansatz still remain to be\nelucidated.
