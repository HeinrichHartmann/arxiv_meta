Some authors have claimed that the rate of GRBs increases with cosmic\nredshift faster than the star formation rate, whose cause is not known yet. In\nthis paper, I investigate the possibility for interpreting the observed\ndiscrepancy between the GRB rate history and the star formation rate history by\nthe cosmic metallicity evolution, motivated by the observation that the cosmic\nmetallicity evolves with redshift and GRBs prefer to occur in low metallicity\ngalaxies. First, I derive a star formation history up to redshift z=7.4 from an\nupdated sample of star formation rate densities obtained by adding the new UV\nmeasurements of Bouwens et al. and the new UV and infrared measurements of\nReddy et al. to the existing sample compiled by Hopkins & Beacom. Then,\nadopting a simple model for the relation between the GRB production and the\ncosmic metallicity history as proposed by Langer & Norman, I show that the\nobserved redshift distribution of the Swift GRBs can be reproduced with a\nfairly good accuracy. Although the results are limited by the small size of the\nGRB sample and the poorly understood selection biases in detection and\nlocalization of GRBs and in redshift determination, they suggest that GRBs\ntrace both the star formation and the metallicity evolution. If the star\nformation history can be accurately measured with other approaches, which is\npresumably achievable in the near future, it will be possible to determine the\ncosmic metallicity evolution with the study on the redshift distribution of\nGRBs.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 11 figures and 2 tables, accepted for publication in MNRAS.\n  New version contains an updated star formation history and a review on the\n  cosmic metallicity measurement"]}]

In the spherical braid group case the\ntrivial representation is not isolated in the family of quantum SU(2)\nrepresentations. In particular, they may be used to give an explicit check that\nspherical braid groups and hyperelliptic mapping class groups do not have\nKazhdan's property (T). On the other hand, the representations of the mapping\nclass group of the torus do not have almost invariant vectors, in fact they\nconverge to the metaplectic representation of SL(2,Z) on L^2(R). As a\nconsequence we obtain a curious analytic fact about the Fourier transform on\nthe real line which may not have been previously observed.\n"]}]
