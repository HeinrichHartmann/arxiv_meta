The amounts of \"proven\" and\npotential fossil fuel reserves are uncertain and debated. Regardless of the\ntrue values, society has flexibility in the degree to which it chooses to\nexploit these reserves, especially unconventional fossil fuels and those\nlocated in extreme or pristine environments. If conventional oil production\npeaks within the next few decades, it may have a large effect on future\natmospheric CO2 and climate change, depending upon subsequent energy choices.\nAssuming that proven oil and gas reserves do not greatly exceed estimates of\nthe Energy Information Administration, and recent trends are toward lower\nestimates, we show that it is feasible to keep atmospheric CO2 from exceeding\nabout 450 ppm by 2100, provided that emissions from coal, unconventional fossil\nfuels, and land use are constrained. Coal-fired power plants without\nsequestration must be phased out before mid-century to achieve this CO2 limit.\nIt is also important to \"stretch\" conventional oil reserves via energy\nconservation and efficiency, thus averting strong pressures to extract liquid\nfuels from coal or unconventional fossil fuels while clean technologies are\nbeing developed for the era \"beyond fossil fuels\". We argue that a rising price\non carbon emissions is needed to discourage conversion of the vast fossil\nresources into usable reserves, and to keep CO2 beneath the 450 ppm ceiling.\n","Comment: (22 pages, 7 figures; final version accepted by Global Biogeochemical\n  Cycles)"]}]

In all simulations, a slow wave is driven on the upper boundary, thus\npropagating down from low-beta to high-beta plasma across the mode-conversion\nregion. In addition, a detailed analytical study is carried out where we\npredict the amplitude and phase of the transmitted and converted components of\nthe incident wave as it passes through the mode-conversion region.
