Methods: We\nanalyse radio spectral features and images acquired at radio, H-alpha, EUV, and\nsoft X-ray wavelengths, during an event close to the solar limb on 2 June 2003.\nResults: The fast-drifting decimetric-metric radio burst corresponds to a\nmoving, wide emission front in the radio images, which is normally interpreted\nas a signature of a propagating shock wave. A decimetric-metric type II burst\nwhere only the second harmonic lane is visible could explain the observations.\nAfter long-lasting activity in the active region, the hot and dense loops could\nbe absorbing or suppressing emission at the fundamental plasma frequency. The\nobserved burst speed suggests a super-Alfvenic velocity for the burst driver.\nThe expanding and opening loops, associated with the flare and the early phase\nof CME lift-off, could be driving the shock.

Recently, Zhang and Scott found new indications\nthat the higher-temperature beta phase has space group I-42d and, by assuming a\ngroup-subgroup relationship between phases, they argued that the\nlower-temperature alpha phase should have lower symmetry than that of the\nwidely-accepted P4_12_12 space group. With this motivation, we use\nfirst-principles calculations to investigate the energy, structure, and local\nstability of P4_12_12 and I-42d structures. We also compute the frequencies of\nthe zone-center phonon modes in both structures, as well as certain\nzone-boundary modes in the I-42d structure, and compare with experiment. We\nthen argue that the various P4_12_12 and I-42d enantiomorphs can be grouped\ninto three clusters, each of which is identified with a three-dimensional\nmanifold of structures of P2_12_12_1 symmetry in which the P4_12_12 and I-42d\nappear as higher-symmetry special cases. We find that there are relatively high\nenergy barriers between manifolds, but low barriers within a manifold.\nExploring the energy landscape within one of these manifolds, we find a\nminimal-energy path connecting P4_12_12 and I-42d structures with a\nsurprisingly low barrier of ~5 meV per formula unit.

For volume fractions less than PHIc2, the\nviscosity remains finite in the limit t => infinite. For volume fractions above\ncritical the viscosity grows without limit, so aging occurs at rest. At\nconstant shear rate there is no bifurcation, whereas under constant shear\nstress the model predicts a new bifurcation in the viscosity at a critical\nstress sB, identical to the yield stress sy observed under steady conditions.\nThe divergence of the viscosity for stress s sB is best defined as aging.\nHowever, for s > sB, where the viscosity remains finite, it seems preferable to\nuse the concepts of restructuring and destructuring, rather than aging and\nrejuvenation. Nevertheless, when a stress sA (sB) is applied during aging,\nslower aging is predicted and discussed as true rejuvenation. Plastic behaviour\nis predicted under steady conditions when s > sB. The Herschel-Bulkley model\nfits the flow curve for stresses close to sB, whereas the Bingham model gives a\nbetter fit for s >> sB. Finally, the model's predictions are shown to be\nconsistent with experimental data from the literature for the transient\nbehaviour of laponite gels.\n"]}]
