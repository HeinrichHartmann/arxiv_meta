The closure phase values are close\nto zero at all spectral channels, indicating the absence of asymmetric\nintensity features. The apparent UD angular diameter is smallest at about 1.3\nand 1.7 mu and increases by a factor of ~1.4 around 2.0 mu. The minimum UD\nangular diameter is 8.1 pm 0.5 mas, corresponding to ~420 R_sun.

We attempt to constraint the GC scenario as the cause of Uranus'\nobliquity as well as on the mechanisms able to give origin to the Uranian\nirregulars. Different capture mechanisms for irregulars operate at different\nstages on the giant planets formation process. The mechanisms able to capture\nthe uranian irregulars before and after the GC are analysed. Assuming that they\nwere captured before the GC, we calculate the orbital transfer of the nine\nirregulars by the impulse imparted by the GC. If their orbital transfer results\ndynamically implausible, they should have originated after the GC. We\ninvestigate and discuss the dissipative mechanisms able to operate later. In\nparticular Prospero could not exist at the time of the GC. Different capture\nmechanisms for Prospero after the GC are investigated. Gas drag by\nUranus'envelope and pull-down capture are not plausible mechanisms. Capture of\nProspero through a collisionless interaction seems to be difficult. The GC\nitself provides a mechanism of permanent capture. However, the capture of\nProspero by the GC is a low probable event. Catastrophic collisions could be a\npossible mechanism for the birth of Prospero and the other irregulars after the\nGC. Orbital and physical clusterings should then be expected. Either Prospero\nhad to originate after the GC or the GC did not occur. In the former case, the\nmechanism for the origin of Prospero after the GC remains an open question. In\nthe latter case, another theory to account for Uranus' obliquity and the\nformation of the Uranian regular satellites on the equatorial plane of the\nplanet would be needed.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 1 eps figure, accepted for publication in A&A.

Results for\nthe lattice constants, coefficients of linear thermal expansion, isothermal and\nadiabatic bulk moduli, heat capacities at constant volume and constant\npressure, Debye temperatures and Gr\\\"uneisen parameters as a function of\ntemperature are presented. The computed results are compared with the available\nexperimental data. The comparison shows a generally good agreement between the\ncalculated and experimental values for all thermodynamic properties studied.\nIsothermal and adiabatic bulk moduli and the specific heats are reproduced\nreasonably well, while the Gr\\\"uneisen parameter and Debye temperature are\nunderestimated by about 10%. The calculated phonon frequencies for Ag and Cu\nagree well with the results from inelastic neutron scattering experiments.\nHowever, there is considerable room for improvement in the phonon frequencies\nfor Ni, Pd, Pt and Au, particularly at high phonon wave vectors close to the\nBrillouin zone boundary. The coefficient of linear thermal expansion is\nunderestimated in most cases except for Pt and Au. The results are good for Pt\nup to 1000K and for Au up to 500 K.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 27 figures Submitted to Physical Review B"]}]

Our results show that the intense excitation modes at the\ncharge gap edge predominantly originate from the ladder-containing planar\nsubstructures. The observed ladder modes (E vs. Q) are found to be dispersive\nfor momentum transfers along the \"legs\" but nearly localized along the \"rungs\".\nDispersion and peakwidth characteristics are similar to the charge spectrum of\n1D Mott insulators, and we show that our results can be understood in the\nstrong coupling limit (U >> t_{ladder}> t_{chain}). The observed behavior is in\nmarked contrast to the charge spectrum seen in most two dimensional cuprates.\nQuite generally, our results also show that momentum-tunability of inelastic\nscattering can be used to resolve mode contributions in multi-component\nincommensurate systems.\n","Comment: 4+ pages, 5 figures"]}]
