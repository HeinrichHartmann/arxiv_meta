A new stochastic\nclassical approach to the quantum fluctuations of spacetime is developed. The\nwork extends conceptually Boyer's random electrodynamics to a theory of random\ngravity but has a considerably richer structure for inheriting nonlinearity\nfrom general relativity. Attention is drawn to subtleties in choosing boundary\nconditions for metric fluctuations in relation to their dynamical consequences.\nThose compatible with the observed Lorentz invariance must allow for\nspontaneous conformal fluctuations, in addition to stochastic gravitational\nwaves due to zero point gravitons. This is implemented through an effective\nmetric defined in terms of the random spacetime metric modulo a fluctuating\nconformal factor. It satisfies an effective Einstein equation coupled to an\neffective stress-energy tensor incorporating gravitational self energy of\nmetric fluctuations as well as matter fields. The effective Einstein equation\nis expanded up to second order nonlinearity. A UV-cutoff is introduced whose\nspecific value, however, does not enter into the resulting description of\nrandom gravity. The averaged effective metric satisfies the empty space\nEinstein equation with an effective cosmological constant. This vanishes when\nonly the massless matter fields are included. More generally, a finite\neffective cosmological constant compatible with the observational constraints\ncan be obtained as long as the bare masses of the massive matter fields are\nnearly zero, or the conformal invariance of matter is restored at some high\nenergy scale.\n","Comment: 19 pages, two-column revtex4 format"]}]

Two of them are relative compactified Prymians of a family of\ngenus-3 curves with involution, and the third one is obtained from a Prymian by\nMukai's flop. They have the same singularities as two of Fujiki's examples,\nnamely, 28 isolated singular points analytically equivalent to the Veronese\ncone of degree 8, but a different Euler number. The family of curves used in\nthis construction forms a linear system on a K3 surface with involution. The\nstructure morphism of both Prymians to the base of the family is a Lagrangian\nfibration in abelian surfaces with polarization of type (1,2). No example of\nsuch fibration is known on nonsingular irreducible symplectic varieties.\n","Comment: 28 pages"]}]

A fundamental\nquestion is whether categories simply mirror an underlying structure of nature,\nor instead come from the complex interactions of human beings among themselves\nand with the environment. Here we address this question by modelling a\npopulation of individuals who co-evolve their own system of symbols and\nmeanings by playing elementary language games. The central result is the\nemergence of a hierarchical category structure made of two distinct levels: a\nbasic layer, responsible for fine discrimination of the environment, and a\nshared linguistic layer that groups together perceptions to guarantee\ncommunicative success. Remarkably, the number of linguistic categories turns\nout to be finite and small, as observed in natural languages.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 4 figures"]}]

To illustrate the idea we introduce the\nconcept of entanglement-swapping boxes, i.e. we consider any quantum operations\nwhich perform entanglement swapping, not necessarily via simple quantum\nteleportation. We ask a question about the properties of such boxes., i.e. what\nlocal operations and how much classical communication are needed to perform\nthem. We also ask if any box which performs entanglement swapping can be used\nto establish classical communication. We show that each box needs at least two\nbits of classical communication to perform it. It is also shown that each box\ncan be used for classical communication and, most importantly, that there exist\nboxes which allow to communicate at most one bit. Surprisingly we find basic\nirreversibility in the process of entanglement swapping with respect to its\ncommunication properties.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Phys. Rev.
