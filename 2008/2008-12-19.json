We are mainly\nconsidering higher spin gauge fields in their own right as free-standing\ntheoretical constructs and not circumstances where they occur as part of\nanother system. Considering the problem of introducing interactions among\nhigher spin gauge fields, there has historically been two broad avenues of\napproach. One approach entails gauging a non-Abelian global symmetry algebra,\nin the process making it local. The other approach entails deforming an already\nlocal but Abelian gauge algebra, in the process making it non-Abelian. In cases\nwhere both avenues have been explored, such as for spin 1 and 2 gauge fields,\nthe results agree (barring conceptual and technical issues) with Yang-Mills\ntheory and Einstein gravity. In the case of an infinite tower of higher spin\ngauge fields, the first approach has been thoroughly developed and explored by\nM. Vasiliev, whereas the second approach, after having lain dormant for a long\ntime, has received new attention by several authors lately. In the present\npaper we briefly review some aspects of the history of higher spin gauge fields\nas a backdrop to an attempt at comparing the gauging vs. deforming approaches.\nA common unifying structure of strongly homotopy Lie algebras underlying both\napproaches will be discussed.

In particular, we estimate the number of memory qubits and\nthe number of operations required to perform factorization, using the algorithm\nsuggested by Shor. A $K$-bit number can be factored in time of order $K^3$\nusing a machine capable of storing $5K+1$ qubits. Evaluation of the modular\nexponential function (the bottleneck of Shor's algorithm) could be achieved\nwith about $72 K^3$ elementary quantum gates; implementation using a linear ion\ntrap would require about $396 K^3$ laser pulses. A proof-of-principle\ndemonstration of quantum factoring (factorization of 15) could be performed\nwith only 6 trapped ions and 38 laser pulses. Though the ion trap may never be\na useful computer, it will be a powerful device for exploring experimentally\nthe properties of entangled quantum states.\n","Comment: 56 pages, 22 figures, uses REVTeX, epsf"]}]
