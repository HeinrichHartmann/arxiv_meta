In particular, in\nthe case of SO(3)-invariant states it is shown that the present inequalities\ndetect entanglement in regions in which entanglement witnesses based on\nextended reduction map fail. It should be also emphasized that in the case of\n$2\\otimes N$ states the derived inequalities detect entanglement efficiently,\nwhile the extended reduction maps are useless when acting on the qubit\nsubsystem.

If eccentricity waves are important further\ndecay of the eccentricity can be slow, with full circularization requiring up\nto 50 Myr for disks at radii of 0.1 pc to 0.2 pc.

The\ncondition is written in terms of the ground state entanglement and the\npartition function and it gives transition temperatures below which\nentanglement is guaranteed to survive. It is flexible and can be easily adapted\nto consider entanglement for different splittings, as well as be weakened to\nallow easier calculations by approximations. Examples where the condition is\ncalculated are given. These examples allow us to characterize a minimum gapping\nbehavior for the survival of entanglement in the thermodynamic limit. Further,\nthe same technique can be used to find noise thresholds in the generation of\nuseful resource states for one-way quantum computing.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 2 figures. Changes made in line with publication\n  recommendations. Motivation and concequences of result clarified, with the\n  addition of one more example, which applies the result to give noise\n  thresholds for measurement based quantum computing. New author added with new\n  results"]}]
