As\na SGS model, Clark reproduces the energy spectrum and intermittency properties\nof the DNS.

In this work, the validity is assessed of a simple equation,\nwhich approximately relates the contact angle of a liquid on a surface to its\ndensity, its surface tension, and the effective molecule-surface potential.\nThis equation is derived in the sharp-kink approximation, where the density\nprofile of the liquid is assumed to drop precipitously within one molecular\ndiameter of the substrate. It is found that this equation satisfactorily\nreproduces the temperature-dependence of the contact angle for helium on alkali\nmetal surfaces. The equation also seems be applicable to liquids such as water\non solid surfaces such as gold and graphite, based on a comparison of predicted\nand measured contact angles near room-temperature. Nevertheless, we conclude\nthat, to fully test the equation's applicability to fluids such as water, it\nremains necessary to measure the contact angle's temperature-dependence. We\nhypothesize that the effects of electrostatic forces can increase with\ntemperature, potentially driving the wetting temperature much higher and closer\nto the critical point, or lower, closer to room temperature, than predicted\nusing current theories.\n","Comment: 5 figures"]}]

The groups in question include word hyperbolic CAT(0)\ngroups as well as geometrically finite Kleinian groups and numerous\n2-dimensional CAT(0) groups. For such a group we show that there is an\nintrinsic notion of a quasiconvex subgroup which is equivalent to the inclusion\nbeing a quasi-isometric embedding. We also show that the visual boundary of the\nCAT(0) space is actually an invariant of the group. More generally we show that\neach quasiconvex subgroup of such a group has a canonical limit set which is\nindependent of the choice of overgroup.\n  The main results in this article were established by Gromov and Short in the\nword hyperbolic setting and do not extend to arbitrary CAT(0) groups.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 2 figures.

A delayed, damped Mathieu equation example is given. The computation of\ngood bounds on ODE fundamental solutions is an important technical issue; an a\nposteriori method for such bounds is given.
