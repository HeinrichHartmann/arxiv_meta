Most contour-based shape analysis methods can not be used to\ncharacterize such cells because of overlaps between neuronal processes. The\nproposed framework is specifically aimed at the problem of contour following\neven in presence of multiple overlaps. First, the input image is preprocessed\nin order to obtain an 8-connected skeleton with one-pixel-wide branches, as\nwell as a set of critical regions (i.e., bifurcations and crossings). Next, for\neach subtree, the tracking stage iteratively labels all valid pixel of\nbranches, up to a critical region, where it determines the suitable direction\nto proceed. Finally, the labeled skeleton segments are followed in order to\nyield the parametric contour of the neuronal shape under analysis. The reported\nsystem was successfully tested with respect to several images and the results\nfrom a set of three neuron images are presented here, each pertaining to a\ndifferent class, i.e. alpha, delta and epsilon ganglion cells, containing a\ntotal of 34 crossings. The algorithms successfully got across all these\noverlaps. The method has also been found to exhibit robustness even for images\nwith close parallel segments.
