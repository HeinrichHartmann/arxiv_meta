In the SAURON sample, we\nfind that 31% of early-type galaxies are single component systems. 91% of the\nmulti-components systems have two kinematic subcomponents, the rest having\nthree. In addition, 29% of galaxies have kinematically decoupled components,\nnuclear components with significant kinematic twists. We find that the velocity\nmaps of fast rotators closely resemble those of inclined disks, except in the\ntransition regions between kinematic subcomponents. In terms of E/S0\nclassification, this means that 74% of Es and 92% of S0s have components with\ndisk-like kinematics. For the majority of fast rotators, the kinematic axial\nratios are equal to or less than their photometric axial ratios, contrary to\nwhat is predicted with isotropic Jeans models viewed at different inclinations.\nThe position angles of fast rotators are constant, while they vary abruptly in\nslow rotators. Velocity dispersion maps of face-on galaxies have shapes similar\nto the distribution of light. We constructed local (bin-by-bin) h3 - V/sigma\nand h4 - V/sigma diagrams from SAURON observations. We confirm the classical\nanti-correlation of h3 and V\\sigma, but we also find that h3 is almost zero in\nsome objects or even weakly correlated with V/sigma. The distribution of h4 for\nfast and slow rotators is mildly positive on average.
