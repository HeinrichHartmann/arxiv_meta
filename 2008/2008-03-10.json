By critically examining the suitability of\nspreadsheet computer programming languages for application development, six\n\"application development features\" are identified, with source code protection\nbeing the most important. We investigate the status of these features and\ndiscuss how they might be implemented in the dominant Microsoft Excel\nspreadsheet and in the new Google Spreadsheet. Although Google Spreadsheet\ncurrently provides no source code control, its web-centric delivery model\noffers technical advantages for future provision of a rich set of features.\nExcel has a number of tools that can be combined to provide \"pretty good\nprotection\" of source code, but weak passwords reduce its robustness. User\naccess to Excel source code must be considered a programmer choice rather than\nan attribute of the spreadsheet.\n","Comment: 11 pages"]}]

METHODS : On the basis of high-resolution,\nmixed-polarity magnetoconvection simulations, we used an artificial neural\nnetwork (ANN) model to approximate the nonlinear inverse mapping between\nsynthesized Stokes spectra and the underlying stratification of atmospheric\nparameters like temperature, line-of-sight (LOS) velocity and LOS magnetic\nfield. This approach not only allows us to incorporate more reliable physics\ninto the inversion process, it also enables the inversion on an absolute\ngeometrical height scale, which allows the subsequent combination of individual\nline-of-sight stratifications to obtain a complete 3-dimensional reconstruction\n(tomography) of the observed area. RESULTS : The magnetoconvection simulation\ndata, as well as the ANN inversion, have been properly processed to be\napplicable to spectropolarimetric observations from the Hinode satellite. For\nthe first time, we show 3-dimensional tomographic reconstructions (temperature,\nLOS velocity, and LOS magnetic field) of a quiet sun region observed by Hinode.\nThe reconstructed area covers a field of approximately 12000 by 12000 km and a\nheight range of 510 km in the photosphere. An enormous variety of small and\nlarge scale structures can be identified in the 3-D reconstructions. The\nlow-flux region (B_{mag} = 20G) we analyzed exhibits a number of \"tube-like\"\nmagnetic structures with field strengths of several hundred Gauss. Most of\nthese structures rapidly loose their strength with height and only a few larger\nstructures can retain a higher field strength to the upper layers of the\nphotosphere.\n","Comment: accepted for A&A Letters"]}]

On the basis of field measurements, we\nshow how the volume, the velocity and the output sand flux of a dune can be\ncomputed from the value of its body and horn widths. The dune size distribution\nis obtained from the analysis of aerial photographs. It shows that these fields\nare in a statistically homogeneous state along the wind direction and present a\n`corridor' structure in the transverse direction, in which the dunes have a\nrather well selected size. Investigating the possible external parameters\ncontrolling these corridors, we demonstrate that none among topography,\ngranulometry, wind and sand flux is relevant. We finally discuss the dynamical\nprocesses at work in these fields (collisions and wind fluctuations), and\ninvestigate the way they could regulate the size of the dunes. Furthermore we\nshow that the overall sand flux transported by a dune field is smaller than the\nmaximum transport that could be reached in the absence of dunes, i.e. in\nsaltation over the solid ground.\n","Comment: revised version for JGR-ES, 36 pages, 21 figures"]}]

For any such bundle $\\E$, if it exists, we find the\nprojective invariants of the curves $C \\subset V$ which are the zero-locus of\ngeneral global sections of $\\E$. In turn, a curve $C \\subset V$ with such\ninvariants is a section of a bundle $\\E$ from our lists. This way we reduce the\nproblem for existence of such bundles on $V$ to the problem for existence of\ncurves with prescribed properties contained in $V$. In part of the cases in our\nlists the existence of such curves on the general $V$ is known, and we state\nthe question about the existence on the general $V$ of any type of curves from\nthe lists.\n","Comment: 9 pages"]}]
