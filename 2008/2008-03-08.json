This model directly maps on to\nan easy-axis $S=1/2$ XXZ model on the kagome lattice and is also related, at\nlarge $V/t$, to a quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice. Using quantum\nMonte Carlo (QMC) numerics, we map out the phase diagram of this model at\nhalf-filling.

The insulating phase at T=0\nappears to have no conventional broken symmetries, and is thus a uniform Mott\ninsulator (a `spin liquid' in magnetic language). We characterize this\ninsulating phase as a uniform $Z_2$ fractionalized insulator from the\ntopological order in the ground state and estimate its vison gap. Consistent\nwith this identification, there is no apparent thermal phase transition upon\nheating the insulator. The insulating phase instead smoothly crosses over into\nthe high temperature paramagnet via an intermediate cooperative paramagnetic\nregime. We also study the superfluid-to-normal thermal transition for $V <\nV_c$. We find that this is a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition at small $V/t$ but\nchanges to a first order transition for $V$ closer to $V_c$.
