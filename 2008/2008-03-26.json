This construction\ngeneralizes many known Hopf algebras, for example U(sl2), U_q(sl2) and the\nenveloping algebra of the 3-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra. In a\ntorsion-free case we describe the finite-dimensional simple modules, in\nparticular their dimensions and prove a Clebsch-Gordan decomposition theorem\nfor the tensor product of two simple modules. We construct a Casimir type\noperator and prove that any finite-dimensional weight module is semisimple.\n","Comment: 23 pages"]}]
