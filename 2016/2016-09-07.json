The constraints are obtained\nfrom the Doppler widths of Lyman-alpha absorption lines in the quasar\nnear-zones and build upon our previous measurement for the z=6.02 quasar SDSS\nJ0818+1722. The expanded data set, combined with an improved treatment of\nsystematic uncertainties, yields an average temperature at the mean density of\nlog (T_0/K) = 4.21 \\pm 0.03 (\\pm^0.06_0.07) at 68 (95) per cent confidence for\na flat prior distribution over 3.2 < log (T_0/K) < 4.8. In comparison,\ntemperatures measured from the general IGM at z~5 are ~0.3 dex cooler, implying\nan additional source of heating around these quasars which is not yet present\nin the general IGM at slightly lower redshift. This heating is most likely due\nto the recent reionisation of He-II in vicinity of these quasars, which have\nhard, non-thermal ionising spectra. The elevated temperatures may therefore\nrepresent evidence for the earliest stages of He-II reionisation in the most\nbiased regions of the high-redshift Universe. The temperature as a function of\ndistance from the quasars is consistent with being constant, log(T_0/K)~4.2,\nwith no evidence for a line-of-sight thermal proximity effect. However, the\nlimited extent of the quasar near-zones prevents the detection of He-III\nregions larger than ~5 proper Mpc. Under the assumption the quasars have\nreionised the He-II in their vicinity, we infer the data are consistent with an\naverage optically bright phase of duration in excess of 10^6.5 yr.

With the recent technological improvements on the Karl G. Jansky\nVery Large Array (VLA), new observations can test the assumptions upon which\nejecta mass estimates are based. Early observations of the classical nova V1723\nAql showed an unexpectedly rapid rise in radio flux density and a distinct bump\nin the radio light curve on the rise to radio maximum, which is inconsistent\nwith the simple model of spherical ejecta expelled in a single discrete event.\nThis initial bump appears to indicate the presence of shocked material in the\nouter region of the ejected shell, with the emission from the shocks fading\nover time.

In this scenario, Alice\nreceives an $n$-bit string $x$, and wishes to encode $x$ into a quantum state\n$\\rho_x$, such that Bob, when receiving the state $\\rho_x$, can choose any bit\n$i \\in [n]$ and recover the input bit $x_i$ with high probability. Here we\nstudy two variants: parity-oblivious random access codes, where we impose the\ncryptographic property that Bob cannot infer any information about the parity\nof any subset of bits of the input apart from the single bits $x_i$; and\neven-parity-oblivious random access codes, where Bob cannot infer any\ninformation about the parity of any even-size subset of bits of the input.\n  In this paper, we provide the optimal bounds for parity-oblivious quantum\nrandom access codes and show that they are asymptotically better than the\noptimal classical ones. Our results provide a large non-contextuality\ninequality violation and resolve the main open problem in a work of Spekkens,\nBuzacott, Keehn, Toner, and Pryde (2009). Second, we provide the optimal bounds\nfor even-parity-oblivious random access codes by proving their equivalence to a\nnon-local game and by providing tight bounds for the success probability of the\nnon-local game via semidefinite programming. In the case of\neven-parity-oblivious random access codes, the cryptographic property holds\nalso in the device-independent model.\n","Comment: Version 3.

Hence, we are able to measure the\nHI mass of W43 more accurately and our analysis reveals a lower limit of\nM=6.6x10^6 M_sun, which is a factor of 2.4 larger than the mass estimated with\nthe assumption of optically thin emission.

This result challenges\ntheoretical models that predict a threshold for the HI column density of ~10\nM_sun/pc^2, at which the formation of molecular hydrogen should set in. By\nassuming an elliptical layered structure for W43, we estimate the particle\ndensity profiles. While at the cloud edge atomic and molecular hydrogen are\nwell mixed, the center of the cloud is strongly dominated by molecular\nhydrogen.

To investigate the impact on LyA photons, we apply a\nnovel combination of analytic and numerical calculations to three scenarios:\n(i) the `bubble' model, where only diffuse HI outside ionized bubbles is\npresent; (ii) the `web' model, where HI exists only in overdense self-shielded\ngas; and (iii) the more realistic 'web-bubble' model, which contains both. Our\nanalysis confirms that there is a degeneracy between the ionization structure\nof the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the HI fraction inferred from LyA\nsurveys, as the three models suppress LyA flux equally with very different HI\nfractions. We argue that a joint analysis of the LyA luminosity function and\nthe rest-frame equivalent width distribution/LyA fraction can break this\ndegeneracy and provide constraints on the reionization history and its\ntopology. We further show that constraints can improve if we consider the full\nshape of the M_UV-dependent redshift evolution of the LyA fraction of Lyman\nbreak galaxies. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that (i) a drop of LyA\nfraction larger for UV-faint than for UV-bright galaxies can be reproduced with\nweb and web-bubble models and therefore does not provide exclusive evidence of\npatchy reionization, and (ii) the IGM-transmission PDF is unimodal for bubble\nmodels and bimodal in web models. We further highlight the importance of\ngalaxy-absorber cross-correlation. Comparing our models to observations, the\nneutral fraction at z~7 is likely to be of order of tens of per cent when\ninterpreted with bubble or web-bubble models.

Here, we present a simple,\nanalytically tractable, presence-absence (PA) model for community assembly and\nuse it to ask how ecological traits such as the strength of competition, the\namount of diversity, and demographic and environmental stochasticity affect\nspecies composition in a community. In the PA model, species are treated as\nstochastic binary variables that can either be present or absent in a\ncommunity: species can immigrate into the community from a regional species\npool and can go extinct due to competition and stochasticity. Despite its\nsimplicity, the PA model reproduces the qualitative features of more\ncomplicated models of community assembly. In agreement with recent work on\nlarge, competitive Lotka-Volterra systems, the PA model exhibits distinct\necological behaviors organized around a special (\"critical\") point\ncorresponding to Hubbell's neutral theory of biodiversity.

The dissociation process involves carbon insertion into the Fe\nsurface causing a lattice deformation that requires a larger surface system for\nunrestricted relaxation. We show that, in larger surface systems associated\nwith dilute CO-coverages, the dissociation barrier is significantly decreased.\nThe elastic deformation of the surface is generic and can potentially\napplicable for all similar metal-hydrocarbon reactions and therefore a dilute\ncoverage is necessary for the simulation of these reactions as isolated\nprocesses.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 6 figures.

Many of these\nexamples represent dynamic and uncertain environments, and thus, require, in\nfact, online mechanisms.

In this work we present\nthe first online mechanism for a multi-sided market which has the above\nproperties. Our mechanism is designed for a market setting suggested by\n[Feldman and Gonen (2016)]; which is motivated by the foreseeable future form\nof online advertising.\n  The online nature of our setting motivated us to define a stronger notion of\nindividual rationality, called \"continuous individual rationality\", capturing\nthe natural requirement that a player should never lose either by participating\nin the mechanism or by not leaving prematurely. Satisfying the requirements of\ncontinuous individual rationality, together with the other economic properties\nour mechanism guarantees, requires the mechanism to use a novel pricing scheme\nwhere users may be paid ongoing increments during the mechanism's execution up\nto a pre-known maximum value. As users rarely ever get paid in reality, this\npricing scheme is new to mechanism design. Nevertheless, the principle it is\nbased on can be observed in many common real life scenarios such as executive\ncompensation payments and company acquisition deals. We believe both our new\ndynamic pricing scheme concept and our strengthened notion of individual\nrationality are of independent interest.\n","Comment: 21 pages.

We then applied a modern Zeeman-Doppler\nimaging code in order to reconstruct the magnetic topology of all stars and the\nbrightness distribution of one of our studied stars. Our results show a\nsignificant decrease in the magnetic field strength and energy as the stellar\nage increases from 100Myr to 250Myr while there is no significant age\ndependence of the mean magnetic field strength for stars with ages 250-650Myr.\nThe spread in the mean field strength between different stars is comparable to\nthe scatter between different observations of individual stars. The meridional\nfield component has the weakest strength compared to the radial and azimuthal\nfield components in 15 out of the 16 magnetic maps. It turns out that 89-97% of\nthe magnetic field energy is contained in l=1-3. There is also no clear trend\nwith age and distribution of field energy into poloidal/toroidal and\naxisymmetric/non-axisymmetric components within the sample. The two oldest\nstars in this study do show a twice as strong octupole component compared to\nthe quadrupole component. This is only seen in one out of 13 maps of the\nyounger stars. One star, chi1 Ori displays two field polarity switches during\nalmost 5 years of observations suggesting a magnetic cycle length of either 2,\n6 or 8 years.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 15 figures, 4 tables; Accepted for publication in Astronomy\n  & Astrophysics"]}]

We model the disk using full 3D radiative\ntransfer to obtain the disk structure. Also, we use an optically thin analysis\nof the outer disk spectrum to obtain firm constraints on the composition of the\ndust component.

The re-reduced ISO spectrum\ndiffers significantly from that previously published, but matches the new\nHerschel spectrum at their common wavelength range. In particular, we do not\ndetect any significant contribution from carbonates or hydrous silicates, in\ncontrast to earlier claims. Conclusions: The amount of water ice detected in\nthe outer disk requires $\\sim80\\,$\\% of the oxygen atoms.

We\nfind that spiral structure tends to be present in older (100s Myrs) stars and\nclusters in the simulations compared to the observations. This likely reflects\ndifferences in the numbers of stars or clusters, the strength of spiral arms,\nand whether the clusters are allowed to evolve. Where we model clusters with\nmultiple particles, we are able to study their evolution. The evolution of\nsimulated clusters tends to follow that of their natal gas clouds. Massive,\ndense, long-lived clouds host massive clusters, whilst short-lived clouds host\nsmaller clusters which readily disperse. Most clusters appear to disperse\nfairly quickly, in basic agreement with observational findings. We note that\nembedded clusters may be less inclined to disperse in simulations in a galactic\nenvironment with continuous accretion of gas onto the clouds than isolated\nclouds and correspondingly, massive young clusters which are no longer\nassociated with gas tend not to occur in the simulations. Caveats of our models\ninclude that the cluster densities are lower than realistic clusters, and the\nsimplistic implementation of stellar feedback.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

Using the energy flux as a center of connection, we have demonstrated\nhow the nonequilibrium trinity leads to the four-fifths law in fully developed\nturbulence and how it is connected to the scaling laws.\n","Comment: 52 pages, 3 figures"]}]

Our strategy uses\na new combinatorial object that we dub a \"rendezvous code,\" which may be of\nindependent interest.\n  When $T \\le n$, we show that the probability of meeting within $T$ steps is\nindeed asymptotically maximized by the Anderson-Weber strategy.

In this\nwork's magnetic force microscopy (MFM) studies of magnetron sputtered Ir/Co/Pt\nmultilayers we show skyrmions that are smaller than previously observed, are\nnot circularly symmetric, and are pinned to 50 nm wide areas of 75 percent\nhigher than average DM interaction. This finding matches our measurement of Co\nlayer thickness inhomogeneity of the order of $\\pm$1.2 atomic monolayers per\n0.6 nm layer, and indicates that layer flatness must be controlled with greater\nprecision to preclude skyrmion pinning.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 6 figures"]}]

Based on our previous experimental work and a comparison of\npublished theoretical DR rates, we estimate there is in general a factor of 2\nuncertainty in existing DR rates used for modeling the IGM. We demonstrate that\nthis uncertainty results in factors of ~1.9 uncertainty in the predicted N V\nand Si IV column densities, ~1.6 for O VI, and ~1.7 for C IV. We show that\nthese systematic uncertainties translate into a systematic uncertainty of up to\na factor of ~3.1 in the Si/C abundance ratio inferred from observations. The\ninferred IGM abundance ratio could thus be less than the solar Si/C ratio or\ngreater than 3 times the solar ratio. If the latter is true, then it suggests\nthe metagalactic radiation field is not due purely to active galactic nuclei,\nbut includes a significant stellar component. Lastly, column density ratios of\nSi IV to C IV versus C II to C IV are often used to constrain the decrement in\nthe metagalactic radiation field at the He II absorption edge. We show that the\nvariation in the predicted Si IV to C IV ratio due to a factor of 2 uncertainty\nin the DR rates is almost as large as that due to a factor of 10 change in the\ndecrement. Laboratory measurements of the relevant DR resonance strengths and\nenergies are the only unambiguous method to remove the effects of these atomic\nphysics uncertainties from models of the IGM.\n","Comment: Submitted to ApJL.

In this paper\nwe study a recently defined [3, 8, 9] condition called locally nonconical\nconvexity (abbreviated LNC). Is is easy to show that every strictly convex set\nis LNC, as are half-spaces and finite intersections of sets of either of these\ntypes, but many more sets are LNC. For instance, every zonoid (the range of a\nnonatomic vector-valued measure) is LNC (Corollary 34). However, there are no\ninfinite-dimensional compact LNC sets (Theorem 23).\n  The LNC concept originated in a search for continuous sections, and the\npresent paper shows how it leads naturally (and constructively) to continuous\nsections in a variety of situations. Let Q be a compact, convex set in R^n, and\nlet T be a linear map from R^n into R^m. We show (Theorem 1) that Q is LNC if\nand only if the restriction of any such T to Q is an open map of Q onto T(Q).\nThis implies that if Q is LNC, then any such T has continuous sections (i.e.\nthere are continuous right inverses of T) that map from T(Q) to Q, and in fact\nit is possible to define continuous sections constructively in various natural\nways (Theorem 3, Corollary 4, and Theorem 5). If Q is strictly convex and T is\nnot 1-1, we can construct continuous sections which take values in the boundary\nof Q (Theorem 6).\n  When we give up compactness it is natural to consider a closed, convex, LNC\nsubset Q of a Hilbert space X which may be infinite-dimensional. In this case\nwe must assume that T is left Fredholm, i.e. a bounded linear map with closed\nrange and finite-dimensional kernel. We can then prove results analogous to\nthose mentioned in the last paragraph (Theorems 16-20). We also prove that T(Q)\nis LNC (Theorem 25).\n","Comment: 23 pages"]}]

To obtain this improved lower bound for\ncr(K_{7,n}), we use some elementary topological facts on drawings of K_{2,7} to\nset up a quadratic program on 6! variables whose minimum p satisfies\ncr(K_{7,n}) >= (p/2)n^2 - 4.5n, and then use state--of--the--art quadratic\noptimization techniques combined with a bit of invariant theory of permutation\ngroups to show that p >= 4.3593.\n","Comment: LaTeX, 18 pages, 2 figures"]}]

In this paper\nwe derive a ``third-order'' generalization of the FKG inequality.\n  We also establish fourth- and fifth-order generalizations of the FKG\ninequality and formulate a conjecture for a general mth-order generalization.\nFor functions and measures on R^n we establish these inequalities by extending\nthe method of diffusion processes. We provide several applications of the\nthird-order inequality, generalizing earlier applications of the FKG\ninequality.\n  Finally, we remark on some connections between the theory of total positivity\nand the existence of inequalities of FKG-type within the context of Riemannian\nmanifolds.\n","Comment: Published by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics\n  (http://www.imstat.org) in the Annals of Probability\n  (http://www.imstat.org/aop/) at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/009117904000000298"]}]

We\nprove that several elements in M_{g,k} admit non-homeomorphic hyperbolic Dehn\nfillings sharing the same volume, homology, cusp volume, cusp shape, Heegaard\ngenus, complex length of the shortest geodesic, length of the shortest return\npath, and Turaev-Viro invariants. Manifolds which share all these invariants\nare called geometrically similar, and were first studied by C. D. Hodgson, R.\nG. Meyerhoff and J. R. Weeks. The examples of geometrically similar manifolds\nthey described are commensurable with each other. We show here that many\nelements in M_{g,k} admit non-commensurable geometrically similar Dehn\nfillings.\n  The notion of geometric isolation for cusps in a hyperbolic 3-manifold was\nintroduced by W. D. Neumann and A. W. Reid and studied by D. Calegary, who\nprovided explanations for all the previously known examples of isolation\nphenomena. We show here that the cusps of any manifold M_{g,k} are\ngeometrically isolated from each other. Apparently, isolation of cusps in our\nexamples arises for different reasons from those described by Calegari.\n  We also show that any element in M_{g,k} admits an infinite family of\nhyperbolic Dehn fillings inducing non-trivial deformations of the hyperbolic\nstructure on the geodesic boundary.\n","Comment: 33 pages, 8 figures"]}]
