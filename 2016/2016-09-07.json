The constraints are obtained\nfrom the Doppler widths of Lyman-alpha absorption lines in the quasar\nnear-zones and build upon our previous measurement for the z=6.02 quasar SDSS\nJ0818+1722. The expanded data set, combined with an improved treatment of\nsystematic uncertainties, yields an average temperature at the mean density of\nlog (T_0/K) = 4.21 \\pm 0.03 (\\pm^0.06_0.07) at 68 (95) per cent confidence for\na flat prior distribution over 3.2 < log (T_0/K) < 4.8. In comparison,\ntemperatures measured from the general IGM at z~5 are ~0.3 dex cooler, implying\nan additional source of heating around these quasars which is not yet present\nin the general IGM at slightly lower redshift. This heating is most likely due\nto the recent reionisation of He-II in vicinity of these quasars, which have\nhard, non-thermal ionising spectra. The elevated temperatures may therefore\nrepresent evidence for the earliest stages of He-II reionisation in the most\nbiased regions of the high-redshift Universe. The temperature as a function of\ndistance from the quasars is consistent with being constant, log(T_0/K)~4.2,\nwith no evidence for a line-of-sight thermal proximity effect. However, the\nlimited extent of the quasar near-zones prevents the detection of He-III\nregions larger than ~5 proper Mpc. Under the assumption the quasars have\nreionised the He-II in their vicinity, we infer the data are consistent with an\naverage optically bright phase of duration in excess of 10^6.5 yr.

With the recent technological improvements on the Karl G. Jansky\nVery Large Array (VLA), new observations can test the assumptions upon which\nejecta mass estimates are based. Early observations of the classical nova V1723\nAql showed an unexpectedly rapid rise in radio flux density and a distinct bump\nin the radio light curve on the rise to radio maximum, which is inconsistent\nwith the simple model of spherical ejecta expelled in a single discrete event.\nThis initial bump appears to indicate the presence of shocked material in the\nouter region of the ejected shell, with the emission from the shocks fading\nover time.

In this scenario, Alice\nreceives an $n$-bit string $x$, and wishes to encode $x$ into a quantum state\n$\\rho_x$, such that Bob, when receiving the state $\\rho_x$, can choose any bit\n$i \\in [n]$ and recover the input bit $x_i$ with high probability. Here we\nstudy two variants: parity-oblivious random access codes, where we impose the\ncryptographic property that Bob cannot infer any information about the parity\nof any subset of bits of the input apart from the single bits $x_i$; and\neven-parity-oblivious random access codes, where Bob cannot infer any\ninformation about the parity of any even-size subset of bits of the input.\n  In this paper, we provide the optimal bounds for parity-oblivious quantum\nrandom access codes and show that they are asymptotically better than the\noptimal classical ones. Our results provide a large non-contextuality\ninequality violation and resolve the main open problem in a work of Spekkens,\nBuzacott, Keehn, Toner, and Pryde (2009). Second, we provide the optimal bounds\nfor even-parity-oblivious random access codes by proving their equivalence to a\nnon-local game and by providing tight bounds for the success probability of the\nnon-local game via semidefinite programming. In the case of\neven-parity-oblivious random access codes, the cryptographic property holds\nalso in the device-independent model.\n","Comment: Version 3.

Various distance metrics, like the subtree prune-and-regraft\n(SPR), tree bisection reconnection (TBR) and nearest neighbour interchange\n(NNI) have been proposed to capture this similarity. The distance between two\nphylogenetic trees can also be measured by the size of a Maximum Agreement\nForest (MAF) on these trees, as it has been shown that the rooted subtree\nprune-and-regraft distance is 1 less than the size of a MAF. Since computing a\nMAF of minimum size is an NP-hard problem, approximation algorithms are of\ninterest. Recently, it has been shown that the MAF on k(>=2) trees can be\napproximated to within a factor of 8. In this paper, we improve this ratio to\n3.

Hence, we are able to measure the\nHI mass of W43 more accurately and our analysis reveals a lower limit of\nM=6.6x10^6 M_sun, which is a factor of 2.4 larger than the mass estimated with\nthe assumption of optically thin emission.

This result challenges\ntheoretical models that predict a threshold for the HI column density of ~10\nM_sun/pc^2, at which the formation of molecular hydrogen should set in. By\nassuming an elliptical layered structure for W43, we estimate the particle\ndensity profiles. While at the cloud edge atomic and molecular hydrogen are\nwell mixed, the center of the cloud is strongly dominated by molecular\nhydrogen.

To investigate the impact on LyA photons, we apply a\nnovel combination of analytic and numerical calculations to three scenarios:\n(i) the `bubble' model, where only diffuse HI outside ionized bubbles is\npresent; (ii) the `web' model, where HI exists only in overdense self-shielded\ngas; and (iii) the more realistic 'web-bubble' model, which contains both. Our\nanalysis confirms that there is a degeneracy between the ionization structure\nof the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the HI fraction inferred from LyA\nsurveys, as the three models suppress LyA flux equally with very different HI\nfractions. We argue that a joint analysis of the LyA luminosity function and\nthe rest-frame equivalent width distribution/LyA fraction can break this\ndegeneracy and provide constraints on the reionization history and its\ntopology. We further show that constraints can improve if we consider the full\nshape of the M_UV-dependent redshift evolution of the LyA fraction of Lyman\nbreak galaxies. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that (i) a drop of LyA\nfraction larger for UV-faint than for UV-bright galaxies can be reproduced with\nweb and web-bubble models and therefore does not provide exclusive evidence of\npatchy reionization, and (ii) the IGM-transmission PDF is unimodal for bubble\nmodels and bimodal in web models. We further highlight the importance of\ngalaxy-absorber cross-correlation. Comparing our models to observations, the\nneutral fraction at z~7 is likely to be of order of tens of per cent when\ninterpreted with bubble or web-bubble models. Alternatively, we obtain a\nconservative lower limit ~1% in the web models, if we allow for a drop in the\nphotoionization rate by a factor of ~100 from the post-reionized universe.\n[abridged]\n","Comment: 23 pages, 20 figures, submitted to MNRAS, Abstract abridged for arXiv\n  submission"]}]

In the PA model, species are treated as\nstochastic binary variables that can either be present or absent in a\ncommunity: species can immigrate into the community from a regional species\npool and can go extinct due to competition and stochasticity. Despite its\nsimplicity, the PA model reproduces the qualitative features of more\ncomplicated models of community assembly. In agreement with recent work on\nlarge, competitive Lotka-Volterra systems, the PA model exhibits distinct\necological behaviors organized around a special (\"critical\") point\ncorresponding to Hubbell's neutral theory of biodiversity.

The dissociation process involves carbon insertion into the Fe\nsurface causing a lattice deformation that requires a larger surface system for\nunrestricted relaxation. We show that, in larger surface systems associated\nwith dilute CO-coverages, the dissociation barrier is significantly decreased.\nThe elastic deformation of the surface is generic and can potentially\napplicable for all similar metal-hydrocarbon reactions and therefore a dilute\ncoverage is necessary for the simulation of these reactions as isolated\nprocesses.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 6 figures.

Many of these\nexamples represent dynamic and uncertain environments, and thus, require, in\nfact, online mechanisms.

In this work we present\nthe first online mechanism for a multi-sided market which has the above\nproperties. Our mechanism is designed for a market setting suggested by\n[Feldman and Gonen (2016)]; which is motivated by the foreseeable future form\nof online advertising.\n  The online nature of our setting motivated us to define a stronger notion of\nindividual rationality, called \"continuous individual rationality\", capturing\nthe natural requirement that a player should never lose either by participating\nin the mechanism or by not leaving prematurely. Satisfying the requirements of\ncontinuous individual rationality, together with the other economic properties\nour mechanism guarantees, requires the mechanism to use a novel pricing scheme\nwhere users may be paid ongoing increments during the mechanism's execution up\nto a pre-known maximum value. As users rarely ever get paid in reality, this\npricing scheme is new to mechanism design. Nevertheless, the principle it is\nbased on can be observed in many common real life scenarios such as executive\ncompensation payments and company acquisition deals. We believe both our new\ndynamic pricing scheme concept and our strengthened notion of individual\nrationality are of independent interest.\n","Comment: 21 pages.

The\nleast-squares deconvolution multi-line technique was used to increase the\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the data. We then applied a modern Zeeman-Doppler\nimaging code in order to reconstruct the magnetic topology of all stars and the\nbrightness distribution of one of our studied stars. Our results show a\nsignificant decrease in the magnetic field strength and energy as the stellar\nage increases from 100Myr to 250Myr while there is no significant age\ndependence of the mean magnetic field strength for stars with ages 250-650Myr.\nThe spread in the mean field strength between different stars is comparable to\nthe scatter between different observations of individual stars. The meridional\nfield component has the weakest strength compared to the radial and azimuthal\nfield components in 15 out of the 16 magnetic maps. It turns out that 89-97% of\nthe magnetic field energy is contained in l=1-3. There is also no clear trend\nwith age and distribution of field energy into poloidal/toroidal and\naxisymmetric/non-axisymmetric components within the sample. The two oldest\nstars in this study do show a twice as strong octupole component compared to\nthe quadrupole component. This is only seen in one out of 13 maps of the\nyounger stars. One star, chi1 Ori displays two field polarity switches during\nalmost 5 years of observations suggesting a magnetic cycle length of either 2,\n6 or 8 years.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 15 figures, 4 tables; Accepted for publication in Astronomy\n  & Astrophysics"]}]

We model the disk using full 3D radiative\ntransfer to obtain the disk structure. Also, we use an optically thin analysis\nof the outer disk spectrum to obtain firm constraints on the composition of the\ndust component.

The re-reduced ISO spectrum\ndiffers significantly from that previously published, but matches the new\nHerschel spectrum at their common wavelength range.

Conclusions: The amount of water ice detected in\nthe outer disk requires $\\sim80\\,$\\% of the oxygen atoms.

We show that this discrepancy is unlikely to be\ndue to past mass-transfer phases or to the presence of an unresolved companion.\nInstead, we propose that HS 2220$+$2146 formed through a new wide DWD\nevolutionary channel involving the merger of the inner binary in a hierarchical\ntriple system. The resulting blue straggler and its wide companion then evolved\nindependently, forming the WD pair seen today. Although we cannot rule out\nother scenarios, the most likely formation channel has the inner binary merging\nwhile both stars are still on the main sequence. This provides us with the\ntantalizing possibility that Kozai-Lidov oscillations may have played a role in\nthe inner binary's merger. {\\it Gaia} may uncover hundreds more wide DWDs,\nleading to the identification of other systems like HS 2220$+$2146. There are\nalready indications that other WD systems may have been formed through\ndifferent, but related, hierarchical triple evolutionary scenarios.\nCharacterizing these populations may allow for thorough testing of the\nefficiency with which KL oscillations induce stellar mergers.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ, 12 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables"]}]

In the simulations, NGC 205 was surrounded by massless particles to\nstatistically sample the distribution of the sub-subhalos expected in a subhalo\nthat has a mass similar to NGC 205. We made Monte Carlo samplings and found\nthat, using a set of reference parameters, the probability of producing a\nthinner distribution of sub-subhalos than the observed NGC 205 + 15 smaller\nsatellites (thus including the 2 counter-rotators, but excluding M32) increased\nfrom <1e-8 for the initial distribution to ~0.01 at pericentre. The probability\nof the simulated sub-subhalos occupying the locations of the observed\nco-rotating satellites in the line of sight velocity versus projected on-sky\ndistance plane is at most 0.002 for 11 out of 13 satellites. Increasing the\nmass of M31 and the extent of the initial distribution of sub-subhalos gives a\nmaximum probability of 0.004 for all 13 co-rotating satellites, but the\nprobability of producing the thinness would drop to ~ 0.001.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 15 figures, to be published in MNRAS"]}]

Unlike previous numerical work, where typically each star particle\nrepresents one `cluster', for the isolated galaxies we are able to model\nfeatures we term `clusters' with groups of particles. We compute the spatial\ndistribution of stars with different ages, and cluster mass distributions,\ncomparing our findings with observations including the recent LEGUS survey. We\nfind that spiral structure tends to be present in older (100s Myrs) stars and\nclusters in the simulations compared to the observations. This likely reflects\ndifferences in the numbers of stars or clusters, the strength of spiral arms,\nand whether the clusters are allowed to evolve. Where we model clusters with\nmultiple particles, we are able to study their evolution. The evolution of\nsimulated clusters tends to follow that of their natal gas clouds. Massive,\ndense, long-lived clouds host massive clusters, whilst short-lived clouds host\nsmaller clusters which readily disperse. Most clusters appear to disperse\nfairly quickly, in basic agreement with observational findings. We note that\nembedded clusters may be less inclined to disperse in simulations in a galactic\nenvironment with continuous accretion of gas onto the clouds than isolated\nclouds and correspondingly, massive young clusters which are no longer\nassociated with gas tend not to occur in the simulations. Caveats of our models\ninclude that the cluster densities are lower than realistic clusters, and the\nsimplistic implementation of stellar feedback.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

We show that compressibility regularizes mostly the equations, making\nthem well-posed for all parameters, at the condition that sufficient\ndissipation is associated with volume changes. In addition to the usual Coulomb\nshear friction coefficient $\\mu$, we introduce a bulk friction coefficient\n$\\mu_b$, associated to volume changes and show that the equations are\nwell-posed in two dimensions if $\\mu_b>2-2\\mu$ ($\\mu_b>3-7\\mu/2$ in three\ndimensions). Moreover, we show that the ill-posed domain defined in\n\\citep{Barker2015} transforms into a domain where the equations are unstable\nbut stay well-posed when compressibility is taken into account. These results\nsuggest thus the importance of compressibility in dense granular flows.\n"]}]

Based on our previous experimental work and a comparison of\npublished theoretical DR rates, we estimate there is in general a factor of 2\nuncertainty in existing DR rates used for modeling the IGM. We demonstrate that\nthis uncertainty results in factors of ~1.9 uncertainty in the predicted N V\nand Si IV column densities, ~1.6 for O VI, and ~1.7 for C IV. We show that\nthese systematic uncertainties translate into a systematic uncertainty of up to\na factor of ~3.1 in the Si/C abundance ratio inferred from observations. The\ninferred IGM abundance ratio could thus be less than the solar Si/C ratio or\ngreater than 3 times the solar ratio. If the latter is true, then it suggests\nthe metagalactic radiation field is not due purely to active galactic nuclei,\nbut includes a significant stellar component. Lastly, column density ratios of\nSi IV to C IV versus C II to C IV are often used to constrain the decrement in\nthe metagalactic radiation field at the He II absorption edge. We show that the\nvariation in the predicted Si IV to C IV ratio due to a factor of 2 uncertainty\nin the DR rates is almost as large as that due to a factor of 10 change in the\ndecrement.

In this paper\nwe study a recently defined [3, 8, 9] condition called locally nonconical\nconvexity (abbreviated LNC). Is is easy to show that every strictly convex set\nis LNC, as are half-spaces and finite intersections of sets of either of these\ntypes, but many more sets are LNC. For instance, every zonoid (the range of a\nnonatomic vector-valued measure) is LNC (Corollary 34). However, there are no\ninfinite-dimensional compact LNC sets (Theorem 23).\n  The LNC concept originated in a search for continuous sections, and the\npresent paper shows how it leads naturally (and constructively) to continuous\nsections in a variety of situations. Let Q be a compact, convex set in R^n, and\nlet T be a linear map from R^n into R^m. We show (Theorem 1) that Q is LNC if\nand only if the restriction of any such T to Q is an open map of Q onto T(Q).\nThis implies that if Q is LNC, then any such T has continuous sections (i.e.\nthere are continuous right inverses of T) that map from T(Q) to Q, and in fact\nit is possible to define continuous sections constructively in various natural\nways (Theorem 3, Corollary 4, and Theorem 5). If Q is strictly convex and T is\nnot 1-1, we can construct continuous sections which take values in the boundary\nof Q (Theorem 6).\n  When we give up compactness it is natural to consider a closed, convex, LNC\nsubset Q of a Hilbert space X which may be infinite-dimensional. In this case\nwe must assume that T is left Fredholm, i.e. a bounded linear map with closed\nrange and finite-dimensional kernel. We can then prove results analogous to\nthose mentioned in the last paragraph (Theorems 16-20). We also prove that T(Q)\nis LNC (Theorem 25).\n","Comment: 23 pages"]}]

We also construct stable\nbundles that are destabilized by Frobenius in the following situations:\ncharacteristic p=2 and rank four, (2) characteristic p=rank=3, (3)\ncharacteristic p=rank=5 and g at least three.\n  We also explore (in any characteristic) the connection between Frobenius\ndestabilized bundles and (pre)-opers, this approach allows us to reinterpret\nsome of our results in terms of pre-opers and also allows us to construct\nFrobenius destablised bundles from certain pre-opers (or opers).\n  The other result we obtain is (for characteristic two): we show that the\nGunning bundle descends under Frobenius when genus g is even. If g is odd, then\nthe Gunning bundle twisted by any odd degree line bundle also descends.\n","Comment: 16 pages"]}]

If\nthe cones C_i are \"stable\" then O is zero and M_X is a smooth manifold. We also\nextend our results to families of almost Calabi-Yau structures on M.\n  The first paper math.DG/0211294 laid the foundations for the series, and\nstudied the regularity of X near its singular points.

Suppose\n$\\Omega$ is a convex body in Euclidean space $\\RR^d$ or in $\\TT^d$, which is\nsymmetric about the origin. Over all positive definite functions supported in\n$\\Omega$, and with normalized value 1 at the origin, what is the largest\npossible value of their integral? From this Arestov, Berdysheva and Berens\narrived to pose the analogous pointwise extremal problem for intervals in\n$\\RR$.

However, it turns out that the problem for the real line has\nalready been solved by Boas and Kac, who gave several proofs and also mentioned\npossible extensions to $\\RR^d$ and non-convex domains as well.\n  We present another approach to the problem, giving the solution in $\\RR^d$\nand for several cases in $\\TT^d$. In fact, we elaborate on the fact that the\nproblem is essentially one-dimensional, and investigate non-convex open domains\nas well. We show that the extremal problems are equivalent to more familiar\nones over trigonometric polynomials, and thus find the extremal values for a\nfew cases. An analysis of the relation of the problem for the space $\\RR^d$ to\nthat for the torus $\\TT^d$ is given, showing that the former case is just the\nlimiting case of the latter. Thus the hiearachy of difficulty is established,\nso that trigonometric polynomial extremal problems gain recognition again.\n","Comment: 19 pages"]}]

The phenomenon of interest\nhere is the classification of phase transition (non-uniqueness of the Gibbs\nstate) according to whether it is robust. In many cases, including all of the\nHeisenberg and Potts models, occurrence of robust phase transition is\ndetermined by the geometry (branching number) of the tree in a way that\nparallels the situation with independent percolation and usual phase transition\nfor the Ising model. The critical values for robust phase transition for the\nHeisenberg and Potts models are also calculated exactly.

As an application of\nthis new monotonicity formula, we show that the blow-down limit of a certain\ntype III immortal solution is a gradient expanding soliton.\n  In the last section we also illustrate the connection between the new\nLi-Yau-Hamilton estimate and the earlier Hessian comparison theorem on the\n`reduced distance', proved in \\cite{FIN}.\n","Comment: some applications added to section 5"]}]

A diagram D is a set of types over the empty set, and the class of\nmodels of the diagram D consists of the models of T which omit all the types\nnot in D.\n  In this work, we introduce a natural dependence relation on the subsets of\nthe models for the omega-stable case which share many of the formal properties\nof forking. This is achieved by considering a rank for this framework which is\nbounded when the diagram D is omega-stable. We can also obtain pregeometries\nwith respect to this dependence relation. The dependence relation is the\nnatural one induced by the rank, and the pregeometries exist on the set of\nrealizations of types of minimal rank. Finally, these concepts are used to\ngeneralize many of the classical results for models of a totally transcendental\nfirst-order theory. In fact, strong analogies arise: models are determined by\ntheir pregeometries or their relationship with their pregeometries; however the\nproofs are different, as we do not have compactness.

This bracket product has all the properties of a\nstandard inner product including Bessel's inequality, a Riesz Representation\nTheorem, and a Gram-Schmidt process which turns a sequence of functions\n$(g_{n})$ into a sequence $(e_{n})$ with the property that\n$(E_{mb}e_{n})_{m,n\\in \\Bbb Z}$ is orthonormal in $L^{2}(\\Bbb R)$. Armed with\nthis inner product, we obtain several results concerning Weyl-Heisenberg\nframes.

Extensive numerical simulations of the\nCGLE reveal a wide range of dynamical zigzag behavior which we summarize in a\n`phase diagram'. We have performed a numerical linear stability and bifurcation\nanalysis of regular zigzag structures which reveals that traveling zigzags\nbifurcate from stationary zigzags via a pitchfork bifurcation. This bifurcation\nchanges from supercritical (forward) to subcritical (backward) as a function of\nthe CGLE coefficients, and we show the relevance of this for the `phase\ndiagram'.
