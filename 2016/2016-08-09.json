In the\nabove-mentioned article, there lies this contrast, on the one hand, the\ndimensionless quantum uncertainty of the potential box approaches classical\ndispersion only in the limit of large quantum numbers ($n\\to \\infty\n$)-consistent with the correspondence principle. On the other hand, similar\nevaluations for bouncing ball and harmonic oscillator potentials are equal to\ntheir classical counterparts independent of $n$. This equality may hide the\nquantum feature of low energy levels. In the current study, we change the\npotential intervals in order to make them symmetric for the linear potential\nand non-symmetric for the quadratic potential. As a result, it is shown in this\npaper that the dimensionless quantum uncertainty of these potentials in the new\npotential intervals is expressed in terms of quantum number $n$. In other\nwords, the uncertainty requires the correspondence principle in order to\napproach the classical limit. Therefore, it can be concluded that the\ndimensionless analysis, as a useful pedagogical method, does not take away the\nquantum feature of the n-dependence of quantum uncertainty in general.\nMoreover, our numerical calculations include the higher powers of the position\nfor the potentials.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 11 figures"]}]

To\naddress this issue, we propose employing an acoustic sensor array which is\nmounted on the eyeglasses frames. The signals from the array are processed by\nan algorithm with the purpose of acquiring the user's desired near-filed speech\nsignal while suppressing noise signals originating from the environment. The\narray is comprised of two AVSs which are located at the fore of the glasses'\ntemples. Each AVS consists of four collocated subsensors: one pressure sensor\n(with an omnidirectional response) and three particle-velocity sensors (with\ndipole responses) oriented in mutually orthogonal directions. The array\nconfiguration is designed to boost the input power of the desired signal, and\nto ensure that the characteristics of the noise at the different channels are\nsufficiently diverse (lending towards more effective noise suppression). Since\nchanges in the array's position correspond to the desired speaker's movement,\nthe relative source-receiver position remains unchanged; hence, the need to\ntrack fluctuations of the steering vector is avoided. Conversely, the spatial\nstatistics of the noise are subject to rapid and abrupt changes due to sudden\nmovement and rotation of the user's head. Consequently, the algorithm must be\ncapable of rapid adaptation.

DR13 makes\npublicly available 1390 spatially resolved integral field unit observations of\nnearby galaxies from MaNGA, the first data released from this survey. It\nincludes new observations from eBOSS, completing SEQUELS. In addition to\ntargeting galaxies and quasars, SEQUELS also targeted variability-selected\nobjects from TDSS and X-ray selected objects from SPIDERS. DR13 includes new\nreductions of the SDSS-III BOSS data, improving the spectrophotometric\ncalibration and redshift classification. DR13 releases new reductions of the\nAPOGEE-1 data from SDSS-III, with abundances of elements not previously\nincluded and improved stellar parameters for dwarf stars and cooler stars. For\nthe SDSS imaging data, DR13 provides new, more robust and precise photometric\ncalibrations. Several value-added catalogs are being released in tandem with\nDR13, in particular target catalogs relevant for eBOSS, TDSS, and SPIDERS, and\nan updated red-clump catalog for APOGEE. This paper describes the location and\nformat of the data now publicly available, as well as providing references to\nthe important technical papers that describe the targeting, observing, and data\nreduction. The SDSS website, http://www.sdss.org, provides links to the data,\ntutorials and examples of data access, and extensive documentation of the\nreduction and analysis procedures.

This\nmakes it difficult to extract conclusions about the consistency of individuals'\nbehavior when facing different situations, and more importantly, to define a\ncomprehensive classification of the strategies underlying the observed\nbehaviors. Here, we present the results of a lab-in-the-field experiment in\nwhich subjects face four different dyadic games, with the aim of establishing\ngeneral behavioral rules dictating individuals' actions. By analyzing our data\nwith an unsupervised clustering algorithm, we find that all the subjects\nconform, with a large degree of consistency, to a limited number of behavioral\nphenotypes (Envious, Optimist, Pessimist, and Trustful), with only a small\nfraction of undefined subjects.

A major challenge is to\nleverage such data to gain insight into the brain's computational mechanisms.\nThe first step is to define candidate brain-computational models (BCMs) that\ncan perform the behavioural task in question. We would then like to infer,\nwhich of the candidate BCMs best accounts for measured brain-activity data.\nHere we describe a method that complements each BCM by a measurement model\n(MM), which simulates the way the brain-activity measurements reflect neuronal\nactivity (e.g. local averaging in fMRI voxels or sparse sampling in array\nrecordings). The resulting generative model (BCM-MM) produces simulated\nmeasurements. In order to avoid having to fit the MM to predict each individual\nmeasurement channel of the brain-activity data, we compare the measured and\npredicted data at the level of summary statistics. We describe a novel\nparticular implementation of this approach, called probabilistic RSA (pRSA)\nwith measurement models, which uses representational dissimilarity matrices\n(RDMs) as the summary statistics. We validate this method by simulations of\nfMRI measurements (locally averaging voxels) based on a deep convolutional\nneural network for visual object recognition. Results indicate that the way the\nmeasurements sample the activity patterns strongly affects the apparent\nrepresentational dissimilarities. However, modelling of the measurement process\ncan account for these effects and different BCMs remain distinguishable even\nunder substantial noise. The pRSA method enables us to perform Bayesian\ninference on the set of BCMs and to recognise the data-generating model in each\ncase.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 9 figures"]}]

Due to subtle facial movement of micro-expressions,\nfeature extraction has become an important and critical issue for spontaneous\nfacial micro-expression recognition. Recent works usually used spatiotemporal\nlocal binary pattern for micro-expression analysis. However, the commonly used\nspatiotemporal local binary pattern considers dynamic texture information to\nrepresent face images while misses the shape attribute of face images. On the\nother hand, their works extracted the spatiotemporal features from the global\nface regions, which ignore the discriminative information between two\nmicro-expression classes. The above-mentioned problems seriously limit the\napplication of spatiotemporal local binary pattern on micro-expression\nrecognition. In this paper, we propose a discriminative spatiotemporal local\nbinary pattern based on an improved integral projection to resolve the problems\nof spatiotemporal local binary pattern for micro-expression recognition.\nFirstly, we develop an improved integral projection for preserving the shape\nattribute of micro-expressions. Furthermore, an improved integral projection is\nincorporated with local binary pattern operators across spatial and temporal\ndomains.

Since the\nsolutions are global uniformly convergent, they are able to extract smallest\npossible gravitational signals from modern and future satellite tracking\nmeasurements for global high-precision, high-resolution gravitational models.\nBy directly turning the nonlinear differential equations of satellite motion\ninto the nonlinear integral equations, we reformulate the links between\nsatellite tracking measurements and the global uniformly convergent solutions\nto the Newton's governing differential equations as a condition adjustment\nmodel with equality constraints.\n","Comment: 34 pages, 1 figure"]}]

One way to characterize the roughness strength is the dependency of\nthe thermal conductivity on the channel width in the form W^{\\beta}. Although\nin the case of electronic transport this dependency is very well studied,\nresulting in W^6 for nanowires and quantum wells and W^4 for nanoribbons, in\nthe case of phonon transport it is not yet clear what this dependence is.
