The dependence of the energy splitting with increasing Hund\ncoupling yields evidence for a true QCP in the thermodynamic limit near the\nputative one, at which the s-wave and d-wave Cooper pairs are degenerate. A\ncollective s-to-d-wave oscillation of the macroscopic superconductor that\ncouples to orthorhombic shear strain is also identified. Its resonant frequency\nis predicted to collapse to zero at the QCP in the limit of low hole\nconcentration. This implies degeneracy of Cooper pairs with s, d and s+id\nsymmetry in the corresponding quantum critical state. We argue that the\ncritical state describes Cooper pairs in hole-doped iron superconductors at the\nLifshitz transition, where electron bands first rise above the Fermi level. We\nthereby predict that the s-to-d-wave collective mode observed by Raman\nspectroscopy in Ba1-xKxFe2As2 at optimal doping should also be observed at\nhigher doping near the Lifshitz transition.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables + supplemental material.

The other symmetry yields strong dynamical\nrelations between correlation and response functions which can notably simplify\nthe numerical analysis of these problems. Our construction allows us to clarify\nsome misconceptions on multiplicative white-noise stochastic processes that can\nbe found in the literature. In particular, we show that a first-order\ndifferential equation with multiplicative white noise can be transformed into\nan additive-noise equation, but that the latter keeps a non-trivial memory of\nthe discretisation prescription used to define the former.\n","Comment: 44 pages"]}]

To do so, we consider families of triangulations built out of\nsimplices with colored faces. Those simplices can be glued to form new building\nblocks, called bubbles which are pseudo-manifolds with boundaries. Bubbles can\nin turn be glued together to form triangulations. The main challenge is to\nclassify the triangulations built from a given set of bubbles with respect to\ntheir numbers of bubbles and simplices of codimension two. While the colored\ntriangulations which maximize the number of simplices of codimension two at\nfixed number of simplices are series-parallel objects called melonic\ntriangulations, this is not always true anymore when restricting attention to\ncolored triangulations built from specific bubbles. This opens up the\npossibility of new universality classes of colored triangulations. We present\nthree existing strategies to find those universality classes.

Plasmonic cavities are also utilized for\nterahertz quantum-cascade lasers (QCLs), which are the brightest available\nsolid-state sources of terahertz radiation. A long standing challenge for\nspasers is their poor coupling to the far-field radiation. Unlike conventional\nlasers that could produce directional beams, spasers have highly divergent\nradiation patterns due to their subwavelength apertures. Here, we theoretically\nand experimentally demonstrate a new technique for implementing\ndistributed-feedback (DFB) that is distinct from any other previously utilized\nDFB schemes for semiconductor lasers. The so-termed antenna-feedback scheme\nleads to single-mode operation in plasmonic lasers, couples the resonant SPP\nmode to a highly directional far-field radiation pattern, and integrates hybrid\nSPPs in surrounding medium into the operation of the DFB lasers.\nExperimentally, the antenna-feedback method, which does not require the phase\nmatching to a well-defined effective index, is implemented for terahertz QCLs,\nand single-mode terahertz QCLs with beam divergence as small as 4 x 4 degree\nare demonstrated, which is the narrowest beam reported for any terahertz QCL\nto-date. Moreover, in contrast to negligible radiative-field in conventional\nphotonic band-edge lasers, in which the periodicity follows the integer\nmultiple of half-wavelength inside active medium, antenna-feedback breaks this\ninteger-limit for the first time and enhances the radiative-field of lasing\nmode. The antenna-feedback scheme is generally applicable to any plasmonic\nlaser with a Fabry-Perot cavity irrespective of its operating wavelength, and\ncould bring plasmonic lasers closer to practical applications.\n"]}]

For example, the delay step must\ncorrespond to the spectral bandwidth measured with large enough SNR a condition\nthat limits the temporal resolution of the reconstructed pulse, obscures\nmeasurements of weak broadband pulses, and makes measurement of broadband\nmid-IR pulses hard and slow because the spectrograms become huge.

The ptychographic reconstruction algorithm is significantly\nfaster and more robust to noise than current FROG algorithms, which are based\non generalized projections (GP).

For the case of zero error\nprobability, our achievability and converse bounds match. For the VLSF case, we\nprovide achievability bounds that exploit the following feature of BEC: the\ndecoder can assess the correctness of its estimate by verifying whether the\nchosen codeword is the only one that is compatible with the erasure pattern.\nOne of these bounds is obtained by analyzing the performance of a\nvariable-length extension of random linear fountain codes. The gap between the\nVLSF achievability and the VLF converse bound, when number of messages is\nsmall, is significant: $23\\%$ for 8 messages on a BEC with erasure probability\n$0.5.$ The absence of a tight VLSF converse bound does not allow us to assess\nwhether this gap is fundamental.\n","Comment: Extended version of a paper to be presented at ITW 2016"]}]

IoT unlocks many exciting new opportunities in a variety of\napplications in research and industry domains. However, many have complained\nabout the absence of the real-world IoT data. Unsurprisingly, a common question\nthat arises regularly nowadays is \"Does the IoT already exist?\". So far, little\nhas been known about the real-world situation on IoT, its attributes, the\npresentation of data and user interests. To answer this question, in this work,\nwe conduct an in-depth analytical investigation on real IoT data. More\nspecifically, we identify IoT data sources over the Web and develop a crawler\nengine to collect large-scale real-world IoT data for the first time. We make\nthe results of our work available to the public in order to assist the\ncommunity in the future research. In particular, we collect the data of nearly\ntwo million Internet connected objects and study trends in IoT using a\nreal-world query set from an IoT search engine. Based on the collected data and\nour analysis, we identify the typical characteristics of IoT data. The most\nintriguing finding of our study is that IoT data is mainly disseminated using\nWeb Mapping while the emerging IoT solutions such as the Web of Things, are\ncurrently not well adopted. On top of our findings, we further discuss future\nchallenges and open research problems in the IoT area.\n"]}]

This paper discusses how\nto rigorously realize volume conservation in finite strain regime, especially\nwhen the unloading stress free configuration is not adopted or unique in the\nelastoplastic theories. An accurate condition of volume conservation is\nclarified and used in this paper that the density of a volume element after the\napplied loads are completely removed should be identical to that of the initial\nstress free states. For the elastoplastic theories that adopt the unloading\nstress free configuration (i.e. the intermediate configuration), the accurate\ncondition of volume conservation is satisfied only if specific definitions of\nthe plastic strain rate are used among many other different definitions. For\nthe elastoplastic theories that do not adopt the unloading stress free\nconfiguration, it is even more difficult to realize volume conservation as the\ninformation of the stress free state lacks. To find a universal approach of\nrealizing volume conservation for elastoplastic theories whether or not adopt\nthe unloading stress free configuration, we propose a single assumption that\nthe density of material only depends on the trace of the Cauchy stress, and\ninterestingly find that the zero trace of the plastic stress rate is equivalent\nto the accurate condition of volume conservation. Two strategies are further\nproposed to satisfy the accurate condition of volume conservation: directly and\nslightly revising the tangential stiffness tensor or using a properly chosen\nstress/strain measure and elastic compliance tensor.

A popular and\npowerful approach is to exploit the available moment generating function (or\nLaplace transform) of received signal and interference, whenever it exists, by\napplying the Gil-Pelaez inversion formula. However, with the stochastic\ngeometric modeling, the moment generating function may either be too\ncomplicated to exist in closed-form or at worst may not exist. Toward this end,\nin this paper, we study two alternate ways of evaluating the SINR outage. In\nthe first case, we emphasize the significance of calculating cumulants over\nmoments and exploit the fact that the cumulants of point processes are easily\ncalculable using Campbell's theorem. The SINR outage is then analytically\ncharacterized by Charlier expansion based on Gaussian and Student's\n$t$-distributions and their associated Hermite and Krishnamoorthy polynomials.\nIn the second case, we exploit the saddle point method, which gives a\nsemi-analytical method of calculating the SINR outage, whenever the cumulant\ngenerating function of received signal and interference exists. For the purpose\nof demonstration, we apply these techniques on a downlink cellular network\nmodel where a typical user experiences a coordinated multi-point transmission,\nand the base stations are modeled by homogeneous Poisson point process.

For these applications, an important\nongoing challenge is to develop Riemannian-geometric tools which are adapted to\nstructured covariance matrices. The present paper proposes to meet this\nchallenge by introducing a new class of probability distributions, Gaussian\ndistributions of structured covariance matrices. These are Riemannian analogs\nof Gaussian distributions, which only sample from covariance matrices having a\npreassigned structure, such as complex, Toeplitz, or block-Toeplitz. The\nusefulness of these distributions stems from three features: (1) they are\ncompletely tractable, analytically or numerically, when dealing with large\ncovariance matrices, (2) they provide a statistical foundation to the concept\nof structured Riemannian barycentre (i.e. Fr\\'echet or geometric mean), (3)\nthey lead to efficient statistical learning algorithms, which realise, among\nothers, density estimation and classification of structured covariance\nmatrices. The paper starts from the observation that several spaces of\nstructured covariance matrices, considered from a geometric point of view, are\nRiemannian symmetric spaces. Accordingly, it develops an original theory of\nGaussian distributions on Riemannian symmetric spaces, of their statistical\ninference, and of their relationship to the concept of Riemannian barycentre.\nThen, it uses this original theory to give a detailed description of Gaussian\ndistributions of three kinds of structured covariance matrices, complex,\nToeplitz, and block-Toeplitz.

Recent advances in observing and\nmanipulating charge and heat transport at the nanoscale, and recently developed\ntechniques for monitoring temperature at high temporal and spatial resolution,\nimply the need for considering electron transfer across thermal gradients.\nHere, a theory is developed for the rate of electron transfer and the\nassociated heat transport between donor-acceptor pairs located at sites of\ndifferent temperatures. To this end, through application of a generalized\nmultidimensional transition state theory, the traditional Arrhenius picture of\nactivation energy as a single point on a free energy surface is replaced with a\nbithermal property that is derived from statistical weighting over all\nconfigurations where the reactant and product states are equienergetic. The\nflow of energy associated with the electron transfer process is also examined,\nleading to relations between the rate of heat exchange among the donor and\nacceptor sites as functions of the temperature difference and the electronic\ndriving bias. In particular, we find that an open electron transfer channel\ncontributes to enhanced heat transport between sites even when they are in\nelectronic equilibrium.

The framework incorporates the\nwell-known properties of convex risk functions, namely, monotonicity,\nconvexity, translation invariance, and law invariance, as the general\ninformation about candidate risk functions, and also the feedbacks from\nindividuals, which include an initial estimate of the risk function and\npairwise comparisons among random losses, as the more specific information. Our\nframework is particularly novel in that unlike classical inverse optimization,\nno parametric assumption is made about the risk function, i.e. it is\nnon-parametric. We show how the resulting inverse optimization problems can be\nreformulated as convex programs and are polynomially solvable if the\ncorresponding forward problems are polynomially solvable.

Extension to Gaussian prime $q$, where $q$ can be\ncomplex, gives us a larger set of signal constellations to achieve different\nrates at different SNR. (2) We show how to divide the complex plane of $\\eta$\ninto different Voronoi regions such that the $\\eta$ within each Voronoi region\nshare the same optimal PNC mapping $(\\alpha_{opt},\\beta_{opt})$. We uncover the\nstructure of the Voronoi regions that allows us to compute a minimum-distance\nmetric that characterizes the SER of $w_N$ under optimal PNC mapping\n$(\\alpha_{opt},\\beta_{opt})$.

We\nstudy the performance of the proposed method using a synthetic trajectory\ndataset in 2D, as well as a dataset taken from AIS-based tracking of ships in\nan extended harbour area. We show that, in comparison to a baseline which is a\nparticle filter that estimates activity without exploiting such structure, our\nmethod achieves a better normalised error in predicting the trajectory as well\nas better time to convergence to a true class when compared against ground\ntruth.\n","Comment: 16 pages"]}]

The heavier\nmembers of the tower must behave more and more classically: they must be longer\nlived and decay into higher numbers of soft quanta.\n","Comment: 24 pages, Latex.

Harmonic guiding potentials are also the natural choice in single\nmolecule force spectroscopy experiments. The stiff spring approximation (SSA)\nof Schulten and coworkers enables to use the work performed along SMD\ntrajectories to obtain the PMF.\n  We discuss and demonstrate how a high spring constant, k, required for the\nvalidity of the SSA can violate another requirement of this theory, i.e., the\nvalidity of Brownian dynamics of the system. Violation of the Brownian\ncondition results in the introduction of kinetic energy contributions to the\nexternal work, performed during SMD simulations. These inertial effects result\nin skewed work distributions, rather than the Gaussian distributions predicted\nby SSA. The inertial effects also result in broader work distributions, which\nworsen the effect of the skewness when calculating work averages. Remarkably,\nour results strongly suggest that the skew and width of work distributions are\nindependent of the average drift velocity and physical asymmetries.\n  The skew and broadening of work distributions result in biased estimation of\nthe PMF. The bias manifests itself in the form of a systematic error that\nincreases with simulation time. We discuss the proper upper limit for k, such\nthat the inertial effects are avoided. This limit, used together with the\nrelation for the lower limit of k, enables to conduct accurate steering while\nsatisfying the Brownian dynamics. Furthermore, we argue and demonstrate that\nusing the peak-value (rather than the statistical mean) of the work\ndistributions vastly reduces the bias in the calculated PMFs and improves the\naccuracy.\n"]}]
