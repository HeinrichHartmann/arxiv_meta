The dependence of the energy splitting with increasing Hund\ncoupling yields evidence for a true QCP in the thermodynamic limit near the\nputative one, at which the s-wave and d-wave Cooper pairs are degenerate. A\ncollective s-to-d-wave oscillation of the macroscopic superconductor that\ncouples to orthorhombic shear strain is also identified. Its resonant frequency\nis predicted to collapse to zero at the QCP in the limit of low hole\nconcentration. This implies degeneracy of Cooper pairs with s, d and s+id\nsymmetry in the corresponding quantum critical state. We argue that the\ncritical state describes Cooper pairs in hole-doped iron superconductors at the\nLifshitz transition, where electron bands first rise above the Fermi level. We\nthereby predict that the s-to-d-wave collective mode observed by Raman\nspectroscopy in Ba1-xKxFe2As2 at optimal doping should also be observed at\nhigher doping near the Lifshitz transition.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables + supplemental material.

Our construction allows us to clarify\nsome misconceptions on multiplicative white-noise stochastic processes that can\nbe found in the literature. In particular, we show that a first-order\ndifferential equation with multiplicative white noise can be transformed into\nan additive-noise equation, but that the latter keeps a non-trivial memory of\nthe discretisation prescription used to define the former.\n","Comment: 44 pages"]}]

We\nstudy the angle between the subspaces spanned by this dictionary and an optimal\ndictionary, and we conclude that the multiband modulated DPSS dictionary--which\nis simple to construct and more flexible than the optimal dictionary in\npractical applications--is nearly optimal for representing multiband sample\nvectors.

More specifically, we\ninsist on generalizing the two-dimensional notion of $p$-angulations to higher\ndimensions. To do so, we consider families of triangulations built out of\nsimplices with colored faces. Those simplices can be glued to form new building\nblocks, called bubbles which are pseudo-manifolds with boundaries. Bubbles can\nin turn be glued together to form triangulations. The main challenge is to\nclassify the triangulations built from a given set of bubbles with respect to\ntheir numbers of bubbles and simplices of codimension two. While the colored\ntriangulations which maximize the number of simplices of codimension two at\nfixed number of simplices are series-parallel objects called melonic\ntriangulations, this is not always true anymore when restricting attention to\ncolored triangulations built from specific bubbles. This opens up the\npossibility of new universality classes of colored triangulations. We present\nthree existing strategies to find those universality classes. The first two\nstrategies consist in building new bubbles from old ones for which the problem\ncan be solved. The third strategy is a bijection between those colored\ntriangulations and stuffed, edge-colored maps, which are some sort of hypermaps\nwhose hyperedges are replaced with edge-colored maps.

We find that especially effects\nwhich involve integrals along the line of sight (lensing convergence, time\ndelay and the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect -- ISW) can be considerably\nmodified, and even lead to $\\mathcal{O}(1000\\%)$ deviations from General\nRelativity in the case of the ISW effect for Galileon models, for which\nstandard probes such as the growth function only vary by $\\mathcal{O}(10\\%)$.\nThese effects become dominant when correlating galaxy number counts at\ndifferent redshifts and can lead to $\\sim 50\\%$ deviations in the total signal\nthat might be observable by future LSS surveys. Because of their integrated\nnature, these deep-redshift cross-correlations are sensitive to modifications\nof gravity even when probing eras much before dark energy domination. We\nfurther isolate the ISW effect using the cross-correlation between LSS and CMB\ntemperature anisotropies and use current data to further constrain Horndeski\nmodels (abridged).\n","Comment: 30 pages plus appendices, 9 figures.

It appears that these regimes take place for\ndifferent signs of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling $\\alpha$: \"pure\" Kasner regime\noccur for $\\alpha > 0$ at low D and $\\alpha < 0$ for high D; anisotropic\nexponential regime is reached only for $\\alpha > 0$. So if we restrain\nourselves with $\\alpha > 0$ solutions, the only late-time regimes are Kasner\nfor D=1, 2 and anisotropic exponential for $D\\geqslant 2$. Also, low-energy\nKasner regimes ($a(t)\\propto t^p$) have expansion rates for (3+1)-dimensional\nsubspace (\"our Universe\") ranging from p=0.5 (D=1) to $p=1/\\sqrt{3} \\approx\n0.577$ ($D\\to\\infty$), which contradicts with dust-dominated Friedmann\nprediction (p=2/3).\n","Comment: 34 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables"]}]

In particular we show that\nthe technique can accommodate other symmetries commuting with the permutation\naction, and permutation-invariant linear constraints. We then demonstrate that,\nin some cases, it is also fruitful with convex constraints, in particular\nseparability in a bipartite setting. This is a constraint particularly\ninteresting in the context of the complexity class $\\mathrm{QMA}(2)$ of\ninteractive quantum Merlin-Arthur games with unentangled provers, and our\nresults relate to the soundness gap amplification of $\\mathrm{QMA}(2)$\nprotocols by parallel repetition. It is also relevant for the regularization of\ncertain entropic channel parameters. Finally, we explore an extension to\ninfinite-dimensional systems, which usually pose inherent problems to de\nFinetti techniques in the quantum case.\n","Comment: 19 pages"]}]

In FROG, a\nreconstruction algorithm retrieves the pulse from a measured spectrogram, yet\ncurrent FROG reconstruction algorithms require and exhibit several restricting\nfeatures that weaken FROG performances. For example, the delay step must\ncorrespond to the spectral bandwidth measured with large enough SNR a condition\nthat limits the temporal resolution of the reconstructed pulse, obscures\nmeasurements of weak broadband pulses, and makes measurement of broadband\nmid-IR pulses hard and slow because the spectrograms become huge.

The ptychographic reconstruction algorithm is significantly\nfaster and more robust to noise than current FROG algorithms, which are based\non generalized projections (GP). We demonstrate, numerically and\nexperimentally, that ptychographic reconstruction works well with very partial\nspectrograms, e. g. spectrograms with reduced number of measured delays and\nspectrograms that have been substantially spectrally filtered.

However, with the stochastic\ngeometric modeling, the moment generating function may either be too\ncomplicated to exist in closed-form or at worst may not exist. Toward this end,\nin this paper, we study two alternate ways of evaluating the SINR outage. In\nthe first case, we emphasize the significance of calculating cumulants over\nmoments and exploit the fact that the cumulants of point processes are easily\ncalculable using Campbell's theorem. The SINR outage is then analytically\ncharacterized by Charlier expansion based on Gaussian and Student's\n$t$-distributions and their associated Hermite and Krishnamoorthy polynomials.\nIn the second case, we exploit the saddle point method, which gives a\nsemi-analytical method of calculating the SINR outage, whenever the cumulant\ngenerating function of received signal and interference exists. For the purpose\nof demonstration, we apply these techniques on a downlink cellular network\nmodel where a typical user experiences a coordinated multi-point transmission,\nand the base stations are modeled by homogeneous Poisson point process. For the\nconvenience of readers, we also provide a brief overview of moments, cumulants,\ntheir generating functions, and Campbell's theorem, without invoking measure\ntheory.

For these applications, an important\nongoing challenge is to develop Riemannian-geometric tools which are adapted to\nstructured covariance matrices. The present paper proposes to meet this\nchallenge by introducing a new class of probability distributions, Gaussian\ndistributions of structured covariance matrices. These are Riemannian analogs\nof Gaussian distributions, which only sample from covariance matrices having a\npreassigned structure, such as complex, Toeplitz, or block-Toeplitz. The\nusefulness of these distributions stems from three features: (1) they are\ncompletely tractable, analytically or numerically, when dealing with large\ncovariance matrices, (2) they provide a statistical foundation to the concept\nof structured Riemannian barycentre (i.e. Fr\\'echet or geometric mean), (3)\nthey lead to efficient statistical learning algorithms, which realise, among\nothers, density estimation and classification of structured covariance\nmatrices. The paper starts from the observation that several spaces of\nstructured covariance matrices, considered from a geometric point of view, are\nRiemannian symmetric spaces. Accordingly, it develops an original theory of\nGaussian distributions on Riemannian symmetric spaces, of their statistical\ninference, and of their relationship to the concept of Riemannian barycentre.\nThen, it uses this original theory to give a detailed description of Gaussian\ndistributions of three kinds of structured covariance matrices, complex,\nToeplitz, and block-Toeplitz. Finally, it describes algorithms for density\nestimation and classification of structured covariance matrices, based on\nGaussian distribution mixture models.\n","Comment: Preprint version 0"]}]

In a stimulated emission process, an incoming photon enhances the\nprobability that an excited atomic state will transition to a lower energy\nstate and generate a second photon of the same energy. It is expected, but not\nexperimentally shown, that stimulated emission contributes significantly to the\nzero resistance current in a superconductor by enhancing the probability that\nscattered Cooper pairs will return to the macroscopically occupied condensate\ninstead of entering any other state. Here, we use time- and angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy to study the initial rise of the non-equilibrium\nquasiparticle population in a Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\\delta}$ cuprate\nsuperconductor induced by an ultrashort laser pulse.

For a theoretical support\nof the proposed method, we prove that the Laplace approximated posterior\nconverges to the actual posterior under certain conditions and analyze the\nrelation between the order of numerical error and its Laplace approximation.\nThe proposed method is tested on simulated data sets and compared with the\nother existing methods.\n"]}]

We also show that a split of the gradient micro-inertia\n$\\bar{\\eta}\\lVert\\nabla u_{,t}\\rVert^{2}$, in the sense of Cartan-Lie\ndecomposition of matrices, allows to flatten separately longitudinal and\ntransverse optic branches thus giving the possibility of a second band-gap.\nFinally, we investigate the effect of the gradient inertia\n$\\bar{\\eta}\\lVert\\nabla u_{,t}\\rVert^{2}$ on more classical enriched models as\nthe Mindlin-Eringen and the internal variable ones. We find that the addition\nof such gradient micro-inertia allows for the onset of one band-gap in the\nMindlin-Eringen model and of three band-gaps in the internal variable model. In\nthis last case, however, non-local effects cannot be accounted for which is a\ntoo drastic simplification for most metamaterials. We conclude that, even when\nadding gradient micro-inertia terms, the relaxed micromorphic model remains the\nmost performing one, among the considered enriched model, for the description\nof non-local band-gap metamaterials.\n"]}]

The bias manifests itself in the form of a systematic error that\nincreases with simulation time. We discuss the proper upper limit for k, such\nthat the inertial effects are avoided. This limit, used together with the\nrelation for the lower limit of k, enables to conduct accurate steering while\nsatisfying the Brownian dynamics. Furthermore, we argue and demonstrate that\nusing the peak-value (rather than the statistical mean) of the work\ndistributions vastly reduces the bias in the calculated PMFs and improves the\naccuracy.\n"]}]
