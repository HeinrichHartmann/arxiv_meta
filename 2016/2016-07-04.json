The main claim is that a single mode of the lathe radiation is\nmaximally entangled with the mode inside the horizon and simultaneously with\nthe modes of early Hawking radiation. We argue that this situation never\nhappens during the evolution of a black hole. Quantum mechanics tells us that\nwhile the black hole exists, unitary evolution maximally entangles a late mode\nlocated just outside the horizon with a combination of early radiation and\nblack hole states, instead of either of them separately. One of the reasons for\nthis is that the black hole radiation is not random and strongly depends on the\ngeometry and charge of the black hole, as detailed numerical calculations of\nHawking evaporation clearly show. As a consequence, one can't factor out the\nstate of the black hole. However, this extended entanglement between the black\nhole and modes of early and late radiation indicates that, as the black hole\nages, the local Rindler horizon is modified out to macroscopic distances from\nthe black hole. Fundamentally non-local physics nor firewalls are not necessary\nto explain this result.

We\nprovide a simple and insightful formula for the approximate capacity of this\nchannel with bounded guarantee on the approximation gap independent of system\nparameters. This approximate characterization of the capacity identifies two\nqualitatively different operating regimes for this channel: in the large\nbattery regime, when $\\bar{B}\\geq \\bar{E}$, the capacity is approximately equal\nto that of an AWGN channel with an average power constraint equal to the\naverage energy harvesting rate, i.e. it depends only on the mean of $E_t$ and\nis (almost) independent of the distribution of $E_t$ and the exact value of\n$\\bar{B}$.

Second, we are not aware of other simulators\nwith similar wireless models that allow full system studies to be conducted,\nsuch as performance evaluation of upper-layer protocols in a coexistence\nenvironment.

By using a biophysical\nmodel that incorporates autaptic coupling, we here show that self-innervation\nof neurons participates in the modulation of irregular neuronal firing,\nprimarily by regulating the occurrence frequency of burst firing. In\nparticular, we find that both excitatory and electrical autapses increase the\noccurrence of burst firing, thus reducing neuronal firing regularity.

Methodological statisticians routinely write\nsimulations to compare their methods to preexisting ones. While developing\nideas, there is a temptation to write \"quick and dirty\" simulations to try out\nideas. This approach of rapid prototyping is useful but can sometimes backfire\nif bugs are introduced. Using the simulator allows one to remove the \"dirty\"\nwithout sacrificing the \"quick.\" Coding is quick because the statistician\nfocuses exclusively on those aspects of the simulation that are specific to the\nparticular paper being written. Code written with the simulator is succinct,\nhighly readable, and easily shared with others. The modular nature of\nsimulations written with the simulator promotes code reusability, which saves\ntime and facilitates reproducibility. The syntax of the simulator leads to\nsimulation code that is easily human-readable. Other benefits of using the\nsimulator include the ability to \"step in\" to a simulation and change one\naspect without having to rerun the entire simulation from scratch, the\nstraightforward integration of parallel computing into simulations, and the\nability to rapidly generate plots, tables, and reports with minimal effort.\n"]}]

Three nuclear quadrupole interaction\nsignals were detected and their equilibrium site fractions were measured up to\n700 oC. Two signals have well-defined electric field gradients (EFGs) and are\nattributed to In-probes on Gd- and Ni-sites in a well-ordered lattice. A third,\ninhomogeneously broadened signal was observed at low temperature. This is\nattributed to trapping, or segregation, of In-probes to lattice sinks such as\ngrain boundaries (GB) that have a large multiplicity of local environments and\nEFGs. Changes in site fractions were reversible above 300oC. Measurements were\nmade on a pair of samples that were richer and poorer in Gd. Remarkably, the\nGB-site was populated only in the more Gd-rich sample. This is explained by the\nhypothesis that excess Gd segregates to the grain boundaries and provides a\nlower enthalpy environment for In-probe atoms. Observations are discussed in\nrelation to a three-level quantum system. Enthalpy differences between levels\nwere determined from measurements of temperature dependences of ratios of site\nfractions. The enthalpy of transfer of In-probes from the Gd- to Ni-sublattice\nwas found to be much smaller in the Gd-rich sample. This is attributed to a\nlarge temperature-dependence in the degeneracies of levels available to\nIn-solutes in the phase, leading to an effective transfer enthalpy that differs\ngreatly from the difference in site-enthalpies.

For modern\napplications, these linear systems are often nonsymmetric due to the nature of\nthe PDEs, the boundary or jump conditions, or the discretization methods. While\na number of preconditioned KSP methods and their implementations are readily\navailable, it is often unclear to users which ones are the best choices for\ndifferent classes of problems. In this work, we present a systematic comparison\nof some representative KSP methods and preconditioners. We consider four KSP\nmethods, namely restarted GMRES, TFQMR, BiCGSTAB, and QMRCGSTAB, coupled with\nthree preconditioners, namely Gauss-Seidel, incomplete LU factorization (ILU),\nand algebraic multigrid (AMG). We assess these preconditioned KSP methods using\nlarge, sparse, nonsymmetric linear systems arising from PDE discretizations in\n2D and 3D. We compare the convergence and timing results of these different\ncombinations, and assess the scalability of these methods with respect to the\nnumber of unknowns. Our results show that GMRES tends to deliver the best\nperformance when coupled with AMG preconditioners, but it is far less\ncompetitive than the other three methods due to restarts when using\nGauss-Seidel or ILU preconditioners. Our results also show that the\nsmoothed-aggregation AMG delivers better performance and exhibits better\nscalability than classical AMG, but it is less robust, especially for\nill-conditioned systems. The study helps establish some practical guidelines\nfor choosing preconditioned KSP methods. It also motivates the further\ndevelopment of more effective and robust multigrid preconditioners for large,\nsparse, nonsymmetric, and potentially ill-conditioned linear systems.\n","Comment: Copper Mountain 2016, Special Issue"]}]

The main reason is that a clear formulation\nof the analogue of the Gribov horizon in the Landau gauge is obstructed by\ntechnical difficulties when more sophisticated gauges are chosen. Moreover, the\nRGZ action breaks BRST symmetry explicitly, making the task of extracting gauge\ninvariant results even more difficult.
