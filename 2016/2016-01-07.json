The combination of these features makes it\npossible to generate families of networks with different subgraph compositions\nwhile keeping classical network metrics constant.

One of the\nfundamental tenets of CCN is that data, or content, is a named and addressable\nentity in the network. Consumers request content by issuing interest messages\nwith the desired content name. These interests are forwarded by routers to\nproducers, and the resulting content object is returned and optionally cached\nat each router along the path. In-network caching makes it difficult to enforce\naccess control policies on sensitive content outside of the producer since\nrouters only use interest information for forwarding decisions. To that end, we\npropose an Interest-Based Access Control (IBAC) scheme that enables access\ncontrol enforcement using only information contained in interest messages,\ni.e., by making sensitive content names unpredictable to unauthorized parties.\nOur IBAC scheme supports both hash- and encryption-based name obfuscation. We\naddress the problem of interest replay attacks by formulating a mutual trust\nframework between producers and consumers that enables routers to perform\nauthorization checks when satisfying interests from their cache. We assess the\ncomputational, storage, and bandwidth overhead of each IBAC variant.

We fully justify these requirements.

We address\nthe question of whether a complex network of nonlinear oscillators can maintain\nits synchronization stability as it expands or grows. A network in the real\nworld can never be completely synchronized due to noise and/or external\ndisturbances. This is especially the case when, mathematically, the transient\nsynchronous state during the growth process becomes marginally stable, as a\nlocal perturbation can trigger a rapid deviation of the system from the\nvicinity of the synchronous state. In terms of the nodal dynamics, a large\nscale avalanche over the entire network can be triggered in the sense that the\nindividual nodal dynamics diverge from the synchronous state in a cascading\nmanner within a short time period. Because of the high dimensionality of the\nnetworked system, the transient process for the system to recover to the\nsynchronous state can be extremely long. Introducing a tolerance threshold to\nidentify the desynchronized nodes, we find that, after an initial stage of\nlinear growth, the network typically evolves into a critical state where the\naddition of a single new node can cause a group of nodes to lose\nsynchronization, leading to synchronization collapse for the entire network. A\nstatistical analysis indicates that, the distribution of the size of the\ncollapse is approximately algebraic (power law), regardless of the fluctuations\nin the system parameters. This is indication of the emergence of self-organized\ncriticality.

Results\nreported by both BaBar and Belle in the summer of 2001 verified the Kobayashi\nMaskawa idea and led to their Nobel prizes in 2008. In addition to studies of\nCP violation, Belle (and BaBar) reported a large number of important results on\na wide variety of other subjects, many of which that had nothing to do with B\nmesons. In this talk I cover three (of many) subjects where Belle measurements\nhave had a significant impact on specific sub-fields of hadron physics but are\nnot generally well know.

In\nthis paper, inter-tier interference suppression techniques are considered in\nthe contexts of collaborative processing and cooperative radio resource\nallocation (CRRA).

Unfortunately, a\ncollection of problems that are simply placed inside the P-solvable\noptimization class PO never have been studiously analyzed regarding their exact\ncomputational complexity. To improve this situation, the existing framework\nbased on polynomial-time computability needs to be expanded and further refined\nfor an insightful analysis of various approximation algorithms targeting\noptimization problems within PO. In particular, we deal with those problems\ncharacterized in terms of logarithmic-space computations and uniform-circuit\ncomputations. We are focused on nondeterministic logarithmic-space (NL)\noptimization problems or NPO problems. Our study covers a wide range of\noptimization and approximation classes, dubbed as, NLO, LO, APXL, and LSAS as\nwell as new classes NC1O, APXNC1, NC1AS, and AC0O, which are founded on uniform\nfamilies of Boolean circuits. Although many NL decision problems can be\nnaturally converted into NL optimization (NLO) problems, few NLO problems have\nbeen studied vigorously. We thus provide a number of new NLO problems falling\ninto those low-complexity classes. With the help of NC1 or AC0\napproximation-preserving reductions, we also identify the most difficult\nproblems (known as complete problems) inside those classes. Finally, we\ndemonstrate a number of collapses and separations among those refined\noptimization and approximation classes with or without unproven\ncomplexity-theoretical assumptions.\n","Comment: (37 pages, A4, 10pt, 1 figure) This is a complete version of a\n  preliminary report, which appeared in the Proceedings of the 7th\n  International Conference on Combinatorial Optimization and Applications\n  (COCOA 2013), Chengdu, China, December 12--14, 2013, Lecture Notes in\n  Computer Science, Springer-Verlag, vol.8287, pp.318--329, 2013"]}]

The emission\nrate has been expressed in terms of the discontinuities or imaginary part of\nthe photon self energy in the thermal bath. The photon and dilepton emissions\nhave been computed by taking into account the in-medium modifications of the\nparticles appearing in the internal loop of the self energy diagram using a\nphenomenological effective lagrangian approach.
