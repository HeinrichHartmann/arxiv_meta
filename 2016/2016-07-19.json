Reactive\nchanneling occurs where volatile-rich melts flux the base of the silicate\nmelting region, enhancing dissolution of fusible components from the ambient\nmantle.

In particular, we introduce the Balanced RePartitioning (BRP) problem:\nGiven an arbitrary sequence of pairwise communication requests between $n$\nnodes, with patterns that may change over time, the objective is to dynamically\npartition the nodes into $\\ell$ clusters, each of size $k$, at a minimum cost.\nEvery communication request needs to be served: if the communicating nodes are\nlocated in the same cluster, the request is served locally, at cost 0; if the\nnodes are located in different clusters, the request is served remotely using\ninter-cluster communication, at cost 1. The partitioning can be updated\ndynamically (i.e., repartitioned), by migrating nodes between clusters at cost\n$\\alpha$ per node migration. The goal is to devise online algorithms which find\na good trade-off between the communication and the migration cost, i.e., \"rent\"\nor \"buy\", while maintaining partitions which minimize the number of\ninter-cluster communications. BRP features interesting connections to other\nwell-known online problems. In particular, we show that scenarios with $\\ell=2$\ngeneralize online paging, and scenarios with $k=2$ constitute a novel online\nversion of maximum matching. We consider settings both with and without\ncluster-size augmentation. Somewhat surprisingly, we prove that any\ndeterministic online algorithm has a competitive ratio of at least $k$, even\nwith augmentation. Our main technical contribution is an $O(k\n\\log{k})$-competitive deterministic algorithm for the setting with (constant)\naugmentation.

For non-nuclear $C^{\\ast}$-algebras we find new obstructions for\nstability by relating it to Voiculescu's free entropy dimension. We show that\nthe class of C*-algebras that are stable with respect to tracial norms on\nreal-rank-zero C*-algebras is closed under tensoring with commutative\nC*-algebras. We show that $C(X)$ is tracially stable with respect to tracial\nnorms on all $C^{\\ast}$-algebras if and only if $X$ is approximately\npath-connected.

Here we carry out NEMD simulations on a model polyamide RO\nmembrane to understand the mechanisms of transport and rejection of both ionic\nand neutral contaminants in water. We observe that the rejection changes\nnon-monotonously with ion sizes. In particular, the rejection of urea, 2.4 A\nradius, is higher than ethanol, 2.6 A radius, and the rejections for organic\nsolutes, 2.2-2.8 A radius, are lower than Na+, 1.4 A radius, or Cl-, 2.3 A\nradius. We show that this can be explained in terms of the solute accessible\nintermolecular volume in the membrane and the solute-water pair interaction\nenergy. If the smallest open spaces in the membrane's molecular structure are\nall larger than the hydrated solute, then the solute-water pair interaction\nenergy does not matter. However, when the open spaces in the polymeric\nstructure are such that solutes have to shed at least one water molecule to\npass through a portion of the membrane molecular structure, the pair\ninteraction energy governs solute rejection. The high pair interaction energy\nfor water molecules in the solvation shell for ions makes the water molecules\ndifficult to shed, thus enhancing the rejection of ions. On the other hand, the\norganic solute-water interaction energies are governed by the water molecules\nthat are hydrogen bonded to the solute. Urea molecules have more\nhydrogen-bonding sites than alcohol molecules, leading to a higher rejection of\nurea than occurs for ethanol, a molecule of similar size but with fewer\nhydrogen bonding sites. These findings underline the importance of the solute's\nsolvation shell and solute-water-membrane chemistry in the context of reverse\nosmosis, thus providing new insights into solute transport and rejection in RO\nmembranes.\n"]}]

The best time complexity for CVP is\ncurrently $2^{0.377d}$ [BGJ'14].\n  In this paper we revisit sieving algorithms for solving SVP, and study how\nthese algorithms can be modified to solve CVP and its variants as well. Our\nfirst method is aimed at solving one problem instance and minimizes the overall\ntime complexity for a single CVP instance with a time complexity of\n$2^{0.292d}$. Our second method minimizes the amortized time complexity for\nseveral instances on the same lattice, at the cost of a larger preprocessing\ncost. We can solve the closest vector problem with preprocessing (CVPP) with\n$2^{0.636d}$ space and preprocessing, in $2^{0.136d}$ time, while the query\ncomplexity can even be reduced to $2^{\\epsilon d}$ at the cost of preprocessing\ntime and memory complexities of $(1/\\epsilon)^{O(d)}$.\n  For easier variants of CVP, such as approximate CVP and bounded distance\ndecoding (BDD), we further show how the preprocessing method achieves even\nbetter complexities. For instance, we can solve approximate CVPP with large\napproximation factors $k$ with polynomial-sized advice in polynomial time if $k\n= \\Omega(\\sqrt{d/\\log d})$, heuristically closing the gap between the\ndecision-CVPP result of [AR'04] and the search-CVPP result of [DRS'14].\n","Comment: 23rd Conference on Selected Areas in Cryptography (SAC), 2016"]}]

Based on this single feature, it was\npossible to raise predictive accuracy on a malware detection task from 50.0% to\n68.7%, even though the single feature was applied to a heterogeneous corpus of\nmalware discovered \"in the wild.\" In Experiment 2, we describe how\nwavelet-based decompositions of software entropy can be applied to a parasitic\nmalware detection task involving large numbers of samples and features. By\nextracting only string and entropy features (with wavelet decompositions) from\nsoftware samples, we are able to obtain almost 99% detection of parasitic\nmalware with fewer than 1% false positives on good files. Moreover, the\naddition of wavelet-based features uniformly improved detection performance\nacross plausible false positive rates, both in a strings-only model (e.g., from\n80.90% to 82.97%) and a strings-plus-entropy model (e.g. from 92.10% to 94.74%,\nand from 98.63% to 98.90%). Overall, wavelet decomposition of software entropy\ncan be useful for machine learning models for detecting malware based on\nextracting millions of features from executable files.\n","Comment: Development of work originally published in FLAIRS 2016 conference\n  proceedings.

These\nvirtual forces induce interactions among drones and structure the system\ntopology. The advantages of our approach are that (1) virtual forces enable\ndrones to self-organize the positioning process and (2) VBCA can be implemented\nentirely localized. Extensive simulations show that our virtual forces\nclustering approach produces scalable 3-D topologies exhibiting near-optimal\nvolume coverage. VBCA triggers efficient topology rearrangement for an altering\nnumber of nodes, while providing network connectivity to the central drone. We\nalso draw a comparison of volume coverage achieved by VBCA against existing\napproaches and find VBCA up to 40\\% more efficient.\n"]}]

Traditional measures of habitat selection and habitat quality require\ndata from resource intensive study designs (e.g., telemetry or mark-recapture).\nOften, managers must evaluate ecological value despite only having data from\nless resource intensive study designs. In this paper, we use occupancy data to\nmeasure habitat quality and habitat selection response for the Puerto Rican\nVireo, an endemic songbird whose population growth is depressed by brood\nparasitism from the Shiny Cowbird. We were interested in how vireo habitat\nquality and vireo habitat selection varied among three land uses (forest,\nshaded coffee plantations, and sun coffee) in Puerto Rico. We estimated vireo\noccupancy probability as a measure of habitat selection, and the probability of\ncowbird occurrence given vireo presence as a measure of habitat quality. To\nestimate the latter, we explored different ways of modeling the occurrence of\nthe two species jointly, and compared these models to independent models using\nmeasures of predictive performance. Vireos preferentially selected forested\nsites and shaded coffee sites over sun coffee sites. By our measure of habitat\nquality, either type of coffee plantation was poor quality, and the forested\nsites were high quality. This suggests that shade coffee may be an ecological\ntrap for the vireo in our study area. One joint model performed best by our\nmeasures of predictive ability, thus showing that the cowbird may not occur\nindependently of the vireo. Vireo population dynamics in our study area may\nbenefit from having large amounts of forest relative to coffee plantations.\nIncorporating species interactions into occupancy models has the potential to\nimprove monitoring for conservation.\n"]}]
