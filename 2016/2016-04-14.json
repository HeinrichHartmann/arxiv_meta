We find that the real spectrum of the\neffective Hamiltonian will depend on all new fundamental parameters introduced\nin the non-Hermitian PT symmetric extension of the usual neutrino oscillation\nformalism and that either i) the spectrum is exact and the effective leptonic\nmixing must always be maximal or ii) the spectrum is approximate and all new\nfundamental parameters must be small.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 1 figure.

A desirable capability of these agents is to respond to\ngoal-oriented commands by autonomously constructing task plans. However, such\nautonomy can add significant cognitive load and potentially introduce safety\nrisks to humans when agents behave unexpectedly. Hence, for such agents to be\nhelpful, one important requirement is for them to synthesize plans that can be\neasily understood by humans. While there exists previous work that studied\nsocially acceptable robots that interact with humans in \"natural ways\", and\nwork that investigated legible motion planning, there lacks a general solution\nfor high level task planning. To address this issue, we introduce the notions\nof plan {\\it explicability} and {\\it predictability}. To compute these\nmeasures, first, we postulate that humans understand agent plans by associating\nabstract tasks with agent actions, which can be considered as a labeling\nprocess. We learn the labeling scheme of humans for agent plans from training\nexamples using conditional random fields (CRFs). Then, we use the learned model\nto label a new plan to compute its explicability and predictability.

It was recently\nfound that, the high flux of neutrinos at $\\sim30$ TeV detected by IceCube lead\nto a cumulative gamma-ray flux exceeding the Fermi isotropic gamma-ray\nbackground at 10-100 GeV, implying that the neutrinos are produced by hidden\nsources of cosmic rays, where GeV-TeV gamma-rays are not transparent.

We consider the jet\npropagation in an extended,optically thick envelope around the black hole,\nwhich is resulted from the ejected material during the disruption. While\npowerful jets can break free from the envelope, less powerful jets would be\nchoked inside the envelope. The jets accelerate cosmic rays through internal\nshocks or reverse shocks and further produce neutrinos via interaction with the\nsurrounding dense medium or photons. All three TDE jets discovered so far are\nnot detected by Fermi/LAT, suggesting that GeV-TeV gamma-rays are absorbed in\nthese jets. The cumulative neutrino flux from TDE jets can account for the\nneutrino flux observed by IceCube at PeV energies and may also account for the\nhigher flux at $\\sim30$ TeV if less powerful, choked jets are present in the\nmajority of TDEs.\n"]}]

We devise multiple distance metrics to characterise the\ncomplex geometry of filaments, and find that galaxies closer to the cylindrical\ncentre of a filament have higher stellar masses than their counterparts near\nthe periphery of filaments, on the edges of voids. In addition, these\nperipheral spiral galaxies have higher specific star formation rates (SSFR) at\na given mass. Complementing our sample of filament spiral galaxies with spiral\ngalaxies in tendrils and voids, we find that the average SFR of these objects\nin different large scale environments are similar to each other with the\nprimary discriminant in SFR being stellar mass, in line with previous works.\nHowever, the distributions of SFRs are found to vary with large-scale\nenvironment. Our results thus suggest a model in which in addition to stellar\nmass as the primary discriminant, the large-scale environment is imprinted in\nthe SFR as a second order effect. Furthermore, our detailed results for\nfilament galaxies suggest a model in which gas accretion from voids onto\nfilaments is primarily in an orthogonal direction.

While many researchers have developed various systems to\nbring some of the benefits of static types to dynamic languages, prior\napproaches have trouble dealing with metaprogramming, which generates code as\nthe program executes. In this paper, we propose Hummingbird, a new system that\nuses a novel technique, just-in-time static type checking, to type check Ruby\ncode even in the presence of metaprogramming. In Hummingbird, method type\nsignatures are gathered dynamically at run-time, as those methods are created.\nWhen a method is called, Hummingbird statically type checks the method body\nagainst current type signatures. Thus, Hummingbird provides thorough static\nchecks on a per-method basis, while also allowing arbitrarily complex\nmetaprogramming. For performance, Hummingbird memoizes the static type checking\npass, invalidating cached checks only if necessary. We formalize Hummingbird\nusing a core, Ruby-like language and prove it sound. To evaluate Hummingbird,\nwe applied it to six apps, including three that use Ruby on Rails, a powerful\nframework that relies heavily on metaprogramming. We found that all apps\ntypecheck successfully using Hummingbird, and that Hummingbird's performance\noverhead is reasonable. We applied Hummingbird to earlier versions of one Rails\napp and found several type errors that had been introduced and then fixed.\nLastly, we demonstrate using Hummingbird in Rails development mode to typecheck\nan app as live updates are applied to it.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, 1 appendix, This is a preprint of a\n  paper to appear in Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI 2016)"]}]

The research was aimed at exploring the\npotential use of wireless sensor networks as an early-warning system to help\nmitigate human-wildlife conflicts occurring at the edge of a forest. There are\nthree important features to the development. Firstly, the sensor platform\nemploys multiple sensors arranged in the form of a two-dimensional array to\ngive it a key spatial-resolution capability that aids in classification.\nSecondly, given the challenges of collecting data involving animal intrusion,\nan Animation-based Simulation tool for Passive Infra-Red sEnsor (ASPIRE) was\ndeveloped that simulates signals corresponding to human and animal intrusion\nand some limited models of vegetative clutter. This speeded up the process of\nalgorithm development by allowing us to test different hypotheses in a\ntime-efficient manner. Finally, a chirplet-based model for intruder signal was\ndeveloped that significantly helped boost classification accuracy despite\ndrawing data from a smaller number of sensors. An SVM-based classifier was used\nwhich made use of chirplet, energy and signal cross-correlation-based features.\nThe average accuracy obtained for intruder detection and classification on\nreal-world and simulated data sets was in excess of 97%.\n"]}]

The band structure shows several narrow bands with nearly linear\nenergy dispersion and Dirac-cone-like points at the Fermi level.

The in-plane\ntransverse magnetoresistance exhibits a crossover at a critical field $B^*$\nfrom semiclassical weak-field $B^2$ dependence to the high-field unsaturated\nlinear magnetoresistance which is attributed to the quantum limit of the Dirac\nfermions.
