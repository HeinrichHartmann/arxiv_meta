An ohmic region (3 mV/$\\text{\\AA}$ $\\leq E_0\\leq$ 9\nmV/$\\text{\\AA}$) where the stationary velocity increases linearly with the\nelectric field strength is observed for the case of $U$=2.0 eV and $V$=1.0 eV.\nThe maximal velocity is well above the speed of sound. Below 3 mV/$\\text{\\AA}$\nthe polaron velocity increases nonlinearly and in high electric fields with\nstrength $E_0\\geq$ 10.0 mV/$\\text{\\AA}$ the polaron will become unstable and\ndissociate. The relationship between electron-electron interaction strengths\nand polaron transport is also studied in detail. We find that the the on-site\nCoulomb interactions $U$ will suppress the polaron transport and small\nnearest-neighbor interactions $V$ values are also not beneficial to the\npolaronic motion while large $V$ values favor the polaron transport.\n"]}]

Different sources of uncertainty have been\nconsidered, mainly related to the capacity and availability of generation\nfacilities and demand, and making use of adaptive robust optimization models.\nThe mathematical formulations for these models give rise to three-level\nmixed-integer optimization problems, which are solved using different\nstrategies.

The science products include maps of\nthe cosmic microwave background (CMB), the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect,\nand diffuse foregrounds in temperature and polarization, catalogues of compact\nGalactic and extragalactic sources (including separate catalogues of\nSunyaev-Zeldovich clusters and Galactic cold clumps), and extensive simulations\nof signals and noise used in assessing the performance of the analysis methods\nand assessment of uncertainties. The likelihood code used to assess\ncosmological models against the Planck data are described, as well as a CMB\nlensing likelihood. Scientific results include cosmological parameters deriving\nfrom CMB power spectra, gravitational lensing, and cluster counts, as well as\nconstraints on inflation, non-Gaussianity, primordial magnetic fields, dark\nenergy, and modified gravity.\n","Comment: 40 pages, 24 figures"]}]

The Galactic region is masked to reduce errors\narising from bandpass mismatch and high signal gradients. We apply horn-uniform\nradiometer weights to reduce effects of beam shape mismatch. The algorithm is\nthe same as used for the 2013 release, apart from small changes in parameter\nsettings. We validate the procedure through simulations. Special emphasis is\nput on the control of systematics, which is particularly important for accurate\npolarization analysis. We also produce low-resolution versions of the maps, and\ncorresponding noise covariance matrices. These serve as input in later analysis\nsteps and parameter estimation. The noise covariance matrices are validated\nthrough noise Monte Carlo simulations. The residual noise in the map products\nis characterized through analysis of half-ring maps, noise covariance matrices,\nand simulations.\n"]}]

Diffuse component separation: Foreground maps"],"description":["  Planck has mapped the microwave sky in nine frequency bands between 30 and\n857 GHz in temperature and seven bands between 30 and 353 GHz in polarization.\nIn this paper we consider the problem of diffuse astrophysical component\nseparation, and process these maps within a Bayesian framework to derive a\nconsistent set of full-sky astrophysical component maps. For the temperature\nanalysis, we combine the Planck observations with the 9-year WMAP sky maps and\nthe Haslam et al. 408 MHz map to derive a joint model of CMB, synchrotron,\nfree-free, spinning dust, CO, line emission in the 94 and 100 GHz channels, and\nthermal dust emission. Full-sky maps are provided with angular resolutions\nvarying between 7.5 arcmin and 1 deg. Global parameters (monopoles, dipoles,\nrelative calibration, and bandpass errors) are fitted jointly with the sky\nmodel, and best-fit values are tabulated. For polarization, the model includes\nCMB, synchrotron, and thermal dust emission. These models provide excellent\nfits to the observed data, with rms temperature residuals smaller than 4 uK\nover 93% of the sky for all Planck frequencies up to 353 GHz, and fractional\nerrors smaller than 1% in the remaining 7% of the sky. The main limitations of\nthe temperature model at the lower frequencies are degeneracies among the\nspinning dust, free-free, and synchrotron components; additional observations\nfrom external low-frequency experiments will be essential to break these. The\nmain limitations of the temperature model at the higher frequencies are\nuncertainties in the 545 and 857 GHz calibration and zero-points. For\npolarization, the main outstanding issues are instrumental systematics in the\n100-353 GHz bands on large angular scales in the form of\ntemperature-to-polarization leakage, uncertainties in the analog-to-digital\nconversion, and very long time constant corrections, all of which are expected\nto improve in the near future.\n","Comment: 65 pages, 51 figures, submitted to A&A; added power spectrum\n  discussion, added references, and minor corrections"]}]

When estimating the density of DE at early times, we significantly\nimprove present constraints. We then move to general parameterizations of the\nDE or MG perturbations that encompass both effective field theories and the\nphenomenology of gravitational potentials in MG models. Lastly, we test a range\nof specific models, such as k-essence, f(R) theories and coupled DE. In\naddition to the latest Planck data, for our main analyses we use baryonic\nacoustic oscillations, type-Ia supernovae and local measurements of the Hubble\nconstant. We further show the impact of measurements of the cosmological\nperturbations, such as redshift-space distortions and weak gravitational\nlensing. These additional probes are important tools for testing MG models and\nfor breaking degeneracies that are still present in the combination of Planck\nand background data sets. All results that include only background\nparameterizations are in agreement with LCDM. When testing models that also\nchange perturbations (even when the background is fixed to LCDM), some tensions\nappear in a few scenarios: the maximum one found is \\sim 2 sigma for Planck\nTT+lowP when parameterizing observables related to the gravitational potentials\nwith a chosen time dependence; the tension increases to at most 3 sigma when\nexternal data sets are included.

Constraints on primordial magnetic fields"],"description":["  We compute and investigate four types of imprint of a stochastic background\nof primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) on the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nanisotropies: the impact of PMFs on the CMB spectra; the effect on CMB\npolarization induced by Faraday rotation; the impact of PMFs on the ionization\nhistory; magnetically-induced non-Gaussianities; and the magnetically-induced\nbreaking of statistical isotropy. Overall, Planck data constrain the amplitude\nof PMFs to less than a few nanogauss. In particular, individual limits coming\nfrom the analysis of the CMB angular power spectra, using the Planck\nlikelihood, are $B_{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}< 4.4$ nG (where $B_{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}$ is\nthe comoving field amplitude at a scale of 1 Mpc) at 95% confidence level,\nassuming zero helicity, and $B_{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}< 5.6$ nG for a maximally\nhelical field.For nearly scale-invariant PMFs we obtain\n$B_{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}<2.0$ nG and $B_{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}<0.9$ nG if the impact of\nPMFs on the ionization history of the Universe is included. From the analysis\nof magnetically-induced non-Gaussianity we obtain three different values,\ncorresponding to three applied methods, all below 5 nG. The constraint from the\nmagnetically-induced passive-tensor bispectrum is $B_{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}< 2.8$\nnG. A search for preferred directions in the magnetically-induced passive\nbispectrum yields $B_{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}< 4.5$ nG, whereas the the\ncompensated-scalar bispectrum gives $B_{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}< 3$ nG. The analysis\nof the Faraday rotation of CMB polarization by PMFs uses the Planck power\nspectra in $EE$ and $BB$ at 70 GHz and gives $B_{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}< 1380$ nG. In\nour final analysis, we consider the harmonic-space correlations produced by\nAlfv\\'en waves, finding no significant evidence for the presence of these\nwaves.

The catalogue (PSZ2) is the\nlargest SZ-selected sample of galaxy clusters yet produced and the deepest\nall-sky catalogue of galaxy clusters. It contains 1653 detections, of which\n1203 are confirmed clusters with identified counterparts in external data-sets,\nand is the first SZ-selected cluster survey containing > $10^3$ confirmed\nclusters. We present a detailed analysis of the survey selection function in\nterms of its completeness and statistical reliability, placing a lower limit of\n83% on the purity. Using simulations, we find that the Y5R500 estimates are\nrobust to pressure-profile variation and beam systematics, but accurate\nconversion to Y500 requires. the use of prior information on the cluster\nextent. We describe the multi-wavelength search for counterparts in ancillary\ndata, which makes use of radio, microwave, infra-red, optical and X-ray\ndata-sets, and which places emphasis on the robustness of the counterpart\nmatch. We discuss the physical properties of the new sample and identify a\npopulation of low-redshift X-ray under- luminous clusters revealed by SZ\nselection. These objects appear in optical and SZ surveys with consistent\nproperties for their mass, but are almost absent from ROSAT X-ray selected\nsamples.\n","Comment: 41 pages. Submitted to A&A.

This catalogue\nis the full version of the Early Cold Core (ECC) catalogue, which was made\navailable in 2011 with the Early Release Compact Source Catalogue (ERCSC) and\ncontained 915 high S/N sources. It is based on the Planck 48 months mission\ndata that are currently being released to the astronomical community. The PGCC\ncatalogue is an observational catalogue consisting exclusively of Galactic cold\nsources. The three highest Planck bands (857, 545, 353 GHz) have been combined\nwith IRAS data at 3 THz to perform a multi-frequency detection of sources\ncolder than their local environment. After rejection of possible extragalactic\ncontaminants, the PGCC catalogue contains 13188 Galactic sources spread across\nthe whole sky, i.e., from the Galactic plane to high latitudes, following the\nspatial distribution of the main molecular cloud complexes. The median\ntemperature of PGCC sources lies between 13 and 14.5 K, depending on the\nquality of the flux density measurements, with a temperature ranging from 5.8\nto 20 K after removing sources with the 1% largest temperature estimates. Using\nseven independent methods, reliable distance estimates have been obtained for\n5574 sources, which allows us to derive their physical properties such as their\nmass, physical size, mean density and luminosity. The PGCC sources are located\nmainly in the solar neighbourhood, up to a distance of 10.5 kpc towards the\nGalactic centre, and range from low-mass cores to large molecular clouds.\nBecause of this diversity and because the PGCC catalogue contains sources in\nvery different environments, the catalogue is useful to investigate the\nevolution from molecular clouds to cores. Finally, the catalogue also includes\n54 additional sources located in the SMC and LMC.\n"]}]

In each\nround the strategic agents declare how much they value receiving any of the\ngoods in the specific round. The agent declaring the highest valuation receives\nthe good with the highest value, the agent with the second highest valuation\nreceives the second highest valued good, etc. Hence we assume a decision\nfunction that assigns goods to agents based on their valuations. The novelty of\nthe mechanism is that no payment scheme is required to achieve truthfulness in\na setting with rational/strategic agents. The FEDoR mechanism takes advantage\nof the repeated nature of the framework, and through a statistical test is able\nto punish the misreporting agents and be fair, truthful, and socially\nefficient. FEDoR is fair in the sense that, in expectation over the course of\nthe rounds, all agents will receive the same good the same amount of times.\nFEDoR is an eligible candidate for applications that require fair distribution\nof resources over time. For example, equal share of bandwidth for nodes through\nthe same point of access.

To date, most research on hierarchy in networks\nhas been limited to quantifying this property. However, an open, important\nquestion in evolutionary biology is why hierarchical organization evolves in\nthe first place. It has recently been shown that modularity evolves because of\nthe presence of a cost for network connections. Here we investigate whether\nsuch connection costs also tend to cause a hierarchical organization of such\nmodules. In computational simulations, we find that networks without a\nconnection cost do not evolve to be hierarchical, even when the task has a\nhierarchical structure. However, with a connection cost, networks evolve to be\nboth modular and hierarchical, and these networks exhibit higher overall\nperformance and evolvability (i.e. faster adaptation to new environments).\nAdditional analyses confirm that hierarchy independently improves adaptability\nafter controlling for modularity. Overall, our results suggest that the same\nforce--the cost of connections--promotes the evolution of both hierarchy and\nmodularity, and that these properties are important drivers of network\nperformance and adaptability.

Compact sources detected in the lower frequency channels are\nassigned to the PCCS2, while at higher frequencies they are assigned to one of\ntwo sub-catalogues, the PCCS2 or PCCS2E, depending on their location on the\nsky. The first of these catalogues covers most of the sky and allows the user\nto produce subsamples at higher reliabilities than the target 80% integral\nreliability of the catalogue. The PCCS2E contains sources detected in sky\nregions where the diffuse emission makes it difficult to quantify the\nreliability of the detections. Both the PCCS2 and PCCS2E include polarization\nmeasurements, in the form of polarized flux densities, or upper limits, and\norientation angles for all seven polarization-sensitive Planck channels.

The LFI temperature data are limited by instrumental\nnoise. At large angular scales the systematic effects are below the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) temperature power spectrum by several orders of\nmagnitude. In polarization the systematic uncertainties are dominated by\ncalibration uncertainties and compete with the CMB $E$-modes in the multipole\nrange 10--20. Based on our model of all known systematic effects, we show that\nthese effects introduce a slight bias of around $0.2\\,\\sigma$ on the\nreionization optical depth derived from the 70\\,GHz $EE$ spectrum using the 30\nand 353\\,GHz channels as foreground templates. At 30\\,GHz the systematic\neffects are smaller than the Galactic foreground at all scales in temperature\nand polarization, which allows us to consider this channel as a reliable\ntemplate of synchrotron emission. We assess the residual uncertainties due to\nLFI effects on CMB maps and power spectra after component separation and show\nthat these effects are smaller than the CMB amplitude at all scales. We also\nassess the impact on non-Gaussianity studies and find it to be negligible. Some\nresiduals still appear in null maps from particular sky survey pairs,\nparticularly at 30 GHz, suggesting possible straylight contamination due to an\nimperfect knowledge of the beam far sidelobes.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

In these\ngraphs, the vertices correspond to the small areas of the gray matter, and two\nvertices are connected by an edge, if a diffusion-MRI based workflow finds\nconnections between those areas. One main question of the field is discovering\nthe directions of the edges. In a previous work we have reported the\nconstruction of the Budapest Reference Connectome Server\nhttp://connectome.pitgroup.org from the data recorded in the Human Connectome\nProject of the NIH. After the server had been published, we recognized a\nsurprising and unforeseen property of it: The server can generate the\nbraingraph of connections that are present in at least $k$ graphs out of the\n418, for any value of $k=1,2,...,418$. When the value of $k$ is changed from\n$k=418$ through 1 by moving a slider at the webserver from right to left, more\nand more edges appear in the consensus graph. The astonishing observation is\nthat the appearance of the new edges is not random: it is similar to a growing\ntree. We hypothesize that this movement of the slider in the webserver may copy\nthe development of the connections in the human brain in the following sense:\nthe connections that are present in all subjects are the oldest ones, and those\nthat are present in a decreasing fraction of subjects are gradually the newer\nconnections in the individual brain development. An animation on the phenomenon\nis available at https://youtu.be/EnWwIf_HNjw. Based on this hypothesis, we can\nassign directions to the edges of the connectome as follows: Let $G_i$ denote\nthe consensus connectome where each edge is present in at least $i$ graphs.\nSuppose that vertex $v$ is isolated in $G_{k+1}$, and becomes connected to a\nvertex $u$ in $G_k$, where $u$ was connected to other vertices already in\n$G_{k+1}$. Then we direct this $(v,u)$ edge from $v$ to $u$.\n"]}]

Finally, notes\nare produced according to certain probabilistic rules, which may facilitate the\naccurate song recognition.

Disorder in donor positioning is taken into account, leading\nto an intricate disorder distribution of hoppings between nearest neighbor\ndonor sites (donor-donor tunnel coupling) -- an effect of valley interference.\nThe localization length is obtained for phosphorous (P) donor chains from a\ntransfer matrix approach and is further compared with the chain length. We\nquantitatively determine the impact of uncertainties $\\delta R$ in the\nimplantation position relative to a target and also compare our results with\nthose obtained without valley interference. We analyse systematically the aimed\ninter-donor separation dependence ($R_0$) and show that fairly diluted donor\nchains ($R_0=7.7$ nm) may be as long as 100 nm before the effective onset of\nAnderson localization, as long as the positioning error is under a lattice\nparameter ($\\delta R <0.543$ nm).\n","Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures"]}]

By contrast, relatively little work exists on\nthe identification, let alone classification, of QSL phases for spin-1 systems\nin dimensions higher than one. Employing the powerful ideas of tensor network\ntheory and its classification, we develop general methods for writing QSL wave\nfunctions of spin-1 respecting all the lattice symmetries, spin rotation, and\ntime reversal with trivial gauge structure on the square lattice. We find $2^5$\ndistinct classes characterized by five binary quantum numbers. Several explicit\nconstructions of such wave functions are given for bond dimensions $D$ ranging\nfrom two to four, along with thorough numerical analyses to identify their\nphysical characters. Both gapless and gapped states are found. The topological\nentanglement entropy of the gapped states are close to zero, indicative of\ntopologically trivial states. In $D=4$, several different tensors can be\nlinearly combined to produce a family of states within the same symmetry class.\nA rich \"phase diagram\" can be worked out among the phases of these tensors, as\nwell as the phase transitions among them. Among the states we identified in\nthis putative phase diagram is the plaquette-ordered phase, gapped resonating\nvalence bond phase, and a critical phase. A continuous transition separates the\nplaquette-ordered phase from the resonating valence bond phase.\n"]}]

The\nstrong-coupling expansion is extended beyond the adiabatic approximation, by\nincluding into the treatment non-adiabatic transitions between excited polaron\nstates.

We extract these stars from extinction-corrected color-magnitude\ndiagrams in the near-infrared of VISTA-VVV data in some bulge regions and\ncalculate the densities along the line of sight. We take the uncertaintity in\nthe photometric parallax and the contamination of other sources into account,\nand we see that these errors do not avoid the detection of a possible double\npeak along some lines of sight as expected for a X-shape bulge if it existed.\n  RESULTS. Only a single peak in the density distribution along the line of\nsight is observed, so apparently there is no X-shape structure for this\npopulation of stars.

Stellar populations are the building blocks of galaxies including\nthe Milky Way. The majority, if not all extragalactic studies are entangled\nwith the use of stellar population models given the unresolved nature of their\nobservation.

This is done by comparing SSP models against\nobservations of spatially resolved young stellar population in the\ndetermination of its physical properties, i.e. age and metallicity. METHODS.\nIntegral field spectroscopy of a young stellar cluster in the Milky Way, NGC\n3603, is used to study the properties of the cluster both as a resolved and\nunresolved stellar population. The unresolved stellar population is analysed\nusing the H$\\alpha$ equivalent width as an age indicator, and the ratio of\nstrong emission lines to infer metallicity. In addition, spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) fitting using STARLIGHT, is used to infer these properties\nfrom the integrated spectrum. Independently, the resolved stellar population is\nanalysed using the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) for age and metallicity\ndetermination. As the SSP model represents the unresolved stellar population,\nthe derived age and metallicity are put to test whether they agree with those\nderived from resolved stars. RESULTS. The age and metallicity estimate of NGC\n3603 derived from integrated spectroscopy are confirmed to be within the range\nof those derived from the CMD of the resolved stellar population, including\nother estimates found in the literature.

Since the amount of\n13C in the ISM has increased with time due to mass-loss from evolved stars, the\n12C/13C ratios in M dwarfs, reflecting those of the past ISM, should be larger\nthan those of the present ISM.

This result\nshows a marked contrast to log 16O/12C (= log Ao/Ac) plotted against log Ac,\nwhich shows a rather tight correlation with the larger value at the lower\nmetallicity.

It also applies in a wide variety of other planetary circumstances.\nWe first present a number of analytical results developing some key features of\nnon-dilute atmospheres, and then show how some of these features are manifest\nin simulations with a general circulation model adapted to handle non-dilute\natmospheres. We find that non-dilute atmospheres have weak horizontal\ntemperature gradients even for rapidly rotating planets, and that their\ncirculations are largely barotropic. The relative humidity of the condensible\ncomponent tends towards 100% as the atmosphere becomes more non-dilute, which\nhas important implications for runaway greenhouse thresholds. Non-dilute\natmospheres exhibit a number of interesting organized convection features, for\nwhich there is not yet any adequate theoretical understanding.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Proc.

The majority of bright extragalactic gamma-ray sources are blazars.\nOnly a few radio galaxies have been detected by Fermi/LAT. Recently, the\nGHz-peaked spectrum source PKS 1718-649 was confirmed to be gamma-ray bright,\nproviding further evidence for the existence of a population of gamma-ray loud,\ncompact radio galaxies. A spectral turnover in the radio spectrum in the MHz to\nGHz range is a characteristic feature of these objects, which are thought to be\nyoung due to their small linear sizes. The multiwavelength properties of the\ngamma-ray source PMN J1603-4904 suggest that it is a member of this source\nclass. Aims. The known radio spectrum of PMN J1603-4904 can be described by a\npower law above 1 GHz. Using observations from the Giant Metrewave Radio\nTelescope (GMRT) at 150, 325, and 610 MHz, we investigate the behaviour of the\nspectrum at lower frequencies to search for a low-frequency turnover. Methods.\nData from the TIFR GMRT Sky Survey (TGSS ADR) catalogue and archival GMRT\nobservations were used to construct the first MHz to GHz spectrum of PMN\nJ1603-4904. Results. We detect a low-frequency turnover of the spectrum and\nmeasure the peak position at about 490 MHz (rest-frame), which, using the known\nrelation of peak frequency and linear size, translates into a maximum linear\nsource size of ~1.4 kpc. Conclusions. The detection of the MHz peak indicates\nthat PMN J1603-4904 is part of this population of radio galaxies with turnover\nfrequencies in the MHz to GHz regime. Therefore it can be considered the\nsecond, confirmed object of this kind detected in gamma-rays.

Modeling the reflection spectrum\nsuggests that the inner accretion disk was located at R_in>100 GM/c2 (>225 km)\nfrom the neutron star. The apparent truncation may be due to evaporation of the\ninner disk into a radiatively-inefficient accretion flow, or due to the\npressure of the neutron star magnetic field. Our Chandra gratings data reveal\npossible narrow emission lines near 1 keV that can be modeled as reflection or\ncollisionally-ionized gas, and possible low-energy absorption features that\ncould point to the presence of an outflow. We consider a scenario in which this\nneutron star has been able to sustain its low accretion rate through magnetic\ninhibition of the accretion flow, which gives some constraints on its magnetic\nfield strength and spin period.

(ii) There are\nnegative correlations between $\\nu_{\\text{sy}}$ and $r$, the $\\nu_{\\text{IC}}$\nand $r$, which is a signature of the energy-dependence statistical acceleration\nor the stochastic acceleration. There is a significant correlation between $r$\nand $s$, which suggests that the curvature of the electron energy distribution\nis attributed to the energy-dependence statistical acceleration mechanism.\n(iii) By assuming one proton per relativistic electron, we estimate the jet\npower and radiative power. A size relation $P_{\\text{e}} \\sim P_{\\text{p}} >\nP_{\\text{r}} \\gtrsim P_{\\text{B}}$ is found in our sample. The\n$P_{\\text{e}}>P_{\\text{B}}$ suggests that the jets are particle dominated, and\nthe $P_{\\text{e}}\\sim P_{\\text{p}}$ means that the mean energy of relativistic\nelectrons approaches $m_{\\text{p}}/m_{\\text{e}}$. There are not significant\ncorrelations between $P_{\\text{jet}}$ and black hole mass in high or low state\nwith a sub-sample of 18 sources, which suggests that the jet power weakly\ndepends on the black hole mass.

While many\nCepheids have been intensively observed by infrared beam combiners, only a few\nhave been observed in the visible. This paper is part of a project to observe\nCepheids in the visible with interferometry as a counterpart to infrared\nobservations already in hand. Observations of delta Cep itself were secured\nwith the VEGA/CHARA instrument over the full pulsation cycle of the star. These\nvisible interferometric data are consistent in first approximation with a\nquasi-hydrostatic model of pulsation surrounded by a static circumstellar\nenvironment (CSE) with a size of theta_cse=8.9 +/- 3.0 mas and a relative flux\ncontribution of f_cse=0.07+/-0.01.

Bell's argument is largely negated if this\nyardstick is instead based on the alternative $p$-adic metric. Such a metric,\ncommon in number theory, arises naturally when describing chaotic systems which\nevolve precisely on self-similar invariant sets in their state space. A\nlocally-causal realistic model of quantum entanglement is developed, based on\nthe premise that the laws of physics ultimately derive from an invariant-set\ngeometry in the state space of a deterministic quasi-cyclic mono-universe.\nBased on this, the notion of a complex Hilbert vector is reinterpreted in terms\nof an uncertain selection from a finite sample space of states, leading to a\nnovel form of `consistent histories' based on number-theoretic properties of\nthe transcendental cosine function.

In various fields -- e.g. quantum\ninformation theory -- one frequently encounters constructions that rely on\nmatrices drawn uniformly at random from the unitary group. Often, it suffices\nto sample these matrices from a unitary t-design, for sufficiently high t. This\nresults in more explicit, derandomized constructions. The most prominent\nunitary t-design considered in quantum information is the multi-qubit Clifford\ngroup. It is known to be a unitary 3-design, but, unfortunately, not a\n4-design. Here, we give a simple, explicit characterization of the way in which\nthe Clifford group fails to constitute a 4-design. Our results show that for\nvarious applications in quantum information theory and in the theory of convex\nsignal recovery, Clifford orbits perform almost as well as those of true\n4-designs. Technically, it turns out that in a precise sense, the 4th tensor\npower of the Clifford group affords only one more invariant subspace than the\n4th tensor power of the unitary group. That additional subspace is a stabilizer\ncode -- a structure extensively studied in the field of quantum error\ncorrection codes.

Methods: AVO and AVC\nwere detected for each heartbeat with accelerometers on the upper arm (A),\nwrist (W), and knee (K) of 22 consenting adults following isometric exercise.\nExercise-induced changes were recorded with impedance cardiography, and\nnine-beat ensemble averaging was applied.

Results: In agreement with recent studies, we\ndid not find peaks at AVO and AVC in distal vibrations, and the conventional\nR-J interval method from the literature also correlated poorly with AVO (r2 =\n0.22 A, 0.14 W, 0.12 K).

Relevant issues to address in this context include the sheer volume\nof data that may consist of categorical samples, the typically streaming format\nof acquisition, and the possibly missing entries. To cope with these\nchallenges, the present paper develops a novel categorical subspace learning\napproach to unravel the latent structure for three prominent categorical\n(bilinear) models, namely, Probit, Tobit, and Logit. The deterministic Probit\nand Tobit models treat data as quantized values of an analog-valued process\nlying in a low-dimensional subspace, while the probabilistic Logit model relies\non low dimensionality of the data log-likelihood ratios. Leveraging the low\nintrinsic dimensionality of the sought models, a rank regularized\nmaximum-likelihood estimator is devised, which is then solved recursively via\nalternating majorization-minimization to sketch high-dimensional categorical\ndata `on the fly.' The resultant procedure alternates between sketching the new\nincomplete datum and refining the latent subspace, leading to lightweight\nfirst-order algorithms with highly parallelizable tasks per iteration. As an\nextra degree of freedom, the quantization thresholds are also learned jointly\nalong with the subspace to enhance the predictive power of the sought models.\nPerformance of the subspace iterates is analyzed for both infinite and finite\ndata streams, where for the former asymptotic convergence to the stationary\npoint set of the batch estimator is established, while for the latter sublinear\nregret bounds are derived for the empirical cost.

In our lumped, Ordinary Differential Equation\n(ODE) examples this infinity crossing can happen instantaneously; at the\nspatially distributed, Partial Differential Equation (PDE) level the crossing\nof infinity may even persist for finite time, necessitating the introduction of\nconceptual (and computational) buffer zones in which an appropriate singular\ntransformation is continuously (locally) detected and performed. These\nobservations (and associated tools) could set the stage for a systematic\napproach to bypassing infinity (and thus going beyond it) in a broader range of\nevolution equations; they also hold the promise of meaningfully and seamlessly\nperforming the relevant computations.

RNA tetraloops\nare fundamental RNA motifs playing key roles in RNA folding and RNA-RNA and\nRNA-protein interactions. Although state-of-the-art Molecular Dynamics (MD)\nforce fields correctly describe the native state of these tetraloops as a\nstable free-energy basin on the microsecond time scale, enhanced sampling\ntechniques reveal that the native state is not the global free energy minimum,\nsuggesting yet unidentified significant imbalances in the force fields. Here,\nwe tested our ability to fold the RNA tetraloops in various force fields and\nsimulation settings. We employed three different enhanced sampling techniques,\nnamely, temperature replica exchange MD (T-REMD), replica exchange with solute\ntempering (REST2), and well-tempered metadynamics (WT-MetaD). We aimed to\nseparate problems caused by limited sampling from those due to force-field\ninaccuracies. We found that none of the contemporary force fields is able to\ncorrectly describe folding of the 5'-GAGA-3' tetraloop over a range of\nsimulation conditions. We thus aimed to identify which terms of the force field\nare responsible for this poor description of TL folding. We showed that at\nleast two different imbalances contribute to this behavior, namely,\noverstabilization of base-phosphate and/or sugar-phosphate interactions and\nunderestimated stability of the hydrogen bonding interaction in base pairing.\nThe first artifact stabilizes the unfolded ensemble, while the second one\ndestabilizes the folded state.

We give an answer based on a two-dimensional\nrepresentation of diseases. These two dimensions are defined as follows. In\nmortality curves there is an age, namely a_c = 10 years, which plays a crucial\nrole in the sense that the mortality rate decreases in the interval I1=(a<a_c)\nand increases in the interval I2=(a>a_c). The respective trends in I1 and I2\nare the two parameters used in our classification of diseases. Within the\nframework of reliability analysis, I1 and I2 would be referred to as the\n\"burn-in\" and \"wear-out\" phases. This leads to define three broad groups of\ndiseases. (AS1) Asymmetry with prevalence of I1. (AS2) Asymmetry with\nprevalence of I2. (S) Symmetry, with I1 and I2 both playing roles of comparable\nimportance. Not surprisingly, among AS1-cases one finds all diseases due to\ncongenital malformations. In the AS2-class one finds degenerative diseases,\ne.g. Alzheimer's disease. Among S-cases one finds most diseases due to external\npathogens or to wear-out processes. Cancer is one of those mixed cases and it\nis closer to (AS2) than to (AS1). This representation also explains what we\ncall an OVERKILL EFFECT in old age. It tells us that even an effective cancer\ntherapy would have no influence whatsoever on the extent of human life unless\nALL other diseases are cured simultaneously. We conclude that whilst one might\ndevelop a cure for many of the known diseases of old age, new diseases will\narise and the quest for the ultimate cure will be never ending. Death before\nthe age of 120 seems firmly written in our genetic code and the best we shall\nbe able to do is to help people cope with the inevitability of death as and\nwhen it arises.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 8 figures"]}]

From the results in these areas of observational\nastrophysics, and the recently confirmed dependence of BH formation on\nmetallicity and redshift, it is concluded that a large fraction of massive\nstellar binaries in the universe end as BBHs, and that BHs of ~10 solar masses\nand even lower masses may be formed by implosion.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 10 figures, Invited Review submitted to New Astronomy\n  Reviews"]}]

Au$_{20}$ undergoes a clear and distinct solid like to liquid like\ntransition with a sharp peak in the heat capacity curve around 770 K. On the\nother hand, Au$_{19}$ has a broad and flat heat capacity curve with continuous\nmelting transition. This continuous melting transition turns out to be a\nconsequence of a process involving series of atomic rearrangements along the\nsurface to fill in the missing corner atom. This results in a restricted\ndiffusive motion of atoms along the surface of Au$_{19}$ between 650 K to 900 K\nduring which the shape of the ground state geometry is retained. In contrast,\nthe tetrahedral structure of Au$_{20}$ is destroyed around 800 K, and the\ncluster is clearly in a liquid like state above 1000 K.

The combination of density functional\nelectronic structure techniques and a dielectric continuum model for\nelectrostatic solvation applied to the Fe(H$_2$O)$_6$$^{3+}$ complex yields\n-1020~kcal/mol (experimental values -1037~kcal/mol to -1019~kcal/mol) for the\nabsolute free energy of the aqueous ferric ion. The predicted reaction energy\nchange for the first hydrolysis is 2 kcal/mol (compared to 3 kcal/mol\nexperimental). For the second hydrolysis, we found an unexpected low energy\nisomer of Fe(H$_2$O)$_4$(OH)$_2$$^{+}$ with five ligands in the inner sphere\nand one water outside. The cis and trans isomers are, respectively, slightly\nlower and higher in energy. Extrusion of the additional water to the outer\nsphere is nearly thermoneutral. The reaction free energy for the second\nhydrolysis is predicted in the range 16-18~kcal/mol, higher than the\nexperimental value of 5~kcal/mol. Since the theoretical predictions for the\nsecond hydrolysis are higher than experimental values and novel structures were\nencountered, we argue that conformational entropy is important in these\nreactions.\n","Comment: 28 pages plus four figures"]}]

The hydration of imidazole and imidazolium\nsolutes is used to exemplify the theoretical issues. The treatment of\nlong-ranged electrostatic interactions in simulations is discussed extensively.\nIt is argued that the Ewald approach is an easy way to get correct hydration\nfree energies in the thermodynamic limit from molecular calculations; and that\nmolecular simulations with Ewald interactions and periodic boundary conditions\ncan also be more efficient than many common alternatives. The Ewald treatment\npermits a conclusive extrapolation to infinite system size. The picture that\nemerges from testing of simple models is that the most prominent failings of\nthe simplest theories are associated with solvent proton conformations that\nlead to non-gaussian fluctuations of electrostatic potentials. Thus, the most\nfavorable cases for the second-order perturbation theories are monoatomic\npositive ions. For polar and anionic solutes, continuum or gaussian theories\nare less accurate. The appreciation of the specific deficiencies of those\nsimple models have led to new concepts, multistate gaussian and quasi-chemical\ntheories, that address the cases for which the simpler theories fail. It is\nargued that, relative to direct dielectric continuum treatments, the\nquasi-chemical theories provide a better theoretical organization for the\ncomputational study of the electronic structure of solution species.\n","Comment: invited J.
