The question then arises as to whether the lengths of other\nbulk curves can be interpreted as entanglement costs for some other information\ntheoretic tasks.

In order to complete the proof, we\nadditionally demonstrate that single-shot smooth conditional entropies for\nintervals in 1+1-dimensional conformal field theories with large central charge\nare well approximated by their von Neumann counterparts. We also revisit the\nrelationship between the differential entropy and the maximum entropy among\nlocally consistent density operators, demonstrating large quantitative\ndiscrepancy between the two quantities in conformal field theories.\n","Comment: 40 pages, 7 figures"]}]

Within this approach, the multiplicity energy dependence\nand the pseudorapidity spectra from the most central nuclear collisions are\nwell reproduced. The study of the multiplicity centrality dependence reveals a\nnew scaling between the measured pseudorapidity spectra and the calculations.\nBy means of this scaling, called the energy balanced limiting fragmentation\nscaling, one reproduces the pseudorapidity spectra for all centralities. The\nscaling elucidates some differences in the multiplicity and midrapidity density\ncentrality dependence obtained at RHIC and LHC. These findings reveal an\ninherent similarity in the multiplicity energy dependence from the most central\ncollisions and centrality data. A new regime in heavy-ion collisions to occur\nat about a TeV energy is indicated, similar to that observed in the earlier\nstudies of the midrapidity densities.

In spite of its large cross section, the\nCEvNS process has never been observed, due to tiny energies of the resulting\nnuclear recoils which are out of reach for standard neutrino detectors. The\nmeasurement of CEvNS has now become feasible, thanks to the development of\nultra-sensitive technology for rare decay and weakly-interacting massive\nparticle (dark matter) searches. The CEvNS cross section is cleanly predicted\nin the standard model; hence its measurement provides a standard model test. It\nis relevant for supernova physics and supernova-neutrino detection, and enables\nvalidation of dark-matter detector background and detector-response models. In\nthe long term, precision measurement of CEvNS will address questions of nuclear\nstructure. COHERENT will deploy multiple detector technologies in a phased\napproach: a 14-kg CsI[Na] scintillating crystal, 15 kg of p-type point-contact\ngermanium detectors, and 100 kg of liquid xenon in a two-phase time projection\nchamber. Following an extensive background measurement campaign, a location in\nthe SNS basement has proven to be neutron-quiet and suitable for deployment of\nthe COHERENT detector suite. The simultaneous deployment of the three COHERENT\ndetector subsystems will test the $N^2$ dependence of the cross section and\nensure an unambiguous discovery of CEvNS. This document describes concisely the\nCOHERENT physics motivations, sensitivity and plans for measurements at the SNS\nto be accomplished on a four-year timescale.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 12 figures: corrections to author list"]}]

Recently, it has been pointed out that the presence of the\nvan Hove singularities (vHs) around the Fermi level is crucial. However, while\nthere have been quantitative estimates of Tc based on the Migdal-Eliashberg\ntheory, the energy dependence of the density of states (DOS) has been neglected\nto simplify the Eliashberg equation. In this study, we go beyond the constant\nDOS approximation and explicitly consider the electronic structure over 40eV\naround the Fermi level. In contrast with the previous conventional\ncalculations, this approach with a sufficiently large number of Matsubara\nfrequencies enables us to calculate Tc without introducing the empirical pseudo\nCoulomb potential. We show that while H3S has much higher Tc than H2S for which\nthe vHs is absent, the constant DOS approximation employed so far seriously\noverestimates (underestimates) Tc by ~ 60K (~ 10K) for H3S (H2S). We then\ndiscuss the impact of the strong electron-phonon coupling on the electronic\nstructure with and without the vHs and how it affects the superconductivity.\nEspecially, we focus on (1) the feedback effect in the self-consistent\ncalculation of the self-energy, (2) the effect of the energy shift due to the\nzero-point motion, and (3) the effect of the changes in the phonon frequencies\ndue to strong anharmonicity. We show that the effect of (1)-(3) on Tc is about\n10-30K for both H3S and H2S. Eventually, Tc is estimated to be 181K for H3S at\n250GPa and 34K for H2S at 140GPa, which explains the pressure dependence of Tc\nobserved in the experiment.

However, directional detection experiments are sensitive to\nthe direction of the nuclear recoil as well. Due to the Sun's motion with\nrespect to the Galactic rest frame, the directional recoil rate has a dipole\nfeature, peaking around the direction of the Solar motion. This provides a\npowerful tool for demonstrating the Galactic origin of nuclear recoils and\nhence unambiguously detecting Dark Matter. Furthermore, the directional recoil\ndistribution depends on the WIMP mass, scattering cross section and local\nvelocity distribution. Therefore, with a large number of recoil events it will\nbe possible to study the physics of Dark Matter in terms of particle and\nastrophysical properties.

For\nlarge dynamic networks, computing and maintaining a set of spanning trees is\nnot efficient, as the network-topology may change frequently. In this paper we\ndesign a class of dynamic algorithms which makes packet-by-packet schedul- ing\nand routing decisions and thus obviates the need for maintaining any global\ntopological structures, such as span- ning trees. Our algorithms may be\nconveniently understood as a non-trivial generalization of the familiar\nback-pressure algorithm which makes unicast packet routing and schedul- ing\ndecisions, based on queue-length information, without maintaining end-to-end\npaths. However, in the broadcast problem, it is hard to define queuing\nstructures due to ab- sence of a work-conservation principle which results from\npacket duplications. We design and prove the optimality of a virtual-queue\nbased algorithm, where a virtual-queue is de- fined for subsets of vertices. We\nthen propose a multi-class broadcast policy which combines the above scheduling\nalgo- rithm with a class-based in-order packet delivery constraint, resulting\nin significant reduction in complexity.

Therefore these algorithms and\nthe probabilistic selection of the threshold criteria is reviewed and\ndiscussed. A recently offered change detection method which depends on the idea\nof generating two different final change maps of two images in a sequence, is\nused. First final change map is obtained by cumulatively adding the sequences\nof change maps in such a manner that common change areas are excluded and\nuncommon change areas are included.

Therefore, bicycle-sharing systems are normally used as a\nshort-distance trip supplement for private vehicles as well as regular public\ntransportation.

If we have more than one water\ndrop in a single image, then through each of them we can see the environment\nwith different view points, similar to stereo. To realize this idea, we need to\nrectify every water drop imagery to make radially distorted planar surfaces\nlook flat. For this rectification, we consider two physical properties of water\ndrops: (1) A static water drop has constant volume, and its geometric convex\nshape is determined by the balance between the tension force and gravity. This\nimplies that the 3D geometric shape can be obtained by minimizing the overall\npotential energy, which is the sum of the tension energy and the gravitational\npotential energy. (2) The imagery inside a water-drop is determined by the\nwater-drop 3D shape and total reflection at the boundary. This total reflection\ngenerates a dark band commonly observed in any adherent water drops. Hence,\nonce the 3D shape of water drops are recovered, we can rectify the water drop\nimages through backward raytracing. Subsequently, we can compute depth using\nstereo. In addition to depth estimation, we can also apply image refocusing.\nExperiments on real images and a quantitative evaluation show the effectiveness\nof our proposed method.

Inadequate treatment of such noise leads to a biased estimation of\nregression slopes, resulting in a wrong representation of the real amplitude of\npast climate variations.

For large\nspeeds (underdamped), where inertia dominates, the clusters show more complex\nbehaviors crossing the interface multiple times and deviating from the\npredictable refraction and reflection for the low velocity clusters. We then\npresent an extreme limit of the model in the absense of rotational damping\nwhere clusters can become stuck spiraling along the interface or move in large\ncircular trajectories after leaving the interface. Our results show a wide\nrange of behaviors that occur when collectively moving active biological matter\nmoves across interfaces and these insights can be used to control motion by\npatterning environments.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 7 figures"]}]

The goal of lead-free bullets is\nto gain the advantages of reduced lead use in the environment while maintaining\nequal or better terminal performance. Accepting reduced terminal performance\nwould foolishly risk the lives of military and law enforcement personnel. This\npaper uses the established technique of studying bullet impacts in ballistic\ngelatin to characterize the terminal performance of eight commercial off-the-\nshelf lead-free handgun bullets for comparison with earlier analysis of\njacketed lead bullets. Peak retarding force and energy deposit in calibrated\nballistic gelatin are quantified using high speed video. The temporary stretch\ncavities and permanent wound cavities are also characterized. Two factors tend\nto reduce the terminal performance of these lead-free projectiles compared to\nsimilar jacketed lead designs. First, solid copper construction increase barrel\nfriction, which reduces muzzle velocity and energy, and thus reduces the\nability of the bullet to exert damaging forces in tissue simulant. Second, the\nlower density of copper requires a longer bullet for a given mass and caliber,\nwhich reduces remaining powder volume in the brass cartridge case, which also\ntends to reduce muzzle velocity and energy. The results of the present study\nare consistent with earlier analysis showing that expansion is necessary to\nmaximize the potential for rapid incapacitation of enemy combatants. In spite\nof some new non-expanding nose designs that moderately increase forces between\nbullet and tissue, the largest retarding forces and highest incapacitation\npotential requires expanding bullets which maximize frontal area.\n","Comment: 14 pages"]}]
