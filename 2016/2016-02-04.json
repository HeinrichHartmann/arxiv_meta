While most eQTL\nstudies to date consider the connection between genetic variation and\nexpression in a single tissue, complex, multi-tissue data sets are now being\ngenerated by the GTEx initiative. These data sets have the potential to improve\nthe findings of single tissue analyses by borrowing strength across tissues,\nand the potential to elucidate the genotypic basis of differences between\ntissues.\n  In this paper we introduce and study a multivariate hierarchical Bayesian\nmodel (MT-eQTL) for multi-tissue eQTL analysis. MT-eQTL directly models the\nvector of correlations between expression and genotype across tissues. It\nexplicitly captures patterns of variation in the presence or absence of eQTLs,\nas well as the heterogeneity of effect sizes across tissues. Moreover, the\nmodel is applicable to complex designs in which the set of donors can (i) vary\nfrom tissue to tissue, and (ii) exhibit incomplete overlap between tissues. The\nMT-eQTL model is marginally consistent, in the sense that the model for a\nsubset of tissues can be obtained from the full model via marginalization.\nFitting of the MT-eQTL model is carried out via empirical Bayes, using an\napproximate EM algorithm. Inferences concerning eQTL detection and the\nconfiguration of eQTLs across tissues are derived from adaptive thresholding of\nlocal false discovery rates, and maximum a-posteriori estimation, respectively.\nWe investigate the MT-eQTL model through a simulation study, and rigorously\nestablish the FDR control of the local FDR testing procedure under mild\nassumptions appropriate for dependent data.\n"]}]

Voyager 2 data are an incomplete time series with a\nvoids/signal ratio that typically increases as the spacecraft moves away from\nthe sun (45% missing data in 1979), making the analysis challenging.

The\npresent paper is not about the principles of laser construction, still less a\nhistory of how the laser was invented. Rather, it addresses the question: what\nare the fundamental features that distinguish laser light from thermal light?\nThe obvious answer, \"laser light is coherent\", is, I argue, so vague that it\nmust be put aside at the start, albeit to revisit later. A more specific,\nquantum theoretic, version, \"laser light is in a coherent state\", is simply\nwrong in this context: both laser light and thermal light can equally well be\ndescribed by coherent states, with amplitudes that vary stochastically in\nspace. Instead, my answer to the titular question is that four principles are\nneeded: high directionality, monochromaticity, high brightness, and stable\nintensity. Combining the first three of these principles suffices to show, in a\nquantitative way --- involving, indeed, very large dimensionless quantities (up\nto $\\sim10^{51}$) --- that a laser must be constructed very differently from a\nlight bulb. This quantitative analysis is quite simple, and is easily relatable\nto \"coherence\", yet is not to be found in any text-books on quantum optics to\nmy knowledge. The fourth principle is the most subtle and, perhaps\nsurprisingly, is the only one related to coherent states in the quantum optics\nsense: it implies that the description in terms of coherent states is the only\nsimple description of a laser beam. Interestingly, this leads to the (not, as\nit turns out, entirely new) prediction that narrowly filtered laser beams are\nindistinguishable from similarly filtered thermal beams.

As hydrodynamical simulations strongly depend on\ndetails in the feedback implementations, no unique and robust predictions for\nbaryonic effects currently exist. In this paper we propose a baryonic\ncorrection model that modifies the density field of dark-matter-only $N$-body\nsimulations to mimic the effects of baryons from any underlying adopted\nfeedback recipe. The model assumes haloes to consist of 4 components: 1- hot\ngas in hydrostatical equilibrium, 2- ejected gas from feedback processes, 3-\ncentral galaxy stars, and 4- adiabatically relaxed dark matter, which all\nmodify the initial dark-matter-only density profiles. These altered profiles\nallow to define a displacement field for particles in $N$-body simulations and\nto modify the total density field accordingly. The main advantage of the\nbaryonic correction model is to connect the total matter density field to the\nobservable distribution of gas and stars in haloes, making it possible to\nparametrise baryonic effects on the matter power spectrum. We show that the\nmost crucial quantities are the mass fraction of ejected gas and its\ncorresponding ejection radius. The former controls how strongly baryons\nsuppress the power spectrum, while the latter provides a measure of the scale\nwhere baryonic effects become important. A comparison with X-ray and\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich cluster observations suggests that baryons suppress wave\nmodes above $k\\sim0.5$ h/Mpc with a maximum suppression of 10-25 percent around\n$k\\sim 2$ h/Mpc.

These problems have severely limited use of\naluminum-rich nitride films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. A way around these\nproblems is through use of a liquid-metal-enabled approach to molecular beam\nepitaxy.

The protection of Intact Forest Landscapes (IFL) that are\nnot accessible by roads is high on the biodiversity conservation agenda, a\nchallenge for logging concessions certified by the Forest Stewardship Council\n(FSC). A frequently advocated conservation objective is to maximise the\nretention of \"roadless space\", a concept that is based on distance to the\nnearest road from any point. We developed a novel use of the empty space\nfunction - a general statistical tool based on stochastic geometry and random\nsets theory - to calculate roadless space in a part of the Congo Basin where\nthere has recently been rapid expansion of road networks. We compared the\ntemporal development of roadless space in certified and non-certified logging\nconcessions inside and outside areas declared as IFL in the year 2000. Between\n1999 and 2007, rapid road network expansion led to a marked loss of roadless\nspace in IFL. After 2007, this trajectory levelled out in most areas, due to an\nequilibrium between newly built roads and abandoned roads that became\nrevegetated. However, concessions within IFL that have been certified by FSC\nsince around 2007 showed continued decreases in roadless space, thus reaching a\nlevel comparable to all other concessions. Only national parks remained\nroad-free. We recommend that forest management policies make the preservation\nof large connected forest areas a top priority by effectively monitoring - and\nlimiting - the occupation of space by roads that are permanently accessible.\n"]}]

The goal of this paper is to extend\nthe proposed subjective universe model, i.e., the universe as a quantum\nmeasurement: Motivated by the relationship between quantum theory and classical\nprobability theory with continuity, it is argued that the frame of reference of\nthe observer may be identified with classical probability theory where its\nchoice, along with big bang singularity, should correspond to the quantum\nobservable. That is, the physical version of singularity resolution corresponds\nto the case, where big bang singularity is equivalent to the continuity of the\nnegative sea, or aether, filling the universe as a frame of reference of the\nobserver. Moreover, based on the holographic principle, we identify the choice\nof the observer with the degrees of freedom proportional to the Planck area on\nthe horizon.
