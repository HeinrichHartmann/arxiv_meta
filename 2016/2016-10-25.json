If the density\nconcentration is sufficiently large, no shell-crossing singularity appears and\na black hole is formed. If the density concentration is not sufficiently large,\na shell-crossing singularity appears. In this case, a large dipole moment\nsignificantly advances shell-crossing singularities and they tend to appear\nbefore the black hole formation. In contrast, a shell-crossing singularity\nunavoidably appears in the spherical and nonspherical evolution of cosmological\nvoids. The present analysis is general and applicable to cosmological nonlinear\nstructure formation described by these dust solutions.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in Progress of\n  Theoretical and Experimental Physics"]}]

We\nformulate a game between two primaries where each primary decides whether to\nacquire C-CSI or not and then selects its price based on that. We first\ncharacterize the Nash Equilibrium (NE) of this game for a symmetric model where\nthe C-CSI is perfect. We show that the payoff of a primary is independent of\nthe C-CSI acquisition cost. We then generalize our analysis to allow for\nimperfect estimation and cases where the two primaries have different C-CSI\ncosts or different channel availabilities. Our results show interestingly that\nthe payoff of a primary increases when there is estimation error. We also show\nthat surprisingly, the expected payoff of a primary may decrease when the C-CSI\nacquisition cost decreases when primaries have different availabilities.\n","Comment: Shorter version will be presented in ISIT'16.

We\nprovide examples of stationary wave functions for which there is chaos, as\ndemonstrated by numerical computations, for one particle moving in 3 spatial\ndimensions and for two and three entangled particles in two dimensions. Our\nconclusion is that the motion of the nodes is not necessary for the generation\nof chaos.

Since it is very hard to evaluate the\naverage Lyapunov exponent analytically, which is often computed numerically, it\nis useful to have simple quantities that agree well with the average Lyapunov\nexponent.

In this work I show how to characterise these local tree-like\nstructures by measuring the local writhing of the rings' segments and by\nidentifying the patterns of intra-chain contacts. These quantities reveal two\nmajor topological structures: loops and terminal branches which strongly\nsuggest that the strictly double-folded \"lattice animal\" picture for rings in\nthe melt may be replaced by a more relaxed tree-like structure accommodating\nloops. In particular, I show that one can identify hierarchically looped\nstructures whose degree increases linearly with the size of a ring, and that\nterminal branches are found to store about 30% of the whole ring mass,\nirrespectively of its length. Finally, I draw an analogy between rings in the\nmelt and slip-linked chains, where contact points are enforced by mobile\nslip-links and for which a field-theoretic treatment can be employed to get\nsome insight into their typical conformations.

Methods. We describe\nthe RR Lyrae type pulsating stars as a system of coupled nonlinear oscillators.\nConsidering a spatial discretisation of the star, supposing a spherical\nsymmetry, we develop the equation of motion and energy up to the third order in\nthe radial and adiabatic case. Then, we include the influence of the ionization\nregion as a relaxation oscillator by including elements from synchronisation\ntheory. Results. This discrete approach allows us to exploit existing results\nin the coupled nonlinear oscillator field.

As expected, for small\nBHs, we observe finite magnitude for Ruppeiner invariant which shows the finite\ncorrelation between possible BH molecules while for large BHs, the correlation\nis very small. Finally, we study the Ruppeiner geometry and thermal stability\nof BI charged Lifshtiz BHs for different values of $z$. We observe that small\nBHs are thermally unstable in some situations. Also, the behavior of\ncorrelation between possible BH molecules for large BHs is the same as linearly\ncharged case. In both linearly and BI charged cases, for some choices of\nparameters, the BH systems behave like a Van der Waals gas near transition\npoint.\n","Comment: V2: 23 pages (revtex format), 13 figures (except one, all include\n  subfigures), some references added"]}]

This study\naims to investigate the aneurysmal SAH incidence rate in elderly population\nthan in middle aged population in China. Materials and methods: Aneurysmal SAH\ncases were collected retrospectively from the archives of 21 hospitals in\nMainland China. All the cases collected were from September 2016 and backward\nconsecutively for a period of time up to 8 years. SAH was initially diagnosed\nby brain computed tomography, and CT angiography (CTA) or digital subtraction\nangiography (DSA) was followed and SAH was confirmed to be due to cerebral\naneurysm. When for cases multiple bleeding occurred, the age of the first SAH\nwas used in this study. The toltal incidence from all hospital at each age were\nsummed together for females and males; then adjusted by the total population\nnumber at each age for females and males. The total population data was from\nthe 2010 population census of the People's Republic of China. Results: In total\nthere were 8,144 cases, with 4,861 females and 3,283 males. Our analysis shows\nfor both females and males the relative aneurysmal SAH rate started to decrease\nafter around 65 years old. The males the relative aneurysmal SAH rate might\nhave started to decrease after around 55 years old. Conclusion: In contrast to\nprevious reports, our data demonstrated a decreased aneurysmal subarachnoid\nhemorrhage incidence rate in elderly population than in middle aged population.\nOur data therefore support the hypothesis that aneurysms do not grow\nprogressively once they form but probably either rupture or stabilize and that\nvery elderly patients are at a reduced risk of rupture compared with atients\nwho are younger with the same-sized aneurysms.\n","Comment: Total 16 pages, 3 figures"]}]

Imagine classifying whether a hotel has a\ngym or a swimming pool, or whether a restaurant has a romantic atmosphere\nwithout ever asking its patrons. Algorithms we present can do just that.\n  Many web applications rely on knowing attributes of places, for instance,\nwhether a particular restaurant has WiFi or offers outdoor seating. Such data\ncan be used to support a range of user experiences, from explicit query-driven\nsearch to personalized place recommendations. However, obtaining these\nattributes is generally difficult, with existing approaches relying on\ncrowdsourcing or parsing online reviews, both of which are noisy, biased, and\nhave limited coverage. Here we present a novel approach to classifying place\nattributes, which learns from patrons' visit patterns based on anonymous\nobservational data.\n  Our method, STEPS, learns from aggregated sequences of place visits. For\nexample, if many people visit the restaurant on a Saturday evening, coming from\na luxury hotel or theater, and stay for a long time, then this restaurant is\nmore likely to have a romantic atmosphere.

Angular velocity is recorded and\nsimultaneously stored in a central location using a wireless network, thus\nallowing the analysis of body movements with a high sampling rate and a limited\ndelay. To investigate the influence of major/minor flow proportion (flow-ratio)\non bidirectional streams two different situations were tested: the balanced\nconfiguration (with equal flows in both directions) and an unbalanced\nconfiguration (with different major and minor flow). Results clearly show that\nunidirectional flow is more stable compared to the bidirectional case,\nrequiring less time to cross the experimental section and showing a very small\namount of rotation during the whole experiment. Both bidirectional\nconfigurations showed high values of body rotation, in particular during lane\nformation and dissolution. Finally, rotation directly measured on pedestrians'\nbody was compared with the one obtained indirectly by analyzing pedestrians'\ntrajectories. The comparison shows that, at least from a qualitative point of\nview, both methods are in agreement, thus suggesting that even properties which\ncan only be measured by motion sensing could be obtained indirectly through the\nanalysis of trajectories.

To speed up the expensive similarity search with DTW, branch and\nbound based pruning strategies are adopted. However, branch and bound based\npruning are only useful for very short queries (low dimensional time series),\nand the bounds are quite weak for longer queries.

The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) has the largest field of\nview (FOV) for detecting GRBs as it views the entire unocculted sky, but as a\nnon-imaging instrument it relies on the relative count rates observed in each\nof its 14 detectors to localize transients. Improving its ability to accurately\nlocate GRBs and other transients is vital to the paradigm of multi-messenger\nastronomy, including the electromagnetic follow-up of gravitational wave\nsignals. Here we present the BAyesian Location Reconstruction Of GRBs ({\\tt\nBALROG}) method for localizing and characterising GBM transients. Our approach\neliminates the systematics of previous approaches by simultaneously fitting for\nthe location and spectrum of a source. It also correctly incorporates the\nuncertainties in the location of a transient into the spectral parameters and\nproduces reliable positional uncertainties for both well-localized sources and\nthose for which the GBM data cannot effectively constrain the position. While\ncomputationally expensive, {\\tt BALROG} can be implemented to enable quick\nfollow-up of all GBM transient signals. Also, we identify possible response\nproblems that require attention as well as caution when using standard, public\nGBM DRMs. Finally, we examine the effects of including the variance in location\non the spectral parameters of GRB 080916C. We find that spectral parameters\nchange and no extra components are required when these effects are included in\ncontrast to when we use a fixed location.

To reduce latency, systems typically rely on a cache to service\nread-requests closer to the client. However, caches are not effective for\nwrite-heavy workloads, which have to be processed by the storage system in\norder to maintain serializability.\n  This paper presents a new technique, called optimistic abort, which reduces\nnetwork latency for high-contention, write-heavy workloads by identifying\ntransactions that will abort as early as possible, and aborting them before\nthey reach the store. We have implemented optimistic abort in a system called\nGotthard, which leverages recent advances in network data plane programmability\nto execute transaction processing logic directly in network devices. Gotthard\nexamines network traffic to observe and log transaction requests. If Gotthard\nsuspects that a transaction is likely to be aborted at the store, it aborts the\ntransaction early by re-writing the packet header, and routing the packets back\nto the client. Gotthard significantly reduces the overall latency and improves\nthe throughput for high-contention workloads.\n"]}]

We first derive and re-interpret\nDolinar's binary-hypothesis minimum-probability-of-error receiver as the one\nthat optimizes the information efficiency at each time instant, based on\nrecursive Bayesian updates within the receiver. Using this viewpoint, we\npropose a natural generalization of Dolinar's receiver design to discriminate\n$M$ coherent states each of which could now be a codeword, i.e., a sequence of\n$n$ coherent states each drawn from a modulation alphabet. We analyze the\nchannel capacity of the pure-loss optical channel with a general coherent\nprocessing receiver in the low-photon number regime and compare it with the\ncapacity achievable with direct detection and the Holevo limit (achieving the\nlatter would require a quantum joint-detection receiver). We show compelling\nevidence that despite the optimal performance of Dolinar's receiver for the\nbinary coherent-state hypothesis test (either in error probability or mutual\ninformation), the asymptotic communication rate achievable by such a coherent\nprocessing receiver is only as good as direct detection. This suggests that in\nthe infinitely-long codeword limit, all potential benefits of coherent\nprocessing at the receiver can be obtained by designing a good code and direct\ndetection, with no feedback within the receiver.\n"]}]
