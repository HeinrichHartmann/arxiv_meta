In response, this article\nproposes a simple new algorithm framework that requires no more computation\nthan a lasso path: the path of one-step estimators (POSE) does $L_1$ penalized\nregression estimation on a grid of decreasing penalties, but adapts\ncoefficient-specific weights to decrease as a function of the coefficient\nestimated in the previous path step. This provides sparse diminishing-bias\nregularization at no extra cost over the fastest lasso algorithms.

The time delay between\nthe images can also cause their redshifts to differ because of cosmological\nexpansion. This Differential Expansion Effect is likely to be small. Using a\nsimple model, we derive these effects from first principles.\n  One application would be to the Bullet Cluster, whose large tangential\nvelocity may be inconsistent with the $\\Lambda CDM$ paradigm. This velocity can\nbe estimated with complicated hydrodynamic models. Uncertainties with such\nmodels can be avoided using the MCE. We argue that the MCE should be observable\nwith ALMA.\n  However, such measurements can be corrupted by the DME if typical spiral\ngalaxies are used as sources. Fortunately, we find that if detailed spectral\nline profiles were available, then the DME and MCE could be distinguished. It\nmight also be feasible to calculate how much the DME should affect the mean\nredshift of each image. Resolved observations of the source would be required\nto do this accurately.\n  The DME is of order the source angular size divided by the Einstein radius\ntimes the redshift variation across the source. Thus, it mostly affects nearly\nedge-on spiral galaxies in certain orientations. This suggests that observers\nshould reduce the DME by careful choice of target, a possibility we discuss in\nsome detail.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables.

Under the setting where\nthe dimensions of the matrix increase to infinity and the probability of\nobserving each entry is identical, Theorem 4.1 gives the rate of convergence\nfor the estimated singular vectors; Theorem 4.3 gives a multivariate central\nlimit theorem for the estimated singular values. Even though the estimators use\nonly a partially observed matrix, they achieve the same rates of convergence as\nthe fully observed case. These estimators combine to form a consistent\nestimator of the full low rank matrix that is computed with a non-iterative\nalgorithm. In the cases studied in this paper, this estimator achieves the\nminimax lower bound in Koltchinskii et al. (2011). The numerical experiments\ncorroborate our theoretical results.\n"]}]

It is well known that in the case of two\nrigid spheres in an unbounded fluid, the hydrodynamic interaction does not\nproduce relative translation. More generally such an effective pair-interaction\nvanishes in configurations with spatial inversion symmetry; for example, an\nenantiomorphic pair in mirror image positions has no relative translation. We\nshow that the breaking of inversion symmetry by boundaries of the system\naccounts for the interactions between two spheres in confined geometries, as\nobserved in experiments. The same general principle also provides new\npredictions for interactions in other object configurations near obstacles. We\nexamine the time-dependent relative translation of two self-aligning objects,\nextending the numerical analysis of our preceding publication [Goldfriend,\nDiamant and Witten, Phys. Fluids 27, 123303 (2015)]. The interplay between the\norientational interaction and the translational one, in most cases, leads over\ntime to repulsion between the two objects. The repulsion is qualitatively\ndifferent for self-aligning objects compared to the more symmetric case of\nuniform prolate spheroids. The separation between the two objects increases\nwith time $t$ as $t^{1/3}$ in the former case, and more strongly, as $t$, in\nthe latter.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 4 figures"]}]

To clarify the situation, we address\nthe optimum ranges of applicability (in terms of the $T_{eff}$ range covered by\nthe HB stars) for visual and near-UV CMDs, as far as application of this HB $Y$\ntest goes. We consider both Stromgren and Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nbandpasses.

Other HST UV filters do not\nappear to be as severely affected by this degeneracy effect, to which visual\nbandpasses are also immune.

Two quantitative measures of modulated light curves are employed as\nthe proxies of magnetic activity for solar-type stars observed with Kepler\ntelescope.

The two measures are complementary and depict different\naspects of magnetic activities on solar-type stars. By using the two proxies\n$i_{AC}$ and $R_{eff}$, we analyzed activity properties of two carefully\nselected solar-type stars observed with Kepler (Kepler ID: 9766237 and\n10864581), which have distinct rotational periods (14.7 vs. 6.0 days).

For\nthe Kepler star with the faster rotation rate, $i_{AC}$-cycle and\n$R_{eff}$-cycle are in the same phase, while for the Sun (slower rotator), they\nare in the opposite phase. By comparing the solar light curve with simultaneous\nphotospheric magnetograms, it is identified that the magnetic feature that\ncauses the periodic light curve during solar minima is the faculae of the\nenhanced network region, which can also be a candidate of magnetic features\nthat dominate the periodic light curves on the two Kepler stars.\n","Comment: 46 pages, 14 figures, 6 tables"]}]

The first\nis a contribution in the study of complex networks. We propose preferential\nattachment model with degree bound for the first time. In the normal\npreferential attachment model, the degree distribution follows a power law,\nwith many nodes of low degree and a few nodes of high degree. In our scheme,\nthe nodes can have a maximum degree $d_{\\max}$, where $d_{\\max}$ is an integer\nchosen according to the application. The second is in the security of wireless\nsensor networks.

In the proposed method, the $M$ input integer data streams\nare linearly superimposed to form $M$ numerically-entangled integer data\nstreams that are stored in-place of the original inputs. A series of LSB\noperations can then be performed directly using these entangled data streams.\nThe results are extracted from the $M$ entangled output streams by additions\nand arithmetic shifts. Any soft errors affecting any single disentangled output\nstream are guaranteed to be detectable via a specific post-computation\nreliability check.

It is known that information cascades can be\nfragile and based on very little information, and that they have a high\nlikelihood of being wrong.\n  Generalizing the problem to arbitrary graphs reveals interesting insights. In\nparticular, we show that in a random graph $G(n,q)$, for the right value of\n$q$, the number of nodes making a wrong decision is logarithmic in $n$.

Unfortunately, these methods do not necessarily\nachieve their goal of making the multivariate distribution of covariates for\nthe control group identical to that of the treated, leaving some (potentially\nmultivariate) functions of the covariates with different means between the two\ngroups. When these \"imbalanced\" functions influence the non-treatment potential\noutcome, the conditioning on observed covariates fails, and ATT estimates may\nbe biased. Kernel balancing, introduced here, targets a weaker requirement for\nunbiased ATT estimation, specifically, that the expected non-treatment\npotential outcome for the treatment and control groups are equal. The\nconditional expectation of the non-treatment potential outcome is assumed to\nfall in the space of functions associated with a choice of kernel, implying a\nset of basis functions in which this regression surface is linear.

The results of the Monte Carlo simulations under the semiclassical\napproximation correspond well with those obtained with the quantum mechanical\nperturbation theory for the stochastic process. In the second method, we study\na master equation of the Jaynes-Cummings model with cavity losses in a fully\nquantum mechanical manner. We solve the master equation numerically with the\nRunge-Kutta method. For both semiclassical and fully quantum mechanical\nanalyses, we can observe both the $\\mbox{T}_{1}$ and $\\mbox{T}_{2}$ decays.\nThis paper is a sequel of the reference [H.~Azuma, Prog. Theor.

Common to all is the concept of constructing a smooth\nsurface by blending together overlapping patches (or, charts), as in\ndifferential geometry description of manifolds. Each patch on the surface has a\ncorresponding planar patch with a smooth one-to-one mapping onto the surface.\nIn our implementation, manifold techniques are combined with conformal\nparametrisations and the partition-of-unity method for deriving smooth basis\nfunctions on unstructured quadrilateral meshes. Each vertex and its adjacent\nelements on the surface control mesh have a corresponding planar patch of\nelements. The star-shaped planar patch with congruent wedge-shaped elements is\nsmoothly parameterised with copies of a conformally mapped unit square. The\nconformal maps can be easily inverted in order to compute the transition\nfunctions between the different planar patches that have an overlap on the\nsurface.

Therefore, a variety of bonding\nmodels have been developed, each defining the structure of molecules in a\ndifferent manner with the goal of explaining and predicting chemical\nproperties. This thesis describes the initial development of gradient bundle\nanalysis (GBA), a chemical bonding model that creates a high resolution picture\nof chemical interactions within the charge density framework. GBA is based on\nconcepts from the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM), but uses a more\ncomplete picture of the topology and geometry of the electron charge density to\nunderstand and predict bonding interactions. Gradient bundles are defined as\nvolumes bounded by zero-flux surfaces (ZFSs) in the gradient of the charge\ndensity with well-defined energies. The structure of gradient bundles provides\nan avenue for detecting the locations of valence electrons, which correspond to\nreactive regions in a molecule. The number of electrons in bonding regions,\nwhich are defined by the lowering of kinetic energy in gradient bundles, is\nfound to correlate to bond dissociation energy in diatomic molecules.\nFurthermore, site reactivity can be understood and predicted by observing the\nmotion of ZFSs bounding gradient bundles and calculating condensed gradient\nbundle Fukui functions.
