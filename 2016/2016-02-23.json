Muon\nenergy has traditionally been determined by measuring the specific energy loss\n(dE/dx) along the muon's path and relating the dE/dx to the muon energy.\nBecause high-energy muons (E_mu > 1 TeV) lose energy randomly, the spread in\ndE/dx values is quite large, leading to a typical energy resolution of 0.29 in\nlog10(E_mu) for a muon observed over a 1 km path length in the IceCube\ndetector. In this paper, we present an improved method that uses a truncated\nmean and other techniques to determine the muon energy. The muon track is\ndivided into separate segments with individual dE/dx values. The elimination of\nsegments with the highest dE/dx results in an overall dE/dx that is more\nclosely correlated to the muon energy. This method results in an energy\nresolution of 0.22 in log10(E_mu), which gives a 26% improvement. This\ntechnique is applicable to any large water or ice detector and potentially to\nlarge scintillator or liquid argon detectors.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 16 figures"]}]

From the analysis of the X-ray\nhardness ratio, we find that sources with both 70{\\mu}m and X-ray detection\ntend to have a higher hardness ratio relative to the whole X-ray selected\nsource population, suggesting the presence of more X-ray absorption in the\n70{\\mu}m detected sources. In addition, we find that the observed far-infrared\ncolours of 70{\\mu}m detected sources with and without X-ray emission are\nsimilar, suggesting the far-infrared emission could be mainly powered by star\nformation.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 10 figures and 3 Tables"]}]

Muon neutrinos are detected and their\ndirection inferred by mapping the light produced by the secondary muon track\ninside the volume instrumented with photomultipliers. Reconstructing the muon\ntrack from the observed light is challenging due to noise, light scattering in\nthe ice medium, and the possibility of simultaneously having multiple muons\ninside the detector, resulting from the large flux of cosmic ray muons. This\nmanuscript describes work on two problems: (1) the track reconstruction\nproblem, in which, given a set of observations, the goal is to recover the\ntrack of a muon; and (2) the coincident event problem, which is to determine\nhow many muons are active in the detector during a time window. Rather than\nsolving these problems by developing more complex physical models that are\napplied at later stages of the analysis, our approach is to augment the\ndetectors early reconstruction with data filters and robust statistical\ntechniques. These can be implemented at the level of on-line reconstruction\nand, therefore, improve all subsequent reconstructions. Using the metric of\nmedian angular resolution, a standard metric for track reconstruction, we\nimprove the accuracy in the initial reconstruction direction by 13%. We also\npresent improvements in measuring the number of muons in coincident events: we\ncan accurately determine the number of muons 98% of the time.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Nuclear Instruments and Methods in\n  Physics Research Section A"]}]

First,\nthe framework allows to estimate and disentangle not only first-round effects\n(i.e. shock on external assets) and second-round effects (i.e. distress induced\nin the interbank network), but also third-round effects induced by possible\nfire sales. Second, it allows to monitor at the same time the impact of shocks\non individual or groups of financial institutions as well as their\nvulnerability to shocks on counterparties or certain asset classes. Third, it\nincludes estimates for loss distributions, thus combining network effects with\nfamiliar risk measures such as VaR and CVaR. Fourth, in order to perform\nrobustness analyses and cope with incomplete data, the framework features a\nmodule for the generation of sets of networks of interbank exposures that are\ncoherent with the total lending and borrowing of each bank. As an illustration,\nwe carry out a stress-test exercise on a dataset of listed European banks over\nthe years 2008-2013.

In this paper, we propose\na method to explore the intrinsic similarities among the structures of queries\nin a workload for fragmentation and allocation, which aims to reduce the number\nof crossing matches and the communication cost during SPARQL query processing.\nSpecifically, we mine and select some frequent access patterns to reflect the\ncharacteristics of the workload.

Vertical\nfragmentation is for better throughput and horizontal fragmentation is for\nbetter performance. After fragmentation, we discuss how to allocate these\nfragments to various sites.

An extended,\nstar-forming ring that forms by fresh gas during the central quenching process\nshows as a rising specific SFR (sSFR) profile, which is interpreted as\ninside-out quenching. Before quenching, the stellar density profile grows\nself-similarly, maintaining its log-log shape because the sSFR is similar at\nall radii. During the quenching process, the stellar density saturates to a\nconstant value, especially in the inner 1 kpc. The stellar mass and SFR\nprofiles deduced from observations show very similar shapes, consistent with\nthe scenario of wet compaction leading to inside-out quenching and the\nsubsequent saturation of a dense stellar core.

This is\nparticularly true for the helicity-suppressed annihilation of Majorana\nparticles, like neutralinos, into fermion pairs. Surprisingly, and despite the\npotentially large effect due to the strong coupling, this has so far been\nstudied in much less detail for the internal bremsstrahlung of gluons than for\nphotons or electroweak gauge bosons. Here, we aim at bridging that gap by\npresenting a general analysis of neutralino annihilation into quark anti-quark\npairs and a gluon, allowing e.g. for arbitrary neutralino compositions and\nkeeping the leading quark mass dependence at all stages in the calculation. We\nfind in some cases largely enhanced annihilation rates, especially for\nscenarios with squarks being close to degenerate in mass with the lightest\nneutralino, but also notable distortions in the associated antiproton and\ngamma-ray spectra. Both effects significantly impact limits from indirect\nsearches for dark matter and are thus important to be taken into account in,\ne.g., global scans. For extensive scans, on the other hand, full calculations\nof QCD corrections are numerically typically too expensive to perform for each\npoint in parameter space. We present here for the first time an efficient,\nnumerically fast implementation of QCD corrections, extendable in a\nstraight-forward way to non-supersymmetric models, which avoids computationally\ndemanding full one-loop calculations or event generator runs and yet fully\ncaptures the leading effects relevant for indirect dark matter searches.

Slow\nretrograde precession of the line-of-nodes results in a signal---the negative\nsuperhump---with a period slightly less than the orbital period. Previous\nstudies have shown that tilted disks exhibit negative superhumps, but a\nconsensus on how a disk initially tilts has not been reached. Analytical work\nby Lai suggests that a magnetic field on the primary can lead to a tilt\ninstability in a disk when the dipole moment is offset in angle from the spin\naxis of the primary and when the primary's spin axis is, itself, not aligned\nwith the angular momentum axis of the binary orbit. However, Lai did not apply\nhis work to the formation of negative superhumps. In this paper, we add Lai's\nmodel to an existing smoothed particle hydrodynamics code. Using this code, we\ndemonstrate the emergence of negative superhumps in the \"light curve\" for a\nrange of magnetic dipole moments. We show that the period deficits calculated\nfrom these negative superhumps match those in simulations using manually tilted\ndisks. When positive superhumps appear ($q \\lesssim 0.33$), we show that the\nperiod excesses calculated from these signals are also consistent with previous\nresults.

Thus, no ferromagnetic order exists for\n$K/J > 0.25$. So, the phase-diagrams were scanned by varying the values of $K$\nin this interval.

A key route whereby the Sun may influence surface climate is\ninitiated in the tropical stratosphere by the absorption of solar ultraviolet\n(UV) radiation by ozone, leading to a modification of the temperature and wind\nstructures and consequently to the surface through changes in wave propagation\nand circulation. While changes in total, spectrally-integrated, solar\nirradiance lead to small variations in global mean surface temperature, the\n`top-down' UV effect preferentially influences on regional scales at\nmid-to-high latitudes with, in particular, a solar signal noted in the North\nAtlantic Oscillation (NAO).

In this paper, we present a Chain Catch simulator that\nallows us to incorporate game rules, design strategies and simulate the game\nplay. We developed cost model driven strategies for each of Escapee, Catcher\nand Chain. Our results show that Sliding slope strategy is the best strategy\nfor Escapees whereas Tagging method is the best method for chain s movement in\nChain Catch. We also use production quality robots to implement the game play\nin a physical environment and analyze game strategies on real robots. Our real\nrobots implementation in different scenarios shows that game strategies work as\nexpected and a complete chain formation takes place successfully in each game.\n"]}]

By changing the origin in the interior of the body we have a smoothly\nvarying family of Minkowski functionals. This is called the Funk metric. Under\nsome regularity conditions the Minkowski functionals allow us to measure the\nvolume (area) of the indicatrix bodies (hypersurfaces).

The effective\nuse of random projections requires efficient coding schemes for quantizing\n(real-valued) projected data into integers. In this paper, we focus on a simple\n2-bit coding scheme. In particular, we develop accurate nonlinear estimators of\ndata similarity based on the 2-bit strategy. This work will have important\npractical applications. For example, in the task of near neighbor search, a\ncrucial step (often called re-ranking) is to compute or estimate data\nsimilarities once a set of candidate data points have been identified by hash\ntable techniques. This re-ranking step can take advantage of the proposed\ncoding scheme and estimator.\n  As a related task, in this paper, we also study a simple uniform quantization\nscheme for the purpose of building hash tables with projected data. Our\nanalysis shows that typically only a small number of bits are needed. For\nexample, when the target similarity level is high, 2 or 3 bits might be\nsufficient. When the target similarity level is not so high, it is preferable\nto use only 1 or 2 bits. Therefore, a 2-bit scheme appears to be overall a good\nchoice for the task of sublinear time approximate near neighbor search via hash\ntables.\n  Combining these results, we conclude that 2-bit random projections should be\nrecommended for approximate near neighbor search and similarity estimation.\nExtensive experimental results are provided.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1403.8144"]}]

It enables us to analyze the\neffect of the landscape composition (proportion of semi-natural habitat,\nnon-treated crops, slightly treated crops and conventionally treated crops) on\nthe effectiveness of pest biocontrol. Effectiveness is measured through\nenvironmental and agronomical descriptors, measuring respectively the impact of\nthe pesticides on the environment and the average agronomic productivity of the\nwhole landscape taking into account losses caused by pests.\n  Conclusions: The effectiveness of the pesticide, the intensity of the\ntreatment and the pest intrinsic growth rate are found to be the main drivers\nof landscape productivity.

Though\nhyperchaos arise in different dynamical situations and find several practical\napplications, a proper understanding of the geometric structure of a\nhyperchaotic attractor still remains an unsolved problem.
