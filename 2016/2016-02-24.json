The redshifted troughs extend to velocities\nup to v=12,000 km/s and the trough widths exceed 3000 km/s in all but one case.\nApproximately 1 in 1000 BAL quasars with blueshifted C IV absorption also has\nredshifted C IV absorption; objects with C IV absorption present only at\nredshifted velocities are roughly four times rarer. In more than half of our\nobjects, redshifted absorption is seen in C II or Al III as well as C IV,\nmaking low-ionization absorption at least ten times more common among BAL\nquasars with redshifted troughs than among standard BAL quasars. However, the C\nIV absorption equivalent widths in our objects are on average smaller than\nthose of standard BAL quasars with low-ionization absorption. We consider\nseveral possible ways of generating redshifted absorption. The two most likely\npossibilities may be at work simultaneously, in the same objects or in\ndifferent ones.

The key feature of this new HDG method is the use of a\nspecial form of the numerical trace of the stresses, which makes the error\nanalysis different from the projection-based error analyzes used for most other\nHDG methods. For arbitrary polyhedral elements, we approximate the stress by\nusing polynomials of degree k>=1 and the displacement by using polynomials of\ndegree k+1. In contrast, to approximate the numerical trace of the displacement\non the faces, we use polynomials of degree k only. This allows for a very\nefficient implementation of the method, since the numerical trace of the\ndisplacement is the only globally-coupled unknown, but does not degrade the\nconvergence properties of the method. Indeed, we prove optimal orders of\nconvergence for both the stresses and displacements on the elements. In the\nalmost incompressible case, we show the error of the stress is also optimal in\nthe standard L2-norm.

In this study, we approach this classification\nproblem by constructing a classifier that works in a set of strings. To\nevaluate the generalization error of such a classifier theoretically,\nprobability theory for strings is required. Therefore, we first extend a limit\ntheorem on the asymptotic behavior of a consensus sequence of strings, which is\nthe counterpart of the mean of numerical vectors, as demonstrated in the\nprobability theory on a metric space of strings developed by one of the authors\nand his colleague in a previous study [18]. Using the obtained result, we then\ndemonstrate that our learning machine classifies strings in an asymptotically\noptimal manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate the usefulness of our machine in\npractical data analysis by applying it to predicting protein--protein\ninteractions using amino acid sequences.\n","Comment: This manuscript has been withdrawn because the experiments in Section\n  6 are insufficient"]}]

The\nidentical conditions, that remained unstated in our papers on single-visit\nmethodology, are needed for single-visit methodology to work. We show that the\nclass of admissible models is quite broad and does not excessively restrict the\napplication of the RSPF or the single-visit methodology. To complement the work\nby Knape and Korner-Nievergelt, we study the performance of multiple-visit\nmethods under the scaled logistic detection function and a much wider set of\nsituations. In general, under the scaled logistic detection function\nmultiple-visits methods also lead to biased estimates. As a solution to this\nproblem, we extend the single-visit methodology to a class of models that\nallows use of scaled probability function. We propose a Multinomial extension\nof single visit methodology that can be used to check whether the detection\nfunction satisfies the RSPF condition or not. Furthermore, we show that if the\nscaling factor depends on covariates, then it can also be estimated.\n","Comment: Forum article and rebuttal to Knape, J., & Korner-Nievergelt, F.,\n  2015.

A number of comparison results are also provided, which show the\nrelation between PRC and other popular complexity measures used in statistical\nlearning theory, including Rademacher complexity and Transductive Rademacher\nComplexity (TRC). We argue that PRC is a more suitable complexity measure for\ntransductive learning. Finally, these results are combined with a standard\nconcentration argument to provide novel data-dependent risk bounds for\ntransductive learning.\n","Comment: Corrected error in Inequality (1)"]}]

The data reach a\nlimiting surface brightness (1sigma) of ~1 x 10^-19 erg s^-1 cm^-2 arcsec^-2 in\nazimuthally averaged radial profiles, an order of magnitude improvement over\nprevious narrowband imaging. Our sample consists of 26 spectroscopically\nconfirmed Ly alpha-emitting, but mostly continuum-faint (m_AB >~ 27) galaxies.\nIn most objects the Ly alpha emission is considerably more extended than the UV\ncontinuum light. While 5 of the faintest galaxies in the sample show no\nsignificantly detected Ly alpha haloes, the derived upper limits suggest that\nthis is just due to insufficient S/N. Ly alpha haloes therefore appear to be\n(nearly) ubiquitous even for low-mass (~10^8-10^9 M_sun) star-forming galaxies\nat z>3. We decompose the Ly alpha emission of each object into a compact\n`continuum-like' and an extended halo component, and infer sizes and\nluminosities of the haloes. The extended Ly alpha emission approximately\nfollows an exponential surface brightness distribution with a scale length of a\nfew kpc. While these haloes are thus quite modest in terms of their absolute\nsizes, they are larger by a factor of 5-15 than the corresponding rest-frame UV\ncontinuum sources as seen by HST. They are also much more extended, by a factor\n~5, than Ly alpha haloes around low-redshift star-forming galaxies. Between\n~40% and >90% of the observed Ly alpha flux comes from the extended halo\ncomponent, with no obvious correlation of this fraction with either the\nabsolute or the relative size of the Ly alpha halo. Our observations provide\ndirect insights into the spatial distribution of at least partly neutral gas\nresiding in the circumgalactic medium of low to intermediate mass galaxies at z\n> 3.\n","Comment: accepted by Astronomy & Astrophysics"]}]

This appears to occur in\nluminous blue variables (LBVs), Type IIn supernovae progenitors, classical\nnovae, and X-ray bursts. We show that when the wind kinetic power exceeds\nEddington, the photons are trapped and behave like a fluid. Convection does not\nplay a significant role in the wind energy transport. The wind properties\ndepend on the ratio of a characteristic speed in the problem vc ~ (Edot\nG)^{1/5} (where Edot is the heating rate) to the stellar escape speed near the\nheating region vesc(r_h). For vc > vesc(r_h) the wind kinetic power at large\nradii Edot_w ~ Edot. For vc < vesc(r_h), most of the energy is used to unbind\nthe wind material and thus Edot_w < Edot. Multidimensional hydrodynamic\nsimulations without radiation diffusion using FLASH and one-dimensional\nhydrodynamic simulations with radiation diffusion using MESA are in good\nagreement with the analytic predictions. The photon luminosity from the wind is\nitself super-Eddington but in many cases the photon luminosity is likely\ndominated by `internal shocks' in the wind.

We aim to\nrefine the physical properties and architecture of both systems. Methods. We\nuse SPHERE commissioning data and REM observations, as well as literature and\nunpublished data from VLT/SINFONI, VLT/NaCo, Gemini/NICI, and Keck/NIRC2.\nResults. We derive new photometry and confirm the nearly daily photometric\nvariability of PZ Tel A. Using literature data spanning 38 yr, we show that the\nstar also exhibits a long-term variability trend. The 0.63-3.8 mic SED of PZ\nTel B allows us to revise its properties: spectral type M7+/-1, Teff=2700+/-100\nK, log(g)<4.5 dex, log(L/L_Sun)=-2.51+/-0.10 dex, and mass 38-72 MJ. The 1-3.8\nmic SED of HD 1160 B suggests a massive brown dwarf or a low-mass star with\nspectral type M5.5-7.0, Teff=3000+/-100 K, [M/H]=-0.5-0.0 dex,\nlog(L/L_Sun)=-2.81+/-0.10 dex, and mass 39-168 MJ. We confirm the deceleration\nand high eccentricity (e>0.66) of PZ Tel B. For e<0.9, the inclination,\nlongitude of the ascending node, and time of periastron passage are well\nconstrained. The system is seen close to an edge-on geometry. We reject other\nbrown dwarf candidates outside 0.25\" for both systems, and massive giant\nplanets (>4 MJ) outside 0.5\" for the PZ Tel system. We also show that K1-K2\ncolor can be used with YJH low-resolution spectra to identify young L-type\ncompanions, provided high photometric accuracy (<0.05 mag) is achieved.\nConclusions. SPHERE opens new horizons in the study of young brown dwarfs and\ngiant exoplanets thanks to high-contrast imaging capabilities at optical and\nnear-infrared wavelengths, as well as high signal-to-noise spectroscopy in the\nnear-infrared from low (R~30-50) to medium resolutions (R~350).\n","Comment: 25 pages, 23 figures, accepted for publication in A&A on Oct. 13th,\n  2015; version including language editing.

However, a fraction of 20-70% (increasing with decreasing\nmetallicity) exhibit dramatic enhancements in their abundances of carbon - the\nso-called carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars. A key question for Galactic\nchemical evolution models is whether this non-standard composition reflects\nthat of the stellar natal clouds, or is due to local, post-birth mass transfer\nof chemically processed material from a binary companion; CEMP stars should\nthen all be members of binary systems. Our aim is to determine the frequency\nand orbital parameters of binaries among CEMP stars with and without\nover-abundances of neutron-capture elements - CEMP-s and CEMP-no stars,\nrespectively - as a test of this local mass-transfer scenario. This paper\ndiscusses a sample of 24 CEMP-no stars, while a subsequent paper will consider\na similar sample of CEMP-s stars. Most programme stars exhibit no statistically\nsignificant radial-velocit variation over this period and appear to be single,\nwhile four are found to be binaries with orbital periods of 300-2,000 days and\nnormal eccentricity; the binary frequency for the sample is 17+-9%.

Including\nfeedback physics significantly increases the diversity. Subhalo mass and\n$V_{max}$ distributions vary by $\\approx20\\%$. The galaxy populations also show\nstriking code-to-code variations. Although the Tully-Fisher relation is similar\nin almost all codes, the number of galaxies with $10^{9}M_\\odot/h\\lesssim\nM_*\\lesssim 10^{12}M_\\odot/h$ can differ by a factor of 4. Individual galaxies\nshow code-to-code scatter of $\\sim0.5$ dex in stellar mass. Moreover, strong\nsystematic differences exist, with some codes producing galaxies $70\\%$ smaller\nthan others. The diversity partially arises from the inclusion/absence of AGN\nfeedback. Our results combined with our companion papers demonstrate that\nsubgrid physics is not just subject to fine-tuning, but the complexity of\nbuilding galaxies in all environments remains a challenge.

The abundances of excited rotational levels, calculated at\nequilibrium in the simulations are very similar to the observed abundances\ninferred from FUSE results. This is a direct consequence of the presence of the\nH2 enriched diffuse and warm gas.

Consequently a significant fraction of warm H2\nexists in the low density gas. This warm H2 leads to column densities of\nexcited rotational levels close to the observed ones likely revealing the\ncomplex intermix between the warm and the cold gas in molecular clouds.

The aim of this paper is to find a\nglobal mathematical description of Crab pulsar's phase as a function of time\nfor the complete set of published Jodrell Bank radio ephemerides (JBE) in the\nperiod 1988-2014. We apply the mathematical techniques developed for analyzing\noptical observations to the analysis of JBE.

The first function is the best-fitting local\nbraking index law, and the second function represents small residuals from this\nlaw with an amplitude of only a few turns, which rapidly relaxes to the local\nbraking index law. From our analysis, we demonstrate that the power law index\nundergoes \"instantaneous\" changes at the time of observed jumps in rotational\nfrequency (glitches). We find that the phase evolution of the Crab pulsar is\ndominated by a series of constant braking law episodes, with the braking index\nchanging abruptly after each episode in the range of values between 2.1 and\n2.6. Deviations from such a regular phase description behave as oscillations\ntriggered by glitches and amount to fewer than 40 turns during the above\nperiod, in which the pulsar has made more than 2.0e10 turns.

MM-faint transition discs are consistent with\nwhat would naively be expected from a disc undergoing dispersal; however,\nmm-bright discs are not, and are likely to be rare and long-lived objects. We\ndiscuss the two commonly proposed mechanisms for creating transition discs:\nphotoevaporation and planet-disc interactions, with a particular emphasis on\nhow they would evolve in these models, comparing these predictions to the\nobserved population. More theoretical work on explaining the lack of optically\nthick, non-accreting transition discs is required in both the photoevaporation\nand planetary hypothesis, before we can start to use transition discs to\nconstrain models of planet formation. Finally, we suggest that the few discs\nwith primordial looking SEDs, but serendipitously imaged, showing large\ncavities in the mm (e.g. MWC758 & WSB 60) may represent a hidden population of\nassociated objects.

Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) data are extremely\nsensitive to the phase stability of the VLBI array. This is especially\nimportant when we reach {\\mu}Jy r.m.s. sensitivities. Calibration using\nstandard phase referencing techniques is often used to improve the phase\nstability of VLBI data but the results are often not optimal. This is evident\nin blank fields that do not have in-beam calibrators. Aims. We present a\ncalibration algorithm termed Multi-Source Self-Calibration (MSSC) which can be\nused after standard phase referencing on wide-field VLBI observations. This is\ntested on a 1.6 GHz wide-field VLBI data set of the Hubble Deep Field-North and\nthe Hubble Flanking Fields. Methods. MSSC uses multiple target sources detected\nin the field via standard phase referencing techniques and modifies the\nvisibili- ties so that each data set approximates to a point source. These are\ncombined to increase the signal to noise and permit self-calibration. In\nprinciple, this should allow residual phase changes caused by the troposphere\nand ionosphere to be corrected. By means of faceting, the technique can also be\nused for direction dependent calibration. Results. Phase corrections, derived\nusing MSSC, were applied to a wide-field VLBI data set of the HDF-N comprising\nof 699 phase centres. MSSC was found to perform considerably better than\nstandard phase referencing and single source self-calibration. All detected\nsources exhibited dramatic improvements in dynamic range. Using MSSC, one\nsource reached the detection threshold taking the total detected sources to\ntwenty. 60% of these sources can now be imaged with uniform weighting compared\nto just 45% with standard phase referencing. The Parseltongue code which\nimplements MSSC has been released and made publicly available to the\nastronomical community (https://github.com/jradcliffe5/multi_self_cal).\n","Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures, accepted to A&A"]}]

Moreover, we consider distribution of MSP within a GC and the effects\nrelated to the non-central location of the dominating, energetic MSP. Such more\ncomplete scenario is considered for the modelling of the GeV-TeV gamma-ray\nemission from the core collapsed GC M15 and also for GCs which contain recently\ndiscovered energetic MSPs within NGC 6624 and M28. The confrontation of the\nmodelling of the gamma-ray emission with the observations with the present\nCherenkov telescopes and the future Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) allows to\nconstrain more reliably the efficiency of lepton production within the inner\nmagnetosphere of the MSPs and re-accelerated in their vicinity. We discuss the\nexpected limits on this parameter in the context of expectations from the\npulsar models. we conclude that deep observations of GCs, even with the present\nsensitivity of Cherenkov telescopes (H.E.S.S., MAGIC, VERITAS), should start to\nconstrain the models for the acceleration and radiation processes of leptons\nwithin the inner pulsar magnetosphere and its surrounding.\n","Comment: 15 pages, submitted to MNRAS"]}]

Recent\nexperimental investigations of small model boats propelled by propagating\nflexural waves carried out by the present author and his co-workers\ndemonstrated viability of this type of propulsion as an alternative to a\nwell-known screw propeller. In the attempts of theoretical explanation of the\nobtained experimental results using the theory of Lighthill for fish\nlocomotion, it was found that this theory predicts zero thrust for such model\nboats, which is in contradiction with the results of the experiments. One\nshould note in this connection that the theory developed by Lighthill assumes\nthat the amplitudes of propulsive waves created by fish body motion grow from\nzero on the front (at fish heads) to their maximum values at the tails. This is\nconsistent with fish body motion in nature, but is not compatible with the\nbehaviour of localised flexural waves used for propulsion in the experimental\nmodel vessels. To overcome the problem of predicting zero thrust for the above\nvessels, it is suggested in the present work that nonlinear distortion of\nlocalised flexural waves may be responsible for generation of thrust. This\nhypothesis is explored in the present work by adding nonlinear harmonics of\npropulsive flexural waves to the formula derived by Lighthill for generated\nthrust. For simplicity, only the lowest (third) harmonic growing linearly with\nthe distance of propagation was used. The resulting formula for the averaged\nthrust shows that, due to the effect of the third harmonic, the thrust is no\nlonger zero, thereby demonstrating that nonlinear distortion of the propulsive\nflexural waves may be paramount for the existence of wave-like aquatic\npropulsion of small marine craft using freely propagating flexural waves.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 5 figures"]}]

The main purpose of this article is to\nprovide a comprehensive study and an updated review on sparse representation\nand to supply a guidance for researchers. The taxonomy of sparse representation\nmethods can be studied from various viewpoints. For example, in terms of\ndifferent norm minimizations used in sparsity constraints, the methods can be\nroughly categorized into five groups: sparse representation with $l_0$-norm\nminimization, sparse representation with $l_p$-norm (0$<$p$<$1) minimization,\nsparse representation with $l_1$-norm minimization and sparse representation\nwith $l_{2,1}$-norm minimization. In this paper, a comprehensive overview of\nsparse representation is provided. The available sparse representation\nalgorithms can also be empirically categorized into four groups: greedy\nstrategy approximation, constrained optimization, proximity algorithm-based\noptimization, and homotopy algorithm-based sparse representation. The\nrationales of different algorithms in each category are analyzed and a wide\nrange of sparse representation applications are summarized, which could\nsufficiently reveal the potential nature of the sparse representation theory.\nSpecifically, an experimentally comparative study of these sparse\nrepresentation algorithms was presented.

We show this by examining the implications of linear dispersion\nin an ordinary directional coupler. Dispersion unlocks several novel\ncapabilities for this device, including in-situ control over photon spectral\nand polarization entanglement, tunable photon time-ordering, and\nentanglement-sensitive two-photon coincidence generation. Also revealed is an\nability to maintain perfect two-photon anti-coalescence while tuning the\ninterference visibility, which has no equivalent in bulk-optics. The outcome of\nthis work adds to a suite of state engineering and characterization tools that\nbenefit from the advantages of integration. It also paves the way for\nre-evaluating the possibilities offered by dispersion in other on-chip devices.\n","Comment: To be published in Optica (OSA); 10 pages, 8 figures"]}]

The latter implies that the star formation\nrate increases systematically during the early stages of evolution, and occurs\nvia filamentary flows onto \"hubs\" of higher density, mass, and velocity\ndispersion, and culminates a few Myr after than the small-scale collapses have\nstarted to form stars. In turn, the small-scale collapses occur in clumps\nembedded in the filaments, and are themselves falling into the larger potential\nwell of the still-ongoing large-scale collapse. The stars formed in the early,\nsmall-scale collapses share the infall motion of their parent clumps towards\nthe larger potential trough, so that the filaments feed both gaseous and\nstellar material to the hubs. This leads to the presence of older stars in a\nregion where new protostars are still forming, to a scale-free or fractal\nstructure of the clusters, in which each unit is composed of smaller-scale\nones, and to the eventual merging of the subunits, explaining the observed\nstructural features of open clusters.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 7 figures, to appear in the proceedings of IAU Symposium\n  316: Formation, Evolution, and Survival of Massive Star Clusters"]}]

Inspired by proteins that generate membrane\ncurvature, sense the underlying membrane geometry, and migrate to high\ncurvature sites, we explore the question: Can colloids, adhered to lipid\nbilayers, also sense and respond to membrane geometry? We report the curvature\nmigration of Janus microparticles adhered to giant unilamellar vesicles\nelongated to present well defined curvature fields. However, unlike proteins,\nwhich migrate to minimize membrane bending energy, colloids migrate by an\nentirely different mechanism. By determining the energy dissipated along a\ntrajectory, the energy field mediating these interactions is inferred to be\nlinear in the local deviatoric curvature, as reported previously for colloids\ntrapped at curved interfaces between immiscible fluids. In this latter system,\nhowever, the energy gradients are far larger, so particles move\ndeterministically, whereas the colloids on vesicles move with significant\nfluctuations in regions of weak curvature gradient. By addressing the role of\nBrownian motion, we show that the observed curvature migration of colloids on\nbilayers is indeed a case of curvature capillary migration, with membrane\ntension playing the role of interfacial tension. Furthermore, since this motion\nis mediated by membrane tension and shape, it can be modulated, or even turned\n\"on\" and \"off\", by simply varying these parameters. While particle-particle\ninteractions on lipid membranes have been considered in many contributions, we\nreport here an exciting and previously unexplored modality to actively direct\nthe migration of colloids to desired locations on lipid bilayers.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 12 figures"]}]
