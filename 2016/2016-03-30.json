However, conclusive evidence for\ndisks has remained elusive for the most massive young objects. This is mainly\ndue to significant observational challenges. Incisive studies, even targeting\nindividual objects, are therefore relevant to the progression of the field. NGC\n3603 IRS 9A* is a young massive stellar object still surrounded by an envelope\nof molecular gas. Previous mid-infrared observations with long-baseline\ninterferometry provided evidence for a disk of 50 mas diameter at its core.\nThis work aims at a comprehensive study of the physics and morphology of IRS 9A\nat near-infrared wavelengths. New sparse aperture masking interferometry data\ntaken with NACO/VLT at Ks and Lp filters were obtained and analysed together\nwith archival CRIRES spectra of the H2 and BrG lines. The calibrated\nvisibilities recorded at Ks and Lp bands suggest the presence of a partially\nresolved compact object of 30 mas at the core of IRS 9A, together with the\npresence of over-resolved flux. The spectroastrometric signal of the H2 line\nshows that this spectral feature proceeds from the large scale extended\nemission (300 mas) of IRS 9A, while the BrG line appears to be formed at the\ncore of the object (20 mas). This scenario is consistent with the brightness\ndistribution of the source for near- and mid-infrared wavelengths at various\nspatial scales. However, our model suffers from remaining inconsistencies\nbetween SED modelling and the interferometric data. Moreover, the BrG\nspectroastrometric signal indicates that the core of IRS 9A exhibits some form\nof complexity such as asymmetries in the disk.

Further, using the notion of transient\nknot, we define an integer-valued invariant of knots in $S^3$ that we call the\ntransient number. We then show that the union of the sets of knots of\nunknotting number one and tunnel number one is a proper subset of the set of\nknots of transient number one.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 14 figures; minor changes"]}]

The key challenge to realize\nthe RRDPS scheme lies on the measurement device, which requires a\nvariable-delay interferometer.

Our approach is\nbased on a mapping for opera- tors in Fock space that allows a compact and\nefficient application of the Hamiltonian and solution of the MCTDHF equations\nof motion. Our implementation extends, builds on and exploits the recursive\nimplementation of MCTDH for bosons (R-MCTDHB) package. Together with R-MCTDHB,\nthe present implementation of MCTDHF forms the MCTDH-X package. We benchmark\nthe accuracy of the algorithm with the harmonic interaction model and a\ntime-dependent generalization thereof. These models consider parabolically\ntrapped particles that interact through a harmonic interaction potential. We\ndemonstrate, that MCTDHF is capable of solving the time-dependent many-fermion\nSchr\\\"odinger equation to an in principle arbitrary degree of precision and can\nhence yield numerically exact results even in the case of Hamiltonians with\ntime-dependent one-body and two-body potentials. As an application we study the\nproblem of two initially parabolically confined and charged fermions tunneling\nthrough a barrier to open space. We demonstrate the validity of a model\nproposed previously for the many-body tunneling to open space of bosonic\nparticles with contact interactions [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 109,\n13521-13525 (2012)]. The many-fermion tunneling can be built up from\nsequentially happening single-fermion tunneling processes. The characteristic\nmomenta of these processes are determined by the chemical potentials of trapped\nsubsystems of smaller particle numbers: the escaped fermions convert the\ndifferent chemical potentials into kinetic energy. Using the two-body\ncorrelation function, we present a detailed picture of the sequentiality of the\nprocess and are able to tell tunneling from over-the-barrier escape.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 5 figures"]}]

The efficiency of the transport of angular momentum by waves\ndepends on their driving mechanism. While excitation by turbulence throughout\nthe convective zone has already been investigated, we know that penetrative\nconvection into the stably stratified radiative zone can also generate internal\ngravity waves. Therefore, we aim at developing a semianalytical model to\nestimate the generation of IGW by penetrative plumes below an upper convective\nenvelope. We derive the wave amplitude considering the pressure exerted by an\nensemble of plumes on the interface between the radiative and convective zones\nas source term in the equation of momentum. We consider the effect of a thermal\ntransition from a convective gradient to a radiative one on the transmission of\nthe wave into the radiative zone. The plume-induced wave energy flux at the top\nof the radiative zone is computed for a solar model and is compared to the\nturbulence-induced one.

We also investigate how well the gas-phase carbon abundance can\nbe determined in light of parameter uncertainties.\n  The CO$\\,6$--$5$ line is detected in $13$ out of $33$ sources, the\n[CI]$\\,1$--$0$ in $6$ out of $12$, and the [CI]$\\,2$--$1$ in $1$ out of $33$.\nWith deep integrations, the first unambiguous detections of [CI]~$1$--$0$ in\ndisks are obtained, in TW~Hya and HD~100546.\n  Gas-phase carbon abundance reductions of a factor $5$--$10$ or more can be\nidentified robustly based on CO and [CI] detections. The atomic carbon\ndetection in TW~Hya confirms a factor $100$ reduction of [C]/[H]$_{\\rm gas}$ in\nthat disk, while the data are consistent with an ISM-like carbon abundance for\nHD~100546. In addition, BP~Tau, T~Cha, HD~139614, HD~141569, and HD~100453 are\neither carbon-depleted or gas-poor disks. The low [CI]~$2$--$1$ detection rates\nin the survey mostly reflect insufficient sensitivity to detect T~Tauri disks.\nThe Herbig~Ae/Be disks with CO and [CII] upper limits below the models are\ndebris disk like systems. A roughly order of magnitude increase in sensitivity\ncompared to our survey is required to obtain useful constraints on the\ngas-phase [C]/[H] ratio in most of the targeted systems.\n","Comment: 8 figures, accepted for publication in A\\&A"]}]

Since the LOS velocities depend, in part, on the stellar rotation, the\nRM waveform is sensitive to the star-planet alignment (which provides\ninformation on the system's dynamical history). We present a new RM modelling\ntechnique that directly measures the spatially-resolved stellar spectrum behind\nthe planet. This is done by scaling the continuum flux of the (HARPS) spectra\nby the transit light curve, and then subtracting the in- from the\nout-of-transit spectra to isolate the starlight behind the planet. This\ntechnique does not assume any shape for the intrinsic local profiles. In it, we\nalso allow for differential stellar rotation and centre-to-limb variations in\nthe convective blueshift. We apply this technique to HD189733 and compare to 3D\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. We reject rigid body rotation with high\nconfidence (> 99% probability), which allows us to determine the occulted\nstellar latitudes and measure the stellar inclination. In turn, we determine\nboth the sky-projected (lambda ~ -0.4 +/- 0.2 degrees) and true 3D obliquity\n(psi ~ 7^+12_-4 degrees). We also find good agreement with the MHD simulations,\nwith no significant centre-to-limb variations detectable in the local profiles.\nHence, this technique provides a new powerful tool that can probe stellar\nphotospheres, differential rotation, determine 3D obliquities, and remove\nsky-projection biases in planet migration theories. This technique can be\nimplemented with existing instrumentation, but will become even more powerful\nwith the next generation of high-precision radial velocity spectrographs.\n","Comment: ~12 pages + 3 pages references/appendix, 8 figures + 2 appendix\n  figures, accepted to A&A"]}]

We investigate whether a significant decrease in polarized emission of\ndense regions in Bok globules is possible under certain physical conditions.\nFor instance, we evaluate the impact of optical depth effects and various\nproperties of the dust phase.\n  Methods. We use radiative transfer modelling to calculate the temperature\nstructure of an analytical Bok globule model and simulate the polarized thermal\nemission of elongated dust grains. For the alignment of the dust grains, we\nconsider a magnetic field and include radiative torque and internal alignment.\n  Results. Besides the usual explanations, selected conditions of the\ntemperature and density distribution, the dust phase and the magnetic field are\nalso able to significantly decrease the polarized emission of dense regions in\nBok globules. Taking submm/mm grains and typical column densities of existing\nBok globules into consideration, the optical depth is high enough to decrease\nthe degree of polarization by up to {\\Delta}P~10%.

Cascading information transmissions --- phone calls,\ntext messages, social media posts --- may be understood as a realization of a\ndiffusion process operating on the network, and its branching path can be\nrepresented by a directed tree. One important feature of dynamic real-world\ndiffusion processes is that the process may not traverse every edge in the\nnetwork on which it operates. When the network itself is unknown, the path of\nthe diffusion process may reveal some, but not all, of the edges connecting\nnodes that have received the diffusing information. The network\nreconstruction/inference problem is to estimate connections that are not\nrevealed by the diffusion processes. This problem naturally arises in a many\ndisciplines. Most of existing works on network reconstruction study this\nproblem by deriving a likelihood function for the realized diffusion process\ngiven full knowledge of the network on which it operates, and attempting to\nfind the network topology that maximizes this likelihood. The major challenge\nin this work is the intractability of the optimization problem.

This paper presents a\ndecision procedure for reasoning about algebraic data types using abstractions\nthat are provided by catamorphisms: fold functions that map instances of\nalgebraic data types to values in a decidable domain. We show that the\nprocedure is sound and complete for a class of catamorphisms that satisfy a\ngeneralized sufficient surjectivity condition.

We\nthen propose the categories of monotonic and associative catamorphisms, which\nwe argue provide a more intuitive inclusion test than the generalized\nsufficient surjectivity condition. We use these notions to address two open\nproblems from previous work: (1) we provide a bound, with respect to formula\nsize, on the number of unrollings necessary for completeness, showing that it\nis linear for monotonic catamorphisms and exponentially small for associative\ncatamorphisms, and (2) we demonstrate that associative catamorphisms can be\ncombined within a formula while preserving completeness.

Solar energetic particles observed in association with coronal mass\nejections (CMEs) are produced by the CME-driven shock waves. The acceleration\nof particles is considered to be due to diffusive shock acceleration (DSA).\nAims. We aim at a better understanding of DSA in the case of quasi-parallel\nshocks, in which self-generated turbulence in the shock vicinity plays a key\nrole. Methods. We have developed and applied a new Monte Carlo simulation code\nfor acceleration of protons in parallel coronal shocks. The code performs a\nself-consistent calculation of resonant interactions of particles with Alfv\\'en\nwaves based on the quasi-linear theory. In contrast to the existing Monte Carlo\ncodes of DSA, the new code features the full quasi-linear resonance condition\nof particle pitch-angle scattering. This allows us to take anisotropy of\nparticle pitch-angle scattering into account, while the older codes implement\nan approximate resonance condition leading to isotropic scattering.We performed\nsimulations with the new code and with an old code, applying the same initial\nand boundary conditions, and have compared the results provided by both codes\nwith each other, and with the predictions of the steady-state theory.
