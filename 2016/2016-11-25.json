The high degree of deuteration observed in some prestellar cores\ndepends on the ortho-to-para H2 ratio through the H3+ fractionation. Aims. We\nwant to constrain the ortho/para H2 ratio across the L183 prestellar core. This\nis mandatory to correctly describe the deuter- ation amplification phenomenon\nin depleted cores such as L183 and to relate the total (ortho+para) H2D+\nabundance to the sole ortho-H2D+ column density measurement. Methods. To\nconstrain this ortho/para H2 ratio and derive its profile, we make use of the\nN2D+ /N2H+ ratio and of the ortho-H2D+ observations performed across the\nprestellar core. We use two simple chemical models limited to an almost totally\ndepleted core description. New dissociative recombination and trihydrogen\ncation-dihydrogen reaction rates (including all isotopologues) are presented in\nthis paper and included in our models. Results. We estimate the H2D+ ortho/para\nratio in the L183 cloud, and constrain the H2 ortho/para ratio : we show that\nit is varying across the prestellar core by at least an order of magnitude\nbeing still very high (~0.1) in most of the cloud. Our time-dependent model\nindicates that the prestellar core is presumably older than 1.5-2 x 10^5 years\nbut that it may not be much older. We also show that it has reached its present\ndensity only recently and that its contraction from a uniform density cloud can\nbe constrained. Conclusions. A proper understanding of deuteration chemistry\ncannot be attained without taking into account the whole ortho/para family of\nmolecular hydrogen and trihydrogen cation isotopologues as their relations are\nof utmost importance in the global scheme. Tracing the ortho/para H2 ratio\nshould also give useful constraints on the dynamical evolution of prestellar\ncores.\n"]}]

Therefore, thanks to a general \"representer\ntheorem\", the solution of the learning problem is still a linear combination of\na kernel. Furthermore, a way to design these kernels is given.

This is\nanalogous to the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) mechanism in which the\nmetal's kF determines the interaction profile as a function of the distance.\nTuning kF and the interaction strength may lead to a variety of ordered phases,\nincluding a topological insulator and anomalous quantum-hall states with\ncomplex next-nearest-neighbor hopping, as in the Haldane and the Kane-Mele\nmodel. We estimate the required range of parameters needed for the topological\nstate and find that the Fermi vector of the metallic gate should be of the\norder of 3Pi/8a (with a being the graphene lattice constant). The net coupling\nbetween the layers, which includes screening in the metal, should be of the\norder of the honeycomb lattice bandwidth. This configuration should be most\neasily realized in a cold-atoms setting with two interacting Fermionic species.\n","Comment: 7 pages; 2 figures; Version 2 - added references; added an appendix\n  about screening"]}]

A set of computational\nparameters are hypothesized that will give a dose plan that meets dosimetric\ncriteria. A dose plan is computed using these parameters, and if any dosimetric\ncriteria are not met, the process is iterated until a suitable dose plan is\nfound. In this way, the dose distribution is controlled by abstract parameters.\nThe purpose of this study is to improve HDR brachytherapy planning by\ndeveloping a new approach that directly optimizes the dose distribution based\non dosimetric criteria.\n  Method: We develop Inverse Planning by Integer Program (IPIP), an\noptimization model for computing HDR brachytherapy dose plans and a fast\nheuristic for it. We used our heuristic to compute dose plans for 20 anonymized\nprostate cancer patient image data sets from our clinic database. Dosimetry was\nevaluated and compared to dosimetric criteria.\n  Results: Dose plans computed from IPIP satisfied all given dosimetric\ncriteria for the target and healthy tissue after a single iteration. The\naverage target coverage was 95%. The average computation time for IPIP was 30.1\nseconds on a Intel(R) CoreTM2 Duo CPU 1.67 GHz processor with 3 Gib RAM.\n  Conclusion: IPIP is an HDR brachytherapy planning system that directly\nincorporates dosimetric criteria. We have demonstrated that IPIP has clinically\nacceptable performance for the prostate cases and dosimetric criteria used in\nthis study, both in terms of dosimetry and runtime. Further study is required\nto determine if IPIP performs well for a more general group of patients and\ndosimetric criteria, including other cancer sites such as GYN.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 1 figure, for submission to Medical Physics Journal"]}]

We find that the high frequency noise\nis filtered by the output degradation process through time-averaging; while the\nlow frequency noise is damped by adaptation through negative feedback. Both\nfiltering processes themselves introduce intrinsic noises, which are found to\nbe unfiltered and can thus amount to a significant internal noise floor even\nwithout signaling. These results are applied to E. coli chemotaxis. We show\nunambiguously that the molecular mechanism for the Berg-Purcell time-averaging\nscheme is the dephosphorylation of the response regulator CheY-P, not the\nreceptor adaptation process as previously suggested. The high frequency noise\ndue to the stochastic ligand binding-unbinding events and the random ligand\nmolecule diffusion is averaged by the CheY-P dephosphorylation process to a\nnegligible level in E.coli. We identify a previously unstudied noise source\ncaused by the random motion of the cell in a ligand gradient. We show that this\nrandom walk induced signal noise has a divergent low frequency component, which\nis only rendered finite by the receptor adaptation process. For gradients\nwithin the E. coli sensing range, this dominant external noise can be\ncomparable to the significant intrinsic noise in the system.

In the copper-oxide high temperature superconductors\n(HTSCs), a strongly anisotropic energy gap, which vanishes along high symmetry\ndirections, is a clear manifestation of the d-wave symmetry of the pairing.\nThere is, however, a dramatic change in the form of the gap anisotropy with\nreduced carrier concentration (underdoping). Although the vanishing of the gap\nalong the diagonal to the square Cu-O bond directions is robust, the doping\ndependence of the large gap along the Cu-O directions suggests that its origin\nmight be different from pairing. It is thus tempting to associate the large gap\nwith a second order parameter distinct from superconductivity. We use\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to show that the two-gap\nbehavior, and the destruction of well defined electronic excitations, are not\nuniversal features of HTSCs, and depend sensitively on how the underdoped\nmaterials are prepared. Depending on cation substitution, underdoped samples\neither show two-gap behavior or not. In contrast, many other characteristics of\nHTSCs, such as the domelike dependence of Tc on doping, long-lived excitations\nalong the diagonals to the Cu-O bonds, energy gap at the antinode (crossing of\nthe underlying Fermi surface and the (pi, 0)-(pi, pi) line) decreasing\nmonotonically with doping, while persisting above Tc (the pseudogap), are\npresent in all samples, irrespective of whether they exhibit two-gap behavior\nor not.

An interesting special case, that\nmay prove use- ful to tackling the general problem, is the\ndiagonal-intersecting case, in which the given family of rectangles is\nintersected by a diagonal. Indeed, Chepoi and Felsner recently gave a factor 6\napproximation algorithm for MHS in this setting, and showed that the duality\ngap is between 3/2 and 6. In this paper we improve upon these results. First we\nshow that MIS in diagonal-intersecting families is NP-complete, providing one\nsmallest subclass for which MIS is provably hard. Then, we derive an\n$O(n^2)$-time algorithm for the maximum weight independent set when, in\naddition the rectangles intersect below the diagonal. This improves and extends\na classic result of Lubiw, and amounts to obtain a 2-approximation algo- rithm\nfor the maximum weight independent set of rectangles intersecting a diagonal.\nFinally, we prove that for diagonal-intersecting families the duality gap is\nbetween 2 and 4.

We show that the Curie temperature of\nAl1-xCrxN for x = 0.027 is greater than 900 K.\n","Comment: Submitted to APL"]}]

In this setup,\ncharacterization and classification problems lead to the natural question:\n\"Given two points on X, how many minimal degree rational curve are there which\ncontain those points?\". A recent answer to this question led to a number of new\nresults in classification theory. As an infinitesimal analogue, we ask \"How\nmany minimal degree rational curves exist which contain a prescribed tangent\nvector?\"\n  In this paper, we give sufficient conditions which guarantee that every\ntangent vector at a general point of X is contained in at most one rational\ncurve minimal degree. As an immediate application, we obtain irreducibility\ncriteria for the space of minimal rational curves.\n","Comment: The main theorems were improved; they now work for families of\n  rational curves that are not necessarily irreducible. For this, it was\n  necessary to change the proofs and the exposition substantially.
