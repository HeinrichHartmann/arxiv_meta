Due to the randomness in the\nalgorithm, there is a natural tradeoff between statistical performance and\ncomputational cost. On one hand, as $t$ increases, the (random) prediction\nerror of the ensemble tends to decrease and stabilize. On the other hand,\nlarger ensembles require greater computational cost for training and making new\npredictions.\n  The present work offers a new approach for quantifying this tradeoff: Given a\nfixed training set $\\mathcal{D}$, let the random variables $\\text{Err}_{t,0}$\nand $\\text{Err}_{t,1}$ denote the class-wise prediction error rates of a\nrandomly generated ensemble of size $t$. As $t\\to\\infty$, we provide a general\nbound on the \"algorithmic variance\",\n$\\text{var}(\\text{Err}_{t,l}|\\mathcal{D})\\leq\n\\frac{f_l(1/2)^2}{4t}+o(\\frac{1}{t})$, where $l\\in\\{0,1\\}$, and $f_l$ is a\ndensity function that arises from the ensemble method. Conceptually, this\nresult is somewhat surprising, because\n$\\text{var}(\\text{Err}_{t,l}|\\mathcal{D})$ describes how $\\text{Err}_{t,l}$\nvaries over repeated runs of the algorithm, and yet, the formula leads to a\nmethod for bounding $\\text{var}(\\text{Err}_{t,l}|\\mathcal{D})$ with a single\nensemble. The bound is also sharp in the sense that it is attained by an\nexplicit family of randomized classifiers. With regard to the task of\nestimating $f_l(1/2)$, the presence of the ensemble leads to a unique twist on\nthe classical setup of non-parametric density estimation --- wherein the\neffects of sample size and computational cost are intertwined. In particular,\nwe propose an estimator for $f_l(1/2)$, and derive an upper bound on its MSE\nthat matches \"standard optimal non-parametric rates\" when $t$ is sufficiently\nlarge.\n","Comment: 28 pages.

These applications are based on the\nfundamental fact that the Teichm\\\"uller flow and the Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle\nwork as \\emph{renormalization dynamics} for interval exchange transformations\nand translation flows.\n  In the second part, i.e., from Sections 6 to 9, we start by pointing out that\nit is interesting to study the ergodic properties of the Kontsevich-Zorich\ncocycle with respect to invariant measures other than the Masur-Veech ones, in\nview of potential applications to the investigation of billiards in rational\npolygons (for instance). We then study some examples of measures for which the\nergodic properties of the Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle are very different from the\ncase of Masur-Veech measures. Finally, we end these notes by constructing some\nexamples of closed SL(2,R)-orbits such that the restriction of the\nTeichm\\\"uller flow to them has arbitrary small rate of exponential mixing, or,\nequivalently, the naturally associated unitary SL(2,R)-representations have\narbitrarily small spectral gap (and in particular it has complementary series).\n","Comment: 157 pages, 67 figures.

Semantic acyclicity has been studied in the constraint-free case,\nand deciding whether a query enjoys this property is NP-complete. However, in\ncase the database is subject to constraints such as tuple-generating\ndependencies (tgds) that can express, e.g., inclusion dependencies, or\nequality-generating dependencies (egds) that capture, e.g., functional\ndependencies, a CQ may turn out to be semantically acyclic under the\nconstraints while not semantically acyclic in general. This opens avenues to\nnew query optimization techniques. In this paper we initiate and develop the\ntheory of semantic acyclicity under constraints. More precisely, we study the\nfollowing natural problem: Given a CQ and a set of constraints, is the query\nsemantically acyclic under the constraints, or, in other words, is the query\nequivalent to an acyclic one over all those databases that satisfy the set of\nconstraints? We show that, contrary to what one might expect, decidability of\nCQ containment is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the decidability\nof semantic acyclicity. In particular, we show that semantic acyclicity is\nundecidable in the presence of full tgds (i.e., Datalog rules). In view of this\nfact, we focus on the main classes of tgds for which CQ containment is\ndecidable, and do not capture the class of full tgds, namely guarded,\nnon-recursive and sticky tgds. For these classes we show that semantic\nacyclicity is decidable, and its complexity coincides with the complexity of CQ\ncontainment. In the case of egds, we show that for keys over unary and binary\npredicates semantic acyclicity is decidable (NP-complete). We finally consider\nthe problem of evaluating a semantically acyclic query over a database that\nsatisfies a set of constraints; for guarded tgds and functional dependencies\nthis problem is tractable.\n"]}]

We study cascades\nunder the threshold model on sparse random graphs with community structure to\nsee whether the existence of communities affects the number of individuals who\nfinally adopt the new behavior. Specifically, we consider the permanent\nadoption model where nodes that have adopted the new behavior cannot change\ntheir state. When seeding a small number of agents with the new behavior, the\ncommunity structure has little effect on the final proportion of people that\nadopt it, i.e., the contagion threshold is the same as if there were just one\ncommunity. On the other hand, seeding a fraction of population with the new\nbehavior has a significant impact on the cascade with the optimal seeding\nstrategy depending on how strongly the communities are connected. In\nparticular, when the communities are strongly connected, seeding in one\ncommunity outperforms the symmetric seeding strategy that seeds equally in all\ncommunities.\n","Comment: Version to be published to EC 2016"]}]

Score tests are developed to first test for\nthe existence of a latent process and, subsequent to that, evidence of serial\ndependence in that latent process. The test for the existence of a latent\nprocess is important because, if one is present, standard logistic regression\nmethods will produce inconsistent estimates of the regression parameters.\nHowever the score test is non-standard and any serial dependence in the latent\nprocess will require consideration of nuisance parameters which cannot be\nestimated under the null hypothesis of no latent process. The paper describes\nhow a supremum-type test can be applied. If a latent process is detected,\nconsistent estimation of its variance and the regression parameters can be done\nusing marginal estimation which is easily implemented using generalised linear\nmixed model methods. The test for serial dependence in a latent process does\nnot involve nuisance parameters and is based on the covariances between\nresiduals centered at functions of the latent process conditional on the\nobservations. This requires numerical integration in order to compute the test\nstatistic. Relevant asymptotic results are derived and confirmed using\nsimulation evidence. Application to binary and binomial time series is made.\nFor binary series in particular, a complication is that the variance of the\nlatent process, even if present, can be estimated to be zero with a high\nprobability.\n","Comment: 12 page, 3 table, submitted for publication"]}]

Two categories of visual stimuli were analysed in this study:\nimmobile and mobile. Networks similarity was assessed within each category\n(intra-condition) and between categories (inter-condition). Results showed high\nsimilarity within each category and low similarity between the two categories.\nA significant difference between similarities computed in the intra and\ninter-conditions was observed at the period of 120-190ms supposed to be related\nto visual recognition and memory access.

In this vector-like model, there is no strong-CP problem,\nthere are no anomalies, fermion number is conserved, and heavy mirror fermions\nform heavy neutral mirror atoms that are dark-matter candidates. The\npseudoscalar field whose mean value breaks parity could have a mass of 750 GeV\nand decay into two photons.
