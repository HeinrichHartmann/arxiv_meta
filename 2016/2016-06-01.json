Localizing an\narbitrary triangulated $C$ by a set $S$ of morphisms in the heart of a weight\nstructure $w$ for it one obtains a triangulated category endowed with a weight\nstructure $w'$. The heart of $w'$ is a certain idempotent completion of the\nnon-commutative localization of the heart of $w$ by $S$. The latter is the\nnatural categorical version of Cohn's localizations of rings i.e. the functor\nconnecting hearts is universal among all the additive functors that make the\nelements of $S$ invertible. In particular, taking $C=K^b(A)$ for an additive\n$A$ we obtain a very efficient tool for computing the additive localization of\n$A$ by $S$; using it, we generalize the calculations of Gerasimov and\nMalcolmson.\n  We apply our results to certain categories of birational motives over a base\nscheme $U$ (generalizing those defined by Kahn and Sujatha).

Here we\novercome this power broadening regime and demonstrate the longest coherence at\nexciton saturation where the detection count rates are highest. We detect\nsingle-photon count rates of 460,000 counts per second under pulsed laser\nexcitation while maintaining a single-photon purity of greater than 99%.\nImportantly, the enhanced coherence is attained with quantum dots in ultraclean\nwurtzite InP nanowires, where the surrounding charge traps are filled by\nexciting above the wurtzite InP nanowire bandgap. By raising the excitation\nintensity, the number of possible charge configurations in the quantum dot\nenvironment is reduced, resulting in a narrower emission spectrum. Via Monte\nCarlo simulations we explain the observed narrowing of the emission spectrum\nwith increasing power.

Simple arguments suggest that a scenario of supernova\nremnants (SNRs) in the Milky Way as the dominant sources for the cosmic ray\npopulation below the knee could work: in a generic calculation, it can be shown\nthat these objects can provide the energy budget necessary to explain the\nobserved flux of cosmic rays. However, this argument is based on the assumption\nthat all sources behave in the same way, i.e.\\ they all have the same energy\nbudget, spectral behavior and maximum energy. In this paper, we investigate if\na realistic population of SNRs is capable of producing the cosmic ray flux as\nit is observed below the knee. We use 21 SNRs that are well-studied from radio\nwavelengths up to gamma-ray energies. It could be shown previously (Mandelartz\n& Becker Tjus 2015) that the high-energy bump in the energy spectrum of these\n21 sources can be dominated by hadronic emission. Here, gamma-rays are produced\nvia $\\pi^{0}-$decays from cosmic ray interactions in molecular clouds near the\nsupernova remnant, which serves as the cosmic ray accelerator. The cosmic ray\nspectra show a large variety in their energy budget, spectral behavior and\nmaximum energy. These sources are assumed to be representative for the total\nclass of SNRs, where we assume that about 100 - 200 cosmic ray emitting SNRs\nshould be present today. Finally, we use these source spectra to simulate the\ncosmic ray transport from individual SNRs in the Galaxy with the GALPROP code\nfor cosmic ray propagation. We find that the cosmic ray budget can be matched\nwell for a diffusion coefficient that is close to $D\\propto E^{0.3}$. A\nstronger dependence on the energy, e.g. $E^{0.5}$, would lead to a spectrum at\nEarth that is too steep when compared to what is detected and the energy budget\ncannot be matched, in particular toward high energies.\n","Comment: 43 pages, 7 figures"]}]

From the vertex function we\nextract the effective quark-gluon coupling and show that it grows with\nincreasing magnetic field strength. The effect is due to a subtle competition\nbetween the color charge associated to gluons and the color charge associated\nto quarks, the former being larger than the latter. In contrast, at high\ntemperature the effective thermo-magnetic coupling results exclusively from the\ncontribution of the color charge associated to quarks. This produces a decrease\nof the coupling with increasing field strength. We interpret the results in\nterms of a geometrical effect whereby the magnetic field induces, on average, a\ncloser distance between the (electrically charged) quarks and antiquarks. At\nhigh temperature, since the effective coupling is proportional only to the\ncolor charge associated to quarks, such proximity with increasing field\nstrength makes the effective coupling decrease due to asymptotic freedom. In\nturn, this leads to a decreasing quark condensate. In contrast, at zero\ntemperature both the effective strong coupling and the quark condensate\nincrease with increasing magnetic field. This is due to the color charge\nassociated to gluons dominating over that associated to quarks, with both\nhaving the opposite sign. Thus, the gluons induce a kind of screening of the\nquark color charge, in spite of the quark-antiquark proximity.

The dependence between\nvelocity dispersion, radius and clouds surface density found by Heyer et al.\n(2009), $\\sigma/R^{1/2}\\propto \\Sigma^{1/2}$, has been interpreted in terms of\nglobal collapse of clouds. In this work we demonstrate that this relation is an\nexpression of a more general relation between accelerations.

We also introduce a new coefficient, the\nforce partition coefficient $\\alpha_{for}$ which is equivalent to the virial\nparameter but does not distinguish between collapsing and non-collapsing\nregions. In this work we use the a$_k$ - a$_G$ formalism in the analysis of a\nnew sample of 16 massive starless clumps (MSCls) combined with data from the\nliterature. We show that a$_k$ and a$_G$ are not independent. The non-thermal\nmotions in each region can originate from both local turbulence and\nself-gravity but overall the data in the a$_k$ vs. a$_G$ diagram demonstrate\nthat the majority of the non-thermal motions originate from self-gravity. We\nfurther show that all the MSCls with $\\Sigma\\geq 0.1$ g cm$^{-2}$ show signs of\ninfall motions, a strong indication that the denser regions are the first to\ncollapse.

Typically, the system evolves\ninto a steady state in the long-time limit, which features an oscillating\nmomentum distribution and a stationary condensate fraction which is dependent\non the quench parameters. We investigate how different quench parameters such\nas the inter- and intra-species interactions and the spin-orbit-coupling\nparameters affect the condensate fraction in the steady state. Furthermore, we\nfind that the time average of the oscillatory momentum distribution in the\nlong-time limit can be described by a generalized Gibbs ensemble with two\nbranches of momentum-dependent Gibbs temperatures.

In any single pulsar, a stochastic gravitational wave signal appears as\nan additional source of timing noise that can be absorbed by the noise model,\nand so it is only by considering the coherent response across a network of\npulsars that the signal can be distinguished from other sources of noise. In\nthe limit where there are many gravitational wave sources in the sky, or many\npulsars in the array, the signals produce a unique tensor correlation pattern\nthat depends only on the angular separation between each pulsar pair. It is\nthis distinct fingerprint that is used to search for gravitational waves using\npulsar timing arrays. Here we consider how the prospects for detection are\ndiminished when the statistical isotropy of the timing array or the\ngravitational wave signal is broken by having a finite number of pulsars and a\nfinite number of sources.

The\npairing amplitude remains s-wave like, without significant spatial modulation,\nwhile the magnetic phase evolves from a ferromagnet, through non-collinear\n`spiral' states, to a Neel state with increasing density and magnetic coupling.\nWe find that at intermediate magnetic coupling the\nantiferromagnetic-superconducting state is gapless, except for the regime of\nNeel order. We map out the phase diagram in terms of density, magnetic coupling\nand attractive interaction, establish the electron dispersion and effective\n`Fermi surface' in the ground state, provide an estimate of the magnetic and\nsuperconducting temperature scales via Monte Carlo, and compare our results to\navailable data on the borocarbides.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 13 figures"]}]

These old recordings together with published and new data show that for\nat least half a century the star was in a low luminosity state, with B ~18.\nAfter 1960, five large variability cycles of visual luminosity were recorded.\nThe amplitude of the oscillations was seen increasing towards the 1992-1994\nmaximum, then decreasing during the last maxima. The recent light curve\nindicates that the photometric variations have been quite similar in all the\nbands, and that the B-V color index has been constant within +/-0.1 m despite\nthe 1.5m change of the visual luminosity. The spectrum of GR 290 at the large\nmaximum of 1992-94, was equivalent to late-B type, while, during 2002-2014, it\nhas varied between WN10h-11h near the visual maxima to WN8h-9h at the\nluminosity minima.

Polarization measurements were used to obtain a robust constraint\non the magnetic inclination angle of less than 35 deg. Two distinct emission\nmodes are discovered to be operating, with periodic subpulse modulation being\npresent only during the weaker mode. Despite the variability of the modulation\ncycle and interruption by mode-changes, the modulation pattern responsible for\nthe bi-drifting is strictly phase locked over a timescale of years such that\nthe variability is identical in the different components. The phase locking\nimplies that a single physical origin is responsible for both drift directions.\nPhase locking is hard to explain for many models, including those specifically\nproposed in the literature to explain bi-drifting, and they are therefore shown\nto be implausible.

Our key motivation for building such a\nsolver is the observation that existing string solvers are not efficient at\nmodeling the string/bit-vector combination. Current approaches either reduce\nstrings to bit-vectors and use a bit-vector solver as a backend, or model\nbit-vectors as natural numbers and use a solver for the combined theory of\nstrings and natural numbers. Both these approaches are inefficient for\ndifferent reasons. Modeling strings as bit-vectors destroys structure inherent\nin string equations thus missing opportunities for efficiently deciding such\nformulas, and modeling bit-vectors as natural numbers is known to be\ninefficient. Hence, there is a clear need for a solver that models strings and\nbit-vectors natively.\n  Our solver Z3strBV is a decision procedure for the theory $T_{w,bv}$\ncombining solvers for bit-vector and string equations. We demonstrate\nexperimentally that Z3strBV is significantly more efficient than reduction of\nstring/bit-vector constraints to strings/natural numbers.

Both sequences were\nobserved during very similar seasonal and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)\nconditions, though with differing solar wind speed. A key observation is that\nthe signatures differed considerably in their local time extent. The two\nperiods are 26 August 1998, when the IMF had components\n$\\mathit{B}_{\\mathit{z}}$ $\\approx$ -10 nT and $\\mathit{B}_{\\mathit{y}}$\n$\\approx$ 9 nT and the solar wind speed was $\\mathit{V}_{\\mathit{x}}$ $\\approx$\n650 km $s^{-1}$, and 31 August 2005, IMF $\\mathit{B}_{\\mathit{z}}$ $\\approx$ -7\nnT, $\\mathit{B}_{\\mathit{y}}$ $\\approx$ 17 nT, and $\\mathit{V}_{\\mathit{x}}$\n$\\approx$ 380 km $s^{-1}$.

This mapping does not\npreserve tensor character leaving significant room for error as stress and\nstrain quantities follow from different mappings and thus have to be treated\ndifferently in certain mathematical operations.

An alternative is the\nso-called Kelvin mapping which has recently gained recognition in studies of\ntheoretical mechanics. This article is concerned with benefits of the Kelvin\nmapping in numerical modelling tools such as finite element software. The\ndecisive difference to the Voigt mapping is that Kelvin's method preserves\ntensor character, and thus the numerical matrix notation directly corresponds\nto the original tensor notation. Further benefits in numerical implementations\nare that tensor norms are calculated identically without distinguishing stress\nor strain-type quantities and tensor equations can be directly transformed into\nmatrix equations without additional considerations.

However, the computation of these\nnetwork motif statistics via naive enumeration is infeasible for either its\nprohibitive computational costs or access restrictions on the full graph data.\nMethods to estimate the motif statistics based on random walks by sampling only\na small fraction of the subgraphs in the large graph address both of these\nchallenges. In this paper, we present a new algorithm, called the Waddling\nRandom Walk (WRW), which is significantly faster than the best of previously\nknown algorithms. It derives its name from the fact that it sways a little to\nthe left and to the right, thus also sampling nodes not directly on the path of\nthe random walk. The WRW algorithm achieves its computational efficiency by not\ntrying to enumerate subgraphs around the random walk but instead using a\nrandomized protocol to sample subgraphs in the neighborhood of the nodes\nvisited by the walk. In addition, WRW achieves significantly higher accuracy\n(measured by the closeness of its estimate to the correct value) and higher\nprecision (measured by the low variance in its estimations) than the current\nstate-of-the-art algorithms.
