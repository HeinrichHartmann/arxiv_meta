These are perhaps more evident for\nthe case of nanodot patterns on amorphizable targets than for the case of\nnanoripples due, possibly, to the relative novelty of the former. The pattern\nproperties to be considered are those of potential increased technological\nimportance, such as the variation of nanodot size with parameters like ion\nenergy, target temperature and sputtering time (i.e., fluence), as well as the\nconditions under which the quality of the pattern order is enhanced, issues\nsuch as wavelength coarsening and order enhancement becoming relevant.\n","Comment: To appear in Lecture Notes on Nanoscale Science and Technology,\n  edited by Z.

Indeed, Zanuttini has suggested that\nthe class of affine Boolean functions could be useful in knowledge compilation\nand has presented an affine approximation algorithm.

At some point during the collapse, a disk is formed around the\nprotostar and the disk will spin up and grow in size as the core contracts\nbecause of angular momentum conservation. The question is how early the disk\nformation process occurs. In this paper we aim to characterize the kinematical\nstate of a deeply embedded, Class 0 young stellar object, NGC1333-IRAS2A, based\non high angular resolution (< 1$''$ $\\approx$ 200 AU) interferometric\nobservations of HCN and H$^{13}$CN J = 4-3 from the Submillimeter Array, and\ntest whether a circumstellar disk can be detected based on gas kinematic\nfeatures. We adopt a physical model which has been shown to describe the object\nwell and obtain a fit of a parameterized model of the velocity field, using a\ntwo-dimensional axis-symmetric radiation transfer code. The parameterization\nand fit to the high angular resolution data characterize the central dynamical\nmass and the ratio of infall velocity to rotation velocity. We find a large\namount of infall and very little rotation on all scales. The central object has\na relatively low mass of 0.25 M$_\\odot$ . As an object with a low stellar mass\ncompared to the envelope mass, we conclude that NGC1333-IRAS2A is consistent\nwith the suggestion that, as a Class 0 object, it represents the earliest\nstages of star formation. The large amount of infall relative to rotation also\nsuggests that this is a young object. We do however find the need of a central\ncompact component on scales of a few hundred AU based on the continuum data,\nwhich suggests that disk formation happens shortly after the initial\ngravitational collapse. The data do not reveal a distinct velocity field for\nthis 0.1 M$_\\odot$ component.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

In particular, this work is\ndevoted to the determination of the internal metallicity of this star, linked\nwith its $\\lambda$ Bootis nature, and its age, taking the advantage of its\n$\\gamma$ Doradus-type pulsations. To do so we have used the equilibrium code\nCESAM and the non-adiabatic pulsational code GraCo.

Therefore, in sight of these new results, a revision of this\nhypothesis is needed. The inclusion of accurate internal chemical mixing is\nnecessary. The use of the asteroseismological constraints provides a very\naccurate determination of the physical characteristics of HR\\,8799: an age in\nthe ranges [1123, 1625] and [26, 430] Myr, and a mass in the ranges [1.32,\n1.33] and [1.44, 1.45] $M_{\\odot}$, respectively, depending on the visual angle\n$i$. The determination of this angle and more accurate multicolor photometric\nobservations can definitively fix the mass, metallicity and age of this star.\nIn particular, an accurate age estimation is needed for a correct understanding\nof the planetary system.

These\nactions modify an election's participation structure and aim at either making a\nfavorite candidate win (\"constructive control\") or prevent a despised candidate\nfrom winning (\"destructive control\"), which yields a total of 22 standard\ncontrol scenarios. To protect elections from such control attempts,\ncomputational complexity has been used to show that electoral control, though\nnot impossible, is computationally prohibitive. Among natural voting systems\nwith a polynomial-time winner problem, the two systems with the highest number\nof proven resistances to control types (namely 19 out of 22) are\n\"sincere-strategy preference-based approval voting\" (SP-AV, a modification of a\nsystem proposed by Brams and Sanver) and fallback voting. Both are hybrid\nsystems; e.g., fallback voting combines approval with Bucklin voting. In this\npaper, we study the control complexity of Bucklin voting itself and show that\nit behaves equally well in terms of control resistance for the 20 cases\ninvestigated so far. As Bucklin voting is a special case of fallback voting,\nall resistances shown for Bucklin voting in this paper strengthen the\ncorresponding resistance for fallback voting.\n","Comment: 20 pages"]}]

We\nhave used Herschel's HIFI instrument in dual beam switch mode to observe the\n1232.4762 GHz J = 1 - 0 HF transition in the upper sideband of the band 5a\nreceiver. We detected foreground absorption by HF toward both sources over a\nwide range of velocities. Optically thin absorption components were detected on\nboth sight lines, allowing us to measure - as opposed to obtain a lower limit\non - the column density of HF for the first time. As in previous observations\nof HF toward the source G10.6-0.4, the derived HF column density is typically\ncomparable to that of water vapor, even though the elemental abundance of\noxygen is greater than that of fluorine by four orders of magnitude. We used\nthe rather uncertain N(CH)-N(H2) relationship derived previously toward diffuse\nmolecular clouds to infer the molecular hydrogen column density in the clouds\nexhibiting HF absorption. Within the uncertainties, we find that the abundance\nof HF with respect to H2 is consistent with the theoretical prediction that HF\nis the main reservoir of gas-phase fluorine for these clouds. Thus, hydrogen\nfluoride has the potential to become an excellent tracer of molecular hydrogen,\nand provides a sensitive probe of clouds of small H2 column density. Indeed,\nthe observations of hydrogen fluoride reported here reveal the presence of a\nlow column density diffuse molecular cloud along the W51 sight line, at an LSR\nvelocity of ~ 24kms-1, that had not been identified in molecular absorption\nline studies prior to the launch of Herschel.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures, A&A Letter special issue, accepted on 07/13/2010"]}]

Balmer-line fits and ionization equlibria give a relation\nbetween Teff, and log(g). Abundance anomalies and uncertain reddening preclude\nthe use of spectral type or photometry to fix Teff. Excitation temperatures are\nused to break the degeneracy between Teff and log(g).\n  Results: Strong lines are subject to an anomalous saturation that cannot be\nremoved by assuming a low microturbulence. By restricting the analysis to weak\n(<= 20 m[A]) lines, we find consistent results for neutral and ionized species,\nbased on a model with Teff = 8300K, and log(g)=3.8. The photosphere is depleted\nin the most refractory elements, while volatiles are normal or, in the case of\nnitrogen, overabundant with respect to the sun. The anomalies are unlike those\nof Ap or Am stars.\n  Conclusions: We suggest the anomalous saturation of strong lines arises from\nheating of the upper atmospheric layers by infalling material from a disk. The\noverall abundance pattern may be related to those found for the Lambda Boo\nstars, though the depletions of the refractory elements are milder, more like\nthose of Vega. However, the intermediate volatile zinc is depleted, precluding\na straightforward interpretation of the abundance pattern in terms of gas-grain\nseparation.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics; 7 pages, 7\n  figs., 2 tables"]}]

One of the established methods for achieving this is to iteratively\nmaximize a likelihood function (ML), which requires initialization with an\napproximate solution to avoid convergence towards local extrema. This paper\ndevelops methods for handling both Gaussian and Laplacian noise, the latter\nmodeling the presence of outliers in some practical ranging systems that\nadversely affect the performance of localization algorithms designed for\nGaussian noise. A modified Euclidean Distance Matrix (EDM) completion problem\nis solved for a block of target range measurements to approximately set up\ninitial sensor/target positions, and the likelihood function is then\niteratively refined through Majorization-Minimization (MM). To avoid the\ncomputational burden of repeatedly solving increasingly large EDM problems in\ntime-recursive operation an incremental scheme is exploited whereby a new\ntarget/node position is estimated from previously available node/target\nlocations to set up the iterative ML initial point for the full spatial\nconfiguration. The above methods are first derived under Gaussian noise\nassumptions, and modifications for Laplacian noise are then considered.\nAnalytically, the main challenges to be overcome in the Laplacian case stem\nfrom the non-differentiability of $\\ell_1$ norms that arise in the various cost\nfunctions. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithms\nsignificantly outperform existing methods for SLAT in the presence of outliers,\nwhile offering comparable performance for Gaussian noise.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 9 figures, submitted to IEEE transactions on signal\n  processing"]}]

The metabolic network of any one organism is encoded by a\nmetabolic genotype, defined by a set of enzyme-coding genes whose products\ncatalyze the network's reactions. Each metabolic genotype has a metabolic\nphenotype, such as the ability to synthesize biomass on a spectrum of different\nsources of chemical elements and energy. We here focus on sulfur metabolism,\nwhich is attractive to study the evolution of metabolic networks, because it\ninvolves many fewer reactions than carbon metabolism. Specifically, we study\nproperties of the space of all possible metabolic genotypes, and analyze\nproperties of random metabolic genotypes that are viable on different numbers\nof sulfur sources. We show that metabolic genotypes with the same phenotype\nform large connected genotype networks that extend far through metabolic\ngenotype space. How far they reach through this space is a linear function of\nthe number of super-essential reactions in such networks, the number of\nreactions that occur in all networks with the same phenotype. We show that\ndifferent neighborhoods of any genotype network harbor very different novel\nphenotypes, metabolic innovations that can sustain life on novel sulfur\nsources. We also analyze the ability of evolving populations of metabolic\nnetworks to explore novel metabolic phenotypes. This ability is facilitated by\nthe existence of genotype networks, because different neighborhoods of these\nnetworks contain very different novel phenotypes.

(...)\nWe construct a numerical SSP-model, with an underlying Salpeter IMF, valid\nwithin an upper $m_u$ and lower $m_l$ stellar mass range, and with total masses\n$M_c=10^2...10^4\\,m_\\odot$ typical of open clusters. We assume that the mass\nloss from a cluster is provided by mass loss from evolved stars and by the\ndynamical evaporation of low-mass members due to two-body relaxation. The data\nfor the latter process were scaled to the models from high-resolution N-body\ncalculations. We also investigate how a change of the $m_l$-limit influences\nmagnitudes and colours of clusters of a given mass and derive a necessary\ncondition for a luminosity and colour flash. The discreteness of the IMF leads\nto bursts in magnitude and colour of model clusters at moments when red\nsupergiants or giants appear and then die. The amplitude of the burst depends\non the cluster mass and on the spectral range; it is strongly increased in the\nNIR compared to optical passbands. In the discrete case, variations of the\nparameter $m_l$ are able to substantially change the magnitude-age and\n$M/L$-age relations. For the colours, the lowering of $m_l$ considerably\namplifies the discreteness effect. The influence of dynamical mass loss on\ncolour and magnitude is weak, although it provides a change of the slopes of\nthe considered relations, improving their agreement with observations. For the\nGalactic open clusters we determined luminosity and tidal mass independent of\neach other. The derived mass-to-luminosity ratio shows, on average, an increase\nwith cluster age in the optical, but gradually declines with age in the NIR.\nThe observed flash statistics can be used to constrain $m_l$ in open clusters.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy and\n  Astrophysics"]}]

In the light curve, eclipses are clearly seen, with the deepest\noccurring when the compact white dwarf crosses the disc of the sdB (0.4%) and\nthe more shallow ones (0.1%) when the sdB eclipses the white dwarf. As\nexpected, the sdB is deformed by the gravitational field of the white dwarf,\nwhich produces an ellipsoidal modulation of the light curve. Spectacularly, a\nvery strong Doppler beaming (aka Doppler boosting) effect is also clearly\nevident at the 0.1% level. This originates from the sdB's orbital velocity,\nwhich we measure to be 164.0\\pm1.9 km/s from supporting spectroscopy. We\npresent light curve models that account for all these effects, as well as\ngravitational lensing. We derive system parameters and uncertainties from the\nlight curve using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. Adopting a theoretical\nwhite dwarf mass-radius relation, the mass of the subdwarf is found to be\n0.47\\pm0.03 Msun and the mass of the white dwarf 0.59\\pm0.02 Msun. The\neffective temperature of the white dwarf is 15 900\\pm300K. With a spectroscopic\neffective temperature of Teff = 34 730\\pm250K and a surface gravity of log g =\n5.43\\pm0.04, the sdB is in a shell He burning stage. The detection of Doppler\nbeaming in Kepler light curves potentially allows one to measure radial\nvelocities without the need of spectroscopic data. For the first time, a\nphotometrically observed Doppler beaming amplitude is compared to a\nspectroscopically established value. The sdB's radial velocity amplitude\nderived from the photometry 168\\pm4 km/s is in perfect agreement with the\nspectroscopic value.

Such\ncoding has many applications in science and engineering and is believed to play\nan important role in neural information processing.

As new results show, under particular\nconditions there exist efficient solutions by minimizing the magnitude of the\ncoefficients (`$l_1$-norm') instead of minimizing the size of the active subset\nof features (`$l_0$-norm'). Straightforward neural implementation of these\nsolutions is not likely, as they require \\emph{a priori} knowledge of the\nnumber of active features. Furthermore, these methods utilize iterative\nre-evaluation of the reconstruction error, which in turn implies that final\nsparse forms (featuring `population sparseness') can only be reached through\nthe formation of a series of non-sparse representations, which is in contrast\nwith the overall sparse functioning of the neural systems (`lifetime\nsparseness').

Aim: Here we use the afterglow detection statistics of\nthe systematic follow-up observations performed with GROND since mid-2007 in\norder to derive the fraction of \"dark bursts\" according to different methods,\nand to distinguish between various scenarios for \"dark bursts\". Method:\nObservations were performed with the 7-channel \"Gamma-Ray Optical and\nNear-infrared Detector\" (GROND) at the 2.2m MPI/ESO telescope. We used the\nafterglow detection rate in dependence on the delay time between GRB and the\nfirst GROND exposure. Results: For long-duration Swift bursts with a detected\nX-ray afterglow, we achieve a 90% (35/39) detection rate of optical/NIR\nafterglows whenever our observations started within less than 240\\,min after\nthe burst. Complementing our GROND data with Swift/XRT spectra we construct\nbroad-band spectral energy distributions and derive rest-frame extinctions. e\ndetect 25-40% \"dark bursts\", depending on the definition used. The faint\noptical afterglow emission of \"dark bursts\" is mainly due to a combination of\ntwo contributing factors: (i) moderate intrinsic extinction at moderate\nredshifts, and (ii) about 22% of \"dark\" bursts at redshift $>$5.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 6 figs, A&A (accepted)"]}]

We also adopt a hierarchical structure that allows for variation in\nrates across sites without an explosion in the effective number of parameters.\nOur context-specific priors capture the expected stationarity, or\nnear-stationarity, of the stochastic process that generated the data analyzed\nhere. This expected stationarity is shown to greatly increase the precision of\nthe estimation. Applying our model to a data set collected at the human FMR1\nlocus, we find that measurement errors, generally ignored in similar studies,\noccur at a nontrivial rate (inappropriate bisulfite conversion error: 1.6$%$\nwith 80$%$ CI: 0.9--2.3$%$).

A classical way to test stellar interior\nmodels is to compare the predicted and observed location of a star on\ntheoretical evolutionary tracks in a H-R diagram. This requires the best\npossible determinations of stellar mass, radius, luminosity and abundances. To\nderive its fundamental parameters, we observed the well-known rapidly\noscillating Ap star, $\\gamma$ Equ, using the visible spectro-interferometer\nVEGA installed on the optical CHARA array. We computed the calibrated squared\nvisibility and derived the limb-darkened diameter. We used the whole energy\nflux distribution, the parallax and this angular diameter to determine the\nluminosity and the effective temperature of the star.

A variety of experiments have shown that non-Bernal\nrotations restore this broken symmetry; consequently, these stacking varieties\nhave been the subject of intensive theoretical interest. Most theories predict\nsubstantial changes in the band structure ranging from the development of a Van\nHove singularity and an angle dependent electron localization that causes the\nFermi velocity to go to zero as the relative rotation angle between sheets goes\nto zero. In this work we show by direct measurement that non-Bernal rotations\npreserve the graphene symmetry with only a small perturbation due to weak\neffective interlayer coupling.

Using the MOIRCS\nnear-infrared imager on the Subaru Telescope we found 11 candidate\nemission-line galaxies to a flux limit of ~7.5 10^-17 erg s-1 cm-2, which is\nabout 5 times excess from the expected field counts with ~3-sigma significance.\nThree of these are spectroscopically confirmed as redshifted Halpha at z=2.49.\nThe distribution of candidate emitters on the sky is tightly confined to a\n1.2-Mpc-radius area at z=2.49, locating 4C 23.56 at the western edge of the\ndistribution. Analysis of the deep Spitzer MIPS 24 mu m imaging shows that\nthere is also an excess of faint MIPS sources. All but two of the 11 HAEs are\nalso found in the MIPS data. The inferred star-formation rate (SFR) of the HAEs\nbased on the extinction-corrected Halpha luminosity (median SFR >~100 M_solar\nyr-1) is similar to those of HAEs in random fields at z~2. On the other hand,\nthe MIPS-based SFR for the HAEs is on average 3.6 times larger, suggesting the\nexistence of the star-formation significanly obscured by dust. The comparison\nof the Halpha-based star-formation activities of the HAEs in the 4C 23.56 field\nto those in another proto-cluster around PKS 1138-262 at z=2.16 reveals that\nthe latter tend to have fainter Halpha emission despite similar K-band\nmagnitudes. This suggests that star-formation may be suppressed in the PKS\n1138-262 protocluster relative to the 4C 23.56 protocluster. This difference\namong the HAEs in the two proto-clusters at z > 2 may imply that some massive\ncluster galaxies are just forming at these epochs with some variation among\nclusters.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 13 figures, to be published in PASJ Subaru Special Issue\n  (2011 Mar.)"]}]

Notorious members are the Bernoulli model for binary data,\nleading to logistic regression, and the Poisson model for count data, leading\nto Poisson regression. Two of the main reasons for extending this family are\n(1) the occurrence of overdispersion, meaning that the variability in the data\nis not adequately described by the models, which often exhibit a prescribed\nmean--variance link, and (2) the accommodation of hierarchical structure in the\ndata, stemming from clustering in the data which, in turn, may result from\nrepeatedly measuring the outcome, for various members of the same family, etc.\nThe first issue is dealt with through a variety of overdispersion models, such\nas, for example, the beta-binomial model for grouped binary data and the\nnegative-binomial model for counts. Clustering is often accommodated through\nthe inclusion of random subject-specific effects. Though not always, one\nconventionally assumes such random effects to be normally distributed. While\nboth of these phenomena may occur simultaneously, models combining them are\nuncommon. This paper proposes a broad class of generalized linear models\naccommodating overdispersion and clustering through two separate sets of random\neffects.

We bin our individual measurements and\ndetect the SZ signal down to the lowest richness systems (N200=10) with high\nsignificance, achieving a detection of the SZ signal in systems with mass as\nlow as M500~5e13 Msolar. The observed Y500-N200 relation is well modeled by a\npower law over the full richness range. It has a lower normalisation at given\nN200 than predicted based on X-ray models and published mass-richness\nrelations. An X-ray subsample, however, does conform to the predicted scaling,\nand model predictions do reproduce the relation between our measured\nbin-average SZ signal and measured bin-average X-ray luminosities. At fixed\nrichness, we find an intrinsic dispersion in the Y500-N200 relation of 60%\nrising to of order 100% at low richness. Thanks to its all-sky coverage, Planck\nprovides observations for more than 13,000 MaxBCG clusters and an unprecedented\nSZ/optical data set, extending the list of known cluster scaling laws to\ninclude SZ-optical properties. The data set offers essential clues for models\nof galaxy formation. Moreover, the lower normalisation of the SZ-mass relation\nimplied by the observed SZ-richness scaling has important consequences for\ncluster physics and cosmological studies with SZ clusters.\n","Comment: Also available from this URL: http://www.rssd.esa.int"]}]

The optical depth\nmaps are correlated to tracers of the atomic and molecular gas. The correlation\nis linear in the lowest column density regions at high galactic latitudes. At\nhigh NH, the correlation is consistent with that of the lowest NH. In the\nintermediate NH range, we observe departure from linearity, with the dust\noptical depth in excess to the correlation. We attribute this excess emission\nto thermal emission by dust associated with a Dark-Gas phase, undetected in the\navailable HI and CO measurements. We show the 2D spatial distribution of the\nDark-Gas in the solar neighborhood and show that it extends around known\nmolecular regions traced by CO. The average dust emissivity in the HI phase in\nthe solar neighborhood follows roughly a power law distribution with beta = 1.8\nall the way down to 3 mm, although the SED flattens slightly in the millimetre.\nThe threshold for the existence of the Dark-Gas is found at NH = (8.0\\pm 0.58)\n10^{20} Hcm-2. Assuming the same dust emissivity at high frequencies for the\ndust in the atomic and molecular phases leads to an average XCO = (2.54\\pm0.13)\n10^{20} H2cm-2/(K km s-1). The mass of Dark-Gas is found to be 28% of the\natomic gas and 118% of the CO emitting gas in the solar neighborhood. A\npossible origin for the Dark-Gas is the existence of a dark molecular phase,\nwhere H2 survives photodissociation but CO does not. The observed transition\nfor the onset of this phase in the solar neighborhood (AV = 0.4 mag) appears\nconsistent with recent theoretical predictions. We also discuss the possibility\nthat up to half of the Dark-Gas could be in atomic form, due to optical depth\neffects in the HI measurements.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 10 figures"]}]

The catalogue is based on data that consist of\nmapping the entire sky once and 60% of the sky a second time by Planck, thereby\ncomprising the first high sensitivity radio/submillimetre observations of the\nentire sky. A Monte-Carlo algorithm based on the injection and extraction of\nartificial sources into the Planck maps was implemented to select reliable\nsources among all extracted candidates such that the cumulative reliability of\nthe catalogue is >=90%. The 10sigma photometric flux density limit of the\ncatalogue at |b|>30 deg is 0.49, 1.0, 0.67, 0.5, 0.33, 0.28, 0.25, 0.47 and\n0.82 Jy at each of the nine frequencies between 30 and 857 GHz. Sources which\nare up to a factor of ~2 fainter than this limit, and which are present in\n\"clean\" regions of the Galaxy where the sky background due to emission from the\ninterstellar medium is low, are included in the ERCSC if they meet the high\nreliability criterion. The Planck ERCSC sources have known associations to\nstars with dust shells, stellar cores, radio galaxies, blazars, infrared\nluminous galaxies and Galactic interstellar medium features. A significant\nfraction of unclassified sources are also present in the catalogs. In addition,\ntwo early release catalogs that contain 915 cold molecular cloud core\ncandidates and 189 SZ cluster candidates that have been generated using\nmulti-frequency algorithms are presented. The entire source list, with more\nthan 15000 unique sources, is ripe for follow-up characterisation with\nHerschel, ATCA, VLA, SOFIA, ALMA and other ground-based observing facilities.\n","Comment: Updated to match A&A press version"]}]

The\nsample comprises ~ 1600 X-ray clusters with redshifts up to ~ 1 and spans a\nwide range in X-ray luminosity. The SZ signal is extracted for each object\nindividually, and the statistical significance of the measurement is maximised\nby averaging the SZ signal in bins of X-ray luminosity, total mass, or\nredshift. The SZ signal is detected at very high significance over more than\ntwo decades in X-ray luminosity (10^43 erg/s < L_500 E(z)^-7/3 < 2 X 10^45\nerg/s). The relation between intrinsic SZ signal and X-ray luminosity is\ninvestigated and the measured SZ signal is compared to values predicted from\nX-ray data. Planck measurements and X-ray based predictions are found to be in\nexcellent agreement over the whole explored luminosity range. No significant\ndeviation from standard evolution of the scaling relations is detected. For the\nfirst time the intrinsic scatter in the scaling relation between SZ signal and\nX-ray luminosity is measured and found to be consistent with the one in the\nluminosity -- mass relation from X-ray studies. There is no evidence of any\ndeficit in SZ signal strength in Planck data relative to expectations from the\nX-ray properties of clusters, underlining the robustness and consistency of our\noverall view of intra-cluster medium properties.\n","Comment: Final version accepted for publication in A&A.

We here present the first results on the properties of nearby\ngalaxies using these data. We match the ERCSC catalogue to IRAS-detected\ngalaxies in the Imperial IRAS Faint Source Redshift Catalogue (IIFSCz), so that\nwe can measure the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these objects from\n60 to 850 microns. This produces a list of 1717 galaxies with reliable\nassociations between Planck and IRAS, from which we select a subset of 468 for\nSED studies, namely those with strong detections in the three highest frequency\nPlanck bands and no evidence of cirrus contamination. The SEDs are fitted using\nparametric dust models to determine the range of dust temperatures and\nemissivities. We find evidence for colder dust than has previously been found\nin external galaxies, with T<20K. Such cold temperatures are found using both\nthe standard single temperature dust model with variable emissivity beta, or a\ntwo dust temperature model with beta fixed at 2. We also compare our results to\nstudies of distant submm galaxies (SMGs) which have been claimed to contain\ncooler dust than their local counterparts. We find that including our sample of\n468 galaxies significantly reduces the distinction between the two populations.\nFits to SEDs of selected objects using more sophisticated templates derived\nfrom radiative transfer models confirm the presence of the colder dust found\nthrough parameteric fitting. We thus conclude that cold (T<20K) dust is a\nsignificant and largely unexplored component of many nearby galaxies.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 14 figures"]}]

The origin of this millimetre excess is\nstill unexplained, and is here investigated using the Planck data. The\nbackground CMB contribution is subtracted using an ILC method performed locally\naround the galaxies. The foreground emission from the Milky Way is subtracted.\nAfter subtraction, the emission of both galaxies correlates closely with the\ngas emission of the LMC and SMC. The millimetre excess in the LMC can be\nexplained by CMB fluctuations, but a significant excess is still present in the\nSMC SED. The Planck and IRIS data at 100 micron are combined to produce thermal\ndust temperature and optical depth maps of the two galaxies. The LMC\ntemperature map shows the presence of a warm inner arm already found with the\nSpitzer data, but also shows the existence of a previously unidentified cold\nouter arm. Several cold regions are found along this arm, some of which are\nassociated with known molecular clouds. The average emissivity spectral index\nis found to be consistent with beta=1.5 and beta=1.2 below 500 microns for the\nLMC and SMC respectively, significantly flatter than the values observed in the\nMilky Way. Furthermore, there is evidence in the SMC for a further flattening\nof the SED in the sub-mm. The spatial distribution of the millimetre dust\nexcess in the SMC follows the gas and thermal dust distribution. Different\nmodels are explored in order to fit the dust emission in the SMC. It is\nconcluded that the millimetre excess is unlikely to be caused by very cold dust\nemission and that it could be due to a combination of spinning dust. emission\nand thermal dust emission by more amorphous dust grains than those present in\nour Galaxy.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 14 Figures"]}]

Other refinements are the use of an arbitrary Friedmann model as\nthe background (unperturbed) initial state and the adaptation of the model to\nan arbitrary density profile of the galaxy.

As a consequence of the\nexistence of these many-body states the half-metallic gap is closed and the\ncarriers spin polarization is significantly reduced. Below the Fermi level the\nminority spin highest valence states are found to localize more on the GaAs\nlayers being independent of the type of electronic correlations considered.\nThus, our results confirm the confinement of carriers in these delta-doped\nheterostructures, having a spin-polarization that follow a different\ntemperature dependence than magnetization. We suggest that polarized\nhot-electron photoluminescence experiments might bring evidence for the\nexistence of many-body states within the minority spin channel and their finite\ntemperature behavior.\n","Comment: 10 pages 8 figures, submitted to PRB"]}]

The data from\nradio to VHE gamma-rays do not show any significant variability. We combine new\nH.E.S.S., Fermi/LAT and Nancay Radio Telescope observations with pre-existing\nnon-simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of IGR J19443+2117 and discuss\nthe likely source associations as well as the interpretation as an active\ngalactic nucleus, a gamma-ray binary or a pulsar wind nebula. The lack of a\nmassive stellar counterpart disfavors the binary hypothesis, while the soft VHE\nspectrum would be very unusual in case of a pulsar wind nebula. In addition,\nthe distance estimates for Galactic counterparts places them outside of the\nMilky Way. All available observations favor an interpretation as an extreme,\nhigh-frequency peaked BL Lac object with a redshift z>0.14.

Ab initio calculations are used to\ninvestigate quantum interference in a benzene-1,2-dithiolate (BDT) molecule\nsandwiched between gold electrodes and through oligoynes of various lengths. We\nshow that when a point charge is located in the plane of a BDT molecule and its\nposition varied, the electrical conductance exhibits a clear interference\neffect, whereas when the charge approaches a BDT molecule along a line normal\nto the plane of the molecule and passing through the centre of the phenyl ring,\ninterference effects are negligible. In the case of olygoynes, quantum\ninterference leads to the appearance of a critical energy $E_c$, at which the\nelectron transmission coefficient $T(E)$ of chains with even or odd numbers of\natoms is independent of length. To illustrate the underlying physics, we derive\na general analytical formula for electron transport through multi-branch\nstructures and demonstrate the versatility of the formula by comparing it with\nthe above ab-initio simulations. We also employ the analytical formula to\ninvestigate the current inside the molecule and demonstrate that large counter\ncurrents can occur within a ring-like molecule such as BDT, when the point\ncharge is located in the plane of the molecule.

They offer an excellent\nlaboratory to study close and wide binary systems, and to scrutinize their\ninteriors through asteroseismology, as some of them undergo stellar\noscillations. However, their origins are still uncertain, and increasing the\nnumber of detections is crucial to undertake statistical studies. In this work,\nwe aim at defining a strategy to find new, uncatalogued hot subdwarfs. Making\nuse of Virtual Observatory tools we thoroughly search stellar catalogues to\nretrieve multi-colour photometry and astrometric information of a known sample\nof blue objects, including hot subdwarfs, white dwarfs, cataclysmic variables\nand main sequence OB stars. We define a procedure to discriminate among these\nspectral classes, particularly designed to obtain a hot subdwarf sample with a\nlow contamination factor. In order to check the validity of the method, this\nprocedure is then applied to two test sky regions: the Kepler FoV and to a test\nregion of around (RA:225, DEC:5) deg. As a result, we obtained 38 hot subdwarf\ncandidates, 23 of which had already a spectral classification. We have acquired\nspectroscopy for three other targets, and four additional ones have an\navailable SDSS spectrum, which we used to determine their spectral type. A\ntemperature estimate is provided for the candidates based on their spectral\nenergy distribution, considering two-atmospheres fit for objects with clear\ninfrared excess. Eventually, out of 30 candidates with spectral classification,\n26 objects were confirmed to be hot subdwarfs, yielding a contamination factor\nof only 13%. The high rate of success demonstrates the validity of the proposed\nstrategy to find new uncatalogued hot subdwarfs. An application of this method\nto the entire sky will be presented in a forthcoming work.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 7 figures"]}]

Given its known age, distance, and\nspectral type, 2MASS 1207 b is under-luminous by a factor of ~10 (~2.5 mags)\nwhen compared to standard models of brown-dwarf/giant-planet evolution. In this\npaper, we study three possible sources of 2MASS 1207 b's under-luminosity.\nFirst, we investigate Mohanty et al. (2007)'s hypothesis that a near edge-on\ndisk might be responsible for 2MASS 1207 b's under-luminosity. We conclude that\nthe hypothesis is unlikely due to the lack of variability seen in multi-epoch\nphotometry and unnecessary due to the increasing sample of under-luminous\nbrown-dwarfs/giant-exoplanets that cannot be explained by an edge-on disk.\nNext, we test the analogous possibility that a spherical shell of dust, could\nexplain 2MASS 1207 b's under-luminosity. Models containing enough dust to\ncreate ~2.5 mags of extinction, placed at reasonable radii, are ruled out by\nour new Gemini/T-ReCS 8.7 micron photometric upper-limit for 2MASS 1207 b.\nFinally, we investigate the possibility that 2MASS 1207 b is intrinsically\ncooler than the commonly used AMES-DUSTY fits to its spectrum, and thus it is\nnot, in fact, under-luminous. New, thick cloud model grids by Madhusudhan et\nal. (2011) fit 2MASS 1207 b's 1-10 micron SED well, but they do not quite fit\nits near-infrared spectrum. However, we suggest that with some \"tuning\", they\nmight be capable of simultaneously reproducing 2MASS 1207 b's spectral shape\nand luminosity. In this case, the whole class of young, under-luminous\nbrown-dwarfs/giant-exoplanets might be explained by atmospheres that are able\nto suspend thick, dusty clouds in their photospheres at lower temperatures than\nfield brown-dwarfs.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 9 figures, accepted to ApJ"]}]

In order to determine if this suppression is related to\ncolor screening of these states in the produced medium, one needs to account\nfor other nuclear modifications including those in cold nuclear matter. In this\npaper, we present new measurements from the PHENIX 2007 data set of J/psi\nyields at forward rapidity (1.2<|y|<2.2) in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=200\nGeV. The data confirm the earlier finding that the suppression of J/psi at\nforward rapidity is stronger than at midrapidity, while also extending the\nmeasurement to finer bins in collision centrality and higher transverse\nmomentum (pT). We compare the experimental data to the most recent theoretical\ncalculations that incorporate a variety of physics mechanisms including gluon\nsaturation, gluon shadowing, initial-state parton energy loss, cold nuclear\nmatter breakup, color screening, and charm recombination. We find J/psi\nsuppression beyond cold-nuclear-matter effects. However, the current level of\ndisagreement between models and d+Au data precludes using these models to\nquantify the hot-nuclear-matter suppression.\n","Comment: 384 authors from 65 institutions, 13 pages, 10 figures, and 4 tables.\n  Submitted to Physical Review C.

For the first time, a search is performed over the\nentire parameter space of energy, direction and time looking for neutrino\nflares of 20 microseconds to a year duration from astrophysical sources among\nthe atmospheric neutrino and muon backgrounds. Searches which integrate over\ntime are less sensitive to flares because they are affected by a larger\nbackground of atmospheric neutrinos and muons that can be reduced by the time\nconstraint. Flaring sources considered here, such as active galactic nuclei,\nsoft gamma-ray repeaters and gamma-ray bursts, are promising candidate neutrino\nemitters. We used mainly data taken between April 5, 2008 and May 20, 2009 by a\npartially completed configuration of IceCube with 40 strings. For the presented\nsearches an unbinned maximum likelihood method is used with a time-dependent\nprior to test several different source hypotheses. An \"untriggered\" search\ncovers any possible time-dependent emission from sources not correlated to any\nother observation using other astrophysical messengers such as photons.\nMoreover, a similar time scan is performed for a predefined catalogue of\nsources that exhibit intense photon flares. Searches triggered by\nmulti-wavelength information on flares from blazars and soft gamma-ray\nrepeaters are performed using the 40 string data and also the data taken by the\nprevious configuration of 22 strings in operation between May 31, 2007 and\nApril 5, 2008. Flares for which extensive and continuous monitoring is\navailable from Fermi-LAT and SWIFT and flares detected by imaging Cherenkov\ntelescopes with shorter time-scale monitoring are considered. The results from\nall searches are compatible with a fluctuation of the background.\n","Comment: 37 pages, 14 figures. Accepted to the Astrophysical Journal"]}]

It is also rich in interstellar\nmatter, and contains evidence of the interplay between massive stars and their\nsurrounding medium, such as the rim HII region NGC 6188. Aims: We provide\nrobust estimates of the fundamental parameters (age and distance) of the two\nmost prominent stellar clusters, NGC 6167 and NGC 6193, that may be used as a\nbasis for studing the star formation history of the region. Methods: The study\nis based on a photometric optical survey (UBVIHa) of NGC 6167 and NGC 6193 and\ntheir nearby field, complemented with public data from 2MASS-VVV, UCAC3, and\nIRAC-Spitzer in this region. Results: We produce a uniform photometric\ncatalogue and estimate more robustly the fundamental parameters of NGC 6167 and\nNGC 6193, in addition to the IRAS 16375-4854 source. As a consequence, all of\nthem are located at approximately the same distance from the Sun in the\nSagittarius-Carina Galactic arm. However, the ages we estimate differ widely:\nNGC 6167 is found to be an intermediate-age cluster (20-30 Myr), NGC 6193 a\nvery young one (1-5 Myr) with PMS, H? emitters and class II objects, and the\nIRAS 16375-4854 source is the youngest of the three containing several YSOs.\nConclusions: These results support a picture in which Ara OB1a is a region\nwhere star formation has proceeded for several tens of Myr until the present.\nThe difference in the ages of the different stellar groups can be interpreted\nas a consequence of a triggered star formation process. In the specific case of\nNGC 6193, we find evidence of possible non-coeval star formation.\n"]}]

Pairs were also detected with both hadrons\nmeasured at forward rapidity; in this case the yield of back-to-back hadron\npairs in d+Au collisions with small impact parameters is observed to be\nsuppressed by a factor of 10 relative to p+p collisions. The kinematics of\nthese pairs is expected to probe partons in the Au nucleus with low fraction x\nof the nucleon momenta, where the gluon densities rise sharply.

We have\ndeveloped a time-dependent theory that allows us to specify any input\nsingle-photon wavepacket guided by the waveguide as initial condition, and\ncalculate the excitation probability of the emitter, as well as the time\nevolution of the transmitted and reflected field. For single-photon wavepackets\nwith a gaussian spectrum and temporal shape, we obtain analytical solutions for\nthe dynamics of absorption, with maximum atomic excitation $\\thicksim 40%$. We\nfurthermore propose a terminated waveguide to aid the single-photon absorption.\nWe find that for an emitter placed at an optimal distance from the termination,\nthe maximum atomic excitation due to an incident single-photon wavepacket can\nexceed 70%. This high value is a direct consequence of the high spontaneous\nemission $\\beta$-factor for emission into the waveguide. Finally, we have also\nexplored whether waveguide dispersion could aid single-photon absorption by\npulse shaping. For a gaussian input wavepacket, we find that the absorption\nefficiency can be improved by a further 4% by engineering the dispersion.\nEfficient single-photon absorption by a single emitter has potential\napplications in quantum communication and quantum computation.\n","Comment: The paper has beek withdrawn by the author because of the wrong\n  colors in the the fightes"]}]

CALIFA has been\ndesigned to allow the building of two-dimensional maps of the following\nquantities: (a) stellar populations: ages and metallicities; (b) ionized gas:\ndistribution, excitation mechanism and chemical abundances; and (c) kinematic\nproperties: both from stellar and ionized gas components. CALIFA uses the PPAK\nIntegral Field Unit (IFU), with a hexagonal field-of-view of\n$\\sim1.3\\sq\\arcmin'$, with a 100% covering factor by adopting a three-pointing\ndithering scheme. The optical wavelength range is covered from 3700 to 7000\n{\\AA}, using two overlapping setups (V500 and V1200), with different\nresolutions: R\\sim850 and R\\sim1650, respectively. CALIFA is a legacy survey,\nintended for the community. The reduced data will be released, once the quality\nhas been guaranteed. The analyzed data fulfill the expectations of the original\nobserving proposal, on the basis of a set of quality checks and exploratory\nanalysis.\n  We conclude from this first look at the data that CALIFA will be an important\nresource for archaeological studies of galaxies in the Local Universe.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 29 figures, Accepted for publishing in Astronomy and\n  Astrophysics"]}]

With regard\nto the so-called H-dibaryon it is shown that the SU(3) breaking effects induced\nby the differences of the pertinent two-baryon thresholds (Lambda-Lambda, Xi-N,\nSigma-Sigma) have a very pronounced impact on its binding energy.

In a frequency band of 600-1000 Hz, we obtained a 95%\nupper limit on the amplitude of $\\Omega_{\\rm GW}(f) = \\Omega_3 (f/900\n\\mathrm{Hz})^3$, of $\\Omega_3 < 0.33$, assuming a value of the Hubble parameter\nof $h_{100}=0.72$. These new limits are a factor of seven better than the\nprevious best in this frequency band.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 6 figures.

The sample was selected\nin order to test internal SZ quality flags, and the pertinence of these flags\nis discussed in light of the validation results. Ten of the candidates are\nfound to be bona fide clusters lying below the RASS flux limit. Redshift\nestimates are available for all confirmed systems via X-ray Fe-line\nspectroscopy. They lie in the redshift range 0.19<z<0.94, demonstrating\nPlanck's capability to detect clusters up to high z. The X-ray properties of\nthe new clusters appear to be similar to previous new detections by Planck at\nlower z and higher SZ flux: the majority are X-ray underluminous for their\nmass, estimated using Y_X as mass proxy, and many have a disturbed morphology.\nWe find tentative indication for Malmquist bias in the Y_SZ-Y_X relation, with\na turnover at Y_SZ \\sim 4 e-4 arcmin^2. We present additional new optical\nredshift determinations with ENO and ESO telescopes of candidates previously\nconfirmed with XMM-Newton. The X-ray and optical redshifts for a total of 20\nclusters are found to be in excellent agreement. We also show that useful lower\nlimits can be put on cluster redshifts using X-ray data only via the use of the\nY_X vs. Y_SZ and X-ray flux F_X vs. Y_SZ relations.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in A&A on April 15;\n  minor modifications following referee comments"]}]

In this context, in\nhis latest book, titled Thinking Fast and Slow [8], Kahneman [7,8] provides\nfurther theoretical interpretation by differentiating the two assumed systems\nof the cognitive functioning of the human mind. He calls them intuition (system\n1) determined to be an associative (automatic, fast and perceptual) machine,\nand reasoning (system 2) required to be voluntary and to operate logical-\ndeductively. In this paper, we propose an ansatz inspired by Ausubel's learning\ntheory for investigating, from the constructivist perspective [9-12],\ninformation processing in the working memory of cognizers. Specifically, a\nthought experiment is performed utilizing the mind of a dual-natured creature\nknown as Maxwell's demon: a tiny \"man-machine\" solely equipped with the\ncharacteristics of system 1, which prevents it from reasoning. The calculation\npresented here shows that [...]. This result indicates that when the system 2\nis shut down, both an intelligent being, as well as a binary machine, incur the\nsame energy cost per unit of information processed, which mathematically proves\nthe computational attribute of the system 1, as Kahneman [7,8] theorized. This\nfinding links information theory to human psychological features and opens a\nnew path toward the conception of a multi-bit reasoning machine.\n"]}]

The results showed that the spot modeling from\nthe light curve analysis are in accordance with the Doppler maps, while the\nnon-circular spot modeling technique is needed in order to obtain much better\nand reliable spot models.\n","Comment: This study was presented at the IAU Symposium 282, From Interacting\n  Binaries to Exoplanets: Essential Modeling Tools Slovakia, July 18-22 2011.\n  This manuscript will be published in IAUS 282 conference proceedings edited\n  by Mercedes T.

Only toward rho Oph A did Odin detect a weak line of O2 at\n119 GHz in a beam size of 10 arcmin. A larger telescope aperture such as that\nof the Herschel Space Observatory is required to resolve the O2 emission and to\npinpoint its origin. We use the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared\naboard Herschel to obtain high resolution O2 spectra toward selected positions\nin rho Oph A. These data are analysed using standard techniques for O2\nexcitation and compared to recent PDR-like chemical cloud models. The 487.2GHz\nline was clearly detected toward all three observed positions in rho Oph A. In\naddition, an oversampled map of the 773.8GHz transition revealed the detection\nof the line in only half of the observed area. Based on their ratios, the\ntemperature of the O2 emitting gas appears to vary quite substantially, with\nwarm gas (> 50 K) adjacent to a much colder region, where temperatures are\nbelow 30 K. The exploited models predict O2 column densities to be sensitive to\nthe prevailing dust temperatures, but rather insensitive to the temperatures of\nthe gas. In agreement with these model, the observationally determined O2\ncolumn densities seem not to depend strongly on the derived gas temperatures,\nbut fall into the range N(O2) = (3 to >6)e15/cm^2. Beam averaged O2 abundances\nare about 5e-8 relative to H2. Combining the HIFI data with earlier Odin\nobservations yields a source size at 119 GHz of about 4 - 5 arcmin,\nencompassing the entire rho Oph A core.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 8 figures intended for publication in A&A"]}]

Extensive research efforts have been made to develop V2V\nchannel models to be implemented in advanced VANET system simulators for\nperformance evaluation. The impact of shadowing caused by other vehicles has,\nhowever, largely been neglected in most of the models, as well as in the system\nsimulations. In this paper we present a shadow fading model targeting system\nsimulations based on real measurements performed in urban and highway\nscenarios. The measurement data is separated into three categories,\nline-of-sight (LOS), obstructed line-of-sight (OLOS) by vehicles, and non\nline-of-sight due to buildings, with the help of video information recorded\nduring the measurements. It is observed that vehicles obstructing the LOS\ninduce an additional average attenuation of about 10 dB in the received signal\npower. An approach to incorporate the LOS/OLOS model into existing VANET\nsimulators is also provided. Finally, system level VANET simulation results are\npresented, showing the difference between the LOS/OLOS model and a channel\nmodel based on Nakagami-m fading.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 12 figures, submitted to Hindawi International Journal of\n  Antennas and Propagation"]}]

Modification of\nheavy-flavor production in heavy-ion collisions relative to binary-collision\nscaling from p+p results, quantified with the nuclear-modification factor\n(R_AA), provides information on both cold- and hot-nuclear-matter effects.\n  Purpose: Determine transverse-momentum, pt, spectra and the corresponding\nR_AA for muons from heavy-flavor mesons decay in p+p and Cu+Cu collisions at\nsqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV and y=1.65.\n  Method: Results are obtained using the semi-leptonic decay of heavy-flavor\nmesons into negative muons. The PHENIX muon-arm spectrometers measure the p_T\nspectra of inclusive muon candidates. Backgrounds, primarily due to light\nhadrons, are determined with a Monte-Carlo calculation using a set of input\nhadron distributions tuned to match measured-hadron distributions in the same\ndetector and statistically subtracted.\n  Results: The charm-production cross section in p+p collisions at sqrt{s}=200\nGeV, integrated over pt and in the rapidity range 1.4<y<1.9 is found to be\ndsigma_ccbar/dy = 0.139 +/- 0.029 (stat) ^{+0.051}_{-0.058} (syst) mb. This\nresult is consistent with calculations and with expectations based on the\ncorresponding midrapidity charm-production cross section measured earlier by\nPHENIX. The R_AA for heavy-flavor muons in Cu+Cu collisions is measured in\nthree centrality intervals for 1<pt<4 GeV/c. Suppression relative to\nbinary-collision scaling (R_AA<1) increases with centrality.\n  Conclusions: Within experimental and theoretical uncertainties, the measured\nheavy-flavor yield in p+p collisions is consistent with state-of-the-art pQCD\ncalculations. Suppression in central Cu+Cu collisions suggests the presence of\nsignificant cold-nuclear-matter effects and final-state energy loss.\n","Comment: 376 authors, 18 pages, 14 figures, 5 tables.

In this paper, we report the detections and measurements of 2\nbinaries discovered from observations of microlensing events MOA-2011-BLG-090\nand OGLE-2011-BLG-0417. Determinations of the binary masses are possible by\nsimultaneously measuring the Einstein radius and the lens parallax. The\nmeasured masses of the binary components are 0.43 $M_{\\odot}$ and 0.39\n$M_{\\odot}$ for MOA-2011-BLG-090 and 0.57 $M_{\\odot}$ and 0.17 $M_{\\odot}$ for\nOGLE-2011-BLG-0417 and thus both lens components of MOA-2011-BLG-090 and one\ncomponent of OGLE-2011-BLG-0417 are M dwarfs, demonstrating the usefulness of\nmicrolensing in detecting binaries composed of low-mass components. From\nmodeling of the light curves considering full Keplerian motion of the lens, we\nalso measure the orbital parameters of the binaries. The blended light of\nOGLE-2011-BLG-0417 comes very likely from the lens itself, making it possible\nto check the microlensing orbital solution by follow-up radial-velocity\nobservation. For both events, the caustic-crossing parts of the light curves,\nwhich are critical for determining the physical lens parameters, were resolved\nby high-cadence survey observations and thus it is expected that the number of\nmicrolensing binaries with measured physical parameters will increase in the\nfuture.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables"]}]

The differential cross-section of elastic proton-proton\ncollisions is analyzed in a detailed and systematic manner at small momentum\ntransfers, starting from the energy range of CERN ISR at $ \\sqrt{s}= 23.5 $\nGeV, including also recent TOTEM data at the present LHC energies at $\\sqrt{s}\n= 7$ TeV. These studies confirm the picture that the size of proton increases\nsystematically with increasing energies, while the size of the constituent\nquarks and diquarks remains approximately independent of (or only increases\nonly slightly with) the colliding energy. The detailed analysis indicates\ncorrelations between model parameters and also indicates an increasing role of\nshadowing at LHC energies. Within the investigated class of models, a simple\nand model-independent phenomenological relation was discovered that connects\nthe total p+p scattering cross-section to the effective quark, diquark size and\ntheir average separation. Our best fits indicate, that the relative error of\nthis phenomenological relation is 10-15% in the considered energy range.\n","Comment: 33 pages, 28 figures"]}]

We study the model\ncase of three identical bosons (mass m) with resonant two-body interactions in\na cubic box with periodic boundary conditions, which can also be generalized to\nthe three-nucleon system in a straightforward manner. Our results allow for the\nremoval of finite volume effects from lattice results as well as the\ndetermination of infinite volume scattering parameters from the volume\ndependence of the spectrum. We study the volume dependence of several states\nbelow the break-up threshold, spanning one order of magnitude in the binding\nenergy in the infinite volume, for box side lengths L between the two-body\nscattering length a and L = 0.25a. For example, a state with a three-body\nenergy of -3/(ma^2) in the infinite volume has been shifted to -10/(ma^2) at L\n= a. Special emphasis is put on the consequences of the breakdown of spherical\nsymmetry and several ways to perturbatively treat the ensuing partial wave\nadmixtures. We find their contributions to be on the sub-percent level compared\nto the strong volume dependence of the S-wave component.

We observed 15 new candidates, detected with\nsignal-to-noise ratios between 4.0 and 6.1 in the 15.5-month nominal Planck\nsurvey. The candidates were selected using ancillary data flags derived from\nthe ROSAT All Sky Survey (RASS) and Digitized Sky Survey all-sky maps, with the\naim of pushing into the low SZ flux, high-z regime and testing RASS flags as\nindicators of candidate reliability. 14 new clusters were detected by XMM,\nincluding 2 double systems. Redshifts lie in the range 0.2 to 0.9, with 6\nclusters at z>0.5. Estimated M500 range from 2.5 10^14 to 8 10^14 Msun. We\ndiscuss our results in the context of the full XMM validation programme, in\nwhich 51 new clusters have been detected. This includes 4 double and 2 triple\nsystems, some of which are chance projections on the sky of clusters at\ndifferent z. We find that association with a RASS-BSC source is a robust\nindicator of the reliability of a candidate, whereas association with a FSC\nsource does not guarantee that the SZ candidate is a bona fide cluster.\nNevertheless, most Planck clusters appear in RASS maps, with a significance\ngreater than 2 sigma being a good indication that the candidate is a real\ncluster. The full sample gives a Planck sensitivity threshold of Y500 ~ 4 10^-4\narcmin^2, with indication for Malmquist bias in the YX-Y500 relation below this\nlevel. The corresponding mass threshold depends on z. Systems with M500 > 5\n10^14 Msun at z > 0.5 are easily detectable with Planck. The newly-detected\nclusters follow the YX-Y500 relation derived from X-ray selected samples.\nCompared to X-ray selected clusters, the new SZ clusters have a lower X-ray\nluminosity on average for their mass. There is no indication of departure from\nstandard self-similar evolution in the X-ray versus SZ scaling properties.\n(abridged)\n","Comment: accepted by A&A"]}]

Two dynamic regimes separated by a threshold frequency $\\omega_c$\ncharacterize the dependence on the sweep rate of the oscillating field.

Conventional approaches select $B$ meson decay\nproducts that are significantly displaced from the $B$ meson production vertex.\nAs a consequence, $B$ mesons with low decay times are suppressed, introducing a\nbias to the decay time spectrum which must be corrected. This analysis uses a\ntechnique that explicitly avoids a lifetime bias by using a neural network\nbased trigger and event selection. Using 1.0 fb$^{-1}$ of data recorded by the\nLHCb experiment, the effective $B_s^0 \\rightarrow K^+ K^-$ lifetime is measured\nas $1.455 \\pm 0.046 \\; \\mathrm{(stat.)} \\pm 0.006 \\; \\mathrm{(syst.)} \\,\n\\mathrm{ps}.$\n","Comment: 10 pages, 2 figures.

The\nnumerous processing cores have non-uniform access latencies to the main memory\nand to the processor caches, which causes variability in the communication\ncosts. Unfortunately, database systems mostly assume that all processing cores\nare the same and that microarchitecture differences are not significant enough\nto appear in critical database execution paths. As we demonstrate in this\npaper, however, hardware heterogeneity does appear in the critical path and\nconventional database architectures achieve suboptimal and even worse,\nunpredictable performance. We perform a detailed performance analysis of OLTP\ndeployments in servers with multiple cores per CPU (multicore) and multiple\nCPUs per server (multisocket). We compare different database deployment\nstrategies where we vary the number and size of independent database instances\nrunning on a single server, from a single shared-everything instance to\nfine-grained shared-nothing configurations. We quantify the impact of\nnon-uniform hardware on various deployments by (a) examining how efficiently\neach deployment uses the available hardware resources and (b) measuring the\nimpact of distributed transactions and skewed requests on different workloads.\nFinally, we argue in favor of shared-nothing deployments that are topology- and\nworkload-aware and take advantage of fast on-chip communication between islands\nof cores on the same socket.\n","Comment: VLDB2012"]}]

The candidate counterparts\nwere determined with Chandra, and the optical observations were performed with\n1.5-m RTT-150 telescope (T\\\"{U}B\\.{I}TAK National Observatory, Antalya, Turkey)\nand 2.4-m Hiltner Telescope (MDM Observatory, Kitt Peak, Arizona). Our\nspectroscopic results show that one of the two candidates of IGR J04069+5042\nand the one observed for IGR J06552-1146 could be active late-type stars in RS\nCVn systems. However, according to the likelihood analysis based on Chandra and\nINTEGRAL, two optically weaker sources in the INTEGRAL error circle of IGR\nJ06552-1146 have higher probabilities to be the actual counterpart. The\ncandidate counterparts of IGR J21188+4901 are classified as an active M-type\nstar and a late-type star. Among the optical spectra of four candidates of IGR\nJ22014+6034, two show H\\alpha emission lines, one is a late-type star and the\nother is a M type. The likelihood analysis favors a candidate with no\ndistinguishing features in the optical spectrum. Two of the candidates\nclassified as M type dwarfs are similar to some IGR candidates claimed to be\nsymbiotic stars. However, some of the prominent features of symbiotic systems\nare missing in our spectra, and their NIR colors are not consistent with those\nexpected for giants. We consider the IR colors of all IGR candidates claimed to\nbe symbiotic systems and find that low resolution optical spectrum may not be\nenough for conclusive identification.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 12 figures; accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

In the limit $n\\to\\infty$, it is well known\n(see [Ann. Appl. Probab. 7 (1997) 110-120]) that, when the variance of the\nproposal scales inversely proportional to the dimension $n$ whereas time is\naccelerated by the factor $n$, a diffusive limit is obtained for each component\nof the Markov chain if this chain starts at equilibrium. This paper extends\nthis result when the initial distribution is not the target probability\nmeasure. Remarking that the interaction between the components of the chain due\nto the common acceptance/rejection of the proposed moves is of mean-field type,\nwe obtain a propagation of chaos result under the same scaling as in the\nstationary case. This proves that, in terms of the dimension $n$, the same\nscaling holds for the transient phase of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm as\nnear stationarity. The diffusive and mean-field limit of each component is a\ndiffusion process nonlinear in the sense of McKean. This opens the route to new\ninvestigations of the optimal choice for the variance of the proposal\ndistribution in order to accelerate convergence to equilibrium (see [Optimal\nscaling for the transient phase of Metropolis-Hastings algorithms: The longtime\nbehavior Bernoulli (2014) To appear]).\n","Comment: Published at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/14-AAP1048 in the Annals of\n  Applied Probability (http://www.imstat.org/aap/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)"]}]

The setup has been designed\nfor the detection of the electric field strength of air showers initiated by\nultra-high energy cosmic rays, without using an auxiliary trigger from another\ndetection system. Installed in December 2006, RAuger was terminated in May 2010\nafter 65 registered coincidences with the SD. The sky map in local angular\ncoordinates (i.e., zenith and azimuth angles) of these events reveals a strong\nazimuthal asymmetry which is in agreement with a mechanism dominated by a\ngeomagnetic emission process. The correlation between the electric field and\nthe energy of the primary cosmic ray is presented for the first time, in an\nenergy range covering two orders of magnitude between 0.1 EeV and 10 EeV. It is\ndemonstrated that this setup is relatively more sensitive to inclined showers,\nwith respect to the SD. In addition to these results, which underline the\npotential of the radio-detection technique, important information about the\ngeneral behavior of self-triggering radio-detection systems has been obtained.\nIn particular, we will discuss radio self-triggering under varying local\nelectric-field conditions.\n","Comment: accepted for publication in JINST"]}]

To construct and interpret the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of BL Lacertae objects, simultaneous broad-band observations\nare mandatory. Aims. We present the results of a dedicated multi-wavelength\nstudy of the high-frequency peaked BL Lacertae (HBL) object and known TeV\nemitter 1ES 2344+514 by means of a pre-organised campaign. Methods. The\nobservations were conducted during simultaneous visibility windows of MAGIC and\nAGILE in late 2008. The measurements were complemented by Mets\\\"ahovi,\nRATAN-600, KVA+Tuorla, Swift and VLBA pointings. Additional coverage was\nprovided by the ongoing long-term F-GAMMA and MOJAVE programs, the OVRO 40-m\nand CrAO telescopes as well as the Fermi satellite. The obtained SEDs are\nmodelled using a one-zone as well as a self-consistent two-zone synchrotron\nself-Compton model. Results. 1ES 2344+514 was found at very low flux states in\nboth X-rays and very high energy gamma rays. Variability was detected in the\nlow frequency radio and X-ray bands only, where for the latter a small flare\nwas observed. The X-ray flare was possibly caused by shock acceleration\ncharacterised by similar cooling and acceleration time scales. MOJAVE VLBA\nmonitoring reveals a static jet whose components are stable over time scales of\neleven years, contrary to previous findings. There appears to be no significant\ncorrelation between the 15 GHz and R-band monitoring light curves. The\nobservations presented here constitute the first multi-wavelength campaign on\n1ES 2344+514 from radio to VHE energies and one of the few simultaneous SEDs\nduring low activity states. The quasi-simultaneous Fermi-LAT data poses some\nchallenges for SED modelling, but in general the SEDs are described well by\nboth applied models. The resulting parameters are typical for TeV emitting\nHBLs. Consequently it remains unclear whether a so-called quiescent state was\nfound in this campaign.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 20 figures, 10 tables, accepted for publication by A&A"]}]

The p_T of the\nphoton is an excellent approximation to the initial p_T of the jet and the\nratio z_T=p_T^h/p_T^\\gamma is used as a proxy for the jet fragmentation\nfunction. A statistical subtraction is used to extract the direct photon-hadron\nyields in Au+Au collisions while a photon isolation cut is applied in p+p. I_\nAA, the ratio of jet fragment yield in Au+Au to that in p+p, indicates\nmodification of the jet fragmentation function. Suppression, most likely due to\nenergy loss in the medium, is seen at high z_T. The fragment yield at low z_T\nis enhanced at large angles. Such a trend is expected from redistribution of\nthe lost energy into increased production of low-momentum particles.\n","Comment: 562 authors, 70 insitutions, 8 pages, and 3 figures.

Two families of procedures are dedicated to extracting this area: on\nthe one hand, post mortem measurements that require residual imprint imaging,\nand on the other hand, direct methods that only rely on the load vs. the\npenetration depth curve. With the development of built-in scanning probe\nmicroscopy imaging capabilities such as atomic force microscopy and indentation\ntip scanning probe microscopy, last generation indentation devices have made\nsystematic residual imprint imaging much faster and more reliable. In this\npaper, a new post mortem method is introduced and further compared to three\nexisting classical direct methods by means of a numerical and experimental\nbenchmark covering a large range of materials. It is shown that the new method\nsystematically leads to lower error levels regardless of the type of material.\nPros and cons of the new method vs. direct methods are also discussed,\ndemonstrating its efficiency in easily extracting mechanical properties with an\nenhanced confidence.\n"]}]

The mid-IR environment is unresolved by a 8m telescope and the\nMIDI spectrum exhibits a level similar to the ISO spectra recorded 10 yr ago.\nThe estimated Gaussian HWHM of the shell of 12AU in the 8-9$\\mu$m range, and\n18AU in the 11-12$\\mu$m range, are much smaller than the angular separation\nbetween the Mira and the White Dwarf of 60AU. The discrepancies between the\nHWHM at different angle orientations suggest an increasing level of asymmetry\nfrom 13 to 8$\\mu$m. The observations are well fitted by the densest and\nsmallest model published in the literature based on the ISO data, although such\na model does not account for the variations of near-IR photometry due to the\nMira pulsation cycle suggesting a much smaller optical thickness. These\nobservations also discard the two shells models, developed to take into account\nthe effect of the WD illumination onto the dusty wind of the Mira.

By observing more than 40 nodes in instrumented\nprivate torrents, we validate three protocol properties that, though believed\nto hold, have not been previously demonstrated experimentally: the clustering\nof similar-bandwidth peers, the effectiveness of BitTorrent's sharing\nincentives, and the peers' high uplink utilization. In addition, we observe\nthat BitTorrent's modified choking algorithm in seed state provides uniform\nservice to all peers, and that an underprovisioned initial seed leads to\nabsence of peer clustering and less effective sharing incentives. Based on our\nresults, we provide guidelines for seed provisioning by content providers, and\ndiscuss a tracker protocol extension that addresses an identified limitation of\nthe protocol.\n","Comment: This article is the author version of a paper accepted at ACM\n  SIGMETRICS'2007.
