Along the way, several novel\nresults are presented, including: a generalization of a theorem by Fine\nconnecting the existence of a joint distribution over outcomes of\ncounterfactual measurements to the existence of a noncontextual model; a\ngeneralization of Klyachko's proof of the Kochen-Specker theorem; a proof of\nthe Kochen-Specker theorem in the style of Hardy's proof of Bell's theorem; a\ncategorization of contextual and Bell-nonlocal correlations in terms of\nfrustrated networks; a new inequality testing preparation noncontextuality; and\nlastly, some results on the joint measurability of POVMs and the question of\nwhether these can be modeled noncontextually.

Current solutions\nderive these keys solely from user-chosen passwords, which have low entropy and\nare easily guessed.\n  We present OmniShare, the first scheme to allow client-side encryption with\nhigh-entropy keys whilst providing an intuitive key distribution mechanism to\nenable access from multiple client devices. Instead of passwords, we use low\nbandwidth uni-directional out-of-band (OOB) channels, such as QR codes, to\nauthenticate new devices. To complement these OOB channels, the cloud storage\nitself is used as a communication channel between devices in our protocols. We\nrely on a directory-based key hierarchy with individual file keys to limit the\nconsequences of key compromise and allow efficient sharing of files without\nrequiring re-encryption. OmniShare is open source software and currently\navailable for Android and Windows with other platforms in development. We\ndescribe the design and implementation of OmniShare, and explain how we\nevaluated its security using formal methods, its performance via real-world\nbenchmarks, and its usability through a cognitive walkthrough.\n"]}]

The evolution of a\ndynamic complex system is typically represented as a sequence of snapshots,\nwhere each snapshot describes the configuration of the system at a particular\ninstant of time. Then, one may directly follow how the snapshots evolve in\ntime, or aggregate the snapshots within some time intervals to form\nrepresentative \"slices\" of the evolution of the system configuration. This is\noften done with constant intervals, whose duration is based on arguments on the\nnature of the system and of its dynamics. A more refined approach would be to\nconsider the rate of activity in the system to perform a separation of\ntimescales. However, an even better alternative would be to define dynamic\nintervals that match the evolution of the system's configuration. To this end,\nwe propose a method that aims at detecting evolutionary changes in the\nconfiguration of a complex system, and generates intervals accordingly. We show\nthat evolutionary timescales can be identified by looking for peaks in the\nsimilarity between the sets of events on consecutive time intervals of data.\nTests on simple toy models reveal that the technique is able to detect\nevolutionary timescales of time-varying data both when the evolution is smooth\nas well as when it changes sharply.

For the\noptimal control, which requires running multiple propagations to determine the\noptimal pulse sequence, we used the computationally inexpensive time-dependent\nconfiguration interaction singles (TDCIS) method. TDCIS captures all of the\nnecessary correlation of the desired processes but assumes that ionization\npathways reached via double excitations are not present. MCTDHF includes these\npathways and all multiparticle correlations in a set of time-dependent\norbitals. The mechanism that was determined to be optimal in the Raman\nexcitation of the Ne $1s^22s^22p^53p^1$ valence state via the metastable\n$1s^22s^12p^63p^1$ resonance state involves a sequential resonance-valence\nexcitation. First, a long pump pulse excites the core-hole state, and then a\nshorter Stokes pulse transfers the population to the valence state. This\nprocess represents the first step in a multidimensional x-ray spectroscopy\nscheme that will provide a local probe of valence electronic correlations.\nAlthough at the optimal pulse intensities at the TDCIS level of theory the\nMCTDHF method predicts multiple ionization of the atom, at slightly lower\nintensities (reduced by a factor of about 4) the TDCIS mechanism is shown to\nhold qualitatively. Quantitatively, the MCTDHF populations are reduced from the\nTDCIS calculations by a factor of 4.\n"]}]

The intra-cluster\nvariations present in each cluster corresponding to each class are then\npreserved using symbolic interval data. Thus referenced logo images are\nrepresented in the form of interval data. A sample logo image is then\nclassified using suitable symbolic classifier. For experimentation purpose,\nrelatively large amount of color logo images is created consisting of 5044 logo\nimages. The classification results are validated with the help of accuracy,\nprecision, recall, F-measure, and time. To check the efficacy of the proposed\nmodel, the comparative analyses are given against the other models. The results\nshow that the proposed model outperforms the other models with respect to time\nand F-measure.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables, Proceedings of International\n  Conference on Computer Vision and Image Processing (CVIP 2016). arXiv admin\n  note: text overlap with arXiv:1609.01414"]}]

When the input graph is unbalanced, the problem is solved via matroid\nintersection. This result can be extended to the minimum cost version in which\neach potential edge has individual cost to be added.

The method is pressure-based and semi-implicit and\nis able to deal with all Mach number flows. In our scheme, the discrete\npressure is defined on the primal grid, while the discrete velocity field and\nthe density are defined on a face-based staggered dual grid. All convective\nterms are discretized explicitly, while the pressure terms appearing in the\nmomentum and energy equation are discretized implicitly. Substitution of the\nmomentum equation into the energy equation yields a linear system for the\nscalar pressure as the only unknown. The enthalpy and the kinetic energy are\ntaken explicitly and are then updated using a simple Picard procedure. Thanks\nto the use of a staggered grid, the final pressure system is a very sparse\nblock five-point system for three dimensional problems. The viscous terms and\nthe heat flux are also discretized making use of the staggered grid by defining\nthe viscous stress tensor and the heat flux vector on the dual grid, which\ncorresponds to the use of a lifting operator on the dual grid. The time step of\nour new numerical method is limited by a CFL condition based only on the fluid\nvelocity and not on the sound speed.

To perform these measurements the GAMMA-400\ngamma-ray telescope possesses unique physical characteristics for energy range\nfrom ~20 MeV to ~1000 GeV in comparison with previous and current space and\nground-based experiments. The major advantage of the GAMMA-400 instrument is\nexcellent angular and energy resolutions for gamma-rays above 10 GeV. The\ngamma-ray telescope angular and energy resolutions for the main aperture at\n100-GeV gamma rays are ~0.01 deg and ~1%, respectively. The special goal is to\nimprove physical characteristics in the low- energy range from ~20 MeV to 100\nMeV. Minimizing the amount of dead matter in the telescope aperture allows us\nto obtain the angular and energy resolutions better in this range than in\ncurrent space missions. The gamma-ray telescope angular resolution at 50-MeV\ngamma rays is better than 5 deg and energy resolution is ~10%.

The appearance and penetration depth of the Flexo-SW is ruled by the\nflexocoupling strength. In particular the penetration depth of transverse\nacoustic mode diverges in the absence of the flexoelectric coupling and so\nthese waves become indistinguishable from the bulk waves. For paraelectrics\nsuch as strontium titanate with typical flexoeletric coefficients (~2V) the\npenetration depth of the Flexo-SW can reach more than tens microns at THz\nfrequencies. The circumstances can explain the absence of experimental\nobservations of the missed surface waves in thick layers and bulk materials.\nHowever we predict that the peaks of neutron intensity corresponding to the\nsurface Flexo-SW and bulk phonon modes can be separated in non-piezoelectric\nthin films of thickness ~(20 - 50)nm.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 6 figures, including Supplement"]}]

The\nmeasurements of heavier secondaries at low energies therefore make it very\nproblematical that a nested LBM with more than a few 0.1 g/cm2 or more of\nmatter near the sources could be the source of the large B abundance seen by\nVoyager.

This work provides the first neural network-based approach to\nargumentation mining, focusing on the two tasks of extracting links between\nargument components, and classifying types of argument components. In order to\nsolve this problem, we propose to use a joint model that is based on a Pointer\nNetwork architecture.

Recent achievements include the proof of the statistical consistency\nof these kernel- based approaches. Parallel to this, many different system\nidentification techniques have been developed but the interaction with machine\nlearning does not appear so strong yet. One reason is that the RKHSs usually\nemployed in machine learning do not embed the information available on dynamic\nsystems, e.g. BIBO stability. In addition, in system identification the\nindependent data assumptions routinely adopted in machine learning are never\nsatisfied in practice. This paper provides new results which strengthen the\nconnection between system identification and machine learning. Our starting\npoint is the introduction of RKHSs of dynamic systems. They contain functionals\nover spaces defined by system inputs and allow to interpret system\nidentification as learning from examples. In both linear and nonlinear\nsettings, it is shown that this perspective permits to derive in a relatively\nsimple way conditions on RKHS stability (i.e. the property of containing only\nBIBO stable systems or predictors), also facilitating the design of new kernels\nfor system identification.

Classically, gradient descent has been a sequential and\nsynchronous process, although distributed and asynchronous variants have been\nstudied since the 1980s. Coordinate descent is a commonly studied version of\ngradient descent. In this paper, we focus on asynchronous coordinate descent on\nconvex functions $F:\\mathbb{R}^n\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ of the form $F(x) = f(x)\n+ \\sum_{k=1}^n \\Psi_k(x_k)$, where $f:\\mathbb{R}^n\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ is a\nsmooth convex function, and each $\\Psi_k:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ is a\nunivariate and possibly non-smooth convex function. Such functions occur in\nmany data analysis and machine learning problems.\n  We give new analyses of cyclic coordinate descent, a parallel asynchronous\nstochastic coordinate descent, and a rather general worst-case parallel\nasynchronous coordinate descent. For all of these, we either obtain sharply\nimproved bounds, or provide the first analyses. Our analyses all use a common\namortized framework. The application of this framework to the asynchronous\nstochastic version requires some new ideas, for it is not obvious how to ensure\na uniform distribution where it is needed in the face of asynchronous actions\nthat may undo uniformity. We believe that our approach may well be applicable\nto the analysis of other iterative asynchronous stochastic processes.\n  We extend the framework to show that an asynchronous version of tatonnement,\na fundamental price dynamic widely studied in general equilibrium theory,\nconverges toward a market equilibrium for Fisher markets with CES utilities or\nLeontief utilities, for which tatonnement is equivalent to coordinate descent.\n","Comment: 41 pages"]}]

But according to wave-particle duality, we know a free\nparticle can behave like a wave. Is there a wave property that corresponds to\nthe mass of a particle? This is an interesting question that has not been\nextensively explored before. We suggest that this problem can be approached by\ntreating the mass on the same footing as energy and momentum. Here we propose\nthat, all particles are excitation waves of the vacuum and different particles\nare represented by different excitation modes. Based on such a model, we found\nthat mass is not an intrinsic property of the particle. Instead, mass is\nbasically a measure of the particle energy. The relations between energy and\nmass can be directly derived based on the wave properties of the particle. This\nwork explains why some particles are \"wave-like\" while others are\n\"particle-like\". Furthermore, this work has several interesting implications.\nIt directly explains why photons can interact with a gravitational field. It\nalso suggests a possible origin of dark matter; they are thought to be composed\nof excitation waves that fail to interact with each other. From this model, one\ncan easily see why our universe has more dark matters than visible matters.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 8 figures. 1 table"]}]

Our proofs are based on a weighted all-pairs inner product\nargument.\n  In addition to our lower bound results, we give a quantum algorithm for\nordered searching using roughly 0.631 \\log_2(N) oracle accesses. Our algorithm\nuses a quantum routine for traversing through a binary search tree faster than\nclassically, and it is of a nature very different from a faster algorithm due\nto Farhi, Goldstone, Gutmann, and Sipser.\n","Comment: This new version contains new results.
