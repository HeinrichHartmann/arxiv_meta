The collection\n$(\\omega_x(j))_{x\\in\\mathbb{Z},n\\ge 0}$ is sometimes called the \"cookie\nenvironment\" due to the following informal interpretation. Upon each visit to a\nsite the walker eats a cookie from the cookie stack at that site and chooses\nthe transition probabilities according to the \"strength\" of the cookie eaten.\nWe assume that the cookie stacks are i.i.d. and that the cookie \"strengths\"\nwithin the stack $(\\omega_x(j))_{j\\ge 0}$ at site $x$ follow a finite state\nMarkov chain. Thus, the environment at each site is dynamic, but it evolves\naccording to the local time of the walk at each site rather than the original\nrandom walk time.\n  The model admits two different regimes, critical or non-critical, depending\non whether the expected probability to jump to the right (or left) under the\ninvariant measure for the Markov chain is equal to $1/2$ or not. We show that\nin the non-critical regime the walk is always transient, has non-zero linear\nspeed, and satisfies the classical central limit theorem. The critical regime\nallows for a much more diverse behavior. We give necessary and sufficient\nconditions for recurrence/transience and ballisticity of the walk in the\ncritical regime as well as a complete characterization of limit laws under the\naveraged measure in the transient case.\n  The setting considered in this paper generalizes the previously studied model\nwith periodic cookie stacks. Our results on ballisticity and limit theorems are\nnew even for the periodic model.\n","Comment: 42 pages, 2 figures.

The queries may be chosen adversarially from a\nlarger set Q of allowable queries in one of three ways, which we list in order\nfrom easiest to hardest to answer:\n  Offline: The queries are chosen all at once and the differentially private\nmechanism answers the queries in a single batch.\n  Online: The queries are chosen all at once, but the mechanism only receives\nthe queries in a streaming fashion and must answer each query before seeing the\nnext query.\n  Adaptive: The queries are chosen one at a time and the mechanism must answer\neach query before the next query is chosen. In particular, each query may\ndepend on the answers given to previous queries.\n  Many differentially private mechanisms are just as efficient in the adaptive\nmodel as they are in the offline model. Meanwhile, most lower bounds for\ndifferential privacy hold in the offline setting. This suggests that the three\nmodels may be equivalent.\n  We prove that these models are all, in fact, distinct. Specifically, we show\nthat there is a family of statistical queries such that exponentially more\nqueries from this family can be answered in the offline model than in the\nonline model. We also exhibit a family of search queries such that\nexponentially more queries from this family can be answered in the online model\nthan in the adaptive model.
