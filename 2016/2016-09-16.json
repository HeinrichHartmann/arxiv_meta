For C/O WDs, the\nradial composition profile of the disk evolves self-similarly in a\nquasi-steady-state manner, and is remarkably robust to model parameters. The\nnucleosynthesis in helium WD disks does not exhibit this behavior, which\ninstead depends sensitively on factors controlling the disk midplane density\n(e.g. the strength of the viscosity, $\\alpha$). By the end of the simulation, a\nsubstantial fraction of the WD mass is unbound in outflows at characteristic\nvelocities of $\\sim 10^9~{\\rm cm~s}^{-1}$. The outflows from WD-NS merger disks\ncontain $10^{-4}-3 \\times 10^{-3} M_\\odot$ of radioactive $^{56}$Ni, resulting\nin fast ($\\sim$ week long) dim ($\\sim10^{40}~{\\rm erg~s}^{-1}$) optical\ntransients; shock heating of the ejecta by late time outflows may increase the\npeak luminosity to $\\sim 10^{43}~{\\rm erg~s}^{-1}$. The accreted mass onto the\nneutron star is probably not sufficient to induce gravitational collapse, but\nmay be capable of spinning up the NS to periods of $\\sim 10~{\\rm ms}$.

The\nprocess of collapse is described by the radial evolution in the dual\nholographic theory. If the theory is in the same phase as the assumed IR fixed\npoint, the initial state is smoothly projected to the final state. If in a\ndifferent phase, the initial state undergoes a phase transition which in turn\ngives rise to a horizon in the bulk geometry. We demonstrate the connection\nbetween critical behavior and horizon in an example, by deriving the bulk\nmetrics that emerge in various phases of the U(N) vector model in the large N\nlimit based on the holographic dual constructed from quantum RG. The gapped\nphase exhibits a geometry that smoothly ends at a finite proper distance in the\nradial direction. The geometric distance in the radial direction measures a\ncomplexity : the depth of RG transformation that is needed to project the\ngenerally entangled UV state to a direct product state in the IR. For gapless\nstates, entanglement persistently spreads out to larger length scales, and the\ninitial state can not be projected to the direct product state. The obstruction\nto smooth projection at charge neutral point manifests itself as the long\nthroat in the anti-de Sitter space. The Poincare horizon at infinity marks the\ncritical point which exhibits a divergent length scale in the spread of\nentanglement. For the gapless states with non-zero chemical potential, the bulk\nspace becomes the Lifshitz geometry with the dynamical critical exponent two.\nThe identification of horizon as critical point may provide an explanation for\nthe universality of horizon.

The basic idea is to reduce the system\nwith varying domains to one in a fixed domain.

Well-posedness results can\nthen often be established as soon as it is proved that the relevant\nlinearization is the generator of an analytic semigroup or admits maximal\nregularity.

The base flow velocity profile is fully\nnon-parallel and non-similar in nature. The boundary layer grows continuously\nin the spatial directions. Linearized Navier-Stokes(LNS) equations are derived\nfor the disturbance flow quantities in the cylindrical polar coordinates. The\nLNS equations along with homogeneous boundary conditions forms a generalized\neigenvalues problem. Since the base flow is axisymmetric, the disturbances are\nperiodic in azimuthal direction. Chebyshev spectral collocation method and\nArnoldi's iterative algorithm is used for the solution of the general\neigenvalues problem. The global temporal modes are computed for the range of\nReynolds numbers and different azimuthal wave numbers. The largest imaginary\npart of the computed eigenmodes are negative and hence the flow is temporally\nstable. The spatial structure of the eigenmodes shows that the flow is\nconvectively unstable because the disturbance amplitudes grow in size and\nmagnitude when moving towards downstream. The global modes of axisymmetric\nboundary layer are more stable than that of 2D flat plate boundary layer at low\nReynolds number.

In this paper we ask\nwhether an analogous result holds for iterated function systems (IFS's). We say\nthat an IFS is approximation regular if we observe Khintchine type behaviour,\ni.e., if the size of certain limsup sets defined using the IFS is determined by\nthe convergence/divergence of naturally occurring sums. We prove that an IFS is\napproximation regular if it consists of conformal mappings and satisfies the\nstrong separation condition, or if it is a collection of similarities and\nsatisfies the open set condition. The divergence condition we introduce\nincorporates the inhomogeneity present within the IFS. We demonstrate via an\nexample that such an approach is essential. We also formulate an analogue of\nthe Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture and show that it holds for a set of full\nHausdorff dimension.\n  Combining our results with the mass transference principle of Beresnevich and\nVelani \\cite{BerVel}, we prove a general result that implies the existence of\nexceptional points within the attractor of our IFS. These points are\nexceptional in the sense that they are \"very well approximated\".

By the means of factors, we\nare able to handle larger vocabulary and reduce the training time (for systems\nwith equivalent target language vocabulary size). In addition, we can produce\nnew words that are not in the vocabulary. We use a morphological analyser to\nget a factored representation of each word (lemmas, Part of Speech tag, tense,\nperson, gender and number). We have extended the NMT approach with attention\nmechanism in order to have two different outputs, one for the lemmas and the\nother for the rest of the factors. The final translation is built using some\n\\textit{a priori} linguistic information. We compare our extension with a\nword-based NMT system. The experiments, performed on the IWSLT'15 dataset\ntranslating from English to French, show that while the performance do not\nalways increase, the system can manage a much larger vocabulary and\nconsistently reduce the OOV rate.

Our studies uncover qualitative similarities to the results on\nhydrodynamization in strongly coupled gauge theories.

The asymptotic character of the hydrodynamic gradient expansion is\ncrucial for the recently discovered applicability of hydrodynamics at large\ngradients.
