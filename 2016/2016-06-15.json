(1) They start as rare\ndensity peaks that experience very fast and nearly radial infall. This radial\ninfall brings mass closer to the center producing a high concentrated halo.\nHere, the halo concentration increases with the increasing halo mass and the\nconcentration is defined by the alpha parameter with nearly constant core\nradius. Later halos slide into (2) the plateau regime where the accretion\nbecomes less radial, but frequent mergers still affect even the central region.\nNow the concentration does not depend on halo mass.

The sensitivity analysis considers different\naggregations of local units for which data are given by the Population Census.\nWe produce a large variety of definitions of cities (approximatively 5000) by\naggregating local Census units corresponding to the systematic combination of\nthree definitional criteria: density, commuting flows and population cutoffs.\nWe then measure the magnitude of scaling estimations and their sensitivity to\ncity definitions for several urban indicators, showing for example that simple\npopulation cutoffs impact dramatically on the results obtained for a given\nsystem and attribute. Variations are interpreted with respect to the meaning of\nthe attributes (socio-economic descriptors as well as infrastructure) and the\nurban definitions used (understood as the combination of the three criteria).\nBecause of the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem and of the heterogeneous\nmorphologies and social landscapes in the cities internal space, scaling\nestimations are subject to large variations, distorting many of the conclusions\non which generative models are based.

In\nparticular, we address its subtle issues as well. Unlike the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard model (MSSM), the Next to MSSM (NMSSM) can be scale\ninvariant and has no mass parameter in its Lagrangian before SUSY and gauge\nsymmetry breakings. Therefore, the NMSSM is a perfect framework for\nsuper-natural SUSY. To give the SUSY breaking soft mass to the singlet, we\nconsider the moduli and dilaton dominant SUSY breaking scenarios in M-theory on\n$S^1/Z_2$. In these scenarios, SUSY is broken by one and only one $F$-term of\nmoduli or dilaton, and the SUSY breaking soft terms can be determined via the\nK\\\"ahler potential and superpotential from Calabi-Yau compactification of\nM-theory on $S^1/Z_2$. Thus, as predicted by super-natural SUSY, the SUSY\nelectroweak fine-tuning measure is of unity order. In the moduli dominant SUSY\nbreaking scenario, the right-handed sleptons are relatively light around 1 TeV,\nstau can be even as light as 580 GeV and degenerate with the lightest\nneutralino, chargino masses are larger than 1 TeV, the light stop masses are\naround 2 TeV or larger, the first two-generation squark masses are about 3 TeV\nor larger, and gluinos are heavier than squarks. In the dilaton dominant SUSY\nbreaking scenario, the qualitative picture remain the same but we have heavier\nspectra as compared to moduli dominant SUSY breaking scenario. In addition to\nit, we have Higgs $H_{2}/A_{1}$-resonance solutions for dark matter (DM). In\nboth scenarios, the minimal value of DM relic density is about 0.2. To obtain\nthe observed DM relic density, we can consider the dilution effect from\nsupercritical string cosmology or introduce the axino as the lightest\nsupersymmetric particle.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 12 figures and two tables"]}]

The latter includes a\nlogarithmic ultraviolet (UV) divergence, which we show cancels against an\ninfrared (IR) singularity found in the (conservative) near zone.

Put simply, the TBTF problem consists of the fact that it is\ndifficult to explain both the measured kinematics of dwarfs and their observed\nnumber density within the LCDM framework. The most popular proposed solutions\nto the problem involve baryonic feedback processes. For example, reionization\nand baryon depletion can decrease the abundance of halos that are expected to\nhost dwarf galaxies. Moreover, feedback related to star formation can alter the\ndark matter density profile in the central regions of low-mass halos. In this\narticle we assess the TBTF problem for field dwarfs, taking explicitly into\naccount the baryonic effects mentioned above. We find that 1) reionization\nfeedback cannot resolve the TBTF problem on its own, because the halos in\nquestion are too massive to be affected by it, and that 2) the degree to which\nprofile modification can be invoked as a solution to the TBTF problem depends\non the radius at which galactic kinematics are measured. Based on a literature\nsample of about 90 dwarfs with interferometric observations in the 21cm line of\natomic hydrogen (HI), we conclude that the TBTF problem persists despite\nbaryonic effects. However, the preceding statement assumes that the sample\nunder consideration is representative of the general population of field\ndwarfs. In addition, the unexplained excess of dwarf galaxies in LCDM could be\nas small as a factor of ~ 1.8, given the current uncertainties in the\nmeasurement of the galactic velocity function.

Here we\naddress this question from the perspective of the inverse scattering transform\n(IST) method that relies on the integrable nature of the wave equation. We\ndevelop a conceptually new approach to the RW classification in which\nappropriate, locally coherent structures are specifically isolated from a\nglobally incoherent wave train to be subsequently analyzed by implementing a\nnumerical IST procedure relying on a spatial periodization of the object under\nconsideration. Using this approach we extend the existing classifications of\nthe prototypes of RWs from standard breathers and their collisions to more\ngeneral nonlinear modes characterized by their nonlinear spectra.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 5 figures"]}]

In such a case, the magnetic metasurface inside a waveguide\nworks as an efficient reflector, as the energy absorption in the metasurface is\nsmall, and most of the electromagnetic energy inside the non-propagation band\ngap is reflected.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 4 figures"]}]

We investigate the significance of the detection of an elongated\nshape in the MIR emission by fitting elongated Gaussian models to the\ninterferometric data at 12 um.

This paper marks\nthe first release of the XXL point source catalogue selected in the 2-10 keV\nenergy band with limiting flux\n$F_{2-10keV}=4.8\\cdot10^{-14}\\rm{erg\\,s^{-1}\\,cm^{-2}}$. We use both public and\nproprietary data sets to identify the counterparts of the X-ray point-like\nsources and improved upon the photometric redshift determination for AGN by\napplying a Random Forest classification trained to identify for each object the\noptimal photometric redshift model library. We also assign a probability to\neach source to be a star or an outlier. We model with Bayesian analysis the\nX-ray spectra assuming a power-law model with the presence of an absorbing\nmedium. We find an average unabsorbed photon index of $\\Gamma=1.85$ and average\nhydrogen column density $\\log{N_{H}}=21.07 cm^{-2}$. We find no trend of\n$\\Gamma$ or $N_H$ with redshift and a fraction of 26% absorbed sources ($\\log\nN_{H}>22$). We show that the XXL-1000-AGN number counts extended the number\ncounts of the COSMOS survey to higher fluxes and are fully consistent with the\nEuclidean expectation. We constrain the intrinsic luminosity function of AGN in\nthe 2-10 keV energy band where the unabsorbed X-ray flux is estimated from the\nX-ray spectral fit up to z=3. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of a\nsupercluster size structure at redshift 0.14, identified by means of\npercolation analysis of the XXL-1000-AGN sample. The XXL survey, reaching a\nmedium flux limit and covering a wide area is a stepping stone between current\ndeep fields and planned wide area surveys.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 20 figures, 120 figures in the appendix, accepted for\n  publication in A&A"]}]

A related problem is the difference in the\nmagnitudes between the on-dot and interdot strengths for capacitively coupled\nquantum dots. Here we examine both factors, based on a two site Anderson model,\nusing the numerical renormalization group to calculate the local spectral\ndensities on the dots and the renormalized parameters that specify the low\nenergy fixed point. Our results support the conclusions of Tosi et al. that low\nenergy SU(4) symmetry can be restored, but asymptotically achieved only if the\ninter-dot interaction $U_{12}$ is greater than or of the order of the band\nwidth of the coupled conduction bath $D$, which might be difficult to achieve\nexperimentally. By comparing the SU(4) Kondo results for a total dot occupation\n$n_{\\rm tot}=1$ and $n_{\\rm tot}=2$ we conclude that the temperature dependence\nof the conductance is largely determined by the constraints of the Friedel sum\nrule rather than the SU(4) symmetry and suggest that an initial increase of the\nconductance with temperature is a distinguishing characteristic feature of an\n$n_{\\rm tot}=1$ universal SU(4) fixed point.\n","Comment: 14 pages and 20 figures"]}]

Following this anomalous state, the\nflux and variability of the broad emission lines returned to a more normal\nstate. This transient behavior, characterised by significant deficits in flux\nand equivalent width of the strong broad UV emission lines, is the first of its\nkind to be unambiguously identified in an active galactic nucleus reverberation\nmapping campaign. The largest corresponding emission-line flux deficits\noccurred for the high-ionization collisionally excited lines, C IV and Si IV(+O\nIV]), and also He II(+O III]), while the anomaly in Ly-alpha was substantially\nsmaller.

To do so, one of the most popular methods\nconsists in combining the UV with the emission from the dust itself in the IR.\nYet, different studies have derived different estimators, showing that no such\nhybrid estimator is truly universal. In this paper we aim at understanding and\nquantifying what physical processes drive the variations between different\nhybrid estimators. Doing so, we aim at deriving new universal UV+IR hybrid\nestimators to correct the UV for dust attenuation, taking into account the\nintrinsic physical properties of galaxies. We use the CIGALE code to model the\nspatially-resolved FUV to FIR SED of eight nearby star-forming galaxies drawn\nfrom the KINGFISH sample. This allows us to determine their local physical\nproperties, and in particular their UV attenuation, average SFR, average\nspecific SFR (sSFR), and their stellar mass. We then examine how hybrid\nestimators depend on said properties. We find that hybrid UV+IR estimators\nstrongly depend on the stellar mass surface density (in particular at 70 and\n100 micron) and on the sSFR (in particular at 24 micron and the TIR).\nConsequently, the IR scaling coefficients for UV obscuration can vary by almost\nan order of magnitude. This result contrasts with other groups who found\nrelatively constant coefficients with small deviations. We exploit these\nvariations to construct a new class of hybrid estimators based on observed UV\nto near-IR colours and near-IR luminosity densities per unit area. We find that\nthey can reliably be extended to entire galaxies. The new estimators provide\nbetter estimates of attenuation-corrected UV emission than classical hybrid\nestimators. Naturally taking into account the variable impact of dust heated by\nold stellar populations, they constitute a step towards universal estimators.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables.

The intersection of the two dependences allows,\ntherefore, to determine simultaneously the white dwarf mass and the\nmagnetospheric radius. To verify the method we analyzed the archival Suzaku\nobservation of EX Hya obtaining M /M_sun= 0.73 \\pm 0.06 and R_ m / R = 2.6 \\pm\n0.4 consistent with the values determined by other authors.

Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are a common feature of the power\nspectrums of X-ray binaries. Currently it is not possible to unambiguously\ndifferentiate the large number of proposed models to explain these phenomena\nthrough existing observations.\n  Aims. We investigate the observable predictions of a simple model that\ngenerates flux modulation: a spiral instability rotating in a thin accretion\ndisk. This model is motivated by the accretion ejection instability (AEI) model\nfor low- frequency QPOs (LFQPOs). We are particularly interested in the\ninclination dependence of the observables that are associated with this model.\n  Methods. We develop a simple analytical model of an accretion disk, which\nfeatures a spiral instability. The disk is assumed to emit blackbody radiation,\nwhich is ray-traced to a distant observer. We compute pulse profiles and power\nspectra as observed from infinity.\n  Results. We show that the amplitude of the modulation associated with the\nspiral rotation is a strong function of inclination and frequency. The pulse\nprofile is quasi-sinusoidal only at low inclination (face-on source). As a\nconsequence, a higher-inclination geometry leads to a stronger and more diverse\nharmonic signature in the power spectrum.\n  Conclusions. We present how the amplitude depends on the inclination when the\nflux modulation comes from a spiral in the disk. We also include new\nobservables that could potentially differentiate between models, such as the\npulse profile and the harmonic content of the power spectra of high-inclination\nsources that exhibit LFQPOs.

Decrease in band gap\nuntil x = 0.5 is ascribed to the broadening of the oxygen p orbitals as a\nresult of the induced spin disorder due to Fe3+ and Cr3+ at B site. In\ncontrast, the increase in band gap above x = 0.5 is explained on the basis of\nthe reduction in the available unoccupied d - orbitals of Fe3+ at the\nconduction band.

One of the major\nchallenges lies in the lack of spatial and temporal cues, which makes it\ndifficult to deal with large variations of lighting conditions, viewing angles,\nbody poses and occlusions. Recently, several deep learning based person\nre-identification approaches have been proposed and achieved remarkable\nperformance. However, most of those approaches extract discriminative features\nfrom the whole frame at one glimpse without differentiating various parts of\nthe persons to identify. It is essentially important to examine multiple highly\ndiscriminative local regions of the person images in details through multiple\nglimpses for dealing with the large appearance variance. In this paper, we\npropose a new soft attention based model, i.e., the end to-end Comparative\nAttention Network (CAN), specifically tailored for the task of person\nre-identification. The end-to-end CAN learns to selectively focus on parts of\npairs of person images after taking a few glimpses of them and adaptively\ncomparing their appearance. The CAN model is able to learn which parts of\nimages are relevant for discerning persons and automatically integrates\ninformation from different parts to determine whether a pair of images belongs\nto the same person. In other words, our proposed CAN model simulates the human\nperception process to verify whether two images are from the same person.\nExtensive experiments on three benchmark person re-identification datasets,\nincluding CUHK01, CHUHK03 and Market-1501, clearly demonstrate that our\nproposed end-to-end CAN for person re-identification outperforms well\nestablished baselines significantly and offer new state-of-the-art performance.\n"]}]

Therefore, in\nthis paper, we will argue that neural networks modeling continuous time are\nneeded explicitly for this purpose, because with them the synthesis and\nanalysis of continuous and possibly periodic processes in time are possible\n(e.g. for robot behavior) besides computing discrete classification functions\n(e.g. for logical reasoning). We will relate possible neural network\narchitectures with (hybrid) automata models that allow to express continuous\nprocesses.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 10 figures.

Of these, 75 host a nuclear X-ray source, a 58%\ndetection fraction. There is a highly significant correlation between nuclear\nX-ray luminosity LX and galaxy stellar mass Mstar with a slope of 1.7+/-0.3,\nand a tentative correlation (significant at the 2.8 sigma level) between LX and\nHI gas mass MHI. However, a joint fit to LX as a function of both Mstar and MHI\nfinds no significant dependence on MHI (slope 0.1+/00.3), and similarly the\nresiduals of LX-LX(Mstar) show no trend with MHI; the apparent correlation\nbetween LX and MHI seems to be entirely driven by Mstar.
