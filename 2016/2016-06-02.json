These\nadditional topological terms cannot be adiabatically turned off as long as $G$\nis unbroken. By investigating symmetry transformations for the TQFT partition\nfunction, we end up with the classification of SPTs that is consistent with the\nwell-known group cohomology approach. We also discuss how to gauge the global\nsymmetry and possible TQFT descriptions of Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theory.\n","Comment: 11 pages. Published version"]}]

Our\nmodel yields a power law solely defined by the fractal dimensionalities of the\nISM and accreting gas.

We find a whole range of different engulfment behaviors with some\nellipsoids engulfing faster than spheres, and that phagocytosis is able to\nengulf a greater range of target shapes than other types of endocytosis.\nFurther, the 2D model can explain why some nonspherical particles engulf\nfastest (not at all) when presented to the membrane tip-first (lying flat).

The delay associated with\nflushing and refilling of \\emph{O}(1) m-wide slots with ocean water causes\nerupted flux to lag tidal forcing and helps to buttress slots against closure,\nwhile tidally pumped in-slot flow leads to heating and mechanical disruption\nthat staves off slot freeze-out. Much narrower and much wider slots cannot be\nsustained. In the presence of long-lived slots, the 10$^6$-yr average power\noutput of the tiger stripes is buffered by a feedback between ice melt-back and\nsubsidence to \\emph{O}(10$^{10}$) W, which is similar to the observed power\noutput, suggesting long-term stability. Turbulent dissipation makes testable\npredictions for the final flybys of Enceladus by the \\emph{Cassini} spacecraft.\nOur model shows how open connections to an ocean can be reconciled with, and\nsustain, long-lived eruptions. Turbulent dissipation in long-lived slots helps\nmaintain the ocean against freezing, maintains access by future Enceladus\nmissions to ocean materials, and is plausibly the major energy source for tiger\nstripe activity.\n"]}]

Most\nolivine and enstatite present rare earth element (REE) patterns comparable to\ntheir counterparts in type I chondrules in ordinary chondrites. They thus\nlikely share a similar igneous origin, likely under similar redox conditions.\nThe mesostasis however frequently shows negative Eu and/or Yb (and more rarely\nSm) anomalies, evidently out of equilibrium with olivine and enstatite. We\nsuggest that this reflects crystallization of oldhamite during a sulfidation\nevent, already inferred by others, during which the mesostasis was molten,\nwhere the complementary positive Eu and Yb anomalies exhibited by oldhamite\nwould have possibly arisen due to a divalent state of these elements.

Introduction\nHow do the galaxy form, and when? How did the galaxy evolve and transform\nthemselves to create the diversity we observe? What are the progenitors to\npresent-day galaxies? To answer these big questions, observations throughout\nthe Universe and the physical modelisation are obvious tools. But between\nthese, there is a key process, without which it would be impossible to extract\nsome digestible information from the complexity of these systems. This is\nclassification. One century ago, galaxies were discovered by Hubble. From\nimages obtained in the visible range of wavelengths, he synthetised his\nobservations through the usual process: classification. With only one parameter\n(the shape) that is qualitative and determined with the eye, he found four\ncategories: ellipticals, spirals, barred spirals and irregulars. This is the\nfamous Hubble classification. He later hypothetized relationships between these\nclasses, building the Hubble Tuning Fork. The Hubble classification has been\nrefined, notably by de Vaucouleurs, and is still used as the only global\nclassification of galaxies. Even though the physical relationships proposed by\nHubble are not retained any more, the Hubble Tuning Fork is nearly always used\nto represent the classification of the galaxy diversity under its new name the\nHubble sequence (e.g. Delgado-Serrano, 2012). Its success is impressive and can\nbe understood by its simplicity, even its beauty, and by the many correlations\nfound between the morphology of galaxies and their other properties. And one\nmust admit that there is no alternative up to now, even though both the Hubble\nclassification and diagram have been recognised to be unsatisfactory. Among the\nmost obvious flaws of this classification, one must mention its monovariate,\nqualitative, subjective and old-fashioned nature, as well as the difficulty to\ncharacterise the morphology of distant galaxies. The first two most significant\nmultivariate studies were by Watanabe et al. (1985) and Whitmore (1984). Since\nthe year 2005, the number of studies attempting to go beyond the Hubble\nclassification has increased largely. Why, despite of this, the Hubble\nclassification and its sequence are still alive and no alternative have yet\nemerged (Sandage, 2005)? My feeling is that the results of the multivariate\nanalyses are not easily integrated into a one-century old practice of modeling\nthe observations. In addition, extragalactic objects like galaxies, stellar\nclusters or stars do evolve. Astronomy now provides data on very distant\nobjects, raising the question of the relationships between those and our\npresent day nearby galaxies. Clearly, this is a phylogenetic problem.\nAstrocladistics 1 aims at exploring the use of phylogenetic tools in\nastrophysics (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2006a,b). We have proved that Maximum\nParsimony (or cladistics) can be applied in astrophysics and provides a new\nexploration tool of the data (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2009, 2012, Cardone \\&\nFraix-Burnet, 2013). As far as the classification of galaxies is concerned, a\nlarger number of objects must now be analysed.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel approach to multi-label ZSL via concept embedding\nlearned from collections of public users' annotations of multimedia. Thanks to\nconcept embedding, multi-label ZSL can be done by efficiently mapping an\ninstance input features onto the concept embedding space in a similar manner\nused in single-label ZSL. Moreover, our semantic learning model is capable of\nembedding an out-of-vocabulary label by inferring its meaning from its\nco-occurring labels. Thus, our approach allows both seen and unseen labels\nduring the concept embedding learning to be used in the aforementioned instance\nmapping, which makes multi-label ZSL more flexible and suitable for real\napplications. Experimental results of multi-label ZSL on images and music\ntracks suggest that our approach outperforms a state-of-the-art multi-label ZSL\nmodel and can deal with a scenario involving out-of-vocabulary labels without\nre-training the semantics learning model.\n","Comment: 15 pages.

The different\ntypes of defects form electronic states that are spatially localized on the\ndefect. The strongly localized nature is reflected in weak electronic\ninteractions between individual point or line defect and a weak dependence of\nthe defect formation energy on the defect concentration or line defect\nseparation. In the electronic energy spectrum the defect states occur as deep\nlevels in the band gap, as shallow levels very close to the band edges, as well\nas levels in-between the bulk states. Due to their strongly localized nature,\nall states of point defects are sharply peaked in energy. Periodic line defects\nform nearly dispersionless one-dimensional band structures and the related\nspectral features are also strongly peaked. The electronic structure of the\nmonolayer system is quite robust and it is well preserved for point defect\nconcentrations of up to 6%.
