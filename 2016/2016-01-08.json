The system we analyze here consists of two\ncoupled quantum harmonic oscillators each interacting with its own bath\ndescribed by a scalar field, set at temperatures $T_1 > T_2$. For\n\\textit{constant bilinear inter-oscillator coupling} studied here (Case C1)\nowing to the Gaussian nature, the problem can be solved exactly at arbitrary\ntemperatures even for strong coupling. We find that the valid entanglement\ncriterion in general is not a function of the bath temperature difference, in\ncontrast to thermal transport in the same NESS setting [1]. Thus lowering the\ntemperature of one of the thermal baths does not necessarily help to safeguard\nthe entanglement between the oscillators. Indeed, quantum entanglement will\ndisappear if any one of the thermal baths has a temperature higher than the\ncritical temperature $T_c$. With the Langevin equations derived we give a full\ndisplay of how entanglement dynamics in this system depends on $T_{1}$, $T_{2}$\n, the inter-oscillator coupling and the system-bath coupling strengths. For\nweak oscillator-bath coupling the critical temperature $T_c$ is about the order\nof the inverse oscillator frequency, but for strong oscillator-bath coupling it\nwill depend on the bath cutoff frequency. We conclude that in most realistic\ncircumstances, for bosonic systems in NESS with constant bilinear coupling,\n`hot entanglement' is largely a fiction.

We used a training sample to define a quantity, the Fisher\ndiscriminant (linear combination of colours), which correlates best with the\ndesired properties of the target: redshift and [OII] flux. The proposed\nselections are simply done by applying a cut on magnitudes and this Fisher\ndiscriminant. We used public data and dedicated SDSS spectroscopy to quantify\nthe redshift distribution and [OII] flux of our ELG target selections. We\ndemonstrate that two of our selections fulfil the initial eBOSS/ELG redshift\nrequirements: for a target density of 180 deg^2, ~70% of the selected objects\nhave 0.6<zspec<1.0 and only ~1% of those galaxies in the range 0.6<zspec<1.0\nare expected to have a catastrophic zspec estimate. Additionally, the stacked\nspectra and stacked deep images for those two selections show characteristic\nfeatures of star-forming galaxies. The proposed approach using the Fisher\ndiscriminant could, however, be used to efficiently select other galaxy\npopulations, based on multi-band photometry, providing that spectroscopic\ninformation is available.

To improve\non the state of the art of keyword searches from annotations, methods for\ncontent-based retrieval have been proposed. In the context of gene expression\nexperiments, most methods retrieve gene expression profiles, requiring each\nexperiment to be expressed as a single profile, typically of case vs. control.\nA more general, recently suggested alternative is to retrieve experiments whose\nmodels are good for modelling the query dataset. However, for very noisy and\nhigh-dimensional query data, this retrieval criterion turns out to be very\nnoisy as well.\n  Results: We propose doing retrieval using a denoised model of the query\ndataset, instead of the original noisy dataset itself. To this end, we\nintroduce a general probabilistic framework, where each experiment is modelled\nseparately and the retrieval is done by finding related models. For retrieval\nof gene expression experiments, we use a probabilistic model called product\npartition model, which induces a clustering of genes that show similar\nexpression patterns across a number of samples. The suggested metric for\nretrieval using clusterings is the normalized information distance. Empirical\nresults finally suggest that inference for the full probabilistic model can be\napproximated with good performance using computationally faster heuristic\nclustering approaches (e.g. $k$-means). The method is highly scalable and\nstraightforward to apply to construct a general-purpose gene expression\nexperiment retrieval method.\n  Availability: The method can be implemented using standard clustering\nalgorithms and normalized information distance, available in many statistical\nsoftware packages.\n","Comment: Updated figures.

This frequency dependence is a\nfundamental consequence of the causality constraint, incarnated by\nKramers-Kronig relations or, equivalently, by the Bode relations. In order to\nresolve this issue, we introduce here the concept of a \\emph{perfect dispersive\nmedium}, which is a loss-gain medium characterized by a perfectly flat\nmagnitude response along with an arbitrary phase response.

In the data-sharing strategy, the backhaul links connecting the\ncentral processor (CP) and the base-stations (BSs) are used to carry user\nmessages -- each user's messages are sent to multiple BSs; the BSs locally form\nthe beamforming vectors then cooperatively transmit the messages to the user.\nIn the compression strategy, the user messages are precoded centrally at the\nCP, which forwards a compressed version of the analog beamformed signals to the\nBSs for cooperative transmission. This paper compares the energy efficiencies\nof the two strategies by formulating an optimization problem of minimizing the\ntotal network power consumption subject to user target rate constraints, where\nthe total network power includes the BS transmission power, BS activation\npower, and load-dependent backhaul power. To tackle the discrete and nonconvex\nnature of the optimization problems, we utilize the techniques of reweighted\n$\\ell_1$ minimization and successive convex approximation to devise provably\nconvergent algorithms. Our main finding is that both the optimized data-sharing\nand compression strategies in C-RAN achieve much higher energy efficiency as\ncompared to the non-optimized coordinated multi-point transmission, but their\ncomparative effectiveness in energy saving depends on the user target rate. At\nlow user target rate, data-sharing consumes less total power than compression,\nhowever, as the user target rate increases, the backhaul power consumption for\ndata-sharing increases significantly leading to better energy efficiency of\ncompression at the high user rate regime.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 8 figures, accepted by JSAC Energy-Efficient Techniques for\n  5G Wireless Communication Systems special issue"]}]

Peak Signal to Noise\nRation is measured on a logarithmic scale and depends on the mean squared error\n(MSE) between an original and an impaired image or video, relative to (2n-1)2.\n  Previous research done regarding assessing of video quality has been mainly\nby the use of subjective methods, and there is still no standard method for\nobjective assessments.

The interpretation of such models regarding neuronal\nimplementation of the human motor system is not clear. An important aspects of\noptimal control policies is the notion of cost. Optimal control seeks to\nminimize a notion of cost, while meeting certain goals. We offer a method to\ntransform current methods in the literature from their traditional form by\nchanging the norm by which cost is assessed. We show how sparsity can be\nintroduced into current optimal approaches that use continuous control signals.\nWe assess cost using the infinity norm. This results in optimal signals which\ncan be represented by a small amount of Dirac delta functions. Sparsity has\nplayed an important role in theoretical neuroscience for information processing\n(such as vision). In this work, to obtain sparse control signals, the infinity\nnorm is used as a penalty on the control signal, which is then encoded with\nDirac delta functions. We show, for a basic physical system, a point mass can\nbe moved between two points in a way that resembles human fast reaching\nmovements. Despite the sparse nature of the control signal, the movements that\nresult are continuous and smooth. These control signals are simpler than their\nnon-sparse counterparts, yet yield comparable results when applied towards\nmodeling reaching movements. In addition, such sparse control signals resemble\na sequence of spikes, giving this approach a biological interpretation. Actual\nneuronal implementations are more complex. However, this work shows, in\nprinciple, that sparsely encoded control signals are a plausible implementation\nfor the control of reaching movements. Leading techniques for modeling human\nmovements can easily be adjusted in order to introduce sparsity, with a\nbiological interpretation and the simplified information content of the control\nsignal.\n"]}]

The basic requirement is to satisfy both\ncriteria concerning the regularity of the surface and aesthetic concepts. With\nregard to the aesthetic quality, it is well known that interpolatory methods\noften produce shape artifacts when the data points are unevenly spaced. In the\nunivariate setting, this problem can be overcome, or at least mitigated, by\nexploiting a proper non-uniform parametrization, that accounts for the geometry\nof the data.

On the other hand, the field of\ncompressed sensing is built upon the observation that \"structured\" signals can\nbe recovered from their under-determined set of linear projections. Currently,\nthere is a large gap between the complexity of the structures studied in the\narea of compressed sensing and those employed by the state-of-the-art\ncompression codes. Recent results in the literature on deterministic signals\naim at bridging this gap through devising compressed sensing decoders that\nemploy compression codes. This paper focuses on structured stochastic processes\nand studies the application of rate-distortion codes to compressed sensing of\nsuch signals. The performance of the formerly-proposed compressible signal\npursuit (CSP) algorithm is studied in this stochastic setting. It is proved\nthat in the very low distortion regime, as the blocklength grows to infinity,\nthe CSP algorithm reliably and robustly recovers $n$ instances of a stationary\nprocess from random linear projections as long as their count is slightly more\nthan $n$ times the rate-distortion dimension (RDD) of the source. It is also\nshown that under some regularity conditions, the RDD of a stationary process is\nequal to its information dimension (ID). This connection establishes the\noptimality of the CSP algorithm at least for memoryless stationary sources, for\nwhich the fundamental limits are known.
