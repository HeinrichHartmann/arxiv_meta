DFT is used to model a materials surface bonding, which affects the\nevaporation field of the surface atoms under high electric fields.

The standard tools used in the Social\nNetworks Analysis field to extract such a network rely on an integration of\ntime, either over the whole considered period, or as a sequence of several\ntime-slices.

The brief review addresses one\nwell-established topic, viz., the stabilization of the 3D and 2D states, with S\n= 0 and 1, trapped in harmonic-oscillator (HO) potentials, and another topic\nwhich was developed very recently: the stabilization of 2D and 3D free-space\nsolitons, which juxtapose components with S = 0 and (+/-)1 (semi-vortices and\nmixed modes), in a binary system with the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) between its\ncomponents. The former model is based on the single cubic nonlinear\nSchroedinger/Gross-Pitaevskii equation (NLSE/GPE), while the latter one is\nrepresented by a system of two coupled GPEs. In both cases, generic situations\nare drastically different in the 2D and 3D geometries. In the 2D settings, the\nstabilization mechanism creates a stable ground state (GS, which was absent\nwithout the stabilization), whose norm falls below the threshold value at which\nthe critical collapse sets in. In the 3D geometry, the supercritical collapse\ndoes not allow to create a GS, but metastable solitons can be constructed.\n","Comment: Some figures have been improved in the published journal version,\n  (Special Issue \"Temporal and Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Instabilities: Novel\n  Computational and Experimental Approaches\")"]}]

For all three systems, a finite maximum transverse\nentanglement force localizing the polymers in effective tubes is predicted. The\nconditions when this entanglement force can be overcome (a force imbalance) by\nan externally applied force associated with macroscopic deformation can be\ncrisply defined in the nonlinear elastic limit, and the possibility of a\n\"microscopic absolute yielding\" event destroying the tube confinement can be\nanalyzed.

The key idea, first discussed in Chernyshenko et\nal. 2014, Philos. T. Roy.

To illustrate the theory in\na concrete way, we also provide some numerical results which corroborate that\nunder the highly desirable attack, attacked data is not useful in reducing the\nCRB.\n"]}]

The process is self-sustaining as zombie vortices\nperturb new critical layers, spawning a next generation of zombie vortices.\nHere, we focus on two issues: the minimum threshold of perturbations that\ntrigger self-sustaining vortex generation, and the properties of the late-time\nzombie turbulence on large and small scales. The critical parameter that\ndetermines whether ZVI is triggered is the magnitude of the vorticity on the\nsmall scales (and not velocity), the minimum Rossby number needed for\ninstability is $Ro_{crit}\\sim0.2$ for $\\beta\\equiv N/\\Omega = 2$, where $N$ is\nthe Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a frequency.

Moreover, we established that the SMP\nappears and becomes stable in commensurate ferroics if the flexocoupling\nconstant exceeds the critical value, defined by the reduced temperature, strain\nand order parameter gradients constants, striction and expansion coefficients\nin the LGD functional. We calculated the soft phonon dispersion in ferroics\nwith commensurate and incommensurate long-range ordered phases allowing for the\nsquired elastic strain gradient, as well as static and dynamic flexocoupling.\nAppeared that the dispersion for the optic mode is slightly sensitive to the\nflexocoupling, while the dispersion of acoustic mode strongly depends on the\ncoupling strength. Obtained results demonstrate that the non-trivial\ndifferences in the dispersion of optic and acoustic modes appear under the\nchange of flexocoupling constant.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 3 figures, including 3 Appendixes"]}]

For the latter, we derive\nuniversal rates of supression of the superconducting transition temperature due\nto magnetic scattering and, for a Fermi level at the Dirac point, a universal\nrate of increase of the quantum critical attraction strength.\n","Comment: v2: 13 pages, 9 figures (added Fig. 5 and Appendix); published\n  version"]}]

Instead\nof simply reconstructing a pixel block from the centers of indexed DCT\ncoefficient quantization bins (hard decoding), soft decoding reconstructs a\nblock by selecting appropriate coefficient values within the indexed bins with\nthe help of signal priors. The challenge thus lies in how to define suitable\npriors and apply them effectively.\n  In this paper, we combine three image priors---Laplacian prior for DCT\ncoefficients, sparsity prior and graph-signal smoothness prior for image\npatches---to construct an efficient JPEG soft decoding algorithm. Specifically,\nwe first use the Laplacian prior to compute a minimum mean square error (MMSE)\ninitial solution for each code block. Next, we show that while the sparsity\nprior can reduce block artifacts, limiting the size of the over-complete\ndictionary (to lower computation) would lead to poor recovery of high DCT\nfrequencies. To alleviate this problem, we design a new graph-signal smoothness\nprior (desired signal has mainly low graph frequencies) based on the left\neigenvectors of the random walk graph Laplacian matrix (LERaG). Compared to\nprevious graph-signal smoothness priors, LERaG has desirable image filtering\nproperties with low computation overhead. We demonstrate how LERaG can\nfacilitate recovery of high DCT frequencies of a piecewise smooth (PWS) signal\nvia an interpretation of low graph frequency components as relaxed solutions to\nnormalized cut in spectral clustering.

In their\nkinetic route towards thermodynamically stable structures, colloidal particles\nself-organize into intermediate (mesoscopic) structures that are much larger\nthan the individual particles and become the relevant units for the dynamics.\nTo follow the dynamics and identify kinetically trapped structures, one needs\nto develop new theoretical and numerical tools. Here we discuss the\nself-organization of functionalized colloids (also known as patchy colloids) on\nattractive substrates. We review our recent results on the adsorption and\nrelaxation and explore the use of annealing cycles to overcome kinetic barriers\nand drive the relaxation towards the targeted structures.\n"]}]

This was\ndone by investigating the effect of bursty influx on the switching dynamics of\nstochastic populations. Here we extend this formalism to account for bursty\nreproduction processes, and improve the accuracy of the formalism to include\nsubleading-order corrections. Bursty reproduction appears in various contexts,\nwhere notable examples include bursty viral production from infected cells, and\nreproduction of mammals involving varying number of offspring. The main\nquestion we quantitatively address is how bursty reproduction affects the\noverall fate of the population. We consider two complementary scenarios:\npopulation extinction and population survival; in the former a population gets\nextinct after maintaining a long-lived metastable state, whereas in the latter\na population proliferates despite undergoing a deterministic drift towards\nextinction. In both models reproduction occurs in bursts, sampled from an\narbitrary distribution. In the extinction problem, we show that bursty\nreproduction broadens the quasi-stationary distribution of population sizes in\nthe metastable state, which results in an exponential decrease of the mean time\nto extinction. In the survival problem, bursty reproduction yields an\nexponential increase in survival probability of the population. Close to the\nbifurcation limit our analytical results simplify considerably and are shown to\ndepend solely on the mean and variance of the burst-size distribution. Our\nformalism is demonstrated on several realistic distributions which all compare\nwell with numerical Monte-Carlo simulations.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 7 figures"]}]

In this paper, we consider the impacts of\nfree-free absorption and multi-path scattering in our analysis via a number of\ndifferent assumptions about the intervening medium. We consider previous low\nfrequency surveys alongwith an ongoing survey with the University of Technology\ndigital backend for the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (UTMOST) as\nwell as future observations with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping\nExperiment (CHIME) and the Hydrogen Intensity and Real-Time Analysis Experiment\n(HIRAX). We predict that CHIME and HIRAX will be able to observe $\\sim$ 30 or\nmore FRBs per day, even in the most extreme scenarios where free-free\nabsorption and scattering can significantly impact the fluxes below 1~GHz. We\nalso show that UTMOST will detect 1--2 FRBs per month of observations. For\nCHIME and HIRAX, the detection rates also depend greatly on the assumed FRB\ndistance scale. Some of the models we investigated predict an increase in the\nFRB flux as a function of redshift at low frequencies. If FRBs are truly\ncosmological sources, this effect may impact future surveys in this band,\nparticularly if the FRB population traces the cosmic star formation rate.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 5 figures, revised manuscript, accepted for publication in\n  MNRAS"]}]

It is generally accepted that, in Classical T Tauri Stars, the\nplasma from the circumstellar disc accretes onto the stellar surface with free\nfall velocity, and the impact generates a shock. The impact region is expected\nto contribute to emission in different spectral bands; many studies have\nconfirmed that the X-rays arise from the post-shock plasma but, otherwise,\nthere are no studies in the literature investigating the origin of the observed\nUV emission which is apparently correlated to accretion. Aims. We investigated\nthe effect of radiative heating of the infalling material by the post-shock\nplasma at the base of the accretion stream with the aim to identify in which\nregion a significant part of the UV emission originates. Methods. We developed\na 1D hydrodynamic model describing the impact of an accretion stream onto the\nstellar surface; the model takes into account the gravity, the radiative\ncooling of an optically thin plasma, the thermal conduction, and the heating\ndue to absorption of X-ray radiation. The latter term represents the heating of\nthe infalling plasma due to the absorption of X-rays emitted from the\npost-shock region. Results. We found that the radiative heating of the\npre-shock plasma plays a non-negligible role in the accretion phenomenon. In\nparticular, the dense and cold plasma of the pre-shock accretion column is\ngradually heated up to few $10^5$\\;K due to irradiation of X-rays arising from\nthe shocked plasma at the impact region. This heating mechanism does not affect\nsignificantly the dynamics of the post-shock plasma. On the other hand, a\nregion of radiatively heated gas (that we consider a precursor) forms in the\nunshocked accretion column and contributes significantly to UV emission. Our\nmodel naturally reproduces the luminosity of UV emission lines correlated to\naccretion and shows that most of the UV emission originates from the precursor.\n"]}]

Moreover, since two SMGs in our sample,\nAzTEC1 and AzTEC3, benefit from previous CO line observations, we studied their\nproperties in more detail. We found that 63% of our target SMGs lie above the\ngalaxy main-sequence by more than a factor of 3, and hence are starbursts. The\n3 GHz radio sizes we have previously measured for the target SMGs were compared\nwith the present stellar mass estimates, and we found that the z>3 SMGs are\nfairly consistent with the mass-size relationship of z~2 compact, quiescent\ngalaxies (cQGs). The median IR-radio correlation parameter is found to be\nq=2.27, which is lower than measured locally (median q=2.64). AzTEC1 is found\nto have a sub-Eddington SFR surface density (by a factor of 2.6), while AzTEC3\nappears to be an Eddington-limited starburster. The gas reservoir in these two\nhigh-z SMGs would be exhausted in only ~86 and 19 Myr at the current SFR,\nrespectively. A comparison of the MAGPHYS-based properties of our SMGs with\nthose of equally bright ALESS SMGs suggests that the two populations share\nfairly similar physical characteristics, including the q parameter. A hint of\nnegative correlation is found between the 3 GHz size and the level of\nstarburstiness, and hence cosmic-ray electrons in more compact starbursts might\nbe more susceptible to free-free absorption. Some of the derived low and high q\nvalues (compared to the local median) could be the result of a specific\nmerger/post-starburst phase of galaxy evolution.

Considering the interplay of the cavity-EIT effect and\nthe quantum memory process, we demonstrated a controlled phase gate between two\nsingle photons.

We\nexplore the relevant parameter space in the atom-cavity system that allows the\nimplementation of quantum phase gates using the recent technologies.

Objective: To evaluate the likelihood that a code reorganization to\naddress bad code smells will yield improvement in the defect-proneness of the\ncode. Method: We introduce XTREE, a tool that analyzes a historical log of\ndefects seen previously in the code and generates a set of useful code changes.\nAny bad smell that requires changes outside of that set can be deprioritized\n(since there is no historical evidence that the bad smell causes any problems).\nEvaluation: We evaluate XTREE's recommendations for bad smell improvement\nagainst recommendations from previous work (Shatnawi, Alves, and Borges) using\nmultiple data sets of code metrics and defect counts.

In OAT, a laser is employed to\nilluminate the tissue of interest and acoustic signals are produced via the\nphotoacoustic effect. From these data, an estimate of the distribution of the\nabsorbed optical energy density within the tissue is reconstructed, referred to\nas the object function. This quantity is defined, in part, by the distribution\nof light fluence within the tissue that is established by the laser source.\nWhen performing three-dimensional imaging of large objects, such as a female\nhuman breast, it can be difficult to achieve a relatively uniform coverage of\nlight fluence within the volume of interest when the position of the laser\nsource is fixed. To circumvent this, researchers have proposed illumination\nschemes in which the relative position of the laser source and ultrasound probe\nis fixed, and both are rotated together to acquire a tomographic data set. A\nproblem with this rotating-illumination scheme is that the tomographic data are\ninconsistent; namely, the acoustic data recorded at each tomographic view angle\n(i.e., probe position) are produced by a distinct object function. In this\nwork, the impact of this data inconsistency on image reconstruction accuracy is\ninvestigated systematically.

They are detected almost everywhere in the ISM, as well\nas in comets. In the past, they have been used to constrain the age of some\nmolecular clouds, since their abundance is predicted to be a strong function of\ntime. We present an extensive study of the cyanopolyynes distribution in the\nsolar-type protostar IRAS16293-2422 based on TIMASSS IRAM-30m observations. The\ngoals are (i) to obtain a census of the cyanopolyynes in this source and of\ntheir isotopologues; (ii) to derive how their abundance varies across the\nprotostar envelope; and (iii) to obtain constraints on the history of\nIRAS16293-2422. We detect several lines from HC3N and HC5N, and report the\nfirst detection of DC3N, in a solar-type protostar. We found that the HC3N\nabundance is roughly constant (~1.3x10^(-11)) in the outer cold envelope of\nIRAS16293-2422, and it increases by about a factor 100 in the inner region\nwhere Tdust>80K. The HC5N has an abundance similar to HC3N in the outer\nenvelope and about a factor of ten lower in the inner region. The HC3N\nabundance derived in the inner region, and where the increase occurs, also\nprovide strong constraints on the time taken for the dust to warm up to 80K,\nwhich has to be shorter than ~10^3-10^4yr. Finally, the cyanoacetylene\ndeuteration is about 50\\% in the outer envelope and <5$\\% in the warm inner\nregion. The relatively low deuteration in the warm region suggests that we are\nwitnessing a fossil of the HC3N abundantly formed in the tenuous phase of the\npre-collapse and then frozen into the grain mantles at a later phase. The\naccurate analysis of the cyanopolyynes in IRAS16293-2422 unveils an important\npart of its past story.

In this paper,\nwe investigate whether current retrieval methods will still be valid in the era\nof JWST, exploring common approximations used when retrieving transmission\nspectra of hot Jupiters. To assess biases, we use 1D photochemical models to\nsimulate typical hot Jupiter cloud-free atmospheres and generate synthetic\nobservations for a range of carbon-to-oxygen ratios. Then, we retrieve these\nspectra using TauREx, a Bayesian retrieval tool, using two methodologies: one\nassuming an isothermal atmosphere, and one assuming a parametrized temperature\nprofile. Both methods assume constant-with-altitude abundances. We found that\nthe isothermal approximation biases the retrieved parameters considerably,\noverestimating the abundances by about one order of magnitude. The retrieved\nabundances using the parametrized profile are usually within one sigma of the\ntrue state, and we found the retrieved uncertainties to be generally larger\ncompared to the isothermal approximation. Interestingly, we found that using\nthe parametrized temperature profile we could place tight constraints on the\ntemperature structure.

Our optical spectra reveal the\npresence of a fast outflowing wind, as implied by the detection of a P-Cyg\nprofile (He I - 5876 A) with a terminal velocity of ~2500 km/s. Nebular-like\nspectra -- with an H_alpha equivalent width of ~500 A -- are also observed. All\nthese features are similar to those seen during the main June 2015 outburst.\nThus, the fast optical wind simultaneous with the radio jet is most likely\npresent in every V404 Cyg outburst. Finally, we report on the detection of a\nstrong radio flare in late January 2016, when X-ray and optical monitoring had\nstopped due to Sun constraints.\n","Comment: To be published in MNRAS Letters"]}]

The results show an emission feature that drifts across the profile\nwhile the prominence is out of the stellar disk. When the prominence eclipses\nthe star, the intensity profile shows an absorption. The scattering induced by\nthe prominence generates linear polarization signals in Stokes Q and U\nprofiles, which are modified by the Hanle effect when a magnetic field is\npresent. Due to the Zeeman effect, Stokes V profiles show a signal with very\nlow amplitude when the magnetic field along the line-of-sight is different from\nzero.

Therefore, topological insulators\nare very sensitive to magnetic fields, which can open a gap in the electronic\nspectrum. Concerning \"internal\" magnetic effects, for example the situation\nwith doped magnetic impurities, is not trivial. A single magnetic impurity is\nnot enough to open the band gap, while in the case of a ferromagnetic chain of\ndeposited magnetic impurities the Dirac point is lifted.

The use of such constellations with a\nPeak-To-Average-Sum-Power-Ratio (PASPR) of 1 allows to use load-modulated\ntransmitters which can cope with a small backoff, which in turn results in a\nhigh power efficiency. In this paper, we discuss several methods how to\ngenerate PSKH constellations and compare their performance. After applying\nconventional Pulse-Amplitude Modulation (PAM), the PASPR of the continuous time\nPSKH signal depends on the choice of the pulse shaping method.

Nematic liquid crystals with\nspatially varying director patterns represent a promising approach to achieve a\nwell-controlled placement of colloidal particles thanks to the elastic forces\nbetween the particles and the surrounding landscape of molecular orientation.\nHere we demonstrate how the spatially varying director field can be used to\ncontrol placement of non-spherical particles of boomerang shape. The boomerang\ncolloids create director distortions of a dipolar symmetry. When a boomerang\nparticle is placed in a periodic splay-bend director pattern, it migrates\ntowards the region of a maximum bend. The behavior is contrasted to that one of\nspherical particles with normal surface anchoring, which also produce dipolar\ndirector distortions, but prefer to compartmentalize into the regions with a\nmaximum splay. The splay-bend periodic landscape thus allows one to spatially\nseparate these two types of particles. By exploring overdamped dynamics of the\ncolloids, we determine elastic driving forces responsible for the preferential\nplacement.

A\nflare occurrence near the light wall caused material to erupt from the lower\nsolar atmosphere into the corona. Some material falls back to the solar\nsurface, and hits the light bridge (i.e., the base of the light wall), then\nsudden brightenings appear at the wall base followed by the rise of wall top,\nleading to an increase of the wall height. Once the brightness of the wall base\nfades, the height of the light wall begins to decrease. Five hours later,\nanother nearby flare takes place, a bright channel is formed that extends from\nthe flare towards the light bridge.

The excess persists and its spectral characteristics favor a\ndark matter particle with a mass in the range approximately from 50 to 190 (10\nto 90) GeV and annihilation cross section approximately from 1E-26 to 4E-25\n(6E-27 to 2E-25) cm^3/s for pseudo-scalar (vector) interactions. We map these\nintervals into the corresponding WIMP-neutron scattering cross sections and\nfind that the allowed range lies well below current and projected direct\ndetection constraints for pseudo-scalar interactions, but are typically ruled\nout for vector interactions.\n"]}]

When elasticity is dominated by the interfacial driving force, the final\nshape can deviate strongly from the initial positioning of droplets. Movement\nof the third droplet to a more compact packing occurs, driven by liquid\nmeniscus expansion that minimizes the surface energy of the triplet. A range of\ncompositions and orientations are examined and the resulting domains of\nrestructuring and stability are mapped based on the final triplet structure. A\ngeometric and a physical model are used to explain the mechanism driving\nmeniscus-induced restructuring and are related to the impact of these phenomena\non multiple droplet emulsions.\n"]}]

The most important steps of the processing pipeline are digital\nfocusing of the antennas towards the Moon, correction of the signal for\nionospheric dispersion, and synthesis of the time-domain signal from the\npolyphased-filtered signal in frequency domain. The implementation of the\npipeline on a GPU/CPU cluster will be discussed together with the computing\nperformance of the prototype.\n","Comment: Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Computing in High\n  Energy and Nuclear Physics (CHEP2016), USA"]}]

The destabilization energy E_c per particle goes to zero as N goes\nto infinity following a simple power-law.

Still, when calculating\nLyapunov spectra, we find for the OPMs of both Hamiltonians that the Lyapunov\nexponents decrease following an exponential law and yield extensive\nKolmogorov--Sinai entropies per particle, in the thermodynamic limit of fixed\nenergy density E/N with E and N arbitrarily large.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 10 figures, published at International Journal of\n  Bifurcation and Chaos (IJBC)"]}]
