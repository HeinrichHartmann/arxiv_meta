Without~abandoning classical\nelectromagnetism or standard cosmology, we demonstrate that this is not\nnecessarily the case for superhorizon-sized magnetic fields. The underlying\nreason for this is causality, which confines the post-inflationary process of\nelectric-current formation, electric-field elimination and magnetic-flux\nfreezing within the horizon. As a result, the adiabatic magnetic decay is not\na~priori guaranteed on super-Hubble scales. Instead, after inflation,\nlarge-scale magnetic fields obey a~power-law solution, where one of the modes\ndrops at a rate slower than the adiabatic. Whether this slowly decaying mode\ncan dominate and dictate the post-inflationary magnetic evolution depends on\nthe initial conditions. These are determined by the evolution of the field\nduring inflation and by the nature of the transition from the de Sitter phase\nto the reheating era and then to the subsequent epochs of radiation and dust.\nWe discuss two alternative and complementary scenarios to illustrate the role\nand the implications of the initial conditions for cosmic magnetogenesis.

Trajectory sets\nare introduced for which existing non-probabilistic markets models are nested\nas a particular case.

The early excitement in this field,\nhowever, has been tempered by the realization that an anomaly in the shear\nmodulus of solid helium $^4$He may explain most if not all of the period shifts\nobserved in the early TO experiments. In principle, it is possible to\ndistinguish experimentally between shear modulus induced period shifts and\nperiod shifts resulting from other physical mechanisms through the use of\nmultiple frequency torsional oscillators.

In an experiment on pairs of\npolarization-entangled photonic qubits we violate by more than 8 standard\ndeviations a Bell-like correlation inequality that is valid for all sets of\ntwo-outcome measurements in any dimension. We combine this with a\ndevice-independent verification that the system is best described by two\nqubits, which therefore constitutes the first device-independent certification\nof a nonprojective quantum measurement.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures.

Managed lanes typically run parallel to a freeway's\nstandard, general-purpose (GP) lanes, but are restricted to certain types of\nvehicles. It was originally thought that managed lanes would improve the use of\nexisting infrastructure through incentivization of demand-management behaviors\nlike carpooling, but implementations have often been characterized by\nunpredicted phenomena that is often to detrimental system performance.\nDevelopment of traffic models that can capture these sorts of behaviors is a\nkey step for helping managed lanes deliver on their promised gains.\n  Towards this goal, this paper presents several macroscopic traffic modeling\ntools we have used for study of freeways equipped with managed lanes, or\n\"managed lane-freeway networks.\" The proposed framework is based on the\nwidely-used first-order kinematic wave theory. In this model, the GP and the\nmanaged lanes are modeled as parallel links connected by nodes, where certain\ntype of traffic may switch between GP and managed lane links. Two types of\nmanaged lane configuration are considered: full-access, where vehicles can\nswitch between the GP and the managed lanes anywhere; and separated, where such\nswitching is allowed only at certain locations called gates. We incorporate two\nempirically-observed phenomena into our model that are particular to managed\nlane-freeway networks: the inertia effect and the friction effect.\n  Calibration of models of large road networks is difficult, as the number of\nparameters grow with the network's size. We present an iterative learning-based\napproach to calibrating our model's physical and driver-behavioral parameters.\nFinally, we validate our model and calibration methodology with case studies of\nsimulations of two managed lane-equipped California freeways.\n","Comment: The above abstract is slightly abbreviated; please see the document\n  for the full abstract"]}]

The formalism is based on\ndensity-matrix equations of motion, on a Born approximation treatment of\ndisorder, and on an expansion in scattering rate to leading non-trivial order.\nThe quasiparticle bands are treated in a completely general manner that allows\nfor arbitrary spin-orbit coupling, and for the broken time reversal symmetry of\nmagnetic conductors. We demonstrate that in metals, semimetals and\nsemiconductors the inter-band response consists primarily of two terms: an\nintrinsic contribution due to the entire Fermi sea that captures, among other\neffects, the Berry curvature contribution to wavepacket dynamics, and an\nanomalous contribution caused by scattering that is sensitive to the presence\nof the Fermi surface. Some examples of electric-field response in metals that\nis dominated by interband coherence contributions are discussed.\n"]}]

Several forms of link function\nhave been proposed to fit dose response models to estimate the BMD and the\ncorresponding benchmark dose lower bound (BMDL). However, if the assumed link\nis not correct, then the estimated BMD and BMDL from the fitted model may not\nbe accurate. To account for model uncertainty, model averaging (MA) methods are\nproposed to estimate BMD averaging over a model space containing a finite\nnumber of standard models. Usual model averaging focuses on a pre-specified\nlist of parametric models leading to pitfalls when none of the models in the\nlist is the correct model. Here, an alternative which augments an initial list\nof parametric models with an infinite number of additional models having\nvarying links has been proposed. In addition, different methods for estimating\nBMDL based on the family of link functions are derived. The proposed approach\nis compared with MA in a simulation study and applied to a real data set.\nSimulation studies are also conducted to compare the four methods of estimating\nBMDL.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 6 tables"]}]

Spin pumping is\ndetected via an increased line width of the spin-wave resonance absorption\npeaks compared to those in systems without an attached normal metal. Spin\npumping is also observed as induced voltages generated by the inverse spin Hall\neffect in the attached normal metals. We theoretically consider the spin-wave\nmode- and wavelength-dependent Gilbert damping in addition to inverse direct\nand alternating spin Hall voltages. Our analysis includes the effects of the\nlong-range dipole interaction on the spin-wave spectrum. In the long-wavelength\nlimit, the ratio of the Gilbert damping enhancement for transverse volume modes\nto that of the macrospin mode is equal to two. However, surface-anisotropic\nenergies modify these results. When the magnetization is out-of-plane, the\nratio decreases with an increasing surface anisotropy magnitude and mode\nnumber. If the surface anisotropy induces a surface state, the enhancement can\nbe more than ten times stronger. When the magnetization is in-plane, the\ninduced dissipation can be understood by mapping the anisotropy parameter to\nthe out-of-plane case with anisotropy. For shorter wavelengths, we compute the\nenhanced Gilbert damping numerically and find good agreement with the\nanalytical results in the limits when they are applicable. We also compute the\ninduced direct- and alternating-current inverse spin Hall voltages and relate\nthese to the magnetic energy stored in the ferromagnet. Because the magnitude\nof the direct spin Hall voltage is a measure of spin dissipation, it is\ndirectly proportional to the enhancement of Gilbert damping. The alternating\nspin Hall voltage exhibits a similar in-plane wave-number dependence, and we\ndemonstrate that it is greatest for surface-localized modes in all field\ngeometries.\n"]}]

First, we\ndevelop a correlated pseudo-marginal (CPM) approach for Bayesian inference in\nstate space (SS) models that is based on filtering the disturbances, rather\nthan the states. This approach is useful when the state transition density is\nintractable or inefficient to compute, and also when the dimension of the\ndisturbance is lower than the dimension of the state. Second, we propose a\nblock pseudo-marginal (BPM) method that uses as the estimate of the likelihood\nthe average of G independent unbiased estimates of the likelihood. We associate\na set of underlying uniform of standard normal random numbers used to construct\neach of the individual unbiased likelihood estimates and then use\ncomponent-wise Markov Chain Monte Carlo to update the parameter vector jointly\nwith one set of these random numbers at a time. This induces a correlation of\napproximately 1-1/G between the logs of the estimated likelihood at the\nproposed and current values of the model parameters. Third, we show for some\nnon-stationary state space models that the BPM approach is much more efficient\nthan the CPM approach, because it is difficult to translate the high\ncorrelation in the underlying random numbers to high correlation between the\nlogs of the likelihood estimates. Although our focus has been on applying the\nBPM method to state space models, our results and approach can be used in a\nwide range of applications of the PM method, such as panel data models,\nsubsampling problems and approximate Bayesian computation.\n"]}]

A wide variety of network graphs happen to be sparse.\nBut the index with which sparsity is commonly measured in network graphs is\nedge density, reflecting the proportion of the sum of the degrees of all nodes\nin the graph compared to the total possible degrees in the corresponding fully\nconnected graph. Thus edge density is a simple ratio and carries limitations,\nprimarily in terms of the amount of information it takes into account in its\ndefinition. In this paper, we have provided a formulation for defining sparsity\nof a network graph by generalizing the concept of Gini Index and call it\nsparsity index. A majority of the six properties (viz., Robin Hood, Scaling,\nRising Tide, Cloning, Bill Gates and Babies) with which sparsity measures are\ncommonly compared are seen to be satisfied by the proposed index. A comparison\nbetween edge density and the sparsity index has been drawn with appropriate\nexamples to highlight the efficacy of the proposed index. It has also been\nshown theoretically that the two measures follow similar trend for a changing\ngraph, i.e., as the edge density of a graph increases its sparsity index\ndecreases. Additionally, the paper draws a relationship, analytically, between\nthe sparsity index and the exponent term of a power law distribution, a\ndistribution which is known to approximate the degree distribution of a wide\nvariety of network graphs. Finally, the article highlights how the proposed\nindex together with Gini index can reveal important properties of a network\ngraph.\n","Comment: 15 pages with 6 figures"]}]

In our analysis, we have also included estimates of the\nbrightness of Jupiter and Saturn at the three frequencies of the Planck Low\nFrequency Instrument (30, 44, and 70 GHz). The results provide constraints on\nthe intrinsic brightness and the brightness time-variability of these planets.\nThe majority of the planet flux density estimates are limited by systematic\nerrors, but still yield better than 1% measurements in many cases. Applying\ndata from Planck HFI, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), and the\nAtacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) to a model that incorporates contributions\nfrom Saturn's rings to the planet's total flux density suggests a best fit\nvalue for the spectral index of Saturn's ring system of $\\beta _\\mathrm{ring} =\n2.30\\pm0.03$ over the 30-1000 GHz frequency range. The average ratio between\nthe Planck-HFI measurements and the adopted model predictions for all five\nplanets (excluding Jupiter observations for 353 GHz) is 0.997, 0.997, 1.018,\nand 1.032 for 100, 143, 217, and 353 GHz, respectively. Model predictions for\nplanet thermodynamic temperatures are therefore consistent with the absolute\ncalibration of Planck-HFI detectors at about the three-percent-level. We\ncompare our measurements with published results from recent cosmic microwave\nbackground experiments. In particular, we observe that the flux densities\nmeasured by Planck HFI and WMAP agree to within 2%.

The macrocell base station (BS) locations are modeled\nby an independent PPP. This model naturally captures correlation that exists\nbetween the locations of users and their serving SBSs.
