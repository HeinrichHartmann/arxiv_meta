Stochastic initiation\nimplies fluctuations in the time to complete and may lead to cell death if\nreplication takes longer than the cell cycle time ($\\approx 25$ min).\nSurprisingly, although the typical replication time is about 20 min, \\textit{in\nvivo} experiments show that replication fails to complete only about 1 in 300\ntimes. How is replication timing accurately controlled despite the\nstochasticity? Biologists have proposed two solutions to this\n\"random-completion problem.\" The first solution uses randomly located origins\nbut increases their rate of initiation as S phase proceeds, while the second\nuses regularly spaced origins. In this paper, we investigate the\nrandom-completion problem using a type of model first developed to describe the\nkinetics of first-order phase transitions. Using methods from the field of\nextreme-value statistics, we derive the distribution of replication-completion\ntimes for a finite genome. We then argue that the biologists' first solution to\nthe problem is not only consistent with experiment but also nearly optimizes\nthe use of replicative proteins. We also show that spatial regularity in origin\nplacement does not alter significantly the distribution of replication times\nand, thus, is not needed for the control of replication timing.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 9 figures, submitted to Physical Review E"]}]

In LAOStrain we find banding at\nlow frequencies and sufficiently high strain rate amplitudes in fluids for\nwhich the underlying constitutive curve of shear stress as a function of shear\nrate is non-monotonic. This is the direct analogue of quasi steady state\nbanding seen in slow strain rate sweeps along the flow curve. At higher\nfrequencies and sufficiently high strain amplitudes we report a different but\nrelated phenomenon, which we call `elastic' shear banding. This is associated\nwith an overshoot in the elastic (Lissajous-Bowditch) curve of stress as a\nfunction of strain. We suggest that this may arise widely even in fluids that\nhave a monotonic underlying constitutive curve, and so do not show steady state\nbanding under a steadily applied shear flow. In LAOStress we report banding in\nfluids that shear thin strongly enough to have either a negatively, or weakly\npositively, sloping region in the underlying constitutive curve, noting again\nthat fluids in the latter category do not display steady state banding in a\nsteadily applied flow. This banding is triggered in each half cycle as the\nstress magnitude transits the region of weak slope in an upward direction, such\nthat the fluid effectively yields. Our numerics are performed in the Rolie-poly\nmodel of polymeric fluids, but we also provide arguments suggesting that our\nresults should apply more widely.

It follows that the\nlate radiation has to be entangled with the early radiation and, as a\nconsequence, the entanglement among the Hawking pair partners has to decrease\ncontinuously from maximal to vanishing during the BH's life span. Starting from\nthe basic premise that both the horizon radius and the center of mass of a\nfinite-mass BH are fluctuating quantum mechanically, we show how this process\nis realized. First, it is shown that the horizon fluctuations induce a small\namount of variance in the total linear momentum of each created pair. This is\nin contrast to the case of an infinitely massive BH, for which the total\nmomentum of the produced pair vanishes exactly on account of momentum\nconservation. This variance leads to a random recoil of the BH during each\nemission and, as a result, the center of mass of the BH undergoes a quantum\nrandom walk. Consequently, the uncertainty in its momentum grows as the square\nroot of the number of emissions. We then show that this uncertainty controls\nthe amount of deviation from maximal entanglement of the produced pairs and\nthat this deviation is determined by the ratio of the cumulative number of\nemitted particles to the initial BH entropy. Thus, the interplay between the\nhorizon and center-of-mass fluctuations provides a mechanism for teleporting\nentanglement from the pair partners to the BH and the emitted radiation.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 1 figure"]}]

We investigate how this accuracy can be estimated without ground\ntruth available and used to improve registration quality of mono- and\nmulti-modal pair of images. At the local scale of image fragments, the\nCramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) on registration error is estimated for each local\ncorrespondence between coarsely registered pair of images. This CRLB is defined\nby local image texture and noise properties. Opposite to the standard approach,\nwhere registration accuracy is only evaluated at the output of the registration\nprocess, such valuable information is used by us as an additional input\nknowledge. It greatly helps detecting and discarding outliers and refining the\nestimation of geometrical transformation model parameters. Based on these\nideas, a new area-based registration method called RAE (Registration with\nAccuracy Estimation) is proposed. In addition to its ability to automatically\nregister very complex multimodal image pairs with high accuracy, the RAE method\nprovides registration accuracy at the global scale as covariance matrix of\nestimation error of geometrical transformation model parameters or as\npoint-wise registration Standard Deviation.

In order to extract\nmeaningful information about size and shape of the cluster, we minimize\nuncertainty by optimizing the cross-correlation measurements and\nrelative-relocation process. With a synthetic test we determine the best\nparameters for differential-time measurements and estimate their uncertainties,\nspecifically for each waveform. We design a relocation strategy to work without\na predefined velocity model, by formulating and inverting the problem to seek\nchanges in both location and slowness, thus accounting for azimuth, take-off\nangles and velocity deviations from a 1D model. We solve the inversion\nexplicitly in order to propagate data errors through the calculation. With this\napproach we are able to resolve a source volume few tens of meters wide on\nhorizontal directions and around 100 meters in depth. There is no suggestion\nthat the hypocentres lie on a single fault plane and the depth distribution\nindicates that their source is unlikely to be related to glacial processes as\nthe ice thickness is not expected to exceed few tens of meters in the source\narea.\n"]}]

Despite the rapid progress, the emphasis of the research\ncommunity in the last decade has remained largely concentrated on improving the\ndesign of energy harvester (so-called rectenna) and has left aside the effect\nof transmitter design. In this paper, we study the design of transmit waveform\nso as to enhance the DC power at the output of the rectenna. We derive a\ntractable model of the non-linearity of the rectenna and compare with a linear\nmodel conventionally used in the literature. We then use those models to design\nnovel multisine waveforms that are adaptive to the channel state information\n(CSI). Interestingly, while the linear model favours narrowband transmission\nwith all the power allocated to a single frequency, the non-linear model\nfavours a power allocation over multiple frequencies. Through realistic\nsimulations, waveforms designed based on the non-linear model are shown to\nprovide significant gains (in terms of harvested DC power) over those designed\nbased on the linear model and over non-adaptive waveforms. We also compute\nanalytically the theoretical scaling laws of the harvested energy for various\nwaveforms as a function of the number of sinewaves and transmit antennas. Those\nscaling laws highlight the benefits of CSI knowledge at the transmitter in WPT\nand of a WPT design based on a non-linear rectenna model over a linear model.\nResults also motivate the study of a promising architecture relying on\nlarge-scale multisine multi-antenna waveforms for WPT.

The\nresults show that the presence of slip exhibits a promise for stabilizing the\nmiscible flow system by raising the critical Reynolds number at the onset and\ndecreasing the bandwidth of unstable wave numbers beyond the threshold of the\ndominant instability. This is different from its role in the case of a single\nfluid down a slippery substrate where slip destabilizes the flow system at the\nonset. Though the stability properties are analogous to the same flow system\ndown a rigid substrate, slip is shown to delay the surface mode instability for\nany viscosity contrast. It has a damping/promoting effect on the overlap modes\n(which exist due to the overlap of critical layer of dominant disturbance with\nthe mixed layer) when the mixed layer is away/close from/to the slippery\ninclined wall.

We then spend the\nrest of the paper developing two ways of going beyond the saddle point\napproximation to the generating functional. In the first one, we develop a\nvariational perturbative approximation to the generating functional by\nexpanding the action around a quadratic function of the local fields and\nconjugate local fields whose parameters are optimized. We derive analytical\nexpressions for the optimal parameters and show that when the optimization is\nsuitably restricted, we recover the mean field equations that are exact for the\nfully asymmetric random couplings (M\\'ezard and Sakellariou, 2011).

Stellar activity is an important source of systematic\nerrors and uncertainties in the characterization of exoplanets. Most of the\ntechniques used to correct for this activity focus on an ad hoc data reduction.\nAims. We have developed a software for the combined fit of transits and stellar\nactivity features in high-precision long-duration photometry. Our aim is to\ntake advantage of the modelling to derive correct stellar and planetary\nparameters, even in the case of strong stellar activity. Methods. We use an\nanalytic approach to model the light curve. The code KSint, modified by adding\nthe evolution of active regions, is implemented into our Bayesian modelling\npackage PASTIS. The code is then applied to the light curve of CoRoT-2. The\nlight curve is divided in segments to reduce the number of free parameters\nneeded by the fit. We perform a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis in two ways.\nIn the first, we perform a global and independent modelling of each segment of\nthe light curve, transits are not normalized and are fitted together with the\nactivity features, and occulted features are taken into account during the\ntransit fit. In the second, we normalize the transits with a model of the\nnon-occulted activity features, and then we apply a standard transit fit, which\ndoes not take the occulted features into account. Results. Our model recovers\nthe activity features coverage of the stellar surface and different rotation\nperiods for different features. We find variations in the transit parameters of\ndifferent segments and show that they are likely due to the division applied to\nthe light curve. Neglecting stellar activity or even only bright spots while\nnormalizing the transits yields a $\\sim 1.2\\sigma$ larger and $2.3\\sigma$\nsmaller transit depth, respectively. The stellar density also presents up to\n$2.5\\sigma$ differences depending on the normalization technique...\n","Comment: 14 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables, accepted on A&A. arXiv admin note:\n  text overlap with arXiv:1604.03979"]}]

We have recently investigated the origin of chemical signatures\nobserved in Galactic halo stars by means of a stochastic chemical evolution\nmodel. We have found that rotating massive stars are a promising way to explain\nseveral signatures observed in these fossil stars. Aims. In the present paper\nwe discuss how the extremely metal-poor halo star TYC 8442-1036-1, for which we\nhave now obtained detailed abundances from VLT-UVES spectra, fits into the\nframework of our previous work. Methods. We apply a standard 1D LTE analysis to\nthe spectrum of this star. We measure the abundances of 14 chemical elements;\nfor Na, Mg, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni and Zn we compute the abundances\nusing equivalent widths; for C, Sr and Ba we obtain the abundances by means of\nsynthetic spectra generated by MOOG. Results. We find an abundance of [Fe/H]=\n$-$3.5 $\\pm$0.13 dex based on our high resolution spectrum; this points to an\niron content lower by a factor of three (0.5 dex) compared to the one obtained\nby a low resolution spectrum. The star has a [C/Fe] = 0.4 dex, and it is not\ncarbon enhanced like most of the stars at this metallicity. Moreover, this star\nlies in the plane [Ba/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] in a relatively unusual position, shared\nby a few others galactic halo stars that is only marginally explained by our\npast results. Conclusions. The comparison of the model results with the\nchemical abundance characteristics of this group of stars can be improved if we\nconsider in our model the presence of faint supernovae coupled with rotating\nmassive stars. These results seem to imply that rotating massive stars and\nfaint supernovae scenarios are complementary to each other, and are both\nrequired in order to match the observed chemistry of the earliest phases of the\nchemical enrichment of the Universe.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy and\n  Astrophysics"]}]

First, a time-dependent magnetic field couples with an AF order\nparameter stronger than a static magnetic field, which leads to higher mobility\nof the domain walls.

Indeed, we rigorously analyze the phase diagram of the\nmodel and show that the critical temperatures for fermion densities below\nhalf-filling can manifest a very different behavior as compared to the case of\ndensities above half-filling. This fact results from the inter-band interaction\nand intra-band Coulomb repulsion in interplay with thermal fluctuations between\ntwo energetic levels. So, if the energy difference between bands is too big\nthen the asymmetry disappears. Moreover, the critical temperature turns out to\nbe a non-monotonic function of the fermion density and the phase diagram of our\nmodel shows \"superconducting domes\" as in high-$T_{c}$ cuprate superconductors.\nThis explains why the maximal critical temperature is attained at donor\ndensities away from the maximal one. Outside the superconducting phase and for\nfermion densities near half-filling the thermodynamics governed by our\nHamiltonian corresponds, as in real high-$T_c$ materials, to a Mott-insulating\nphase.

An omission failure, a notion that this paper\nintroduces for the first time in the context of PP, is the loss by one or both\nparties of the information transmitted in an interaction. The failure may or\nmay not be detected by either party. On the other hand, in one-way models,\ncommunication happens only in one direction: only one of the two agents can\nchange its state depending on both agents' states, and the other agent may or\nmay not be aware of the interaction. These notions can be combined, obtaining\none-way protocols with (possibly detectable) omission failures.\n  A general question is what additional power is necessary and sufficient to\ncompletely overcome the weakness of one-way protocols and enable them to\nsimulate two-way protocols, with and without omission failures. As a basic\nfeature, a simulator needs to implement an atomic communication of states\nbetween two agents; this task is further complicated by the anonymity of the\nagents, their lack of knowledge of the system, and the limited amount of memory\nthat they may have.\n  We provide the first answers to these questions by presenting and analyzing\nseveral simulators, i.e., wrapper protocols converting any protocol for the\nstandard two-way model into one running on a weaker one.\n"]}]

Another shortcoming of NN is the lack of flexibility to\ncustomize different distributions for the weights and neurons according to the\ndata, as is often done in probabilistic graphical models. To address these\nproblems, we propose a class of probabilistic neural networks, dubbed\nnatural-parameter networks (NPN), as a novel and lightweight Bayesian treatment\nof NN. NPN allows the usage of arbitrary exponential-family distributions to\nmodel the weights and neurons. Different from traditional NN and BNN, NPN takes\ndistributions as input and goes through layers of transformation before\nproducing distributions to match the target output distributions. As a Bayesian\ntreatment, efficient backpropagation (BP) is performed to learn the natural\nparameters for the distributions over both the weights and neurons. The output\ndistributions of each layer, as byproducts, may be used as second-order\nrepresentations for the associated tasks such as link prediction. Experiments\non real-world datasets show that NPN can achieve state-of-the-art performance.\n","Comment: To appear at NIPS 2016"]}]

Given the popularity of LoRa it is likely\nthat multiple independent LoRa networks are deployed in close proximity.

This\nsystem automatically derives worst-case resource bounds for higher-order\npolymorphic programs with user-defined inductive types. The technique is\nparametric in the resource and can derive bounds for time, memory allocations\nand energy usage. The derived bounds are multivariate resource polynomials\nwhich are functions of different size parameters that depend on the standard\nOCaml types. Bound inference is fully automatic and reduced to a linear\noptimization problem that is passed to an off-the-shelf LP solver. Technically,\nthe analysis system is based on a novel multivariate automatic amortized\nresource analysis (AARA). It builds on existing work on linear AARA for\nhigher-order programs with user-defined inductive types and on multivariate\nAARA for first-order programs with built-in lists and binary trees. For the\nfirst time, it is possible to automatically derive polynomial bounds for\nhigher-order functions and polynomial bounds that depend on user-defined\ninductive types. Moreover, the analysis handles programs with side effects and\neven outperforms the linear bound inference of previous systems. At the same\ntime, it preserves the expressivity and efficiency of existing AARA techniques.\nThe practicality of the analysis system is demonstrated with an implementation\nand integration with Inria's OCaml compiler. The implementation is used to\nautomatically derive resource bounds for 411 functions and 6018 lines of code\nderived from OCaml libraries, the CompCert compiler, and implementations of\ntextbook algorithms. In a case study, the system infers bounds on the number of\nqueries that are sent by OCaml programs to DynamoDB, a commercial NoSQL cloud\ndatabase service.\n","Comment: 74 pages, technical report, short version accepted at POPL 2017"]}]

Particularly, we will discuss\nthe current understanding of the influences of strain on the diffusion (energy\nbarrier and prefactor) of a single adatom on a substrate.\n  A DFT total energy calculation by its nature is primarily a static\ncalculation. An accurate way to describe the spatial and temporal development\nof a growing crystal is given by kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC). We will describe\nthe method and its combination with microscopic parameters obtained from ab\ninitio calculations. It is shown that realistic ab initio kinetic Monte Carlo\nsimulations are able to predict an evolving mesoscopic structure on the basis\nof microscopic details.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 6 figures, In: ``Morphological Organisation during\n  Epitaxial Growth and Removal'', Eds.

Using the one-plaquette gauge action and the\nWilson quark action, the transition in the chiral limit is shown to be\ncontinuous for the case of degenerate two flavors, $N_F=2$, while it is of\nfirst order for $N_F \\geq 3$. For a more realistic case of massless up and down\nquarks and a light strange quark, $N_F=2+1$, clear two state signals are\nobserved both for $m_s \\simeq 150$ and 400 MeV. In contrast to a previous\nresult with staggered quarks, this suggests a first order transition in the\nreal world. In order to see the implication of these results to the continuum\nlimit, we started to study these issues using improved actions. First results\nusing a RG improved gauge action combined with the standard Wilson quark is\npresented for the case of $N_F=2$: With this action the finite temperature\ntransition is shown to be continuous in the chiral limit confirming the result\nof the standard action. Furthermore, not like the case of the standard action\nwhere lattice artifacts make the transition once very strong at intermediate\nvalues of the hopping parameter $K$ on $N_t=4$ and 6 lattices, a smooth\ncrossover is found for the improved action when we increase $1/K-1/K_c$, in\naccord with a naive expectation about the fate of second order chiral\ntransition at finite $m_q$.\n","Comment: uuencoded compressed PS file, 9 pages, 10 figures, Talk given at the\n  International Conference {\\it Confinement95}, RCNP, Osaka, March 22-24, 1995"]}]

This effect, studied\na long time ago for gravitational waves, also is operational for scalar\ngravitational fluctuations, inhomogeneities which are believed to be more\nimportant in inflationary cosmology. The back-reaction of fluctuations can be\ndescribed by an effective energy-momentum tensor. The issue of coordinate\ninvariance makes the analysis more complicated for scalar fluctuations than for\ngravitational waves. We show that the back-reaction of fluctuations can be\ndescribed in a diffeomorphism-invariant way. In an inflationary cosmology, the\nback-reaction is dominated by infrared modes. We show that these modes give a\ncontribution to the effective energy-momentum tensor of the form of a negative\ncosmological constant whose absolute value grows in time.

As a result of\nnarrowing the scope of this paper, I hope it has gained the benefit of being an\nalmost self contained introduction to the exciting field of quantum\ncomputation.\n  The review begins with background on theoretical computer science, Turing\nmachines and Boolean circuits. In light of these models, I define quantum\ncomputers, and discuss the issue of universal quantum gates. Quantum\nalgorithms, including Shor's factorization algorithm and Grover's algorithm for\nsearching databases, are explained. I will devote much attention to\nunderstanding what the origins of the quantum computational power are, and what\nthe limits of this power are. Finally, I describe the recent theoretical\nresults which show that quantum computers maintain their complexity power even\nin the presence of noise, inaccuracies and finite precision. I tried to put all\nresults in their context, asking what the implications to other issues in\ncomputer science and physics are. In the end of this review I make these\nconnections explicit, discussing the possible implications of quantum\ncomputation on fundamental physical questions, such as the transition from\nquantum to classical physics.\n","Comment: 77 pages, figures included in the ps file.
