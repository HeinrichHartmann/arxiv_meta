Eight of these groups have two large spiral galaxies with several\ndwarf galaxies and may be thought of as morphological analogues of the Local\nGroup.

The Choir groups are very compact at typically only 190 kpc in projected\ndistance between the two brightest members.

The dynamics of the model is defined by a simple\nmatrix, M. Each row of M corresponds to a macrostate of the system, e.g. net\nalignment, while the elements in the row represent microstates. The constant\nnumber of elements in each row ensures constant entropy, which allows\nreversible fluctuations, similar to information theory where a constant number\nof bits allows reversible computations. Many elements in M come from the\nmicrostates of the system, but many others come from the bath. Bypassing the\nbath states yields fluctuations that exhibit standard white noise; whereas with\nbath states the power spectral density varies as S(f)~1/f over a wide range of\nfrequencies, f. Thus, the explicit entropy bath is the mechanism of 1/f noise\nin this model. Both forms of the model match Crooks' fluctuation theorem\nexactly, indicating that the theorem applies not only to infinite reservoirs,\nbut also to finite-sized baths.

This goal is\nhindered by the genetic heterogeneity of mutations in cancer, due to the fact\nthat genes and mutations act in the context of pathways. To identify mutations\nassociated with survival time it is therefore crucial to study mutations in the\ncontext of interaction networks.\n  In this work we study the problem of identifying subnetworks of a large\ngene-gene interaction network that have mutations associated with survival. We\nformally define the associated computational problem by using a score for\nsubnetworks based on the test statistic of the log-rank test, a widely used\nstatistical test for comparing the survival of two populations.

In previous pQCD predictions for Higgs boson\nhadroproduction, it has been conventional to assume that the renormalization\nscale $\\mu_r$ of the QCD coupling $\\alpha_s(\\mu_r)$ is the Higgs mass, and then\nto vary this choice over the range $1/2 m_H < \\mu_r < 2 m_H $ in order to\nestimate the theory uncertainty.

This concept allows us to quantitatively compare patterns in social\nmedia activities between parts of a city, a number of cities, or any other\nspatial areas.

In a simulation, we show that our model\nreliably identifies regime shifts in cases where the data generating processes\ndisplay high, moderate, and low numbers of movements in the regression\nparameters. Finally, we illustrate the merits of our approach by means of two\napplications.

This provides a flexible and efficient regression\nmethodology for a comprehensive family of count models including Hermite,\nNeyman Type A, P\\'olya-Aeppli, negative binomial and Poisson-inverse Gaussian.\nThe estimating function approach allows us to extend the Poisson-Tweedie\ndistributions to deal with underdispersed count data by allowing negative\nvalues for the dispersion parameter $\\phi$. Furthermore, the Poisson-Tweedie\nfamily can automatically adapt to highly skewed count data with excessive\nzeros, without the need to introduce zero-inflated or hurdle components, by the\nsimple estimation of the power parameter. Thus, the proposed models offer a\nunified framework to deal with under, equi, overdispersed, zero-inflated and\nheavy-tailed count data. The computational implementation of the proposed\nmodels is fast, relying only on a simple Newton scoring algorithm. Simulation\nstudies showed that the estimating function approach provides unbiased and\nconsistent estimators for both regression and dispersion parameters. We\nhighlight the ability of the Poisson-Tweedie distributions to deal with count\ndata through a consideration of dispersion, zero-inflated and heavy tail\nindices, and illustrate its application with four data analyses.

A statistical test is proposed to split the layouts at possible\nstructural variation sites. The second type of iterations includes mapping,\nscaffolding/contig-extension, and contig merging.

In this work, we\novercome this limitation by modelling the mental lexicon of English-speaking\ntoddlers as a multiplex lexical network, i.e. a multi-layered network where\nN=529 words/nodes are connected according to four types of relationships: (i)\nfree associations, (ii) feature sharing, (iii) co-occurrence, and (iv)\nphonological similarity. We provide analysis of the topology of the resulting\nmultiplex and then proceed to evaluate single layers as well as the full\nmultiplex structure on their ability to predict empirically observed age of\nacquisition data of English speaking toddlers. We find that the emerging\nmultiplex network topology is an important proxy of the cognitive processes of\nacquisition, capable of capturing emergent lexicon structure. In fact, we show\nthat the multiplex topology is fundamentally more powerful than individual\nlayers in predicting the ordering with which words are acquired. Furthermore,\nmultiplex analysis allows for a quantification of distinct phases of lexical\nacquisition in early learners: while initially all the multiplex layers\ncontribute to word learning, after about month 23 free associations take the\nlead in driving word acquisition.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 5 figures and 2 tables.

In the paper, we use the heterogeneous mean-field\ntheory to derive the rate equation for governing the model's dynamics that can\nanalytically determine the critical noise $f_c$ in the limit of infinite\nnetwork size $N\\rightarrow \\infty$. The result shows that $f_c$ depends on the\nratio of ${\\left\\langle k \\right\\rangle }$ to ${\\left\\langle k^{3/2}\n\\right\\rangle }$, where ${\\left\\langle k \\right\\rangle }$ and ${\\left\\langle\nk^{3/2} \\right\\rangle }$ are the average degree and the $3/2$ order moment of\ndegree distribution, respectively.

This allows us to calculate the effective critical\nnoise $f_c(N)$ at which the susceptibility is maximal in finite size networks.\nWe find that the $f_c-f_c(N)$ decays with $N$ in a power-law way and vanishes\nfor $N\\rightarrow \\infty$.

Also, the equilibrium\ncharge state has been obtained using these ionization and recombination cross\nsections, and compared with the former equilibrium formulas. The equilibrium\ncharge state of projectiles in plasmas is not always reached, it depends mainly\non the projectile velocity and the plasma density.

Phase III designs that make better use of phase\nII data can facilitate drug development in orphan diseases.\n  A Bayesian meta-analytic approach is used to inform the phase III study with\nphase II data. It is particularly attractive, since uncertainty of\nbetween-trial heterogeneity can be dealt with probabilistically, which is\ncritical if the number of studies is small. Furthermore, it allows quantifying\nand discounting the phase II data through the predictive distribution relevant\nfor phase III. A phase III design is proposed which uses the phase II data and\nconsiders approval based on a phase III interim analysis. The design is\nillustrated with a non-inferiority case study from an FDA approval in herpetic\nkeratitis (an orphan disease). Design operating characteristics are compared to\nthose of a traditional design, which ignores the phase II data.\n  An analysis of the phase II data reveals good but insufficient evidence for\nnon-inferiority, highlighting the need for a phase III study. For the phase III\nstudy supported by phase II data, the interim analysis is based on half of the\npatients. For this design, the meta-analytic interim results are conclusive and\nwould justify approval. In contrast, based on the phase III data only, interim\nresults are inconclusive and would require further evidence.\n  To accelerate drug development for orphan diseases, innovative study designs\nand appropriate methodology are needed. Taking advantage of randomized phase II\ndata when analyzing phase III studies looks promising because the evidence from\nphase II supports informed decision making.

The formation histories, and thus ages, of dark matter halos\ncorrelate with their large-scale density $\\rho$, an effect known as assembly\nbias.

To clarify the comparison between\ntheory and observation, and to remove the strong environmental effects on\nsatellites, we use galaxy group catalogs to identify central galaxies and\nmeasure their quenched fraction, $f_Q$, as a function of large-scale\nenvironment. Models that match halo age to central galaxy age predict a strong\npositive correlation between $f_Q$ and $\\rho$.
