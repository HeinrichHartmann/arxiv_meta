However,\n17th-Century astronomers were uncertain of the long-term variation in the\ninclination of the Earth's axis and were suspicious of Ptolemy's equinox\nobservations. As a result, they produced a wide range of tropical years. Facing\nthis problem, Newton attempted to compute the length of the year on his own,\nusing the ancient equinox observations reported by a famous Greek astronomer\nHipparchus of Rhodes, ten in number. Though Newton had a very thin sample of\ndata, he obtained a tropical year only a few seconds longer than the correct\nlength. The reason lies in Newton's application of a technique similar to\nmodern regression analysis. Newton wrote down the first of the two so-called\n'normal equations' known from the ordinary least-squares (OLS) method. In that\nprocedure, Newton seems to have been the first to employ the mean (average)\nvalue of the data set, while the other leading astronomers of the era (Tycho\nBrahe, Galileo, and Kepler) used the median. Fifty years after Newton, in 1750,\nNewton's method was rediscovered and enhanced by Tobias Mayer. Remarkably, the\nsame regression method served with distinction in the late 1920s when the\nfounding fathers of modern cosmology, Georges Lemaitre (1927), Edwin Hubble\n(1929), and Willem de Sitter (1930), employed it to derive the Hubble constant.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 8 figures"]}]

In\nsteady-state, the distribution of CO$_2$ in the groundwater upstream of the\naquifer involves a balance between three competing effects: (i) the\nbuoyancy-driven flow of CO$_2$ saturated water; (ii) the diffusion of CO$_2$\nfrom saturated to under-saturated water; and (iii) the advection associated\nwith the oncoming background flow. This leads to three limiting regimes. In the\nlimit of very slow diffusion, a nearly static intrusion of dense fluid may\nextend a finite distance upstream, balanced by the pressure gradient associated\nwith the oncoming background flow. In the limit of fast diffusion relative to\nthe flow, a gradient zone may become established in which the along aquifer\ndiffusive flux balances the advection associated with the background flow.\nHowever, if the buoyancy-driven flow speed exceeds the background hydrological\nflow speed, then a third, intermediate regime may become established. In this\nregime, a convective recirculation develops upstream of the anticline involving\nthe vertical diffusion of CO$_2$ from an upstream propagating flow of dense\nCO$_2$ saturated water into the downstream propagating flow of CO$_2$\nunsaturated water. For each limiting case, we find analytical solutions for the\ndistribution of CO$_2$ upstream of the anticline, and test our analysis with\nfull numerical simulations. A key result is that, although there may be very\ndifferent controls on the distribution and extent of CO$_2$ bearing water\nupstream of the anticline, in each case the dissolution rate is given by the\nproduct of the background volume flux and the difference in concentration\nbetween the CO$_2$ saturated water and the original aquifer water upstream.\n"]}]

This information loss corresponds to a\nvolume decrease in our dual gravity model, which consists of a codimension one\nhypersurface embedded in a BTZ black hole background in three dimensions. There\nare matter fields defined on this hypersurface which are dual to Kondo field\ntheory operators. In the large N limit, the formation of the Kondo cloud\ncorresponds to the condensation of a scalar field. The entropy is calculated\naccording to the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription. This requires to determine the\nbackreaction of the hypersurface on the BTZ geometry, which is achieved by\nsolving the Israel junction conditions. We find that the larger the scalar\ncondensate gets, the more the volume of constant time slices in the bulk is\nreduced, shortening the bulk geodesics and reducing the impurity entropy. This\nprovides a new non-trivial example of an RG flow satisfying the g-theorem.\nMoreover, we find explicit expressions for the impurity entropy which are in\nagreement with previous field theory results for free electrons.

We concisely demonstrate this by\nproviding a table showing that (a) different metrics are used for many schemes\nto measure their performance and, (b) most schemes are evaluated on different\nclasses of underlying network topologies. Our results reveal that both the\nvalue and arrangement of the PPM-based scheme convergence times vary depending\non exactly the underlying network topology. As a result, this paper shows that\na side-by-side comparison of the scheme performance a complicated and turns out\nto be a crucial open problem in this research area.\n"]}]

The setting exists in many tasks\nsuch as semi-supervised image classification, image clustering, and image\nretrieval. Unlike previous methods, which develop or learn sophisticated\nregularizers for classifiers, our method learns a new image representation by\nexploiting the distribution patterns of all available data for the task at\nhand. Particularly, a rich set of visual prototypes are sampled from all\navailable data, and are taken as surrogate classes to train discriminative\nclassifiers; images are projected via the classifiers; the projected values,\nsimilarities to the prototypes, are stacked to build the new feature vector.\nThe training set is noisy. Hence, in the spirit of ensemble learning we create\na set of such training sets which are all diverse, leading to diverse\nclassifiers. The method is dubbed Ensemble Projection (EP). EP captures not\nonly the characteristics of individual images, but also the relationships among\nimages. It is conceptually simple and computationally efficient, yet effective\nand flexible. Experiments on eight standard datasets show that: (1) EP\noutperforms previous methods for semi-supervised image classification; (2) EP\nproduces promising results for self-taught image classification, where\nunlabeled samples are a random collection of images rather than being from the\nsame distribution as the labeled ones; and (3) EP improves over the original\nfeatures for image clustering.

This situation makes regularization both\nnecessary and desirable in order for estimators to possess theoretical\nguarantees. However, the amount of regularization, often determined by one or\nmore tuning parameters, is integral to achieving good performance. In practice,\nchoosing the tuning parameter is done through resampling methods (e.g.\ncross-validation), generalized information criteria, or reformulating the\noptimization problem (e.g. square-root lasso or scaled sparse regression). Each\nof these techniques comes with varying levels of theoretical guarantee for the\nlow- or high-dimensional regimes. However, there are some notable deficiencies\nin the literature.

A synergistic combination\nof these different heating events during one phase of sheath expansion is\nrequired to accelerate an electron to energies above the threshold for\nionization. The ambipolar electric field outside the sheath is found to be time\nmodulated due to a time modulation of the electron mean energy caused by the\npresence of sheath expansion heating only during one half of the RF period at a\ngiven electrode. This time modulation results in more electron heating than\ncooling inside the region of high electric field outside the sheath on time\naverage. If an electric field reversal is present during sheath collapse, this\ntime modulation and, thus, the asymmetry between the phases of sheath expansion\nand collapse will be enhanced.

The obfuscator can also satisfy one of a number of\nobfuscation conditions: black-box, information-theoretic black-box,\nindistinguishability, and best possible; the last two conditions come in three\nvariants: perfect, statistical, and computational. We discuss many\napplications, including CPA-secure quantum encryption, quantum\nfully-homomorphic encryption, and public-key quantum money.\n  We then prove several impossibility results, extending a number of\nfoundational papers on classical obfuscation to the quantum setting. We prove\nthat quantum black-box obfuscation is impossible in a setting where adversaries\ncan possess more than one output of the obfuscator. In particular, generic\ntransformation of quantum circuits into black-box-obfuscated quantum circuits\nis impossible. We also show that statistical indistinguishability obfuscation\nis impossible, up to an unlikely complexity-theoretic collapse. Our proofs\ninvolve a new tool: chosen-ciphertext-secure encryption of quantum data, which\nwas recently shown to be possible assuming quantum-secure one-way functions\nexist [Alagic et al '16].\n"]}]

We treat 1D and 2D tissues as\ncontinuous, deformable, growing geometries for sizes larger than 1mm. The\ndynamics of the growing tissue are described by a set of coupled tensor\nequations in non-Euclidean (curved) space. These coupled equations represent a\nnovel feedback mechanism between growth and curvature dynamics.\n  For 1D growth, numerical simulations are compared to two measures of root\ngrowth. First, modular growth along the simulated root shows an elongation zone\ncommon to many species of plant roots. Second, the relative elemental growth\nrate (REGR) calculated in silico exhibits temporal dynamics recently\ncharacterized in high-resolution root growth studies but which thus far lack a\nbiological hypothesis to explain them. Namely, the REGR can evolve from a\nsingle peak localized near the root tip to a double-peak structure. In our\nmodel, this is a direct consequence of considering growth as both a geometric\nreaction-diffusion process and expansion due to a distributed source of new\nmaterials.\n  In 2D, we study a circularly symmetric growing disk with emergent negative\ncurvatures. These results are compared against thin disk experiments, which are\na proxy model for plant leaves. These results also apply to the curvature\nevolution and the inhomogeneous growth pattern of the Acetabularia cap. Lastly,\nwe extend the model to anisotropic disks and predict the growth dynamics for a\n2D curved surface which develops an elongated shape with localized ruffling.\n  Our model also provides several measures of the dynamics of tissue growth.\nThese include the time evolution of the metric and velocity field, which are\ndynamical variables in the model, as well as expansion, shear and rotation\nwhich are deformation tensors characterizing the growth of the tissue.\n","Comment: PhD thesis, 188 pages.
