While in certain cases - e.g. the self-assembly of virus-like\npolyhedral cages from coordination building blocks - it is possible to control\nemergence in a systematic manner, the development of general approaches remains\na fundamental challenge in the field. In the conceptually-related domain of\nfrustrated magnetism - where collective states give rise to exotic physics of\nrelevance to data storage and spintronics - the task of predicting emergent\nbehaviour is simplified through control over the geometry and form of the\nmagnetic interactions from which complexity arises. Seeking to combine\napproaches from these two fields, we study here the solid phases of inorganic\npolymer chains assembled from non-magnetic gold(I)/silver(I) cations and\ncyanide anions. We show the periodic inter-chain potential encodes a\nsupramolecular interaction that can be tuned to mimic different magnetic\ninteractions between XY spins (\"spin rotors\"). Because the chains pack on a\ntriangular lattice, the crystal structures of gold(I)/silver(I) cyanides can be\ninterpreted in terms of the phase behaviour of triangular XY magnets. Complex\nmagnetic states predicted for this family - including hidden quadrupolar order\nand emergent spin-vortex quasiparticles - are realised for the first time in\nthe structural chemistry of these cyanide polymers. In this way we demonstrate\nboth how simple inorganic materials might behave as structural analogues of\notherwise-unrealisable \"toy\" spin models, and also how a theoretical\nunderstanding of those models might be used to predict and control emergent\nphenomena in chemical systems.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 3 figures.

In this paper, we take the first steps toward studying how the\napproximate I-Love-Q relations become exact in the limit as compact stars\nbecome black holes. To do so, we consider a toy model, i.e. incompressible\nstars with anisotropic pressure, which allows us to model an equilibrium\nsequence of stars with their compactness approaching the black hole limit\narbitrarily closely. We extract the I-Love-Q trio by numerically constructing\nsuch a sequence in the slow-rotation and small-tide approximations.

Our main result says that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex $r$-regular graph\nwhose transition matrix has second eigenvalue $\\lambda$, then the COBRA cover\ntime of $G$ is $\\mathcal O(\\log n )$, if $1-\\lambda$ is greater than a positive\nconstant, and $\\mathcal O((\\log n)/(1-\\lambda)^3))$, if $1-\\lambda \\gg\n\\sqrt{\\log( n)/n}$. These bounds are independent of $r$ and hold for $3 \\le r\n\\le n-1$. They improve the previous bound of $O(\\log^2 n)$ for expander graphs.\nOur main tool in analysing the COBRA process is a novel duality relation\nbetween this process and a discrete epidemic process, which we call a biased\ninfection with persistent source (BIPS). A fixed vertex $v$ is the source of an\ninfection and remains permanently infected. At each step each vertex $u$ other\nthan $v$ selects $k$ neighbours, independently and uniformly, and $u$ is\ninfected in this step if and only if at least one of the selected neighbours\nhas been infected in the previous step. We show the duality between COBRA and\nBIPS which says that the time to infect the whole graph in the BIPS process is\nof the same order as the cover time of the COBRA process\n"]}]

Due to mathematical complexity, a theory that could explain how the\nparameters of mesoscopic networks composed of a few tens of neurons affect the\nfunctional connectivity is still to be formulated. Yet, many interesting\nproblems in neuroscience involve the study of networks composed of a small\nnumber of neurons. Based on a recent study of the dynamics of small neural\ncircuits, we combine the analysis of local bifurcations of multi-population\nneural networks of arbitrary size with the analytical calculation of the\nfunctional connectivity. We study the functional connectivity in different\nregimes, showing that external stimuli cause the network to switch from\nasynchronous states characterized by weak correlation and low variability\n(local chaos), to synchronous states characterized by strong correlations and\nwide temporal fluctuations (critical slowing down). Local chaos typically\noccurs in large networks, but here we show that it can also be generated by\nstrong stimuli in small neural circuits. On the other side, critical slowing\ndown is expected to occur when the stimulus moves the network close to a local\nbifurcation. In particular, strongly positive correlations occur at the\nsaddle-node and Andronov-Hopf bifurcations of the network, while strongly\nnegative correlations occur when the network undergoes a spontaneous\nsymmetry-breaking at the branching-point bifurcations.

We oppose this opinion\nand show that two main factors are responsible for the extremely low intensity\nof the observed stellar EBL: (1) a low mean surface brightness of galaxies,\nwhich causes a low luminosity density in the local Universe, and (2) light\nextinction due to absorption by galactic and intergalactic dust. Dust produces\na partial opacity of galaxies and of the Universe. The galactic opacity reduces\nthe intensity of light from more distant background galaxies obscured by\nforeground galaxies. The effective extinction AV for light passing through a\ngalaxy is 0.2 mag. This causes that distant background galaxies do not\ncontribute to the EBL significantly. In addition, light of distant galaxies is\ndimmed due to absorption by intergalactic dust. Even a minute intergalactic\nopacity of 1x10^(-2) mag per Gpc is high enough to produce significant effects\non the EBL. The absorbed starlight heats up the galactic and intergalactic dust\nand is further re-radiated at the IR, FIR and micro-wave spectrum. Assuming\nstatic infinite universe with no galactic and intergalactic dust, the stellar\nEBL should be as high as the surface brightness of stars. However, if dust is\nconsidered, the predicted stellar EBL is about 290 nWm^(-2)sr^(-1), which is\nonly 5 times higher than the observed value. Hence, the presence of dust has\nhigher impact on the EBL than currently assumed. In the expanding universe, the\ncalculated value of the EBL is further decreased, because the obscuration\neffect and intergalactic absorption become more pronounced at high redshifts\nwhen the matter was concentrated at smaller volume than at present.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 3 figures"]}]

In contrast, it is shown that when that\nsubnetwork is indeed structurally balanced, the agents of the subnetwork evolve\ninto two polarized camps and the opinions of all other agents in the network\nspread between these two polarized opinions. Second, we consider time-varying\nneighbor relationships. We show that the opinion separation criteria carry over\nif the conditions for fixed graphs are extended to joint graphs. The results\nare developed for both discrete-time and continuous-time models.\n"]}]

The\naforementioned antenna, should be employed in both the transmitter and the\nreceiver sides, to approach the mentioned improvement. As a matter fact, in\nthis paper, we recommend space-time-polarization diversity instead of\nspace-time singly; therefore it is obvious that by employing the aforementioned\ntechnique, the system obtains more strength against destructive fading. The\nsimulations for different rates have confirmed that, utilizing ORIOL antenna\noutperforms patch microstrip one, which is roughly about $2$ to $3$ dB,\naccording to the rates.\n"]}]

The electric\npolarisability of graphene induces a force, that can be described by an image\ncharge. The analysis shows that graphene can be described as an imperfect\nconductor with a finite dielectric constant, $\\epsilon_r$, for weak coupling,\nand it behaves as a metal for strong fields. As a consequence, the interaction\nbetween polar molecules and graphene layer(s) tends to align the molecular\ndipole along the direction normal to the graphene, and quantitative estimates\nof the energy gain are given The strength of this interaction can be sufficient\nto overcome thermal effects when the molecule is close to the layer, even at\nroom temperature. Hence, boundary effects play a significant role in\ndetermining the structure of systems such as water confined in atomically\nnarrow van der Waals heterostructures.\n"]}]
