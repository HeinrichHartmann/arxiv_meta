These\ngalaxies are specifically selected to be heavily gas-dominated (Mgas/M* >~ 2.7)\nand to be oriented edge-on. The former property ensures that the error on the\ngalactic baryonic mass is small, despite the large systematic uncertainty\ninvolved in galactic stellar mass estimates. The latter property means that\nrotational velocities can be derived directly from the width of the 21cm\nemission line, without any need for inclination corrections. We measure a slope\nfor the linewidth-based BTFR of alpha = 3.75 +- 0.11, a value that is somewhat\nsteeper than (but in broad agreement with) previous literature results. The\nrelation is remarkably tight, with almost all galaxies being located within a\nperpendicular distance of +- 0.1 dex from the best fit line. The low\nobservational error budget for our sample enables us to establish that, despite\nits tightness, the measured linewidth-based BTFR has some small (i.e.,\nnon-zero) intrinsic scatter. We furthermore find a systematic difference in the\nBTFR of galaxies with \"double-horned\" 21cm line profiles and those with\n\"peaked\" profiles.

Since these condensations are embedded\nwithin the same parent gas core, their differing chemical properties are the\nmost likely due to the different warm-up histories, rather than the different\ndynamic timescales.

We use spectral imaging from the Herschel SPIRE iFTS to construct a\nmap of HF absorption at 243 micron in a 6x3.5 arcmin region surrounding NGC6334\nI and I(N).\n  Results. The combination of new, spatially fully sampled, but spectrally\nunresolved mapping with a previous, single-pointing, spectrally resolved HF\nsignature yields a 3D picture of absorbing gas clouds in the direction of\nNGC6334.

These systems are generally known as minisuperspace models. One of\ntheir important key features is the invariance of the corresponding reduced\nactions under reparametrizations of the independent variable, a fact that can\nbe seen as the remnant of the general covariance of the full theory. In the\ncase of a system of $n$ degrees of freedom, described by a Lagrangian quadratic\nin velocities, one can use the lapse by either gauge fixing it or letting it be\ndefined by the constraint and subsequently substitute into the rest of the\nequations. In the first case, the system is solvable for $n$ accelerations and\nthe constraint becomes a restriction among constants. In the second case, the\nsystem can only be solved for $n-1$ accelerations and the \"gauge\" freedom is\ntransferred to the choice of one of the scalar degrees of freedom. In this\npaper, we take the second path and express all $n-1$ scalar degrees of freedom\nin terms of the remaining one, say $q$. By considering these $n-1$ degrees of\nfreedom as arbitrary but given functions of $q$, we manage to extract a two\ndimensional pure gauge system consisting of the lapse $N$ and the arbitrary\n$q$: in a way, we decouple the reparametrization invariance from the rest of\nthe equations of motion. The solution of the corresponding quantum two\ndimensional system is used for the definition of a generalized probability for\nevery configuration $f^i (q)$, be it classical or not. The main result is that,\ninterestingly enough, this probability attains its extrema on the classical\nsolution of the initial $n$-dimensional system.\n","Comment: 19 pages, tex source file, no figures"]}]

These \"I-Love-Q\"\nrelations have important implications for astrophysics and gravitational-wave\nastronomy. An interesting problem is whether similar relations hold for other\ncompact objects and how they approach the black-hole limit. To answer these\nquestions, here we investigate the deformation properties of a large class of\nthin-shell gravastars, which are exotic compact objects that do not possess an\nevent horizon nor a spacetime singularity. Working in a small-spin and\nsmall-tidal field expansion, we calculate the moment of inertia, the quadrupole\nmoment, and the (quadrupolar electric) tidal Love number of gravastars with a\npolytropic thin shell. The I-Love-Q relations of a thin-shell gravastar are\ndrastically different from those of an ordinary neutron star. The Love number\nand quadrupole moment are negative for less compact models and the I-Love-Q\nrelations continuously approach the black-hole limit. We consider a variety of\npolytropic equations of state for the matter shell, and find no universality in\nthe I-Love-Q relations.

However, usage of the gas is being increasingly difficult due\nto the current world-wide shortage. Therefore, it is important to consider\nalternative methods of refrigeration. Here, we show that a new type of\nrefrigerant, super-heavy electron metal, YbCo$_2$Zn$_{20}$, can be used for\nadiabatic demagnetization refrigeration, which does not require 3He gas. A\nnumber of advantages includes much better metallic thermal conductivity\ncompared to the conventional insulating refrigerants. We also demonstrate that\nthe cooling performance is optimized in Yb$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$Co$_2$Zn$_{20}$ by\npartial Sc substitution with $x\\sim$0.19. The substitution induces chemical\npressure which drives the materials close to a zero-field quantum critical\npoint. This leads to an additional enhancement of the magnetocaloric effect in\nlow fields and low temperatures enabling final temperatures well below 100 mK.\nSuch performance has up to now been restricted to insulators.

An important factor for SecComp to be effective is that we find\nit is possible to devise a set of practical in-app policies to stop component\nhijacking.

The\nspecial case of extensions by the identity diffeomorphism was considered by A.\nPutman, whose work was one of the main sources of inspiration for the present\npaper.

At the microscopic\nlevel, each particle has its own mass, position and velocity, while at the\nmacroscopic level the particles are interpolated to a continuum quantity whose\nevolution is governed by a system of transport equations. This way, one can\nprescribe various types of interactions on a global scale, whilst still\nmaintaining high simulation speed for a large number of particles. In addition,\nthe interplay between particle motion and interaction is well tuned in both\nregions of low and high densities.\n  We analyse links between models on these two scales and prove that under\ncertain conditions, a system of interacting particles converges to a nonlinear\ncoupled system of transport equations. We use this as a motivation to derive a\nmodel defined on both modelling scales and prescribe the intercommunication\nbetween them. Simulation takes place in inhomogeneous domains with arbitrary\nconditions at inflow and outflow boundaries. We realise this by modelling\nobstacles, sources and sinks.

However, biological researches have shown\nthat not only gender but also the aging difference between the male and the\nfemale inevitably affect the age estimation. To our knowledge, so far there\nhave been two methods that have concerned the gender factor. The first is a\nsequential method which first classifies the gender and then performs age\nestimation respectively for classified male and female. Although it promotes\nage estimation performance because of its consideration on the gender semantic\ndifference, an accumulation risk of estimation errors is unavoidable. To\novercome drawbacks of the sequential strategy, the second is to regress the age\nappended with the gender by concatenating their labels as two dimensional\noutput using Partial Least Squares (PLS). Although leading to promotion of age\nestimation performance, such a concatenation not only likely confuses the\nsemantics between the gender and age, but also ignores the aging discrepancy\nbetween the male and the female.

The more viscous liquid L_1 is injected into\nthe channel from the center inlet, and the less viscous liquid L_2 from two\nside inlets. Liquid L_1 takes the form of a thin filament due to hydrodynamic\nfocusing in the long channel that leads to the diverging region. The thread\nthen becomes unstable to a folding instability, due to the longitudinal\ncompressive stress applied to it by the diverging flow of liquid L_2. Given the\nlong computation time, we were limited to a parameter study comprising five\nsimulations in which the flow rate ratio, the viscosity ratio, the Reynolds\nnumber, and the shape of the channel were varied relative to a reference model.\nIn our simulations, the cross section of the thread produced by focusing is\nelliptical rather than circular. The initial folding axis can be either\nparallel or perpendicular to the narrow dimension of the chamber. In the former\ncase, the folding slowly transforms via twisting to perpendicular folding, or\nit may remain parallel. The direction of folding onset is determined by the\nvelocity profile and the elliptical shape of the thread cross section in the\nchannel that feeds the diverging part of the cell.

We\nanalytically show that although DM interaction excites the entanglement of the\nsystem as expected, it surprizingly reduces the winning probability of the\ngame, acting like temperature or magnetic fields, and also show that the\neffects of DM interaction and inhomogeneous magnetic field on the winning\nprobability are identical. In addition, we show that XXZ model is considerably\nmore robust than XX model against destructive effects. Our results can open new\ninsights for quantum information processing with spin systems.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 4 color figures"]}]

The\nassociated tipping points are found to depend on the leading collective\nbeliefs, cognitive biases and prejudices of the social group which undertakes\nthe public debate. And here comes the sesame of the Trump campaign, which\ndevelops along two successive steps. During a first moment, Trump's statement\nproduces a majority of voters against him.

However, while specific restart strategies have been developed for\nspecific problems (and specific algorithms), restarts are typically not\nregarded as a general tool to speed up an optimization algorithm. In fact, many\noptimization algorithms do not employ restarts at all.\n  Recently, \"bet-and-run\" was introduced in the context of mixed-integer\nprogramming, where first a number of short runs with randomized initial\nconditions is made, and then the most promising run of these is continued. In\nthis article, we consider two classical NP-complete combinatorial optimization\nproblems, traveling salesperson and minimum vertex cover, and study the\neffectiveness of different bet-and-run strategies. In particular, our restart\nstrategies do not take any problem knowledge into account, nor are tailored to\nthe optimization algorithm. Therefore, they can be used off-the-shelf. We\nobserve that state-of-the-art solvers for these problems can benefit\nsignificantly from restarts on standard benchmark instances.\n","Comment: 15 pages"]}]
