This paper presents a novel\nsolution that seamlessly integrates two technologies, mobile cloud computing\nand microwave power transfer (MPT), to enable computation in passive\nlow-complexity devices such as sensors and wearable computing devices.\nSpecifically, considering a single-user system, a base station (BS) either\ntransfers power to or offloads computation from a mobile to the cloud; the\nmobile uses harvested energy to compute given data either locally or by\noffloading. A framework for energy efficient computing is proposed that\ncomprises a set of policies for controlling CPU cycles for the mode of local\ncomputing, time division between MPT and offloading for the other mode of\noffloading, and mode selection. Given the CPU-cycle statistics information and\nchannel state information (CSI), the policies aim at maximizing the probability\nof successfully computing given data, called computing probability, under the\nenergy harvesting and deadline constraints. The policy optimization is\ntranslated into the equivalent problems of minimizing the mobile energy\nconsumption for local computing and maximizing the mobile energy savings for\noffloading which are solved using convex optimization theory. The structures of\nthe resultant policies are characterized in closed form. Furthermore, given\nnon-causal CSI, the said analytical framework is further developed to support\ncomputation load allocation over multiple channel realizations, which further\nincreases computing probability.

Here, we predict that in the\nquantum regime a dynamic hysteresis with a rich phenomenology does appear when\nsweeping the driving amplitude in a finite time. The hysteresis area as a\nfunction of the sweep time reveals a double power-law decay, with a behavior\nqualitatively different from the mean-field predictions. The dynamic hysteresis\npower-law in the slow sweep limit defines a characteristic time, which depends\ndramatically on the size of the nonlinearity and on the frequency detuning\nbetween the driving and the resonator. In the strong nonlinearity regime, the\ncharacteristic time oscillates as a function of the intrinsic system parameters\ndue to multiphotonic resonances. We show that the dynamic hysteresis for the\nconsidered class of driven-dissipative systems is due to a non-adiabatic\nresponse region with connections to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for quenched\nphase transitions.

The WCDA consists of 3600 PhotoMultiplier Tubes (PMT)\nwhich collect the Cherenkov light produced by the shower particles in water.\nBoth high precision time and charge measurement are required over a large\ndynamic range from 1 photo electron (P.E.) to 4000 P.E. Prototype of an\nanalogue front-end Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) fabricated in\nChartered 0.35 {\\mu}m CMOS technology is designed to read out PMT signal in the\nWCDA. This ASIC employs leading edge discrimination and RC4 shaping structure;\ncombined with the following Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) and\nAnalog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), both the arrival time and charge of the PMT\nsignal can be measured. Initial test results indicate that time resolution is\nbetter than 350 ps and charge resolution is better than 10% at 1 P.E. and\nbetter than 1% with large input signals (300 P.E. to 4000 P.E.).

This large overlap manifests itself\nin a much higher critical field $B_c$ separating the range above it where the\nquantum peculiarities shift linearly with $V_g$ and the range below with a\ncomplicated behavior.

The\ntwo primary issues that complicate nanoparticle scanning laser image\ncorrelation (SLIC) based velocimetry are (1) the use of diffusion dominated\nnanoparticles as flow tracers, which introduce a random decorrelating error\ninto the velocity estimate, and (2) the effects of the scanning laser image\nacquisition, which introduces a bias error. To date, no study has quantified\nthese errors or demonstrated a means to deal with them in SLIC velocimetry. In\nthis work, we build upon the robust phase correlation (RPC) and existing\nmethods of SLIC to quantify and mitigate these errors. First, we implement an\nensemble RPC instead of using an ensemble standard cross correlation, and\ndevelop an SLIC optimal filter that maximizes the correlation strength in order\nto reliably and accurately detect the correlation peak representing the most\nprobable average displacement of the nanoparticles. Secondly, we developed an\nanalytical model of the SLIC measurement bias error due to image scanning of\ndiffusion dominated tracer particles.

Here, we study the evolution of the interband\nresponse within a model Hamiltonian which contains Dirac, Weyl and gapped\nsemimetal phases. In the pure Dirac case, a single linear dependence is\nobserved, while in the Weyl phase, we find two quasilinear regions with\ndifferent slopes. These regions are also distinct from the large-$\\Omega$\ndependence. As the boundary between the Weyl (WSM) and gapped phases is\napproached, the slope of the low-$\\Omega$ response increases, while the\nphoton-energy range over which it applies decreases. At the phase boundary, a\nsquare root behaviour is obtained which is followed by a gapped response in the\ngapped semimetal phase. The density of states parallels these behaviours with\nthe linear law replaced by quadratic behaviour in the WSM phase and the square\nroot dependence at the phase boundary changed to $|\\omega|^{3/2}$. The optical\nspectral weight under the intraband (Drude) response at low temperature ($T$)\nand/or small chemical potential ($\\mu$) is found to change from $T^2$ ($\\mu^2$)\nin the WSM phase to $T^{3/2}$ ($|\\mu|^{3/2}$) at the phase boundary.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 6 figures"]}]
