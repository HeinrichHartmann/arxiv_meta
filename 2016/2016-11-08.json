The\ndifferent mechanisms of quantum statistical dynamics that ensure the relaxation\nare exhibited.

It amounts to identify some formal \"q-probabilities\" with\nordinary frequencies, but only those which refer to the final pointer\nindications. The desired properties of ideal measurements, in particular the\nuniqueness of the result for each individual run and von Neumann's reduction,\nare thereby recovered with economic interpretations.

A ruler is shift\ninvariant only when its scale is properly calibrated to the pattern being\nmeasured.

Rotational invariance corresponds to pattern that does not depend on the\norder in which underlying processes occur, for example, a scale that additively\ncombines the component processes leading to observed values.

However, in experiments performed to date, spin-orbit torques\nhave an important limitation -- the component of torque that can compensate\nmagnetic damping is required by symmetry to lie within the device plane. This\nmeans that spin-orbit torques can drive the most current-efficient type of\nmagnetic reversal (antidamping switching) only for magnetic devices with\nin-plane anisotropy, not the devices with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy\nthat are needed for high-density applications. Here we show experimentally that\nthis state of affairs is not fundamental, but rather one can change the allowed\nsymmetries of spin-orbit torques in spin-source/ferromagnet bilayer devices by\nusing a spin source material with low crystalline symmetry.

Here, we examine real-world information flow in various social and\nscientific platforms including American Physical Society, Facebook, Twitter and\nLiveJournal. Since empirical data cannot be directly mapped to ideal\nmulti-source spreading, we leverage the behavioral patterns of users extracted\nfrom data to construct \"virtual\" information spreading processes. Our results\ndemonstrate that the set of spreaders selected by CI can induce larger scale of\ninformation propagation. Moreover, local measures as the number of connections\nor citations are not necessarily the deterministic factors of nodes' importance\nin realistic information spreading. This result has significance for rankings\nscientists in scientific networks like the APS, where the commonly used number\nof citations can be a poor indicator of the collective influence of authors in\nthe community.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Its P-GRB spectrum can be fitted by a\nconvolution of thermal spectra whose origin can be traced back to an axially\nsymmetric dyadotorus. A large value of the angular momentum of the newborn BH\nis consistent with the large energetics of this S-GRB, which reach in the\n1--10000 keV range $E_{iso}=(3.95\\pm0.21)\\times10^{52}$ erg and in the 0.1--100\nGeV range $E_{LAT}=(5.78\\pm0.60)\\times10^{52}$ erg, the most energetic GeV\nemission ever observed in S-GRBs.

An important special case\nof the transshipment problem is the single-source shortest paths (SSSP)\nproblem. Our gradient descent algorithm takes $ \\epsilon^{-3} polylog{n} $\niterations, and in each iteration it needs to solve the transshipment problem\nup to a multiplicative error of $ polylog n $, where $ n $ is the number of\nnodes. In particular, this allows us to perform a single iteration by computing\na solution on a sparse spanner of logarithmic stretch.

The $\\beta$\nsubunits have greater torso mobility by having fewer distributed, nonlocal\npacking interactions providing a spacious and soft connectivity, and offsetting\nthe resultant softness with local stiffness elements, including an additional\n$\\beta$ sheet. (2) A loop near the nucleotide binding-domain of the $\\beta$\nsubunits, absent in the $\\alpha$ subunits, swings to create a large variation\nin the occlusion of the nucleotide binding region. (3) A combination of the\nsoftest three eigenmodes significantly reduces the RMSD between the open and\nclosed conformations of the $\\beta$ subnits. (4) Comparisons of computed and\nobserved crystallographic B-factors suggest a suppression of a particular\nsymmetry axis in an $\\alpha$ subunit. (5) Unexpectedly, the soft intra-monomer\noscillations pertain to distortions that do not create inter-monomer steric\nclashes in the assembly, suggesting that structural optimization of the\nassembly evolved at all levels of complexity.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 9 figures"]}]

Recent exfoliation of phosphorene in\ndeoxygenated water promotes the need to re-examine the role of H2O and O2\nmolecules. Considering the presence of high population of vacancies in\nphosphorene, we investigate the interaction of H2O and O2 molecules with\nvacancy-contained phosphorene using first-principles calculations. In contrast\nto the common notion that physisorbed molecules tend to have a stronger\nadsorption at vacancy sites, we show that H2O has nearly the same adsorption\nenergy at the vacancy site as that at the perfect one. Charge transfer analysis\nshows that O2 is a strong electron scavenger, which transfers the lone-pair\nelectrons of the phosphorus atoms to the 2{\\pi}* antibonding orbital of O2. As\na result, the barrier for the O-O bond splitting to form O-P bonds is reduced\nfrom 0.81 eV at the perfect site to 0.59 eV at the defect site, leading to an\nabout 5000 faster oxidizing rate at the defect site than at the perfect site at\nroom temperature. Hence, our work reveals that the vacancy in phosphorene shows\na stronger oxygen affinity than the perfect phosphorene lattice site.\nStructural degradation of phosphorene due to oxidization may occur rapidly at\nedges and grain boundaries where vacancies tend to agglomerate.\n"]}]

The channels associated with\ndifferent transmitreceive pairs can be highly correlated due to the i) high\nprobability of line-of-sight (LOS) communication between user equipment (UE)\nand base station (BS), and ii) insufficient spacing between antenna elements at\nboth UE and BS. In this paper, we propose a novel transmission technique titled\nDiversity Pulse Shaped Transmission (DPST) to enhance the throughput over the\ncorrelated MIMO channels in an ultra-dense small cell network. The fundamental\nof DPST is to shape transmit signals at adjacent antennas with distinct\ninterpolating filters, introducing pulse shaping diversity. In DPST, each\nantenna transmits its own data stream with a relative deterministic time\noffset-which must be a fraction of the symbol period-with respect to the\nadjacent antenna. The delay is interpolated with the pulse shaped signal\ngenerating a virtual MIMO channel that benefits from increased diversity from\nthe receiver perspective. To extract the diversity, the receiver must operate\nin an over-sampled domain and hence a fractionally spaced equaliser (FSE) is\nproposed. The joint impact of DPST and FSE helps the receiver to sense a less\ncorrelated channel, eventually enhancing the UE's throughput. Moreover, in\norder to minimise the spatial correlation, we aim to optimise the deterministic\nfractional delay. Simulation results show that applying DPST to a correlated\nchannel can approximately enhance the UE throughput by 1.93x and 3.76x in 2x2\nand 4x4 MIMO systems, respectively.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 7 figures.

Specifically, this work demonstrates that the principle of\nparsimony, which has been questioned by several authors recently, is helpful in\nselecting the best model for forecasting seasonal river flow. Our work also\ndemonstrates the importance of model adequacy. An adequate model for seasonal\nriver flow must incorporate seasonal periodic correlation. The usual\nautoregressive-moving average (ARMA) and seasonal ARMA models are not adequate\nin this respect for seasonal river flow time series. A new diagnostic check,\nfor detecting periodic correlation in fitted ARMA models is developed in this\npaper. This diagnostic check is recommended for routine use when fitting\nseasonal ARMA models. It is shown that this diagnostic check indicates that\nmany seasonal economic time series also exhibit periodic correlation. Since the\nstandard forecasting methods are inadequate on this account, it can be\nconcluded that in many cases, the forecasts produced are sub-optimal. Finally,\na limitation of the arbitrary combination of forecasts is also illustrated.\nCombining forecasts from an adequate parsimonious model with an inadequate\nmodel did not improve the forecasts whereas combining the two forecasts of two\ninadequate models did yield an improvement in forecasting performance.

In this process, individuals are the vertices of a connected graph $G$.\nInitially, there is a single mutant vertex, chosen uniformly at random. In each\nstep, a random vertex is selected for reproduction with a probability\nproportional to its fitness: mutants have fitness $r>1$, while non-mutants have\nfitness 1. The vertex chosen to reproduce places a copy of itself to a\nuniformly random neighbor in $G$, replacing the individual that was there. The\nprocess ends when the mutation either reaches fixation (i.e., all vertices are\nmutants), or gets extinct. The principal quantity of interest is the\nprobability with which each of the two outcomes occurs.\n  A problem that has received significant attention recently concerns the\nexistence of families of graphs, called strong amplifiers of selection, for\nwhich the fixation probability tends to 1 as the order $n$ of the graph\nincreases, and the existence of strong suppressors of selection, for which this\nprobability tends to 0. For the case of directed graphs, it is known that both\nstrong amplifiers and suppressors exist.

As the density of base stations and devices\nincreases, inter-cell interference becomes a major obstacle in multi-cell\nnetworks. As such, identifying techniques that combine interference management\napproaches with NOMA is of great significance. After discussing the theory\nbehind NOMA, this paper provides an overview of the current literature and\ndiscusses key implementation and research challenges, with an emphasis on\nmulti-cell NOMA.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 4 figures, submitted to IEEE Communications Magazine"]}]

The study\nshows that low semantic level errors that hamper simplification are reasonably\ncovered in explicit representations, although many CAD quality testers are\nstill unaffordable for Small and Medium Enterprises, both in terms of cost and\ntraining time. Interoperability has been reasonably solved by standards like\nSTEP AP 203 and AP214, but model reusability is not feasible in explicit\nrepresentations. Procedural representations are promising, as interactive\nmodeling editors automatically prevent most morphologic errors derived from\nunsuitable modeling strategies. Interoperability problems between procedural\nrepresentations are expected to decrease dramatically with STEP AP242.

The joint\nFermi-LAT-H.E.S.S. spectrum allows the direct determination of the spectral\ncharacteristics of the parent particle population in leptonic and hadronic\nscenarios using only GeV-TeV data.\n  Results. An updated analysis of the H.E.S.S. data shows that the spectrum of\nthe entire SNR connects smoothly to the high-energy spectrum measured by\nFermi-LAT. The increased data set makes it possible to demonstrate that the\nH.E.S.S. spectrum deviates significantly from a power law and is well described\nby both a curved power law and a power law with an exponential cut-off at an\nenergy of Ecut = (6.7 +/- 1.2_stat +/- 1.2_syst) TeV. The joint\nFermi-LAT-H.E.S.S. spectrum allows the unambiguous identification of the\nspectral shape as a power law with an exponential cut-off. No significant\nevidence is found for a variation of the spectral parameters across the SNR,\nsuggesting similar conditions of particle acceleration across the remnant. A\nsimple modeling using one particle population to model the SNR emission\ndemonstrates that both leptonic and hadronic emission scenarios remain\nplausible. It is also shown that at least a part of the shell emission is\nlikely due to the presence of a pulsar wind nebula around PSR J0855-4644.\n","Comment: Manuscript submitted to A&A"]}]

Thus, in several scenarios, selecting\nthe most appropriate prediction model needs to be performed during runtime. To\nthis end, this paper introduces a supervisory output prediction scheme,\ntailored specifically for input-output stable bilinear systems, that intends on\nautomating the process of selecting the most appropriate prediction model\nduring runtime. The selection process is based upon a reinforcement-learning\nscheme, where prediction models are selected according to their prior\nprediction performance. An additional selection process is concerned with\nappropriately partitioning the control-inputs' domain in order to also allow\nfor switched-system approximations of the original bilinear dynamics.

Our derivation is a quite\nminimal one as it requires only the time independent evolution of scalar\nproducts and invariance under complex Lorentz transformations. The first of\nthese requirements does not force the Hamiltonian to be Hermitian. Rather, it\nforces its eigenvalues to either be real or to appear in complex conjugate\npairs, forces the eigenvectors of such conjugate pairs to be conjugates of each\nother, and forces the Hamiltonian to admit of an antilinear symmetry. The\nlatter requirement then forces this antilinear symmetry to be $CPT$, with\nHermiticity of a Hamiltonian thus only being a sufficient condition for $CPT$\nsymmetry and not a necessary one. $CPT$ symmetry thus has primacy over\nHermiticity, and it rather than Hermiticity should be taken as a guiding\nprinciple for constructing quantum theories. With conformal gravity being a\nnon-Hermitian theory, our approach allows us to construct a positive,\nghost-free norm for the theory, to thereby establish the unitarity of conformal\ngravity.

Since the cantilever has one end free, it has no\nresidual stress, thus the strain-independent component of the surface stress or\nintrinsic surface stress has no influence on the EPI, as long as it has small\ndeformation. The strain-dependent component of the surface stress or surface\nelasticity changes the bending stiffness of the cantilever and, consequently,\ninduces shifts in the EPI.
