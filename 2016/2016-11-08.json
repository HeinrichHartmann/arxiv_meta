The desired properties of ideal measurements, in particular the\nuniqueness of the result for each individual run and von Neumann's reduction,\nare thereby recovered with economic interpretations.

A ruler is shift\ninvariant only when its scale is properly calibrated to the pattern being\nmeasured.

Rotational invariance corresponds to pattern that does not depend on the\norder in which underlying processes occur, for example, a scale that additively\ncombines the component processes leading to observed values.

However, in experiments performed to date, spin-orbit torques\nhave an important limitation -- the component of torque that can compensate\nmagnetic damping is required by symmetry to lie within the device plane. This\nmeans that spin-orbit torques can drive the most current-efficient type of\nmagnetic reversal (antidamping switching) only for magnetic devices with\nin-plane anisotropy, not the devices with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy\nthat are needed for high-density applications. Here we show experimentally that\nthis state of affairs is not fundamental, but rather one can change the allowed\nsymmetries of spin-orbit torques in spin-source/ferromagnet bilayer devices by\nusing a spin source material with low crystalline symmetry.

Here, we examine real-world information flow in various social and\nscientific platforms including American Physical Society, Facebook, Twitter and\nLiveJournal. Since empirical data cannot be directly mapped to ideal\nmulti-source spreading, we leverage the behavioral patterns of users extracted\nfrom data to construct \"virtual\" information spreading processes. Our results\ndemonstrate that the set of spreaders selected by CI can induce larger scale of\ninformation propagation. Moreover, local measures as the number of connections\nor citations are not necessarily the deterministic factors of nodes' importance\nin realistic information spreading. This result has significance for rankings\nscientists in scientific networks like the APS, where the commonly used number\nof citations can be a poor indicator of the collective influence of authors in\nthe community.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 4 figures"]}]

An important special case\nof the transshipment problem is the single-source shortest paths (SSSP)\nproblem. Our gradient descent algorithm takes $ \\epsilon^{-3} polylog{n} $\niterations, and in each iteration it needs to solve the transshipment problem\nup to a multiplicative error of $ polylog n $, where $ n $ is the number of\nnodes. In particular, this allows us to perform a single iteration by computing\na solution on a sparse spanner of logarithmic stretch.

Using the quantum Monte Carlo method, we also investigate\nthe case of strong repulsive interactions. In the Mott phase, each layer\nexhibits a different amount of long-range magnetic order. Upon coupling both\nlayers, a valence-bond crystal is formed at a critical coupling strength.\nFinally, we discuss how these bilayer systems could be realized in existing\ncold atom experiments.\n","Comment: 8 figures"]}]

The channels associated with\ndifferent transmitreceive pairs can be highly correlated due to the i) high\nprobability of line-of-sight (LOS) communication between user equipment (UE)\nand base station (BS), and ii) insufficient spacing between antenna elements at\nboth UE and BS. In this paper, we propose a novel transmission technique titled\nDiversity Pulse Shaped Transmission (DPST) to enhance the throughput over the\ncorrelated MIMO channels in an ultra-dense small cell network. The fundamental\nof DPST is to shape transmit signals at adjacent antennas with distinct\ninterpolating filters, introducing pulse shaping diversity. In DPST, each\nantenna transmits its own data stream with a relative deterministic time\noffset-which must be a fraction of the symbol period-with respect to the\nadjacent antenna. The delay is interpolated with the pulse shaped signal\ngenerating a virtual MIMO channel that benefits from increased diversity from\nthe receiver perspective. To extract the diversity, the receiver must operate\nin an over-sampled domain and hence a fractionally spaced equaliser (FSE) is\nproposed. The joint impact of DPST and FSE helps the receiver to sense a less\ncorrelated channel, eventually enhancing the UE's throughput. Moreover, in\norder to minimise the spatial correlation, we aim to optimise the deterministic\nfractional delay.

In this process, individuals are the vertices of a connected graph $G$.\nInitially, there is a single mutant vertex, chosen uniformly at random. In each\nstep, a random vertex is selected for reproduction with a probability\nproportional to its fitness: mutants have fitness $r>1$, while non-mutants have\nfitness 1. The vertex chosen to reproduce places a copy of itself to a\nuniformly random neighbor in $G$, replacing the individual that was there. The\nprocess ends when the mutation either reaches fixation (i.e., all vertices are\nmutants), or gets extinct. The principal quantity of interest is the\nprobability with which each of the two outcomes occurs.\n  A problem that has received significant attention recently concerns the\nexistence of families of graphs, called strong amplifiers of selection, for\nwhich the fixation probability tends to 1 as the order $n$ of the graph\nincreases, and the existence of strong suppressors of selection, for which this\nprobability tends to 0. For the case of directed graphs, it is known that both\nstrong amplifiers and suppressors exist.

The training of VGAN takes a two\nstep procedure: given $p(\\mathbf{x})$, $q(\\mathbf{x})$ is updated to maximize\nthe lower bound; $p(\\mathbf{x})$ is then updated one step with samples drawn\nfrom $q(\\mathbf{x})$ to decrease the lower bound. VGAN is inspired by the\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs), where $p(\\mathbf{x})$ corresponds to\nthe discriminator and $q(\\mathbf{x})$ corresponds to the generator, but with\nseveral notable differences. We hence name our model variational GANs (VGANs).\nVGAN provides a practical solution to training deep EBMs in high dimensional\nspace, by eliminating the need of MCMC sampling. From this view, we are also\nable to identify causes to the difficulty of training GANs and propose viable\nsolutions. \\footnote{Experimental code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Shuangfei/vgan}\n","Comment: Under review at ICLR 2017"]}]

An updated analysis of the H.E.S.S. data shows that the spectrum of\nthe entire SNR connects smoothly to the high-energy spectrum measured by\nFermi-LAT. The increased data set makes it possible to demonstrate that the\nH.E.S.S. spectrum deviates significantly from a power law and is well described\nby both a curved power law and a power law with an exponential cut-off at an\nenergy of Ecut = (6.7 +/- 1.2_stat +/- 1.2_syst) TeV.

No significant\nevidence is found for a variation of the spectral parameters across the SNR,\nsuggesting similar conditions of particle acceleration across the remnant.

Our derivation is a quite\nminimal one as it requires only the time independent evolution of scalar\nproducts and invariance under complex Lorentz transformations. The first of\nthese requirements does not force the Hamiltonian to be Hermitian. Rather, it\nforces its eigenvalues to either be real or to appear in complex conjugate\npairs, forces the eigenvectors of such conjugate pairs to be conjugates of each\nother, and forces the Hamiltonian to admit of an antilinear symmetry. The\nlatter requirement then forces this antilinear symmetry to be $CPT$, with\nHermiticity of a Hamiltonian thus only being a sufficient condition for $CPT$\nsymmetry and not a necessary one. $CPT$ symmetry thus has primacy over\nHermiticity, and it rather than Hermiticity should be taken as a guiding\nprinciple for constructing quantum theories.

Since the cantilever has one end free, it has no\nresidual stress, thus the strain-independent component of the surface stress or\nintrinsic surface stress has no influence on the EPI, as long as it has small\ndeformation. The strain-dependent component of the surface stress or surface\nelasticity changes the bending stiffness of the cantilever and, consequently,\ninduces shifts in the EPI.
