For\n$\\alpha<\\alpha_c(T)$, a kind of insulator behavior emerges at any $T$.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Conversely, contrary to popular belief, we find that\ninformation is not negative entropy. However, unlike entropy, information can\nbe both positive and negative. We further find that it is possible to consider\na communications process as a working process and that Shannon's entropy is\nonly applicable to the modelling of statistical distributions. In extension, it\nappears that information could exist within any system, even thermodynamic\nsystems at equilibrium. Surprisingly, the amount of mechanical work a\nthermodynamic system can do directly relates to the appropriate corresponding\ninformation available. If the system does not have corresponding information,\nit can do no work irrespective of how much energy it may contain.

Bell's nonlocality for\nquantum states is usually detected by violation of some Bell's inequalities,\nsuch as Clause-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality for two qubits. Steering is a\nmanifestation of nonlocality intermediate between entanglement and Bell's\nnonlocality.

Long-range nuclear correlations are taken\ninto account by means of the continuum random-phase approximation (CRPA)\nframework. [Results] We present our calculations on flux-folded double\ndifferential, and flux-unfolded total cross sections off $^{12}$C and compare\nthem with MiniBooNE and (off-axis) T2K measurements. We discuss the importance\nof low-energy nuclear excitations for the forward bins. [Conclusions] The CRPA\npredictions describe the gross features of the measured cross sections. They\nunderpredict the data (more in the neutrino than in the antineutrino case)\nbecause of the absence of processes beyond pure quasielastic scattering in our\nmodel. At very forward muon scattering, low-energy nuclear excitations ($\\omega\n< $ 50 MeV) account for nearly 50% of the flux-folded cross section.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 9 figures.

One of the major\ndisadvantages of the multi-electron MC modeling is that the simulation process\nbecomes significantly slow as the concentration of electrons increases. This\nproblem makes it almost impossible to gain information about the electron\ntransport at high Fermi levels. Recently a single-particle MC model has been\nproposed which is based on the truncated density of localized states (DLOS) and\nbenefits from very short time execution. Although this model can successfully\nclarify the properties of the electron transport in moderately disordered\nsystems (e.g. nanocrystalline TiO2), utilizing the single-particle MC model for\na strongly disordered medium (e.g. nanocrystalline ZnO) may conducts erroneous\nestimation of the electron transport coefficient. The limitation of this\nsingle-particle MC model originates primarily from using a truncated DLOS.\nAnother obstacle of the model is that it ignores the spatial occupation of\nlocalized states in the transport medium. In this regard, for a strongly\ndisordered medium, the deviation of the single-particle MC model is quite large\nwhen compared with theoretical the predictions. Here, based on the modified\nelectron residence time in the localized states, we propose a different\nsingle-particle MC model which covers the aforementioned models' drawbacks and\nsimultaneously reduces the simulation time.

Recent studies have shown\nthat giant planets that migrate through the protoplanetary disk can accrete\nsubstantial amounts of oxygen-rich solids, leading to super-solar metallicities\nin the envelope and solar or sub-solar C/O ratios. Pebble accretion has been\ndemonstrated recently to play an important role in core accretion and to have\ngrowth rates that are consistent with planetary migration. The high pebble\naccretion rates allow planetary cores to start their growth beyond 10 AU and\nsubsequently migrate to cold (>~ 1 AU) or hot (<~ 0.1 AU) orbits. In this work\nwe investigate how the formation of giant planets via pebble accretion\ninfluences their atmospheric chemical compositions. We find that under the\nstandard pebble accretion scenario, where the core is isolated from the\nenvelope, the resulting metallicities (O/H and C/H ratios) are sub-solar, while\nthe C/O ratios are super-solar. Planets that migrate through the disk to become\nhot Jupiters accrete substantial amounts of water vapour, but still acquire\nslightly sub-solar O/H and super-solar C/O of 0.7-0.8. The metallicity can be\nsubstantially sub-solar (~0.2-0.5x solar) and the C/O can even approach 1.0 if\nthe planet accretes its envelope mostly beyond the CO2 ice line, i.e. cold\nJupiters or hot Jupiters that form far out and migrate in by scattering.\nAllowing for core erosion yields significantly super-solar metallicities and\nsolar or sub-solar C/O, which can also be achieved by other means, e.g.\nphotoevaporation and late-stage planetesimal accretion.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 4 figures.

The attraction it is so large that the 1NN pair\nOSA+V is no longer stable and relaxes spontaneously towards a new configuration\nwhere the OSA sits in the middle of the bond, the two ends of which are\ndecorated with two half-vacancies (V/2).

This is the aim of the\npresent contribution which establishes the expression of the diffusion\ncoefficient of the OSA and evaluates exactly the correlation factor in BCC and\nFCC lattices, thanks to the introduction of macrojumps. The formalism is\napplied to the case of Y in BCC iron and its results are compared to those\nobtained by previous authors. It is shown that the smallness of the correlation\nfactor is not due to the transport mechanism of the OSA but only to the jump\nfrequencies of the vacancy in the vicinity of the OSA. This smallness of the\ncorrelation factor is however overcompensated by a large macrojump frequency,\nand, as a result, the Y atom diffuses more rapidly than iron at all\ntemperatures by orders of magnitude in the two structures.\n","Comment: 47 pages, 8 figures, 8 tables, 7 appendices"]}]

In this article, the stability of the\nglacial-interglacial cycles is investigated on the basis of simple conceptual\nmodels. Specifically, we study the influence of additive white Gaussian noise\non the sequence of the glacial cycles generated by stochastic versions of\nseveral low-order dynamical system models proposed in the literature. In the\noriginal deterministic case, the models exhibit different types of attractors:\na quasiperiodic attractor, a piecewise continuous attractor, strange nonchaotic\nattractors, and a chaotic attractor.

Furthermore, these stochastic trajectories may show\nsensitive dependence on very small amounts of perturbations at key times.\nConsistently with the complexity of each attractor, the number of trajectories\nleaking from the clusters may range from almost zero (the model with a\nquasiperiodic attractor) to a significant fraction of the total (the model with\na chaotic attractor), the models with strange nonchaotic attractors being\nintermediate.

Moreover, this image\nprocessing is performed over overlapping patches, which can be efficiently\nsolved in the parallel or distributed manner. In this way, the proposed\nhigh-resolution imaging methodology could be applicable to large-scale\nmicrowave imaging problems.

We select 209 type 1 (i.e., unobscured), 464 type 1.5-1.9\n(partially obscured), and 281 type 2 (obscured) AGN within the GAMA II\ndatabase. Comparing the fractions of these with neighbouring galaxies out to a\npair separation of $350\\,\\text{kpc }h^{-1}$ and $\\Delta z < 0.012$ shows no\ndifference between AGN of different type, except at separations less than\n$20\\,\\text{kpc }h^{-1}$ where our observations suggest an excess of type 2 AGN\nin close pairs. We analyse the properties of the galaxies neighbouring our AGN\nand find no significant differences in colour or the star formation activity of\nthese galaxies. Further to this we find that $\\Sigma_5$ is also consistent\nbetween broad and narrow line AGN. We conclude that the observations presented\nhere are consistent with AGN unification.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

To that aim we perform a systematic study of even-even\nsd-shell nuclei. The wave function of these nuclei is taken as a configuration\nmixing built on orbitals of the sd-shell, and both the mixing coefficients of\nthe nuclear state and the single-particle wave functions are determined\nconsistently from the same variational principle. The calculations are done\nusing the D1S Gogny force. Various ground-state properties are analyzed. In\nparticular, the correlation content and composition of the wave function as\nwell as the single-particle orbitals and energies are examined. Binding\nenergies and charge radii are also calculated and compared to experiment. The\ndescription of the first excited state is also examined and the corresponding\ntransition densities are used as input for the calculation of inelastic\nelectron and proton scattering. Special attention is paid to the effect of the\noptimization of the single-particle states consistently with the correlations\nof the system. Globally, the results are satisfying and encouraging. In\nparticular, charge radii and excitation energies are nicely reproduced.\nHowever, the chosen valence-space truncation scheme precludes achieving maximum\ncollectivity in the studied nuclei. Further refinement of the method and a\nbetter-suited interaction are necessary to remedy this situation.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 14 figures, to be submitted to Phys. Rev. C"]}]

Our lower bound for Problem (2) implies\nthat the accuracy of the robust learning algorithm\nin~\\cite{DiakonikolasKKLMS16} is essentially best possible among all\npolynomial-time SQ algorithms. On the positive side, we give a new SQ learning\nalgorithm for this problem with optimal accuracy whose running time nearly\nmatches our lower bound. Both our SQ lower bounds are attained via a unified\nmoment-matching technique that may be useful in other contexts. Our SQ learning\nalgorithm for Problem (2) relies on a filtering technique that removes outliers\nbased on higher-order tensors.\n  Our lower bound technique also has implications for related inference\nproblems, specifically for the problem of robust {\\em testing} of an unknown\nmean Gaussian.
