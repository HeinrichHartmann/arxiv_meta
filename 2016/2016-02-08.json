Specifically, we have studied a von K\\'arm\\'an swirling\nflow with constant external torque applied to the stirrers. Two experiments\nwere performed at nearly equal Reynolds numbers, in geometrically similar\nexperimental setups. Air was utilized in one of them and water in the other.\nWith air, it was found that the probability density function of power\nfluctuations is strongly asymmetric, while with water, it is nearly Gaussian.\nThis suggests that the outcome of a big change of the fluid density in the\nflow-stirrer interaction is not simply a change in the amplitude of stirrers'\nresponse. In the case of water, with a density roughly 830 times greater than\nair density, the coupling between the flow and the stirrers is stronger, so\nthat they follow more closely the fluctuations of the average rotation of the\nnearby flow. When the fluid is air, the coupling is much weaker. The result is\nnot just a smaller response of the stirrers to the torque exerted by the flow;\nthe PDF of the injected power becomes strongly asymmetric and its spectrum\nacquires a broad region that scales as $f^{-2}$. Thus, the asymmetry of the\nprobability density functions of torque or angular speed could be related to\nthe inability of the stirrers to respond to flow stresses. This happens, for\ninstance, when the torque exerted by the flow is weak, due to small fluid\ndensity, or when the stirrers' moment of inertia is large. Moreover, a\ncorrelation analysis reveals that the features of the energy transfer dynamics\nwith water are qualitatively and quantitatively different to what is observed\nwith air as working fluid.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 7 figures.

As a consequence, a\nplethora of sparsity metrics has been presented in the literature. The\nappropriateness of these metrics is typically evaluated against a set of\nobjective criteria that has been proposed for assessing the credibility of any\nsparsity metric. In this paper, we propose a Generalised Differential Sparsity\n(GDS) framework for generating novel sparsity metrics whose functionality is\nbased on the concept that sparsity is encoded in the differences among the\nsignal coefficients. We rigorously prove that every metric generated using GDS\nsatisfies all the aforementioned criteria and we provide a computationally\nefficient formula that makes GDS suitable for high-dimensional signals. The\ngreat advantage of GDS is its flexibility to offer sparsity metrics that can be\nwell-tailored to certain requirements stemming from the nature of the data and\nthe problem to be solved. This is in contrast to current state-of-the-art\nsparsity metrics like Gini Index (GI), which is actually proven to be only a\nspecific instance of GDS, demonstrating the generalisation power of our\nframework. In verifying our claims, we have incorporated GDS in a stochastic\nsignal recovery algorithm and experimentally investigated its efficacy in\nreconstructing randomly projected sparse signals. As a result, it is proven\nthat GDS, in comparison to GI, both loosens the bounds of the assumed sparsity\nof the original signals and reduces the minimum number of projected dimensions,\nrequired to guarantee an almost perfect reconstruction of heavily compressed\nsignals. The superiority of GDS over GI in conjunction with the fact that the\nlatter is considered as a standard in numerous scientific domains, prove the\ngreat potential of GDS as a general purpose framework for measuring sparsity.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 4 figures, The abstract field cannot be longer than 1,920\n  characters: The abstract appearing here is slightly shorter than the one in\n  the pdf"]}]
