This method not only extracts smooth road\ncenterlines, but also connects the discontinuous road centerlines. Finally, to\novercome the ineffectiveness of current methods in the road intersection, a\nfitting based road centerline connection algorithm is proposed.

However, they are very rare and difficult to find when using\ncolor selection because of contamination from late-type dwarfs. High-redshift\nquasar surveys based on only optical colors suffer from incompleteness and low\nidentification efficiency, especially at $z\\gtrsim4.5$. We have developed a new\nmethod to select $4.7\\lesssim z \\lesssim 5.4$ quasars with both high efficiency\nand completeness by combining optical and mid-IR Wide-field Infrared Survey\nExplorer (WISE) photometric data, and are conducting a luminous $z\\sim5$ quasar\nsurvey in the whole Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) footprint. We have\nspectroscopically observed 99 out of 110 candidates with $z$-band magnitudes\nbrighter than 19.5 and 64 (64.6\\%) of them are quasars with redshifts of\n$4.4\\lesssim z \\lesssim 5.5$ and absolute magnitudes of $-29\\lesssim M_{1450}\n\\lesssim -26.4$. In addition, we also observed 14 fainter candidates selected\nwith the same criteria and identified 8 (57.1\\%) of them as quasars with\n$4.7<z<5.4$ . Among 72 newly identified quasars, 12 of them are at $5.2 < z <\n5.7$, which leads to an increase of $\\sim$36\\% of the number of known quasars\nat this redshift range. More importantly, our identifications doubled the\nnumber of quasars with $M_{1450}<-27.5$ at $z>4.5$, which will set strong\nconstraints on the bright end of the quasar luminosity function. We also expand\nour method to select quasars at $z\\gtrsim5.7$. In this paper we report the\ndiscovery of four new luminous $z\\gtrsim5.7$ quasars based on SDSS-WISE\nselection.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 10 figures"]}]

Our main proposal of this paper is that we\nregard the basic idea of ZDDs as a new computation, which we call\nzero-suppressed computation. We consider the zero-suppressed version of two\nclassical computation models, decision trees and branching programs, and show\nsome results. Although this paper is mainly written from the viewpoint of\ncomputational complexity theory, the concept of zero-suppressed computation can\nbe widely applied to various areas.\n"]}]
