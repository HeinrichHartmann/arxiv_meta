Their classification and information retrieval processing\nbecome a formidable task for the society. Due to the rapid growth of World Wide\nWeb, social and communication networks, new mathematical methods have been\ninvented to characterize the properties of these networks on a more detailed\nand precise level. Various search engines are essentially using such methods.\nIt is highly important to develop new tools to classify and rank enormous\namount of network information in a way adapted to internal network structures\nand characteristics. This review describes the Google matrix analysis of\ndirected complex networks demonstrating its efficiency on various examples\nincluding World Wide Web, Wikipedia, software architecture, world trade, social\nand citation networks, brain neural networks, DNA sequences and Ulam networks.\nThe analytical and numerical matrix methods used in this analysis originate\nfrom the fields of Markov chains, quantum chaos and Random Matrix theory.\n","Comment: 56 pages, 58 figures.

We introduce Information Topology in analogy\nwith information geometry as characterizing the \"abstract model\" of which\nstatistical models are realizations. Observations that change the topology,\ni.e., \"manifold collapse,\" require a modification of the abstract model in\norder to construct identifiable statistical models. Often, the essential\ntopological feature is a hierarchical structure of boundaries (faces, edges,\ncorners, etc.) which we represent as a hierarchical graph known as a Hasse\ndiagram. Low-dimensional elements of this diagram are simple models that\ndescribe the dominant behavioral modes, what we call emergent model classes.\nObservations that preserve the Hasse diagram are diffeomorphically related and\nform a group, the collection of which form a partially ordered set.

Namely, given $L \\ge 2$ response surfaces over a\ncontinuous input space $\\cal X$, the aim is to efficiently find the index of\nthe minimal response across the entire $\\cal X$. The response surfaces are not\nknown and have to be noisily sampled one-at-a-time. This setting is motivated\nby stochastic control applications and requires joint experimental design both\nin space and response-index dimensions. To generate sequential design\nheuristics we investigate stepwise uncertainty reduction approaches, as well as\nsampling based on posterior classification complexity. We also make connections\nbetween our continuous-input formulation and the discrete framework of pure\nregret in multi-armed bandits. To model the response surfaces we utilize\nkriging surrogates. Several numerical examples using both synthetic data and an\nepidemics control problem are provided to illustrate our approach and the\nefficacy of respective adaptive designs.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 7 figures (updated several sections and figures)"]}]

The ad benefits\nalso carry with costs. For example, too many ads can interfere the user\nexperience, leading to less user retention and reduced earnings ultimately. In\nthe paper, we aim at understanding the ad costs from users perspective. We\nutilize app reviews, which are widely recognized as expressions of user\nperceptions, to identify the ad costs concerned by users. Four types of ad\ncosts, i.e., number of ads, memory/CPU overhead, traffic usage, and bettery\nconsumption, have been discovered from user reviews. To verify whether\ndifferent ad integration schemes generate different ad costs, we first obtain\nthe commonly used ad schemes from 104 popular apps, and then design a framework\nnamed IntelliAd to automatically measure the ad costs of each scheme. To\ndemonstrate whether these costs indeed influence users reactions, we finally\nobserve the correlations between the measured ad costs and the user\nperceptions. We discover that the costs related to memory/CPU overhead and\nbattery consumption are more concerned by users, while the traffic usage is\nless concerned by users in spite of its obvious variations among different\nschemes in the experiments.

Our results are completely new for the Hardy-Sobolev case, and in\nthe Besov case they extend results recently obtained by Barton and Mayboroda.\n  First we develop a theory of BHS spaces adapted to operators which are\nbisectorial on $L^2$, with bounded $H^\\infty$ functional calculus on their\nranges, and which satisfy $L^2$ off-diagonal estimates.

As a corollary, any such\nsolution can be represented in terms of an abstract layer potential operator.\nWithin the classification region, we show that well-posedness is equivalent to\na certain boundary projection being an isomorphism.
