The CMB is cross-correlated with\ndifferent LSS tracers: the NVSS, SDSS and WISE catalogues, and the Planck 2015\nlensing map. This cross-correlation yields a detection at $4\\,\\sigma$, where\nmost of the signal-to-noise is due to the Planck lensing and NVSS. In fact, the\nISW effect is detected only from the Planck data (through the ISW-lensing\nbispectrum) at $\\approx 3\\,\\sigma$, which is similar to the detection level\nachieved by combining the cross-correlation signal coming from all the\ncatalogues. The ISW signal allow us to detect $\\Omega_\\Lambda$ at more than\n$3\\,\\sigma$. This cross-correlation analysis is performed only with the Planck\ntemperature data, since the polarization scales available in the 2015 release\ndo not permit significant improvement of the CMB-LSS cross-correlation\ndetectability. Nevertheless, polarization data is used to study the anomalously\nlarge ISW signal previously reported through the stacking of CMB features at\nthe locations of known superstructures. We find that the current Planck\npolarization data do not exclude that this signal could be caused by the ISW\neffect. In addition, the stacking of the Planck lensing map on the locations of\nsuperstructures exhibits a positive cross-correlation with these large-scale\nstructures. Finally, we have improved our previous reconstruction of the ISW\ntemperature fluctuations by combining the information encoded in all the\npreviously mentioned LSS tracers. In particular, we construct a map of the ISW\nsecondary anisotropies and the corresponding uncertainties map, obtained from\nsimulations.

Such models are commonly used to describe the dynamics of nonnegative\nsystems, with a wide range of application fields such as chemistry, systems\nbiology, process modeling or even transportation systems. Using a flux-based\ndescription of kinetic models, a canonical representation of the set of all\npossible feasible equilibria is developed.

Feasibility is imposed by a set of constraints, which are linear\non a log-transformed space of complexes, and relate to the kernel of a matrix,\nthe columns of which span the stoichiometric subspace. One particularly\ninteresting representation of these constraints can be expressed in terms of a\nclass of monotonous decreasing functions. This allows connections to be\nestablished with classical results in CRNT that relate to the existence and\nuniqueness of equilibria along positive stoichiometric compatibility classes.\nIn particular, monotonicity can be employed to identify regions in the set of\npossible reaction rate coefficients leading to complex balancing, and to\nconclude uniqueness of equilibria for a class of positive deficiency networks.\nThe latter result might support constructing an alternative proof of the\nwell-known deficiency one theorem.

This result offers an explanation for why gradient methods\nsucceed so frequently in quantum control in both theory and practice. The role\nof singular controls is analyzed using geometric tools in the case of the\ncontrol of the propagator of closed finite dimension systems. This type of\ncontrol field has been implicated as a source of landscape traps. The\nconditions under which singular controls can introduce traps, and thus\ninterrupt the progress of a control optimization, are discussed and a\ngeometrical characterization of the issue is presented. It is shown that a\ncontrol being singular is not sufficient to cause a control optimization\nprogress to halt and sufficient conditions for a trap free landscape are\npresented. It is further shown that the local surjectivity axiom of landscape\nanalysis can be refined to the condition that the end-point map is transverse\nto each of the level sets of the fidelity function. This novel condition is\nshown to be sufficient for a quantum system's landscape to be trap free. The\ncontrol landscape for a quantum system is shown to be trap free for all but a\nnull set of Hamiltonians using a novel geometric technique based on the\nparametric transversality theorem. Numerical evidence confirming this is also\npresented. This result is the analogue of the work of Altifini, wherein it is\nshown that controllability holds for all but a null set of quantum systems in\nthe dipole approximation.

The starting point of our work is the observation\nthat unrolled iterative methods have the form of a CNN (filtering followed by\npoint-wise non-linearity) when the normal operator (H*H, the adjoint of H times\nH) of the forward model is a convolution. Based on this observation, we propose\nusing direct inversion followed by a CNN to solve normal-convolutional inverse\nproblems.

The quantization precoder outputs\nare optimized, under appropriate transmitter and receiver filter bandwidth\nconstraints, to provide controlled inter-symbol-interference (ISI) enabling the\ninput symbols to be uniquely detected from 1-bit quantized observations with a\nlow-complexity symbol detector in the absence of noise. An additional\noptimization constraint is also imposed in the quantization precoder design to\nincrease the robustness against noise and residual inter-user-interference\n(IUI). The purpose of the spatial channel precoder, in turn, is to suppress the\nIUI and provide high beamforming gains such that good symbol-error rates (SERs)\ncan be achieved in the presence of noise and interference.

It was introduced by Neuts\n\\cite{Neuts1975} in 1975. The model describes the lifetime distribution of a\nfinite-state absorbing Markov chains, and has found many applications in wide\nrange of areas. It was brought to survival analysis by Aalen \\cite{Aalen1995}\nin 1995. However, the model has lacks of ability in modeling heterogeneity and\ninclusion of past information which is due to the Markov property of the\nunderlying process that forms the model. We attempt to generalize the\ndistribution by replacing the underlying by Markov mixtures process. Markov\nmixtures process was used to model jobs mobility by Blumen \\cite{Blumen} et al.\nin 1955. It was known as the mover-stayer model describing low-productivity\nworkers tendency to move out of their jobs by a Markov chains, while those with\nhigh-productivity tend to stay in the job. Frydman \\cite{Frydman2005} later\nextended the model to a mixtures of finite-state Markov chains moving at\ndifferent speeds on the same state space. In general the mixtures process does\nnot have Markov property. We revisit the mixtures model \\cite{Frydman2005} for\nmixtures of multi absorbing states Markov chains, and propose generalization of\nthe phase-type distribution under competing risks. The new distribution has two\nmain appealing features: it has the ability to model heterogeneity and to\ninclude past information of the underlying process, and it comes in a closed\nform. Built upon the new distribution, we propose conditional forward intensity\nwhich can be used to determine rate of occurrence of future events (caused by\ncertain type) based on available information.

The normalizable wave functions of gravity\nfluctuations around the brane describe only massive modes. We compute such wave\nfunctions analytically. We estimate the correction to gravitational potential\nfor small and long distances, and show that there is an intermediate range of\ndistances in which we can identify $4D$ gravity on the brane below a crossover\nscale given in terms of components of the $B$ field. The $4D$ gravity is\nmetastable and for distances much larger than the crossover scale the $5D$\ngravity is recovered.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 2 figures, Latex"]}]

Differential cross sections are\npresented as functions of up to three observables that describe the jet\nkinematics and the jet activity. Correlations between the azimuthal directions\nand the rapidities of the jets and the Z boson are studied in detail. The\npredictions of a number of multileg generators with leading or next-to-leading\norder accuracy are compared with the measurements. The comparison shows the\nimportance of including multi-parton contributions in the matrix elements and\nthe improvement in the predictions when next-to-leading order terms are\nincluded.\n","Comment: Submitted to JHEP"]}]
