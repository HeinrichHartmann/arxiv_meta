This phenomenon has been studied for more than\n15 years, but most of the literatures studied software as a black box, none of\nthem uncovered the fundamental and widely accepted mechanism of software aging\nas far as we know. Through analyzing the characteristics between biological\naging and software aging, we find some interesting common points and bridge the\ngap between these two seemingly unrelated phenomena. The free radical aging\ntheory in biological studies is also applicative to explore the mechanism and\nmodel of software aging. This paper finds an equivalent concept named `software\nfree radical' in software aging to free radical in biological aging. In our\nstudy, the accumulation of `software free radical' is a root cause of software\naging. Using the free radical modeling methodology in biological aging, we give\na model for describing the kinetic of software aging based on feedback loops.\nAlthough this paper doesn't give enough theoretical proof of the modeling\nmethod, the practical results show that the feedback loop model can describe\nthe kinetic of software aging precisely. To further validate the aging\nmechanism, we propose several software rejuvenation strategies focusing on\ncleaning the `software free radical'. The results show that software aging can\nbe mitigated effectively by strengthening negative feedback loop or weakening\npositive feedback loop.

In addition to considering the widely used centrality\nmetrics, we introduce a new centrality measure, the degree mass. The m order\ndegree mass of a node is the sum of the weighted degree of the node and its\nneighbors no further than m hops away. We find that the B_{n}, the closeness,\nand the components of x_{1} are strongly correlated with the degree, the\n1st-order degree mass and the 2nd-order degree mass, respectively, in both\nnetwork models and real-world networks.

The\npredicted radial velocity dispersion profile evolves to forms still consistent\nwith the measured profile, proving structural stability of the point mass\napproximation and the reliability of the resulting mass estimate of\n$2.1\\times10^{11}\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ within $150\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$. We also find\nan interesting coincidence with the recent estimates based on the kinematics of\nthe extended Orphan Stream. As a byproduct, we obtain the equations of motion\nin axial symmetry from a nonstandard Hamiltonian, and derive a formula in the\nspherical symmetry relating the radial velocity dispersion profile to a\ndirectly measured kinematical observable.\n","Comment: v2: refs to Orphan Stream, shortened & clearer text, figures to\n  black&white;"]}]

This leads to new inequivalent crystallographic Ce sites\nresulting in a re-distribution of spin densities. Our analysis using the\nsimplest structural approximant shows that in this metallic system Ce ions\nco-exist in different valence states. Localized 4f states that fulfill the\nthird Hund's rule are found to be close to the ideal Ce3+ state (at sites with\nthe largest Ce-Ru interatomic distances) whereas Ce(4-delta)+ valence states\nare found to be itinerant and situated at Ce sites with much shorter Ce-Ru\ndistances. The similarity to the famous alpha-gamma transition in elemental\ncerium is discussed.\n","Comment: 3 figures, 1 table"]}]

We find that these quantum corrections change the picture of\nHawking radiation greatly when the size of BH approaches the Planck scale. They\nprevent the BH from total evaporation, predicting the existence of a quantum BH\nremnant, which may introduce a possible resolution for the catastrophic\nbehavior of Hawking radiation as the BH mass approaches zero.

In this paper, we consider a new and complementary problem of how to\nfurther increase the influence spread of given seeders. Our study is motivated\nby the observation that direct incentives could \"boost\" users so that they are\nmore likely to be influenced by friends. We study the $k$-boosting problem\nwhich aims to find $k$ users to boost so that the final \"boosted\" influence\nspread is maximized. The $k$-boosting problem is different from the IM problem\nbecause boosted users behave differently from seeders: boosted users are\ninitially uninfluenced and we only increase their probability to be influenced.\nOur work also complements the IM studies because we focus on triggering larger\ninfluence spread on the basis of given seeders. Both the NP-hardness of the\nproblem and the non-submodularity of the objective function pose challenges to\nthe $k$-boosting problem. To tackle the problem on general graphs, we devise\ntwo efficient algorithms with the data-dependent approximation ratio. For the\n$k$-boosting problem on bidirected trees, we present an efficient greedy\nalgorithm and a rounded dynamic programming that is a fully polynomial-time\napproximation scheme. We conduct extensive experiments using real social\nnetworks and synthetic bidirected trees. We show that boosting solutions\nreturned by our algorithms achieves boosts of influence that are up to several\ntimes higher than those achieved by boosting solutions returned by intuitive\nbaselines, which have no guarantee of solution quality. We also explore the\n\"budget allocation\" problem in our experiments. Compared with targeting seeders\nwith all budget, larger influence spread is achieved when we allocation the\nbudget to both seeders and boosted users.\n"]}]

Furthermore, in terms of the occupation of centrals at fixed\nhalo mass, our results favor lack of correlation with halo concentration in the\nmost luminous samples ($M_{\\rm r}<-21.5,-21$), modest levels of correlation for\n$M_{\\rm r}<-20.5,-20, -19.5$ samples, lack of correlation for $M_{\\rm\nr}<-19,-18.5$ samples, and anti-correlation for the faintest sample $M_{\\rm\nr}<-18$.\n  We show that in comparison with abundance-matching mock catalogs, our\nfindings suggest qualitatively similar but modest levels of the impact of\nassembly bias on galaxy clustering. That is, the effect is only present in the\ncentral occupation and becomes less significant in brighter galaxy samples.\nFurthermore, by performing model comparison based on information criteria, we\nfind that in most cases, the mass-only HOD model is still favored by the\nobservations.\n","Comment: 37 pages, 8 figures, submitted to ApJ, comments are welcomed"]}]

A\ncharacterization of local commutative rings for which each ideal is quasi-flat\n(resp. quasi-projective) is given. It is also proven that each commutative ring\nR whose finitely generated ideals are quasi-flat is of $\\lambda$-dimension\n$\\le$ 3, and this dimension $\\le$ 2 if R is local. This extends a former result\nabout the class of arithmetical rings. Moreover, if R has a unique minimal\nprime ideal then its finitely generated ideals are quasi-projective if they are\nquasi-flat. In [1] Abuhlail, Jarrar and Kabbaj studied the class of commutative\nfqp-rings (finitely generated ideals are quasi-projective). They proved that\nthis class of rings strictly contains the one of arithmetical rings and is\nstrictly contained in the one of Gaussian rings. It is also shown that the\nproperty for a commutative ring to be fqp is preserved by localization. It is\nknown that a commutative ring R is arithmetical (resp. Gaussian) if and only if\nR M is arithmetical (resp. Gaussian) for each maximal ideal M of R. But an\nexample given in [6] shows that a commutative ring which is a locally fqp-ring\nis not necessarily a fqp-ring. So, in this cited paper the class of fqf-rings\nis introduced. Each local commutative fqf-ring is a fqp-ring, and a commutative\nring is fqf if and only if it is locally fqf. These fqf-rings are defined in\n[6] without a definition of quasi-flat modules. Here we propose a definition of\nthese modules and another definition of fqf-ring which is equivalent to the one\ngiven in [6]. We also introduce the module property of self-flatness. Each\nquasi-flat module is self-flat but we do not know if the converse holds. On the\nother hand, each flat module is quasi-flat and any finitely generated module is\nquasi-flat if and only if it is flat modulo its annihilator. In Section 2 we\ngive a complete characterization of local commutative rings for which each\nideal is self-flat. These rings R are fqp and their nilradical N is the subset\nof zerodivisors of R. In the case where R is not a chain ring for which N = N 2\nand R N is not coherent every ideal is flat modulo its annihilator. Then in\nSection 3 we deduce that any ideal of a chain ring (valuation ring) R is\nquasi-projective if and only if it is almost maximal and each zerodivisor is\nnilpotent. This complete the results obtained by Hermann in [11] on valuation\ndomains. In Section 4 we show that each commutative fqf-ring is of\n$\\lambda$-dimension $\\le$ 3. This extends the result about arithmetical rings\nobtained in [4]. Moreover it is shown that this $\\lambda$-dimension is $\\le$ 2\nin the local case.

This allows the cluster merging process\nto start from this partition rather than from a trivial partition composed\nsolely of singletons.

Traditional implementations of Strassen-like fast matrix\nmultiplication (FMM) algorithms often do not perform well except for very large\nmatrix sizes, due to the increased cost of memory movement, which is\nparticularly noticeable for non-square matrices. Such implementations also\nrequire considerable workspace and modifications to the standard BLAS\ninterface. We propose a code generator framework to automatically implement a\nlarge family of FMM algorithms suitable for multiplications of arbitrary matrix\nsizes and shapes. By representing FMM with a triple of matrices [U,V,W] that\ncapture the linear combinations of submatrices that are formed, we can use the\nKronecker product to define a multi-level representation of Strassen-like\nalgorithms. Incorporating the matrix additions that must be performed for\nStrassen-like algorithms into the inherent packing and micro-kernel operations\ninside GEMM avoids extra workspace and reduces the cost of memory movement.\nAdopting the same loop structures as high-performance GEMM implementations\nallows parallelization of all FMM algorithms with simple but efficient data\nparallelism without the overhead of task parallelism. We present a simple\nperformance model for general FMM algorithms and compare actual performance of\n20+ FMM algorithms to modeled predictions.
