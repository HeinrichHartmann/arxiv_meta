In both tasks, target variables often exhibit\nstatistical dependencies and exploiting them in order to improve predictive\naccuracy is a core challenge.

More traditional approaches attempt to address overparameterization by\nselecting a low lag order, based on the assumption that dynamic dependence\namong components is short-range.

Applying an external\nmagnetic field of sufficiently high intensity (in the range of 0.5-1 Tesla for\noperating pressures in the range of 5-15 atmospheres) causes the electrons to\nproduce helical tracks. Assuming the tracks can be properly reconstructed, the\nsign (direction) of curvature can be determined at several points along these\ntracks, and such information can be used to separate signal (0nbb) events\ncontaining two electrons producing a track with two different directions of\ncurvature from background (single-electron) events producing a track that\nshould spiral in a single direction.

Using the constrained single-nucleon momentum distribution in a\nnonlinear relativistic mean field (RMF) model, we study the equation of state\n(EOS) of asymmetric nucleonic matter (ANM), especially the density dependence\nof nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\\rm{sym}}(\\rho)$. Firstly, as a test of the\nmodel, the average nucleon kinetic energy extracted recently from\nelectron-nucleus scattering experiments using a neutron-proton dominance model\nis well reproduced by the RMF model incorporating effects of the SRC-induced\nhigh momentum nucleons, while it is significantly under predicted by the RMF\nmodel using a step function for the single-nucleon momentum distribution as in\nfree Fermi gas (FFG) models.

During the tutoring process, where students take on the\nrole of the tutor to teach a computer agent tutee, learners have been observed\nto gain deeper understanding of the subject matter. Teachable agents are\ncommonly used in the areas of science and mathematics learning where learners\nare able to learn complex concepts and deep reasoning by teaching the teachable\nagent through graphic representation such as concept maps.\n  Literature review on teachable agents as well as observations during field\nstudies conducted by the researcher, have shown that many current teachable\nagents lack the interaction abilities required to keep learners engage in\nlearning tasks. The result of this is learners deviating from the teaching\nprocess, and thus the learners are unable to benefit fully from learning with\nthe teachable agent. The applications of teachable agents are restricted to the\nlearning of academic subjects such as mathematics and science.\n  In this book, we have proposed the Persuasive Teachable Agent (PTA), a\nteachable agent based on the theoretical framework of persuasion, computational\nand goal-oriented agent modelling. We argue that the PTA, an autonomous agent,\ncapable of encouraging attitude and behavioural change can offer a more\nmeaningful and engaging learning experiences for learners from different age\ngroups. Based on the findings from our research we argue that persuasive\nfeedback actions generated by the PTA provide significant influence over\nlearner's decision to participate in intergenerational learning. The PTA plays\na crucial role in the development of future persuasive technologies in\nartificially intelligent agents.\n","Comment: This is a book draft"]}]
