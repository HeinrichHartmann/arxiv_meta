In both tasks, target variables often exhibit\nstatistical dependencies and exploiting them in order to improve predictive\naccuracy is a core challenge.

More traditional approaches attempt to address overparameterization by\nselecting a low lag order, based on the assumption that dynamic dependence\namong components is short-range.

The cold front width varies from 4 kpc down to\nclose to the electron mean free path. Inside the front are multiple metallicity\nblobs on scales of 5-10 kpc, which could have been uplifted by AGN activity,\nalso explaining the central metallicity drop and flat inner metallicity\nprofile. Close to the nucleus are multiple shocks, including a 1.9-kpc-radius\ninner shell-like structure and a weak 1.1-1.4 Mach number shock around the\ncentral cavities. Within a 10 kpc radius are 9 depressions in surface\nbrightness, several of which appear to be associated with radio emission. The\nshocks and cavities imply that the nucleus has been repeatedly active on 5-10\nMyr timescales, indicating a tight balance between heating and cooling. We\nconfirm the presence of a series of linear quasi-periodic structures. If they\nare sound waves, the ~5 kpc spacing implies a period of 6 Myr, similar to the\nages of the shocks and cavities. Alternatively, these structures may be\nKelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, their associated turbulence or amplified\nmagnetic field layers.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 32 figures, accepted by MNRAS"]}]

This poses a challenge to existing Copy-Move Forgery Detection\n(CMFD) methods which match the key points / blocks, solely based on the pair\nsimilarity in the scene. To address such issue, we propose a novel CMFD method\nusing Scaled Harris Feature Descriptors (SHFD) that preform consistently well\non forged images with SGO. It involves the following main steps: (i) Pyramid\nscale space and orientation assignment are used to keep scaling and rotation\ninvariance; (ii) Combined features are applied for precise texture description;\n(iii) Similar features of two points are matched and RANSAC is used to remove\nthe false matches. The experimental results indicate that the proposed\nalgorithm is effective in detecting SGO and copy-move forgery, which compares\nfavorably to existing methods. Our method exhibits high robustness even when an\nimage is operated by geometric transformation and post-processing\n","Comment: The version of ICASSP2016 submission"]}]

The equivalence arises from\nan analysis of the particular form of phase polynomials generated by $CNOT$ and\n$T$ gates. As a consequence, we derive an algorithm for the optimization of\n$T$-count in $\\{CNOT, T\\}$ quantum circuits based on Reed-Muller decoders,\nalong with a new upper bound of $O(n^2)$ on the number of $T$ gates required to\nimplement an $n$-qubit unitary over $CNOT$ and $T$ gates. We further generalize\nthis result to show that minimizing finer angle $Z$-rotations corresponds to\ndecoding lower order binary Reed-Muller codes. In particular, we show that\nminimizing the number of $R_z(\\pi/2^k)$ gates in circuits over $\\{CNOT,\nR_z(\\pi/2^k)\\}$ corresponds to minimum distance decoding in the length $2^n-1$\npunctured Reed-Muller code of order $(n-k-2)$.\n","Comment: 19 pages"]}]
