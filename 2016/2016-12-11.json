The aim of the survey is to complement existing HST images\nof PPN and to connect various types of nebulosities with physical and chemical\nproperties of their central stars. Nebulosities are detected in 15 of 33\nsources. Images and photometric and geometric measurements are presented. For\nsources with nebulosities we see a morphological bifurcation into two groups,\nDUPLEX and SOLE, as previous studies have found. We find further support to the\nprevious results suggesting that this dichotomy is caused by a difference in\noptical thickness of the dust shell. The remaining 18 sources are classified as\nstellar post-AGB objects, because our observations indicate a lack of\nnebulosity. We show that some stellar sources may in fact be DUPLEX or SOLE\nbased on their infrared colors. The cause of the differences among the groups\nare investigated. We discuss some evidence suggesting that high progenitor-mass\nAGB stars tend to become DUPLEX post-AGB objects. Intermediate progenitor-mass\nAGB stars tend to be SOLE post-AGB objects. Most of the stellar sources\nprobably have low mass progenitors and do not seem to develop nebulosities\nduring the post-AGB phase and therefore do not become planetary nebulae.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 11 figures"]}]

The observation is here\nturned into a novel local search optimization algorithm dubbed Record Dynamics\nOptimization, or RDO. RDO uses the Metropolis rule to accept or reject\ncandidate solutions depending on the value of a parameter akin to the\ntemperature, and minimizes the cost function of the problem at hand through\ncycles where its `temperature' is raised and subsequently decreased in order to\nexpediently generate record high (and low) values of the cost function. Below,\nRDO is introduced and then tested by searching the ground state of the\nEdwards-Anderson spin-glass model, in two and three spatial dimensions. A\npopular and highly efficient optimization algorithm, Parallel Tempering (PT) is\napplied to the same problem as a benchmark. RDO and PT turn out to produce\nsolution of similar quality for similar numerical effort, but RDO is simpler to\nprogram and additionally yields geometrical information on the system's\nconfiguration space which is of interest in many applications. In particular,\nthe effectiveness of RDO strongly indicates the presence of the above mentioned\nhierarchically organized configuration space, with metastable regions indexed\nby the cost (or energy) of the transition states connecting them.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 12 figures"]}]

In electropositive gases, DLs were\nformed at very low pressures between 0.1 and 1 mTorr with the plasma expansion\nforced by a strongly diverging magnetic field. The DL remains static, robust to\nchanges in boundary conditions, and its position is related to the magnetic\nfield lines.

The actual profile of the electronegative DL\nis very sensitive to external parameters and intrusive elements, and they\npropagate at high negative ion fraction. Electrostatic probes measurements and\nlaser-induced photodetachment show discontinuities in all plasma parameters\nelectron density, electron temperature, negative ion fraction at the DL\nposition.

The absorber consists\nof two different ionization components. By tracking the response in the opacity\nof the gas in each component to changes in the ionizing continuum, we were able\nto constrain the electron density of the system. The measured densities require\nthat the high and low ionization absorbing components of NGC 4051 must be\ncompact, at distances 0.5-1.0 l-d (2200 - 4400Rs) and < 3.5 l-d (< 15800Rs)\nfrom the continuum source, respectively. This rules out an origin in the dusty\nobscuring torus, as the dust sublimation radius is at least an order of\nmagnitude larger (>12 l-d). An accretion disk origin for the warm absorber wind\nis strongly suggested, and an association with the high ionization, HeII\nemitting, broad emission line region (radius <2 l-d) is possible. The two\ndetected phases are consistent with pressure equilibrium, which suggests that\nthe absorber consists of a two phase medium. A radial flow in a spherical\ngeometry is unlikely, and a conical wind geometry is preferred. The implied\nmass outflow rate from this wind, can be well constrained, and is 2-5% of the\nmass accretion rate. If the mass outflow rate scaling with accretion rate is\nrepresentative of all quasars, our results imply that warm absorbers in\npowerful quasars are unlikely to produce important evolutionary effects on\ntheir larger environment, unless we are observing the winds before they get\nfully accelerated. Only in such a scenario can AGN winds be important for\ncosmic feedback.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication on ApJ on Dec 15, 2006. 13 Figures, 4 Tables"]}]
