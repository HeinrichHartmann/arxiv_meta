Our main results are:\n  (1) There is a constant $c_1$ such that for every $k\\geq 2^{c_1nd}$, there\ndoes not exist an abelian $k$-lift $H$ of any $n$-vertex $d$-regular base graph\nwith $H$ being almost Ramanujan (nontrivial eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix\nat most $O(\\sqrt{d})$ in magnitude). This can be viewed as an analogue of the\nwell-known no-expansion result for abelian Cayley graphs.\n  (2) A uniform random lift in a cyclic group of order $k$ of any $n$-vertex\n$d$-regular base graph $G$, with the nontrivial eigenvalues of the adjacency\nmatrix of $G$ bounded by $\\lambda$ in magnitude, has the new nontrivial\neigenvalues also bounded by $\\lambda+O(\\sqrt{d})$ in magnitude with probability\n$1-ke^{-\\Omega(n/d^2)}$. In particular, there is a constant $c_2$ such that for\nevery $k\\leq 2^{c_2n/d^2}$, there exists a lift $H$ of every Ramanujan graph in\na cyclic group of order $k$ with $H$ being almost Ramanujan. We use this to\ndesign a quasi-polynomial time algorithm to construct almost Ramanujan\nexpanders deterministically.\n  The existence of expanding lifts in cyclic groups of order $k=2^{O(n/d^2)}$\ncan be viewed as a lower bound on the order $k_0$ of the largest abelian group\nthat produces expanding lifts. Our results show that the lower bound matches\nthe upper bound for $k_0$ (upto $d^3$ in the exponent).\n"]}]

As we will see,\nalready in the simplest case, the statements of the results in the\nsub-Riemannian setting are quite different from those in the Riemannian one.\nLet us consider a sub-Riemannian (sR) metric on a closed three-dimensional\nmanifold with an oriented contact distribution. There exists a privileged\nchoice of the contact form, with an associated Reeb vector field and a\ncanonical volume form that coincides with the Popp measure. We establish a\nQuantum Ergodicity (QE) theorem for the eigenfunctions of any associated sR\nLaplacian under the assumption that the Reeb flow is ergodic. The limit measure\nis given by the normalized Popp measure.This is the first time that such a\nresult is established for a hypoelliptic operator, whereas the usual Shnirelman\ntheorem yields QE for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a closed Riemannian\nmanifold with ergodic geodesic flow.To prove our theorem, we first establish a\nmicrolocal Weyl law, which allows us to identify the limit measure and to prove\nthe microlocal concentration of the eigenfunctions on the characteristic\nmanifold of the sR Laplacian. Then, we derive a Birkhoff normal form along this\ncharacteristic manifold, thus showing that, in some sense, all 3D contact\nstructures are microlocally equivalent. The quantum version of this normal form\nprovides a useful microlocal factorization of the sR Laplacian. Using the\nnormal form, the factorization and the ergodicity assumption, we finally\nestablish a variance estimate, from which QE follows.We also obtain a second\nresult, which is valid without any ergodicity assumption: every Quantum Limit\n(QL) can be decomposed in a sum of two mutually singular measures: the first\nmeasure is supported on the unit cotangent bundle and is invariant under the sR\ngeodesic flow, and the second measure is supported on the characteristic\nmanifold of the sR Laplacian and is invariant under the lift of the Reeb flow.\nMoreover, we prove that the first measure is zero for most QLs.\n"]}]

Each of the standard scenarios proposed, involving rapid\naccretion of seed black holes or black hole mergers, faces severe theoretical\ndifficulties in explaining the short-time formation of supermassive objects. In\nthis work we propose an alternative scenario for the formation of SMBH in the\nearly Universe, in which energy transfer from superconducting cosmic strings\npiercing small seed black holes is the main physical process leading to rapid\nmass increase. As a toy model, the accretion rate of a seed black hole pierced\nby two antipodal strings carrying constant current is considered. Using an\neffective action approach, which phenomenologically incorporates a large class\nof superconducting string models, we estimate the minimum current required to\nform SMBH with masses of order $M = 2 \\times 10^{9}M_{\\odot}$ by $z = 7.085$.\nThis corresponds to the mass of the central black hole powering the quasar ULAS\nJ112001.48+064124.3 and is taken as a test case scenario for early-epoch SMBH\nformation. For GUT scale strings, the required fractional increase in the\nstring energy density, due to the presence of the current, is of order\n$10^{-7}$, so that their existence remains consistent with current\nobservational bounds on the string tension. In addition, we consider an\n\"exotic\" scenario, in which an SMBH is generated when a small seed black hole\nis pierced by a higher-dimensional $F-$string, predicted by string theory.

Systematic differences exist, for\nexample, between mesh-based and particle-based codes in the low density region,\nand between more diffusive and less diffusive schemes in the high density tail\nof the density distribution.

We consider a social network (the host) that sells\nad-engagements to advertisers by inserting their ads, in the form of promoted\nposts, into the feeds of carefully selected \"initial endorsers\" or seed users:\nthese users receive monetary incentives in exchange for their endorsements. The\nendorsements help propagate the ads to the feeds of their followers.

The quantum dot is considered as a three-level ladder system with\nground, one-exciton, and bi-exction states. As compared to the case of a\ntwo-level quantum dot model, adding the third (bi-exciton) state produces\nfascinating effects in the optical response of the hybrid system.

The effects originate from competing one-exciton and bi-exciton\ntransitions in the semiconductor quantum dot, triggered by the self-action of\nthe quantum dot via the metal nanoparticle.

First, we investigate the case of\nhalf-duplex nodes where a node can either transmit or receive in a given time\ninstant. The network is said to be naturally sparse if the number of\nnonempty-queue transmitters in a given frame is much smaller than the number of\nusers, which is the case when the arrival rates to the queues are very small\nand the number of users is large. If the network is not naturally sparse, we\ndesign the user requests to be sparse such that only few requests are sent to\nthe destination. We refer to the detected nonempty-queue transmitters in a\ngiven frame as frame owners. Our design goal is to minimize the nodes' total\ntransmit power in a given frame. In the case of unslotted-time data\ntransmission, the optimization problem is shown to be a convex optimization\nprogram. We propose an approximate formulation to simplify the problem and\nobtain a closed-form expression for the assigned time durations to the nodes.\nThe solution of the approximate optimization problem demonstrates that the time\nduration assigned to a node in the set of frame owners is the ratio of the\nsquare-root of the buffer occupancy of that node to the sum of the square-roots\nof each occupancy of all the frame owners. We then investigate the slotted-time\ndata transmission scenario, where the time durations assigned for data\ntransmission are slotted. In addition, we show that the full-duplex capability\nof a node increases the data transmission portion of the frame and enables a\ndistributed implementation of the proposed schemes.\n","Comment: Accepted IEEE 12th International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and\n  Sensor Systems 2015"]}]

We\nexplain the basic principles and limitations of all types of MD methods used to\nstudy unfolding and folding in a way accessible to non-specialists. We discuss\nthe potential role of G-hairpin, G-triplex and alternative GQ intermediates in\nthe folding process. We argue that, in general, folding of GQs is fundamentally\ndifferent from funneled folding of small fast-folding proteins, and can be best\ndescribed by a kinetic partitioning (KP) mechanism. KP is a competition between\nat least two (but often many) well-separated and structurally different\nconformational ensembles.\n  Major conclusions: The KP mechanism is the only plausible way to explain\nexperiments reporting long time-scales of GQ folding and the existence of\nlong-lived sub-states. A significant part of the natural partitioning of the\nfree energy landscape of GQs comes from the ability of the GQ-forming sequences\nto populate a large number of syn-anti patterns in their G-tracts.

Rupert Riedl, for\nexample, an early pioneer of evolutionary developmental biology, suggested that\nthe evolution of complex adaptations is facilitated by a developmental\norganization that is itself shaped by past selection to facilitate evolutionary\ninnovation. However, selection for characteristics that enable future\ninnovation seems paradoxical: natural selection cannot favor structures for\nbenefits they have not yet produced, and favoring characteristics for benefits\nthat have already been produced does not constitute future innovation. Here we\nresolve this paradox by exploiting a formal equivalence between the evolution\nof evolvability and learning systems. We use the conditions that enable simple\nlearning systems to generalize, i.e., to use past experience to improve\nperformance on previously unseen, future test cases, to demonstrate conditions\nwhere natural selection can systematically favor developmental organizations\nthat benefit future evolvability. Using numerical simulations of evolution on\nhighly epistatic fitness landscapes, we illustrate how the structure of evolved\ngene regulation networks can result in increased evolvability capable of\navoiding local fitness peaks and discovering higher fitness phenotypes. Our\nfindings support Riedl's intuition: Developmental organizations that \"mimic\"\nthe organization of constraints on phenotypes can be favored by short-term\nselection and also facilitate future innovation. Importantly, the conditions\nthat enable the evolution of such surprising evolvability follow from the same\nnon-mysterious conditions that permit generalization in learning systems.\n"]}]

The DU mode allows for parallelism\nand thus takes advantage of multicore hardware. In contrast to DU, the SM mode\nguarantees abort-free execution, so it is suitable for irrevocable operations\nand transactions generating high contention. For expressiveness, transactions\ncan be discarded or retried on demand. We formally prove that the higher\nflexibility of the scheme does not come at the cost of weaker guarantees for\nclients: HTR satisfies strong consistency guarantees akin to those provided by\nother popular transactional replication schemes such as Deferred Update\nReplication. We developed HTR-enabled Paxos STM, an object-based distributed\ntransactional memory system, and evaluated it thoroughly under various\nworkloads. We show the benefits of using a novel oracle, which relies on\nmachine learning techniques for automatic adaptation to changing conditions. In\nour tests, the ML-based oracle provides up to 50% improvement in throughput\nwhen compared to the system running with DU-only or SM-only oracles.

In this\nstudy, we show that strong electromagnetic fields localized in the nanostar\ntips are able to generate large numbers of energetic (hot) electrons, which can\nbe used for photochemistry. To compute plasmonic nanocrystals with complex\nshapes, we develop a quantum approach based on the effect of surface generation\nof hot electrons. We then apply this approach to nanostars, nanorods and\nnanospheres. We found that that the plasmonic nanostars with multiple hot spots\nhave the best characteristics for optical generation of hot electrons compared\nto the cases of nanorods and nanospheres. Generation of hot electrons is a\nquantum effect and appears due to the optical transitions near the surfaces of\nnanocrystals. The quantum properties of nanocrystals are strongly size- and\nmaterial-dependent. In particular, the silver nanocrystals significantly\novercome the case of gold for the quantum rates of hot-electron generation.\nAnother important factor is the size of a nanocrystal. Small nanocrystals are\nmore efficient for the hot-electron generation since they exhibit stronger\nquantum surface effects.

Many approaches to\ndevelop a consistent varying speed of light (VSL) theory have been developed\nrecently. Although a lot of theoretical debate has sprout out about their\nfeasibility and reliability, the most obvious and straightforward way to\ndiscriminate and check if such theories are really workable has been missed out\nor not fully employed. What is meant here is the comparison of these theories\nwith observational data in a fully comprehensive way. In this paper we try to\naddress this point i.e., by using the most updated cosmological probes, we test\nthree different candidates for a VSL theory (Barrow & Magueijo, Avelino &\nMartins, and Moffat) signal. We consider many different ans\\\"{a}tze for both\nthe functional form of $c(z)$ (which cannot be fixed by theoretical\nmotivations) and for the dark energy dynamics, in order to have a clear global\npicture from which we extract the results. We compare these results using a\nreliable statistical tool such as the Bayesian Evidence. We find that the\npresent cosmological data is perfectly compatible with any of these VSL\nscenarios, but in one case (Moffat model) we have a higher Bayesian Evidence\nratio in favour of VSL than in the standard $c=$ constant $\\Lambda$CDM\nscenario. Moreover, in such a scenario, the VSL signal can help to strengthen\nconstraints on the spatial curvature (with indication toward an open universe),\nto clarify some properties of dark energy (exclusion of a cosmological constant\nat $2\\sigma$ level) and is also falsifiable in the nearest future due to some\npeculiar issues which differentiate this model from the standard model.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 2 tables, comments are welcome"]}]
