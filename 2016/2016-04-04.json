This,\nin turn, leads to a redistribution of all electrons in the host, and, if\ndesigned properly, changes the location of the Fermi level EF and the density\nof conducting charge carriers near EF. The principle is proven experimentally\nin elemental Bi, whereby group III elements In and Ga dope Bi p-type, in spite\nof the fact that all three atoms are trivalent in the solid state. Electronic\nstructure calculations show the formation of a hyperdeep defect state (HDS) and\nits effect on the EF in Bi doped with In (Bi:In) and Ga (Bi:Ga). The HDS at -5\nto -6 eV below the EF of elemental Bi hybridizes with the Bi 6p electrons, and\ndeprives the Bi valence band of two electrons per impurity atom. This then\nperturbs the electron count in the solid and lowers the EF. The charge on the\nimpurity atoms is unchanged. In principle, this doping action does not result\nin the appearance of ionized impurities that scatter conduction electrons and\nholes in conventional doping. Experimentally, Shubnikov - de Haas and Hall\nEffect measurements show that adding In to Bi results in an increase in the\ndensity of holes. Thermoelectric, galvanomagnetic and thermomagnetic data are\ngiven for single-crystal and polycrystalline samples. In-doping leads to an\nenhancement of the thermoelectric figure of merit, which suggests that the new\ndoping mechanism also gives a route to develop better thermoelectric materials.\nThe same mechanism is at work for Sn-doped Bi (Bi:Sn), although here ionized\nimpurity scattering is not avoided.\n","Comment: ver. 3, much extended and rewritten, supplement included"]}]

A potential candidate material is tin\nmonoxide (SnO), which has exceptional doping and transport properties among\noxides, but suffers from a low adsorption coefficient due to its strongly\nindirect band gap.

Many experiments have investigated and observed such\nstructural adaptation. However, there is still much uncertainty about how to\ndefine the reference mechanical state at which bone structure is adapted and\nstable. Clinical and experimental observations show that this reference state\nvaries both in space and in time, over a wide range of timescales. We propose\nan osteocyte-based mechanostat theory that links various timescales of\nstructural adaptation with various dynamic features of the osteocyte network in\nbone. This theory assumes that osteocytes are formed adapted to their current\nlocal mechanical environment through modulation of morphological and genotypic\nosteocyte properties involved in mechanical sensitivity. We distinguish two\nmain types of physiological responses by which osteocytes subsequently modify\nthe reference mechanical state. One is the replacement of osteocytes during\nbone remodelling, which occurs over the long timescales of bone turnover. The\nother is cell desensitisation responses, which occur more rapidly and\nreversibly during an osteocyte's lifetime. The novelty of this theory is to\npropose that long-lasting morphological and genotypic osteocyte properties\nprovide a material basis for a long-term mechanical memory of bone that is\ngradually reset by bone remodelling. We test this theory by simulating\nlong-term mechanical disuse (modelling spinal cord injury), and short-term\nmechanical loadings (modelling daily exercises) with a mathematical model. The\nconsideration of osteocyte desensitisation and of osteocyte replacement by\nremodelling is able to capture the different phenomena and timescales observed\nduring the mechanical adaptation of bone tissues, lending support to this\ntheory.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 6 figures"]}]

Suppose\n(X,Y) denotes a risk vector pertaining to two components in some system. A\nrelevant measurement of risk contagion would be to quantify the amount of\ninfluence of high values of Y on X. This can be measured in a variety of ways.\nIn this paper, we study two such measures: the quantity E[max(X-t,0)|Y > t]\ncalled Marginal Mean Excess (MME) as well as the related quantity E[X|Y > t]\ncalled Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES). Both quantities are indicators of\nrisk contagion and useful in various applications ranging from finance,\ninsurance and systemic risk to environmental and climate risk. We work under\nthe assumptions of multivariate regular variation, hidden regular variation and\nasymptotic tail independence for the risk vector (X,Y). Many broad and useful\nmodel classes satisfy these assumptions. We present several examples and derive\nthe asymptotic behavior of both MME and MES as the threshold t tends to\ninfinity. We observe that although we assume asymptotic tail independence in\nthe models, MME and MES converge to 1 under very general conditions; this\nreflects that the underlying weak dependence in the model still remains\nsignificant. Besides the consistency of the empirical estimators, we introduce\nan extrapolation method based on extreme value theory to estimate both MME and\nMES for high thresholds t where little data are available.

We give both\nqualitative understanding and numerical predictions of this effect. We consider\ntwo models. The first is based on conservation of energy and is easier to\nimplement, but cannot determine the speeds along the rubber bands without\nmaking assumptions. The second, treats the bands as a series of mass points\nsubject to being pulled by immediately adjacent mass points according to how\nmuch the rubber has been stretched on the two adjacent sides.

Typical MC simulations\napproximate degenerate carrier populations as Fermi distributions to model the\nPauli-blocking (PB) of scattering to occupied final states. To allow for\nincreasingly far-from-equilibrium non-Fermi carrier distributions in\nultra-scaled devices, we instead generate the final-state occupation\nprobabilities used for PB by sampling the local carrier populations as a\nfunction of energy and energy valley. This process is aided by the use of\nfractional carriers or sub-carriers, which minimizes classical carrier-carrier\nscattering.

For the Bayesian inverse problem, the forward\nmodel needs to be repeatedly computed for a large number of samples to get a\nstationary chain. This requires large computational efforts. To significantly\nimprove the computation efficiency, we use generalized multiscale finite\nelement method and least-squares stochastic collocation method to construct a\nreduced computational model. To avoid the difficulty of choosing regularization\nparameter, hyperparameters are introduced to build a hierarchical model. We use\ntruncated Karhunen-Loeve expansion (KLE) to reduce the dimension of the\nparameter spaces and decrease the mixed time of Markov chains. The techniques\nof hyperparameter and KLE are incorporated into the model reduction method. The\nreduced model is constructed offline. Then it is computed very efficiently in\nthe online sampling stage. This strategy can significantly accelerate the\nevaluation of the Markov chain and the resultant posterior distribution\nconverges fast. We analyze the convergence for the approximation between the\nposterior distribution by the reduced model and the reference posterior\ndistribution by the full-order model.
