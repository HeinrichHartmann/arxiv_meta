Due to some beautiful\nand effective features, this IT structure proves well suited for data\nclustering. Although there exist some redundant edges in IT, they usually have\nsalient features and thus it is not hard to remove them.\n  Subsequently, in order to prevent the seemingly redundant edges from\noccurring, we proposed the Nearest Neighbor Descent (NND) by adding the\n\"Neighborhood\" constraint on ND. Consequently, clusters automatically emerged,\nwithout the additional requirement of removing the redundant edges. However,\nNND proved still not perfect, since it brought in a new yet worse problem, the\n\"over-partitioning\" problem.\n  Now, in this paper, we propose a method, called the Hierarchical Nearest\nNeighbor Descent (H-NND), which overcomes the over-partitioning problem of NND\nvia using the hierarchical strategy. Specifically, H-NND uses ND to effectively\nmerge the over-segmented sub-graphs or clusters that NND produces. Like ND,\nH-NND also generates the IT structure, in which the redundant edges once again\nappear. This seemingly comes back to the situation that ND faces. However,\ncompared with ND, the redundant edges in the IT structure generated by H-NND\ngenerally become more salient, thus being much easier and more reliable to be\nidentified even by the simplest edge-removing method which takes the edge\nlength as the only measure. In other words, the IT structure constructed by\nH-NND becomes more fitted for data clustering. We prove this on several\nclustering datasets of varying shapes, dimensions and attributes. Besides,\ncompared with ND, H-NND generally takes less computation time to construct the\nIT data structure for the input data.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 9 figures"]}]

By\nwhich means, which forces, are embryonic cells and tissues assembled, deformed,\nand eventually organized into an animal? Because embryogenesis deeply questions\nour understanding of the mechanisms of life, it has motivated many scientific\ntheories and philosophies over the course of history. While genetics now seems\nto have emerged as a natural background to study embryogenesis, it was intuited\nlong ago that it should also rely on mechanical forces and on the physical\nproperties of cells and tissues. In the early 20th century, Stephane Leduc\nproposed that biology was merely a subset of fluid physics, and argued that\nbiology should focus on how forces act on living matter. Rejecting vitalism and\nlife-specific approaches, he designed naive experiments based on osmosis and\ndiffusion to mimic shapes and phenomena found in living systems, in order to\nidentify physical mechanisms that could support the development of the embryo.\nWhile Leduc's ideas then had some impact in the field, notably on later\nacclaimed D'Arcy Thompson, they fell into oblivion during the later 20th\ncentury. In this article I give an overview of Stephane Leduc's physical\napproach to life, and show that the paradigm that he introduced, although long\nforsaken, becomes more and more topical today, as developmental biology\nincreasingly turns to physics and self-organization theories to study the\nmechanisms of embryogenesis.

We used records of\nthe 14C and 10Be cosmogenic isotopes, current numerical models of the isotope\nproduction and transport in Earth's atmosphere, and available geomagnetic field\nreconstructions, including a new reconstruction relying on an updated\narcheo-/paleointensity database. The obtained series were analyzed using the\nsingular spectrum analysis (SSA) method to study the millennial-scale trends. A\nnew reconstruction of the geomagnetic dipole field moment, GMAG.9k, is built\nfor the last nine millennia. New reconstructions of solar activity covering the\nlast nine millennia, quantified in sunspot numbers, are presented and analyzed.\nA conservative list of grand minima and maxima is provided. The primary\ncomponents of the reconstructed solar activity, as determined using the SSA\nmethod, are different for the series based on 14C and 10Be. These primary\ncomponents can only be ascribed to long-term changes in the terrestrial system\nand not to the Sun. They have been removed from the reconstructed series. In\ncontrast, the secondary SSA components of the reconstructed solar activity are\nfound to be dominated by a common ~2400-yr quasi-periodicity, the so-called\nHallstatt cycle, in both the 14C and 10Be based series. This Hallstatt cycle\nthus appears to be related to solar activity. Finally, we show that the grand\nminima and maxima occurred intermittently over the studied period, with\nclustering near highs and lows of the Hallstatt cycle, respectively.\n","Comment: In press in Astronomy & Astrophysics, doi:\n  10.1051/0004-6361/201527295"]}]

As before, the see-saw mechanism can be realized in several models\nof different types depending on different ways of neutrino mass generation\ncorresponding to the introduction of new fields with different symmetry\nstructures. In the present paper, a general desription of all these see-saw\ntypes is made with a more detailed investigation on type-I models. As within\nthe original see-saw mechanism, the symmetry structure of the standard model\nfields decides the number and the symmetry structure of the new fields. In a\nmodel considered here, the scalar sector consists of three\nstandard-model-Higgs-like iso-doublets ($SU_L(2)$-doublets) forming an $A_4$\ntriplet. The latter is a superposition of three mass-eigen states, one of which\ncould be identified with the recently discovered Higgs boson. A possible\nrelation to the still-deliberated 750 GeV diphoton resonance at the 13 TeV LHC\ncollisions is also discussed. In the lepton sector, the three left-handed\nlepton iso-doublets form an $A_4$-triplet, while the three right-handed charged\nleptons are either $A_4$-singlets $(1,1',1\")$ in one version of the model, or\ncomponents of an $A_4$-triplet in another version. To generate neutrino masses\nthrough the type-I see-saw mechanism it is natural to add four right-handed\nneutrino multiplets, including one $A_4$-triplet and three $A_4$-singlets\n$(1,1',1\")$. For an interpretation, the model is applied to deriving some\nphysics quantities which can be compared with the experimental data. More\nprecisely, the PMNS matrix obtained after fitting with the current experimental\ndata is checked by being used to calculating several quantities, such as\nneutrinoless double beta decay effective mass $|\\langle m_{ee}\\rangle|$, CP\nviolation phase $\\delta_{CP}$ and Jarlskog parameter $J_{CP}$, which can be\nverified experimentally.\n","Comment: LaTeX, 31 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables.

The\nmixing time is related to a geometric parameter called conductance which is a\nmeasure of edge-expansion. Bounds on conductance are typically obtained by a\ntechnique called \"canonical paths\" where the idea is to find a set of paths,\none between every source-destination pair, such that no edge is heavily\ncongested. However, the canonical paths approach cannot always show rapid\nmixing of a rapidly mixing chain. This drawback disappears if we allow the flow\nbetween a pair of states to be spread along multiple paths. We prove that for a\nlarge class of Markov chains canonical paths does capture rapid mixing.\nAllowing multiple paths to route the flow still does help a great deal in\nproofs, as illustrated by a result of Morris & Sinclair (FOCS'99) on the rapid\nmixing of a Markov chain for sampling 0/1 knapsack solutions.\n  A different approach to prove rapid mixing is \"Coupling\".

We\nextend the study of Shamir DWF action to include Bori\\c{c}i and M\\\"{o}bius DWF\nactions by analyzing the poles of 4D quark propagator. For each action\nconsidered, we find an unphysical mode when analyzing the pole structure of the\nfree DWF propagator for a finite extent of the $5^{\\text{th}}$ dimension $L_s$,\nand we show that this mode is responsible for the oscillatory behavior observed\nin hadron correlators. We have performed numerical checks on these results and\nhave found that the presence of oscillatory behavior is sensitive to the DWF\nparameters $a_5$, $b_5$, $c_5$ and DW height $M$. To minimize oscillations, our\nresults suggest that one should choose $M a_5<1$ for the Shamir and Bori\\c{c}i\nDWFs, and $M(b_5-c_5)<1$ for M\\\"{o}bius DWF when $M>1$.

Membrane resonators can achieve quality\nfactor ($Q$) - frequency ($f$) products exceeding $10^{13}$ Hz, enabling (in\nprinciple) quantum coherent operation at room temperature. String-like beam\nresonators possess conventionally 10 times smaller $Q\\cdot f$ products;\nhowever, on account of their much larger $Q$-to-mass ratio and reduced mode\ndensity, they remain a canonical choice for precision force, mass, and charge\nsensing, and have recently enabled Heisenberg-limited position measurements at\ncryogenic temperatures.

The techniques relate to two main loss\nmechanisms: internal loss, which dominates for large aspect ratios and\n$f\\lesssim100$ MHz, and radiation loss, which dominates for small aspect ratios\nand $f\\gtrsim100$ MHz. First we show that by embedding a nanobeam in a 1D\nphononic crystal, it is possible to localize its flexural motion and shield it\nagainst radiation loss. Using this method, we realize $f>100$ MHz modes with\n$Q\\sim 10^4$, consistent with internal loss and contrasting sharply with\nunshielded beams of similar dimensions. We then study the $Q\\cdot f$ products\nof high-order modes of mm-long nanobeams.
