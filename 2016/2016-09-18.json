More precisely, we show\nthat the numerical solution $u_h^l$, given by the difference scheme, converges\nto the $l^{th}$ component $u_l,$ when the mesh size $h$ tends to zero, provided\n$u_l\\in C^2(\\Omega),$ for every $l=1,2,\\dots,m.$ In particular, our proof\nprovides convergence of a difference scheme for the multi-phase obstacle\nproblem.\n","Comment: 13 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1603.03196"]}]
