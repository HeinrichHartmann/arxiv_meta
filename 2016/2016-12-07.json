It is shown that there is a threshold value\n$\\theta_0$ which characterizes the refuge ability of prey such that the\npositivity of prey population can be ensured if either the prey's birth rate\nsatisfies $\\theta\\geq\\theta_0$ (no matter how large the predator's growth rate\nis) or the predator's growth rate satisfies $\\mu\\le 0$, while a protection zone\n$\\Omega_0$ is necessary for such positive solutions if $\\theta<\\theta_0$ with\n$\\mu>0$ properly large. The more interesting finding is that there is another\nthreshold value $\\theta^*=\\theta^*(\\mu,\\Omega_0)<\\theta_0$, such that the\npositive solutions do exist for all $\\theta\\in(\\theta^*,\\theta_0)$. Letting\n$\\mu\\rightarrow\\infty$, we get the third threshold value\n$\\theta_1=\\theta_1(\\Omega_0)$ such that if $\\theta>\\theta_1(\\Omega_0)$, prey\nspecies could survive no matter how large the predator's growth rate is. In\naddition, we get the fourth threshold value $\\theta_*$ for negative $\\mu$ such\nthat the system admits positive steady states if and only if $\\theta>\\theta_*$.\n","Comment: 18 pages"]}]

Stable recovery\nguarantees in these settings have been established using a common tool adapted\nto each case: the notion of restricted isometry property (RIP).

One hundred\ntwenty-six methods from 56 research groups were evaluated for their ability to\npredict biological functions using the Gene Ontology and gene-disease\nassociations using the Human Phenotype Ontology on a set of 3,681 proteins from\n18 species.

The shadow was seen during the\nfirst 2.0 seconds after the impact (afterward it became obscured by the ejecta\ncloud). We have found that all brightness variations in the shadow are the\nresult of the surface inhomogeneities, indicating that during first 2.0 seconds\nthe ejecta cloud was homogeneous within the MRI spatial resolution. Our second\ntechnique is to study the obscuration of the nucleus limb by the ejecta. This\nstudy covers the period 0.76- 68.8 seconds after impact and is based on\ncomparison of the ejecta cloud brightness on the limb and just beyond the limb.\nAt this stage we do see inhomogeneities in the ejecta cloud that relate to the\nalbedo and optical thickness variations in the ejected dust. Specifically, we\nhave found two distinct bands of low optical thickness and one band of a high\noptical thickness. Based on crater formation ideas we estimate the depth of\nexcavation of the ejected material for the found inhomogeneities and, thus,\ndefine a potential layering structure for the comet nucleus, Our estimates\nsuggest that the low-optical thickness material was excavated from a depth of\n15-18 and 30-32 meters in the case the porous nucleus material and 37-46 and\n87-93 meters in the case of a non-porous nucleus material, and a layer of high\noptical thickness originated from the depth 9-11 m for porous material or 20-23\nm for non-porous material.

They are inspired, in part, by a\ndecoherent histories analysis of the two-time histories of Q although the\nprotocols are ultimately expressed in macrorealistic form independent of\nquantum theory. The first type involves an ancilla coupled to the system with\ntwo sequential CNOT gates, and the two-time histories of the system are\ndetermined in a single final time measurement of the ancilla. It is\nnon-invasive for special choices of initial system states and partially\ninvasive for more general choices. Modified Leggett-Garg type inequalities\nwhich accommodate the partial invasiveness are discussed. The quantum picture\nof the protocol shows that for certain choices of primary system initial state\nthe protocol is undetectable with respect to final system state measurements,\nalthough it is still invasive at intermediate times. This invasiveness can be\nreduced with different choices of ancilla states and the protocol is then\nsimilar in flavour to a weak measurement. The second type of protocol is based\non the fact that the behaviour of Q over a time interval can be determined from\nknowledge of the dynamics together with a measurement of certain initial (or\nfinal) data. Its quantum version corresponds to the known fact that when sets\nof histories are decoherent, their probabilities may be expressed in terms of a\nrecord projector, hence the two-time histories in which Q has the same or\ndifferent sign can be determined by a single projective measurement. The\nresulting protocol resembles the decay-type protocol proposed by Huelga and\ncollaborators (which is non-invasive but requires a stationarity assumption).\n","Comment: 33 pages.

They acquire less HI in simulations with a greater star\nformation efficiency, since the star formation and feedback necessary to\nbalance the infall rate is produced by smaller gas reservoirs.

Despite the\ncomplexity of the processes involved, a traditional model, where the removal of\nangular momentum loss by magnetic fields is prescribed, has provided a useful\nframework to understand observational relations between stellar rotation and\nage and magnetic field strength. Here, a spindown model is proposed where loss\nof angular momentum by magnetic fields is evolved dynamically, instead of being\nkinematically prescribed. To this end, we evolve the stellar rotation and\nmagnetic field simultaneously over stellar evolution time by extending our\nprevious work on a dynamo model which incorporates the nonlinear feedback\nmechanisms on rotation and magnetic fields. Our extended model reproduces key\nobservations and explains the presence of the two branches of (fast and slow\nrotating) stars which have different relations between rotation rate $\\Omega$\nvs. time (age), magnetic field strength $|B|$ vs. rotation rate, and frequency\nof magnetic field $\\omega_{cyc}$ vs. rotation rate.

We show that the expected rate of joint detection is\nlow during the Advanced Virgo and Advanced LIGO 2016-2017 run; however, as the\ninterferometers approach their final design sensitivities, the rate will\nincrease by $\\sim$ a factor of ten. Future joint observations will help to\nconstrain the association between short GRBs and binary systems and to solve\nthe puzzle of the progenitors of GWs. Comparison of the joint detection rate\nwith the ones predicted in this paper will help to constrain the geometry of\nthe GRB jet.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 4 figures"]}]

These events with visual peak\nmagnitudes $\\lesssim-21$ are called superluminous SNe (SLSNe). Aims: There are\na few intermediate events which have luminosities between these two classes.\nHere we study one such object, SN 2012aa. Methods: The optical photometric and\nspectroscopic follow-up observations of the event were conducted over a time\nspan of about 120 days. Results: With V_abs at peak ~-20 mag, the SN is an\nintermediate-luminosity transient between regular SNe Ibc and SLSNe. It also\nexhibits an unusual secondary bump after the maximum in its light curve. We\ninterpret this as a manifestation of SN-shock interaction with the CSM. If we\nwould assume a $^{56}$Ni-powered ejecta, the bolometric light curve requires\nroughly 1.3 M_sun of $^{56}$Ni and an ejected mass of ~14 M_sun. This would\nalso imply a high kinetic energy of the explosion, ~5.4$\\times10^{51}$ ergs. On\nthe other hand, the unusually broad light curve along with the secondary peak\nindicate the possibility of interaction with CSM. The third alternative is the\npresence of a central engine releasing spin energy that eventually powers the\nlight curve over a long time. The host of the SN is a star-forming Sa/Sb/Sbc\ngalaxy. Conclusions: Although the spectral properties and velocity evolution of\nSN 2012aa are comparable to those of normal SNe Ibc, its broad light curve\nalong with a large peak luminosity distinguish it from canonical CCSNe,\nsuggesting the event to be an intermediate-luminosity transient between CCSNe\nand SLSNe at least in terms of peak luminosity. We argue that SN 2012aa belongs\nto a subclass where CSM interaction plays a significant role in powering the\nSN, at least during the initial stages of evolution.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy &\n  Astrophysics"]}]

Within this\napproximation the entropy production rate is shown to have a discontinuity when\nthe transition is first-order and to be continuous, with a jump in its first\nderivative, if the transition is second-order. In two dimensions, we find with\nnumerical simulations that the critical behavior of the entropy production rate\nis the same, independent of the frequency and amplitude of the field.

For acoustic waves in a fluid with fluctuations of both density and\ncompressibility (as well as for electromagnetic waves in a medium with\nfluctuation of both permittivity and permeability) the random potential entails\na scalar and an operator contribution. For simplicity, the latter is usually\noverlooked in multiple scattering theory: whatever the type of waves, this\nsimplification amounts to considering the Helmholtz equation with a sound speed\n$c$ depending on position $\\mathbf{r}$. In this work, a radiative transfer\nequation is derived from the wave equation, in order to study energy transport\nthrough a multiple scattering medium. In particular, the influence of the\noperator term on various transport parameters is studied, based on the\ndiagrammatic approach of multiple scattering.

We study the application of deep networks to this task, attempting\nclassification at several levels of data, starting from a raw list of tracks.\nWe find that the highest-level lowest-dimensionality expert information\nsacrifices information needed for classification, that the performance of\ncurrent state-of-the-art taggers can be matched or slightly exceeded by\ndeep-network-based taggers using only track and vertex information, that\nclassification using only lowest-level highest-dimensionality tracking\ninformation remains a difficult task for deep networks, and that adding\nlower-level track and vertex information to the classifiers provides a\nsignificant boost in performance compared to the state-of-the-art.\n","Comment: 12 pages, submitted to PRD"]}]

Agreement between disk rotation and jet rotation\ndetermined from optical lines has been verified in two cases and rejected in\none case. Meanwhile, the NUV lines, which may trace faster and more collimated\ninner spines of the jet than optical lines, either agree or show no clear\nindication. We propose to perform this test on the fourth system, Th 28. We\npresent ALMA high angular resolution Band 7 continuum, 12CO(3-2) and 13CO(2-1)\nobservations of the circumstellar disk around the T Tauri star Th 28. We were\nable to detect, in CO and continuum, clear signatures of a disk in Keplerian\nrotation around Th28. The 12CO emission is resolved, allowing us to derive\nestimates of disk position angle and inclination. The large velocity separation\nof the peaks in 12CO, combined with the resolved extent of the emission,\nindicate a central stellar mass in the range 1-2 Msun. The rotation sense of\nthe disk is well detected in both 13CO and 12CO emission lines, and this\ndirection is opposite to that implied by the transverse Doppler shifts measured\nin the optical lines of the jet. The Th 28 system is the second system where\ncounter-rotation between the disk and the optical jet is detected. These\nfindings imply either that optical transverse velocity gradients detected with\nHST do not trace jet rotation or that modeling the flow with the steady\nassumption is not valid. In both cases jet rotation studies that rely solely on\noptical lines are not suitable to derive the launching radius of the jet.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 4 figues, accepted by A&A"]}]

However, the situation is less understood in\ninteracting theories, especially on time scales longer than the dynamical\nrelaxation time. Recently there have been claims that the quantum theory\ndeviates spectacularly from the classical theory on this time scale, even if\nthe occupancy numbers are extremely large. Furthermore, it is claimed that the\nquantum theory quickly thermalizes while the classical theory does not. The\nevidence for these claims comes from noticing a spectacular difference in the\ntime evolution of expectation values of quantum operators compared to the\nclassical micro-state evolution.

These EBs were\nselected because they have highly precise stellar radii, effective\ntemperatures, and in many cases metallicities previously determined in the\nliterature, and thus have bolometric luminosities that are typically good to\n$\\lesssim$ 10%. In most cases the available broadband photometry spans a\nwavelength range 0.4-10 $\\mu$m, and in many cases spans 0.15-22 $\\mu$m. The\nresulting SED fits, which have only extinction as a free parameter, provide a\nvirtually model-independent measure of the bolometric flux at Earth. The SED\nfits are satisfactory for 156 of the EBs, for which we achieve typical\nprecisions in the bolometric flux of $\\approx$ 3%. Combined with the accurately\nknown bolometric luminosity, the result for each EB is a predicted parallax\nthat is typically precise to $\\lesssim$ 5%. These predicted parallaxes---with\ntypical uncertainties of 200 $\\mu$as---are 4-5 times more precise than those\ndetermined by Hipparcos for 99 of the EBs in our sample, with which we find\nexcellent agreement. There is no evidence among this sample for significant\nsystematics in the Hipparcos parallaxes of the sort that notoriously afflicted\nthe Pleiades measurement. The EBs are distributed over the entire sky, span\nmore than 10 mag in brightness, reach distances of more than 5 kpc, and in many\ncases our predicted parallaxes should also be more precise than those expected\nfrom the Gaia first data release. The EBs studied here can thus serve as\nempirical, independent benchmarks for these upcoming fundamental parallax\nmeasurements.\n","Comment: 63 pages, 2 tables, 39 figures.

Looking at the\nbroader sample of well-characterized close-in transiting giant planets, we find\nthat there is a statistically significant correlation between planetary radii\nand the fractional ages of their host stars, with a false alarm probability of\nonly 0.0041%. We find that the correlation between the radii of planets and the\nfractional ages of their hosts is fully explained by the known correlation\nbetween planetary radii and their present day equilibrium temperatures, however\nif the zero-age main sequence equilibrium temperature is used in place of the\npresent day equilibrium temperature then a correlation with age must also be\nincluded to explain the planetary radii. This suggests that, after contracting\nduring the pre-main-sequence, close-in giant planets are re-inflated over time\ndue to the increasing level of irradiation received from their host stars.\nPrior theoretical work indicates that such a dynamic response to irradiation\nrequires a significant fraction of the incident energy to be deposited deep\nwithin the planetary interiors.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in AJ, 32 pages, 19 figures, 8 tables"]}]

We here explore the energy spectra and angular\nemission of the photoelectrons in such two-color fields as a function of the\nsize and location of the target (atoms) with regard to the beam axis. In\naddition, analogue to the circular dichroism in typical two-color ATI\nexperiments with circularly polarized light, we define and discuss seven\ndifferent dichroism signals for such vortex Bessel beams that arise from the\nvarious combinations of the orbital and spin angular momenta of the two light\nfields. For localized targets, it is found that these dichroism signals\nstrongly depend on the size and position of the atoms relative to the beam. For\nmacroscopically extended targets, in contrast, three of these dichroism signals\ntend to zero, while the other four just coincide with the (standard) circular\ndichroism, similar as for Bessel beams with small opening angle.

Assessing the impact of these\neffects depends crucially on the orbital histories of the LMC and M33. Here, we\nrevisit the dynamics of the MW-LMC system and present the first detailed\nanalysis of the M31-M33 system utilizing high precision proper motions and\nstatistics from the dark matter-only Illustris cosmological simulation. With\nthe latest Hubble Space Telescope proper motion measurements of M31, we\nreliably constrain M33's interaction history with its host. In particular, like\nthe LMC, M33 is either on its first passage (t_{inf} < 2 Gyr ago) or if M31 is\nmassive (>=2x10^12 Msun), it is on a long period orbit of about 6 Gyr.\nCosmological analogs of the LMC and M33 identified in Illustris support this\npicture and provide further insight about their host masses. We conclude that,\ncosmologically, massive satellites like the LMC and M33 are likely completing\ntheir first orbits about their hosts.

This conclusion cannot be explained by\nperturbative effects through four body encounters between the MW, M31, M33, and\nthe LMC.

Their radiative properties\nfollow some general scaling laws which primarily depend on their masses and\naccretion rates. However, it has been suggested that the black hole spin can\nalso strongly influence the power and radio flux of these. Here, we attempt to\nestimate the dependency of the radio luminosity of steady jets launched by\naccretion disks on black hole mass, accretion rate and spin using numerical\nsimulations. We make use of 3D GRMHD simulations of accretion disks around\nlow-luminosity black holes in which the jet radio emission is produced by the\njet sheath. We find that the radio flux increases roughly by a factor of 6 as\nthe back hole spin increases from a~0 to a=0.98. This is comparable to the\nincrease in accretion power with spin, meaning that the ratio between radio jet\nand accretion power is hardly changing. Although our jet spine power scales as\nexpected for the Blandford-Znajek process, the dependency of jet radio\nluminosity on the black hole spin is somewhat weaker. Also weakly rotating\nblack holes can produce visible radio jets. The overall scaling of the radio\nemission with black hole mass and accretion rate is consistent with the\nscale-invariant analytical models used to explain the fundamental plane of\nblack hole activity. Spin does not introduce a significant scatter in this\nmodel. The jet-sheath model can describe well resolved accreting systems, such\nas SgrA* and M87, as well as the general scaling behavior of low-luminosity\nblack holes. Hence the model should be applicable to a wide range of radio jets\nin sub-Eddington black holes. The black hole spin has an effect on the\nproduction of visible radio jet, but it may not be the main driver to produce\nvisible radio jets.

Inverting the RTE is therefore\nmandatory. Indeed, the formal solution of this equation can be considered an\nintegral equation. The solution of such an integral equation is called the\ninverse problem. Inversion techniques are automated codes aimed at solving the\ninverse problem.\n  The foundations of inversion techniques are critically revisited with an\nemphasis on making explicit the many assumptions underlying each of them. An\nincremental complexity procedure is advised for the implementation in practice.\nCoarse details of the profiles or coarsely sam- pled profiles should be\nreproduced first with simple model atmospheres (with, for example, a few\nphysical quantities that are constant with optical depth). If the Stokes\nprofiles are well sampled and differences between synthetic and observed ones\nare greater than the noise, then the inversion should proceed by using more\ncomplex models (that is, models where physical quantities vary with depth or,\neventually, with more than one component). Significant im- provements are\nexpected as well from the use of new inversion techniques that take the spatial\ndegradation by the instruments into account.\n","Comment: Invited review accepted for publication in Living Reviews in Solar\n  Physics. 84 pages, 30 figures"]}]

We do the same for other signatures\nincluding one or both of disjoint union and subset complement, another partial\nbinary operation we define.\n  Domain-disjoint union is a partial binary operation on partial functions,\nreturning the union if the arguments have disjoint domains and undefined\notherwise. For each signature including one or both of domain-disjoint union\nand subset complement and optionally including composition, we consider the\nclass of partial algebras isomorphic to a collection of partial functions\nclosed under the operations. Again the classes prove to be axiomatisable, but\nnot finitely axiomatisable, in first-order logic.\n  We define the notion of pairwise combinability. For each of the previously\nconsidered signatures, we examine the class isomorphic to a partial algebra of\nsets/partial functions under an isomorphism mapping arbitrary suprema of\npairwise combinable sets to the corresponding disjoint unions. We prove that\nfor each case the class is not closed under elementary equivalence.\n  However, when intersection is added to any of the signatures considered, the\nisomorphism class of the partial algebras of sets is finitely axiomatisable and\nin each case we give such an axiomatisation.\n","Comment: 30 pages"]}]

Open-ended evolution (OEE) refers to\nthe unbounded increase in complexity that seems to characterise evolution on\nmultiple scales. This property seems to be a characteristic feature of\nbiological and technological evolution and is strongly tied to the generative\npotential associated with combinatorics, which allows the system to grow and\nexpand their available state spaces. Several theoretical and computational\napproaches have been developed to properly characterise OEE.

The\nmain contribution of this paper is to prove that if and only if the Gaussian\nrelay network satisfies a non-manipulable channel condition, the proposed\ndetection scheme can detect arbitrary attacks that allows the stochastic\ndistributions of altered symbols to vary arbitrarily and depend on each other.\nNo pre-shared secret or secret transmission is needed for the detection.\nFurthermore, we also prove that for the considered Gaussian two-way relay\nnetworks, the non-manipulable channel condition is always satisfied.

Fixing the radiative damping and\nmomentum drag timescales to be of the order of a few days, a state of SR is\nshown to emerge under steady large-scale and random small-scale vorticity\nforcing. In the first example, the stationary response to a pair of equal and\noppositely signed vortices placed on the equator is considered. Here, the\nequatorial flux budget is dominated by the eddy fluxes and these drive the\nsystem into a state of SR. Eventually, the flux associated with the momentum\ndrag increases to balance the eddy fluxes, resulting in a steady state with a\nSR jet at the equator. The initial value problem with these twin vortices also\nexhibits SR driven by eddy fluxes. Curiously, this transient solution\nspontaneously propagates westward and continually circumnavigates the globe. It\nis worth emphasizing that this SR state does not rely on any particular form of\ndissipation at large scales, and is in fact observed even in the absence of any\nlarge-scale damping mechanism. In the second example, a random small-scale\nvorticity forcing is applied across the tropics. The statistically steady state\nobtained is fairly turbulent in nature, but here too, the eddy fluxes dominate,\nand the system exhibits SR. It is important to note that in both these cases,\nthe direct forcing of the zonal mean zonal flow is zero by construction, and\nthe eddy fluxes at the equator are responsible for its eastward acceleration.\nFurther, in both these examples, the rotational part of the flow dominates the\nmomentum fluxes as well as the stationary zonal mean zonal flow itself.\nArguments based on the nature of potential vorticity and enstrophy are put\nforth to shed some light on these results.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 13 figures.

First, it shows that simple heuristics\ndrawn from geolocated Twitter data offer a good proxy for local commuting\npatterns; one which outperforms the major existing method for estimating these\npatterns (the radiation model). Second, it investigates sources of error in the\nproxy measure, showing that the model performs better on short trips with\nhigher volumes of commuters; it also looks at demographic biases but finds\nthat, surprisingly, measurements are not significantly affected by the fact\nthat the demographic makeup of Twitter users differs significantly from the\npopulation as a whole. Finally, it looks at potential ways of going beyond\nsimple heuristics by incorporating temporal information into models.\n"]}]

The analysis considers the\nsystem matrix to be chosen from a large class of random ensembles. We take a\nstatistical mechanical approach by introducing a spin glass corresponding to\nthe estimator, and employing the replica method for the large-system analysis.\nIn contrast to earlier replica based studies, our analysis evaluates the\ngeneral replica ansatz of the corresponding spin glass and determines the\nasymptotic distortion of the estimator for any structure of the replica\ncorrelation matrix. Consequently, the replica symmetric as well as the replica\nsymmetry breaking ansatz with $b$ steps of breaking is deduced from the given\ngeneral replica ansatz. The generality of our distortion function lets us\nderive a more general form of the maximum-a-posterior decoupling principle.\nBased on the general replica ansatz, we show that for any structure of the\nreplica correlation matrix, the vector-valued system decouples into a bank of\nequivalent decoupled linear systems followed by maximum-a-posterior estimators.\nThe structure of the decoupled linear system is further studied under both the\nreplica symmetry and the replica symmetry breaking assumptions. For $b$ steps\nof symmetry breaking, the decoupled system is found to be an additive system\nwith a noise term given as the sum of an independent Gaussian random variable\nwith $b$ correlated impairment terms. The general decoupling property of the\nmaximum-a-posterior estimator leads to the idea of a replica simulator which\nrepresents the replica ansatz through the state evolution of a transition\nsystem described by its corresponding decoupled system.
