In particular, we show that by using delta-discrete K/H-spectra,\nthere is always an iterated homotopy fixed point spectrum, denoted\n(X^{hH})^{h_\\delta K/H}, and it is just X^{hK}. Additionally, we show that for\nany delta-discrete G-spectrum Y, (Y^{h_\\delta H})^{h_\\delta K/H} \\simeq\nY^{h_\\delta K}. Furthermore, if G is an arbitrary profinite group, there is a\ndelta-discrete G-spectrum {X_\\delta} that is equivalent to X and, though X^{hH}\nis not even known in general to have a K/H-action, there is always an\nequivalence ((X_\\delta)^{h_\\delta H})^{h_\\delta K/H} \\simeq\n(X_\\delta)^{h_\\delta K}. Therefore, delta-discrete L-spectra, by letting L\nequal H, K, and K/H, give a way of resolving undesired deficiencies in our\nunderstanding of homotopy fixed points for discrete G-spectra.\n","Comment: 25 pages"]}]

According to this principle\none might believe that the most biased prime number race we will ever find is\nthe Li$(x)$ versus $\\pi(x)$ race, since the Riemann zeta function is the\n$L$-function of rank one having the highest first zero. This race has density\n0.99999973..., and we study the question of whether this is the highest\npossible density. We will show that it is not the case, in fact there exists\nprime number races whose density can be arbitrarily close to 1. An example of\nrace whose density exceeds the above number is the race between quadratic\nresidues and non-residues modulo 4849845, for which the density is\n0.999999928... We also give fairly general criteria to decide whether a prime\nnumber race is highly biased or not. Our main result depends on the General\nRiemann Hypothesis and on a hypothesis on the multiplicity of the zeros of a\ncertain Dedekind zeta function. We also derive more precise results under a\nlinear independence hypothesis.\n","Comment: 28 pages"]}]

Using the fact that $G$ admits a\nsuitable automatic structure, $G_x(t)$ can be shown to be a rational function.\nWe prove that if $Y$ is a manifold of dimension $n$, then this rational\nfunction satisfies the reciprocity formula $G_x(t^{-1})=(-1)^n G_x(t)$. We\nprove the formula in a more general setting, replacing the group with the\nfundamental groupoid, replacing the growth series with the characteristic\nseries for a suitable regular language, and only assuming $Y$ is Eulerian.\n","Comment: Minor corrections.

In the absence of disorder such\npairing can support both line and point nodes, and both types of nodal\nquasiparticles exhibit nontrivial topology in the momentum space. The point\nnodes, located at the intersections of the closed Fermi surfaces with the\n$c$-axis, act as the double monopoles and the antimonopoles of the Berry\ncurvature, and generalize the notion of Weyl quasiparticles. Consequently, the\n$B$ phase should support an anomalous thermal Hall effect, the polar Kerr\neffect, in addition to the protected Fermi arcs on the (1,0,0) and the (0,1,0)\nsurfaces. The line node at the Fermi surface equator acts as a vortex loop in\nthe momentum space and gives rise to the zero energy, dispersionless Andreev\nbound states on the (0,0,1) surface. At the transition from the $B$-phase to\nthe $A$-phase, the time reversal symmetry is restored, and only the line node\nsurvives inside the $A$-phase. As both line and double-Weyl point nodes possess\nlinearly vanishing density of states, we show that weak disorder acts as a\nmarginally relevant perturbation. Consequently, an infinitesimal amount of\ndisorder destroys the ballistic quasiparticle pole, while giving rise to a\ndiffusive phase with a finite density of states at the zero energy. The\nresulting diffusive phase exhibits $T$-linear specific heat, and an anomalous\nthermal Hall effect.

To\naddress this issue, endmember variability estimation consists of estimating the\nreference spectral signatures from which the estimated endmembers have been\nderived as well as their variability with respect to these references. This\npaper introduces a new linear mixing model that explicitly accounts for spatial\nand spectral endmember variabilities. The parameters of this model can be\nestimated using an optimization algorithm based on the alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers. The performance of the proposed unmixing method is\nevaluated on synthetic and real data. A comparison with state-of-the-art\nalgorithms designed to model and estimate endmember variability allows the\ninterest of the proposed unmixing solution to be appreciated.\n","Comment: to appear, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 2015"]}]

Starting from basic mechanics principles, we calculate the work that\nthe diver must provide through propulsion to counterbalance the action of drag,\nthe buoyant force and weight during immersion. Compared to those in previous\nstudies, the model presented here accurately analyses breath-hold divers which\nalternate active swimming with prolonged glides during the dive (as is the case\nin mammals). The energy cost of the dive is strongly dependent on these\nprolonged gliding phases. Here we investigate the length and impacts on energy\ncost of these glides with respect to the diver characteristics, and compare\nthem with those observed in different breath-hold diving species. Taking into\naccount the basal metabolic rate and chemical energy to propulsion\ntransformation efficiency, we calculate optimal swim velocity and the\ncorresponding total energy cost (including metabolic rate) and compare them\nwith observations. Energy cost is minimised when the diver passes through\nneutral buoyancy conditions during the dive. This generally implies the\npresence of prolonged gliding phases in both ascent and descent, where the\nbuoyancy (varying with depth) is best used against the drag, reducing energy\ncost. This is in agreement with past results (Miller et al., 2012; Sato et al.,\n2013) where, when the buoyant force is considered constant during the dive, the\nenergy cost was minimised for neutral buoyancy. In particular, our model\nconfirms the good physical adaption of dolphins for diving, compared to other\nbreath-hold diving species which are mostly positively buoyant (penguins for\nexample). The presence of prolonged glides implies a non-trivial dependency of\noptimal speed on maximal depth of the dive. This extends previous findings\n(Sato et al., 2010; Watanabe et al., 2011) which found no dependency of optimal\nspeed on dive depth for particular conditions. The energy cost of the dive can\nbe further diminished by reducing the volume of gas-filled body parts in divers\nclose to neutral buoyancy. This provides a possible additional explanation for\nthe observed exhalation of air before diving in phocid seals to minimise dive\nenergy cost. Until now the only explanation for this phenomenon has been a\nreduction in the risk of decompression sickness.\n"]}]

The computed\nmessage combinations at relays are correlated, and so directly forwarding these\ncombinations to a destination generally incurs information redundancy and\nspectrum inefficiency. To address this issue, we propose a novel relay\nstrategy, termed compute-compress-and-forward (CCF). In CCF, source messages\nare encoded using nested lattice codes constructed on a chain of nested coding\nand shaping lattices. A key difference of CCF from CF is an extra compressing\nstage inserted in between the computing and forwarding stages of a relay, so as\nto reduce the forwarding information rate of the relay. The compressing stage\nat each relay consists of two operations: first to quantize the computed\nmessage combination on an appropriately chosen lattice (referred to as a\nquantization lattice), and then to take modulo on another lattice (referred to\nas a modulo lattice). We study the design of the quantization and modulo\nlattices and propose successive recovering algorithms to ensure the\nrecoverability of source messages at destination. Based on that, we formulate a\nsum-rate maximization problem that is in general an NP-hard mixed integer\nprogram.

The precise\ndetermination of the depth of solar convection zone, departures from\nadiabaticity of the temperature gradient, and the internal rotation rate as a\nfunction of latitude and depth are among the seminal contributions of\nhelioseismology towards understanding convection in the Sun. Contemporary\nhelioseismology, which is focused on inferring the properties of\nthree-dimensional convective features, suggests that transport velocities are\nsubstantially smaller than theoretical predictions. Furthermore,\nhelioseismology provides important constraints on the anisotropic Reynolds\nstresses that control the global dynamics of the solar convection zone. This\nreview discusses the state of our understanding of convection in the Sun, with\na focus on helioseismic diagnostics. We present our considerations with the\ninterests of fluid dynamicists in mind.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 12 figures, in review, Annual Reviews of Fluid Mechanics"]}]

The devices further show evidence of inelastic phonon-assisted\ntunneling processes involving both Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and graphene phonons.

Finally, the utility of these tunnel\njunctions is demonstrated on a density-tunable BLG device, where the\ncharge-neutrality point is traced along the energy-density trajectory.

We also discuss the impact when the noise properties are not known\ncompletely. As a first step toward solving the 21 cm power spectrum analysis\nproblem we compare the semi-blind HIEMICA technique with the commonly used\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA). Under the same idealized circumstances the\nproposed technique provides significantly improved recovery of the power\nspectrum.

Stochastic theories that treat semi-Markov age-dependent\nprocesses using e.g., the Bellman-Harris equation, do not resolve a\npopulation's age-structure and are unable to quantify population-size\ndependencies. Conversely, current theories that include size-dependent\npopulation dynamics (e.g., mathematical models that include carrying capacity\nsuch as the Logistic equation) cannot be easily extended to take into account\nage-dependent birth and death rates. In this paper, we present a systematic\nderivation of a new fully stochastic kinetic theory for interacting\nage-structured populations. By defining multiparticle probability density\nfunctions, we derive a hierarchy of kinetic equations for the stochastic\nevolution of an ageing population undergoing birth and death. We show that the\nfully stochastic age-dependent birth-death process precludes factorization of\nthe corresponding probability densities, which then must be solved by using a\nBBGKY-like hierarchy. However, explicit solutions are derived in two simple\nlimits and compared with their corresponding mean-field results.

In particular, unlike in\ngraphene, the band structure at the two valleys are independently affected by\nthe spin in the ferromagnetic regions and lead to non-zero, and in certain\nparameter regimes, pure valley and spin polarizations, which can be tuned by\nthe external electric field. We also investigate the oscillatory behavior of\nthe TMR with respect to the strength of the barrier potential (both\nspin-independent and spin-dependent barriers) in the normal silicene region and\nnote that in some parameter regimes, the TMR can even go from positive to\nnegative values, as a function of the external electric field.\n","Comment: This is the published version"]}]

When the\nelectromagnetic and matter fields are treated as operators, quantum\nfluctuations enter the relevant correlation functions and a finite linewidth is\nobtained, via a generalization of SALT to include noise (N-SALT).

Given a temporal network (a sequence\nof contacts), greedy walks proceed from node to node by always following the\nfirst available contact. Because of this, their structure is particularly\nsensitive to temporal-topological patterns involving repeated contacts between\nsets of nodes. This becomes evident in their small coverage per step as\ncompared to a temporal reference model -- in empirical temporal networks,\ngreedy walks often get stuck within small sets of nodes because of correlated\ncontact patterns.

Here we develop a theoretical framework for attacks on\ninterdependent modular networks and support our results by simulations.

This is very realistic for infrastructure across cities. Each city\nhas its own infrastructures and different infrastructures are dependent within\nthe city. However, each infrastructure is connected within and between cities.\nFor example, a power grid will connect many cities as will a communication\nnetwork, yet a power station and communication tower that are interdependent\nwill likely be in the same city. It has been shown that single networks are\nvery susceptible to the failure of the interconnected nodes (between\ncommunities) Shai et al. and that attacks on these nodes are more crippling\nthan attacks based on betweenness da Cunha et al. In our example of cities\nthese nodes have long range links which are more likely to fail. For both\ntreelike and looplike interdependent modular networks we find distinct regimes\ndepending on the number of modules, $m$. (i) In the case where there are fewer\nmodules with strong intraconnections, the system first separates into modules\nin an abrupt first-order transition and then each module undergoes a second\npercolation transition.

However, the relevance of DM annihilations in halos for\ncosmological observables is still subject to debate, with previous works\nreaching different conclusions on this point. Also, all previous studies used a\nsingle type of parameterization for the astrophysical reionization, and\nincluded no astrophysical source for the heating of the intergalactic medium.\nIn this work, we revisit these problems. When standard approaches are adopted,\nwe find that the ionization fraction does exhibit a very particular (and\npotentially constraining) pattern, but the currently measurable optical depth\nto reionization is left almost unchanged: In agreement with the most of the\nprevious literature, for plausible halo models we find that the modification of\nthe signal with respect to the one coming from annihilations in the smooth\nbackground is tiny, below cosmic variance within currently allowed parameter\nspace. However, if different and probably more realistic treatments of the\nastrophysical sources of reionization and heating are adopted, a more\npronounced effect of the DM annihilation in halos is possible. We thus conclude\nthat within currently adopted baseline models the impact of the virialised DM\nstructures cannot be uncovered by CMB power spectra measurements, but a larger\nimpact is possible if peculiar models are invoked for the redshift evolution of\nthe DM annihilation signal or different assumptions are made for the\nastrophysical contributions.

We discuss discriminative features of these models. First, using the\nexperimental value of the mass of the discovered Higgs boson $h(125)$, we\nobtain an upper bound on the mass of the lightest additional scalar boson (~543\nGeV), which does not depend on its isospin and hypercharge. Second, a\ndiscriminative prediction on the Higgs-photon-photon coupling is given as a\nfunction of the number of charged scalar bosons, by which we can narrow down\npossible models using current and future data for the di-photon decay of\n$h(125)$. Finally, for the triple Higgs boson coupling a large deviation (~ +70\n%) from the SM prediction is universally predicted, which is independent of\nmasses, quantum numbers and even the number of additional scalars.

However, there exists a non-eruptive filament in\nthe plage region just next to an eruptive one in the AR, which gives us an\nopportunity to perform a comparison analysis of these two filaments. The\ncoronal magnetic field extrapolated using a CESE-MHD-NLFFF code (Jiang & Feng\n2013) reveals that two magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) exist in the same\nextrapolation box supporting these two filaments, respectively. Analysis of the\nmagnetic field shows that the eruptive MFR contains a bald-patch separatrix\nsurface (BPSS) co-spatial very well with a pre-eruptive EUV sigmoid, which is\nconsistent with the BPSS model for coronal sigmoids. The magnetic dips of the\nnon-eruptive MFRs match H{\\alpha} observation of the non-eruptive filament\nstrikingly well, which strongly supports the MFR-dip model for filaments.\nCompared with the non-eruptive MFR/filament (with a length of about 200 Mm),\nthe eruptive MFR/filament is much smaller (with a length of about 20 Mm), but\nit contains most of the magnetic free energy in the extrapolation box and holds\na much higher free energy density than the non-eruptive one. Both the MFRs are\nweakly twisted and cannot trigger kink instability. The AR eruptive MFR is\nunstable because its axis reaches above a critical height for torus\ninstability, at which the overlying closed arcades can no longer confine the\nMFR stably. On the contrary, the quiescent MFR is very firmly held by its\noverlying field, as its axis apex is far below the torus-instability threshold\nheight.

In this setting,\nclosed-form bit error rate (BER) expressions for HP data and LP data are\nderived in Nakagami-$m$ fading channels in the presence of sensing errors.\nSubsequently, the optimal power control that minimizes weighted sum of average\nBERs of HP bits and LP bits or its upper bound subject to peak/average transmit\npower and average interference power constraints is derived and a\nlow-complexity power control algorithm is proposed. Power levels are determined\nin three different scenarios, depending on the availability of perfect channel\nside information (CSI) of the transmission and interference links, statistical\nCSI of both links, or perfect CSI of the transmission link and imperfect CSI of\nthe interference link.

For some sources, they\nfollow the `original' type of correlation which is described by a single\npower-law. Later it was found that some other sources follow a different\ncorrelation consisting of three power-law branches, with each branch having\ndifferent power-law indexes. In this work, we explain these two types of\ncorrelation under the coupled accretion--jet model. We attribute the difference\nbetween these two types of sources to the different value of viscosity\nparameter $\\alpha$. One possible reason for different $\\alpha$ is the different\nconfiguration of magnetic field in the accretion material coming from the\ncompanion stars. For the `single power-law' sources, their $\\alpha$ is high; so\ntheir accretion is always in the mode of advection-dominated accretion flow\n(ADAF) for the whole range of X-ray luminosity.

The gauge-fixing\nprocedure we follow allows us to reduce the 25 different terms of the NLO\nspin-spin Hamiltonian in Arnowitt-Deser-Misner coordinates to only 9 EOB terms.\nThis is an improvement with respect to the EOB model recently proposed in\n[Physical Review D 91, 064011 (2015)], where 12 EOB terms were involved.\nAnother important advantage is the remarkably simple momentum structure of the\nspin-spin terms in the effective Hamiltonian, which is simply quadratic up to\nan overall square root. Moreover, a Damour-Jaranowski-Sch\\\"afer-type gauge\ncould be established, thus allowing one to concentrate, in the case of circular\nand equatorial orbits, the whole spin-spin interaction in a single radial\npotential.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 6 figures.

For the conditions\ntested, blade motion is governed primarily by two dimensionless variables: (i)\nthe Cauchy number, $Ca$, which represents the ratio of the hydrodynamic forcing\nto the restoring force due to blade stiffness, and (ii) the ratio of the blade\nlength to the wave orbital excursion, $L$. For flexible blades with $Ca \\gg 1$,\nthe relationship between drag and velocity can be described by two different\nscaling laws at the large- and small-excursion limits. For large excursions ($L\n\\ll 1$), the flow resembles a unidirectional current and the scaling laws\ndeveloped for steady-flow reconfiguration studies hold. For small excursions\n($L \\gg 1$), the beam equations may be linearized and a different scaling law\nfor drag applies. The experimental force measurements suggest that the\nsmall-excursion scaling applies even for intermediate cases with $L \\sim O(1)$.\nThe numerical model employs the well-known Morison force formulation, and\nadequately reproduces the observed blade dynamics and measured hydrodynamic\nforces without the use of any fitted parameters. For $Ca \\gg 1$, the movement\nof the flexible blades reduces the measured and modeled hydrodynamic drag\nrelative to a rigid blade of the same morphology. However, in some cases with\n$Ca \\sim O(1)$, the measured hydrodynamic forces generated by the flexible\nblades exceed those generated by rigid blades, but this is not reproduced in\nthe model. Observations of blade motion suggest that this unusual behavior is\nrelated to an unsteady vortex shedding event, which the simple numerical model\ncannot reproduce. Finally, we also discuss implications for the modeling of\nwave energy dissipation over canopies of natural aquatic vegetation.\n"]}]

Using new NIR interferometric\nobservations, we aim to characterize the 0.1-10~au region of the HD~139614 disk\nfurther and identify viable mechanisms for the inner disk clearing. We report\nthe first multiwavelength radiative transfer modeling of the interferometric\ndata acquired on HD~139614 with PIONIER, AMBER, and MIDI, complemented by\nHerschel/PACS photometries. We confirm a gap structure in the um-sized dust,\nextending from about 2.5 au to 6 au, and constrained the properties of the\ninner dust component: e.g., a radially increasing surface density profile, and\na depletion of 10^3 relative to the outer disk. Since self-shadowing and\nphotoevaporation appears unlikely to be responsible for the au-sized gap of\nHD~139614, we thus tested if dynamical clearing could be a viable mechanism\nusing hydrodynamical simulations to predict the gaseous disk structure. Indeed,\na narrow au-sized gap is expected when a single giant planet interacts with the\ndisk. Assuming that small dust grains are well coupled to the gas, we found\nthat a ~ 3~Mjup planet located at 4.5 au from the star could, in less than 1\nMyr, reproduce most of the aspects of the dust surface density profile, while\nno significant depletion in gas occurred in the inner disk, in contrast to the\ndust. However, the dust-depleted inner disk could be explained by the expected\ndust filtration by the gap and the efficient dust growth/fragmentation in the\ninner disk regions.

The inward motion of molecular\ngas in the massive star forming region G34.26+0.15 is investigated by using\nhigh-resolution profiles of seven transitions of ammonia at THz frequencies\nobserved with Herschel-HIFI. The shapes and intensities of these lines are\ninterpreted in terms of radiative transfer models of a spherical, collapsing\nmolecular envelope. An accelerated Lambda Iteration (ALI) method is used to\ncompute the models. The seven ammonia lines show mixed absorption and emission\nwith inverse P-Cygni-type profiles that suggest infall onto the central source.\nA trend toward absorption at increasingly higher velocities for higher\nexcitation transitions is clearly seen in the line profiles. The $J =\n3\\leftarrow2$ lines show only very weak emission, so these absorption profiles\ncan be used directly to analyze the inward motion of the gas. This is the first\ntime a multitransitional study of spectrally resolved rotational ammonia lines\nhas been used for this purpose. Broad emission is, in addition, mixed with the\nabsorption in the $1_0-0_0$ ortho-NH$_3$ line, possibly tracing a molecular\noutflow from the star forming region.

We present a multi-wavelength analysis of the evolved supernova\nremnants MCSNR J0506-7025 and MCSNR J0527-7104 in the Large Magellanic Cloud.\nMethods. We used data from XMM-Newton, the Australian Telescope Compact Array,\nand the Magellanic Cloud Emission Line Survey to study their broadband emission\nand used Spitzer and HI data to gain a picture of their environments. We\nperformed a multi-wavelength morphological study and detailed radio and X-ray\nspectral analyses to determine their physical characteristics. Results. Both\nremnants were found to have bright X-ray cores, dominated by Fe L-shell\nemission, consistent with reverse shock heated ejecta with determined Fe masses\nin agreement with Type Ia explosion yields. A soft X-ray shell, consistent with\nswept-up interstellar medium, was observed in MCSNR J0506-7025, suggestive of a\nremnant in the Sedov phase. Using the spectral fit results and the Sedov\nself-similar solution, we estimated the age of MCSNR J0506-7025 to be ~16-28\nkyr, with an initial explosion energy of (0.07-0.84)x10^51 erg. A soft shell\nwas absent in MCSNR J0527-7104, with only ejecta emission visible in an\nextremely elongated morphology extending beyond the optical shell. We suggest\nthat the blast wave has broken out into a low density cavity, allowing the\nshock heated ejecta to escape. We found that the radio spectral index of MCSNR\nJ0506-7025 is consistent with the standard ~0.5 for SNRs.

Planetesimal collisions are the main agent to\nregulate planetary accretion that corresponds to the formation of terrestrial\nplanets and cores of gas giants.

The aim of this work is the study of abundances of the heavy elements\nBa, La, Ce, Nd, and Eu in 56 bulge giants (red giant branch and red clump) with\nmetallicities ranging from -1.3 dex to 0.5 dex. Methods. We obtained\nhigh-resolution spectra of our giant stars using the FLAMES-UVES spectrograph\non the Very Large Telescope. We inspected four bulge fields along the minor\naxis. Results. We measure the chemical evolution of heavy elements, as a\nfunction of metallicity, in the Galactic bulge. Conclusions. The [Ba, La, Ce,\nNd/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] ratios decrease with increasing metallicity, in which aspect\nthey differ from disc stars. In our metal-poor bulge stars, La and Ba are\nenhanced relative to their thick disc counterpart, while in our metal-rich\nbulge stars La and Ba are underabundant relative to their disc counterpart.\nTherefore, this contrast between bulge and discs trends indicates that bulge\nand (solar neighbourhood) thick disc stars could behave differently. An\nincrease in [La, Nd/Eu] with increasing metallicity, for metal-rich stars with\n[Fe/H] > 0 dex, may indicate that the s-process from AGB stars starts to\noperate at a metallicity around solar.

A common workaround for this problem is to instead optimize a\nemph{surrogate loss} function, such as for instance cross-entropy or hinge\nloss. In order for this remedy to be effective, it is important to ensure that\nminimization of the surrogate loss results in minimization of the task loss, a\ncondition that we call emph{consistency with the task loss}. In this work, we\npropose another method for deriving differentiable surrogate losses that\nprovably meet this requirement. We focus on the broad class of models that\ndefine a score for every input-output pair. Our idea is that this score can be\ninterpreted as an estimate of the task loss, and that the estimation error may\nbe used as a consistent surrogate loss. A distinct feature of such an approach\nis that it defines the desirable value of the score for every input-output\npair. We use this property to design specialized surrogate losses for\nEncoder-Decoder models often used for sequence prediction tasks. In our\nexperiment, we benchmark on the task of speech recognition.

Similar spectral features are often\nobserved in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and other black-hole binaries (BHBs),\nand several models have been proposed for explaining it. In order to\ndistinguish spectral models, time variation provides an important key. In AGNs,\nvariation amplitude has been found to drop significantly at the iron K-energy\nband at timescales of ~10 ks. If spectral variations of black-holes are\nnormalized by their masses, the spectral variations of BHBs at timescales of\nsub-seconds should exhibit similar characteristics to those of AGNs. In this\npaper, we investigated spectral variations of GRS 1915+105 at timescales down\nto ~10 ms. This was made possible for the first time with the Suzaku XIS\nParallel-sum clocking (P-sum) mode, which has the CCD energy-resolution as well\nas a time-resolution of 7.8 ms. Consequently, we found that the variation\namplitude of GRS 1915+105 does not drop at the iron K-energy band at any\ntimescales from 0.06 s to 63000 s, and that the entire X-ray flux and the iron\nfeature are independently variable at timescales of hours. These are naturally\nunderstood in the framework of the ``partial covering'' model, in which\nvariation timescales of the continuum flux and partial absorbers are\nindependent. The difference of energy dependence of the variation amplitude\nbetween AGN and BHB is presumably due to different mechanisms of the outflow\nwinds, i.e., the partial absorbers are due to UV-line driven winds (AGN) or\nthermally-driven winds (BHB).\n","Comment: 32 pages, 16 figures, Accepted for publication in PASJ"]}]

In each\nof them, dark matter interacts sufficiently strongly with terrestrial matter to\nbe stopped in it before reaching underground detectors. As they drift towards\nthe center of the earth by gravity, these thermal dark atoms are radiatively\ncaptured by the atoms of the active medium of underground detectors, which\ncauses the emission of photons that produce the signals through their\ninteractions with the electrons of the medium. This provides a way of\nreinterpreting the results in terms of electron recoils instead of nuclear\nrecoils.

In this paper, we propose two rank minimization methods\nto enhance the performance of interference alignment in the presence of\nuncoordinated interference sources.Firstly, sparsity of the objective function\nis studied and new objective function is proposed then, a new class of convex\nrelaxation is proposed with respect to uncoordinated interferences. Moreover,\nwe use schatten-p-norm as surrogate of rank function and we implement\niteratively reweighted algorithm to solve optimization problem.Finally, our\nsimulation results show that proposed methods can obtain considerably higher\nmultiplexing gain than other approaches in the interference alignment\nframework.\n"]}]

In the zero noise limit, such entropic\ninterpolation converges in a suitable sense to the displacement interpolation\nof optimal mass transport (OMT). We consider two absolutely continuous curves\nin Wasserstein space ${\\cal W}_2$ and study the evolution of the relative\nentropy on ${\\cal W}_2\\times {\\cal W}_2$ on a finite time interval. Thus, this\nstudy differs from previous work in OMT theory concerning relative entropy from\na fixed (often equilibrium) distribution (density). We derive a gradient flow\non Wasserstein product space. We find the remarkable property that fluxes in\nthe two components are opposite. Plugging in the \"steepest descent\" into the\nevolution of the relative entropy we get what appears to be a new formula: The\ntwo flows approach each other at a faster rate than that of two solutions of\nthe same Fokker-Planck.

First, decreasing inter-wire\nspacing increases interline capacitive coupling, which adversely affects\ntransmission energy and delay. Second, lower voltage swings render the\ntransmission susceptible to various noise sources. Coding can be used to\naddress both these problems. So-called crosstalk-avoidance codes mitigate\ncapacitive coupling, and traditional error-correction codes introduce\nresilience against channel errors.\n  Unfortunately, crosstalk-avoidance and error-correction codes cannot be\ncombined in a straightforward manner. On the one hand, crosstalk-avoidance\nencoding followed by error-correction encoding destroys the crosstalk-avoidance\nproperty. On the other hand, error-correction encoding followed by\ncrosstalk-avoidance encoding causes the crosstalk-avoidance decoder to fail in\nthe presence of errors. Existing approaches circumvent this difficulty by using\nadditional bus wires to protect the parities generated from the output of the\nerror-correction encoder, and are therefore inefficient.\n  In this work we propose a novel joint crosstalk-avoidance and\nerror-correction coding and decoding scheme that provides higher bus\ntransmission rates compared to existing approaches. Our joint approach\ncarefully embeds the parities such that the crosstalk-avoidance property is\npreserved. We analyze the rate and minimum distance of the proposed scheme.
