The possibility to specify the exact position of the\nboundary, independent of other simulation parameters, simplifies the analysis\nof the system. For practical applications it should allow to freely specify the\ndirection of the flux, and it should be straight forward to implement in three\ndimensions. Furthermore, especially for parallelized solvers it is of great\nadvantage if the boundary condition can be applied locally, involving only\ninformation available on the current lattice site. We meet this need by\ndescribing in detail how to transfer the approach suggested by Zou and He to a\nD3Q19 lattice. The boundary condition acts locally, is independent of the\ndetails of the relaxation process during collision and contains no artificial\nslip. In particular, the case of an on-site no-slip boundary condition is\nnaturally included. We test the boundary condition in several setups and\nconfirm that it is capable to accurately model the velocity field up to second\norder and does not contain any numerical slip.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 4 figures, revised version"]}]

A suitable example is parasite spreading:\nseveral parasites may be transmitted among their hosts through different\nmechanisms, each one giving rise to a network of interactions. Modelling these\nnetworked, ecological interactions at the same time is still an open challenge.\nWe present a novel spatially-embedded multiplex network framework for modelling\nmulti-host infection spreading through multiple routes of transmission. Our\nmodel is inspired by T. cruzi, a parasite transmitted by trophic and vectorial\nmechanisms. Our ecological network model is represented by a multiplex in which\nnodes represent species populations interacting through a food web and a\nparasite contaminative layer at the same time. We modelled an SI dynamics in\ntwo different scenarios: a simple theoretical food web and an empirical one.\nOur simulations in both scenarios show that the infection is more widespread\nwhen both the trophic and the contaminative interactions are considered with\nequal rates. This indicates that trophic and contaminative transmission may\nhave additive effects in real ecosystems. We also find that the ratio of\nvectors-to-host in the community (i) crucially influences the infection spread,\n(ii) regulates a percolating phase transition in the rate of parasite\ntransmission and (iii) increases the infection rate in hosts. By immunising the\nsame fractions of predator and prey populations, we show that the multiplex\ntopology is fundamental in outlining the role that each host species plays in\nparasite transmission in a given ecosystem.

We address\nthis difficulty using a mixed-integer programming model that allows us to\ncompute a cycle of clusters with maximum net flow, i.e., large forward and\nsmall backward probability. For a synthetic genetic regulatory network\nconsisting of a ring-oscillator with three genes, we show that this approach\ncan detect the most productive overall cycle, outperforming classical spectral\nanalysis methods.

At each time, the global\nfunction can be cast as a sum of a finite number of local functions, each of\nwhich is assigned to one agent in the network. Moreover, the local functions\nbecome available to agents sequentially, and agents do not have a prior\nknowledge of the future cost functions. Therefore, agents must communicate with\neach other to build an online approximation of the global function.

The contact hyperfine coupling and the dipolar interaction between\nthe polaron and proton spins are found to have distinct contributions in the\nESEEM spectra. However, since the two contributions are spaced very closely,\nand the dipolar contribution is dominant, the detection of the contact\nhyperfine interaction is difficult. To resolve this problem, a recipe of\nprobing the contact hyperfine and dipolar interactions selectively is proposed,\nand a method for detecting the polaron contact hyperfine interaction is\nformulated. The ESEEM decay due to the polaron random hopping is analyzed, and\nthe robustness of the method against this decay is verified. Moreover, this\ndecay is linked to the transport properties of polarons, providing an auxiliary\nprobe for the polaron transport.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 11 figures"]}]

However when the data matrix is sparse or\nnoisy, classic spectral methods usually fail to work, due to localization of\neigenvectors (or singular vectors) induced by the sparsity or noise. In this\nwork, we propose a general method to solve the localization problem by learning\na regularization matrix from the localized eigenvectors. Using matrix\nperturbation analysis, we demonstrate that the learned regularizations suppress\ndown the eigenvalues associated with localized eigenvectors and enable us to\nrecover the informative eigenvectors representing the global structure. We show\napplications of our method in several inference problems: community detection\nin networks, clustering from pairwise similarities, rank estimation and matrix\ncompletion problems. Using extensive experiments, we illustrate that our method\nsolves the localization problem and works down to the theoretical detectability\nlimits in different kinds of synthetic data. This is in contrast with existing\nspectral algorithms based on data matrix, non-backtracking matrix, Laplacians\nand those with rank-one regularizations, which perform poorly in the sparse\ncase with noise.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 9 figures, Neural Information Processing Systems 2016"]}]
