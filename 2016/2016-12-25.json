During the 2003-2004 shutdown the beam line\nwas modified in order to accommodate a new tertiary beam line, able to produce\nand transport particles in the momentum range of 1 to 9 GeV/c. Such low\nmomentum hadron and electron particle beams are requested by the LHC\nexperiments in order to calibrate various sub-detector systems. The design and\nfirst performance results from this new tertiary beam are described here.\n"]}]

When smooth planar meshes, the\nperformance of the MDM is effectively identical to that of Laplacian smoothing,\nfor triangular and quadrilateral meshes; however, the MDM outperforms Laplacian\nsmoothing for tri-quad meshes. When smooth surface meshes, for trian-gular,\nquadrilateral and quad-dominant mixed meshes, the mean quality(MQ) of all mesh\nelements always increases and the mean square error (MSE) decreases during\nsmoothing; For tri-dominant mixed mesh, the quality of triangles always\ndescends while that of quads ascends. Test examples show that the MDM is\nconvergent for both planar and surface triangular, quadrilateral and tri-quad\nmeshes.\n","Comment: 18 pages"]}]
