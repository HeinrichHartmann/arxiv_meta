Here we describe a complete and\nconsistent mathematical framework for the discussion and analysis of complete\npositivity for correlated initial states of open quantum systems. This\nformalism is built upon a few simple axioms and is sufficiently general to\ncontain all prior methodologies going back to Pechakas, PRL (1994). The key\nobservation is that initial system-bath states with the same reduced state on\nthe system must evolve under all admissible unitary operators to system-bath\nstates with the same reduced state on the system, in order to ensure that the\ninduced dynamical maps on the system are well-defined. Once this consistency\ncondition is imposed, related concepts like the assignment map and the\ndynamical maps are uniquely defined. In general, the dynamical maps may not be\napplied to arbitrary system states, but only to those in an appropriately\ndefined physical domain. We show that the constrained nature of the problem\ngives rise to not one but three inequivalent types of complete positivity.\nUsing this framework we elucidate the limitations of recent attempts to provide\nconditions for complete positivity using quantum discord and the quantum\ndata-processing inequality.

Because these results were obtained for an\nincompressible fluid, their validity for gas planets and stars remains to be\nassessed. A common approach is to take some density stratification into account\nwith the so-called anelastic approximation. The validity of previous results\nobtained in the Boussinesq approximation is tested for anelastic models. We\npoint out and explain specific differences between both types of models, in\nparticular with respect to the field geometry and the field strength, but we\nalso compare scaling laws for the velocity amplitude, the magnetic dissipation\ntime, and the convective heat flux. Our investigation is based on a systematic\nparameter study of spherical dynamo models in the anelastic approximation. We\nmake use of a recently developed numerical solver and provide results for the\ntest cases of the anelastic dynamo benchmark. The dichotomy of dipolar and\nmultipolar dynamos identified in Boussinesq simulations is also present in our\nsample of anelastic models. Dipolar models require that the typical length\nscale of convection is an order of magnitude larger than the Rossby radius.\nHowever, the distinction between both classes of models is somewhat less\nexplicit than in previous studies. This is mainly due to two reasons: we found\na number of models with a considerable equatorial dipole contribution and an\nintermediate overall dipole field strength. Furthermore, a large density\nstratification may hamper the generation of dipole dominated magnetic fields.\nPreviously proposed scaling laws, such as those for the field strength, are\nsimilarly applicable to anelastic models. It is not clear, however, if this\nconsistency necessarily implies similar dynamo processes in both settings.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 11 figures"]}]

We investigate this scenario in depth using 42 relativistic\n2D simulations with multi-group neutrino transport to examine the effects of\nvelocity and density perturbations in the progenitor for different perturbation\ngeometries that obey fundamental physical constraints (like the anelastic\ncondition). As a framework for analysing our results, we introduce\nsemi-empirical scaling laws relating neutrino heating, average turbulent\nvelocities in the gain region, and the shock deformation in the saturation\nlimit of non-radial instabilities. The squared turbulent Mach number, <Ma^2>,\nreflects the violence of aspherical motions in the gain layer, and explosive\nrunaway occurs for <Ma^2>~0.3, corresponding to a reduction of the critical\nneutrino luminosity by ~25% compared to 1D. In the light of this theory,\nprogenitor asphericities aid shock revival mainly by creating anisotropic mass\nflux onto the shock: Differential infall efficiently converts velocity\nperturbations in the progenitor into density perturbations (Delta rho/rho) at\nthe shock of the order of the initial convective Mach number Ma. The\nanisotropic mass flux and ram pressure deform the shock and thereby amplify\npost-shock turbulence. Large-scale (l=2,l=1) modes prove most conducive to\nshock revival, whereas small-scale perturbations require unrealistically high\nconvective Mach numbers. Initial density perturbations in the progenitor are\nonly of order Ma^2 and therefore play a subdominant role.\n","Comment: revised version, 34 pages, 24 figures"]}]

SLRMA extends the conventional LRMA by\nexploring both the intra- and inter-coherence of data samples simultaneously.\nWith the aid of prescribed orthogonal transforms (e.g., discrete cosine/wavelet\ntransform and graph transform), SLRMA decomposes a matrix into a product of two\nsmaller matrices, where one matrix is made of extremely sparse and orthogonal\ncolumn vectors, and the other consists of the transform coefficients.\nTechnically, we formulate SLRMA as a constrained optimization problem, i.e.,\nminimizing the approximation error in the least-squares sense regularized by\n$\\ell_0$-norm and orthogonality, and solve it using the inexact augmented\nLagrangian multiplier method. Through extensive tests on real-world data, such\nas 2D image sets and 3D dynamic meshes, we observe that (i) SLRMA empirically\nconverges well; (ii) SLRMA can produce approximation error comparable to LRMA\nbut in a much sparse form; (iii) SLRMA-based compression schemes significantly\noutperform the state-of-the-art in terms of rate-distortion performance.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 11 figures"]}]

Though many clustering\nalgorithms have been proposed, clustering theories that justify the use of\nthese clustering algorithms are still unsatisfactory. In particular, one of the\nfundamental challenges is to address the following question:\n  What is a cluster in a set of data points?\n  In this paper, we make an attempt to address such a question by considering a\nset of data points associated with a distance measure (metric). We first\npropose a new cohesion measure in terms of the distance measure. Using the\ncohesion measure, we define a cluster as a set of points that are cohesive to\nthemselves. For such a definition, we show there are various equivalent\nstatements that have intuitive explanations. We then consider the second\nquestion:\n  How do we find clusters and good partitions of clusters under such a\ndefinition?\n  For such a question, we propose a hierarchical agglomerative algorithm and a\npartitional algorithm. Unlike standard hierarchical agglomerative algorithms,\nour hierarchical agglomerative algorithm has a specific stopping criterion and\nit stops with a partition of clusters. Our partitional algorithm, called the\nK-sets algorithm in the paper, appears to be a new iterative algorithm. Unlike\nthe Lloyd iteration that needs two-step minimization, our K-sets algorithm only\ntakes one-step minimization.\n  One of the most interesting findings of our paper is the duality result\nbetween a distance measure and a cohesion measure. Such a duality result leads\nto a dual K-sets algorithm for clustering a set of data points with a cohesion\nmeasure.

The\nuniqueness condition implies spatial mixing, and an FPTAS for the partition\nfunction exists based on spatial mixing. On the other hand, non-uniqueness\nimplies some long range correlation, based on which NP-hardness reductions are\nbuilt. These connections for ferromagnetic 2-spin systems are much less clear,\ndespite their similarities to anti-ferromagnetic systems. The celebrated\nJerrum-Sinclair Markov chain [JS93] works even if spatial mixing or uniqueness\nfails.\n  We provide some partial answers. We use $(\\beta,\\gamma)$ to denote the\n$(+,+)$ and $(-,-)$ edge interactions and $\\lambda$ the external field, where\n$\\beta\\gamma>1$. If all fields satisfy $\\lambda<\\lambda_c$ (assuming\n$\\beta\\le\\gamma$), where\n$\\lambda_c=\\left(\\gamma/\\beta\\right)^\\frac{\\Delta_c+1}{2}$ and\n$\\Delta_c=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\beta\\gamma}+1}{\\sqrt{\\beta\\gamma}-1}$, then a weaker\nversion of spatial mixing holds in all trees. Moreover, if $\\beta\\le 1$, then\n$\\lambda<\\lambda_c$ is sufficient to guarantee strong spatial mixing and FPTAS.\nThis improves the previous best algorithm, which is an FPRAS based on Markov\nchains and works for $\\lambda<\\gamma/\\beta$ [LLZ14a]. The bound $\\lambda_c$ is\nalmost optimal. When $\\beta\\le 1$, uniqueness holds in all infinite regular\ntrees, if and only if $\\lambda\\le\\lambda_c^{int}$, where\n$\\lambda_c^{int}=\\left(\\gamma/\\beta\\right)^\\frac{\\lceil\\Delta_c\\rceil+1}{2}$.\nIf we allow fields $\\lambda>\\lambda_c^{int'}$, where\n$\\lambda_c^{int'}=\\left(\\gamma/\\beta\\right)^\\frac{\\lfloor\\Delta_c\\rfloor+2}{2}$,\nthen approximating the partition function is #BIS-hard.\n","Comment: v2: improved presentation"]}]

In the XX case, distinctly from the\nusual uncorrelated random case where the system is governed by an\ninfinite-disorder fixed point, the correlated-disorder chain is governed by\nfinite-disorder fixed points. Surprisingly, we verify that, although the system\nis not conformally invariant, the leading behavior of the R\\'enyi entanglement\nentropies are similar to those of the clean (no randomness) conformally\ninvariant system. In addition, we compute the Shannon mutual information among\nsubsystems of our correlated-disorder quantum chain and verify the same leading\nbehavior as the $n=2$ R\\'enyi entanglement entropy. This result extends a\nrecent conjecture concerning the same universal behavior of these quantities\nfor conformally invariant quantum chains. For the generic spin-1/2 quantum\ncritical XXZ case, the true asymptotic regime is identical to that in the\nuncorrelated disorder case. However, these finite-disorder fixed points govern\nthe low-energy physics up to a very long crossover length scale and the same\nresults as in the XX case apply.

Kesari and\ncoworkers have later shown some very elegant convenient asymptotic expansion of\nGuduru's solution. This enhancement is very high and indeed, using Kesari's\nsolution, it is here shown to depend uniquely on a Johnson parameter for\nadhesion of a sinusoidal contact. However, counterintuitively, it leads to\nunbounded enhancement for conditions of large roughness for which Johnson\nparameter is very low. Guduru postulated that this enhancement should occur\nafter sufficiently large pressure has been applied to any spherical contact.\nAlso, that although the enhancement is limited to the JKR regime of large soft\nmaterials with high adhesion, the DMT limit for the smooth sphere is found\notherwise. However, for hard materials, even the DMT limit for the smooth\nsolids is very hard to observe, which suggest that also adhesion reduction is\nyet not well understood.\n  The limitations of the assumption of simply connected area is here further\ndiscussed, and a well known model for hard particles in contact with rough\nplanes due to Rumpf is used to show that in the range where unbounded increase\nis predicted, orders of magnitude reduction is instead expected for rigid\nsolids.

When considering the task it is taken into account\nthat double-stranded DNA is a polymorphic macromolecule with a set of\nmetastable states. Accordingly to proposed mechanism, DNA threshold elongation\ncan take place as a cooperative structural transition of macromolecule to\nmetastable form, which is stabilized by the external force. For the description\nof DNA overstretching, the model included external (stretching) and internal\n(conformation) displacement components is constructed. As assumed, both\ncomponents are coupled on the pathway of double helix transformations. It is\nshown, that under force action DNA deformation proceeds in two stages. First\none is the restructuring of the double helix, which leads to formation of\nconformational bistability in DNA macromolecule. On the second stage, the\nconformational transition and the deformation induced by it consistently cover\nthe macromolecule as a threshold process. The comparison of calculated\ncharacteristics of DNA overstretching process with experimental data shows good\nagreement. Analysis of the results obtained, together with the available\nliterature data allow to conclude, that overstretching transition in the double\nhelix is dynamical process and can spread in DNA chain.
