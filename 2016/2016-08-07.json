In this work we present the\ndetails of our campaign and the data obtained by all the observatories. We\ndetermine the spectral energy distribution of NGC 5548 from near-infrared to\nhard X-rays by establishing the contribution of various emission and absorption\nprocesses taking place along our line of sight towards the central engine. We\nthus uncover the intrinsic emission and produce a broadband continuum model for\nboth obscured (average summer 2013 data) and unobscured ($<$ 2011) epochs of\nNGC 5548. Our results suggest that the intrinsic NIR/optical/UV continuum is a\nsingle Comptonised component with its higher energy tail creating the 'soft\nX-ray excess'. This component is compatible with emission from a warm,\noptically-thick corona as part of the inner accretion disk. We then investigate\nthe effects of the continuum on the ionisation balance and thermal stability of\nphotoionised gas for unobscured and obscured epochs.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A, 19 pages, 13 figures"]}]

Furthermore, several additional\nmagnetic instabilities are detected at lower temperatures.

In this work, we formulate\nthe decision of merging dependent multivariate normal variables in an AHC\nprocedure as a Bayesian model comparison. We found that the Bayesian\nformulation naturally shrinks the empirical covariance matrix towards a matrix\nset a priori (e.g., the identity), provides an automated stopping rule, and\ncorrects for dimensionality using a term that scales up the measure as a\nfunction of the dimensionality of the variables. Also, the resulting log Bayes\nfactor is asymptotically proportional to the plug-in estimate of mutual\ninformation, with an additive correction for dimensionality in agreement with\nthe Bayesian information criterion. We investigated the behavior of these\nBayesian alternatives (in exact and asymptotic forms) to mutual information on\nsimulated and real data. An encouraging result was first derived on\nsimulations: the hierarchical clustering based on the log Bayes factor\noutperformed off-the-shelf clustering techniques as well as raw and normalized\nmutual information in terms of classification accuracy. On a toy example, we\nfound that the Bayesian approaches led to results that were similar to those of\nmutual information clustering techniques, with the advantage of an automated\nthresholding. On real functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets\nmeasuring brain activity, it identified clusters consistent with the\nestablished outcome of standard procedures.

Mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)\nactivity state, with a VHE flux of about half that of the Crab Nebula, yet the\nlight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highest\nvariability being in the X-rays. We determined the power spectral densities\n(PSD) at most wavelengths and found that all PSDs can be described by\npower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noise\nbehavior. We observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the X-ray spectra and\nmeasured a positive correlation between VHE and X-ray fluxes with zero time\nlag. Such characteristics have been reported many times during flaring\nactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaring\nstate. We also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/UV and\nX-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.\n  The harder-when-brighter behavior in the X-ray spectra and the measured\npositive X-ray/VHE correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaign\nsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaring\nstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. In\nparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsible\nfor the emission of Mrk421 during non-flaring activity. Such a temporally\nextended X-ray/VHE correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, and\nhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. The\nhighest variability is observed in the X-ray band, which, within the one-zone\nsynchrotron self-Compton scenario, indicates that the electron energy\ndistribution is most variable at the highest energies.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A, 18 pages, 14 figures (v2 has a small\n  modification in the acknowledgments, and also corrects a typo in the field\n  \"author\" in the metadata)"]}]

Because of the\nrapid cooling of CR electrons in dense starburst galaxies ($\\sim10^4-10^5$ yr),\nthe more extended synchrotron radio-emitting size being a result of CR\ndiffusion seems unlikely. Instead, if SMGs are driven by galaxy mergers the\nradio synchrotron emission might arise from more extended magnetised ISM around\nthe starburst region.\n","Comment: 18 pages (incl. 5 appendices), 7 figures, and 5 tables; accepted for\n  publication in A&A; abstract abridged for arXiv"]}]

We present optical and X-ray observations of GRB\n130831A obtained by Swift, Chandra, Skynet, RATIR, Maidanak, ISON, NOT, LT and\nGTC. This burst shows a steep drop in the X-ray light-curve at $\\simeq 10^5$ s\nafter the trigger, with a power-law decay index of $\\alpha \\sim 6$. Such a rare\nbehaviour cannot be explained by the standard forward shock (FS) model and\nindicates that the emission, up to the fast decay at $10^5$ s, must be of\n\"internal origin\", produced by a dissipation process within an\nultrarelativistic outflow.

After the drop, the faint X-ray\nafterglow continues with a much shallower decay. The optical emission, on the\nother hand, shows no break across the X-ray steep decrease, and the late-time\ndecays of both the X-ray and optical are consistent. Using both the X-ray and\noptical data, we show that the emission after $\\simeq 10^5$ s can be explained\nwell by the FS model.

What triggered its\nactivity? We present ALMA Cycle 2 observations of cold molecular CO(6-5) gas\nand dust, which reveal that this is likely a gas-rich triple merger. It\nconsists of a close double nucleus (separation ~4 kpc) and a weak CO-emitter at\n~10 kpc distance, all of which have counterparts in HST/NICMOS imagery. The\nhyper-luminous starburst and powerful radio-AGN were triggered at this\nprecoalescent stage of the merger. The CO(6-5) traces dense molecular gas in\nthe central region, and complements existing CO(1-0) data, which revealed more\nwidespread tidal debris of cold gas. We also find ~10$^{10}$ M(sun) of\nmolecular gas with enhanced excitation at the highest velocities. At least\n20-50% of this high-excitation, high-velocity gas shows kinematics that\nsuggests it is being displaced and redistributed within the merger, although\nwith line-of-sight velocities of |v| < 500 km/s, this gas will probably not\nescape the system. The processes that drive the redistribution of cold gas are\nlikely related to either the gravitational interaction between two kpc-scale\ndiscs, or starburst/AGN-driven outflows. We estimate that the rate at which the\nmolecular gas is redistributed is at least ~1200 +- 500 M(sun)/yr, and could\nperhaps even approach the star formation rate of ~3000 +- 800 M(sun)/yr. The\nfact that the gas depletion and gas redistribution timescales are similar\nimplies that dynamical processes can be important in the evolution of massive\nhigh-z galaxies.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A (6 pages, 5 figures)"]}]

However, this optical luminous quasar has not\nbeen detected before in deep X-ray observations, making it the most extreme\nX-ray weak quasar known today. This study aims to detect PG 0043+039 in a deep\nX-ray exposure. The question is what causes the extreme X-ray weakness of PG\n0043+039? Does PG 0043+039 show other spectral or continuum peculiarities? We\ntook simultaneous deep X-ray spectra with XMM-Newton, far-ultraviolet (FUV)\nspectra with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and optical spectra of PG\n0043+039 with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) and Southern African Large\nTelescope (SALT) in July, 2013. We have detected PG 0043+039 in our X-ray\nexposure taken in 2013. We presented our first results in a separate paper\n(Kollatschny et al. 2015). PG 0043+039 shows an extreme {\\alpha}_ox gradient\n({\\alpha}_ox =-2.37). Furthermore, we were able to verify an X-ray flux of this\nsource in a reanalysis of the X-ray data taken in 2005. At that time, it was\nfainter by a factor of 3.8 +- 0.9 with {\\alpha}_ox=-2.55. The X-ray spectrum is\ncompatible with a normal quasar power-law spectrum ({\\Gamma}=1.70_-0.45^+0.57)\nwith moderate intrinsic absorption (N_H=5.5_-3.9^+6.9 +- 10^21cm^-2) and\nreflection. The UV/optical flux of PG 0043+039 has increased by a factor of 1.8\ncompared to spectra taken in the years 1990-1991. The FUV spectrum is highly\npeculiar and dominated by broad bumps besides Ly{\\alpha}. There is no\ndetectable Lyman edge associated with the BAL absorbing gas seen in the CIV\nline. PG 0043+039 shows a maximum in the overall continuum flux at around\n{\\lambda} 2500{\\AA} in contrast to most other AGN where the maximum is found at\nshorter wavelengths. All the above is compatible with an intrinsically X-ray\nweak quasar, rather than an absorbed X-ray emission.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 18 figures, Astronomy & Astrophysics in press"]}]

We follow the spectral evolution of different pulse phase intervals and\nfind a phase and energy-variable spectral feature, which we interpret as proton\ncyclotron resonant scattering of soft photon from currents circulating in a\nstrong (10^14 G) small-scale component of the magnetic field near the neutron\nstar surface, superimposed to the much weaker (~3 x 10^13 G) magnetic dipole\nfield. We discuss also the implications of the pulse-resolved spectral analysis\nfor the emission regions on the surface of the cooling magnetar.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

The experiments were performed\nat the MAMI accelerator facility in Mainz using the Glasgow photon tagging\nspectrometer and the Crystal Ball/TAPS detector. The accelerator delivered\nelectron beams of 1508 and 1557~MeV, which produced bremsstrahlung in thin\nradiator foils. The tagged photon beam covered energies up to 1400~MeV. The\ndata from the free proton target are in good agreement with previous\nmeasurements and were only used to test the analysis procedures. The results\nfor differential cross sections (angular distributions and invariant-mass\ndistributions) for free and quasi-free protons are almost identical in shape,\nbut differ in absolute magnitude up to 15\\%. Thus, moderate final-state\ninteraction effects are present. The data for quasi-free neutrons are similar\nto the proton data in the second resonance region (final state invariant masses\nup to $\\approx$1550~MeV), where both reactions are dominated by the\n$N(1520)3/2^-\\rightarrow \\Delta(1232)3/2^+\\pi$ decay. At higher energies,\nangular and invariant-mass distributions are different. A simple analysis of\nthe shapes of the invariant-mass distributions in the third resonance region is\nconsistent with strong contributions of an $N^{\\star}\\rightarrow N\\sigma$ decay\nfor the proton, while the reaction is dominated by a sequential decay via a\n$\\Delta\\pi$ intermediate state for the neutron. The data are compared to\npredictions from the Two-Pion-MAID model and the Bonn-Gatchina coupled channel\nanalysis.\n","Comment: accepted for publication in Eur. Phys. J. A"]}]
