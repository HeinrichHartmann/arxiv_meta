We follow the evolution of dark stars from their inception at $\\sim 1\nM_\\odot$ as they accrete mass from their surroundings to become supermassive\nstars, some even reaching masses $> 10^6 M_\\odot$ and luminosities $>10^{10}\nL_\\odot$, making them detectable with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.\nOnce the dark matter runs out and the dark star dies, it may collapse to a\nblack hole; thus dark stars may provide seeds for the supermassive black holes\nobserved throughout the Universe and at early times. Other sites for dark star\nformation may exist in the Universe today in regions of high dark matter\ndensity such as the centers of galaxies. The current review briefly discusses\ndark stars existing today, but focuses on the early generation of dark stars.\n","Comment: 45 pages; 13 Figures; revised and expanded version of an invited\n  review for Reports on Progress in Physics"]}]

Such configurations are usually connected to\nexceptional local stability properties of the flow which come along with an\nimproved local forecast skills during the phenomenon. It is instead extremely\nhard to predict onset and decay of blockings. Covariant Lyapunov Vectors (CLVs)\noffer a suitable characterization of the linear stability of a chaotic flow,\nsince they represent the full tangent linear dynamics by a covariant basis\nwhich explores linear perturbations at all time scales. Therefore, we assess\nwhether CLVs feature a signature of the blockings. As a first step, we examine\nthe CLVs for a quasi-geostrophic beta-plane 2-layer model in a periodic channel\nbaroclinically driven by a meridional temperature gradient $\\Delta T$. An\norographic forcing enhances the emergence of localized blocked regimes. We\ndetect the blocking events with a Tibaldi-Molteni scheme adapted to the\nperiodic channel. When blocking occurs, the global growth rates of the fastest\ngrowing CLVs are significantly higher. Hence, against intuition, the\ncirculation is globally more unstable in blocked phases. Such an increase in\nthe finite time Lyapunov exponents with respect to the long term average is\nattributed to stronger barotropic and baroclinic conversion in the case of high\ntemperature gradients, while for low values of \\Delta T, the effect is only due\nto stronger barotropic instability. In order to determine the localization of\nthe CLVs we compare the meridionally averaged variance of the CLVs during\nblocked and unblocked phases.

Then the\nisomeric cross section ratios for 187Re(n,2n)186m,gRe reaction are calculated\nusing the method of Monte Carlo calculations based on the nuclear statistical\ntheory. Combining these two calculated results, the excitation functions for\n187Re(n,2n)186mRe and 187Re(n,2n)186gRe reactions are obtained.

The\nefficiency of meta-modeling techniques relies on their ability to provide\nstatistically-equivalent analytical representations based on relatively few\nevaluations of the original model. Polynomial chaos expansions (PCE) have\nproven a powerful tool for developing meta-models in a wide range of\napplications; the key idea thereof is to expand the model response onto a basis\nmade of multivariate polynomials obtained as tensor products of appropriate\nunivariate polynomials. The classical PCE approach nevertheless faces the\n\"curse of dimensionality\", namely the exponential increase of the basis size\nwith increasing input dimension. To address this limitation, the sparse PCE\ntechnique has been proposed, in which the expansion is carried out on only a\nfew relevant basis terms that are automatically selected by a suitable\nalgorithm. An alternative for developing meta-models with polynomial functions\nin high-dimensional problems is offered by the newly emerged low-rank\napproximations (LRA) approach. By exploiting the tensor-product structure of\nthe multivariate basis, LRA can provide polynomial representations in highly\ncompressed formats. Through extensive numerical investigations, we herein first\nshed light on issues relating to the construction of canonical LRA with a\nparticular greedy algorithm involving a sequential updating of the polynomial\ncoefficients along separate dimensions. Canonical LRA exhibit smaller errors\nthan sparse PCE in cases when the number of available model evaluations is\nsmall with respect to the input dimension. By introducing the conditional\ngeneralization error, we further demonstrate that canonical LRA tend to\noutperform sparse PCE in the prediction of extreme model responses.\n"]}]

Our first notable finding is the mechanism\nof reward/penalty associated with patience, as quantified by the return on\nassets. In regular economies where the EBITA/Assets ratio is larger than the\ncost of debt, starting with a trust higher than leverage results in the highest\nlong-term return on assets (which can be seen as a proxy for economic growth).\nOur second main finding concerns a recommendation for the reaction of a central\nbank to an external shock that affects negatively the economic growth.

The\nphenomenon can be ascribed to the fact that postponing intervention allows\ntrust to increase first, and it is most effective to intervene when trust is\nhigh.

In supersymmetric (SUSY) theories, the one-loop\nthreshold corrections (TC) are of particular importance and, since they affect\nthe quark-lepton mass relations, link a given GUT flavour model to the\nsparticle spectrum.

We confirm the results of earlier 2-D simulations\nshowing both field-parallel aligned propagating fluctuations and fluctuations\ncarried by the reflected-gyrating ions. In addition, it is shown that, for 2-D\nsimulations of the shock coplanarity plane, the presence of short-wavelength\nfluctuations in all magnetic components is associated with the ion Weibel\ninstability driven at the upstream edge of the foot by the reflected-gyrating\nions. In 3-D simulations we show for the first time that the dominant\nmicrostructure is due to a coupling between field-parallel propagating\nfluctuations in the ramp and the motion of the reflected ions. This results in\na pattern of fluctuations counter-propagating across the surface of the shock\nat an angle inclined to the magnetic field direction, due to a combination of\nfield-parallel motion at the Alfv\\'en speed of the ramp, and motion in the\nsense of gyration of the reflected ions.\n","Comment: Submitted to Journal of Plasma Physics"]}]

We investigate two classes of such models,\ncharacterized by the following underlying production and decay chains: $gg \\to\nS\\to A'A'\\to (e^+e^-)(e^+e^-)$ and $q\\bar q \\to Z' \\to sa\\to (e^+e^-)(e^+e^-)$,\nwhere at the first step a heavy scalar, $S$, or vector, $Z'$, resonances are\nproduced that decay to light metastable vectors, $A'$, or (pseudo-)scalars, $s$\nand $a$. Setting the parameters of the models to explain the existing excess,\nand taking the ATLAS detector geometry into account, we marginalize over the\nproperties of heavy resonances in order to derive the expected lifetimes and\ncouplings of metastable light resonances. We observe that in the case of $A'$,\nthe suggested range of masses and mixing angles $\\epsilon$ is within reach of\nseveral new-generation intensity frontier experiments.\n","Comment: 38 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables, references added"]}]

This explains the\nfavored choice of small patch-size in most applications.\n  Is there a way to keep the simplicity and work with small patches while\ngetting some of the benefits that large patches provide? In this work we offer\nsuch an approach. We propose to concatenate the regular content of a\nconventional (small) patch with a compact representation of its (large)\nsurroundings - its context. Therefore, with a minor increase of the dimensions\n(e.g. with additional 10 values to the patch representation), we\nimplicitly/softly describe the information of a large patch. The additional\ndescriptors are computed based on a self-similarity behavior of the patch\nsurrounding.\n  We show that this approach achieves better matches, compared to the use of\nconventional-size patches, without the need to increase the database-size.\nAlso, the effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on three distinct\nproblems: (i) External natural image denoising, (ii) Depth image\nsuper-resolution, and (iii) Motion-compensated frame-rate up-conversion.\n","Comment: Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing"]}]

In\nparticular, we derive a factorization formula for a large class of soft drop\njet substructure observables, including jet mass. The essential observation\nthat allows for this factorization is that, without the soft wide-angle\nradiation groomed by soft drop, all singular contributions are collinear. The\nsimplicity and universality of the collinear limit in QCD allows us to show\nthat to all orders, the normalized differential cross section has no\ncontributions from non-global logarithms. It is also independent of process, up\nto the relative fraction of quark and gluon jets. In fact, soft drop allows us\nto define this fraction precisely.

Using the factorization theorem, we resum the soft drop jet mass\nto next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy.

Multiple single-antenna users are served\nusing zero-forcing beamforming with equal power allocation across the beams.\nFor such a system, we obtain tractable, but accurate, approximations of the\nsignal power and inter-cluster interference power distributions and derive a\ncomputationally efficient expression for the achievable per-BS ergodic sum rate\nusing tools from stochastic geometry. This expression allows us to obtain the\noptimal loading factor, i.e., the ratio between the number of scheduled users\nand the number of BS antennas, that maximizes the per-BS ergodic sum rate.\nFurther, it allows us to quantify the performance improvement of network MIMO\nsystems as a function of the cooperating cluster size. We show that to perform\nzero-forcing across the distributed set of BSs within the cluster, the network\nMIMO system introduces a penalty in received signal power. Along with the\ninevitable out-of-cluster interference, we show that the per-BS ergodic sum\nrate of a network MIMO system does not approach that of an isolated cell even\nat unrealistically large cluster sizes. Nevertheless, network MIMO does provide\nsignificant rate improvement as compared to uncoordinated single-cell\nprocessing even at relatively modest cluster sizes.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication at IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing"]}]

Specifically, the effects of simple\nspring-damper walls are contrasted with the effects of more complex walls\nincorporating tension, stiffness and anisotropy. In addition, varying mass\nratios are tested to provide insight into differences between aerodynamic and\nhydrodynamic applications. Despite the differing physical responses, all the\nwalls tested exhibit some important common features. First, the effect of the\nwalls (positive or negative) is greatest at conditions close to resonance, with\nsharp transitions in performance across the resonant frequency or phase speed.\nSecond, compliant walls are predicted to have a more pronounced effect on\nslower-moving structures because such structures generally have larger\nwall-pressure signatures. Third, two-dimensional (spanwise constant) structures\nare particularly susceptible to further amplification. These features are\nconsistent with many previous experiments and simulations, suggesting that\nmitigating the rise of such two-dimensional structures is essential to\ndesigning performance-improving walls. For instance, it is shown that further\namplification of such large-scale two-dimensional structures explains why the\noptimal anisotropic walls identified by Fukagata et al. via DNS (J. Turb., 9,\n1-17) only led to drag reduction in very small domains. The above observations\nare used to develop design and methodology guidelines for future research on\ncompliant walls.\n"]}]

Until recently, the verifiable dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) of HH\nphases has remained moderate near 1, which limits the power conversion\nefficiency of these materials.

Introduction of mass fluctuation and\nscattering centers play a key role in the high ZT measured, as shown by the\nreduction of thermal conductivity and increase of thermopower. Based on\ncomputation, the power conversion efficiency of a n-p couple module based on\nthe new n-type (Hf,Zr,Ti)NiSn particles-in-matrix composite and recently\nreported high-ZT p-type HH phases is expected to reach 13%, comparable to that\nof state-of-the-art materials, but with the mentioned additional materials and\nenvironmental attributes.

Constraints on this relationship in NSXBs are strongly\nneeded, as comparing this correlation between different classes of XB systems\nis key in understanding the properties that affect the jet production process\nin accreting objects. Our best fit disc-jet coupling index for EXO 1745$-$248\nis consistent with the measured correlation in NSXB 4U 1728$-$34 ($\\beta=1.5\\pm\n0.2$) but inconsistent with the correlation we fit using the most recent\nmeasurements from the literature of NSXB Aql X-1\n($\\beta=0.76^{+0.14}_{-0.15}$). While a similar disc-jet coupling index appears\nto hold across multiple BHXBs in the hard accretion state, this does not appear\nto be the case with the three NSXBs measured so far. Additionally, the\nnormalization of the EXO 1745$-$248 correlation is lower than the other two\nNSXBs, making it one of the most radio faint XBs ever detected in the hard\nstate. We also report the detection of a type-I X-ray burst during this\noutburst, where the decay timescale is consistent with hydrogen burning.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 4 figures, Accepted to MNRAS"]}]

We show that the electron pressure has an important\ncontribution to electron acceleration allowing highly parallel energization. In\ncontrast, no significant effect of these additional terms is observed for the\nprotons.\n","Comment: 10 pages"]}]

For the 2-emitter system, formulas are found for \"charge-blunting\" and\n\"neighbour-field\" effects, for widely spaced and \"sufficiently closely spaced\"\nemitters. Mutual charge-blunting is always dominant, with a related (negative)\nfractional AFEF-change {\\delta}_two.

The water anomalies are greatly amplified in metastable\n(supercooled/stretched) regions. This makes difficult a complete experimental\ndescription since, beyond certain limits, the metastable phase necessarily\ntransforms into the stable one. Theoretical interpretation of the water\nanomalies could then be based on simulation results of well validated water\nmodels. But the analysis of the simulations has not yet reached a consensus.

In this work we propose to use a number of exact thermodynamic\nrelations which can be tested in a region of the phase diagram outside the LLCP\nthus avoiding the problems associated to the coexistence region. The central\nproperty connected to other water anomalies is the locus of temperatures at\nwhich the density along isobars attain a maximum (TMD line) or a minimum (TmD),\ncomputed via simulations for a successful water model, TIP4P/2005. Next, we\nhave evaluated the vapor-liquid spinodal in the region of large negative\npressures. The shape of these curves and their connection to the extrema of\nresponse functions (isothermal compressibility and heat capacity at constant\npressure) may help to elucidate the validity of the theoretical proposals. In\nthis way we are able to present for the first time a comprehensive scenario of\nthe thermodynamic water anomalies for TIP4P/2005 and their relation to the\nvapor-liquid spinodal.

We\nillustrate our method with a number of examples. Tensor surgery on the triangle\ngraph, which corresponds to the matrix multiplication tensor, leads to\nnontrivial rank upper bounds for all odd cycle graphs, which correspond to the\ntensors of iterated matrix multiplication.

In 4f electron systems, because of strong intra-atomic spin-orbit\ncoupling, an orbitally degenerate state inherently carries quadrupolar degrees\nof freedom. The present work has focussed on a purely quadrupole-active system\nPrIr2Zn20 showing superconductivity in the presence of an antiferroquadrupole\norder at TQ = 0.11 K.

Moreover, in magnetic fields below 6 T,\nall data set of the electrical resistivity and C_4f(T) are well scaled with\ncharacteristic temperatures T0's. This is the first observation of the NFL\nstate in the nonmagnetic quadrupole-active system, whose origin is\nintrinsically different from that observed in the vicinity of the conventional\nquantum critical point. It implies possible formation of a quadrupole Kondo\nlattice resulting from hybridization between the quadrupoles and the conduction\nelectrons.

Therefore, how to quantitatively analyze the impacts of asymptomatic\ninfection on the interplay between diseases and behavioral responses is of\nparticular importance. In this Letter, under the complex network framework, we\nstudy the coupled disease-behavior interaction model by dividing infectious\nindividuals into two states: U-state (without evident clinical symptoms,\nlabelled as U) and I-state (with evident clinical symptoms, labelled as I). A\nsusceptible individual can be infected by U- or I-nodes, however, since the\nU-nodes cannot be easily observed, susceptible individuals take behavioral\nresponses \\emph{only} when they contact I-nodes. The mechanism is considered in\nthe improved Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model and the improved\nSusceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, respectively. Then, one of the most\nconcerned problems in spreading dynamics: the epidemic thresholds for the two\nmodels are given by two methods. The analytic results \\emph{quantitatively}\ndescribe the influence of different factors, such as asymptomatic infection,\nthe awareness rate, the network structure, and so forth, on the epidemic\nthresholds. Moreover, because of the irreversible process of the SIR model, the\nsuppression effect of the improved SIR model is weaker than the improved SIS\nmodel.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures"]}]

Indeed, at the disc-corona interface, the mixing between the\ncold/metal-rich disc gas (T <~ 10^4 K) and the hot coronal gas (T >~ 10^6 K)\ncan dramatically reduce the cooling time of a portion of the corona and produce\nits condensation and accretion.

Motivated by an \"upside-down\"\nscenario for thick disk formation, in which the thickness of the star-forming\ngas layer contracts as the stellar mass of the disk grows, we combine one-zone\nchemical evolution with a simple prescription in which the scale-height of the\nstellar distribution drops linearly from z_h=0.8 kpc to z_h=0.2 kpc over a\ntimescale t_c, remaining constant thereafter. We assume a linear-exponential\nstar-formation history, SFR ~ te^{-t/t_sf}.

The inferred scale-height evolution, with z_h(t) dropping on a\ntimescale t_c ~ t_sf at large lookback times, favors upside-down formation over\ndynamical heating of an initially thin stellar population as the primary\nmechanism regulating disk thickness. The failure of our short-t_c models\nsuggests that any model in which thick disk formation is a discrete event will\nnot reproduce the continuous dependence of the MDF on |z| found by H15.

The ability to perform, in a\nprovably correct manner, such a complex task at the servo level can lead to a\nlarge increase in the speed of operation, low energy consumption and high\nquality of response. Planning has been traditionally limited to the high level\ncontroller of a robot. The guidance velocity signal from this stage is usually\nconverted to a control signal using what is known as an electronic speed\ncontroller (ESC). This paper demonstrates the ability of the harmonic potential\nfield (HPF) approach to generate a provably correct, constrained, well behaved\ntrajectory and control signal for a rigid, nonholonomic robot in a stationary,\ncluttered environment. It is shown that the HPF based, servo level planner can\naddress a large number of challenges facing planning in a realistic situation.\nThe suggested approach migrates the rich and provably correct properties of the\nsolution trajectories from an HPF planner to those of the robot. This is\nachieved using a synchronizing control signal whose aim is to align the\nvelocity of the robot in its local coordinates, with that of the gradient of\nthe HPF. The link between the two is made possible by representing the robot\nusing what the paper terms separable form. The context-sensitive and\ngoal-oriented control signal used to steer the robot is demonstrated to be well\nbehaved and robust in the presence of actuator noise, saturation and\nuncertainty in the parameters.

Our team is\nalso responsible for the implementation of a similar automatic system at\nMt.Graham, site of the LBT (ALTA Project). Our system/method will permit\ntherefore to make a step ahead in the framework of the Service Mode for new\ngeneration telescopes. Among the most exciting achieved results we cite the\nfact that we proved to be able to forecast CN2 profiles with a vertical\nresolution as high as 150 m. Such a feature is particularly crucial for all\nWFAO systems that require such detailed information on the OT vertical\nstratification on the whole 20 km above the ground. This important achievement\ntells us that all the WFAO systems can rely on automatic systems that are able\nto support their optimized use.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 8 figures, Proc.

Including\n$\\r0\\longleftrightarrow\\pho$ processes, we find that the photino relic\nabundance is most sensitive to the $\\r0$-to-$\\pho$ mass ratio, and within model\nuncertainties, a critical density in photinos may be obtained for an\n$\\r0$-to-$\\pho$ mass ratio in the range 1.2 to 2.2. We propose photinos in the\nmass range of 500 MeV to 1.6 GeV as a dark matter candidate, and discuss a\nstrategy to test the hypothesis.\n","Comment: uuencoded compressed tar file containing 32 page LaTeX file and eight\n  postscript figures"]}]

A necessary ingredient to enforce R-parity is the\npossibility of distinguishing the lepton superfields from the Higgs ones. This\nis generally achieved either by assuming different charges under some matter\nparity, or by assigning the superfields to different representations of a\nunified gauge group. We want to put forward the idea that the replica of the\nfermion generations, which constitute an intrinsic difference between the\nfermions and the Higgs superfields, can give a clue to understand R-parity as\nan accidental symmetry. More ambitiously, we suggest a possible relation\nbetween proton stability and the actual number of fermion generations.

For large\ndroplets we find a strong amplification of the pion field that oscillates in\ntime. This leads to a coherent production of pions with a particular isospin\nand so would have similar observable effects to a disoriented chiral condensate\nwhich various authors have suggested might be a signal of the chiral phase\ntransition. The mechanism for amplification of the pion field found here does\nnot rely on this phase transition and is better thought of as a \"pion laser\"\nwhich is driven by large oscillations of the $\\sigma$ field.\n","Comment: 12 TeX pages + 20 postscript figures, psfig style"]}]
