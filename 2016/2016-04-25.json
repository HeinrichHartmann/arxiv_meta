Selective photodissociation has a minimal effect on the ratio,\nwhile the chemical fractionation causes a factor of 2-3 decrease at\nintermediate cloud depths.

To this end, we adopt the recent reconstruction of\nthe diffuse $\\gamma$-ray sky from Fermi data by the D$^{3}$PO algorithm and the\nfact that more than 90\\% of its flux can be represented by only two spectral\ncomponents, resulting form the dense and dilute interstellar medium. Under\nthese presumptions, we confirm the reported DM annihilation-like signal in the\ninner Galaxy and derive upper limits for dark matter annihilation cross\nsections. We investigate whether the DM signal could be a residual of the\nsimplified modeling of astrophysical emission by inspecting the morphology of\nthe regions, which favor a dark matter component. The central galactic region\nfavors strongest for such a component with the expected spherically symmetric\nand radially declining profile. However, astrophysical structures, in\nparticular sky regions which seem to host most of the dilute interstellar\nmedium, obviously would benefit from a DM annihilation-like component as well.\nAlthough these regions do not drive the fit, they warn that a more detailed\nunderstanding of astrophysical $\\gamma$-ray emitting processes in the galactic\ncenter region are necessary before definite claims about a DM annihilation\nsignal can be made. The regions off the Galactic plane actually disfavor the\nbest fit DM annihilation cross section from the inner Galactic region unless\nthe radial decline of the Galactic DM density profile in the outer regions is\nsignificantly steeper than that usually assumed.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 11 figures, matches version published in JCAP"]}]

In this paper, we propose CT-Mapper, an unsupervised\nalgorithm that enables the mapping of mobile phone traces over a multimodal\ntransport network. One of the main strengths of CT-Mapper is its capability to\nmap noisy sparse cellular multimodal trajectories over a multilayer\ntransportation network where the layers have different physical properties and\nnot only to map trajectories associated with a single layer. Such a network is\nmodeled by a large multilayer graph in which the nodes correspond to\nmetro/train stations or road intersections and edges correspond to connections\nbetween them. The mapping problem is modeled by an unsupervised HMM where the\nobservations correspond to sparse user mobile trajectories and the hidden\nstates to the multilayer graph nodes. The HMM is unsupervised as the transition\nand emission probabilities are inferred using respectively the physical\ntransportation properties and the information on the spatial coverage of\nantenna base stations. To evaluate CT-Mapper we collected cellular traces with\ntheir corresponding GPS trajectories for a group of volunteer users in Paris\nand vicinity (France).

The wave resistance in the presence of shear current is\ncalculated for the first time, containing in general a non-zero lateral\ncomponent. While formally apparently a straightforward extension of existing\ndeep water theory, the introduction of finite water depth is physically\nnon-trivial, since the surface waves are now affected by a subtle interplay of\nthe effects of the current and the sea bed. This becomes particularly\npronounced when considering the phenomenon of critical velocity, the velocity\nat which transversely propagating waves become unable to keep up with the\nmoving source. The phenomenon is well known for shallow water, and was recently\nshown to exist also in deep water in the presence of a shear current\n[Ellingsen, J.~Fluid Mech.\\ {\\bf 742} R2 (2014)]. We derive the exact criterion\nfor criticality as a function of an intrinsic shear Froude number $S\\sqrt{b/g}$\n($S$ is uniform vorticity, $b$ size of source), the water depth, and the angle\nbetween the shear current and the ship's motion. Formulae for both the normal\nand lateral wave resistance force are derived, and we analyse its dependence on\nthe source velocity (or Froude number $Fr$) for different amounts of shear and\ndifferent directions of motion. The effect of the shear current is to increase\nwave resistance for upstream ship motion and decrease it for downstream motion.\nAlso the value of $Fr$ at which $R$ is maximal is lowered for upstream and\nincreased for downstream directions of ship motion. For oblique angles between\nship motion and current there is a lateral wave resistance component which can\namount to $10$-$20\\%$ of the normal wave resistance for side-on shear and\n$S\\sqrt{b/g}$ of order unity.

In the worst case the\nrun-time is $O(n\\log n \\log\\log n)$. The amount of space used by the algorithm\nin external memory is $O(n)$ bits.

We introduce Utilitarian Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problems\n(UDisCSP) where the utility of each state is estimated as the difference\nbetween the the expected rewards for agreements on assignments for shared\nvariables, and the expected cost of privacy loss. Therefore, a traditional\nDisCSP with privacy requirements is viewed as a planning problem. The actions\navailable to agents are: communication and local inference. Common\ndecentralized solvers are evaluated here from the point of view of their\ninterpretation as greedy planners. Further, we investigate some simple\nextensions where these solvers start taking into account the utility function.\nIn these extensions we assume that the planning problem is further restricting\nthe set of communication actions to only the communication primitives present\nin the corresponding solver protocols. The solvers obtained for the new type of\nproblems propose the action (communication/inference) to be performed in each\nsituation, defining thereby the policy.\n"]}]
