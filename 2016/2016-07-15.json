In this paper,\nan autonomous compressive spectrum sensing (ACSS) framework is presented that\nenables a CR to automatically choose the number of measurements while\nguaranteeing the wideband spectrum recovery with a small predictable recovery\nerror. This is realized by the proposed measurement infrastructure and the\nvalidation technique. The proposed ACSS can find a good spectral estimate with\nhigh confidence by using only a small testing subset in both noiseless and\nnoisy environments. Furthermore, a sparsity-aware spectral recovery algorithm\nis proposed to recover the wideband spectrum without requiring knowledge of the\ninstantaneous spectral sparsity level. Such an algorithm bridges the gap\nbetween CS theory and practical spectrum sensing. Simulation results show that\nACSS can not only recover the spectrum using an appropriate number of\nmeasurements, but can also considerably improve the spectral recovery\nperformance compared with existing CS approaches.

It allows a set of $(t+1)$ asynchronous\nsequential processes to wait-free simulate (i.e., despite the crash of up to\n$t$ of them) an arbitrary number $n$ of processes under the assumption that at\nmost $t$ of them may crash. The BG simulation shows that, in read/write\nsystems, the crucial parameter is not the number $n$ of processes, but the\nupper bound $t$ on the number of process crashes.\n  The paper extends the concept of BG simulation to asynchronous\nmessage-passing systems prone to Byzantine failures. Byzantine failures are the\nmost general type of failure: a faulty process can exhibit any arbitrary\nbehavior. Because of this, they are also the most difficult to analyze and to\nhandle algorithmically. The main contribution of the paper is a signature-free\nreduction of Byzantine failures to crash failures. Assuming $t<\\min(n',n/3)$,\nthe paper presents an algorithm that simulates a system of $n'$ processes where\nup to $t$ may crash, on top of a basic system of $n$ processes where up to $t$\nmay be Byzantine. While topological techniques have been used to relate the\ncomputability of Byzantine failure-prone systems to that of crash failure-prone\nones, this simulation is the first, to our knowledge, that establishes this\nrelation directly, in an algorithmic way.\n  In addition to extending the basic BG simulation to message-passing systems\nand failures more severe than process crashes, being modular and direct, this\nsimulation provides us with a deeper insight in the nature and understanding of\ncrash and Byzantine failures in the context of asynchronous message-passing\nsystems. Moreover, it also allows crash-tolerant algorithms, designed for\nasynchronous read/write systems, to be executed on top of asynchronous\nmessage-passing systems prone to Byzantine failures.\n"]}]

In this\npaper we present such a study covering large defects of different shape and\nalso vacancy-like defects and adatoms at the dynamical gap at $\\hbar\\Omega/2$\n($\\hbar\\Omega$ being the photon energy). Our results, based on analytical\ncalculations as well as numerics for full tight-binding models, show that the\nbound states are chiral and appear in a number which grows with the defect\nsize. Furthermore, while the bound states exist regardless the type of the\ndefect's edge termination (zigzag, armchair, mixed), the spectrum is strongly\ndependent on it. In the case of top adatoms, the bound states quasi-energies\ndepend on the adatoms energy. The appearance of such bound states might open\nthe door to the presence of topological effects on the bulk transport\nproperties of dirty graphene.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 14 figures"]}]

Modern interferometers are capable of\nproducing data at very high time and frequency resolution; practical limits on\nstorage and computation costs require that some form of data compression be\nimposed. The traditional form of compression is a simple averaging of the\nvisibilities over coarser time and frequency bins. This has an undesired side\neffect: the resulting averaged visibilities \"decorrelate\", and do so\ndifferently depending on the baseline length and averaging interval. This\ntranslates into a non-trivial signature in the image domain known as\n\"smearing\", which manifests itself as an attenuation in amplitude towards\noff-centre sources.

As some items might be substitutes,\nagents need to strategize in order to maximize their utilities. A number of\nresults indicate that high welfare can be achieved this way, giving bounds on\nthe welfare at equilibrium. Recently, however, criticism has been raised that\nequilibria are hard to compute and therefore unlikely to be attained.\n  In this paper, we take a different perspective. We study simple best-response\ndynamics. That is, agents are activated one after the other and each activated\nagent updates his strategy myopically to a best response against the other\nagents' current strategies. Often these dynamics may take exponentially long\nbefore they converge or they may not converge at all. However, as we show,\nconvergence is not even necessary for good welfare guarantees. Given that\nagents' bid updates are aggressive enough but not too aggressive, the game will\nremain in states of good welfare after each agent has updated his bid at least\nonce.\n  In more detail, we show that if agents have fractionally subadditive\nvaluations, natural dynamics reach and remain in a state that provides a $1/3$\napproximation to the optimal welfare after each agent has updated his bid at\nleast once. For subadditive valuations, we can guarantee a $\\Omega(1/\\log m)$\napproximation in case of $m$ items that applies after each agent has updated\nhis bid at least once and at any point after that.

This round trip is detrimental\nto performances but, worse, such a programming model prevents one from having\nricher queries, namely queries containing user-defined functions (that is\nfunctions defined by the programmer and used e.g. in the filter condition of a\nSQL query). While some databases also possess a \"server-side\" language (e.g.\nPL/SQL in Oracle database), its integration with the very-optimized query\nexecution engine is still minimal and queries containing (PL/SQL) user-defined\nfunctions remain notoriously inefficient. In this setting, we reviewed existing\nlanguage-integrated query frameworks, highlighting that existing database query\nlanguages (including SQL) share high-level querying primitives (e.g.,\nfiltering, joins, aggregation) that can be represented by operators, but differ\nwidely regarding the semantics of their expression language. In order to\nrepresent queries in an application language- and database-agnostic manner, we\ndesigned a small calculus, dubbed \"QIR\" for Query Intermediate Representation.\nQIR contains expressions, corresponding to a small extension of the pure\nlambda-calculus, and operators to represent usual querying primitives. In the\neffort to send efficient queries to the database, we abstracted the idea of\n\"good\" query representations in a measure on QIR terms. Then, we designed an\nevaluation strategy rewriting QIR query representations into \"better\" ones.\n"]}]

The post-blast rock size distribution\ncan significantly influence the efficiency of all the downstream mining and\ncomminution processes. Image analysis methods are one of the most common\nmethods used to measure rock fragment size distribution in mines regardless of\ncriticism for lack of accuracy to measure fine particles and other perceived\ndeficiencies. The current practice of collecting rock fragmentation data for\nimage analysis is highly manual and provides data with low temporal and spatial\nresolution. Using UAVs for collecting images of rock fragments can not only\nimprove the quality of the image data but also automate the data collection\nprocess. Ultimately, real-time acquisition of high temporal- and\nspatial-resolution data based on UAV technology will provide a broad range of\nopportunities for both improving blast design without interrupting the\nproduction process and reducing the cost of the human operator. This paper\npresents the results of a series of laboratory-scale rock fragment measurements\nusing a quadrotor UAV equipped with a camera. The goal of this work is to\nhighlight the benefits of aerial fragmentation analysis in terms of both\nprediction accuracy and time effort. A pile of rock fragments with different\nfragment sizes was placed in a lab that is equipped with a motion capture\ncamera system for precise UAV localization and control. Such an environment\npresents optimal conditions for UAV flight and thus, is well-suited for\nconducting proof-of-concept experiments before testing them in large-scale\nfield experiments. The pile was photographed by a camera attached to the UAV,\nand the particle size distribution curves were generated in almost real-time.\nThe pile was also manually photographed and the results of the manual method\nwere compared to the UAV method.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 12 figures, 6th International Conference on Computer\n  Applications in the Minerals Industries"]}]
