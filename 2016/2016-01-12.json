Our investigations significantly benefit from a\nnew structural \"compactness\" parameter of interval graphs and novel problem\nformulations using vertex-colored interval graphs. Our main contributions are:\n  1. We show a complexity dichotomy: restricted to graph classes closed under\ninduced subgraphs and disjoint unions, Independent Set is polynomial-time\nsolvable if both input interval graphs are cluster graphs, and is NP-hard\notherwise.\n  2. We chart the possibilities and limits of effective polynomial-time\npreprocessing (also known as kernelization).\n  3. We extend Halld\\'orsson and Karlsson (2006)'s fixed-parameter algorithm\nfor Independent Set on strip graphs parameterized by the structural parameter\n\"maximum number of live jobs\" to show that the problem (also known as Job\nInterval Selection) is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the parameter\nk and generalize their algorithm from strip graphs to 2-union graphs.\nPreliminary experiments with random data indicate that Job Interval Selection\nwith up to fifteen jobs and 5*10^5 intervals can be solved optimally in less\nthan five minutes.\n","Comment: This revision does not contain Theorem 7 of the first revision, whose\n  proof contained an error"]}]

The measured image in a real optical instrument is usually\nrepresented by the convolution of an ideal image with a Point Spread Function\n(PSF). Additionally, the image acquisition process is also contaminated by\nother sources of noise (read-out, photon-counting). The problem of estimating\nboth the PSF and a denoised image is called blind deconvolution and is\nill-posed.\n  Aims: We propose a blind deconvolution scheme that relies on image\nregularization. Contrarily to most methods presented in the literature, our\nmethod does not assume a parametric model of the PSF and can thus be applied to\nany telescope.\n  Methods: Our scheme uses a wavelet analysis prior model on the image and weak\nassumptions on the PSF. We use observations from a celestial transit, where the\nocculting body can be assumed to be a black disk. These constraints allow us to\nretain meaningful solutions for the filter and the image, eliminating trivial,\ntranslated and interchanged solutions.

However, these methods are\nknown to produce poor results on idealized test problems, particularly at late\ntimes, after the particle trajectories have crossed. To investigate this, we\nhave performed a series of one- and two-dimensional \"Zel'dovich Pancake\"\ncalculations using the popular Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method.

The first modification is to regularize the singular initial distribution\nfunction by introducing a small but finite artificial velocity dispersion. This\nprocess is analogous to artificial viscosity in compressible gas dynamics, and,\nas with artificial viscosity, the amount of regularization can be tailored so\nthat its effect outside of a well-defined region - in this case, the\nhigh-density caustics - is small. The second modification is the introduction\nof a particle remapping procedure that periodically re-expresses the dark\nmatter distribution function using a new set of particles. We describe a\nremapping algorithm that is third-order accurate and adaptive in phase space.\nThis procedure prevents the accumulation of numerical errors in integrating the\nparticle trajectories from growing large enough to significantly degrade the\nsolution. Once both of these changes are made, PIC converges at second order on\nthe Zel'dovich Pancake problem, even at late times, after many caustics have\nformed.

A discrete\nFourier transform (DFT) aided spatial basis expansion model (SBEM) is first\nintroduced to represent the uplink/downlink channels with much few parameter\ndimensions by exploiting angle reciprocity and the physical characteristics of\nthe uniform linear array (ULA). With SBEM, both uplink and downlink channel\nestimation of multiuser can be carried out with very few amount of training\nresources, which significantly reduces the training overhead and feedback cost.\nMeanwhile, the pilot contamination problem in the uplink raining is immediately\nrelieved by exploiting the spatial information of users. To enhance the\nspectral efficiency and to fully utilize the spatial resources, we also design\na greedy user scheduling scheme during the data transmission period. Compared\nto existing low-rank models, the newly proposed SBEM offers an alternative for\nchannel acquisition without need of channel statistics for both TDD and FDD\nsystems based on the angle reciprocity. Moreover, the proposed method can be\nefficiently deployed by the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Various numerical\nresults are provided to corroborate the proposed studies.\n"]}]

In these models, memories\nare stored in the plastic recurrent connections of neural populations in the\nform of \"attractor states\". The maximal information capacity for conventional\nabstract attractor networks with unconstrained connections is 2 bits/synapse.\nHowever, an unconstrained synapse has the capacity to store infinite amount of\nbits in a noiseless theoretical scenario: a capacity that conventional\nattractor networks cannot achieve. Here, I propose a hierarchical attractor\nnetwork that can achieve an ultra high information capacity. The network has\ntwo layers: a visible layer with $N_v$ neurons, and a hidden layer with $N_h$\nneurons. The visible-to-hidden connections are set at random and kept fixed\nduring the training phase, in which the memory patterns are stored as\nfixed-points of the network dynamics. The hidden-to-visible connections,\ninitially normally distributed, are learned via a local, online learning rule\ncalled the Three-Threshold Learning Rule and there is no within-layer\nconnections. The results of simulations suggested that the maximal information\ncapacity grows exponentially with the expansion ratio $N_h/N_v$. As a first\norder approximation to understand the mechanism providing the high capacity, I\nsimulated a naive mean-field approximation (nMFA) of the network. The\nexponential increase was captured by the nMFA, revealing that a key underlying\nfactor is the correlation between the hidden and the visible units.\nAdditionally, it was observed that, at maximal capacity, the degree of symmetry\nof the connectivity between the hidden and the visible neurons increases with\nthe expansion ratio. These results highlight the role of hierarchical\narchitecture in remarkably increasing the performance of information storage in\nattractor networks.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 1 figure, minor revision of the text for clarification,\n  figure updated for including more data, unchanged results"]}]

The scattering amplitude for a small\nimpedance particle is shown to be proportional to $a^{2-\\kappa}$, where\n$\\kappa\\in [0,1)$ is a parameter which can be chosen by an experimenter as\nhe/she wants.

Much of the existing literature in the learning community focuses\non processes possessing some form of computationally tractable conjugacy as is\nthe case for the beta and gamma processes (and, via normalization, the\nDirichlet process). For these processes, proofs of conjugacy and requisite\nderivation of explicit computational formulae for posterior density parameters\nare idiosyncratic to the stochastic process in question.

Due to extremely short time and length scales,\nthe measurement and manipulation of electron thermalization in nanoscale\ndevices remains challenging even with the most advanced ultrafast laser\ntechniques. Here, we overcome this challenge by leveraging the atomic thinness\nof two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials in order to introduce a highly\ntunable electron transfer pathway that directly competes with electron\nthermalization. We realize this scheme in a graphene-boron nitride-graphene\n(G-BN-G) vdW heterostructure, through which optically excited carriers are\ntransported from one graphene layer to the other. By applying an interlayer\nbias voltage or varying the excitation photon energy, interlayer carrier\ntransport can be controlled to occur faster or slower than the intralayer\nscattering events, thus effectively tuning the electron thermalization pathways\nin graphene.

We prove the existence of two disease-free\nequilibrium points and the possible existence of up to two endemic equilibrium\npoints (where the disease persists in the population). We show the existence of\na transcritical bifurcation and a possible saddle-node bifurcation and\nexplicitly derive threshold conditions for both, including defining the basic\nreproduction number, R 0 , which determines whether the disease can persist in\nthe population or not. The epidemiological consequence of saddle-node\nbifurcation (backward bifurcation) is that the classical requirement of having\nthe reproduction number less than unity, while necessary, is no longer\nsufficient for disease elimination from the population. It is further shown\nthat in the absence of disease--induced death, the model does not exhibit this\nphenomenon. We perform the sensitivity analysis to determine the model\nrobustness to parameter values. That is to help us to know the parameters that\nare most influential in determining disease dynamics. The model is extended by\nreformulating the model as an optimal control problem, with the use of five\ntime dependent controls, to assess the impact of vaccination combined with\ntreatment, individual protection and vector control strategies (killing adult\nvectors, reduction of eggs and larvae). By using optimal control theory, we\nestablish optimal conditions under which the disease can be eradicated and we\nexamine the impact of a possible combined control tools on the disease\ntransmission. The Pontryagin's maximum principle is used to characterize the\noptimal control.

They\nare based on partitioning the observed data into regions, each of which is\nmodeled with a simple submodel. The success of this approach highly depends on\nthe quality of the partition, as too large a region could lead to a non-simple\nsubmodel, while too small a region could inflate estimation variance. This\npaper proposes an automatic procedure for choosing the partition (i.e., the\nnumber of regions and the boundaries between regions) as well as the submodels\nfor the regions. It is shown that, under the assumption of the existence of a\ntrue partition, the proposed partition estimator is statistically consistent.\nThe methodology is demonstrated for both regression and classification\nproblems.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 2 figures"]}]
