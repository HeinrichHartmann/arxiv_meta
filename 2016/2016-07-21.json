It was shown that the Dirac magnon\nHamiltonian preserves time-reversal symmetry defined with the sublattice pseudo\nspins and the Dirac points are robust against magnon-magnon interactions.

However, in\ncontrast to electronic spin current where dissipation can be very large due to\nOhmic heating, noninteracting topological magnons can propagate for long time\nwithout dissipation as magnons are uncharged particles. We observe the same\nmagnon edge states for the XY model on the honeycomb lattice. Remarkably, in\nthis case the model maps to interacting hardcore bosons on the honeycomb\nlattice.

Our solution builds upon the Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)\nframework of Indyk and Motwani, which represents the asymptotically best\nsolutions to near neighbor problems in high dimensions. While traditional LSH\ndata structures have several parameters whose optimal values depend on the\ndistance distribution from $q$ to the points of $S$, our data structure is\nparameter-free, except for the space usage, which is configurable by the user.\nNevertheless, its expected query time basically matches that of an LSH data\nstructure whose parameters have been *optimally chosen for the data and query*\nin question under the given space constraints. In particular, our data\nstructure provides a smooth trade-off between hard queries (typically addressed\nby standard LSH) and easy queries such as those where the number of points to\nreport is a constant fraction of $S$, or where almost all points in $S$ are far\naway from the query point. In contrast, known data structures fix LSH\nparameters based on certain parameters of the input alone.\n  The algorithm has expected query time bounded by $O(t (n/t)^\\rho)$, where $t$\nis the number of points to report and $\\rho\\in (0,1)$ depends on the data\ndistribution and the strength of the LSH family used. We further present a\nparameter-free way of using multi-probing, for LSH families that support it,\nand show that for many such families this approach allows us to get expected\nquery time close to $O(n^\\rho+t)$, which is the best we can hope to achieve\nusing LSH.

For many data distributions where the intrinsic dimensionality of the\npoint set close to $q$ is low, we can give improved upper bounds on the\nexpected query time.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 5 figures, due to the limitation \"The abstract field cannot\n  be longer than 1,920 characters\", the abstract appearing here is slightly\n  shorter than that in the PDF file"]}]

The model with contextual attention outperforms others including\nthe state-of-the-art seq2seq models on perplexity test.

A\nspecific case the paper considers is the strategy of players in public goods\ngames (as common in economics) across multiple consecutive games. Initial\nclassification starts from expert definitions specifying class allocation for\nplayers based on aggregated attributes of the temporal data. Based on these\ninitial classifications, the optimisation process tries to find an improved\nclassifier which produces the best possible compact classes of objects\n(players) for every time point in the temporal data.
