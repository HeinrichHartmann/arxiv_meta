That is to say, we do not have a method or successful\ncategorization to optimally solve every one of its approximately $7.401 \\times\n10^{45}$ possible configurations. Rubik's Cube, Rubik's Revenge's predecessor\n(3x3x3), with its approximately $4.33 \\times 10^{19}$ possible configurations,\nhas only recently been completely solved by Rokicki et. al, further finding\nthat any configuration requires no more than 20 moves. With the sheer dimension\nof Rubik's Revenge and its total configuration space, a brute-force method of\nfinding all optimal solutions would be in vain. Similar to the methods used by\nRokicki et. al on Rubik's Cube, in this paper we develop a method for solving\narbitrary configurations of Rubik's Revenge in phases, using a combination of a\npowerful algorithm known as IDA* and a useful definition of distance in the\ncube space. While time-series results were not successfully gathered, it will\nbe shown that this method far outweighs current human-solving methods and can\nbe used to determine loose upper bounds for the cube space. Discussion will\nsuggest that this method can also be applied to other puzzles with the proper\ntransformations.\n"]}]
