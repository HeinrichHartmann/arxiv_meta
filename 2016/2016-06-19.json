They can therefore be realized as a\nsymmetric function that can be evaluated at a set of variables and form a basis\nof the symmetric functions. This basis of the symmetric functions is of\nnon-homogeneous degree and the (outer) product structure coefficients are the\nstable Kronecker coefficients.\n  We introduce the irreducible character basis by defining it in terms of the\ninduced trivial characters of the symmetric group which also form a basis of\nthe symmetric functions. The irreducible character basis is closely related to\ncharacter polynomials and we obtain some of the change of basis coefficients by\nmaking this connection explicit. Other change of basis coefficients come from a\nrepresentation theoretic connection with the partition algebra, and still\nothers are derived by developing combinatorial expressions.\n  This document is an extended abstract which can be used as a review reference\nso that this basis can be implemented in Sage.
