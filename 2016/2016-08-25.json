For\nthe VDW equation of state in the GCE the particle number fluctuations are\ncalculated for the whole phase diagram, both outside and inside the liquid-gas\nmixed phase region.

Theory and Methods: ESPIRiT is a new\nframework for calibration of the coil sensitivities and reconstruction in\nparallel Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Applying ESPIRiT to a combined set\nof physical and virtual conjugate coils (VCC-ESPIRiT) implicitly exploits\nconjugate symmetry in k-space similar to VCC-GRAPPA. Based on this method, a\nnew post-processing step is proposed for the explicit computation of coil\nsensitivities that include the absolute phase of the image. The accuracy of the\ncomputed maps is directly validated using a test based on projection onto fully\nsampled coil images and also indirectly in phase-constrained parallel-imaging\nreconstructions. Results: The proposed method can estimate accurate\nsensitivities which include low-resolution image phase. In case of\nhigh-frequency phase variations VCC-ESPIRiT yields an additional set of maps\nthat indicates the existence of a high-frequency phase component. Taking this\nadditional set of maps into account can improve the robustness of\nphase-constrained parallel imaging.

Statistical emulators are\ncomputationally cheap approximations of such simulators.

However, when the input space is of high\ndimension, the construction of an emulator can become prohibitively expensive.\nIn this paper, we introduce a joint framework merging emulation with dimension\nreduction in order to overcome this hurdle. The gradient-based kernel dimension\nreduction technique is chosen due to its ability to drastically decrease\ndimensionality with little loss in information. The Gaussian process emulation\ntechnique is combined with this dimension reduction approach.

Our dimension-reduced emulation enables us to compute\nthe impact of these uncertainties on resulting possible tsunami wave heights\nnear-shore and on-shore.

This is a ubiquitous problem in all domains that use network\nanalysis, from social networks to hyper-linked web networks to biological\nnetworks. Consequently, an important question in analyzing networks is to\nunderstand how increasing the noise level (i.e. percentage of missing edges)\naffects different network parameters.\n  In this paper we evaluate the effect of noise on community scoring and\ncentrality-based parameters with respect to two different aspects of network\nanalysis: (i) sensitivity, that is how the parameter value changes as edges are\nremoved and (ii) reliability in the context of message spreading, that is how\nthe time taken to broadcast a message changes as edges are removed.\n  Our experiments on synthetic and real-world networks and three different\nnoise models demonstrate that for both the aspects over all networks and all\nnoise models, permanence qualifies as the most effective metric. For the\nsensitivity experiments closeness centrality is a close second. For the message\nspreading experiments, closeness and betweenness centrality based initiator\nselection closely competes with permanence. This is because permanence has a\ndual characteristic where the cumulative permanence over all vertices is\nsensitive to noise but the ids of the top-rank vertices, which are used to find\nseeds during message spreading remain relatively stable under noise.\n","Comment: Accepted in proceedings of ASONAM 2016"]}]

The main\nobservational result is that sources of HXR pulsations in all flares are not\nstationary, they demonstrate apparent displacements from pulsation to\npulsation. The flares can be subdivided into two groups depending on character\nof dynamics of HXR sources. The group-1 consists of 16 flares (55%) with\nsystematic dynamics of HXR sources from pulsation to pulsation with respect to\na magnetic polarity inversion line (MPIL), which has simple extended trace on\nthe photosphere. The group-2 consists of 13 flares (45%) with more chaotic\ndisplacements of HXR sources with respect to an MPIL having more complicated\nstructure. Based on the observations we conclude that the mechanism of flare\nHXR pulsations is related to successive triggering of energy release in\ndifferent magnetic loops. Group-1 flare regions consist of loops stacked into\nmagnetic arcades extended along MPILs. Group-2 flare regions have more\ncomplicated magnetic structures and loops are arranged more chaotically. We\nalso found that at least 14 (88%) group-1 flares and 11 (85%) group-2 flares\nare accompanied by coronal mass ejections, i.e. the majority of flares studied\nare eruptive events. This gives an indication that eruptive processes play\nimportant role in generation of HXR pulsations. We suggest that an erupting\nflux rope can act as a trigger of energy release. Its successive interaction\nwith different loops can lead to apparent motion of HXR sources and to a series\nof HXR pulsations.\n","Comment: 48 pages, 18 figures, 4 tables, 2 appendices"]}]

In the estimation we\nassume that the emission may originate in processes similar to those observed\nin the Jupiter system. The frequency of the radio emission that is produced in\nthis system depends mostly on the magnetic field strength. Jupiter's magnetic\nfield ($\\sim 9$ G on average) allows for radiation from kHz frequencies up to\n40 MHz. This is well below the frequency range of VLBI. However, it was\ndemonstrated that the magnetic field strength in massive and young object may\nbe up to two orders of magnitude higher than for Jupiter, which is especially\nrelevant for planets around short-lived A type stars. This should extend the\nrange of the emission up to GHz frequencies. We calculated expected flux\ndensities of radio emission for a variety of hypothetical young planetary\nsystems. We analysed two different emission scenarios, and found that the\nradiation induced by moons (process similar to Jupiter-Io interactions) appears\nto be less efficient than the emission generated by a stellar wind on a\nplanetary magnetosphere.

To answer this question, two impact risk\ndistributions that control for impact effect modelling were generated and\ncompared. The Asteroid Risk Mitigation Optimization and Research (ARMOR) tool,\nin conjunction with the freely available software OrbFit, was used to project\nthe impact probabilities of listed asteroids with a minimum diameter of 30 m\nonto the surface of the Earth representing a random sample (15% of all objects)\nof the hazard list.

In a flat Universe, CDM models normalized to\ncluster abundances produce rms temperature anisotropies of 0.8--2.4 $\\mu$K on\narcminute angular scales for a constant ionization fraction of unity, whereas\nan ionization fraction of 0.2 yields rms anisotropies of 0.3--0.8 $\\mu$K. In an\nopen and/or high-baryon-density Universe, the level of anisotropy is somewhat\nhigher. The signal in some of these models may be detectable with planned\ninterferometry experiments. The damping of the acoustic peaks in the\nprimary-anisotropy spectrum at degree angular scales depends primarily on the\noptical depth and only secondarily on the epoch of reionization. On the other\nhand, the amplitude of Ostriker-Vishniac anisotropies depends sensitively on\nthe epoch of reionization. Therefore, when combined with the estimate of the\nreionization optical depth provided by maps of degree-scale anisotropies, the\nOstriker-Vishniac effect can provide a unique probe of the epoch of\nreionization.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 2 figures, Revtex.

Such an effect, if real, would\ndestabilize a neutron star. To address this issue we have studied the related\nproblem of a massless neutrino field in the presence of an external, static\nelectroweak potential of finite range. To be precise, we have computed to one\nloop the exact vacuum energy for the case of a spherical square well potential\nof depth alpha and radius R. For small wells, the vacuum energy is reliably\ndetermined by a perturbative expansion in the external potential. For large\nwells, however, the perturbative expansion breaks down. A manifestation of this\nbreakdown is that the vacuum carries a non-zero neutrino charge. The energy and\nneutrino charge of the ground state are, to a good approximation for large\nwells, those of a neutrino condensate with chemical potential mu=alpha. Our\nresults demonstrate explicitly that long-range forces due to the exchange of\nmassless neutrinos do not threaten the stability of neutron stars.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 7 figures, revtex; several typos corrected; a few\n  references added; title changed slightly; includes a \"note added in proof\";\n  version to appear in Phys.

It has\nalready been shown that in an infinite-size star the total energy due to\nneutrino exchange vanishes exactly. The opposite claim that massless neutrino\nexchange would produce a huge energy is due to an improper summation of an\ninfrared-divergent quantity.

This formulation is realized by combining the coordinate\nspace approach based on light-front current algebra techniques and the momentum\nspace approach based on Fock space expansion methods in the Hamiltonian\nformalism of light-front field theory. In this work we show how a perturbative\nanalysis in the light-front Hamiltonian formalism leads to the factorization\nscheme we have proposed recently. The analysis also shows that the scaling\nviolations due to perturbative QCD corrections can be rather easily addressed\nin this framework by simply replacing the hadron target by dressed parton\ntarget and then carrying out a systematic expansion in the coupling constant\n$\\alpha_s$ based on the perturbative QCD expansion of the dressed parton\ntarget.

The\nfocus is to compare the exact evolution of the distribution function with\ndifferent approximations to the relaxational dynamics: Boltzmann, non-Markovian\nand Markovian quantum kinetics. The time evolution of the distribution function\nis evaluated exactly using two methods: time evolution of an initially prepared\ndensity matrix and by solving the Heisenberg equations of motion. There are two\ndifferent cases that are studied in detail: i) no stable particle states below\nthreshold of the bath and a quasiparticle resonance above it and ii) a stable\ndiscrete exact `particle' state below threshold. For the case of quasiparticles\nin the continuum (resonances) the exact quasiparticle distribution\nasymptotically tends to a statistical equilibrium distribution that differs\nfrom a simple Bose-Einstein form as a result of off-shell processes. In the\ncase ii), the distribution of particles does not thermalize with the bath. We\nstudy the kinetics of thermalization and relaxation by deriving a non-Markovian\nquantum kinetic equation which resums the perturbative series and includes\noff-shell effects. A Markovian approximation that includes off-shell\ncontributions and the usual Boltzmann equation are obtained from the quantum\nkinetic equation in the limit of wide separation of time scales upon different\ncoarse-graining assumptions.

Neglecting QCD\nshort-distance corrections, this implies that there are only three form factors\ndescribing all the pseudoscalar to pseudoscalar or vector weak current matrix\nelements.

Decoherence is\npossible even if there is only one oscillator in the environment. The\ninformation count of the histories and records in the environment add up\naccording to our conjecture.
