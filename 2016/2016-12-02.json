This lack of consensus results partly because there might exist\ndistinct types of modules in a single directed network, whereas most previous\nstudies focused on an independent criterion for modules. To address this issue,\nwe propose a generic notion of the so-called truss structures in directed\nnetworks. Our definition of truss is able to extract two distinct types of\ntrusses, named the cycle truss and the flow truss, from a unified framework. By\napplying the method for finding trusses to empirical networks obtained from a\nwide range of research fields, we find that most real networks contain both\ncycle and flow trusses. In addition, the abundance of (and the overlap between)\nthe two types of trusses may be useful to characterize module structures in a\nwide variety of empirical networks.

In this paper we present full results from a\nsearch for binary black hole merger signals with total masses up to $100\nM_\\odot$ and detailed implications from our observations of these systems. Our\nsearch, based on general-relativistic models of gravitational wave signals from\nbinary black hole systems, unambiguously identified two signals, GW150914 and\nGW151226, with a significance of greater than $5\\sigma$ over the observing\nperiod. It also identified a third possible signal, LVT151012, with\nsubstantially lower significance, and with an 87% probability of being of\nastrophysical origin. We provide detailed estimates of the parameters of the\nobserved systems. Both GW150914 and GW151226 provide an unprecedented\nopportunity to study the two-body motion of a compact-object binary in the\nlarge velocity, highly nonlinear regime. We do not observe any deviations from\ngeneral relativity, and place improved empirical bounds on several high-order\npost-Newtonian coefficients. From our observations we infer stellar-mass binary\nblack hole merger rates lying in the range $9-240 \\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\n\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. These observations are beginning to inform astrophysical\npredictions of binary black hole formation rates, and indicate that future\nobserving runs of the Advanced detector network will yield many more\ngravitational wave detections.\n","Comment: 36 pages + 4 appendices, 14 figures; updated author list and\n  references, final journal version"]}]

This low-dim subspace structure can be exploited\nto improve the system performance. An effective architecture is a hybrid\ndigital-analog (HDA) one in which the multiuser MIMO precoder (in the downlink)\nor the detector (in the uplink) is split into the product of two matrices, one\nimplemented in the analog domain and depending only on the channel subspace\ninformation, and the other in the baseband domain operating on an effective\nchannel of much lower dimension.

However, because the number of amino acids in single domain\nproteins is not significantly greater than about two hundred, it has not been\nresolved if the unfolded states of proteins are compact under conditions that\nfavor the folded states - a problem at the heart of how proteins fold. By\nadopting a theory used to derive polymer-scaling laws, we find that the\npropensity for the unfolded state of a protein to be compact is universal and\nis encoded in the contact map of the folded state. Remarkably, analysis of over\n2000 proteins shows that proteins rich in $\\beta$-sheets have greater tendency\nto be compact than $\\alpha$-helical proteins. The theory provides insights into\nthe reasons for the small size of single domain proteins and the physical basis\nfor the origin of multi-domain proteins. Application to non-coding RNA\nmolecules show that they have evolved to collapse sharing similarities to\n$\\beta$-sheet proteins. An implication of our theory is that the evolution of\nnatural foldable sequences is guided by the requirement that for efficient\nfolding they should populate minimum energy compact states under folding\nconditions. This concept also supports the compaction selection hypothesis used\nto rationalize the unusually condensed states of viral RNA molecules.\n","Comment: 8 figures"]}]

Despite their promising\nresults on major structure regions such as edges and lines, they still suffer\nfrom limited performance on texture regions that consist of very complex and\nfine patterns. This is because, during the acquisition of a low-resolution (LR)\nimage via down-sampling, these regions lose most of the high frequency\ninformation necessary to represent the texture details. In this paper, we\npresent a novel texture enhancement framework for SISR to effectively improve\nthe spatial resolution in the texture regions as well as edges and lines. We\ncall our method, high-resolution (HR) style transfer algorithm. Our framework\nconsists of three steps: (i) generate an initial HR image from an interpolated\nLR image via an SISR algorithm, (ii) generate an HR style image from the\ninitial HR image via down-scaling and tiling, and (iii) combine the HR style\nimage with the initial HR image via a customized style transfer algorithm.\nHere, the HR style image is obtained by down-scaling the initial HR image and\nthen repetitively tiling it into an image of the same size as the HR image.\nThis down-scaling and tiling process comes from the idea that texture regions\nare often composed of small regions that similar in appearance albeit sometimes\ndifferent in scale. This process creates an HR style image that is rich in\ndetails, which can be used to restore high-frequency texture details back into\nthe initial HR image via the style transfer algorithm.

In our formulation, the Stora-Zumino chain of\nthe anomaly descent equations, starting from the axial $U(1)$ anomaly in\nsix-dimensions to the gauge anomaly in four-dimensions, is naturally embedded.\nMoreover, a similar inflow of the global anomalies is found. The anomaly free\ncondition is equivalent to requiring that the axial $U(1)$ anomaly and the\nparity anomaly are canceled among the six-dimensional Dirac fermions. Putting\nthe gauge field at the four- dimensional junction and extending it to the bulk\nusing the Yang-Mills gradient flow, as recently proposed by Grabowska and\nKaplan, we define the four-dimensional path integral of the target chiral gauge\ntheory.\n","Comment: 14pages, 2figures, Proceedings of the 34th annual International\n  Symposium on Lattice Field Theory.

Furthermore, based upon the three-step estimators, we develop a\ntwo-stage penalty procedure to identify pure additive terms and\nvarying-coefficient terms in varying-coefficient additive model. As expected,\nwe demonstrate that the proposed identification procedure is consistent, and\nthe penalized estimators achieve the same $L_{2}$ rate of convergence as the\npolynomial spline estimators. Simulation studies are presented to illustrate\nthe finite sample performance of the proposed three-step spline estimation\nmethod and two-stage model selection procedure.\n","Comment: 36 pages, 5 figures"]}]

On CPU, the dot product operation between two bit vectors can\nbe reduced to bitwise operations and popcounts, which can offer much higher\nthroughput than 32-bit multiplications and additions.\n  To validate the effectiveness of BFCN, we conduct experiments on the PASCAL\nVOC 2012 semantic segmentation task and Cityscapes. Our BFCN with 1-bit weights\nand 2-bit activations, which runs 7.8x faster on CPU or requires less than 1\\%\nresources on FPGA, can achieve comparable performance as the 32-bit\ncounterpart.\n"]}]

We show that the information content\nof the large time steady state is inherently connected to the presence of\nballistically moving localised excitations. When such excitations are present,\nthe system retains memory of initial correlations up to infinite times, thus\nevading decoherence. We demonstrate this connection in the context of the\nLuttinger model, the simplest quantum hydrodynamic model, and in the quantum\nKdV equation. In the standard Luttinger model, memory of all initial\ncorrelations is preserved throughout the time evolution up to infinitely large\ntimes, as a result of the purely ballistic dynamics. However nonlinear\ndispersion or interactions, when separately present, lead to spreading and\ndelocalisation that suppress the above effect by eliminating the memory of\nnon-Gaussian correlations. We show that, for any initial state that satisfies\nsufficient clustering of correlations, the steady state is Gaussian in terms of\nthe bosonised or fermionised fields respectively. On the other hand, when\ndispersion and interaction are simultaneously present, a semiclassical\napproximation suggests that localisation is restored as the two effects\ncompensate each other and solitary waves are formed.
