However, it creates\nenormous confusion and frustration, particularly in the context of geographic\ninformation science, because of scale-related issues such as image resolution,\nand the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). This paper argues that the\nconfusion and frustration mainly arise from Euclidean geometric thinking, with\nwhich locations, directions, and sizes are considered absolute, and it is time\nto reverse this conventional thinking. Hence, we review fractal geometry,\ntogether with its underlying way of thinking, and compare it to Euclidean\ngeometry. Under the paradigm of Euclidean geometry, everything is measurable,\nno matter how big or small. However, geographic features, due to their fractal\nnature, are essentially unmeasurable or their sizes depend on scale. For\nexample, the length of a coastline, the area of a lake, and the slope of a\ntopographic surface are all scale-dependent. Seen from the perspective of\nfractal geometry, many scale issues, such as the MAUP, are inevitable. They\nappear unsolvable, but can be dealt with. To effectively deal with\nscale-related issues, we introduce topological and scaling analyses based on\nstreet-related concepts such as natural streets, street blocks, and natural\ncities. We further contend that spatial heterogeneity, or the fractal nature of\ngeographic features, is the first and foremost effect of two spatial\nproperties, because it is general and universal across all scales.\n  Keywords: Scaling, spatial heterogeneity, conundrum of length, MAUP,\ntopological analysis\n","Comment: 12 pages, 5 figures, and one table"]}]

However, they are not so clear as coseismic TEC anomalies, and their\nanalysis methods have some problems for practical earthquake prediction. One\nfactor making it difficult to detect TEC anomalies is large noises in TEC data.\nNon-negligible TEC disturbances are caused by many natural mechanisms. To\novercome this difficulty, we propose correlation analyses between one GNSS\nstation and GNSS stations surrounding it. First, we model TEC time series over\na few hours using polynomial functions of time. Second, we calculate prediction\nerrors as the departure of the TEC time series from the models over time scale\nof a few minutes, and define it as the TEC anomaly. Third, we calculate the\ncorrelation between anomaly of one GNSS station and those at the surrounding\nstations. Although such a correlation method has long been used for radio\ncommunications, in particular for spread spectrum communications and very long\nbaseline interferometry (VLBI) to increase SNR (signal to noise ratio), it has\nnot been widely applied for TEC analyses.

Separation between normal mass hierarchy (NH) and\ninverted mass hierarchy (IH) CP trajectory ellipses in the P-P^T plane seems to\nbe very promising in order to investigate mass hierarchy. Illustration of\nseparation between two hierarchy ellipses in the E-L plane is very helping to\ncover all the desired base lines and beam energies and also to analyze benefits\nand drawbacks at single place. If we know the mass hierarchy, then from the\nlarge sizes of CP trajectory ellipse which is possible at appropriately long\nbase line (L) and at specific value of beam energy (E), it becomes possible to\ninvestigate at-least narrow ranges of CP/T-violating phase \\delta^{CP}. The\nPossibility of more than one set of (\\theta_{13}; \\delta^{CP}) parameters to\ncorrespond to any chosen coordinate in P-P^T plane, known as parameter\ndegeneracy, may hinder exact determination of mass hierarchy as well as\n\\delta^{CP} value. To circumvent this degeneracy in the (\\theta_{13};\n\\delta^{CP}) parameter space, in case of opposite sign solutions corresponding\nto NH and IH case points toward the need of sufficiently long base lines, so as\nto separate opposite hierarchy ellipses to observable separation, and in case\nof same sign solutions corresponding to either NH or IH, we need to choose an\nexperimental configuration with L = 2,535 Km, E = 5 GeV for n=1 scenario.\n","Comment: 16 pages,7 figures"]}]

We assume that there are n stations and that at\nmost k<= n stations are active at the same time, i.e, are willing to transmit a\nmessage. If in a certain instant at most d<=k active stations transmit to the\nchannel then their messages are successfully transmitted, whereas if more than\nd active stations transmit simultaneously then their messages are lost. In this\nlatter case we say that a conflict occurs. The present paper investigates\nnon-adaptive conflict resolution algorithms working under the assumption that\nactive stations receive a feedback from the channel that informs them on\nwhether their messages have been successfully transmitted. If a station becomes\naware that its message has been correctly sent over the channel then it becomes\nimmediately inactive. The measure to optimize is the number of time slots\nneeded to solve conflicts among all active stations. The fundamental question\nis whether this measure decreases linearly with the number d of messages that\ncan be simultaneously transmitted with success. We give a positive answer to\nthis question by providing a conflict resolution algorithm that uses a 1/d\nratio of the number of time slots used by the optimal conflict resolution\nalgorithm for the case d=1. Moreover, we derive a lower bound on the number of\ntime slots needed to solve conflicts non-adaptively which is within a log (k/d)\nfactor from the upper bound.

In classical group testing the goal is to\nfind all defectives by using as few tests as possible. We consider a variant of\nclassical group testing in which one is concerned not only with minimizing the\ntotal number of tests but aims also at reducing the number of tests involving\ndefective elements. The rationale behind this search model is that in many\npractical applications the devices used for the tests are subject to\ndeterioration due to exposure to or interaction with the defective elements.

For\nall three considered scenarios, we derive upper and lower bounds on the number\nof \"yes\" responses that must be admitted by any strategy performing at most a\ncertain number t of tests.

The Bass diffusion\nmodel has been widely used to model the temporal evolution of adoption in such\nsocial systems. In the model, the likelihood of a new adoption is proportional\nto the number of previous adopters, implicitly assuming a global (or\nhomogeneous) interaction among all individuals in the network. Such global\ninteractions do not exist in many large social networks, however. Instead,\nindividuals typically interact with a small part of the larger population. To\nquantify the growth rate (or equivalently the adoption timing) in networks with\nlimited interactions, we study a stochastic adoption process where the\nlikelihood that each individual adopts is proportional to the number of\nadopters among the small group of persons he/she interacts with (and not the\nentire population of adopters).

When\nthe degree $k$ is bounded, we show the adoption curve differs significantly\nfrom the one corresponds to the Bass diffusion model.
