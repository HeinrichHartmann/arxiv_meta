Various other experimental\nresults seem to point in the same direction: For instance, localized wavelet-\ntype solutions to Maxwell equations have been found, both theoretically and\nexperimentally, that travel with superluminal speed. [Even muonic and\nelectronic neutrinos [it has been proposed] might be \"tachyons\", since their\nsquare mass appears to be negative]. With regard to the first-mentioned\nexperiments, it was recently claimed by Guenter Nimtz that those results with\nevanescent waves (or tunneling photons) imply superluminal signal and impulse\ntransmission, and therefore violate Einstein causality. In this note we want to\nstress that, on the contrary, all such results do not place relativistic\ncausality in jeopardy, even if they referred to actual tachyonic motions: In\nfact, Special Relativity can cope even with superluminal objects and waves. For\ninstance, it is possible (at least in microphysics) to solve also the known\ncausal paradoxes, devised for faster than light motion, although this is not\nwidely recognized yet. Here we show, in detail and rigorously, how to solve the\noldest causal paradox, originally proposed by Tolman, which is the kernel of\nmany further tachyon paradoxes (like J.Bell's, F.A.E.Pirani's, J.D.Edmonds' and\nothers'). The key to the solution is a careful application of tachyon\nmechanics, as it unambiguously follows from special relativity. At Last, in one\nof the two Appendices, we propose how to evaluate the group-velocity in the\ncase of evanescent waves.

Due to the common\nassumption that images are typically governed by anisotropic features,\ndirectional representation systems have often been utilized. One prominent\nexample of this class are shearlets, which have the additional benefitallowing\nfaithful implementations. Numerical results show that shearlets significantly\noutperform wavelets in inpainting tasks. One of those software packages,\nwww.shearlab.org, even offers the flexibility of usingdifferent parameter for\neach scale, which is not yet covered by shearlet theory.\n  In this paper, we first introduce universal shearlet systems which are\nassociated with an arbitrary scaling sequence, thereby modeling the previously\nmentioned flexibility. In addition, this novel construction allows for a smooth\ntransition between wavelets and shearlets and therefore enables us to analyze\nthem in a uniform fashion. For a large class of such scaling sequences, we\nfirst prove that the associated universal shearlet systems form band-limited\nParseval frames for $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^2)$ consisting of Schwartz functions.\nSecondly, we analyze the performance for inpainting of this class of universal\nshearlet systems within a distributional model situation using an\n$\\ell^1$-analysis minimization algorithm for reconstruction. Our main result in\nthis part states that, provided the scaling sequence is comparable to the size\nof the (scale-dependent) gap, nearly-perfect inpainting is achieved at\nsufficiently fine scales.\n"]}]

We\nuse analytic arguments and numerical calculations, and apply them to study the\nevolution of a stellar disk (similar to that observed in the Galactic center;\nGC), both on the short (few Myr) and longer (100 Myr) evolutionary timescales.\nWe find the dominant processes affecting the disk evolution are two-body\nrelaxation and mass segregation where as binary heating have only a little\ncontribution. Massive stars play a dominant role in kinematically heating low\nmass stars, and driving them to high eccentricities/inclinations. Multi-mass\nmodels with realistic mass-functions for the disk stars show the disk structure\nto be mass stratified, with the most massive stars residing in thinner\nstructures. Stellar evolution plays an important role in decreasing the number\nof massive stars with time, thereby leading to slower relaxation, where the\nremnant compact objects of these stars are excited to higher\neccentricities/inclinations. At these later evolutionary stages dynamical\nheating by the nuclear cluster plays a progressively more important role.

When the number of parameters $p$ is of the same order as the sample\nsize $n$, $p \\approx n$, an efficiency pattern different from the one of Huber\nwas recently established. In this work, we consider the effects of model\nselection on the estimation efficiency of penalized methods.

The latter is modeled based on the assumption that 3N SRCs\nare a product of two sequential short range NN interactions. This approach\nallowed us to express the 3N SRC part of the nuclear spectral function as a\nconvolution of two NN SRCs. Thus the knowledge of 2N SRCs allows us to model\nboth two- and three-nucleon SRC contributions to the spectral function. The\nderivations of the spectral functions are based on the two theoretical\nframeworks in evaluating covariant Feynman diagrams: In the first, referred as\nvirtual nucleon approximation, we reduce Feynman diagrams to the time ordered\nnoncovariant diagrams by evaluating nucleon spectators in the SRC at their\npositive energy poles, neglecting explicitly the contribution from vacuum\ndiagrams. In the second approach, referred as light-front approximation, we\nformulate the boost invariant nuclear spectral function in the light-front\nreference frame in which case the vacuum diagrams are generally suppressed and\nthe bound nucleon is described by its light-cone variables such as momentum\nfraction, transverse momentum and invariant mass.\n","Comment: 34 pages and 3 figures"]}]

We will argue that there exists a general confusion\nwithin the foundational literature arising from the improper \"scrambling\" of\ntwo different meanings of quantum contextuality. While the first one,\nintroduced by Bohr, is related to an epistemic interpretation of contextuality\nwhich stresses the incompatibility (or complementarity) of certain measurement\nsituations described in classical terms; the second meaning of contextuality is\nrelated to an ontic notion of contextuality and is best exposed by the\nKochen-Specker theorem, which focuses on the constraints of the orthodox\nquantum formalism to interpret projection operators as preexistent or actual\n(definite valued) properties. We will show how these two notions have been\nscrambled together creating an \"omelette of contextuality\" which has been fully\nwidespread through a popularized \"epistemic explanation\" of the KS theorem\naccording to which: The measurement outcome of the observable A when measured\ntogether with B or together with C will necessarily differ in case [A, B] = [A,\nC] = 0, and [B, C] =/ 0.

Clearly,\ngeneral Walsh-Hadamard Transform is a first solution to the noisy sparse WHT,\nwhich can obtain all Walsh coefficients larger than a given threshold and the\nindex positions. In this work, we study efficient implementations of very large\ndimensional general WHT. Our work is believed to shed light on noisy sparse\nWHT, which remains to be a big open challenge. Meanwhile, the main idea behind\nwill help to study parallel data-intensive computing, which has a broad range\nof applications.\n","Comment: to appear in proceedings of Future Technologies Conference - FTC\n  2016, San Francisco, 6 - 7 Dec, IEEE"]}]

Like the few previously known objects on\nsimilar orbits, these objects' semimajor axes are just beyond the Kuiper belt\nedge and clustered around Neptunian mean motion resonances (MMRs). These\nobjects likely obtained their observed orbits while trapped within MMRs, when\nthe Kozai-Lidov mechanism raised their perihelia and weakened Neptune's\ndynamical influence. Using numerical simulations that model the production of\nthis population, we find that high-perihelion objects near Neptunian MMRs can\nconstrain the nature and timescale of Neptune's past orbital migration. In\nparticular, the population near the 3:1 MMR (near 62 AU) is especially useful\ndue to its large population and short dynamical evolution timescale. If Neptune\nfinishes migrating within ~100 Myrs or less, we predict over 90% of\nhigh-perihelion objects near the 3:1 MMR will have semimajor axes within 1 AU\nof each other, very near the modern resonance's center. On the other hand, if\nNeptune's migration takes ~300 Myrs, we expect ~50% of this population to\nreside in dynamically fossilized orbits over ~1 AU closer to the Sun than the\nmodern resonance. We highlight 2015 KH162 as a likely member of this fossilized\n3:1 population. Under any plausible migration scenario, nearly all\nhigh-perihelion objects in resonances beyond the 4:1 MMR (near 76 AU) reach\ntheir orbits well after Neptune stops migrating and comprise a recently\ngenerated, dynamically active population.\n","Comment: Accepted to ApJ; 15 pages, 13 figures, 1 table"]}]

Although on scales of a few\nthousand AU the magnetic field inferred from the masers is on average\norientated along the flow axis, on smaller scales (10s to 100s of AU), we have\nrevealed a misalignment between the magnetic field and the velocity vectors,\nwhich arises from the compression of the field component along the shock front.\nOur measurements support a scenario where the magnetic field would evolve from\nhaving a dominant component parallel to the outflow velocity in the pre-shock\ngas, with field strengths of the order of a few tens of mG (at densities of\n$10^7$ cm$^{-3}$), to being mainly dominated by the perpendicular component of\norder of a few hundred of mG in the post-shock gas where the water masers are\nexcited (at densities of $10^9$ cm$^{-3}$). The general implication is that in\nthe undisturbed (i.e. not-shocked) circumstellar gas, the flow velocities would\nfollow closely the magnetic field lines, while in the gas shocked by the\nprostostellar jet the magnetic field would be re-configured to be parallel to\nthe shock front.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy &\n  Astrophysics"]}]

Based on the t-J model in the\nfermion-spin representation, the coexistence of the Fermi arcs and Fermi\npockets in cuprate superconductors is studied by taking into account the\npseudogap effect. It is shown that the pseudogap induces an energy band\nsplitting, and then the poles of the electron Green's function at zero energy\nform two contours in momentum space, however, the electron spectral weight on\nthese two contours around the antinodal region is gapped out by the pseudogap,\nleaving behind the low-energy electron spectral weight only located at the\ndisconnected segments around the nodal region. In particular, the tips of these\ndisconnected segments converge on the hot spots to form the closed Fermi\npockets, generating a coexistence of the Fermi arcs and Fermi pockets.\nMoreover, the single-particle coherent weight is directly related to the\npseudogap, and grows linearly with doping. The calculated result of the overall\ndispersion of the electron excitations is in qualitative agreement with the\nexperimental data.

We determined in advance\nthe threshold magnitude, above which all earthquakes are completely recorded.\nWe then showed that the occurrence rate of relatively large (M >= 3)\nearthquakes significantly decreased 1 day before the M7.3 quake. Significance\nof this decrease was evaluated by one standard deviation of sampled changes in\nthe rate of occurrence. We next confirmed that seismicity with M >= 3 was well\nmodeled by the OU law with p ~ 1.5 +/- 0.3, which indicates that the temporal\ndecay of seismicity was significantly faster than a typical decay with p = 1.\nThe larger p value was obtained when we used data of the longer time period in\nthe analysis.

In order to trigger the formation\nof a penumbra, large inclinations in the magnetic field are necessary. In\nsunspots, the penumbra develops and establishes by colonising both umbral areas\nand granulation, that is, penumbral magneto-convection takes over in umbral\nregions with $B_{\\rm ver} < B^{\\rm stable}_{\\rm ver}$, as well as in granular\nconvective areas. Eventually, a stable umbra-penumbra boundary settles at\n$B^{\\rm stable}_{\\rm ver}$. Here, we aim to study the development of a penumbra\ninitiated at the boundary of a pore, where the penumbra colonises the entire\npore ultimately. We have used Hinode/SOT G-band images to study the evolution\nof the penumbra. Hinode/SOT spectropolarimetric data were used to infer the\nmagnetic field properties in the studied region. The penumbra forms at the\nboundary of a pore located close to the polarity inversion line of NOAA\\,10960.\nAs the penumbral bright grains protrude into the pore, the magnetic flux in the\nforming penumbra increases at the expense of the pore magnetic flux.\nConsequently, the pore disappears completely giving rise to an orphan penumbra.\nAt all times, the vertical component of the magnetic field in the pore is\nsmaller than $B^{\\rm stable}_{\\rm ver} \\approx 1.8$~kG.

The periods are derived with\nthe wavelet method and confirmed based on the FFT spectra of the rapidly\nvarying signals. Results. We find a period of 50 s from the thermal emissions\nduring the impulsive phase of the flare, that is, in the soft X-ray bands. At\nthe same time, a period of about 100 s is detected from the nonthermal\nemissions, such as hard X-ray and microwave channels. The period ratio is\nexactly 2.0, which might be due to the modulations of the magnetic reconnection\nrate by the fundamental and harmonic modes of magnetohydrodynamic waves. Our\nresults further show that the 100 s period is present over a broad wavelength,\nsuch as hard X-rays, extreme-UV/UV, and microwave emissions, indicating the\nperiodic magnetic reconnection in this flare. Conclusions. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first report about period changes from thermal to nonthermal\ncomponents in a single flare that occur at almost the same time. This new\nobservational finding could be a challenge to the theory of flare QPPs.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in the Letters\n  of A&A"]}]

First, we study the\nhardness of sampling the output distribution of a random quantum circuit, along\nthe lines of a recent proposal by the the Quantum AI group at Google. We show\nthat there's a natural hardness assumption, which has nothing to do with\nsampling, yet implies that no efficient classical algorithm can pass a\nstatistical test that the quantum sampling procedure's outputs do pass.\nCompared to previous work, the central advantage is that we can now talk\ndirectly about the observed outputs, rather than about the distribution being\nsampled. Second, in an attempt to refute our hardness assumption, we give a new\nalgorithm, for simulating a general quantum circuit with n qubits and m gates\nin polynomial space and m^O(n) time. We then discuss why this and other known\nalgorithms fail to refute our assumption.

In many real-world tasks, designing a suitable reward function takes\nconsiderable manual engineering and often requires additional and potentially\nvisible sensors to be installed just to measure whether the task has been\nexecuted successfully. Furthermore, many interesting tasks consist of multiple\nsteps that must be executed in sequence. Even when the final outcome can be\nmeasured, it does not necessarily provide useful feedback on these implicit\nintermediate steps or sub-goals. To address these issues, we propose leveraging\nthe abstraction power of intermediate visual representations learned by deep\nmodels to quickly infer perceptual reward functions from small numbers of\ndemonstrations. We present a method that is able to identify the key\nintermediate steps of a task from only a handful of demonstration sequences,\nand automatically identify the most discriminative features for identifying\nthese steps. This method makes use of the features in a pre-trained deep model,\nbut does not require any explicit sub-goal supervision. The resulting reward\nfunctions can then be used by an RL agent to learn to perform the task in\nreal-world settings. To evaluate the learned reward functions, we present\nqualitative results on two real-world tasks and a quantitative evaluation\nagainst a human-designed reward function. We also demonstrate that our method\ncan be used to learn a complex real-world door opening skill using a real\nrobot, even when the demonstration used for reward learning is provided by a\nhuman using their own hand. To our knowledge, these are the first results\nshowing that complex robotic manipulation skills can be learned directly and\nwithout supervised labels from a video of a human performing the task.\n"]}]

During the past decade, numerous\nhashing algorithms are proposed to solve this problem. Every proposed algorithm\nclaims outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. However, there are serious\ndrawbacks in the evaluation of existing hashing papers and most of the claims\nin these papers should be re-examined. 1) Most of the existing papers failed to\ncorrectly measure the search time which is essential for the ANN search\nproblem. 2) As a result, most of the papers report the performance increases as\nthe code length increases, which is wrong if we measure the search time\ncorrectly. 3) The performance of some hashing algorithms (e.g., LSH) can easily\nbe boosted if one uses multiple hash tables, which is an important factor\nshould be considered in the evaluation while most of the papers failed to do\nso. In this paper, we carefully revisit many popular hashing algorithms and\nsuggest one possible promising direction.

Unlike the\nmostly studied random field magnets where the order parameter is uniaxial or\nisotropic, the polarization of typical relaxors lives in a cubic environment.\nMoreover, the exchange interaction that drives the magnetic transition is\nshort-ranged and isotropic, while the relevant interaction in ferroelectrics is\nthe highly anisotropic and long-ranged dipolar force. This puts relaxors in a\ndifferent universality class from that of disordered magnets making the\nstandard model of random field disorder inadequate to describe their unusual\nproperties. Here, we study the effects of cubic random electric fields on the\nlattice instabilities that lead to the ferroelectric transition and show that,\nwithin a microscopic model and a statistical mechanical solution, even weak\ncompositional disorder can prohibit the development of long-range order and\nthat a random field state with anisotropic and power-law correlations of\npolarization emerges from the combined effect of dipole forces and their\ninherent charge disorder. We compare and reproduce several key experimental\nobservations in the well-studied relaxor PbMg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$O$_3$-PbTiO$_3$.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 5 figures, supplemental material included"]}]

Many of these solutions have\nbeen found for smooth-walled plane Couette, channel, and pipe flows.\nRough-walled flows are of great practical significance, yet no recurring\nsolutions are known for these flows. We present a numerical homotopy method to\ncontinue solutions from smooth-walled flows to corresponding rough-walled\nflows, illustrated here for grooved Couette flow at a Reynolds number of 400.\nLoss of spanwise homogeneity reduces continuous families of solutions,\nidentical up to translational shifts, in smooth Couette flow to multiple\ndiscrete families in grooved Couette flow. The discrete families are ones that\ncan preserve the discrete symmetries of Couette flow. Continuation of these\nsolutions suggests that the exact coherent structures of smooth-walled flows\nalso dominate rough-walled flows. Reduction of continuous families to discrete\nfamilies implies that turbulence statistics in grooved Couette flow, and\nrough-walled flows by extension, must retain the spatial variation of exact\nsolutions.

A number of changes have been proposed to improve\nperformance of canonical QEA. However, canonical QEA is one of the few\nevolutionary algorithms, which uses a search operator with relatively large\nnumber of parameters. It is well known that performance of evolutionary\nalgorithms is dependent on specific value of parameters for a given problem.\nThe advantage of having large number of parameters in an operator is that the\nsearch process can be made more powerful even with a single operator without\nrequiring a combination of other operators for exploration and exploitation.\nHowever, the tuning of operators with large number of parameters is complex and\ncomputationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel heuristic method for\ntuning parameters of canonical QEA. The tuned QEA outperforms canonical QEA on\na class of discrete combinatorial optimization problems which, validates the\ndesign of the proposed parameter tuning framework. The proposed framework can\nbe used for tuning other algorithms with both large and small number of tunable\nparameters.\n"]}]

At\n40 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 78.6 mAP, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like\nFaster RCNN with ResNet and SSD while still running significantly faster.\nFinally we propose a method to jointly train on object detection and\nclassification. Using this method we train YOLO9000 simultaneously on the COCO\ndetection dataset and the ImageNet classification dataset. Our joint training\nallows YOLO9000 to predict detections for object classes that don't have\nlabelled detection data. We validate our approach on the ImageNet detection\ntask. YOLO9000 gets 19.7 mAP on the ImageNet detection validation set despite\nonly having detection data for 44 of the 200 classes. On the 156 classes not in\nCOCO, YOLO9000 gets 16.0 mAP. But YOLO can detect more than just 200 classes;\nit predicts detections for more than 9000 different object categories. And it\nstill runs in real-time.\n"]}]

The TRIP effect leads to\nenhanced work-hardening rate, postponed onset of necking and excellent\nformability. In-situ transmission electron microscopy has been performed to\nsystematically investigate the dynamic interactions between dislocations and\nalpha martensite at microscale. Local stress concentrations, e.g. from notches\nor dislocation pile-ups, render free edges and grain boundaries favorable\nnucleation sites for alpha martensite. Its growth leads to partial dislocation\nemission on two independent slip planes from the hetero-interface when the\naustenite matrix is initially free of dislocations. The kinematic analysis\nreveals that activating slip systems on two independent {111} planes of\naustenite are necessary in accommodating the interfacial mismatch strain. Full\ndislocation emission is generally observed inside of austenite regions that\ncontain high density of dislocations. In both situations, phase boundary\npropagation generates large amounts of dislocations entering into the matrix,\nwhich renders the total deformation compatible and provide substantial strain\nhardening of the host phase. These moving dislocation sources enable plastic\nrelaxation and prevent local damage accumulation by intense slipping on the\nsofter side of the interfacial region.

To clarify the fundamental idea of\nour method, the multiscale persistent entropy model is discussed in great\ndetail. Mathematically, unlike the previous persistent entropy or topological\nentropy, a special resolution parameter is incorporated into our model. Various\nscales can be achieved by tuning its value. Physically, our multiscale\npersistent entropy can be used in conformation entropy evaluation. More\nspecifically, it is found that our method incorporates in it a natural\nclassification scheme. This is achieved through a density filtration of a\nmultiscale rigidity function built from bond and/or dihedral angle\ndistributions. To further validate our model, a systematical comparison with\nthe traditional entropy evaluation model is done. It is found that our model is\nable to preserve the intrinsic topological features of biomolecular data much\nbetter than traditional approaches, particularly for resolutions in the mediate\nrange. Moreover, our method can be successfully used in protein classification.\nFor a test database with around nine hundred proteins, a clear separation\nbetween all-alpha and all-beta proteins can be achieved, using only the\ndihedral and pseudo-bond angle information.

The first one,\nnamed multi-scale spatial LSTM encoder, reads facial patches of various scales\nsequentially to output a latent representation, and occlusion-robustness is\nachieved owing to the fact that the influence of occlusion is only upon some of\nthe patches. Receiving the representation learned by the encoder, the LSTM\ndecoder with a dual channel architecture reconstructs the overall face and\ndetects occlusion simultaneously, and by feat of LSTM, the decoder breaks down\nthe task of face de-occlusion into restoring the occluded part step by step.\nMoreover, to minimize identify information loss and guarantee face recognition\naccuracy over recovered faces, we introduce an identity-preserving adversarial\ntraining scheme to further improve RLA. Extensive experiments on both synthetic\nand real datasets of faces with occlusion clearly demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our proposed RLA in removing different types of facial occlusion at various\nlocations.

In this paper, we\nquantify the performance impact of IQI at both the transmitter and receiver\nradio frequency front-ends on differential STBC-OFDM systems which has not been\ninvestigated before in the literature. In addition, we propose a widely-linear\ncompensation algorithm at the receiver to mitigate the performance degradation\ncaused by the IQI at the transmitter and receiver ends. Moreover, a\nparameter-based generalized algorithm is proposed to extract the IQI parameters\nand improve the performance under high-mobility. The adaptive compensation\nalgorithms are blind and work in a decision-directed manner without using known\npilots or training sequences. Numerical results show that our proposed\ncompensation algorithms can effectively mitigate IQI in differential STBC-OFDM.\n","Comment: IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 15 pages, 11 figures"]}]

Since the\nmassive SM-MIMO concept combines the benefits of both the SM and massive MIMO\ntechniques, it has recently attracted substantial research interest. In this\npaper, we study the achievable uplink spectral efficiency (SE) of a multi-cell\nmassive SM-MIMO system, and derive closed-form expressions to asymptotically\nlower-bound the SE yielded by two linear BS combining schemes, including\nmaximum ratio (MR) combining and zero forcing (ZF) combining, when a\nsufficiently large number of BS antennas are equipped. The derivation takes\ninto account the impact of transmitter spatial correlations, of imperfect\nchannel estimations, of user-specific power controls and of different pilot\nreuse factors. The proposed asymptotic bounds are shown to be tight, even when\nthe scale of BS antennas is limited. The new SE results facilitate a\nsystem-level investigation of the optimal number of uplink transmit antennas\n(TAs) $N$ with respect to SE maximization.

The\nsmall scale measurements were made in fusion plasmas and compared to\npredictions from classical fluid turbulence theory. The data is consistent with\nthe dissipative range of 2D turbulence. Alternatively, the results can be\nfitted to a functional form that can not be explained by turbulence theory. The\nlarge scale measurements were part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxy\nredshift examination. We found that the equations describing fusion plasmas\nalso hold for the galaxy data. The comparable dependency of density fluctuation\npower on wavenumber in fusion plasmas and galaxies might indicate a common\norigin of these fluctuations.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 2 figures, accepted for publication in 'Physics Letters A'"]}]
