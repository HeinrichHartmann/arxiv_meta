The cities of the United States of America in 1900, 1940,\n1960, and 1980 and Indian cities in 1981, 1991, and 2001 are utilized to\nillustrate the geographical spatial meaning of Pareto's exponent. The results\nsuggest that the Pareto exponent of city-size distribution is not a fractal\ndimension, but a ratio of the urban network dimension to the city population\ndimension.

First, the problem\nis studied in the symmetric linear deterministic IC (SLDIC) setting, and\nachievable schemes are proposed, based on interference cancelation, relaying of\nthe other user's data bits, and transmission of random bits. In the proposed\nachievable scheme, the limited rate cooperative link is used to share a\ncombination of data bits and random bits depending on the model parameters.\nOuter bounds on the secrecy rate are also derived, using a novel partitioning\nof the encoded messages and outputs depending on the relative strength of the\nsignal and the interference.

However, up-to-date, the sensing schemes\nsuggested by CS theories are made of random isolated measurements, which are\nusually incompatible with the physics of acquisition. To reflect the physical\nconstraints of the imaging device, we introduce the notion of blocks of\nmeasurements: the sensing scheme is not a set of isolated measurements anymore,\nbut a set of groups of measurements which may represent any arbitrary shape\n(parallel or radial lines for instance). Structured acquisition with blocks of\nmeasurements are easy to implement, and provide good reconstruction results in\npractice. However, very few results exist on the theoretical guarantees of CS\nreconstructions in this setting.

Our results are thus support-dependent and\noffer the possibility for flexible assumptions on the sparsity structure.\nMoreover, the results are drawing-dependent, since we highlight an explicit\ndependency between the probability of reconstructing a sparse vector and the\nway of choosing the blocks of measurements.

There is a crossover at certain momentum in\nthe direction perpendicular to the separation of the Weyl nodes above which the\nnovel gapless mode enters into an overdamped regime.

The resulting hierarchy,\n\"Lexis-DAG\", shows how to construct each target through the concatenation of\nintermediate substrings, minimizing the total number of such concatenations or\nDAG edges. The Lexis optimization problem is related to the smallest grammar\nproblem. After we prove its NP-Hardness for two cost formulations, we propose\nan efficient greedy algorithm for the construction of Lexis-DAGs. We also\nconsider the problem of identifying the set of intermediate nodes (substrings)\nthat collectively form the \"core\" of a Lexis-DAG, which is important in the\nanalysis of Lexis-DAGs. We show that the Lexis framework can be applied in\ndiverse applications such as optimized synthesis of DNA fragments in genomic\nlibraries, hierarchical structure discovery in protein sequences,\ndictionary-based text compression, and feature extraction from a set of\ndocuments.\n"]}]

In\nthis paper we discuss the assumptions behind such interpretation. We show that\nDoppler-like couplings appear from two effects: our peculiar velocity and a\nsecond order large-scale effect due to the dipolar part of the gravitational\npotential. We find that the two effects are exactly degenerate but only if we\nassume second-order initial conditions from single-field Inflation. Thus,\ndetecting a discrepancy in the value of $\\beta$ from the dipole and the Doppler\ncouplings implies the presence of a primordial non-Gaussianity. We also show\nthat aberration-like signals likewise arise from two independent effects: our\npeculiar velocity and lensing due to a first order large-scale dipolar\ngravitational potential, independently on Gaussianity of the initial\nconditions. In general such effects are not degenerate and so a discrepancy\nbetween the measured $\\beta$ from the dipole and aberration could be accounted\nfor by a dipolar gravitational potential. Only through a fine-tuning of the\nradial profile of the potential it is possible to have a complete degeneracy\nwith a boost effect.

Motivated in part by the difficulty of\naccommodating large amounts of entropy carried in dark radiation with cosmic\nmicrowave background measurements of the effective number of relativistic\nspecies at recombination, $N_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, we aim to establish which\nadmissible cosmological histories can populate a thermal dark sector that never\nreaches thermal equilibrium with the SM. The minimal cosmological origin for\nsuch a dark sector is asymmetric reheating, when the same mechanism that\npopulates the SM in the early universe also populates the dark sector at a\nlower temperature. Here we demonstrate that the resulting inevitable\ninflaton-mediated scattering between the dark sector and the SM can wash out a\nwould-be temperature asymmetry, and establish the regions of parameter space\nwhere temperature asymmetries can be generated in minimal reheating scenarios.\nThus obtaining a temperature asymmetry of a given size either restricts\npossible inflaton masses and couplings or necessitates a non-minimal cosmology\nfor one or both sectors.

Here we show how to overcome this\nlimitation using electrodynamic hot spots and interference effects in the\nregime of continuous-wave (CW) excitation. We introduce a set of figures of\nmerit for the localization of temperature and for the efficiency of the\nplasmonic photo-thermal effect. Our calculations show that the temperature\nlocalization in a trimer nanoparticle assembly is a complex function of the\ngeometry and sizes. Large nanoparticles in the trimer play the role of the\nnano-optical antenna whereas the small nanoparticle in the plasmonic hot spot\nacts as a nano-heater. Under the peculiar conditions, the temperature increase\ninside a nanoparticle trimer can be localized in a hot spot region at the small\nheater nanoparticle and, in this way, a thermal hot spot can be realized.\nHowever, the overall power efficiency of temperature generation in this trimer\nis much smaller than that of a single nanoparticle. We can overcome the latter\ndisadvantage by using a trimer with a nanorod. In the trimer assembly composed\nof a nanorod and two spherical nanoparticles, we observe a strong plasmonic\nFano effect that leads to the concertation of optical energy dissipation in the\nsmall heater nanorod. Therefore, the power-absorption efficiency of temperature\ngeneration in the nanorod-based assembly greatly increases due to the strong\nplasmonic Fano effect. The Fano heater incorporating a small nanorod in the hot\nspot has obviously the best performance compared to both single nanocrystals\nand a nanoparticle trimer. The principles of heat localization described here\ncan be potentially used for thermal photo-catalysis, energy conversion and\nbio-related applications.\n","Comment: 39 pages, 13 figures, Supporting information with 2 figures"]}]

Determining an optimal set of\nexchanges is theoretically and empirically hard. Traditionally, exchanges took\nplace in cycles, with each participating patient-donor pair both giving and\nreceiving a kidney. The recent introduction of chains, where a donor without a\npaired patient triggers a sequence of donations without requiring a kidney in\nreturn, increased the efficacy of fielded kidney exchanges---while also\ndramatically raising the empirical computational hardness of clearing the\nmarket in practice. While chains can be quite long, unbounded-length chains are\nnot desirable: planned donations can fail before transplant for a variety of\nreasons, and the failure of a single donation causes the rest of that chain to\nfail, so parallel shorter chains are better in practice.\n  In this paper, we address the tractable clearing of kidney exchanges with\nshort cycles and chains that are long but bounded. This corresponds to the\npractice at most modern fielded kidney exchanges. We introduce three new\ninteger programming formulations, two of which are compact.

Temporal periodicity conditions are imposed on ZPF,\nassociated with the way the rotating oscillator observes ZPF. They are similar\nto spatial boundary conditions in Casimir phenomenon and therefore result in\nZPF spectrum change from continuous one to a discrete one and, as a\nconsequence, an effective temperature of the modified ZPF (Y.

The\naverage centripetal average force on the oscillator, originating from this\nmodified ZPF scattered by the oscillator in the near zone, is calculated in\nterms of the bilinear correlation functions of electromagnetic field. After\nrenormalization of the correlation function, which physically means extraction\nof a pure effect of periodicity, the force has a finite value. All calculations\nare carried out using the methodology of stochastic electrodynamics. The radial\ncomponent of the force is directed to the center of rotation.

Our\nresults reveal that the existence of vacancy will reduce the bulk modulus,\nwhile enhance the shear and Young's moduli.

To further investigate how the\nclustering of vacancies influences the mechanical properties, the most stable\nconfigurations of di- and trivacancy clusters have been predicted, which\ncorrespond to the most compact distribution of vacancies.

With quantitative scientists\nfrom computer science, mathematics, and physics working on datasets from\nbiology, economics, sociology, political sciences, and many others, network\nscience serves as a paradigm for interdisciplinary research. One of the major\ngoals in network science is to unravel the relationship between topological\ngraph structure and a network's function. As evidence suggests, systems from\nthe same fields, i.e. with similar function, tend to exhibit similar structure.\nHowever, it is still vague whether a similar graph structure automatically\nimplies likewise function.

After a\ngeneral introduction to the main concepts of network science, existing work\ndevoted to the relevance of triadic substructures is reviewed. A major\nchallenge in modeling such structure is the fact that not all three-node\nsubgraphs can be specified independently of each other, as pairs of nodes may\nparticipate in multiple triadic subgraphs. In order to overcome this obstacle,\na novel class of generative network models based on pair-disjoint triadic\nbuilding blocks is suggested. It is further investigated whether triad motifs -\nsubgraph patterns which appear significantly more frequently than expected at\nrandom - occur homogeneously or heterogeneously distributed over graphs.\nFinally, the influence of triadic substructure on the evolution of dynamical\nprocesses acting on their nodes is studied.
