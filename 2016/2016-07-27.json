In 1846 Faraday introduced the concept of vibrating rays,\nin which an atom is conceived as having rays that extend to infinity and move\nwith it. According to this point of view, electromagnetic radiative phenomena\ncorrespond to vibration of these rays, which propagate at speed c relative to\nthe rays (and the atom). Although a discussion on this subject might seem to be\nout-of-date, there are many reasons that justified this debate. The first\nreason is based on the fact that the constancy of the speed of light,\nirrespective of the source movement, has not been demonstrated experimentally\nin a conclusive way. In fact, only ballistic emission theories can be discarded\nby the experimental results. The second reason is based on the fact that study\nof radiometric data from spacecrafts indicates the existence of different kinds\nof anomalous Doppler residuals. We will show that these anomalies exhibit a\nsignature of Vibrating Rays Theory. The third reason is related to the time\ndefinition in a rotating frame.

Scrutinizing\nthe combined evolution in luminosity and size, we find that the galaxies which\nshow the strongest evolution towards smaller sizes at z~1 are not those which\nfeature the strongest evolution in luminosity, and vice versa.

Contrary to this expectation, a bright\nelectromagnetic transient can occur in the final moments before merger as long\nas the neutron star is highly magnetized. The orbital motion of the neutron\nstar magnet creates a Faraday flux and corresponding power available for\nluminosity. A spectrum of curvature radiation ramps up until the rapid\ninjection of energy ignites a fireball, which would appear as an energetic\nblackbody peaking in the x ray to $\\gamma$ rays for neutron star field\nstrengths ranging from $10^{12}$G to $10^{16}$G respectively and a $10M_{\\odot}\n$ black hole.

The cluster also harbors a\nlikely radio phoenix, a source revived by adiabatic compression by gas motions\nin the ICM. Even though the Ophiuchus cluster is strongly dynamically active,\nthe amplitude of density fluctuations outside of the cooling core is low,\nindicating velocities smaller than ~100 km/s. The density fluctuations might be\ndamped by thermal conduction in the hot and remarkably isothermal ICM,\nresulting in our underestimate of gas velocities. We find a surprising, sharp\nsurface brightness discontinuity, that is curved away from the core, at r~120\nkpc to the southeast of the cluster center. We conclude that this feature is\nmost likely due to gas dynamics associated with a merger and not a result of an\nextraordinary active galactic nucleus (AGN) outburst. The cooling core lacks\nany observable X-ray cavities and the AGN only displays weak, point-like radio\nemission, lacking lobes or jets, indicating that currently it may be largely\ndormant.

The observations support a picture of low-mass star\nformation according to which ~ 0.1 pc-wide filaments form first in the cold\ninterstellar medium, probably as a result of large-scale compression of\ninterstellar matter by supersonic turbulent flows, and then prestellar cores\narise from gravitational fragmentation of the densest filaments. Whether this\nscenario also applies to regions of high-mass star formation is an open\nquestion, in part because Herschel data cannot resolve the inner width of\nfilaments in the nearest regions of massive star formation.\n  We used the bolometer camera ArTeMiS on the APEX telescope to map the central\npart of the NGC6334 complex at a factor of > 3 higher resolution than Herschel\nat 350 microns. Combining ArTeMiS data with Herschel data allowed us to study\nthe structure of the main filament of the complex with a resolution of 8\" or <\n0.07 pc at d ~ 1.7 kpc.\n  Our study confirms that this filament is a very dense, massive linear\nstructure with a line mass ranging from ~ 500 Msun/pc to ~ 2000 Msun/pc over\nnearly 10 pc. It also demonstrates that its inner width remains as narrow as W\n~ 0.15 +- 0.05 pc all along the filament length, within a factor of < 2 of the\ncharacteristic 0.1 pc value found with Herschel for lower-mass filaments in the\nGould Belt. While it is not completely clear whether the NGC 6334 filament will\nform massive stars or not in the future, it is two to three orders of magnitude\ndenser than the majority of filaments observed in Gould Belt clouds, and yet\nhas a very similar inner width.

For five of\nthose, the periodicity is probably due to the crossing of rotating stellar\nspots by the transiting planets.\n","Comment: 81 pages, 34 figures, 8 tables.

The environmental processes act primarily as an on/off switch for\nthe HI content of satellites with stellar mass Mstar>10^9 Msun.

HI-depleted satellites reside mostly, but not\nexclusively, within the virial radius r200 of their host halo. We investigate\nthe origin of these trends by focussing on three environmental mechanisms: ram\npressure stripping by the intra-group medium, tidal stripping by the host halo,\nand satellite-satellite encounters. By tracking back in time the evolution of\nthe HI-depleted satellites, we find that the most common cause of HI removal is\nsatellite encounters.

The flare was tracked from\ngamma-ray to near-infrared frequencies, including Fermi and Swift data as well\nas photometric and polarimetric data from several observatories. An intensive\nGASP-WEBT collaboration campaign in optical and NIR bands, with an addition of\npreviously unpublished archival data and extension through fall 2015, allows\ncomparison of this outburst with the previous activity period of this blazar in\n2004-2005. We find remarkable similarity between the optical and gamma-ray\nbehaviour of CTA 102 during the outburst, with a time lag between the two light\ncurves of ~1 hour, indicative of co-spatiality of the optical and gamma-ray\nemission regions. The relation between the gamma-ray and optical fluxes is\nconsistent with the SSC mechanism, with a quadratic dependence of the SSC\ngamma-ray flux on the synchrotron optical flux evident in the post-outburst\nstage. However, the gamma-ray/optical relationship is linear during the\noutburst; we attribute this to changes in the Doppler factor. A strong\nharder-when-brighter spectral dependence is seen both the in gamma-ray and\noptical non-thermal emission. This hardening can be explained by convexity of\nthe UV-NIR spectrum that moves to higher frequencies owing to an increased\nDoppler shift as the viewing angle decreases during the outburst stage. The\noverall pattern of Stokes parameter variations agrees with a model of a\nradiating blob or shock wave that moves along a helical path down the jet.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 14 figures, accepted in MNRAS"]}]

They offer a potential multi-gigabit throughput\nand an ultra-low radio latency, but at the same time suffer from high isotropic\npathloss, and a coverage area much smaller than the one of LTE macrocells. In\norder to address these issues, highly directional beamforming and a very\nhigh-density deployment of mmWave base stations were proposed. This Thesis aims\nto improve the reliability and performance of the 5G network by studying its\ntight and seamless integration with the current LTE cellular network. In\nparticular, the LTE base stations can provide a coverage layer for 5G mobile\nterminals, because they operate on microWave frequencies, which are less\nsensitive to blockage and have a lower pathloss.

The present work aimed to computationally study how\nphysical conditions imposed by pathologic valvular anatomy act on AF\nhemodynamics. We simulated AF with different severity grades of left-sided\nvalvular diseases and compared the cardiovascular effects that they exert\nduring AF, compared to lone AF. The fluid dynamics model used here has been\nrecently validated for lone AF and relies on a lumped parameterization of the\nfour heart chambers, together with the systemic and pulmonary circulation.\nThree different grades of severity (mild, moderate, severe) were analyzed for\neach of the four valvulopathies (aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, aortic\nregurgitation, mitral regurgitation). Regurgitation was hemodynamically more\nrelevant than stenosis, as the latter led to inefficient cardiac flow, while\nthe former introduced more drastic fluid dynamics variation. Moreover, mitral\nvalvulopathies were more significant than aortic ones. In case of aortic valve\ndiseases, proper mitral functioning damps out changes at atrial and pulmonary\nlevels. In the case of mitral valvulopathy, the mitral valve lost its\nregulating capability, thus hemodynamic variations almost equally affected\nregions upstream and downstream of the valve. The present study revealed that\nboth mitral and aortic regurgitation strongly affect hemodynamics, followed by\nmitral stenosis, while aortic stenosis has the least impact among the analyzed\nvalvular diseases. The proposed approach can provide new mechanistic insights\nas to which valvular pathologies merit more aggressive treatment of AF. Present\nfindings, if clinically confirmed, hold the potential to impact AF management\n(e.g., adoption of a rhythm control strategy) in specific valvular diseases.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 4 figures"]}]

However, recent methods for\nsingle image super-resolution (SR) fail to maintain this advantage. They\nutilize CNNs in two decoupled steps, i.e., first upsampling the low resolution\n(LR) image to the high resolution (HR) size with hand-designed techniques\n(e.g., bicubic interpolation), and then applying CNNs on the upsampled LR image\nto reconstruct HR results.

We\ntry to find some clues by investigating its propagation from the Sun to 1 AU.\nFirst, we reconstruct the CME's kinematic properties in the corona from the\nSOHO and SDO imaging data with the aid of the graduated cylindrical shell (GCS)\nmodel.

However, due to the lack of observations from the STEREO\nspacecraft, the CME's kinematic evolution in interplanetary space is not clear.\nIn order to fill this gap, we utilize numerical MHD simulation, drag-based CME\npropagation model (DBM) and the model for CME deflection in interplanetary\nspace (DIPS) to recover the propagation process, especially the trajectory, of\nthe CME from $30 R_S$ to 1 AU. It is suggested that the trajectory of the CME\nwas deflected toward the Earth by about $12^\\circ$, consistent with the\nimplication from the MC reconstruction at 1 AU.

However, by changing the scheduling problem to first\ndetermine a task workload partition and then to find the execution order of all\ntasks, the computation time can be significantly reduced. Specifically, the\nworkload partitioning problem can be formulated as a continuous nonlinear\nprogram for a system with continuous operating frequency, and as a continuous\nlinear program for a practical system with a discrete speed level set. The task\nordering problem can be solved by an algorithm with a complexity that is linear\nin the total number of tasks.

In the second case, it is\ntypically assumed that the impact of the parasitic $\\gamma$-rays found in the\nneutron beams is negligible.

Students enrolled in courses where ACE-M was used as the foundation\nfor problem-solving instruction reported improved problem-solving\nself-efficacy, more monitoring while solving problems, and in many cases\nimproved course grades. With this explicit instruction on self-monitoring,\nstudents are now introduced to expert problem-solving skills that will benefit\nthem in their STEM careers.\n"]}]

In this\ncognitive apprenticeship program, teachers learn to plan, evaluate and adjust\nto improve student engagement and achievement. Central is the metacognitive\npractice of defense of instruction. By practicing this reflective approach,\nteachers become adaptive experts, able to innovate in the classroom. During the\ntwo-year intervention, the MAST System resulted in large increases in the\nCalifornia Standards Test mathematics scores, compared to both the district and\nthe state. In addition, improvement continued for several years after the\nintervention was completed.

In addition,\nhigh-resistance phase emerges at {\\nu} = 3/2 under very high tilt angles.

The results show that the\nvolatile prestellar fingerprint is modified by the chemistry en route into the\ndisc. This holds relatively independent of initial abundances and chemical\nparameters: physical conditions are more important. The amount of CO2 increases\nvia the grain-surface reaction of OH with CO, which is enhanced by\nphotodissociation of H2O ice. Complex organic molecules are produced during\ntransport through the envelope at the expense of CH3OH ice. Their abundances\ncan be comparable to that of methanol ice (few % of water ice) at large disc\nradii (R > 30 AU). Current Class II disc models may be underestimating the\ncomplex organic content. Planet population synthesis models may underestimate\nthe amount of CO2 and overestimate CH3OH ices in planetesimals by disregarding\nchemical processing between the cloud and disc phases. The overall C/O and C/N\nratios differ between the gas and solid phases. The two ice ratios show little\nvariation beyond the inner 10 AU and both are nearly solar in the case of pure\ninfall, but both are sub-solar when viscous spreading dominates. Chemistry in\nthe protostellar envelope en route to the protoplanetary disc sets the initial\nvolatile and prebiotically-significant content of icy planetesimals and\ncometary bodies. Comets are thus potentially reflecting the provenances of the\nmidplane ices in the Solar Nebula.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS; 19 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables"]}]
