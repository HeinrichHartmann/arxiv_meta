In this paper, we study the theoretical properties of the\nKendall's tau sample correlation matrix and its transformed version proposed in\nHan and Liu [J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 109 (2015) 275-287] for estimating the\npopulation Kendall's tau correlation matrix and the latent Pearson's\ncorrelation matrix under both spectral and restricted spectral norms. With\nregard to the spectral norm, we highlight the role of \"effective rank\" in\nquantifying the rate of convergence. With regard to the restricted spectral\nnorm, we for the first time present a \"sign sub-Gaussian condition\" which is\nsufficient to guarantee that the rank-based correlation matrix estimator\nattains the fast rate of convergence. In both cases, we do not need any moment\ncondition.\n","Comment: Published at http://dx.doi.org/10.3150/15-BEJ702 in the Bernoulli\n  (http://isi.cbs.nl/bernoulli/) by the International Statistical\n  Institute/Bernoulli Society (http://isi.cbs.nl/BS/bshome.htm)"]}]

The Reeb graph is one such descriptor for a given scalar\nfunction. The Reeb graph provides a simple yet meaningful abstraction of the\ninput domain, and can also be computed efficiently.\n  Given the popularity of the Reeb graph in applications, it is important to\nunderstand its stability and robustness with respect to changes in the input\nfunction, as well as to be able to compare the Reeb graphs resulting from\ndifferent functions.\n  In this paper, we propose a metric for Reeb graphs, called the functional\ndistortion distance. Under this distance measure, the Reeb graph is stable\nagainst small changes of input functions. At the same time, it remains\ndiscriminative at differentiating input functions. In particular, the main\nresult is that the functional distortion distance between two Reeb graphs is\nbounded from below by (and thus more discriminative than) the bottleneck\ndistance between both the ordinary and extended persistence diagrams for\nappropriate dimensions.\n  As an application of our results, we analyze a natural simplification scheme\nfor Reeb graphs, and show that persistent features in Reeb graph remains\npersistent under simplification.

In particular, for item pairs where the size of\none item is in (1/3,1/2] and the other is larger than 1/2 (a large item), when\ndeciding whether to pack such a pair together in one bin, our algorithm does\nnot consider their types, but only checks whether their total size is at most\n1. Second, for items with sizes in (1/3,1/2] (medium items), we try to pack the\nlarger items of every type in pairs, while combining the smallest items with\nlarge items whenever possible. To do this, we postpone the coloring of medium\nitems (i.e., the decision which items to pack in pairs and which to pack alone)\nwhere possible, and later select the smallest ones to be reserved for combining\nwith large items. Additionally, in case such large items arrive early, we pack\nmedium items with them whenever possible. This is a highly unusual idea in the\ncontext of Harmonic-like algorithms, which initially seems to preclude analysis\n(technically, the ratio of items reserved for combining with large items is no\nlonger a fixed constant).

The magnetic field model consists of an\nunperturbed reversed-shear helical part and a perturbation consisting of a\nsuperposition of modes. Contrary to most of the previous studies, the particle\ntrajectories are computed by directly solving the full Lorentz force equations\nof motion in a six-dimensional phase space using a sixth-order, implicit,\nsymplectic Gauss-Legendre method. The level of stochasticity in the particle\norbits is diagnosed using averaged, effective Poincare sections. It is shown\nthat when only one mode is present the particle orbits can be stochastic even\nthough the magnetic field line orbits are not stochastic. The lack of\nintegrability of the particle orbits in this case is related to separatrix\ncrossing and the breakdown of the global conservation of the magnetic moment.\nSome perturbation consisting of two modes creates resonance overlapping,\nleading to Hamiltonian chaos in magnetic field lines. Then, the particle orbits\nexhibit a nontrivial dynamics depending on their energy and pitch angle. It is\nshown that the regions where the particle motion is stochastic decrease as the\nenergy increases. The non-monotonicity of the $q$-profile implies the existence\nof magnetic ITBs which correspond to shearless flux surfaces located in the\nvicinity of the $q$-profile minimum. It is shown that depending on the energy,\nthese magnetic ITBs might or might not confine particles. That is, magnetic\nITBs act as an energy-dependent particle confinement filter. Magnetic field\nlines in reversed-shear configurations exhibit topological bifurcations due to\nseparatrix reconnection.

Many interesting problems in mathematics can be formulated,\ncomputed, or can find their equivalence in terms of Ext-groups. For instance,\nimportant (co)homology theories, such as the Mac Lane cohomology for rings or\nthe Hochschild and cyclic homology of commutative algebras can be defined as\nExt-groups in suitable functor categories; homotopical invariants can also gain\ninformation from homological data with the help of the unstable Adams spectral\nsequence, whose input takes the form of Ext-groups in the category of unstable\nmodules over the Steenrod algebra. Therefore, the constructions of explicit\ninjective (projective) resolutions in an abelian category is of great\nimportance. In this article, we introduce a new method, called\nPseudo-hyperresolution, to study such constructions. This method originates in\nthe category of unstable modules, and aims at building explicit resolutions for\nthe reduced singular cohomology of spheres. In particular, for all integers\n$n\\geq 0$, we can describe a large range of the minimal injective resolution of\nthe sphere $S^{n}$ based on the Bockstein operation of the Steenrod algebra.\nMoreover, many classical constructions in algebraic topology, such as the\nalgebraic EHP sequence or the Lambda algebra can be recovered using the\nPseudo-hyperresolution method. A particular connection between spheres and the\ninfinite complex projective space is also established. Despite its origin,\nPseudo-hyperresolution generalizes to all abelian categories. In particular,\nmany explicit resolutions of classical strict polynomial functors can be\nreunified in view of Pseudo-hyperresolution.

These\nsystems are often hypothesized to be in `spin equilibrium' with their\nsurrounding accretion flows such that the net spin change of the star as a\nresult of accretion is very small. This condition requires that the accretion\nrate changes more slowly than it takes the star to reach spin equilibrium.\nHowever, this is not true for most magnetically accreting stars, which have\nstrongly variable accretion outbursts (by one to many orders of magnitude) on\ntimescales much shorter than the time it would take to reach spin equilibrium.\nThis paper examines how accretion outbursts affect the time a star takes to\nreach spin equilibrium and its final equilibrium spin period. I consider\nseveral different models for angular momentum loss -- where angular momentum is\ncarried away in an outflow (the standard `propeller', centrifugally-launched\noutflow), where most angular momentum is lost via a stellar wind, and where it\nis mainly transferred back to the accretion disc (the `trapped disc'). For\ntransient sources, the `propeller' scenario leads to significantly longer times\nto reach spin equilibrium (often 10x), and shorter equilibrium spin periods\n(typically a factor of a few) than would be expected from spin equilibrium\narguments, while the `trapped disc' does not. Accretion outbursts also show a\nsmaller effect on spin down due to a stellar wind, mainly because in this case\nspin-down occurs for all accretion rates. The difference between a trapped disc\nand `propeller' scenario arises mainly from the ability of a trapped disc to\nefficiently spin the star down during quiescence. The results suggest that disc\ntrapping plays a significant role in the spin evolution of strongly magnetic\nstars.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 22 figures, submitted to MNRAS"]}]

We observe a considerably larger\nphotoconductivity when the phototransistors were measured via a four-terminal\nconfiguration when compared to a two-terminal one. For an incident laser power\nof 248 nW, we extract 18 A/W and ~4000% for the two-terminal responsivity (R)\nand the concomitant external quantum efficiency (EQE) respectively, when a bias\nvoltage Vds = 1 V and a gate voltage Vbg = 10 V are applied to the sample. R\nand EQE are observed to increase by 370% to ~85 A/W and ~20000% respectively,\nwhen using a four-terminal configuration. Thus, we conclude that previous\nreports have severely underestimated the optoelectronic response of transition\nmetal dichalcogenides, which in fact reveals a remarkable potential for\nphotosensing applications.\n","Comment: 6 Figures and Supporting Informations, (Accepted in \"2D Materials\")"]}]

Approximately 500,000 taxi trips are taken daily, carrying about\n800,000 passengers, and not including other livery firms such as Uber, Lyft or\nCarmel. Since 2008 yellow taxis have been able to process fare payments with\ncredit cards, and credits cards are a growing share of total fare payments.\nHowever, the use of credit cards to pay for taxi fares varies widely across\nneighborhoods, and there are strong correlations between cash payments for taxi\nfares and the presence of unbanked or underbanked populations. These issues are\nof concern for policymakers as approximately ten percent of households in the\ncity are unbanked, and in some neighborhoods the share of unbanked households\nis over 50 percent.

We also\nshow that solving the offline variant of all three problems, would require an\nexponential dependence of the form $\\tilde \\Omega(n^{k/2}/e^{k})$, under a\nnatural complexity-theoretic conjecture. Improving this lower bound for the\ncase of $k=4$ would imply a nontrivial lower bound for the famous Hopcroft's\nproblem. Moreover, solving the offline variant of affine SLR in $o(n^{k-1})$\nwould imply an upper bound of $o(n^d)$ for the problem of testing whether a\ngiven set of $n$ points in a $d$-dimensional space is degenerate. However, this\nis conjectured to require $\\Omega(n^d)$ time.\n"]}]

Troilite (FeS) is\nsystematically present and is the most abundant sulfide within the EH3\nchondrite chondrules. It is found either poikilitically enclosed in low-Ca\npyroxenes or scattered within the glassy mesostasis.

The chondrule mesostases contain high abundances of alkali and\nvolatile elements as well as silica. Our data suggest that most of the sulfides\nfound in EH3 chondrite chondrules are magmatic minerals that formed after the\ndissolution of S from a volatile-rich gaseous environment into the molten\nchondrules. Troilite formation occurred via sulfur solubility within Fe-poor\nchondrule melts followed by sulfide saturation, which causes an immiscible iron\nsulfide liquid to separate from the silicate melt. The FeS saturation started\nat the same time as or prior to the crystallization of low-Ca pyroxene during\nthe high temperature chondrule forming event(s).

We also propose that formation of the oldhamite\noccurred via the sulfide saturation of Fe-poor chondrule melts at moderate S\nconcentration due to the high degree of polymerization and the high Na-content\nof the chondrule melts, which allowed the activity of CaO in the melt to be\nenhanced.\n","Comment: 34 pages, 7 figures, 1 table"]}]

This peculiar grain growth and microstructure evolution could be\nattributed to the combination of the following two competing factors: (i)\nsuppression of O vacancies due to La doping leading to grain growth inhibition\nand (ii) enhancement of mechanism leading to nucleation and growth of 2-D\n(leafy) grains for La doping higher than 2 atomic % due to eutectic phenomena.\nDielectric permittivity measurements indicate that addition of La enhances\ndiffused phase transition in BTS, but its frequency dependence is observed only\nat 2 atomic % La doping. This signature relaxor behaviour and the increase in\nthe intensity of a particular Raman peak with La doping, as well as\nnon-saturated PE hysteresis loops confirm the presence of polar nano-regions\nfor 2 and 3 atomic % La doped BTS. However significant enhancement in\ndielectric permittivity could not be achieved due to reduced grain size.\n"]}]

Our own recent\nwork has identified iterative models (such as quantal cognitive hierarchy) as\nthe state of the art for predicting human play in unrepeated, simultaneous-move\ngames (Wright & Leyton-Brown 2012, 2016). Iterative models predict that agents\nreason iteratively about their opponents, building up from a specification of\nnonstrategic behavior called level-0. The modeler is in principle free to\nchoose any description of level-0 behavior that makes sense for the setting.\nHowever, almost all existing work specifies this behavior as a uniform\ndistribution over actions. In most games it is not plausible that even\nnonstrategic agents would choose an action uniformly at random, nor that other\nagents would expect them to do so. A more accurate model for level-0 behavior\nhas the potential to dramatically improve predictions of human behavior, since\na substantial fraction of agents may play level-0 strategies directly, and\nfurthermore since iterative models ground all higher-level strategies in\nresponses to the level-0 strategy. Our work considers models of the way in\nwhich level-0 agents construct a probability distribution over actions, given\nan arbitrary game. Using a Bayesian optimization package called SMAC (Hutter,\nHoos, & Leyton-Brown, 2010, 2011, 2012), we systematically evaluated a large\nspace of such models, each of which makes its prediction based only on general\nfeatures that can be computed from any normal form game.
