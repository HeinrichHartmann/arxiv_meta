It provides automatic\nconstructions of closed-form quadratic bounds or utilization bounds for a wide\nrange of applications in real-time systems under fixed-priority scheduling. The\nkey of the framework is a $k$-point schedulability test or a $k$-point response\ntime analysis that is based on the utilizations and the execution times of\n$k-1$ higher-priority tasks. The natural condition of k2Q is a quadratic form\nfor testing the schedulability or analyzing the response time. The response\ntime analysis and the schedulability analysis provided by the framework can be\nviewed as a \"blackbox\" interface that can result in sufficient\nutilization-based analysis. Since the framework is independent from the task\nand platform models, it can be applied to a wide range of applications.\n  We show the generality of k2Q by applying it to several different task\nmodels. k2Q produces better uniprocessor and/or multiprocessor schedulability\ntests not only for the traditional sporadic task model, but also more\nexpressive task models such as the generalized multi-frame task model and the\nacyclic task model. Another interesting contribution is that in the past,\nexponential-time schedulability tests were typically not recommended and most\nof time ignored due to high complexity. We have successfully shown that\nexponential-time schedulability tests may lead to good polynomial-time tests\n(almost automatically) by using the k2Q framework.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1505.02155;\n  text overlap with arXiv:1501.07084, a complete version of RTSS 2016"]}]

Items are ranked according to the probability that a\ngiven item beats a randomly chosen item, and ranking refers to partitioning the\nitems into sets of pre-specified sizes according to their scores. This notion\nof ranking includes as special cases the identification of the top-k items and\nthe total ordering of the items. We first analyze a sequential ranking\nalgorithm that counts the number of comparisons won, and uses these counts to\ndecide whether to stop, or to compare another pair of items, chosen based on\nconfidence intervals specified by the data collected up to that point. We prove\nthat this algorithm succeeds in recovering the ranking using a number of\ncomparisons that is optimal up to logarithmic factors.

It has\nbeen a long-standing open question as to whether or not imposing these\nparametric assumptions allows for improved ranking algorithms. For stochastic\ncomparison models, in which the pairwise probabilities are bounded away from\nzero, our second contribution is to resolve this issue by proving a lower bound\nfor parametric models.

However, topological partitioning is limited by the fact that (i)\nperformance of latency-sensitive (e.g., monitoring) SDN applications associated\nwith a given partition may be impacted by co-located compute-intensive (e.g.,\nroute computation) applications; (ii) simultaneously achieving low convergence\ntime and response times might be challenging; and (iii) communication between\ninstances of an application across partitions may increase latencies. To tackle\nthese issues, in this paper, we explore functional slicing, a complementary\napproach to scaling, where multiple SDN applications belonging to the same\ntopological partition may be placed in physically distinct servers. We present\nHydra, a framework for distributed SDN controllers based on functional slicing.\nHydra chooses partitions based on convergence time as the primary metric, but\nplaces application instances across partitions in a manner that keeps response\ntimes low while considering communication between applications of a partition,\nand instances of an application across partitions. Evaluations using the\nFloodlight controller show the importance and effectiveness of Hydra in\nsimultaneously keeping convergence times on failures small, while sustaining\nhigher throughput per partition and ensuring responsiveness to\nlatency-sensitive applications.\n","Comment: 8 pages"]}]

Due to the appearance of a critical\nexponent in the energy we must face a problem of lack of compactness. Indeed as\nshown by an example of Conti-De Lellis, a phenomenon of concentration of energy\ncan occur preventing the strong convergence in $W^{1,2}(\\Omega,\\mathbb{R}^3)$\nof a minimizing sequence along with the equi-integrability of the cofactors of\nthat sequence. We prove that this phenomenon can only take place on the axis of\nsymmetry of the domain. Thus if we consider domains that do not contain the\naxis of symmetry then minimizers do exist. We also provide a partial\ndescription of the lack of compactness in terms of Cartesian currents. Then we\nstudy the case where $\\Omega$ is not necessarily axisymmetric but the boundary\ndata is affine. In that case if we do not allow cavitation (nor in the interior\nneither at the boundary) then the affine extension is the unique minimizer,\nthat is, quadratic polyconvex energies are $W^{1,2}$-quasiconvex in our\nadmissible space. At last, in the case of an axisymmetric domain not containing\nits symmetry axis, we obtain for the first time the existence of weak solutions\nof the energy-momentum equations for $3$D neo-Hookean materials.\n","Comment: 27 pages"]}]

Consequently, events that trigger at\ncritical threshold levels of regulatory proteins exhibit stochasticity in their\ntiming. An important contributor to the noise in gene expression is translation\nbursts which correspond to randomness in number of proteins produced in a\nsingle mRNA lifetime. Modeling timing of an event as a first-passage time (FPT)\nproblem, we explore the effect of burst size distribution on event timing.\nTowards this end, the probability density function of FPT is computed for a\ngene expression model with burst size drawn from a generic non-negative\ndistribution. Analytical formulas for FPT moments are provided in terms of\nknown vectors and inverse of a matrix. The effect of burst size distribution is\ninvestigated by looking at how the feedback regulation strategy that minimizes\nnoise in timing around a given time deviates from the case when burst is\ndeterministic. Interestingly, results show that the feedback strategy for\ndeterministic burst case is quite robust to change in burst size distribution,\nand deviations from it are confined to about 20% of the optimal value.

This paper presents updates of two published analyses ([11,12]). The\nfirst analysis, which utilizes leptons emitted with large momentum transverse\nto a jet, was improved by means of a better algorithm for the vertex\nreconstuction and a new algorithm for flavour-tagging at production time. The\nsecond analysis, which utilizes D_s-lepton events, was improved by optimizing\nthe treatment of proper time resolution. No signal of B0_s oscillations was\nobserved and limits on the mass difference between the physical B0_s states\nwere obtained to be:\n  \\Delta m_s > 8.0 ps^{-1} at the 95% C.L. with a sensitivity of \\Delta m_s =\n9.1 ps^{-1} in the high p_t lepton analysis and \\Delta m_s > 4.9 ps^{-1} at the\n95% C.L. with a sensitivity of \\Delta m_s = 8.6 ps^{-1} in the D_s-lepton\nanalysis. Previously published results on these analyses are superseed. The\ncombination of these results with those obtained in other independent analyses\npreviously performed in DELPHI (D_s-hadron, exclusive B0_s, inclusive vertex)\ngives: \\Delta m_s > 8.5 ps^{-1} at the 95% C.L. with a sensitivity of \\Delta\nm_s = 12.0 ps^{-1}.\n","Comment: 36 pages, 14 figures, Accepted by Eur.

Using an\neffective Lagrangian description of the interactions between the observable\nfields and the SUSY breaking sector, it is shown how the conventional MSSM\npicture can be substantially modified. For instance, the Higgs potential has\nnon-negligible SUSY breaking quartic couplings that can modify completely the\npattern of electroweak breaking and the Higgs spectrum with respect to that of\nconventional MSSM-like models.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 4 figures, invited brief review for Modern Physics Letters\n  A"]}]
