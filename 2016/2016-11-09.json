To many practitioners, however, such strong\nattacks appear irrelevant.\n  In this paper, we introduce cross fault tolerance or XFT, a novel approach to\nbuilding reliable and secure distributed systems and apply it to the classical\nstate-machine replication (SMR) problem. In short, an XFT SMR protocol provides\nthe reliability guarantees of widely used asynchronous CFT SMR protocols such\nas Paxos and Raft, but also tolerates Byzantine faults in combination with\nnetwork asynchrony, as long as a majority of replicas are correct and\ncommunicate synchronously. This allows the development of XFT systems at the\nprice of CFT (already paid for in practice), yet with strictly stronger\nresilience than CFT --- sometimes even stronger than BFT itself.\n  As a showcase for XFT, we present XPaxos, the first XFT SMR protocol, and\ndeploy it in a geo-replicated setting. Although it offers much stronger\nresilience than CFT SMR at no extra resource cost, the performance of XPaxos\nmatches that of the state-of-the-art CFT protocols.\n"]}]

At low resolution, the octant and full 3D dynamics are qualitatively\nvery similar, but at high resolution, only the full 3D simulation exhibits the\nonset of explosion.\n","Comment: Submitted to ApJ"]}]

These tests are important\ndiagnostics for currently ongoing and planned cosmic shear surveys, as such\nbiases induce coherent shear patterns that can mimic and potentially bias the\ncosmic shear signal. The central idea of these tests is to determine the\naverage ellipticity of all galaxies with shape measurements in a grid in the\npixel plane. The distribution of the absolute values of these averaged\nellipticities can be compared to randomized catalogues; a difference points to\nsystematics in the data. In addition, we introduce a method to quantify the\nspatial correlation of the additive bias, which suppresses the contribution\nfrom cosmic shear and therefore eases the identification of a\nposition-dependent additive shear bias in the data. We apply these tests to the\npublicly available shear catalogues from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope\nLensing Survey (CFHTLenS) and the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) and find evidence\nfor a small but non-negligible residual additive bias at small scales. As this\nresidual bias is smaller than the error on the shear correlation signal at\nthose scales, it is highly unlikely that it causes a significant bias in the\npublished cosmic shear results of CFHTLenS. In CFHTLenS, the amplitude of this\nsystematic signal is consistent with zero in fields where the number of stars\nused to model the PSF is higher than average, suggesting that the\nposition-dependent additive shear bias originates from undersampled PSF\nvariations across the image.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 16 figures.

We were able to well constrain the lag spectrum with respect to the\nsoftest (0.3--2.3 keV) band: the delay shows increasing lag values reaching a\nmaximum delay of $\\sim$ 12 ms, between 6 and 6.4 keV. After this maximum, the\nvalue of the hard lag drops to 7 ms, followed by a recovery to a plateau at 9\nms for energies above 8 keV. NuSTAR data confirm this trend up to 30 keV, but\nthe measurements are statistically poorer, and therefore, less constraining.\nThe lag-energy pattern up to the discontinuity is well described by a\nlogarithmic function. Assuming this is due to a Compton reverberation\nmechanism, we derive a size for the Compton cloud $R_{\\rm{cc}}$ $\\sim$ 120\n$R_{\\rm g}$, consistent with previous estimates on the magnetospheric radius.\nIn this scenario, the sharp discontinuity at $\\sim$ 6.5 keV appears difficult\nto interpret and suggests the possible influence of the reflected component in\nthis energy range.

With a local loading mechanism, this can\nserve as a model for a one-dimensional interface separating the broken and\nunbroken parts of a solid in mode-I fracture. The interface can propagate\nthrough the system depending on the loading rate and disorder present in the\nfailure thresholds of the fibers. In the presence of a quasi-static drive, the\nintermittent dynamics of the interface mimic front propagation in disordered\nmedia. Such situations appear in diverse physical systems such as mode-I crack\npropagation, domain wall dynamics in magnets, charge density waves, contact\nline in wetting etc. We study the effect of the range of interaction, i.e. the\nneighborhood of the interface affected following a local perturbation, on the\nstatistics of the intermittent dynamics of the front. There exists a crossover\nfrom local to global behavior as the range of interaction grows and a\ncontinuously varying `universality' in the intermediate range. This means that\nthe interaction range is a relevant parameter of any resulting physics. This is\nparticularly relevant in view of the fact that there is a scatter in the\nexperimental observations of the exponents, in even idealized experiments on\nfracture fronts, and also a possibility in changing the interaction range in\nreal samples.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 7+2 figures"]}]

Such graphs are used to better understand the behaviour of\nphylogenetic methods and recommend parameter choices and diagnostic criteria.\nThe limiting factor in these analyses has been the difficulty in constructing\nsuch graphs for large numbers of trees.\n  This new algorithm is enabled by a change of perspective: rather than\nfocusing on the trees and checking for pairs of adjacencies, we enumerate the\npotential adjacencies themselves in the form of structures called \"agreement\nforests.\" Indeed, two trees are adjacent in the graph if, and only if, they\nshare an appropriately defined two-component agreement forest. To turn this\nobservation into an efficient algorithm, we develop two tools: SDLNewick, a\nunique string representation for agreement forests, and the AFContainer data\nstructure which efficiently stores tree adjacencies using such strings. This\ndata structure thus stores $O(n)$-size cliques of $O(n)$-size objects as single\n$O(n)$-size strings. We use the same idea and data structures to develop the\nfirst efficient algorithms for constructing the nearest-neighbor interchange\n(NNI) and tree bisection-and-reconnection (TBR) graphs.

However, unlike previous STM\nmeasurements, and differing from measurements probing the bulk, we detect two\nperpendicular orientations for the unidirectional CDWs with no directional\npreference for the in-plane crystal axes (a- or c-axis) and no noticeable\ndifference in wavevector magnitude. In addition, we find regions in which the\nbidirectional CDW states coexist. We propose that observation of two CDW states\nindicates a decoupling of the surface Te-layer from the rare-earth block layer\nbelow, and that strain variations in the Te surface layer drive the local CDW\ndirection to the specific unidirectional or, in rare occurrences, bidirectional\nCDW orders observed. This indicates that similar driving mechanisms for CDW\nformation in the bulk, where anisotropic lattice strain energy is important,\nare at play at the surface. In our bias-dependent measurements, we find no\ncontrast inversion for the CDW state between occupied and empty states. This\nfinding differs from other quasi 2-dimensional materials containing a hidden\n1-dimensional character which leads to a favorable Fermi surface nesting\nscenario. Our temperature-dependent measurements provide evidence for localized\nCDW formation above the bulk transition temperature, T$_{cdw}$.\n"]}]

This places\nNGC 1271 just 1.6-sigma above the near-linear M_bh-M_{sph,*} relation for\nearly-type galaxies. Therefore, past speculation that there may be a systematic\ndifference in the black hole scaling relations between compact massive\nearly-type galaxies with intermediate-scale disks, i.e. ES galaxies such as NGC\n1271, and early-type galaxies with either no substantial disk (E) or a\nlarge-scale disk (S0) is not strongly supported by NGC 1271. We additionally\n(i) show how ES galaxies fit naturally in the (`bulge'-to-total)-(morphological\ntype) diagram, while noting a complication with recent revisions to the\nHubble-Jeans tuning-fork diagram, (ii) caution about claims of over-massive\nblack holes in other ES galaxies if incorrectly modelled as S0 galaxies, and\n(iii) reveal that the compact massive spheroid in NGC 1271 has properties\nsimilar to bright bulges in other galaxies which have grown larger-scale disks.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ.

Pre-main sequence (PMS)\nstars in nearby young open clusters reveal a large spread in brightness.

However, difficulties in reddening correction, observational\nerrors, and systematic uncertainties introduced by imperfect evolutionary\nmodels for PMS stars, can result in an artificial age spread. Alternatively, we\ncan utilize Li abundance as a relative age indicator of PMS star to determine\nthe cluster formation timescale.

We use such\nrepresentation to discover potential pathologies at intermediate points in the\nflow that may prevent to reach the UV fixed point. We apply the method to an\n\"extremal\" deformation that naively would flow to a UV fixed point where the\noperator O would saturate the unitarity bound. We find that the UV fixed point\nis not conformal and that the deformed two-point function propagates unphysical\nmodes. We interpret the result as showing that the flow to the UV fixed point\ndoes not exist. This resolves a potential puzzle in the holographic\ninterpretation of the deformation.\n","Comment: 20 pages.

QSO B0218+357 is a gravitationally lensed blazar located at a\nredshift of 0.944. The gravitational lensing splits the emitted radiation into\ntwo components, spatially indistinguishable by gamma-ray instruments, but\nseparated by a 10-12 day delay. In July 2014, QSO B0218+357 experienced a\nviolent flare observed by the Fermi-LAT and followed by the MAGIC telescopes.\nAims. The spectral energy distribution of QSO B0218+357 can give information on\nthe energetics of z ~ 1 very high energy gamma- ray sources. Moreover the\ngamma-ray emission can also be used as a probe of the extragalactic background\nlight at z ~ 1. Methods. MAGIC performed observations of QSO B0218+357 during\nthe expected arrival time of the delayed component of the emission. The MAGIC\nand Fermi-LAT observations were accompanied by quasi-simultaneous optical data\nfrom the KVA telescope and X-ray observations by Swift-XRT. We construct a\nmultiwavelength spectral energy distribution of QSO B0218+357 and use it to\nmodel the source. The GeV and sub-TeV data, obtained by Fermi-LAT and MAGIC,\nare used to set constraints on the extragalactic background light. Results.\nVery high energy gamma-ray emission was detected from the direction of QSO\nB0218+357 by the MAGIC telescopes during the expected time of arrival of the\ntrailing component of the flare, making it the farthest very high energy\ngamma-ray sources detected to date. The observed emission spans the energy\nrange from 65 to 175 GeV. The combined MAGIC and Fermi-LAT spectral energy\ndistribution of QSO B0218+357 is consistent with current extragalactic\nbackground light models. The broad band emission can be modeled in the\nframework of a two zone external Compton scenario, where the GeV emission comes\nfrom an emission region in the jet, located outside the broad line region.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

Data\nwith typical correlator time and frequency resolutions can be compressed by a\nfactor of 6.4 for LOFAR and 5.3 for MWA observations with less than 1% added\nsystem noise. An implementation of the compression technique is released that\nprovides a Casacore storage manager and allows transparent encoding and\ndecoding. Encoding and decoding is faster than the read/write speed of typical\ndisks.\n  The technique can be used for LOFAR and MWA to reduce the archival space\nrequirements for storing observed data. Data from SKA-low will likely be\ncompressible by the same amount as LOFAR. The same technique can be used to\ncompress data from other telescopes, but a different bit-rate might be\nrequired.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A. 13 pages, 8 figures.

This makes P13 the second ultraluminous X-ray\nsource known to be powered by an accreting neutron star. The pulse period\nvaries between epochs, with a slow but persistent spin up over the 2013-2016\nperiod. This spin-up indicates a magnetic field of B ~ 1.5e12 G, typical of\nmany accreting pulsars.

The shapes of\nthe arcs suggest that they probably are segments of full rings. Ellipse fitting\nfor the two rings and inner disk yield a disk inclination i = 47 \\pm 2 degrees\nand find semi-major axes of 1.50 \\pm 0.01\" (278 au), 1.06 \\pm 0.01\" (196 au)\nand 0.30 \\pm 0.01\" (56 au), respectively.

This clearly indicates the absence of an\nantiferromagnetic (AF) coupling between adjacent magnetic layers for Cu layers\neven above 1.5 nm where the GMR effect occurs. The AMR behaviour at low spacer\nthicknesses indicates the presence of strong FM coupling (due to, e.g.,\npin-holes in the spacer and/or areas of the Cu layer where the layer thickness\nis very small). With increasing spacer thickness, the pin-hole density reduces\nand/or the layer thickness uniformity improves which both lead to a weakening\nof the FM coupling. This improvement in multilayer structure quality results in\na better separation of magnetic layers and the weaker coupling (or complete\nabsence of interlayer coupling) enables a more random magnetization orientation\nof adjacent layers, all this leading to an increase of the GMR. Coercive field\nand zero-field resistivity measurements as well as the results of a structural\nstudy reported earlier on the same multilayers provide independent evidence for\nthe microstructural features established here. The large GMR reported\npreviously on such Co/Cu multilayers at Cu layer thicknesses around 1 nm can be\nattributed to the presence of a fairly large superparamagnetic (SPM) fraction\nrather than being due to a strong AF coupling.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 6 figures"]}]

We investigate the problem by introducing a\ncomplexity-theoretic framework that allows us to shed some light on the role of\nrandomness in the LOCAL model. We define the SLOCAL model as a sequential\nversion of the LOCAL model. Our framework allows us to prove completeness\nresults with respect to the class of problems which can be solved efficiently\nin the SLOCAL model, implying that if any of the complete problems can be\nsolved deterministically in $\\log^{O(1)} n$ rounds in the LOCAL model, we can\ndeterministically solve all efficient SLOCAL-problems (including MIS and\n$(\\Delta+1)$-coloring) in $\\log^{O(1)} n$ rounds in the LOCAL model.

The problem admits a trivial zero-round randomized solution.

A central issue in GRB studies is the process whereby energy\nis released from the GRB engine. One scenario is the collapsar model, where the\nevolved stellar core promptly collapses to a black hole surrounded by a\nmassive, intermittently-accreting torus of nuclear density material. A second\nscenario is the supranova model, where the first step of a two-step collapse\nprocess leaves behind a rapidly rotating neutron star stabilized by rotation,\nwhich later collapses to a black hole while making the GRB. In the supranova\nmodel, a powerful pulsar wind lasting days to weeks after the supernova makes\ndistinctive signatures from the heating of the supernova remnant (SNR) shell,\nwhich should be discovered with Swift. This model also predicts nonstandard\nreddened excesses from the cooling SNR due to the range of delays between the\ntwo collapse events, contrary to observations of SN emissions from low redshift\nGRBs which favor the collapsar model. The observational basis for both models\nis critically reviewed. An outline of a GRB model is proposed where the second\ncollapse takes place within minutes to hours after the primary SN event, during\nwhich time loss of centrifugal support along the rotation axis of the neutron\nstar provides a relatively baryon-clean polar environment along which a newly\nformed, rapidly spinning black hole drives collimated baryon-dilute outflows.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 1 figure, in the Proceedings of the Tenth Marcel Grossmanm\n  Meeting on General Relativity, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (July 20-26, 2003)"]}]

Excitation of zonal\nmean flow by a modulated wave train is particularly strong in the modified HM\ncase. A local dispersion relation for a coherent wave train is calculated by\nlinearizing about a background mean flow and used to find the nonlinear\nfrequency shift by inserting the nonlinearly excited mean flow.
