By contrast, observations of the ionizing background find a very\nflat evolution from z~2-5, before falling precipitously at z~6. We resolve this\npuzzling discrepancy by pointing out that, at z~2-5, optically thick absorbers\nare associated with the same collapsed halos that host ionizing sources. Thus,\nan increasing abundance of galaxies is compensated for by a corresponding\nincrease in the absorber population, which moderates the instability in the\nionizing background.

We also present projected changes by these models by end of\ncentury (2061-2100) under extreme scenario RCP8.5. First, we assess their\nability to reproduce observed timings of the monsoon onset and the rate of\nrapid fractional accumulation (RFA slope) - a measure of seasonality within\nactive monsoon period. Secondly, we apply a threshold-independent seasonality\nindex (SI) - a multiplicative measure of precipitation and extent of its\nconcentration relative to the uniform distribution (relative entropy - RE). We\napply SI distinctly for monsoonal precipitation regime (MPR), westerly\nprecipitation regime (WPR) and annual precipitation regime. For present\nclimate, neither any single model nor the multi-model mean performs best in all\nchosen metrics. Models show overall a modest skill in suggesting right timings\nof the monsoon onset while the RFA slope is generally underestimated. One third\nof models fail to capture the monsoon signal over the Indus basin. Mostly, SI\nestimates for WPR are simulated higher than observed for all basins, while for\nMPR, it is simulated higher (lower) for Ganges and Brahmaputra (Indus and\nMekong) basins, following the pattern of overestimation (underestimation) of\nprecipitation. However, models are biased positive (negative) for RE estimates\nover Indus and Ganges (Brahmaputra and Mekong) basins, implying the extent of\nprecipitation concentration for MPR and number of dry days within WPR higher\n(lower) than observed for these basins. Under the RCP8.5 scenario, most of\nmodels project a slightly delayed monsoon onset, and a general increase in the\nRFA slope...\n","Comment: under review for Journal of Atmospheric Research"]}]

The emergence of this probability\ndistribution is ensured by the detailed balance of the transitions induced by\nthe interaction with the environment. Here we consider relaxation of an open\ncorrelated quantum system brought into contact with a reservoir in the vacuum\nstate. We refer to such a system as emissive since particles irreversibly\nevaporate into the vacuum.

A quantum statistical ensemble corresponding to the steady\nstate is characterized by different temperatures in the different sectors, in a\ncontrast to the Gibbs ensemble.

In particular, time-odd and tensor terms in these\nfunctionals are naturally present during the dynamical evolution, while being\nabsent or minimally important for most static calculations. The parameters of\nthese terms are determined by the requirement of Galilean invariance or local\ngauge invariance but their significance for the reaction dynamics have not been\nfully studied. This work addresses this question with emphasis on the tensor\nforce. Method: The full version of the Skyrme force, including terms arising\nonly from the Skyrme tensor force, is applied to the study of collisions within\na completely symmetry-unrestricted TDHF implementation. Results: We examine the\neffect on fusion thresholds with and without the tensor force terms and find an\neffect on the fusion threshold energy of the order several MeV. Details of the\ndistribution of the energy within terms in the energy density functional is\nalso discussed. Conclusions: Terms in the energy density functional linked to\nthe tensor force can play a non-negligible role in dynamic processes in nuclei,\nincluding those in which the terms do not affect ground state properties.\n","Comment: 6 pages"]}]

However, owing to two-way coupling, the\nfluid velocity is modified in the neighborhood of a particle, relative to its\nundisturbed value. This causes the computed Stokes drag force to be\nunderestimated in two-way coupled point-particle simulations. We develop\nestimates for the drag force error as function of the particle size relative to\nthe grid size. We then develop a correction method that estimates the\nundisturbed fluid velocity from the computed disturbed velocity field. The\ncorrection scheme is tested for a particle settling in an otherwise quiescent\nfluid and is found to reduce the error in computed settling velocity by an\norder of magnitude compared with common interpolation schemes.\n","Comment: Submitted to Journal of Computational Physics. 38 pages, 16 figures"]}]

Considerable attention has recently been focussed on\nanisotropic packings of frictional grains generated by shear deformation\nleading to shear jamming, which occurs below the jamming density for isotropic\npackings of frictionless grains. With the aim of disentangling the role of\nshear deformation induced structures and friction in generating shear jamming,\nwe study sheared assemblies of frictionless spheres computationally, over a\nwide range of densities, extending far below the isotropic jamming point.

Contrary to atomistic\nstudies reported in literature, the migration barrier in bcc Fe, Mo, and W is\n0.07, 0.07, and 0.08 eV respectively, always slightly higher than for a single\ninterstitial He (0.06 eV for all three). Configurations of a He-pair in fcc\nmetals are much more complicated, due to the stability closeness of different\ninterstitial sites for a single He atom. In both Cu and Pd, the migration of a\nHe-pair proceeds by moving one He at a time from one tetrahedral site to\nneighboring octahedral site; whereas in Pt the two He move simultaneously\nbecause the bridge interstitial site presents an extremely low barrier. The\nmigration barrier for a He-pair is 0.05, 0.15, and 0.04 eV for Cu, Pd, and Pt,\nslightly lower than (in Cu), or similar to (in Pd and Pt) a single He, which is\n0.08, 0.15, and 0.03 eV, respectively. The associative motions of a He-pair are\nensured by the strong He-He interactions in metals which are chemical\nbonding-like and can be described very well with Morse potentials.\n","Comment: 34 pages, 12 figures"]}]

Applied to the 2014 American Community\nSurvey, we find 3 emerging classes -- low, middle and higher income -- out of\nthe original 16 income categories. The higher-income households are\nproportionally more present in larger cities, while lower-income households are\nnot, invalidating the idea of an increased social polarisation. Finally, using\nthe density -- and not the distance to a center which is meaningless in\npolycentric cities -- we find that the richer class is overrepresented in high\ndensity zones, especially for larger cities.

The volcano has a large caldera with several active\ngeothermal areas. A peculiar cluster of long-period seismic events started on\nKatla's south flank in July 2011, during an unrest episode in the caldera that\nculminated in a glacier outburst. The seismic events were tightly clustered at\nshallow depth in the Gvendarfell area, 4 km south of the caldera, under a small\nglacier stream on the southern margin of M\\'yrdalsj\\\"okull. No seismic events\nwere known to have occurred in this area before. The most striking feature of\nthis seismic cluster is its temporal pattern, characterized by regular\nintervals between repeating seismic events, modulated by a seasonal variation.\nRemarkable is also the stability of both the time and waveform features over a\nlong time period, around 3.5 years. No comparable examples have been found in\nthe literature. Both volcanic and glacial processes can produce similar\nwaveforms and therefore have to be considered as potential seismic sources.\nDiscerning between these two causes is critical for monitoring glacier-clad\nvolcanoes and has been controversial at Katla. For this new seismic cluster on\nthe south flank we regard volcano-related processes as more likely than glacial\nones for the following reasons: 1) the seismic activity started during an\nunrest episode involving sudden melting of the glacier and a j\\\"okulhlaup; 2)\nthe glacier stream is small and stagnant; 3) the seismicity remains regular and\nstable for years; 4) there is no apparent correlation with short-term weather\nchanges, such as rain storms.

This can be explained in terms of the low energy\nHamiltonian at any point $\\vec{k}$ which has the same nature as that at the\nDirac point. From the nature of the eigenfunctions it follows that a weak long\nrange impurity will cause weak anti localization effects, which can be\nsuppressed, giving localization if the strength of impurities is sufficiently\nlarge to cause inter-valley scattering. The inter valley spacing $2|\\vec{k}|$\nincreases as one moves in from the band edge towards the band center, which is\nreflected in the behavior of $V_{th}$ and the mobility edge.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 11 figures"]}]

Several\ntractable instances of Hitting Set with a geometric or graph-theoretical flavor\nare known to have low VC-dimension. In set systems of bounded VC-dimension,\nHitting Set is known to admit efficient and almost optimal approximation\nalgorithms (Br\\\"onnimann and Goodrich, 1995; Even, Rawitz, and Shahar, 2005;\nAgarwal and Pan, 2014).\n  In contrast to these approximation-results, a low VC-dimension does not\nnecessarily imply tractability in the parameterized sense. In fact, we show\nthat Hitting Set is W[1]-hard already on inputs with VC-dimension 2, even if\nthe VC-dimension of the dual set system is also 2. Thus, Hitting Set is very\nunlikely to be fixed-parameter tractable even in this arguably simple case.\nThis answers an open question raised by King in 2010. For set systems whose\n(primal or dual) VC-dimension is 1, we show that Hitting Set is solvable in\npolynomial time.\n  To bridge the gap in complexity between the classes of inputs with\nVC-dimension 1 and 2, we use a measure that is more fine-grained than\nVC-dimension. In terms of this measure, we identify a sharp threshold where the\ncomplexity of Hitting Set transitions from polynomial-time-solvable to NP-hard.\nThe tractable class that lies just under the threshold is a generalization of\nEdge Cover, and thus extends the domain of polynomial-time tractability of\nHitting Set.\n","Comment: to be presented at ESA 2016"]}]

The method can be viewed as a high-order extension of the\nclassical finite element method proposed by Cai et al (1998)\n\\cite{CaiEtAl1998}, although the numerical implementation differs greatly.\nFeatures of the proposed spectral element method include: nodal Lagrange basis\nfunctions, a general quadrature-free approach and gradient recovery using\nglobal $L^2$ projections. The quartic nonlinear terms present in the Zakharov\nform of the free surface conditions can cause severe aliasing problems and\nconsequently numerical instability for marginally resolved or very steep waves.\nWe show how the scheme can be stabilised through a combination of\nover-integration of the Galerkin projections and a mild spectral filtering on a\nper element basis. This effectively removes any aliasing driven instabilities\nwhile retaining the high-order accuracy of the numerical scheme. The additional\ncomputational cost of the over-integration is found insignificant compared to\nthe cost of solving the Laplace problem. The model is applied to several\nbenchmark cases in two dimensions. The results confirm the high order accuracy\nof the model (exponential convergence), and demonstrate the potential for\naccuracy and speedup. The results of numerical experiments are in excellent\nagreement with both analytical and experimental results for strongly nonlinear\nand irregular dispersive wave propagation.

For this reason, their matter content\nshould be representative of the Universe as a whole, and thus their baryon\nfraction should be close to the Universal baryon fraction. We make use of the\nsample of the 100 brightest galaxy clusters discovered in the XXL Survey to\ninvestigate the fraction of baryons in the form of hot gas and stars in the\ncluster population. We measure the gas masses of the detected halos and use a\nmass--temperature relation directly calibrated using weak-lensing measurements\nfor a subset of XXL clusters to estimate the halo mass. We find that the\nweak-lensing calibrated gas fraction of XXL-100-GC clusters is substantially\nlower than was found in previous studies using hydrostatic masses. Our best-fit\nrelation between gas fraction and mass reads $f_{\\rm\ngas,500}=0.055_{-0.006}^{+0.007}\\left(M_{\\rm\n500}/10^{14}M_\\odot\\right)^{0.21_{-0.10}^{+0.11}}$.

Our measurements require a hydrostatic bias\n$1-b=M_X/M_{\\rm WL}=0.72_{-0.07}^{+0.08}$ to match the gas fraction obtained\nusing lensing and hydrostatic equilibrium. Comparing our gas fraction\nmeasurements with the expectations from numerical simulations, our results\nfavour an extreme feedback scheme in which a significant fraction of the\nbaryons are expelled from the cores of halos. This model is, however, in\ncontrast with the thermodynamical properties of observed halos, which might\nsuggest that weak-lensing masses are overestimated. We note that a mass bias\n$1-b=0.58$ as required to reconcile Planck CMB and cluster counts should\ntranslate into an even lower baryon fraction, which poses a major challenge to\nour current understanding of galaxy clusters.

The effect relies on the interaction of magnetic\nfluctuations with a mean shear flow, meaning the saturated state of the\nsmall-scale dynamo can drive a large-scale dynamo -- in some sense the inverse\nof dynamo quenching. The dynamo is nonhelical, with the mean-field $\\alpha$\ncoefficient zero, and is caused by the interaction between an off-diagonal\ncomponent of the turbulent resistivity and the stretching of the large-scale\nfield by shear flow. Following up on previous numerical and analytic work, this\npaper presents further details of the numerical evidence for the effect, as\nwell as an heuristic description of how magnetic fluctuations can interact with\nshear flow to produce the required electromotive force. The pressure response\nof the fluid is fundamental to this mechanism, which helps explain why the\nmagnetic effect is stronger than its kinematic cousin, and the basic idea is\nrelated to the well-known lack of turbulent resistivity quenching by magnetic\nfluctuations. As well as being interesting for its applications to general high\nReynolds number astrophysical turbulence, where strong small-scale magnetic\nfluctuations are expected to be prevalent, the magnetic shear-current effect is\na likely candidate for large-scale dynamo in the unstratified regions of\nionized accretion disks.

Gas hydrodynamical effects can additionally strip gas\nand dust from galaxies. The properties of the ICL can therefore help constrain\nthe physical processes at work in clusters by serving as a fossil record of the\ninteraction history. The present study is designed to characterise this ICL in\na ~10^14 M_odot and z~0.53 cluster of galaxies from imaging and spectroscopic\npoints of view. By applying a wavelet-based method to CFHT Megacam and WIRCAM\nimages, we detect significant quantities of diffuse light. These sources were\nthen spectroscopically characterised with MUSE. MUSE data were also used to\ncompute redshifts of 24 cluster galaxies and search for cluster substructures.\nAn atypically large amount of ICL has been detected in this cluster. Part of\nthe detected diffuse light has a very weak optical stellar component and\napparently consists mainly of gas emission, while other diffuse light sources\nare clearly dominated by old stars. Furthermore, emission lines were detected\nin several places of diffuse light. Our spectral analysis shows that this\nemission likely originates from low-excitation parameter gas. The stellar\ncontribution to the ICL is about 2.3x10^9 yrs old even though the ICL is not\ncurrently forming a large number of stars. On the other hand, the contribution\nof the gas emission to the ICL in the optical is much greater than the stellar\ncontribution in some regions, but the gas density is likely too low to form\nstars. These observations favour ram pressure stripping, turbulent viscous\nstripping, or supernovae winds as the origin of the large amount of\nintracluster light. Since the cluster appears not to be in a major merging\nphase, we conclude that ram pressure stripping is the most plausible process\nthat generates the observed ICL sources.\n","Comment: Accepted in A&A, english enhanced, figure location different than in\n  the A&A version due to different style files, shortened abstract"]}]

Our\nstudies show that the slow extraction at the half-integer resonance by using\nanti-symmetric sextupole field has some advantages compared to the normal\nsextupole field, and the latter is widely used in the slow extraction method.\nOne of them is that it can work at a more distant tune from the resonance, so\nthat it can reduce significantly the intensity variation of the extracted beam\nwhich is mainly caused by the ripples of magnet power supplies. The studies by\nboth the Hamiltonian theory and numerical simulations show that the stable\nregion at the proximity of the half-integer resonance by anti-symmetric\nsextupole field is much smaller and flatter than the one by standard sextupole\nfield at the third-order resonance.

In order\nto investigate these possibilities, we perform first a theoretical analysis of\nthe non-equilibrium response function in this context, aided by one simple\nnumerical model of the Hydrogen atom. Then, we proceed to investigate the\nfeasibility of using time-dependent density-functional theory as a means to\nimplement, theoretically, this absorption-optimization idea, for more complex\natoms or molecules. We conclude that the proposed idea could in principle be\nbrought to the laboratory: tailored pump pulses can excite systems into\nlight-absorbing states. However, we also highlight the severe numerical and\ntheoretical difficulties posed by the problem: large-scale non-equilibrium\nquantum dynamics are cumbersome, even with TDDFT, and the shortcomings of\nstate-of-the-art TDDFT functionals may still be serious for these\nout-of-equilibrium situations.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 7 figures"]}]

The\nelectromagnetic bandgap (EBG) effect in metasurfaces prevents all surface modes\nfrom propagating in a certain frequency band. While metasurfaces provide a\nnumber of important applications in microwave antennas and antenna arrays,\ntheir features are also highly suitable for MRI applications. In this work we\nmanufacture and experimentally study finite samples based on mushroom-type EBG\nmetasurfaces and employ them for suppression of inter-element coupling in\ndipole transmit coil arrays for body imaging at 7T. We show experimentally that\nemployment of the samples EBG leads to reduction of coupling between adjacent\nclosely-spaced dipole antenna elements of a 7T transmit/receive body array,\nwhich reduces scattering losses in neighboring channels and thereby improves\nthe B1+ efficiency. The setup consists of two fractionated dipole antennas\npreviously designed by the authors for body imaging at 7 Tesla. These are\nplaced on top of a body-mimicking phantom and equipped with the manufactured\nfinite-size sample of the metasurface tuned to have EBG properties at the\nLarmor frequency of 298 MHz. To improve the detection range of the B1+ field\ndistribution of the top elements, four additional elements were positioned\nalong the bottom side of the phantom. Scattering matrix measurements show that\ncoupling between the two top elements is indeed reduced while the measurements\nperformed on a 7T MRI machine confirm the array's B1+ efficiency improvement\ndue to reduced scattering losses. This study provides a tool for the decoupling\nof dipole antennas in ultrahigh field transmit arrays, possibly resulting in\ndenser element placement and/or larger subject-element spacing.\n"]}]

By\nconsidering an inhomogeneous mean flow effect on turbulence, it is shown that\nturbulent cross helicity (velocity--magnetic-field correlation) should enter\nthe expression of turbulent electromotive force as the coupling coefficient for\nthe mean absolute vorticity. The inclusion of the cross-helicity effect makes\nthe present model different from the current $\\alpha$--$\\Omega$-type models\nmainly in two points. First, in addition to the usual $\\alpha$ (helicity\neffect) and $\\beta$ (turbulent magnetic diffusivity), we consider the $\\gamma$\ncoefficient (cross-helicity effect) as a key ingredient of the dynamo process.\nSecond, unlike the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ coefficients, which are often treated\nas an adjustable parameter in the current studies, the spatiotemporal evolution\nof $\\gamma$ coefficient is solved simultaneously with the mean magnetic-field\nequations. The basic scenario is as follows: In the presence of turbulent cross\nhelicity, the toroidal field is induced by the toroidal rotation in mediation\nby the turbulent cross helicity. The $\\alpha$ effect generates the poloidal\nfield from the toroidal one. This poloidal field produces a turbulent cross\nhelicity whose sign is opposite to the original one. Then a cycle of reversal\ncompletes. Eigenvalue analyses of the simplest possible present model give a\nbutterfly diagram, which confirms the above scenario as well as the\nequator-ward migrations, the phase relationship between the cross helicity and\nmagnetic fields, etc. These results suggest that the oscillation of the\nturbulent cross helicity is a key for the activity cycle. The reversal of the\nturbulent cross helicity is not the result of the magnetic-field reversal, but\nthe cause of the latter. This new model is expected to open up the possibility\nof the mean-field or turbulence closure dynamo approaches.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 6 figures"]}]

We find that\n$SO(3)\\times SO(3)$, $SO(3,1)$ and $SL(3,\\mathbb{R})$ gauge groups admit a\nmaximally supersymmetric $AdS_4$ critical point. The $SO(2,1)\\times SO(2,2)$\ngauge group admits a supersymmetric Minkowski vacuum while the remaining gauge\ngroups admit both half-supersymmetric domain wall vacua and $AdS_4$ vacua with\ncompletely broken supersymmetry. For the $SO(3)\\times SO(3)$ gauge group, there\nexists another supersymmetric $N=3$ $AdS_4$ critical point with\n$SO(3)_{\\textrm{diag}}$ symmetry. We explicitly give a detailed study of\nvarious holographic RG flows between $AdS_4$ critical points, flows to\nnon-conformal theories and supersymmetric domain walls in each gauge group. The\nresults provide gravity duals of $N=3$ Chern-Simons-Matter theories in three\ndimensions.\n","Comment: 29 pages, no figures, typos corrected and a few references added"]}]

The available chiral $NN$ wave\nfunctions are constructed with a cutoff comparable with the momentum transfer\nscale inherent in pion production reactions. Hence, a significant portion of\nthe dynamical intermediate-range physics is thereby cut off by them. On the\nother hand, the NNLO amplitudes evaluated with phenomenological wave functions\nappear to be largely independent of the $NN$ model used and give corrections to\nthe dominant leading order contributions as expected from dimensional analysis.\nThe result gives support to the counting scheme used to classify the pion\nproduction operators, which is a precondition for a reliable investigation of\nthe chirally suppressed neutral pion production. The explicit inclusion of the\n$\\Delta(1232)$ is found to be important but smaller than expected due to\ncancellations.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables"]}]

In this paper, we present a rigorous formulation of the transition\nbetween the discrete, where plastic flow is resolved at the scale of individual\ndislocations, and the continuum, where dislocations are represented by\ndensities. First, we focus on the underlying coarse-graining procedure and show\nthat the emerging correlation-induced stresses are scale-dependent. Each of\nthese stresses can be expanded into the sum of two components. The first one\ndepends on the local values of the dislocation densities and always opposes the\nsum of the applied stress and long-range mean field stress generated by the\ngeometrically necessary dislocation (GND) density; this stress acts as a\nfriction stress. The second component depends on the local gradients of the\ndislocation densities and is inherently associated to a translation of the\nelastic domain; therefore, it acts as a back-stress. We also show that these\nfriction and back- stresses contain symmetry-breaking components that make the\nlocal stress experienced by dislocations to depend on the sign of their Burgers\nvector.\n"]}]

The resulting variation profile, is much larger than the\ndiscrepancy between different atomic codes, agrees qualitatively with the\nmissing opacity profile, recovers about half of the missing opacity nearby the\nconvection boundary and has a little effect in the internal regions. Since it\nis hard to estimate quantitatively the uncertainty in the Stark widths, we show\nthat an increase of all line widths by a factor of about 100 recovers\nquantitatively the missing opacity. These results emphasize the possibility\nthat photoexcitation processes are not modeled properly, and more specifically,\nhighlight the need for a better theoretical characterization of the line\nbroadening phenomena at stellar interior conditions and of the uncertainty due\nto the way it is implemented by atomic codes.\n","Comment: Version accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

In such\nsystems, the dissipation of the kinetic energy of tidal flows in the host star\nmay modify its rotational evolution and shape the orbital architecture of the\nsurrounding planetary system. In this context, recent works demonstrated that\nthe amplitude of this dissipation can vary over several orders of magnitude as\na function of stellar mass, age and rotation. In addition, the stellar rotation\nevolution strongly impacts angular momentum exchanges within star-planet\nsystems. Therefore, it is now necessary to take into account the structural and\nrotational evolution of stars when studying the orbital evolution of close-in\nplanets. The presence of planets may also modify the rotation of the host stars\nand as a consequence their evolution, magnetic activity and mixing.

Consequently, the\norbital migration of the planet is now more pronounced and depends more on the\nstellar mass, rotation and age.

Typically overlooked in the\nliterature, in this paper we aim to quantify the impact of the opacity\nbroadening effects on the current interpretation of the CO suprathermal line\nprofiles. Without any additional contributions to the gas velocity field, a\nlarge fraction of the apparently supersonic (${\\cal M}\\sim$2-3) linewidths\nmeasured in both $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO (J=1-0) lines can be explained by the\nsaturation of their corresponding sonic-like, optically-thin C$^{18}$O\ncounterparts assuming standard isotopic fractionation.

Our results demonstrate that most of the suprathermal $^{12}$CO and\n$^{13}$CO linewidths could be primarily created by a combination of opacity\nbroadening effects and multiple gas velocity components blended in these\nsaturated emission lines.

The classical \"planetesimal\" accretion scenario for the formation of\nplanets has recently evolved with the idea that \"pebbles\", centimeter- to\nmeter-sized icy grains migrating in protoplanetary disks, can control\nplanetesimal and/or planetary growth.\n  Aims. We investigate how pebble accretion depends on disk properties and\naffects the formation of planetary systems\n  Methods. We construct analytical models of pebble accretion onto planetary\nembryos that consistently account for the mass and orbital evolution of the\npebble flow and reflect disk structure.\n  Results. We derive simple formulas for pebble accretion rates in the\nso-called \"settling\" regime for planetary embryos with more than 100 km in\nsize. For relatively smaller embryos or in outer disk regions, the accretion\nmode is 3D, meaning that the thickness of the pebble flow must be taken into\naccount, and resulting in an accretion rate that is independent of the embryo\nmass. For larger embryos or in inner regions, the accretion is in a 2D mode,\ni.e., the pebble disk may be considered to be infinitely thin. We show that the\nradial dependence of the pebble accretion rata is different (even the sign of\nthe power-law exponent changes) for different disk conditions such as the disk\nheating source (viscous heating or stellar irradiation), the drag law (Stokes\nor Epstein, and weak or strong coupling), and in the 2D or 3D accretion modes.\nWe also discuss the effect of the sublimation/destruction of icy pebbles inside\nthe snow line.\n  Conclusions. Pebble accretion easily produces a large diversity of planetary\nsystems.

We show that if a quantum emitter is\ndriven by a weak monochromatic laser, Raman coherence is determined exclusively\nby spin coherence, allowing for a direct determination of spin $T_2^*$ time.\nWhen combined with coherence measurements on Rayleigh scattered photons, our\ntechnique enables us to identify coherent and incoherent contributions to\nresonance fluorescence, and to minimize the latter.

Case (ii) could be seen in a coordinated radio-optical\nsurveys, \\eg\\ by the Palomar Transient Factory in a 60-second frame as a\ntransient object of $m=15-20$ magnitude with an expected optical detection rate\nof about 0.1~hr$^{-1}$, an order of magnitude higher than in radio. Shallow,\nbut large-area sky surveys such as ASAS-SN and EVRYSCOPE could also detect\nprompt optical flashes from the more powerful Lorimer-burst clones. The best\nconstraints on the optical-to-radio power for this kind of emission could be\nprovided by future observations with facilities like LSST. Case (iii) might be\nseen in relatively rare cases that the relativistically ejected magnetic blob\nis moving along the line of sight.\n"]}]

Here we consider the eigenfrequencies of nineteen\nlow-luminosity red giant stars selected by Corsaro et al. (2015) for a detailed\npeak-bagging analysis. Our objective is to obtain stellar parameters by using\nindividual mode frequencies and spectroscopic information. We use a forward\nmodelling technique based on a minimization procedure combining the frequencies\nof the p modes, the period spacing of the dipolar modes, and the spectroscopic\ndata. Consistent results between the forward modelling technique and values\nderived from the seismic scaling relations are found but the errors derived\nusing the former technique are lower. The average error for log g is 0.002 dex,\ncompared to 0.011 dex from the frequency of maximum power and 0.10 dex from the\nspectroscopic analysis. Relative errors in the masses and radii are on average\n2 and 0.5 per cent respectively, compared to 3 and 2 per cent derived from the\nscaling relations. No reliable determination of the initial helium abundances\nand the mixing length parameters could be made. Finally, for our grid of models\nwith a given input physics, we found that low-mass stars require higher values\nof the overshooting parameter.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A. 10 pages and 14 figures"]}]

The classical algorithms are modified by\nthe use of $m$ independent random walkers in the energy landscape to calculate\nthe density of states (DOS). The Ising model is used to show the convergence\nproperties in the calculation of the DOS, as well as the critical temperature,\nwhile the calculation of the number $\\pi$ by multiple dimensional integration\nis used in the continuum approximation. In each case, the error is obtained\nseparately for each walker at a fixed time, $t$; then, the average over $m$\nwalkers is performed. It is observed that the error goes as $1/\\sqrt{m}$.\nHowever, if the number of walkers increases above a certain critical value\n$m>m_x$, the error reaches a constant value (i.e. it saturates). This occurs\nfor both algorithms; however, it is shown that for a given system, the $1/t$\nalgorithm is more efficient and accurate than the similar version of the WL\nalgorithm. It follows that it makes no sense to increase the number of walkers\nabove a critical value $m_x$, since it does not reduces the error in the\ncalculation. Therefore, the number of walkers does not guarantee convergence.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 12 figures, Regular Article"]}]

The safety of the train traffic relies thereby on\napplication data correctness, errors inside them can cause safety issues such\nas derailments or collisions. Given the high level of safety required by such a\nsystem, its verification is a critical concern.

We constructed broad-band, optical/UV/X-ray\nspectral energy distributions over three X-ray flux intervals. We fitted them\nwith a model which accounts for the disc and the X-ray coronal emission and the\nwarm absorber (well established in this source). The three flux spectra are\nwell fitted by the model we considered. The disc inner temperature remains\nconstant at ~2 eV, while X-rays are variable both in spectral slope and\nnormalization. The absorber covers almost 90% of the central source. It is\noutflowing with a velocity less than 2.3*10^4 km/s (3sigma upper limit), and\nhas a column density of ~10^23.2. Its ionization parameter varies by a factor\nof 1.6, and it is in photo-ionizing equilibrium with the ionizing flux. It is\nlocated at a distance of less than 0.35 pc from the central source and its\nrelative thickness, DR/R is less than 0.1. The absorber' s ionization parameter\nvariations can explain the larger than average amplitude of the X-ray\nvariations. The absence of optical/UV variations (consistent with the high\nblack hole mass estimate) argues against the presence of inward propagating\ndisc fluctuations and strong X-ray illumination of the disc (in agreement with\nthe low ratio of X-ray over the bolometric luminosity of ~20-35). We estimate\nan upper limit for the mass outflow of ~5 solar masses per year (~2.3 times the\nEddington mass accretion rate). If the outflow rate is indeed that high, then\nit must be a short-lived episode in the quasar's life time. Finally, we\nestimate an upper limit for the kinetic power of the outflow of ~1.4*10^43\nergs/s. This outflow cannot deploy significant mechanical energy to the\nsurrounding ISM of the quasar's host galaxy, but is sufficient to heat the ISM\nto 10^7 K and to produce a fast decline to the star formation rate of the\ngalaxy.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication by A&A"]}]

It has to be compared to theoretical estimates for the\nproduction of 92Nb to determine the time between the last nucleosynthesis event\nbefore the formation of the early solar system.\n  Purpose: The influence of a low-lying short-lived isomer on the\nnucleosynthesis of 92Nb is analyzed. The thermal coupling between the ground\nstate and the isomer via so-called intermediate states affects the production\nand survival of 92Nb.\n  Method: The properties of the lowest intermediate state in 92Nb are known\nfrom experiment. From the lifetime of the intermediate state and from its decay\nbranchings, the transition rate from the ground state to the isomer and the\neffective half-life of 92Nb are calculated as a function of the temperature.\n  Results: The coupling between the ground state and the isomer is strong. This\nleads to thermalization of ground state and isomer in the nucleosynthesis of\n92Nb in any explosive production scenario and almost 100% survival of 92Nb in\nits ground state. However, the strong coupling leads to a temperature-dependent\neffective half-life of 92Nb which makes the 92Nb survival very sensitive to\ntemperatures as low as about 8 keV, thus turning 92Nb at least partly into a\nthermometer.\n  Conclusions: The low-lying isomer in 92Nb does not affect the production of\n92Nb in explosive scenarios. In retrospect this validates all previous studies\nwhere the isomer was not taken into account.

Moreover, the\ninteraction mechanisms that have been proposed, magnetic interaction and tidal\ninteraction, exhibit a very different dependence on orbital separation between\nthe star and the planet. A detection of activity enhancement and\ncharacterization of its dependence on planetary orbital distance can, in\nprinciple, allow us to characterize the physical mechanism behind the activity\nenhancement.\n  Methods: We used the HARPS-N spectrograph to measure the stellar activity\nlevel of HD 80606 during the planetary periastron passage and compared the\nactivity measured to that close to apastron. Being characterized by an\neccentricity of 0.93 and an orbital period of 111 days, the system's extreme\nvariation in orbital separation makes it a perfect target to test our\nhypothesis.\n  Results: We find no evidence for a variation in the activity level of the\nstar as a function of planetary orbital distance, as measured by all activity\nindicators employed log($R'_{HK}$), H$_\\alpha$, NaI, and HeI.

The\nstraightforward explanation for the non-detection is the absence of interaction\nas a result of a low magnetic field strength on either the planet or the star\nand of the low level of tidal interaction between the two.

In this framework, if the ecological conditions are defined in\nterms of the mean starvation time (i.e. time between onset of starvation and\nthe arrival of a new food pulse), a single genotype dominates each environment,\nwhich is inconsistent with the huge genetic diversity observed in nature. We\ninvestigate whether seasonality, represented by a periodic alternation in the\nmean starvation times, allows the coexistence of several strategies.

We find that seasonality, which we model via two seasons, induces a\ntemporal storage effect that can promote the stable coexistence of multiple\ngenotypes. Two conditions need to be met. First, the distributions of\nstarvation times in each season cannot overlap in order to create two well\ndifferentiated habitats within the year. Second, numerous growth-starvation\ncycles have to occur during each season to allow well-adapted strains to grow\nand survive the subsequent unfavorable period.

We\nthen recalibrate all SFR indicators to provide new, robust and consistent\nluminosity-to-SFR calibrations, finding that the most consistent slopes and\nnormalisations of the SFR-M* relations are obtained when recalibrated using the\nradiation transfer method of Popescu et al.

A simple pulsatile output form is utilized to reproduce the\nmost relevant cardiac features with a minimum number of parameters associated\nwith left ventricle dynamics. Another source of critical uncertainty is the\nspatial heterogeneity of the aortic compliance which plays a key role in the\npropagation and damping of pulse waves generated at each cardiac cycle. A\ncontinuous representation of the aortic stiffness in the form of a generic\nrandom field of prescribed spatial correlation is then considered. Resorting to\na stochastic sparse pseudospectral method, we investigate the spatial\nsensitivity of the pulse pressure and waves reflection magnitude with respect\nto the different model uncertainties. Results indicate that uncertainties\nrelated to the shape and magnitude of the prescribed inlet flow in the proximal\naorta can lead to potent variation of both the mean value and standard\ndeviation of blood flow velocity and pressure dynamics due to the interaction\nof different wave propagation and reflection features.

To correctly understand\nthe elastic modulus $M$, it is therefore necessary to take into account not\nonly the affine modulus $M_A$, but also the non-affine modulus $M_N$ that\narises from the non-affine deformation. In the present work, we study the bulk\n($M=K$) and shear ($M=G$) moduli in static jammed particulate packings over a\nrange of packing fractions $\\varphi$. One novelty of this work is to elucidate\nthe contribution of each vibrational mode to the non-affine $M_N$ through a\nmodal decomposition of the displacement and force fields. In the vicinity of\nthe (un)jamming transition, $\\varphi_{c}$, the vibrational density of states,\n$g(\\omega)$, shows a plateau in the intermediate frequency regime above a\ncharacteristic frequency $\\omega^\\ast$.

They are believed\nto form in the final stages of galaxy mergers, and then harden by slingshot\nejections of passing stars. However, evolution via the slingshot mechanism may\nbe ineffective if the reservoir of interacting stars is not readily\nreplenished, and the binary shrinking may come to a halt at roughly a parsec\nseparation. Recent simulations suggest that the departure from spherical\nsymmetry, naturally produced in merger remnants, leads to efficient loss cone\nrefilling, preventing the binary from stalling. However, current N-body\nsimulations able to accurately follow the evolution of BHBs are limited to very\nmodest particle numbers. Brownian motion may artificially enhance the loss cone\nrefilling rate in low-N simulations, where the binary encounters a larger\npopulation of stars due its random motion. Here we study the significance of\nBrownian motion of BHBs in merger remnants in the context of the final parsec\nproblem. We simulate mergers with various particle numbers (from 8k to 1M) and\nwith several density profiles. Moreover, we compare simulations where the BHB\nis fixed at the centre of the merger remnant with simulations where the BHB is\nfree to random walk. We find that Brownian motion does not significantly affect\nthe evolution of BHBs in simulations with particle numbers in excess of one\nmillion, and that the hardening measured in merger simulations is due to\ncollisionless loss cone refilling.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables in Monthly Notices of the Royal\n  Astronomical Society 2016"]}]
