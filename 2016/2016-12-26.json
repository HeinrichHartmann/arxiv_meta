We show that this behavior, which holds for all\n$7\\leq n\\leq 14$, arises from weak entropic forces among the particles. Strong\ndirectional entropic forces align polygons with fewer than seven edges and\nimpose local order in the fluid. These forces can enhance or suppress the\ndiscontinuous character of the transition depending on whether the local order\nin the fluid is compatible with the local order in the solid. As a result,\nsystems of triangles, squares, and hexagons exhibit a KTHNY-type continuous\ntransition between fluid and hexatic, tetratic, and hexatic phases,\nrespectively, and a continuous transition from the appropriate \"x\"-atic to the\nsolid.

Previous systems have applied out-of-core\nprocessing techniques from the memory/disk boundary to the cache/DRAM boundary.\nHowever, we find that blindly applying such techniques is ineffective because\nof the much smaller performance gap between DRAM and cache. We present two\ntechniques that take advantage of the cache with minimal or no instruction\noverhead. The first, frequency based clustering, groups together frequently\naccessed vertices to improve the utilization of each cache line with no runtime\noverhead. The second, CSR segmenting, partitions the graph to restrict all\nrandom accesses to the cache, makes all DRAM access sequential, and merges\npartition results using a very low overhead cache-aware merge. Both techniques\ncan be easily implemented on top of optimized graph frameworks. Our techniques\ncombined give speedups of up to 4 $\\times$ for PageRank, Label Propagation and\nCollaborative Filtering, and 2 $\\times$ for Betweenness Centrality over the\nbest published results\n"]}]

The spin-Seebeck voltage is induced by\nTI surface-state scattering off the non-equilibrium magnon population at the\nsurface of the semi-infinite thermally driven FI. Our theory is readily\ngeneralized to spin-Seebeck voltages in any two-dimensional conductor that is\nexchange coupled to the surface of a FI.

In terms of the required sample\nsize, earlier work revealed a large gap between estimation with unbounded\ncomputational resources (using, for instance, tensor nuclear norm minimization)\nand polynomial-time algorithms. Among the latter, the best statistical\nguarantees have been proved, for third-order tensors, using the sixth level of\nthe sum-of-squares (SOS) semidefinite programming hierarchy (Barak and Moitra,\n2014). However, the SOS approach does not scale well to large problem\ninstances. By contrast, spectral methods --- based on unfolding or matricizing\nthe tensor --- are attractive for their low complexity, but have been believed\nto require a much larger sample size.\n  This paper presents two main contributions. First, we propose a new\nunfolding-based method, which outperforms naive ones for symmetric $k$-th order\ntensors of rank $r$. For this result we make a study of singular space\nestimation for partially revealed matrices of large aspect ratio, which may be\nof independent interest.

Human learning solves this in part by leveraging a rich, shared,\nupdateable world model. Such scalability requires modularity: updating part of\nthe world model should not impact unrelated parts. We have argued that such\nmodularity will require both \"correctability\" (so that errors can be corrected\nwithout introducing new errors) and \"interpretability\" (so that we can\nunderstand what components need correcting).\n  To achieve this, one could attempt to adapt state of the art SML systems to\nbe interpretable and correctable; or one could see how far the simplest\npossible interpretable, correctable learning methods can take us, and try to\ncontrol the limitations of SML methods by applying them only where needed. Here\nwe focus on the latter approach and we investigate two main ideas: \"Teacher\nAssisted Learning\", which leverages crowd sourcing to learn language; and\n\"Factored Dialog Learning\", which factors the process of application\ndevelopment into roles where the language competencies needed are isolated,\nenabling non-experts to quickly create new applications.\n  We test these ideas in an \"Automated Personal Assistant\" (APA) setting, with\ntwo scenarios: that of detecting user intent from a user-APA dialog; and that\nof creating a class of event reminder applications, where a non-expert\n\"teacher\" can then create specific apps. For the intent detection task, we use\na dataset of a thousand labeled utterances from user dialogs with Cortana, and\nwe show that our approach matches state of the art SML methods, but in addition\nprovides full transparency: the whole (editable) model can be summarized on one\nhuman-readable page.

However, by carefully estimating the adiabatic preparation time\nfor Lindbladians describing thermalization in the low temperature limit, we\nshow that there is, after all, room for an adiabatic speedup over relaxation.\nTo test the analytically derived bounds for the adiabatic preparation time and\nthe relaxation time, we numerically study three models: a dissipative\nquasi-free fermionic chain, a single qubit coupled to a thermal bath, and the\n\"spike\" problem of $n$ qubits coupled to a thermal bath. Via these models we\nfind that the answer to the \"which wins\" question depends for each model on the\ntemperature and the system-bath coupling strength. In the case of the \"spike\"\nproblem we find that relaxation during the adiabatic evolution plays an\nimportant role in ensuring a speedup over the final-time relaxation procedure.\nThus, relaxation-assisted adiabatic preparation can be more efficient than both\npure adiabatic evolution and pure relaxation.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 11 figures"]}]

To recover high-quality aerial image from its\nnon-uniform version, we propose a novel patch-wise restoration approach based\non a key observation that the degree of blurring is inevitably affected by the\nilluminated conditions. A non-local Retinex model is developed to accurately\nestimate the reflectance component from the degraded aerial image. Thereafter\nthe uneven illumination is corrected well. And then non-uniform coupled\nblurring in the enhanced reflectance image is alleviated and transformed\ntowards uniform distribution, which will facilitate the subsequent deblurring.\nFor constructing the multi-scale sparsified regularizer, the discrete shearlet\ntransform is improved to better represent anisotropic image features in term of\ndirectional sensitivity and selectivity. In addition, a new adaptive variant of\ntotal generalized variation is proposed for the structure-preserving\nregularizer.

The final deblurred image with uniform illumination can be\nextracted by applying the fast alternating direction scheme to solve the\nderived function.

Our numerical calculations show that the many body\nphysics of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) side is strongly modified\ncompared to the Fermi gases in the free space. The physics behind this\nstatement is in the fact that without a lattice structure, if the value of the\nZeeman field does not exceed some threshold value, the minimum of the\nsingle-particle ground state energy is infinitely degenerate and occurs along a\nring in $(k_x,k_y)$ space.
