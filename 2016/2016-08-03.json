It also leads to the\ninteresting question whether all non-extremal boxes allow for non-local\ncorrelations with the adversary. Secondly, in addition to the fact that new\ninformation-theoretic principles (designed to pick out the set of quantum\ncorrelations from among all non signaling ones) can in consequence be tested on\narbitrary non-local vertices to check their validity, it also allows the\npossibility of excluding from the quantum set any box of no-signaling\ncorrelations that can be distilled to a non-local vertex. Finally, it also\nforms a sufficient condition to identify non-local games with no quantum\nwinning strategy, when one can show that the game has a single unique\nnon-signaling winning strategy.

At late stages, when the galaxies pass within a few kpc,\ntidal torques drive nuclear gas inflow that triggers bursts of black hole\naccretion accompanied by star formation.

We attribute these\ndifferences primarily to the sub-grid models for black hole fueling and\nfeedback and gas thermodynamics. The main conclusion is that differences exist\nquantitatively between codes, and this should be kept in mind when making\ncomparisons with observations.

Recently, Uhm & Zhang found that the decay slopes of three\nGRB X-ray flares are steeper than what the standard model predicts. This\nrequires bulk acceleration of the emission region, which is consistent with a\nPoynting-flux-dominated outflow. In this paper, we systematically analyze a\nsample of 85 bright X-ray flares detected in 63 Swift GRBs, and investigate the\nrelationship between the temporal decay index $\\alpha$ and spectral index\n$\\beta$ during the steep decay phase of these flares. The $\\alpha$ value\ndepends on the choice of the zero time point $t_0$. We adopt two methods.\n\"Method I\" takes $t_0^I$ as the first rising data point of each flare, and is\nthe most conservative approach. We find that at 99.9% condifence level 56/85\nflares have decay slopes steeper than the simplest curvature effect prediction,\nand therefore, are in the acceleration regime. \"Method II\" extrapolates the\nrising light curve of each flare backwards until the flux density is three\norders of magnitude lower than the peak flux density, and defines the\ncorresponding time as the time zero point (t_0^II). We find that 74/85 flares\nfall into the acceleration regime at 99.9% condifence level. This suggests that\nbulk acceleration is common, may be even ubiquitous among X-ray flares,\npointing towards a Poynting-flux-dominated jet composition for these events.\n","Comment: 68 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, ApJS, in press"]}]

However, measuring the signal is technically challenging: one must\nextract a small, frequency-dependent signal from under much brighter spectrally\nsmooth foregrounds. Traditional approaches to study the global signal have used\nsingle antennas, which require one to calibrate out the frequency-dependent\nstructure in the overall system gain (due to internal reflections, for example)\nas well as remove the noise bias from auto-correlating a single amplifier\noutput. This has motivated proposals to measure the signal using\ncross-correlations in interferometric setups, where additional calibration\ntechniques are available. In this paper we focus on the general principles\ndriving the sensitivity of the interferometric setups to the global signal. We\nprove that this sensitivity is directly related to two characteristics of the\nsetup: the cross-talk between readout channels (i.e. the signal picked up at\none antenna when the other one is driven) and the correlated noise due to\nthermal fluctuations of lossy elements (e.g. absorbers or the ground) radiating\ninto both channels. Thus in an interferometric setup, one cannot suppress\ncross-talk and correlated thermal noise without reducing sensitivity to the\nglobal signal by the same factor -- instead, the challenge is to characterize\nthese effects and their frequency dependence. We illustrate our general theorem\nby explicit calculations within toy setups consisting of two short dipole\nantennas in free space and above a perfectly reflecting ground surface, as well\nas two well-separated identical lossless antennas arranged to achieve zero\ncross-talk.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 6 figures, published in ApJ"]}]

These events are often coincident\nwith high energy gamma-ray flares and they have attracted considerable\nattention, as they could allow one to probe the magnetic field structure in the\ngamma-ray emitting region of the jet. The flat-spectrum radio quasar 3C279 is\none of the most prominent examples showing this behaviour. Our goal is to study\nthe observed EVPA rotations and to distinguish between a stochastic and a\ndeterministic origin of the polarization variability. We have combined multiple\ndata sets of R-band photometry and optical polarimetry measurements of 3C279,\nyielding exceptionally well-sampled flux density and polarization curves that\ncover a period of 2008-2012. Several large EVPA rotations are identified in the\ndata. We introduce a quantitative measure for the EVPA curve smoothness, which\nis then used to test a set of simple random walk polarization variability\nmodels against the data. 3C279 shows different polarization variation\ncharacteristics during an optical low-flux state and a flaring state. The\npolarization variation during the flaring state, especially the smooth approx.\n360 degrees rotation of the EVPA in mid-2011, is not consistent with the tested\nstochastic processes. We conclude that during the two different optical flux\nstates, two different processes govern the polarization variation, possibly a\nstochastic process during the low-brightness state and a deterministic process\nduring the flaring activity.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 15 figures, 6 tables"]}]

Therefore, designing new ways to control\nmagnetic anisotropy in technologically important materials is highly desirable.\nHere we show that magnetic anisotropy of epitaxial thin-films of half-metallic\nferromagnet La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$ (LSMO) is determined by the proximity\nto thermodynamic equilibrium conditions during growth.

Thin\nfilms prepared by PLD show a in-plane cubic anisotropy with an overimposed\nuniaxial term. A large anisotropy constant perpendicular to the film plane was\nalso observed in these films. However, the uniaxial anisotropy is completely\nsuppressed in the CSD films. The out of plane anisotropy is also reduced,\nresulting in a much stronger in plane cubic anisotropy in the chemically\nsynthesized films. This change is due to a different rotation pattern of\nMnO$_{6}$ octahedra to accomodate epitaxial strain, which depends not only on\nthe amount of tensile stress imposed by the STO substrate, but also on the\ngrowth conditions.

With a total combined exposure\ntime of 9.1 Ms, these data yield the strongest constraints to date on the\nevolution of the metal content of the intracluster medium (ICM). We find no\nevidence for strong evolution in the global (r<R500) ICM metallicity (dZ/dz =\n-0.06 +/- 0.04 Zsun), with a mean value at z=0.6 of <Z> = 0.23 +/- 0.01 Zsun\nand a scatter of 0.08 +/- 0.01 Zsun.

The\nnon-curvature singularity of the classical flat Kasner spacetime is avoided,\nand the effective spacetime transits from a flat Kasner spacetime in asymptotic\nfuture, to a Minkowski spacetime in asymptotic past.

The present analysis is 1) more\n\"natural\" than the previous calculations, which were only valid in a very\nspecific region of the Calabi-Yau moduli space, 2) the theory is conceptually\nsimpler in that the left-right sector has been removed and 3) in the present\nanalysis the lack of gauge unification is due to threshold\neffects--particularly heavy string thresholds, which we calculate statistically\nin detail. As in our previous work, the theory is renormalization group evolved\nfrom $\\left<M_{U}\\right>$ to the electroweak scale--being subjected,\nsequentially, to the requirement of radiative $B-L$ and electroweak symmetry\nbreaking, the present experimental lower bounds on the $B-L$ vector boson and\nsparticle masses, as well as the lightest neutral Higgs mass of $\\sim$125 GeV.\nThe subspace of soft supersymmetry breaking masses that satisfies all such\nconstraints is presented and shown to be substantial.\n","Comment: 45 pages, 19 figures.

For a model consisting of ICM, stellar mass from the central\ngalaxy (BCG), and an NFW dark matter (DM) halo, we obtain good descriptions of\nthe projected radial profiles of ICM emissivity and temperature. The BCG\nstellar mass is clearly detected with M_star/L_K = 0.61 +/- 0.11 solar,\nconsistent with stellar population synthesis models for a Milky-Way IMF. We\nobtain a halo concentration, c_200 =8.4 +/- 1.0, and virial mass, M_200 = 7.9\n+/- 0.6 x 10^13 M_sun. For its mass, the inferred concentration is larger than\nmost relaxed halos produced in cosmological simulations with Planck parameters,\nconsistent with RXJ1159+5531 forming earlier than the general halo population.\nThe baryon fraction at r_200, f_b,200 = 0.134 +/- 0.007, is slightly below the\nPlanck value (0.155) for the universe. When we account for the stellar baryons\nassociated with non-central galaxies and the uncertain intracluster light,\nf_b,200 increases by ~0.015, consistent with the cosmic value. Performing our\nanalysis in the context of MOND still requires a large DM fraction (85.0% +/-\n2.5% at r=100 kpc) similar to that obtained using the standard Newtonian\napproach. The detection of a plausible stellar BCG mass component distinct from\nthe NFW DM halo in the total gravitational potential suggests that ~10^14 M_sun\nrepresents the mass scale above which dissipation is unimportant in the\nformation of the central regions of galaxy clusters.

The procedure used to determine the stellar\nparameters was similar to Heiter et al. (2015) and Jofre et al. (2014) for\nconsistency. The effective temperature (T$_{\\mathrm{eff}}$) of all candidate\nstars was determined using the Infrared Flux Method utilizing multi-band\nphotometry. The surface gravity (log g) was determined through fitting stellar\nevolutionary tracks. The [Fe/H] was determined using four different\nspectroscopic methods fixing the T$_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and log g from the values\ndetermined independent of spectroscopy. We discuss, star-by-star, the quality\nof each parameter including how it compares to literature, how it compares to a\nspectroscopic run where all parameters are free, and whether Fe I\nionisation-excitation balance is achieved.

In recent\nyears, many studies have identified traces of this event and have provided\nreasonable justification for this occurrence. The magnitude (in terms of\norbital variation) and the timing of the instability though (early or late with\nrespect to the dispersal of the gas disk) still remains an open debate. The\nterrestrial planets seem to set a strict constraint: either the giant planet\ninstability happened early, while the terrestrial planets were still forming,\nor the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn had to separate from each other\nimpulsively, with a large enough `jump' in semimajor axis (Brasser et al. 2009;\nKaib and Chambers 2016) for the terrestrial planets to remain stable.

These two constraints\nneed to match each other in order to favor one scenario over the other.\nConsidering an initially dynamically cold disk of asteroids, Morbidelli et al.\n(2010) concluded that a comparably large jump is needed to reconstruct the\ncurrent asteroid belt.

Because the asteroids\nexisted since the time of removal of the gas disk, unlike the terrestrial\nplanets, this constraint on the width of the giant planet jump is valid\nregardless of whether the instability happened early or late.

We show that the Thirty\nMeter Telescope (TMT), with a single epoch of observations combined with those\nof the Gaia space telescope, can distinguish the LCDM value of the torque from\nzero for each Sculptor-like dwarf galaxy with a confidence between 0 and 5\nsigma, depending on the orientation of each halo. With two epochs of\nobservations, TMT will achieve a 5 sigma discovery of torque and so asphericity\nfor most such galaxies, and so will provide a new and powerful test of the LCDM\nmodel.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 4 pdf figures, accepted for publication in ApJL"]}]

Unlike prior studies using jamming to disrupt or disable the\ntargeted wireless communications, we propose a new physical-layer spoofing\napproach to change their communicated information. Consider a fundamental\nthree-node system over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, in which\nan intermediary legitimate spoofer aims to spoof a malicious communication link\nfrom Alice to Bob, such that the received message at Bob is changed from\nAlice's originally sent message to the one desired by the spoofer. We propose a\nnew symbol-level spoofing scheme, where the spoofer designs the spoofing signal\nvia exploiting the symbol-level relationship between each original\nconstellation point of Alice and the desirable one of the spoofer. In\nparticular, the spoofer aims to minimize the average spoofing-symbol-error-rate\n(SSER), which is defined as the average probability that the symbols decoded by\nBob fail to be changed or spoofed, by designing its spoofing signals over\nsymbols subject to the average transmit power constraint. By considering two\ncases when Alice employs the widely-used binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) and\nquadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulations, we obtain the respective\noptimal solutions to the two average SSER minimization problems. Numerical\nresults show that the symbol-level spoofing scheme with optimized transmission\nachieves a much lower average SSER, as compared to other benchmark schemes.\n","Comment: Submitted for possible journal publication"]}]

Instead, integrated observables,\nsuch as avalanche size and duration, are commonly used, not least as to avoid\ncomplications due to the unavoidable lack of translational invariance. The\npresent work is a survey of spatio-temporal correlation functions in SOC,\nmeasured numerically in detail in the Manna Model in d=1,3 and 5 dimensions and\ncompared to theoretical results. Contrary to the notion held by some of SOC\nmodels organising into a critical state by re-arranging their spatial structure\navalanche by avalanche, which may be expected to result in non-trivial spatial\ncorrelations in the quiescent state (between avalanches), correlations of\ninactive particles in the quiescent state are apparently short-ranged.\nSelf-organisation, however, does take place as the (one-point) density of\ninactive particle organises into a particular profile that is independent of\nthe driving location, also demonstrated analytically in one dimension. Activity\nand its correlations, on the other hand, display non-trivial long-ranged\nspatio-temporal scaling with exponents that can be related to established\nresults, in particular avalanche size and duration exponents. The correlation\nlength is set by the system size (confirmed analytically for some observables),\nas expected in systems displaying finite size scaling. In one dimension, we\nfind some surprising inconsistencies of the dynamical exponent. A (spatially\nextended) mean field theory is recovered, with some corrections, in five\ndimensions.\n","Comment: 37 pages, 26 figures"]}]
