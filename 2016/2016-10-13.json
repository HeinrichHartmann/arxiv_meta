LinkMirage considers the evolution of the social\nnetwork topologies, and minimizes privacy leakage due to temporal dynamics of\nthe system.\n  Second, we define metrics for quantifying the privacy and utility of a time\nseries of social topologies with anonymized links. We analyze the privacy and\nutility provided by LinkMirage both theoretically, as well as using real world\nsocial network topologies: a Facebook dataset with 870K links and a large-scale\nGoogle+ dataset with 940M links. We find that our approach significantly\noutperforms the existing state-of-art.\n  Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of LinkMirage in real-world\napplications such as Sybil defenses, reputation systems, anonymity systems and\nvertex anonymity. We also prototype LinkMirage as a Facebook application such\nthat real world systems can bootstrap privacy-preserving trust relationships\nwithout the cooperation of the OSN operators.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 20 figures"]}]

Based on data obtained experimentally, the state stability of the\ndecagonal quasicrystal was also examined in terms of the Hume-Rothery (HR)\nmechanism on the basis of the nearly-free-electron approximation. It was found\nthat a model based on the HR mechanism could explain the crystallographic\nfeatures such as electron diffraction patterns and atomic arrangements found in\nthe decagonal quasicrystal. In other words, the HR mechanism is most likely\nappropriate for the stability of the decagonal quasicrystal in the Al-Co-Cu\nalloy system.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 9 figures"]}]

The\nanswers to many resource-theoretic questions about thermodynamics can be read\noff from this diagram, such as the efficiency of a heat engine consisting of\nfinite reservoirs or the rate of conversion between two states.

However, astrometry of\ndirectly imaged exoplanets is subject to biases, systematic errors, and speckle\nnoise. Here we describe an analytical procedure to forward model the signal of\nan exoplanet that accounts for both the observing strategy (angular and\nspectral differential imaging) and the data reduction method (Karhunen-Lo\\`eve\nImage Projection algorithm). We use this forward model to measure the position\nof an exoplanet in a Bayesian framework employing Gaussian processes and Markov\nchain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to account for correlated noise. In the case of GPI\ndata on $\\beta$ Pic b, this technique, which we call Bayesian KLIP-FM\nAstrometry (BKA), outperforms previous techniques and yields 1$\\sigma$-errors\nat or below the one milliarcsecond level. We validate BKA by fitting a\nKeplerian orbit to twelve GPI observations along with previous astrometry from\nother instruments. The statistical properties of the residuals confirm that BKA\nis accurate and correctly estimates astrometric errors. Our constraints on the\norbit of $\\beta$ Pic b firmly rule out the possibility of a transit of the\nplanet at 10-$\\sigma$ significance. However, we confirm that the Hill sphere of\n$\\beta$ Pic b will transit, giving us a rare chance to probe the\ncircumplanetary environment of a young, evolving exoplanet.

However, much less\nis known today about the network dynamics: indeed, complex networks in reality\nare not static, but rather dynamically evolve over time.\n  Our paper is motivated by the empirical observation that network evolution\npatterns seem far from random, but exhibit structure. Moreover, the specific\npatterns appear to depend on the network type, contradicting the existence of a\n\"one fits it all\" model. However, we still lack observables to quantify these\nintuitions, as well as metrics to compare graph evolutions. Such observables\nand metrics are needed for extrapolating or predicting evolutions, as well as\nfor interpolating graph evolutions.\n  To explore the many faces of graph dynamics and to quantify temporal changes,\nthis paper suggests to build upon the concept of centrality, a measure of node\nimportance in a network. In particular, we introduce the notion of centrality\ndistance, a natural similarity measure for two graphs which depends on a given\ncentrality, characterizing the graph type. Intuitively, centrality distances\nreflect the extent to which (non-anonymous) node roles are different or, in\ncase of dynamic graphs, have changed over time, between two graphs.\n  We evaluate the centrality distance approach for five evolutionary models and\nseven real-world social and physical networks. Our results empirically show the\nusefulness of centrality distances for characterizing graph dynamics compared\nto a null-model of random evolution, and highlight the differences between the\nconsidered scenarios. Interestingly, our approach allows us to compare the\ndynamics of very different networks, in terms of scale and evolution speed.\n","Comment: This paper is withdrawn because it should have replaced 1506.01565\n  instead of creating a duplicate.

In HF compounds at zero temperature the unique phase\ntransition, dubbed throughout as the fermion condensation quantum phase\ntransition (FCQPT) can occur; this FCQPT creates flat bands which in turn lead\nto the specific state, known as the fermion condensate. Unlimited increase of\nthe effective mass of quasiparticles signifies FCQPT; these quasiparticles\ndetermine the thermodynamic, transport and relaxation properties of HF\ncompounds. Our discussion of numerous salient experimental data within the\nframework of FCQPT resolves the mystery of the new state of matter. Thus, FCQPT\nand the fermion condensation can be considered as the universal reason for the\nnon-Fermi liquid behavior observed in various HF compounds. We show\nanalytically and using arguments based completely on the experimental grounds\nthat these systems exhibit universal scaling behavior of their thermodynamic,\ntransport and relaxation properties. Therefore, the quantum physics of\ndifferent HF compounds is universal, and emerges regardless of the microscopic\nstructure of the compounds.

This paper quantifies how\nDNS traffic can make Tor users more vulnerable to correlation attacks. We\ninvestigate how incorporating DNS traffic can make existing correlation attacks\nmore powerful and how DNS lookups can leak information to third parties about\nanonymous communication.

When the data\nare missing not at random, the parameter of interest is not identifiable in\ngeneral. Without imposing additional assumptions, researchers can derive bounds\nof the parameters of interest, which, unfortunately, are often too wide to be\ninformative. Therefore, it is of great importance to sharpen these worst-case\nbounds by exploiting additional information and invoking plausible assumptions.\nTraditional missing data analysis uses only the information of the binary\nmissing data indicator, that is, a certain data point is either missing or not.\nNevertheless, real data often provide more information than a binary missing\ndata indicator, and they often record different types of missingness. In a\nmotivating HIV status survey, missing data may be due to the units'\nunwillingness to respond to the survey items or their hospitalization during\nthe visit, and may also be due to the units' temporarily absence or relocation.\nIt is apparent that some missing types are more likely to be missing not at\nrandom, but other missing types are more likely to be missing at random. We\nshow that making full use of the missing types allows us to obtain narrower\nbounds of the parameters of interest. Moreover, combining with the monotonicity\nby nature of HIV, we further improve the bounds. In a real-life example, we\ndemonstrate substantial improvement of more than 50\\% reduction in bound widths\nfor estimating the prevalence of HIV in rural Malawi.

The weight of this\nmaterial anchors this field to the surface at semi-regular spatial intervals,\nshaping it in an undulatory fashion. Finally, magnetic reconnection enables the\nfield to release itself from its photospheric anchors, allowing it to continue\nits voyage up to higher layers.

Here, we\npropose an extension of the two phase mass flow model (Pudasaini, 2012) by\nincluding a new mechanism, called separation-flux, that leads to strong\nphase-separation in avalanche and debris flows while balancing the enhanced\nsolid flux with the reduced fluid flux. The separation flux mechanism is\ncapable of describing the dynamically evolving phase-separation and levee\nformation in a multi-phase, geometrically three-dimensional debris flow. These\nare often observed phenomena in natural debris flows and industrial processes\nthat involve the transportation of particulate solid-fluid mixture material.\nThe novel separation-flux model includes several dominant physical and\nmechanical aspects such as pressure gradients, volume fractions of solid and\nfluid phases and their gradients, shear-rates, flow depth, material friction,\nviscosity, material densities, topographic constraints, grain size, etc. Due to\nthe inherent separation mechanism, as the mass moves down slope, more and more\nsolid particles are transported to the front and the sides, resulting in\nsolid-rich and mechanically strong frontal surge head, and lateral levees\nfollowed by a weaker tail largely consisting of viscous fluid. The primary\nfrontal solid-rich surge head followed by secondary fluid-rich surges is the\nconsequence of phase-separation. Such typical and dominant phase-separation\nphenomena are revealed for two-phase debris flow simulations.

We report simulation\nresults for non-isothermal and isothermal crystallization with weak and strong\nsegregation strength to elucidate the composition dependent crystallization\nbehavior. With increasing composition of low melting B-polymer, macrophase\nseparation and crystallization temperature changes non-monotonically, which is\nattributed to the change in diffusivity of both the polymers with increasing\ncomposition of B-polymer. In weak segregation strength, however, at high enough\ncomposition of B-polymer, A-polymer yields relatively thicker crystals, which\nis attributed to the dilution effect exhibited by B-polymer. When B-polymer\ncomposition is high enough, it acts like a solvent while A-polymer\ncrystallizes. Under this situation, A-polymer segments become more mobile and\nless facile to crystallize. As a result, A-polymer crystallizes at a relative\nlow temperature with the formation of thicker crystals. At strong segregation\nstrength, dilution effect is accompanied with the strong A-B repulsive\ninteraction, which is reflected in non-monotonic trend of mean square radius of\ngyration with increasing composition of B-polymer. Isothermal crystallization\nreveals a strong relationship between composition and crystallization behavior.\nTwo-step (viz., sequential crystallization) yields better crystals than\none-step (viz., coincident crystallization) for both the polymers.\n","Comment: 59 pages, including supplementary information of 13 pages"]}]

The main goal of the ion program is to study the properties of the\nonset of deconfinement and to search for the signatures of the critical point.\nA specific property of the critical point, the increase in the correlation\nlength, makes fluctuations its basic signal. Higher order moments of suitable\nobservables are of special interest as they are more sensitive to the\ncorrelation length than typically studied second order moments. In this\ncontribution preliminary results on higher order fluctuations of negatively\ncharged hadron multiplicity and net-charge in p+p interactions are shown.

Different from previous studies,\nwe do not assume specific propagation, injection, and solar modulation\nparameters when calculating the antiproton fluxes, but use the results inferred\nfrom the B/C ratio and proton data from the recent PAMELA/AMS-02 measurements\ninstead. A joint likelihood method including the likelihood of these background\nparameters is established within the Bayesian framework. We find that a dark\nmatter signal is favored with a high test statistic value of $\\sim 70$. The\nrest mass of the dark matter particles is $\\sim 30-70$ GeV and the\nvelocity-averaged hadronic annihilation cross section is about $(1-6)\\times\n10^{-26}$ cm$^{3}$s$^{-1}$, in agreement with that needed to account for the\nGalactic center GeV excess and/or the weak GeV emission from dwarf galaxies\nReticulum 2 and Tucana III.

We compute\nthe algebra of these currents formed with the leading currents and amongst\nthemselves.
