We then present two new structured\nrepresentations, a binary tree of PLUQ decompositions, and the Bruhat\ngenerator, using respectively O(ns log n/s) and O(ns) field elements instead of\nO(ns^2) for the previously known generators. We present algorithms computing\nthese representations in time O(n^2 s^($\\omega$--2)). These representations\nallow a matrix-vector product in time linear in the size of their\nrepresentation. Lastly we show how to multiply two such structured matrices in\ntime O(n^2 s^($\\omega$--2)).\n","Comment: International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation\n  (ISSAC'16), Jul 2016, Waterloo, France"]}]

To be usable in\nstand-alone systems, facial attributes must be extracted from images\nautomatically and reliably. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective\nsolution for automatic facial attribute extraction by training a deep\nconvolutional neural network (DCNN) for each facial attribute separately,\nwithout using any pre-training or dataset augmentation, and we obtain new\nstate-of-the-art facial attribute classification results on the CelebA\nbenchmark.

We show that FFA generates more adversarial examples\nthan other related algorithms, and that DCNNs for certain attributes are\ngenerally robust to adversarial inputs, while DCNNs for other attributes are\nnot. This result is surprising because no DCNNs tested to date have exhibited\nrobustness to adversarial images without explicit augmentation in the training\nprocedure to account for adversarial examples. Finally, we introduce the\nconcept of natural adversarial samples, i.e., images that are misclassified but\ncan be easily turned into correctly classified images by applying small\nperturbations. We demonstrate that natural adversarial samples commonly occur,\neven within the training set, and show that many of these images remain\nmisclassified even with additional training epochs.

In the network, standalone power beacons (PBs) are\ndeployed for wirelessly powering nodes by beaming unmodulated carrier signals\nto targeted nodes.

Such transmission by backscatter consumes orders-of-magnitude\nless power than a traditional radio. Thereby, the dense deployment of\nlow-complexity PBs with high transmission power can power a large-scale IoT.

These streams penetrate supersonically through\nthe hot medium encompassed by a stable shock near the virial radius of the\ndark-matter halo. Our long-term goal is to explore the heating and dissipation\nrate of the streams and their fragmentation and possible breakup, in order to\nunderstand how galaxies are fed, and how this affects their star-formation rate\nand morphology. We present here the first step, where we analyze the linear\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) of a cold, dense slab or cylinder flowing\nthrough a hot, dilute medium in the transonic regime. The current analysis is\nlimited to the adiabatic case with no gravity and assuming equal pressure in\nthe stream and the medium. By analytically solving the linear dispersion\nrelation, we find a transition from a dominance of the familiar rapidly growing\nsurface modes in the subsonic regime to more slowly growing body modes in the\nsupersonic regime. The system is parameterized by three parameters: the density\ncontrast between the stream and the medium, the Mach number of stream velocity\nwith respect to the medium, and the stream width with respect to the halo\nvirial radius. We find that a realistic choice for these parameters places the\nstreams near the mode transition, with the KHI exponential-growth time in the\nrange 0.01-10 virial crossing times for a perturbation wavelength comparable to\nthe stream width. We confirm our analytic predictions with idealized\nhydrodynamical simulations. Our linear-KHI estimates thus indicate that KHI may\nin principle be effective in the evolution of streams by the time they reach\nthe galaxy.

To\nthis end, we propose a topic aware sequence-to-sequence (TA-Seq2Seq) model.

The joint attention mechanism summarizes the hidden\nvectors of an input message as context vectors by message attention,\nsynthesizes topic vectors by topic attention from the topic words of the\nmessage obtained from a pre-trained LDA model, and let these vectors jointly\naffect the generation of words in decoding. To increase the possibility of\ntopic words appearing in responses, the model modifies the generation\nprobability of topic words by adding an extra probability item to bias the\noverall distribution.

The parameters of the orbit and physical\nlibration are determined in this work from LLR observations made at different\nobservatories in 1970-2013. Parameters of other models are taken from solutions\nthat were obtained independently from LLR.\n  A new implementation of the DE430 lunar model, including the liquid core\nequations, was done within the EPM ephemeris. The postfit residuals of LLR\nobservations make evident that the terrestrial models and solutions recommended\nby the IERS Conventions are compatible with the lunar theory. That includes:\nEGM2008 with conventional corrections and variations from solid and ocean\ntides; displacement of stations due to solid and ocean loading tides; and\nprecession-nutation model. Usage of these models in the solution for LLR\nobservations has allowed us to reduce the number of parameters to be fit. The\nfixed model of tidal variations of the geopotential has resulted in a lesser\nvalue of Moon's extra eccentricity rate, as compared to the original DE430\nmodel with two fit parameters.\n  A mixed model of lunar gravitational potential was used, with some\ncoefficients determined from LLR observations, and other taken from the GL660b\nsolution.\n  Solutions obtain accurate positions for the ranging stations and the 5\nretroreflectors. Station motion is derived for sites with long data spans.\nDissipation is detected at the lunar fluid core-solid mantle boundary\ndemonstrating that a fluid core is present. Tidal dissipation is strong at both\nEarth and Moon. Consequently, the lunar semimajor axis is expanding by 38.20\nmm/yr, the tidal acceleration in mean longitude is -25.90 \"/cy2, and the\neccentricity is increasing by 1.48e-11 each year.\n"]}]

HIRAX will comprise 1024 six meter parabolic dishes on a compact grid\nand will map most of the southern sky over the course of four years. HIRAX has\ntwo primary science goals: to constrain Dark Energy and measure structure at\nhigh redshift, and to study radio transients and pulsars. HIRAX will observe\nunresolved sources of neutral hydrogen via their redshifted 21-cm emission line\n(`hydrogen intensity mapping'). The resulting maps of large-scale structure at\nredshifts 0.8-2.5 will be used to measure Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO).\nHIRAX will improve upon current BAO measurements from galaxy surveys by\nobserving a larger cosmological volume (larger in both survey area and redshift\nrange) and by measuring BAO at higher redshift when the expansion of the\nuniverse transitioned to Dark Energy domination. HIRAX will complement CHIME, a\nhydrogen intensity mapping experiment in the Northern Hemisphere, by completing\nthe sky coverage in the same redshift range. HIRAX's location in the Southern\nHemisphere also allows a variety of cross-correlation measurements with\nlarge-scale structure surveys at many wavelengths. Daily maps of a few thousand\nsquare degrees of the Southern Hemisphere, encompassing much of the Milky Way\ngalaxy, will also open new opportunities for discovering and monitoring radio\ntransients. The HIRAX correlator will have the ability to rapidly and\neXperimentciently detect transient events. This new data will shed light on the\npoorly understood nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs), enable pulsar monitoring\nto enhance long-wavelength gravitational wave searches, and provide a rich data\nset for new radio transient phenomena searches.

In Galilean physics, the universality of free fall implies\nan inertial frame, which in turns implies that the mass m of the falling body\nis omitted. Otherwise, an additional acceleration proportional to m/M would\nrise either for an observer at the centre of mass of the system, or for an\nobserver at a fixed distance from the centre of mass of M. These elementary,\nbut overlooked, considerations fully respect the equivalence principle and the\nidentity of an inertial or a gravitational pull for an observer in the Einstein\ncabin. They value as fore-runners of the self-force and gauge dependency in\ngeneral relativity. The approximate nature of Galilei's law of free fall is\nexplored herein. When stepping into general relativity, we report how the\ngeodesic free fall into a black hole was the subject of an intense debate again\ncentred on coordinate choice. Later, we describe how the infalling mass and the\nemitted gravitational radiation affect the free fall motion of a body. The\ngeneral relativistic self-force might be dealt with to perfectly fit into a\ngeodesic conception of motion. Then, embracing quantum mechanics, real black\nholes are not classical static objects any longer. Free fall has to handle the\nHawking radiation, and leads us to new perspectives on the varying mass of the\nevaporating black hole and on the varying energy of the falling mass. Along the\npaper, we also estimate our findings for ordinary masses being dropped from a\nGalilean or Einsteinian Pisa-like tower with respect to the current state of\nthe art drawn from precise measurements in ground and space laboratories, and\nto the constraints posed by quantum measurements.

Earlier studies of quasi-DC\nelectric field modulation of QD properties have been limited by the\nelectrostatic breakdown processes under the high externally applied electric\nfields, which have restricted the range of modulation of QD properties. In\ncontrast, in the present work we drive CdSe:CdS core:shell QD films with\nhigh-field THz-frequency electromagnetic pulses whose duration is only a few\npicoseconds. Surprisingly, in response to the THz excitation we observe QD\nluminescence even in the absence of an external charge source.

It\nparallelizes fixed-point iterations by letting a set of nodes randomly choose\nsolution coordinates and update them in an asynchronous parallel fashion. ARock\ntakes some recent asynchronous coordinate descent algorithms as special cases\nand gives rise to new asynchronous operator-splitting algorithms.

Since in the process of retroreflection the turning\nsense of a circularly polarized beam of light does not change and the direction\nof propagation is inverted, the photon spin is inverted. Due to conservation of\nangular momentum a transfer of photon spin to electron orbital angular momentum\nof conduction electrons occurs. In the structures a circular movement of\nelectrons is blocked and therefore the transfered spin can be detected as a\nphotovoltage due to an electromotive force which is induced by the transfer of\nangular momentum. Depending on the polarization of the incident beam, a maximum\nphotovoltage of about 0,2 micro V was measured for both structures. The results\nare interpreted in terms of a classical electrodynamic model of the\nmonochromatic linearly polarized photon as a propagating solitary\nelectromagnetic wave of finite energy hf which carries an angular momentum\nh/2pi which is elaborated elsewhere where h is Plancks constant and f the\nfrequency of light. The relative values of the measured photovoltages for\ndifferent polarizations can well be explained by the electrodynamic model of a\nphoton and an associated spin angular momentum. The absolute values of the\nmeasured photovoltages are also consistent with the interpretation. The\nobserved effects are closely related to the lateral Fedorov Imbert shift of\nfocused beams in optics and the optical spin Hall effect and to other non\nlinear optical effects such as the inverse faraday effect for which a new\ninterpretation is given here in terms of the electrodynamic model of the photon\nand its spin.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 8 figures"]}]

In this\nwork, we develop a SLAM framework that uses relative feature-to-feature\nmeasurements to exploit this structural property of SLAM. Relative feature\nmeasurements are used to pose a linear estimation problem for pose-to-pose\norientation constraints. This is followed by solving an iterative non-linear\non-manifold optimization problem to compute the maximum likelihood estimate for\nrobot orientation given relative rotation constraints. Once the robot\norientation is computed, we solve a linear problem for robot position and map\nestimation.

By\ncomparing photocurrent signals obtained when scanning over a DLSPPW straight\nwaveguide with those related to a DLSPPW racetrack resonator, we first\ndetermine the background signal level and then the corrected DLSPPW resonator\nspectral response, which is found consistent with that obtained from full wave\nnumerical simulations. The approach developed can be extended to other\nplasmonic waveguide configurations and advantageously used for rapid\ncharacterization of complicated plasmonic circuits.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 5 figures"]}]

Instead,\nwe approach context-sensitive parsing through the idea that parsers may recall\npreviously matched input (or data derived therefrom) in order to make parsing\ndecisions.

The key\nfeature is that the language is comprised of a number of components with\nmultiple (input/output) terminals, each possibly labelled with some type, that\nmay then be connected together along these terminals to form a larger network.\nThe components form hyperedges between labelled vertices, and so a diagram in\nthis language forms a hypergraph.

Network-style diagrammatic\nlanguages and their semantics thus form hypergraph categories, and semantic\ninterpretation gives a hypergraph functor.\n  The first part of this thesis develops the theory of hypergraph categories.\nIn particular, we introduce the tools of decorated cospans and corelations.\nDecorated cospans allow straightforward construction of hypergraph categories\nfrom diagrammatic languages: the inputs, outputs, and their composition are\nmodelled by the cospans, while the 'decorations' specify the components\nthemselves. Not all hypergraph categories can be constructed, however, through\ndecorated cospans. Decorated corelations are a more powerful version that\npermits construction of all hypergraph categories and hypergraph functors.\nThese are often useful for constructing the semantic categories of diagrammatic\nlanguages and functors from diagrams to the semantics.

An important question is\nwhether these small changes can significantly affect the analysis results. In\nthis paper, we study the effect of noise in changing ranks of the high\ncentrality vertices. We compare, using the Jaccard Index (JI), how many of the\ntop-k high centrality nodes from the original network are also part of the\ntop-k ranked nodes from the noisy network. We deem a network as stable if the\nJI value is high. We observe two features that affect the stability. First, the\nstability is dependent on the number of top-ranked vertices considered. When\nthe vertices are ordered according to their centrality values, they group into\nclusters. Perturbations to the network can change the relative ranking within\nthe cluster, but vertices rarely move from one cluster to another. Second, the\nstability is dependent on the local connections of the high ranking vertices.\nThe network is highly stable if the high ranking vertices are connected to each\nother. Our findings show that the stability of a network is affected by the\nlocal properties of high centrality vertices, rather than the global properties\nof the entire network. Based on these local properties we can identify the\nstability of a network, without explicitly applying a noise model.\n","Comment: CIKM 2016"]}]

Our models\nconsider two ecological modules in which either two predators share one prey\nspecies (exploitative competition) or one predator species exploits two prey\n(apparent competition). The shared species evolves defense or prey use in these\nmodules. Evolving species are either haploid or diploid. A single locus\npleiotropically determines the nutritional quality of prey and the ability to\ncapture prey. When pleiotropy is sufficiently antagonistic (e.g. nutritional\nprey are harder to capture), community assembly culminates in one of two stable\nstates supporting only two species. When pleiotropy is weakly antagonistic or\nsynergistic, the assembly dynamics are intransitive: species-genotype pairs are\nsuccessively displaced in a cyclic fashion by rare invasions of the missing\ngenotypes or species. This intransitive dynamic allows for coexistence if,\nalong its equilibria, the geometric mean of recovery rates of rare genotypes or\nspecies exceeds the geometric mean of loss rates of rare genotypes or species.\nBy affecting these rates, synergistic pleiotropy can mediate coexistence, while\nantagonistic pleiotropy does not. For diploid populations experiencing weak\nantagonistic pleiotropy, superadditive contributions of alleles to heterozygote\nfitness can mitigate coexistence via an eco-evolutionary storage effect.\nDensity-dependence and mutations also can mitigate coexistence.

This article exams Riemann's original proof of the\nclassification of minimal surfaces foliated by circles and lines in parallel\nplanes and presents a complete outline of the recent proof that every properly\nembedded minimal planar domain in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is either a Riemann minimal\nexample, a catenoid, a helicoid or a plane.\n","Comment: 40 pages, 10 figures.

It focuses on a Korteweg-de Vries equation,\nwhich is a nonlinear mathematical model of waves on shallow water surfaces. Two\ndifferent types of saturated controls are considered. The well-posedness is\nproven applying a Banach fixed point theorem, using some estimates of this\nequation and some properties of the saturation function. The proof of the\nasymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is separated in two cases: i)\nwhen the control acts on all the domain, a Lyapunov function together with a\nsector condition describing the saturating input is used to conclude on the\nstability, ii) when the control is localized, we argue by contradiction. Some\nnumerical simulations illustrate the stability of the closed-loop nonlinear\npartial differential equation. 1. Introduction. In recent decades, a great\neffort has been made to take into account input saturations in control designs\n(see e.g [39], [15] or more recently [17]). In most applications, actuators are\nlimited due to some physical constraints and the control input has to be\nbounded. Neglecting the amplitude actuator limitation can be source of\nundesirable and catastrophic behaviors for the closed-loop system. The standard\nmethod to analyze the stability with such nonlinear controls follows a two\nsteps design. First the design is carried out without taking into account the\nsaturation. In a second step, a nonlinear analysis of the closed-loop system is\nmade when adding the saturation. In this way, we often get local stabilization\nresults. Tackling this particular nonlinearity in the case of finite\ndimensional systems is already a difficult problem. However, nowadays, numerous\ntechniques are available (see e.g. [39, 41, 37]) and such systems can be\nanalyzed with an appropriate Lyapunov function and a sector condition of the\nsaturation map, as introduced in [39]. In the literature, there are few papers\nstudying this topic in the infinite dimensional case. Among them, we can cite\n[18], [29], where a wave equation equipped with a saturated distributed\nactuator is studied, and [12], where a coupled PDE/ODE system modeling a\nswitched power converter with a transmission line is considered. Due to some\nrestrictions on the system, a saturated feedback has to be designed in the\nlatter paper. There exist also some papers using the nonlinear semigroup theory\nand focusing on abstract systems ([20],[34],[36]). Let us note that in [36],\n[34] and [20], the study of a priori bounded controller is tackled using\nabstract nonlinear theory. To be more specific, for bounded ([36],[34]) and\nunbounded ([34]) control operators, some conditions are derived to deduce, from\nthe asymptotic stability of an infinite-dimensional linear system in abstract\nform, the asymptotic stability when closing the loop with saturating\ncontroller.

We demonstrate that the\nmodel is consistent with experimentally observed long-term dendritic spine\ndynamics under steady-state and lesion induced conditions, and show that\ncooperation of multiple synaptic contacts is crucial for stable, long-term\nsynaptic memories. In simulations of a simplified network of barrel cortex, our\nplasticity rule reproduces whisker-trimming induced rewiring of\nthalamo-cortical and recurrent synaptic connectivity on realistic time scales.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 9 figures"]}]
