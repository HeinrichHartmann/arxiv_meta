This result is robust in the presence of $P>N$ constraints,\nwhile for $P=N$ the diameter is further enhanced by eigenvector delocalization\nto $N^{3/2}f_N$. We directly verify our results in explicit Calabi-Yau\ncompactifications of type IIB string theory. In the classic example with\n$h^{1,1}=51$ where parametrically controlled moduli stabilization was\ndemonstrated by Denef et al. in [1], the largest metric eigenvalue obeys $f_N\n\\approx 0.013 M_{pl}$.

This can dramatically affect the length distribution of the\nmicrotubules. The crosslinker sulfosuccinimidyl\n4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, sulfo-SMCC, consists of a\nmaleimide and an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester group to bind to sulfhydryl groups\nand primary amines, respectively. Interestingly, addition of a maleimide dye\nalone does not show the same interference with annealing in stabilized\nmicrotubules. This study shows that the sulfhydryl groups of cysteines of\ntubulin that are vital for the polymerization are also important for the\nsubsequent annealing of microtubules.\n","Comment: 3 figures"]}]

In a confined superfluid, quantized\nvortices can support such an ordered phase, provided they evolve as an almost\nisolated subsystem containing sufficient energy.

The dipole structure emerges characterized by the\ncontinuous growth of the macroscopic dipole moment which serves as a global\norder parameter, resembling a continuous phase transition. The critical\ntemperature of the transition, and the critical exponent associated with the\ndipole moment, are obtained exactly within mean-field theory. The clustering\ntransition is shown to be distinct from the final state reached at high energy,\nknown as supercondensation.

In this\ncase, treatments may be effective if they drive the system to the basin of\nattraction of the cancer cure state. In the second regime, cancer arises\nbecause the repair system is intrinsically corrupted. In this case, the\ncomplete cure is not possible since the cancer cure state is no more stable,\nbut tumor recurrence may be delayed if treatment is prolongued.

In analogy with partial wetting in soft matter, spins just below the\nsurface are more correlated than in the bulk, but \\emph{not} ordered. For\nultrathin films made of one cubic unit cell, once the surfaces are ordered, a\nsquare ice phase is stabilized over a finite temperature window, as confirmed\nby its entropy and the presence of pinch points in the structure factor.\nUltimately, the square ice degeneracy is lifted at lower temperature and the\nsystem orders in analogy with the well-known $F$-transition of the $6$-vertex\nmodel.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures"]}]

A typical framework is a system where a set of files\nare duplicated on several data servers. When one of these servers breaks down,\nall copies of files stored on it are lost. They can be retrieved afterwards if\ncopies of the same files are stored on some other servers. In the case where no\nother copy of a given file is present in the network, it is definitively lost.\nThe efficiency of such a network in therefore directly related to the\nperformances of the mechanism used to duplicate files on servers. In this paper\nthe duplication process is assumed to be local, any server has a capacity to\nmake copies to another server but it can only be used for the copies present on\nthis server, contrary to previous models of the literature for which the\nduplication capacity could be used globally.\n  We study the asymptotic behavior of this system in a mean-field context, i.e.\nwhen the number $N$ of servers is large.

We introduce a stochastic model of the evolution of the network\nwhich has values in state space whose dimension does not depend on $N$. This\ndescription does not have the Markov property but it turns out that it is\nconverging in distribution, as $N$ gets large, to a nonlinear Markov process.\nAdditionally, this asymptotic process gives a limiting result on the rate of\ndecay of the network which is the key characteristic of interest of these\nsystems.

These\nactivities are principally limited by the causal connectivity of a civilisation\nto its neighbours at its inception, i.e. whether it comes to prominence being\naware of other ETIs and any treaties or agreements in place.\n  If even one civilisation is not causally connected to the other members of a\ntreaty, then they are free to operate beyond it and contact the Earth if\nwished, which makes the Zoo solution \"soft\". We should therefore consider how\nlikely this scenario is, as this will give us a sense of the Zoo solution's\nsoftness, or general validity.\n  We implement a simple toy model of ETIs arising in a Galactic Habitable Zone,\nand calculate the properties of the groups of culturally connected\ncivilisations established therein. We show that for most choices of\ncivilisation parameters, the number of culturally connected groups is greater\nthan 1, meaning that the Galaxy is composed of multiple Galactic Cliques rather\nthan a single Galactic Club. We find in our models for a single Galactic Club\nto establish interstellar hegemony, the number of civilisations must be\nrelatively large, the mean civilisation lifetime must be several millions of\nyears, and the inter-arrival time between civilisations must be a few million\nyears or less.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 5 figures, accepted to the International Journal of\n  Astrobiology"]}]

A\nphysically relevant example, motivated by condensed-matter physics, is that of\na fermionic gauge theory with group $SU(2)\\otimes U_S(1) \\otimes U_{E}(1)$. In\nthe strong U_S(1) region, the SU(2) symmetry breaks down to a U(1), due to the\nformation of a parity-invariant fermion condensate. We conjecture a phase\ndiagram for the theory involving a critical line, which separates the regions\nof broken SU(2) symmetry from those where the symmetry is restored. In the\nbroken phase, the effective Abelian gauge theory is closely related to an\nearlier model of two-dimensional parity-invariant superconductivity in doped\nantiferromagnets. The superconductivity in the model occurs in the\nKosterlitz-Thouless mode, since strong phase fluctuations prevent the existence\nof a local order parameter. Some physical consequences of the $SU(2) \\times\nU_S(1)$ phase diagram for the (doping-dependent) parameter space of this\ncondensed-matter model are briefly discussed.\n","Comment: 17 pages Latex, 1 macro, three figures (included) (minor typo on page\n  14 concerning the critical coupling of SU(2) corrected)"]}]

We estimate that the time lag between the arrival times of the left\nand right circularly polarised light signals from pulsars. If the light\npropagates through a hot plasma (where the temperature in some regions is $T\n\\sim 100 MeV$) then the time lag between the two circularly polarised signals\nof frequency $\\omega$ will be $\\Delta t(\\omega) \\simeq 10^{-6} /\\omega$.

The most favorable energy to detect a possible diffuse flux\nof primordial black hole origin is found to be a few MeV.

Simple analytic solutions are provided in matrix form (for general\nboundary conditions) when only the third generation Yukawa couplings are\nretained in the renormalisation group equations. We solve the evolution\nequations of the KM matrix and the supersymmetry breaking soft terms in the\nsquark sector. We suggest a general parametrisation of the soft analytic terms,\nmore suitable for non-universal supergravity couplings. We point out that for\nflavour dependent soft terms, there are new contributions to the neutron\nelectric dipole moment. Finally, we consider a model with maximal flavour\nmixing in order to estimate the effects due to the renormalisation scale\ndependence.\n","Comment: 27 pages PlainTeX, 3 eps figures."]}]
