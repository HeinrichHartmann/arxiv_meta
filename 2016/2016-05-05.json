Our test statistic is a scaled maximum sample\ncorrelation coefficient where the maximum lag increases at a rate slower than\nthe sample size n. We only require uncorrelatedness under the null hypothesis,\nalong with a moment contraction dependence property that includes mixing and\nnon-mixing sequences, and exploit two wild bootstrap methods for p-value\ncomputation. We operate either on a first order expansion of the sample\ncorrelation, or Delgado and Velasco's (2011) orthogonalized correlation for a\nfixed maximum lag, both to control for the impact of residual estimation. A\nnumerical study shows the first order expansion is superior, especially when\nthe maximum lag is large.

In this analogy, the position of the trap center in real\nspace controls the magnetic fluxes that are inserted through the holes of the\ntorus in momentum space. We illustrate the momentum-space quantum Hall effect\nwith the noninteracting trapped Harper-Hofstadter model, for which we\nnumerically demonstrate how this effect manifests itself in experimental\nobservables. Extension to the interacting trapped Harper-Hofstadter model is\nalso briefly considered.

We propose an explanation for the grand activity maxima in\nthe framework of a solar dynamo model with fluctuating parameters. Solar-type\ndynamos are oscillatory because of the combination of the solar-type\ndifferential rotation with positive (in the Northern hemisphere) alpha-effect.\nAn artificial reversal of the sign in the alpha-effect changes the dynamo to a\nsteady regime with hundreds of times larger magnetic energy compared to the\namplitude of the cyclic dynamo. Sufficiently large and durable fluctuations\nreversing the sign of the alpha-effect during the growth phase of a magnetic\ncycle can, therefore, cause a transient change to a steady dynamo with\nconsiderably increased magnetic energy. This qualitative scenario for grand\nactivity maxima is supported by computations of the dynamo model with a\nfluctuating alpha-effect. The computed statistics of several thousand magnetic\ncycles gives examples of cycles with very high magnetic energy.

Existing approaches of coercion\nresistant authentication systems (CRAS) propose authentication factors such as\nimplicit learning tasks, which are non-transferable, but still have the\ndrawback that an attacker can force the victim (causing stress) to perform the\ntask in order to gain unauthorized access. Alternatively, there could be cases\nwhere the user could claim that they were coerced into giving up the\nauthentication materials, whereas in reality they acted as an insider attacker.\nTherefore, being able to detect stress during authentication also helps to\nachieve non-repudiation in such cases. To address these concerns, we need CRAS\nthat have both the non-transferable property as well as a mechanism to detect\nstress related to coercion. In this paper, we study the feasibility of using\nChill (intensely pleasurable) music as a stimulus to elicit unique\nneuro-physiological responses that can be used as an authenticating factor for\nCRAS. Chill music and stress are both stimuli for a neuro-chemical called\nDopamine. However, they release the Dopamine at different parts of the brain,\nresulting in different neuro-physiological responses, which gives us both the\nnon-transferable and stress-detection properties necessary for CRAS. We have\nexperimentally validated our proposed Chill music based CRAS using human\nsubjects and measuring their neuro-physiological responses on our prototype\nsystem. Based on the 100 samples collected from the subjects, we were able to\nsuccessfully authenticate the subjects with an accuracy of over 90\\%. Our work\nnot only demonstrates the potential of Chill music as a unique stimulus for\nCRAS, but also paves the path of wider adoption of CRAS in general.\n","Comment: 14 pages"]}]

The present paper therefore in some sense \"completes\" the\npicture by showing that even in the most general non-commutative contexts,\ncompletely positive Markov maps satisfying a natural Detailed Balance\ncondition, canonically admit an action on a large class of quantum Orlicz\nspaces. This is achieved by the development of a new interpolation technique,\nspecifically suited to the above context, for extending the action of such maps\nto the appropriate intermediate spaces of the pair $\\langle\nL^\\infty,L^1\\rangle$. Moreover, it is shown that quantum dynamics in the form\nof Markov semigroups described by some Dirichlet forms naturally extends to the\ncontext proposed in [W. A. Majewski, L.E. Labuschagne, Ann.

In this work, we show\nthat deciding the satisfiability of 3-SAT with the property that every literal\nappears in exactly 4 clauses (2 time negated and 2 times not negated), is $\n\\mathbf{NP} $-complete.

A critical step in replicating the self-interference is the estimation\nof the multi-path channel through which the transmitted signal propagates to\nthe antenna. Since there is no prior model on the number of multipath\nreflections, current techniques assume a tap delay line filter (in the RF and\ndigital domain) with a large number of taps, and estimate the taps in the\nanalog and the digital domain.

The damper is assumed to consist of a shaft, with or\nwithout a spherical bulge, oscillating axially in a containing cylinder filled\nwith a viscoplastic material of Bingham type. The response of the damper to a\nforced sinusoidal displacement is studied. In the bulgeless case the\nconfiguration is the annular analogue of the well-known lid-driven cavity\nproblem, but with a sinusoidal rather than constant lid velocity. Navier slip\nis applied to the shaft surface in order to bound the reaction force to finite\nvalues. Starting from a base case, several problem parameters are varied in\nturn in order to study the effects of viscoplasticity, slip, damper geometry\nand oscillation frequency to the damper response. The results show that,\ncompared to Newtonian flow, viscoplasticity causes the damper force to be less\nsensitive to the shaft velocity; this is often a desirable damper property. The\nbulge increases the required force on the damper mainly by generating a\npressure difference across itself; the latter is larger the smaller the gap\nbetween the bulge and the casing is. At high yield stresses or slip\ncoefficients the amount of energy dissipation that occurs due to sliding\nfriction at the shaft-fluid interface is seen to increase significantly. At low\nfrequencies the flow is in quasi steady state, dominated by viscoplastic\nforces, while at higher frequencies the fluid kinetic energy storage and\nrelease also come into the energy balance, introducing hysteresis effects.\n"]}]

Global multi-fluid simulations using a\nfull treatment of the pressure tensor are used to evaluate the influence of\ntemperature anisotropies on the magnetospheric dynamics for an idealized\nsubstorm. The simulations are able to resolve the development of conics over\nthe polar cap which eventually turn into beams in the lobes.

The anisotropic treatment yields much more intense\nauroral currents on the nightside associated with onset and a faster expansion\nphase of the substorm. The plasma entering into the current sheet experiences\nstronger heating in the anisotropic simulations, which increases plasma\ntransport into the equatorial dayside. Hence, the convection of the\nplasmasphere towards the dayside magnetosphere during the growth phase is\naccompanied by a relative increase in Tparallel.
