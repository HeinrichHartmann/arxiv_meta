This leads to a local index theorem on these CR manifolds. As\napplications of our CR index theorem we can prove a CR version of\nGrauert-Riemenschneider criterion, and produce many CR functions on a weakly\npseudoconvex CR manifold with transversal $S^1$ action and many CR sections on\nsome class of CR manifolds, answering some long-standing questions raised by\nKohn and Henkin respectively. We give examples of these CR manifolds, some of\nwhich arise from generalized Brieskorn manifolds. Moreover in some cases,\ntaking an approach which does not rely on the usual one using equivariant\ncohomology neither on strata of the orbifold, we can reinterpret Kawasaki's\nHirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formula for a complex orbifold with an orbifold\nholomorphic line bundle as an index theorem obtained by an integral over a\nsmooth CR manifold which is essentially the circle bundle of this line bundle.\n","Comment: 62 pages"]}]

We only require uncorrelatedness under the null hypothesis,\nalong with a moment contraction dependence property that includes mixing and\nnon-mixing sequences, and exploit two wild bootstrap methods for p-value\ncomputation. We operate either on a first order expansion of the sample\ncorrelation, or Delgado and Velasco's (2011) orthogonalized correlation for a\nfixed maximum lag, both to control for the impact of residual estimation.

We propose an explanation for the grand activity maxima in\nthe framework of a solar dynamo model with fluctuating parameters. Solar-type\ndynamos are oscillatory because of the combination of the solar-type\ndifferential rotation with positive (in the Northern hemisphere) alpha-effect.\nAn artificial reversal of the sign in the alpha-effect changes the dynamo to a\nsteady regime with hundreds of times larger magnetic energy compared to the\namplitude of the cyclic dynamo. Sufficiently large and durable fluctuations\nreversing the sign of the alpha-effect during the growth phase of a magnetic\ncycle can, therefore, cause a transient change to a steady dynamo with\nconsiderably increased magnetic energy. This qualitative scenario for grand\nactivity maxima is supported by computations of the dynamo model with a\nfluctuating alpha-effect. The computed statistics of several thousand magnetic\ncycles gives examples of cycles with very high magnetic energy. Our preliminary\nestimations, however, suggest that the probability of solar superflares is\nextremely low.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 8 figures, accepted by MNRAS"]}]

To address these concerns, we need CRAS\nthat have both the non-transferable property as well as a mechanism to detect\nstress related to coercion. In this paper, we study the feasibility of using\nChill (intensely pleasurable) music as a stimulus to elicit unique\nneuro-physiological responses that can be used as an authenticating factor for\nCRAS. Chill music and stress are both stimuli for a neuro-chemical called\nDopamine. However, they release the Dopamine at different parts of the brain,\nresulting in different neuro-physiological responses, which gives us both the\nnon-transferable and stress-detection properties necessary for CRAS. We have\nexperimentally validated our proposed Chill music based CRAS using human\nsubjects and measuring their neuro-physiological responses on our prototype\nsystem. Based on the 100 samples collected from the subjects, we were able to\nsuccessfully authenticate the subjects with an accuracy of over 90\\%. Our work\nnot only demonstrates the potential of Chill music as a unique stimulus for\nCRAS, but also paves the path of wider adoption of CRAS in general.\n","Comment: 14 pages"]}]

Moreover, embedded device require virtualization\nfor logical isolation of secure and general purpose OSs on a single device. In\nthis paper, we investigate the processor architectures in the mobile and\nembedded space while examining their formal visualizability. We also compare\nthe virtualization solutions enabling coexistence of multiple OSs in Multicore\nProcessor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) mobile and embedded systems. We advocate that\nvirtualization is necessary to manage resource in MPSoC designs and to enable\nBYOD, security, and logical isolation use cases.\n","Comment: International Conference of Global Network for Innovative Technology\n  (IGNITE-2014), Penang, Malaysia"]}]

It is well-known that the vertex set of every graph without\nisolated vertices can be partitioned into two dominating sets \\cite{ID3}.\nDetermining the computational complexity of deciding whether the vertices of a\ngiven connected cubic graph $G$ can be partitioned into independent dominating\nsets remains unsolved. We show that this problem is $ \\mathbf{NP} $-complete,\neven if restricted to (i) connected graphs with only two numbers in their\ndegree sets, (ii) cubic graphs. Finally, we study the relationship between\n1-perfect codes and the incidence coloring of graphs and as another application\nof our complexity results, we prove that for a given cubic graph $G$ deciding\nwhether $G$ is 4-incidence colorable is $ \\mathbf{NP} $-complete.\n","Comment: 12 pages"]}]

The damper is assumed to consist of a shaft, with or\nwithout a spherical bulge, oscillating axially in a containing cylinder filled\nwith a viscoplastic material of Bingham type. The response of the damper to a\nforced sinusoidal displacement is studied. In the bulgeless case the\nconfiguration is the annular analogue of the well-known lid-driven cavity\nproblem, but with a sinusoidal rather than constant lid velocity. Navier slip\nis applied to the shaft surface in order to bound the reaction force to finite\nvalues. Starting from a base case, several problem parameters are varied in\nturn in order to study the effects of viscoplasticity, slip, damper geometry\nand oscillation frequency to the damper response. The results show that,\ncompared to Newtonian flow, viscoplasticity causes the damper force to be less\nsensitive to the shaft velocity; this is often a desirable damper property. The\nbulge increases the required force on the damper mainly by generating a\npressure difference across itself; the latter is larger the smaller the gap\nbetween the bulge and the casing is. At high yield stresses or slip\ncoefficients the amount of energy dissipation that occurs due to sliding\nfriction at the shaft-fluid interface is seen to increase significantly. At low\nfrequencies the flow is in quasi steady state, dominated by viscoplastic\nforces, while at higher frequencies the fluid kinetic energy storage and\nrelease also come into the energy balance, introducing hysteresis effects.\n"]}]

The anisotropic treatment yields much more intense\nauroral currents on the nightside associated with onset and a faster expansion\nphase of the substorm. The plasma entering into the current sheet experiences\nstronger heating in the anisotropic simulations, which increases plasma\ntransport into the equatorial dayside.
