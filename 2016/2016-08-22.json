We prove a convergence result in\nthe multi-phase case. The result establishes convergence towards a weak\nformulation of mean curvature flow in the BV-framework of sets of finite\nperimeter. The proof is based on the interpretation of the thresholding scheme\nas a minimizing movement scheme by Esedoglu et. al..

Indeed, these\nsystems involve many parts and processes but are studied piecewise and their\nliteratures and data are consequently fragmented, distributed and sometimes--at\nleast apparently--inconsistent. This makes it extremely difficult to build\nsignificant explanatory models with the result that effects in these systems\nthat are brought about by many interacting factors are poorly understood.\n  The rule-based approach to modelling has shown some promise for the\nrepresentation of the highly combinatorial systems typically found in\nsignalling where many of the proteins are composed of multiple binding domains,\ncapable of simultaneous interactions, and/or peptide motifs controlled by\npost-translational modifications. However, the rule-based approach requires\nhighly detailed information about the precise conditions for each and every\ninteraction which is rarely available from any one single source.

This meta-model is a\ngeneralization of that used by Kappa and BNGL which allows for the flexible\nrepresentation of knowledge at various levels of granularity.

When only a small subset M of monomials appear in the equations\n(fewnomial systems), the number of solutions may decrease dramatically. We\nfocus in this work on subsets of quadratic monomials M such that generic\nsystems with support M do not admit any solution at all. For these systems,\nHilbert's Nullstellensatz ensures the existence of algebraic certificates of\ninconsistency. However, up to our knowledge all known bounds on the sizes of\nsuch certificates -including those which take into account the Newton polytopes\nof the polynomials- are exponential in n. Our main results show that if the\ninequality 2|M| -- 2n $\\le$ $\\sqrt$ 1 + 8{\\nu} -- 1 holds for a quadratic\nfewnomial system -- where {\\nu} is the matching number of a graph associated\nwith M, and |M| is the cardinality of M -- then there exists generically a\ncertificate of inconsistency of linear size (measured as the number of\ncoefficients in the ground field K). Moreover this certificate can be computed\nwithin a polynomial number of arithmetic operations. Next, we evaluate how\noften this inequality holds, and we give evidence that the probability that the\ninequality is satisfied depends strongly on the number of squares. More\nprecisely, we show that if M is picked uniformly at random among the subsets of\nn + k + 1 quadratic monomials containing at least $\\Omega$(n 1/2+$\\epsilon$)\nsquares, then the probability that the inequality holds tends to 1 as n grows.\nInterestingly, this phenomenon is related with the matching number of random\ngraphs in the Erd{\\\"o}s-Renyi model. Finally, we provide experimental results\nshowing that certificates in inconsistency can be computed for systems with\nmore than 10000 variables and equations.\n","Comment: ISSAC 2016, Jul 2016, Waterloo, Canada.

A precise understanding of the uncertainty associated with first\nprinciples density functional theory calculated property values is important\nfor the success of descriptor-based screening. Bayesian error estimation\napproach has been built-in to several recently developed exchange-correlation\nfunctionals, which allows an estimate of the uncertainty associated with\nproperties related to the ground state energy, for e.g. adsorption energies.\nHere, we propose a robust and computationally efficient method for quantifying\nuncertainty in mechanical properties, which depends on the derivatives of the\nenergy.

At each strain, we use instead of a\nsingle energy, an ensemble of energies, giving us an ensemble of fits and\nthereby, an ensemble of mechanical properties associated with each fit, whose\nspread can be used to quantify its uncertainty. The generation of ensemble of\nenergies is only a post-processing step involving a perturbation of parameters\nof the exchange-correlation functional and solving for the energy non-self\nconsistently. The proposed method is computationally efficient and provides a\nmore robust uncertainty estimate compared to the approach of self-consistent\ncalculations employing several different exchange-correlation functionals.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no known general\nsolution to this problem. Indeed, a solution is only available for a few\nexamples: planes, spheres, or cylinders. Generally, the characterization of\nsuch curves, both in Euclidean ($E^3$) and in Lorentz-Minkowski ($E_1^3$)\nspaces, involves an ODE relating curvature and torsion. By equipping a curve\nwith a relatively parallel moving frame, Bishop was able to characterize\nspherical curves in $E^3$ through a linear equation relating the coefficients\nwhich dictate the frame motion. Here we apply these ideas to surfaces that are\nimplicitly defined by a smooth function, $\\Sigma=F^{-1}(c)$, by reinterpreting\nthe problem in the context of the metric given by the Hessian of $F$, which is\nnot always positive definite. So, we are naturally led to the study of curves\nin $E_1^3$. We develop a systematic approach to the construction of Bishop\nframes by exploiting the symmetry of the normal planes induced by the casual\ncharacter of the curve, present a complete characterization of spherical curves\nin $E_1^3$, and apply it to characterize curves that belong to a non-degenerate\nEuclidean quadric. We also interpret the casual character that a curve may\nassume when we pass from $E^3$ to $E_1^3$ and finally establish a criterion for\na curve to lie on a level surface of a smooth function, which reduces to a\nlinear equation when the Hessian is constant.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 3 figures; this new version contains misprints corrections\n  and some improvements (mainly on the last section).

In this paper, we\npropose an efficient architecture to train a deep character-level neural\nmachine translation by introducing a decimator and an interpolator. The\ndecimator is used to sample the source sequence before encoding while the\ninterpolator is used to resample after decoding. Such a deep model has two\nmajor advantages. It avoids the large vocabulary issue radically; at the same\ntime, it is much faster and more memory-efficient in training than conventional\ncharacter-based models. More interestingly, our model is able to translate the\nmisspelled word like human beings.\n"]}]

Here, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics\nof the electronic structure of the layered semiconductor Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ using\ntime- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. We show that below the\ncritical excitation density of $F_{\\mathrm{C}}= 0.2$ mJ cm$^{-2}$, the direct\nband gap is transiently reduced, while it is enhanced above $F_{\\mathrm{C}}$.\nAn analysis based on Hartree-Fock calculations reveals that this intriguing\neffect can be explained by the exotic low-temperature ordered state of\nTa$_2$NiSe$_5$, which hosts an exciton condensate whose order parameter is\nconnected to the gap size. These results demonstrate the ability to manipulate\ncondensates of bound electron-hole pairs with light, and due to the similarity\nto BCS theory, this approach might also be applicable to the case of\nsuperconductors.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Existing solutions typically require intermediate\nresults of individual operators to be materialized into temporary tables to be\nconsidered for reuse in subsequent queries. However, these approaches are\nfundamentally ill-suited for use in modern main memory databases. The reason is\nthat modern main memory DBMSs are typically limited by the bandwidth of the\nmemory bus, thus query execution is heavily optimized to keep tuples in the CPU\ncaches and registers. To that end, adding additional materialization operations\ninto a query plan not only add additional traffic to the memory bus but more\nimportantly prevent the important cache- and register-locality opportunities\nresulting in high performance penalties.\n  In this paper we study a novel reuse model for intermediates, which caches\ninternal physical data structures materialized during query processing (due to\npipeline breakers) and externalizes them so that they become reusable for\nupcoming operations. We focus on hash tables, the most commonly used internal\ndata structure in main memory databases to perform join and aggregation\noperations. As queries arrive, our reuse-aware optimizer reasons about the\nreuse opportunities for hash tables, employing cost models that take into\naccount hash table statistics together with the CPU and data movement costs\nwithin the cache hierarchy.
