Approximation\nalgorithms for this problem were developed by Guha and Munagala by rounding a\nlinear program that couples the various alternatives together. In this paper we\npresent an index for this problem, which we call the ratio index, which also\nguarantees a constant factor approximation. Index-based policies have the\nadvantage that a single number (i.e. the index) can be computed for each\nalternative irrespective of all other alternatives, and the alternative with\nthe highest index is experimented upon. This is analogous to the famous Gittins\nindex for the discounted multi-armed bandit problem.\n  The ratio index has several interesting structural properties. First, we show\nthat it can be computed in strongly polynomial time. Second, we show that with\nthe appropriate discount factor, the Gittins index and our ratio index are\nconstant factor approximations of each other, and hence the Gittins index also\ngives a constant factor approximation to the budgeted learning problem.\nFinally, we show that the ratio index can be used to create an index-based\npolicy that achieves an O(1)-approximation for the finite horizon version of\nthe multi-armed bandit problem. Moreover, the policy does not require any\nknowledge of the horizon (whereas we compare its performance against an optimal\nstrategy that is aware of the horizon). This yields the following surprising\nresult: there is an index-based policy that achieves an O(1)-approximation for\nthe multi-armed bandit problem, oblivious to the underlying discount factor.\n","Comment: This paper has a substantial bug that we are trying to fix.

The reason is\nthat dislocation dipoles, which play an important role in determining the\nmechanical properties of crystals, often get smeared out when traditional\nhomogenisation methods are applied. To address such difficulties, the\ncollective behaviour of a row of dislocation dipoles is studied by using\nmatched asymptotic techniques.

A line of recent work (4, 19, 24, 20) provided strong theoretical\nguarantee for sparse subspace clustering (4), the state-of-the-art algorithm\nfor subspace clustering, on both noiseless and noisy data sets. It was shown\nthat under mild conditions, with high probability no two points from different\nsubspaces are clustered together. Such guarantee, however, is not sufficient\nfor the clustering to be correct, due to the notorious \"graph connectivity\nproblem\" (15). In this paper, we investigate the graph connectivity problem for\nnoisy sparse subspace clustering and show that a simple post-processing\nprocedure is capable of delivering consistent clustering under certain \"general\nposition\" or \"restricted eigenvalue\" assumptions. We also show that our\ncondition is almost tight with adversarial noise perturbation by constructing a\ncounter-example. These results provide the first exact clustering guarantee of\nnoisy SSC for subspaces of dimension greater then 3.\n","Comment: 14 pages.

Experimental\ntechnologies for directly profiling genomes of single cells are rapidly\nimproving, but they are still impractical for large-scale sampling. Bulk\ngenomic assays remain the standard for population-scale studies, but conflate\nthe influences of mixtures of genetically distinct tumor, stromal, and\ninfiltrating immune cells. Many computational approaches have been developed to\ndeconvolute these mixed samples and reconstruct the genomics of genetically\nhomogeneous clonal subpopulations. All such methods, however, are limited to\nreconstructing only coarse approximations to a few major subpopulations. In\nprior work, we showed that one can improve deconvolution of genomic data by\nleveraging substructure in cellular mixtures through a strategy called\nsimplicial complex inference. This strategy, however, is also limited by the\ndifficulty of inferring mixture structure from sparse, noisy assays.

The resulting design, Datum, decomposes the joint\npurchasing and placement problem into two subproblems, one for data purchasing\nand one for data placement, using a transformation of the underlying bandwidth\ncosts. We show, via a case study, that Datum is near-optimal (within 1.6%) in\npractical settings.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Alternative compositional-based methods,\nwhich exploit sequence composition by profiling local short k-mers in\nfragments, are often faster but less accurate than alignment-based methods.\nInspired by the success of linear error correcting codes in noisy channel\ncommunication, we introduce Opal, a fast and accurate novel compositional-based\nbinning method.

Opal not only performs up to two orders of magnitude faster than BWA,\nan alignment-based binning method, but also achieves improved binning accuracy\nand robustness to sequencing errors.

While there has been much work on different regularizers\nmany modern algorithms still use a data cost that is not very different from\nthe ones used over 30 years ago: a robust version of brightness constancy or\ngradient constancy. In this paper we leverage the recent availability of\nground-truth optical flow databases in order to learn a data cost. Specifically\nwe take a generative approach in which the data cost models the distribution of\nnoise after warping an image according to the flow and we measure the\n\"goodness\" of a data cost by how well it matches the true distribution of flow\nwarp error. Consistent with current practice, we find that robust versions of\ngradient constancy are better models than simple brightness constancy but a\nlearned GMM that models the density of patches of warp error gives a much\nbetter fit than any existing assumption of constancy. This significant\nadvantage of the GMM is due to an explicit modeling of the spatial structure of\nwarp errors, a feature which is missing from almost all existing data costs in\noptical flow. Finally, we show how a good density model of warp error patches\ncan be used for optical flow estimation on whole images. We replace the data\ncost by the expected patch log-likelihood (EPLL), and show how this cost can be\noptimized iteratively using an additional step of denoising the warp error\nimage. The results of our experiments are promising and show that patch models\nwith higher likelihood lead to better optical flow estimation.\n"]}]

This discrepancy can, in part, be attributed to several\nfactors: obtaining neuronal shapes is a prerequisite first step in extracting a\nconnectome, manual tracing is much more time-consuming than annotating\nsynapses, and neuronal contact area can be used as a proxy for synapses in\ndetermining connections.\n  However, recent research has demonstrated that contact area alone is not a\nsufficient predictor of synaptic connection. Moreover, as segmentation has\nimproved, we have observed that synapse annotation is consuming a more\nsignificant fraction of overall reconstruction time. This ratio will only get\nworse as segmentation improves, gating overall possible speed-up. Therefore, we\naddress this problem by developing algorithms that automatically detect\npre-synaptic neurons and their post-synaptic partners. In particular,\npre-synaptic structures are detected using a Deep and Wide Multiscale Recursive\nNetwork, and post-synaptic partners are detected using a MLP with features\nconditioned on the local segmentation.\n  This work is novel because it requires minimal amount of training, leverages\nadvances in image segmentation directly, and provides a complete solution for\npolyadic synapse detection. We further introduce novel metrics to evaluate our\nalgorithm on connectomes of meaningful size. These metrics demonstrate that\ncomplete automatic prediction can be used to effectively characterize most\nconnectivity correctly.\n"]}]

Aptamers are identified in vitro via the Systematic\nEvolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) protocol. SELEX selects\nbinders through an iterative process that, starting from a pool of random\nssDNA/RNA sequences, amplifies target-affine species through a series of\nselection cycles. HT-SELEX, which combines SELEX with high throughput\nsequencing, has recently transformed aptamer development and has opened the\nfield to even more applications. HT-SELEX is capable of generating over half a\nbillion data points, challenging computational scientists with the task of\nidentifying aptamer properties such as sequence structure motifs that determine\nbinding. While currently available motif finding approaches suggest partial\nsolutions to this question, none possess the generality or scalability required\nfor HT-SELEX data, and they do not take advantage of important properties of\nthe experimental procedure.\n  We present AptaTRACE, a novel approach for the identification of\nsequence-structure binding motifs in HT-SELEX derived aptamers. Our approach\nleverages the experimental design of the SELEX protocol and identifies\nsequence-structure motifs that show a signature of selection. Because of its\nunique approach, AptaTRACE can uncover motifs even when these are present in\nonly a minuscule fraction of the pool. Due to these features, our method can\nhelp to reduce the number of selection cycles required to produce aptamers with\nthe desired properties, thus reducing cost and time of this rather expensive\nprocedure. The performance of the method on simulated and real data indicates\nthat AptaTRACE can detect sequence-structure motifs even in highly challenging\ndata.\n","Comment: This paper was selected for oral presentation at RECOMB 2016 and an\n  abstract is published in the conference proceedings"]}]

Examples are supercooled liquids, whose dynamics slow down under\ncooling. The specific pattern of slowing-down depends on the material\nconsidered. This dependence is poorly understood, in particular, it remains\ngenerally unclear which aspects of the microscopic structures control the\ndynamics and other macroscopic properties. Attacking this question is one of\nthe two main aspects of this dissertation. We have introduced a new class of\nmodels of supercooled liquids, which captures the central aspects of the\ncorrespondence between structure and elasticity on the one hand, the\ncorrelation of structure and thermodynamic and dynamic properties on the other.\nOur results shed new light on the temperature-dependence of the topology of\ncovalent networks, in particular, on the rigidity transition that occurs when\nthe valence is increased.\n  Other questions appear in glassy systems at zero temperature. In that\nsituation, a glassy system can flow if an external driving force is imposed\nabove some threshold. The first example we will consider is the erosion of a\nriverbed. Experiments support the existence of a threshold forcing, below which\nno erosion flux is observed. In this dissertation, we present a novel\nmicroscopic model to describe the erosion near threshold. This model makes new\nquantitative predictions for the spatial reparation of the flux. To study\nfurther the self-organization of driven glassy systems, we investigate the\nathermal dynamics of mean-field spin glasses. The spin glass self-organizes\ninto the configurations that are stable, but barely so. Such marginal stability\nappears with the presence of a pseudogap in soft excitations. We show that the\nemergence of a pseudogap is deeply related to very strong anti-correlations\nemerging among soft excitations.\n","Comment: PhD thesis, Advisor: Matthieu Wyart"]}]
