Despite the simplicity with which the problem can be\nstated, the solution involves complex statistical issues that require careful\nanalysis. In contrast to the confidence bound, this concept has never been\nformally analyzed, leading to a great variety of often ad hoc solutions. Here\nwe formulate and describe the problem in a self-consistent manner. Detection\nsignificance is usually defined by the acceptable proportion of false positives\n(the TypeI error), and we invoke the complementary concept of false negatives\n(the TypeII error), based on the statistical power of a test, to compute an\nupper limit to the detectable source intensity. To determine the minimum\nintensity that a source must have for it to be detected, we first define a\ndetection threshold, and then compute the probabilities of detecting sources of\nvarious intensities at the given threshold. The intensity that corresponds to\nthe specified TypeII error probability defines that minimum intensity, and is\nidentified as the upper limit. Thus, an upper limit is a characteristic of the\ndetection procedure rather than the strength of any particular source and\nshould not be confused with confidence intervals or other estimates of source\nintensity. This is particularly important given the large number of catalogs\nthat are being generated from increasingly sensitive surveys. We discuss the\ndifferences between these upper limits and confidence bounds. Both measures are\nuseful quantities that should be reported in order to extract the most science\nfrom catalogs, though they answer different statistical questions: an upper\nbound describes an inference range on the source intensity, while an upper\nlimit calibrates the detection process. We provide a recipe for computing upper\nlimits that applies to all detection algorithms.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 12 figures, accepted in ApJ"]}]

Experimentally, it is known that\nmultivalent counterions have strong effect on the DNA condensation phenomenon.\nWhile tri- and tetra-valent counterions are shown to easily condense free DNA\nmolecules in solution into toroidal bundles, the situation with divalent\ncounterions are not as clear cut.

However, if\nthe configuration entropy of DNA is restricted, these attractions are enough to\ncause appreciable effects.

X-ray reverberation is detected from an\nincreasing sample of Seyfert galaxies and a number of common properties are\nobserved, including a transition from the characteristic reverberation\nsignature at high frequencies to a hard lag within the continuum component at\nlow frequencies, as well a pronounced dip in the reverberation lag at 3keV.\nThese features are not trivially explained by the reverberation of X-rays\noriginating from simple point sources. We therefore model reverberation from\ncoronae extended both over the surface of the disc and vertically. Causal\npropagation through its extent for both the simple case of constant velocity\npropagation and propagation linked to the viscous timescale in the underlying\naccretion disc is included as well as stochastic variability arising due to\nturbulence locally on the disc. We find that the observed features of X-ray\nreverberation in Seyfert galaxies can be explained if the long timescale\nvariability is dominated by the viscous propagation of fluctuations through the\ncorona. The corona extends radially at low height over the surface of the disc\nbut with a bright central region in which fluctuations propagate up the black\nhole rotation axis driven by more rapid variability arising from the innermost\nregions of the accretion flow.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 24 figures.

The original representation assigns to each nucleotide base a\nprime integer quaternion of norm 7 and involves a function that associates with\neach codon, represented by three of these quaternions, another integer\nquaternion (amino acid type quaternion) in such a way that the essentials of\nthe standard genetic code (particulaty its degeneration) are preserved. To show\nthe advantages of such a quaternionic representation we have, in turn,\nassociated with each amino acid of a given protein, besides of the type\nquaternion, another real one according to its order along the protein (order\nquaternion) and have designed an algorithm to go from the primary to the\ntertiary structure of the protein by using type and order quaternions. In this\ncontext, we incorporate chirality in our representation by observing that the\nset of eight integer quaternions of norm 7 can be partitioned into a pair of\nsubsets of cardinality four each with their elements mutually conjugates and by\nputting they in correspondence one to one with the two sets of enantiomers (D\nand L) of the four nucleotide bases adenine, cytosine, guanine and uracil,\nrespectively. Thus, guided by two diagrams proposed for the codes evolution, we\ndefine functions that in each case assign a L- (D-) amino acid type integer\nquaternion to the triplets of D- (L-) bases. The assignation is such that for a\ngiven D-amino acid, the associated integer quaternion is the conjugate of that\none corresponding to the enantiomer L. The chiral type quaternions obtained for\nthe amino acids are used, together with a common set of order quaternions, to\ndescribe the folding of the two classes, L and D, of homochiral proteins.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 9 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:1505.04656"]}]

The approach is based on sum-of-squares and semi-definite\nprogramming techniques. It is applicable to dynamical systems whose right-hand\nside is a polynomial function in the state variables and the controls. The key\nidea, first described but not implemented in (Chernyshenko et al., Phil. Trans.\nR. Soc.

As such, controller design requires the\nsimultaneous optimization of both the control law and a tunable function,\nsimilar to a Lyapunov function. The present paper introduces a method resolving\nthe well-known inherent non-convexity of this kind of optimization. The method\nis based on the formal assumption that the control is expensive, from which it\nfollows that the optimal control is small. The resulting asymptotic\noptimization problems are convex. The derivation of all the polynomial\ncoefficients in the controller is given in terms of the solvability conditions\nof state-dependent linear and bilinear inequalities. The proposed approach is\napplied to the problem of designing a full-information feedback controller that\nmitigates vortex shedding in the wake of a circular cylinder in the laminar\nregime via rotary oscillations.

Although\nexperimental data on dependence of Sh on Re for various ice crystals of\ninterest in cloud physics have been previously obtained, extrapolation of the\ndata to smaller particles for Re=0 has been unreliable. We present a simple\ncomputational algorithm for computing Sh at Re=0 for various crystals of\ninterest, which will allow proper coverage over the whole Re range applicable\nto ice crystals. The method we present can be applied to any crystal of\nrectilinear shape. The approach was as follows: the model crystal is positioned\nin a box and an electric field is applied between the crystal and the box,\nsimulating the initial growth stage of ice crystals. Using a finite Cartesian\ngrid system of variable lattice separations, the corners of ice crystal are\nassigned to particular lattice points, thereby defining the geometry of the\ncrystal. A discrete version of Gauss' flux law is developed and used for this\nlattice system. Sh (at Re=0) is obtained for hexagonal plates, hexagonal\ncolumns, broad branched crystals, stellar crystals, and capped columns. Our\ncalculations reveal that our simple computational algorithm provides the values\nof Sh for these shapes to within 5% error from the values obtained through\nestimates in previous studies.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures, to be published in proceedings of \"14th\n  International Conference on Clouds and Precipitation\""]}]
