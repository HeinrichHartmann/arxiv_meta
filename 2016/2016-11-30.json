At low temperatures, solvent molecules are bound to the polymer and\nthe solvophobicity of the polymer is screened, resulting in a coiled state. At\nhigh temperatures the entropy loss due to bound solvent offsets the energy gain\ndue to binding which causes the solvent molecules to unbind, leading to the\ncollapse of the polymer chain to a globular state. Furthermore, the coarse\ngrained nature of these models indicates that mean interaction energies are\nsufficient to explain LCST in comparison to specific solvent structural\narrangements.\n"]}]

A well-known\ndimensionality reduction theorem due to Johnson and Lindenstrauss yields a\nsketch of size $O(\\epsilon^{-2} \\log (\\Phi n) n\\log n)$, i.e., $O(\\epsilon^{-2}\n\\log (\\Phi n) \\log n)$ bits per point. We show that this bound is not optimal,\nand can be substantially improved to $O(\\epsilon^{-2}\\log(1/\\epsilon) \\cdot\n\\log n + \\log\\log \\Phi)$ bits per point.

Within the MHD paradigm, we study the impact of\nvarying the atmospheric plasma $\\beta$ on the generation and properties of\nsolar-like jets.\n  The parametric study validates our model of jets for plasma $\\beta$ ranging\nfrom $10^{-3}$ to $1$, typical of the different layers and magnetic\nenvironments of the solar atmosphere. Our model of jets can robustly explain\nthe generation of helical solar jet-like events at various $\\beta \\le 1$. This\nstudy introduces the new result that the plasma $\\beta$ modifies the morphology\nof the helical jet, explaining the different observed shapes of jets at\ndifferent scales and in different layers of the solar atmosphere.\n  Our results allow us to understand the energisation, triggering, and driving\nprocesses of jet-like events. Our model allows us to make predictions of the\nimpulsiveness and energetics of jets as determined by the surrounding\nenvironment, as well as the morphological properties of the resulting jets.\n","Comment: Accepted in Astronomy and Astrophysics"]}]

The Kepler space mission led to a large amount of high-precision\ntime series of solar-like oscillators. Using a Bayesian analysis that combines\nasteroseismic techniques and additional ground-based observations, the mass,\nradius, luminosity, and distance of those stars can be estimated with good\nprecision. This has given a new impetus to the research field of galactic\narcheology. Aims. The first data release of the Gaia space mission contains the\nTGAS catalog with parallax estimates for more than 2 million stars, including\nmany of the Kepler targets. Our goal is to make a first proper comparison of\nasteroseismic and astrometric parallaxes of a selection of dwarfs, subgiants,\nand red giants observed by Kepler for which asteroseismic distances were\npublished. Methods. We compare asteroseismic and astrometric distances of\nsolar-like pulsators using an appropriate statistical errors-in- variables\nmodel on a linear as well as on a logarithmic scale. Results. For a sample of\n22 dwarf and subgiant solar-like oscillators, the TGAS parallaxes considerably\nimproved the Hipparcos ones, yet the excellent agreement between asteroseismic\nand astrometric distances still holds. For a sample of 938 Kepler pulsating red\ngiants, the TGAS parallaxes are much more uncertain than the asteroseismic\nones, making it worthwhile to validate the former with the latter. From\nerrors-in-variables modelling we find a significant discrepancy between the\nTGAS parallaxes and the asteroseismic ones. Conclusions. For the sample of\ndwarfs and subgiants, the comparison between astrometric and asteroseismic\nparallaxes does not require a revision of the stellar models on the basis of\nTGAS. For the sample of red giants, we identify possible causes of the\ndiscrepancy, which we will likely be able to resolve with the more precise Gaia\nparallaxes of the upcoming releases.\n","Comment: Accepted by A&A"]}]

Images are ranked by matching object detection outputs\n(bounding boxes) to 2D layout candidates (also represented by bounding boxes)\nwhich are obtained by projecting the 3D scenes with sampled camera directions.\nWe validate our approach using public indoor scene datasets and show that our\nmethod outperforms an object occurrence based and a learned 2D pairwise\nrelation based baselines.\n"]}]

Many recent\nmaterial recognition methods treat materials as yet another set of labels like\nobjects. Materials are, however, fundamentally different from objects as they\nhave no inherent shape or defined spatial extent. This makes local material\nrecognition particularly hard. Global image context, such as where the material\nis or what object it makes up, can be crucial to recognizing the material.\nExisting methods, however, operate on an implicit fusion of materials and\ncontext by using large receptive fields as input (i.e., large image patches).\nSuch an approach can only take advantage of limited context as it appears\nduring training, and will be bounded by the combinations seen in the training\ndata. We instead show that recognizing materials purely from their local\nappearance and integrating separately recognized global contextual cues\nincluding objects and places leads to superior dense, per-pixel, material\nrecognition. We achieve this by training a fully-convolutional material\nrecognition network end-to-end with only material category supervision. We\nintegrate object and place estimates to this network from independent CNNs.\nThis approach avoids the necessity of preparing an infeasible amount of\ntraining data that covers the product space of materials, objects, and scenes,\nwhile fully leveraging contextual cues for dense material recognition.\nExperimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach and show that\nour method outperforms past methods that build on inseparable material and\ncontextual information.\n"]}]

To form SMSs by accretion, central protostars must\naccrete at as high rates as ~ 0.1-1 M_sun/yr.

If the envelope matter is allowed to\nflow out, however, a stellar wind could be launched and hinder the accretion\ngrowth of SGPSs before reaching the supermassive regime. We examine whether\nradiation-driven winds are launched from SGPSs by constructing steady and\nspherically symmetric wind solutions. We find that the wind velocity does not\nreach the escape velocity in any case considered. This is because once the\ntemperature falls below ~ 10^4 K, the opacity plummet drastically owing to the\nrecombination of hydrogen and the acceleration ceases suddenly. This indicates\nthat, in realistic non-steady cases, even if outflows are launched from the\nsurface of SGPSs, they would fall back again. Such a \"wind\" does not result in\nnet mass loss and does not prevent the growth of SGPSs.

In fact, the quenching\ndistance is related to the energy transfer between the dipole that acts as a\ndonor and the metallic surface acting as an acceptor.

However, the performance of the EKF degrades\nconsiderably in highly non-linear system applications as it requires local\nlinearisation in its prediction stage. The Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) was\ndeveloped to address the non-linearity in the system by deterministic sampling.\nThe UKF provides better estimation accuracy than the EKF for highly non-linear\nsystems. However, the UKF requires multiple propagations of sampled state\nvectors in the measurement interval, which results in higher processing time\nthan for the EKF. This paper proposes an application of two newly developed UKF\nvariants in launch vehicle navigation. These two algorithms called the Single\nPropagation Unscented Kalman Filter (SPUKF) and the Extrapolated Single\nPropagation Unscented Kalman Filter (ESPUKF), reduce the processing time of the\noriginal UKF significantly and provide estimation accuracies comparable to the\nUKF. The estimation performance of the SPUKF and the ESPUKF is demonstrated\nusing Falcon 9 V1.1 launch vehicle in CRS-5 mission scenario. The launch\nvehicle trajectory for the mission is generated using publicly available\nmission parameters. A SPIRENT GNSS simulator is used to generate the received\nGPS signal on the trajectory.

Numerical\nsimulations allow a determination of the spatial dependence of all the\ncomponents of the stress field as a function of systems size, the coefficient\nof static friction and the frictional interaction with the bottom surface. Our\nstudy clearly demonstrates that interaction with the bottom surface plays a\ncrucial role in the formation of a pressure dip under the apex of a granular\npile. Basic to the theory of sandpiles are assumptions about the form of\nscaling solutions and constitutive relations for cohesive-less hard grains for\nwhich no typical scale is available. We find that these constitutive relations\nmust be modified; moreover for smaller friction coefficients and smaller piles\nthese scaling assumptions break down in the bulk of the sandpile due to the\npresence of length scales that must be carefully identified. After identifying\nthe crucial scale we provide a predictive theory to when scaling solutions are\nexpected to break down. At the bottom of the pile the scaling assumption always\nbreaks, due to the different interactions with the bottom surface. The\nconsequences for measurable quantities like the pressure distribution and shear\nstress at the bottom of the pile are discussed.

In\nthis study, a fully automatic method to detect oral lesions in mandibular\nregion from dental CT images is proposed. Two methods were developed to\nrecognize two types of lesions namely (1) Close border (CB) lesions and (2)\nOpen border (OB) lesions, which cover most of the lesion types that can be\nfound on CT images. For the detection of CB lesions, fifteen features were\nextracted from each initial lesion candidates and multi layer perceptron (MLP)\nneural network was used to classify suspicious regions. Moreover, OB lesions\nwere detected using a rule based image processing method, where no feature\nextraction or classification algorithm were used. The results were validated\nusing a CT dataset of 52 patients, where 22 patients had abnormalities and 30\npatients were normal. Using non-training dataset, CB detection algorithm\nyielded 71% sensitivity with 0.31 false positives per patient.

Second, we\nshow that quantum isomorphism is equivalent to the feasibility of two\npolynomial systems in non-commuting variables, obtained by relaxing the\nstandard integer programming formulations for graph isomorphism to Hermitian\nvariables. On the basis of this correspondence, we show that quantum isomorphic\ngraphs are necessarily cospectral. Finally, we provide a construction for\nproducing quantum isomorphic graphs that are nevertheless not isomorphic. Our\nconstruction makes use of linear binary constraint system games and is related\nto the FGLSS reduction of inapproximability literature.\n"]}]
