They dictate how physical systems of diverse nature, ranging from\nfundamental particles to crystalline materials, respond topologically to\nexternal perturbations, insensitive to local details. The anomaly paradigm was\ntriggered by the discovery of the chiral anomaly that contributes to the decay\nof pions into photons and influences the motion of superfluid vortices in\n$^3$He-A. In the solid state, it also fundamentally affects the properties of\ntopological Weyl and Dirac semimetals, recently realized experimentally in\nTaAs, Na$_3$Bi, Cd$_3$As$_2$, and ZrTe$_{5}$. In this work we propose that the\nmost identifying consequence of the chiral anomaly, the charge density\nimbalance between fermions of different chirality induced by non-orthogonal\nelectric and magnetic fields, can be directly observed in these materials with\nthe existing technology of photoemission spectroscopy. With angle resolution,\nthe chiral anomaly is identified by a characteristic note-shaped pattern of the\nemission spectra, originating from the imbalanced occupation of the bulk states\nand a previously unreported momentum dependent energy shift of the surface\nstate Fermi arcs. We further demonstrate that the chiral anomaly likewise\nleaves an imprint in angle averaged emission spectra, facilitating its\nexperimental detection. Thereby, our work provides essential theoretical input\nto foster the direct visualization of the chiral anomaly in condensed matter.\n","Comment: 5+4 pages, 6 Figures, 1 Table, extended discussion and appendix"]}]

The origin of this enhanced emission seems to be\nrelated to the penetration of the inner pulsar magnetosphere by the accretion\ndisk. We propose that the radiation processes, characteristic for the rotation\npowered pulsar, can co-exist with the presence of an accretion disk in the\ninner pulsar magnetosphere. In our scenario additional $\\gamma$-ray emission is\nproduced by secondary leptons, originated close to the acceleration gap, which\nCompton up-scatter thermal radiation from the accretion disk to GeV energies.\nThe accretion disk penetrates deep into the pulsar magnetosphere allowing the\nmatter to fall onto the NS surface producing pulsed X-ray emission. We show\nthat the sum of the rotation powered pulsar $\\gamma$-ray emission, produced by\nthe primary electrons in the curvature process, and the $\\gamma$-ray emission,\nproduced by secondary leptons, can explain the observed high energy radiation\nfrom the redback binary pulsar PSR J1227-4853 in the state with evidences of\nthe accretion disk.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 3 figures, MNRAS Lett., accepted"]}]

Fourth generation \"Long Term Evolution\" (LTE) mobile\ncommunication networks are being deployed. The LTE suite of specifications is\nconsidered to be significantly better than its predecessors not only in terms\nof functionality but also with respect to security and privacy for subscribers.\n  We carefully analyzed LTE access network protocol specifications and\nuncovered several vulnerabilities. Using commercial LTE mobile devices in real\nLTE networks, we demonstrate inexpensive, and practical attacks exploiting\nthese vulnerabilities. Our first class of attacks consists of three different\nways of making an LTE device leak its location: A semi-passive attacker can\nlocate an LTE device within a 2 sq.km area within a city whereas an active\nattacker can precisely locate an LTE device using GPS co-ordinates or\ntrilateration via cell-tower signal strength information. Our second class of\nattacks can persistently deny some or all services to a target LTE device. To\nthe best of our knowledge, our work constitutes the first publicly reported\npractical attacks against LTE access network protocols.\n  We present several countermeasures to resist our specific attacks. We also\ndiscuss possible trade-offs that may explain why these vulnerabilities exist\nand recommend that safety margins introduced into future specifications to\naddress such trade-offs should incorporate greater agility to accommodate\nsubsequent changes in the trade-off equilibrium.\n"]}]

The latter should be manifested by a characteristic decay to 3\nphotons which should be observed soon. We adapt the previous analysis of\npossible detection of the HCA at the LHC by Brustein and Oaknin and by Elfgren\nto the case that the mass of the HCA is 750 GeV and find the expected cross\nsection and decay width in terms of the HCA coupling. We find that the expected\ncross-section fits well the observed number of excess events and that there is\ntension between the measured cross-section and the reported partial decay\nwidth. The tension is caused because for both VBF and AP the production\ncross-section and the decay width depend linearly on each other. We therefore\nexpect that if the new resonance is indeed the HCA, either its width should be\nsignificantly smaller than the reported width or the production cross-section\nshould be significantly higher than the reported one.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 2 figures, V2: minor corrections to numerical estimates of\n  the decay width, total vs. partial width and references added"]}]

A\nComposition-Diamond lemma for associative conformal algebras is firstly\nestablished by Bokut, Fong, and Ke in 2004 \\cite{BFK04} which claims that if\n(i) $S$ is a Gr\\\"obner-Shirshov basis in $C(B,N)$, then (ii) the set of\n$S$-irreducible words is a linear basis of the quotient conformal algebra\n$C(B,N|S)$, but not conversely. In this paper, by introducing some new\ndefinitions of normal $S$-words, compositions and compositions to be trivial,\nwe give a new Composition-Diamond lemma for associative conformal algebras\nwhich makes the conditions (i) and (ii) equivalent. We show that for each ideal\n$I$ of $C(B,N)$, $I$ has a unique reduced Gr\\\"obner-Shirshov basis. As\napplications, we show that Loop Virasoro Lie conformal algebra and Loop\nHeisenberg-Virasoro Lie conformal algebra are embeddable into their universal\nenveloping associative conformal algebras.\n","Comment: 49 pages"]}]

Most of existing\napproaches directly construct features mapped to raw data (e.g., ICD or CPT\ncodes), or utilize some ontology mapping such as SNOMED codes.

It is demonstrated that PSR oscillations will be self-excited under both\nsymmetric and asymmetric conditions, if (i) the charge-voltage relation of the\nplasma sheaths deviates from a simple quadratic behavior and if (ii) the\ninductance of the plasma bulk exhibits a temporal modulation. These two effects\nhave been neglected up to now, but we show that they must be included in the\nmodel in order to properly describe the nonlinear series resonance circuit and\nreproduce the self-excitation of PSR oscillations, which are observed in the\nelectron current density resulting from simulations of geometrically symmetric\nCCRF plasmas. Furthermore, the effect of the PSR self-excitation on the\ndischarge current and the plasma properties, such as the potential profile, is\nillustrated by applying Fourier analysis. High frequency oscillations in the\nentire spectrum between the applied frequencies and the local electron plasma\nfrequency are observed. As a consequence, the electron heating is strongly\nenhanced by the presence of PSR oscillations.\n"]}]
