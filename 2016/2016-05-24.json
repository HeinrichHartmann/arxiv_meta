Here we suggest\nusing gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters to test such a marriage of\nneutrino HDM and modified gravity, adopting the framework of\ntensor-vector-scalar theory (TeVeS). Unlike conventional cold dark matter\n(CDM), such HDM is subject to strong phase-space constraints, which allows one\nto check cluster lens models inferred within the modified framework for\nconsistency. Since the considered HDM particles cannot collapse into\narbitrarily dense clumps and only form structures well above the galactic\nscale, systems which indicate the need for dark substructure are of particular\ninterest. As a first example, we study the cluster lens Abell 2390 and its\nimpressive straight arc with the help of numerical simulations. Based on our\nresults, we outline a general and systematic approach to model cluster lenses\nin TeVeS which significantly reduces the calculation complexity. We further\nconsider a simple bimodal lens configuration, capable of producing the straight\narc, to demonstrate our approach. We find that such a model is marginally\nconsistent with the hypothesis of 11eV SNs.

The traditional diffusion approach of the\nSmoluchowski theory for coagulation of colloids is critically analyzed and\nshown to be valid only in the particular case of coalescence of small particles\nwith large ones. It is shown that, owing to rapid diffusion mixing, coalescence\nof comparable size particles occurs in the kinetic regime, realized under\ncondition of homogeneous spatial distribution of particles, in the two modes,\ncontinuum and free molecular. Transition from the continuum to the free\nmolecular mode can be described by the interpolation expression derived within\nthe new analytical approach with fitting parameters that can be specified\nnumerically, avoiding semi-empirical assumptions of the traditional models. A\nsimilar restriction arises in the traditional approach to the diffusion-limited\nreaction rate theory, based on generalization of the Smoluchowski theory for\ncoagulation of colloids. In particular, it is shown that the traditional\napproach is applicable only to the special case of reactions with a large\nreaction radius, and becomes inappropriate to calculation of the reaction rate\nin the case of a relatively small reaction radius. In the latter, more general\ncase particles collisions occur mainly in the kinetic regime (rather than in\nthe diffusion one) characterized by homogeneous (at random) spatial\ndistribution of particles. The calculated reaction rate for a small reaction\nradius in 3-d formally coincides with the expression derived in the traditional\napproach for reactions with a large reaction radius, however, notably deviates\nat large times from the traditional result in the plane (2-d) geometry, that\nhas wide applications also in the membrane biology as well as in some other\nimportant areas.\n","Comment: 2 parts, 122 pages, 30 figures"]}]

A well-known solution for this problem is the\n{\\em $\\eps$-approximation}, which is a subset $A\\subseteq P$ that can estimate\nthe number of points in $P\\cap R$ with the number of points in $A\\cap R$.

Here we focus in particular on static\nfriction, the minimal sliding force necessary to depin one lattice from the\nother. If the colloid and the optical lattices are mutually commensurate, the\ncolloid sliding is always pinned by static friction; but when they are\nincommensurate the presence or absence of pinning can be expected to depend\nupon the system parameters. If a 2D analogy to the mathematically established\nAubry transition of one-dimensional systems were to hold, an increasing\nperiodic corrugation strength $U_0$ should turn an initially free-sliding\nmonolayer into a pinned state through a well-defined dynamical phase\ntransition. We address this problem by the simulated sliding of a realistic\nmodel 2D colloidal lattice, confirming the existence of a clear and sharp\nsuperlubric-pinned transition for increasing corrugation strength. Unlike the\n1D Aubry transition which is continuous, the 2D transition exhibits a definite\nfirst-order character. With no change of symmetry, the transition entails a\nstructural character, with a sudden increase of the colloid-colloid interaction\nenergy, accompanied by a compensating downward jump of the colloid-corrugation\nenergy. The transition value for the corrugation amplitude $U_0$ depends upon\nthe misalignment angle $\\theta$ between the optical and the colloidal lattices,\nsuperlubricity surviving until larger corrugations for angles away from the\nenergetically favored orientation, which is itself generally slightly\nmisaligned, as shown in recent work.

In addition to ordinary \"integer\" steps, coinciding here with the\nsynchronous rigid advancement of the whole colloid monolayer, our main\nprediction is the existence of additional smaller \"subharmonic\" steps due to\nlocalized solitonic regions of incommensurate layers executing synchronized\nslips, while the majority of the colloids remains pinned to a potential\nminimum. The current availability and wide parameter tunability of colloid\nmonolayers makes these predictions potentially easy to access in an\nexperimentally rich 2D geometrical configuration.\n"]}]

Strongly enhanced electric fields trigger electron field\nemission and atom evaporation from the apexes of the nanotips. Combined\ntogether, these processes may explain electric discharges in form of small\nlocal arcs observed near metal surfaces in the presence of electric fields even\nin ultra high vacuum conditions. In the present work we investigate the\nstability of nanoscale tips by means of computer simulations of surface\ndiffusion processes on copper (Cu), the main material of high voltage\nelectronics. We study the stability and life-time of thin Cu surface nanotips\nat different temperatures in terms of diffusion processes. For this purpose, we\nhave developed a surface Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model where the jump\nprocesses are described by tabulated precalculated energy barriers. We show\nthat tall surface features with high aspect ratios can be fairly stable at room\ntemperature. However, the stability was found to depend strongly on the\ntemperature: 13 nm nanotips with the major axes in the <110> crystallographic\ndirections were found to flatten down to half of the original height in less\nthan 100 ns at temperatures close to the melting point, whereas no significant\nchange in the height of these nanotips was observed after 10 $\\mu$s at room\ntemperature. Moreover, the nanotips built up along the <110> crystallographic\ndirections were found significantly more stable than those oriented in the\n<100> or <111> crystallographic directions. The proposed KMC model has been\nfound well suited for simulating atomic surfaces processes and was validated\nagainst Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation results via the comparison of the\nflattening times obtained by both methods.

A\nmeasurement of the elastic and inelastic signal will allow a single experiment\nto distinguish between a spin-independent and spin-dependent interaction. For\nthe first time, we characterise the inelastic signal for two-phase xenon\ndetectors in which dark matter inelastically scatters off the Xe-129 or Xe-131\nisotope.

However, previous methods usually\neither used the GO hierarchy to refine the prediction results of multiple\nclassifiers, or flattened the hierarchy into a function-function similarity\nkernel.

In addition to the\nlow-spin state and high-spin state phases, two kinds of the excitonic\ninsulating phases emerge as a consequence of the competition between the\ncrystalline field effect and the Hund coupling. The excitonic transition is\nclassified to be an Ising-like transition reflecting a spontaneous breaking of\nthe $Z_2$ symmetry. Magnetic structures in the two excitonic insulating phases\nare different from each other; an antiferromagnetic order and a spin nematic\norder. Collective excitations in each phase are examined by using the\ngeneralized spin-wave method. The Goldstone modes in the excitonic insulating\nphases appear in the dynamical correlation functions for the spins and\npseudo-spin operators. Both the transverse and longitudinal spin excitation\nmodes are active in the two excitonic insulating phases in contrast to the\nlow-spin state and high-spin state phases. Connections of the present results\nto the perovskite cobalt oxides are discussed.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 9 figures"]}]

The neural network represents uncertainty using Probabilistic\nPopulation Codes (PPCs), which are distributed neural representations that\nnaturally encode probability distributions, and support marginalization and\nevidence integration in a biologically-plausible manner. By connecting multiple\nPPCs together as a probabilistic graphical model, we represent multivariate\nprobability distributions. Approximate inference in graphical models can be\naccomplished by message-passing algorithms that disseminate local information\nthroughout the graph.

Unfortunately, a subtle feature of LBP\nrenders it neurally implausible. However, LBP can be elegantly reformulated as\na sequence of Tree-based Reparameterizations (TRP) of the graphical model.

In this paper, we release the above assumptions and take the CSI\nuncertainty and the spatial and temporal selectivities into account. We derive\nthe channel estimation error-aware maximum likelihood (CEEA-ML) detectors as\nwell as several low-complexity suboptimal alternatives for PSK and QAM signals.\nAs the CSI uncertainty depends on the channel estimator used, we consider two\npractical estimators in our derivations.\n  Numerical results obtained by simulations show that the CEEA-ML detectors\noffer clear per- formance gain against conventional mismatched SM detector and,\nmore importantly, the proposed suboptimal detectors incur negligible\nperformance loss.\n","Comment: 31 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables, submitted to IEEE Trans.

When comparing high power\nperformance of piezoelectric materials of varying compositions and vibration\nmodes, there exists an inherent problem in comparing the mechanical quality\nfactor directly. Typically the behavior of the mechanical quality factor is\nreported as a function of tip vibration velocity of the sample. This paper\nshows why this approach can be inherently problematic and proposes an energy\napproach to characterize the mechanical quality factor as the solution. By\nutilizing mechanical energy density ($u_{e}$), the mass density of the material\nsystem ($\\rho$), and the vibration mode shape (e.g. $k_{31}$ and $k_{p}$) of\nthe sample are accounted for. Therefore, a better method to compare high power\nperformance of varying piezoelectric compositions is introduced. Furthermore,\nthe new method is applied to various compositions by using data available in\nthe literature. As a result, the high power behavior of the materials appear to\nbe significantly different when the new \"energy density approach\" is used to\ncompare the mechanical quality factor rather than vibration velocity.

Within the framework of molecular geometrical\nsymmetry, we find a possibility that the Z = 12, N = 12 system would form an\noctahedral structure consisting of six points of alpha(4He) particles, yielding\nthe ground collectivity. With this point of view, we draw the following serial\nmolecular structures; the Z = 10, N = 10, 20Ne, corresponds to a hexahedral,\nthe Z = 8, N = 8, 16O, does to a tetrahedral, and the Z = 6, N = 6, 12C, does\nto a trigonal symmetry. Moreover, the Z = 2, N = 2, 4He(alpha), fits into a\ntetrahedral symmetry with four points of nucleons; two protons and two\nneutrons. The enhanced deformation at Z = 12 with N > 20 would be explained by\na deformed shape related to an Ethene(Ethylene)-like skeleton with six alpha\nparticles. The deformation at Z = 10, with N = 10 and 12, can be interpreted as\nbeing attributed to a hexahedral shape combined by five alpha particles as\nwell. By noticing that the Z = 4, N = 4 system is unstable to the ground state\nunder two-body system with two alpha particles, we conclude that alpha\nparticles, rather than the eight-protons-neutrons nucleon, govern the 8Be\nstability. Accordingly, the alpha particle should be a third nucleon, like a\nproton or a neutron, in a nucleus. We name it the 'Alpharon'.

It is assumed\nthat the transmitters have access to synergistic alternating channel state\ninformation (CSI). Specifically, the CSIT alternates between three states,\nnamely, perfect, delayed and no-CSIT, in a certain manner to enable these\nstates to work together cooperatively. These states are associated with\nfractions of time denoted by $\\lambda_P$, $\\lambda_D$ \\text{and} $\\lambda_N$,\nrespectively. For the two-user $X$-channel, simple upper bound is developed to\nprove the tightness of the achievability result of $4/3$ DoF under a certain\ndistribution of the availability of three CSIT states for\n$\\Lambda(\\lambda_P=1/3, \\lambda_D= 1/3, \\lambda_N=1/3)$.

In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm that, despite using the\nsame amount of communication per iteration as DGD, can effectively harnesses\nthe function smoothness and converge to the optimum with a rate of\n$O(\\frac{1}{t})$. If the objective function is further strongly convex, our\nalgorithm has a linear convergence rate. Both rates match the convergence rate\nof CGD except for constants. The key step in our algorithm is a novel gradient\nestimation scheme that uses history information to achieve fast and accurate\nestimation of the average gradient. To motivate the necessity of history\ninformation, we also show that it is impossible for a class of distributed\nalgorithms like DGD to achieve a linear convergence rate without using history\ninformation even if the objective function is strongly convex and smooth.\n"]}]

A typical example is\ncloning; making a copy of digital information is straightforward but it is not\npossible exactly for quantum information. The question in this paper is whether\nor not quantum network coding is possible. Its classical counterpart is another\ngood example to show that digital information flow can be done much more\nefficiently than conventional (say, liquid) flow.\n  Our answer to the question is similar to the case of cloning, namely, it is\nshown that quantum network coding is possible if approximation is allowed, by\nusing a simple network model called Butterfly. In this network, there are two\nflow paths, s_1 to t_1 and s_2 to t_2, which shares a single bottleneck channel\nof capacity one. In the classical case, we can send two bits simultaneously,\none for each path, in spite of the bottleneck. Our results for quantum network\ncoding include: (i) We can send any quantum state |psi_1> from s_1 to t_1 and\n|psi_2> from s_2 to t_2 simultaneously with a fidelity strictly greater than\n1/2. (ii) If one of |psi_1> and |psi_2> is classical, then the fidelity can be\nimproved to 2/3. (iii) Similar improvement is also possible if |psi_1> and\n|psi_2> are restricted to only a finite number of (previously known) states.\n(iv) Several impossibility results including the general upper bound of the\nfidelity are also given.\n","Comment: 27pages, 11figures.
