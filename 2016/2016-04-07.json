In integrable potentials---where all orbits are regular---tidal\ndebris phase-mixes close to the orbit of the progenitor system. However, the\nMilky Way's dark matter halo is expected not to be fully integrable; an\nappreciable fraction of orbits will be chaotic. This paper examines the\ninfluence of chaos on the phase-space morphology of cold tidal streams. Streams\neven in weakly chaotic regions look very different from those in regular\nregions. We find that streams can be sensitive to chaos on a much shorter\ntime-scale than any standard prediction (from the Lyapunov or\nfrequency-diffusion times). For example, on a weakly chaotic orbit with a\nchaotic timescale predicted to be $>$1000 orbital periods ($>$1000 Gyr), the\nresulting stellar stream is, after just a few 10's of orbits, substantially\nmore diffuse than any formed on a nearby but regular orbit. We find that the\nenhanced diffusion of the stream stars can be understood by looking at the\nvariance in orbital frequencies of orbit ensembles centered around the parent\n(progenitor) orbit. Our results suggest that long, cold streams around our\nGalaxy must exist only on regular (or very nearly regular) orbits; they\npotentially provide a map of the regular regions of the Milky Way potential.\nThis suggests a promising new direction for the use of tidal streams to\nconstrain the distribution of dark matter around our Galaxy.\n","Comment: 46 pages, 14 figures, publshed in MNRAS"]}]

The idea of recoverable robustness requires that a\nsolution can be recovered to a feasible one as soon as the realized scenario\nbecomes known. The usual approach in the literature is to minimize the\nobjective function value of the recovered solution in the nominal or in the\nworst case.\n  As the recovery itself is also costly, there is a trade-off between the\nrecovery costs and the solution value obtained; we study both, the recovery\ncosts and the solution value in the worst case in a biobjective setting.\n  To this end, we assume that the recovery costs can be described by a metric.\nWe demonstrate that this leads to a location planning problem, bringing\ntogether two fields of research which have been considered separate so far.\n  We show how weakly Pareto efficient solutions to this biobjective problem can\nbe computed by minimizing the recovery costs for a fixed worst-case objective\nfunction value and present approaches for the case of linear and quasiconvex\nproblems for finite uncertainty sets.

Several constraints limit the practical\nperformance of DNs in this context: firstly, the paucity of existing pixel-wise\nlabelled training data, and secondly, the memory constraints of embedded\nhardware, which rule out the practical use of state-of-the-art DN architectures\nsuch as fully convolutional networks (FCN). To address the first constraint, we\nintroduce a Multi-Domain Road Scene Semantic Segmentation (MDRS3) dataset,\naggregating data from six existing densely and sparsely labelled datasets for\ntraining our models, and two existing, separate datasets for testing their\ngeneralisation performance. We show that, while MDRS3 offers a greater volume\nand variety of data, end-to-end training of a memory efficient DN does not\nyield satisfactory performance. We propose a new training strategy to overcome\nthis, based on (i) the creation of a best-possible source network (S-Net) from\nthe aggregated data, ignoring time and memory constraints; and (ii) the\ntransfer of knowledge from S-Net to the memory-efficient target network\n(T-Net). We evaluate different techniques for S-Net creation and T-Net\ntransferral, and demonstrate that training a constrained deconvolutional\nnetwork in this manner can unlock better performance than existing training\napproaches. Specifically, we show that a target network can be trained to\nachieve improved accuracy versus an FCN despite using less than 1\\% of the\nmemory.

The state-of-the-art approaches to securely\ndelegating quantum computation, without exception, rely on granting the client\nmodest quantum powers, or on additional, non-communicating, quantum servers.

Very lately, a new type of Weyl semimetals has been\nproposed where the Weyl Fermions emerge at the boundary between electron and\nhole pockets in a new phase of matter, which is distinct from the standard type\nI Weyl semimetals with a point-like Fermi surface. The Weyl cone in this type\nII semimetals is strongly tilted and the related Fermi surface undergos a\nLifshitz transition, giving rise to a new kind of chiral anomaly and other new\nphysics. MoTe2 is proposed to be a candidate of a type II Weyl semimetal; the\nsensitivity of its topological state to lattice constants and correlation also\nmakes it an ideal platform to explore possible topological phase transitions.\nBy performing laser-based angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) measurements\nwith unprecedentedly high resolution, we have uncovered electronic evidence of\ntype II semimetal state in MoTe2. We have established a full picture of the\nbulk electronic states and surface state for MoTe2 that are consistent with the\nband structure calculations. A single branch of surface state is identified\nthat connects bulk hole pockets and bulk electron pockets. Detailed\ntemperature-dependent ARPES measurements show high intensity spot-like features\nthat is ~40 meV above the Fermi level and is close to the momentum space\nconsistent with the theoretical expectation of the type II Weyl points. Our\nresults constitute electronic evidence on the nature of the Weyl semimetal\nstate that favors the presence of two sets of type II Weyl points in MoTe2.\n","Comment: 15 Pages, 4 Figures"]}]

For a finite sample\nestimate of the precision matrix, entries close to zero may be due to low\nsample effects, or due to an actual association between variables; these two\ncases are not readily distinguishable. %Fisher provided a hypothesis test based\non a parametric approximation to the distribution of an entry in the precision\nmatrix of a Gaussian distribution, but this may not provide valid upper bounds\non $p$-values for non-Gaussian distributions.
