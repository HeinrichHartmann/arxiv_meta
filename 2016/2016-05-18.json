Chamaeleon II molecular cloud is an active star forming region that\noffers an excellent opportunity for studying the formation of brown dwarfs in\nthe southern hemisphere. Aims. Our aims are to identify a population of pre-\nand proto- brown dwarfs (5 sigma mass limit threshold of ~0.015 Msun) and\nprovide information on the formation mechanisms of substellar objects. Methods.\nWe performed high sensitivity observations at 870 microns using the LABOCA\nbolometer at the APEX telescope towards an active star forming region in\nChamaeleon II. The data are complemented with an extensive multiwavelength\ncatalogue of sources from the optical to the far-infrared to study the nature\nof the LABOCA detections. Results. We detect fifteen cores at 870 microns, and\neleven of them show masses in the substellar regime. The most intense objects\nin the surveyed field correspond to the submillimeter counterparts of the well\nknown young stellar objects DK Cha and IRAS 12500-7658. We identify a possible\nproto-brown dwarf candidate (ChaII-APEX-L) with IRAC emission at 3.6 and 4.5\nmicrons. Conclusions. Our analysis indicates that most of the spatially\nresolved cores are transient, and that the point-like starless cores in the\nsub-stellar regime (with masses between 0.016 Msun and 0.066 Msun) could be\npre-brown dwarfs cores gravitationally unstable if they have radii smaller than\n220 AU to 907 AU (1.2\" to 5\" at 178 pc) respectively for different masses.

Sometimes the system needs to be modeled as a random\nwalker in high dimensions (like in protein folding/unfolding) where dimensions\ncould be the distances between different amino acid residues (as in unfolding\nof HP-36). Nevertheless, most of the theoretical studies of these phenomena\nstill employ a one dimensional description. This is despite the prediction that\nin a rough (or, rugged) energy landscape (REL), diffusion in one dimension (1d)\nis predicted to be pathologically different from any higher dimension with the\nincreased chance of encountering broken ergodicity (Stein and Newman, 2012). We\nexplore the dimensionality dependent diffusion on REL by carrying out an\neffective medium approximation based analytical calculations and compare them\nwith the available computer simulation results. We find that at intermediate\nlevel of ruggedness (assumed to have a Gaussian distribution), where diffusion\nis well-defined, the value of the effective diffusion coefficient depends on\ndimensionality and changes (increases) by several factors (~5-10) in going from\n1d to 2d. In contrast, the changes in subsequent transitions (like 2d to 3d and\n3d to 4d and so on) are far more modest, of the order of 10-20% only.

In this paper, we cross-correlate\nCFHTLenS galaxy density maps with CFHTLenS shear maps and Planck CMB lensing\nmaps to calibrate an additional multiplicative shear bias (m) in CFHTLenS\n(beyond the multiplicative correction that has already been applied to the\nCFHTLenS galaxy shears), following methods suggested by Vallinotto (2012) and\nDas et al.

However, unlike other dust sources, the dust has to survive\nthe passage of the reverse shock, generated by the interaction of the supernova\nblast wave with its surrounding medium. Knowledge of the net amount of dust\nproduced by CCSNe is crucial for understanding the origin and evolution of dust\nin the local and high-redshift universe. Our aim is to identify the dust\ndestruction mechanisms in the ejecta, and derive the net amount of dust that\nsurvives the passage of the reverse shock. We use analytical models for the\nevolution of a supernova blast wave and of the reverse shock, with special\napplication to the clumpy ejecta of the remnant of Cassiopeia A. We assume that\nthe dust resides in cool oxygen-rich clumps that are uniformly distributed\nwithin the remnant and surrounded by a hot X-ray emitting plasma, and that the\ndust consists of silicates (MgSiO3) and amorphous carbon grains. The passage of\nthe reverse shock through the clumps gives rise to a relative gas-grain motion\nand also destroys the clumps. Inside the ejecta clouds, dust is processed via\nkinetic sputtering, which is terminated either when the grains escape the\nclumps, or when the clumps are destroyed by the reverse shock. In either case,\ngrain destruction proceeds thereafter by thermal sputtering in the hot ambient\ngas. We find that 11.8% and 15.9% of, respectively, the silicate and carbon\ndust survives the passage of the reverse shock by the time the shock has\nreached the center of the remnant. These fractions depend on the morphology of\nthe ejecta and the medium into which the remnant is expanding, as well as the\ncomposition and size distribution of the grains that formed in the ejecta.\nResults will therefore differ for different types of supernovae.\n","Comment: A&A, in press, 20 pages (including two appendices), 15+1 figures, one\n  additional reference in the Introduction, two paragraphs added to the\n  Discussion section"]}]

After an oxidative treatment, cooperative\nmagnetism similar to the bulk is restored. The oxidized pellets of restacked\nsingle layers feature a magnetic transition at T$_N$ = 7 K in the in-plane\ndirection, while the magnetic properties in the out-of-plane direction vastly\ndiffer from bulk $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. The macroscopic pellets of RuCl$_3$\ntherefore behave like a stack of monolayers without any symmetry relation in\nthe stacking direction. The deliberate introduction of turbostratic disorder to\nmanipulate the spin structure of RuCl$_3$ is of interest for research in\nfrustrated magnetism and complex magnetic order as predicted by the\nKitaev-Heisenberg model.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 5 figures, supporting information added with 11 pages and\n  11 figures"]}]

The signal\nimprinted on the cross-correlation function (CCF) by a planet transiting its\nstar is dependent on the planet-to-star radius ratio. We want to verify if the\nprecision reachable on the CCF obtained from a subset of the spectral orders of\nthe HARPS spectrograph is enough to discriminate the radius of a planet at\ndifferent wavelengths. Methods. We analyze HARPS archival data of three\ntransits of HD 189733b. We divide the HARPS spectral range in 7 broadbands,\ncalculating for each band the ratio between the area of the out-of-transit CCF\nand the area of the signal imprinted by the planet on it during the full part\nof the transit. We take into account the effect of the limb darkening using the\ntheoretical coefficients of a linear law. Averaging the results of three\ndifferent transits allows us to obtain a good quality broadband transmission\nspectrum of HD 189733b, with a precision greater than that of the chromatic RM\neffect. Results. We proved chromatic line-profile tomography to be an\ninteresting way to reveal broadband transmission spectra of exoplanets: our\nanalysis of the atmosphere of HD 189733b is in agreement with other ground- and\nspace-based observations. The independent analysis of different transits puts\nin evidence the probability that stellar activity plays a role in the extracted\ntransmission spectrum. Care has thus to be taken when claiming for Rayleigh\nscattering in the atmosphere of exoplanets orbiting active stars using only one\ntransit.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 5 figures.

In stars with accretion disks, the\nstellar magnetic field can truncate the inner disk and determine the paths that\nmatter can take to flow onto the star. These paths are different in stars with\ndifferent magnetospheres and periods of rotation. External field lines of the\nmagnetosphere may inflate and produce favorable conditions for outflows from\nthe disk-magnetosphere boundary. Outflows can be particularly strong in the\npropeller regime, wherein a star rotates more rapidly than the inner disk.\nOutflows may also form at the disk-magnetosphere boundary of slowly rotating\nstars, if the magnetosphere is compressed by the accreting matter. In isolated,\nstrongly magnetized stars, the magnetic field can influence formation and/or\npropagation of stellar wind outflows. Winds from low-mass, solar-type stars may\nbe either thermally or magnetically driven, while winds from massive, luminous\nO and B type stars are radiatively driven. In all of these cases, the magnetic\nfield influences matter flow from the stars and determines many observational\nproperties.

Surface-based self-assembly is particularly amenable to modeling and\nmeasuring these interactions in well-defined systems. This study focuses on\n2-butanol, the simplest aliphatic chiral alcohol. 2-butanol shows interesting\nproperties as a chiral modifier of surface chemistry, however, its mode of\naction is not fully understood. In order to probe its surface properties we\nemployed high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and DFT simulations. We\nfound a surprisingly rich degree of enantiospecific adsorption, association,\nchiral cluster growth and ultimately long range, highly ordered chiral\ntemplating. Firstly, the chiral molecules acquire a second chiral center when\nadsorbed to the surface via dative bonding of one of the oxygen atom lone\npairs. This interaction is controlled via the molecule's intrinsic chiral\ncenter leading to monomers of like chirality, at both chiral centers, adsorbed\non the surface. The monomers then associate into tetramers via a cyclical\nnetwork of hydrogen bonds with an opposite chirality at the oxygen atom. The\nevolution of these square units is surprising given that the underlying surface\nhas a hexagonal symmetry. Our DFT calculations reveal that the tetramers are\nable to associate with each other by weaker van der Waals interactions and\ntessellate in an extended square network. Our data reveals that the chirality\nof a simple alcohol can be transferred to its surface binding geometry, drive\nthe directionality of hydrogen bonds and ultimately extended structure.\nFurthermore, this study provides the first microscopic insight into the surface\nproperties of this important chiral modifier and provides a well-defined system\nfor studying the network's enantioselective interaction with other molecules.\n"]}]
