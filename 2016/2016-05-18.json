Chamaeleon II molecular cloud is an active star forming region that\noffers an excellent opportunity for studying the formation of brown dwarfs in\nthe southern hemisphere. Aims. Our aims are to identify a population of pre-\nand proto- brown dwarfs (5 sigma mass limit threshold of ~0.015 Msun) and\nprovide information on the formation mechanisms of substellar objects. Methods.\nWe performed high sensitivity observations at 870 microns using the LABOCA\nbolometer at the APEX telescope towards an active star forming region in\nChamaeleon II. The data are complemented with an extensive multiwavelength\ncatalogue of sources from the optical to the far-infrared to study the nature\nof the LABOCA detections. Results. We detect fifteen cores at 870 microns, and\neleven of them show masses in the substellar regime. The most intense objects\nin the surveyed field correspond to the submillimeter counterparts of the well\nknown young stellar objects DK Cha and IRAS 12500-7658. We identify a possible\nproto-brown dwarf candidate (ChaII-APEX-L) with IRAC emission at 3.6 and 4.5\nmicrons. Conclusions. Our analysis indicates that most of the spatially\nresolved cores are transient, and that the point-like starless cores in the\nsub-stellar regime (with masses between 0.016 Msun and 0.066 Msun) could be\npre-brown dwarfs cores gravitationally unstable if they have radii smaller than\n220 AU to 907 AU (1.2\" to 5\" at 178 pc) respectively for different masses.

Sometimes the system needs to be modeled as a random\nwalker in high dimensions (like in protein folding/unfolding) where dimensions\ncould be the distances between different amino acid residues (as in unfolding\nof HP-36). Nevertheless, most of the theoretical studies of these phenomena\nstill employ a one dimensional description. This is despite the prediction that\nin a rough (or, rugged) energy landscape (REL), diffusion in one dimension (1d)\nis predicted to be pathologically different from any higher dimension with the\nincreased chance of encountering broken ergodicity (Stein and Newman, 2012). We\nexplore the dimensionality dependent diffusion on REL by carrying out an\neffective medium approximation based analytical calculations and compare them\nwith the available computer simulation results. We find that at intermediate\nlevel of ruggedness (assumed to have a Gaussian distribution), where diffusion\nis well-defined, the value of the effective diffusion coefficient depends on\ndimensionality and changes (increases) by several factors (~5-10) in going from\n1d to 2d.

Similarly, a direct\ncross-correlation of the CFHTLenS data with Planck CMB lensing data yielded an\nanomalously low amplitude compared to expectations based on Planck or\nWMAP-derived cosmological parameters (Liu & Hill 2015). One potential\nexplanation for these results is a multiplicative bias afflicting the CFHTLenS\ngalaxy shape measurements, from which shears are inferred.

In this paper, we cross-correlate\nCFHTLenS galaxy density maps with CFHTLenS shear maps and Planck CMB lensing\nmaps to calibrate an additional multiplicative shear bias (m) in CFHTLenS\n(beyond the multiplicative correction that has already been applied to the\nCFHTLenS galaxy shears), following methods suggested by Vallinotto (2012) and\nDas et al.

We consider three galaxy bias models,\nfinding in all cases that the best-fit multiplicative shear bias is less than\nunity.

This approach has several advantages. The update is entirely\nindependent from the original preconditioner, so it can be applied to any\npreconditioner. The possibly high cost of an initial preconditioner can be\namortized over many linear solves.

In other materials,\nmost importantly iron based systems with only hole or only electron pockets,\nthe microscopic origin is hotly debated.

In stars with accretion disks, the\nstellar magnetic field can truncate the inner disk and determine the paths that\nmatter can take to flow onto the star. These paths are different in stars with\ndifferent magnetospheres and periods of rotation. External field lines of the\nmagnetosphere may inflate and produce favorable conditions for outflows from\nthe disk-magnetosphere boundary. Outflows can be particularly strong in the\npropeller regime, wherein a star rotates more rapidly than the inner disk.\nOutflows may also form at the disk-magnetosphere boundary of slowly rotating\nstars, if the magnetosphere is compressed by the accreting matter. In isolated,\nstrongly magnetized stars, the magnetic field can influence formation and/or\npropagation of stellar wind outflows. Winds from low-mass, solar-type stars may\nbe either thermally or magnetically driven, while winds from massive, luminous\nO and B type stars are radiatively driven. In all of these cases, the magnetic\nfield influences matter flow from the stars and determines many observational\nproperties. In this chapter we review recent studies of accretion, outflows,\nand winds of magnetized stars with a focus on three main topics: (1) accretion\nonto magnetized stars; (2) outflows from the disk-magnetosphere boundary; and\n(3) winds from isolated massive magnetized stars. We show results obtained from\nglobal magnetohydrodynamic simulations and, in a number of cases compare global\nsimulations with observations.\n","Comment: 60 pages, 44 figures"]}]

We explore two special polynomial\ndecomposition algorithms that are useful for integrating polynomial functions.\nBoth polynomial decompositions have strengths and weaknesses, and we experiment\nwith how to practically use them.\n  After developing practical algorithms and efficient software tools for\nintegrating a polynomial over a polytope, we focus on the problem of maximizing\na polynomial function over the continuous domain of a polytope.

Surface-based self-assembly is particularly amenable to modeling and\nmeasuring these interactions in well-defined systems. This study focuses on\n2-butanol, the simplest aliphatic chiral alcohol. 2-butanol shows interesting\nproperties as a chiral modifier of surface chemistry, however, its mode of\naction is not fully understood. In order to probe its surface properties we\nemployed high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and DFT simulations. We\nfound a surprisingly rich degree of enantiospecific adsorption, association,\nchiral cluster growth and ultimately long range, highly ordered chiral\ntemplating. Firstly, the chiral molecules acquire a second chiral center when\nadsorbed to the surface via dative bonding of one of the oxygen atom lone\npairs. This interaction is controlled via the molecule's intrinsic chiral\ncenter leading to monomers of like chirality, at both chiral centers, adsorbed\non the surface. The monomers then associate into tetramers via a cyclical\nnetwork of hydrogen bonds with an opposite chirality at the oxygen atom. The\nevolution of these square units is surprising given that the underlying surface\nhas a hexagonal symmetry. Our DFT calculations reveal that the tetramers are\nable to associate with each other by weaker van der Waals interactions and\ntessellate in an extended square network. Our data reveals that the chirality\nof a simple alcohol can be transferred to its surface binding geometry, drive\nthe directionality of hydrogen bonds and ultimately extended structure.\nFurthermore, this study provides the first microscopic insight into the surface\nproperties of this important chiral modifier and provides a well-defined system\nfor studying the network's enantioselective interaction with other molecules.\n"]}]
