At any given\ntime $t$, a SMC method produces a set of samples over the state space of the\nsystem of interest (often termed \"particles\") that is used to build a discrete\nand random approximation of the posterior probability distribution of the state\nvariables, conditional on a sequence of available observations. One potential\napplication of the methodology is the estimation of the densities associated to\nthe sequence of a posteriori distributions. While practitioners have rather\nfreely applied such density approximations in the past, the issue has received\nless attention from a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we address the\nproblem of constructing kernel-based estimates of the posterior probability\ndensity function and its derivatives, and obtain asymptotic convergence results\nfor the estimation errors.

For our local search procedure\nto terminate in polynomial time, we introduce several new ideas such as lazy\nupdates and greedy players. Besides the improved approximation guarantee, the\nhighlight of our approach is that it is purely combinatorial and uses the\nConfiguration-LP only in the analysis.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 3 figures; revised version with expanded algorithm\n  intuition"]}]

Here we analyze more than one\nbillion chat messages from Twitch, a social game-streaming platform, to study\nhow the gender of streamers is associated with the nature of conversation.\nUsing a combination of computational text analysis methods, we show that\ngendered conversation and objectification is prevalent in chats.

The method is generically\napplicable to relatively smooth, one-dimensional datasets and uses a greedy\nalgorithm to determine the most relevant subset of the full data such that a\nspline interpolant of a specified polynomial degree will represent the original\ndata to within a requested point-wise tolerance. We find significant\ncompression of the original NR data sets presented here. These compressed data\nsets can then be evaluated fast and efficiently and resampled as desired.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 13 figures"]}]

This paper complements the original analyses of\nGW150914 with an investigation of the effects of possible systematic errors in\nthe waveform models on estimates of its source parameters. To test for\nsystematic errors we repeat the original Bayesian analyses on mock signals from\nnumerical simulations of a series of binary configurations with parameters\nsimilar to those found for GW150914. Overall, we find no evidence for a\nsystematic bias relative to the statistical error of the original parameter\nrecovery of GW150914 due to modeling approximations or modeling inaccuracies.\nHowever, parameter biases are found to occur for some configurations disfavored\nby the data of GW150914: for binaries inclined edge-on to the detector over a\nsmall range of choices of polarization angles, and also for eccentricities\ngreater than $\\sim$0.05.

A positive or negative\nvalue means that it arrives by this much earlier or later than the reference.\nBecause $T_{RR}$ is an analysis of return times after shocks, it is a\nsystematic approach to the concept of critical slowing down [1]; hence it is\nnaturally an early-warning signal [2] for bifurcations when central statistics\nover distributions of initial conditions are used.\n  AUDIC is the distance of the trajectory to the attractor integrated over\ntime. Complementary to $T_{RR}$, it measures which trajectories are reluctant,\ni.e. stay away from the attractor for long, or eager to approach it right away.\n  (... shortened for arxiv listing, full abstract in paper ...) New features in\nthese models can be uncovered, including the surprising regularity of the\nRoessler system's basin of attraction even in the regime of a chaotic\nattractor.

The weakly nonlinear evolution is governed by a Kuramoto-Sivashinsky\nequation with a non-local term due to the electric field effect. The electric\nfield term is linearly destabilising and produces growth rates proportional to\nthe cube of the size of the wavenumber vector of the perturbations. It is found\nthat transverse gravitational instabilities are always present for hanging\nfilms and lead to unboundedness of solutions even in the absence of electric\nfields.

Upon formulating sparse PR as an\namplitude-based nonconvex optimization task, SPARTA works iteratively in two\nstages: In stage one, the support of the underlying sparse signal is recovered\nusing an analytically well-justified rule, and subsequently a sparse\northogonality-promoting initialization is obtained via power iterations\nrestricted on the support; and, in stage two, the initialization is\nsuccessively refined by means of hard thresholding based truncated gradient\niterations.

We formulate this as a problem of learning a decision list\n-- a sequence of if-then-else rules -- which maps characteristics of subjects\n(eg., diagnostic test results of patients) to treatments. We propose a novel\nobjective to construct a decision list which maximizes outcomes for the\npopulation, and minimizes overall costs. We model the problem of learning such\na list as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employ a variant of the Upper\nConfidence Bound for Trees (UCT) strategy which leverages customized checks for\npruning the search space effectively. Experimental results on real world\nobservational data capturing treatment recommendations for asthma patients\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.\n","Comment: Presented at NIPS 2016 Workshop on Interpretable Machine Learning in\n  Complex Systems"]}]

Furthermore, this feature vector evolves during the\nmovement performance so that a complete movement is fully represented by a\nmatrix M of size DxT , whose element M i, j represents the value of feature i\nat timestamps j. Many studies have addressed dimensionality reduction\nconsidering only the size of the feature vector lying in R D to reduce both the\nvariability of gestural sequences expressed in the reduced space, and the\ncomputational complexity of their processing. In return, very few of these\nmethods have explicitly addressed the dimensionality reduction along the time\naxis.

We\npresent in this paper an evaluation of straightforward approaches aiming at\nreducing the dimensionality of the matrix M for each movement, leading to\nconsider both the dimensionality reduction of the feature vector as well as its\nreduction along the time axis. The dimensionality reduction of the feature\nvector is achieved by selecting remarkable joints in the skeleton performing\nthe movement, basically the extremities of the articulatory chains composing\nthe skeleton. The temporal dimen-sionality reduction is achieved using either a\nregular or adaptive down-sampling that seeks to minimize the reconstruction\nerror of the movements.

However, there is always a need for approaches that offer compact\nmemory utilisation without substantial degradation of lookup performance.\nCuckoo hashing is an efficient technique of creating hash tables with high\nspace utilisation and offer a guaranteed constant access time. We are given $n$\nlocations and $m$ items. Each item has to be placed in one of the $k\\ge2$\nlocations chosen by $k$ random hash functions. By allowing more than one choice\nfor a single item, cuckoo hashing resembles multiple choice allocations\nschemes.

We propose and analyse an insertion algorithm for\ncuckoo hashing that runs in \\emph{linear time} with high probability and in\nexpectation. Previous work on total allocation time has analysed breadth first\nsearch, and it was shown to be linear only in \\emph{expectation}. Our algorithm\nfinds an assignment (with probability 1) whenever it exists. In contrast, the\nother known insertion method, known as \\emph{random walk insertion}, may run\nindefinitely even for a solvable instance. We also present experimental results\ncomparing the performance of our algorithm with the random walk method, also\nfor the case when each location can hold more than one item.\n  As a corollary we obtain a linear time algorithm (with high probability and\nin expectation) for finding perfect matchings in a special class of sparse\nrandom bipartite graphs.

The\nproposed approach allows us to train a ConvNet that outperforms all\nstate-of-the-art approaches on standard benchmarks achieving relative error\nreduction greater than 35% on average.

In this context, the\nchoice of the neutrino mass ordering is modeled via the discrete hyperparameter\n$h_{type}$. The preference for either the NH or the IH scenarios is then\nencoded in the posterior distribution of $h_{type}$ itself. Current CMB\nmeasurements assign equal odds to the two hierarchies, and are thus unable to\ndistinguish between them. However, after the addition of BAO measurements, a\nweak preference for NH appears, with odds of 4:3 from Planck temperature and\nlarge-scale polarization in combination with BAO (3:2 if small-scale\npolarization is also included). Forecasts suggest that the combination of\nupcoming CMB (COrE) and BAO surveys (DESI) may determine the neutrino mass\nhierarchy at a high statistical significance if the mass is very close to the\nminimal value allowed by oscillations, as for NH and $M_\\nu=0.06$ eV there is a\n9:1 preference of NH vs IH. On the contrary, if $M_\\nu$ is of the order of 0.1\neV or larger, even future cosmological observations will be inconclusive. The\nunbiased limit on $M_\\nu$ we obtain with this innovative statistical strategy\nis crucial for ongoing and planned neutrinoless double beta decay searches.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables.

Our analysis indicates that\nthe SDSS main galaxy sample is homogeneous on a length scales of $80\\, h^{-1}\\,\n{\\rm Mpc} $ and beyond whereas the SDSS quasar sample and the SDSS LRG sample\nshow transition to homogeneity on an even larger length scales at $\\sim 150\\,\nh^{-1}\\, {\\rm Mpc}$ and $\\sim 230\\, h^{-1}\\, {\\rm Mpc}$ respectively.
