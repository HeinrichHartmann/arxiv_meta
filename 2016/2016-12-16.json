To this\nend, we formulate the signal detection in C-RAN as an inference problem over a\nbipartite random geometric graph.

As a major contribution of this paper, we propose a\nrandomized Gaussian message passing (RGMP) algorithm to improve the\nconvergence. Instead of exchanging messages simultaneously or in a fixed order,\nwe propose to exchange messages asynchronously in a random order. The proposed\nRGMP algorithm demonstrates significantly better convergence performance than\nconventional message passing. The randomness of the message update schedule\nalso simplifies the analysis, and allows the derivation of the convergence\nconditions for the RGMP algorithm.

This task is complicated as it needs high-level\nsemantic understandings of both the scenes and motion patterns underlying video\nsequences. In practice, cluttered situations have also raised higher demands on\nthe effectiveness and robustness of the considered models. Motivated by these\nobservations, we propose a deep learning framework which simultaneously\nperforms deep feature learning for visual representation in conjunction with\nspatio-temporal context modeling. After that, we propose a unified path\nplanning scheme to make accurate future path prediction based on the analytic\nresults of the context models. The highly effective visual representation and\ndeep context models ensure that our framework makes a deep semantic\nunderstanding of the scene and motion pattern, consequently improving the\nperformance of the visual path prediction task. In order to comprehensively\nevaluate the model's performance on the visual path prediction task, we\nconstruct two large benchmark datasets from the adaptation of video tracking\ndatasets. The qualitative and quantitative experimental results show that our\napproach outperforms the existing approaches and owns a better generalization\ncapability.\n"]}]

We study the production of HJs through secular evolution in\nmultiplanet systems with three to five planets. In this variant of high-$e$\nmigration, the eccentricity of the orbit of the innermost planet is excited on\nsecular time-scales, triggering orbital migration due to tidal dissipation. We\nuse a secular dynamics code and carry out a population synthesis study. We find\nthat HJs are only produced if the viscous time-scale is short ($\\approx 0.014$\nyr). In contrast, in up to $\\approx 0.3$ of systems, the innermost planet is\ntidally disrupted. The orbital period distribution is peaked around 5 d,\nconsistent with observations.

The short coherence time of the\nelectronic quantum state that arises from coupling to the nuclei of the\nsubstrate is dramatically increased if the system is subjected to a magnetic\nfield and to repeated optical pulsing. This enhancement is due to mode locking:\nOscillation frequencies resonant with the pulsing frequencies are enhanced,\nwhile off-resonant oscillations eventually die out.

Recently, a\ndifferent theory was proposed: The boson peak was attributed to the first van\nHove singularity of crystal lattices which is only smeared out by the disorder.\nThis new viewpoint assumes that the van Hove singularity is simply shifted by\nthe decreased density of the amorphous state and is therefore not a\nglass-specific anomaly. In order to resolve this issue, we use computer models\nof a four-component alloy, alternatively with chemical disorder (high-entropy\nalloy), structural disorder, and reduced density.

In this context, the term global refers to the identification of a\nmodel that is capable of representing the system dynamics under any admissible\nflight state based on data recorded from sample states. The proposed framework\nis based on stochastic time-series models for representing the system dynamics\nand aeroelastic response under multiple flight states, with each state\ncharacterized by several variables, such as the airspeed and angle of attack,\nforming a flight state vector. The method's cornerstone lies in the new class\nof Vector-dependent Functionally Pooled (VFP) models which allow the explicit\nanalytical inclusion of the flight state vector into the model parameters and,\nhence, system dynamics. The experimental evaluation is based on a prototype\nbio-inspired self-sensing composite wing that is subjected to a series of wind\ntunnel experiments. Distributed micro-sensors in the form of stretchable sensor\nnetworks are embedded in the composite layup of the wing to provide the sensing\ncapabilities. Data collected from piezoelectric sensors are employed for the\nidentification of a stochastic global VFP model. The estimated VFP model\nparameters constitute two-dimensional functions of the flight state vector\ndefined by the airspeed and angle of attack. The identified model is able to\nsuccessfully represent the aeroelastic response of the wing under the\nadmissible flight states via a minimum number of estimated parameters compared\nto standard identification approaches. The obtained results demonstrate the\nhigh accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed global identification\nframework, thus constituting a first step towards the next generation of\nfly-by-feel aerospace vehicles with state awareness capabilities.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 21 figures"]}]

Typically this problem is confounded with the\nproblem of graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL), because both problems\nrepresent the data as a graph and predict the missing class labels of nodes.\nHowever, not all graphs are created equally. In GSSL a graph is constructed,\noften from independent data, based on similarity. As such, edges tend to\nconnect instances with the same class label. Relational networks, however, can\nbe more heterogeneous and edges do not always indicate similarity. For\ninstance, instead of links being more likely to connect nodes with the same\nclass label, they may occur more frequently between nodes with different class\nlabels (link-heterogeneity). Or nodes with the same class label do not\nnecessarily have the same type of connectivity across the whole network\n(class-heterogeneity), e.g. in a network of sexual interactions we may observe\nlinks between opposite genders in some parts of the graph and links between the\nsame genders in others.

The joint spectro-seismo project (APOKASC) of field\nred giants has revealed a puzzling offset between the log g determined\nspectroscopically and those determined using asteroseismology, which is largely\ndependent on the stellar evolutionary status. Therefore, in this letter, we aim\nto shed light on the spectroscopic source of the offset using the APOKASC\nsample.

Matter wave interferometers have used\nneutrons, atoms and molecular clusters as microscopic test particles, but\ninitially probed the field sourced by the entire earth. Later, the\ngravitational field arising from hundreds of kilograms of artificial source\nmasses was measured with atom interferometry. Miniaturizing the source mass and\nmoving it into the vacuum chamber could improve positioning accuracy, allow the\nuse of monocrystalline source masses for improved gravitational measurements,\nand test new physics, such as beyond-standard-model (\"fifth\") forces of nature\nand non-classical effects of gravity. In this work, we detect the gravitational\nforce between freely falling cesium atoms and an in-vacuum, centimeter-sized\nsource mass using atom interferometry with state-of-the-art sensitivity. The\nability to sense gravitational-strength coupling is conjectured to access a\nnatural lower bound for fundamental forces, thereby representing an important\nmilestone in searches for physics beyond the standard model. A local, in-vacuum\nsource mass is particularly sensitive to a wide class of interactions whose\neffects would otherwise be suppressed beyond detectability in regions of high\nmatter density. For example, our measurement strengthens limits on a number of\ncosmologically-motivated scalar field models, such as chameleon and symmetron\nfields, by over two orders of magnitude and paves the way toward novel\nmeasurements of Newton's gravitational constant G and the gravitational\nAharonov-Bohm effect\n"]}]
