This paper\nproposes to use transformation models, known as the generalized accelerated\nfailure time model in econometrics, for regression analysis with\nresponse-biased sampling. With unknown error distribution, the transformation\nmodels are broad enough to cover linear re- gression models, the Cox's model\nand the proportional odds model as special cases.

Unlike the inverse probability methods, the proposed\nmethod of estimation does not involve the sampling probabilities, which are\noften difficult to obtain in practice. Without the need of estimating the\nunknown trans- formation function or the error distribution, the proposed\nmethod is numerically easy to implement with the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm,\nwhich does not require convexity or continuity.

On the other hand, 3He technology\ncould still satisfy the detector requirements for large area applications\n(50m^2), however, because of the present 3He shortage that the world is\nexperiencing, this is not practical anymore. The recent detector advances (the\nMulti-Grid and the Multi-Blade prototypes) developed in the framework of the\ncollaboration between the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) and ESS are presented in\nthis manuscript. In particular two novel 10B-based detectors are described; one\nfor large area applications (the Multi-Grid prototype) and one for application\nin neutron refectometry (small area applications, the Multi-Blade prototype).\n"]}]

We estimate the different forms of energy associated with many\nof these small-scale eruptions, in particular the kinetic energy and enthalpy.\nTwo Hinode XRT campaign datasets focusing on the two polar coronal holes were\nselected to analyze the physical properties of coronal jets; the analyzed data\nwere acquired using a series of three XRT filters. Typical kinematical\nproperties (e.g., length, thickness, lifetime, ejection rate, and velocity) of\n18 jets are evaluated from the observed sequences, thus providing information\non their possible contribution to the fast solar wind flux escaping from\ncoronal holes. Electron temperatures and densities of polar-jet plasmas are\nalso estimated using ratios of the intensities observed in different filters.\n  We find that the largest amount of energy eventually provided to the corona\nis thermal. The energy due to waves may also be significant, but its value is\ncomparatively uncertain. The kinetic energy is lower than thermal energy, while\nother forms of energy are comparatively low. Lesser and fainter events seem to\nbe hotter, thus the total contribution by polar jets to the coronal heating\ncould have been underestimated so far. The kinetic energy flux is usually\naround three times smaller than the enthalpy counterpart, implying that this\nenergy is converted into plasma heating more than in plasma acceleration. This\nresult suggests that the majority of polar jets are most likely not escaping\nfrom the Sun and that only cooler ejections could possibly have enough kinetic\nenergy to contribute to the total solar wind flow.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 10 figures, Submitted and accepted for publishing in\n  Astronomy and Astrophysics journal"]}]

We use several graph topology metrics to\napproximate different aspects of the discourse flow that can indicate\ncoherence, such as the average clustering or betweenness of discourse entities\nin text.

We consider\nthe case where the toroidal field is unperturbed and the toroidal symmetry of\nthe system is preserved. The balance between the change in canonical angular\nmomentum and the input of mechanical angular momentum in such system requires\nrunaways to drift horizontally in configuration space for any given change in\nmomentum space. The dynamic of this drift can be obtained by taking the\nvariation of canonical angular momentum. It is then found that runaway\nelectrons will always drift inward as long as they are decelerating. This drift\nmotion is essentially non-linear, since the current is carried by runaways\nthemselves, and any runaway drift relative to the magnetic axis will cause\nfurther displacement of the axis itself. A simplified analytical model is\nconstructed to describe such inward drift both in ideal wall case and no wall\ncase, and the runaway current center displacement as a function of parallel\nmomentum variation is obtained.

For these reasons, much\nrecent attention has been focused on the development of supervised learning\nrules for spiking neural networks that utilise a temporal coding scheme.\nHowever, despite significant progress in this area, there still lack rules that\nhave a theoretical basis, and yet can be considered biologically relevant.

As part of our analysis we examine two spike-based learning\nmethods: one of which relies on an instantaneous error signal to modify\nsynaptic weights in a network (INST rule), and the other one on a filtered\nerror signal for smoother synaptic weight modifications (FILT rule). We test\nthe accuracy of the solutions provided by each rule with respect to their\ntemporal encoding precision, and then measure the maximum number of input\npatterns they can learn to memorise using the precise timings of individual\nspikes as an indication of their storage capacity. Our results demonstrate the\nhigh performance of FILT in most cases, underpinned by the rule's\nerror-filtering mechanism, which is predicted to provide smooth convergence\ntowards a desired solution during learning. We also find FILT to be most\nefficient at performing input pattern memorisations, and most noticeably when\npatterns are identified using spikes with sub-millisecond temporal precision.\nIn comparison with existing work, we determine the performance of FILT to be\nconsistent with that of the highly efficient E-learning Chronotron, but with\nthe distinct advantage that FILT is also implementable as an online method for\nincreased biological realism.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 10 figures, this version is published in PLoS ONE and\n  incorporates reviewer comments"]}]

Three different kinds of important quantum\namplifications, i.e., deterministic noisy quantum amplification, probabilistic\nnoiseless quantum amplification, and deterministic noiseless quantum\namplification are identified and discussed.

However, by the end of\nour simulations, we do not observe a magnetically dominated funnel and hence\nneither a relativistic outflow. With respect to the recent simulations of Ruiz\net al 2016, we evolve models with lower and more realistic initial magnetic\nfield strengths and, because of computational reasons, we do not evolve the\naccretion disk for the long timescales that seem to be required in order to see\na relativistic outflow. Since all our models produce a similar ordered magnetic\nfield structure, we expect that the results found in Ruiz et al 2016, where\nthey only considered an equal-mass system with an ideal fluid EOS, should be\ngeneral and, at least from a qualitative point of view, independent from\nmass-ratio, magnetic field orientation, and EOS.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 26 figures.

A\nsignificant challenge is the lack of training data, i.e., 2D images of humans\nannotated with 3D poses. Such data is necessary to train state-of-the-art CNN\narchitectures. Here, we propose a solution to generate a large set of\nphotorealistic synthetic images of humans with 3D pose annotations. We\nintroduce an image-based synthesis engine that artificially augments a dataset\nof real images with 2D human pose annotations using 3D Motion Capture (MoCap)\ndata. Given a candidate 3D pose our algorithm selects for each joint an image\nwhose 2D pose locally matches the projected 3D pose. The selected images are\nthen combined to generate a new synthetic image by stitching local image\npatches in a kinematically constrained manner. The resulting images are used to\ntrain an end-to-end CNN for full-body 3D pose estimation. We cluster the\ntraining data into a large number of pose classes and tackle pose estimation as\na K-way classification problem. Such an approach is viable only with large\ntraining sets such as ours. Our method outperforms the state of the art in\nterms of 3D pose estimation in controlled environments (Human3.6M) and shows\npromising results for in-the-wild images (LSP). This demonstrates that CNNs\ntrained on artificial images generalize well to real images.\n","Comment: 9 pages, accepted to appear in NIPS 2016"]}]

This setting offers the opportunity of improving the system\nperformance by employing multiple channel uses to convey a single message\n(output plant observation or control input). Common ways of doing so are\nthrough either repeating the message, or by quantizing it to a number of bits\nand then transmitting a channel coded version of the bits whose length is\ncommensurate with the number of channel uses per sampled message. We argue that\nsuch \"separated source and channel coding\" can be suboptimal and propose to\nperform joint source-channel coding. Since the block length is short we obviate\nthe need to go to the digital domain altogether and instead consider analog\njoint source-channel coding. For the case where the communication signaling\nrate is twice the sampling rate, we employ the Archimedean bi-spiral-based\nShannon-Kotel'nikov analog maps to show significant improvement in stability\nmargins and linear-quadratic Gaussian (LQG) costs over simple schemes that\nemploy repetition.\n","Comment: An extended version of a paper to be presented in CDC2016"]}]

The eavesdropper's bounds for correct\ndecoding probability and information are first revisited, and a new variant of\nthe information bound is derived. The new bound is valid for a general channel\nwith any fading and Gaussian noise. From these bounds, it is explicit that both\nthe information and probability are upper bounded by the average flatness\nfactor, i.e., the expected theta function of the faded lattice related to the\neavesdropper. Taking the minimization of the average flatness factor as a\ndesign criterion, simple geometric heuristics to minimize it in the low\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime in Gaussian and Rayleigh fast fading\nchannels are motivated. It is concluded that in the Gaussian channel, the\nsecurity boils down to the sphere packing density of the eavesdropper's\nlattice, whereas in the Rayleigh fading channel a full-diversity well-rounded\nlattice with a dense sphere packing will provide the best secrecy.

In such materials, time-dependent\npumping of electrons from a non-chiral external source generates a\nnon-vanishing chiral chemical potential. This is due to the different\ncapacities of the left- and right-handed (LH and RH) chiral Weyl cones arising\nfrom the difference in the density of states in the LH and RH cones. The chiral\nchemical potential then generates, via the chiral anomaly, a current along the\ndirection of an applied magnetic field even in the absence of an external\nelectric field. The source of chirality imbalance in this new setup is thus due\nto the band structure of the system and the presence of (non-chiral) electron\nsource, and not due to the parallel electric and magnetic fields.

Lubrication hydrodynamics fail to completely capture two key\nrheological properties - namely, that the viscosity increases drastically and\nthe first normal stress difference can switch signs as volume fraction\nincreases. Yet, simulations that account for interparticle friction are also\nunable to fully predict these properties. Furthermore, experiments show that\nrheological behavior can vary depending on particle roughness and\ndeformability.
