Scaled to these characteristic values of mass and\ndensity, the mean MAH, expressed in terms of the critical density of the\nUniverse, M(\\rho_{crit}(z)), resembles that of the enclosed density profile,\nM(<\\rho >), at z=0. Both follow closely the NFW profile, suggesting that the\nsimilarity of halo mass profiles originates from the mass-independence of halo\nMAHs. Support for this interpretation is provided by outlier halos whose\naccretion histories deviate from the NFW shape; their mass profiles show\ncorrelated deviations from NFW and are better approximated by Einasto profiles.\nFitting both M(<\\rho >) and M(\\rho_{crit}) with either NFW or Einasto profiles\nyield concentration and shape parameters that are correlated, confirming and\nextending earlier work linking the concentration of a halo with its accretion\nhistory. These correlations also confirm that halo structure is insensitive to\ninitial conditions: only halos whose accretion histories differ greatly from\nthe NFW shape show noticeable deviations from NFW in their mass profiles. As a\nresult, the NFW profile provides acceptable fits to hot dark matter halos,\nwhich do not form hierarchically, and for fluctuation power spectra other than\nCDM. Our findings, however, predict a subtle but systematic dependence of mass\nprofile shape on accretion history which, if confirmed, would provide strong\nsupport for the link between accretion history and halo structure we propose\nhere.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 8 figures, MNRAS 432 1103L (2013)"]}]

Such QSLs,\nhowever, have proven difficult to identify experimentally. The most promising\napproach is to study their exotic nature via the wave-vector and intensity\ndependence of their dynamical response in neutron scattering. A major search\nhas centered on iridate materials which are proposed to realize the celebrated\nKitaev model on a honeycomb lattice - a prototypical topological QSL system in\ntwo dimensions (2D). The difficulties of iridium for neutron measurements have,\nhowever, impeded progress significantly. Here we provide experimental evidence\nthat a material based on ruthenium, {\\alpha}-RuCl$_3$ realizes the same Kitaev\nphysics but is highly amenable to neutron investigation. Our measurements\nconfirm the requisite strong spin-orbit coupling, and a low temperature\nmagnetic order that matches the predicted phase proximate to the QSL.

This strategy works well if the statistic used is equitable [Reshef\net al. 2015a], i.e., if, for some measure of noise, it assigns similar scores\nto equally noisy relationships regardless of relationship type (e.g., linear,\nexponential, periodic).\n  In this paper, we introduce and characterize a population measure of\ndependence called MIC*.

Based on this theory, we introduce an\nefficient approach for computing MIC* from the density of a pair of random\nvariables, and we define a new consistent estimator MICe for MIC* that is\nefficiently computable. In contrast, there is no known polynomial-time\nalgorithm for computing the original equitable statistic MIC. We show through\nsimulations that MICe has better bias-variance properties than MIC.

Traveling waves have indeed recently been\nshown to exist in predator-prey systems, but the direction of the wave, an\nessential item of information in the context of the control of biological\ninvasions, is generally unknown. Preliminary numerical explorations have hinted\nthat control by generalist predators might be possible for prey populations\ndisplaying logistic growth. We aimed to formalize the conditions in which\nspatial biological control can be achieved by generalists, through an\nanalytical approach based on reaction-diffusion equations. The population of\nthe focal prey - the invader - is assumed to grow according to a logistic\nfunction. The predator has a type II functional response and is present\neverywhere in the domain, at its carrying capacity, on alternative hosts.\nControl, defined as the invader becoming extinct in the domain, may result from\nspatially independent demographic dynamics or from a spatial extinction wave.\nUsing comparison principles, we obtain sufficient conditions for control and\nfor invasion, based on scalar bistable partial differential equations (PDEs).\nThe searching efficiency and functional response plateau of the predator are\nidentified as the main parameters defining the parameter space for prey\nextinction and invasion.

The ability of generalist predators to control prey populations with\nlogistic growth lies in the bis-table dynamics of the coupled system, rather\nthan in the bistability of prey-only dynamics as observed for specialist\npredators attacking prey populations displaying Allee effects. The\nconsideration of space in predator-prey systems involving generalist predators\nwith a parabolic functional response is crucial. Analysis of the ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs) system identifies parameter regions with\nmonostable (extinction) and bistable (extinction or invasion) dynamics. By\ncontrast, analysis of the associated PDE system distinguishes different and\nadditional regions of invasion and extinction. Depending on the relative\npositions of these different zones, four patterns of spatial dynamics can be\nidentified : traveling waves of extinction and invasion, pulse waves of\nextinction and heterogeneous stationary positive solutions of the Turing type.\nAs a consequence, prey control is predicted to be possible when space is\nconsidered in additional situations other than those identified without\nconsidering space.

At each stage, there could be multiple items for sale but each item can\nonly appear in one stage. The type of the buyer at each stage is thus a\nmulti-dimensional vector characterizing the buyer's valuations of the items at\nthat stage and is assumed to be stage-wise independent.\n  In particular, we propose a novel class of mechanisms called bank account\nmechanisms. Roughly, a bank account mechanism is no different from any\nstage-wise individual mechanism except for an augmented structure called bank\naccount, a real number for each node that summarizes the history so far. We\nfirst establish that the optimal revenue from any dynamic mechanism in this\nsetting can be achieved by a bank account mechanism, and we provide a simple\ncharacterization of the set of incentive compatible and ex-post individually\nrational bank account mechanisms.

Cells within the population are characterised\nby their age. The age-dependent (oxygen-regulated) birth rate is given by a\nstochastic model of oxygen-dependent cell cycle progression. We then formulate\nan age-dependent birth-and-death process, which dictates the time evolution of\nthe cell population. The population is under a feedback loop which controls its\nsteady state size: cells consume oxygen which in turns fuels cell\nproliferation. We show that our stochastic model of cell cycle progression\nallows for heterogeneity within the cell population induced by stochastic\neffects. Such heterogeneous behaviour is reflected in variations in the\nproliferation rate. Within this set-up, we have established three main results.\nFirst, we have shown that the age to the G1/S transition, which essentially\ndetermines the birth rate, exhibits a remarkably simple scaling behaviour. This\nallows for a huge simplification of our numerical methodology. A further result\nis the observation that heterogeneous populations undergo an internal process\nof quasi-neutral competition.

By studying the notion of\nconditional MMPE, a unifying proof (i.e., for any $p$) of the SCPP is shown. A\ncomplementary bound to the SCPP is then shown, which bounds the MMPE for all\nSNR values {\\it below} a certain value, at which the MMPE is known. As a first\napplication of the MMPE, a bound on the conditional differential entropy in\nterms of the MMPE is provided, which then yields a generalization of the\nOzarow-Wyner lower bound on the mutual information achieved by a discrete input\non a Gaussian noise channel. As a second application, the MMPE is shown to\nimprove on previous characterizations of the phase transition phenomenon that\nmanifests, in the limit as the length of the capacity achieving code goes to\ninfinity, as a discontinuity of the MMSE as a function of SNR. As a final\napplication, the MMPE is used to show bounds on the second derivative of mutual\ninformation, that tighten previously known bounds.\n"]}]

The adhesion bonds attract each other and often aggregate into large\nclusters that are central to many biological processes. One possible origin of\nattractive interactions between adhesion bonds is the elastic response of the\nmembranes to their deformation by the bonds. Here, we analyze these\nelasticity-mediated interactions using a novel mean-field approach. Analysis of\nsystems at different densities of bonds, $\\phi$, reveals that the phase diagram\nexhibits a nearly-universal behavior when the temperature $T$ is plotted vs.\nthe scaled density $x=\\phi \\xi^2$, where $\\xi$ is the linear size of the\nmembrane's region affected by a single bond. The critical point $(\\phi_c,T_c)$\nis located at very low densities and slightly below $T_c$ we identify phase\ncoexistence between two low-density phases. Dense domains are observed only\nwhen the height by which the bonds deform the membranes, $h_0$, is much larger\nthan their thermal roughness, $\\Delta$, which occurs at very low temperatures\n$T\\ll T_c$. We conclude that the elasticity-mediated interactions are weak and\ncannot be regarded as responsible for the formation of dense adhesion domains.\nThe weakness of the elasticity-mediated effect and its relevance to dilute\nsystems only can be attributed to the fact that the membrane's elastic energy\nsaturates in the semi-dilute regime, when the typical spacing between the bonds\n$r\\gtrsim \\xi$, i.e., for $x\\lesssim 1$. Therefore, at higher densities, only\nthe mixing entropy of the bonds (which favors uniform distributions) is\nthermodynamically relevant.
