Moreover we\nconsider two natural parameters of the problem, for which we establish a sharp\nthreshold behavior between NP-hardness and tractability.

We highlight an\nunexpected connection between RGMA and the approximation of maximum cardinality\nmatching in unweighted graphs via randomized greedy algorithms.

It is also notoriously difficult to solve in large-scale since\nstandard techniques require expensive matrix decompositions. An alternative, is\nthe conditional gradient method (aka Frank-Wolfe algorithm) that regained much\ninterest in recent years, mostly due to its application to this specific\nsetting. The key benefit of the CG method is that it avoids expensive matrix\ndecompositions all together, and simply requires a single eigenvector\ncomputation per iteration, which is much more efficient. On the downside, the\nCG method, in general, converges with an inferior rate. The error for\nminimizing a $\\beta$-smooth function after $t$ iterations scales like\n$\\beta/t$. This convergence rate does not improve even if the function is also\nstrongly convex.\n  In this work we present a modification of the CG method tailored for convex\noptimization over the spectrahedron. The per-iteration complexity of the method\nis essentially identical to that of the standard CG method: only a single\neigenvecor computation is required. For minimizing an $\\alpha$-strongly convex\nand $\\beta$-smooth function, the expected approximation error of the method\nafter $t$ iterations is: $$O\\left({\\min\\{\\frac{\\beta{}}{t}\n,\\left({\\frac{\\beta\\sqrt{\\textrm{rank}(\\textbf{X}^*)}}{\\alpha^{1/4}t}}\\right)^{4/3},\n\\left({\\frac{\\beta}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}\\lambda_{\\min}(\\textbf{X}^*)t}}\\right)^{2}\\}}\\right)\n,$$ where $\\textbf{X}^*$ is the optimal solution.

Patients receive treatment in a\nclinical setting and need to practice outside of the clinical setting to\ngeneralize speech goals to functional communication. In this paper, we describe\nthe development of technology that captures mixed speech signals in a group\nsetting and allows the SLP to analyze the speech signals relative to treatment\ngoals. The mixed speech signals are blindly separated into individual signals\nthat are preprocessed before computation of loudness, pitch, shimmer, jitter,\nsemitone standard deviation and sharpness. The proposed method has been\npreviously validated on data obtained from clinical trials of people with\nParkinson disease and healthy controls.\n","Comment: 6 page, 9 figure, 1 table, 8 equations, Proceedings e-Health\n  Networking, Applications and Services (Healthcom), 2015 IEEE 17th\n  International Conference on, Boston, USA. 2015"]}]

In a previous study using fully-compliant elastic\ntubes, a `pointed' air finger was found to propagate at high speed and low\npressure, which may enable rapid reopening of highly collapsed airways with\nminimal tissue damage (Heap & Juel 2008). In this paper, we identify the\nselection mechanism of that pointed finger, which remained unexplained, by\nconducting an experimental study in a rigid rectangular Hele-Shaw channel with\nan elastic top boundary. The constitutive behaviour of this elasto-rigid\nchannel is broadly similar to that of an elastic tube, but unlike the tube the\nchannel's cross-section adopts self-similar shapes from the undeformed state to\nthe point of first near wall contact. The simplification of the vessel geometry\nenables the systematic investigation of the reopening dynamics in terms of\ninitial collapse. We find that for low levels of initial collapse, a single\ncentred symmetric finger propagates in the channel and its shape is set by the\ntip curvature. As the level of collapse increases, the channel cross-section\ndevelops a central region of near opposite wall contact, and the finger shape\nevolves smoothly towards a `flat-tipped' finger whose geometry is set by the\nstrong depth gradient near the channel walls. We show that the flat-tipped mode\nof reopening is analogous to the pointed finger observed in tubes. Its\npropagation is sustained by the vessel's extreme cross-sectional profile at\nhigh collapse, while vessel compliance stabilises it. A simple scaling argument\nbased on the dissipated power reveals that this reopening mode is preferred at\nhigher propagation speeds when it becomes favourable to displace the elastic\nchannel wall rather than the viscous fluid.\n"]}]

While our theoretical guarantees do\nnot apply to any polytope, they apply to several important structured polytopes\nthat capture central concepts such as paths in graphs, perfect matchings in\nbipartite graphs, marginal distributions that arise in structured prediction\ntasks, and more. Our theoretical findings are complemented by empirical\nevidence which shows that our method delivers state-of-the-art performance.\n"]}]

An apparatus and a method are\ndeveloped for plasma etching of the inner surfaces of SRF cavities. To test the\neffect of the plasma etching on the cavity rf performance, a 1497 MHz single\ncell SRF cavity is used. The single cell cavity is mechanically polished,\nbuffer chemically etched afterwards and rf tested at cryogenic temperatures for\na baseline test. This cavity is then plasma processed.

We find that essence of infrared abelian\ndominance is naturally understood with the off-diagonal gluon mass $m_{\\rm off}\n\\simeq 1.2 {\\rm GeV}$ induced by the MA gauge fixing. In the MA gauge, the\noff-diagonal gluon amplitude is forced to be small, and the off-diagonal gluon\nphase tends to be random. As the mathematical origin of abelian dominance for\nconfinement, we demonstrate that the strong randomness of the off-diagonal\ngluon phase leads to abelian dominance for the string tension. In the MA gauge,\nthere appears the macroscopic network of the monopole world-line covering the\nwhole system. We investigate the monopole-current system in the MA gauge by\nanalyzing the dual gluon field $B_\\mu$. We evaluate the dual gluon mass as $m_B\n= 0.4 \\sim$ 0.5GeV in the infrared region, which is the lattice-QCD evidence of\nthe dual Higgs mechanism by monopole condensation. Owing to infrared abelian\ndominance and infrared monopole condensation, QCD in the MA gauge is\ndescribable with the dual Ginzburg-Landau theory.\n","Comment: Invited talk given at KEK-Tanashi International Symposium on Physics\n  of Hadrons and Nuclei, Tokyo, Japan, 14-17 Dec 1998"]}]
