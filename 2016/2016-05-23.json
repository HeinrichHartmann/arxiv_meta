On the positive side,\nwe present a randomized approximation algorithm (RGMA) for GreedyMatching on a\nspecial class of weighted graphs, called bush graphs. We highlight an\nunexpected connection between RGMA and the approximation of maximum cardinality\nmatching in unweighted graphs via randomized greedy algorithms. We show that,\nif the approximation ratio of RGMA is $\\rho$, then for every $\\epsilon>0$ the\nrandomized MRG algorithm of [Aronson et al., Rand. Struct. Alg. 1995] gives a\n$(\\rho-\\epsilon)$-approximation for the maximum cardinality matching. We\nconjecture that a tight bound for $\\rho$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$; we prove our\nconjecture true for two subclasses of bush graphs. Proving a tight bound for\nthe approximation ratio of MRG on unweighted graphs (and thus also proving a\ntight value for $\\rho$) is a long-standing open problem [Poloczek and Szegedy;\nFOCS 2012]. This unexpected relation of our RGMA algorithm with the MRG\nalgorithm may provide new insights for solving this problem.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 6 figures"]}]

This paper\npresents the first theoretical and practical results on quantifying\nstatistically significant interactions between clusters in networks. Such\nproblems commonly arise in diverse applications, ranging from social network\nanalysis to systems biology. The paper addresses the problem of quantifying the\nstatistical significance of the observed overlap of the two clusters in an\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graph model. The analytical framework presented in the paper\nassigns a $p$-value to overlapping subgraphs by combining information about\nboth the sizes of the subgraphs and their edge densities in comparison to the\ncorresponding values for their overlapping component. This $p$-value is\ndemonstrated to have excellent discrimination properties in real applications\nand is shown to be robust across broad parameter ranges.\n  Our results are comprehensively validated on synthetic, social, and\nbiological networks.

It is also notoriously difficult to solve in large-scale since\nstandard techniques require expensive matrix decompositions. An alternative, is\nthe conditional gradient method (aka Frank-Wolfe algorithm) that regained much\ninterest in recent years, mostly due to its application to this specific\nsetting. The key benefit of the CG method is that it avoids expensive matrix\ndecompositions all together, and simply requires a single eigenvector\ncomputation per iteration, which is much more efficient. On the downside, the\nCG method, in general, converges with an inferior rate. The error for\nminimizing a $\\beta$-smooth function after $t$ iterations scales like\n$\\beta/t$. This convergence rate does not improve even if the function is also\nstrongly convex.\n  In this work we present a modification of the CG method tailored for convex\noptimization over the spectrahedron. The per-iteration complexity of the method\nis essentially identical to that of the standard CG method: only a single\neigenvecor computation is required. For minimizing an $\\alpha$-strongly convex\nand $\\beta$-smooth function, the expected approximation error of the method\nafter $t$ iterations is: $$O\\left({\\min\\{\\frac{\\beta{}}{t}\n,\\left({\\frac{\\beta\\sqrt{\\textrm{rank}(\\textbf{X}^*)}}{\\alpha^{1/4}t}}\\right)^{4/3},\n\\left({\\frac{\\beta}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}\\lambda_{\\min}(\\textbf{X}^*)t}}\\right)^{2}\\}}\\right)\n,$$ where $\\textbf{X}^*$ is the optimal solution. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first result that attains provably faster convergence rates for a\nCG variant for optimization over the spectrahedron. We also present encouraging\npreliminary empirical results.\n"]}]

In a previous study using fully-compliant elastic\ntubes, a `pointed' air finger was found to propagate at high speed and low\npressure, which may enable rapid reopening of highly collapsed airways with\nminimal tissue damage (Heap & Juel 2008). In this paper, we identify the\nselection mechanism of that pointed finger, which remained unexplained, by\nconducting an experimental study in a rigid rectangular Hele-Shaw channel with\nan elastic top boundary. The constitutive behaviour of this elasto-rigid\nchannel is broadly similar to that of an elastic tube, but unlike the tube the\nchannel's cross-section adopts self-similar shapes from the undeformed state to\nthe point of first near wall contact. The simplification of the vessel geometry\nenables the systematic investigation of the reopening dynamics in terms of\ninitial collapse. We find that for low levels of initial collapse, a single\ncentred symmetric finger propagates in the channel and its shape is set by the\ntip curvature. As the level of collapse increases, the channel cross-section\ndevelops a central region of near opposite wall contact, and the finger shape\nevolves smoothly towards a `flat-tipped' finger whose geometry is set by the\nstrong depth gradient near the channel walls. We show that the flat-tipped mode\nof reopening is analogous to the pointed finger observed in tubes. Its\npropagation is sustained by the vessel's extreme cross-sectional profile at\nhigh collapse, while vessel compliance stabilises it.

We investigate the monopole-current system in the MA gauge by\nanalyzing the dual gluon field $B_\\mu$. We evaluate the dual gluon mass as $m_B\n= 0.4 \\sim$ 0.5GeV in the infrared region, which is the lattice-QCD evidence of\nthe dual Higgs mechanism by monopole condensation. Owing to infrared abelian\ndominance and infrared monopole condensation, QCD in the MA gauge is\ndescribable with the dual Ginzburg-Landau theory.\n","Comment: Invited talk given at KEK-Tanashi International Symposium on Physics\n  of Hadrons and Nuclei, Tokyo, Japan, 14-17 Dec 1998"]}]
