The present paper\naims to fill this gap by developing a definition of 'emerging technologies' and\nlinking this conceptual effort with the development of a framework for the\noperationalisation of technological emergence.

When\nrequesting a piece of content, a user retrieves the content from the mobile\ndevices using device-to-device communication or, if not possible, from the base\nstation (BS), at the expense of a higher communication cost. We consider the\nrepair problem when a device that stores data leaves the network. In\nparticular, we introduce a repair scheduling where repair is performed (from\nstorage devices or the BS) periodically. We derive analytical expressions for\nthe overall communication cost of repair and download as a function of the\nrepair interval. We illustrate the analysis by giving results for maximum\ndistance separable codes and regenerating codes. Our results indicate that DS\ncan reduce the overall communication cost with respect to the case where\ncontent is only downloaded from the BS, provided that repairs are performed\nfrequently enough. The required repair frequency depends on the code used for\nstorage and the network parameters.

The proposed approach allows to jointly exploit both\nthe wireless and social context of wireless users for optimizing the overall\nallocation of resources and improving traffic offload in SCNs. This\ncontext-aware resource allocation problem is formulated as a matching game in\nwhich user equipments (UEs) and resource blocks (RBs) rank one another, based\non utility functions that capture both wireless and social metrics. Due to\nsocial interrelations, this game is shown to belong to a class of matching\ngames with peer effects. To solve this game, a novel, selforganizing algorithm\nis proposed, using which UEs and RBs can interact to decide on their desired\nallocation. The proposed algorithm is then proven to converge to a two-sided\nstable matching between UEs and RBs. The properties of the resulting stable\noutcome are then studied and assessed. Simulation results using real social\ndata show that clustering of socially connected users allows to offload a\nsubstantially larger amount of traffic than the conventional context-unaware\napproach.

To this end,\nwe propose an efficient computer assisted methodology, using fast Fourier\ntransform, having the same asymptotic cost of using the parameterization method\nfor obtaining numerical approximations of invariant tori.

Our numerical studies of the \"dynamical order parameter\" in\nEdwards-Anderson Ising spin glasses and random ferromagnets indicate that the\ninfluence of the initial state decays as dimension increases. Similarly, this\nsame order parameter for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick infinite-range spin glass\nindicates that this information decays as the number of spins increases. Based\non these results, we conjecture that the influence of the initial state on the\nfinal state decays to zero in finite-dimensional random-bond spin systems as\ndimension goes to infinity, regardless of the presence of frustration. We also\nstudy the rate at which spins \"freeze out\" to a final state as a function of\ndimensionality and number of spins, here the results indicate that the number\nof \"active\" spins at long times increases with dimension (for short-range\nsystems) or number of spins (for infinite-range systems). We provide heuristic\narguments to support these conjectures, and also analyze theoretically several\nmean-field models: the random energy model, the uniform Curie-Weiss\nferromagnet, and the disordered Curie-Weiss ferromagnet.

We resort to an\nelegant graph-theoretic model, introduced by Kleinberg and Oren, which consists\nof a task graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, including a source $s$ and target $t$,\nand an agent that incrementally constructs a path from $s$ to $t$ in order to\ncollect rewards. The twist is that the agent is present-biased and discounts\nfuture costs and rewards by a factor $\\beta\\in [0,1]$. Our design objective is\nto ensure that the agent reaches $t$ i.e.\\ completes the project, for as little\nreward as possible. Such graphs are called motivating. We consider two\nstrategies. First, we place a single reward $r$ at $t$ and try to guide the\nagent by removing edges from $G$. We prove that deciding the existence of such\nmotivating subgraphs is NP-complete if $r$ is fixed. More importantly, we\ngeneralize our reduction to a hardness of approximation result for computing\nthe minimum $r$ that admits a motivating subgraph. In particular, we show that\nno polynomial-time approximation to within a ratio of $\\sqrt{n}/4$ or less is\npossible, unless ${\\rm P}={\\rm NP}$. Furthermore, we develop a\n$(1+\\sqrt{n})$-approximation algorithm and thus settle the approximability of\ncomputing motivating subgraphs. Secondly, we study motivating reward\nconfigurations, where non-negative rewards $r(v)$ may be placed on arbitrary\nvertices $v$ of $G$. The agent only receives the rewards of visited vertices.\nAgain we give an NP-completeness result for deciding the existence of a\nmotivating reward configuration within a fixed budget $b$. This result even\nholds if $b=0$, which in turn implies that no efficient approximation of a\nminimum $b$ within a ration grater or equal to $1$ is possible, unless ${\\rm\nP}={\\rm NP}$.\n"]}]

That functor, from the category of sets to itself, is\npostulated to be an equivalence on the full subcategory of finite sets onto\nitself and to preserve finite projective limits (equivalently, to preserve\nfinite products and equalizers). Secondly, \"Local\" non-standard analysis is\nintroduced as a structure which I call lim-rim, in particular exact lim-rims.\nThe interplay between these, and ultrafilters and ultrapowers, and also\ncardinality relations and notions depending on a cardinality such as saturation\nand what I call \"confinement\" and \"exactness\", are investigated.\n  In particular, one constructs non-standard analyses, with \"good\" kinds of\nlim-rims. In these one may say that *A - \"the adjunction of all possible limits\nfrom A\" - plays a role analogous to that of the algebraic closure of a field -\n\"the adjunction of all roots of polynomials\". Then in the same spirit as with\nthe latter, one has uniqueness up to isomorphism, and also universality and\nhomogeneity, provided one has enough General Continuum Hypothesis. The\ncardinality of *A will be something like $2^{2^{|A|}}$, and one has a high\ndegree of saturation.\n  Also, one notes that the functor * can be applied again to *A, giving **A,\n***A, and so forth.

To this end,\na summary of the two-dimensional fields of the fundamental turbulence\nparameters is given for AR ranging from 1 to 2. The results show that the flow\nfield depends strongly on AR only within the canyon, while the outer flow seems\nto be less sensitive to this parameter. This is not true for the vertical\nmomentum flux, which is one of the parameters most affected by AR, both within\nand outside the canyon.

None of perfect cuboids is known thus far.\nTheir non-existence is also not proved. This is an old unsolved mathematical\nproblem.\n  Three mathematical propositions have been recently associated with the cuboid\nproblem. They are known as three cuboid conjectures. These three conjectures\nspecify three special subcases in the search for perfect cuboids. The case of\nthe second conjecture is associated with solutions of a tenth degree\nDiophantine equation. In the present paper a fast algorithm for searching\nsolutions of this Diophantine equation using modulo primes seive is suggested\nand its implementation on 32-bit Windows platform with Intel-compatible\nprocessors is presented.\n","Comment: AmSTeX, 11 pages, amsppt style"]}]
