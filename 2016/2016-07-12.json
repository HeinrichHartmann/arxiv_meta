This algorithm performs checking of\nsub-lists, containing (p-1) entries (edge pairs) for paths and p entries (edge\npairs) for circuits, chosen from ordered adjacency list in a well defined\nsequence to determine exactly the shortest Hamiltonian path and shortest\nHamiltonian circuit in a weighted complete graph of p vertices. The procedure\nhas intrinsic advantage of landing on the desired solution in quickest possible\ntime and even in worst case in polynomial time. A new characterisation of\nshortest Hamiltonian tour for a weighted complete graph satisfying triangle\ninequality (i.e. for tours passing through every city on a realistic map of\ncities where cities can be taken as points on a Euclidean plane) is also\nproposed.

This is also the case if dark matter can be treated as a\nself-gravitating collisionless gas experiencing Lynden-Bell's type of violent\nrelaxation. In order to avoid the infinite mass problem and carry out a\nrigorous stability analysis, we consider the fermionic King model. In this\npaper, we study the non-degenerate limit leading to the classical King model.\nThis model was initially introduced to describe globular clusters. We propose\nto apply it also to large dark matter halos where quantum effects are\nnegligible. We determine the caloric curve and study the thermodynamical\nstability of the different configurations. Equilibrium states exist only above\na critical energy $E_c$ in the microcanonical ensemble and only above a\ncritical temperature $T_c$ in the canonical ensemble. For $E<E_c$, the system\nundergoes a gravothermal catastrophe and, for $T<T_c$, it undergoes an\nisothermal collapse. We compute the profiles of density, circular velocity, and\nvelocity dispersion. We compare the prediction of the classical King model to\nthe observations of large dark matter halos. Because of collisions and\nevaporation, the central density increases while the slope of the halo density\nprofile decreases until an instability takes place. We show that large dark\nmatter halos are relatively well-described by the King model at, or close to,\nthe point of marginal microcanonical stability. At that point, the King model\ngenerates a density profile that can be approximated by the modified Hubble\nprofile. This profile has a flat core and decreases as $r^{-3}$ at large\ndistances, like the observational Burkert profile. Less steep halos are\nunstable.\n"]}]

In order to\npractically realize such pricing markets, we propose novel and\n\\emph{computationally efficient} consumer differentiated pricing mechanisms for\nSVs based on (i) the market structure, (ii) the communication network structure\nof SV consumers captured via a consumer's \\emph{Bonacich centrality} in the\nnetwork, and (iii) security investment amounts made by SV consumers.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1101.5617 by other authors\n  without attribution"]}]

An Eulerian Lagrangian model of the nanofluids show that such\nsmart coolants not only reduce the hot spot core temperature, but also the hot\nspot core region and thermal slip mechanisms of Brownian diffusion and\nthermophoresis are at the crux of this. The present work conclusively shows\nthat high flow maldistribution leads to high thermal maldistribution, as the\ncommon prevalent notion, is no longer valid and existing maldistribution can be\neffectively utilized to tackle specific hot spot location, making the present\nstudy important to the field.\n","Comment: 25 pages 11 figures"]}]

One of the most important theories for the MDL principle is Barron and\nCover's theory (BC theory), which gives a mathematical justification of the MDL\nprinciple. The original BC theory, however, can be applied to supervised\nlearning only approximately and limitedly. Though Barron et al. recently\nsucceeded in removing a similar approximation in case of unsupervised learning,\ntheir idea cannot be essentially applied to supervised learning in general. To\novercome this issue, an extension of BC theory to supervised learning is\nproposed. The derived risk bound has several advantages inherited from the\noriginal BC theory. First, the risk bound holds for finite sample size. Second,\nit requires remarkably few assumptions. Third, the risk bound has a form of\nredundancy of the two-stage code for the MDL procedure. Hence, the proposed\nextension gives a mathematical justification of the MDL principle to supervised\nlearning like the original BC theory. As an important example of application,\nnew risk and (probabilistic) regret bounds of lasso with random design are\nderived. The derived risk bound holds for any finite sample size $n$ and\nfeature number $p$ even if $n\\ll p$ without boundedness of features in contrast\nto the past work.

Its central tenet is that during NN search, a query is not compared\nto every example in a database, ignoring class information. Instead, NN\nsearches are performed within each class, generating a score per class. A key\nproblem with NN techniques, including NBNN, is that they fail when the data\nrepresentation does not capture perceptual (e.g.~class-based) similarity.

The ABC-SD generates pseudo data from a\nsingle parametric distribution thought to be the true distribution of\nunderlying study data. This single distribution is either an educated guess, or\nit is selected via model selection using posterior probability criterion for\ntesting two or more candidate distributions. Further analysis indicated that\nwhen model selection is used, posterior model probabilities are sensitive to\nthe prior distribution(s) for parameter(s) and dependable on the type of\nreported summary statistics. Method: We propose ABC with Bayesian model\naveraging (ABC-BMA) methodology to estimate mean and standard deviation based\non various sets of other summary statistics reported in published studies.

As an\napplication, we show that the canonical map is moreover injective in the case\nof cones over smooth plane curves of degree greater than or equal to four as\nwell as in the case of Mumford's (celebrated) singular surface.\n","Comment: 13 pages"]}]
