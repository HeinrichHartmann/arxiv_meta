Yet, how such systems may specifically\ncommunicate and dynamically route information is not well understood. Here we\nidentify a generic mechanism to route information on top of collective\ndynamical reference states in complex networks. Switching between collective\ndynamics induces flexible reorganization of information sharing and routing\npatterns, as quantified by delayed mutual information and transfer entropy\nmeasures between activities of a network's units. We demonstrate the power of\nthis generic mechanism specifically for oscillatory dynamics and analyze how\nindividual unit properties, the network topology and external inputs coact to\nsystematically organize information routing. For multi-scale, modular\narchitectures, we resolve routing patterns at all levels. Interestingly, local\ninterventions within one sub-network may remotely determine non-local\nnetwork-wide communication. These results help understanding and designing\ninformation routing patterns across systems where collective dynamics co-occurs\nwith a communication function.\n"]}]

Rather than the decay of\nthe standard deviation of concentration, which is a global parameter commonly\nemployed in studies of mixing, we instead use multiscale tools adapted from\nstudies of chaotic flows or intermittent turbulent mixing: concentration\nspectra and second and fourth moments of the probability density functions of\nscalar gradients. Not only can these tools be used in open flows, but they also\nallow for scale-by-scale analysis. Strikingly, diffusiophoresis is shown to\naffect all scales, although more particularly the small ones, resulting in a\nchange of scalar intermittency and in an unusual scale bridging spanning more\nthan seven orders of magnitude. By quantifying the averaged impact of\ndiffusiophoresis on the macroscale mixing, we explain why the effects observed\nare consistent with the introduction of an effective P\\'eclet number.\n","Comment: 13 pages"]}]

It is well known that the laser intensity should to\nexceed certain threshold in order to generate HHG, when noble gas atoms in\ntheir ground state are used as an active medium. One way to enhance the\ncoherent light coming from a conventional laser oscillator is to take advantage\nof the amplification obtained by the so-called surface plasmon polaritons,\ncreated when a low intensity laser field is focused onto a metallic\nnanostructure. The main limitation of this scheme is the low damage threshold\nof the materials employed in the nanostructures engineering. In this work we\npropose to use Rydberg atoms, driven by spatially inhomogeneous,\nplasmonic-enhanced laser fields, for HHG. We exhaustively discuss the behaviour\nand efficiency of these systems in the generation of coherent harmonic\nemission. To this aim we numerically solve the time-dependent Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation for an atom with an electron initially in a highly excited $n$-th\nRydberg state, located in the vicinity of a metallic nanostructure, where the\nelectric field changes spatially on the scales relevant for the dynamics of the\nlaser-ionized electron.

We discuss the scaling of the relevant input\nparameters with the principal quantum number $n$ of the Rydberg state in\nquestion, and demonstrate that harmonic emission could be achieved from Rydberg\natoms well below the damage threshold, thus without deteriorating the geometry\nand properties of the metallic nanostructure.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 9 figures"]}]

The key observation, which to our knowledge is not very well\nappreciated, is that asymptotic boundary conditions play an essential role on\nextending the replica trick to the bulk. For non AAdS, we expect the following\nthree main modifications: (1) the expansion near the special surface has to be\ncompatible with the asymptotic expansion; (2) periodic conditions are imposed\nto coordinates on the phase space with diagonalized symplectic structure, not\nto all fields appearing in the action; (3) evaluating the entanglement\nfunctional using the boundary term method amounts to evaluating the\npresymplectic structure at the special surface, where some additional exact\nform may contribute. An explicit calculation is carried out for\nthree-dimensional warped anti-de Sitter spacetime (WAdS3) in a consistent\ntruncation of string theory, the so-called S-dual dipole theory. It turns out\nthat the generalized gravitational entropy in WAdS3 is captured by the least\naction of a charged particle in WAdS3 space, or equivalently, by the geodesic\nlength in an auxiliary AdS3. Consequently, the bulk calculation agrees with the\nCFT results, providing another piece of evidence for the WAdS3/CFT2\ncorrespondence.\n","Comment: 19 pages"]}]

Since lensing involves light bending, we shall first show that the\nsolution adds to Schwarzschild light bending caused by the luminous mass\n($M_{\\ast }$) a positive contribution $+\\gamma R$ contrary to the previous\nresults in the literature, thereby resolving a long standing problem. The cause\nof the error is critically examined. Applying the expressions for light bending\ntogether with an input equating Einstein and Weyl angles, we develop a novel\nalgorithm for separating the luminous component from the total lens mass\n(luminous+dark) within the Einstein radius. Our results indicate that the\nluminous mass estimates differ from the observed total lens masses by a linear\nproportionality factor. In quantitative detail, we observe that the ratios of\nluminous over total lens mass ($f^{\\ast }$) within the Einstein radius of\nindividual galaxies take on values near unity, many of which remarkably fall\ninside or just marginally outside the specified error bars obtained from a\nsimulation based on the Bruzual-Charlot stellar population synthesis model\ntogether with the Salpeter IMF favored on the ground of metallicity\n[Grillo,2009].

Further, factors reflecting\npolitical instability and lack of mechanism for enforcement of contracts that\ncan affect both direct foreign investment and also portfolio investment, have\nbeen incorporated. The explanatory variables chosen are the 3 month Rupee\nDollar futures exchange rate (FX4), NIFTY returns (NIFTYR), Dow Jones\nIndustrial Average returns (DJIAR), Hang Seng returns (HSR), DAX returns (DR),\ncrude oil price (COP), CBOE VIX (CV) and India VIX (IV).

We proposes to exploit stranded power,\nrenewable energy that has no value to the power grid, for scaling\nsupercomputers, Zero-Carbon Cloud (ZCCloud), and showing that stranded power\ncan be employed effectively to expand computing [1]. We build on those results\nwith a new analysis of stranded power, characterizing temporal, geographic, and\ninterval properties. We simulate production supercomputing workloads and model\ndatacenter total-cost-of-ownership (TCO), assessing the costs and capabilities\nof stranded-power based supercomputing. Results show that the ZCCloud approach\nis cost-effective today in regions with high cost power. The ZCCloud approach\nreduces TCO by 21-45%, and improves cost-effectiveness up to 34%. We study many\nscenarios. With higher power price, cheaper computing hardware and higher\nsystem power density, benefits rise to 55%, 97% and 116% respectively. Finally,\nwe study future extreme-scale systems, showing that beyond terascale, projected\npower requirements in excess of 100MW make ZCCloud up to 45% lower cost, for a\nfixed budget, increase peak PFLOPS achievable by 80%.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 22 figures"]}]

We\nbegin by computing the dual of this problem using a min-max argument. We find\nthat the dual is a 1-D problem of obstacle type, where the obstacle is related\nto the covariance structure of the underlying process. This approach yields an\nalternative way to understand Replica Symmetry Breaking at the level of the\nvariational problem through topological properties of the coincidence set of\nthe optimal dual variable. Using this duality, we give an algorithm to reduce\nthis a priori infinite dimensional variational problem to a finite dimensional\none, thereby confining all possible forms of Replica Symmetry Breaking in these\nmodels to a finite parameter family. These results complement the authors'\nrelated results for the low temperature $\\Gamma$-limit of this variational\nproblem.
