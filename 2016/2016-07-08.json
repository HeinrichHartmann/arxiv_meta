Yet, how such systems may specifically\ncommunicate and dynamically route information is not well understood. Here we\nidentify a generic mechanism to route information on top of collective\ndynamical reference states in complex networks. Switching between collective\ndynamics induces flexible reorganization of information sharing and routing\npatterns, as quantified by delayed mutual information and transfer entropy\nmeasures between activities of a network's units. We demonstrate the power of\nthis generic mechanism specifically for oscillatory dynamics and analyze how\nindividual unit properties, the network topology and external inputs coact to\nsystematically organize information routing. For multi-scale, modular\narchitectures, we resolve routing patterns at all levels. Interestingly, local\ninterventions within one sub-network may remotely determine non-local\nnetwork-wide communication. These results help understanding and designing\ninformation routing patterns across systems where collective dynamics co-occurs\nwith a communication function.\n"]}]

Not only can these tools be used in open flows, but they also\nallow for scale-by-scale analysis. Strikingly, diffusiophoresis is shown to\naffect all scales, although more particularly the small ones, resulting in a\nchange of scalar intermittency and in an unusual scale bridging spanning more\nthan seven orders of magnitude. By quantifying the averaged impact of\ndiffusiophoresis on the macroscale mixing, we explain why the effects observed\nare consistent with the introduction of an effective P\\'eclet number.\n","Comment: 13 pages"]}]

It is well known that the laser intensity should to\nexceed certain threshold in order to generate HHG, when noble gas atoms in\ntheir ground state are used as an active medium. One way to enhance the\ncoherent light coming from a conventional laser oscillator is to take advantage\nof the amplification obtained by the so-called surface plasmon polaritons,\ncreated when a low intensity laser field is focused onto a metallic\nnanostructure. The main limitation of this scheme is the low damage threshold\nof the materials employed in the nanostructures engineering. In this work we\npropose to use Rydberg atoms, driven by spatially inhomogeneous,\nplasmonic-enhanced laser fields, for HHG. We exhaustively discuss the behaviour\nand efficiency of these systems in the generation of coherent harmonic\nemission. To this aim we numerically solve the time-dependent Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation for an atom with an electron initially in a highly excited $n$-th\nRydberg state, located in the vicinity of a metallic nanostructure, where the\nelectric field changes spatially on the scales relevant for the dynamics of the\nlaser-ionized electron.

We discuss the scaling of the relevant input\nparameters with the principal quantum number $n$ of the Rydberg state in\nquestion, and demonstrate that harmonic emission could be achieved from Rydberg\natoms well below the damage threshold, thus without deteriorating the geometry\nand properties of the metallic nanostructure.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 9 figures"]}]

The key observation, which to our knowledge is not very well\nappreciated, is that asymptotic boundary conditions play an essential role on\nextending the replica trick to the bulk. For non AAdS, we expect the following\nthree main modifications: (1) the expansion near the special surface has to be\ncompatible with the asymptotic expansion; (2) periodic conditions are imposed\nto coordinates on the phase space with diagonalized symplectic structure, not\nto all fields appearing in the action; (3) evaluating the entanglement\nfunctional using the boundary term method amounts to evaluating the\npresymplectic structure at the special surface, where some additional exact\nform may contribute. An explicit calculation is carried out for\nthree-dimensional warped anti-de Sitter spacetime (WAdS3) in a consistent\ntruncation of string theory, the so-called S-dual dipole theory. It turns out\nthat the generalized gravitational entropy in WAdS3 is captured by the least\naction of a charged particle in WAdS3 space, or equivalently, by the geodesic\nlength in an auxiliary AdS3. Consequently, the bulk calculation agrees with the\nCFT results, providing another piece of evidence for the WAdS3/CFT2\ncorrespondence.\n","Comment: 19 pages"]}]

We further propose that the voltage hysteresis\nin the $FeF_3$ electrode is kinetic in nature. It is the result of Ohmic\nvoltage drop, reaction overpotential, and different spatial distributions of\nelectrochemically-active phases (i.e. compositional inhomogeneity). Therefore,\nthe large hysteresis can be expected to be mitigated by rational design and\noptimization of material microstructure and electrode architecture to improve\nthe energy efficiency of lithium-ion batteries based on conversion chemistry.\n"]}]
