However, He has very different\nchemical properties and no phase transition is expected before H2 in dense\ninterstellar medium (ISM) conditions.

Then, combining the Lennard-Jones and\ngravitational potentials, the non-linear dynamics of fluid mixtures are studied\nvia computer simulations using the molecular dynamics code LAMMPS.\n  Along with the classical, ideal-gas Jeans instability criterion, a fluid\nmixture is always gravitationally unstable if it is in a phase transition\nbecause compression does not increase pressure. However, the condensed phase\nfraction increases. In unstable situations the species can separate: in some\nconditions He precipitates faster than H2, while in other conditions the\nconverse occurs. Also, for an initial gas phase collapse the geometry is\nessential.

If not accounted for, even a small orbital eccentricity can cause a\npotentially significant systematic error in the mass parameters of an\ninspiralling binary. Gravitational-wave search templates typically rely on the\nquasi-circular approximation, which provides relatively simple expressions for\nthe gravitational-wave phase to 3.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order. The\nquasi-Keplerian formalism provides an elegant but complex description of the\npost-Newtonian corrections to the orbits and waveforms of inspiralling binaries\nwith any eccentricity. Here we specialize the quasi-Keplerian formalism to\nbinaries with low eccentricity. In this limit the non-periodic contribution to\nthe gravitational-wave phasing can be expressed explicitly as simple functions\nof frequency or time, with little additional complexity beyond the well-known\nformulas for circular binaries. These eccentric phase corrections are computed\nto 3PN order and to leading order in the eccentricity for the standard PN\napproximants. For a variety of systems these eccentricity corrections cause\nsignificant corrections to the number of gravitational wave cycles that sweep\nthrough a detector's frequency band. This is evaluated using several measures,\nincluding a modification of the useful cycles. We also evaluate the role of\nperiodic terms that enter the phasing and discuss how they can be incorporated\ninto some of the PN approximants.

The classical Kalman filter is no longer computationally feasible in\nsuch a high dimensional context. This problem can often be resolved by\nexploiting the underlying multiscale structure, applying the full Kalman\nfiltering procedures only to the large scale vari- ables, and estimating the\nsmall scale variables with proper statistical strategies, including\nmultiplicative inflation, representation model error in the observations, and\ncrude localization. The resulting two-scale reduced filters can have close to\noptimal numerical filtering skill based on previous numerical evidence. Yet, no\nrigorous explanation exists for this success, because these modifications\ncreate unavoidable bias and model error. This paper contributes to this issue\nby establishing a new error analysis framework for two different reduced random\nKalman filters, valid independent of the large dimension. The first part of our\nresults examines the fidelity of the covariance estimators, which is essential\nfor accurate uncertainty quantification. In a simplified setting, this is\ndemonstrated by showing the true error covariance is dominated by its\nestimators. In general settings, the Mahalanobis error and its intrinsic\ndissipation can indicate covariance fidelity. The second part develops upper\nbounds for the covariance estimators by comparing with proper Kalman filters.\nCombining both results, the classical tools for Kalman filters can be used as\na-priori performance criteria for the reduced filters.

However, naive gradient methods generally converge\nslowly. Hence, much efforts have been made to accelerate various first-order\nmethods. This paper proposes two accelerated methods towards solving structured\nlinearly constrained convex programming, for which we assume composite convex\nobjective.\n  The first method is the accelerated linearized augmented Lagrangian method\n(LALM). At each update to the primal variable, it allows linearization to the\ndifferentiable function and also the augmented term, and thus it enables easy\nsubproblems. Assuming merely weak convexity, we show that LALM owns $O(1/t)$\nconvergence if parameters are kept fixed during all the iterations and can be\naccelerated to $O(1/t^2)$ if the parameters are adapted, where $t$ is the\nnumber of total iterations.\n  The second method is the accelerated linearized alternating direction method\nof multipliers (LADMM). In addition to the composite convexity, it further\nassumes two-block structure on the objective. Different from classic ADMM, our\nmethod allows linearization to the objective and also augmented term to make\nthe update simple. Assuming strong convexity on one block variable, we show\nthat LADMM also enjoys $O(1/t^2)$ convergence with adaptive parameters. This\nresult is a significant improvement over that in [Goldstein et. al, SIIMS'14],\nwhich requires strong convexity on both block variables and no linearization to\nthe objective or augmented term.\n  Numerical experiments are performed on quadratic programming, image\ndenoising, and support vector machine.

The shear observed in filament channels represents magnetic helicity,\nwhile the smoothness of the coronal loops indicates an apparent lack of\nmagnetic helicity in the rest of the corona. At the same time, models that\nattempt to explain the high temperatures observed in these coronal loops\nrequire magnetic energy, in the form of twist, to be injected at the\nphotosphere. In addition to magnetic energy, this twist also represents\nmagnetic helicity. Unlike magnetic energy, magnetic helicity is conserved under\nreconnection, and is consequently expected to accumulate and be observed in the\ncorona. However, filament channels, rather than the coronal loops, are the\nlocations in the corona where magnetic helicity is observed, and it manifests\nitself in the form of shear, rather than twist. This naturally raises the\nquestion: if magnetic helicity needs to be injected to heat coronal loops, why\nis it only observed in filament channels, while coronal loops are observed to\nbe laminar and smooth? This thesis addresses this question using a series of\nnumerical simulations that demonstrate that magnetic helicity is transported\nthroughout the solar corona by magnetic reconnection in such a way that it\naccumulates above PILs, forming filament channels, and leaving the rest of the\ncorona generally smooth. In the process, it converts magnetic energy into heat,\naccounting for the large observed temperatures.

We simultaneously track the contributions\nfrom the key astrophysical sources (SNII, SNIa, AGN and GRBs) for the entire\nUniverse, for both scenarios, to determine its habitability through 13.8\nbillion years of cosmic time. We find that SNII dominate the total radiation\nbudget and the volume irradiated by deleterious radiation at any cosmic epoch\nclosely followed by SNIa (that contribute half as much as SNII), with GRBs and\nAGN making up a negligible portion (<1%). Secondly, as a result of the total\nmass in stars (or the total number of planets) slowly building-up with time and\nthe total deleterious radiation density, and volume affected, falling-off after\nthe first 3 billion years, we find that the Universe has steadily increased in\nhabitability through cosmic time. We find that, depending on the exact model\nassumptions, the Universe is 2.5 to 20 times more habitable today compared to\nwhen life first appeared on the Earth 4 billion years ago. We find that this\nincrease in habitability will persist until the final stars die out over the\nnext hundreds of billions of years.\n","Comment: Under refereeing in ApJ"]}]
