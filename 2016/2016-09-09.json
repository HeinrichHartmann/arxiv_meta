The \\emph{discrete Fr\\'echet distance} is an analogous similarity\nmeasure, defined for a sequence $A$ of $m$ points and a sequence $B$ of $n$\npoints, where the points are usually sampled from input curves. In this paper\nwe consider a variant, called the \\emph{discrete Fr\\'echet distance with\nshortcuts}, which captures the similarity between (sampled) curves in the\npresence of outliers. For the \\emph{two-sided} case, where shortcuts are\nallowed in both curves, we give an $O((m^{2/3}n^{2/3}+m+n)\\log^3 (m+n))$-time\nalgorithm for computing this distance. When shortcuts are allowed only in one\nnoise-containing curve, we give an even faster randomized algorithm that runs\nin $O((m+n)^{6/5+\\varepsilon})$ expected time, for any $\\varepsilon>0$.\n  Our techniques are novel and may find further applications. One of the main\nnew technical results is: Given two sets of points $A$ and $B$ and an interval\n$I$, we develop an algorithm that decides whether the number of pairs $(x,y)\\in\nA\\times B$ whose distance ${\\rm dist}(x,y)$ is in $I$, is less than some given\nthreshold $L$. The running time of this algorithm decreases as $L$ increases.\nIn case there are more than $L$ pairs of points whose distance is in $I$, we\ncan get a small sample of pairs that contains a pair at approximate median\ndistance (i.e., we can approximately \"bisect\" $I$). We combine this procedure\nwith additional ideas to search, with a small overhead, for the optimal\none-sided Fr\\'echet distance with shortcuts, using a very fast decision\nprocedure. We also show how to apply this technique for approximating distance\nselection (with respect to rank), and for computing the semi-continuous\nFr\\'echet distance with one-sided shortcuts.\n","Comment: This version also corrects mistakes that appeared in the journal\n  version of this paper: \"The Discrete and Semicontinuous Fr\\'echet Distance\n  with Shortcuts via Approximate Distance Counting and Selection.\" ACM Trans.\n  Algorithms 11(4): 29 (2015)"]}]

Although the invariance method of Lie-groups is able to generate\nstatistical scaling laws for wall-bounded turbulent flows, like the log-law for\nexample, these invariant results yet not only fail to fulfil the basic\nrequirements for a first principle result, but also are strongly misleading.\nThe reason is that not the functional structure of the log-law itself is\nmisleading, but that its invariant Lie-group based derivation yielding this\nfunction is what is misleading.

Here,\nwe study a generic model in which N motors are elastically coupled to a cargo,\nwhich itself is subjected to thermal noise in the cytoplasm and to an\nadditional external applied force. The motor-hopping rates are chosen to\nsatisfy detailed balance with respect to the energy of elastic stretching.

Our\nsimulations reveal that debris circularization depends sensitively on the\nefficiency of radiative cooling. There are two stages in debris circularization\nif radiative cooling is inefficient: first, the stellar debris streams\nself-intersect due to relativistic apsidal precession; shocks at the\nintersection points thermalize orbital energy and the debris forms a\ngeometrically thick, ring-like structure around the black hole. The ring\nrapidly spreads via viscous diffusion, leading to the formation of a\ngeometrically thick accretion disk. In contrast, if radiative cooling is\nefficient, the stellar debris circularizes due to self-intersection shocks and\nforms a geometrically thin ring-like structure. In this case, the dissipated\nenergy can be emitted during debris circularization as a precursor to the\nsubsequent tidal disruption flare. The possible radiated energy is up to\n~2*10^{52} erg for a 1 Msun star orbiting a 10^6 Msun black hole. We also find\nthat a retrograde (prograde) black hole spin causes the shock-induced\ncircularization timescale to be shorter (longer) than that of a non-spinning\nblack hole in both cooling cases. The circularization timescale is remarkably\nlong in the radiatively efficient cooling case, and is also sensitive to black\nhole spin. Specifically, Lense-Thirring torques cause dynamically important\nnodal precession, which significantly delays debris circularization. On the\nother hand, nodal precession is too slow to produce observable signatures in\nthe radiatively inefficient case.

Here, soundness is unconditional---i.e. it holds even\nfor computationally unbounded provers.

Because the overhead is very low for each run (it\nis linear in the size of the circuit), this shows that verification could be\nachieved at minimal cost compared to performing the computation.

The\nchallenge is to maintain gauge invariance, while simultaneously incorporating\nadditional self-energy terms arising from strong correlation effects.

The notion of an element of a subset has as its dual\nthe notion of a distinction of a partition (a pair of elements in different\nblocks). Boole developed finite logical probability as the normalized counting\nmeasure on elements of subsets so there is a dual concept of logical entropy\nwhich is the normalized counting measure on distinctions of partitions. Thus\nthe logical notion of information is a measure of distinctions. Classical\nlogical entropy also extends naturally to the notion of quantum logical entropy\nwhich provides a more natural and informative alternative to the usual Von\nNeumann entropy in quantum information theory. The quantum logical entropy of a\npost-measurement density matrix has the simple interpretation as the\nprobability that two independent measurements of the same state using the same\nobservable will have different results. The main result of the paper is that\nthis increase in quantum logical entropy due to a projective measurement of a\npure state is the sum of the absolute squares of the off-diagonal entries\n(`coherences') of the pure state density matrix that are zeroed (decohered) by\nthe measurement, i.e., the measure of the distinctions (`decoherences') created\nby the measurement. The Von Neumann entropy provides no such analysis of\nmeasurement.

And\nthe receiver will get different output states depending on the first preparer's\nmeasurement result in the amplitude-damping noise.

Here,\nour purpose is (i) to review factor analytic efforts in the study of MBS with\nemphasis on misusage of the FA model and (ii) to propose an alternative factor\nanalytic strategy.\n  Methods: The proposed factor analytic strategy consists of four steps and\nconfronts weaknesses in application of the FA model. At its heart lies the\nexplicit separation of dimensionality and pattern selection as well as the\ndirect evaluation of competing inequality-constrained loading patterns. A\nhigh-profile MBS data set with anthropometric measurements on overweight\nchildren and adolescents is reanalyzed using this strategy.\n  Results: The reanalysis implied a more parsimonious constellation of\npathophysiological domains underlying phenotypic expressions of MBS than the\noriginal analysis (and many other analyzes). The results emphasize correlated\nfactors of impaired glucose metabolism and impaired lipid metabolism.\n  Conclusions: Pathophysiological domains underlying phenotypic expressions of\nMBS included in the analysis are driven by multiple interrelated metabolic\nimpairments.

These neurons can be\nseparated into two types (A and C) based on the myelination of their axons and\ntheir distinct firing patterns elicited in response to specific pressure\nstimuli. This study has developed a comprehensive model of the afferent\nbaroreceptor discharge built on physiological knowledge of arterial wall\nmechanics, firing rate responses to controlled pressure stimuli, and ion\nchannel dynamics within the baroreceptor neurons. With this model, we were able\nto predict firing rates observed in previously published experiments in both A-\nand C-type neurons. These results were obtained by adjusting model parameters\ndetermining the maximal ion-channel conductances. The observed variation in the\nmodel parameters are hypothesized to correspond to physiological differences\nbetween A- and C-type neurons. In agreement with published experimental\nobservations, our simulations suggest that a twofold lower potassium\nconductance in C-type neurons is responsible for the observed sustained basal\nfiring, whereas a tenfold higher mechanosensitive conductance is responsible\nfor the greater firing rate observed in A-type neurons. A better understanding\nof the difference between the two neuron types can potentially be used to gain\nmore insight into the underlying pathophysiology facilitating development of\ntargeted interventions improving baroreflex function in diseased individuals,\ne.g. in patients with autonomic failure, a syndrome that is difficult to\ndiagnose in terms of its pathophysiology.\n","Comment: Keywords: Baroreflex model, mechanosensitivity, A- and C-type\n  afferent baroreceptors, biophysical model, computational model"]}]

However, some pressing challenges in\nstate-of-the-art quantum annealers have to be overcome before we can assess\ntheir actual performance. Most notably, the effective temperature at which\nsamples are generated is instance-dependent and unknown, the interaction graph\nis sparse, the parameters are noisy, and the dynamic range of the parameters is\nfinite. Of all these limitations, the sparse connectivity resulting from the\nlocal interaction between quantum bits in physical hardware implementations, is\nconsidered the most severe limitation to the quality of constructing powerful\nmachine learning models. Here we show how to surpass this \"curse of limited\nconnectivity\" bottleneck and illustrate our findings by training probabilistic\ngenerative models with arbitrary pairwise connectivity. Our model can be\ntrained in quantum hardware without full knowledge of the effective parameters\nspecifying the corresponding Boltzmann-like distribution. Therefore, inference\nof the effective temperature is avoided and the effect of noise in the\nparameters is mitigated.
