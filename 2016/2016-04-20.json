One of the\nchallenges in designing such a system is the local scale differences of objects\nappearing in the two images. Previous methods often considered only small\nsubsets of image pixels; matching only pixels for which stable scales may be\nreliably estimated. More recently, others have considered dense\ncorrespondences, but with substantial costs associated with generating, storing\nand matching scale invariant descriptors. Our work here is motivated by the\nobservation that pixels in the image have contexts -- the pixels around them --\nwhich may be exploited in order to estimate local scales reliably and\nrepeatably. Specifically, we make the following contributions. (i) We show that\nscales estimated in sparse interest points may be propagated to neighboring\npixels where this information cannot be reliably determined. Doing so allows\nscale invariant descriptors to be extracted anywhere in the image, not just in\ndetected interest points. (ii) We present three different means for propagating\nthis information: using only the scales at detected interest points, using the\nunderlying image information to guide the propagation of this information\nacross each image, separately, and using both images simultaneously. Finally,\n(iii), we provide extensive results, both qualitative and quantitative,\ndemonstrating that accurate dense correspondences can be obtained even between\nvery different images, with little computational costs beyond those required by\nexisting methods.\n","Comment: A longer version of this paper is in submission.

Different parametric\nand nonparametric models have been considered to address hyperspectral unmixing\nproblems. The simplest one is the linear mixing model.

The key ingredient allowing the driver to guide\nthe evader is that the driver is able to display a circumvention maneuver\naround the evader, in such a way that the trajectory of the evader is modified\nin the direction of the repulsion that the driver exerts on the evader. The\nevader can thus be driven towards any given target or along a sufficiently\nsmooth path by controlling a single discrete parameter acting on driver's\nbehavior. The control parameter serves both to activate/deactivate the\ncircumvention mode and to select the clockwise/counterclockwise direction of\nthe circumvention maneuver.

Their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) show an\nemission excess between 15-40{\\mu}m, but very weak (HD 100453) and no (HD\n34282) signs of the 10 and 20 {\\mu}m amorphous silicate features. We\ninvestigate whether this implies the presence of large dust gaps. In this work,\nspatially resolved mid-infrared Q-band images taken with Gemini North/MICHELLE\nare investigated. We perform radiative transfer modeling and examine the radial\ndistribution of dust. We simultaneously fit the Q-band images and SEDs of HD\n100453 and HD 34282. Our solutions require that the inner-halos and outer-disks\nare likely separated by large dust gaps that are depleted wih respect to the\nouter disk by a factor of 1000 or more. The inner edges of the outer disks of\nHD 100453 and HD 34282 have temperatures of about $160 \\pm 10$ K and $60 \\pm 5$\nK respectively. Because of the high surface brightnesses of these walls, they\ndominate the emission in the Q-band. Their radii are constrained at 20+2 AU and\n92+31 AU, respectively. We conclude that, HD 100453 and HD 34282 likely have\ndisk dust gaps and the upper limit on the dust mass in each gap is estimated to\nbe about $10^{-7}$M$_{\\odot}$. We find that the locations and sizes of disk\ndust gaps are connected to the SED, as traced by the mid-infrared flux ratio\nF30/F13.5. We propose a new classification scheme for the Meeus groups (Meeus\net al. 2001) based on the F30/F13.5 ratio. The absence of amorphous silicate\nfeatures in the observed SEDs is caused by the depletion of small (smaller than\n1 {\\mu}m) silicate dust at temperatures above 160 K, which could be related to\nthe presence of a dust gap in that region of the disk.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 13 Figures, Accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

In addition, several\naspects of the design of efficient crowdsourcing processes, such as defining\nworker's bonuses, fair prices and time limits of the tasks, involve knowledge\nof the likely duration of the task at hand. Bringing this together, in this\nwork we introduce a new time--sensitive Bayesian aggregation method that\nsimultaneously estimates a task's duration and obtains reliable aggregations of\ncrowdsourced judgments. Our method, called BCCTime, builds on the key insight\nthat the time taken by a worker to perform a task is an important indicator of\nthe likely quality of the produced judgment. To capture this, BCCTime uses\nlatent variables to represent the uncertainty about the workers' completion\ntime, the tasks' duration and the workers' accuracy. To relate the quality of a\njudgment to the time a worker spends on a task, our model assumes that each\ntask is completed within a latent time window within which all workers with a\npropensity to genuinely attempt the labelling task (i.e., no spammers) are\nexpected to submit their judgments. In contrast, workers with a lower\npropensity to valid labeling, such as spammers, bots or lazy labelers, are\nassumed to perform tasks considerably faster or slower than the time required\nby normal workers. Specifically, we use efficient message-passing Bayesian\ninference to learn approximate posterior probabilities of (i) the confusion\nmatrix of each worker, (ii) the propensity to valid labeling of each worker,\n(iii) the unbiased duration of each task and (iv) the true label of each task.\nUsing two real-world public datasets for entity linking tasks, we show that\nBCCTime produces up to 11% more accurate classifications and up to 100% more\ninformative estimates of a task's duration compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods.\n"]}]

Information measures---specifically, divergences in the mutual\ninformation between a process' past and future (excess entropy) and minimal\npredictive memory stored in a process' causal states (statistical\ncomplexity)---provide a different way to identify long memory in processes with\nhigher-order temporal correlations. However, there are no ergodic stationary\nprocesses with infinite excess entropy for which information measures have been\ncompared to autocorrelation functions and Hurst exponents. Here, we show that\nfractal renewal processes---those with interevent distribution tails $\\propto\nt^{-\\alpha}$---exhibit long memory via a phase transition at $\\alpha = 1$.\nExcess entropy diverges only there and statistical complexity diverges there\nand for all $\\alpha < 1$. When these processes do have power-law\nautocorrelation function and Hurst exponent greater than $1/2$, they do not\nhave divergent excess entropy. This analysis breaks the intuitive association\nbetween these different quantifications of memory. We hope that the methods\nused here, based on causal states, provide some guide as to how to construct\nand analyze other long memory processes.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 2 figures, 3 appendixes;\n  http://csc.ucdavis.edu/~cmg/compmech/pubs/lrmrp.htm"]}]

We allow for two sources\nof noise: fluctuations in the control fields and those arising from the\nenvironment. We address the issue of error mitigation by means of a formulation\nrooted in the Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) approach to noisy, classical\nstatistical-mechanical systems. We express the noisy control problem in terms\nof a path integral, and integrate out the noise to arrive at an effective,\nnoise-free description. We characterize the degree of success in error\nmitigation via a fidelity, which characterizes the proximity of the\nsought-after evolution to ones achievable in the presence of noise. Error\nmitigation is then accomplished by applying the optimal control fields, i.e.,\nthose that maximize the fidelity subject to any constraints obeyed by the\ncontrol fields. To make connection with MSR, we reformulate the fidelity in\nterms of a Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) path integral, with the added twist that the\n`forward' and `backward' branches of the time-contour are inequivalent with\nrespect to the noise. The present approach naturally allows the incorporation\nof constraints on the control fields; a useful feature in practice, given that\nthey feature in real experiments. We illustrate this MSR-SK approach by\nconsidering a system consisting of a single spin $s$ freedom (with $s$\narbitrary), focusing on the case of $1/f$ noise. We discover that optimal\nerror-mitigation is accomplished via a universal control field protocol that is\nvalid for all $s$, from the qubit (i.e., $s=1/2$) case to the classical (i.e.,\n$s \\to \\infty$) limit. In principle, this MSR-SK approach provides a framework\nfor addressing quantum control in the presence of noise for systems of\narbitrary complexity.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 4 figures.

All-optical pulse compression of the broadband\nmicrowave signal is implemented after a subtraction between the detected probe\npulse with and without SBS. A proof-of-concept experiment is carried out. The\npulse compression of a linear frequency-modulated microwave signal with 1 GHz\nsweep range at the carrier frequency of 4.3 GHz is successfully realized, which\nwell matches the theoretical analysis.\n","Comment: 9 pages,5 figures"]}]

We also follow two types of\nevolution for the jet cocoons: being driven by the pressure inside the cocoon\n(Fanaroff-Riley [FR] I type), and being driven by the jet momentum (FR II\ntype). Our main result is that regardless of the assumed form of density\nprofiles, jets with observed powers of <~ 10^{44} erg s^{-1} are not powerful\nenough to evolve as FR II sources. Instead, they evolve as FR I sources and\nappear to be decelerated below the buoyant velocities of the cocoons when jets\nwere propagating through the central dense regions of the host galaxies. This\nexplains the reason why FR I sources are more frequent than FR II sources in\nclusters. Furthermore, we predict the sizes of X-ray cavities from the observed\njet powers and compare them with the observed ones --- they are consistent\nwithin a factor of two if the FR I type evolution is realized. Finally, we find\nthat the jets with a power >~ 10^{44} erg s^{-1} are less affected by the\nambient medium, and some of them, but not all, could serve as precursors of the\nFR II sources.\n","Comment: Replaced with published version"]}]

Meltwater tends to stabilize the ocean column, inducing amplifying\nfeedbacks that increase subsurface ocean warming and ice shelf melting. Cold\nmeltwater and induced dynamical effects cause ocean surface cooling in the\nSouthern Ocean and North Atlantic, thus increasing Earth's energy imbalance and\nheat flux into most of the global ocean's surface. Southern Ocean surface\ncooling, while lower latitudes are warming, increases precipitation on the\nSouthern Ocean, increasing ocean stratification, slowing deepwater formation,\nand increasing ice sheet mass loss. These feedbacks make ice sheets in contact\nwith the ocean vulnerable to accelerating disintegration. We hypothesize that\nice mass loss from the most vulnerable ice, sufficient to raise sea level\nseveral meters, is better approximated as exponential than by a more linear\nresponse. Doubling times of 10, 20 or 40 years yield multi-meter sea level rise\nin about 50, 100 or 200 years. Recent ice melt doubling times are near the\nlower end of the 10-40 year range, but the record is too short to confirm the\nnature of the response. The feedbacks, including subsurface ocean warming, help\nexplain paleoclimate data and point to a dominant Southern Ocean role in\ncontrolling atmospheric CO2, which in turn exercised tight control on global\ntemperature and sea level. The millennial (500-2000 year) time scale of deep\nocean ventilation affects the time scale for natural CO2 change and thus the\ntime scale for paleo global climate, ice sheet, and sea level changes, but this\npaleo millennial time scale should not be misinterpreted as the time scale for\nice sheet response to a rapid large human-made climate forcing.\n","Comment: 78 pages, 58 figures; submitted to Atmos.

For\nthe majority of SNRs, however, $R_{IRX,obs}$ values are either significantly\nsmaller or significantly larger than the theoretical ratios. The latter SNRs\nhave relatively low dust temperatures. We discuss how the natural and/or\nenvironmental properties of SNRs could have affected the IRX flux ratios and\nthe IRX morphology of these SNRs. We conclude that the SNRs with largest\n$R_{IRX,obs}$ are probably located in dense environment and that their IR\nemission is from dust heated by shock radiation rather than by collisions. Our\nresult suggests that the IRX flux ratio, together with dust temperature, can be\nused to infer the nature of unresolved SNRs in external galaxies.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 9 figures, Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical\n  Journal on February 11, 2016"]}]

Although the current luminosity of most\nembedded protostars would be too low to produce these complex species in hot\ncore regions that can be observable with current sub-millimetric\ninterferometers, previous luminosity outburst events would induce a formation\nof COMs in extended regions of protostellar envelopes with sizes increasing by\nup to one order of magnitude.\n","Comment: 12 pages and 7 figures.

Because the mass\nof ejecta from these channels could be quite different, their light curves are\nalso expected to be diverse. We evaluate the dynamic evolution of optical\ntransients powered by millisecond magnetars. We find that the magnetar with\nshort spin-down timescale converts its rotational energy mostly into the\nkinetic energy of the transient, while the energy of a magnetar with long\nspin-down timescale goes into radiation of the transient. This leads us to\nspeculate that hypernovae could be powered by magnetars with short spin-down\ntimescales.

For this, we performed optical spectroscopic observations\nof thirty objects in the field of view of PKS 1424+240 using the Gemini MOS.\nAfter analysing the data for groups, we evaluated the probability of finding\ngroups of galaxies by chance around the position of PKS 1424+240, using a deep\ncatalogue of groups. We also used photometric data from the SDSS catalogue to\nanalyse the red sequence of the proposed blazar host group. We found a new\ngroup of galaxies with eight members at z = 0.6010 +- 0.003, a virial radius of\nR_vir = 1.53 Mpc, and a velocity dispersion of sigma_v = 813 +- 187 km/s. The\nphotometric study indicates that more members are probably populating this\npreviously uncatalogued group of galaxies. The probability of PKS 1424+240\nbeing a member of this group was found to be 98%. The new group of galaxies\nfound at z = 0.6010 +- 0.003 is very likely hosting PKS 1424+240.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A. Second version: references added and\n  typo corrected"]}]

Using asteroseismic techniques, it has recently become possible to\nprobe the internal rotation profile of low-mass (~1.1-1.5 Msun) subgiant and\nred giant stars. Under the assumption of local angular momentum conservation,\nthe core contraction and envelope expansion occurring at the end of the main\nsequence would result in a much larger internal differential rotation than\nobserved. This suggests that angular momentum redistribution must be taking\nplace in the interior of these stars. Aims. We investigate the physical nature\nof the angular momentum redistribution mechanisms operating in stellar\ninteriors by constraining the efficiency of post-main sequence rotational\ncoupling. Methods. We model the rotational evolution of a 1.25 Msun star using\nthe Yale Rotational stellar Evolution Code. Our models take into account the\nmagnetic wind braking occurring at the surface of the star and the angular\nmomentum transport in the interior, with an efficiency dependent on the degree\nof internal differential rotation. Results. We find that models including a\ndependence of the angular momentum transport efficiency on the radial\nrotational shear reproduce very well the observations. The best fit of the data\nis obtained with an angular momentum transport coefficient scaling with the\nratio of the rotation rate of the radiative interior over that of the\nconvective envelope of the star as a power law of exponent ~3.

Our aim is\nto use asteroseismology to consistently measure the extent of convective cores\nin a sample of main-sequence stars whose masses lie around the mass-limit for\nhaving a convective core. We first test and validate a seismic diagnostic that\nwas proposed to probe in a model-dependent way the extent of convective cores\nusing the so-called $r_{010}$ ratios, which are built with $l=0$ and $l=1$\nmodes. We apply this procedure to 24 low-mass stars chosen among Kepler targets\nto optimize the efficiency of this diagnostic. For this purpose, we compute\ngrids of stellar models with both the CESAM2k and MESA evolution codes, where\nthe extensions of convective cores are modeled either by an instantaneous\nmixing or as a diffusion process. Among the selected targets, we are able to\nunambiguously detect convective cores in eight stars and we obtain seismic\nmeasurements of the extent of the mixed core in these targets with a good\nagreement between the CESAM2k and MESA codes. By performing optimizations using\nthe Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, we then obtain estimates of the amount of\nextra-mixing beyond the core that is required in CESAM2k to reproduce seismic\nobservations for these eight stars and we show that this can be used to propose\na calibration of this quantity.

It is therefore\nnatural to ask if the MRI itself could produce these structures without\ninvoking planets. The nonlinear evolution of the MRI is strongly affected by\nthe low ionisation fraction in protoplanetary disks. The Hall effect in\nparticular, which is dominant in dense and weakly ionised parts of these\nobjects, has been shown to spontaneously drive self- organising flows in\nshearing box simulations. Here, we investigate the behaviour of global\nMRI-unstable disc models dominated by the Hall effect and characterise their\ndynamics. We perform 3D unstratified Hall-MHD simulations of keplerian disks\nfor a broad range of Hall, ohmic and ambipolar Elsasser numbers. We confirm the\ntransition from a turbulent to an organised state as the intensity of the Hall\neffect is increased. We observe the formation of zonal flows, their number\ndepending on the available magnetic flux and on the intensity of the Hall\neffect. For intermediate Hall intensity, the flow self-organises into\nlong-lived magnetised vortices.

We\ncharacterise the individual PDS of GRBs in terms of a stochastic process, and\ncarry out for the first time a systematic search for periodic signals and for a\nlink between the PDS and other observables. We present a Bayesian procedure\nthat uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique and apply it to study 215 bright\nlong GRBs detected with the Swift Burst Alert Telescope from January 2005 to\nMay 2015. The PDS are modelled with a power-law either with or without a break.\nTwo classes of GRBs emerge: with or without a unique dominant timescale. A\ncomparison with active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reveals similar distributions of\nPDS slopes. Unexpectedly, GRBs with subsecond-dominant timescales and duration\nlonger than a few tens of seconds in the source frame appear to be either very\nrare or altogether absent. Three GRBs are found with possible evidence for a\nperiodic signal at ~3 sigma (Gaussian) significance, corresponding to a\nmultitrial chance probability of ~1%. Thus, we found no compelling evidence for\nperiodic signals. The analogy between the PDS of GRBs and of AGNs could\ntentatively indicate similar stochastic processes that rule BH accretion across\ndifferent BH mass scales and objects. In addition, we find evidence that short\ndominant timescales and duration are not completely independent of each other,\nin contrast with commonly accepted paradigms (abridged).\n","Comment: 15 pages, 16 figures, accepted by A&A"]}]

More specifically, we\npropose to approximate the Gaussian range kernel of the bilateral filter using\na Fourier basis, where the coefficients of the basis are obtained by solving a\nseries of least-squares problems. The coefficients can be efficiently computed\nusing a recursive form of the QR decomposition. By controlling the cardinality\nof the Fourier basis, we can obtain a good tradeoff between the run-time and\nthe filtering accuracy. In particular, we are able to guarantee sub-pixel\naccuracy for the overall filtering, which is not provided by most existing\nmethods for fast bilateral filtering. We present simulation results to\ndemonstrate the speed and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.\n","Comment: To appear in IEEE Signal Processing Letters (5 pages, 3 figures)"]}]

Our numerical simulations show that changes in magnifi- cations with\nsimilar time scales can be obtained for relativistically moving emission\nregions with sizes up to 0.01 pc in the case of microlensing on the cores of\nGCs or clumps in GMCs. From the density of such structures in spiral galaxies\nwe estimate however that lensing in giant molecular clouds would be more\ncommon.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

We conduct extensive\nexperiments on two typical segmentation tasks: named entity recognition (NER)\nand Chinese word segmentation (CWS).

In this paper we link FPT results to classic\nartificial intelligence techniques to show how they complement each other.\nSpecifically, we consider the workflow satisfiability problem (WSP) which asks\nwhether there exists an assignment of authorised users to the steps in a\nworkflow specification, subject to certain constraints on the assignment. It\nwas shown that WSP restricted to the class of user-independent constraints\n(UI), covering many practical cases, admits FPT algorithms.\n  We show that the FPT nature of WSP with UI constraints decomposes the problem\ninto two levels, and exploit this in a new FPT algorithm that is by many orders\nof magnitude faster then the previous state-of-the-art WSP algorithm.\n  The WSP with UI constraints can also be viewed as an extension of the\nhypergraph list colouring problem. Inspired by a classic graph colouring method\ncalled Zykov's Contraction, we designed a new pseudo-boolean (PB) formulation\nof WSP with UI constraints that also exploits the two-level split of the\nproblem. Our experiments showed that, in many cases, this formulation being\nsolved with a general purpose PB solver demonstrated performance comparable to\nthat of our bespoke FPT algorithm. This raises the potential of using general\npurpose solvers to tackle FPT problems efficiently.\n  We also study the practical, average-case, performance of various algorithms.\nTo support this we extend studies of phase transition phenomena in the\nunderstanding of the average computational effort needed to solve decision\nproblems. We investigate, for the first time, the phase transition properties\nof the WSP, under a model for generation of random instances, and note that the\nmethods of the phase transition study need to be adjusted to FPT problems.\n"]}]

The disordered many-particle problem is modeled by the quantum Coulomb\nglass which contains a random potential, long-range unscreened Coulomb\ninteractions and quantum hopping between different sites. We have recently\ndeveloped the Hartree-Fock based diagonalization (HFD) method which amounts to\ndiagonalizing the Hamiltonian in a suitably chosen energetically truncated\nbasis. This method allows us to investigate comparatively large systems. Here\nwe calculate the combined effect of disorder and interactions on the\ndissipative conductance. We find that the qualitative influence of the\ninteractions on the conductance depends on the relative disorder strength. For\nstrong disorder interactions can significantly enhance the transport while they\nsuppress the conductance for weak disorder.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 2 EPS figures included, presented at the 210.
