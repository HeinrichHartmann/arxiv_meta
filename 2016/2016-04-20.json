One of the\nchallenges in designing such a system is the local scale differences of objects\nappearing in the two images. Previous methods often considered only small\nsubsets of image pixels; matching only pixels for which stable scales may be\nreliably estimated. More recently, others have considered dense\ncorrespondences, but with substantial costs associated with generating, storing\nand matching scale invariant descriptors. Our work here is motivated by the\nobservation that pixels in the image have contexts -- the pixels around them --\nwhich may be exploited in order to estimate local scales reliably and\nrepeatably. Specifically, we make the following contributions. (i) We show that\nscales estimated in sparse interest points may be propagated to neighboring\npixels where this information cannot be reliably determined. Doing so allows\nscale invariant descriptors to be extracted anywhere in the image, not just in\ndetected interest points. (ii) We present three different means for propagating\nthis information: using only the scales at detected interest points, using the\nunderlying image information to guide the propagation of this information\nacross each image, separately, and using both images simultaneously. Finally,\n(iii), we provide extensive results, both qualitative and quantitative,\ndemonstrating that accurate dense correspondences can be obtained even between\nvery different images, with little computational costs beyond those required by\nexisting methods.\n","Comment: A longer version of this paper is in submission.

Different parametric\nand nonparametric models have been considered to address hyperspectral unmixing\nproblems. The simplest one is the linear mixing model.

For a fixed total\nbinary mass a tight relation between the dominant postmerger frequency and the\nradii of nonrotating neutron stars exists.

The key ingredient allowing the driver to guide\nthe evader is that the driver is able to display a circumvention maneuver\naround the evader, in such a way that the trajectory of the evader is modified\nin the direction of the repulsion that the driver exerts on the evader. The\nevader can thus be driven towards any given target or along a sufficiently\nsmooth path by controlling a single discrete parameter acting on driver's\nbehavior.

The problem reduces to finding a test space (a reduced\ndimensional space for this auxiliary variable), which guarantees that the error\nin the primal variable (representing the solution) is close to the projection\nerror of the full solution on the reduced dimensional space that approximates\nthe solution. To find the test space, we reformulate some recent mixed\nGeneralized Multiscale Finite Element Methods. We introduce snapshots and local\nspectral problems that appropriately define local weight and trial spaces. In\nparticular, we use energy minimizing snapshots and local spectral\ndecompositions in the natural norm associated with the auxiliary variable. The\nresulting spectral decomposition adaptively identifies and builds the optimal\nmultiscale space to stabilize the system. We discuss the stability and its\nrelation to the approximation property of the test space. We design online\nbasis functions, which accelerate convergence in the test space, and\nconsequently, improve stability. We present several numerical examples and show\nthat one needs a few test functions to achieve an error similar to the\nprojection error in the primal variable irrespective of the Peclet number.\n"]}]

As a result of using a\ncalibrated central engine, the final kinetic energy of the supernova is\nvariable and sensitive to the structure of the presupernova star. Many\nprogenitors with extended core structures do not explode, but become black\nholes, and the masses of exploding stars do not form a simply connected set.\nThe resulting nucleosynthesis agrees reasonably well with the sun provided that\na reasonable contribution from Type Ia supernovae is also allowed, but with a\ndeficiency of light s-process isotopes. The resulting neutron star IMF has a\nmean gravitational mass near 1.4 solar masses. The average black hole mass is\nabout 9 solar masses if only the helium core implodes, and 14 solar masses if\nthe entire presupernova star collapses. Only ~10% of supernovae come from stars\nover 20 solar masses and some of these are Type Ib or Ic. Some useful\nsystematics of Type IIp light curves are explored.\n","Comment: 49 pages, 39 figures and 9 tables. Accepted to The Astrophysical\n  Journal 26/1/2016"]}]

In addition, several\naspects of the design of efficient crowdsourcing processes, such as defining\nworker's bonuses, fair prices and time limits of the tasks, involve knowledge\nof the likely duration of the task at hand. Bringing this together, in this\nwork we introduce a new time--sensitive Bayesian aggregation method that\nsimultaneously estimates a task's duration and obtains reliable aggregations of\ncrowdsourced judgments. Our method, called BCCTime, builds on the key insight\nthat the time taken by a worker to perform a task is an important indicator of\nthe likely quality of the produced judgment. To capture this, BCCTime uses\nlatent variables to represent the uncertainty about the workers' completion\ntime, the tasks' duration and the workers' accuracy. To relate the quality of a\njudgment to the time a worker spends on a task, our model assumes that each\ntask is completed within a latent time window within which all workers with a\npropensity to genuinely attempt the labelling task (i.e., no spammers) are\nexpected to submit their judgments. In contrast, workers with a lower\npropensity to valid labeling, such as spammers, bots or lazy labelers, are\nassumed to perform tasks considerably faster or slower than the time required\nby normal workers. Specifically, we use efficient message-passing Bayesian\ninference to learn approximate posterior probabilities of (i) the confusion\nmatrix of each worker, (ii) the propensity to valid labeling of each worker,\n(iii) the unbiased duration of each task and (iv) the true label of each task.\nUsing two real-world public datasets for entity linking tasks, we show that\nBCCTime produces up to 11% more accurate classifications and up to 100% more\ninformative estimates of a task's duration compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods.\n"]}]

We allow for two sources\nof noise: fluctuations in the control fields and those arising from the\nenvironment. We address the issue of error mitigation by means of a formulation\nrooted in the Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) approach to noisy, classical\nstatistical-mechanical systems. We express the noisy control problem in terms\nof a path integral, and integrate out the noise to arrive at an effective,\nnoise-free description. We characterize the degree of success in error\nmitigation via a fidelity, which characterizes the proximity of the\nsought-after evolution to ones achievable in the presence of noise. Error\nmitigation is then accomplished by applying the optimal control fields, i.e.,\nthose that maximize the fidelity subject to any constraints obeyed by the\ncontrol fields. To make connection with MSR, we reformulate the fidelity in\nterms of a Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) path integral, with the added twist that the\n`forward' and `backward' branches of the time-contour are inequivalent with\nrespect to the noise. The present approach naturally allows the incorporation\nof constraints on the control fields; a useful feature in practice, given that\nthey feature in real experiments. We illustrate this MSR-SK approach by\nconsidering a system consisting of a single spin $s$ freedom (with $s$\narbitrary), focusing on the case of $1/f$ noise. We discover that optimal\nerror-mitigation is accomplished via a universal control field protocol that is\nvalid for all $s$, from the qubit (i.e., $s=1/2$) case to the classical (i.e.,\n$s \\to \\infty$) limit. In principle, this MSR-SK approach provides a framework\nfor addressing quantum control in the presence of noise for systems of\narbitrary complexity.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 4 figures.

They evolve with decreasing temperature, however always symmetric about\na geometric axis of the square unit cell.

We strongly disagree with this conclusion and we critically analyze some\ninfluential finite sample proofs of various inequalities and so called quantum\nRandi challenges. We also show how one can win so called Bell game.The\nviolation of inequalities does not prove that local and causal explanation of\ncorrelations is impossible. The violation of inequalities gives only a strong\nargument against counterfactual definiteness and against a point of view\naccording to which experimental outcomes are produced in irreducible random\nway. We also explain the meaning of sample homogeneity loophole and show how it\ncan invalidate statistical significance tests. We point out that this loophole\nwas not closed in several recent experiments testing local realism.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 72 references"]}]

Because the mass\nof ejecta from these channels could be quite different, their light curves are\nalso expected to be diverse. We evaluate the dynamic evolution of optical\ntransients powered by millisecond magnetars. We find that the magnetar with\nshort spin-down timescale converts its rotational energy mostly into the\nkinetic energy of the transient, while the energy of a magnetar with long\nspin-down timescale goes into radiation of the transient. This leads us to\nspeculate that hypernovae could be powered by magnetars with short spin-down\ntimescales. At late times the optical transients will gradually evolve into a\nnebular phase because of the photospheric recession. We treat the photosphere\nand nebula separately because their radiation mechanisms are different. In some\ncases the ejecta could be light enough that the magnetar can accelerate it to a\nrelativistic speed. It is well known that the peak luminosity of a supernova\n(SN) occurs when the luminosity is equal to the instantaneous energy input\nrate, as shown by Arnett (1979). We show that photospheric recession and\nrelativistic motion can modify this law.

Using asteroseismic techniques, it has recently become possible to\nprobe the internal rotation profile of low-mass (~1.1-1.5 Msun) subgiant and\nred giant stars. Under the assumption of local angular momentum conservation,\nthe core contraction and envelope expansion occurring at the end of the main\nsequence would result in a much larger internal differential rotation than\nobserved. This suggests that angular momentum redistribution must be taking\nplace in the interior of these stars. Aims. We investigate the physical nature\nof the angular momentum redistribution mechanisms operating in stellar\ninteriors by constraining the efficiency of post-main sequence rotational\ncoupling. Methods. We model the rotational evolution of a 1.25 Msun star using\nthe Yale Rotational stellar Evolution Code. Our models take into account the\nmagnetic wind braking occurring at the surface of the star and the angular\nmomentum transport in the interior, with an efficiency dependent on the degree\nof internal differential rotation. Results. We find that models including a\ndependence of the angular momentum transport efficiency on the radial\nrotational shear reproduce very well the observations. The best fit of the data\nis obtained with an angular momentum transport coefficient scaling with the\nratio of the rotation rate of the radiative interior over that of the\nconvective envelope of the star as a power law of exponent ~3.

Our aim is\nto use asteroseismology to consistently measure the extent of convective cores\nin a sample of main-sequence stars whose masses lie around the mass-limit for\nhaving a convective core. We first test and validate a seismic diagnostic that\nwas proposed to probe in a model-dependent way the extent of convective cores\nusing the so-called $r_{010}$ ratios, which are built with $l=0$ and $l=1$\nmodes. We apply this procedure to 24 low-mass stars chosen among Kepler targets\nto optimize the efficiency of this diagnostic. For this purpose, we compute\ngrids of stellar models with both the CESAM2k and MESA evolution codes, where\nthe extensions of convective cores are modeled either by an instantaneous\nmixing or as a diffusion process. Among the selected targets, we are able to\nunambiguously detect convective cores in eight stars and we obtain seismic\nmeasurements of the extent of the mixed core in these targets with a good\nagreement between the CESAM2k and MESA codes. By performing optimizations using\nthe Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, we then obtain estimates of the amount of\nextra-mixing beyond the core that is required in CESAM2k to reproduce seismic\nobservations for these eight stars and we show that this can be used to propose\na calibration of this quantity. This calibration depends on the prescription\nchosen for the extra-mixing, but we find that it should be valid also for the\ncode MESA, provided the same prescription is used. This study constitutes a\nfirst step towards the calibration of the extension of convective cores in\nlow-mass stars, which will help reduce the uncertainties on the ages of these\nstars.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 15 figures, accepted in A&A"]}]

These structures are often interpreted as the result of\nplanet-disc interactions. However, these disks are also known to be unstable to\nthe magneto-rotational instability (MRI) which is believed to be one of the\ndominant angular momentum transport mechanism in these objects. It is therefore\nnatural to ask if the MRI itself could produce these structures without\ninvoking planets. The nonlinear evolution of the MRI is strongly affected by\nthe low ionisation fraction in protoplanetary disks. The Hall effect in\nparticular, which is dominant in dense and weakly ionised parts of these\nobjects, has been shown to spontaneously drive self- organising flows in\nshearing box simulations. Here, we investigate the behaviour of global\nMRI-unstable disc models dominated by the Hall effect and characterise their\ndynamics. We perform 3D unstratified Hall-MHD simulations of keplerian disks\nfor a broad range of Hall, ohmic and ambipolar Elsasser numbers. We confirm the\ntransition from a turbulent to an organised state as the intensity of the Hall\neffect is increased. We observe the formation of zonal flows, their number\ndepending on the available magnetic flux and on the intensity of the Hall\neffect. For intermediate Hall intensity, the flow self-organises into\nlong-lived magnetised vortices.

It can be treated as thermal Comptonization by solving the\nKompaneets equation with an equivalent \"wave\" temperature, which is a weighted\nsum over the power present at each scale in the turbulent cascade. Bulk\nComptonization by turbulence with non-zero divergence is due to both pressure\nwork and radiation viscous dissipation. Pressure work has negligible effect on\nphoton spectra in the limit of optically thin turbulence, and in this limit\nradiation viscous dissipation alone can be treated as thermal Comptonization\nwith a temperature equivalent to the full turbulent power. In the limit of\nextremely optically thick turbulence, radiation viscous dissipation is\nsuppressed, and the evolution of local photon spectra can be understood in\nterms of compression and expansion of the strongly coupled photon and gas\nfluids. We discuss the consequences of these effects for self-consistently\nresolving and interpreting turbulent Comptonization in spectral calculations in\nradiation MHD simulations of high luminosity accretion flows.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS, corrected typos"]}]

The northern loop system brightens following the initiation\nof the flare within the southern loop system, but all three cusp-shaped\nstructures are characterized by ~ 10 MK temperatures, hotter than the\narch-shaped loops underneath. The \"Ahead\" satellite of the Solar Terrestrial\nRelations Observatory (STEREO) provides a top view, in which the post-flare\nloops brighten sequentially, with one end fixed while the other apparently\nslipping eastward. By performing stereoscopic reconstruction of the post-flare\nloops in EUV and mapping out magnetic connectivities, we found that the\nfootpoints of the post-flare loops are slipping along the footprint of a\nhyperbolic flux tube (HFT) separating the two loop systems, and that the\nreconstructed loops share similarity with the magnetic field lines that are\ntraced starting from the same HFT footprint, where the field lines are\nrelatively flexible. These results argue strongly in favor of slipping magnetic\nreconnection at the HFT. The slipping reconnection was likely triggered by the\nflare and manifested as propagative dimmings before the loop slippage is\nobserved. It may contribute to the late-phase peak in Fe XVI 33.5 nm, which is\neven higher than its main-phase counterpart, and may also play a role in the\ndensity and temperature asymmetry observed in the northern loop system through\nheat conduction.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ Letters"]}]

In this paper we extend the Harper Identity from\nsingle-step change to define iterated contraction in terms of iterated\nrevision. Specifically, just as the Harper Identity provides a recipe for\ndefining the belief set resulting from contracting A in terms of (i) the\ninitial belief set and (ii) the belief set resulting from revision by not-A, we\nlook at ways to define the plausibility ordering over worlds resulting from\ncontracting A in terms of (iii) the initial plausibility ordering, and (iv) the\nplausibility ordering resulting from revision by not-A. After noting that the\nmost straightforward such extension leads to a trivialisation of the space of\npermissible orderings, we provide a family of operators for combining\nplausibility orderings that avoid such a result. These operators are\ncharacterised in our domain of interest by a pair of intuitively compelling\nproperties, which turn out to enable the derivation of a number of iterated\ncontraction postulates from postulates for iterated revision.

If multiple advertisers\nin an ad network are interested in the ad slots of the same auction, the ad\nnetwork might use a \"local\" auction to resell the obtained ad slots among its\nadvertisers.\n  In this work we want to deepen the theoretical understanding of these new\nmarkets by analyzing them from the viewpoint of combinatorial auctions. Prior\nwork studied mostly single-item auctions, while we allow the advertisers to\nexpress richer preferences over multiple items. We develop a game-theoretic\nmodel for the entanglement of the central auction at the ad exchange with the\nlocal auctions at the ad networks. We consider the incentives of all three\ninvolved parties and suggest a three-party competitive equilibrium, an\nextension of the Walrasian equilibrium that ensures envy-freeness for all\nparticipants. We show the existence of a three-party competitive equilibrium\nand a polynomial-time algorithm to find one for gross-substitute bidder\nvaluations.\n"]}]

This leads to an online revenue maximization problem for the\npublisher. Given a new impression to sell decide whether (a) to assign it to a\ncontracted advertiser and if so to which one or (b) to sell it at the ad\nexchange and if so at which reserve price. We make no assumptions about the\ndistribution of the advertiser valuations that participate in the ad exchange\nand show that there exists a simple primal-dual based online algorithm, whose\nlower bound for the revenue converges to $R_{ADX} + R_A (1 - 1/e)$, where\n$R_{ADX}$ is the revenue that the optimum algorithm achieves from the ad\nexchange and $R_A$ is the revenue that the optimum algorithm achieves from the\ncontracted advertisers.\n"]}]
