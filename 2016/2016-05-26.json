For a heterodimer representing the two coupled BChls 3 and 4 of\nthe FMO complex, the initial amplitude of the vibronic-exciton and vibrational\ncoherences are enhanced by up to 15 and 5 times, respectively, compared to the\nvibrational coherences in the isolated monomer. This maximum initial amplitude\nenhancement occurs when there is a resonance between the electronic energy gap\nand the frequency of the vibrational mode. The bandwidth of this enhancement is\nabout 100 cm-1 for both mechanisms. The excitonic mixing of electronic and\nvibrational DOF leads to additional dephasing relative to the vibrational\ncoherences. We evaluate the dephasing dynamics by solving the quantum master\nequation in Markovian approximation and observe a strong dependence of the\nlife-time enhancement on the mode frequency. Long-lived vibronic-exciton\ncoherences are found to be generated only when the frequency of the mode is in\nthe vicinity of the electronic resonance. Although the vibronic-exciton\ncoherences exhibit a larger initial amplitude compared to the ground-state\nvibrational coherences, we conclude that both type have a similar magnitude at\nlong time for the present model.

Here we numerically investigate the generation of superhalo\nelectrons by magnetic reconnection in the solar wind source region, using the\nMHD and test particle simulations for both single X-line reconnection and\nmultiple X-line reconnection. We find that the direct current electric field,\nproduced in the magnetic reconnection region, can accelerate electrons from an\ninitial thermal energy of T $\\sim10^5$ K up to hundreds of keV. After\nacceleration, some of the accelerated electrons, together with the nascent\nsolar wind flow driven by the reconnection, propagate upwards along the\nnewly-opened magnetic field lines into the interplanetary space, while the rest\nmove downwards into the lower atmosphere. Similar to the observed superhalo\nelectrons at 1 AU, the flux of the upward-traveling accelerated electrons\nversus energy displays a power-law distribution at $\\sim$ 2 $-$ 100 keV, $f(E)\n\\sim E^{-\\delta}$, with a $\\delta$ of $\\sim$ 1.5 $-$ 2.4. For single (multiple)\nX-line reconnection, the spectrum becomes harder (softer) as the anomalous\nresistivity parameter $\\alpha$ (uniform resistivity $\\eta$) increases. These\nmodeling results suggest that the acceleration in the solar wind source region\nmay contribute to superhalo electrons.\n"]}]

This approach leads to a computationally efficient\nstrategy for estimating the precision matrix that starts by estimating the\nregression vectors, then estimates the diagonal entries of the precision matrix\nand, in a final step, combines these estimators for getting estimators of the\noff-diagonal entries. While the step of estimating the regression vector has\nbeen intensively studied over the past decade, the problem of deriving\nstatistically accurate estimators of the diagonal entries has received much\nless attention. The goal of the present paper is to fill this gap by presenting\nfour estimators---that seem the most natural ones---of the diagonal entries of\nthe precision matrix and then performing a comprehensive empirical evaluation\nof these estimators. The estimators under consideration are the residual\nvariance, the relaxed maximum likelihood, the symmetry-enforced maximum\nlikelihood and the penalized maximum likelihood. We show, both theoretically\nand empirically, that when the aforementioned regression vectors are estimated\nwithout error, the symmetry-enforced maximum likelihood estimator has the\nsmallest estimation error. However, in a more realistic setting when the\nregression vector is estimated by a sparsity-favoring computationally efficient\nmethod, the qualities of the estimators become relatively comparable with a\nslight advantage for the residual variance estimator.\n","Comment: Companion R package at\n  http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DESP/index.html"]}]

The multiple\nnetwork layers give rise to nonlinear effect for the emergent dynamics of\nsystems. Especially, weak layers that can potentially play significant role in\namplifying the vulnerability of multiplex networks might be shadowed in the\naggregated single-layer network framework which indiscriminately accumulates\nall layers. Here we present a simple model of cascading failure on multiplex\nnetworks of weight-heterogeneous layers. By simulating the model on the\nmultiplex network of international trades, we found that the multiplex model\nproduces more catastrophic cascading failures which are the result of emergent\ncollective effect of coupling layers, rather than the simple sum thereof.\nTherefore risks can be systematically underestimated in single-layer network\nanalyses because the impact of weak layers can be overlooked. We anticipate\nthat our simple theoretical study can contribute to further investigation and\ndesign of optimal risk-averse real-world complex systems.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 5 figures"]}]

In this paper we present an algorithm capable of learning\npurposeful behaviour in the absence of rewards. The algorithm proceeds by\nconstructing temporally extended actions (options), through the identification\nof purposes that are \"just out of reach\" of the agent's current behaviour.\nThese purposes establish intrinsic goals for the agent to learn, ultimately\nresulting in a suite of behaviours that encourage the agent to visit different\nparts of the state space. Moreover, the approach is particularly suited for\nsettings where rewards are very sparse, and such behaviours can help in the\nexploration of the environment until reward is observed.\n","Comment: Extended version of the paper presented at the workshop entitled\n  Abstraction in Reinforcement Learning, at the 33rd International Conference\n  on Machine Learning, New York, NY, USA, 2016"]}]

The nature of the spatial distribution of local magnetic\nfield and shielding currents across the array reveals the presence of a\nnon-uniform vortex configuration partially matched with the blind holes at\nsub-matching fields. We observe that the filling fraction is different in two\ndifferent regions of the array.

The patchy nature of the vortex configuration is more\npronounced at partial filling of the array at low fields while the\nconfiguration becomes more uniform with a unique filling fraction at higher\nfields. The metastable nature of this patchy vortex configuration is revealed\nby the application of magnetic field pulses of fixed height or individual\npulses of varying height to the array. The metastability of the vortex\nconfiguration allows for a relatively easy way of producing flux reorganization\nand flux focusing effects within the blind hole array. Effect of the magnetic\nfield pulses modifies the vortex configuration within the array and produces a\nuniform enhancement in the shielding current around the patterned array edges.\nThe enhanced shielding current concentrates magnetic flux within the array by\ndriving vortices away from the edges and towards the center of the array.
