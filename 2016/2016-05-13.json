We focus on a usual type of interest-driven social sessions in OSNs,\ncalled \\emph{Social-InterestCast}, under which a user will autonomously\ndetermine whether to view the content from his followees depending on his\ninterest. It is challenging to figure out the formation mechanism of such a\nSocial-InterestCast, since it involves multiple interrelated factors such as\nusers' social relationships, users' interests, and content semantics. We\npropose a four-layered system model, consisting of physical layer, social\nlayer, content layer, and session layer. By this model we successfully obtain\nthe geographical distribution of Social-InterestCast sessions, serving as the\nprecondition for quantifying data transport difficulty. We define the\nfundamental limit of \\emph{transport load} as a new metric, called\n\\emph{transport complexity}, i.e., the \\emph{minimum required} transport load\nfor an OSN over a given carrier network. Specifically, we derive the transport\ncomplexity for Social-InterestCast sessions in a large-scale OSN over the\ncarrier network with optimal communication architecture. The results can act as\nthe common lower bounds on transport load for Social-InterestCast over any\ncarrier networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to\nmeasure the transport difficulty for data dissemination in OSNs by modeling\nsession patterns with the interest-driven characteristics.\n"]}]

Since October 2012 Tunka-Rex measures the radio\nsignal of air-showers in coincidence with the non-imaging air-Cherenkov array\nTunka-133. Furthermore, this year additional antennas will go into operation\ntriggered by the new scintillator array Tunka-Grande measuring the secondary\nelectrons and muons of air showers. Tunka-Rex is a demonstrator for how\neconomic an antenna array can be without losing significant performance: we\nhave decided for simple and robust SALLA antennas, and we share the existing\nDAQ running in slave mode with the PMT detectors and the scintillators,\nrespectively. This means that Tunka-Rex is triggered externally, and does not\nneed its own infrastructure and DAQ for hybrid measurements. By this, the\nperformance and the added value of the supplementary radio measurements can be\nstudied, in particular, the precision for the reconstructed energy and the\nshower maximum in the energy range of approximately $10^{17}-10^{18}\\,$eV.

A larger column density in the condensations, or equivalently a\nstronger absorption in the chromospheric lines, is obtained when the\nevaporation rate of the planet is larger, which occurs for a lower gravity of\nthe planet.

Modelling\nsynthesises tissue in some regions and removes tissue in others. Remodelling\noverwrites old tissue material properties with newly formed, immature tissue\nproperties. As a result, tissues are made up of different \"patches\", i.e.,\nadjacent tissue regions of different ages and different material properties,\nwithin evolving boundaries. In this paper, generalised equations governing the\nspatio-temporal evolution of such tissues are developed within the continuum\nmodel. These equations take into account nonconservative, discontinuous surface\nmass balance due to creation and destruction of material at moving interfaces,\nand bulk balance due to tissue maturation. These equations make it possible to\nmodel patchy tissue states and their evolution without explicitly maintaining a\nrecord of when/where resorption and formation processes occurred. The time\nevolution of spatially averaged tissue properties is derived systematically by\nintegration. These spatially-averaged equations cannot be written in closed\nform as they retain traces that tissue destruction is localised at tissue\nboundaries.\n  The formalism developed in this paper is applied to bone tissues, which\nexhibit strong material heterogeneities due to their slow mineralisation and\nremodelling processes.

It is\nrevealed that with the singlet order parameter induced from the superconducting\nproximity effect, in quantum wells, not only can the triplet pairings arise due\nto the spin-orbit coupling, but also the triplet order parameter can be induced\ndue to the repulsive effective electron-electron interaction, including the\nelectron-electron Coulomb and electron-phonon interactions. This is a natural\nextension of the work of de Gennes, in which the repulsive-interaction-induced\nsinglet order parameter arises in the normal metal in proximity to $s$-wave\nsuperconductor [Rev. Mod. Phys. {\\bf 36}, 225 (1964)]. Specifically, we derive\nthe effective Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation, in which the self-energies due to\nthe effective electron-electron interactions contribute to the singlet and\ntriplet order parameters. It is further shown that for the singlet order\nparameter, it is efficiently suppressed due to this self-energy\nrenormalization; whereas for the triplet order parameter, it is the $p$-wave\n($p_x\\pm ip_y$) one with the ${\\bf d}$-vector parallel to the effective\nmagnetic field due to the spin-orbit coupling. Finally, we perform the\nnumerical calculation in InSb (100) quantum wells. Specifically, we reveal that\nthe Coulomb interaction is much more important than the electron-phonon\ninteraction at low temperature. Moreover, it shows that with proper electron\ndensity, the minimum of the renormalized singlet and the maximum of the induced\ntriplet order parameters are comparable, and hence can be experimentally\ndistinguished.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 8 figures, PRB in press"]}]

We show that the diffusion is not described by the SIR model, but\nrather by a novel model, the Bass-SIR model, which combines the Bass model for\ndiffusion of new products with the SIR model for epidemics. The phase\ntransition of consumers from non-adopters to adopters is described by a\nnon-standard Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami model, in which clusters growth is\nlimited by adopters' recovery. Therefore, diffusion in the Bass-SIR model only\ndepends on the local structure of the social network, but not on the average\ndistance between consumers. Consequently, unlike the SIR model, a small-worlds\nstructure has a negligible effect on the diffusion. Surprisingly, diffusion on\nscale-free networks is nearly identical to that on Cartesian ones.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 5 figures"]}]

Remarkably, the phenomenon involves a balance\nbetween sound attenuation and shear, such that viscosity vanishes in the final\nexpression of the velocity field. For this reason, the effect of viscosity has\nlong been ignored in acoustic streaming experiments. Here, we show\nexperimentally that the viscosity plays a major role in cavities such as the\nstreaming induced by surface acoustic waves in sessile droplets. We develop a\nnumerical model based on the spatial filtering of the streaming source term to\ncompute the induced flow motion with dramatically reduced computational\nrequirements. We evidence that acoustic fields in droplets are a superposition\nof a chaotic field and a few powerful caustics. It appears that the caustics\ndrive the flow, which allows a qualitative prediction of the flow structure.\nFinally, we reduce the problem to two dimensionless numbers related to the\nsurface and bulk waves attenuation and simulate hemispherical sessile droplets\nresting on a lithium niobate substrate for a range of parameters. Even in such\na baseline configuration, we observe at least four distinct flow regimes. For\neach of them, we establish a correlation of the average streaming speed in the\ndroplet, which is increasingly dependent on the bulk wave attenuation as the\nviscosity increases.

We can also\nexpress it as a matrix product state. We further construct the model of\ninteracting spins 3/2 and greater half-integer spins. The models with higher\nspins require coloring of Dyck walks. We construct SU(k) symmetric model [here\nk is the number of colors].

ACM 2015] who showed any\nrational set similarity $S$ admits a locality sensitive hashing (LSH) scheme if\nand only if the corresponding distance $1-S$ is a metric, we can show that\nthere exists a space efficient summary maintaining a $(1\\pm \\varepsilon)$\nmultiplicative approximation to $1-S$ in dynamic data streams. This in turn\nalso yields a $\\varepsilon$ additive approximation of the similarity.\n  The existence of these approximations hints at, but does not directly imply a\nLSH scheme in dynamic data streams. Our second and main contribution now lies\nin the design of such a LSH scheme maintainable in dynamic data streams. The\nscheme is space efficient, easy to implement and to the best of our knowledge\nthe first of its kind able to process deletions.\n"]}]
