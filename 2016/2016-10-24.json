Also Hubble (1929) called the discovered\ndistance-redshift relation as \"De Sitter effect\". For homogeneous matter\ndistribution cosmological gravitational redshift is proportional to square of\ndistance: z_grav ~ r^2. However for a fractal matter distribution having the\nfractal dimension D=2 the global gravitational redshift is the linear function\nof distance: z_grav ~ r, which gives possibility for interpretation of the\nHubble law without the space expansion. Here the field gravity fractal\ncosmological model (FGF) is presented, which based on two initial principles.\nThe first assumption is that the Feynman's field gravity approach describes the\ngravitational interaction, which delivers a natural basis for the conceptual\nunity of all fundamental physical interactions within the framework of the\nrelativistic and quantum fields in Minkowski space. The second hypothesis is\nthat the spatial distribution of gravitating matter is a fractal at all scales\nup to the Hubble radius. The fractal dimension of matter distribution is\nassumed to be D = 2, which implies that the global gravitational redshift is\nthe explanation of the observed linear Hubble law. In the frame of the FGF all\nthree phenomena - the cosmic background radiation, the fractal large scale\nstructure, and the Hubble law, - could be the consequence of a unique large\nscale structure evolution process of the initially homogeneous ordinary matter\nwithout nonbaryonic matter and dark energy.\n","Comment: text and misprints corrected, 8 pages, proceedings of the\n  International conference \"Problems of Practical Cosmology\", 23-27 June 2008,\n  St.-Petersburg, Russia, see http://ppc08.astro.spbu.ru/text_proc.html"]}]

In this paper, we show\nhow the vector field spectrum of the eight-dimensional effective theory can be\nobtained from the point of view of type IIB supergravity coupled to the\nworld-volume theory of the seven-branes. In particular, we first show that the\ntwo-forms of the type IIB theory absorb the seven-brane world-volume gauge\nfields via the Cremmer-Scherk mechanism. We then proceed to show that the\nmassless vector fields of the eight-dimensional theory come from KK-reducing\nthe SL(2,Z) doublet two-forms of type IIB theory along SL(2,Z) doublet\none-forms on the P1. We also discuss the relation between these vector fields\nand the \"eaten\" world-volume vector fields of the seven-branes.\n","Comment: 33 pages + appendices, 5 figures; v2: minor corrections, reference\n  added"]}]

The rank of an object w.r.t. an individual query is\ncomputed based on its distance from the query location, and the aggregate rank\nis computed from all of the individual rank orderings. Solutions to this\nfundamental problem can be used to monitor the popularity of spatial objects,\nwhich in turn can provide new analytical tools for spatial data. Our work draws\ninspiration from three different domains: rank aggregation, continuous queries\nand spatial databases. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work\nthat considers all three problem domains in a single context. Our problem is\ndifferent from the classical rank aggregation problem in the way that the rank\nof spatial objects are dependent on streaming queries whose locations are not\nknown a priori, and is different from the problem of continuous spatial queries\nbecause new query locations can arrive in any region, but do not move. In order\nto solve this problem, we show how to upper and lower bound the rank of an\nobject for any unseen query. Then we propose an approximation solution to\ncontinuously monitor the top-m objects efficiently, for which we design an\nInverted Rank File (IRF) index to guarantee the error bound of the solution. In\nparticular, we propose the notion of safe ranking to determine whether the\ncurrent result is still valid or not when new queries arrive, and propose the\nnotion of validation objects to limit the number of objects to update in the\ntop-m results.

While the framework\ndoes not lose the generality, our discussion will be restricted to two\nrepresentative types of inter-chain coupling systems: $J_{3}$- or\n$J_{4}$-system respectively. In spite of the long-range spiral order, the\ndynamical properties of these systems turn out to be highly nontrivial due to\nthe incommensurate noncollinear spin configuration and the strong quantum\nfluctuation effects enhanced by the frustration and low-dimensionality. Both\nthe systems show prominent spin Casimir effects induced by the vacuum\nfluctuation of the spin waves and related modification of the ordering vector,\nLifshitz point's position and sublattice magnetization. Significant and\nspontaneous magnon decay effects are manifested in the quantum corrections to\nthe excitation spectrum. By adjusting the strength of magnetic anisotropy and\nvarying the approximation scheme, it is revealed that these striking distinct\nfeatures are quite robust and have deep connection with both the spin Casimir\nand the magnon decay effects.

The technique of metric learning is explored to construct a\ndata-dependent distance metric to measure the relationships between instances,\nmeanwhile between bags and images, more accurately.

MVML learns multiple distance metrics,\neach one models a single view, to unifies the information from multiple views.\nThe method can be solved by alternate optimization iteratively. Gradient ascent\nand positive semi-definite projection are utilized in the iterations. Distance\ncomparisons verified that the new bag distance function is prior to previous\nfunctions.

Its applicability to convex optimization programs has\ngained significant popularity for its intuitive implementation that involves\nonly simple algebraic operations. In fact, if the projection onto the feasible\nset is easy to compute, then the method has low complexity. On the other hand,\nwhen the problem is nonconvex, e.g. because of nonlinear equality constraints,\nthe projection becomes hard and thus impractical. In this paper, we propose a\nprojected gradient method for Nonlinear Programs (NLPs) that only requires\nprojections onto the linearization of the nonlinear constraints around the\ncurrent iterate, similarly to Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP). Although\nthe projection is easier to compute, it makes the intermediate steps unfeasible\nfor the original problem. As a result, the gradient method does not fall either\ninto the projected gradient descent approaches, because the projection is not\nperformed onto the original nonlinear manifold, or into the standard SQP, since\nsecond-order information is not used. For nonlinear smooth optimization\nproblems, we analyze the similarities of the proposed method with SQP and\nassess its local and global convergence to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of\nthe original problem. Further, we show that nonlinear Model Predictive Control\n(MPC) is a promising application of the proposed method, due to the sparsity of\nthe resulting optimization problem.

More precisely, no model can assign deterministic\noutcomes to the projectors of a quantum measurement in a way that depends only\non the projector and not the context (the full set of projectors) in which it\nappeared, despite the fact that the Born rule probabilities associated with\nprojectors are independent of the context. A more general, operational\ndefinition of contextuality introduced by Spekkens, which we will term\n\"probabilistic contextuality\", drops the assumption of determinism and allows\nfor operations other than measurements to be considered contextual.\nProbabilistic noncontextuality represents the postulate that elements of an\noperational theory that cannot be distinguished from each other based on the\nstatistics of arbitrarily many repeated experiments are ontologically\nidentical. In this paper, we introduce a framework that enables us to\ndistinguish between different noncontextuality assumptions in terms of the\nrelationships between the ontological representations of objects in the theory\ngiven a certain relation between their operational representations. This\nframework can be used to motivate and define a \"possibilistic\" analogue,\nencapsulating the idea that elements of an operational theory that cannot be\nunambiguously distinguished operationally can also not be unambiguously\ndistinguished ontologically. We then prove that possibilistic noncontextuality\nis equivalent to an alternative notion proposed by Hardy. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that these weaker noncontextuality assumptions are sufficient to\nprove alternative versions of known \"no-go\" theorems that constrain\n$\\psi$-epistemic models for quantum mechanics.\n","Comment: 15 Pages, 2 figures, 1 appendix"]}]

To estimate the dictionary parameter,\nwe pursue two strategies, relying on either a deterministic or a probabilistic\nmodel for the dictionary parameter.
