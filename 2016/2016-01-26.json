Emergence from events has an operational motivation in\nrequiring that every physical quantity---including space-time---be defined\nthrough precise measurement procedures. Topological homogeneity is a\nrequirement for having space-time metric emergent from the pure topology of\ncausal connections, whereas physically homogeneity corresponds to the\nuniversality of the physical law. We analyze in detail the case of 1+1\ndimensions. If we consider the causal connections as an exchange of classical\ninformation, we can establish coordinate systems via an Einsteinian protocol,\nand this leads to a digital version of the Lorentz transformations. In a\ncomputational analogy, the foliation construction can be regarded as the\nsynchronization with a global clock of the calls to independent subroutines\n(corresponding to the causally independent events) in a parallel distributed\ncomputation. Thus the Lorentz time-dilation emerges as an increased density of\nleaves within a single tic-tac of a clock, whereas space-contraction results\nfrom the corresponding decrease of density of events per leaf.

By exploiting this key analytical tool, we provide an\nin-depth characterization of the mutual information distribution for\nsufficiently large (but finite) antenna numbers. In particular, we derive\nsystematic closed-form expansions for the high order cumulants. These results\nyield considerable new insight, such as providing a technical explanation as to\nwhy the well known Gaussian approximation is quite robust to large SNR for the\ncase of unequal antenna arrays, whilst it deviates strongly for equal antenna\narrays. In addition, by drawing upon our high order cumulant expansions, we\nemploy the Edgeworth expansion technique to propose a refined Gaussian\napproximation which is shown to give a very accurate closed-form\ncharacterization of the mutual information distribution, both around the mean\nand for moderate deviations into the tails (where the Gaussian approximation\nfails remarkably). For stronger deviations where the Edgeworth expansion\nbecomes unwieldy, we employ the saddle point method and asymptotic integration\ntools to establish new analytical characterizations which are shown to be very\nsimple and accurate.

An emphasis is placed upon the\ntemporal history of chemical enrichment during its passage through the corona\nand CGM. We derive the distributions of time between gas crossing the virial\nradius and being accreted to the star forming region (which allows mixing\nwithin the corona), as well as the time between gas being accreted to the star\nforming region and then forming stars (which allows mixing within the disc).\nSignificant numbers of stars are formed from gas that cycles back through the\nhot halo after first accreting to the star forming region. Gas entering high\nmass galaxies is pre-enriched in low mass proto-galaxies prior to entering the\nvirial radius of the central progenitor, with only small amounts of primordial\ngas accreted, even at high redshift (z~5). After entering the virial radius,\nsignificant further enrichment occurs prior to the accretion of the gas to the\nstar forming region, with gas that is feeding the star forming region\nsurpassing 0.1Z by z=0.

We propose that the transition from current State\nscience standards to NGSS demonstrates a extensive consensus on what all\nstudents should know and be able to do at specific K-12 grade levels and what\ntopics can be postponed or excluded on the premise of developmental readiness.\nIn order to facilitate this work, one of the STEM Fellows, Larry Bowman\n(author), created a series of 18 posters showing correlations between the\ncurrent Tennessee Science Education standards (Huffman, 2009) and NGSS\n(Achieve, 2013). This article specifically addresses the NGSS Middle Grades\nDisciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs) as compared to the existing 6-8 Science\nStandards from the Tennessee Science Curriculum Framework. Some Grade Level\nExpectations (GLEs) for Middle Grades Science have been relocated to other\ngrade levels, and others have been introduced. The term Middle Grades is used\nfor students 10 to 15 years of age covering the critical years when children\nare transitioning from concrete operational to formal operational stages.\n(Piaget and Inhelder 2013).\n","Comment: 9 pages, 3 Figures"]}]

This mean-field picture is augmented by collisional correlations\nhandled in relaxation time approximation which is inspired from the\ncorresponding semi-classical picture. The method involves the estimate of\nmicroscopic relaxation rates/times which is presently taken from the well\nestablished semi-classical experience. The relaxation time approximation\nimplies evaluation of the instantaneous equilibrium state towards which the\ndynamical state is progressively driven at the pace of the microscopic\nrelaxation time.\n  As test case, we consider Na clusters of various sizes excited either by a\nswift ion projectile or by a short and intense laser pulse, driven in various\ndynamical regimes ranging from linear to strongly non-linear reactions. We\nobserve a strong effect of dissipation on sensitive observables such as net\nionization and angular distributions of emitted electrons. The effect is\nespecially large for moderate excitations where typical relaxation/dissipation\ntime scales efficiently compete with ionization for dissipating the available\nexcitation energy.

Following our previous work on\nthe evolution of PAHs in the NGC 7023 reflection nebula, we evaluate, using\nphotochemical modeling, the possibility that the PAH C$_{66}$H$_{20}$ (i.e.\ncircumovalene) can lead to the formation of C$_{60}$ upon irradiation by\nultraviolet photons. The chemical pathway involves full dehydrogenation,\nfolding into a floppy closed cage and shrinking of the cage by loss of C$_2$\nunits until it reaches the symmetric C$_{60}$ molecule. At 10\" from the\nilluminating star and with realistic molecular parameters, the model predicts\nthat 100% of C$_{66}$H$_{20}$ is converted into C$_{60}$ in $\\sim$ 10$^5$\nyears, a timescale comparable to the age of the nebula. Shrinking appears to be\nthe kinetically limiting step of the whole process. Hence, PAHs larger than\nC$_{66}$H$_{20}$ are unlikely to contribute significantly to the formation of\nC$_{60}$, while PAHs containing between 60 and 66 C atoms should contribute to\nthe formation of C$_{60}$ with shorter timescales, and PAHs containing less\nthan 60 C atoms will be destroyed. Assuming a classical size distribution for\nthe PAH precursors, our model predicts absolute abundances of C$_{60}$ are up\nto several $10^{-4}$ of the elemental carbon, i.e. less than a percent of the\ntypical interstellar PAH abundance, which is consistent with observational\nstudies. According to our model, once formed, C$_{60}$ can survive much longer\nthan other fullerenes because of the remarkable stability of the C$_{60}$\nmolecule at high internal energies.Hence, a natural consequence is that\nC$_{60}$ is more abundant than other fullerenes in highly irradiated\nenvironments.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A.

The patterns of parameter x environment x\nmanagement interactions were investigated for the most influential parameters,\nconsidering a potential genetic range of +/- 20% compared to a reference. Main\n(i.e. linear) and interaction (i.e. non-linear and interaction) sensitivity\nindices calculated for most of APSIM-Wheat parameters allowed the identifcation\nof 42 parameters substantially impacting yield in most target environments.\nAmong these, a subset of parameters related to phenology, resource acquisition,\nresource use efficiency and biomass allocation were identified as potential\ncandidates for crop (and model) improvement.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 8 figures.

Using the most common model to tackle this problem, a rapidly rotating\nand differentially cooled spherical shell containing an incompressible and\nviscous liquid is numerically investigated. To gain the physical basics, we\nconsider a simple, equatorial symmetric perturbation of the CMB heat flux\nshaped as a spherical harmonic $Y_{11}$. The thermodynamic properties of the\ninduced flows mainly depend on the degree of nonlinearity parametrised by a\nhorizontal Rayleigh number $Ra_h=q^\\ast Ra$, where $q^\\ast$ is the relative CMB\nheat flux anomaly amplitude and $Ra$ is the Rayleigh number which controls\nradial buoyancy-driven convection. Depending on $Ra_h$ we characterise three\nflow regimes through their spatial patterns, heat transport and flow speed\nscalings: in the linear conductive regime the radial inward flow is found to be\nphase shifted $90^\\circ$ eastwards from the maximal heat flux as predicted by a\nlinear quasi-geostrophic model for rapidly rotating spherical systems. The\nadvective regime is characterised by an increased $Ra_h$ where nonlinearities\nbecome significant, but is still subcritical to radial convection. There the\nupwelling is dispersed and the downwelling is compressed by the thermal\nadvection into a spiralling jet-like structure. As $Ra_h$ becomes large enough\nfor the radial convection to set in, the jet remains identifiable on\ntime-average and significantly alters the global heat budget in the convective\nregime. Our results suggest, that the boundary forcing not only introduces a\nnet horizontal heat transport but also suppresses the convection locally to\nsuch an extent, that the net Nusselt number is reduced by up to 50\\%, even\nthough the mean CMB heat flux is conserved.\n"]}]

The theory of\ndynamical systems predicts a slowing down when a system destabilises towards a\ntipping point. In simple stochastic systems this can result in increasing\nvariance and autocorrelation, potentially yielding an early warning of an\nabrupt change. Here we aim to establish whether the loss of Arctic sea ice\nwould follow these conceptual predictions, and which trends in sea ice\nvariability can be expected from pre-industrial conditions toward an Arctic\nthat is ice-free during the whole year. To this end, we apply a model hierarchy\nconsisting of two box models and one comprehensive Earth system model. We find\na consistent and robust decrease of the ice volume's annual relaxation time\nbefore summer ice is lost because thinner ice can adjust more quickly to\nperturbations. Thereafter, the relaxation time increases, mainly because the\nsystem becomes dominated by the ocean water's large heat capacity when the\nice-free season becomes longer. Both trends carry over to the autocorrelation\nof sea ice thickness in time series. These changes are robust to the nature and\norigin of climate variability in the models and hardly depend on the balance of\nfeedbacks. Therefore, characteristic trends can be expected in the future. As\nthese trends are not specific to the existence of abrupt ice loss, the\nprospects for early warnings seem very limited. This result also has\nimplications for statistical indicators in other systems whose effective mass\nchanges over time, affecting the trend of their relaxation time. However, the\nrobust relation between state and variability would allow an estimate of\nsea-ice variability from only short observations.

In this paper we investigate the\ntradeoffs for two representative schemes: the global timeout scheme and the\nantipacket dissemination scheme that are proposed for lossy and lossless data\ndelivery, respectively. For lossy data delivery, we show that with the\nsuggested global timeout value, the per-node buffer occupancy only depends on\nthe maximum tolerable packet loss rate and pairwise meeting rate. For lossless\ndata delivery, we show that the buffer occupancy can be significantly reduced\nvia fully antipacket dissemination. The developed tools therefore offer new\ninsights for epidemic routing protocol designs and performance evaluations.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 13 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Vehicular\n  Technology"]}]

The definition of a\n$G$-clustering dynamics relies on the use of the so-called voltage graph. We\nrecall that a $G$-voltage graph is comprised of two elements---one is a\ndirected graph (digraph), and the other is a map assigning elements of a\ngroup~$G$ to the edges of the digraph. For example, in the case when $G = \\{1,\n-1\\}$, i.e., a cyclic group of order~$2$, a voltage graph is nothing but a\nsigned graph. A $G$-clustering dynamics can then be viewed as a generalization\nof the so-called Altafini's model, which was originally defined over a signed\ngraph, by defining the dynamics over a voltage graph. One of the main\ncontributions of this paper is to identify a necessary and sufficient condition\nfor the exponential convergence of a $G$-clustering dynamics.

Commodity DDR DRAM refreshes cells at the rank level. This degrades\nperformance significantly because it prevents an entire rank from serving\nmemory requests while being refreshed. DRAM designed for mobile platforms,\nLPDDR DRAM, supports an enhanced mode, called per-bank refresh, that refreshes\ncells at the bank level. This enables a bank to be accessed while another in\nthe same rank is being refreshed, alleviating part of the negative performance\nimpact of refreshes. However, there are two shortcomings of per-bank refresh.\nFirst, the per-bank refresh scheduling scheme does not exploit the full\npotential of overlapping refreshes with accesses across banks because it\nrestricts the banks to be refreshed in a sequential round-robin order. Second,\naccesses to a bank that is being refreshed have to wait.\n  To mitigate the negative performance impact of DRAM refresh, we propose two\ncomplementary mechanisms, DARP (Dynamic Access Refresh Parallelization) and\nSARP (Subarray Access Refresh Parallelization). The goal is to address the\ndrawbacks of per-bank refresh by building more efficient techniques to\nparallelize refreshes and accesses within DRAM. First, instead of issuing\nper-bank refreshes in a round-robin order, DARP issues per-bank refreshes to\nidle banks in an out-of-order manner. Furthermore, DARP schedules refreshes\nduring intervals when a batch of writes are draining to DRAM. Second, SARP\nexploits the existence of mostly-independent subarrays within a bank. With\nminor modifications to DRAM organization, it allows a bank to serve memory\naccesses to an idle subarray while another subarray is being refreshed.\nExtensive evaluations show that our mechanisms improve system performance and\nenergy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art refresh policies and the benefit\nincreases as DRAM density increases.\n","Comment: 3 pages, 3 figures"]}]

I also find a maximum partial lifetime for that mode of\n$\\tau(K^+ \\bar\\nu) \\sim 10^{36}\\,$years. For the type-I seesaw case, I find\nthat $K^+ \\bar\\nu$ decay mode is satisfied for any values of the triplet mixing\nparameters giving no major enhancement, and all other modes are easily\nsatisfied for arbitrary mixing values; I also find a maximum partial lifetime\nfor $K^+ \\bar\\nu$ of nearly $10^{38}\\,$years, which is sub-dominant to gauge\nboson decay channels.\n","Comment: This work is the thesis version of arXiv:1506.08468; 131 pages, 13\n  figures, 9 tables, 1 appendix"]}]

We propose a mechanism for the boiling crisis that is based on the\nspreading of the dry spot under a vapor bubble. The spreading is initiated by\nthe vapor recoil force, a force coming from the liquid evaporation into the\nbubble. Since the evaporation intensity increases sharply near the triple\ncontact line, the influence of the vapor recoil can be described as a change of\nthe apparent contact angle. Therefore, for the most usual case of complete\nwetting of the heating surface by the liquid, the boiling crisis can be\nunderstood as a drying transition from complete to partial wetting. The state\nof nucleate boiling, which is boiling in its usual sense, is characterized by a\nvery large rate of heat transfer from the heating surface to the bulk because\nthe superheated liquid is carried away from the heating surface by the\ndeparting vapor bubbles. If the heating power is increased, the temperature of\nthe heating surface increases with the heat flux. When the heat flux from the\nheater reaches a threshold value q CHF (the critical heat flux, CHF), the vapor\nbubbles suddenly form a film which covers the heating surface and insulates the\nlatter from the bulk of the liquid. The temperature of the heating surface\ngrows so rapidly that the heater can fuse unless its power is controlled. This\nphenomenon is known under the names of \"boiling crisis,\" \"burnout,\" or\n\"Departure from Nucleate Boiling\" (DNB) [1]. The final state of this transition\nis called film boiling. This problem has become very important since the\n1940's, with the beginning of the industrial exploitation of heat exchangers\nwith large heat fluxes (as with nuclear power stations). Since then a huge\namount of research has been done for the various conditions of pool boiling\n(boiling without imposed external flow) and flow boiling (boiling of the\nflowing water) [2]. Numerous empirical correlations have been proposed, each\ndescribing the dependence of the CHF on the physical parameters of the liquid\nand of the heater more or less correctly for a particular geometry and\nparticular conditions of boiling [2]. A strong dependence of the threshold on\nthe details of the experimental setup coupled with difficulties in separating\nthe consequences of DNB from its causes is at the origin of a large number of\nfrequently controversial hypotheses [2]. The violence of boiling makes\nobservations quite difficult. Good quality photographic experiments are\npresented in only a few articles (see e.g. [3] -- [6]). Despite an increasing\ninterest in the physical aspect of the problem during recent years [7,8] and\nnumerous empirical approaches, the underlying physics still remains obscure.

To\nanswer this question, one needs a quality score that utilizes both structure\nand attributes. Popular existing measures either quantify the structure only\nand ignore the attributes (e.g., conductance), or only consider the\nconnectedness of the nodes inside the neighborhood and ignore the cross-edges\nat the boundary (e.g., density).\n  In this work we propose normality, a new quality measure for attributed\nneighborhoods. Normality utilizes structure and attributes together to quantify\nboth internal consistency and external separability. It exhibits two key\nadvantages over other measures: (1) It allows many boundary-edges as long as\nthey can be \"exonerated\"; i.e., either (i) are expected under a null model,\nand/or (ii) the boundary nodes do not exhibit the subset of attributes shared\nby the neighborhood members. Existing measures, in contrast, penalize boundary\nedges irrespectively. (2) Normality can be efficiently maximized to\nautomatically infer the shared attribute subspace (and respective weights) that\ncharacterize a neighborhood. This efficient optimization allows us to process\ngraphs with millions of attributes.\n  We capitalize on our measure to present a novel approach for Anomaly Mining\nof Entity Neighborhoods (AMEN). Experiments on real-world attributed graphs\nillustrate the effectiveness of our measure at anomaly detection, outperforming\npopular approaches including conductance, density, OddBall, and SODA.

To do so, we have developed a new framework\nfor conjunctive concept combination. This framework gives a semantic grounding\nto the weighted sum approach to concept combination seen in the literature. We\nimplement the framework in a multi-agent simulation of language evolution and\nshow that shared combination weights emerge. The expected value and the\nvariance of these weights across agents may be predicted from the distribution\nof elements in the conceptual space, as determined by the underlying\nenvironment, together with the rate at which agents adopt others' concepts.\nWhen this rate is smaller, the agents are able to converge to weights with\nlower variance. However, the time taken to converge to a steady state\ndistribution of weights is longer.\n","Comment: AISB 2014, updated to include references to previous work"]}]

Our data set includes 25 optical spectra between -11 and\n+58 days with respect to B-band maximum light, providing an unusually complete\ntime history. The early spectra resemble those of a SN 1991T-like object but\nwith a relatively strong Ca H&K absorption feature. The first clear sign of Si\nII 6355, characteristic of Type Ia supernovae, is found at day -7 and its\nvelocity remains constant up to at least the first month after B-band maximum\nlight. The transition to normal-looking spectra is found to occur earlier than\nin SN 1991T suggesting SN 1999aa as a possible link between SN 1991T-like and\nBranch-normal supernovae. Comparing the observations with synthetic spectra,\ndoubly ionized Fe, Si and Ni are identified at early epochs. These are\ncharacteristic of SN 1991T-like objects. Furthermore, in the day -11 spectrum,\nevidence is found for an absorption feature which could be identified as high\nvelocity C II 6580 or H-alpha. At the same epoch C III 4648.8 at photospheric\nvelocity is probably responsible for the absorption feature at 4500 A. High\nvelocity Ca is found around maximum light together with Si II and Fe II\nconfined in a narrow velocity window. Implied constraints on supernovae\nprogenitor systems and explosion hydrodynamical models are briefly discussed.\n","Comment: 46 pages including 23 figures. Accepted for publication by AJ.
