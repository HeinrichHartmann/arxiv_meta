Some\nconsequences of the modified Maxwell equations are investigated. The results\nshow that for reasonable parameters the modification does not affect existing\nexperiments and observations. However, the field equations with a\ncurvature-coupled term can be testable in astrophysical environments where mass\ndensity is high or the gravity of electromagnetic radiation plays a dominant\nrole in dynamics, e.g., interior of neutron stars and the early universe.\n","Comment: 23 pages, including 1 figure.

The work reported in [1,2] takes an extra\nstep forward by showing that ordering these patches to form an approximate\nshortest path can be leveraged for better processing. The core idea is to apply\na simple filter on the resulting 1D smoothed signal obtained after the\npatch-permutation. This idea has been also explored in combination with a\nwavelet pyramid, leading eventually to a sophisticated and highly effective\nregularizer for inverse problems in imaging.

Using a plain 1D Laplacian, the proposed regularization\nforces robust smoothness (L1) on the permuted pixels. Since the permutation\noriginates from patch-ordering, we propose to accumulate the smoothness terms\nover all the patches' pixels. Furthermore, we take into account the found\ndistances between adjacent patches in the ordering, by weighting the Laplacian\noutcome.

Such activity is unique among the\ncomet nuclei visited by spacecraft, and suggests that CO2 ice is very near the\nsurface, which is inconsistent with our expectations of an object that\nthermophysically evolved for ~45 million years prior to entering the Jupiter\nFamily of comets. Here we explain this pattern of activity by showing that a\nvery plausible recent episode of rapid rotation (rotation period of ~11 [10-13]\nhours) would have induced avalanches in Hartley 2's currently active regions\nthat excavated down to CO2-rich ices and activated the small lobe of the\nnucleus. At Hartley 2's current rate of spindown about its principal axis, the\nnucleus would have been spinning fast enough to induce avalanches ~3-4 orbits\nprior to the DIXI flyby (~1984-1991). This coincides with Hartley 2's discovery\nin 1986, and implies that the initiation of CO2 activity facilitated the\ncomet's discovery. During the avalanches, the sliding material would either be\nlofted off the surface by gas activity, or possibly gained enough momentum\nmoving downhill (toward the tip of the small lobe) to slide off the nucleus.\nMuch of this material would have failed to reach escape velocity, and would\nreimpact the nucleus, forming debris deposits. The similar size frequency\ndistribution of the mounds observed on the surface of Hartley 2 and chunks of\nmaterial in its inner coma suggest that the 20-40 meter mounds observed by the\nDIXI mission on the surface of Hartley 2 are potentially these fallback debris\ndeposits. As the nucleus spun down from a rotation period of ~11 hours to 18.34\nhours at the time of the DIXI flyby, the location of potential minima, where\nmaterials preferentially settle, migrated about the surface, allowing us to\nplace relative ages on most of the imaged terrains of the nucleus.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 7 figures"]}]

The scale and complexity of\nsuch networks together with the inadequacies of general purpose computing\nplatforms have led to a significant interest in the development of efficient\nhardware implementations. In this work, we focus on designing energy efficient\non-chip storage for the synaptic weights. In order to minimize the power\nconsumption of typical digital CMOS implementations of such large-scale\nnetworks, the digital neurons could be operated reliably at scaled voltages by\nreducing the clock frequency. On the contrary, the on-chip synaptic storage\ndesigned using a conventional 6T SRAM is susceptible to bitcell failures at\nreduced voltages. However, the intrinsic error resiliency of NNs to small\nsynaptic weight perturbations enables us to scale the operating voltage of the\n6TSRAM. Our analysis on a widely used digit recognition dataset indicates that\nthe voltage can be scaled by 200mV from the nominal operating voltage (950mV)\nfor practically no loss (less than 0.5%) in accuracy (22nm predictive\ntechnology). Scaling beyond that causes substantial performance degradation\nowing to increased probability of failures in the MSBs of the synaptic weights.\nWe, therefore propose a significance driven hybrid 8T-6T SRAM, wherein the\nsensitive MSBs are stored in 8T bitcells that are robust at scaled voltages due\nto decoupled read and write paths. In an effort to further minimize the area\npenalty, we present a synaptic-sensitivity driven hybrid memory architecture\nconsisting of multiple 8T-6T SRAM banks.

Until now, it has not been found a\nway to experimentally verify this supposition although confirmation or\nrefutation of the existence of discrete states is crucial for the solution of\nmyosin motor problem. Here I show that a set of equal myosin heads arranged\nequidistantly along an actin filament produce X-ray pattern which varies with\nthe type of conformation. If the lever arms of all myosin heads reside in one\nand the same position (continuous conformation), all the heads have the same\nform-factor and equally scatter electromagnetic wave. In this case, only the\ngeometric factor associated with a spatial ordering of the heads will determine\nthe X-ray pattern. The situation changes if the average lever arm position is\nthe same, but inherently every head can reside only in several diverse discrete\nstates, hopping irregularly from one to another. In this case, the form-factors\ncorresponding to distinct states are dissimilar, and the increments in phases\nof X-rays scattered by different heads are different as well. Inasmuch as every\nquantum of radiation interacts with the heads residing in different states,\nthis results in additional interference and some peaks in the X-ray pattern\nshould slacken or even extinct as compared with the pattern from the heads with\nthe continuous-type conformation. The formulas describing both cases are\ncompared in this article. In general, the distinction between X-ray patterns is\ninsignificant, but they could be appreciably different at some stages of\nconformation process (respective lever arm position depends on the type of\ndiscrete model).

We present streaming potential and\nelectrical conductivity measurements on a calcite powder in contact with an\naqueous NaCl electrolyte. Our streaming potential model corrects the apparent\nzeta potential of calcite by accounting for the influence of surface\nconductivity and flow regime. We show that the HS equation seriously\nunderestimates the zeta potential of calcite, particularly when the electrolyte\nis diluted (ionic strength < 0.01 M) because of calcite surface conductivity.\nThe basic Stern model successfully predicted the corrected zeta potential by\nassuming that the zeta potential is located at the outer Helmholtz plane, i.e.\nwithout considering a stagnant diffuse layer at the calcite-water interface.\nThe surface conductivity of calcite crystals was inferred from electrical\nconductivity measurements and computed using our basic Stern model. Surface\nconductivity was also successfully predicted by our surface complexation model.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 9 figures"]}]

The conventional wisdom is that the pitch angle does\nnot change during the radiation process. The argument is based on Larmor's\nradiation formula, where in a synchrotron case the radiation power is along the\ninstantaneous direction of motion of the charge. Then the momentum loss will\nalso be parallel to that direction and therefore the pitch angle of the charge\nwould remain unaffected. The accordingly derived formulas for energy losses of\nsynchrotron electrons in radio galaxies are the standard text-book material for\nthe last 50 years. However, if we use the momentum transformation laws from\nspecial relativity, then we find that the pitch angle of a radiating charge\nvaries. While the velocity component parallel to the magnetic field remains\nunaffected, the perpendicular component does reduce in magnitude due to\nradiative losses, implying a change in the pitch angle. This apparent paradox\nis resolved when effects on the charge motion are calculated not from Larmor's\nformula but from Lorentz's radiation reaction formula.

This separation allows the\nabstraction of resources as transmission parameters of each user over the\n5G-SDWN.

HCN emission is bright towards each galaxy nucleus and in the\nextranuclear region of active star formation; it was not detected in the IC 694\ndisk, or the eastern part of the overlap region, leading to lower limits of 25\nand 20 respectively. By contrast, at the nuclei of IC 694 and NGC 3690 the\nratios are 9 +- 1 and 14 +- 3 respectively. In the western part of the overlap\nregion it is 11 +- 3.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 4 postscript figures, to appear in ApJ Letters"]}]

We then apply these results to various\napproximation properties on reduced free products. As a first application, we\ngive a quick proof of Dykema's theorem on the stability of exactness under the\nreduced free product for $C^*$-algebras. We next study the stability of the\ncompletely contractive approximation property (CCAP) under reduced free\nproduct. Our first result in this direction is that a reduced free product of\nfinite dimensional $C^*$-algebras has the CCAP. The second one asserts that a\nvon Neumann reduced free product of injective von Neumann algebras has the\nweak-$*$ CCAP. In the case of group $C^*$-algebras, we show that a free product\nof weakly amenable groups with constant 1 is weakly amenable.\n"]}]

The separable character of the residual interaction allows to avoid\ndiagonalization of high-rank RPA matrices and thus to minimize the calculation\neffort.
