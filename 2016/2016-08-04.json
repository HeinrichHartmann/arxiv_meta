The need to respect prescribed lower bounds on the cluster\nsizes has been observed in many scientific and business applications.\n  In this paper, we present and analyze a generalization of $k$-means that is\ncapable of handling weighted point sets and prescribed lower and upper bounds\non the cluster sizes. We call it weight-balanced $k$-means. The key difference\nto existing models lies in the ability to handle the combination of weighted\npoint sets with prescribed bounds on the cluster sizes. This imposes the need\nto perform partial membership clustering, and leads to significant differences.\n  For example, while finite termination of all $k$-means variants for\nunweighted point sets is a simple consequence of the existence of only finitely\nmany partitions of a given set of points, the situation is more involved for\nweighted point sets, as there are infinitely many partial membership\nclusterings. Using polyhedral theory, we show that the number of iterations of\nweight-balanced $k$-means is bounded above by $n^{O(dk)}$, so in particular it\nis polynomial for fixed $k$ and $d$. This is similar to the known worst-case\nupper bound for classical $k$-means for unweighted point sets and unrestricted\ncluster sizes, despite the much more general framework.

The main part is a detailed report of the recent (partial)\nsolution of the quantum Gaussian optimizers problem which establishes an\noptimal property of Glauber's coherent states -- a particular instance of pure\nquantum Gaussian states. We elaborate on the notion of quantum Gaussian channel\nas a noncommutative generalization of Gaussian kernel to show that the coherent\nstates, and under certain conditions only they, minimize a broad class of the\nconcave functionals of the output of a Gaussian channel. Thus, the output\nstates corresponding to the Gaussian input are \"the least chaotic\", majorizing\nall the other outputs. The solution, however, is essentially restricted to the\ngauge-invariant case where a distinguished complex structure plays a special\nrole. We also comment on the related famous additivity conjecture, which was\nsolved in principle in the negative some five years ago. This refers to the\nadditivity or multiplicativity (with respect to tensor products of channels) of\ninformation quantities related to the classical capacity of quantum channel,\nsuch as $(1\\rightarrow p)$-norms or the minimal von Neumann or R\\'enyi output\nentropies. A remarkable corollary of the present solution of the quantum\nGaussian optimizers problem is that these additivity properties, while not\nvalid in general, do hold in the important and interesting class of the\ngauge-covariant Gaussian channels.\n","Comment: 47 pages.

Recent\nterrestrial experiments constrain both its value and slope at nuclear\nsaturation density, however, its value at higher densities is unknown. Assuming\na Free Fermi-gas (FFG) model for the kinetic symmetry energy, the high-density\nextrapolation depends on a single parameter, the density dependence of the\npotential symmetry energy. The Correlated Fermi-gas (CFG) model improves on the\nFFG model by including the effects of short-range, correlated, high-momentum,\nnucleons in nuclear matter. Using the CFG model for the kinetic symmetry energy\nalong with constraints from terrestrial measurements leads to a much softer\ndensity dependence for the potential symmetry energy. Purpose: Examine the\nability of the FFG and CFG models to describe NS observables that are directly\nsensitive to the symmetry energy at high-density. Specifically, examine the\nability of the CFG model, with its softer density dependence of the potential\nsymmetry energy, to describe a two solar-mass NS. Methods: Using a Bayesian\nanalysis of NS observables we compare the CFG and FFG models and examine the\nresulting parameters in the NS EOS and the density dependence of the potential\nsymmetry energy. Results: Despite the large difference in the density\ndependence of the potential part of the symmetry energy, both models can\ndescribe the NS data and support a two solar-mass NS. The different density\ndependences has only a small effect on the NS EOS. Conclusions: While sensitive\nto the high-density values of the symmetry energy, NS observables alone are not\nenough to distinguish between the CFG and FFG models. This indicates that the\nNS EOS, obtain from Bayesian analysis of NS observables, is robust and is not\nsensitive to the exact nuclear model used for the kinetic symmetry energy.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures"]}]

When dealing with the dynamics of the system, macro and small\ncells are modeled by multi-class processor sharing queues. Macro and small\ncells are assumed to be operating in the same bandwidth. Consequently, they are\ncoupled due to the mutual interferences generated by each cell to the other. We\nderive several performance metrics such as the mean flow throughput and the\ngain, if any, generated from deploying small cells to manage traffic hotspots.\nOur results show that in case the hotspot is near the macro BS (Base Station),\neven a perfect positioning of the small cell will not yield improved\nperformance due to the high interference experienced at macro and small cell\nusers. However, in case the hotspot is located far enough from the macro BS,\nperforming errors in small cell positioning is tolerated (since related results\nshow positive gains) and it is still beneficial in offloading traffic from the\ncongested macrocell. The best performance metrics depend also on several other\nimportant factors such as the users' arrival intensity, the capacity of the\ncell and the size of the traffic hotspot.\n","Comment: This paper is already published in IEEE Transactions on Vehicular\n  Technology 2016"]}]

Transmission electron microscopy\nshows that Ti clusters of nanometer-size are formed on graphene. Thermal\ndesorption spectroscopy captures three hydrogen desorption peaks from\nhydrogenated graphene-supported Ti clusters. First principle calculations also\nfound three types of interaction: Two types of bonds with different partial\nionic character and physisorption. The physical origin for this rests on the\ncharge state of the Ti clusters: when Ti clusters are neutral, H2 is\ndissociated, and H forms bonds with the Ti cluster. On the other hand, H2 is\nadsorbed in molecular form on positively charged Ti clusters, resulting in\nphysisorption. Thus, this work clarifies the bonding mechanisms of hydrogen on\ngraphene-supported Ti clusters.\n"]}]

Relatively large (several per mil per atomic\nmass unit) Si isotope fractionation occurs in low-temperature environments\nduring biochemical and geochemical precipitation of dissolved Si, where the\nprecipitate is preferentially enriched in the lighter isotopes relative to the\ndissolved Si. In contrast, only a limited range (tenths of a per mil) of Si\nisotope fractionation has been observed from high-temperature igneous\nprocesses. Therefore, Si isotopes may be useful as tracers for the presence of\ncrustal material within OIB mantle source regions that experienced relatively\nlow-temperature surface processes in a manner similar to other stable isotope\nsystems, such as oxygen. Characterizing the isotopic composition of the mantle\nis also of central importance to the use of the Si isotope system as a basis\nfor comparisons with other planetary bodies (e.g., Moon, Mars, asteroids).\n  Here we present the first comprehensive suite of high-precision Si isotope\ndata obtained by MC-ICP-MS for a diverse suite of OIB.

The consequences of\ndifferentiation on the structure and composition of planets are typically\naddressed considering only the interaction of molten iron with an immiscible\n`rocky' phase. We demonstrate that mixing in a representative system of liquid\nor solid MgO and liquid iron to a single homogeneous liquid occurs at\nsufficiently low temperature to be present in the aftermath of a giant impact.\nApplying the thermodynamic integration technique to density functional theory\nmolecular dynamics simulations, we determine the solvus closure temperature for\nthe Fe-MgO system for pressures up to 400 GPa. Solvus closure occurs at\n$\\sim$4000 K at low pressure, and has a weak positive pressure dependence, such\nthat its gradient with respect to depth is less steep than an adiabatic\ntemperature profile. This predicts a new mode of core-mantle differentiation\nfollowing the most energetic giant impacts, with exsolution of iron from the\nmixture beginning in the outer layers of the planet. We demonstrate that\nhigh-temperature equilibration results in delivery of nominally insoluble\nMg-rich material to the early core.
