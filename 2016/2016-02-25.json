For Matrix\nModels [53] the method of orthogonal polynomials can be used and the\nasymptotics of the Christoffel-Darboux kernel [59] become the key for studying\nuniversality. In this paper the existing results on the CD-kernel will be\nextended in two directions. Firstly, in order to analyze the transition from\nthe universal to the non-universal regime, we provide leading order asymptotics\nthat are global rather than local. This allows e.g. to describe the moderate\ndeviations for the largest eigenvalues of unitary ensembles ($\\beta$ = 2),\nwhere such a transition occurs. Secondly, our asymptotics will be uniform under\nperturbations of the probability measure that defines the matrix ensemble. Such\ninformation is useful for the analysis of a different type of ensembles [25],\nwhich is not known to be determinantal and for which the method of orthogonal\npolynomials cannot be used directly. The just described applications of our\nresults are formulated in this paper but will be proved elsewhere. As a\nbyproduct of our analysis we derive first order corrections for the 1-point\ncorrelation functions of unitary ensembles in the bulk.

We develop a data-driven method for solving\nthe classification problem, where syndrome types are identified and quantified\nbased on patterns detected in unlabeled symptom survey data.\n  Method: Latent class analysis (LCA) has been applied in WM research to solve\na similar problem, i.e., to identify subtypes of a patient population in the\nabsence of a gold standard. A widely known weakness of LCA is that it makes an\nunrealistically strong independence assumption. We relax the assumption by\nfirst detecting symptom co-occurrence patterns from survey data and use those\npatterns instead of the symptoms as features for LCA. Results: The result of\nthe investigation is a six-step method: Data collection, symptom co-occurrence\npattern discovery, pattern interpretation, syndrome identification, syndrome\ntype identification, and syndrome type classification. A software package\ncalled Lantern is developed to support the application of the method. The\nmethod is illustrated using a data set on Vascular Mild Cognitive Impairment\n(VMCI).\n  Conclusions: A data-driven method for TCM syndrome identification and\nclassification is presented. The method can be used to answer the following\nquestions about a Western medicine disease: What TCM syndrome types are there\namong the patients with the disease?

We experimentally study the achievable speedup in a\nreal-world scenario by applying the adaptive decision rule to a readout of the\nnitrogen-vacancy-center (NV-center) charge state. We find a speedup of $\\approx\n2$ with our experimental parameters. In addition, we propose a simple readout\nscheme for which the speedup can, in principle, be increased without bound as\nthe fidelity is increased.

IsoRank is one of the first global network alignment\nalgorithms [4, 5, 6], where the goal is to match all (or most) of the nodes of\ntwo PPI networks. The IsoRank algorithm first computes a pairwise node\nsimilarity metric, and then generates a matching between the two node sets\nbased on this metric. The metric is a convex combination of a structural\nsimilarity score (with weight $ \\alpha $) and an extraneous amino-acid sequence\nsimilarity score for two proteins (with weight $ 1 - \\alpha $). In this short\npaper, we make two contributions. First, we show that when IsoRank similarity\ndepends only on network structure ($\\alpha = 1$), the similarity of two nodes\nis only a function of their degrees. In other words, IsoRank similarity is\ninvariant to any network rewiring that does not affect the node degrees. This\nresult suggests a reason for the poor performance of IsoRank in structure-only\n($ \\alpha = 1 $) alignment. Second, using ideas from [7, 8], we develop an\napproximation algorithm that outperforms IsoRank (including recent versions\nwith better scaling, e.g., [9]) by several orders of magnitude in time and\nmemory complexity, despite only a negligible loss in precision.\n","Comment: 8 pages and 1 figure"]}]

Due to breaking time reversal symmetry, magnetic impurities\nare detrimental to superconductivity, yet microscopically how they affect the\npairing strength and phase coherence in a real material is less understood.\nRecently we observed a robust zero-energy bound state at an interstitial Fe\nimpurity (IFI) in superconducting Fe1+x(Te,Se), signifying intense impurity\nscattering. Here we report a comprehensive study, using scanning tunnelling\nmicroscopy/spectroscopy (STM/S) technique, of the global effects of IFIs on the\nground state of Fe1+x(Te,Se) over a wide range of IFI concentration x. Our high\nresolution tunnelling spectroscopy and quasi-particle interference data at very\nlow temperature demonstrate that IFIs hardly affect the electron pairing\nstrength, while they cause significant decoherence of Cooper pairs in\nprecedence of the Coulomb correlation, eventually driving the ground state of\nthe system from strong-coupling-superconductor to diffusive-metal with\nincoherent electron pairs.\n","Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to incomplete\n  discussion of the current data, the interpretation of the data need to be\n  further improved"]}]

By\nusing 3-D DWT and a proposed adaptive measurement scheme called AMS at the\nencoder, one can succeed in improving the compression ratio and reducing the\ncomplexity of the decoder. The proposed video codec uses only 7% of the total\nnumber of multipliers needed in a conventional CS-based video coding system. A\ncodebook of Bernoulli matrices with different sizes corresponding to the\npredefined sparsity levels is maintained at both the encoder and the decoder.\nBased on the calculated l0-norm of the input vector, one of the sixteen\npossible Bernoulli matrices will be selected for taking the CS measurements and\nits index will be transmitted along with the measurements. Based on this index,\nthe corresponding Bernoulli matrix has been used in CS reconstruction algorithm\nto get back the high-frequency wavelet sub-bands at the decoder.

Koopman spectral analysis is a theoretical\ntool for the analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems. Moreover, Koopman is\nintimately connected to Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), a method that\ndiscovers spatial-temporal coherent modes from data, connects local-linear\nanalysis to nonlinear operator theory, and importantly creates an equation-free\narchitecture allowing investigation of complex systems. In actuated systems,\nstandard Koopman analysis and DMD are incapable of producing input-output\nmodels; moreover, the dynamics and the modes will be corrupted by external\nforcing. Our new theoretical developments extend Koopman operator theory to\nallow for systems with nonlinear input-output characteristics. We show how this\ngeneralization is rigorously connected and generalizes a recent development\ncalled Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (DMDc). We demonstrate this new\ntheory on nonlinear dynamical systems, including a standard\nSusceptible-Infectious-Recovered model with relevance to the analysis of\ninfectious disease data with mass vaccination (actuation).\n","Comment: 21 pages, 3 figures"]}]
