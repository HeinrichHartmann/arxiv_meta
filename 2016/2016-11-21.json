The measurements are carried out using a novel scheme to\nintegrate the two-way coupling between the particle and the incompressible\nsurrounding fluid flow maintained in a high-Reynolds-number turbulent regime.\nThe main idea consists in combining a Fourier pseudo-spectral method for the\nfluid with an immersed-boundary technique to impose the no-slip boundary\ncondition on the surface of the particle. Benchmarking of the code shows a good\nagreement with experimental and numerical measurements from other groups. A\nstudy of the turbulent wake downstream the sphere is also reported. The mean\nvelocity deficit is shown to behave as the inverse of the distance from the\nparticle, as predicted from classical similarity analysis. This law is\nreinterpreted in terms of the principle of \"permanence of large eddies\" that\nrelates infrared asymptotic self-similarity to the law of decay of energy in\nhomogeneous turbulence.\n  The developed method is then used to attack the problem of an upstream flow\nthat is in a developed turbulent regime. It is shown that the average drag\nforce increases as a function of the turbulent intensity and the particle\nReynolds number. This increase is significantly larger than predicted by\nstandard drag correlations based on laminar upstream flows. It is found that\nthe relevant parameter is the ratio of the viscous boundary layer thickness to\nthe dissipation scale of the ambient turbulent flow. The drag enhancement can\nbe motivated by the modification of the mean velocity and pressure profile\naround the sphere by small scale turbulent fluctuations.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 22 figures"]}]

The idea is to investigate the dynamics of reservoir\nneurons with time-series analysis techniques taken from research on complex\nsystems. Notably, we analyze time-series of neuron activations with Recurrence\nPlots (RPs) and Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA), which permit to\nvisualize and characterize high-dimensional dynamical systems. We show that\nthis approach is useful in a number of ways. First, the two-dimensional\nrepresentation offered by RPs provides a way for visualizing the\nhigh-dimensional dynamics of a reservoir. Our results suggest that, if the\nnetwork is stable, reservoir and input denote similar line patterns in the\nrespective RPs. Conversely, the more unstable the ESN, the more the RP of the\nreservoir presents instability patterns. As a second result, we show that the\n$\\mathrm{L_{max}}$ measure is highly correlated with the well-established\nmaximal local Lyapunov exponent. This suggests that complexity measures based\non RP diagonal lines distribution provide a valuable tool to quantify the\ndegree of network stability. Finally, our analysis shows that all RQA measures\nfluctuate on the proximity of the so-called edge of stability, where an ESN\ntypically achieves maximum computational capability. We verify that the\ndetermination of the edge of stability provided by such RQA measures is more\naccurate than two well-known criteria based on the Jacobian matrix of the\nreservoir.

The immediate advantage of gathering efficient individuals in an\nenergetic context is not clear. Although this process increases relatedness\namong individuals, it also increases local competition. To address this\nquestion, we propose a model of two competing metabolic strategies that makes\nexplicit reference to the resource usage. We assume the existence of an\nefficient strain, which converts resource into energy at high efficiency but\ndisplays a low rate of resource consumption, and an inefficient strain, which\nconsumes resource at a high rate with a low efficiency in converting it to\nenergy. We explore the dynamics in both well-mixed and structured populations.\nThe selection for optimised energy usage is measured by the likelihood of that\nan efficient strain can invade a population only comprised by inefficient\nstrains. It is found that the region of the parameter space at which the\nefficient strain can thrive in structured populations is always larger than\nobserved in well-mixed populations. In fact, in well-mixed populations the\nefficient strain is only evolutionarily stable in the domain whereupon there is\nno evolutionary dilemma. We also observe that small group sizes enhance the\nchance of invasion by the efficient strain in spite of increasing the\ncompetition among relatives.

To analyze the entire genome, each of the\nbillions of short reads must be mapped to a reference genome based on the\nsimilarity between a read and \"candidate\" locations in that reference genome.\nThe similarity measurement, called alignment, formulated as an approximate\nstring matching problem, is the computational bottleneck because: (1) it is\nimplemented using quadratic-time dynamic programming algorithms, and (2) the\nmajority of candidate locations in the reference genome do not align with a\ngiven read due to high dissimilarity. Calculating the alignment of such\nincorrect candidate locations consumes an overwhelming majority of a modern\nread mapper's execution time. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a fast and\neffective filter that can detect incorrect candidate locations and eliminate\nthem before using computationally costly alignment operations. Results: We\npropose GateKeeper, a new hardware accelerator that functions as a\npre-alignment step that quickly filters out most incorrect candidate locations.\nGateKeeper is the first design to accelerate pre-alignment using\nField-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), which can perform pre-alignment much\nfaster than software. GateKeeper can be integrated with any mapper that\nperforms sequence alignment for verification. When implemented on a single FPGA\nchip, GateKeeper maintains high accuracy (on average >96%) while providing up\nto 105-fold and 215-fold speedup over the state-of-the-art software\npre-alignment techniques, Adjacency Filter and Shifted Hamming Distance (SHD),\nrespectively.

Previous studies have shown that, while DM models can\nreproduce the spectral properties of the radio halo in the Coma cluster, they\nfail in reproducing the shape of the radio halo surface brightness because they\nproduce a shape that is too concentrated towards the center of the cluster with\nrespect to the observed one. However, in previous studies the DM distribution\nwas modeled as a single spherically symmetric halo, while the DM distribution\nin Coma is found to have a complex and elongated shape. In this work we\ncalculate a range of non-thermal emissions in the Coma cluster by using the\nobserved distribution of DM sub-halos. We find that, by including the observed\nsub-halos in the DM model, we obtain a radio surface brightness with a shape\nsimilar to the observed one, and that the sub-halos boost the radio emission by\na factor between 5 and 20%, thus allowing to reduce the gap between the\nannihilation cross section required to reproduce the radio halo flux and the\nupper limits derived from other observations, and that this gap can be\nexplained by realistic values of the boosting factor due to smaller\nsubstructures. Models with neutralino mass of 9 GeV and composition $\\tau^+\n\\tau^-$, and mass of 43 GeV and composition $b \\bar b$ can fit the radio halo\nspectrum using the observed properties of the magnetic field in Coma, and do\nnot predict a gamma-ray emission in excess compared to the recent Fermi-LAT\nupper limits.

MERA also shares many deep relationships with the AdS/CFT\n(gauge-gravity) correspondence by realizing a UV complete holographic duality\nwithin the tensor networks framework. Motivated by this, we have re-purposed\nthe MERA tensor network as an analysis tool to study the real-time evolution of\nthe 1D transverse Ising model in its low energy excited state sector. We\nperformed this analysis by allowing the ancilla qubits of the MERA tensor\nnetwork to acquire quantum fluctuations, which yields a unitary transform\nbetween the physical (boundary) and ancilla qubit (bulk) Hilbert spaces. This\nthen defines a reversible quantum circuit which is used as a `holographic\ntransform' to study excited states and their real-time dynamics from the point\nof the bulk ancillae. In the gapped paramagnetic phase of the transverse field\nIsing model, we demonstrate the holographic duality between excited states\ninduced by single spin-flips (Ising `magnons') acting on the ground state and\nsingle ancilla qubit spin-flips. The single ancillae qubit excitation is shown\nto be stable in the bulk under real-time evolution and hence defines a stable\nholographic quasiparticle which we have named the `hologron'. The `dictionary'\nbetween the bulk and boundary is determined and realizes many features of the\nholographic correspondence in a non-CFT limit of the boundary theory.

We also found that the class IV dendrites are dense (assayed with\nthe fractal dimension) and uniform (assayed with the lacunarity) throughout the\nlarval stages. To understand how the class IV neuron maintains its morphology\nduring larval development, we constructed a mathematical model based on random\nbranching and self-avoidance.

To overcome this problem, in 2010 the National Center for Biomedical\nOntology (NCBO) released the Ontology Recommender, which is a service that\nreceives a biomedical text corpus or a list of keywords and suggests ontologies\nappropriate for referencing the indicated terms. We developed a new version of\nthe NCBO Ontology Recommender.

Our evaluation shows that the enhanced recommender provides\nhigher quality suggestions than the original approach, providing better\ncoverage of the input data, more detailed information about their concepts,\nincreased specialization for the domain of the input data, and greater\nacceptance and use in the community.

Large multi-site datasets\nincrease sample sizes to compensate for this complexity, at the cost of\nuncontrolled heterogeneity. This heterogeneity raises new challenges, akin to\nthose face in realistic diagnostic applications. Here, we demonstrate the\nfeasibility of inter-site classification of neuropsychiatric status, with an\napplication to the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database, a large\n(N=871) multi-site autism dataset. For this purpose, we investigate pipelines\nthat extract the most predictive biomarkers from the data. These R-fMRI\npipelines build participant-specific connectomes from functionally-defined\nbrain areas. Connectomes are then compared across participants to learn\npatterns of connectivity that differentiate typical controls from individuals\nwith autism. We predict this neuropsychiatric status for participants from the\nsame acquisition sites or different, unseen, ones. Good choices of methods for\nthe various steps of the pipeline lead to 67% prediction accuracy on the full\nABIDE data, which is significantly better than previously reported results. We\nperform extensive validation on multiple subsets of the data defined by\ndifferent inclusion criteria. These enables detailed analysis of the factors\ncontributing to successful connectome-based prediction. First, prediction\naccuracy improves as we include more subjects, up to the maximum amount of\nsubjects available. Second, the definition of functional brain areas is of\nparamount importance for biomarker discovery: brain areas extracted from large\nR-fMRI datasets outperform reference atlases in the classification tasks.\n","Comment: in NeuroImage, Elsevier, 2016"]}]

In this paper we present architecture of fast and reconfigurable\nPacket Classification Engine (PCE). This engine is used in FPGA-based firewall.\nOur PCE inspects multi-dimensional field of packet header sequentially based on\ntree-based algorithm. This algorithm simplifies overall system to a lower scale\nand leads to a more secure system. The PCE works with an adaptation of single\ncycle processor architecture in the system. Ethernet packet is examined with\nPCE based on Source IP Address, Destination IP Address, Source Port,\nDestination Port, and Protocol fields of the packet header. These are basic\nfields to know whether it is a dangerous or normal packet before inspecting the\ncontent. Using implementation of tree-based algorithm in the architecture,\nfirewall rules are rebuilt into 24-bit sub-rules which are read as processor\ninstruction in the inspection process. The inspection process is comparing one\nsub-rule with input field of header every clock cycle. The proposed PCE shows\n91 MHz clock frequency in Cyclone II EP2C70F896C6 with 13 clocks throughput\naverage from input to output generation.

Therefore, a\nvariety of methods were introduced to overcome this limitation. In the paper we\nfocus on methods based on so called inducing inputs. This approach is based on\nvariational inference and proposes a particular lower bound for marginal\nlikelihood (evidence).

The unique challenge of TaaS is that it must satisfy a\nwide range of customers who have no experience and resources to tune DL\nhyper-parameters, and meticulous tuning for each user's dataset is\nprohibitively expensive. Therefore, TaaS hyper-parameters must be fixed with\nvalues that are applicable to all users. IBM Watson Natural Language Classifier\n(NLC) service, the most popular IBM cognitive service used by thousands of\nenterprise-level clients around the globe, is a typical TaaS service. By\nevaluating the NLC workloads, we show that only the conservative\nhyper-parameter setup (e.g., small mini-batch size and small learning rate) can\nguarantee acceptable model accuracy for a wide range of customers. We further\njustify theoretically why such a setup guarantees better model convergence in\ngeneral. Unfortunately, the small mini-batch size causes a high volume of\ncommunication traffic in a parameter-server based system. We characterize the\nhigh communication bandwidth requirement of TaaS using representative\nindustrial deep learning workloads and demonstrate that none of the\nstate-of-the-art scale-up or scale-out solutions can satisfy such a\nrequirement. We then present GaDei, an optimized shared-memory based scale-up\nparameter server design. We prove that the designed protocol is deadlock-free\nand it processes each gradient exactly once. Our implementation is evaluated on\nboth commercial benchmarks and public benchmarks to demonstrate that it\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art parameter-server based\nimplementation while maintaining the required accuracy and our implementation\nreaches near the best possible runtime performance, constrained only by the\nhardware limitation. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, GaDei is the\nonly scale-up DL system that provides fault-tolerance.\n"]}]

In\nthis paper, we give a rigorous treatment of structural causal models, dealing\nwith measure-theoretic complications that arise in the presence of cyclic\nrelations. The central question studied in this paper is: given a (possibly\ncyclic) SCM defined on a large system (consisting of observable endogenous and\nlatent exogenous variables), can we \"project it down\" to an SCM that describes\na subsystem (consisting of a subset of the observed endogenous variables and\npossibly different latent exogenous variables) in order to obtain a more\nparsimonious but equivalent representation of the subsystem? We define a\nmarginalization operation that effectively removes a subset of the endogenous\nvariables from the model, and a class of mappings, exogenous\nreparameterizations, that can be used to reduce the space of exogenous\nvariables. We show that both operations preserve the causal semantics of the\nmodel and that under mild conditions they can lead to a significant reduction\nof the model complexity, at least in terms of the number of variables in the\nmodel. We argue that for the task of estimating an SCM from data, the existence\nof \"smooth\" reductions would be desirable. We provide several conditions under\nwhich the existence of such reductions can be shown, but also provide a\ncounterexample that shows that such reductions do not exist in general.
