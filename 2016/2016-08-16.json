In this setting, an external inflow is\ninjected to the so-called origin nodes. The total inflow arriving at each node\nis routed locally such that none of the outgoing links are overloaded unless\nthe node receives an inflow greater than its total outgoing capacity. A link\nirreversibly fails if it is overloaded or if there is no operational link in\nits immediate downstream to carry its flow. For such systems, resilience is\ndefined as the minimum amount of reduction in the link capacities that would\nresult in the failure of all the outgoing links of an origin node. We show that\nsuch networks do not necessarily become more resilient as additional capacity\nis built in the network. Moreover, when the external inflow does not exceed the\nnetwork capacity, selective reductions of capacity at certain links can\nactually help averting the cascading failures, without requiring any change in\nthe local routing policies.

These behaviours may be closely related to the large-scale\nconfiguration of the star's magnetic field. The total torque experienced by the\npulsar comprises spin-up and spin-down contributions from different bundles of\nmagnetic field lines; the spin-down `braking' torque is applied both by closed\nstellar field lines which enter the disc beyond the corotation radius, and\nthose which are open and not loaded with disc material.

As a consequence, recent research efforts have pursued\nan asymptotic analysis in various limiting regimes, notably the central-limit\nregime (describing fluctuations around the average behavior) and the\nlarge-deviations regime (focusing on rare events). Many of these results use\nthe property that the number of customers in the system obeys a Poisson\ndistribution with a random parameter.\n  The objective of this paper is to develop techniques to accurately\napproximate tail probabilities in the large-deviations regime. We consider the\nscaling in which the arrival rates are inflated by a factor $N$, and we are\ninterested in the probability that the number of customers exceeds a given\nlevel $Na$. Where earlier contributions focused on so-called $logarithmic$\n$asymptotics$ of this exceedance probability (which are inherently imprecise),\nthe present paper improves upon those results in that $exact$ $asymptotics$ are\nestablished. These are found in two steps: first the distribution of the random\nparameter of the Poisson distribution is characterized, and then this knowledge\nis used to identify the exact asymptotics. The paper is concluded by a set of\nnumerical experiments, in which the accuracy of the asymptotic results is\nassessed.\n"]}]

We introduce a useful classification which contains 4 classes of\nmodels defined by the presence or absence of energy transfer and by the\nstationarity ($w = const.$ and $\\beta = const.$) or/and non stationarity ($w$\nor $\\beta$ time dependent) of the equations of state. It is shown that, for\ngiven $w$ and $\\beta$, the energy transfer defines $\\gamma$ and, therefore, the\ntotal gravitating mass and dynamics of the model. We study important examples\nof two-fluid FLRW models within the new classification. The behaviour of the\nenergy content, gravitating mass, pressure, and the energy transfer are given\nas functions of the scale factor. We point out three characteristic scales,\n$a_E$, $a_{\\cal P}$ and $a_{\\cal M}$, which separate periods of time in which\nquintessence energy, pressure and gravitating mass dominate. Each sequence of\nthe scales defines one of 6 evolution types.\n"]}]

We have, as a result, taken the alternative\npath of spectroscopically identifying interesting sources with the sole\ncriterion being that they are in low density areas of the g - r and r - i\ncolor-space defined by the DPOSS survey. In this paper, we present three\npeculiar broad absorption line quasars that were discovered during this\nspectroscopic survey, demonstrating the efficacy of this approach. PSS\nJ0052+2405 is an Iron LoBAL quasar at a redshift z = 2.4512 with very broad\nabsorption from many species. PSS J0141+3334 is a reddened LoBAL quasar at z =\n3.005 with no obvious emission lines. PSS J1537+1227 is a Iron LoBAL at a\nredshift of z = 1.212 with strong narrow Mgii and Feii emission. Follow-up high\nresolution spectroscopy of these three quasars promises to improve our\nunderstanding of BAL quasars.

The survey has revealed a substantial\npopulation of brown dwarfs in this southern star forming region. Candidates\nwere selected from R, I and H-alpha imaging observations. We also observed in\ntwo medium-band filters, M855 and M915, for the purpose of spectral type\ndetermination. The former filter covers a wavelength range containing spectral\nfeatures characteristic of M-dwarfs, while the latter lies in a relatively\nfeatureless wavelength region for these late-type objects. A correlation was\nfound between spectral type and (M855-M915) colour index for mid- to late\nM-type objects and early L-type dwarfs. With this method, we identify most of\nour object candidates as being of spectral type M5 or later. Our results show\nthat there is no strong drop in the number of objects for the latest spectral\ntypes, hence brown dwarfs may be as abundant as low-mass stars in this region.\nAlso, both kind of objects have a similar spatial distribution. We derive an\nindex $\\alpha = 0.6 \\pm 0.1$ of the mass function in this region of dispersed\nstar formation, in good agreement with the values obtained in other star\nforming regions and young clusters.

At smaller energies the continuum displays an excess with\nrespect to the extrapolation of this power law, called the ``soft X-ray\nexcess\". Until now it was attributed, either to reflection of the hard X-ray\nsource by the accretion disk, or to the presence of an additional comptonizing\nmedium. An alternative solution proposed by Gierli\\'nski & Done (2004) is that\na single power law represents correctly both the soft and the hard X-ray\nemission, and the soft X-ray excess is an artefact due to the absorption of the\nprimary power law by a relativistic wind. We examine the advantages and\ndrawbacks of the reflection versus absorption models. We argue that in the\nabsorption hypothesis, the absorbing medium should be in total pressure\nequilibrium, to constrain the spectral distribution which otherwise would be\ntoo strongly variable in time and from one object to the other, as compared to\nobservations. We conclude that some X-ray spectra, in particular those with\nstrong soft X-ray excesses, can be modelled by absorption in the 0.3-10 keV\nrange. However, due to the lack of a complete grid of models and good data\nextending above 10 keV, we are not able to conclude presently that all objects\ncan be accommodated with such models. These absorption models imply either\nstrong relativistic outflowing winds with mass rates of the order of the\nEddington value (or even larger), or quasi-spherical inhomogeneous accretion\nflows. Only weak excesses can be modelled by reflection, unless the primary\ncontinuum is not directly seen. Finally, a reflection model absorbed by a\nmodest relativistic wind could be the best solution to the problem.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 16 coloured figures, A&A in press"]}]

We propose a model\nin which the noise originates from a leakage current of electrons that tunnel\nthrough the Schottky barrier under the gate into the doped layer. The key to\nreducing noise is to keep this barrier opaque under experimental conditions.\nBias cooling reduces the density of ionized donors, which builds in an\neffective negative gate voltage. A smaller negative bias is therefore needed to\nreach the desired operating point. This suppresses tunnelling from the gate and\nhence the noise. The reduction in the density of ionized donors also\nstrengthens the barrier to tunneling at a given applied voltage. Support for\nthe model comes from our direct observation of the leakage current into a\nclosed quantum dot, around $10^{-20} \\mathrm{A}$ for this device.

The source of irradiation consists in highly\ncoherent VUV pulses obtained through high order harmonic generation of a high\nintensity femtosecond pulse at a 1.55 eV photon energy (titanium-doped sapphire\nlaser). Harmonics H9 to H17 have been used for photoconductivity (PC) and\nharmonics H13 to H27 for photoemission experiments (PES). As the photon energy\nis increased, it is expected that the high energy photoelectrons will generate\nsecondary e-h pairs, thus increasing the excitation density and consequently\nthe PC signal. This is not what we observe : the PC signal first increases for\nH9 to H13, but then saturates and even decreases.

Grazing Incidence Small Angle X-ray Scattering (GISAXS) and Grazing\nIncidence Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS) reveal that buried clusters\nconserve these properties, interaction with matrix atoms being limited to their\nfirst atomic layers. Considering that 60% of particle atoms are located at\nsurface, this interactions leads to a drastic change in magnetic properties\nwhich were investigated with conventional magnetometry and X-Ray Magnetic\nCircular Dichro\\\"{i}sm (XMCD). Magnetization and blocking temperature are\nweaker for clusters embedded in Nb than in MgO, and totally vanish in silicon\nas silicides are formed. Magnetic volume of clusters embedded in MgO is close\nto the crystallized volume determined by GIWAXS experiments. Cluster can be\nseen as a pure ferromagnetic CoPt crystallized core surrounded by a\ncluster-matrix mixed shell. The outer shell plays a predominant role in\nmagnetic properties, especially for clusters embedded in niobium which have a\nblocking temperature 3 times smaller than clusters embedded in MgO.\n"]}]

In the early days of\nlogic, strong normalization was usually shown by assigning ordinals to\nexpressions in such a way that eliminating a cut would yield an expression with\na smaller ordinal. In the early days of verification, computer scientists used\nsimilar ideas, interpreting the arguments of a program call by a natural\nnumber, such as their size. Showing the size of the arguments to decrease for\neach recursive call gives a termination proof of the program, which is however\nrather weak since it can only yield quite small ordinals. In the sixties, Tait\ninvented a new method for showing cut elimination of natural deduction, based\non a predicate over the set of terms, such that the membership of an expression\nto the predicate implied the strong normalization property for that expression.\nThe predicate being defined by induction on types, or even as a fixpoint, this\nmethod could yield much larger ordinals. Later generalized by Girard under the\nname of reducibility or computability candidates, it showed very effective in\nproving the strong normalization property of typed lambda-calculi...\n"]}]

Routing protocols based on a self-organized\nstructure have been studied principally for the robustness and the scalability\nthey provide. On the other hand, self-organization schemes may decrease the\nnetwork capacity since they concentrate the traffic on privileged links. This\npaper presents four models for evaluating the capacity of a routing schemes on\n802.11 like networks. Our approach consists in modeling the radio resource\nsharing principles of 802.11 like MAC protocols as a set of linear constraints.\nWe have implemented two models of fairness. The first one assumes that nodes\nhave a fair access to the channel, while the second one assumes that on the\nradio links. We then develop a pessimistic and an optimistic scenarii of\nspatial re-utilization of the medium, yielding a lower bound and an upper bound\non the network capacity for each fairness case. Our models are independent of\nthe routing protocols and provide therefore a relevant framework for their\ncomparison. We apply our models to a comparative analysis of the well-known\nshortest path base flat routing protocol OLSR against two main self-organized\nstructure approaches, VSR, and Wu & Li's protocols.

This leads us to the\nconcept of causally equivalent (or {\\em isocausal} in short) Lorentzian\nmanifolds as those mutually causally related. This concept is more general and\nof a more basic nature than the conformal relationship, because we prove the\nremarkable result that a conformal relation $\\f$ is characterized by the fact\nof being a causal relation of the {\\em particular} kind in which both $\\f$ and\n$\\f^{-1}$ are causal relations. For isocausal Lorentzian manifolds there are\none-to-one correspondences, which sometimes are non-trivial, between several\nclasses of their respective future (and past) objects. A more important feature\nof isocausal Lorentzian manifolds is that they satisfy the same causality\nconstraints. This indicates that the causal equivalence provides a possible\ncharacterization of the {\\it basic causal structure}, in the sense of mutual\ncausal compatibility, for Lorentzian manifolds. Thus, we introduce a partial\norder for the equivalence classes of isocausal Lorentzian manifolds providing a\nclassification of spacetimes in terms of their causal properties, and a\nclassification of all the causal structures that a given fixed manifold can\nhave.

In the present paper, we are able to discriminate muons from\nelectrons in Fully Contained Events with a probability of error of less than\nseveral %. At the same time, our geometrical reconstruction procedure,\nconsidering only the ring-like structure of the Cherenkov image, gives an\nunsatisfactory resolution for 1GeV electron and muon, with a mean vertex\nposition error, delta r, of 5-10 m and a mean directional error, delta theta,\nof about 6-20 degrees. In contrast, a geometrical reconstruction procedure\nutilizing the full image and using a detailed approximation of the event\nangular distribution works much better: for a 1 GeV electron, delta r is about\n2 m and delta theta is about 3 degrees; for a 1GeV muon, delta r is about 3 m\nand delta theta is about 5 degrees. At 5 GeV, the corresponding values are\nabout 1.4 m and about 2 degree for electron and are about 2.9m and about 4.3\ndegrees for muon. The numerical values depend on a single PMT contribution\nthreshold. The values quoted above are the minima with respect to this\nthreshold.\n  Even the methodologically correct approach we have adopted, based on detailed\nsimulations using closer approximations than those adopted in the SK analysis,\ncannot reproduce the accuracies for particle discrimination, momentum\nresolution, interaction vertex location, and angular resolution obtained by the\nSK simulations, suggesting the assumptions in these may be inadequate.\n","Comment: comments: 141pages, 23 figures,latex"]}]

The color neutralization (or production) length for\nleading hadrons is controlled by coherence, energy conservation and Sudakov\nsuppression. The pT-broadening is a sensitive and model independent probe for\nthe production length. The color neutralization time is expected to shrink with\nrising hard scale.

In the present paper, these tools are\nfurther developed in several directions such as: (i) causal mappings --and,\nthus, abstract chronological ones-- do not preserve two levels of the standard\nhierarchy of causality conditions (however, they preserve the remaining levels\nas shown in the above reference), (ii) even though global hyperbolicity is a\nstable property (in the set of all time-oriented Lorentzian metrics on a fixed\nmanifold), the causal structure of a globally hyperbolic spacetime can be\nunstable against perturbations; in fact, we show that the causal structures of\nMinkowski and Einstein static spacetimes remain stable, whereas that of de\nSitter becomes unstable, (iii) general criteria allow us to discriminate\ndifferent causal structures in some general spacetimes (e.g. globally\nhyperbolic, stationary standard); in particular, there are infinitely many\ndifferent globally hyperbolic causal structures (and thus, different conformal\nones) on $\\R^2$, (iv) plane waves with the same number of positive eigenvalues\nin the frequency matrix share the same causal structure and, thus, they have\nequal causal extensions and causal boundaries.\n","Comment: 33 pages, 9 figures, final version (the paper title has been\n  changed).

The chain gains an\nenergetic factor for every monomer it puts in the oil and receives a random\nprice of positive average each time it touches the origin.

As usual a\ncritical curve divides the phase spaces in a localized and a delocalized area,\nand the point of my paper is to develop a new strategy to bound this critical\ncurve by below.

In studies of ``functional\ndata analysis,'' it has often been assumed that a sample of random functions is\nobserved precisely, in the continuum and without noise. While this has been the\ntraditional setting for functional data analysis, in the context of\nlongitudinal data analysis a random function typically represents a patient, or\nsubject, who is observed at only a small number of randomly distributed points,\nwith nonnegligible measurement error.

In this paper we answer that question.

The friction between both spheres infers heat, which is the cause\nof the melted iron which constitutes most of the liquid outer core, as well as\nthe source of the global heat flow. The solid inner core angular velocity is\nsupposed to remain steady, while the mantle angular velocity depends on\ngyroscopic forces (involving acceleration) and slowing down due to external\nattractions and, principally the motions of mantle plates 2900 km thick. The\nvariations of the geomagnetic field are therefore the direct consequence of the\nvariations of the angular velocity of the mantle relative to that of the inner\ncore. As a result, the biological and tectonic evolutions during geological\ntimes are due to those phenomena. So, the limits of eras coincide exactly with\nthe passage to zero of the geomagnetic field.

Because of the finite velocity of ionic charge\nmovement, this polarization will not be instantaneous. Consequently, the\ninduced electric field will be frequency-dependent, and much reduced for high\nfrequencies. Our model establishes that with respect to frequency attenuation\nproperties, this situation is analogous to an equivalent RC-circuit, or better\na system of coupled RC-circuits. We present a number of numerical simulations\nof induced electric field for biologically realistic values of parameters, and\nshow this frequency filtering effect as well as the attenuation of\nextracellular potentials with distance. We suggest that induced electric fields\nin passive cells surrounding neurons is the physical origin of frequency\nfiltering properties of LFPs.\n","Comment: 10 figs, revised tex file and revised figs"]}]

Comparative two-dimensional gel analysis of the\nmonocyte, immature DC, and mature DC stages was performed. Manganese superoxide\ndismutase (Mn-SOD) reached 0.7% of the gel-displayed proteins at the mature DC\nstage. This important amount of Mn-SOD is a primary antioxidant defense system\nagainst superoxide radicals, but its product, H(2)O(2), is also deleterious for\ncells.

The set of optimal EWs for two well-known\nentanglement based (EB) schemes, the 6-state and the 4-state EB protocols, has\nbeen obtained recently [M. Curty et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 217903 (2004)].\nHere we complete these results, now showing specifically the analysis for the\ncase of prepare&measure (P&M) schemes. For this, we investigate the signal\nstates and detection methods of the 4-state and the 2-state P&M schemes. For\neach of these protocols we obtain a reduced set of EWs. More importantly, each\nset of EWs can be used to derive a necessary and sufficient condition to prove\nthat quantum correlations are present in these protocols.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 1 figure"]}]

This is a quantum interference effect, which occurs because the\ntwo possible paths where the photons leave in different output ports interfere\ndestructively. This effect was first observed in parametric downconversion by\nHong, Ou and Mandel, and then with single photons produced one after the other\nby the same quantum emitter. With the recent development of quantum\ninformation, a lot of attention has been devoted to this coalescence effect as\na resource for quantum data processing using linear optics techniques. To\nensure the scalability of schemes based on these ideas, it is crucial that\nindistinguishable photons are emitted by a collection of synchronized, but\notherwise independent sources. In this paper, we demonstrate the quantum\ninterference of two single photons emitted by two independently trapped single\natoms, bridging the gap towards the simultaneous emission of many\nindistinguishable single photons by different emitters. Our data analysis shows\nthat the coalescence observed is mostly limited by the wavefront matching of\nthe light emitted by the two atoms, and to a lesser extent by the motion of\neach atom in its own trap.\n"]}]

The detection of this essential quantum\nfeature requires a quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement repeated many times\nduring the system evolution. Quantum jumps of trapped massive particles\n(electrons, ions or molecules) have been observed, which is not the case of the\njumps of light quanta. Usual photodetectors absorb light and are thus unable to\ndetect the same photon twice. They must be replaced by a transparent counter\n'seeing' photons without destroying them3. Moreover, the light has to be stored\nover a duration much longer than the QND detection time. We have fulfilled\nthese challenging conditions and observed photon number quantum jumps.\nMicrowave photons are stored in a superconducting cavity for times in the\nsecond range. They are repeatedly probed by a stream of non-absorbing atoms. An\natom interferometer measures the atomic dipole phase shift induced by the\nnon-resonant cavity field, so that the final atom state reveals directly the\npresence of a single photon in the cavity. Sequences of hundreds of atoms\nhighly correlated in the same state, are interrupted by sudden\nstate-switchings.
