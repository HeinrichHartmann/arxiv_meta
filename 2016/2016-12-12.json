For many practical flows, the turbulence models are by\nfar the largest source of uncertainty. In this work we develop an open-box,\nphysics-informed Bayesian framework for quantifying model-form uncertainties in\nRANS simulations. Uncertainties are introduced directly to the Reynolds\nstresses and are represented with compact parameterization accounting for\nempirical prior knowledge and physical constraints (e.g., realizability,\nsmoothness, and symmetry). An iterative ensemble Kalman method is used to\nassimilate the prior knowledge and observation data in a Bayesian framework,\nand to propagate them to posterior distributions of velocities and other\nQuantities of Interest (QoIs). We use two representative cases, the flow over\nperiodic hills and the flow in a square duct, to evaluate the performance of\nthe proposed framework. Simulation results suggest that, even with very sparse\nobservations, the posterior mean velocities and other QoIs have significantly\nbetter agreement with the benchmark data compared to the baseline results. At\nmost locations the posterior distribution adequately captures the true model\nerror within the developed model form uncertainty bounds. The framework is a\nmajor improvement over existing black-box, physics-neutral methods for\nmodel-form uncertainty quantification, where prior knowledge and details of the\nmodels are not exploited. This approach has potential implications in many\nfields in which the governing equations are well understood but the model\nuncertainty comes from unresolved physical processes.\n","Comment: 53 pages, 15 figures"]}]

These latter states can be\nregarded as the epitome of a glass since they are out of equilibrium, maximally\ndisordered, hyperuniform, mechanically rigid with infinite bulk and shear\nmoduli, and can never crystallize due to configuration-space trapping. Our\nmodel perfect glass utilizes two-, three-, and four-body soft interactions\nwhile simultaneously retaining the salient attributes of the MRJ state. These\nmodels constitute a theoretical proof of concept for perfect glasses and\nbroaden our fundamental understanding of glass physics. A novel feature of\nequilibrium systems of identical particles interacting with the perfect-glass\npotential at positive temperature is that they have a non-relativistic speed of\nsound that is infinite.\n"]}]

Low Rayleigh number leads\nto strong axial dipole contribution while the axial dipole dominance is lost\nwhen the convective driving is too strong.

The\nsecond factor is the convective magnetic Reynolds number profile Rmc(r), a\nproduct of the non-axisymmetric flow velocity and electrical conductivity.

Traditional\nhand segmentation approaches rely on a large corpus of manually labeled data to\ngenerate robust hand detectors. However, these approaches still face challenges\nas the appearance of the hand varies greatly across users, tasks, environments\nor illumination conditions. A key observation in the case of many wearable\napplications and interfaces is that, it is only necessary to accurately detect\nthe user's hands in a specific situational context. Based on this observation,\nwe introduce an interactive approach to learn a person-specific hand\nsegmentation model that does not require any manually labeled training data.\nOur approach proceeds in two steps, an interactive bootstrapping step for\nidentifying moving hand regions, followed by learning a personalized user\nspecific hand appearance model. Concretely, our approach uses two convolutional\nneural networks: (1) a gesture network that uses pre-defined motion information\nto detect the hand region; and (2) an appearance network that learns a person\nspecific model of the hand region based on the output of the gesture network.\nDuring training, to make the appearance network robust to errors in the gesture\nnetwork, the loss function of the former network incorporates the confidence of\nthe gesture network while learning. Experiments demonstrate the robustness of\nour approach with an F1 score over 0.8 on all challenging datasets across a\nwide range of illumination and hand appearance variations, improving over a\nbaseline approach by over 10%.\n"]}]

MmWave systems usually require large\nantenna arrays to achieve satisfactory performance and thus, they cannot\nsupport fully digital transceiver designs due to high demands in hardware\ncomplexity and power consumption. Thus, in order to develop efficient\nsolutions, the proposed approaches are based on a hybrid analog-digital\npre-coding architecture. In such hybrid designs, the overall beamformer can be\nfactorized in a low dimensional digital counterpart applied in the baseband and\nin an analog one applied in the RF domain. The first cognitive solution\ndeveloped in this paper designs the cognitive hybrid pre-coder by maximizing\nthe mutual information between its two ends subject to interference, power and\nhardware constraints related to the analog counterpart. The second solution\naims at reduced complexity requirements and thus derives the hybrid pre-coder\nby minimizing the Frobenious norm of its difference to the optimal digital only\none. A novel solution for the post-coder at the cognitive receiver part is\nfurther proposed here based on a hardware constrained Minimum Mean Square Error\ncriterion. Simulations show that the performance of both the proposed hybrid\napproaches is very close to the one of the fully digital solution for typical\nwireless environments.\n","Comment: Millimeter wave (mmWave), Cognitive Radio, Multiple-Input\n  Multiple-Output (MIMO), Large-scale antenna arrays, Hybrid Pre-coding,\n  Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)"]}]

The celebrated quantum Rabi model describes the simplest\ninteraction of a two-level system with a single-mode boson field. When the\ncoupling is arbitrary large, the bare multilevel structure of a realistic\ncircuit atom cannot be ignored even if the circuit is strongly anharmonic. We\nexplored this situation theoretically for flux (fluxonium) and charge (Cooper\npair box) type multi-level circuit atoms at maximal frustration and identified\nwhich spectral features of the quantum Rabi model survive and which are\nrenormalized for arbitrary large coupling. We provide a quantitative comparison\nwith the ideal quantum Rabi model by inspecting not only the circuit energy\nlevel spectrum, but also the entanglement spectrum. Despite significant\nrenormalization of the low-energy energy spectrum in the fluxonium case, the\nkey quantum Rabi feature -- nearly-degenerate vacuum consisting of an atomic\nstate entangled with a multi-photon field -- appears in both circuits when the\ncoupling is sufficiently large. Like in the quantum Rabi model, for very large\ncouplings the entanglement spectrum is dominated by only two, nearly equal\neigenvalues, in spite of the fact that a large number of bare atomic states are\nactually involved in the ground state. We interpret the emergence of the vacuum\ndegeneracy in both circuits as an environmental suppression of flux/charge\ntunneling due to their dressing by virtual low-/high-impedance photons in the\nresonator. For flux tunneling, the dressing is nothing else than the shunting\nof a Josephson atom with a large capacitance of the resonator.

Typically, bandgap analyses and predictions rely on the assumption\nof traveling waves in an infinite medium, and do not take advantage of modal\nrepresentations typically used for the analysis of the dynamic behavior of\nfinite structures. Recently, we developed a method for understanding the\nlocally resonant bandgap in uniform finite metamaterial beams using modal\nanalysis.

Using this approach, along with the assumption of an infinite\nnumber of resonators tuned to the same frequency, the frequency range of the\nlocally resonant bandgap is easily derived in closed form. Furthermore, the\nbandgap expression is shown to be the same regardless of the type of vibration\nproblem under consideration, depending only on the added mass ratio and target\nfrequency. It is shown that the number of resonators required for the bandgap\nto appear increases with the target frequency range, i.e. respective modal\nneighborhood. Furthermore, it is observed that there is an optimal, finite\nnumber of resonators which gives a bandgap that is wider than the\ninfinite-absorber bandgap, and that the optimal number of resonators increases\nwith target frequency and added mass ratio. As the number of resonators becomes\nsufficiently large, the bandgap converges to the derived infinite-absorber\nbandgap.
