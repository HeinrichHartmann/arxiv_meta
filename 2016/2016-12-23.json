It is expected that\nthe observed radiations near the Galactic Center cannot be generated by the\ncentral black hole.\n  We also demonstrate that the observed ultra-strong radial magnetic field near\nthe Galactic Center ( Eatough et al., 2013) cannot be generated by the -\nturbulence dynamo mechanism of Parker since preliminary qualitative estimate in\nterms of this mechanism gives a magnetic field strength six orders of magnitude\nsmaller than the observed field strength at . However, both these difficulties\nor the dilemma of the standard model can be overcome if the central black hole\nin the standard model is replaced by a supper-massive stellar object containing\nmagnetic monopoles ( SMSOMM, Peng and Chou, 2001). The observed power peaking\nof the thermal radiation is essentially the same as our theoretical prediction.\nIn addition, the discovery of the ultra-strong radial magnetic field near the\nGalactic Center can be naturally explained and is consistent with the\nprediction of our model( Peng and Chou 2001). Furthermore, the observed\nultra-strong radial magnetic field in the vicinity of the Galactic Center may\nbe considered as the astronomical evidence for the existence of magnetic\nmonopoles as predicted by the Grand Unified Theory of particle physics.\n","Comment: 11 pages, Accepted for publication in Astrophysics and Space Science.\n  arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1404.0677 by other authors"]}]

In this paper, we proposed a novel way to extract image\nrepresentations from two consecutive convolutional layers: one layer is\nutilized for local feature extraction and the other serves as guidance to pool\nthe extracted features. By taking different viewpoints of convolutional layers,\nwe further develop two schemes to realize this idea. The first one directly\nuses convolutional layers from a DCNN. The second one applies the pretrained\nCNN on densely sampled image regions and treats the fully-connected activations\nof each image region as convolutional feature activations. We then train\nanother convolutional layer on top of that as the pooling-guidance\nconvolutional layer. By applying our method to three popular visual\nclassification tasks, we find our first scheme tends to perform better on the\napplications which need strong discrimination on subtle object patterns within\nsmall regions while the latter excels in the cases that require discrimination\non category-level patterns.

However, the quantification of this\ninformation when it comes to complex networks has remained largely elusive. In\nthis work, we use techniques inspired by quantum statistical mechanics to\ndefine an entropy measure for complex networks and to develop a set of\ninformation-theoretic tools, based on network spectral properties, such as\nRenyi q-entropy, generalized Kullback-Leibler and Jensen-Shannon divergences,\nthe latter allowing us to define a natural distance measure between complex\nnetworks. First we show that by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence\nbetween an observed network and a parametric network model, inference of model\nparameter(s) by means of maximum-likelihood estimation can be achieved and\nmodel selection can be performed appropriate information criteria. Second, we\nshow that the information-theoretic metric quantifies the distance between\npairs of networks and we can use it, for instance, to cluster the layers of a\nmultilayer system. By applying this framework to networks corresponding to\nsites of the human microbiome, we perform hierarchical cluster analysis and\nrecover with high accuracy existing community-based associations.

However, DBA may harden the beam and cause artifacts and errors.\nThis work investigates positive and negative effects of using DBA in PCCT.\nMethods: A simple PCCT with single energy bin, spectroscopic PCCT with 2 and 5\nenergy bins, and conventional energy integrating CT with and without DBA were\nsimulated and investigated using 120kVp tube voltage and 14mGy air dose.

The artifacts and errors were decreased with 2bin\nspectroscopic PCCT and nearly eliminated with 5bin spectroscopic CT.

To this aim we put forward a quantitative\ngeneralization of the WEP, which applies also to quantum systems, while\nmaintaining the physical content of its classical formulation. Our formulation\nof the WEP is information-theoretic in nature, and requires that information\nabout the mass of a probe, as obtained from position measurements, cannot\nincrease in the presence of a gravitational field. More precisely, the\ngeneralized WEP states that the Fisher information of position measurements\ncannot increase in the presence of gravity, compared to its value for a free\nprobe. Our results show that while in a uniform field quantum probes satisfy\nthe WEP exactly, gravity gradients may encode nontrivial information about the\nmass in the particle's wavefunction, thus leading to violations of the WEP. We\nconclude that the WEP is untenable for a quantum particle described by a\nwavefunction, which rather behaves in analogy with a classical extended object.\n"]}]

The\nfirst one uses restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and the second one\nautoencoders. RBMs are stacked in layers to form deep belief network (DBN); the\nfinal representation layer is attached to the target to complete the deep\nneural network. Autoencoders are nested one inside the other to form stacked\nautoencoders; once the stcaked autoencoder is learnt the decoder portion is\ndetached and the target attached to the deepest layer of the encoder to form\nthe deep neural network. This work proposes a new approach to train deep neural\nnetworks using dictionary learning as the basic building block; the idea is to\nuse the features from the shallower layer as inputs for training the next\ndeeper layer. One can use any type of dictionary learning (unsupervised,\nsupervised, discriminative etc.) as basic units till the pre-final layer. In\nthe final layer one needs to use the label consistent dictionary learning\nformulation for classification. We compare our proposed framework with existing\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques on benchmark problems; we are always\nwithin the top 10 results.

However,\nthe microscopic role of oxygen in the write-erase process, i.e., the reversible\nphase transition between crystalline and amorphous state of phase-change\nmaterials is not clear yet. Using oxygen doped GeTe as an example, this work\nunravels the role of oxygen at the atomic scale by means of ab initio total\nenergy calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our main\nfinding is that after the amorphization and the subsequent re-crystallization\nprocess simulated by ab initio molecular dynamics, oxygen will drag one Ge atom\nout of its lattice site and both atoms stay in the interstitial region near the\nTe vacancy that was originally occupied by the oxygen, forming a\n\"dumbbell-like\" defect (O-VTe-Ge), which is in sharp contrast to the results of\nab initio total energy calculations at 0 K showing that the oxygen prefers to\nsubstitute Te in crystalline GeTe. This specific defect configuration is found\nto be responsible for the slower crystallization speed and hence the improved\ndata retention of oxygen doped GeTe as reported in recent experimental work.\nMoreover, we find that the oxygen will increase the effective mass of the\ncarrier and thus increases the resistivity of GeTe.

However, all the astronomical answers have detailed\nrefutations, and general disproofs, so all the astronomical answers for the\nStar are dead.\n  In 1999, Michael Molnar put forth a completely new solution, where the Star\noriginated as a report of a natal horoscope for 17 April 6 BC. This natal\nhoroscope shows very impressive regal portents and points to Judea. It is very\nimprobable that such a very rare planet configuration (averaging only once per\nmillennium or longer) would coincide with the very restricted day of Jesus'\nbirth (springtime in a year shortly before Herod's death in 4 BC), unless there\nis some causal connection. The Magi (as labeled by the gospel author) were\nastrologers, so they were only interested in horoscopes. The astrological\nsolution is further supported by the presence of an astrological technical term\n('in the east' meaning what astronomers call the 'heliacal rise') in the\nNativity narrative of Matthew. Importantly, Molnar has only identified the Star\nas originating from a particular natal horoscope, while making no statement\nabout the nature or historicity of any of the other elements of the story in\nMatthew. So for example, the Magi might be astrologers as idealized by the\nGreeks of the time, or they might have been non-existent (invented by a\nlatter-day Greek seeking omens for the birth of a great king), and they might\nhave arrived on 17 April 6 BC or months later, and they might or might not have\nbeen three in numbers with given names.

A nice and intuitive reconstruction by Linear Programming has been\nadvocated since 80-ies by Dave Donoho and his collaborators. Namely, one can\nrelax the reconstruction problem, which is highly nonconvex, to a convex\nproblem -- and, moreover, to a linear program. However, when is exactly the\nreconstruction problem equivalent to its convex relaxation is an open question.\nRecent work of many authors shows that the number of measurements k(r,n) needed\nto exactly reconstruct any r-sparse signal f of length n (a vector in R^n of\nsupport r) from its linear measurements with the convex relaxation method is\nusually O(r polylog(n)). However, known estimates of the number of measurements\nk(r,n) involve huge constants, in spite of very good performance of the\nalgorithms in practice. In this paper, we consider random Gaussian measurements\nand random Fourier measurements (a frequency sample of f). For Gaussian\nmeasurements, we prove the first guarantees with reasonable constants: k(r,n) <\n12 r (2 + log(n/r)), which is optimal up to constants. For Fourier\nmeasurements, we prove the best known bound k(r,n) = O(r log(n) . log^2(r)\nlog(r log n)), which is optimal within the log log n and log^3 r factors. Our\narguments are based on the technique of Geometric Functional Analysis and\nProbability in Banach spaces.\n","Comment: References to related work added"]}]
