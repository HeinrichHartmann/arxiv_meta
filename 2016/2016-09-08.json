By \"non-trivial background\" we mean either a non-vacuum state in\nMinkowski spacetime or an arbitrary state in a curved spacetime. Starting with\nthe case of a flat spacetime, the basic properties of the particle and\nquasiparticle propagation are analyzed using two different methods other than\nthe conventional mean-field-based techniques: on the one hand, the quantum\nstate corresponding to the quasiparticle excitation is explicitly constructed;\non the other hand, the spectral representation of the two-point propagators is\nanalyzed. Both methods lead to the same results: the energy and decay rate of\nthe quasiparticles are determined by the real and imaginary parts of the\nretarded self-energy respectively. These general results are applied to two\nparticular quantum systems: first, a scalar particle immersed in a thermal\ngraviton bath; second, a simplified atomic model, seizing the opportunity to\nconnect with other statistical and first-quantized approaches. In the second\npart of the thesis the results are extended to curved spacetime. Working with a\nquasilocal quasiparticle concept the flat-spacetime results are recovered. In\ncosmology, within the adiabatic approximation, it is possible to go beyond the\nflat spacetime results and find additional effects due to the universe\nexpansion. The cosmologically-induced effects are analyzed, obtaining that\nthere might be an additional contribution to the particle decay due to the\nuniverse expansion. In the de Sitter case, this additional contribution\ncoincides with the decay rate in a thermal bath in a flat spacetime at the\ncorresponding de Sitter temperature.\n","Comment: 269 pages, 17 figures.

In the model considered, Boolean networks\nevolve via a competition between nodes that punishes those in the majority. It\nis found that finite size networks evolve in a fundamentally different way than\ninfinitely large networks do. The symmetry of the evolutionary dynamics of\ninfinitely large networks that selects for canalizing Boolean functions is\nbroken in the evolutionary dynamics of finite size networks. In finite size\nnetworks there is an additional selection for input inverting Boolean functions\nthat output a value opposite to the majority of input values. These results are\nrevealed through an empirical study of the model that calculates the frequency\nof occurrence of the different possible Boolean functions. Classes of functions\nare found to occur with the same frequency. Those classes depend on the\nsymmetry of the evolutionary dynamics and correspond to orbits of the relevant\nsymmetry group. The empirical results match analytic results, determined by\nutilizing Polya's theorem, for the number of orbits expected in both finite\nsize and infinitely large networks. The reason for the symmetry breaking in the\nevolutionary dynamics is found to be due to the need for nodes in finite size\nnetworks to behave differently in order to cooperate so that the system\ncollectively performs as well as possible.

Firstly, causal sets are introduced as a simple\nkinematical model for causal geometry. It is shown how causal sets could\naccount for the microscopic origin of the Bekenstein entropy bound. Holography\nand finite entropy emerge naturally from the interplay between causality and\ndiscreteness. Going beyond causal set kinematics is problematic however. It is\na hard problem to find the right amplitude to attach to each causal set that\none needs to define the non-perturbative quantum dynamics of gravity. One\napproach which is ideally suited to define the non-perturbative gravitational\npath integral is dynamical triangulation. Without causality this method leads\nto unappealing features of the quantum geometry though. It is shown how\ncausality is instrumental in regulating this pathological behavior. In two\ndimensions this approach of causal dynamical triangulations has been\nanalytically solved by transfer matrix methods. In this thesis considerable\nprogress has been made in the development of more powerful techniques for this\napproach. The formulation through matrix models and a string field theory allow\nus to study interesting generalizations. Particularly, it has become possible\nto define the topological expansion. A surprising twist of the new matrix model\nis that it partially disentangles the large-N and continuum limit. This makes\nour causal model much closer in spirit to the original idea by 't Hooft than\nthe conventional matrix models of non-critical string theory.\n","Comment: 230 pages, reduced images, PhD thesis in theoretical physics,\n  Imperial College London (2008)"]}]

The distortion of signal\ncorrelations as they are transformed through particular LNP models is\npredictable and in some cases analytically tractable and invertible.

We also prove that the intersection of two majority\nfunctions has threshold degree Omega(log n), which is tight and settles a\nconjecture of O'Donnell and Servedio (2003).\n  Our proof consists of two parts. First, we show that for any nonconstant\nBoolean functions f and g, the intersection f(x)^g(y) has threshold degree O(d)\nif and only if ||f-F||_infty + ||g-G||_infty < 1 for some rational functions F,\nG of degree O(d). Second, we settle the least degree required for approximating\na halfspace and a majority function to any given accuracy by rational\nfunctions.\n  Our technique further allows us to make progress on Aaronson's challenge\n(2008) and contribute strong direct product theorems for polynomial\nrepresentations of composed Boolean functions of the form F(f_1,...,f_n). In\nparticular, we give an improved lower bound on the approximate degree of the\nAND-OR tree.\n","Comment: Full version of the FOCS'09 paper"]}]

Traditionally\nthese processes have been modeled in a piece-meal fashion, relying on\nphenomenological treatments such as Simmons and Richardson equations that are\nnot vetted in atomistic systems and do not flow seamlessly into each other. We\npresent a unified modeling approach, based on the Non-equilibrium Greens\nfunction (NEGF) formalism that allows us to integrate diverse transport regimes\nand establish a comprehensive quantitative theory. By comparing our simulations\nwith experiments on a metal-molecule-semiconductor junction (varying molecular\nlengths ~1-3nm), we identify the role of molecular monolayers in tuning the\nsemiconductor band-bending, and thereby overall device conductivity. We find\nthat the principal role of molecules is to act as a voltage divider, altering\nthe Schottky barriers, thereby modulating current levels, voltage-asymmetries\nand crossover from Schottky to tunneling transport. While this provides an\nappealingly simple explanation for our observed experimental trends, the\ncalculated shifts in crossover voltages are insufficient to explain the\nexperiments quantitatively. Quantitative correspondence with experiments\nrequires invocation of an additional voltage divider arising from molecular\ndipoles that further tunes semiconductor band-bending.

In\ncomplex systems, with limited physical insight on the coherent behavior of\ntheir constituents, the only available information is data obtained from\nsimulations of the trajectories of huge numbers of degrees of freedom over\nmicroscopic time scales. This paper discusses a Bayesian approach to deriving\nprobabilistic coarse-grained models that simultaneously address the problems of\nidentifying appropriate reduced coordinates and the effective dynamics in this\nlower-dimensional representation. At the core of the models proposed lie\nsimple, low-dimensional dynamical systems which serve as the building blocks of\nthe global model. These approximate the latent, generating sources and\nparameterize the reduced-order dynamics. We discuss parallelizable, online\ninference and learning algorithms that employ Sequential Monte Carlo samplers\nand scale linearly with the dimensionality of the observed dynamics. We propose\na Bayesian adaptive time-integration scheme that utilizes probabilistic\npredictive estimates and enables rigorous concurrent s imulation over\nmacroscopic time scales.

The role of symmetry groups behind the generalized\ntomographic maps is analyzed in some detail.

We present a method to fabricate a 3D mask that allows to etch\nthree-dimensional monolithic nanostructures by using only CMOS-compatible\nprocesses. The mask is written in a hard-mask layer that is deposited on two\nadjacent inclined surfaces of a Si wafer. By projecting in single step two\ndifferent 2D patterns within one 3D mask on the two inclined surfaces, the\nmutual alignment between the patterns is ensured. Thereby after the mask\npattern is defined, the etching of deep pores in two oblique directions yields\na three-dimensional structure in Si.

Finally, the estimated DP-RTFs are\nconcatenated across frequencies and used as a feature vector for the\nlocalization of speech source.

This allows one to establish, in a bottom-up approach, the\nvalidity range of the EFT description, and to assess the error associated with\nthe truncation of the EFT series. We give a practical prescription on how\nexperimental results could be reported, so that they admit a maximally broad\nrange of theoretical interpretations. Namely, the experimental constraints on\ndimension-6 operators should be reported as functions of the kinematic\nvariables that set the relevant energy scale of the studied process. This is\nespecially important for hadron collider experiments where collisions probe a\nwide range of energy scales.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 2 figures; v2: Comments and references added, conclusions\n  unchanged"]}]

There is some success, in particular in\nastrophysical systems, based on Magneto-Rotational Instability (MRI). However,\nMRI requires the system to be weakly magnetized, which is not a feature of\ngeneral magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows. Nevertheless, linear perturbations of\nsuch flows are nonnormal in nature which argues for an origin of nonlinearity\ntherein. The idea is, nonnormal perturbations could produce huge transient\nenergy growth (TEG), which may lead to non-linearity and further turbulence.\nHowever, so far, nonnormal effects in shear flows have not been explored much\nin the presence of magnetic fields.

For example, while topological insulators were\noriginally studied in the context of electron wavefunctions, recent work has\nled to proposals of topological insulators in bosonic systems: in photonic\ncrystals, in the vibrational modes of crystals, and in the excitations of\nordered magnets. Here we confirm the recent proposal that, in a weak magnetic\nfield, the dimerized quantum magnet SrCu$_{2}$(BO$_{3}$)$_2$ is a bosonic\ntopological insulator with nonzero Chern number in the triplon bands and\ntopologically protected chiral edge excitations.\n","Comment: 33 pages, 14 figures (preprint format and including supplementary\n  material)"]}]

This new\napproach is fast, simple, and effective in saving storage space. A key insight\nin our approach is that access time (including decompression latency) is\ncritical in modern memory hierarchies. By combining inexpensive hardware\nsupport with modest OS support, our holistic approach to compression achieves\nsubstantial improvements in performance and energy efficiency across the memory\nhierarchy. Using this new approach, we make several major contributions in this\nthesis. First, we propose a new compression algorithm, Base-Delta-Immediate\nCompression (BDI), that achieves high compression ratio with very low\ncompression/decompression latency. BDI exploits the existing low dynamic range\nof values present in many cache lines to compress them to smaller sizes using\nBase+Delta encoding. Second, we observe that the compressed size of a cache\nblock can be indicative of its reuse. We use this observation to develop a new\ncache insertion policy for compressed caches, the Size-based Insertion Policy\n(SIP), which uses the size of a compressed block as one of the metrics to\npredict its potential future reuse. Third, we propose a new main memory\ncompression framework, Linearly Compressed Pages (LCP), that significantly\nreduces the complexity and power cost of supporting main memory compression. We\ndemonstrate that any compression algorithm can be adapted to fit the\nrequirements of LCP, and that LCP can be efficiently integrated with the\nexisting cache compression designs, avoiding extra compression/decompression.\n","Comment: PhD Thesis"]}]

The isotope distribution of IMF charges does also\nshow certain memory effect at 100 AMeV case but not at 400 AMeV case.\n","Comment: 12 papers, 5 figures, accepted by PRC"]}]

In high energy\nnuclear collisions, QCD jets would deposit a large fraction of their energy and\ninto the produced matter. The question of how this energy is degraded and\nwhether we can use this phenomenon to probe the properties of the produced\nmatter is now under active discussion. It has been proposed that if this\nmatter, which is now being referred to as a {\\em strongly coupled Quark-Gluon\nPlasma} (sQGP), may behave as a liquid with a very small viscosity.\n  In this case, a very specific collective excitation should be produced,\ncalled the ``conical flow'', similar e.g. to the sonic booms generated by the\nshock waves produced by supersonic planes. The RHIC experiments seem indeed to\nbe obtaining some indication that the production of particles emitted opposite\nto a high-$p_t$ jet may actually be peaked away from the quenched jet\ndirection, at an angle roughly consistent with the direction expected in case a\nshock wave is produced (i.e. orthogonal to the Mach cone).

The experimental observation of such an effect\nwould be a very good test for the validity of the whole picture currently\nemerging from the study of partonic matter in nuclear collisions.\n"]}]

It is argued that hybrid {Q-Q}\ninteractions encounter difficulties in describing baryon spectra due to the\nspecific contributions from one-gluon and pion exchanges together. In contrast,\na chiral constituent quark model with a Q-Q interaction solely derived from\nGoldstone-boson exchange is capable of providing a unified description of both\nthe N and \\Delta spectra in good agreement with phenomenology.\n","Comment: 21 pages, LaTeX"]}]

Secondly, such an apparent increase in the\nsizes of the quanta can be attributed to extra fluctuations associated with\nmotion, which are precisely described in terms of a thermally agitated harmonic\noscillator by using a temperature parameter. This provides a stringent\nconstraint on the microscopic properties of flat space-time: it is an array of\nquantized oscillators.

But I argue that temporally\nextended temporal parts are supported by both classical and quantum mechanics.\n","Comment: 100 pages, no figures; an extract of this paper is at:\n  physics/0406020"]}]

Also used extensively are insights gleaned from a\nconvective variational action principle, key being the distinction between each\nvelocity and its canonically conjugate momentum.

An immediate goal of the investigation is to understand better the\nnumber, and form, of independent dissipation terms required for a consistent\nset of equations of motion in the multi-fluid context. A significant, but\nseemingly innocuous detail, is that one must be careful to isolate ``forces''\nthat can be written as total gradients, otherwise errors can be made in\nrelating the net internal force to the net externally applied force.

The transition itself\nreflects the formation of protein structure when represented in terms of\ncontact graph cycles, and it is identified as an example of a fragmentation\ntransition known from several other statistical systems without a proper\nthermodynamic limit. Some interesting implications follow from our model\nincluding chirality, broken $t$-symmetry and one-dimensionality. Although\ndefined from purely structural considerations, we further show that for native\nprotein structures these observables follow some of the quantitative rules that\nare typically valid for amino acid types in protein sequences. Moreover, this\nrelation between polypeptide structures and their amino acid sequences suggests\na specific protein design alphabet.\n","Comment: minor revision in v4; changed title; 11 pages, 6 latex figures"]}]

This will be done considering a series expansion for the gravitational\nfield of the source, and including in the Hamiltonian of the Paul trap only the\nfirst two terms. Higher--order contributions will be introduced as part of the\nenvironment of the system, and in consequence will not appear in the\nHamiltonian. In other words, we put forward an argument that allows us to\ndifferentiate those gravitational degrees of freedom that will appear as an\nuncontrollable influence on the Paul trap. Along the ideas of the so called\nrestricted path integral formalism, we take into account the continuous\nmonitoring of the position of our particle, and in consequence the\ncorresponding propagators and probabilities, associated with the different\nmeasurements outputs, are obtained.\n  Afterwards, the differential equation related to a quantum nondemolition\nvariable is posed and solved, i.e., a family of quantum nondemolition\nparameters is obtained.

This is achieved by reversing the reconciliation procedure subsequent\nto the quantum transmission, that is, using Bob's instead of Alice's data to\nbuild the key. Although squeezing or entanglement may be helpful to improve the\nresistance to noise, they are not required for the protocols to remain secure\nwith high losses. Therefore, these protocols can be implemented very simply by\ntransmitting coherent states and performing homodyne detection. Here, we show\nthat entanglement nevertheless plays a crucial role in the security analysis of\ncoherent state protocols. Every cryptographic protocol based on displaced\ngaussian states turns out to be equivalent to an entanglement-based protocol,\neven though no entanglement is actually present. This equivalence even holds in\nthe absence of squeezing, for coherent state protocols. This ``virtual''\nentanglement is important to assess the security of these protocols as it\nprovides an upper bound on the mutual information between Alice and Bob if they\nhad used entanglement. The resulting security criteria are compared to the\nseparability criterion for bipartite gaussian variables. It appears that the\nsecurity thresholds are well within the entanglement region. This supports the\nidea that coherent state quantum cryptography may be unconditionally secure.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 6 figures. Submitted to QIC"]}]

A {\\it gedankenexperiment} is presented to demonstrate the physically\ntestable implications of the results of these calculations, along with graphs\nof the time-evolution of the conditional probability distribution for a\ntunneling particle and for one undergoing allowed transmission. Numerical\nresults are also presented for the effects of loss in a bandgap medium on\ntransmission and on reflection, as a function of the position of the lossy\nregion; such loss should provide a feasible, though indirect, test of the\npresent conclusions. It is argued that the effects of loss on the pulse {\\it\ndelay time} are related to the imaginary value of the momentum of a tunneling\nparticle, and it is suggested that this might help explain a small discrepancy\nin an earlier experiment.\n","Comment: 11 pages, latex, 4 postscript figures separate (one w/ 3 parts)"]}]

Such problems can be characterized by the question as\nto how the asymptotic behaviours of solutions are related as the independent\nvariable is allowed to pass towards infinity along different directions in the\ncomplex plane. Connection problems have been previously tackled by a variety of\nmethods. Frequently these are based on the ideas of isomonodromic deformation\nand the matching of WKB solutions. However, the implementation of these methods\noften tends to be heuristic in nature and so the task of rigorising the process\nis complicated. The method we propose here develops uniform approximations to\nsolutions. This removes the need to match solutions, is rigorous, and can lead\nto the solution of connection problems with minimal computational effort. Our\nmethod is reliant on finding uniform approximations of differential equations\nof the generic form ${d^2\\phi}/{d\\eta^2} = - \\xi^2F(\\eta,\\xi)\\phi$ as the\ncomplex-valued parameter $\\xi \\to \\infty.$ The details of the treatment rely\nheavily on the locations of the zeros of the function $F$ in this limit. If\nthey are isolated then a uniform approximation to solutions can be derived in\nterms of Airy functions of suitable argument. On the other hand, if two of the\nzeros of $F$ coalesce as $|\\xi| \\to \\infty$ then an approximation can be\nderived in terms of parabolic cylinder functions. In this paper we discuss both\ncases, but illustrate our technique in action by applying the parabolic\ncylinder case to the ``classical'' connection problem associated with the\nsecond Painlev{\\'e} transcendent. Future papers will show how the technique can\nbe applied with very little change to the other Painlev{\\'e} equations, and to\nthe wider problem of the asymptotic behaviour of the general solution to any of\nthese equations.\n","Comment: 28 pages, amstex, no figures"]}]

This anomalous\nbehavior of the normal-state properties is traced to a ``collective single-band\nKondo effect,'' in which a quasiparticle resonance forms at the Fermi level as\nthe temperature is lowered, ultimately yielding a strongly renormalized Fermi\nliquid at zero temperature.\n","Comment: 27 pages, latex, 13 figures, Invited for publication in Advances in\n  Physics"]}]
