New instrumentation has\ndecreased the time between observation and discovery from years to seconds, and\nenables polarimetry to be performed on FRBs for the first time. We have\ndiscovered an FRB (FRB 140514) in real-time on 14 May, 2014 at 17:14:11.06 UTC\nat the Parkes radio telescope and triggered follow-up at other wavelengths\nwithin hours of the event. FRB 140514 was found with a dispersion measure (DM)\nof 562.7(6) cm$^{-3}$ pc, giving an upper limit on source redshift of $z\n\\lesssim 0.5$. FRB 140514 was found to be 21$\\pm$7% (3-$\\sigma$) circularly\npolarized on the leading edge with a 1-$\\sigma$ upper limit on linear\npolarization $<10%$. We conclude that this polarization is intrinsic to the\nFRB. If there was any intrinsic linear polarization, as might be expected from\ncoherent emission, then it may have been depolarized by Faraday rotation caused\nby passing through strong magnetic fields and/or high density environments. FRB\n140514 was discovered during a campaign to re-observe known FRB fields, and\nlies close to a previous discovery, FRB 110220; based on the difference in DMs\nof these bursts and time-on-sky arguments, we attribute the proximity to\nsampling bias and conclude that they are distinct objects.

In frequency space\nstreams typically become thicker and somewhat distorted. Therefore, our\nanalysis explains most of the features seen in the approximate angle and\nfrequency spaces for the Aquarius streams with the exception of their somewhat\n`noisy' and `patchy' morphologies. These are likely due to the interactions\nwith the large number of dark matter subhalos present in the cosmological\nsimulations.

Recently, however,\nit has been pointed out that standard formulation of SPH (SSPH) has\ndifficulties in the treatment of a contact discontinuity such as a core-mantle\nboundary and a free surface such as a planetary surface. This difficulty comes\nfrom the assumption of differentiability of density in SSPH.

In this paper, we report the results of the GI\nsimulations with DISPH and compare them with those obtained with SSPH. We found\nthat the disk properties, such as mass and angular momentum produced by DISPH\nis different from that of SSPH. In general, the disks formed by DISPH are more\ncompact: while formation of a smaller mass moon for low-oblique impacts is\nexpected with DISPH, inhibition of ejection would promote formation of a larger\nmass moon for high-oblique impacts. Since only the improvement of core-mantle\nboundary significantly affects the properties of circumplanetary disks\ngenerated by GI and DISPH has not been significantly improved from SSPH for a\nfree surface, we should be very careful when some conclusions are drawn from\nthe numerical simulations for GI.

Moreover, a substantial part of our formalization is made up solely\nby \"elementary theories\" such as sets, numbers and tuples that are themselves\nindependent of reduction rings and may therefore be used as the foundations of\nfuture theory explorations in Theorema.\n  In addition, we also report on two general-purpose Theorema tools we\ndeveloped for an efficient and convenient exploration of mathematical theories:\nan interactive proving strategy and a \"theory analyzer\" that already proved\nextremely useful when creating large structured knowledge bases.\n","Comment: submitted to CICM 2015 (Conference on Intelligent Computer\n  Mathematics)"]}]

Towards this,\nwe study charge and spin transport in bilayer graphene-based spin valve devices\nfabricated in a new device architecture which allows us to make a comparative\nstudy by separately investigating the roles of substrate and polymer residues\non spin relaxation. First, the comparison between spin valves fabricated on\nSiO2 and BN substrates suggests that substrate-related charged impurities,\nphonons and roughness do not limit the spin transport in current devices. Next,\nthe observation of a 5-fold enhancement in spin relaxation time in the\nencapsulated device highlights the significance of polymer residues on spin\nrelaxation. We observe a spin relaxation length of ~ 10 um in the encapsulated\nbilayer with a charge mobility of 24000 cm2/Vs. The carrier density dependence\nof spin relaxation time has two distinct regimes; n<4 x 1012 cm-2, where spin\nrelaxation time decreases monotonically as carrier concentration increases, and\nn>4 x 1012 cm-2, where spin relaxation time exhibits a sudden increase. The\nsudden increase in the spin relaxation time with no corresponding signature in\nthe charge transport suggests the presence of a magnetic resonance close to the\ncharge neutrality point. We also demonstrate, for the first time, spin\ntransport across bipolar p-n junctions in our dual-gated device architecture\nthat fully integrates a sequence of encapsulated regions in its design. At low\ntemperatures, strong suppression of the spin signal was observed while a\ntransport gap was induced, which is interpreted as a novel manifestation of\nimpedance mismatch within the spin channel.\n"]}]

The event, initially designated G184098 and later given\nthe name GW150914, is described in detail elsewhere. By prior arrangement,\npreliminary estimates of the time, significance, and sky location of the event\nwere shared with 63 teams of observers covering radio, optical, near-infrared,\nX-ray, and gamma-ray wavelengths with ground- and space-based facilities. In\nthis Letter we describe the low-latency analysis of the GW data and present the\nsky localization of the first observed compact binary merger. We summarize the\nfollow-up observations reported by 25 teams via private Gamma-ray Coordinates\nNetwork circulars, giving an overview of the participating facilities, the GW\nsky localization coverage, the timeline and depth of the observations. As this\nevent turned out to be a binary black hole merger, there is little expectation\nof a detectable electromagnetic (EM) signature. Nevertheless, this first\nbroadband campaign to search for a counterpart of an Advanced LIGO source\nrepresents a milestone and highlights the broad capabilities of the transient\nastronomy community and the observing strategies that have been developed to\npursue neutron star binary merger events.

In particular, we define and calculate the\ntopological visibility, which is a variation of the topological invariant\nassociated with the scattering matrix of the system as well as the\nzero-bias-conductance-peak heights in the tunneling measurements, in the\npresence of dissipative broadening, using realistic nanowire parameters to\nconnect the topological invariants with the zero bias tunneling conductance\nvalues. This dissipative broadening is present in both (the existing) tunneling\nmeasurements and also (any future) braiding experiments as an inevitable\nconsequence of a finite braiding time. The connection between the topological\nvisibility and the conductance allows us to obtain the visibility of realistic\nbraiding experiments in nanowires, and to conclude that the current\nexperimentally accessible systems with non-ideal zero bias conductance peaks\nmay indeed manifest (with rather low visibility) non-Abelian statistics for the\nMajorana zero modes. In general, we find that large (small) superconducting gap\n(Majorana peak splitting) is essential for the manifestation of the non-Abelian\nbraiding statistics, and in particular, a zero bias conductance value of around\nhalf the ideal quantized Majorana value should be sufficient for the\nmanifestation of non-Abelian statistics in experimental nanowires.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 9 figures, Final published version"]}]

Furthermore, non-trivial trophic structures have been observed in\nnetworks of neurons, species, genes, metabolites, cellular signalling,\nconcatenated words, P2P users, and world trade. Here we consider two simple yet\napparently quite different dynamical models -- one a\nSusceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic model adapted to include\ncomplex contagion, the other an Amari-Hopfield neural network -- and show that\nin both cases the related spreading processes are modulated in similar ways by\nthe trophic coherence of the underlying networks.

Recent\nenhancements have shown that the use of successive interference cancellation\n(SIC) can largely boost the performance of these schemes. A further step\nforward in the performance can be attained when diversity combining techniques\nare applied. In order to enable combining, the detection and association of the\npackets to their transmitters has to be done prior to decoding. We present a\nsolution to this problem, that articulates into two phases. Non-coherent\nsoft-correlation as well as interference-aware soft-correlation are used for\npacket detection. We evaluate the detection capabilities of both solutions via\nnumerical simulations. We also evaluate numerically the spectral efficiency\nachieved by the proposed approach, highlighting its benefits.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 7 figures.

Thus the state of the radioactive nucleus and Schrodinger's cat is\nas follows: an undecayed nucleus is 100% positively correlated with an alive\ncat, and (i.e. superposed with) a decayed nucleus is 100% positively correlated\nwith a dead cat. The superposition consists merely in the fact that both\ncorrelations are simultaneously true. Despite many published statements to the\ncontrary, this superposition is not paradoxical. It is in fact what one expects\nintuitively.\n","Comment: 3 figures"]}]

The method can also be used from the opposite\npoint of view; namely, as a new method to optimize certain Bell inequalities.\nIn the translationally invariant (TI) case, we provide an exponentially faster\nsolution of the classical bound and analytically closed expressions of the\nquantum value. We apply our method to three examples: a tight TI inequality for\n$8$ parties, a quasi TI uniparametric inequality for any even number of\nparties, and we show that the ground state of a spin glass is nonlocal in some\nparameter region. This opens the possibility for the use of ground states of\ncommonly studied Hamiltonians as multipartite resources for quantum information\nprotocols that require nonlocality.\n","Comment: 18 pages (11 + appendices), 7 figures, 2 tables"]}]

In this review we give a\ndetailed discussion on the standard model of cosmology ($\\Lambda$CDM),\ninflation and cosmological perturbation theory. We survey the theories of\ngravity beyond Einstein's General Relativity, specially which arise from SUGRA,\nand study the consequences of these theories in the context of inflation and\nput bounds on the theories and the parameters therein from the observational\nexperiments like Planck, Keck/BICEP. The possibility of testing these theories\nin the near future in CMB observations and new data coming from colliders like\nthe LHC, provides an unique opportunity for constructing verifiable models of\nparticle physics and General Relativity.\n","Comment: 64 pages, 12 figures, partially based on arXiv:1303.3870,\n  arXiv:1405.1321, arXiv:1511.03121"]}]

We examine how missing cost and effect\noutcome data are handled in RCT-based CEAs, complementing a previous review\n(covering 2003-2009, 88 articles) with a new systematic review (2009-2015, 81\narticles) focussing on two different perspectives. First, we review the\ndescription of the missing data, the statistical methods used to deal with\nthem, and the quality of the judgement underpinning the choice of these\nmethods. Second, we provide guidelines on how the information about missingness\nand related methods should be presented to improve the reporting and handling\nof missing data. Our review shows that missing data in within-RCT CEAs are\nstill often inadequately handled and the overall level of information provided\nto support the chosen methods is rarely satisfactory.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, references omitted"]}]

A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the\ndistribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training\ncases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the\nsummed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces\nthe training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch\nnormalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to\napply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch\nnormalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used\nfor normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a\nsingle training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its\nown adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before\nthe non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs\nexactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also\nstraightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the\nnormalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is\nvery effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks.\nEmpirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the\ntraining time compared with previously published techniques.\n"]}]
