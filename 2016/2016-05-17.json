We concentrate on the\nclosed $gl(1|1)$ spin-chain and its continuum limit - the $c=-2$ symplectic\nfermions theory - and rely on two technical companion papers, \"Continuum limit\nand symmetries of the periodic gl(1|1) spin chain\" [Nucl.

Our main result is that the algebra of local\nHamiltonians, the Jones-Temperley-Lieb algebra JTL_N, goes over in the\ncontinuum limit to a bigger algebra than the product of the left and right\nVirasoro algebras. This algebra, S - which we call interchiral, mixes the left\nand right moving sectors, and is generated, in the symplectic fermions case, by\nthe additional field $S(z,\\bar{z})=S_{ab}\\psi^a(z)\\bar{\\psi}^b(\\bar{z})$, with\na symmetric form $S_{ab}$ and conformal weights (1,1). We discuss in details\nhow the Hilbert space of the LCFT decomposes onto representations of this\nalgebra, and how this decomposition is related with properties of the finite\nspin-chain. We show that there is a complete correspondence between algebraic\nproperties of finite periodic spin chains and the continuum limit. An important\ntechnical aspect of our analysis involves the fundamental new observation that\nthe action of JTL_N in the $gl(1|1)$ spin chain is in fact isomorphic to an\nenveloping algebra of a certain Lie algebra, itself a non semi-simple version\nof $sp(N-2)$. The semi-simple part of JTL_N is represented by $Usp(N-2)$,\nproviding a beautiful example of a classical Howe duality, for which we have a\nnon semi-simple version in the full JTL image represented in the spin-chain. On\nthe continuum side, simple modules over the interchiral algebra S are\nidentified with \"fundamental\" representations of $sp(\\infty)$.\n","Comment: 69 pp., 10 figs, v2: the paper has been substantially modified - new\n  proofs, new refs, new App C with inductive limits construction, etc"]}]

The VHE spectrum shows clear curvature, being well fitted\neither by a power law with an exponential cut-off or by a log-parabola. A\nsimple power-law fit hypothesis for the observed shape of the PG 1553+113 VHE\n$\\gamma$-ray spectrum is rejected with a high significance (fit probability\nP=2.6 $\\times 10^{-6}$). The observed curvature is compatible with the\nextragalactic background light (EBL) imprint predicted by current generation\nEBL models assuming a redshift $z\\sim0.4$. New constraints on the redshift are\nderived from the VHE spectrum. These constraints are compatible with previous\nlimits and suggest that the source is most likely located around the optical\nlower limit, $z=0.4$, based on the detection of Ly$\\alpha$ absorption. Finally,\nwe find that the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model gives a satisfactory\ndescription of the observed multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution\nduring the flare.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

We show that adopting an unnormalized\ndefinition of Granger causality one may put in evidence redundant multiplets of\nvariables influencing the target by maximizing the total Granger causality to a\ngiven target, over all the possible partitions of the set of driving variables.\nConsequently we introduce a pairwise index of synergy which is zero when two\nindependent sources additively influence the future state of the system,\ndifferently from previous definitions of synergy. Results: We report the\napplication of the proposed approach to resting state fMRI data from the Human\nConnectome Project, showing that redundant pairs of regions arise mainly due to\nspace contiguity and interhemispheric symmetry, whilst synergy occurs mainly\nbetween non-homologous pairs of regions in opposite hemispheres. Conclusions:\nRedundancy and synergy, in healthy resting brains, display characteristic\npatterns, revealed by the proposed approach.

Loop currents and charge ordering are driven by\ndistinct components of the short-range Coulomb interactions: loop currents\nresult from the repulsion between nearest-neighbor copper and oxygen orbitals,\nwhile charge order results from repulsion between neighboring oxygen orbitals.\nWe find that the leading piLC phase has an antiferromagnetic pattern similar to\npreviously discovered staggered flux phases, and that it emerges abruptly at\nhole dopings p below the van Hove filling. Subsequent charge ordering\ntendencies in the piLC phase reveal that diagonal d-charge density waves (dCDW)\nare suppressed by the loop currents while axial order competes more weakly. In\nsome cases we find a wide temperature range below the loop-current transition,\nover which the susceptibility towards an axial dCDW is large. In these cases,\nshort-range axial charge order may be induced by doping-related disorder. A\nunique feature of the coexisting dCDW and piLC phases is the emergence of an\nincommensurate modulation of the loop currents.

Namely, the second- through sixth-order\nmodels of the recently proposed CCSDT(Q-n) quadruples series [J. Chem. Phys.\n140, 064108 (2014)] are compared to the prominent CCSDT(Q) and lambda-CCSDT(Q)\nmodels. From a comparison of the models in terms of their recovery of total CC\nsingles, doubles, triples, and quadruples (CCSDTQ) energies, we find that the\nperformance of the CCSDT(Q-n) models is independent of the reference used\n(unrestricted or restricted (open-shell) Hartree-Fock), in contrast to the\nCCSDT(Q) and lambda-CCSDT(Q) models, for which the accuracy is strongly\ndependent on the spin of the molecular ground state. By further comparing the\nability of the models to recover relative CCSDTQ atomization energies, the\ndiscrepancy between them is found to be even more pronounced, stressing how a\nbalanced description of both closed- and open-shell species - as found in the\nCCSDT(Q-n) models - is indeed of paramount importance if any perturbative CC\nmodel is to be of chemical relevance for high-accuracy applications. In\nparticular, the third-order CCSDT(Q-3) model is found to offer an encouraging\nalternative to the existing choices of quadruples models used in modern\ncomputational thermochemistry, since the model is still only of moderate cost,\nalbeit markedly more costly than, e.g., the CCSDT(Q) and lambda-CCSDT(Q)\nmodels.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 3 figures, 1 supporting information (attached as an\n  ancillary file)"]}]

The usual calculation supposes that the\nsolenoid's vector potential may be well-approximated as classical. The A-B\nshift is then acquired by the quantized electron moving in this vector\npotential. Recently, Vaidman presented a semi-classical calculation, later\nconfirmed by a fully quantum calculation of Pearle and Rizzi, where it is\nsupposed that the electron's vector potential may be well-approximated as\nclassical. The A-B shift is then acquired by the quantized solenoid charges\nmoving in this vector potential.

The A-B phase shift is then shown to be acquired by the\nquantized vector potential. We regard these as three equivalent alternative\nways of calculating the A-B shift. To show this, consider the exact problem\nwhere all three entities are quantized. But, as in the first two cases above,\nmake the supposition that it is a good approximation to take the vector\npotential as classical. With both the electron phase shift and the solenoid\nphase shift mechanisms operating, this gives twice the A-B phase shift. Thus,\nthis is a faulty supposition. We make a better approximation. We take the wave\nfunction for the exact problem as the product of a vector potential wave\nfunction and an electron/solenoid wave function, and apply a variational\nprinciple. This leads to a Schr\\\"odinger equation for the electron/solenoid\nwave function with an additional term.

It is found that HMCG\nnot only works very well in reproducing the phase transitions and critical\nphenomena of the microscopic models, but also accelerates the evaluation of\ndynamics with significant computational savings compared to microscopic MC\nsimulations directly for the whole networks. The proposed method is general and\ncan be applied to a wide variety of networked systems just adopting appropriate\nmicroscopic simulation methods and coarse graining approaches.\n","Comment: 7pages, 6 figures"]}]

To solve this problem, we propose a geometric mean\ndecomposition (GMD)-based hybrid precoding scheme to avoid the complicated bit\nallocation.

This paper provides\nevidence that the pairwise model, applied to experimental recordings, predicts\na bimodal distribution for the population-averaged activity, and for some\npopulation sizes the second mode peaks at high activities, with 90% of the\nneuron population active within time-windows of few milliseconds. This\nbimodality has several undesirable consequences: 1. The presence of two modes\nis unrealistic in view of observed neuronal activity. 2. The prediction of a\nhigh-activity mode is unrealistic on neurobiological grounds. 3. Boltzmann\nlearning becomes non-ergodic, hence the pairwise model found by this method is\nnot the maximum entropy distribution; similarly, solving the inverse problem by\ncommon variants of mean-field approximations has the same problem. 4. The\nGlauber dynamics associated with the model is either unrealistically bistable,\nor does not reflect the distribution of the pairwise model.
