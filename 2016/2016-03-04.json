We find that all 12 objects have a\nLya profile with the main peak redward of the systemic redshift defined by\nnebular lines, and five have a weak, secondary peak blueward of the systemic\nredshift (blue bump). The average velocity offset of the red main peak (the\nblue bump, if any) with respect to the systemic redshift is Delta_v_Lya,r =\n174+/- 19 km s-1 (Delta_v_Lya,b = -316+/-45 km s-1), which is smaller than\n(comparable to) that of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs). The outflow velocities\ninferred from metal absorption lines in three individual and one stacked\nspectra are comparable to those of LBGs. The expanding shell model constructed\nby Verhamme et al. (2006) reproduces not only the Lya profiles but also other\nobserved quantities including the outflow velocity and the FWHM of nebular\nlines for the non-blue bump objects. On the other hand, the model predicts too\nhigh FWHMs of nebular lines for the blue bump objects, although this\ndiscrepancy may disappear if we introduce additional Lya photons produced by\ngravitational cooling. We show that the small Delta_v_Lya,r values of our\nsample can be explained by low neutral-hydrogen column densities of log(NHI) =\n18.9 cm-2 on average. This value is more than one order of magnitude lower than\nthose of LBGs but is consistent with recent findings that LAEs have high\nionization parameters and low Hi gas masses.

We track the\nevolution of these spectra as the source makes a transition from a bright\nlow/hard to hard intermediate state. In the hard/intermediate states, the QPO\nand time averaged spectra are similar and the harmonic is either undetected or\nsimilar to the QPO. By contrast, in the softer states the harmonic is\ndramatically softer than the QPO spectrum and the time averaged spectrum, and\nthe QPO spectrum is dramatically harder than the time averaged spectrum.\nClearly, the existance of these very different spectral shaped components mean\nthat the time-averaged spectra are complex. We use the frequency resolved\nspectra to better constrain the model components, and find that the data are\nconsistent with a time-averaged spectrum which has an additional low\ntemperature, optically thick Comptonisation component. The harmonic can be\ndescribed by this additional component alone, while the QPO spectrum is similar\nto that of the hard Comptonisation and its reflection. Neither QPO nor harmonic\nshow signs of the disc component even when it is strong in the time averaged\nspectrum. While the similarity between the harmonic and QPO spectra in the\nintermediate state can be produced from the angular dependence of Compton\nscattering in a single region, this cannot explain the dramatic differences\nseen in the soft state. Instead, we propose that the soft Compton region is\nlocated predominantly above the disc while the hard Compton is from the hotter\ninner flow.

We take the above as indications that at some level the small\nquantities are well-approximated by zero. In particular the mixing angles, to a\nzero order, should be either 0 or $\\pi/4$.

The other mixing angles are vanishing as is the\nsolar splitting. We show how the $A4$ assignment for the lepton doublets leads\nto this form.

The control task is to enforce the system state\nto follow a prescribed desired trajectory as closely as possible. The concept\nof so-called exactly realizable trajectories is proposed. For exactly\nrealizable desired trajectories exists a control signal which enforces the\nstate to exactly follow the desired trajectory. For a given affine control\nsystem, these trajectories are characterized by the so-called constraint\nequation. This approach does not only yield an explicit expression for the\ncontrol signal in terms of the desired trajectory, but also identifies a\nparticularly simple class of nonlinear control systems. Based on that insight,\nthe regularization parameter is used as the small parameter for a perturbation\nexpansion. This results in a reinterpretation of affine optimal control\nproblems with small regularization term as singularly perturbed differential\nequations. The small parameter originates from the formulation of the control\nproblem and does not involve simplifying assumptions about the system dynamics.\nCombining this approach with the linearizing assumption, approximate and partly\nlinear equations for the optimal trajectory tracking of arbitrary desired\ntrajectories are derived. For vanishing regularization parameter, the state\ntrajectory becomes discontinuous and the control signal diverges. On the other\nhand, the analytical treatment becomes exact and the solutions are exclusively\ngoverned by linear differential equations. Thus, the possibility of linear\nstructures underlying nonlinear optimal control is revealed. This fact enables\nthe derivation of exact analytical solutions to an entire class of nonlinear\ntrajectory tracking problems with affine controls.

In this paper, we take several steps\ntowards achieving more predictable database systems. First, we propose a\nprofiling framework called VProfiler that, given the source code of a DBMS, is\nable to identify the dominant sources of variance in transaction latency.\nVProfiler automatically instruments the DBMS source code to deconstruct the\noverall variance of transaction latencies into variances and covariances of the\nexecution time of individual functions, which in turn provide insight into the\nroot causes of variance. Second, we use VProfiler to analyze MySQL and Postgres\n- two of the most popular and complex open-source database systems. Our case\nstudies reveal that the primary causes of variance in MySQL and Postgres are\nlock scheduling and centralized logging, respectively. Finally, based on\nVProfiler's findings, we further focus on remedying the performance variance of\nMySQL by (1) proposing a new lock scheduling algorithm, called Variance-Aware\nTransaction Scheduling (VATS), (2) enhancing the buffer pool replacement\npolicy, and (3) identifying tuning parameters that can reduce variance\nsignificantly.

Targeted strategies, where the\nindividuals most important for monitoring or preventing outbreaks are selected\nfor intervention, offer a possibility to significantly improve these measures.\nAlthough targeted strategies carry a strong potential, identifying optimal\ntarget groups remains a challenge.

An\noffline adversary is limited only by the amount of computational resources he\nor she is willing to invest to crack a user's password. The danger is\ncompounded by the existence of authentication servers who fail to adopt proper\npassword storage practices like key-stretching. Password managers can help\nmitigate these risks by adopting key stretching procedures like hash iteration\nor memory hard functions to derive site specific passwords from the user's\nmaster password on the client-side. While key stretching can reduce the offline\nadversary's success rate, these procedures also increase computational costs\nfor a legitimate user. Motivated by the observation that most of the password\nguesses of the offline adversary will be incorrect, we propose a client side\ncost asymmetric secure hashing scheme (Client-CASH). Client-CASH randomizes the\nruntime of client-side key stretching procedure in a way that the expected\ncomputational cost of our key derivation function is greater when run with an\nincorrect master password. We make several contributions. First, we show how to\nintroduce randomness into a client-side key stretching algorithms through the\nuse of halting predicates which are selected randomly at the time of account\ncreation. Second, we formalize the problem of finding the optimal running time\ndistribution subject to certain cost constraints for the client and certain\nsecurity constrains on the halting predicates. Finally, we demonstrate that\nClient-CASH can reduce the adversary's success rate by up to $21\\%$. These\nresults demonstrate the promise of the Client-CASH mechanism.\n","Comment: ASIA CCS 2016.

Which of these two possibilities occurs depends on a model\nand the initial conditions. In the quasiperiodic scenario there exist very\nspecial time-periodic solutions. They result for a delicate balance between\ndispersion and nonlinear interaction. The main body of this dissertation is\nconcerned with construction (by means of perturbative and numerical methods) of\ntime-periodic solutions for various nonlinear wave equations on bounded\ndomains. While turbulence is mainly associated with hydrodynamics, recent\nresearch in General Relativity has also revealed turbulent phenomena. Numerical\nstudies of a self-gravitating massless scalar field in spherical symmetry gave\nevidence that anti-de Sitter space is unstable against black hole formation.

Most previous work either cannot be applied to scenarios where the\nsize of the map collection is large, or simply assumed that the robot\nself-location is globally known. In this paper, we tackle the problem of\nsimultaneous self-localization and change detection, by reformulating the\nproblem as a map retrieval problem, and propose a local map descriptor with a\ncompressed bag-of-words (BoW) structure as a scalable solution. We make the\nfollowing contributions. (1) To enable a direct comparison of the spatial\nlayout of visual features between different local maps, the origin of the local\nmap coordinate (termed \"viewpoint\") is planned by scene parsing and determined\nby our \"viewpoint planner\" to be invariant against small variations in\nself-location and changes, aiming at providing similar viewpoints for similar\nscenes (i.e., the relevant map pair). (2) We extend the BoW model to enable the\nuse of not only the appearance (e.g., polestar) but also the spatial layout\n(e.g., spatial pyramid) of visual features with respect to the planned\nviewpoint. The key observation is that the planned viewpoint (i.e., the origin\nof local map coordinate) acts as a pseudo viewpoint that is usually required by\nspatial BoW (e.g., SPM) and also by anomaly detection (e.g., NN-d, LOF). (3)\nExperimental results on a challenging \"loop-closing\" scenario show that the\nproposed method outperforms previous BoW methods in self-localization, and\nfurthermore, that the use of both appearance and pose information in change\ndetection produces better results than the use of either information alone.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 7 figures, Draft of a paper submitted to an International\n  Conference"]}]

This curious and\nmuch-debated feature is then further scrutinised by considering the double\nscaling limit of a two-matrix integral. For this model, we can show explicitly\nhow this apparent degeneracy is in fact resolved by accounting for\ncontributions invisible in string perturbation theory. Altogether, these\ndevelopments provide novel descriptions of hitherto unexplored boundary\nconditions as well as new insights into the non-perturbative physics of\nboundaries and branes.\n","Comment: 142 pages, 8 figures, PhD thesis, University of Oxford (2015)"]}]

We define the rebuilding ratio as the fraction of remaining\ninformation accessed during the rebuilding of $e$ erasures.
