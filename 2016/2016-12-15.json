We show that,\nunder this distribution, the probability of drawing a path connecting two nodes\ncan easily be computed in closed form by simple matrix inversion. This\nprobability captures a notion of relatedness between nodes of the graph: two\nnodes are considered as highly related when they are connected by many,\npreferably low-cost, paths. As an application, two families of distances\nbetween nodes are derived from the BoP probabilities. Interestingly, the second\ndistance family interpolates between the shortest path distance and the\nresistance distance. In addition, it extends the Bellman-Ford formula for\ncomputing the shortest path distance in order to integrate sub-optimal paths by\nsimply replacing the minimum operator by the soft minimum operator.\nExperimental results on semi-supervised classification show that both of the\nnew distance families are competitive with other state-of-the-art approaches.\nIn addition to the distance measures studied in this paper, the bag-of-paths\nframework enables straightforward computation of many other relevant network\nmeasures.\n","Comment: Manuscript submitted for publication"]}]

However, systematic experimental studies that\ntune the SOC in Kondo insulators remain elusive. The main reason is that\nvariations of (chemical) pressure or doping strongly influence the Kondo\ncoupling $J_{\\text{K}}$ and the chemical potential $\\mu$ -- both essential\nparameters determining the ground state of the material -- and thus possible\nSOC tuning effects have remained unnoticed.

However, theoretical investigations and photoemission\nspectroscopy experiments performed on doped black phosphorus through potassium\nadsorption indicate that in its few-layer form, an exceedingly large electric\nfield in the order of several volts per nanometer is required to effectively\ntune its bandgap, making the direct electrical control unfeasible. Here we\ndemonstrate the tuning of bandgap in intrinsic black phosphorus using an\nelectric field directly and reveal the unique thickness-dependent bandgap\ntuning properties, arising from the strong interlayer electronic-state\ncoupling. Furthermore, leveraging a 10-nm-thick black phosphorus in which the\nfield-induced potential difference across the film dominates over the\ninterlayer coupling, we continuously tune its bandgap from ~300 to below 50\nmilli-electron volts, using a moderate displacement field up to 1.1 volts per\nnanometer. Such dynamic tuning of bandgap may not only extend the operational\nwavelength range of tunable black phosphorus photonic devices, but also pave\nthe way for the investigation of electrically tunable topological insulators\nand topological nodal semimetals.\n"]}]

The exhaustive search inspecting each of the\n$n\\choose k$ possible choices would require a very high computational\ncomplexity and as such is not practical for large $n$ and $k$. Alternative\nmethods with low complexity have recently been investigated but their main\ndrawbacks are that 1) they require perfect knowledge of the measurement matrix\nand 2) they need to be applied at the pace of change of the measurement matrix.\nTo overcome these issues, we consider the asymptotic regime in which $k$, $n$\nand $m$ grow large at the same pace. Tools from random matrix theory are then\nused to approximate in closed-form the most important error measures that are\ncommonly used. The asymptotic approximations are then leveraged to select\nproperly $k$ measurements exhibiting low values for the asymptotic error\nmeasures. Two heuristic algorithms are proposed: the first one merely consists\nin applying the convex optimization artifice to the asymptotic error measure.\nThe second algorithm is a low-complexity greedy algorithm that attempts to look\nfor a sufficiently good solution for the original minimization problem. The\ngreedy algorithm can be applied to both the exact and the asymptotic error\nmeasures and can be thus implemented in blind and channel-aware fashions. We\npresent two potential applications where the proposed algorithms can be used,\nnamely antenna selection for uplink transmissions in large scale multi-user\nsystems and sensor selection for wireless sensor networks.

The hygroscopic swelling of individual fibres and their interactions\nwithin the fibrous network govern the macroscopic response. At this scale,\nmoisture induced instabilities and out-of-plane deformations may occur. This\nwork focuses on several aspects of this issue. A macroscopic phenomenological\nhygro-mechanical model is first proposed, which aims at predicting moisture\ninduced out-of-plane deformations in paper sheets. The constitutive model is\nbased on the relation between these deformations and typical irreversible\nphenomena associated to the history of paper manufacturing, i.e. the release of\ndried-in strains. The model is used to describe bending induced by moisture\ngradients through the thickness of the sheet as well as buckling due to\nmoisture variation in the presence of mechanical constraints. The results of\nthe model show that the anisotropic sheet-level hygro-expansion has a strong\ninfluence on the instability phenomena. Moreover, a comparison with experiments\nprovides adequate semi-quantitative estimates. An additional step is made\ntowards the multi-scale understanding of paper hygro-mechanics. The fundamental\nmechanisms governing the macroscopic moisture induced response are investigated\non the basis of the underlying fibrous network. To this aim, a meso-structural\nmodel is developed which consists of a network of fibres randomly positioned in\na planar region according to an orientation probability density function. A\nseries of network simulations reveals that upon moisture content variations the\nexpansion of the inter-fibre bonding regions drives the overall deformation.\nParticularly in the case of anisotropic fibre orientation, this explains the\norigin of the macro-scale anisotropic hygro-expansion, which is essential for\nthe observed sheet-level instability phenomena.\n"]}]
