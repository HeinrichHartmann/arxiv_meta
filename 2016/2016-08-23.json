Finally, we introduce our open-source scanning software system\n\"3DUNDERWORLD-SLS\" which implements the proposed techniques both in CPU and\nGPU. We have performed extensive testing with a wide range of models and report\nthe results. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the system\nand a comparison with a high-end commercial 3D scanner.\n","Comment: 30 pages describing the 3DUNDERWORLD-SLS open source software by the\n  ICT lab (www.theICTlab.org)"]}]

Of interest is the\npotential to leverage on such latent flexibility in demand to absorb\nvariability in power supplied from intermittent renewable generation. The\nchallenge, however, lies in designing incentives to reliably induce the desired\nresponse in demand. With an eye to electric vehicle charging, we propose a\nnovel forward market for differentiated electric power services, where\nconsumers consent to deferred service of pre-specified loads in exchange for a\nreduced per-unit price for energy. The longer a consumer is willing to defer,\nthe larger the reduction in price. The proposed forward contract provides a\nguarantee on the aggregate quantity of energy to be delivered by a\nconsumer-specified deadline. Under the earliest-deadline-first (EDF) scheduling\npolicy, which is shown to be optimal for the supplier, we explicitly\ncharacterize a non-discriminatory, deadline-differentiated pricing scheme that\nyields an efficient competitive equilibrium between the supplier and consumers.\nWe further show that this efficient pricing scheme, in combination with EDF\nscheduling, is incentive compatible (IC) in that every consumer would like to\nreveal her true deadline to the supplier, regardless of the actions taken by\nother consumers.\n","Comment: IEEE transactions on smart grid, 2016"]}]

Another basic tool\nto determine the mass of a system of stars or galaxies comes from the study of\ntheir motion, as Newton demonstrated with his law of gravitation, which yields\nthe {\\em gravitational mass}.

In earlier work of Grimmett and Li, a locality theorem was proved for\nconnective constants, namely, that the connective constants of two graphs are\nclose in value whenever the graphs agree on a large ball around the origin. A\ncondition of the theorem was that the graphs support so-called 'unimodular\ngraph height functions'. When the graphs are Cayley graphs of infinite,\nfinitely generated groups, there is a special type of unimodular graph height\nfunction termed here a 'group height function'. A necessary and sufficient\ncondition for the existence of a group height function is presented, and may be\napplied in the context of the bridge constant, and of the locality of\nconnective constants for Cayley graphs. Locality may thereby be established for\na variety of infinite groups including those with strictly positive deficiency.\n  It is proved that a large class of Cayley graphs support unimodular graph\nheight functions, that are in addition harmonic on the graph. This implies, for\nexample, the existence of unimodular graph height functions for the Cayley\ngraphs of finitely generated solvable groups. It turns out that graphs with\nnon-unimodular automorphism subgroups also possess graph height functions, but\nthe resulting graph height functions need not be harmonic.\n  Group height functions, as well as the graph height functions of the previous\nparagraph, are non-constant harmonic functions with linear growth and an\nadditional property of having periodic differences. The existence of such\nfunctions on Cayley graphs is a topic of interest beyond their applications in\nthe theory of self-avoiding walks.\n","Comment: v5: Altered title, revision, removal of previous Theorem 3.3"]}]

Because the\nself-force is small, one can often approximate the motion as geodesic. However,\nit is well known that self-force effects accumulate over time, making the\ngeodesic approximation fail on long timescales. It is less well known that this\nfailure at large times translates to a failure at large distances as well. At\nsecond perturbative order, two large-distance pathologies arise: spurious\nsecular growth and infrared-divergent retarded integrals. Both stand in the way\nof practical computations of second-order self-force effects.\n  Utilizing a simple flat-space scalar toy model, I develop methods to overcome\nthese obstacles. The secular growth is tamed with a multiscale expansion that\ncaptures the system's slow evolution. The divergent integrals are eliminated by\nmatching to the correct retarded solution at large distances.

This is an accounting identity\nthat stems from the fact that people with more friends are counted as friends\nby more people. The point of this paper is that this over-representation of the\nmost popular people in others' samples distorts perceptions of norms and\namplifies resulting behaviors to match those perceived norms. I show that there\nare two things that drive people with more friends to behave more extremely\nthan people with fewer friends and thus to distort the perceived norms. The\nfirst is that in any setting with strategic complementarities, people with more\nfriends have more social interaction and hence more complementarity to their\nactions. The second is that people who have the most innate preference for a\ngiven activity form more relationships as they benefit most from the\ncomplementarities. As proven here, these two effects lead people with more\nfriends to choose more extreme actions, which in turn feeds back via the\nfriendship paradox to increase overall perceptions of behavior and then via\ncomplementarities to amplify average behavior. These theoretical results are\nconsistent with the multitude of studies finding that students (from middle\nschool through university) consistently overestimate peer consumption of\nalcohol, cigarettes, and drugs. This amplifies students' own behaviors, and can\nhelp explain problems with adolescent abuse of drugs and binge-drinking, as\nwell as other behaviors.

The problem of matrix\ncompletion can be seen as a special case of this.\n  Today, one of the most widely used techniques is to approximate this\nnon-convex problem using convex nuclear norm regularization.

In addition, thermal\ndilepton radiation enables novel access to (a) the fireball lifetime through\nthe dilepton yield in the low invariant-mass window $0.3 \\; \\mathrm{GeV} \\leq M\n\\leq 0.7 \\; \\mathrm{GeV}$, and (b) the early temperatures of the fireball\nthrough the slope of the invariant-mass spectrum in the intermediate-mass\nregion ($1.5 \\; \\mathrm{GeV} <M< 2.5 \\; \\mathrm{GeV}$).

As such, we in- tend to\ninvestigate how ecological view can be adopted to better explain how the\ncloud-based services evolve, and to explore what are the key factors that drive\nstable and sustainable cloud-based services in the cloud. To achieve this goal,\nwe aim to transpose ecological principles, theories and models into cloud\nautoscaling analogues and spontaneously improve long-term stability and\nsustainability of cloud ecosystem.\n","Comment: submitted for publication, 12 pages, 3 figures, 1 table"]}]

Furthermore, when a receiver is able to learn channel state\ninformation from a certain number of near interferers, higher scaling gains can\nbe achieved when using a successive interference cancellation method.

Two extreme cases are considered: (i) a reduced\nacquisition time that leads to very low photon counts and (ii) a highly\nattenuating environment (such as a turbid medium) which makes the reflectivity\nestimation more difficult at increasing range. Adopting a Bayesian approach,\nthe Poisson distributed observations are combined with prior distributions\nabout the parameters of interest, to build the joint posterior distribution.\nMore precisely, two Markov random field (MRF) priors enforcing spatial\ncorrelations are assigned to the DR images. Under some justified assumptions,\nthe restoration problem (regularized likelihood) reduces to a convex\nformulation with respect to each of the parameters of interest.

Owing to the close\ndistance to Orion (about 1,350 light-year), the effects of stellar feedback on\nthe parental cloud can be studied in detail. Visible-light observations of the\nBar(1) show that the transition between the hot ionised gas and the warm\nneutral atomic gas (the ionisation front) is spatially well separated from the\ntransition from atomic to molecular gas (the dissociation front): about 15\narcseconds or 6,200 astronomical units (one astronomical unit is the Earth-Sun\ndistance). Static equilibrium models(2,3) used to interpret previous\nfar-infrared and radio observations of the neutral gas in the Bar(4,5,6)\n(typically at 10-20 arcsecond resolution) predict an inhomogeneous cloud\nstructure consisting of dense clumps embedded in a lower density extended gas\ncomponent.

In contrast to stationary\nmodel predictions(7,8,9), there is no appreciable offset between the peak of\nthe H2 vibrational emission (delineating the H/H2 transition) and the edge of\nthe observed CO and HCO+ emission. This implies that the H/H2 and C+/C/CO\ntransition zones are very close.

The\ncompression proceeds via slow elastic motion that is interrupted with\navalanche-like bursts of activity as the system collapses to progressively\nhigher densities via plastic rearrangements.

The design employs a fully parallel\narchitecture and operates in two-phases: start-up phase and decoding phase. The\ntwo phase operation keeps the high latency operations off-line, thereby\nreducing the decoding latency during the decoding phase. The design is\nbench-marked with other state-of-the-art designs on the same code that employ\ndifferent algorithms and architectures. The results indicate that the NGDBF\ndecoder has a better area efficiency and a better energy efficiency compared to\nother state-of-art decoders. When the design is operated in medium to high\nsignal to noise ratios, the design is able to provide greater than the required\nminimum throughput of 10Gbps. The design consumes 0.81mm2 of area and has an\nenergy efficiency of 1.7pJ/bit, which are the lowest in the reported\nliterature. The design also provides better error performance compared to other\nsimplified decoder implementations and consumes lesser wire-length compared to\na recently proposed design.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 14 figures, 4 tables"]}]
