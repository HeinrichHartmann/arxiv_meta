However, no unambiguous experimental evidences for the\nexistence of FFLO phases have been observed yet. Recently, spin-imbalanced\nultracold degenerate Fermi gases have emerged as a new powerful platform for\nthe observation of FFLO phases due to their high experimental controllability\nand the lack of disorder. However, in three dimensional degenerate Fermi gases\nwhere the FFLO phases can be described within the simple mean field theory, the\nparameter region for the FFLO phases is too small to be observed in\nexperiments. Recently, we showed that the Rashba type spin-orbit coupling and\nin-plane Zeeman field in three dimensional degenerate Fermi gases provide a\nmore efficient way to create the FFLO phase because (1) the parameter region\nfor the FFLO phase is greatly enlarged in the phase diagram and (2) the FFLO\nphase is stabilized due to the enhanced energy difference between FFLO phase\nand conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) phase.

The construction is based on a particular\nmodel of computation, developed by Alan Turing, with cosmic observers (CO),\ncosmic measures (CM) and cosmic symmetries (CS) described by Turing machines.\nCO machines always start with a blank tape and CM machines take CO's Turing\nnumber (also known as description number or G{\\\" o}del number) as input and\noutput the corresponding probability. Similarly, CS machines take CO's Turing\nnumber as input, but output either one if the CO machines are in the same\nequivalence class or zero otherwise. We argue that CS machines are more\nfundamental than CM machines and, thus, should be used as building blocks in\nconstructing CM machines. We prove the non-computability of a CS machine which\ndiscriminates between two classes of CO machines: mortal that halts in finite\ntime and immortal that runs forever.

Disruptions of the underlying transport mechanisms, often caused by\nmutations that alter single motor characteristics, are known to cause\nneurodegenerative diseases. For example, phosphorylation of kinesin motor\ndomain at the serine residue is implicated in Huntington's disease, with a\nrecent study of phosphorylated and phosphomimetic serine residues indicating\nlowered single motor stalling forces.

However, how to\nchoose appropriate values for the parameters used in the clustering step\nremains an open problem. Moreover, some popular histogram features extracted\nfrom overlapping image blocks may cause a high degree of redundancy and\nmulticollinearity. In this paper, we propose a novel Hough Transform-based\nobject detection approach. First, to address the above issues, we exploit a\nBridge Partial Least Squares (BPLS) technique to establish context-encoded\nHough Regression Models (HRMs), which are linear regression models that cast\nprobabilistic Hough votes to predict object locations. BPLS is an efficient\nvariant of Partial Least Squares (PLS). PLS-based regression techniques\n(including BPLS) can reduce the redundancy and eliminate the multicollinearity\nof a feature set. And the appropriate value of the only parameter used in PLS\n(i.e., the number of latent components) can be determined by using a\ncross-validation procedure. Second, to efficiently handle object scale changes,\nwe propose a novel multi-scale voting scheme. In this scheme, multiple Hough\nimages corresponding to multiple object scales can be obtained simultaneously.\nThird, an object in a test image may correspond to multiple true and false\npositive hypotheses at different scales. Based on the proposed multi-scale\nvoting scheme, a principled strategy is proposed to fuse hypotheses to reduce\nfalse positives by evaluating normalized pointwise mutual information between\nhypotheses. In the experiments, we also compare the proposed HRM approach with\nits several variants to evaluate the influences of its components on its\nperformance.

Associated with each level in the penalty is a tuning parameter which\ncorresponds to a hyperparameter in the hierarchical Bayesian formulation.\nFollowing previous work on Bayesian lassos we consider the estimation of tuning\nparameters through either hierarchical Bayes based on hyperpriors and Gibbs\nsampling or through empirical Bayes based on maximizing the marginal likelihood\nusing a Monte Carlo EM algorithm. For the specific model under consideration we\nfind that these approaches can lead to severe overshrinkage of the regression\nparameter estimates in the high-dimensional setting or when the genetic effects\nare weak. We demonstrate these problems through simulation examples and study\nan approximation to the marginal likelihood which sheds light on the cause of\nthis problem.

Both points are about dualities in string\ntheory, and both have the 'flavour' that two dual theories are 'closer in\ncontent' than you might think. For both points, we adopt a simple conception of\na duality as an 'isomorphism' between theories: more precisely, as appropriate\nbijections between the two theories' sets of states and sets of quantities.\n  The first point (Section 3) is that this conception of duality meshes with\ntwo dual theories being 'gauge related' in the general philosophical sense of\nbeing physically equivalent. For a string duality, such as T-duality and\ngauge/gravity duality, this means taking such features as the radius of a\ncompact dimension, and the dimensionality of spacetime, to be 'gauge'.\n  The second point (Sections 4, 5 and 6) is much more specific. We give a\nresult about gauge/gravity duality that shows its relation to gauge symmetries\n(in the physical sense of symmetry transformations that are\nspacetime-dependent) to be subtler than you might expect.

This may be so in general; and\nindeed, it is suggested by discussions of Polchinski and Horowitz.

The key goal of AL-DRAM is to exploit the extra margin\nthat is built into the DRAM timing parameters to reduce DRAM latency. The key\nobservation is that the timing parameters are dictated by the worst-case\ntemperatures and worst-case DRAM cells, both of which lead to small amount of\ncharge storage and hence high access latency. One can therefore reduce latency\nby adapting the timing parameters to the current operating temperature and the\ncurrent DIMM that is being accessed. Using an FPGA-based testing platform, our\nwork first characterizes the extra margin for 115 DRAM modules from three major\nmanufacturers. The experimental results demonstrate that it is possible to\nreduce four of the most critical timing parameters by a minimum/maximum of\n17.3%/54.8% at 55C while maintaining reliable operation. AL-DRAM adaptively\nselects between multiple different timing parameters for each DRAM module based\non its current operating condition. AL-DRAM does not require any changes to the\nDRAM chip or its interface; it only requires multiple different timing\nparameters to be specified and supported by the memory controller. Real system\nevaluations show that AL-DRAM improves the performance of memory-intensive\nworkloads by an average of 14% without introducing any errors.\n","Comment: This is a summary of the original paper, entitled \"Adaptive-Latency\n  DRAM: Optimizing DRAM Timing for the Common-Case\" which appears in HPCA 2015"]}]

This generality and simplicity in part\nexplains the success of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, in which\nupdates are easy to derive for a wide class of mixture models. However, the\nlikelihood of a mixture model is non-convex, so EM has no known global\nconvergence guarantees. Recently, method of moments approaches offer global\nguarantees for some mixture models, but they do not extend easily to the range\nof mixture models that exist. In this work, we present Polymom, an unifying\nframework based on method of moments in which estimation procedures are easily\nderivable, just as in EM. Polymom is applicable when the moments of a single\nmixture component are polynomials of the parameters. Our key observation is\nthat the moments of the mixture model are a mixture of these polynomials, which\nallows us to cast estimation as a Generalized Moment Problem. We solve its\nrelaxations using semidefinite optimization, and then extract parameters using\nideas from computer algebra. This framework allows us to draw insights and\napply tools from convex optimization, computer algebra and the theory of\nmoments to study problems in statistical estimation.\n","Comment: NIPS 2015"]}]
