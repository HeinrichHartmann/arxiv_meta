The performance of quantum repeaters\ncan be assessed by comparing the attained rate with the quantum and private\ncapacity of direct transmission, assisted by unlimited classical two-way\ncommunication. However, these quantities are hard to compute, motivating the\nsearch for upper bounds. Takeoka, Guha and Wilde found the squashed\nentanglement of a quantum channel to be an upper bound on both these\ncapacities. In general it is still hard to find the exact value of the squashed\nentanglement of a quantum channel, but clever sub-optimal squashing channels\nallow one to upper bound this quantity, and thus also the corresponding\ncapacities.

The field origin is an extension of the gauge freedom for basis\nchoice in gauge theories to the underlying scalar field. The extension is based\non the idea that the value of a number at one space time point does not\ndetermine the value at another point. This, combined with the description of\nmathematical systems as structures of different types, results in the presence\nof separate number fields and vector spaces, both as structures, at different\nspace time locations. Complex number structures and vector spaces at each\nlocation, are scaled by a complex space time dependent scaling factor. The\neffect of this scaling factor on several physical and geometric quantities has\nbeen described in other work. Here the emphasis is on quantum mechanics of one\nand two particles, their states and properties. Multiparticle states are also\nbriefly described. The effect shows as a complex, nonunitary, scalar field\nconnection on a fiber bundle description of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.\nThe lack of physical evidence for the presence of this field so far means that\nthe coupling constant of this field to fermions is very small. It also means\nthat the gradient of the field must be very small in a local region of\ncosmological space and time. Outside this region there are no restrictions on\nthe field gradient.\n","Comment: 21 pages 2 figures"]}]

Such analytic pipelines often involve\ndifferent algorithms across multiple steps, each with its own hyperparameters.\nTo achieve the best performance, it is often critical to select optimal\nalgorithms and to set appropriate hyperparameters, which requires large\ncomputational efforts. Bayesian optimization provides a principled way for\nsearching optimal hyperparameters for a single algorithm. However, many\nchallenges remain in solving pipeline optimization problems with\nhigh-dimensional and highly conditional search space. In this work, we propose\nFast LineAr SearcH (FLASH), an efficient method for tuning analytic pipelines.\nFLASH is a two-layer Bayesian optimization framework, which firstly uses a\nparametric model to select promising algorithms, then computes a nonparametric\nmodel to fine-tune hyperparameters of the promising algorithms. FLASH also\nincludes an effective caching algorithm which can further accelerate the search\nprocess. Extensive experiments on a number of benchmark datasets have\ndemonstrated that FLASH significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art\nmethods in both search speed and accuracy. Using 50% of the time budget, FLASH\nachieves up to 20% improvement on test error rate compared to the baselines.\nFLASH also yields state-of-the-art performance on a real-world application for\nhealthcare predictive modeling.\n","Comment: 21 pages, KDD 2016"]}]

Acquiring data at high b-values contains\nrelevant information and is now of great interest for microstructural and\nconnectomics studies. High noise levels bias the measurements due to the\nnon-Gaussian nature of the noise, which in turn can lead to a false and biased\nestimation of the diffusion parameters. Additionally, the usage of in-plane\nacceleration techniques during the acquisition leads to a spatially varying\nnoise distribution, which depends on the parallel acceleration method\nimplemented on the scanner. This paper proposes a novel diffusion MRI denoising\ntechnique that can be used on all existing data, without adding to the scanning\ntime. We first apply a statistical framework to convert the noise to Gaussian\ndistributed noise, effectively removing the bias. We then introduce a spatially\nand angular adaptive denoising technique, the Non Local Spatial and Angular\nMatching (NLSAM) algorithm. Each volume is first decomposed in small 4D\noverlapping patches to capture the structure of the diffusion data and a\ndictionary of atoms is learned on those patches. A local sparse decomposition\nis then found by bounding the reconstruction error with the local noise\nvariance. We compare against three other state-of-the-art denoising methods and\nshow quantitative local and connectivity results on a synthetic phantom and on\nan in-vivo high resolution dataset. Overall, our method restores perceptual\ninformation, removes the noise bias in common diffusion metrics, restores the\nextracted peaks coherence and improves reproducibility of tractography.

A shock is detected at the sharp outer edge of the\nradio relic, both in the X-ray surface brightness and the temperature profiles.\nThe Mach number is M = 2.54^+0.80_-0.43. The temperature jump at the shock is\nlarger than expected from the density jump, which may indicate that a\ndynamically important magnetic field aligned primarily parallel to the shock\nfront is present. The gas temperature rises gradually over several arc minutes\nwithin the shock region. This could indicate that the shock energy is initially\ndissipated into some mix of thermal and nonthermal (e.g., turbulence)\ncomponents, and that the nonthermal energy decays into heat in the post-shock\nregion. The observed radio relic can be powered if ~0.2% of the energy\ndissipated in the shock goes into the (re)acceleration of relativistic\nelectrons. We show that the observed steepening of the radio spectrum with\ndistance behind the shock is consistent with radiative losses by the\nradio-emitting electrons. However, the radio spectrum immediately behind the\nshock is flatter than expected for linear diffusive shock acceleration of\nthermal electrons. This suggests that the shock re-accelerates a pre-existing\npopulation of relativistic electrons.

In the context of image analysis of synthetic and biological materials,\nthis question is central to the problem of inferring information about\nformation processes from spatial measurements of resulting random structures.\nWe address this question by a theory-based simulation study of shape indices\nderived from Minkowski tensors for a variety of tessellation models. We focus\non the relationship between two indices: an isoperimetric ratio of the\nempirical averages of cell volume and area and the cell elongation quantified\nby eigenvalue ratios of interfacial Minkowski tensors.
