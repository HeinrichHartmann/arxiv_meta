The performance of quantum repeaters\ncan be assessed by comparing the attained rate with the quantum and private\ncapacity of direct transmission, assisted by unlimited classical two-way\ncommunication. However, these quantities are hard to compute, motivating the\nsearch for upper bounds. Takeoka, Guha and Wilde found the squashed\nentanglement of a quantum channel to be an upper bound on both these\ncapacities. In general it is still hard to find the exact value of the squashed\nentanglement of a quantum channel, but clever sub-optimal squashing channels\nallow one to upper bound this quantity, and thus also the corresponding\ncapacities.

In the previous paper\n[J.Phys.A: Math. Theor. 48, 285203 (2015)], we have considered the loops\ncreated by rotors and labeled sites where the loops become closed. The sequence\nof labels in the rotor-router walk was conjectured to form a spiral structure\nobeying asymptotically an Archimedean property. In the present paper, we select\na subset of labels called \"nodes\" and consider spirals formed by nodes. The new\nspirals are directly related to tree-like structures which represent the\nevolution of the cluster of vertices visited by the walk. We show that the\naverage number of visits to the origin $\\left<n_0(t)\\right>$ by the moment\n$t\\gg 1$ is $\\left<n_0(t)\\right> = 4 \\left<n(t)\\right> + O(1)$ where\n$\\left<n(t)\\right>$ is the average number of rotations of the spiral.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 7 figures"]}]

The field origin is an extension of the gauge freedom for basis\nchoice in gauge theories to the underlying scalar field. The extension is based\non the idea that the value of a number at one space time point does not\ndetermine the value at another point. This, combined with the description of\nmathematical systems as structures of different types, results in the presence\nof separate number fields and vector spaces, both as structures, at different\nspace time locations. Complex number structures and vector spaces at each\nlocation, are scaled by a complex space time dependent scaling factor. The\neffect of this scaling factor on several physical and geometric quantities has\nbeen described in other work. Here the emphasis is on quantum mechanics of one\nand two particles, their states and properties. Multiparticle states are also\nbriefly described. The effect shows as a complex, nonunitary, scalar field\nconnection on a fiber bundle description of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.\nThe lack of physical evidence for the presence of this field so far means that\nthe coupling constant of this field to fermions is very small. It also means\nthat the gradient of the field must be very small in a local region of\ncosmological space and time. Outside this region there are no restrictions on\nthe field gradient.\n","Comment: 21 pages 2 figures"]}]

Acquiring data at high b-values contains\nrelevant information and is now of great interest for microstructural and\nconnectomics studies. High noise levels bias the measurements due to the\nnon-Gaussian nature of the noise, which in turn can lead to a false and biased\nestimation of the diffusion parameters. Additionally, the usage of in-plane\nacceleration techniques during the acquisition leads to a spatially varying\nnoise distribution, which depends on the parallel acceleration method\nimplemented on the scanner. This paper proposes a novel diffusion MRI denoising\ntechnique that can be used on all existing data, without adding to the scanning\ntime. We first apply a statistical framework to convert the noise to Gaussian\ndistributed noise, effectively removing the bias. We then introduce a spatially\nand angular adaptive denoising technique, the Non Local Spatial and Angular\nMatching (NLSAM) algorithm. Each volume is first decomposed in small 4D\noverlapping patches to capture the structure of the diffusion data and a\ndictionary of atoms is learned on those patches.

A shock is detected at the sharp outer edge of the\nradio relic, both in the X-ray surface brightness and the temperature profiles.\nThe Mach number is M = 2.54^+0.80_-0.43. The temperature jump at the shock is\nlarger than expected from the density jump, which may indicate that a\ndynamically important magnetic field aligned primarily parallel to the shock\nfront is present. The gas temperature rises gradually over several arc minutes\nwithin the shock region. This could indicate that the shock energy is initially\ndissipated into some mix of thermal and nonthermal (e.g., turbulence)\ncomponents, and that the nonthermal energy decays into heat in the post-shock\nregion. The observed radio relic can be powered if ~0.2% of the energy\ndissipated in the shock goes into the (re)acceleration of relativistic\nelectrons. We show that the observed steepening of the radio spectrum with\ndistance behind the shock is consistent with radiative losses by the\nradio-emitting electrons. However, the radio spectrum immediately behind the\nshock is flatter than expected for linear diffusive shock acceleration of\nthermal electrons. This suggests that the shock re-accelerates a pre-existing\npopulation of relativistic electrons.

In particular, the duality symmetries of string theory\nsuggest scenarios in which the Universe starts inflating from an initial state\ncharacterized by very small curvature and interactions. Such a state, being\ngravitationally unstable, will evolve towards higher curvature and coupling,\nuntil string-size effects and loop corrections make the Universe \"bounce\" into\na standard, decreasing-curvature regime. In such a context, the hot big bang of\nconventional cosmology is replaced by a \"hot big bounce\" in which the bouncing\nand heating mechanisms originate from the quantum production of particles in\nthe high-curvature, large-coupling pre-bounce phase. Here we briefly summarize\nthe main features of this inflationary scenario, proposed a quarter century\nago. In its simplest version (where it represents an alternative and not a\ncomplement to standard slow-roll inflation) it can produce a viable spectrum of\ndensity perturbations, together with a tensor component characterized by a\n\"blue\" spectral index with a peak in the GHz frequency range. That means,\nphenomenologically, a very small contribution to a primordial B-mode in the CMB\npolarization, and the possibility of a large enough stochastic background of\ngravitational waves to be measurable by present or future gravitational wave\ndetectors.\n","Comment: 25 pages, five figures.
