Specifically, whenever two or more\nparticles occupy adjacent sites, they stick together for an extended period of\ntime, and the entire particle system is slowed down until the ``collision'' is\nresolved. We show that under diffusive scaling of space and time such processes\nconverge to what one might refer to as a sticky reflected Brownian motion in\nthe wedge. The latter behaves as a Brownian motion with constant drift vector\nand diffusion matrix in the interior of the wedge, and reflects at the boundary\nof the wedge after spending an instant of time there. In particular, this leads\nto a natural multidimensional generalization of sticky Brownian motion on the\nhalf-line, which is of interest in both queuing theory and stochastic portfolio\ntheory. For instance, this can model a market, which experiences a slowdown due\nto a major event (such as a court trial between some of the largest firms in\nthe market) deciding about the new market leader.\n","Comment: Published at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/14-AAP1019 in the Annals of\n  Applied Probability (http://www.imstat.org/aap/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)"]}]

At the operational sensor temperature of approximately\n$-7\\,^{\\circ}\\rm{C}$, the average rate of sensor current increase is\n$18\\,\\upmu\\rm{A}$ per $\\rm{fb^{-1}}$, in excellent agreement with predictions.\nThe silicon effective bandgap has been determined using current versus\ntemperature scan data after irradiation, with an average value of\n$E_{g}=1.16\\pm0.03\\pm0.04\\,\\rm{eV}$ obtained. The first observation of n-on-n\nsensor type inversion at the LHC has been made, occurring at a fluence of\naround $15 \\times 10 ^{12}$ of $1\\,\\rm{MeV\\,n_{eq}}$. The only n-on-p sensors\nin use at the LHC have also been studied. With an initial fluence of\napproximately $\\rm{3 \\times 10^{12}\\,1\\,MeV\\,n_{eq}}$, a decrease in the\nEffective Depletion Voltage (EDV) of around 25\\,V is observed, attributed to\noxygen induced removal of boron interstitial sites. Following this initial\ndecrease, the EDV increases at a comparable rate to the type inverted n-on-n\ntype sensors, with rates of $(1.43\\pm 0.16) \\times 10 ^{-12}\\,\\rm{V} / \\, 1 \\,\n\\rm{MeV\\,n_{eq}}$ and $(1.35\\pm 0.25) \\times 10 ^{-12}\\,\\rm{V} / \\, 1 \\,\n\\rm{MeV\\,n_{eq}}$ measured for n-on-p and n-on-n type sensors, respectively.

We observed the BL Lac object 1ES 1727+502 in stereoscopic\nmode with the two MAGIC telescopes during 14 nights between May 6th and June\n10th 2011, for a total effective observing time of 12.6 hours. For the study of\nthe multiwavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) we use simultaneous\noptical R-band data from the KVA telescope, archival UV/optical and X-ray\nobservations by instruments UVOT and XRT on board of the Swift satellite and\nhigh energy (HE, 0.1 GeV - 100 GeV) gamma-ray data from the Fermi-LAT\ninstrument. We detect, for the first time, VHE gamma-ray emission from 1ES\n1727+502 at a statistical significance of 5.5 sigma. The integral flux above\n150 GeV is estimated to be (2.1\\pm0.4)% of the Crab Nebula flux and the\nde-absorbed VHE spectrum has a photon index of (2.7\\pm0.5). No significant\nshort-term variability was found in any of the wavebands presented here. We\nmodel the SED using a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model obtaining\nparameters typical for this class of sources.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, submitted to A&A"]}]

These measurements\ncomplement recent analyses by experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\ninvolving central $p$$+$Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$=5.02 TeV, which\nhave indicated strong anisotropic long-range correlations in angular\ndistributions of hadron pairs. The origin of these anisotropies is currently\nunknown. Various competing explanations include parton saturation and\nhydrodynamic flow. We observe qualitatively similar, but larger, anisotropies\nin $d$$+$Au collisions compared to those seen in $p$$+$Pb collisions at the\nLHC. The larger extracted $v_2$ values in $d$$+$Au collisions at RHIC are\nconsistent with expectations from hydrodynamic calculations owing to the larger\nexpected initial-state eccentricity compared with that from $p$$+$Pb\ncollisions. When both are divided by an estimate of the initial-state\neccentricity the scaled anisotropies follow a common trend with multiplicity\nthat may extend to heavy ion data at RHIC and the LHC, where the anisotropies\nare widely thought to arise from hydrodynamic flow.\n","Comment: 375 authors, 7 pages, 5 figures.

The method exploits the\nJordan decomposition which states that a function of bounded variation can be\ndecomposed as the sum of a non-decreasing function and a non-increasing\nfunction. This suggests combining the backfitting algorithm for estimating\nadditive functions with isotonic regression for estimating monotone functions.\nThe resulting iterative algorithm is called Iterative Isotonic Regression\n(I.I.R.). The main technical result in this paper is the consistency of the\nproposed estimator when the number of iterations $k_n$ grows appropriately with\nthe sample size $n$. The proof requires two auxiliary results that are of\ninterest in and by themselves: firstly, we generalize the well-known\nconsistency property of isotonic regression to the framework of a non-monotone\nregression function, and secondly, we relate the backfitting algorithm to Von\nNeumann's algorithm in convex analysis.\n"]}]

Our calibration is based on\na combination of the Orbital Dipole plus the Solar Dipole, caused respectively\nby the motion of the Planck spacecraft with respect to the Sun and by motion of\nthe Solar System with respect to the CMB rest frame. The latter provides a\nsignal of a few mK with the same spectrum as the CMB anisotropies and is\nvisible throughout the mission. In this data release we rely on the\ncharacterization of the Solar Dipole as measured by WMAP. We also present\npreliminary results (at 44GHz only) on the study of the Orbital Dipole, which\nagree with the WMAP value of the Solar System speed within our uncertainties.\nWe compute the calibration constant for each radiometer roughly once per hour,\nin order to keep track of changes in the detectors' gain. Since non-idealities\nin the optical response of the beams proved to be important, we implemented a\nfast convolution algorithm which considers the full beam response in estimating\nthe signal generated by the dipole. Moreover, in order to further reduce the\nimpact of residual systematics due to sidelobes, we estimated time variations\nin the calibration constant of the 30GHz radiometers (the ones with the largest\nsidelobes) using the signal of a reference load. We have estimated the\ncalibration accuracy in two ways: we have run a set of simulations to assess\nthe impact of statistical errors and systematic effects in the instrument and\nin the calibration procedure, and we have performed a number of consistency\nchecks on the data and on the brightness temperature of Jupiter. Calibration\nerrors for this data release are expected to be about 0.6% at 44 and 70 GHz,\nand 0.8% at 30 GHz.

The motion is quantized, therefore a trap geometry combined\nwith two-body contact s-wave interactions influence a spin dynamics through the\nenergy spectrum of the two atom system. Anharmonicity and anisotropy of the\nsite results in a `fine' structure of two body eigenenergies. The structure can\nbe easily resolved by a weak magnetic dipole-dipole interactions.

Thus, we provide the additional conditions for when the\narbitrary ordering of the sources within each dataset is common.

The temperature\ndependence of the low-energy incommensurate magnetic fluctuations reveals\ndistinctly glassy features. The glassiness is confirmed by the difference\nbetween the ordering temperature TN ~ Tc inferred from elastic neutron\nscattering and the freezing temperature Tf ~ 11 K obtained from muon spin\nrotation studies. The magnetic field independence of the observed excitation\nspectrum as well as the observation of a partial suppression of magnetic\nspectral weight below 0.75 meV for temperatures smaller than Tf, indicate that\nthe stripe frozen state is capable of supporting a spin anisotropy gap, of a\nmagnitude similar to that observed in the spin and charge stripe ordered ground\nstate of La1.875Ba0.125CuO4. The difference between TN and Tf implies that the\nsignificant enhancement in a magnetic field of nominally elastic incommensurate\nscattering is caused by strictly in-elastic scattering -- at least in the\ntemperature range between Tf and Tc -- which is not resolved in the present\nexperiment. Combining the results obtained from our study of La1.88Sr0.12CuO4\nwith a critical reappraisal of published neutron scattering work on samples\nwith chemical composition close to p=0.12, where local probes indicate a sharp\nmaximum in Tf(p), we arrive at the view that the low-energy fluctuations are\nstrongly dependent on composition in this regime, with anisotropy gaps\ndominating only sufficiently close to p=0.12 and superconducting spin gaps\ndominating elsewhere.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures"]}]

An efficient approach is to specify GRFs via stochastic partial\ndifferential equations (SPDEs) and derive Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF)\napproximations of the solutions. We consider the construction of a class of\nnon-stationary GRFs with varying local anisotropy, where the local anisotropy\nis introduced by allowing the coefficients in the SPDE to vary with position.\nThis is done by using a form of diffusion equation driven by Gaussian white\nnoise with a spatially varying diffusion matrix. This allows for the\nintroduction of parameters that control the GRF by parametrizing the diffusion\nmatrix. These parameters and the GRF may be considered to be part of a\nhierarchical model and the parameters estimated in a Bayesian framework. The\nresults show that the use of an SPDE with non-constant coefficients is a\npromising way of creating non-stationary spatial GMRFs that allow for physical\ninterpretability of the parameters, although there are several remaining\nchallenges that would need to be solved before these models can be put to\ngeneral practical use.\n"]}]

The calculated neutron rate from radioactivity of 1.0-3.1\nevents (90% C.L.) at 20-200 keV in the EDELWEISS-II data together with the\nexpected upper limit on the misidentified gamma-ray events ($\\le0.9$), surface\nbetas ($\\le0.3$), and muon-induced neutrons ($\\le0.7$), do not contradict 5\nobserved events in nuclear recoil band.

The cluster appears\nrelaxed in its X-ray emission, but has significant amounts of intracluster\nlight which is not centrally concentrated, suggesting that galaxy-scale\ninteractions are still ongoing despite the overall relaxed state. The cluster\nlenses 12 background galaxies into multiple images and one galaxy at $z=1.033$\ninto a giant arc and its counterimage. The multiple image positions and the\nsurface brightness distribution (SFB) of the arc which is bent around several\ncluster members are sensitive to the cluster galaxy halo properties. We model\nthe cluster mass distribution with a NFW profile and the galaxy halos with two\nparameters for the mass normalization and extent of a reference halo assuming\nscalings with their observed NIR--light. We match the multiple image positions\nat an r.m.s. level of $0.85\\arcsec$ and can reconstruct the SFB distribution of\nthe arc in several filters to a remarkable accuracy based on this cluster\nmodel. The length scale where the enclosed galaxy halo mass is best constrained\nis about 5 effective radii -- a scale in between those accessible to dynamical\nand field strong lensing mass estimates on one hand and galaxy--galaxy weak\nlensing results on the other hand. The velocity dispersion and halo size of a\ngalaxy with $m_{\\rm 160W,AB}=19.2$ or $M_{\\rm B,Vega}=-20.7$ are $\\sigma=150\n\\rm kms^{-1}$ and $r\\approx 26\\pm 6 \\rm kpc$, indicating that the halos of the\ncluster galaxies are tidally stripped.

CROM combines the cluster analysis pioneered in Gunzburger's\ngroup (Burkardt et al. 2006) and and transition matrix models introduced in\nfluid dynamics in Eckhardt's group (Schneider et al. 2007). CROM constitutes a\npotential alternative to POD models and generalises the Ulam-Galerkin method\nclassically used in dynamical systems to determine a finite-rank approximation\nof the Perron-Frobenius operator. The proposed strategy processes a\ntime-resolved sequence of flow snapshots in two steps. First, the snapshot data\nare clustered into a small number of representative states, called centroids,\nin the state space. These centroids partition the state space in complementary\nnon-overlapping regions (centroidal Voronoi cells). Departing from the standard\nalgorithm, the probabilities of the clusters are determined, and the states are\nsorted by analysis of the transition matrix. Secondly, the transitions between\nthe states are dynamically modelled using a Markov process. Physical mechanisms\nare then distilled by a refined analysis of the Markov process, e.g. using\nfinite-time Lyapunov exponent and entropic methods. This CROM framework is\napplied to the Lorenz attractor (as illustrative example), to velocity fields\nof the spatially evolving incompressible mixing layer and the three-dimensional\nturbulent wake of a bluff body. For these examples, CROM is shown to identify\nnon-trivial quasi-attractors and transition processes in an unsupervised\nmanner. CROM has numerous potential applications for the systematic\nidentification of physical mechanisms of complex dynamics, for comparison of\nflow evolution models, for the identification of precursors to desirable and\nundesirable events, and for flow control applications exploiting nonlinear\nactuation dynamics.\n","Comment: 48 pages, 30 figures.

X-ray polarimetry investigates the\nacceleration process, for example, including those typical of magnetic\nreconnection in solar flares, but also emission in the strong magnetic fields\nof neutron stars and white dwarfs. It detects scattering in asymmetric\nstructures such as accretion disks and columns, and in the so-called molecular\ntorus and ionization cones. In addition, it allows fundamental physics in\nregimes of gravity and of magnetic field intensity not accessible to\nexperiments on the Earth to be probed. Finally, models that describe\nfundamental interactions (e.g. quantum gravity and the extension of the\nStandard Model) can be tested. We describe in this paper the X-ray Imaging\nPolarimetry Explorer (XIPE), proposed in June 2012 to the first ESA call for a\nsmall mission with a launch in 2017 but not selected. XIPE is composed of two\nout of the three existing JET-X telescopes with two Gas Pixel Detectors (GPD)\nfilled with a He-DME mixture at their focus and two additional GPDs filled with\npressurized Ar-DME facing the sun. The Minimum Detectable Polarization is 14 %\nat 1 mCrab in 10E5 s (2-10 keV) and 0.6 % for an X10 class flare. The Half\nEnergy Width, measured at PANTER X-ray test facility (MPE, Germany) with JET-X\noptics is 24 arcsec. XIPE takes advantage of a low-earth equatorial orbit with\nMalindi as down-link station and of a Mission Operation Center (MOC) at INPE\n(Brazil).\n","Comment: 49 pages, 14 figures, 6 tables.

In this article we introduce a family of explicit numerical\napproximations for the SDEs and derive conditions that allow to use\nKhasminski's techniques in the context of numerical approximations,\nparticularly in the case where SDEs have non globally Lipschitz coefficients.\n  Consequently, we show that it is possible to construct a numerical scheme,\nthat is bounded in expectation with respect to a Lyapunov function, and/or\ninherit the asymptotic stability property from the SDEs.

All-sky model of thermal dust emission"],"description":["  This paper presents an all-sky model of dust emission from the Planck 857,\n545 and 353 GHz, and IRAS 100 micron data. Using a modified black-body fit to\nthe data we present all-sky maps of the dust optical depth, temperature, and\nspectral index over the 353-3000 GHz range. This model is a tight\nrepresentation of the data at 5 arc min. It shows variations of the order of 30\n% compared with the widely-used model of Finkbeiner, Davis, and Schlegel. The\nPlanck data allow us to estimate the dust temperature uniformly over the whole\nsky, providing an improved estimate of the dust optical depth compared to\nprevious all-sky dust model, especially in high-contrast molecular regions. An\nincrease of the dust opacity at 353 GHz, tau_353/N_H, from the diffuse to the\ndenser interstellar medium (ISM) is reported. It is associated with a decrease\nin the observed dust temperature, T_obs, that could be due at least in part to\nthe increased dust opacity. We also report an excess of dust emission at HI\ncolumn densities lower than 10^20 cm^-2 that could be the signature of dust in\nthe warm ionized medium. In the diffuse ISM at high Galactic latitude, we\nreport an anti-correlation between tau_353/N_H and T_obs while the dust\nspecific luminosity, i.e., the total dust emission integrated over frequency\n(the radiance) per hydrogen atom, stays about constant. The implication is that\nin the diffuse high-latitude ISM tau_353 is not as reliable a tracer of dust\ncolumn density as we conclude it is in molecular clouds where the correlation\nof tau_353 with dust extinction estimated using colour excess measurements on\nstars is strong. To estimate Galactic E(B-V) in extragalactic fields at high\nlatitude we develop a new method based on the thermal dust radiance, instead of\nthe dust optical depth, calibrated to E(B-V) using reddening measurements of\nquasars deduced from Sloan Digital Sky Survey data.\n","Comment: 37 pages. accepted version.

Nanophotonic waveguides are particularly well suited for such\napplications since they confine photon propagation to a 1D geometry thereby\nincreasing the interaction between light and matter. Adding chiral\nfunctionalities to nanophotonic waveguides lead to new opportunities enabling\nintegrated and robust quantum-photonic devices or the observation of novel\ntopological photonic states. In a regular waveguide, a quantum emitter radiates\nphotons in either of two directions, and photon emission and absorption are\nreverse processes. This symmetry is violated in nanophotonic structures where a\nnon-transversal local electric field implies that both photon emission and\nscattering may become directional. Here we experimentally demonstrate that the\ninternal state of a quantum emitter determines the chirality of single-photon\nemission in a specially engineered photonic-crystal waveguide. Single-photon\nemission into the waveguide with a directionality of more than 90\\% is observed\nunder conditions where practically all emitted photons are coupled to the\nwaveguide. Such deterministic and highly directional photon emission enables\non-chip optical diodes, circulators operating at the single-photon level, and\ndeterministic quantum gates.

To mitigate this risk, machine learning\nalgorithms can add noise to outputs according to the formulations provided by\ndifferential privacy.

Capable of Turing universal computation, the\naTAM allows algorithmic self-assembly, in which the components can be designed\nso that the rules governing their behaviors force them to inherently execute\nprescribed algorithms as they combine. Adding to its completeness, the aTAM was\nshown to also be intrinsically universal, which means that there exists a\nsingle tile set such that for any arbitrary input aTAM system, that tile set\ncan be configured into a seed structure which will then cause self-assembly\nusing that tile set to simulate the input system, capturing its full dynamics\nmodulo only a scale factor.

Under Gaussian assumption, the\nMLE converts to a nonlinear least squares (NLS) problem. Efficient solutions to\nNLS exist and they are based on iteratively solving sparse linear systems until\nconvergence. In general, the existing solutions provide only an estimation of\nthe mean state vector, the resulting covariance being computationally too\nexpensive to recover. Nevertheless, in many simultaneous localisation and\nmapping (SLAM) applications, knowing only the mean vector is not enough. Data\nassociation, obtaining reduced state representations, active decisions and next\nbest view are only a few of the applications that require fast state covariance\nrecovery. Furthermore, computer vision and robotic applications are in general\nperformed online. In this case, the state is updated and recomputed every step\nand its size is continuously growing, therefore, the estimation process may\nbecome highly computationally demanding. This paper introduces a general\nframework for incremental MLE called SLAM++, which fully benefits from the\nincremental nature of the online applications, and provides efficient\nestimation of both the mean and the covariance of the estimate. Based on that,\nwe propose a strategy for maintaining a sparse and scalable state\nrepresentation for large scale mapping, which uses information theory measures\nto integrate only informative and non-redundant contributions to the state\nrepresentation.

With the CERN\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC), the energy stored in particle beams has reached a\nvalue two orders of magnitude above previous accelerators and poses new threats\nwith respect to hazards from the energy stored in the particle beams.

Besides coping with convergence\nstagnation, this new topology allows several adaptive algorithms (e.g., mixed\nnorm, data reusing, and variable step size) to be posed as combinations of\nsimple adaptive filters, bridging an important conceptual gap. Steady-state and\ntracking analysis accounting for a myriad of component filters are derived for\ncombinations with and without feedback. Transient analyses of the typical\nconvex and affine supervisors are extended to general activation functions and\napplied to combinations with cyclic coefficients feedback. Numerical examples\nare provided to illustrate how coefficients feedback can improve the\nperformance of several existing parallel combinations at a small additional\ncomputational cost.\n"]}]
