The shapes refer to the components of dark matter (DM), stars and\ngas at the stellar half-mass radius. Most galaxies undergo a characteristic\ncompaction event into a blue nugget at $z\\sim2-4$, which marks the transition\nfrom a DM-dominated central body to a self-gravitating baryonic core. We find\nthat in the high-$z$, DM-dominated phase, the stellar and DM systems tend to be\ntriaxial, preferentially prolate and mutually aligned. The elongation is\nsupported by an anisotropic velocity dispersion that originates from the\nassembly of the galaxy along a dominant large-scale filament. We estimate that\ntorques by the dominant halo are capable of inducing the elongation of the\nstellar system and its alignment with the halo. Then, in association with the\ntransition to self-gravity, small-pericenter orbits puff up and the DM and\nstellar systems evolve into a more spherical and oblate configuration, aligned\nwith the gas disc and associated with rotation. This transition typically\noccurs when the stellar mass is $\\sim 10^9$ M$_\\odot$ and the escape velocity\nin the core is $\\sim 100$ km s$^{-1}$, indicating that supernova feedback may\nbe effective in keeping the core DM-dominated and the system prolate.

Advanced regularized iterative methods, such as total\nvariation minimization, are often able to achieve a higher reconstruction\nquality by exploiting prior knowledge about the scanned object. In practice,\nhowever, these methods often have prohibitively long computation times or large\nmemory requirements. Furthermore, since they are based on minimizing a global\nobjective function, regularized iterative methods need to reconstruct the\nentire scanned object, even when one is only interested in a (small) region of\nthe reconstructed image.\n  In this paper, we present a method to approximate regularized iterative\nreconstruction methods inside a (small) region of the scanned object. The\nmethod only performs computations inside the region of interest, ensuring low\ncomputational requirements. Reconstruction results for different phantom images\nand types of regularization are given, showing that reconstructions of the\nproposed local method are almost identical to those of the global regularized\niterative methods that are approximated, even for relatively small regions of\ninterest.

This transition\nof the constants of motion is a reflection of an essential difference between\n2D and 3D systems, because the conservation of the (generalized) enstrophy\nimposes stronger constraints, than the helicity, on the flow. In this paper, we\nmake a deeper inquiry into the helicity-enstrophy interplay: the ideal fluid\nmechanics is cast into a Hamiltonian form in the phase space of Clebsch\nparameters, generalizing 2D to a wider category of epi-2D flows (2D embedded in\n3D has zero helicity, while the converse is not true -- our epi-2D category\nencompasses a wider class of zero-helicity flows); how helicity degenerates and\nis substituted by a new constant is delineated; and how a further generalized\nenstrophy is introduced as a constant of motion applying to epi-2D flow is\ndescribed.\n"]}]

The embed method revolutionizes updating\nof object databases. One embed method call can replace dozens of lines of\ncomplicated updating code in a traditional client program of an object\ndatabase, which is a huge improvement. As a declarative method the embed method\ntakes only one natural parameter, the root object of a modified object\nstructure in the run-time memory, which makes it extremely easy to use.The\ncommunication theory behind the embed method states that modified complex\ninformation represented as a directed graph of nodes can always be transferred\nback to its original system in an exact and meaningful way. The theory can also\nhave additional applications since today information often has a network or\ndirected graph like structure and it often evolves or it is maintained. The\nembed method applies the communication theory by modeling the object database\nand a modified object structure in the run-time memory as directed graphs of\nnodes without any artificial limitations. For example, different kinds of\ncircular substructures and their modifications are allowed. Persistence in the\nobject database is defined in a well known and accepted way, by reachability\nfrom persistent root objects. The embed method also removes structures of\ngarbage objects from the object database if any appear during the update\noperation, leaving the database in a consistent state. The embed method applies\nreference counting techniques. It understands local topology of the object\ndatabase, avoiding examining unrelated objects in the database. For these\nreasons, the embed method is efficient and it scales for databases of different\nsizes.\n"]}]

Thus, locally homogeneous\nmultisymplectic manifolds extend the family of classical geometries possessing\na similar property: symplectic, volume and contact. The proof of the first\nresult relies on the characterization of invariant differential forms with\nrespect to the graded Lie algebra of infinitesimal automorphisms, and on the\nstudy of the local properties of Hamiltonian vector fields on locally\nmultisymplectic manifolds. In particular it is proved that the group of\nmultisymplectic diffeomorphisms acts (strongly locally) transitively on the\nmanifold. It is also shown that the graded Lie algebra of infinitesimal\nautomorphisms of a locally homogeneous multisymplectic manifold characterizes\ntheir multisymplectic diffeomorphisms.\n","Comment: 25 p.; LaTeX file.
