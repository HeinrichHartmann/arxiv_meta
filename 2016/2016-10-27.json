Due\nto the ultra-light boson mass, the SFDM could form Bose-Einstein condensates in\nthe very early universe, which are interpreted as the dark matter haloes.\nAlthough cosmologically the model behaves as CDM, they differ at small scales:\nSFDM naturally predicts fewer satellite haloes, cores in dwarf galaxies and the\nformation of massive galaxies at high redshifts.

For this reason, it is often\ndifficult to state with complete certainty that overfishing is the cause of the\ndecline of a fishery. In this study, we developed a simple dynamic model based\non the earlier, well-known Lotka-Volterra model or Prey-Predator model. To\ndescribe exploitation patterns, we assume that the fish stock and the fishing\nindustry are coupled stock variables in the model and they dynamically affect\neach other, with the fishing yield proportional to both the fishing capital and\nthe fish stock. The model is based on the concept that the fishing industry\nacts as the predator of the resource and that its growth and subsequent decline\nis directly related to the abundance of the fish stock. If the model can be fit\nhistorical data relative to specific fisheries, then it is a strong indication\nthat the fishing industry is strongly affected by the magnitude of the fish\nstock and that, in particular, the decline of the yield and the decline of the\nstock are linked to each other.

After\nvalidating the aggregated-level inferences of this model against results of\nrelated work and on simple prediction tasks, we apply the model to better\nunderstand the phenomenon of political polarization in the Texas, New York, and\nOhio electorates. Taken at face value, inferences drawn from our model indicate\nthat the electorates in these states may be less bimodal than the distribution\nof candidates, but that the electorates are comparatively more extreme in their\nvariance. We conclude with a discussion of limitations of our method and\npotential future directions for research.\n","Comment: To be published in the 8th International Conference on Social\n  Informatics (SocInfo) 2016"]}]

Quantum measurement, or sharp\nmeasurement, is usually used to read the information contents of that unknown\nqubit system. Quantum measurement is an irreversible operation that makes the\nsuperposition collapses to one of the two possible states in a probabilistic\nway. In this paper, a quantum algorithm will be proposed to read the\ninformation in an unknown qubit without applying sharp measurement on that\nqubit. The proposed algorithm will use a quantum feedback control scheme by\napplying sharp measurement iteratively on an auxiliary qubit weakly entangled\nwith the unknown qubit. The information contents of the unknown qubit can be\nread by counting the outcomes from the sharp measurement on the auxiliary\nqubit. Iterative measurements on the auxiliary qubit will make the amplitudes\nof the superposition move in a random walk manner where a weak measurement is\napplied on the unknown qubit which can be reversed when the random walk takes\nopposite steps to decrease the disturbance introduced to the system. The\nproposed algorithm will define the strength of the weak measurement so that it\ncan be controlled by adding an arbitrary number of dummy qubits $\\mu$ to the\nsystem.

Moreover,\nthis marked statistic would amplify signatures of shielded modified gravity\nmodels and includes information not available to the power spectrum. I show\nthat a linear real-space power spectrum with a Kaiser factor and a Lorentzian\ndamping yields a significant bias without clipping, but that this may be\nremoved with a strict threshold; similar behaviour is observed for the data.\nEstimates of $f \\sigma_8$ for different thresholds are highly correlated, but\nthis may be obtained using mocks. A maximum likelihood estimate from a\ncombination of thresholds is shown to achieve a 16% decrease in statistical\nerror relative to a single-threshold estimate.

Existing\nworks considered improving the task accuracy through voting or learning\nmethods, they usually did not fully take into account reducing the latency of\nthe task completion. When a task requester posts a group of tasks (e.g.,\nsentiment analysis), and one can only obtain answers of all tasks after the\nlast task is accomplished. As a consequence, the time delay of even one task in\nthis group could delay the next step of the task requester's work from minutes\nto days, which is quite undesirable for the task requester.\n  Inspired by the importance of the task accuracy and latency, in this paper,\nwe will propose a novel crowdsourcing framework, namely Fast and Reliable\ncrOwdsourcinG framework (FROG), which intelligently assigns tasks to workers,\nsuch that the latencies of tasks are reduced and the expected accuracies of\ntasks are met. Specifically, our FROG framework consists of two important\ncomponents, task scheduler and notification modules. For the task scheduler\nmodule, we formalize a FROG task scheduling (FROG-TS) problem, in which the\nserver actively assigns workers with tasks with high reliability and low\nlatency. We prove that the FROG-TS problem is NP-hard. Thus, we design two\nheuristic approaches, request-based and batch-based scheduling. For the\nnotification module, we define an efficient worker notifying (EWN) problem,\nwhich only sends task invitations to those workers with high probabilities of\naccepting the tasks. To tackle the EWN problem, we propose a smooth kernel\ndensity estimation approach to estimate the probability that a worker accepts\nthe task invitation.

Here,\nwe show that the optical 2D photon echo spectra of this complex at ambient\ntemperature in aqueous solution do not provide evidence of any long-lived\nelectronic quantum coherence, but confirm the orthodox view of rapidly decaying\nelectronic quantum coherence on a time scale of 60 fs. Our results give no hint\nthat electronic quantum coherence plays any biofunctional role in real\nphotoactive biomolecular complexes. Since this natural energy transfer complex\nis rather small and has a structurally well defined protein with the distances\nbetween bacteriochlorophylls being comparable to other light-harvesting\ncomplexes, we anticipate that this finding is general and directly applies to\neven larger photoactive biomolecular complexes.\n"]}]

When the field approaches the $\\it{ab}$-planes, two different\nregimes are observed at low temperatures as a consequence of the transition\nbetween 3D-Abrikosov and 2D-Josephson vortices: one is determined by the\nformation of a vortex staircase structure and one by lock-in of the vortices\nparallel to the layers. This is the first study on FBS showing this behaviour\nin a full temperature, field, and angular range and it demonstrates that,\ndespite the lower $T_c$ and anisotropy of Nd1111 with respect to Sm1111, this\ncompound is substantially affected by intrinsic pinning generating a strong\n$\\it{ab}$-peak in $J_c$.\n","Comment: Final version available on Scientific Reports (Open access)"]}]

Most existing solutions to this optimization problem\neither involve simplifying assumptions/relaxations or are computationally\nexpensive. We propose a new greedy and adaptive matching pursuit (AMP)\nalgorithm to directly solve this hard problem.

In addition, the\nintermediate steps of the algorithm are calculated via an inexpensive Cholesky\ndecomposition which makes the algorithm much faster.
