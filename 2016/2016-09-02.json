The\nmathematical analysis of deep convolutional neural networks for feature\nextraction was initiated by Mallat, 2012. Specifically, Mallat considered\nso-called scattering networks based on a wavelet transform followed by the\nmodulus non-linearity in each network layer, and proved translation invariance\n(asymptotically in the wavelet scale parameter) and deformation stability of\nthe corresponding feature extractor. This paper complements Mallat's results by\ndeveloping a theory of deep convolutional neural networks for feature\nextraction encompassing general convolutional transforms, or in more technical\nparlance, general semi-discrete frames (including Weyl-Heisenberg, curvelet,\nshearlet, ridgelet, and wavelet frames), general Lipschitz-continuous\nnon-linearities (e.g., rectified linear units, shifted logistic sigmoids,\nhyperbolic tangents, and modulus functions), and general Lipschitz-continuous\npooling operators emulating sub-sampling and averaging. In addition, all of\nthese elements can be different in different network layers. For the resulting\nfeature extractor we prove a translation invariance result which is of vertical\nnature in the sense of the network depth determining the amount of invariance,\nand we establish deformation sensitivity bounds that apply to signal classes\nwith inherent deformation insensitivity such as, e.g., band-limited functions.\n","Comment: IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, submitted"]}]

Much of this comes in the form of linear features which are\nmost often assumed to be well aligned with the direction of the magnetic field\nin the low plasma beta regime thought to dominate the upper chromosphere. We\nuse advanced radiative MHD simulations including the effects of ion-neutral\ninteractions (using the generalized Ohm's law) in the partially ionized\nchromosphere to show that the magnetic field is often not well aligned with\nchromospheric features. This occurs where the ambipolar diffusion is large,\ni.e., ions and neutral populations decouple as the ion-neutral collision\nfrequency drops allowing the field to slip through the neutral population,\ncurrents perpendicular to the field are strong, and thermodynamic timescales\nare longer than or similar to the those of ambipolar diffusion. We find this\noften happens in dynamic spicule or fibril-like features at the top of the\nchromosphere. This has important consequences for field extrapolation methods\nwhich increasingly use such upper chromospheric features to help constrain the\nchromospheric magnetic field: our results invalidate the underlying assumption\nthat these features are aligned with the field. In addition, our results cast\ndoubt on results from 1D hydrodynamic models, which assume that plasma remains\non the same field lines.

Recent observations and\nreinterpretation of previous observations have revealed the existence of ring\nsystems around 10199 Chariklo and 2060 Chiron. However, the origin of the ring\nsystems around such a minor planet is still an open question. Here, we propose\nthat the tidal disruption of a differentiated object that experiences a close\nencounter with a giant planet could naturally form diverse ring-satellite\nsystems around the Centaurs. During the close encounter, the icy mantle of the\npassing object is preferentially ripped off by the planet's tidal force and the\ndebris is distributed mostly within the Roche limit of the largest remnant\nbody. Assuming the existence of $20-50$wt% silicate core below the icy mantle,\na disk of particles is formed when the objects pass within $0.4-0.8$ of the\nplanet's Roche limit with the relative velocity at infinity $3-6$km s$^{-1}$\nand 8h initial spin period of the body. The resultant ring mass is $0.1-10$% of\nthe central object's mass. Such particle disks are expected to spread radially,\nand materials spreading beyond the Roche limit would accrete into satellite(s).\nOur numerical results suggest that ring formation would be a natural outcome of\nsuch extreme close encounters and Centaurs can naturally have such ring systems\nbecause they cross the orbits of the giant planets.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 3 figures, published in ApJL"]}]

Standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) detectors fail if parts of\nthe detection window are occluded, since not every sub-part of the window is\ndiscriminative on its own. To address this issue, we propose a novel loss layer\nfor CNNs, named grid loss, which minimizes the error rate on sub-blocks of a\nconvolution layer independently rather than over the whole feature map. This\nresults in parts being more discriminative on their own, enabling the detector\nto recover if the detection window is partially occluded. By mapping our loss\nlayer back to a regular fully connected layer, no additional computational cost\nis incurred at runtime compared to standard CNNs.

We empirically demonstrate that the recognition of objects and scenes\nsubstantially contributes to the recognition of events. Meanwhile, we propose\nan iterative selection method to identify a subset of object and scene classes,\nwhich help to more efficiently and effectively transfer their deep\nrepresentations to event recognition. Specifically, we develop three types of\ntransferring techniques: (1) initialization-based transferring, (2)\nknowledge-based transferring, and (3) data-based transferring. These newly\ndesigned transferring techniques exploit multi-task learning frameworks to\nincorporate extra knowledge from other networks and additional datasets into\nthe training procedure of event CNNs. These multi-task learning frameworks turn\nout to be effective in reducing the effect of over-fitting and improving the\ngeneralization ability of the learned CNNs. With OS2E-CNN, we design a\nmulti-ratio and multi-scale cropping strategy, and propose an end-to-end event\nrecognition pipeline. We perform experiments on three event recognition\nbenchmarks: the ChaLearn Cultural Event Recognition dataset, the Web Image\nDataset for Event Recognition (WIDER), and the UIUC Sports Event dataset. The\nexperimental results show that our proposed algorithm successfully adapts\nobject and scene representations towards the event dataset and that it achieves\nthe current state-of-the-art performance on these challenging datasets.\n","Comment: 20 pages"]}]

It is\nassumed that particles react via a single-step, first-order Arrhenius surface\nreaction with an oxidizer delivered to the particle surface through gas\ndiffusion. Unlike the majority of models previously developed for flames in\nsuspensions, no external parameters are imposed, such as particle ignition\ntemperature, combustion time, or the assumption of either kinetic- or\ndiffusion-limited particle combustion regimes. Instead, it is demonstrated that\nthese parameters are characteristic values of the flame propagation problem\nthat must be solved together with the burning velocity, and that the a priori\nimposition of these parameters from single-particle combustion data may result\nin erroneous predictions. It is also shown that both diffusive and kinetic\nreaction regimes can alternate within the same flame and that their interaction\nmay result in non-trivial flame behavior. In fuel-lean mixtures, it is\ndemonstrated that this interaction leads to certain particle size ranges where\nburning velocity increases with increasing particle size, opposite to the\nexpected trend. For even leaner mixtures, the interplay between kinetic and\ndiffusive reaction rates leads to the appearance of a new type of flame\ninstability where kinetic and diffusive regimes alternate in time, resulting in\na pulsating regime of flame propagation.\n","Comment: Published online in the Proceedings of the Combustion Institute"]}]
