We propose a new methodology for\ngeneralizing measures of unweighted networks through a generalization of the\ncardinality concept of a set of weights. The key observation here is that many\nmeasures of unweighted networks use the cardinality (the size) of some subset\nof edges in their computation. For example, the node degree is the number of\nedges incident to a node. We define the effective cardinality, a new metric\nthat quantifies how many edges are effectively being used, assuming that an\nedge's weight reflects the amount of interaction across that edge. We prove\nthat a generalized measure, using our method, reduces to the original\nunweighted measure if there is no disparity between weights, which ensures that\nthe laws that govern the original unweighted measure will also govern the\ngeneralized measure when the weights are equal. We also prove that our\ngeneralization ensures a partial ordering (among sets of weighted edges) that\nis consistent with the original unweighted measure, unlike previously developed\ngeneralizations. We illustrate the applicability of our method by generalizing\nfour unweighted network measures. As a case study, we analyze four real-world\nweighted networks using our generalized degree and clustering coefficient. The\nanalysis shows that the generalized degree distribution is consistent with the\npower-law hypothesis but with steeper decline and that there is a common\npattern governing the ratio between the generalized degree and the traditional\ndegree. The analysis also shows that nodes with more uniform weights tend to\ncluster with nodes that also have more uniform weights among themselves.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 10 figures"]}]

However,\nlittle work has been done in the robust coding of encrypted images. The\nexisting results in these two individual research areas cannot be combined\ndirectly for the robust coding of encrypted images. This is because the robust\ncoding of natural images relies on the elimination of spatial correlations\nusing sparse transforms such as discrete wavelet transform (DWT), which is\nineffective to encrypted images due to the weak correlation between encrypted\npixels. Moreover, the compression of encrypted images always generates code\nstreams with different significance. If one or more such streams are lost, the\nquality of the reconstructed images may drop substantially or decoding error\nmay exist, which violates the goal of robust coding of encrypted images. In\nthis work, we intend to design a robust coder, based on compressive sensing\nwith structurally random matrix, for encrypted images over packet transmission\nnetworks. The proposed coder can be applied in the scenario that Alice needs a\nsemi-trusted channel provider Charlie to encode and transmit the encrypted\nimage to Bob. In particular, Alice first encrypts an image using globally\nrandom permutation and then sends the encrypted image to Charlie who samples\nthe encrypted image using a structural matrix. Through an imperfect channel\nwith packet loss, Bob receives the compressive measurements and reconstructs\nthe original image by joint decryption and decoding.

A direct consequence of such an effect\nis easy destruction of skyrmions at the nanotrack edges during their fast\nmotions along the nanotrack, despite their topological protection.

The skyrmion Hall effect\nis completely suppressed due to the cancellation of back-action forces acting\non each individual skyrmion, resulting in a straight and fast motion of\nskyrmions along the current direction. This proposal will be of fundamental\ninterests by introducing the bilayer degree of freedom into the system.\nMoreover, it provides an easy way to engineer the transport properties of the\nskyrmionic devices to achieve desired performance, making it highly promising\nfor practical applications such as ultradense memory and information-processing\ndevices based on skyrmions.\n"]}]

We also study their possible directional correlations using a\nlikelihood method stacking the neutrino arrival directions and adopting\ndifferent assumptions on the size of the UHECR magnetic deflections. Finally,\nwe perform another likelihood analysis stacking the UHECR directions and using\na sample of through-going muon tracks optimized for neutrino point-source\nsearches with sub-degree angular resolution. No indications of correlations at\ndiscovery level are obtained for any of the searches performed. The smallest of\nthe p-values comes from the search for correlation between UHECRs with IceCube\nhigh-energy cascades, a result that should continue to be monitored.\n","Comment: Replaced with published version.

Additionally,\nthe proposed measure adequately handles the occurrence of overlapping in both\nthe object and feature spaces.

Basically,\nNeural Enquirer finds the distributed representation of a query and then\nexecutes it on knowledge-base tables to obtain the answer as one of the values\nin the tables. Unlike similar efforts in end-to-end training of semantic\nparsers, Neural Enquirer is fully \"neuralized\": it not only gives\ndistributional representation of the query and the knowledge-base, but also\nrealizes the execution of compositional queries as a series of differentiable\noperations, with intermediate results (consisting of annotations of the tables\nat different levels) saved on multiple layers of memory. Neural Enquirer can be\ntrained with gradient descent, with which not only the parameters of the\ncontrolling components and semantic parsing component, but also the embeddings\nof the tables and query words can be learned from scratch. The training can be\ndone in an end-to-end fashion, but it can take stronger guidance, e.g., the\nstep-by-step supervision for complicated queries, and benefit from it. Neural\nEnquirer is one step towards building neural network systems which seek to\nunderstand language by executing it on real-world. Our experiments show that\nNeural Enquirer can learn to execute fairly complicated NL queries on tables\nwith rich structures.\n"]}]

The footpoints of the loop magnetic field are advected by\nrandom motions. As a consequence the magnetic field in the loop is energized\nand develops turbulent nonlinear dynamics characterized by the continuous\nformation and dissipation of field-aligned current sheets: energy is deposited\nat small scales where heating occurs. Dissipation is non-uniformly distributed\nso that only a fraction of the coronal mass and volume gets heated at any time.\nTemperature and density are highly structured at scales which, in the solar\ncorona, remain observationally unresolved: the plasma of our simulated loop is\nmulti-thermal, where highly dynamical hotter and cooler plasma strands are\nscattered throughout the loop at sub-observational scales. Numerical\nsimulations of coronal loops of 50000 km length and axial magnetic field\nintensities ranging from 0.01 to 0.04 Tesla are presented.

This has advantages over cross-correlation analysis in that it\ncan correctly handle common-cause confounds and provides a generative model of\ncall patterns with explicit parameters for the influences between individuals.\nIt also has advantages over standard Markovian analysis in that it incorporates\ndetailed temporal interactions which affect timing as well as sequencing of\ncalls. Further, a fitted model can be used to generate novel synthetic call\nsequences. We apply the method to calls recorded from groups of domesticated\nzebra finch (Taenopyggia guttata) individuals. We find that the communication\nnetwork in these groups has stable structure that persists from one day to the\nnext, and that \"kernels\" reflecting the temporal range of influence have a\ncharacteristic structure for a calling individual's effect on itself, its\npartner, and on others in the group. We further find characteristic patterns of\ninfluences by call type as well as by individual.\n"]}]

For a\nsufficiently strong coupling between a quantum emitter and a cavity, large\nquality factors ($Q$) along with small modal volume ($V_{eff}$) are essential.\nHere we show that by applying a 5nm Al coating to the sidewalls of a\nsubmicrometer-sized Fabry-P\\'{e}rot microcavity, the cavity $Q$ can be\ntemperature-tuned from few hundreds at room temperatures to 2$\\times$10$^5$\nbelow 30~K.

Basker uses a two-dimensional\nhierarchical structure of sparse matrices that maps to the hierarchy in the\nmemory architectures and to the hierarchy in parallelism. We present\nperformance evaluations of Basker on the Intel SandyBridge and Xeon Phi\nplatforms using circuit and power grid matrices taken from the University of\nFlorida sparse matrix collection and from Xyce circuit simulations. Basker\nachieves a geometric mean speedup of 5.91x on CPU (16 cores) and 7.4x on Xeon\nPhi (32 cores) relative to KLU. Basker outperforms Intel MKL Pardiso (PMKL) by\nas much as 53x on CPU (16 cores) and 13.3x on Xeon Phi (32 cores) for low\nfill-in circuit matrices. Furthermore, Basker provides 5.4x speedup on a\nchallenging matrix sequence taken from an actual Xyce simulation.\n"]}]
