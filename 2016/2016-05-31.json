The first\nspallation reactions induced with an accelerator took place in 1947 at the\nBerkeley cyclotron (University of California) with 200 MeV deuterons and 400\nMeV alpha beams. They highlighted the multiple emission of neutrons and charged\nparticles and the production of a large number of residual nuclei far different\nfrom the target nuclei. The same year R. Serber describes the reaction in two\nsteps: a first and fast one with high-energy particle emission leading to an\nexcited remnant nucleus, and a second one, much slower, the de-excitation of\nthe remnant. In 2010 IAEA organized a worskhop to present the results of the\nmost widely used spallation codes within a benchmark of spallation models. If\none of the goals was to understand the deficiencies, if any, in each code, one\nremarkable outcome points out the overall high-quality level of some models and\nso the great improvements achieved since Serber. Particle transport codes can\nthen rely on such spallation models to treat the reactions between a light\nparticle and an atomic nucleus with energies spanning from few tens of MeV up\nto some GeV. An overview of the spallation reactions modeling is presented in\norder to point out the incomparable contribution of models based on basic\nphysics to numerous applications where such reactions occur.

When demands are real-valued functions of prices, the oracles can\nonly return values of bounded precision based on real utility functions. Due to\nthis more realistic assumption, precision and representation of prices and\ndemands become a major technical challenge, and we develop new tools and\ninsights that may be of independent interest. Furthermore, our approach also\ngives the first polynomial-time algorithm to compute an exact equilibrium for\nmarkets with spending constraint utilities, a piecewise linear concave\ngeneralization of linear utilities.

Quantum systems scan all possible available states and switch randomly\nand very rapidly among them. The longer they remain in a given state, the\nlarger the probability of the system to be found in that state during a\nmeasurement. A crucial property that we postulate is quantum inertia, that\nincreases whenever a constituent is added, or the system is perturbed with all\nkinds of interactions. Once the quantum inertia $I_q$ reaches a critical value\n$I_{cr}$ for an observable, the switching among the different eigenvalues of\nthat observable stops and the corresponding superposition comes to an end.\nConsequently, increasing the mass, temperature, gravitational force, etc. of a\nquantum system increases its quantum inertia until the superposition of states\ndisappears for all the observables and the system transmutes into a classical\none. The process could be reversible: decreasing the size, temperature,\ngravitational force, etc. of a classical system one could revert the situation.\nEntanglement can only occur between quantum systems, not between a quantum\nsystem and a classical one, because an exact synchronization between the\nswitchings of the systems involved must be established in the first place and\nclassical systems do not have any switchings to start with. Future experiments\nmight determine the critical inertia $I_{cr}$ corresponding to different\nobservables.

Recently, cooling down with a large\nspatial temperature gradient attracts much attention for successful reductions\nof trapped vortices. The purpose of the present paper is to propose a model to\nexplain the observed efficient flux expulsions and the role of spatial\ntemperature gradient during the cool-down of cavity. In the vicinity of a\nregion with a temperature close to the critical temperature Tc,the critical\nfields are strongly suppressed and can be smaller than the ambient magnetic\nfield. A region with a lower critical field smaller than the ambient field is\nin the vortex state. As a material is cooled down, a region with a temperature\nclose Tc associating the vortex state domain sweeps and passes through the\nmaterial. In this process, vortices contained in the vortex state domain are\ntrapped by pinning centers that randomly distribute in the material. A number\nof trapped vortices can be naively estimated by using the analogy with the\nbeam-target collision event. Based on this result, the residual resistance is\nevaluated. We find that a number of trapped vortices and the residual\nresistance are proportional to the strength of the ambient magnetic field and\nthe inverse of the temperature gradient. The obtained residual resistance\nagrees well with experimental results. A material property dependence of a\nnumber of trapped vortices is also discussed.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 5 figures"]}]

This article is\nconcerned with superradiance (SR), a profound quantum optical process predicted\nby Dicke in 1954. The basic concept of SR applies to a general $N$-body system\nwhere constituent oscillating dipoles couple together through interaction with\na common light field and accelerate the radiative decay of the system. In the\nmost fascinating manifestation of SR, known as superfluorescence (SF), an\nincoherently prepared system of $N$ inverted atoms spontaneously develops\nmacroscopic coherence from vacuum fluctuations and produces a delayed pulse of\ncoherent light whose peak intensity $\\propto N^2$. Such SF pulses have been\nobserved in atomic and molecular gases, and their intriguing quantum nature has\nbeen unambiguously demonstrated.

Therefore, the new action unifies both\ngeneral relativity and anti-self-dual gravity.\n","Comment: 6 pages, accepted for publication in Physical Review D"]}]

Although this idea was\ncrucial to enhance the efficiency of many devices, it was never considered in\nthe context of systems operating in a non-perturbative regime.

A general, recent approach to optimise such \"nested\"\nfunctions is the method of auxiliary coordinates (MAC). MAC introduces an\nauxiliary coordinate for each data point in order to decouple the nested model\ninto independent submodels. This decomposes the optimisation into steps that\nalternate between training single layers and updating the coordinates. It has\nthe advantage that it reuses existing single-layer algorithms, introduces\nparallelism, and does not need to use chain-rule gradients, so it works with\nnondifferentiable layers.

The\nSENC problem can be decomposed into three sub problems: detecting emerging new\nclasses, classifying for known classes, and updating models to enable\nclassification of instances of the new class and detection of more emerging new\nclasses. The proposed method employs completely random trees which have been\nshown to work well in unsupervised learning and supervised learning\nindependently in the literature. This is the first time, as far as we know,\nthat completely random trees are used as a single common core to solve all\nthree sub problems: unsupervised learning, supervised learning and model update\nin data streams. We show that the proposed unsupervised-learning-focused method\noften achieves significantly better outcomes than existing\nclassification-focused methods.\n"]}]

The Hough transform is a pattern\nrecognition technique, which is mainly used to detect straight lines in digital\nimages and which has been recently extended to the automatic recognition of\nalgebraic plane curves. Although defined in very different ways, in numerical\napplications both transforms ultimately take an image as an input and provide,\nas an output, a function defined on a parameter space. The parameters in this\nspace describe a family of curves, which represent either the integration\ndomains considered in the (generalized) Radon transform, or the curves to be\ndetected by means of the Hough transform. In both cases, the 2D plot of the\nintensity values of the output function is the so-called (Radon or Hough)\nsinogram. While the Hough sinogram is produced by an algorithm whose\nimplementation requires that the parameter space be discretized in cells, the\nRadon sinogram is mathematically defined on a continuous parameter space, which\nin turn may need to be discretized just for physical or numerical reasons. In\nthis paper, by considering a more general and n-dimensional setting, we prove\nthat, whether the input image is described as a set of points (possibly with\ndifferent intensity values) or as a piecewise constant function, its (rescaled)\nHough sinogram converges to the corresponding Radon sinogram as the\ndiscretization step in the parameter space tends to zero.

Although much has been done to prevent failures, network nodes\nand links are bound to fail eventually. Failure recovery processes are\ntherefore needed. Failure recovery is mainly influenced by (1) detection of the\nfailure, and (2) circumvention of the detected failure. However, especially in\nSDNs where controllers recompute network state reactively, this leads to high\ndelays. Hence, next to primary rules, backup rules should be installed in the\nswitches to quickly detour traffic once a failure occurs. In this work, we\npropose algorithms for computing an all-to-all primary and backup network\nforwarding configuration that is capable of circumventing link and node\nfailures. Omitting the high delay invoked by controller recomputation through\npreconfiguration, our proposal's recovery delay is close to the detection time\nwhich is significantly below the 50 ms rule of thumb.
