Insights into the structure of the optimal stopping rule are\npresented. In the limiting case of rare disruptions, we show that the structure\nof the optimal test reduces to thresholding the a posteriori probability of the\nhypothesis that no change has happened. We establish the asymptotic optimality\n(in the vanishing false alarm probability regime) of this threshold test under\na certain condition on the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence between the post-\nand the pre-change densities. In the special case of near-instantaneous change\npropagation across the sensors, this condition reduces to the mild condition\nthat the K-L divergence be positive. Numerical studies show that this low\ncomplexity threshold test results in a substantial improvement in performance\nover naive tests such as a single-sensor test or a test that wrongly assumes\nthat the change propagates instantaneously.\n","Comment: 40 pages, 5 figures, Submitted to IEEE Trans.

One implicit\nassumption commonly shared in this context is that during the algorithm\nruntime, the channel states remain effectively unchanged.

The SASI\nleaves behind a large lateral velocity gradient in the post shock layer which\naffects the evolution for minutes and hours later. This results in a prolate\ndeformation of the ejecta and a fast advection of Ni-rich material from\nmoderate latitudes to the polar regions. This effect might actually be\nresponsible for the global asymmetry of the nickel lines in SN 1987A. The\nsimulations demonstrate that significant radial and lateral motions in the\npost-shock region, produced by convective overturn and the SASI during the\nearly explosion phase, contribute to the evolution for minutes and hours after\nshock revival. They lead to both later clump formation, and a significant\nprolate deformation of the ejecta which are observed even as late as one week\nafter the explosion. As pointed out recently by Kjaer et al., such an ejecta\nmorphology is in good agreement with the observational data of SN 1987A.\nSystematic future studies are needed to investigate how the SASI-induced\nlate-time lateral expansion depends on the dominant mode of the SASI, and to\nwhich extent it is affected by the dimensionality of the simulations.

We consider two\nprocedures at the fusion center to process the measurements. The Bayesian\nsetting is assumed; i.e., the fusion center has a prior distribution on the\nchange time. In the first procedure, the decision algorithm at the fusion\ncenter is \\emph{network-oblivious} and makes a decision only when a complete\nvector of measurements taken at a sampling instant is available. In the second\nprocedure, the decision algorithm at the fusion center is \\emph{network-aware}\nand processes measurements as they arrive, but in a time causal order. In this\ncase, the decision statistic depends on the network delays as well, whereas in\nthe network-oblivious case, the decision statistic does not depend on the\nnetwork delays. This yields a Bayesian change detection problem with a tradeoff\nbetween the random network delay and the decision delay; a higher sampling rate\nreduces the decision delay but increases the random access delay.

The solution thus obtained is further shown to be a\nstationary point for the SDR of the original outage constrained beamforming\ndesign problem. {Furthermore}, we propose a distributed SCA algorithm where\neach transmitter optimizes its own beamformer using local CDI and information\nobtained from limited message exchange with the other transmitters. Our\nsimulation results demonstrate that the proposed SCA algorithm and its\ndistributed counterpart indeed converge, and near-optimal performance can be\nachieved for all the considered system utilities.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 10 figures, accepted by IEEE Trans.

We propose\nnovel ARQ protocol designs that optimize these tradeoffs. We first derive the\ndiversity-multiplexing-delay tradeoff (DMDT) in the high SNR regime, where the\ndelay is caused only by retransmissions. This asymptotic DMDT shows that the\nperformance of an N node network is limited by the weakest three-node\nsub-network, and the performance of a three-node sub-network is determined by\nits weakest link, and, hence, the optimal ARQ protocol needs to equalize the\nperformance on each link by allocating ARQ window sizes optimally. This\nequalization is captured through a novel Variable Block-Length (VBL) ARQ\nprotocol that we propose, which achieves the optimal DMDT.\n  We then consider the DMDT in the finite SNR regime, where the delay is caused\nby both the ARQ retransmissions and queueing. We characterize the finite SNR\nDMDT of the fixed ARQ protocol, when an end-to-end delay constraint is imposed,\nby deriving the probability of message error using an approach that couples the\ninformation outage analysis with the queueing network analysis. The exponent of\nthe probability of deadline violation demonstrates that the system performance\nis again limited by the weakest three-node sub-network. The queueing delay\nchanges the consideration for optimal ARQ design: more retransmissions reduce\ndecoding error by lowering the information outage probability, but may also\nincrease message drop rate due to delay deadline violations. Hence, the optimal\nARQ should balance link performance while avoiding significant delay.\n","Comment: Submitted to IEEE Trans. Info. Theory"]}]

Under the conventional single-cell\nsetup, RBF is known to achieve the optimal sum-capacity scaling law as the\nnumber of users goes to infinity, thanks to the multiuser diversity enabled\ntransmission scheduling that virtually eliminates the intra-cell interference.\nIn this paper, we extend the study of RBF to a more practical multi-cell\ndownlink system with single-antenna receivers subject to the additional\ninter-cell interference (ICI). First, we consider the case of finite\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at each receiver. We derive a closed-form\nexpression of the achievable sum-rate with the multi-cell RBF, based upon which\nwe show an asymptotic sum-rate scaling law as the number of users goes to\ninfinity. Next, we consider the high-SNR regime and for tractable analysis\nassume that the number of users in each cell scales in a certain order with the\nper-cell SNR. Under this setup, we characterize the achievable degrees of\nfreedom (DoF) for the single-cell case with RBF. Then we extend the analysis to\nthe multi-cell RBF case by characterizing the DoF region. It is shown that the\nDoF region characterization provides useful guideline on how to design a\ncooperative multi-cell RBF system to achieve optimal throughput tradeoffs among\ndifferent cells. Furthermore, our results reveal that the multi-cell RBF scheme\nachieves the \"interference-free DoF\" region upper bound for the multi-cell\nsystem, provided that the per-cell number of users has a sufficiently large\nscaling order with the SNR. Our result thus confirms the optimality of\nmulti-cell RBF in this regime even without the complete CSI at the transmitter,\nas compared to other full-CSI requiring transmission schemes such as\ninterference alignment.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 6 figures, to appear in IEEE Transactions of Signal\n  Processing.

In sharp\ncontrast, classic codes, like Reed- Solomon (RS), used in current storage\nsystems, are deemed to suffer from naive repair, i.e. downloading the entire\nstored message to repair one failed node.

This is motivated by apparently two contrasting results even\nfor a simple 3 node network, with a single half-duplex relay. When all channels\nare assumed to be i.i.d. fading, a static schedule where the relay listens half\nthe time and transmits half the time combined with quantize-map-forward (QMF)\nrelaying is known to achieve the full-duplex performance. However, when there\nis no direct link between source and destination, a dynamic-decode-forward\n(DDF) strategy is needed to achieve the optimal tradeoff. In this case, a\nstatic schedule is strictly suboptimal and the optimal tradeoff is\nsignificantly worse than the full-duplex performance. In this paper we study\nthe general case when the direct link is neither as strong as the other links\nnor fully non-existent, and identify regimes where dynamic schedules are\nnecessary and those where static schedules are enough. We identify 4\nqualitatively different regimes for the single relay channel where the tradeoff\nbetween diversity and multiplexing is significantly different. We show that in\nall these regimes one of the above two strategies is sufficient to achieve the\noptimal tradeoff by developing a new upper bound on the best achievable\ntradeoff under channel state information available only at the receivers. A\nnatural next question is whether these two strategies are sufficient to achieve\nthe DMT of more general half-duplex wireless networks. We propose a\ngeneralization of the two existing schemes through a dynamic QMF (DQMF)\nstrategy, where the relay listens for a fraction of time depending on received\nCSI but not long enough to be able to decode.

Specifically, we introduce a one-to-many bargaining game among the MNO\nand APOs, and analyze the bargaining solution (game equilibrium) systematically\nunder two different bargaining protocols: (i) sequential bargaining, where the\nMNO bargains with APOs sequentially, with one APO at a time, in a given order,\nand (ii) concurrent bargaining, where the MNO bargains with all APOs\nconcurrently. We quantify the benefits for APOs when bargaining sequentially\nand earlier with the MNO, and the losses for APOs when bargaining concurrently\nwith the MNO. We further study the group bargaining scenario where multiple\nAPOs form a group bargaining with the MNO jointly, and quantify the benefits\nfor APOs when forming such a group. Interesting, our analysis indicates that\ngrouping of APOs not only benefits the APOs in the group, but may also benefit\nsome APOs not in the group. Our results shed light on the economic aspects and\nthe possible outcomes of the MNO/APOs interactions, and can be used as a\nroadmap for designing policies for this promising data offloading solution.\n","Comment: This manuscript is the complete technical report for the journal\n  version published in IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications (JSAC)\n  Special Issue in 5G Communication Systems, 2014"]}]

To answer these\nquestions, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of q-PAM PNC.

Existing\nresearch can be broadly divided into two categories according to their\nneighbor-discovery techniques---the quorum based protocols and the co-primality\nbased protocols.In this paper, we propose two neighbor discovery protocols,\ncalled Hedis and Todis, that optimize the duty cycle granularity of quorum and\nco-primality based protocols respectively, by enabling the finest-grained\ncontrol of heterogeneous duty cycles. We compare the two optimal protocols via\nanalytical and simulation results, which show that although the optimal\nco-primality based protocol (Todis) is simpler in its design, the optimal\nquorum based protocol (Hedis) has a better performance since it has a lower\nrelative error rate and smaller discovery delay, while still allowing the\nsensor nodes to wake up at a more infrequent rate.\n","Comment: Accepted by IEEE INFOCOM 2015"]}]

The accuracy of the approximation is controlled via a scaling\nparameter $\\delta$, where a smaller $\\delta$ corresponds to a more accurate\nfitting. The consequent optimization problem for any finite $\\delta$ is\nnonconvex. Therefore, in order to decrease the risk of ending up in local\nminima, a series of optimizations is performed, starting with optimizing a\nrough approximation (a large $\\delta$) and followed by successively optimizing\nfiner approximations of the rank with smaller $\\delta$'s.

In particular, we use the\nmachinery of so-called Wasserstein matrices to show that the Azuma-Hoeffding\nconcentration inequality for martingales with almost surely bounded\ndifferences, when applied in a sufficiently abstract setting, is powerful\nenough to recover and sharpen several known concentration results for\nnonproduct measures. Wasserstein matrices provide a natural formalism for\ncapturing the interplay between the metric and the probabilistic structures,\nwhich is fundamental to the concentration phenomenon.\n","Comment: Final version to appear in IMA Volume \"Concentration, Convexity, and\n  Discrete Structures\" (Springer)"]}]

This paper introduces the FAVourite rOUte\nRecommendation (FAVOUR) approach to provide personalized, situation-aware route\nproposals based on three steps: first, at the initialization stage, the user\nprovides limited information (home location, work place, mobility options,\nsociodemographics) used to select one out of a small number of initial\nprofiles. Second, based on this information, a stated preference survey is\ndesigned in order to sharpen the profile. In this step a mass preference prior\nis used to encode the prior knowledge on preferences from the class identified\nin step one. And third, subsequently the profile is continuously updated during\nusage of the routing services. The last two steps use Bayesian learning\ntechniques in order to incorporate information from all contributing\nindividuals. The FAVOUR approach is presented in detail and tested on a small\nnumber of survey participants. The experimental results on this real-world\ndataset show that FAVOUR generates better-quality recommendations w.r.t.\nalternative learning algorithms from the literature. In particular the\ndefinition of the mass preference prior for initialization of step two is shown\nto provide better predictions than a number of alternatives from the\nliterature.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 6 figures, 1 table.

We conjecture that this tradeoff characterizes how a\nuser deals with uncertainty and its two aspects, risk and ambiguity in economic\ntheory. Risk is related to the perceived quality of the actually visited patch\nof information, and can be reduced by exploiting and understanding the patch to\na better extent. Ambiguity, on the other hand, is the opportunity cost of\nhaving higher quality patches elsewhere in the search space. The aforementioned\ntradeoff depends on many attributes, including traits of the user: at the two\nextreme ends of the spectrum, analytic and wholistic searchers employ entirely\ndifferent strategies. The former type focuses on exploitation first,\ninterspersed with bouts of exploration, whereas the latter type prefers to\nexplore the search space first and consume later. Based on an eye-tracking\nstudy of experts' interactions with novel search interfaces in the biomedical\ndomain, we demonstrate that perceived risk shifts the balance between\nexploration and exploitation in either type of users, tilting it against vs. in\nfavour of ambiguity minimization. Since the pattern of behaviour in information\nforaging is quintessentially sequential, risk and ambiguity minimization cannot\nhappen simultaneously, leading to a fundamental limit on how good such a\ntradeoff can be.

GUICop comprises the following: 1) a GUI Specification\nLanguage; 2) a Driver; 3) Instrumented GUI Libraries; 4) a Solver; and 5) a\nCode Weaver. The user defines the specifications of the subject GUI program\nusing the GUI Specification Language. The Driver traverses the GUI structure of\nthe program and generates events that drive its execution. The Instrumented GUI\nLibraries capture the GUI execution trace, i.e., information about the\npositions and visibility of the GUI elements. And the Solver, enabled by code\ninjected by the Code Weaver, checks whether the traces satisfy the\nspecifications. GUICop was successfully evaluated using four open source GUI\napplications that included eight defects, namely, Jajuk, Gason, JEdit, and\nTerpPaint.\n"]}]

When robots generate\ntask plans without such considerations, they may often demonstrate what we\nrefer to as inexplicable behavior from the point of view of humans who may be\nobserving it. This problem arises due to the human observer's partial or\ninaccurate understanding of the robot's deliberative process and/or the model\n(i.e. capabilities of the robot) that informs it. This may have serious\nimplications on the human-robot work-space, from increased cognitive load and\nreduced trust in the robot from the human, to more serious concerns of safety\nin human-robot interactions. In this paper, we propose to address this issue by\nlearning a distance function that can accurately model the notion of\nexplicability, and develop an anytime search algorithm that can use this\nmeasure in its search process to come up with progressively explicable plans.\nAs the first step, robot plans are evaluated by human subjects based on how\nexplicable they perceive the plan to be, and a scoring function called\nexplicability distance based on the different plan distance measures is\nlearned. We then use this explicability distance as a heuristic to guide our\nsearch in order to generate explicable robot plans, by minimizing the plan\ndistances between the robot's plan and the human's expected plans.

If these elementary emitters\nare synchronized, the resulting emission is coherent. Moreover, the faster the\nemitters approach an observer, the more intense and directional their apparent\nemission is, with associated frequency increase. Multi-stream flows\nubiquitously occur in media (such as with shock waves and jets in astrophysical\nand laboratory plasmas) and produce fast moving density singularities, where\nhigh concentration and synchronism can bring constructive interference.\nHowever, a singularity emitting such characteristic coherent radiation has not\nbeen demonstrated yet. We show this general phenomenon in laser-driven\nrelativistic plasma, which is an ideal medium for realizing these effects in\nthe laboratory under controllable conditions. Our experiments and simulations\nreveal bright coherent soft x-ray radiation from nanoscale electron density\nsingularities in multi-stream plasma. They constitute a new compact x-ray\nsource of ultrashort duration, demanded in numerous applications. In general,\nsingularities can be bright sources of other types of traveling waves. Thus our\nfindings open new opportunities in different fields of science. For example,\ngravitational wave generation, as proposed in ultrahigh-energy accelerators,\ncan be significantly enhanced by intentionally induced density singularities in\nthe particle bunches. Further, we anticipate that multi-stream flows in cosmic\nmedia can produce intense bursts of coherent electromagnetic and/or\ngravitational waves, especially at longer wavelengths which facilitate\nconstructive interference. We can then expect to observe more directional short\nwavelength bursts from cosmic emitters approaching at relativistic speeds.\nThus, we present a new framework for interpreting a broad range of experimental\nresults.\n"]}]

The twin boundaries varying from one to five providing twin\nboundary spacing in the range 8.5 - 2.8 nm were introduced perpendicular to the\nloading direction. The simulation results indicated that the twin boundaries in\nBCC Fe play a contrasting role during deformation under tensile and compressive\nloadings. During tensile deformation, a large reduction in yield stress was\nobserved in twinned nanopillars compared to perfect nanopillar. However, the\nyield stress exhibited only marginal variation with respect to twin boundary\nspacing. On the contrary, a decrease in yield stress with increase in twin\nboundary spacing was obtained during compressive deformation. This contrasting\nbehaviour originates from difference in operating mechanisms during yielding\nand subsequent plastic deformation. It has been observed that the deformation\nunder tensile loading was dominated mainly by twin growth mechanism, due to\nwhich the twin boundaries offers a negligible resistance to slip of twinning\npartials. This is reflected in the negligible variation of yield stress as a\nfunction of twin boundary spacing. On the other hand, the deformation was\ndominated by nucleation and slip of full dislocations under compressive\nloading. The twin boundaries offer a strong repulsive force on full\ndislocations resulting in the yield stress dependence on twin boundary spacing.\nFurther, it has been observed that the curved twin boundary can acts as a\nsource for full dislocation. The occurrence of twin-twin interaction during\ntensile deformation and dislocation-twin interaction during compressive\ndeformation were presented and discussed.\n","Comment: 21 Pages, 18 Figures, Journal article"]}]

Therefore, it is of significance to investigate the\ninterfacial thermal dissipation properties and manipulate the properties by\ninterfacial engineering on demand. In this work, the interfacial thermal\nconductance between few-layer black phosphorus and graphene is studied\nextensively using molecular dynamics simulations. Two critical parameters, the\ncritical power Pcr to maintain thermal stability and the maximum heat power\ndensity Pmax with which the system can be loaded, are identified. Our results\nshow that interfacial thermal conductance can be effectively tuned in a wide\nrange with external strains and interracial defects. The compressive strain can\nenhance the interfacial thermal conductance by one order of magnitude, while\ninterface defects give a two-fold increase. These findings could provide\nguidelines in heat dissipation and interfacial engineering for thermal\nconductance manipulation of black phosphorus-graphene heterostructure-based\ndevices.\n","Comment: 33 pages, 22 figures"]}]

We compared GENESIM to\nprevalent decision tree induction and ensemble techniques using twelve publicly\navailable data sets. The results show that GENESIM achieves a better predictive\nperformance on most of these data sets than decision tree induction techniques\nand a predictive performance in the same order of magnitude as the ensemble\ntechniques. Moreover, the resulting model of GENESIM has a very low complexity,\nmaking it very interpretable, in contrast to ensemble techniques.\n","Comment: Presented at NIPS 2016 Workshop on Interpretable Machine Learning in\n  Complex Systems"]}]

In this study, we focus on\nimproving the co-clustering performance via manifold ensemble learning, which\nis able to maximally approximate the intrinsic manifolds of both the sample and\nfeature spaces. To achieve this, we develop a novel co-clustering algorithm\ncalled Relational Multi-manifold Co-clustering (RMC) based on symmetric\nnonnegative matrix tri-factorization, which decomposes the relational data\nmatrix into three submatrices. This method considers the intertype relationship\nrevealed by the relational data matrix, and also the intra-type information\nreflected by the affinity matrices encoded on the sample and feature data\ndistributions. Specifically, we assume the intrinsic manifold of the sample or\nfeature space lies in a convex hull of some pre-defined candidate manifolds. We\nwant to learn a convex combination of them to maximally approach the desired\nintrinsic manifold. To optimize the objective function, the multiplicative\nrules are utilized to update the submatrices alternatively. Besides, both the\nentropic mirror descent algorithm and the coordinate descent algorithm are\nexploited to learn the manifold coefficient vector. Extensive experiments on\ndocuments, images and gene expression data sets have demonstrated the\nsuperiority of the proposed algorithm compared to other well-established\nmethods.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 4 figures, published in IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics\n  (TCYB)"]}]

This model features four real parameters\nthat cannot be fully fixed by the current data: two CP-violating phases, delta\nand sigma, as well as one complex parameter, z, that is experimentally\ninaccessible at low energies.

Unfortunately,\nmost shared mesh protection schemes cannot guarantee that failed traffic will\nbe restored within the 50 ms timeframe that SONET standards specify. A notable\nexception is the p-cycle scheme of Grover and Stamatelakis. We argue, however,\nthat p-cycles have certain limitations, e.g., there is no easy way to adapt\np-cycles to a path-based protection scheme, and p-cycles seem more suited to\nstatic traffic than to dynamic traffic. In this paper we show that the key to\nfast restoration times is not a ring-like topology per se, but rather the\nability to pre-cross-connect protection paths. This leads to the concept of a\npre-cross-connected trail or PXT, which is a structure that is more flexible\nthan rings and that adapts readily to both path-based and link-based schemes\nand to both static and dynamic traffic. The PXT protection scheme achieves fast\nrestoration speeds, and our simulations, which have been carefully chosen using\nideas from experimental design theory, show that the bandwidth efficiency of\nthe PXT protection scheme is comparable to that of conventional shared mesh\nprotection schemes.\n","Comment: Article has appeared in IEEE/ACM Trans.

Our proof is based on a new mathematical framework for QTMs,\nincluding a thorough analysis of their halting behaviour.
