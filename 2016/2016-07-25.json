At the DFT level, the spin density distribution is directly related\nto the amount of Hartree-Fock exchange introduced in hybrid functionals. At the\nQMC level, Fixed-node Diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) results for SD are\nstrongly dependent on the nodal structure of the trial wavefunction employed\n(here, Hartree-Fock or Kohn-Sham with a particular amount of HF exchange) : in\nthe case of this open-shell system, the 3N -dimensional nodes are mainly\ndetermined by the 3-dimensional nodes of the singly occupied molecular orbital.\nRegarding wavefunction approaches, HF and CASSCF lead to strongly localized\nspin density on the copper atom, in sharp contrast with DFT. To get a more\nreliable description and shed some light on the connections between the various\ntheoretical descriptions, Full CI-type (FCI) calculations are performed. To\nmake them feasible for this case a perturbatively selected CI approach\ngenerating multi-determinantal expansions of reasonable size and a small\ntractable basis set are employed. Although semi-quantitative, these near-FCI\ncalculations allow to clarify how the spin density distribution evolves upon\ninclusion of dynamic correlation effects. A plausible scenario about the nature\nof the SD is proposed.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 12 Figures"]}]

These effects can be modeled in simplest\nterms with a \"thresholded power law\" distribution function (also called\ngeneralized Pareto [type II] or Lomax distribution), $N(x) dx \\propto\n(x+x_0)^{-a} dx$, where $x_0 > 0$ is positive for a threshold effect, while\n$x_0 < 0$ is negative for background contamination.

However, without precisely knowing the stellar and planetary\nsignals in real observations, it is extremely difficult to test the efficiency\nof these methods.\n  The goal of the RV fitting challenge is to generate simulated RV data\nincluding stellar and planetary signals and to perform a blind test within the\ncommunity to test the efficiency of the different methods proposed to recover\nplanetary signals despite stellar signals.\n  In this first paper, we describe the simulation used to model the\nmeasurements of the RV fitting challenge. Each simulated planetary system\nincludes the signals from instrumental noise, stellar oscillations,\ngranulation, supergranulation, stellar activity, and observed and simulated\nplanetary systems. In addition to RV variations, this simulation also models\nthe effects of instrumental noise and stellar signals on activity observables\nobtained by HARPS-type high-resolution spectrographs, that is, the calcium\nactivity index log(R'hk) and the bisector span and full width at half maximum\nof the cross-correlation function.\n  We publish the 15 systems used for the RV fitting challenge including the\ndetails about the planetary systems that were injected into each of them (data\navailable at CDS and here: https://rv-challenge.wikispaces.com.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 16 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy and\n  Astrophysics"]}]

Along the way, we construct a section of the\nMaass lowering operator for moderate growth modular forms valued in the Weil\nrepresentation using a regularized theta lift, which may be of independent\ninterest. We also consider arithmetic-geometric applications to integral models\nof U(n, 1) Shimura varieties.\n  Each family of Green functions gives rise to a formal arithmetic theta\nfunction, valued in an arithmetic Chow group, that is conjectured to be\nmodular; our main result is the modularity of the difference of the two\narithmetic theta functions. Finally, we relate the arithmetic heights of the\nspecial cycles to special derivatives of Eisenstein series, as predicted by\nKudla's conjecture, and describe a refinement of a theorem of\nBruinier-Howard-Yang on arithmetic intersections against CM points.\n","Comment: 52 pages"]}]
