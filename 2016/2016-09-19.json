Many eukaryotic cells were believed\nto require an underlying substratum to migrate (crawl) by using membrane\ndeformation (like blebbing or generation of lamellipodia) but there is now\nincreasing evidence that a large variety of cells (including those of the\nimmune system) can migrate without the assistance of focal adhesion, allowing\nthem to swim as efficiently as they can crawl. This paper details the analysis\nof amoeboid swimming in a confined fluid by modeling the swimmer as an\ninextensible membrane deploying local active forces. The swimmer displays a\nrich behavior: it may settle into a straight trajectory in the channel or\nnavigate from one wall to the other depending on its confinement. The nature of\nthe swimmer is also found to be affected by confinement: the swimmer can\nbehave, on the average over one swimming cycle, as a pusher at low confinement,\nand becomes a puller at higher confinement. The swimmer's nature is thus not an\nintrinsic property. The scaling of the swimmer velocity V with the force\namplitude A is analyzed in detail showing that at small enough A, $V\\sim\nA^2/\\eta^2$, whereas at large enough A, V is independent of the force and is\ndetermined solely by the stroke frequency and swimmer size. This finding\nstarkly contrasts with currently known results found from swimming models where\nmotion is based on flagellar or ciliary activity, where $V\\sim A/\\eta$. To\nconclude, two definitions of efficiency as put forward in the literature are\nanalyzed with distinct outcomes.

Recent study has suggested that\nheavily Bi-alloyed GaAs can decrease the non-radiative Auger recombination and\ntherefore alleviate the efficiency droop. Using density functional theory, we\nstudied a newly fabricated quaternary alloy, GaAs1-x-yPyBix, which can host\nsignificant amounts of Bi, through calculations of its band gap, spin-orbit\nsplitting, and band offsets with GaAs. We found that the band gap changes of\nGaAs1-x-yPyBix relative to GaAs are determined mainly by the local structural\nchanges around P and Bi atoms rather than their electronic structure\ndifferences. To obtain alloy with lower Auger recombination than GaAs bulk, we\nidentified the necessary constraints on the compositions of P and Bi.

In this\narticle, the role of the barrier thickness (2.0, 2.4 and 2.8 mm) and of the\nkind of dielectric material (alumina, mullite, pyrex, quartz) is investigated\non the filamentary behavior in the plasma and on the CO2 conversion in a\ntubular flowing DBD, by means of mass spectrometry measurements correlated with\nelectrical characterization and IR imaging. Increasing the barrier thickness\ndecreases the capacitance, while preserving the electrical charge. As a result,\nthe voltage over the dielectric increases and a larger number of\nmicrodischarges is generated, which enhances the CO2 conversion. Furthermore,\nchanging the dielectric material of the barrier, while keeping the same\ngeometry and dimensions, also affects the CO2 conversion. The highest CO2\nconversion and energy efficiency are obtained for quartz and alumina, thus not\nfollowing the trend of the relative permittivity. From the electrical\ncharacterization, we clearly demonstrate that the most important parameters are\nthe somewhat higher effective plasma voltage (yielding a somewhat higher\nelectric field and electron energy in the plasma) for quartz, as well as the\nhigher plasma current (and thus larger electron density) and the larger number\nof microdischarge filaments (mainly for alumina, but also for quartz). The\nlatter could be correlated to the higher surface roughness for alumina and to\nthe higher voltage over the dielectric for quartz.\n"]}]

Analytic approximations to the closure\nand calibrated resolutions are demonstrated to effectively predict the full\nforms under realistic conditions. Finally, extensions of numerical inversion\nare presented which can reduce the inherent biases.
