From the\ntheoretical point of view, these oscillations may be modeled by the process of\naccretion disk instability, driven by the dominant radiation pressure and\nenhanced heating of the plasma. Although the mean accretion rate in this source\nis probably below the Eddington limit, the oscillations will still have large\namplitudes. As the observations show, the source can exhibit strong wind\noutflow during the soft state. This wind may help to partially or even\ncompletely stabilize the heartbeat. Using our hydrodynamical code GLADIS, we\nmodeled the evolution of an accretion disk responsible for X-ray emission of\nthe source. We accounted for a variable wind outflow from the disk surface. We\nexamined the data archive from the Chandra and XMM-Newton satellites to find\nthe observed limitations on the wind physical properties, such as its velocity\nand ionization state.

In this work, we present a novel\nunified video co-segmentation framework inspired by the recent Structured\nSparse Subspace Clustering ($\\mathrm{S^{3}C}$) based on the {\\em\nself-expressiveness} model. Our method yields more consistent segmentation\nresults. In order to improve the detectability of motion features with missing\ntrajectories due to occlusion or tracked points moving out of frames, we add an\nextra-dimensional signature to the motion trajectories. Moreover, we\nreformulate the $\\mathrm{S^{3}C}$ algorithm by adding the affine subspace\nconstraint in order to make it more suitable to segment rigid motions lying in\naffine subspaces of dimension at most $3$. Our experiments on MOViCS dataset\nshow that our framework achieves the highest overall performance among baseline\nalgorithms and demonstrate its robustness to heavy noise.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables, extend ICIP 2016"]}]

Thermal management of flexible electronics creates a demand for\nflexible materials with highly anisotropic thermal conductivity, which work as\nheat spreaders to remove excess heat in the in-plane direction and as heat\nshields to protect human skin or device components under them from heating.\nThis study proposes a self-assembled silver nanowire network with high thermal\nand electrical anisotropy with the potential to solve these challenges. The\nin-plane thermal conductivity of the network along the axial direction of\nsilver nanowires is measured as 37 W/m-K while the cross-plane thermal\nconductivity is only 0.36 W/m-K. The results of measurements of electrical and\nthermal conductivities suggest that abundant wire-wire contacts strongly impede\nthermal transport. The excellent alignment of nanowires results in the same\nanisotropy ratio of 3 for both thermal and electrical conduction in the two\nin-plane directions. The ratio remains unchanged as the temperature decrease to\n50 K, which indicates that wire-wire contacts lower the thermal and electrical\nconduction in the two directions to the same extent and their effect is\nindependent of temperature. In addition, phonon softening markedly reduces the\nDebye temperatures of the network, which are fitted from the electrical\nresistivity data. As a result of phonon thermal conduction, the Lorenz numbers\nof the film in the two directions, which are approximately the same, are larger\nthan the Sommerfeld value at room temperature and decrease as temperature\ndecreases because of small angle scattering and the reduced phonon\ncontribution.

There is\nconsiderable interest in searching for their faint and rapidly fading\nelectromagnetic (EM) counterparts, though GW position uncertainties are as\ncoarse as hundreds of square degrees. Because LIGO's sensitivity to binary\nneutron stars is limited to the local universe, the area on the sky that must\nbe searched could be reduced by weighting positions by mass, luminosity, or\nstar formation in nearby galaxies. Since GW observations provide information\nabout luminosity distance, combining the reconstructed volume with positions\nand redshifts of galaxies could reduce the area even more dramatically.

For the first time,\nmassive type IIA supergravity is reproduced geometrically as a solution of the\nsection constraint. This provides a unified description of all ten- and\neleven-dimensional maximal supergravities. The action of the E7 deformed theory\nis constructed, and reduces to those of exceptional field theory and gauged\nmaximal supergravity in respective limits. The relation of this new framework\nto other approaches for generating the Romans mass non-geometrically is\ndiscussed.\n","Comment: 39 pages. v2: typos corrected, references added. v3: typos corrected,\n  references added, published version"]}]

The traces were from the tunnel located\nbeneath the Temple of the Feathered Serpent (The Citadel, Teotihuacan, Mexico).\nThe MCW and FMC algorithms determined the periods of subsurface strata of the\ntunnel. GPR traces inside-and-outside the tunnel/chamber, outside the\ntunnel/chamber and inside the tunnel/chamber analyzed with the MCW and filtered\nFMC algorithms determined the periods of the tunnel and chamber fillings, clay\nand matrix (limestone-clay compound). The tunnel filling period obtained by MCW\nanalysis (14.37 ns) reflects the mixed limestone-clay compound of this stratum\nsince its value is close to that of the period of the matrix (15.22 ns);\nperiods of the chamber filling (11.40 ns) and the matrix (11.40 ns) were almost\nidentical. FMC analysis of the tunnel obtained a period (5.08 ns) close to that\nof the chamber (4.27 ns), suggesting the tunnel and chamber are filled with\nsimilar materials. The use of both algorithms allows a deeper analysis since\nthe similarities of the tunnel and chamber filling periods could not have been\ndetermined with the MCW algorithm alone.

Using this numerical formalism, we are able resolve\nthe leading effect from tides and GR across several orders of magnitude in both\nstellar radius and initial target binary separation. We find that the main\neffect from tides is the formation of two-body tidal captures that form during\nthe chaotic and resonant evolution of the triple system. The two stars\nundergoing the capture spiral in and merge. The inclusion of tides can thus\nlead to an increase on the stellar coalescence rate.

From our analytical and\nnumerical estimates we find that the rate of tidal inspirals relative to\ncollisions increases as the initial semi-major axis of the target binary\nincreases and the radius of the interacting tidal objects decreases.

Proliferation of these\nhand held devices has made them a common means to access and process digital\ninformation. Most web based applications are today available in a form that can\nconveniently be accessed over mobile devices. However, webservices\n(applications meant for consumption by other applications rather than humans)\nare not as commonly provided and consumed over mobile devices. Facilitating\nthis and in effect realizing a service-oriented system over mobile devices has\nthe potential to further enhance the potential of mobile devices. One of the\nmajor challenges in this integration is the lack of an efficient service\nregistry system that caters to issues associated with the dynamic and volatile\nmobile environments. Existing service registry technologies designed for\ntraditional systems fall short of accommodating such issues. In this paper, we\npropose a novel approach to manage service registry systems provided 'solely'\nover mobile devices, and thus realising an SOA without the need for high-end\ncomputing systems. The approach manages a dynamic service registry system in\nthe form of light weight and distributed registries. We assess the feasibility\nof our approach by engineering and deploying a working prototype of the\nproposed registry system over actual mobile devices. A comparative study of the\nproposed approach and the traditional UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery,\nand Integration) registry is also included.

This\npermits less frequent communication without significant loss of precision,\nprovided that clock rates change sufficiently slowly.\n  (3) We present a coupling scheme that allows to make these algorithms\nself-stabilizing while preserving their high precision. The scheme utilizes a\nlow-precision, but self-stabilizing algorithm for the purpose of recovery.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 3 figures, full version of the paper in proceedings of SSS\n  2016"]}]
