From the\ntheoretical point of view, these oscillations may be modeled by the process of\naccretion disk instability, driven by the dominant radiation pressure and\nenhanced heating of the plasma. Although the mean accretion rate in this source\nis probably below the Eddington limit, the oscillations will still have large\namplitudes. As the observations show, the source can exhibit strong wind\noutflow during the soft state. This wind may help to partially or even\ncompletely stabilize the heartbeat. Using our hydrodynamical code GLADIS, we\nmodeled the evolution of an accretion disk responsible for X-ray emission of\nthe source. We accounted for a variable wind outflow from the disk surface. We\nexamined the data archive from the Chandra and XMM-Newton satellites to find\nthe observed limitations on the wind physical properties, such as its velocity\nand ionization state.

In this work, we present a novel\nunified video co-segmentation framework inspired by the recent Structured\nSparse Subspace Clustering ($\\mathrm{S^{3}C}$) based on the {\\em\nself-expressiveness} model. Our method yields more consistent segmentation\nresults. In order to improve the detectability of motion features with missing\ntrajectories due to occlusion or tracked points moving out of frames, we add an\nextra-dimensional signature to the motion trajectories. Moreover, we\nreformulate the $\\mathrm{S^{3}C}$ algorithm by adding the affine subspace\nconstraint in order to make it more suitable to segment rigid motions lying in\naffine subspaces of dimension at most $3$. Our experiments on MOViCS dataset\nshow that our framework achieves the highest overall performance among baseline\nalgorithms and demonstrate its robustness to heavy noise.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables, extend ICIP 2016"]}]

Thermal management of flexible electronics creates a demand for\nflexible materials with highly anisotropic thermal conductivity, which work as\nheat spreaders to remove excess heat in the in-plane direction and as heat\nshields to protect human skin or device components under them from heating.\nThis study proposes a self-assembled silver nanowire network with high thermal\nand electrical anisotropy with the potential to solve these challenges. The\nin-plane thermal conductivity of the network along the axial direction of\nsilver nanowires is measured as 37 W/m-K while the cross-plane thermal\nconductivity is only 0.36 W/m-K. The results of measurements of electrical and\nthermal conductivities suggest that abundant wire-wire contacts strongly impede\nthermal transport. The excellent alignment of nanowires results in the same\nanisotropy ratio of 3 for both thermal and electrical conduction in the two\nin-plane directions. The ratio remains unchanged as the temperature decrease to\n50 K, which indicates that wire-wire contacts lower the thermal and electrical\nconduction in the two directions to the same extent and their effect is\nindependent of temperature. In addition, phonon softening markedly reduces the\nDebye temperatures of the network, which are fitted from the electrical\nresistivity data. As a result of phonon thermal conduction, the Lorenz numbers\nof the film in the two directions, which are approximately the same, are larger\nthan the Sommerfeld value at room temperature and decrease as temperature\ndecreases because of small angle scattering and the reduced phonon\ncontribution. This nanowire network provides a solution to the emerging\nchallenges of thermal management of flexible electronics.\n"]}]

There is\nconsiderable interest in searching for their faint and rapidly fading\nelectromagnetic (EM) counterparts, though GW position uncertainties are as\ncoarse as hundreds of square degrees. Because LIGO's sensitivity to binary\nneutron stars is limited to the local universe, the area on the sky that must\nbe searched could be reduced by weighting positions by mass, luminosity, or\nstar formation in nearby galaxies. Since GW observations provide information\nabout luminosity distance, combining the reconstructed volume with positions\nand redshifts of galaxies could reduce the area even more dramatically.

For this, we have constructed an N-body code that\nincludes tides in the affine approximation, where stars are modeled as\nself-similar ellipsoidal polytropes, and GR corrections using the commonly-used\npost-Newtonian formalism. Using this numerical formalism, we are able resolve\nthe leading effect from tides and GR across several orders of magnitude in both\nstellar radius and initial target binary separation. We find that the main\neffect from tides is the formation of two-body tidal captures that form during\nthe chaotic and resonant evolution of the triple system. The two stars\nundergoing the capture spiral in and merge. The inclusion of tides can thus\nlead to an increase on the stellar coalescence rate. We also develop an\nanalytical framework for calculating the cross section of tidal inspirals\nbetween any pair of objects with similar mass. From our analytical and\nnumerical estimates we find that the rate of tidal inspirals relative to\ncollisions increases as the initial semi-major axis of the target binary\nincreases and the radius of the interacting tidal objects decreases. The\nlargest effect is therefore found for triple systems hosting white dwarfs and\nneutron stars. In this case, we find the rate of highly eccentric white dwarf -\nneutron star mergers to likely be dominated by tidal inspirals.

The variability amplitude, the light-curve\nshape, and the magnitude of V1027~Cyg at maximum light change noticeably from\ncycle to cycle. An ambiguous correlation of the $B-V$ and $U-B$ colors with the\nbrightness has been revealed. The spectral energy distribution for V1027~Cyg\nfrom our photometry in the range 0.36 ($U$)-5.0 ($M$) $\\mu$m corresponds to\nspectral types from G8I to K3I at different phases of the pulsation cycle.\nLow-resolution spectra of V1027 Cyg in the range $\\lambda$4400--9200 \\AA\\ were\ntaken during 16 nights over the period 1995--2015. At the 1995 and 2011\nphotometric minima the star's spectrum exhibited molecular TiO bands whose\nintensity corresponded to spectral types M0--M1, while the photometric data\npoint to a considerably earlier spectral type. We hypothesize that the TiO\nbands are formed in the upper layers of the extended stellar atmosphere. We\nhave measured the equivalent widths of the strongest absorption lines, in\nparticular, the infrared Ca~II triplet in the spectrum of V1027~Cyg. The\ncalcium triplet (Ca T) with $W_{\\lambda}(\\mathrm{Ca~T})=20.3\\pm1.8$ \\AA\\ as a\nluminosity indicator for supergiants places V1027 Cyg in the region of the\nbrightest G--K supergiants.

Christol criterion is a basic and vital tool in\nthe recent striking work of Delaygue, Rivoal and Roques on the N-integrality of\nthe hypergeometric mirror maps with rational parameters. In this paper, we\ndevelop a systematic theory on the N-integrality of the hypergeometric series\nwith parameters from quadratic fields. We first present a detailed $p$-adic\nanalysis to set up a criterion of the $p$-adic integrality of the\nhypergeometric series with parameters from rational fields. Consequently, we\npresent two equivalent statements for the hypergeometric series with parameters\nfrom algebraic number fields to be N-integral. Finally, by using these results,\nintroducing a new function that extends the Christol's function and developing\na further $p$-adic analysis, we establish a criterion for the N-integrality of\nthe hypergeometric series with parameters from the quadratic fields. In the\nprocess, there are two important ingredients. One is the uniform distribution\nresult of roots of a quadratic congruence which is due to Duke, Friedlander and\nIwaniec together with Toth. Another one is an upper bound on the number of\nsolutions of polynomial congruences given by Stewart in 1991.\n","Comment: 62 pages"]}]
