It has the feature of working\ndirectly in the visibility domain, which is the natural approach to adopt with\nradio interferometer data, avoiding systematics introduced by the imaging\nprocess. As a proof of concept, we provide results for visibility simulations\nof individual galaxies with flux density S >= 10 muJy at the phase centre of\nthe proposed SKA1-MID baseline configuration, adopting 12 frequency channels in\nthe band 950 - 1190 MHz. Weak lensing shear measurements from a population of\ngalaxies with realistic flux and scalelength distributions are obtained after\nnatural gridding of the raw visibilities.

However, previous\ndielectric, few-layer designs only achieved moderate asymmetry ratios, and a\nfundamental understanding of bounds on asymmetric radiation from arbitrary\nstructures is still lacking. Here, we show that breaking the 180$^\\circ$\nrotational symmetry of the structure is crucial for achieving highly asymmetric\nradiation. We develop a general temporal coupled-mode theory formalism to\nderive bounds on the asymmetric decay rates to the top and bottom of a photonic\ncrystal slab for a resonance with arbitrary in-plane wavevector. Guided by this\nformalism, we show that infinite asymmetry is still achievable even without the\nneed of back-reflection mirrors, and we provide numerical examples of designs\nthat achieve asymmetry ratios exceeding $10^4$. The emission direction can also\nbe rapidly switched from top to bottom by tuning the wavevector or frequency.\nFurthermore, we show that with the addition of weak material absorption loss,\nsuch structures can be used to achieve perfect absorption with single-sided\nillumination, even for single-pass absorption rates less than $0.5\\%$ and\nwithout back-reflection mirrors. Our work provides new design principles for\nachieving highly directional radiation and perfect absorption in photonics.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 4 figures in main text and 8 pages, 5 figures in appendix.\n  V2: Updated version as published in Optica"]}]

Using a discrete\ncodebook consisting of multiple analog beams, each beam focuses on a certain\nrange of angles of arrival or departure and corresponds to a set of fixed phase\nshifts across frequency due to practical hardware considerations. However, for\nsufficiently large bandwidth, the gain provided by the phased array is actually\nfrequency dependent, which is an effect called beam squint, and this effect\noccurs even if the radiation pattern of the antenna elements is frequency\nindependent. This paper examines the nature of beam squint for a uniform linear\narray (ULA) and analyzes its impact on codebook design as a function of the\nnumber of antennas and system bandwidth normalized by the carrier frequency.\nThe criterion for codebook design is to guarantee that each beam's minimum gain\nfor a range of angles and for all frequencies in the wideband system exceeds a\ntarget threshold, for example 3 dB below the array's maximum gain. Analysis and\nnumerical examples suggest that a denser codebook is required to compensate for\nbeam squint. For example, 54% more beams are needed compared to a codebook\ndesign that ignores beam squint for a ULA with 32 antennas operating at a\ncarrier frequency of 73 GHz and bandwidth of 2.5 GHz. Furthermore, beam squint\nwith this design criterion limits the bandwidth or the number of antennas of\nthe array if the other one is fixed.\n","Comment: 6 pages, to be published in Proc.

The algorithm\npresented here retains the accuracy of earlier methods but yields at least\ntenfold speedup. The improvement is due to two innovations.

In doing so,\nextra uncertainties may arise during the inversion processes. The proposed SHM\nframework avoids such intermediate inversion processes by adopting amplitude\nversus angle (AVA) data. In addition, SHM typically involves assimilating a\nlarge amount of observed seismic attributes into reservoir models. To handle\nthe big-data problem in SHM, the proposed framework adopts the following\nwavelet-based sparse representation procedure: First, a discrete wavelet\ntransform is applied to observed seismic attributes. Then, uncertainty analysis\nis conducted in the wavelet domain to estimate noise in the resulting wavelet\ncoefficients, and to calculate a corresponding threshold value. Wavelet\ncoefficients above the threshold value, called leading wavelet coefficients\nhereafter, are used as the data for history matching.

If Bennett is right in proposing to assimilate organized complexity\nwith \"computational content\", then the fundamental cause of the increase of\ncomplexity in the universe is the existence of computing mechanisms with\nmemory, and able to cumulatively create and preserve computational contents. In\nthis view, the universe computes, remembers its calculations, and reuses them\nto conduct further computations. Evolutionary mechanisms are such forms of\ncumulative computation with memory and we owe them the organized complexity of\nlife.
