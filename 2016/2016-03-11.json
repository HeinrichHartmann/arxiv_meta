These series\narise as coefficients in the R4 and D4R4 interactions in the low energy\nexpansion of scattering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric string theory\nreduced to D=10-d dimensions on a torus T^d, d<8. For each d these amplitudes\nare automorphic functions on the rank d+1 symmetry group E_d+1. Of particular\nsignificance is the orbit content of the Fourier modes of these series when\nexpanded in three different parabolic subgroups, corresponding to certain\nlimits of string theory. This is of interest in the classification of a variety\nof instantons that correspond to minimal or next-to-minimal BPS orbits. In the\nlimit of decompactification from D to D+1 dimensions many such instantons are\nrelated to charged 1/2-BPS or 1/4-BPS black holes with euclidean world-lines\nwrapped around the large dimension. In a different limit the instantons give\nnonperturbative corrections to string perturbation theory, while in a third\nlimit they describe nonperturbative contributions in eleven-dimensional\nsupergravity. A proof is given that these three distinct Fourier expansions\nhave certain vanishing coefficients that are expected from string theory. In\nparticular, the Eisenstein series for these special values of s have markedly\nfewer Fourier coefficients than typical ones. The corresponding mathematics\ninvolves showing that the wavefront sets of the Eisenstein series are supported\non only certain coadjoint nilpotent orbits - just the minimal and trivial\norbits in the 1/2-BPS case, and just the next-to-minimal, minimal and trivial\norbits in the 1/4-BPS case. Thus as a byproduct we demonstrate that the\nnext-to-minimal representations occur automorphically for E6, E7, and E8, and\nhence the first two nontrivial low energy coefficients are exotic\ntheta-functions.\n","Comment: v3: 127 pp. Minor changes.

However for intrinsically unstructured proteins, alpha-helical\nproteins or proteins containing several disordered fragments, the assignment\nbecomes problematic because of high degree of backbone shift degeneracy. In\nthis backdrop, a novel reduced dimensionality (RD) experiment\n-(5,3)D-hNCO-CANH- is presented to facilitate (and/or to validate) the\nsequential backbone resonance assignment in such proteins. The proposed 3D NMR\nexperiment makes use of the modulated amide 15N chemical shifts (resulting from\nthe joint sampling along both its indirect dimensions) to resolve the ambiguity\ninvolved in connecting the neighboring amide resonances (i.e. HiNi and\nHi-1Ni-1) for overlapping amide NH peaks.

The improvisation is based on the fact that\nthe linear combinations of intra-residue and inter-residue backbone chemical\nshifts along both the co-evolved indirect dimensions span a wider spectral\nrange and produce better peak dispersion than the individual shifts themselves.\nTaken together, the experiment -in combination with routine triple resonance 3D\nNMR experiments involving backbone amide (1H and 15N) and carbon (13C-alpha and\n13C') chemical shifts- will serve as a powerful complementary tool to achieve\nthe nearly complete assignment of protein backbone resonances in a time\nefficient manner.

The crucial spectral features in the\nglobal 21 cm signal (turning points) occur at low radio frequencies <100 MHz.\nIn addition to the human-generated RFI, Earth's ionosphere drastically corrupts\nlow-frequency radio observations from the ground. In this paper, we examine the\neffects of time-varying ionospheric refraction, absorption and thermal emission\nat these low radio frequencies and their combined effect on any ground-based\nglobal 21 cm experiment. It should be noted that this is the first study of the\neffect of a dynamic ionosphere on global 21 cm experiments. The fluctuations in\nthe ionosphere are influenced by solar activity with flicker noise\ncharacteristics. The same characteristics are reflected in the ionospheric\ncorruption to any radio signal passing through the ionosphere.

We\npropose fine-scale quantitative descriptors for an active region's complexity\nand relate them to the Mount Wilson classification. We analyze the local\ncorrelation structure within continuum and magnetogram data, as well as the\ncross-correlation between continuum and magnetogram data. We compute the\nintrinsic dimension, partial correlation, and canonical correlation analysis\n(CCA) of image patches of continuum and magnetogram active region images taken\nfrom the SOHO-MDI instrument. We use masks of sunspots derived from continuum\nas well as larger masks of magnetic active regions derived from the magnetogram\nto analyze separately the core part of an active region from its surrounding\npart. We find the relationship between complexity of an active region as\nmeasured by Mount Wilson and the intrinsic dimension of its image patches.\nPartial correlation patterns exhibit approximately a third-order Markov\nstructure. CCA reveals different patterns of correlation between continuum and\nmagnetogram within the sunspots and in the region surrounding the sunspots.\nThese results also pave the way for patch-based dictionary learning with a view\ntowards automatic clustering of active regions.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in the Journal of Space Weather and Space\n  Climate (SWSC). 23 pages, 11 figures"]}]

Through several cases,\nwe illustrate what we can learn from the TDS charts. Furthermore, we apply the\nTDS method to 74 flares equal to or greater than M5.0-class, and reach the\nfollowing statistical results. First, EUV peaks are always behind the soft\nX-ray (SXR) peaks and stronger flares tend to have a faster cooling rate. There\nis a power law correlation between the peak delay times and the cooling rates,\nsuggesting a coherent cooling process of flares from SXR to EUV emissions.\nSecond, there are two distinct temperature drift patterns, called Type I and\nType II. For Type I flares, the enhanced emission drifts from high to low\ntemperature like a quadrilateral, whereas for Type II flares, the drift pattern\nlooks like a triangle. Statistical analysis suggests that Type II flares are\nmore impulsive than Type I flares. Third, for late-phase flares, the peak\nintensity ratio of the late phase to the main phase is roughly correlated with\nthe flare class, and the flares with a strong late phase are all confined. We\nbelieve that the re-deposition of the energy carried by a flux rope, that\nunsuccessfully erupts out, into thermal emissions is responsible for the strong\nlate phase found in a confined flare. Besides, with some cases we illustrate\nthe signatures of the flare thermodynamic process in the chromosphere and\ntransition region in TDS charts.

To distinguish such models from genuine quantum physical\nmodels, they often called quantum-like (although often people simply speak\nabout, e.g., \"quantum cognition\"). These novel applications generate a number\nof foundational questions. Nowadays we can speak about a new science -\nfoundations of quantum-like modeling. At the first stage this science was\nmainly about comparison of classical and quantum models, mainly in the\nprobabilistic setting. It was found that statistical data from cognitive\npsychology violate some basic constraints posed on data by classical\nprobability theory (Kolmogorov, 1933); in particular, the constraints given by\nthe formula of total probability and Bell's type inequalities. Recently another\nquestion attracted some attention. In spite of real success in applications,\nthere are no reason to believe that the quantum probability would cover\ncompletely all problems of, e.g., cognition. May be more general probability\nmodels have to be explored. A similar problem attracted a lot of attention in\nfoundations of quantum physics culminating in a series of experiments to check\nSorkin's equality for the triple-slit experiment by Weihs' group. In this note\nwe present a similar test in the cognitive experimental setting.

We propose new algorithms for mapping boolean constraint\nsatisfaction problems (CSPs) onto QA hardware mitigating these limitations. In\nparticular we develop a new embedding algorithm for mapping a CSP onto a\nhardware Ising model with a fixed sparse set of interactions, and propose two\nnew decomposition algorithms for solving problems too large to map directly\ninto hardware.\n  The mapping technique is locally-structured, as hardware compatible Ising\nmodels are generated for each problem constraint, and variables appearing in\ndifferent constraints are chained together using ferromagnetic couplings. In\ncontrast, global embedding techniques generate a hardware independent Ising\nmodel for all the constraints, and then use a minor-embedding algorithm to\ngenerate a hardware compatible Ising model. We give an example of a class of\nCSPs for which the scaling performance of D-Wave's QA hardware using the local\nmapping technique is significantly better than global embedding.\n  We validate the approach by applying D-Wave's hardware to circuit-based\nfault-diagnosis.

Because of the\ntremendous potential for clinical applications, certain questions regarding\ndecoded neurofeedback (DecNef) must be addressed. Neurofeedback effects can\nlast for months, but the short- to mid-term dynamics are not known.\nSpecifically, can the same subjects learn to induce neural patterns in two\nopposite directions in different sessions? This leads to a further question,\nwhether learning to reverse a neural pattern may be less effective after\ntraining to induce it in a previous session. Here we employed a\nwithin-subjects' design, with subjects undergoing DecNef training sequentially\nin opposite directions (up or down regulation of confidence judgements in a\nperceptual task), with the order counterbalanced across subjects. Behavioral\nresults indicated that the manipulation was strongly influenced by the order\nand direction of neurofeedback. We therefore applied nonlinear mathematical\nmodeling to parametrize four main consequences of DecNef: main effect of change\nin behavior, strength of down-regulation effect relative to up-regulation,\nmaintenance of learning over sessions, and anterograde learning interference.\nModeling results revealed that DecNef successfully induced bidirectional\nbehavioral changes in different sessions. Furthermore, up-regulation was more\nsizable, and the effect was largely preserved even after an interval of\none-week. Lastly, the second week effect was diminished as compared to the\nfirst week effect, indicating strong anterograde learning interference.

The suppression\nfactor of the Auger recombination is determined by the two-dimensional\ncharacter of the system, given by the ratio of the Fermi energy of electrons\nand the separation of the electron levels quantized in the growth direction.\nOur predictions can be tested experimentally and we discuss their implications\nfor semiconductor lasers relying on injection of spin-polarized electrons.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 1 figure"]}]

In particular we consider the effects on the star's surface\nmagnetic flux, open magnetic flux, mean azimuthal field strength, coronal free\nmagnetic energy, coronal heating and flux rope eruptions. To do this, we apply\na magnetic flux transport model to describe the photospheric evolution, and\ncouple this to the non-potential coronal evolution using a magnetofrictional\ntechnique. A flux emergence model is applied to add new magnetic flux onto the\nphotosphere and into the corona. The parameters of this flux emergence model\nare derived from the solar flux emergence profile, however the rate of\nemergence can be increased to represent higher flux emergence rates than the\nSun's. Overall we find that flux emergence has a greater effect on the\nnon-potential coronal properties compared to differential rotation, with all\nthe aforementioned properties increasing with increasing flux emergence rate.\nAlthough differential rotation has a lesser effect on the overall coronal\nproperties compared to flux emergence, varying differential rotation does alter\nthe coronal structure. As the differential rotation rate increases, the corona\nbecomes more open, and more non-potential.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 18 figures"]}]
