The modified arrays enable high-precision individual analog\ntuning of each cell, with sub-1% accuracy, while keeping the highly optimized\ncells, with their long-term state retention, intact. The array has an area of\n0.33 um^2 per cell, and is at least one order of magnitude more dense than the\nreported prior implementations of nonvolatile analog memories. The demonstrated\nvector-by-vector multiplier, using gate coupling to additional periphery cells,\nhas ~2% precision, limited by the aggregate effect of cell noise, retention,\nmismatch, process variations, tuning precision, and capacitive crosstalk. A\ndifferential version of the multiplier has allowed us to demonstrate sub-3%\ntemperature drift of the output signal in the range between 25C and 85C.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 11 pages"]}]
