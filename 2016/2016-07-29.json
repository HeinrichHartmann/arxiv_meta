Particularly\nimportant from this perspective is the amount of olivine excavated from the\nvestan mantle by impacts, as this constrains both the interior structure of\nVesta and the number of major impacts the asteroid suffered during its life.\nThe NASA Dawn mission revealed that olivine is present on Vesta's surface in\nlimited quantities, concentrated in small patches at a handful of sites and\ninterpreted as the result of the excavation of endogenous olivine. Later works\nraised the possibility that the olivine had an exogenous origin, based on the\ngeologic and spectral features of the deposits. In this work we quantitatively\nexplore the proposed scenario of a exogenous origin for the detected olivine to\ninvestigate whether its presence on Vesta can be explained as a natural outcome\nof the collisional history of the asteroid. We took advantage of the impact\ncontamination model previously developed to study the origin and amount of dark\nand hydrated materials observed by Dawn on Vesta, which we updated by\nperforming dedicated hydrocode impact simulations. We show that the exogenous\ndelivery of olivine by impacts can offer a viable explanation for the currently\nidentified olivine-rich sites without violating the constraint posed by the\nlack of global olivine signatures on Vesta. Our results indicate that no mantle\nexcavation is in principle required to explain the observations of the Dawn\nmission and support the idea that the vestan crust could be thicker than\nindicated by simple geochemical models based on the Howardite-Eucrite-Diogenite\nfamily of meteorites.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication on the journal Icarus"]}]

One explanation is a\nvery short activity cycle of the star with that period. Another possibility,\nalso proposed by others in similar cases, is that the larger flares may be\ntriggered by external phenomena, such as magnetically interaction with an\nunseen companion.

Video registration, i.e.\nthe task of aligning an input video sequence to a pre-built 3D model, relies on\na matching process of local keypoints extracted on the query sequence to a 3D\npoint cloud. The overall registration performance is strictly tied to the\nactual quality of this 2D-3D matching, and can degrade if environmental\nconditions such as steep changes in lighting like the ones between day and\nnight occur. To effectively register an egocentric video sequence under these\nconditions, we propose to tackle the source of the problem: the matching\nprocess. To overcome the shortcomings of standard matching techniques, we\nintroduce a novel embedding space that allows us to obtain robust matches by\njointly taking into account local descriptors, their spatial arrangement and\ntheir temporal robustness. The proposal is evaluated using unconstrained\negocentric video sequences both in terms of matching quality and resulting\nregistration performance using different 3D models of historical landmarks.

The traditional hashing methods learn hash\nfunctions to generate binary codes from hand-crafted features, which achieve\nlimited accuracy since the hand-crafted features cannot optimally represent the\nimage content and preserve the semantic similarity. Recently, several deep\nhashing methods have shown better performance because the deep architectures\ngenerate more discriminative feature representations. However, these deep\nhashing methods are mainly designed for the supervised scenarios, which only\nexploit the semantic similarity information, but ignore the underlying data\nstructures. In this paper, we propose the semi-supervised deep hashing (SSDH)\nmethod, to perform more effective hash learning by simultaneously preserving\nthe semantic similarity and the underlying data structures.

First, a deep network is designed to\nextensively exploit both the labeled and unlabeled data, in which we construct\nthe similarity graph online in a mini-batch with the deep feature\nrepresentations. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed deep network is the\nfirst deep hashing method that can perform the hash code learning and feature\nlearning simultaneously in a semi-supervised fashion. Second, we propose a loss\nfunction suitable for the semi-supervised scenario by jointly minimizing the\nempirical error on the labeled data as well as the embedding error on both the\nlabeled and unlabeled data, which can preserve the semantic similarity, as well\nas capture the meaningful neighbors on the underlying data structures for\neffective hashing.

A key requirement of such systems is the need to provide\npredictable real-time performance: the timing correctness of the system should\nbe analyzable at design time with a quantitative metric and guaranteed at\nruntime with high assurance. This requirement of predictability is particularly\nimportant for safety-critical domains such as automobiles, aerospace, defense,\nmanufacturing and medical devices.\n  The work in this dissertation focuses on the challenges arising from the use\nof modern multi-core platforms in CPS. Even as of today, multi-core platforms\nare rarely used in safety-critical applications primarily due to the temporal\ninterference caused by contention on various resources shared among processor\ncores, such as caches, memory buses, and I/O devices. Such interference is hard\nto predict and can significantly increase task execution time, e.g., up to 12x\non commodity quad-core platforms. To address the problem of ensuring timing\npredictability on multi-core platforms, we develop novel analytical and systems\ntechniques in this dissertation. Our proposed techniques theoretically bound\ntemporal interference that tasks may suffer from when accessing shared\nresources. Our techniques also involve software primitives and algorithms for\nreal-time operating systems and hypervisors, which significantly reduce the\ndegree of the temporal interference.
