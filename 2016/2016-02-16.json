Let $X = G/H$ be a homogeneous manifold of\na Lie group $G$ and let $d$ be a geodesic distance on $X$ inducing the same\ntopology. Suppose there exists a subgroup $G_S$ of $G$ that acts transitively\non $X$, such that each element $g \\in G_S$ induces a locally biLipschitz\nhomeomorphism of the metric space $(X,d)$. Then the metric is locally\nbiLipschitz equivalent to a sub-Riemannian metric. Any such metric is defined\nby a bracket generating $G_S$-invariant sub-bundle of the tangent bundle.\n  The result is a consequence of a more general fact that requires a transitive\nfamily of uniformly biLipschitz diffeomorphisms with a control on their\ndifferentials. It will be relevant that the group acting transitively on the\nspace is a Lie group and so it is locally compact, since, in general, the whole\ngroup of biLipschitz maps, unlikely the isometry group, is not locally compact.\n  Our method also gives an elementary proof of the following fact. Given a\nLipschitz sub-bundle of the tangent bundle of a Finsler manifold, then both the\nclass of piecewise differentiable curves tangent to the sub-bundle and the\nclass of Lipschitz curves almost everywhere tangent to the sub-bundle give rise\nto the same Finsler-Carnot-Carath\\'eodory metric, under the condition that the\ntopologies induced by these distances coincide with the manifold topology.\n","Comment: 31 pages, final version"]}]

A cut (B,W) of G (a bipartition of V(G)) separates\na clique K and a stable set S if $K\\subseteq B$ and $S\\subseteq W$. A\nClique-Stable Set Separator is a family of cuts such that for every clique K,\nand for every stable set S disjoint from K, there exists a cut in the family\nthat separates K and S. Given a class of graphs, the question is to know\nwhether every graph of the class admits a Clique-Stable Set Separator\ncontaining only polynomially many cuts. It is open for the class of all graphs,\nand also for perfect graphs, which was Yannakakis' original question. Here we\ninvestigate on perfect graphs with no balanced skew-partition; the balanced\nskew-partition was introduced in the proof of the Strong Perfect Graph Theorem.\nRecently, Chudnovsky, Trotignon, Trunck and Vuskovic proved that forbidding\nthis unfriendly decomposition permits to recursively decompose Berge graphs\nusing 2-join and complement 2-join until reaching a basic graph, and they found\nan efficient combinatorial algorithm to color those graphs. We apply their\ndecomposition result to prove that perfect graphs with no balanced\nskew-partition admit a quadratic-size Clique-Stable Set Separator, by taking\nadvantage of the good behavior of 2-join with respect to this property. We then\ngeneralize this result and prove that the Strong Erdos-Hajnal property holds in\nthis class, which means that every such graph has a linear-size biclique or\ncomplement biclique. This property does not hold for all perfect graphs (Fox\n2006), and moreover when the Strong Erdos-Hajnal property holds in a hereditary\nclass of graphs, then both the Erdos-Hajnal property and the polynomial\nClique-Stable Set Separation hold.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1308.6444"]}]

For a number of species a reference genome is not available\nso the analyses of targeted sequencing data, for example polymorphic structural\nvariation caused by mobile elements is difficult; clustering methods are\npreferred for such data analysis. Clustering of reads requires a clustering\nthreshold parameter, which is used to compare and group reads. However,\ndetermining the optimal clustering threshold for a read dataset is challenging\nbecause of different sequence composition, the number of sequences present, and\nalso the amount of sequencing errors in the dataset. High values of the\nclustering threshold parameter can falsely inflate the number of recovered\ngenomic regions, while low values of clustering threshold can merge reads from\ndistinct regions into a single cluster. Thus, an algorithm that can empirically\ndetermine clustering threshold is needed. We propose a pipeline for clustering\ngenomic sequences wherein the clustering threshold is empirically determined\nfrom the NGS data. The optimal threshold is decided based on two internal\nclustering measures which assess clusters for small intra-cluster diameters and\nlarge inter-cluster distances. We evaluate the pipeline on two simulated\ndatasets derived from human genome sequence simulating different genomic\nregions and sequencing depth. The total number of clusters obtained from our\npipeline is closer to the actual number of reference sequences when compared to\nsingle round of clustering.

The model is applied to the long-lead time forecasting of\nmid-May averaged soil moisture anomalies in Iowa over a high-resolution grid of\nspatial locations. Sea Surface Tem- perature (SST) is used to find past time\nperiods with similar trajectories to the current pre-forecast period. The\nanalog model is developed on projection coefficients from a basis expansion of\nthe soil moisture and SST fields. Separate models are constructed for locations\nfalling in each Iowa Crop Reporting District (CRD) and the forecasting ability\nof the proposed model is compared against a variety of alternative methods and\nmetrics.\n"]}]

Earlier, it was seen that the quantum interference between AFM\nspin density fluctuations and soft diffusive modes of the disordered metal is\nsuppressed, a consequence of the large-momentum scattering. The suppression of\nthis interference results in a non-singular temperature dependence of the\ncorresponding interaction correction to conductivity. However, at higher order\nof the spin-fermion coupling, electrons on the entire Fermi surface can be\nscattered successively by two spin density fluctuations and, in total, suffer a\nsmall momentum transfer.

For strong\ninteractions, the spectra reveal multiplon physics, i.e., relevant final states\nare characterized by two (doublon), three (triplon), four (quadruplon) and more\nholes, potentially forming stable compound objects or resonances with finite\nlifetime.

In addition, a\nfilter-operator technique is presented which allows to extract specific\ninformation on the final states at a given excitation energy.

We examine the morphology of the tSZ signal and compare it to other\ndatasets. The NIKA data are combined with Herschel satellite data to study the\nSED of the submm point source contaminants. We then perform a joint\nreconstruction of the intracluster medium (ICM) electronic pressure and density\nby combining NIKA, Planck, XMM-Newton, and Chandra data, focusing on the impact\nof the radio and submm sources on the reconstructed pressure profile. We find\nthat large-scale pressure distribution is unaffected by the point sources\nbecause of the resolved nature of the NIKA observations. The reconstructed\npressure in the inner region is slightly higher when the contribution of point\nsources are removed. We show that it is not possible to set strong constraints\non the central pressure distribution without accurately removing these\ncontaminants.

In this\npaper, we propose a modeling formalism and a synthesis algorithm that exploits\nthis hierarchical structure for more scalable synthesis.\n  We define local games on hierarchical graphs as a modeling formalism which\ndecomposes a large-scale reactive synthesis problem in two dimensions. First,\nthe construction of a hierarchical game graph introduces abstraction layers,\nwhere each layer is again a two-player game graph. Second, every such layer is\ndecomposed into multiple local game graphs, each corresponding to a node in the\nhigher level game graph. While local games have the potential to reduce the\nstate space for controller synthesis, they lead to more complex synthesis\nproblems where strategies computed for one local game can impose additional\nrequirements on lower-level local games.\n  Our second contribution is a procedure to construct a dynamic controller for\nlocal game graphs over hierarchies. The controller computes assume-admissible\nwinning strategies that satisfy local specifications in the presence of\nenvironment assumptions, and dynamically updates specifications and strategies\ndue to interactions between games at different abstraction layers at each step\nof the play. We show that our synthesis procedure is sound: the controller\nconstructs a play which satisfies all local specifications.

An analysis of the\nconstraints within the DW Hamiltonian formulation of the Einstein-Palatini\nvielbein formulation of GR and quantization of the generalized Dirac brackets\ndefined on differential forms lead to the covariant precanonical Schr\\\"odinger\nequation for quantum gravity. The resulting dynamics of quantum gravity is\ndescribed by the wave function or transition amplitudes on the total space of\nthe bundle of spin connections over space-time. Thus, precanonical quantization\nleads to the \"spin connection foam\" picture of quantum geometry represented by\na generally non-Gaussian random field of spin connection coefficients, whose\nprobability distribution is given by the precanonical wave function. The\nnormalizability of precanonical wave functions is argued to lead to the\nquantum-gravitational avoidance of curvature singularities. Possible\nconnections with LQG are briefly discussed.\n","Comment: 9 pages.

In particular, the first paper (Kent 2015) provided a\n\"foundation\" that connected elements of the ERA data model with components of\nthe first-order logical environment FOLE, and this second paper provides a\n\"superstructure\" that extends FOLE to the formalisms of first-order logic. The\nthird paper will define an \"interpretation\" of FOLE in terms of the\ntransformational passage, first described in (Kent 2013), from the\nclassification form of first-order logic to an equivalent interpretation form,\nthereby defining the formalism and semantics of first-order logical/relational\ndatabase systems (Kent 2011). The FOLE representation follows a conceptual\nstructures approach, that is completely compatible with Formal Concept Analysis\n(Ganter and Wille 1999) and Information Flow (Barwise and Seligman 1997).\n"]}]

Such codes trade the bandwidth needed to repair a\nfailed node with the overall amount of data stored in the network. Minimum\nstorage regenerating (MSR) codes are an important class of optimal regenerating\ncodes that minimize (first) the amount of data stored per node and (then) the\nrepair bandwidth. Specifically, an $[n,k,d]$-$(\\alpha)$ MSR code $\\mathbb{C}$\nover $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is defined as follows. Using such a code $\\mathbb{C}$, a\nfile $\\cal{F}$ consisting of $\\alpha k$ symbols over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ can be\ndistributed among $n$ nodes, each storing $\\alpha$ symbols, in such a way that:\nThe file $\\cal{F}$ can be recovered by downloading the content of any $k$ of\nthe $n$ nodes; and the content of any failed node can be reconstructed by\naccessing any $d$ of the remaining $n-1$ nodes and downloading $\\alpha/(d-k+1)$\nsymbols from each of these nodes. Unfortunately, explicit constructions of\n$[n,k,d]$ MSR codes are known only for certain special cases: either low rate,\nnamely $k/n<0.5$, or high repair connectivity, namely $d = n-1$. Although\nsetting $d = n-1$ minimizes the repair bandwidth, it may be impractical to\nconnect to all the remaining nodes in order to repair a single failed node. Our\nmain result in this paper is an explicit construction of systematic-repair\n$[n,k,d]$ MSR codes for all possible values of parameters $n,k,d$.

In order to construct these codes, we solve simultaneously several\nrepair scenarios, each of which is expressible as an interference alignment\nproblem.

In the offline phase, we introduce a\ncollaborative filtering approach based on matrix factorization. Our approach\nestimates expertise scores for both the skills that members list on their\nprofiles as well as the skills they are likely to have but do not explicitly\nlist. In the online phase (at query time) we use expertise scores on these\nskills as a feature in combination with other features to rank the results. To\nlearn the personalized ranking function, we propose a heuristic to extract\ntraining data from search logs while handling position and sample selection\nbiases. We tested our models on two products - LinkedIn homepage and LinkedIn\nrecruiter. A/B tests showed significant improvements in click through rates -\n31% for CTR@1 for recruiter (18% for homepage) as well as downstream messages\nsent from search - 37% for recruiter (20% for homepage). As of writing this\npaper, these models serve nearly all live traffic for skills search on LinkedIn\nhomepage as well as LinkedIn recruiter.\n","Comment: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Big Data"]}]

The study established that\nperformance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and user privacy\nwere key determinants for biometric ATMs acceptance, adoption and usage. The\nstudy further demonstrated that age, gender and experience were moderating\nfactors on effort expectancy with experience further moderating performance\nexpectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and user privacy.

A prominent example is the biological cell where, within a\nhighly crowded molecular environment, a myriad of different molecular receptor\npairs recognize their binding partner with astonishing accuracy. In thermal\nequilibrium it is usually admitted that the affinity of recognizer pairs only\ndepends on the nature of the two binding molecules. Accordingly, Boltzmann\nfactors of binding energy differences relate the molecular affinities among\ndifferent target molecules that compete for the same probe. Here, we consider\nthe molecular recognition of short DNA oligonucleotide single strands. We show\nthat a better matching oligonucleotide strand can prevail against a\ndisproportionally more concentrated competitor that exhibits reduced affinity\ndue to a mismatch. The magnitude of deviation from the simple picture above may\nreach several orders of magnitude. In our experiments the effective molecular\naffinity of a given strand remains elevated only as long as the better matching\ncompetitor is not present. We interpret our observations based on an\nenergy-barrier of entropic origin that occurs if two competing oligonucleotide\nstrands occupy the same probe simultaneously. In this situation the relative\nbinding affinities are reduced asymmetrically, which leads to an expression of\nthe free energy landscape that represents a formal analogue of a Landau\ndescription of phase transitions. Our mean field description reproduces the\nobservations in quantitative agreement. The advantage of improved molecular\nrecognition comes at no energetic cost other than the design of the molecular\nensemble, and the introduction of the competitor.

In principle, a system that implements QEC can actually pass a\n\"break-even\" point and preserve quantum information for longer than the\nlifetime of its constituent parts. Reaching the break-even point, however, has\nthus far remained an outstanding and challenging goal. Several previous works\nhave demonstrated elements of QEC in NMR, ions, nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers,\nphotons, and superconducting transmons. However, these works primarily\nillustrate the signatures or scaling properties of QEC codes rather than test\nthe capacity of the system to extend the lifetime of quantum information over\ntime. Here we demonstrate a QEC system that reaches the break-even point by\nsuppressing the natural errors due to energy loss for a qubit logically encoded\nin superpositions of coherent states, or cat states of a superconducting\nresonator. Moreover, the experiment implements a full QEC protocol by using\nreal-time feedback to encode, monitor naturally occurring errors, decode, and\ncorrect. As measured by full process tomography, the enhanced lifetime of the\nencoded information is 320 microseconds without any post-selection. This is 20\ntimes greater than that of the system's transmon, over twice as long as an\nuncorrected logical encoding, and 10% longer than the highest quality element\nof the system (the resonator's 0, 1 Fock states). Our results illustrate the\npower of novel, hardware efficient qubit encodings over traditional QEC\nschemes.

The MSPP algorithm leverages a\nmultiscale representation of the environment in $n$ dimensions. The information\nof the environment is stored in a tree data structure representing a recursive\ndyadic partitioning of the search space. The information used by the algorithm\nis the probability that a node in the tree corresponds to an obstacle in the\nsearch space. Such trees are often created from mainstream perception\nalgorithms, and correspond to quadtrees and octrees in two and three\ndimensions, respectively. We first present a new method to compute the graph\nneighbors in order to reduce the complexity of each iteration, from $O(| V|^2)$\nto $O(| V| \\log |V|)$. We then show how to delay expensive intermediate\ncomputations until we know that new information will be required, hence saving\ntime by not operating on information that is never used during the search.\nFinally, we present a way to remove the very expensive need to calculate a full\nmulti-scale map with the use of sampling and derive an theoretical upperbound\nof the probability of failure as a function of the number of samples.\n"]}]

Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is an inference\nframework that constructs an approximation to the true likelihood based on the\nsimilarity between the observed and simulated data as measured by a predefined\nset of summary statistics. Although the choice of appropriate problem-specific\nsummary statistics crucially influences the quality of the likelihood\napproximation and hence also the quality of the posterior sample in ABC, there\nare only few principled general-purpose approaches to the selection or\nconstruction of such summary statistics. In this paper, we develop a novel\nframework for this task using kernel-based distribution regression. We model\nthe functional relationship between data distributions and the optimal choice\n(with respect to a loss function) of summary statistics using kernel-based\ndistribution regression. We show that our approach can be implemented in a\ncomputationally and statistically efficient way using the random Fourier\nfeatures framework for large-scale kernel learning. In addition to that, our\nframework shows superior performance when compared to related methods on toy\nand real-world problems.\n"]}]
