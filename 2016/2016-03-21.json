Pauksztello has independently introduced them as\nco-t-structures). This axiomatizes the properties of stupid truncations of\ncomplexes in $K(B)$. We also construct weight structures for Voevodsky's\ncategories of motives and for various categories of spectra. A weight structure\n$w$ defines Postnikov towers of objects; these towers are canonical and\nfunctorial 'up to morphisms that are zero on cohomology'. For $Hw$ being the\nheart of $w$ (in $DM_{gm}$ we have $Hw=Chow$) we define a canonical\nconservative 'weakly exact' functor $t$ from our $C$ to a certain weak category\nof complexes $K_w(Hw)$. For any (co)homological functor $H:C\\to A$ for an\nabelian $A$ we construct a weight spectral sequence $T:H(X^i[j])\\implies\nH(X[i+j])$ where $(X^i)=t(X)$; it is canonical and functorial starting from\n$E_2$. This spectral sequences specializes to the 'usual' (Deligne's) weight\nspectral sequences for 'classical' realizations of motives and to\nAtiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequences for spectra. Under certain restrictions,\nwe prove that $K_0(C)\\cong K_0(Hw)$ and $K_0(End C)\\cong K_0(End Hw)$.\n  The definition of a weight structure is almost dual to those of a\nt-structure; yet several properties differ. One can often construct a certain\n$t$-structure which is 'adjacent' to $w$ and vice versa. This is the case for\nthe Voevodsky's $DM^{eff}_-$ (one obtains certain new Chow weight and\nt-structures for it; the heart of the latter is 'dual' to $Chow^{eff}$) and for\nthe stable homotopy category. The Chow t-structure is closely related to\nunramified cohomology.\n","Comment: Section 4.6 was corrected"]}]

But it is claimed that spinors as such cannot be represented\nin coordinates in a curved space-time. What general covariance means for\ntheories with fermions is thus unclear. In fact both commonplaces are wrong.\nThough it is not widely known, Ogievetsky and Polubarinov (OP) constructed\nspinors in coordinates in 1965, helping to spawn nonlinear group\nrepresentations. Locally, these spinors resemble the orthonormal basis or\n\"tetrad\" formalism in the symmetric gauge, but they are conceptually\nself-sufficient. The tetrad formalism is de-Ockhamized, with 6 extra fields and\n6 compensating gauge symmetries. OP spinors, as developed nonperturbatively by\nBilyalov, admit any coordinates at a point, but \"time\" must be listed first:\nthe product of the metric components and the matrix diag(-1,1,1,1) must have no\nnegative eigenvalues to yield a real symmetric square root function of the\nmetric. Thus the admissible coordinates depend on the types and values of the\nfields. Apart from coordinate order and spinorial two-valuedness, OP spinors\nform, with the metric, a nonlinear geometric object, with Lie and covariant\nderivatives. Such spinors avoid a spurious absolute object in the\nAnderson-Friedman analysis of substantive general covariance. They also permit\nthe gauge-invariant localization of the infinite-component gravitational energy\nin GR. Density-weighted spinors exploit the conformal invariance of the\nmassless Dirac equation to show that the volume element is absent. Thus instead\nof a matrix with 16 components, one can use weighted OP spinors coupled to the\n9-component symmetric unimodular square root of the conformal metric density.\nThe surprising mildness of the restrictions on coordinates for the\nSchwarzschild solution is exhibited.

Several tree-SPH\n(smoothed particle hydrodynamics) simulations have been carried out to study\nthe dependence of the star formation rate on the mass and size of a stellar\nbulge. In addition, different strengths of ram pressure and different\nalignments of the disc with respect to the intra-cluster medium (ICM) are\napplied. As claimed in previous works, when ram pressure is acting on a galaxy,\nthe star formation rate (SFR) is enhanced and rises up to four times with\nincreasing ICM density compared to galaxies that evolve in isolation. However,\na bulge suppresses the SFR when the same ram pressure is applied. Consequently,\nfewer new stars are formed because the SFR can be lowered by up to 2 M_sun/yr.\nFurthermore, the denser the surrounding gas, the more inter-stellar medium\n(ISM) is stripped. While at an ICM density of 10^-28 g/cm^3 about 30% of the\nISM is stripped, the galaxy is almost completely (more than 90%) stripped when\nan ICM density of 10^-27 g/cm^3 is applied. But again, a bulge prevents the\nstripping of the ISM and reduces the amount being stripped by up to 10%.\nThereby, fewer stars are formed in the wake if the galaxy contains a bulge. The\ndependence of the SFR on the disc tilt angle is not very pronounced. Hereby a\nslight trend of decreasing star formation with increasing inclination angle can\nbe determined. Furthermore, with increasing disc tilt angles, less gas is\nstripped and therefore fewer stars are formed in the wake. Reducing the disc\ngas mass fraction results in a lower SFR when the galaxies evolve in vacuum. On\nthe other hand, the enhancement of the SFR in case of acting ram pressure is\nless pronounced with increasing gas mass fraction. Moreover, the fractional\namount of stripped gas does not depend on the gas mass fraction.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 18 figures"]}]

The simplest physical mechanism to which this periodicity could be\nascribed is a dynamical effect produced by an orbiting supermassive black hole\ncompanion eclipsing the central engine. Interestingly, the optimal eclipse\nmodel infers a brightness enhancement of (136.4 \\pm 20 )%, suggesting an\neclipse resulting in a gravitational lensing brightening. Consisting with this\ninterpretation, the eclipse occurs for only ( 9.7 \\pm 0.2)% of the orbital\nperiod.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 2 figures"]}]

This assumption however is not always\npractical (especially in large markets) and agents usually need to go through\nsome costly deliberation process in order to learn their preferences. In this\npaper we assume that such deliberations are carried out via interviews, where\nan interview involves a man and a woman, each of whom learns information about\nthe other as a consequence. If everybody interviews everyone else, then clearly\nagents can fully learn their preferences. But interviews are costly, and we may\nwish to minimize their use. It is often the case, especially in practical\nsettings, that due to correlation between agents' preferences, it is\nunnecessary for all potential interviews to be carried out in order to obtain a\nstable matching. Thus the problem is to find a good strategy for interviews to\nbe carried out in order to minimize their use, whilst leading to a stable\nmatching. One way to evaluate the performance of an interview strategy is to\ncompare it against a naive algorithm that conducts all interviews. We argue\nhowever that a more meaningful comparison would be against an optimal offline\nalgorithm that has access to agents' preference orderings under complete\ninformation. We show that, unless P=NP, no offline algorithm can compute the\noptimal interview strategy in polynomial time.

Here we offer a novel\nmeasure, namely, the \"dual frequency RV-coupling coefficient\", for assessing\ndifferent types of frequency-frequency interactions that subserve information\nflow in the brain. This is a measure of coherence between two complex-valued\nvectors, consisting of the set of Fourier coefficients for two different\nfrequency bands, within or across two brain regions.

Here, we extend the notion of information flow analysis, a well\nestablished set of methods developed in software security, to obtain a unified\nframework that captures and extends system theoretic results in control system\nsecurity. In particular, we propose the Kullback Liebler (KL) divergence as a\ncausal measure of information flow, which quantifies the effect of adversarial\ninputs on sensor outputs. We show that the proposed measure characterizes the\nresilience of control systems to specific attack strategies by relating the KL\ndivergence to optimal detection techniques. We then relate information flows to\nstealthy attack scenarios where an adversary can bypass detection. Finally,\nthis article examines active detection mechanisms where a defender\nintelligently manipulates control inputs or the system itself in order to\nelicit information flows from an attacker's malicious behavior.

This is not an easy task if\ncombined with cosmological constraints, since the mechanism of moduli\nstabilization fixes both the scale of supersymmetric particles and the scale of\nmoduli, which tend to be of the same order. However, if on the one hand\nsupersymmetric particles with TeV mass are desired in order to address the\nhierarchy problem, on the other hand the cosmological moduli problem requires\nthe moduli to be heavier than 100 TeV. The specific setup of sequestered\ncompactifications makes this hierarchy achievable, at least in principle: as in\nthese models the visible sector is located on a stack of D3-branes at\nsingularities, a physical separation between the visible degrees of freedom and\nthe SUSY-breaking sources takes place. Such decoupling translates into a\nhierarchy between the scale of SUSY-breaking and the spectrum of supersymmetric\nparticles. Moreover, it is interesting to notice that moduli are the\nfour-dimensional manifestation of the existence of extra-dimensions, and then\ntheir presence is a common feature of all string compactifications. Since they\nare gravitationally coupled, they could decay late in the history of the\nuniverse, affecting in a significant way its cosmological evolution. Possible\ndeviations of the cosmological observables from the values predicted by the\nstandard Hot Big Bang Theory constitute an interesting alternative for the\ndiscovery of BSM physics, which is complementary to the particle physics\nsearch. For this reason in addition to SUSY-breaking in sequestered models, I\nalso studied several cosmological scenarios arising from them, such as\nproduction of non-thermal dark matter and dark radiation, reheating from moduli\ndecay and inflation.\n","Comment: Ph.D. thesis"]}]
