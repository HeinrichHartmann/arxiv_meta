In order to compare the performance of the LDL\nalgorithms, six representative and diverse evaluation measures are selected via\na clustering analysis, and the first batch of label distribution datasets are\ncollected and made publicly available. Experimental results on one artificial\nand fifteen real-world datasets show clear advantages of the specialized\nalgorithms, which indicates the importance of special design for the\ncharacteristics of the LDL problem.\n"]}]

The magneto-transport in\nNbP is dominated by these highly anisotropic W2-WSM pockets, in which Weyl\nfermions are well protected from defect backscattering by real spin\nconservation associated to the chiral nodes. However, with a minimal doping of\n$\\sim$1\\% Cr, the mobility of NbP is degraded by more than two order of\nmagnitude, due to the invalid of helicity protection to magnetic impurities.\nHelicity protected Weyl fermion transport is also manifested in chiral anomaly\ninduced negative magnetoresistance, controlled by the W1-WSM states. In the\nquantum regime below 10 K, the intervalley scattering time by impurities\nbecomes a large constant, producing the sharp and nearly identical conductivity\nenhancement at low magnetic field.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures; submitted on June 2, 2015; Accepted by PRB Rapid\n  Communications"]}]

Overall, the global mean neutral temperature increases by up to 15%,\nwhile the maximum thermal response is higher in the winter Southern Hemisphere\nat high-latitudes than the summer Northern Hemisphere: 40% vs. 20%increase in\nhigh-latitude mean temperature, respectively. The global mean Joule heating\nincreases by more than a factor of three.

We impose either a vertical or a\nhorizontal uniform magnetic field in a convection-driven turbulent flow.\nResults: We find that super-equipartition magnetic flux concentrations are\nformed near the surface with domain depths of $12.5$ and $24$ Mm. The size of\nthe concentrations increases as the box size increases and the largest\nstructures ($20$ Mm horizontally) are obtained in the 24 Mm deep models. The\nfield strength in the concentrations is in the range of $3$-$5$ kG. The\nconcentrations grow approximately linearly in time. The effective magnetic\npressure measured in the simulations is positive near the surface and negative\nin the bulk of the convection zone.

This phenomenon has profound implications for the\ninterpretation of the multifrequency spectra of radiation from supernova\nremnants. Neutrals that undergo charge exchange with hot ions downstream of the\nshock may result in fast neutrals moving towards the upstream gas, where they\ncan suffer additional charge exchange or ionisation reactions, thereby\ndepositing energy and momentum upstream. Here we discuss the implications of\nthis neutral return flux, which was already predicted in our previous work on\nneutral mediated supernova shocks, and show how the spectra of accelerated\nparticles turn out to be appreciably steeper than $p^{-4}$, thereby affecting\nthe gamma ray spectra from supernova remnants in general and from Tycho\nspecifically. The theory that describes non-linear diffusive shock acceleration\nin the presence of neutral hydrogen has been developed in recent years. Here we\nuse a semi-analytical theory developed in previous work and specialise our\npredictions to the case of the Tycho supernova shock, where there is evidence\nthat the spectrum of the accelerated cosmic rays is steeper than expected from\nthe traditional theory of diffusive shock acceleration. We show that, if the\nfraction of neutral hydrogen in the vicinity of the Tycho supernova shock is,\nas suggested by observations, ~70-90, then spectra of accelerated protons\nsteeper than $p^{-4}$ may be a natural consequence of charge exchange reactions\nand the associated neutral return flux.

Method: We use the Hartree-Fock quark-meson\ncoupling model and the proper time regularised three flavour NJL model to\ndescribe hadronic and quark matter, respectively.

In\nthis late stage, a significant amount of ice could have been delivered to 1 AU\nfrom outer regions in the form of mm to dm-sized pebbles. This raises the\nquestion why the present Earth is so depleted of water (with the ocean mass\nbeing as small as 0.023% of the Earth mass). Here we quantify the amount of icy\npebbles accreted by terrestrial embryos after the migration of the snow line\nassuming that no mechanism halts the pebble flow in outer disk regions. We use\na simplified version of the coagulation equation to calculate the formation and\nradial inward drift of icy pebbles in a protoplanetary disk. The pebble\naccretion cross section of an embryo is calculated using analytic expressions\npresented by recent studies. We find that the final mass and water content of\nterrestrial embryos strongly depends on the radial extent of the gas disk, the\nstrength of disk turbulence, and the time at which the snow lines arrives at 1\nAU. The disk's radial extent sets the lifetime of the pebble flow, while\nturbulence determines the density of pebbles at the midplane where the embryos\nreside. We find that the final water content of the embryos falls below 0.023\nwt% only if the disk is compact (< 100 AU), turbulence is strong at 1 AU, and\nthe snow line arrives at 1 AU later than 2-4 Myr after disk formation.

This implies that faint Virgo galaxies are best described as a family\nof thick, nearly oblate spheroids with mean intrinsic axis ratios 1:0.94:0.57.\nWe additionally attempt a study of the intrinsic shapes of Local Group\nsatellites of similar luminosities. For the LG population we infer a slightly\nlarger mean intrinsic ellipticity E=0.51, and the paucity of objects with round\napparent shapes translates into more triaxial mean shapes, 1:0.76:0.49. We\nfinally compare the intrinsic shapes of NGVS low-mass galaxies with samples of\nmore massive quiescent systems, and with field, star-forming galaxies of\nsimilar luminosities. We find that the intrinsic flattening in this\nlow-luminosity regime is almost independent of the environment in which the\ngalaxy resides--but there is a hint that objects may be slightly rounder in\ndenser environments. The comparable flattening distributions of low-luminosity\ngalaxies that have experienced very different degrees of environmental effects\nsuggests that internal processes are the main drivers of galaxy structure at\nlow masses--with external mechanisms playing a secondary role.\n","Comment: Accepted to ApJ. 18 pages, 12 figures"]}]

At low redshift the cosmic SFR density declines smoothly, and\nmassive active galaxies become passive, reducing their star formation activity.\nThis implies that the bulk of the SFR density at low redshift is mainly driven\nby low mass objects. We investigate the properties of a sample of low\nluminosity Far-Infrared (FIR) sources selected at 250 microns from Pappalardo\net al. (2015).

The main goal is to investigate the correlation\nbetween SFR, stellar mass, and dust mass for a galaxy population with a wide\nrange in dust content and stellar mass, including the low mass regime that most\nprobably dominates the SFR density at low z. We define a main sample of ~800\nsources with full Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) coverage between 0.15 <\nlambda < 500 microns and an extended sample with ~5000 sources in which we\nremove the constraints on the Ultraviolet and Near-Infrared bands.

In the\nSFR versus stellar mass plane our samples occupy a region included between\nlocal spirals and higher redshift star forming galaxies. The galaxies subsample\nwith the higher masses (M* > 3e10 Msol) does not lie on the main sequence, but\nshows a small offset, as a consequence of the decreased star formation. Low\nmass galaxies (M* < 1e10 Msol) settle in the main sequence with SFR and stellar\nmass consistent with local spirals. Deep Herschel data allow the identification\nof a mixed galaxy population, with galaxies still in an assembly phase, or\ngalaxies at the beginning of their passive evolution.

They could\nconstitute a new class of pulsating low-mass pre-white dwarf stars. We present\na detailed nonadiabatic pulsation study of such stars, employing full\nevolutionary sequences of low-mass He-core pre-white dwarf models. We have\nconsidered models in which element diffusion is accounted for and also models\nin which it is neglected. We confirm and explore in detail a new instability\nstrip in the domain of low gravities and low effective temperatures of the\n$T_{\\rm eff}-\\log g$ diagram, where low-mass pre-white dwarfs are currently\nfound. The destabilized modes are radial and nonradial $p$ and $g$ modes\nexcited by the $\\kappa-\\gamma$ mechanism acting mainly at the zone of the\nsecond partial ionization of He, with non-negligible contributions from the\nregion of the first partial ionization of He and the partial ionization of H.\nThe computations with element diffusion are unable to explain the pulsations\nobserved in the two known pulsating pre-white dwarfs, suggesting that element\ndiffusion might be inhibited at these stages of the pre-white dwarf evolution.\nOur nonadiabatic models without diffusion, on the other hand, naturally explain\nthe existence and range of periods of the pulsating pre-white dwarf star WASP\nJ1628$+$10B, although they fail to explain the pulsations of WASP J0247$-$25B,\nthe other known member of the class, indicating that the He abundance in the\ndriving region of this star might be substantially larger than predicted by our\nmodels.

The mass-loss mechanism of cool massive evolved stars is poorly\nunderstood. The proximity of Betelgeuse makes it an appealing target to study\nits atmosphere, map the shape of its envelope, and follow the structure of its\nwind from the photosphere out to the interstellar medium. Aims. A link is\nsuspected between the powerful convective motions in Betelgeuse and its mass\nloss. We aim to constrain the spatial structure and temporal evolution of the\nconvective pattern on the photosphere and to search for evidence of this link.\nMethods. We report new interferometric observations in the infrared H band\nusing the VLTI/PIONIER instrument. We monitored the photosphere of Betelgeuse\nbetween 2012 January and 2014 November to look for evolutions that may trigger\nthe outflow. Results. Our interferometric observations at low spatial\nfrequencies are compatible with the presence of a hot spot on the photosphere\nthat has a characteristic width of one stellar radius. It appears to be\nsuperposed on the smaller scale convective pattern. In the higher spatial\nfrequency domain, we observe a significant difference between the observations\nand the predictions of 3D hydrodynamical simulations. Conclusions. We bring new\nevidence for the presence of a convective pattern in the photosphere of red\nsupergiants. The inferred hot spot is probably the top of a giant convection\ncell although an asymmetric extension of the star cannot be excluded by these\ninterferometric observations alone. The properties of the observed surface\nfeatures show a stronger contrast and inhomogeneity as predicted by 3D\nradiative hydrodynamical simulations. We propose that the large observed\nfeature is modifying the signature of the convective pattern at the surface of\nthe star in a way that simulations cannot reproduce.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 4 figures, 2016, A&A, 588, A130"]}]

Based on $JHK$-band\nphotometry and K-band spectroscopy the massive stars are placed in a\nHertzsprung Russell diagram. By comparison with evolutionary models, their age\nand hence the star formation history of W49 can be investigated. Fourteen O\ntype stars as well as two young stellar objects (YSOs) are identified by our\nspectroscopic survey. Eleven O-stars are main sequence stars with subtypes\nranging from O3 to O9.5, with masses ranging from $\\sim 20$ $M_{\\odot}$ to\n$\\sim 120$ $M_{\\odot}$. Three of the O-stars show strong wind features, and are\nconsidered to be Of-type supergiants with masses beyond 100 $M_{\\odot}$ . The\ntwo YSOs show CO emission, indicative for the presence of circumstellar disks\nin the central region of the massive cluster. The age of the cluster is\nestimated as $\\sim1.5$ Myr, with star formation still ongoing in different\nparts of the region. The ionising photons from the central massive stars have\nnot yet cleared the molecular cocoon surrounding the cluster.

Method: The mean-field energy surface of a consistent-Q-like\ntwo-fluid Lipkin Hamiltonian is studied and compared with exact results coming\nfrom a direct diagonalization. The mean-field results are analyzed using the\nframework of catastrophe theory.\n  Results: The phase diagram of the model is obtained and the order of the\ndifferent phase-transition lines and surfaces is determined using a catastrophe\ntheory analysis.\n  Conclusions: There are two first order surfaces in the phase diagram, one\nseparating the spherical and the deformed shapes, while the other separates two\ndifferent deformed phases. A second order line, where the later surfaces merge,\nis found.

Here, we present a detailed study of a nearby\npure-disk dwarf galaxy NGC 2976. Unlike previously observed dwarf objects, this\ngalaxy possesses a clearly defined disk. For the purpose of our studies, we\nperformed deep multi-frequency polarimetric observations of NGC 2976 with the\nVLA and Effelsberg radio telescopes. Additionally, we supplement them with\nre-imaged data from the WSRT-SINGS survey. The magnetic field morphology\ndiscovered in NGC 2976 consists of a southern polarized ridge. This structure\ndoes not seem to be due to just a pure large-scale dynamo process (possibly\ncosmic-ray driven) at work in this object, as indicated by the RM data and\ndynamo number calculations. Instead, the field of NGC 2976 is modified by past\ngravitational interactions and possibly also by ram pressure inside the M 81\ngalaxy group environment. The estimates of total (7 muG) and ordered (3 muG)\nmagnetic field strengths, as well as degree of field order (0.46), which is\nsimilar to those observed in spirals, suggest that tidally generated magnetized\ngas flows can further enhance dynamo action in the object. NGC 2976 is\napparently a good candidate for the efficient magnetization of its\nneighbourhood. It is able to provide an ordered (perhaps also regular) magnetic\nfield into the intergalactic space up to a distance of about 5 kpc. Tidal\ninteractions (and possibly also ram pressure) can lead to the formation of\nunusual magnetic field morphologies (like polarized ridges) in galaxies out of\nthe star-forming disks, which do not follow any observed component of the\ninterstellar medium (ISM), as observed in NGC 2976.

We also verify that the\nanalytical expression of $\\chi_t$ in NL$\\chi$QM satisfy the Witten-Veneziano\n(WV) and the Leutwyler-Smilga (LS) formulae. Once the average instanton size\nand inter-instanton distance are fixed with $\\bar{\\rho}=1/3$ fm and $\\bar{R}=1$\nfm, respectively, all the associated model parameters are all determined\nself-consistently within the model, including the $\\eta$ and $\\eta'$ weak decay\nconstants. We obtain the results such as $F_{\\eta}=96.77$ MeV and\n$F_{\\eta'}=102.53$ MeV for instance. Numerically we observe that\n$\\chi_{t}=(165.57\\,\\mathrm{MeV})^4$ in our full calculation. This value is\ncomparable with its empirical one $\\chi_t=(175\\pm5\\,\\mathrm{MeV})^4$.
