Manifold learning is usually investigated for dimension\nreduction by preserving some expected local geometric structures from the\noriginal space to a low-dimensional one. The structures are generally\ndetermined by using pairwise distance, e.g., Euclidean distance. Alternatively,\nsparse representation denotes a data point as a linear combination of the\npoints from the same subspace. In practical applications, however, the nearby\npoints in terms of pairwise distance may not belong to the same subspace, and\nvice versa. Consequently, it is interesting and important to explore how to get\na better representation by integrating these two models together. To this end,\nthis paper proposes a novel coding algorithm, called Locality-Constrained\nCollaborative Representation (LCCR), which improves the robustness and\ndiscrimination of data representation by introducing a kind of local\nconsistency. The locality term derives from a biologic observation that the\nsimilar inputs have similar code. The objective function of LCCR has an\nanalytical solution, and it does not involve local minima.

Most methods for\nviral diversity estimation proposed so far are intended to take benefit of the\nlonger reads produced by some NGS platforms in order to estimate a population\nof haplotypes. Our goal here is to take advantage of distinct virtues of a\ncertain kind of NGS platform - the platform SOLiD (Life Technologies) is an\nexample - that has not received much attention due to the short length of its\nreads, which renders haplotype estimation very difficult. However, this kind of\nplatform has a very low error rate and extremely deep coverage per site and our\nmethod is designed to take advantage of these characteristics. We propose to\nmeasure the populational genetic diversity through a family of multinomial\nprobability distributions indexed by the sites of the virus genome, each one\nrepresenting the populational distribution of the diversity per site. The\nimplementation of the method focuses on two main optimization strategies: a\nread mapping/alignment procedure that aims at the recovery of the maximum\npossible number of short-reads; the estimation of the multinomial parameters\nthrough a Bayesian approach, which, unlike simple frequency counting, allows\none to take into account the prior information of the control population within\nthe inference of a posterior experimental condition and provides a natural way\nto separate signal from noise, since it automatically furnishes Bayesian\nconfidence intervals.

No credible radio transient candidate has been\ndetected; however, we are able to set upper limits on the surface density of\nradio transient sources at low radio frequencies. We also show that\nlow-frequency radio surveys are more sensitive to steep-spectrum coherent\ntransient sources than GHz radio surveys. We used two new statistical methods\nto determine the upper limits on the transient surface density. One is free of\nassumptions on the flux distribution of the sources, while the other assumes a\npower-law distribution in flux and sets more stringent constraints on the\ntransient surface density. Both of these methods provide better constraints\nthan the approach used in previous works. The best value for the upper limit we\ncan set for the transient surface density, using the method assuming a\npower-law flux distribution, is 1.3$\\cdot$10$^{-3}$ deg$^{-2}$ for transients\nbrighter than 0.3 Jy with a time-scale of 15 min, at a frequency of 150 MHz. We\nalso calculated for the first time upper limits for the transient surface\ndensity for transients of different time-scales. We find that the results can\ndiffer by orders of magnitude from previously reported, simplified estimates.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 6 figures"]}]

Answering this question will not only include understanding\nthe impact of XL-MS data on sampling and scoring within a de novo protein\nstructure prediction algorithm, it must also determine an optimal cross-linker\ntype and length for protein structure determination. While a longer\ncross-linker will yield more restraints, the value of each restraint for\nprotein structure prediction decreases as the restraint is consistent with a\nlarger conformational space.\n  In this study, the number of cross-links and their discriminative power was\nsystematically analyzed in silico on a set of 2,055 non-redundant protein folds\nconsidering Lys-Lys, Lys-Asp, Lys-Glu, Cys-Cys, and Arg-Arg reactive\ncross-linkers between 1 {\\AA} and 60 {\\AA}.

Such objectives most often appear in machine learning in the\nempirical risk minimisation framework in the non-online learning setting. The\nsecond category, that of graph structured objectives, consists of objectives\nthat result from applying maximum likelihood to Markov random field models.\nUnlike the finite sum case, all the non-linearity is contained within a\npartition function term, which does not readily decompose into a summation.\n  For the finite sum problem, we introduce the Finito and SAGA algorithms, as\nwell as variants of each.\n  For graph-structured problems, we take three complementary approaches.

For separations smaller than 10kpc,\ndual and offset active galactic nuclei (AGN) are distinguished: in dual AGN,\nboth nuclei are active, whereas in offset AGN only one nucleus is active. To\nstudy the origin of such AGN pairs, we employ a cosmological, hydrodynamic\nsimulation with a large volume of (182Mpc)^3 from the set of Magneticum\nPathfinder Simulations. The simulation self-consistently produces 35 resolved\nblack hole (BH) pairs at redshift z=2, with a comoving distance smaller than\n10kpc. 14 of them are offset AGN and nine are dual AGN, resulting in a fraction\nof (1.2 \\pm 0.3)% AGN pairs with respect to the total number of AGN. In this\npaper, we discuss fundamental differences between the BH and galaxy properties\nof dual AGN, offset AGN and inactive BH pairs and investigate their different\ntriggering mechanisms. We find that in dual AGN the BHs have similar masses and\nthe corresponding BH from the less massive progenitor galaxy always accretes\nwith a higher Eddington ratio. In contrast, in offset AGN the active BH is\ntypically more massive than its non-active counterpart. Furthermore, dual AGN\nin general accrete more gas from the intergalactic medium than offset AGN and\nnon-active BH pairs.

The achieved\nresolution is almost by a factor of two better with respect to the current\nTOF-PET detectors and it can still be improved since, as it is shown in this\narticle, the intrinsic limit of time resolution for the determination of time\nof the interaction of 0.511 MeV gamma quanta in plastic scintillators is much\nlower. As the major point of the article, a method allowing to record\ntimestamps of several photons, at two ends of the scintillator strip, by means\nof matrix of silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) is introduced. As a result of\nsimulations, conducted with the number of SiPM varying from 4 to 42, it is\nshown that the improvement of timing resolution saturates with the growing\nnumber of photomultipliers, and that the 2 x 5 configuration at two ends\nallowing to read twenty timestamps, constitutes an optimal solution. The\nconducted simulations accounted for the emission time distribution, photon\ntransport and absorption inside the scintillator, as well as quantum efficiency\nand transit time spread of photosensors, and were checked based on the\nexperimental results. Application of the 2 x 5 matrix of SiPM allows for\nachieving the coincidence resolving time in positron emission tomography of\n$\\approx$ 0.170 ns for 15 cm axial field-of-view (AFOV) and $\\approx$ 0.365 ns\nfor 100 cm AFOV.

In the case of live\nstreaming, this task becomes particularly challenging due to the latency\nconstraints. The challenge further increases if a client uses a wireless\nnetwork, where the throughput is subject to considerable fluctuations.\nConsequently, live streams often exhibit latencies of up to 30 seconds.

To reach this\ngoal, LOLYPOP leverages TCP throughput predictions on multiple time scales,\nfrom 1 to 10 seconds, along with an estimate of the prediction error\ndistribution. In addition to satisfying the latency constraint, the algorithm\nheuristically maximizes the quality of experience by maximizing the average\nvideo quality as a function of the number of skipped segments and quality\ntransitions. In order to select an efficient prediction method, we studied the\nperformance of several time series prediction methods in IEEE 802.11 wireless\naccess networks.

These parameters critically depend on the internal balance of heating\nversus cooling, which is mostly determined by the presence of short-lived\nradionuclides (SLRs), such as aluminum-26 and iron-60, as well as the heat\nconductivity of the material. The heating by SLRs depends on their initial\nabundances, the formation time of the planetesimal and its size.

In this study we assess the influence of these\nparameters on the thermo-mechanical evolution of young planetesimals with both\n2D and 3D simulations.

Unfortunately however, it\nis widely reported that the accuracy of standard BEM schemes is limited,\nespecially when the current source density is dipolar and its location\napproaches one of the brain boundary surfaces. This is a particularly limiting\nproblem given that during an high-resolution EEG imaging procedure, several EEG\nforward problem solutions are required for which the source currents are near\nor on top of a boundary surface.\n  This work will first present an analysis of standardly discretized EEG\nforward problems, reporting on a theoretical issue of some of the formulations\nthat have been used so far in the community. We report on the fact that several\nstandardly used discretizations requires the expansion term to be a square\nintegrable function. Instead, those techniques are not consistent when a more\nappropriate mapping is considered. Such a mapping allows the expansion function\nterm to be a less regular function, thus sensibly reducing the need for mesh\nrefinements and low-precisions handling strategies that are currently required.\nThese mappings, however, require a different and conforming discretization\nwhich must be suitably adapted to them. To do this we adopt a mixed\ndiscretization based on dual boundary elements residing on a suitably defined\ndual mesh.

After calibration of the surface acoustic wave device\nsensitivity by copper electrodeposition, the bound mass and its physical\nproperties -- density and optical index -- are extracted from the complementary\nmeasurement techniques and lead to thickness and water ratio values compatible\nwith the observed signal shifts. Such results are especially usefully for\nprotein layers with a high water content as shown here for collagen on an\nhydrophobic surface. We obtain the following results: collagen layers include\n70+/-20 % water and are 16+/-3 to 19+/-3 nm thick for bulk concentrations\nranging from 30 to 300 ug/ml. Fibrinogen layers include 50+/-10 % water for\nlayer thicknesses in the 6+/-1.5 to 13+/-2 nm range when the bulk concentration\nis in the 46 to 460 ug/ml range.\n","Comment: 50 pages, 8 figures, 1 table"]}]
