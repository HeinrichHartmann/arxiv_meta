Using the solution of an HJB\nequation, a feedback optimal control law can be implemented in real-time with\nminimum computational load. However, except for systems with two or three state\nvariables, using traditional techniques for numerically finding a semi-global\nsolution to an HJB equation for general nonlinear systems is infeasible due to\nthe curse of dimensionality. Here we present a new computational method for\nfinding feedback optimal control and solving HJB equations which is able to\nmitigate the curse of dimensionality. We do not discretize the HJB equation\ndirectly, instead we introduce a sparse grid in the state space and use the\nPontryagin's maximum principle to derive a set of necessary conditions in the\nform of a boundary value problem, also known as the characteristic equations,\nfor each grid point. Using this approach, the method is spatially causality\nfree, which enjoys the advantage of perfect parallelism on a sparse grid.\nCompared with dense grids, a sparse grid has a significantly reduced size which\nis feasible for systems with relatively high dimensions, such as the $6$-D\nsystem shown in the examples. Once the solution obtained at each grid point,\nhigh-order accurate polynomial interpolation is used to approximate the\nfeedback control at arbitrary points. We prove an upper bound for the\napproximation error and approximate it numerically.

In\nparticular, we consider the Hardy space of functions that are analytic in a\nstrip region around the real axis, being characterized by a weight function $w$\nthat determines the decay rate of its elements in the neighborhood of infinity.\nSuch a space is considered as a set of functions that are transformed by\nvariable transformations that realize a certain decay rate at infinity. Popular\nexamples of such transformations are given by the single exponential (SE) and\ndouble exponential (DE) transformations for the SE-Sinc and DE-Sinc formulas,\nwhich are very accurate owing to the accuracy of sinc interpolation in the\nweighted Hardy spaces with single and double exponential weights $w$,\nrespectively. However, it is not guaranteed that the sinc formulas are optimal\nin weighted Hardy spaces, although Sugihara has demonstrated that they are near\noptimal. An explicit form for an optimal approximation formula has only been\ngiven in weighted Hardy spaces with SE weights of a certain type. In general\ncases, explicit forms for optimal formulas have not been provided so far. We\nadopt a potential theoretic approach to obtain almost optimal formulas in\nweighted Hardy spaces in the case of general weight functions $w$. We formulate\nthe problem of designing an optimal formula in each space as an optimization\nproblem written in terms of a Green potential with an external field. By\nsolving the optimization problem numerically, we obtain an almost optimal\nformula in each space. Furthermore, some numerical results demonstrate the\nvalidity of this method. In particular, for the case of a DE weight, the\nformula designed by our method outperforms the DE-Sinc formula.\n","Comment: 40 pages, 15 figures, Matlab codes for this article are available on\n  https://github.com/KeTanakaN/mat_pot_approx"]}]

The\nrole of ensemble averaging is further explored in realistic distributions of\nnoble-metal NPs, as encountered in experiments, while an analytical expression\nto evaluate the importance of inhomogeneous broadening through measurable\nquantities is developed. Our findings are independent of the specific\nnonclassical theory used, thus providing important insight into a large range\nof experiments on nanoscale and quantum plasmonics.\n"]}]

The black hole binary SWIFT J1753.5-0127 is providing a unique data set\nto study accretion flows. Various investigations of this system and of other\nblack holes have not, however, led to an agreement on the accretion flow\ngeometry or on the seed photon source for Comptonization during different\nstages of X-ray outbursts. We place constraints on these accretion flow\nproperties by studying long-term spectral variations of this source. Methods.\nWe performed phenomenological and self-consistent broad band spectral modeling\nof Swift J1753.5-0127 using quasi-simultaneous archived data from\nINTEGRAL/ISGRI, Swift/UVOT/XRT/BAT, RXTE/PCA/HEXTE and MAXI/GSC instruments.\nResults. We identify a critical flux limit, F \\sim 1.5 \\times 10^{-8}\nerg/cm^2/s, and show that the spectral properties of SWIFT J1753.5-0127 are\nmarkedly different above and below this value. Above the limit, during the\noutburst peak, the hot medium seems to intercept roughly 50 percent of the disk\nemission. Below it, in the outburst tail, the contribution of the disk photons\nreduces significantly and the entire spectrum from the optical to X-rays can be\nproduced by a synchrotron-self-Compton mechanism. The long-term variations in\nthe hard X-ray spectra are caused by erratic changes of the electron\ntemperatures in the hot medium. Thermal Comptonization models indicate\nunreasonably low hot medium optical depths during the short incursions into the\nsoft state after 2010, suggesting that non-thermal electrons produce the\nComptonized tail in this state. The soft X-ray excess, likely produced by the\naccretion disk, shows peculiarly stable temperatures for over an order of\nmagnitude changes in flux. Conclusions. The long-term spectral trends of SWIFT\nJ1753.5-0127 are likely set by variations of the truncation radius and a\nformation of a hot, quasi-spherical inner flow in the vicinity of the black\nhole.

The objective is to synthesize and analysis the performance and\ncapability of the mentioned methods for guiding an AUV from loitering point\ntoward the rendezvous place through a comprehensive simulation study.The\nproposed planner module entails a heuristic for refining the path considering\nsituational awareness of underlying environment, encompassing static and\ndynamic obstacles overwhelmed in spatiotemporal current vectors.This leads to\naccommodate the unforeseen changes in the operating field like emergence of\nunpredicted obstacles or variability of current vector filed and turbulent\nregions. The simulation results demonstrate the inherent robustness and\nsignificant efficiency of the proposed planner in enhancement of the vehicle's\nautonomy in terms of using current force, coping undesired current disturbance\nfor the desired rendezvous purpose. Advantages and shortcoming of all utilized\nmethods are also presented based on the obtained results.\n"]}]

We formulate the problem as a combinatorial\noptimization problem and show via simulations that our proposed distributed\nalgorithms yield a comparable spectral efficiency for the entire networks as\nthat using an exhaustive search, which requires global coordination among\ncoexisting RATs and also has a much higher algorithmic complexity.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 8 figures, accepted by PIMRC 2016"]}]

The preferred spin\norientation (i.e., the magnetic anisotropy) of a magnetic ion is not predicted\nby a spin Hamiltonian because it does not include the orbital degree of freedom\nexplicitly. In contrast, the magnetic anisotropy is readily predicted by\nelectronic structure theories employing both orbital and spin degrees of\nfreedom, if one takes into consideration the spin-orbit coupling (SOC). It was\nshown that the preferred spin orientation of a magnetic ion can be predicted\nand understood in terms of the HOMO-LUMO interactions of the magnetic ion by\ntaking SOC as perturbation. A spin Hamiltonian gives rise to the spin-half\nmisconception, namely, the blind belief that spin-half magnetic ions do not\npossess magnetic anisotropy that arise from SOC. This misconception is a direct\nconsequence from the limitedness of a spin Hamiltonian that it lacks the\norbital degree of freedom.
