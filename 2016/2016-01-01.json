We\nassert that a seller switches her state in order to maximize her profit, and\nfurther that this switch can be identified through the seller's reputation.

It has been recently established\nthat joint design of content delivery and storage (coded caching) can\nsignificantly improve performance over conventional caching. Coded caching is\nwell suited to emerging heterogeneous wireless architectures which consist of a\ndense deployment of local-coverage wireless access points (APs) with high data\nrates, along with sparsely-distributed, large-coverage macro-cell base stations\n(BS). This enables design of coded caching-and-delivery schemes that equip APs\nwith storage, and place content in them in a way that creates coded-multicast\nopportunities for combining with macro-cell broadcast to satisfy users even\nwith different demands.

The common assumption is that the probe collects\nthe random flux of electrons incident on the sheath, which tacitly implies that\nthere is no electron presheath and that the flux collected is due to a velocity\nspace truncation of the electron velocity distribution function (EVDF). This\nwork provides a dedicated theory of electron sheaths, which suggests that they\nare not so simple. Motivated by EVDFs observed in Particle-In-Cell (PIC)\nsimulations, a 1D model for the electron sheath and presheath is developed. In\nthe model, under low temperature plasma conditions ($T_e\\gg T_i$), an electron\npressure gradient accelerates electrons in the presheath to a flow velocity\nthat exceeds the electron thermal speed at the sheath edge. This pressure\ngradient generates large flow velocities compared to what would be generated by\nballistic motion in response to the electric field. It is found that in many\nsituations, under common plasma conditions, the electron presheath extends much\nfurther into the plasma than an analogous ion presheath. PIC simulations reveal\nthat the ion density in the electron presheath is determined by a flow around\nthe electron sheath and that this flow is due to 2D aspects of the sheath\ngeometry. Simulations also indicate the presence of ion acoustic waves excited\nby the differential flow between electrons and ions in the presheath which\nresult in sheath edge fluctuations.

Each selective oxidation cycle involves\nfour general steps: (a) a peroxo or weakly adsorbed O2 group releases an O atom\nto substrate to form substrate oxide and an oxo group, (b) an oxygen molecule\nadds to the oxo group to generate an eta2-ozone group, (c) the eta2-ozone group\nrearranges to form an eta3-ozone group, and (d) the eta3-ozone group releases\nan O atom to substrate to form substrate oxide and regenerate the peroxo or\nweakly adsorbed O2 group. This catalyst could potentially be synthesized via\nthe condensation reaction Zr(N(R)R')4 + 2\nC6H4-1,6-(N(C6H3-2',6'-(CH(CH3)2)2)OH)2 -->\nZr(C6H4-1,6-(N(C6H3-2',6'-(CH(CH3)2)2)O)2)2 [aka Zr_Benzol catalyst] + 4\nN(R)(R')H where R and R' are CH3, CH2CH3, or other alkyl groups. For direct\nethylene epoxidation, the computed enthalpic energetic span (i.e., effective\nactivation energy for the entire catalytic cycle) is 27.1 kcal/mol, which is\none of the lowest values for catalysts studied to date. We study reaction\nmechanisms and the stability of different catalyst forms as a function of the\noxygen atom chemical potential. Notably, an aromatic linkage in each ligand\nprevents this catalyst from deactivating to form an inactive octahedral-like\nstructure that contains the same atoms as the dioxo complex, Zr(Ligand)2(O)2.\nDue to a side reaction that can transfer an allylic H atom from alkene to\ncatalyst, this catalyst is useful for directly epoxidizing alkenes such as\nethylene that do not contain allylic H atoms. To better understand the reaction\nchemistry, we computed net atomic charges and bond orders for the two\ncatalytically relevant reaction cycles.
