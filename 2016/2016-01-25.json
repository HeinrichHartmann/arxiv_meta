This formula\ntypically yields a velocity very close to the speed of light (for instance, v/c\n> 0.97 for X-shaped microwaves), which raises some doubts about the real\nphysical observability of the violations. We then compute the velocity\nrequirement introducing a delay between the reception of the primary signal and\nthe emission of the secondary. It turns out that in principle for any delay it\nis possible to find moving observers able to produce active causal violation.\nThis is mathematically due to the singularity of the Lorentz transformations\nfor beta to 1. For a realistic delay due to the propagation of a luminal\nprecursor, we find that causality violations in the reported experiments are\nstill more unlikely (v/c > 0.989), and even in the hypothesis that the\nsuperluminal propagation velocity goes to infinity, the velocity requirement is\nbounded by v/c > 0.62. We also prove that if two macroscopic bodies exchange\nenergy and momentum through superluminal signals, then the swap of signal\nsource and target is incompatible with the Lorentz transformations; therefore\nit is not possible to distinguish between source and target, even with\nreference to a definite reference frame.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 6 figures.

The string\nsolution is then adapted to give the radiation field of a transversal Alfven\nwave in a rarefied plasma, where the tension is produced by an external static\nmagnetic field. Like for the string, the field strength turns out to be\nindependent from the frequency. We give a preliminary example of a numerical\nsolution based on parameters referred to Alfven waves in the solar corona.\nFurther astrophysical applications require an extension of the solution\nprocedure to second order in the amplitude, and consideration of border\neffects. Future work will also address numerical and analytical near-field\nsolutions.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 4 figures.

Due to this nature, crowdsourcers (or\ntask requesters) often face uncertainty about the workers' capabilities which,\nin turn, affects the quality and timeliness of the results obtained. Trust is a\nmechanism used by people to facilitate interactions in human societies where\nrisk and uncertain are common. The crucial challenge to building a robust\ncrowdsourcing system is how to make trust-aware task delegation decisions to\nefficiently utilize the capacities of workers (or trustee agents) to achieve\nhigh social welfare?\n  This book presents the research addressing this challenge. It goes beyond the\nexisting trust management research framework by removing a widespread\nassumption implicitly adopted by existing research: that a trustee agent can\nprocess an unlimited number of interaction requests per discrete time unit\nwithout compromising its performance as perceived by the task requesters (or\ntruster agents). Decision support in crowdsourcing is re-formalized as a\nmulti-agent trust game based on the principles of the Congestion Game, which is\nsolved by two trust-aware interaction decision-making approaches: 1) the Social\nWelfare Optimizing approach for Reputation-aware Decision-making (SWORD)\napproach, and 2) the Distributed Request Acceptance approach for Fair\nutilization of Trustee agents (DRAFT). SWORD is designed for centralized\nsystems, while DRAFT is designed for fully distributed systems. Theoretical\nanalyses have shown that the social welfare produced by these two approaches\ncan be made closer to optimal by adjusting only one key parameter.

The basic idea is to apply the method of\nnumerical continuation to a feedback-controlled physical experiment. Since in\nan experiment it is not (generally) possible to set the state of the system\ndirectly, the control target is used as a proxy for the state. The challenge\nthen becomes to determine a control target such that the control is\nnon-invasive, that is, it stabilises a steady-state (or periodic orbit) of the\noriginal open-loop experiment without altering it otherwise.\n  Once implemented, control-based continuation enables the systematic\ninvestigation of the bifurcation structure of a physical system, much like if\nit was numerical model. However, stability information (and hence bifurcation\ndetection and classification) is not readily available due to the presence of\nstabilising feedback control. This paper uses methods from the system\nidentification community to extract stability information in the form of\nFloquet multipliers from the closed-loop experiment, thus enabling the direct\ndetection of bifurcations. In particular, it is shown that a periodic\nauto-regressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX) can be constructed that\napproximates the time-varying linearisation of the experiment around a\nparticular periodic orbit.

We argue that, for carrier\nconcentrations exceeding that of the mobility edge, the superconductivity of\ndoped SrTiO3 is mediated by interaction of electrons with several longitudinal\n(LO) optical polar phonons. The electronic spectrum of SrTiO3 consists at low\ntemperatures of three conduction bands which are successively doped. Each band\ncontributes to the Cooper instability and exhibits a superconducting gap in the\nenergy spectrum. The theory presented below predicts maxima in dependence of\nTc(n)-the transition temperature on n, the number of electrons owing to the\nfollowing mechanism. Doping by electrons increases density of states at the\nFermi surface and Tc initially grows up. At the same time, screening on the\npart of accumulating charges tends to reduce amplitude of the electrical fields\ninherent in LO phonon modes and at larger concentrations the matrix element of\ninteraction between electrons and LO phonons decreases. The compromise between\nthe two tendencies leads to maxima in the Tc(n)-dependence providing\ninterpretation to one of the most intriguing experimental findings in Xiao Lin\net al [Phys. Rev.

Having reached a maximum in the\nthird band, the superconducting transition finally decreases, rounding out the\nTc(n)-dome, the three maxima in Tc(n)with accompanying superconducting gaps\nemerging consecutively as electrons fill successive bands.

Here, we describe an alternative approach to\nstudying structure in networks that relies on an algebraic-topological metric\ncalled persistent homology, which studies intrinsically mesoscale structures\ncalled cycles, constructed from cliques in the network. We present a\nclassification of 14 commonly studied weighted network models into four groups\nor classes, and discuss the structural themes arising in each class. Finally,\nwe compute the persistent homology of two real-world networks and one network\nconstructed by a common dynamical systems model, and we compare the results\nwith the three classes to obtain a better understanding of those networks.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 8 figures"]}]

Shift-invariant spaces also play an important\nrole in sampling theory, multiresolution analysis, and many other areas of\nsignal and image processing. Shannon's sampling theorem, which is at the heart\nof modern digital communications, is a special case of sampling in\nshift-invariant spaces. Furthermore, it is well known that the Poisson\nsummation formula is equivalent to the sampling theorem and that the Zak\ntransform is closely connected to the sampling theorem and the Poisson\nsummation formula. These results have been known to hold in the Fourier\ntransform domain for decades and were recently shown to hold in the Fractional\nFourier transform domain by A. Bhandari and A.

We provide a short, self-contained proof of Shannon's theorem\nfor functions bandlimited in the SAFT domain and then show that sampling in the\nSAFT domain is equivalent to orthogonal projection of functions onto a subspace\nof bandlimited basis associated with the SAFT domain. This interpretation of\nsampling leads to least-squares optimal sampling theorem.

In this talk we will present new tests of NRQCD\ninvolving the distribution of quarkonia within jets. The distribution of\nhadrons within jets is determined by nonperturbative functions called\nfragmenting jet functions (FJFs). FJFs are convolutions of fragmentation\nfunctions, evolved to the jet energy scale, with perturbatively calculable\nmatching coefficients. I show how the FJFs for quarkonia can be calculated in\nNRQCD in terms of a few NRQCD long-distance matrix elements (LDME), so the\ndependence of the cross section on the energy fraction of the heavy quarkonium,\nz, is sensitive to the underlying production mechanism, and therefore provides\na new test of NRQCD.

The model,\nwhich is supported by the experiments, is based on a partial Hall voltage\ncompensation effect, occurring because hopping carriers respond to the\ntransverse Hall electric field and drift in the direction opposite to the\nLorentz force acting on band carriers. We show that this can lead in particular\nto an underdeveloped Hall effect observed in organic semiconductors with\nsubstantial off-diagonal thermal disorder. Our model explains the main features\nof Hall effect in a variety of organic semiconductors and provides an\nanalytical description of Hall mobility, carrier density and carrier coherence\nfactor.\n","Comment: Submitted to Scientific Reports 01/13/2016"]}]

The as-cast structures do not contain any\nlocal chemical order, but the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy\n(HRTEM) studies reveal their locally distorted lattice. The local lattice\ndistortion of the average structure in their as-cast and annealed state is\nquantified by refining atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) from\nsingle-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) and powder neutron diffraction (ND)\nstudies. The static component of the ADPs appears to dominate over the thermal\nADP, suggesting a high degree of local lattice distortion in the HEAs. The\nlattice distortions cause solid-solution like strengthening, which increases\nthe hardness of the HEAs by a factor of 2-3 compared to the rule of mixture.\nThe SRCs that form in the annealed HEAs have a planar profile perpendicular to\nthe <1 0 0> directions.

The\nSRCs have a higher atomic volume causing local tetragonal lattice distortions,\nwhich in terms produce diffuse streak-like intensities in the XRD datasets and\nin the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the HRTEM lattice images. The presence\nof SRCs locally reduces the lattice potential energy of the structure and puts\nadditional energy barrier to the movement of dislocations.

Because the fidelity of a\nprotectively measured quantum state is determined by the amount of state\ndisturbance incurred during each protective measurement, it is crucial that the\ninitial quantum state of the system is disturbed as little as possible.
