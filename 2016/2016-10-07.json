The stability of the system depending on parameters of the involved\ninteratomic interactions is analyzed. It is demonstrated that different\nscenarios of the nanotube dynamics atop the nanoparticle are possible depending\non the parameters of the Ni-C potential. When the interaction is weak the\nnanotube is stable and resembles its highly symmetric structure, while an\nincrease of the interaction energy leads to the abrupt collapse of the nanotube\nin the initial stage of simulation. In order to validate the parameters of the\nNi-C interaction utilized in the simulations, DFT calculations of the potential\nenergy surface for carbon-nickel compounds are performed.

The dimensionality effects of\nthe blackbody radiation has been the subject of considerable research activity\nin recent years.

In this work we carry out an information-theoretical\nanalysis of the spectral energy density of a d-dimensional blackbody at\ntemperature T by means of various entropy-like quantities (disequilibrium,\nShannon entropy, Fisher information) as well as by three (dimensionless)\ncomplexity measures (Cr\\'amer-Rao, Fisher-Shannon and LMC).

It is shown that all three measures of\ncomplexity have an universal character in the sense that they depend neither on\ntemperature nor on the Planck and Boltzmann constants, but only on the the\nspace dimensionality d. Moreover, they decrease when d is increasing; in\nparticular, the values 2.28415, 1.90979 and 1.17685 are found for the\nCr\\'amer-Rao, Fisher-Shannon and LMC measures of complexity of the\n3-dimensional blackbody radiation, respectively.

We cover model-independent\ndiversification preferences, preferences within models of choice under risk,\nincluding expected utility theory and the more general rank-dependent expected\nutility theory, as well as models of choice under uncertainty axiomatized via\nChoquet expected utility theory. Remarks on interpretations of diversification\npreferences within models of behavioral choice are given in the conclusion.\n"]}]

The size PDF is\nnarrower, and evolves more slowly with time, than predicted. It becomes more\nsharply peaked as reionization progresses.

One common method to\ncalculate the space plasma parameters is by fitting the observed distributions\nusing known analytical forms. More often, the distribution function is included\nin a forward model of the instrument's response, which is used to reproduce the\nobserved energy spectrograms for a given set of plasma parameters. In both\ncases, the modeled plasma distribution fits the measurements to estimate the\nplasma parameters. The distribution function is often considered to be\nMaxwellian even though in many cases the plasma is better described by a kappa\ndistribution. In this work we show that if the plasma is described by a kappa\ndistribution, the derived temperature assuming Maxwell distribution can be\nsignificantly off. More specifically, we derive the plasma temperature by\nfitting a Maxwell distribution to pseudo-data produced by a kappa distribution,\nand then examine the difference of the derived temperature as a function of the\nkappa index. We further consider the concept of using a forward model of a\ntypical plasma instrument to fit its observations. We find that the relative\nerror of the derived temperature is highly depended on the kappa index and\noccasionally on the instrument's field of view and response.\n","Comment: 7 Figures and 19 pages The article is currently in press by\n  \"Astrophysics and Space Science\" journal The articles number is\n  ASTR-D-16-00131R4"]}]

Big\ndata contains huge values, however, mining knowledge from big data is a\ntremendously challenging task because of data uncertainty and inconsistency.\nAttribute reduction (also known as feature selection) can not only be used as\nan effective preprocessing step, but also exploits the data redundancy to\nreduce the uncertainty. However, existing solutions are designed 1) either for\na single machine that means the entire data must fit in the main memory and the\nparallelism is limited; 2) or for the Hadoop platform which means that the data\nhave to be loaded into the distributed memory frequently and therefore become\ninefficient. In this paper, we overcome these shortcomings for maximum\nefficiency possible, and propose a unified framework for Parallel Large-scale\nAttribute Reduction, termed PLAR, for big data analysis. PLAR consists of three\ncomponents: 1) Granular Computing (GrC)-based initialization: it converts a\ndecision table (i.e., original data representation) into a granularity\nrepresentation which reduces the amount of space and hence can be easily cached\nin the distributed memory: 2) model-parallelism: it simultaneously evaluates\nall feature candidates and makes attribute reduction highly parallelizable; 3)\ndata-parallelism: it computes the significance of an attribute in parallel\nusing a MapReduce-style manner. We implement PLAR with four representative\nheuristic feature selection algorithms on Spark, and evaluate them on various\nhuge datasets, including UCI and astronomical datasets, finding our method's\nadvantages beyond existing solutions.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 10 figures"]}]

In addition, the\nmedical text mining poses more challenges, e.g., more unstructured text, the\nfast growing of new terms addition, a wide range of name variation for the same\ndrug. The mining is even more challenging due to the lack of labeled dataset\nsources and external knowledge, as well as multiple token representations for a\nsingle drug name that is more common in the real application setting. Although\nmany approaches have been proposed to overwhelm the task, some problems\nremained with poor F-score performance (less than 0.75).

The first technique is evaluated with the standard NN\nmodel, i.e., MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptrons). The second technique involves two\ndeep network classifiers, i.e., DBN (Deep Belief Networks), and SAE (Stacked\nDenoising Encoders). The third technique represents the sentence as a sequence\nthat is evaluated with a recurrent NN model, i.e., LSTM (Long Short Term\nMemory).

This phase map enables interpretation of\nhigh-throughput band gap data, leading to the discovery of new solar light\nabsorbers and the alloying-based tuning of the direct-allowed band-gap energy\nof MnV2O6. The open-source family of AgileFD algorithms can be implemented into\na broad range of high throughput workflows to accelerate materials discovery.\n"]}]

Through this experience, we have come to\nappreciate that typical Weyl semimetals host many Weyl points. For instance,\nthe first Weyl semimetal observed in experiment, TaAs, hosts 24 Weyl points.\nSimilarly, the Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$ series, recently under study as the first\nType II Weyl semimetal, has eight Weyl points. However, it is well-understood\nthat for a Weyl semimetal without inversion symmetry but with time-reversal\nsymmetry, the minimum number of Weyl points is four. Realizing such a minimal\nWeyl semimetal is fundamentally relevant because it would offer the simplest\n\"hydrogen atom\" example of an inversion-breaking Weyl semimetal. At the same\ntime, transport experiments and device applications may be simpler in a system\nwith as few Weyl points as possible. Recently, TaIrTe$_4$ has been predicted to\nbe a minimal, inversion-breaking Weyl semimetal. However, crucially, the Weyl\npoints and Fermi arcs live entirely above the Fermi level, making them\ninaccessible to conventional angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES).\nHere we use pump-probe ARPES to directly access the band structure above the\nFermi level in TaIrTe$_4$. We directly observe Weyl points and topological\nFermi arcs, showing that TaIrTe$_4$ is a Weyl semimetal. We find that, in\ntotal, TaIrTe$_4$ has four Weyl points, providing the first example of a\nminimal inversion-breaking Weyl semimetal.
