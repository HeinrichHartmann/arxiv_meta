This research seeks to fill this gap by\nexploring local search on a network representation of proteins and to probe the\nsource of navigability in proteins. Previously, we confirmed that proteins are\nnavigable small-world networks and observed that local search paths exhibit\ndifferent characteristics from global search paths. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the biological relevance of the differences in path characteristics\non a type III receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT). A chief difference that works in\nfavour of local search paths as intra-protein communication pathways is their\nweaker proclivity, compared to global search paths, for traversing long-range\nedges. Long-range edges tend to be less stable and their inclusion tends to\ndecrease the communication propensity of a path. The source of protein\nnavigability is traced to clustering provided by short-range edges. The\nmajority of a protein's short-range edges reside within structures deemed\nimportant for long-range energy transport and modulation of allosteric\ncommunication in proteins. Therefore, the disruption of intra-protein\ncommunication as a result of the destruction of these structures via random\nrewiring is expected. A local search perspective leads us to this expected\nconclusion while a global search perspective does not.

The absolute and normalized\ndifferential cross sections for t t-bar production are measured as a function\nof the jet multiplicity in the event for different jet transverse momentum\nthresholds and the kinematic properties of the leading additional jets. The\ndifferential t t-bar b and t t-bar b b-bar cross sections are presented for the\nfirst time as a function of the kinematic properties of the leading additional\nb jets.

We extend Smith's model to these\nmax-stable velocity processes and obtain the distribution of waiting times\nbetween extreme events at multiple locations. Motivated by this result, a new\ncharacterization of tail dependence is proposed that is a function of the\ndistribution of waiting times between threshold exceedances, and an inferential\nframework is constructed for quantifying the strength of extremal dependence\nand assessing uncertainty in this paradigm.

Data scaling is a relatively recent\napproach, proposed in the database community, that allows for quickly scaling\nup an input data instance to s times its size, while preserving certain\napplication-specific characteristics. The advantage of the approach is that the\nuser is not required to manually input the characteristics of the data to be\nproduced, making it particularly suitable for OBDA benchmarks, where the\ncomplexity of database schemas might pose a challenge for manual input (e.g.,\nthe NPD benchmark contains 70 tables with some containing more than 60\ncolumns). As opposed to a traditional data scaler, VIG includes domain\ninformation provided by the OBDA mappings and the ontology in order to produce\ndata. VIG is currently used in the NPD benchmark, but it is not NPD-specific\nand can be seeded with any data instance. The distinguishing features of VIG\nare (1) its simple and clear generation strategy; (2) its efficiency, as each\nvalue is generated in constant time, without accesses to the disk or to RAM to\nretrieve previously generated values; (3) and its generality, as the data is\nexported in CSV files that can be easily imported by any RDBMS system.

Due to the degrees of invariance of surfaces and that\nof freedom of joints, these operand polytopes are originally unbounded in most\nof the cases (i.e. polyhedra). Homri et al. proposed the introduction of\nvirtual boundaries (called cap half-spaces) over the unbounded displacements of\neach polyhedron to turn them into 6-polytopes. This decision was motivated by\nthe complexity that operating on polyhedra in R6 supposes. However, that\nstrategy has to face the multiplication of the number of cap half-spaces during\nthe computation of Minkowski sums. In general, the time for computing cap\nfacets is greater than for computing facets representing real limits of bounded\ndisplacements. In order to deal with that, this paper proposes the use of the\ntheory of screws to determine the set of displacements that defines the\npositioning of one surface in relation to another. This set of displacements\ndefines the subspace of R6 in which the polytopes of the respective surfaces\nhave to be projected and operated to avoid calculating facets and vertices\nalong the directions of unbounded displacements. With this new strategy it is\npossible to decrease the complexity of the Minkowski sums by reducing the\ndimension of the operands and consequently reducing the computation time.

The problem,\nin general, is notoriously intractable, and finding the global optimal solution\nis known to be NP-hard. However, is it possible to approximate this problem\nwith a reasonable ratio bound on the solution quality in polynomial time? We\nshow in this paper that the answer is no. Specifically, we show that general\nenergy minimization, even in the 2-label pairwise case, and planar energy\nminimization with three or more labels are exp-APX-complete. This finding rules\nout the existence of any approximation algorithm with a sub-exponential\napproximation ratio in the input size for these two problems, including\nconstant factor approximations. Moreover, we collect and review the\ncomputational complexity of several subclass problems and arrange them on a\ncomplexity scale consisting of three major complexity classes -- PO, APX, and\nexp-APX, corresponding to problems that are solvable, approximable, and\ninapproximable in polynomial time.
