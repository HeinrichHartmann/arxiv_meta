The formalism is valid for all types of charged\nparticles and due to its closed nature is suited to provide fast conversion of\ndose to DNA-damage. Methods: The induction of double strand breaks in\nDNA--strings residing in irradiated cells is quantified using a single particle\nmodel. This leads to a proposal to use the cumulative Cauchy distribution to\nexpress the mix of high and low LET type damage probability generated by a\nsingle particle. A microscopic phenomenological Monte Carlo code is used to fit\nthe parameters of the model as a function of kinetic energy related to the\ndamage to a DNA molecule embedded in a cell.

A geometric\ninterpretation of this observation using the impact ionization mean free path\nas a quantifier, allows extension of the model to very low energies. Results:\nThe mathematical expression describes the model adequately using a chi--square\ntest ($\\chi^2/NDF < 1$).

It is quite well known\nfrom the \"No-Broadcasting theorem\" that perfect broadcasting of quantum\ncorrelation is not possible. However it does not rule out the possibility of\npartial broadcasting of correlations where we can get lesser correlated states\nfrom a given correlated state. In order to have a holistic view of\nbroadcasting, we investigate this problem by starting with most general\nrepresentation of two qubit mixed states in terms of the Bloch vectors. As a\ncloning transformation we have used universal symmetric optimal Buzek-Hillery\n(B-H) cloner both locally and nonlocally. More specifically, we obtain a set of\nranges in terms of Bloch vectors for which broadcasting of entanglement will be\npossible. In addition to the idea of broadcasting of entanglement for general\ntwo qubit mixed states, we explore broadcasting of quantum correlations that go\nbeyond entanglement with the help of both local and nonlocal cloners.\nRemarkably, we find that it is impossible to even partially broadcast such\ncorrelations by using both local and nonlocal quantum copying machines. Taking\ntwo different types Buzek-Hillery quantum cloners (state dependent and state\nindependent) we analytically prove the impossibility of even partial\nbroadcasting of correlation.

Direct\nnumerical simulations (DNS) of convection driven dynamos offer one way of\nexamining the mechanisms behind these events. In this work, we analyze a\nsolution of a solar-like DNS that has been evolved for roughly 80 magnetic\ncycles of 4.9 years, during which epochs of irregular behavior are detected.\nThe emphasis of our analysis is to find physical causes for such behavior. The\nDNS employed is a semi-global (wedge) magnetoconvection model. For data\nanalysis we use Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and phase\ndispersion ($D^2$) methods. A special property of the DNS is the existence of\nmultiple dynamo modes at different depths and latitudes. The dominant mode is\nsolar-like. This mode is accompanied by a higher frequency mode near the\nsurface and a low-frequency mode in the bottom of the convection zone. The\noverall behavior of the dynamo solution is very complex exhibiting variable\ncycle lengths, epochs of disturbed and even ceased surface activity, and strong\nshort-term hemispherical asymmetries. Surprisingly, the most prominent\nsuppressed surface activity epoch is actually a global magnetic energy maximum.\nWe interpret the overall irregular behavior to be due to the interplay of the\ndifferent dynamo modes showing different equatorial symmetries, especially the\nsmoother part of the irregular variations being related to the variations of\nthe mode strengths, evolving with different and variable cycle lengths. The\nabrupt low activity epoch in the dominant dynamo mode near the surface is\nrelated to a strong maximum of the bottom toroidal field strength, which causes\nabrupt disturbances especially in the differential rotation profile via the\nsuppression of the Reynolds stresses.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 16 figures, Astronomy and Astrophysics, accepted for\n  publication"]}]

Our work also naturally leads to a well-defined platform for\nuniversal fault-tolerant quantum computation using Majorana zero modes, which\nwe describe.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 13 figures; Title and references updated"]}]

We use the CANDELS\nnear-IR imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope to perform the bulge-to-disk\ndecomposition of distant galaxies and measure for the first time the slope of\nthe SFR-Mdisk relation at z=1. We find that this relation follows very closely\nthe shape of the SFR-M* correlation, still with a pronounced flattening at the\nhigh-mass end. This is clearly excluding, at least at z=1, the secular growth\nof quiescent bulges in star-forming galaxies as the main driver for the change\nof slope of the Main Sequence. Then, by stacking the Herschel data available in\nthe CANDELS field, we estimate the total gas mass and the star formation\nefficiency at different positions on the SFR-M* relation.

Bitrate adaptation requires a tradeoff between\nreducing the probability that the video freezes and enhancing the quality of\nthe video shown to the user. A bitrate that is too high leads to frequent video\nfreezes (i.e., rebuffering), while a bitrate that is too low leads to poor\nvideo quality. Video providers segment the video into short chunks and encode\neach chunk at multiple bitrates. The video player adaptively chooses the\nbitrate of each chunk that is downloaded, possibly choosing different bitrates\nfor successive chunks.

For\n$0<n<1$, the diagram has the same topology as the generic O($n$) phase diagram\nwith $n<2$, with a first-order line when $z$ starts to dominate, and an\nO($n$)-like transition when $x$ starts to dominate. Both lines meet in an\nexactly solved higher critical point. For $n>1$, the O($n$)-like transition\nline appears to be absent. Thus, for $z=0$, the $(n,x)$ phase diagram displays\na line of phase transitions for $n\\le 1$. The line ends at $n=1$ in an\ninfinite-order transition. We determine the conformal anomaly and the critical\nexponents along this line. These results agree accurately with a recent\nproposal for the universal classification of this type of model, at least in\nmost of the range $-1 \\leq n \\leq 1$. We also determine the exponent describing\ncrossover to the generic O($n$) universality class, by introducing topological\ndefects associated with the introduction of `straight' vertices violating the\nninety-degree-bend rule. These results are obtained by means of transfer-matrix\ncalculations and finite-size scaling.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 11 figures"]}]

We examine the hypothesis\nthat brown dwarf companions could not survive on close orbit around stars with\nimportant convective envelopes because the tides and angular momentum loss\nthrough magnetic breaking should lead to a rapid orbital decay and quick\nengulfment of the companion. We use a classical Skumanich-type braking law, and\nconstant time-lag tidal theory to assess the characteristic timescale for\norbital decay for the brown dwarf mass range as a function of the host\nproperties. We find that F-type stars may host massive companions for a\nsignificantly longer time than G-type stars for a given orbital period, which\nmay explain the paucity of G-type hosts for brown dwarfs with orbital period\nless than 5 days. On the other hand, we show that the small radius of early\nM-type stars contributes to orbital decay timescales that are only half those\nof F-type stars, despite their more efficient tidal dissipation and magnetic\nbraking. For fully convective later type M-dwarfs, orbital decay timescales\ncould be orders of magnitude greater than for F-type stars. For orbital periods\ngreater than 10 days, brown dwarf occurrence should largely be unaffected by\ntidal decay, whatever the mass of the host. On closer orbital periods, the\nrapid engulfment of massive companions could explain the lack of G and K-type\nhosts in the sample of known systems with transiting brown dwarfs. However, the\npaucity of M-type hosts can not be an effect of tidal decay alone, but may be\nthe result of a selection effect in the sample and/or the formation mechanism.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures, recommended for publication in A&A"]}]

The absence of broad Ly alpha emission\nline has been a mystery for more than a decade. In this paper, we demonstrate\nthat this is due to dark Proximate Damped Ly alpha Absorption (PDLA) at $z_{\\rm\nabs}=3.010$ by identifying associated Lyman absorption line series from the\ndamped Ly beta up to Ly9, as well as the Lyman limit absorption edge.

With a luminosity of $L_{{\\rm\nLy}\\alpha}\\sim10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$, the residual Ly alpha emission superposed\non the PDLA trough is of two orders of magnitude stronger than previous\nreports. This is best explained as re-radiated photons arising from the quasar\noutflowing gas at a scale larger than the NELR. The PDLA here, acting like a\nnatural coronagraph, provides us with a good insight into the illuminated gas\nin the vicinity of the quasar, which are usually hard to resolve due to their\nsmall size and \"seeing fuzz\" of bright quasars. Notably, SDSS J0952+0114\nanalogs might be easily omitted in the spectroscopic surveys of DLAs and PDLAs,\nas their damped Ly alpha troughs can be fully filled by additional strong Ly\nalpha emissions.

We study supermassive black hole binaries where the less massive\nblack hole has carved an annular gap in the circumbinary disk, but nevertheless\nthere is a steady mass flow across its orbit. Such a perturbed disk is hotter\nand more luminous than a standard thin disk in some regions. Assuming that the\njet contains relativistic electrons, we calculate its broadband spectral energy\ndistribution focusing on the inverse Compton up-scattering of the disk photons.\nWe also compute the opacity to the gamma rays produced in the jet by photon\nannihilation with the disk radiation and take into account the effects of the\nanisotropy of the target photon field as seen from the jet.\n  Results.

We here report on\nthe first validated transiting Jupiter analog, Kepler-167e (KOI-490.02),\ndiscovered using Kepler archival photometry orbiting the K4-dwarf KIC-3239945.\nWith a radius of $(0.91\\pm0.02)$ $R_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$, a low orbital eccentricity\n($0.06_{-0.04}^{+0.10}$) and an equilibrium temperature of $(131\\pm3)$ K,\nKepler-167e bears many of the basic hallmarks of Jupiter. Kepler-167e is\naccompanied by three Super-Earths on compact orbits, which we also validate,\nleaving a large cavity of transiting worlds around the habitable-zone. With two\ntransits and continuous photometric coverage, we are able to uniquely and\nprecisely measure the orbital period of this post snow-line planet\n($1071.2323\\pm0.0006$ d), paving the way for follow-up of this $K=11.8$ mag\ntarget.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 10 figures.

Here, we consider the possibility that stars\nhosting these hybrid CONe cores might belong to a close binary system and,\neventually, become white dwarfs accreting from a non-degenerate companion at\nrates leading to a supernova explosion. We have computed the hydrodynamical\nphase of the explosion of Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs harboring hybrid\ncores, assuming that the explosion starts at the center, either as a detonation\n(as may be expected in some degenerate merging scenarios) or as a deflagration\n(that afterwards transitions into a delayed detonation).

During this time the pulse profile continued to\ndisplay large variations, and polarimetry indicates that the magnetic geometry\nremained consistent with that of earlier times. We supplement these results\nwith X-ray timing of the pulsar from its outburst in 2003 up to 2014. For the\nfirst 4 years, XTE J1810-197 experienced non-monotonic excursions in f-dot by\nat least a factor of 8. But since 2007, its f-dot has remained relatively\nstable near its minimum observed value. The only apparent event in the X-ray\nrecord that is possibly contemporaneous with the radio shut-down is a decrease\nof ~20% in the hot-spot flux in 2008-2009, to a stable, minimum value. However,\nthe permanence of the high-amplitude, thermal X-ray pulse, even after the radio\ndemise, implies continuing magnetar activity.\n","Comment: ApJ, accepted, 12 pages, 9 figures"]}]

Following the disappearance of an initial Ha filament\naligned along the polarity inversion line (PIL) of the AR, a new Ha filament\nformed in its place some 20 hours later, which remained stable for at least 1.5\ndays. The creation of the new Ha filament was driven by the ascent of\nhorizontal magnetic fields from the photosphere into the chromosphere at three\nseparate locations along the PIL. The magnetic fields at two of these locations\nwere situated directly underneath the initial Ha filament and formed orphan\npenumbrae already aligned along the Ha filament channel. The 700 G orphan\npenumbrae were stable and trapped in the photosphere until the disappearance of\nthe overlying initial Ha filament, after which they started to ascend into the\nchromosphere at 10pm5 m/s. Each ascent was associated with a simultaneous\nmagnetic flux reduction of up to 50% in the photosphere. The ascended orphan\npenumbrae formed dark 'seed' structures in Ha in parallel with the PIL, which\nelongated and merged to form an Ha filament. The filament channel featured\nhorizontal magnetic fields of on average 260 G at log(tau)=-2 suspended above\nthe nearly field-free lower photosphere. The fields took on an 'inverse'\nconfiguration at log(tau)=-2 suggesting a flux rope for the new Ha filament.\nThe orphan penumbral fields ascend into the chromosphere 9-24 hours before the\nHa filament is fully formed.

In this paper, we will consider cellular automata that arise from\npolynomial transition rules, where the symbols in the automaton are integers\nmodulo some prime $p$. We are principally concerned with the asymptotic\nbehavior of the line complexity sequence $a_T(k)$, which counts, for each $k$,\nthe number of coefficient strings of length $k$ that occur in the automaton. We\nbegin with the modulo $2$ case. For a given polynomial $T(x) = c_0 + c_1x + ...\n+ c_nx^n$ with $c_0,c_n\\neq 0$, we construct odd and even parts of the\npolynomial from the strings $0c_1c_3c_5...$ and $c_0c_2c_4...$, respectively.\nWe prove that for polynomials for which the odd and even parts are relatively\nprime, $a_T(k)$ satisfies recursions of a specific form. We also consider\npowers of transition rules modulo $p$, introducing a notion of the order of a\nrecursion. We show that the property of \"having a recursion of some order\" is\npreserved when the transition rule is raised to a positive integer power.\nExtending to a more general setting, we investigate the asymptotics of $a_T(k)$\nby considering an abstract generating function\n$\\phi(z)=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\alpha(k)z^k$ which satisfies a general functional\nequation relating $\\phi(z)$ and $\\phi(z^p)$ for some prime $p$.

We follow them from their emergence at one earth mass to a final mass\nof a few percent solar. We show that the density profiles of the first haloes\nare well described by a $\\sim r^{-1.5}$ power-law. As haloes grow in mass,\ntheir density profiles evolve significantly. In the central regions, they\nbecome shallower and reach on average $\\sim r^{-1}$, the asymptotic form of an\nNFW profile. However, the profile of individual haloes can show non-monotonic\ndensity slopes, and be shallower than $-1$ in some cases. We investigate the\ntransformation of cuspy power-law profiles using a series of non-cosmological\nsimulations of equal-mass mergers. Contrary to previous findings, we observe\nthat temporal variations in the gravitational potential caused by mergers lead\nto a shallowing of the inner profile, an effect which is stronger for shallower\ninitial profiles and for mergers that involve a higher number of systems.\nDepending on the merger details, the resulting profiles can be shallower or\nsteeper than NFW in their inner regions. Interestingly, mergers have a much\nweaker effect when the initial profile is given by a broken power-law with an\ninner slope of $-1$ (such as NFW or Hernquist profiles). This offers a\nplausible explanation for the emergence of NFW-like profiles in $\\chi$DM\nsimulations. After their initial collapse, $\\chi$DM haloes suffer copious major\nmergers, which progressively shallows the profile. However, once an NFW-like\nprofile is established, it appears stable against subsequent merging. This\nsuggests that halo profiles are not universal but rather a combination of (1)\nthe physics of the formation of the microhaloes and (2) their early merger\nhistory, which are both set by the properties of the dark matter particle, as\nwell as (3) the resilience of NFW-like profiles to perturbations.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 14 figures"]}]

Because\nof its unusual characteristics for a Type Ib/c supernova, the relation of\nSN1998bw to GRB980425 is strengthened and suggests that at least some classes\nof GRBs originate in supernova (SN) massive star explosions.

Phy. Chem. 215, 207 (2001)). This\nwork focuses on the polyads P = 3 and P = 4 corresponding to excitation\nenergies E_v ~ 5100 cm^-1 and 7000 cm^-1 respectively. The majority of states\nbelonging to these polyads are dynamically assigned, despite extensive\nstochasticity in the classical phase space, using the recently proposed\ntechnique of level velocities. A wavelet based time-frequency analysis is used\nto reveal the nature of phase space transport and the relevant dynamical\nbottlenecks. The local frequency analysis clearly illustrates the existence of\nmode-specific IVR dynamics i.e., differing nature of the IVR dynamics ensuing\nfrom CO stretch and the DCO bend bright states. In addition the role of the\nweak Fermi resonance involving the CO stretch and DCO bend modes is\ninvestigated. A key feature of the present work is that the techniques utilized\nfor the analysis i.e., parametric variations and local frequency analysis are\nnot limited by the dimensionality of the system. This study, thus, explores the\npotential for understanding IVR in large molecules from both time domain and\nfrequency domain perspectives.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 8 low resolution figures (including 2 color figures).\n  submitted to PCCP"]}]
