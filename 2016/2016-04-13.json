The formalism is valid for all types of charged\nparticles and due to its closed nature is suited to provide fast conversion of\ndose to DNA-damage. Methods: The induction of double strand breaks in\nDNA--strings residing in irradiated cells is quantified using a single particle\nmodel. This leads to a proposal to use the cumulative Cauchy distribution to\nexpress the mix of high and low LET type damage probability generated by a\nsingle particle. A microscopic phenomenological Monte Carlo code is used to fit\nthe parameters of the model as a function of kinetic energy related to the\ndamage to a DNA molecule embedded in a cell. The model is applied for four\nparticles: electrons, protons, alpha--particles, and carbon ions. A geometric\ninterpretation of this observation using the impact ionization mean free path\nas a quantifier, allows extension of the model to very low energies. Results:\nThe mathematical expression describes the model adequately using a chi--square\ntest ($\\chi^2/NDF < 1$).

It is quite well known\nfrom the \"No-Broadcasting theorem\" that perfect broadcasting of quantum\ncorrelation is not possible. However it does not rule out the possibility of\npartial broadcasting of correlations where we can get lesser correlated states\nfrom a given correlated state. In order to have a holistic view of\nbroadcasting, we investigate this problem by starting with most general\nrepresentation of two qubit mixed states in terms of the Bloch vectors. As a\ncloning transformation we have used universal symmetric optimal Buzek-Hillery\n(B-H) cloner both locally and nonlocally.

Direct\nnumerical simulations (DNS) of convection driven dynamos offer one way of\nexamining the mechanisms behind these events. In this work, we analyze a\nsolution of a solar-like DNS that has been evolved for roughly 80 magnetic\ncycles of 4.9 years, during which epochs of irregular behavior are detected.\nThe emphasis of our analysis is to find physical causes for such behavior. The\nDNS employed is a semi-global (wedge) magnetoconvection model. For data\nanalysis we use Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and phase\ndispersion ($D^2$) methods. A special property of the DNS is the existence of\nmultiple dynamo modes at different depths and latitudes. The dominant mode is\nsolar-like. This mode is accompanied by a higher frequency mode near the\nsurface and a low-frequency mode in the bottom of the convection zone. The\noverall behavior of the dynamo solution is very complex exhibiting variable\ncycle lengths, epochs of disturbed and even ceased surface activity, and strong\nshort-term hemispherical asymmetries. Surprisingly, the most prominent\nsuppressed surface activity epoch is actually a global magnetic energy maximum.\nWe interpret the overall irregular behavior to be due to the interplay of the\ndifferent dynamo modes showing different equatorial symmetries, especially the\nsmoother part of the irregular variations being related to the variations of\nthe mode strengths, evolving with different and variable cycle lengths. The\nabrupt low activity epoch in the dominant dynamo mode near the surface is\nrelated to a strong maximum of the bottom toroidal field strength, which causes\nabrupt disturbances especially in the differential rotation profile via the\nsuppression of the Reynolds stresses.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 16 figures, Astronomy and Astrophysics, accepted for\n  publication"]}]

Unfortunately,\nClifford operations are precisely the ones available through braiding and\nmeasurement in systems supporting non-Abelian Majorana zero modes, which are\notherwise an excellent candidate for topologically protected quantum\ncomputation. In order to move beyond the classically simulable subspace, an\nadditional phase gate is required. This phase gate allows the system to violate\nthe Bell-like CHSH inequality that would constrain a local hidden variable\ntheory. In this article, we both demonstrate the procedure for measuring Bell\nviolations in Majorana systems and introduce a new type of phase gate for the\nalready existing semiconductor-based Majorana wire systems. We conclude with an\nexperimentally feasible schematic combining the two, which should potentially\nlead to the demonstration of Bell violation in a Majorana experiment in the\nnear future. Our work also naturally leads to a well-defined platform for\nuniversal fault-tolerant quantum computation using Majorana zero modes, which\nwe describe.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 13 figures; Title and references updated"]}]

Therefore, we need to build a solar atlas for the\nspectrograph, to provide accurate calibrations of the spectroscopically\ndetermined abundances of solar and late type stars observed with this\ninstrument and thus perform differential spectral comparisons. We acquire\nhigh-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectroscopy to construct three solar\nreference spectra by observing the reflected light of Vesta and Victoria\nasteroids and Europa (100<S/N<450) with the \\Hermes spectrograph. We then\nobserve the Kepler solar analog KIC3241581 (S/N~170). We constructed three\nsolar spectrum atlases from 385 to 900 nm obtained with the Hermes spectrograph\nfrom observations of two bright asteroids and Europa. A comparison between our\nsolar spectra atlas to the Kurucz and HARPS solar spectrum shows an excellent\nagreement. KIC3241581 was found to be a long-periodic binary system. The\nfundamental parameter for the stellar primary component are Teff=5689+/-11K,\nlogg=4.385+/-0.005, [Fe/H]=+0.22+/-0.01, being in agreement with the published\nglobal seismic values confirming its status of solar analogue. KIC 3241581 is a\nmetal rich solar analogue with a solar-like activity level in a binary system\nof unknown period. The chromospheric activity level is compatible to the solar\nmagnetic activity.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

We estimate the effects of the new\nSILSO record on two widely used TSI reconstructions, namely the NRLTSI2 and the\nSATIRE models. We find that the SILSO record has little effect on either model\nafter 1885 but leads to greater amplitude solar-cycle fluctuations in TSI\nreconstructions prior, suggesting many 18th and 19th century cycles could be\nsimilar in amplitude to those of the current Modern Maximum. TSI records based\non the revised sunspot data do not suggest a significant change in Maunder\nMinimum TSI values, and comparing that era to the present we find only very\nsmall potential differences in estimated solar contributions to climate with\nthis new sunspot record.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in Solar Physics, Jan.\n  2016"]}]

Bitrate adaptation requires a tradeoff between\nreducing the probability that the video freezes and enhancing the quality of\nthe video shown to the user. A bitrate that is too high leads to frequent video\nfreezes (i.e., rebuffering), while a bitrate that is too low leads to poor\nvideo quality. Video providers segment the video into short chunks and encode\neach chunk at multiple bitrates. The video player adaptively chooses the\nbitrate of each chunk that is downloaded, possibly choosing different bitrates\nfor successive chunks.

We also use Markov chain monte carlo method to\nderive the best-fitting star formation history from the observed stellar mass\ndensity data. At $0.5<z<6$, the observed star formation rate densities are\nlarger than the best-fitting one, especially at $z\\sim2$ where by a factor of\nabout two. However, at lower ($z<0.5$) and higher redshifts ($z>6$), the\nderived star formation history is consistent with the observations. This is the\nfirst time to test the discrepancy between the observed stellar mass density\nand instantaneous star formation rate up to very high redshift $z\\approx8$\nusing the Markov chain monte carlo method and a varying recycling factor.\nSeveral possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed, such as\nunderestimation of stellar mass density, initial mass function and cosmic\nmetallicity evolution.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables, accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

There is a relative paucity of brown dwarfs companions around FGKM\nstars compared to exoplanets for orbital periods less than a few years, but\nmost of the short-period brown dwarf companions fully characterised by transits\nand radial velocities are found around F-type stars. We examine the hypothesis\nthat brown dwarf companions could not survive on close orbit around stars with\nimportant convective envelopes because the tides and angular momentum loss\nthrough magnetic breaking should lead to a rapid orbital decay and quick\nengulfment of the companion. We use a classical Skumanich-type braking law, and\nconstant time-lag tidal theory to assess the characteristic timescale for\norbital decay for the brown dwarf mass range as a function of the host\nproperties. We find that F-type stars may host massive companions for a\nsignificantly longer time than G-type stars for a given orbital period, which\nmay explain the paucity of G-type hosts for brown dwarfs with orbital period\nless than 5 days. On the other hand, we show that the small radius of early\nM-type stars contributes to orbital decay timescales that are only half those\nof F-type stars, despite their more efficient tidal dissipation and magnetic\nbraking. For fully convective later type M-dwarfs, orbital decay timescales\ncould be orders of magnitude greater than for F-type stars. For orbital periods\ngreater than 10 days, brown dwarf occurrence should largely be unaffected by\ntidal decay, whatever the mass of the host. On closer orbital periods, the\nrapid engulfment of massive companions could explain the lack of G and K-type\nhosts in the sample of known systems with transiting brown dwarfs. However, the\npaucity of M-type hosts can not be an effect of tidal decay alone, but may be\nthe result of a selection effect in the sample and/or the formation mechanism.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures, recommended for publication in A&A"]}]

The absence of broad Ly alpha emission\nline has been a mystery for more than a decade. In this paper, we demonstrate\nthat this is due to dark Proximate Damped Ly alpha Absorption (PDLA) at $z_{\\rm\nabs}=3.010$ by identifying associated Lyman absorption line series from the\ndamped Ly beta up to Ly9, as well as the Lyman limit absorption edge.

With a luminosity of $L_{{\\rm\nLy}\\alpha}\\sim10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$, the residual Ly alpha emission superposed\non the PDLA trough is of two orders of magnitude stronger than previous\nreports. This is best explained as re-radiated photons arising from the quasar\noutflowing gas at a scale larger than the NELR. The PDLA here, acting like a\nnatural coronagraph, provides us with a good insight into the illuminated gas\nin the vicinity of the quasar, which are usually hard to resolve due to their\nsmall size and \"seeing fuzz\" of bright quasars. Notably, SDSS J0952+0114\nanalogs might be easily omitted in the spectroscopic surveys of DLAs and PDLAs,\nas their damped Ly alpha troughs can be fully filled by additional strong Ly\nalpha emissions.

We study supermassive black hole binaries where the less massive\nblack hole has carved an annular gap in the circumbinary disk, but nevertheless\nthere is a steady mass flow across its orbit.

Assuming that the\njet contains relativistic electrons, we calculate its broadband spectral energy\ndistribution focusing on the inverse Compton up-scattering of the disk photons.\nWe also compute the opacity to the gamma rays produced in the jet by photon\nannihilation with the disk radiation and take into account the effects of the\nanisotropy of the target photon field as seen from the jet.\n  Results. We find that the excess of low-energy photons radiated by the\nperturbed disk causes an increment in the external Compton emission from the\njet in the X-ray band, and a deep absorption feature at energies of tens of\nTeVs for some sets of parameters.

Recently, substantial efforts have been made in the machine learning\ncommunity to develop methods that prescind from expert-designed and manually\ntuned features for features that are automatically learned from data. In this\nwork we present what is, to our knowledge, the first unsupervised feature\nlearning algorithm designed for variable stars. Our method first extracts a\nlarge number of lightcurve subsequences from a given set of photometric data,\nwhich are then clustered to find common local patterns in the time series.\nRepresentatives of these patterns, called exemplars, are then used to transform\nlightcurves of a labeled set into a new representation that can then be used to\ntrain an automatic classifier. The proposed algorithm learns the features from\nboth labeled and unlabeled lightcurves, overcoming the bias generated when the\nlearning process is done only with labeled data. We test our method on MACHO\nand OGLE datasets; the results show that the classification performance we\nachieve is as good and in some cases better than the performance achieved using\ntraditional features, while the computational cost is significantly lower.\n"]}]

Here, we consider the possibility that stars\nhosting these hybrid CONe cores might belong to a close binary system and,\neventually, become white dwarfs accreting from a non-degenerate companion at\nrates leading to a supernova explosion. We have computed the hydrodynamical\nphase of the explosion of Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs harboring hybrid\ncores, assuming that the explosion starts at the center, either as a detonation\n(as may be expected in some degenerate merging scenarios) or as a deflagration\n(that afterwards transitions into a delayed detonation). We assume these hybrid\ncores are made of a central CO volume, of mass M(CO), surrounded by an ONe\nshell. We show that, in case of a pure detonation, a medium-sized CO-rich\nregion, M(CO)<0.4 Msun, results in the ejection of a small fraction of the\nmantle while leaving a massive bound remnant. Part of this remnant is made of\nthe products of the detonation, Fe-group nuclei, but they are buried in its\ninner regions, unless convection is activated during the ensuing cooling and\nshrinking phase of the remnant.

The binary fraction among host stars is an important\ndiscriminator between competing formation theories, but has not been well\ncharacterised. Additionally, contaminating light from unresolved stars can\nsignificantly affect the accuracy of photometric and spectroscopic measurements\nin studies of transiting exoplanets. Aims. We observed 101 transiting exoplanet\nhost systems in the Southern hemisphere in order to create a homogeneous\ncatalogue of both bound companion stars and contaminating background stars. We\ninvestigate the binary fraction among the host stars in order to test theories\nfor the formation of hot Jupiters, in an area of the sky where transiting\nexoplanetary systems have not been systematically searched for stellar\ncompanions. Methods. Lucky imaging observations from the Two Colour Instrument\non the Danish 1.54m telescope at La Silla were used to search for previously\nunresolved stars at small angular separations. The separations and relative\nmagnitudes of all detected stars were measured. For 12 candidate companions to\n10 host stars, previous astrometric measurements were used to evaluate how\nlikely the companions are to be physically associated. Results. We provide\nmeasurements of 499 candidate companions within 20 arcseconds of our sample of\n101 planet host stars. 51 candidates are located within 5 arcseconds of a host\nstar, and we provide the first published measurements for 27 of these.\nCalibrations for the plate scale and colour performance of the Two Colour\nInstrument are presented.

Methods: We have collected\nhigh-resolution echelle spectra of HD 16771 and derived stellar parameters and\nchemical abundances for 27 elements by either line equivalent widths or\nsynthetic spectrum analyses.

The non-detection of 6Li(< 3%), a low carbon\nisotopic ratio (12C/13C=12+/-2), and the slow rotation (vsini=2.8 km/s) all\nsuggest that lithium might have been synthesized in this star. On the contrary,\nHD 16771 with a mass of 2.4 Msun has no chance of encountering luminosity\nfunction bump and He-core flash where the possibility of fast deep-mixing for\nLi enrichment in K giants has been suggested previously.

In this paper, we will consider cellular automata that arise from\npolynomial transition rules, where the symbols in the automaton are integers\nmodulo some prime $p$. We are principally concerned with the asymptotic\nbehavior of the line complexity sequence $a_T(k)$, which counts, for each $k$,\nthe number of coefficient strings of length $k$ that occur in the automaton. We\nbegin with the modulo $2$ case. For a given polynomial $T(x) = c_0 + c_1x + ...\n+ c_nx^n$ with $c_0,c_n\\neq 0$, we construct odd and even parts of the\npolynomial from the strings $0c_1c_3c_5...$ and $c_0c_2c_4...$, respectively.\nWe prove that for polynomials for which the odd and even parts are relatively\nprime, $a_T(k)$ satisfies recursions of a specific form. We also consider\npowers of transition rules modulo $p$, introducing a notion of the order of a\nrecursion. We show that the property of \"having a recursion of some order\" is\npreserved when the transition rule is raised to a positive integer power.\nExtending to a more general setting, we investigate the asymptotics of $a_T(k)$\nby considering an abstract generating function\n$\\phi(z)=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\alpha(k)z^k$ which satisfies a general functional\nequation relating $\\phi(z)$ and $\\phi(z^p)$ for some prime $p$.

We show not only that\nsubgroup lattices of solvable groups are comodernistic, but that solvability of\na group is equivalent to the comodernistic property on its subgroup lattice.\nIndeed, the definition of comodernistic exactly requires on every interval a\nlattice-theoretic analogue of the composition series in a solvable group. Thus,\nthe relation between comodernistic lattices and solvable groups resembles, in\nseveral respects, that between supersolvable lattices and supersolvable groups.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 3 figures, 1 table"]}]

We follow them from their emergence at one earth mass to a final mass\nof a few percent solar. We show that the density profiles of the first haloes\nare well described by a $\\sim r^{-1.5}$ power-law. As haloes grow in mass,\ntheir density profiles evolve significantly. In the central regions, they\nbecome shallower and reach on average $\\sim r^{-1}$, the asymptotic form of an\nNFW profile. However, the profile of individual haloes can show non-monotonic\ndensity slopes, and be shallower than $-1$ in some cases. We investigate the\ntransformation of cuspy power-law profiles using a series of non-cosmological\nsimulations of equal-mass mergers. Contrary to previous findings, we observe\nthat temporal variations in the gravitational potential caused by mergers lead\nto a shallowing of the inner profile, an effect which is stronger for shallower\ninitial profiles and for mergers that involve a higher number of systems.\nDepending on the merger details, the resulting profiles can be shallower or\nsteeper than NFW in their inner regions. Interestingly, mergers have a much\nweaker effect when the initial profile is given by a broken power-law with an\ninner slope of $-1$ (such as NFW or Hernquist profiles). This offers a\nplausible explanation for the emergence of NFW-like profiles in $\\chi$DM\nsimulations. After their initial collapse, $\\chi$DM haloes suffer copious major\nmergers, which progressively shallows the profile. However, once an NFW-like\nprofile is established, it appears stable against subsequent merging. This\nsuggests that halo profiles are not universal but rather a combination of (1)\nthe physics of the formation of the microhaloes and (2) their early merger\nhistory, which are both set by the properties of the dark matter particle, as\nwell as (3) the resilience of NFW-like profiles to perturbations.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 14 figures"]}]

Phy. Chem. 215, 207 (2001)). This\nwork focuses on the polyads P = 3 and P = 4 corresponding to excitation\nenergies E_v ~ 5100 cm^-1 and 7000 cm^-1 respectively. The majority of states\nbelonging to these polyads are dynamically assigned, despite extensive\nstochasticity in the classical phase space, using the recently proposed\ntechnique of level velocities. A wavelet based time-frequency analysis is used\nto reveal the nature of phase space transport and the relevant dynamical\nbottlenecks. The local frequency analysis clearly illustrates the existence of\nmode-specific IVR dynamics i.e., differing nature of the IVR dynamics ensuing\nfrom CO stretch and the DCO bend bright states. In addition the role of the\nweak Fermi resonance involving the CO stretch and DCO bend modes is\ninvestigated. A key feature of the present work is that the techniques utilized\nfor the analysis i.e., parametric variations and local frequency analysis are\nnot limited by the dimensionality of the system. This study, thus, explores the\npotential for understanding IVR in large molecules from both time domain and\nfrequency domain perspectives.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 8 low resolution figures (including 2 color figures).\n  submitted to PCCP"]}]
