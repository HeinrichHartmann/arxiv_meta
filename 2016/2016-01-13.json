In\n[Luby-Randall-Sinclair 2001, Randall-Tetali 2000], fast mixin was proven:\n$T_{mix}=O(L^C)$ for some finite $C$. Here, we go much beyond and show that $c\nL^2\\le T_{mix}\\le L^{2+o(1)}$. Our result applies to rather general domain\nshapes (not just the $2L\\times 2L$ square), provided that the typical height\nfunction associated to the tiling is macroscopically planar in the large $L$\nlimit, under the uniform measure (this is the case for instance for the\nTemperley-type boundary conditions considered in [Kenyon 2000]). Also, our\nmethod extends to some other types of tilings of the plane, for instance the\ntilings associated to dimer coverings of the hexagon or square-hexagon\nlattices.\n","Comment: to appear on PTRF; 42 pages, 9 figures; v2: typos corrected,\n  references added"]}]

An {\\em exhausting family} of\nrepresentations of a C*-algebra A is a set F of representations of A with the\nproperty that every irreducible representation of A is weakly contained in some\n\\phi \\in F.

We prove\nseveral properties of exhausting families and we provide necessary and\nsufficient conditions for a family of representations to be exhausting. Using\nresults of Ionescu and Williams (2009), we show that the regular\nrepresentations of amenable, second countable, locally compact groupoids with a\nHaar system form an exhausting family of representations. If $A$ is a separable\nC*-algebra, we show that a family F of representations of $A$ is exhausting if,\nand only if, it is invertibility sufficient.

Recently, a new, local, test for the existence of dark energy in the\nform of a cosmological constant was proposed based on this turnaround bound.\nBefore designing an experiment that, through high-precision determination of\nmasses and turnaround radii, will challenge $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we have to\nanswer two important questions: first, when turnaround-scale structures are\npredicted to be close enough to their maximum size, so that a possible\nviolation of the bound may be observable. Second, which is the best mass scale\nto target for possible violations of the bound. Using the Press-Schechter\nformalism, we find that turnaround structures have in practice already stopped\nforming, and consequently, the turnaround radius of structures must be very\nclose to the maximum value today. We also find that the mass scale of $\\sim\n10^{13} M_\\odot$ characterizes turnaround structures that start to form in a\nstatistically important number density today. This mass scale also separates\nturnaround structures with different cosmological evolution: smaller structures\nare no longer readjusting their mass distribution inside the turnaround scale,\nthey asymptotically approach their ultimate abundance from higher values, and\nthey are common enough to have, at some epoch, experienced major mergers with\nstructures of comparable mass; larger structures exhibit the opposite behavior.\nWe call this mass scale the transitional mass scale and we argue that it is the\noptimal for the purpose outlined above.

In order to better understand the nature of this source and its duty\ncycle, and in the light of several physical models that have been subsequently\npublished, we conduct a spectral and temporal analysis of the 0.5-8 keV X-ray\nemission from this source from 15 years of Chandra observations. We fit the\nChandra spectra of the pulsar with a power-law model and a disk black body\nmodel, subjected to interstellar absorption in M82. We carefully assess for the\neffect of pile-up in our observations, where 4/19 observations have a pile-up\nfraction >10%, which we account for during spectral modeling with a convolution\nmodel. When fitted with a power-law model, the average photon index when the\nsource is at high luminosity (L_X>10^39 ergs s^-1) is Gamma=1.33+/-0.15. For\nthe disk black body model, the average temperature is T=3.24+/-0.65 keV,\nconsistent with other luminous X-ray pulsars. We also investigated the\ninclusion of a soft excess component and spectral break, finding that the\nspectra are also consistent with these features common to luminous X-ray\npulsars. In addition, we present spectral analysis from NuSTAR over the 3-50\nkeV range where we have isolated the pulsed component.

Pebbles accumulate at this pressure trap, which builds\nup a ring, and then a planet. The planet is expected to grow until it opens a\ngap, which helps to both truncate pebble accretion and induce DZIB retreat that\nsets the location of formation of the next planet. This simple scenario may be\nmodified if the planet migrates significantly from its formation location. Thus\nplanet-disk interactions play a crucial role in the IOPF scenario.

We have also\ndetected three MSPs out of nine observed in the frequency range 38-77 MHz. This\nis the largest sample of MSPs ever observed at these low frequencies, and half\nof the detected MSPs were observed for the first time at frequencies below 200\nMHz. We present the average pulse profiles of the detected MSPs, their\neffective pulse widths, and flux densities and compare these with higher\nobserving frequencies. The flux-calibrated, multifrequency LOFAR pulse profiles\nare publicly available via the EPN Database of Pulsar Profiles. We also present\naverage values of dispersion measures (DM) and discuss DM and profile\nvariations. About 35% of the MSPs show strong narrow profiles, another 25%\nexhibit scattered profiles, and the rest are only weakly detected. A\nqualitative comparison of LOFAR profiles with those at higher radio frequencies\nshows constant separation between profile components. Similarly, the profile\nwidths are consistent with those observed at higher frequencies, unless\nscattering dominates at the lowest frequencies. This is very different from\nwhat is observed for normal pulsars and suggests a compact emission region in\nthe MSP magnetosphere. The amplitude ratio of the profile components, on the\nother hand, can dramatically change towards low frequencies, often with the\ntrailing component becoming dominant. As previously demonstrated this can be\ncaused by aberration and retardation. This data set enables high-precision\nstudies of pulse profile evolution with frequency, dispersion, Faraday\nrotation, and scattering in the interstellar medium. Characterising and\ncorrecting these systematic effects may improve pulsar-timing precision at\nhigher observing frequencies, where pulsar timing array projects aim to\ndirectly detect gravitational waves.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables, accepted to A&A"]}]

During the last 30 years the surface of Pluto has been\ncharacterized, and its variability has been monitored, through continuous\nnear-infrared spectroscopic observations.

Methods. We observed Pluto on six nights between\nMay and July 2014, with the imager/spectrograph ACAM at the William Herschel\nTelescope (La Palma, Spain). The six spectra obtained cover a whole rotation of\nPluto (Prot = 6.4 days).

Results. All the new spectra show the methane ice absorption bands between\n0.62 and 0.90 $\\mu$m. The computation of the depth of the band at 0.62 $\\mu$m\nin the new spectra of Pluto, and in the spectra of Makemake and Eris from the\nliterature, allowed us to estimate the Lambert coefficient at this wavelength,\nat a temperature of 30 K and 40 K, never measured before. All the detected\nbands are blue shifted, with minimum shifts in correspondence with the regions\nwhere the abundance of methane is higher. This could be indicative of a\ndilution of CH4:N2 more saturated in CH4. The longitudinal and secular\nvariations of the parameters measured in the spectra are in accordance with\nresults previously reported in the literature and with the distribution of the\ndark and bright material that show the Pluto's albedo maps from New Horizons.\n","Comment: This manuscript may change and improve during the reviewing process.\n  The data reduction and calibration is reliable and has been checked\n  independently using different reduction approaches.

HeII emission line images are used to identify up to\nsix Wolf-Rayet stars in Mrk 71, three of which lie on the edge of blow-out\nregion. This study not only demonstrates the benefits of high-resolution\nspatially-resolved observations in assessing the effects of feedback\nmechanisms, but also the limitations of fine spatial scales when employing\nemission-line diagnostics. Both aspects are especially relevant as we enter the\nera of extremely large telescopes, when observing structure on ~10 pc scales\nwill no longer be limited to the local universe.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

This means that it is sensitive to both long-period and low-mass\nplanets and also to the effects induced by stellar activity cycles. We modelled\nthe data using Keplerian functions that correspond to planetary candidates and\nincluded the short- and long-term effects of magnetic activity. A Bayesian\napproach was taken both for the data modelling, which allowed us to include\ninformation from activity proxies such as $\\log{(R'_{\\rm HK})}$ in the velocity\nmodelling, and for the model selection, which permitted determining the number\nof significant signals in the system.

Four out of the six planets\npreviously reported for HD40307 are confirmed and characterised. We discuss the\nremaining two proposed signals.

Accurate photometry with ground based solar telescopes requires\ncharacterization of straylight. Scattering in Earth's atmosphere and in the\ntelescope optics are potentially significant sources of straylight, for which\nthe point spread function (PSF) has wings that reach very far. This kind of\nstraylight produces an aureola, extending several solar radii off the solar\ndisk. Aims. We want to measure such straylight using the ordinary science\ninstrumentation. Methods. We scanned the intensity on and far off the solar\ndisk by use of the science cameras in several different wavelength bands on a\nday with low-dust conditions. We characterized the far wing straylight by\nfitting a model to the recorded intensities involving a multi-component\nstraylight PSF and the limb darkening of the disk. Results. The measured\nscattered light adds an approximately constant fraction of the local\ngranulation intensity to science images at any position on the disk. The\nfraction varied over the day but never exceeded a few percent. The PSFs have\nweak tails that extend to several solar radii but most of the scattered light\noriginates within ~1'. Conclusions. Far-wing scattered light contributes only a\nsmall amount of straylight in SST data. Other sources of straylight are\nprimarily responsible for the reduced contrast in SST images.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics"]}]

Aims: We aim at investigating the spectral type evolution of\nthis star over the recent decades as well as during one pulsation cycle in more\ndetail and discuss it in connection with the period evolution. Methods: We\npresent optical, near- and mid-IR low-resolution as well as optical\nhigh-resolution spectra to determine the current spectral type. The optical\nspectrum of LX Cyg has been followed for more than one pulsation cycle. Recent\nspectra are compared to archival spectra to trace the spectral type evolution\nand a Spitzer mid-IR spectrum is analysed for the presence of molecular and\ndust features. Furthermore, the current period is derived from AAVSO data.\nResults: It is found that the spectral type of LX Cyg changed from S to C\nsometime between 1975 and 2008. Currently, the spectral type C is stable during\na pulsation cycle. It is shown that spectral features typical of C-type stars\nare present in its spectrum from ~0.5 to 14 $\\mu{\\rm{m}}$. An emission feature\nat 10.7 $\\mu{\\rm{m}}$ is attributed to SiC grains. The period of LX Cyg has\nincreased from ~460 d to ~580 d within only 20 years, and is stable now.\nConclusions: We conclude that the change in spectral type and the increase in\npulsation period happened simultaneously and are causally connected. Both a\nrecent thermal pulse (TP) and a simple surface temperature decrease appear\nunlikely to explain the observations. We therefore suggest that the underlying\nmechanism is related to a recent third dredge-up mixing event that brought up\ncarbon from the interior of the star, i.e. that a genuine abundance change\nhappened. We propose that LX Cyg is a rare transition type object that is\nuniquely suited to study the transformation from O- to C-rich stars in detail.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

The presence of a small-mass planet (M$_p<$0.1\\,M$_{Jup}$) seems, to\ndate, not to depend on metallicity, however, theoretical simulations have shown\nthat stars with subsolar metallicities may be favoured for harbouring smaller\nplanets. A large, dedicated survey of metal-poor stars with the HARPS\nspectrograph has thus been carried out to search for Neptunes and super-Earths.\nAims. In this paper, we present the analysis of \\object{HD175607}, an old G6\nstar with metallicity [Fe/H] = -0.62. We gathered 119 radial velocity\nmeasurements in 110 nights over a time span of more than nine years. Methods.\nThe radial velocities were analysed using Lomb-Scargle periodograms, a genetic\nalgorithm, a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis, and a Gaussian processes\nanalysis. The spectra were also used to derive stellar properties. Several\nactivity indicators were analysed to study the effect of stellar activity on\nthe radial velocities. Results. We find evidence for the presence of a small\nNeptune-mass planet (M$_{p}\\sin i = 8.98\\pm1.10$\\,M$_{\\oplus}$) orbiting this\nstar with an orbital period $P = 29.01\\pm0.02$\\, days in a slightly eccentric\norbit ($e=0.11\\pm0.08$).

Within the considered model space, the clumpiness has a significant\nimpact on the disk temperature distribution. For instance, in the transition\nregion from the upper disk layers to the disk interior, it causes a decrease of\nthe mean temperature by up to 12 K. In addition, circumstellar disks with\nclumpy density distributions feature a lower spectral index in the submm/mm\nrange of the SED. As a consequence of the lower spectral index, the dust grain\nsize derived from the submm/mm-slope of the SED may be overestimated, if the\ninhomogeneity of the disk density distribution is not taken into account.\nFurthermore, the scattered light brightness distribution of clumpy disks shows\na steeper radial decrease.

The\nmodeling suggests that the accelerated electrons are trapped in the coronal\npart of the flaring loop, but away from where the magnetic field is minimal,\nand, thus, demonstrates that the data are clearly inconsistent with electron\nmagnetic trapping in the weak diffusion regime mediated by the Coulomb\ncollisions. Thus, the modeling supports the interpretation of the coronal\nthick-target sources as sites of electron acceleration in flares and supplies\nus with a realistic 3D model with physical parameters of the acceleration\nregion and flaring loop.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 5 figures, ApJ in press"]}]

We reanalysed IRTF/SpeX observations of Uranus observed in 2009\ncovering the wavelength range 0.8 to 1.8 microns and reported by Tice et al.\n(2013). By retrieving the imaginary refractive index spectra of cloud particles\nwe are able to consistently define the real part of the refractive index\nspectra, through a Kramers-Kronig analysis, and thus determine self-consistent\nextinction cross-section, single-scattering and phase-function spectra for the\nclouds and hazes in Uranus' atmosphere. We tested two different cloud-modelling\nschemes used in conjunction with the temperature/methane profile of Baines et\nal. (1995), a reanalysis of the Voyager-2 radio-occultation observations\nperformed by Sromovsky, Fry and Tomasko (2011), and a recent determination from\nSpitzer (Orton et al., 2014). We find that both cloud-modelling schemes\nrepresent the observed centre-of-disc spectrum of Uranus well, and both require\nsimilar cloud scattering properties of the main cloud residing at approximately\n2 bars. However, a modified version of the Sromovsky, Fry and Tomasko (2011)\nmodel, with revised spectral properties of the lowest cloud layer, fits\nslightly better at shorter wavelengths and is more consistent with the expected\nvertical position of Uranus' methane cloud. We find that the bulk of the\nreflected radiance from Uranus arises from a thick cloud at approximately the 2\nbar level, composed of particles that are significantly more absorbing at\nwavelengths > 1.0 micron than they are at wavelengths < 1.0 micron. This\nspectral information provides a possible constraint on the identity of the main\nparticle type.\n","Comment: 52 Pages, 14 Figures"]}]

In our\nmodel, we assume that heat is mostly carried by phonons in the solid, and that\nsound waves carry diffusive heat from the interface into the bulk of the\nliquid, where both longitudinal and transverse sound waves are considered.\nSound wave dispersion is calculated from the fluid pair distribution function,\nevaluated using approximate integral equation theories (i.e., Percus-Yevick,\nHypernetted-chain approximation). The Kapitza conductance of the solid-fluid\ninterface is obtained from the phonon transmission coefficient at the\ninterface. We determine the interfacial phonon transmission coefficient by\nsolving the coupled equations of motion for the interfacial solid and fluid\natoms.

During mitigation a change of the spatial structure of\nELM loads on divertor was observed on DIII-D and MAST: the power is deposited\npredominantly in the footprint structures formed by the magnetic perturbation.\nIn the present contribution we develop a theory explaining this effect, based\non the idea that part of the ELM loss is caused by parallel transport in the\nhomoclinic tangle formed by the magnetic perturbation of the ELM. The modified\ntangle resulting from the combination of the ELM perturbation and the applied\nRMP has the expected property of bringing open field lines in the same areas as\nthe tangle from the RMP alone. We show that this explanation is consistent with\nfeatures of the mitigated ELMs on MAST.\n  We in addition validated our theory by an analysis of simulations of\nmitigated ELMs using the code JOREK. We produced detailed laminar plots of\nfield lines on the divertor in the JOREK runs with an ELM, an applied RMP, and\nan ELM mitigated by the presence of the RMP. The results for an ELM clearly\nshow a high-n rotating footprint structure appearing during the nonlinear stage\nof the ELM, which is not present in the early stage of the ELM. The results for\na n=2 RMP from the ELM control coils show the expected n=2 footprint structure.\nThe results for the mitigated ELM show a similar structure, modulated by a\nhigher n perturbation of the ELM, consistent with our theory.\n","Comment: 13 pages, presented at the 25th IAEA Fusion Energy Conference, St.\n  Petersburg, Russian Federation, October 13-18, 2014, paper TH/P6-1"]}]

A total area of\nabout 75 square degrees of sky is analysed. Assuming a non-variable luminosity\nfunction within the bulge, we derive the top end of the K-band luminosity\nfunction and the stellar density function, whose morphology is fitted to\ntriaxial ellipsoids.\n  The luminosity function shows a sharp decrease brighter than $M_K=-8.0$ when\ncompared with the disc population. By fitting ellipsoids, we find that the\nbulge is triaxial with the major axis in the plane at an angle with line of\nsight to the Galactic centre of $12^\\circ$ in the first quadrant. The axial\nratios are $1:0.54:0.33$ and the distance of the Sun from the centre of the\ntriaxial ellipsoid is 7860 pc.\n  The best fit for the stellar density, assuming an ellipsoidal distribution,\nis $D(t)=1.17(t/2180)^{-1.8}\\exp(- (t/2180)^{1.8}) stars pc^{-3}$, for\n$1300<t<3000$, where $t$ is the distance along the major axis of the ellipsoid\nin parsecs.\n","Comment: 10 pages (Latex), 2 figures (eps), accepted in MNRAS Lett"]}]

A key element that makes a\nfurther use of this combination feasible is the periodicity in changes of the\norbital velocity direction for the source. Two cases are considered: (i) a\nbinary star; and (ii) a solitary star with the planetary companion. It is shown\nthat, in case (i), several precision Doppler measurements employing the gas\nabsorption cell technique would determine both the total orbital velocity and\nthe inclination angle of the binary orbit disentangled from the peculiar\nvelocity of the system.
