In this work,\nwe investigate the possibility to evaluate the departure from virial\nequilibrium in order to detect, in that balance, effects from a Dark\nMatter--Dark Energy interaction. We continue, from previous works, using a\nsimple model of interacting dark sector, the Layzer--Irvine equation for\ndynamical virial evolution, and employ optical observations in order to obtain\nthe mass profiles through weak lensing and X-ray observations giving the\nintracluster gas temperatures. Through a Monte Carlo method, we generate, for a\nset of clusters, measurements of observed virial ratios, interaction strength,\nrest virial ratio and departure from equilibrium factors.

Many previous authors have noted that stars in our\nuniverse would have difficulty producing carbon and other heavy elements in the\nabsence of the well-known $^{12}$C resonance at 7.6 MeV. This resonance is\nnecessary because $^8$Be is unstable in our universe, so that carbon must be\nproduced via the triple alpha reaction to achieve the requisite abundance.\nAlthough a moderate change in the energy of the resonance (200 -- 300 keV) will\nindeed affect carbon production, an even smaller change in the binding energy\nof beryllium ($\\sim100$ keV) would allow $^8$Be to be stable. A stable isotope\nwith $A=8$ would obviate the need for the triple alpha process in general, and\nthe $^{12}$C resonance in particular, for carbon production. This paper\nexplores the possibility that $^8$Be can be stable in other universes.

Here, we demonstrate a novel strategy to\nmaintain stable oscillations, i.e. with constant amplitude and frequency,\nwithout supplying external energy to compensate losses. The fundamental\nintrinsic mechanism of mode coupling is used to redistribute and store\nmechanical energy among vibrational modes and coherently transfer it back to\nthe principal mode when the external excitation is off. To experimentally\ndemonstrate this phenomenon that defies physical intuition, we exploit the\nnonlinear dynamic response of microelectromechanical (MEMS) oscillators to\ncouple two different vibrational modes through an internal resonance.

The observed changes in external\nluminescence suggest strong modifications of photon recycling caused by the\npresence of the emitter. Photon recycling for propagating modes is affected by\nreflection at the vacuum-emitter interface and is substantially decreased by\nthe leakage towards the emitter through tunneling of frustrated modes.

However, even after careful design, the inclusion of certain\nfeatures might cause the part to be non-manufacturable. In this paper, we\ndevelop a framework using Deep 3D-CNNs to learn salient features from a CAD\nmodel of a mechanical part and determine if the part can be manufactured or\nnot. CAD models of different manufacturable and non-manufacturable parts are\ngenerated using a solid modeling kernel and then converted into 3D voxel data\nusing a fast GPU-accelerated voxelization algorithm. The voxel data is used to\ntrain a 3D-CNN model for manufacturability classification.

Both players should maintain that during the game the graph admits a\nproper $k$-colouring. The game ends if either all $n$ vertices have been\ncoloured, or Painter has no legal move. In the former case, Painter wins the\ngame, in the latter one Builder is the winner.

In this paper,\nwe address the question whether it is possible to unveil how the underlying\nanatomical connectivity shape the brain's spontaneous correlation structure. We\nstart from the assumption that in order for two nodes to exhibit large\ncovariation, they must be exposed to similar input patterns from the entire\nnetwork. We then acknowledge that information rarely spreads only along an\nunique route, but rather travels along all possible paths. In real networks the\nstrength of local perturbations tends to decay as they propagate away from the\nsources, leading to a progressive attenuation of the original information\ncontent and, thus, of their influence. We use these notions to derive a novel\nanalytical measure, $\\mathcal{T}$ , which quantifies the similarity of the\nwhole-network input patterns arriving at any two nodes only due to the\nunderlying topology, in what is a generalization of the matching index. We show\nthat this measure of topological similarity can indeed be used to predict the\ncontribution of network topology to the expected correlation structure, thus\nunveiling the mechanism behind the tight but elusive relationship between\nstructure and function in complex networks. Finally, we use this measure to\ninvestigate brain connectivity, showing that information about the topology\ndefined by the complex fabric of brain axonal pathways specifies to a large\nextent the time-average functional connectivity observed at rest.\n"]}]

We show that scaling of various quantities\n(concurrence, entanglement entropy, magnetic and fidelity susceptibility)\nendures up to a stroboscopic time $\\tau_{bd}$, proportional to the size of the\nsystem. This behaviour is explained by noticing that the low-energy modes,\nresponsible for the scaling properties, are resilient to the absorption of\nenergy.

One of the crucial problems in multi-layered\nsocial network analysis is community extraction. To cope with this problem the\nCLECC measure (Cross Layered Edge Clustering Coefficient) was proposed in the\nthesis. It is an edge measure which expresses how much the neighbors of two\ngiven users are similar each other. Based on this measure the CLECC algorithm\nfor community extraction in the multi-layered social networks was designed. The\nalgorithm was tested on the real single-layered social networks (SSN) and\nmulti-layered social networks (MSN), as well as on benchmark networks from GN\nBenchmark (SSN), LFR Benchmark (SSN) and mLFR Benchmark (MSN) a special\nextension of LFR Benchmark, designed as a part of this thesis, which is able to\nproduce multi-layered benchmark networks. The second research problem\nconsidered in the thesis was group evolution discovery. Studies on this problem\nhave led to the development of the inclusion measure and the Group Evolution\nDiscovery (GED) method, which is designed to identify events between two groups\nin successive time frames in the social network. The method was tested on a\nreal social network and compared with two well-known algorithms regarding\naccuracy, execution time, flexibility and ease of implementation. Finally, a\nnew approach to prediction of group evolution in the social network was\ndeveloped. The new approach involves usage of the outputs of the GED method. It\nis shown, that using even a simple sequence, which consists of several\npreceding groups sizes and events, as an input for the classifier, the learned\nmodel can produce very good results also for simple classifiers.\n","Comment: My PhD Thesis defended in October 2012.

The\nresults from our simulations are tested using measurements from the Lunar\nAtmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) and the Lunar Atmosphere\nComposition Experiment (LACE). We find that the local time of the near-sunrise\npeak in exospheric density provides a strong constraint on the nature of the\nsurface interactions of the argon molecules. The time of this peak is the same\nover both the maria and highlands, and can be reproduced by simple surface\ninteraction models with a single desorption energy of 28 kJ mol^-1. The density\nat all local times of day is also reproduced to within a factor of 2 with the\ninclusion of a `squirrelling' process, by which particles build up a subsurface\npopulation during the night that reappears the following day. We demonstrate\nthat the persistent enhancement in argon density over the western maria in the\nLADEE dataset cannot be explained by locally changing the surface interactions\nover the maria, because this inevitably leads to a decrement at other local\ntimes of day, as well as shifting the position of the sunrise peak away from\nthat in the highlands. The only possible explanation for this overdensity\nappears to be that it is driven by a source coincident with the potassium\noverabundance in the western maria, and that the average lifetime of argon\nmolecules in the exosphere is very brief (~1.4 lunar days, 41 days). This\nimplies high source and loss rates of 1.1*10^22 argon atoms s^-1 , which could\nrequire permanent cold traps comparable with the area of permanently shadowed\nregions, or a more highly localised source. We demonstrate that the long-term\nvariation in the global argon density seen by LADEE could be explained by the\npresence of large seasonal cold traps, the required sizes of which depend on\nthe area of the permanent traps.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 10 figures, submitted to Icarus"]}]
