More precisely, we find\na theory in a separable language such that the set of types omissible in some\nof its models is a complete $\\bSigma^1_2$ set and a complete theory in a\nseparable language such that the set of types omissible in some of its models\nis a complete $\\bPi^1_1$ set. We also construct (i) a complete theory $\\bfT$\nand a countable set of types such that each of its finite sets is jointly\nomissible in a model of $\\bfT$, but the whole set is not and (ii) a complete\ntheory and two types that are separately omissible, but not jointly omissible,\nin its models.\n","Comment: Numerous improvements"]}]

We consider a capsule with a\nstress-free spherical shape and impose its steady state configuration in an\ninfinitely long straight channel as the initial condition for our calculations.\nWe report how the capsule deformation, velocity, retention time, and maximum\nstress of the membrane are affected by the capillary number, Ca, and the\nconstriction shape. We estimate the deformation by measuring the variation of\nthe three-dimensional surface area and a series of alternative quantities\neasier to extract from experiments. These are the Taylor parameter, the\nperimeter and the area of the capsule in the spanwise plane. We find that the\nperimeter is the quantity that reproduces the behavior of the three-dimensional\nsurface area the best. We observe that, in general, area-deformation correlated\nquantities grow linearly with Ca, while velocity-correlated quantities saturate\nfor large Ca but display a steeper increase for small Ca. The velocity of the\ncapsule divided by the velocity of the flow displays, surprisingly, two\ndifferent qualitative behaviors for small and large capillary numbers. Finally,\nwe report that longer constrictions and spanwise wall bounded (versus spanwise\nperiodic) domains cause larger deformations and velocities. If the deformation\nand velocity in the spanwise wall bounded domains are rescaled by the initial\nequilibrium deformation and velocity, their behavior is undistinguishable from\nthat in a periodic domain.

When $B>0$, pressure gradients prevent gravitational\ncollapse and provide halo density cores instead of cuspy density profiles, in\nagreement with the observations. The universal rotation curve of logotropic\ndark matter halos is consistent with the observational Burkert profile up to\nthe halo radius. Interestingly, if we assume that all the dark matter halos\nhave the same logotropic temperature $B$, we find that their surface density\n$\\Sigma=\\rho_0 r_h$ is constant.

While numerous experiments have revealed details of\nthe molecular structure and working mechanism of DNAP which consists of both a\npolymerase site and an exonuclease (proofreading) site, there were quite few\ntheoretical studies on the fidelity issue. The first model which explicitly\nconsidered both sites was proposed in 1970s' and the basic idea was widely\naccepted by later models. However, all these models did not systematically and\nrigorously investigate the dominant factor on DNAP fidelity, i.e, the\nhigher-order terminal effects through which the polymerization pathway and the\nproofreading pathway coordinate to achieve high fidelity. In this paper, we\npropose a new and comprehensive kinetic model of DNAP based on some recent\nexperimental observations, which includes previous models as special cases. We\npresent a rigorous and unified treatment of the corresponding steady-state\nkinetic equations of any-order terminal effects, and derive analytical\nexpressions for fidelity in terms of kinetic parameters under bio-relevant\nconditions. These expressions offer new insights on how the the higher-order\nterminal effects contribute substantially to the fidelity in an order-by-order\nway, and also show that the polymerization-and-proofreading mechanism is\ndominated only by very few key parameters.

Here we\ninvestigate the role of downward magnetic pumping near the surface using a\nkinematic Babcock-Leighton model. We find that the pumping causes the poloidal\nfield to become predominately radial in the near-surface shear layer, which\nallows the negative radial shear to effectively act on the radial field to\nproduce a toroidal field. We observe a clear equatorward migration of the\ntoroidal field at low latitudes as a consequence of the dynamo wave even when\nthere is no meridional flow in the deep convection zone. Both the dynamo wave\nand the flux transport type solutions are thus able to reproduce some of the\nobserved features of the solar cycle, including the 11-year periodicity. The\nmain difference between the two types of solutions is the strength of the\nBabcock-Leighton source required to produce the dynamo action. A second\nconsequence of the magnetic pumping is that it suppresses the diffusion of\nfields through the surface, which helps to allow an 11-year cycle at\n(moderately) larger values of magnetic diffusivity than have previously been\nused.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ; minor revision and a new figure\n  added in this version!"]}]

The optimal policy is proved to have a threshold-based\nstructure with respect to a derived offloading priority function, which yields\npriorities for users according to their channel gains and local computing\nenergy consumption. As a result, users with priorities above and below a given\nthreshold perform complete and minimum offloading, respectively. Moreover, for\nthe cloud with finite capacity, a sub-optimal resource-allocation algorithm is\nproposed to reduce the computation complexity for computing the threshold.\nNext, we consider the OFDMA MECO system, for which the optimal resource\nallocation is formulated as a non-convex mixed-integer problem. To solve this\nchallenging problem and characterize its policy structure, a sub-optimal\nlow-complexity algorithm is proposed by transforming the OFDMA problem to its\nTDMA counterpart.

The\ninterplay between motor processivity, structural properties of filamentous\nnetwork, and transition rates between the two states of motility drastically\nchanges the dynamics: multiple transitions between different types of anomalous\ndiffusive dynamics occur and the crossover time to the asymptotic diffusive or\nballistic motion varies by several orders of magnitude. We map out the phase\ndiagrams in the space of transition rates, and address the role of initial\nconditions of motion on the resulting dynamics.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 6 figures"]}]

After demonstrating the high computational complexity of the ML\nestimator, a median based (MB) estimator with proved low complexity is then\nproposed. Furthermore, the estimation accuracy of the MB estimation is\ntheoretically characterized. By comparing the ML estimator and the MB estimator\nfrom the aspects of the computational complexity as well as the estimation\naccuracy, both advantages and disadvantages of two estimators are revealed.\nNumerical results show that the estimation errors of the ML estimator and the\nMB estimator can be as small as $0.6$ dB and $0.7$ dB, respectively.\n","Comment: Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Communications"]}]

Following this idea, we\npropose to exploit the structure sparsity of visual features in skeletal human\naction recognition, and compute sparse inverse covariance estimate (SICE) as\nfeature representation. We discuss the advantage of this new representation on\ndealing with small sample, high dimensionality, and modelling capability.\nFurthermore, utilising the monotonicity property of SICE, we efficiently\ngenerate a hierarchy of SICE matrices to characterise the structure of visual\nfeatures at different sparsity levels, and two discriminative learning\nalgorithms are then developed to adaptively integrate them to perform\nrecognition. As demonstrated by extensive experiments, the proposed\nrepresentation leads to significantly improved recognition performance over the\nstate-of-the-art comparable methods.

For crystalline materials, the locations of atoms\nhave spatial symmetries, forming a few regular lattice groups.

The inclusions respond to\nthese forces and torques by translations and rotations against the surrounding\nelastic matrix. This leads to elastic matrix deformations, and in turn results\nin mutual long-ranged matrix-mediated interactions between the inclusions.\nAdapting a well-known approach from low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics, we\nexplicitly calculate the displacements and rotations of the inclusions from the\nexternally imposed or induced forces and torques.

For each available energy the beam\ndeposition in water medium is characterized by the dose deposition. Using an\nalpha--stable distribution methodology each beam with a nominal energy $E$ is\ncharacterized by the lateral spread at depth $z$: $S(z;\\alpha,\\gamma,E)$ and a\ntotal energy deposition $I_D(z)$.

New quadratic and linear binary\nprogramming models are developed to compute the frustration index exactly.\nUsing the Gurobi solver, we evaluate the frustration index on real-world and\nsynthetic datasets. The synthetic data involves Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi networks,\nBarab\\'{a}si-Albert networks, and specially structured random graphs. We also\nuse well-known datasets from the sociology literature, such as signed networks\ninferred from students' choice and rejection as well as datasets from the\nbiology literature including gene regulatory networks. We also provide some\nresults on the frustration index of a political network of countries over time.\nThe results show that exact values of the frustration index can be efficiently\ncomputed using our suggested optimisation models. We find that most real-world\nsocial networks and some biological networks exhibit a relatively low level of\nfrustration which indicates that they are close to balanced.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables"]}]

Although several background\nsubtraction and foreground detection have been proposed recently, no\ntraditional algorithm today still seem to be able to simultaneously address all\nthe key challenges of illumination variation, dynamic camera motion, cluttered\nbackground and occlusion. This limitation can be attributed to the lack of\nsystematic investigation concerning the role and importance of features within\nbackground modeling and foreground detection.

A novel and unique feature of our methodology is that the evolving\nnetwork model remembers the data from which it was conceived from, in the sense\nthat it evolves to almost regenerate the patient data even upon presenting an\narbitrary initial condition to it. We illustrate a potential utility of our\nmethodology by constructing an evolving network from clinical data that aids in\nidentifying an approximate seizure focus -- nodes in such a theoretically\ndetermined seizure focus are outgoing hubs that apparently act as spreaders of\nseizures. We also point out the efficacy of removal of such spreaders in\nlimiting seizures.\n","Comment: To Appear in Neural Computation"]}]

Equiprobable selection can be used with several greedy\nalgorithms for dictionary learning to ensure that all atoms adapt during\ntraining and that no particular atom is more likely to take part in the linear\ncombination on average. We demonstrate via simulation experiments that\ndictionary learning with equiprobable selection results in higher entropy of\nthe sparse representation and lower reconstruction and denoising errors, both\nin the case of ordinary matching pursuit and orthogonal matching pursuit with\nshift-invariant dictionaries. Furthermore, we show that the computational costs\nof the matching pursuits are lower with equiprobable selection, leading to\nfaster and more accurate dictionary learning algorithms.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 8 figures"]}]

Two approaches were recently\nproposed to address such issue: crowdsourcing and RSS radiomap prediction based\non either interpolation or propagation channel model fitting from a small set\nof measurements. RSS prediction promises better positioning accuracy when\ncompared to crowdsourcing but no systematic analysis of the impact of system\nparameters on positioning accuracy is available. This paper fills this gap by\nintroducing ViFi, an indoor positioning system that relies on RSS prediction\nbased on Multi-Wall Multi-Floor (MWMF) propagation model to generate a discrete\nRSS radiomap (virtual fingerprints). The ViFi system is subject to an extensive\nexperimental analysis in order to address the role of all relevant system\nparameters. Experimental results obtained in two different testbeds show that\nthe introduction of virtual fingerprints allows reduction by a factor of 10 of\nthe number of measurements, without significant loss in positioning accuracy.\nThe use of two testbeds also allows to derive general guidelines for the design\nand the implementation of a virtual fingerprinting system.\n"]}]
