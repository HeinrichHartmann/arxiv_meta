Herein, we develop the\nmathematical treatment to rigorously evaluate the tail integrals using CGLQ and\ndiscuss and address the specific issues posed to the CGLQ method when\nanisotropic, layered media are present. To empirically demonstrate the CGLQ\nalgorithm's computational efficiency, versatility, and accuracy, we perform a\nconvergence analysis along with two case studies related to modeling of\nelectromagnetic resistivity tools employed in geophysical prospection of\nlayered, anisotropic Earth media and validating the ability of isoimpedance\nsubstrates to enhance the radiation performance of planar antennas placed in\nclose proximity to metallic ground planes.\n","Comment: The published version of this manuscript, along with copyright\n  information, can be found using the provided DOI"]}]

The present work extends the DL\ndust modelling carried out on nearby galaxies using Herschel and Spitzer data\nto Galactic dust emission. We employ the DL dust model to generate maps of the\ndust mass surface density, the optical extinction Av, and the starlight\nintensity parametrized by Umin. The DL model reproduces the observed spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) satisfactorily over most of the sky, with small\ndeviations in the inner Galactic disk and in low ecliptic latitude areas. We\ncompare the DL optical extinction Av for the diffuse interstellar medium with\noptical estimates for 2 10^5 quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) observed in the Sloan\ndigital sky survey. The DL Av estimates are larger than those determined\ntowards QSOs by a factor of about 2, which depends on Umin. The DL fitting\nparameter Umin, effectively determined by the wavelength where the SED peaks,\nappears to trace variations in the far-IR opacity of the dust grains per unit\nAv, and not only in the starlight intensity. To circumvent the model\ndeficiency, we propose an empirical renormalization of the DL Av estimate,\ndependent of Umin, which compensates for the systematic differences found with\nQSO observations. This renormalization also brings into agreement the DL Av\nestimates with those derived for molecular clouds from the near-IR colours of\nstars in the 2 micron all sky survey. The DL model and the QSOs data are used\nto compress the spectral information in the Planck and IRAS observations for\nthe diffuse ISM to a family of 20 SEDs normalized per Av, parameterized by\nUmin, which may be used to test and empirically calibrate dust models.\n","Comment: Final version that has appeared in A&A"]}]

The functional architecture is thought to play a\ncentral role in this task, by encoding efficiently complex stimuli and\nfacilitating higher level processing. In the early visual cortex of higher\nmammals, information is processed within functional maps whose layout is\nthought to underlie visual perception. The possible principles underlying the\ntopology of the different maps, as well as the role of a specific functional\narchitecture on information processing, is however poorly understood. We\ndemonstrate mathematically here that two natural principles, local exhaustivity\nof representation and parsimony, would constrain the orientation and spatial\nfrequency maps to display co-located singularities around which the orientation\nis organized as a pinwheel and spatial frequency as a dipole. This observation\nis perfectly in line with new optical imaging data on the cat visual cortex we\nanalyze in a companion paper. Here we further focus on the theoretical\nimplications of this structure. Using a computational model, we show that this\narchitecture allows a trade-off in the local perception of orientation and\nspatial frequency, but this would occur for sharper selectivity than the tuning\nwidth reported in the literature. We therefore re-examined physiological data\nand show that indeed the spatial frequency selectivity substantially sharpens\nnear maps singularities, bringing to the prediction that the system tends to\noptimize balanced detection between different attributes.

Furthermore, combining our\nmethods with a small number of iterations of a single-batch backpropagation\nmethod can significantly reduce the number of hidden-units required to achieve\na particular performance.

The resulting dewetting transitions are often impeded by large\nkinetic barriers. According to macroscopic theory, such barriers arise from the\nfree energy required to nucleate a critical vapor tube that spans the region\nbetween two hydrophobic surfaces - tubes with smaller radii collapse, whereas\nlarger ones grow to dry the entire confined region. Using extensive molecular\nsimulations of water between two nanoscopic hydrophobic surfaces, in\nconjunction with advanced sampling techniques, here we show that for\ninter-surface separations that thermodynamically favor dewetting, the barrier\nto dewetting does not correspond to the formation of a (classical) critical\nvapor tube. Instead, it corresponds to an abrupt transition from an isolated\ncavity adjacent to one of the confining surfaces to a gap-spanning vapor tube\nthat is already larger than the critical vapor tube anticipated by macroscopic\ntheory. Correspondingly, the barrier to dewetting is also smaller than the\nclassical expectation. We show that the peculiar nature of water density\nfluctuations adjacent to extended hydrophobic surfaces - namely, the enhanced\nlikelihood of observing low-density fluctuations relative to Gaussian\nstatistics - facilitates this non-classical behavior. By stabilizing isolated\ncavities relative to vapor tubes, enhanced water density fluctuations thus\nstabilize novel pathways, which circumvent the classical barriers and offer\ndiminished resistance to dewetting.

It is shown that suitable linear chemical potential waves can, in\nfact, be manufactured by tuning to criticality conventional reaction-diffusion\nwith a small number substances. Min oscillations in E. coli are cited as\nprecedent resonant length measurement using chemical potential waves analogous\nto laser detection. Mitotic structures in eucaryotes are identified as\ncandidates for such an effect at higher frequency. The engineering principle is\nshown to be very general and functionally the same as that used by hearing\norgans.\n  PNAS Significance Statement: This paper invokes physical principles to\naddress the question of how living things might use reaction-diffusion to\nmeasure out and regulate the many thousands of lengths required to make their\nbody parts and internal organs. It argues that two ideas have been missing. One\nis that oscillation is necessary to achieve the necessary design stability and\nplasticity. The other is that the system must be tuned to criticality to\nstabilize the propagation velocity, thus enabling clocks to function as meter\nsticks. The broader significance is twofold: First, a fundamental piece of the\nmachinery of life is probably invisible to present-day biochemical methods\nbecause they are too slow. Second, the simplicity of growth and form identified\na century ago by D'Arcy Thompson is probably a symptom of biological\nengineering strategies, not primitive law.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures, submitted to PNAS"]}]

Thus, after\napplying an external stimuli the system in the LS state after the spin\nswitching reverts to its ground state, whereas the system in the HS state\nremains in the excited state for a long time.

In this work, we study axisymmetric mean flows in rapidly\nand initially uniformly rotating massive stars driven by small amplitude\nnon-axisymmetric $\\kappa$-driven oscillations. We treat them as perturbations\nof second-order of the oscillation amplitudes and derive their governing\nequations as a set of coupled linear ordinary differential equations.

Oscillation-driven mean flows usually have large\namplitudes only in the surface layers. In addition, the kinetic energy of the\ninduced 2-D zonal rotational motions is much larger than that of the meridional\nmotions. In some cases, meridional flows have a complex radial and latitudinal\nstructure. For SPB stars, we find that there are low frequency retrograde\n$g$-modes and $r$-modes that drive mean flows with positive velocity components\nin the radial and azimuthal directions at the stellar surface.

Moreover,\npulsation-driven and rotation-driven meridional flows can have similar\namplitudes.

This principle states that a given excitation can be\ntransformed to a desirable aperture field by inducing suitable electric and\nmagnetic surface currents. Building on this concept, we propose and demonstrate\ncavity-excited HMS antennas, where the single-source cavity excitation is\ndesigned to optimize aperture illumination, while the HMS facilitates the\ncurrent distribution that ensures phase purity of aperture fields. The HMS\nbreaks the coupling between the excitation and radiation spectrum typical to\nstandard partially-reflecting surfaces, allowing tailoring of the aperture\nproperties to produce a desirable radiation pattern.

We consider a scenario where sensors need to identify\nwhether a given event has occurred based on its periodic, noisy, observations\nof a given signal. Such information about the signal needs to be sent to a\nfusion center that decides about the actual state at that specific observation\ntime. The communication links -- single- or multi-hop -- are modeled as binary\nsymmetric channels, which may have different error probabilities. The decision\nat the fusion center is based on OR, AND, K-OUT-OF-N and MAJORITY Boolean\noperations on the received signals associated to individual sensor\nobservations. We derive closed-form equations for the average decision error\nprobability as a function of the system parameters (e.g. number of sensors and\nhops) and the input signal characterization. Our analyses show the best\ndecision rule is closely related to the frequency that the observed events\noccur and the number of sensors. In our numerical example, we show that the AND\nrule outperforms MAJORITY if such an event is rare and there is only a handful\nnumber of sensors. Conversely, if there is a large number of sensors or more\nevenly distributed event occurrences, the MAJORITY is the best choice. We\nfurther show that, while the error probability using the MAJORITY rule\nasymptotically goes to 0 with increasing number of sensors, it is also more\nsusceptible to higher channel error probabilities.\n"]}]

Here we describe the first two accurate and efficient algorithms to\ncompute the conformational entropy for RNA secondary structures, with respect\nto the Turner energy model, where free energy parameters are determined from UV\naborption experiments. An algorithm to compute the derivational entropy for RNA\nsecondary structures had previously been introduced, using stochastic context\nfree grammars (SCFGs). However, the numerical value of derivational entropy\ndepends heavily on the chosen context free grammar and on the training set used\nto estimate rule probabilities. Using data from the Rfam database, we determine\nthat both of our thermodynamic methods, which agree in numerical value, are\nsubstantially faster than the SCFG method. Thermodynamic structural entropy is\nmuch smaller than derivational entropy, and the correlation between\nlength-normalized thermodynamic entropy and derivational entropy is moderately\nweak to poor. In applications, we plot the structural entropy as a function of\ntemperature for known thermoswitches, determine that the correlation between\nhammerhead ribozyme cleavage activity and total free energy is improved by\nincluding an additional free energy term arising from conformational entropy,\nand plot the structural entropy of windows of the HIV-1 genome. Our software\nRNAentropy can compute structural entropy for any user-specified temperature,\nand supports both the Turner'99 and Turner'04 energy parameters.

Most studies so far have focused on large\ngalaxies, but dwarfs might also experience such events, since the halo mass\nfunction is scale-free in the concordance cosmological model. Notably, because\nof their low mass, most of their interactions will be with dark satellites. In\nthis paper we follow the evolution of gas-rich disky dwarf galaxies as they\nexperience a minor merger with a dark satellite. We aim to characterize the\neffects of such an interaction on the dwarf's star formation, morphology, and\nkinematical properties. We performed a suite of carefully set-up hydrodynamical\nsimulations of dwarf galaxies that include dark matter, gas, and stars merging\nwith a satellite consisting solely of dark matter. For the host system we vary\nthe gas fraction, disk size and thickness, halo mass, and concentration, while\nwe explore different masses, concentrations, and orbits for the satellite. We\nfind that the interactions cause strong starbursts of both short and long\nduration in the dwarfs. Their star formation rates increase by factors of a few\nto 10 or more. They are strongest for systems with extended gas disks and high\ngas fractions merging with a high-concentration satellite on a planar, radial\norbit. In contrast to analogous simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies, many of\nthe systems experience strong morphological changes and become spheroidal even\nin the presence of significant amounts of gas. The simulated systems compare\nremarkably well with the observational properties of a large selection of\nirregular dwarf galaxies and blue compact dwarfs.

These were exacerbated by the population's disenchantment towards\nits highly fragmented party system, which is composed by a very large number of\npolitical parties.

In this work I propose ARRANGE, a dAta dRiven method foR Assessing and\nreduciNG party fragmEntation in a country. ARRANGE uses as input the roll call\ndata for congress votes on bills and amendments as a proxy for political\npreferences and ideology. With that, ARRANGE finds the minimum number of\nparties required to house all congressmen without decreasing party discipline.\nWhen applied to Brazil's historical roll call data, ARRANGE was able to\ngenerate 23 distinct configurations that, compared with the status quo, have\n(i) a significant smaller number of parties, (ii) a higher discipline of\npartisans towards their parties and (iii) a more even distribution of partisans\ninto parties.

In contrast to previous implementations, a\nlarge detuning of more than 200 times the natural linewidth of the transition\nis used. This approach renders STIRAP suitable for atoms in which resonant\nlaser fields would populate fluorescing excited states and thus impede the\nSTIRAP process. We use the technique to measure the wavefunction overlap of\nexcited motional states with the motional ground state. This is an important\napplication for photon recoil spectroscopy and other force sensing applications\nthat utilize the high sensitivity of the motional state of trapped ions to\nexternal fields. Furthermore, a determination of the ground state population\nenables a simple measurement of the ion's temperature.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 7 figures"]}]

With\nour microscopic E1 PSFs in the EMPIRE 3.1 code, the following radiative nuclear\nreaction characteristics have been calculated for several stable and unstable\neven-even Sn and Ni isotopes: 1) neutron capture cross sections, 2)\ncorresponding neutron capture gamma-spectra, 3) average radiative widths of\nneutron resonances.

In all the considered\nproperties, including the recent experimental data for PSF in Sn isotopes, the\nPC contributions turned out to be significant, as compared with the QRPA one,\nand necessary to explain the available experimental data.

A mirror is mounted opposite each MCP-PMT\non the far side of the detector cylinder, effectively doubling the\nphoto-detection efficiency and providing a time-resolved image of the Cherenkov\nlight on the opposing wall. Each MCP-PMT is coupled to an anode readout\nconsisting of thirty 50 Ohm microstrips. A 180-channel data acquisition system\ndigitizes the MCP-PMT signals on one end of the microstrips using the PSEC4\nwaveform sampling-and-digitizing chip operating at a sampling rate of\n10.24~Gigasamples-per-second.

They provided a wealth of observational data, and more\nprecisely oscillation spectra, which have been (and are still) exploited to\ninfer the internal structure of stars. While an adiabatic approach is often\nsufficient to get information on the stellar equilibrium structures it is not\nsufficient to get a full understanding of the physics of the oscillation.\nIndeed, it does not permit one to answer some fundamental questions about the\noscillations, such as: What are the physical mechanisms responsible for the\npulsations inside stars? What determines the amplitudes? To what extent the\nadiabatic approximation is valid? All these questions can only be addressed by\nconsidering the energy exchanges between the oscillations and the surrounding\nmedium.\n  This lecture therefore aims at considering the energetical aspects of stellar\npulsations with particular emphasis on the driving and damping mechanisms. To\nthis end, the full non-adiabatic equations are introduced and thoroughly\ndiscussed. Two types of pulsation are distinguished, namely the self-excited\noscillations that result from an instability and the solar-like oscillations\nthat result from a balance between driving and damping by turbulent convection.\nFor each type, the main physical principles are presented and illustrated using\nrecent observations obtained with the ultra-high precision photometry\nspace-borne missions (MOST, CoRoT and Kepler). Finally, we consider in detail\nthe physics of scaling relations, which relates the seismic global indices with\nthe global stellar parameters and gave birth to the development of statistical\n(or ensemble) asteroseismology.

We suggest that they must be considered as one and the same\nfamily and that their different names only stem from historical reasons.\nIndeed, these two families have as well very similar mass-function\ndistributions, corresponding to companions with masses in the range 0.5 - 0.7\nMsun, indicative of white-dwarf companions, adopting 0.8 - 0.9 Msun for the\nprimary component. This result confirms that CH and CEMP-s stars obey the same\nmass-transfer scenario as their higher-metallicity analogs, the barium stars.\nThe P - e diagrams of barium, CH and CEMP-s stars are indeed very similar. They\nreveal two different groups of systems: one with short orbital periods (P <\n1000 d) and mostly circular or almost circular orbits, and another with\nlonger-period and eccentric (e > 0.1) orbits.\n","Comment: Accepted in Astronomy & Astrophysics"]}]

I\nexplain how this tension can be resolved by splitting the gauge field into\ncharged constituents, and I argue that this leads to a new argument for the\n\"principle of completeness\", which states that the charge lattice of a gauge\ntheory coupled to gravity must be fully populated. I also claim that it leads\nto a new motivation for (and a clarification of) the \"weak gravity conjecture\",\nwhich I interpret as a strengthening of this principle. This setup gives a\nsimple example of a situation where describing low-energy bulk physics in CFT\nlanguage requires knowledge of high-energy bulk physics. This contradicts to\nsome extent the notion of \"effective conformal field theory\", but in fact is an\nexpected feature of the resolution of the black hole information problem.

Observations and surveys have shown that the number of sources\nincreases for near galaxies and at the low-luminosity regime (the so-called\nLLAGNs).

We present mid-infrared 11.5\nmicrons imaging of the LLAGN galaxy NGC835 obtained with the instrument\nCanariCam in the Gran Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC), archival Spitzer/IRS\nspectroscopy, and archival Chandra data observed in 2000, 2008, and 2013.

We obtained a nuclear flux of F(11.5 microns) ~18 mJy, whereas the\nextended emission accounts for 90% of the total flux within the 6 arcsec. This\nmeans that the low angular resolution (~4 arcsec) IRS spectrum is dominated by\nthis extended emission and not by the AGN, clearly seen in the Spitzer/IRS\nspectrum. Although the extended soft X-ray emission shows some resemblance with\nthat of the mid-infrared, the knots seen at X-rays are mostly located in the\ninner side of this mid-infrared emission. The nuclear X-ray spectrum of the\nsource has undergone a spectral change between 2000/2008 and 2013.

We also perform dynamical\nanalyses of such model and found that without introducing the k-essence\nLagrangian, the graviton mass can be responsible for both dark contents of the\nuniverse, namely dark energy that drives the accelerated expansion of the\nuniverse and non-relativistic matter that plays the role of dark matter.\nMoreover, by including the k-essence Lagrangian, we found that it is possible\nto alleviate the so-called cosmic coincidence problem.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 6 figures.

From previous studies, it has drawn attention as being\nthe coldest (~600K) companion ever directly imaged around a neighboring star.\nWe present new high-contrast data obtained during the commissioning of the\nSPHERE instrument at the VLT. The data was obtained in Y-, J-, H-, and Ks-bands\nwith the dual-band imaging (DBI) mode of IRDIS, providing a broad coverage of\nthe full near-infrared (near-IR) range at higher contrast and better spectral\nsampling than previously reported. In this new set of high-quality data, we\nreport the re-detection of the companion, as well as the first detection of a\nnew candidate closer-in to the star. We use the new 8 photometric points for an\nextended comparison of GJ758 B with empirical objects and 4 families of\natmospheric models. From comparison to empirical object, we estimate a T8\nspectral type, but none of the comparison object can accurately represent the\nobserved near-IR fluxes of GJ758 B.

The photometry of the new candidate\ncompanion is broadly consistent with L-type objects, but a second epoch with\nimproved photometry is necessary to clarify its status. The new astrometry of\nGJ758 B shows a significant proper motion since the last epoch. We use this\nresult to improve the determination of the orbital characteristics using two\nfitting approaches, Least-Square Monte Carlo and Markov Chain Monte Carlo.\nFinally, we analyze the sensitivity of our data to additional closer-in\ncompanions and reject the possibility of other massive brown dwarf companions\ndown to 4-5 AU.

First, Mazeh and coworkers\nrecently used a new technique -- based on the amplitude of starspot-induced\nphotometric variability -- to conclude that spin-orbit alignment is common even\nfor relatively long-period planets, which would not be expected if tides were\nresponsible. We re-examine the data and find a statistically significant\ncorrelation between photometric variability and planetary orbital period that\nis qualitatively consistent with tidal interactions. However it is still\ndifficult to explain quantitatively, as it would require tides to be effective\nfor periods as long as tens of days. Second, Rogers and Lin argued against a\nparticular theory for tidal re-alignment by showing that initially retrograde\nsystems would fail to be re-aligned, in contradiction with the observed\nprevalence of prograde systems. We investigate a simple model that overcomes\nthis problem by taking into account the dissipation of inertial waves and the\nequilibrium tide, as well as magnetic braking. We identify a region of\nparameter space where re-alignment can be achieved, but it only works for\nclose-in giant planets, and requires some fine tuning.

Thus, the global water depletion of the inner Solar System is\npuzling. We show that, even if the inner disk becomes cold, there cannot be\ndirect condensation of water. This is because the snowline moves towards the\nSun more slowly than the gas itself. The appearance of ice in a range of\nheliocentric distances swept by the snowline can only be due to the radial\ndrift of icy particles from the outer disk. However, if a sufficiently massive\nplanet is present, the radial drift of particles is interrupted, because the\ndisk acquires a superKeplerian rotation just outside of the planetary orbit.\nFrom this result, we propose that the precursor of Jupiter achieved about 20\nEarth masses when the snowline was still around 3 AU. This effectively\nfossilized the snowline at that location. Although cooling, the disk inside of\nthe Jovian orbit remained ice-depleted because the flow of icy particles from\nthe outer system was intercepted by the planet. This scenario predicts that\nplanetary systems without giant planets should be much more rich in water in\ntheir inner regions than our system. We also show that the inner edge of the\nplanetesimal disk at 0.7AU, required in terrestrial planet formation models to\nexplain the small mass of Mercury and the absence of planets inside of its\norbit, could be due to the silicate condensation line, fossilized at the end of\nthe phase of streaming instability that generated the planetesimal seeds.

The radiation comes from low energy electrons (~1-30 MeV)\nwhich map a broad region of Jupiter's inner magnetosphere. Methods (see article\nfor complete abstract) Results. The first resolved images of Jupiter's\nradiation belts at 127-172 MHz are obtained along with total integrated flux\ndensities. They are compared with previous observations at higher frequencies\nand show a larger extent of the synchrotron emission source (>=4 $R_J$).

Both the\nstratospheric temperature and composition are affected by this latitudinally\nvarying insolation along the seasons. The thermal structure is controlled and\nregulated by the amount of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere, which act as\nabsorbers and coolants from the UV to the far-IR spectral range, and this\nstructure influences the amount of hydrocarbons. We study here the feedback\nbetween the chemical composition and the thermal structure by coupling a\nlatitudinal and seasonal photochemical model with a radiative seasonal model.\nOur results show that the seasonal temperature peak in the higher stratosphere,\nassociated with the seasonal increase of insolation, is shifted earlier than\nthe maximum insolation peak. This shift is increased with increasing latitudes\nand is caused by the low amount of stratospheric coolants in the spring season.\nAt 80$^{\\circ}$ in both hemispheres, the temperature peak at 1d-2mbar is seen\nto occur half a season earlier than was previously predicted by radiative\nseasonal models that assumed spatially and temporally uniform distribution of\ncoolants. This shift progressively decreases with increasing pressure, up to\naround the 0.5mbar pressure level where it vanishes. However, the thermal field\nhas a small feedback on the abundance distributions. This feedback modifies the\npredicted equator-to-pole temperature gradient.

In the presence of external pressure,\nthe pressure gradient set up within a self-gravitating isothermal cloud leads\nto a non-uniform density distribution. Thus the local environment of a cloud\ninfluences its internal structure. In the simple equilibrium model, the\nfraction of gas at high density in the cloud interior is determined simply by\nthe cloud surface density, which is itself inherited from the pressure in the\nimmediate surroundings. This idea is tested using measurements of the\nproperties of local clouds, which are found to show remarkable agreement with\nthe simple equilibrium model.

If the\nstar formation efficiency was around 30 per cent and the gas expulsion happened\non the crossing timescale, this process could expel preferentially stars born\nwith the chemical composition of the proto-cluster gas, while stars with\nspecial composition born in the centre would remain bound. Recently, a sample\nof extragalactic, gas-free, young massive clusters has been identified that has\nthe potential to test the conditions for gas expulsion. We compute a large\nnumber of thin shell models, and calculate if the Rayleigh-Taylor instability\nis able to disrupt the shell before it reaches the escape speed. We show that\nthe success of gas expulsion depends on the compactness index of a star cluster\nC5, proportionate to stellar mass over half-mass radius. For given C5, a\ncertain critical, local star formation efficiency is required to remove the\nrest of the gas. Common stellar feedback processes may not lead to gas\nexpulsion with significant loss of stars above C5 = 1. Considering pulsar winds\nand hypernovae, the limit increases to C5 = 30. If successful, gas expulsion\ngenerally takes place on the crossing timescale. Some observed young massive\nclusters have 1 < C5 < 10 and are gas-free at 10 Myr. This suggests that gas\nexpulsion does not affect their stellar mass significantly, unless powerful\npulsar winds and hypernovae are common in such objects. By comparison to\nobservations, we show that C5 is a better predictor for the expression of\nmultiple populations than stellar mass. The best separation between star\nclusters with and without multiple populations is achieved by a stellar\nwinds-based gas expulsion model, where gas expulsion would occur exclusively in\nstar clusters without multiple populations.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables, accepted by A&A"]}]

We\npresent a series of two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the\nrole of the RWI in DZs, including its impact on the long-term evolution of the\ndisc and its morphology. The nonlinear RWI can generate Reynolds stresses\n(effective $\\alpha$ parameter) as large as $0.01 - 0.05$ in the DZ, helping to\nsustain quasi-steady accretion throughout the disc. It also produces novel disc\nmorphologies, including azimuthal asymmetries with $m = 1, 2$, and atypical\nvortex shapes. The angular momentum transport strength and morphology are most\nsensitive to two parameters: the radial extent of the DZ and the disc\nviscosity. The largest Reynolds stresses are produced when the radial extent of\nthe DZ is less than its distance to the central star. Such narrow DZs lead to a\nsingle vortex or two coherent antipodal vortices in the quasi-steady state. The\nedges of wider DZs evolve separately, resulting in two independent vortices and\nreduced angular momentum transport efficiency.

Putting together the available data of\nnon-interacting, non-cluster galaxies with known large-scale magnetic fields,\nwe find a tight correlation between the integrated polarized flux density,\nS(PI), and the rotation speed, v(rot), of galaxies. This leads to an almost\nlinear correlation between the large-scale magnetic field B and v(rot),\nassuming that the number of cosmic ray electrons is proportional to the star\nformation rate, and a super-linear correlation assuming equipartition between\nmagnetic fields and cosmic rays. This correlation cannot be attributed to an\nactive linear alpha-Omega dynamo, as no correlation holds with global shear or\nangular speed. It indicates instead a coupling between the large-scale magnetic\nfield and the dynamical mass of the galaxies, B ~ M^(0.25-0.4). Hence, faster\nrotating and/or more massive galaxies have stronger large-scale magnetic\nfields. The observed B-v(rot) correlation shows that the anisotropic turbulent\nmagnetic field dominates B in fast rotating galaxies as the turbulent magnetic\nfield, coupled with gas, is enhanced and ordered due to the strong gas\ncompression and/or local shear in these systems.

We find that the abundances of refractory and moderately volatile\nelements are nearly independent of formation models, and that all the models\ncould reproduce the abundances of these elements of the Earth. The abundances\nof atmophile elements, on the other hand, depend on the scattering rate of icy\nplanetesimals into the inner disc as well as the mixing rate of the inner\nplanetesimal disc. For the classical formation model, neither of these\nmechanisms are efficient and the accretion of atmophile elements during the\nfinal assembly of terrestrial planets appears to be difficult. For the Grand\nTack model, both of these mechanisms are efficient, which leads to a relatively\nuniform accretion of atmophile elements in the inner disc. It is also possible\nto have a \"hybrid\" scenario where the mixing is not very efficient but the\nscattering is efficient. The abundances of atmophile elements in this case\nincreases with orbital radii. Such a scenario may occur in some of the\nextrasolar planetary systems which are not accompanied by giant planets or\nthose without strong perturbations from giants.

However, we\nidentify an inversion in the parallel ordering of metallicity, kinematics and\ncharacteristic length scale in the two most metal rich subpopulations, which\ntherefore do not contribute to a global negative chemical gradient. Contrary to\ncommon trends in the chemical properties with radius, the metal richest\npopulation is more extended and mildly kinematically hotter than the main\ncomponent of intermediate metallicity.

We therefore find three important conclusions: (1)\nAlfv\\'enic waves, propagating from the corona to the chromosphere, are capable\nof heating the upper chromosphere and the corona, (2) the atmospheric response\nto heating due to the dissipation of Alfv\\'enic waves can be strikingly similar\nto heating by an electron beam, and (3) this heating can produce explosive\nevaporation.\n","Comment: Accepted to ApJL"]}]

We aim to test if the predicted orbits of the planets can explain the\nfeatures of their debris disc, such as eccentricity and sharp inner edge. We\nfirst run dynamical simulations using the predicted planetary parameters of\nRodigas et al., and then numerically search for better parameters. Using a\nmodified N-body code including radiation forces, we perform simulations over a\nbroad range of planet parameters and compare synthetics images from our\nsimulations to the observations. We find that the observational features of HD\n202628 can be reproduced with a planet five times smaller than expected,\nlocated 30 AU beyond the predicted value, while the best match for HD 207129 is\nfor a planet located 5-10 AU beyond the predicted location with a smaller\neccentricity. We conclude that the predictions of Rodigas et al. provide a good\nstarting point but should be complemented by numerical simulations.\n","Comment: 15 Pages, 8 Figures, Accepted in MNRAS"]}]

Thus knees could be precursors of\nperiodic flares, which can then be predicted, followed up and better modelled.\nAnalytical estimates in the black hole mass range $10^5-10^8 \\rm M_{\\rm \\odot}$\nshow that the knee signature is enhanced in the case of black holes of mass\n$10^6-10^7 \\rm M_{\\rm \\odot}$.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables.

The main reason is the well-known boundary\nbias problems that it suffers from, but also its poor behaviour in the long\nright tail that such a density typically exhibits. A natural approach to this\nproblem is to first estimate the density of the logarithm of X, and obtaining\nan estimate of the density of X using standard results on functions of random\nvariables (`back-transformation'). Although intuitive, the basic application of\nthis idea yields very poor results, as was documented earlier in the\nliterature. In this paper, the main reason for this underachievement is\nidentified, and an easy fix is suggested. It is demonstrated that combining the\ntransformation with local likelihood density estimation methods produces very\ngood estimators of R+-supported densities, not only close to the boundary, but\nalso in the right tail. The asymptotic properties of the proposed `local\nlikelihood transformation kernel density estimators' are derived for a generic\ntransformation, not only for the logarithm, which allows one to consider other\ntransformations as well. One of them, called the `probex' transformation, is\ngiven more focus. Finally, the excellent behaviour of those estimators in\npractice is evidenced through a comprehensive simulation study and the analysis\nof several real data sets.

The\nidea is to construct a deterministic coupling---i.e., a transport map---between\na complex \"target\" probability measure of interest and a simpler reference\nmeasure. Given a transport map, one can generate arbitrarily many independent\nand unweighted samples from the target simply by pushing forward reference\nsamples through the map. We consider two different and complementary scenarios:\nfirst, when only evaluations of the unnormalized target density are available,\nand second, when the target distribution is known only through a finite\ncollection of samples. We show that in both settings the desired transports can\nbe characterized as the solutions of variational problems. We then address\npractical issues associated with the optimization--based construction of\ntransports: choosing finite-dimensional parameterizations of the map, enforcing\nmonotonicity, quantifying the error of approximate transports, and refining\napproximate transports by enriching the corresponding approximation spaces.\nApproximate transports can also be used to \"Gaussianize\" complex distributions\nand thus precondition conventional asymptotically exact sampling schemes. We\nplace the measure transport approach in broader context, describing connections\nwith other optimization--based samplers, with inference and density estimation\nschemes using optimal transport, and with alternative transformation--based\napproaches to simulation. We also sketch current work aimed at the construction\nof transport maps in high dimensions, exploiting essential features of the\ntarget distribution (e.g., conditional independence, low-rank structure).

The paper focuses on binary- input\nadditive-white Gaussian noise (BI-AWGN) channels but also demonstrates that the\nnormal approximation works well on examples of fading channels as well as\nhigh-SNR AWGN channels that require larger QAM constellations. The paper\nexplores both variable-length feedback codes with termination (VLFT) and the\nmore practical variable length feedback (VLF) codes without termination that\nrequire no assumption of noiseless transmitter confirmation. For VLF we\nconsider both a two-phase scheme and CRC-based scheme.\n"]}]

To study what benefits can ensue from rhythmic gene expression or\nposttranslational modification of enzymes, I propose a theory of optimal enzyme\nrhythms in periodic or static environments. The theory is based on kinetic\nmetabolic models with predefined metabolic objectives, scores the effects of\nharmonic enzyme oscillations, and determines amplitudes and phase shifts that\nmaximise cell fitness. In an expansion around optimal steady states, the\noptimal enzyme profiles can be computed by solving a quadratic optimality\nproblem.

Optimal enzyme profiles are not passively adapted to existing substrate\nrhythms, but shape them actively to create opportunities for further fitness\nadvantage: in doing so, they reflect the dynamic effects that enzymes can exert\nin the network. The proposed theory combines the dynamics and economics of\nmetabolic systems and shows how optimal enzyme profiles are shaped by network\nstructure, dynamics, external rhythms, and metabolic objectives.
