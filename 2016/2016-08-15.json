We then adapt several modeling strategies from\nthe causal inference literature to obtain consistent estimation of the\nintervention-specific mean outcome and model-independent contrasts between\ntreatments.

The pressure of light is associated with the momentum of photons, and\nit is usually assumed that both the optical momentum and the radiation-pressure\nforce are naturally aligned with the propagation of light, i.e., its\nwavevector. Here we report the direct observation of an extraordinary optical\nmomentum and force directed perpendicular to the wavevector, and proportional\nto the optical spin (i.e., degree of circular polarization). Such optical force\nwas recently predicted for evanescent waves [7] and other structured fields\n[8].

We measure this unusual transverse momentum using a nano-cantilever\ncapable of femto-Newton resolution, which is immersed in an evanescent optical\nfield above the total-internal-reflecting glass surface. Furthermore, the\ntransverse force we measure exhibits another polarization-dependent\ncontribution determined by the imaginary part of the complex Poynting vector.\nBy revealing new types of optical forces in structured fields, our experimental\nfindings revisit fundamental momentum properties of light and bring a new twist\nto optomechanics.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 3 figures, Supplementary Information"]}]

In this\npaper, novel transmission schemes are proposed for a class of interference\nnetworks that can achieve new trade-off regions between the sum of degrees of\nfreedom (sum-DoF) and CSI feedback delay with distributed and\ntemperately-delayed CSIT. More specifically, a distributed space-time\ninterference alignment (STIA) scheme is proposed for the two-user\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) X channel via a novel precoding method\ncalled Cyclic Zero-padding. The achieved sum-DoFs herein for certain antenna\nconfigurations are greater than the best known sum-DoFs in literature with\ndelayed CSIT. Furthermore, we propose a distributed retrospective interference\nalignment (RIA) scheme that achieves more than 1 sum-DoF for the K-user\nsingle-input single-output (SISO) X network. Finally, we extend the distributed\nSTIA to the MxN user multiple-input single-output (MISO) X network where each\ntransmitter has N-1 antennas and each receiver has a single antenna, yielding\nthe same sum-DoF as that in the global and instantaneous CSIT case.

The coordinate singularity of the FRW patch is identified\nwith the proper time at which the Hilbert space of the causal diamond becomes\ninfinite dimensional. For diamonds much smaller than the AdS radius, RAdS, the\ntime dependent Hamiltonians of HST are the same as those used to describe\nsimilar diamonds in Minkowski space.

Here, we use resonant x-ray scattering to\nmeasure the charge order correlations in electron-doped cuprates (La2-xCexCuO4\nand Nd2-xCexCuO4) and their relationship to antiferromagnetism, pseudogap, and\nsuperconductivity. Detailed measurements of Nd2-xCexCuO4 show that CO is\npresent in the x = 0.059 to 0.166 range, and that its doping dependent\nwavevector is consistent with the separation between straight segments of the\nFermi surface. The CO onset temperature is highest between x = 0.106 and 0.166,\nbut decreases at lower doping levels, indicating that it is not tied to the\nappearance of antiferromagnetic correlations or the pseudogap. Near optimal\ndoping, where the CO wavevector is also consistent with a previously observed\nphonon anomaly, measurements of the CO below and above the superconducting\ntransition temperature, or in a magnetic field, show that the CO is insensitive\nto superconductivity.

At low temperatures, excitons can form a Bose-Einstein condensate\n(BEC), enabling macroscopic phase coherence and superfluidity. An electronic\ndouble layer (EDL), in which two parallel conducting layers are separated by an\ninsulator, is an ideal platform to realize a stable exciton BEC. In an EDL\nunder strong magnetic fields, electron-like and hole-like quasi-particles from\npartially filled Landau levels (LLs) bind into excitons and condense. However,\nin semiconducting double quantum wells, this magnetic-field-induced exciton BEC\nhas been observed only in sub-Kelvin temperatures due to the relatively strong\ndielectric screening and large separation of the EDL. Here we report exciton\ncondensation in bilayer graphene EDL separated by a few atomic layers of\nhexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Driving current in one graphene layer generates\na quantized Hall voltage in the other layer, signifying coherent superfluid\nexciton transport. Owing to the strong Coulomb coupling across the atomically\nthin dielectric, we find that quantum Hall drag in graphene appears at a\ntemperature an order of magnitude higher than previously observed in GaAs EDL.\nThe wide-range tunability of densities and displacement fields enables\nexploration of a rich phase diagram of BEC across Landau levels with different\nfilling factors and internal quantum degrees of freedom.

The energy bands include radio, millimeter, X-ray, and\ngamma-ray. The observations enable us to obtain a complete spectrum of the\nsource over an energy range of 2 - 500 keV. The spectrum shows that GRS\n1758-258 was in its hard state. It is well fitted by the Sunyaev-Titarchuk (ST)\nCompton scattering model. The spectrum is also fit by a power law with an\nexponential cutoff (PLE) plus a soft black-body component. The temperature of\nthe soft component is about 1.2 keV, and the energy flux is less than 1.5% of\nthe total X- and gamma-ray flux. The deduced hydrogen column density is in the\nrange of (0.93 - 2.0) 10^{22} cm^{-2}. No significant iron lines are detected.\nThe radio emission has a flat energy spectrum.

Harmonically spaced quasi-periodic\noscillations (QPOs) are observed in the power spectra. The phase lags between\nthe hard photons and the soft photons have a flat distribution over a wide\nrange of frequencies.

Tabled logic programming offers a computational\nmechanism that provides a level of declarativity superior to that of Prolog,\nand which has supported successful applications in fields such as parsing,\nprogram analysis, and model checking. In this paper we show how to use tabled\nlogic programming to evaluate queries to abductive frameworks with integrity\nconstraints when these frameworks contain both default and explicit negation.\nThe result is the ability to compute abduction over well-founded semantics with\nexplicit negation and answer sets. Our approach consists of a transformation\nand an evaluation method. The transformation adjoins to each objective literal\n$O$ in a program, an objective literal $not(O)$ along with rules that ensure\nthat $not(O)$ will be true if and only if $O$ is false. We call the resulting\nprogram a {\\em dual} program. The evaluation method, \\wfsmeth, then operates on\nthe dual program. \\wfsmeth{} is sound and complete for evaluating queries to\nabductive frameworks whose entailment method is based on either the\nwell-founded semantics with explicit negation, or on answer sets. Further,\n\\wfsmeth{} is asymptotically as efficient as any known method for either class\nof problems. In addition, when abduction is not desired, \\wfsmeth{} operating\non a dual program provides a novel tabling method for evaluating queries to\nground extended programs whose complexity and termination properties are\nsimilar to those of the best tabling methods for the well-founded semantics.
