The suggested systemic risk measures express systemic risk in terms\nof capital endowments of the financial firms.

We explain the conceptual\nframework and the definition of systemic risk measures, provide an algorithm\nfor their computation, and illustrate their application in numerical case\nstudies.\n  Many systemic risk measures in the literature can be viewed as the minimal\namount of capital that is needed to make the system acceptable after\naggregating individual risks, hence quantify the costs of a bail-out.

The discipline, commonly called femtomagnetism, started\nwith the pioneering experiment by Beaurepaire and coworkers in 1996, who showed\nsubpicosecond demagnetization occurs in magnetic Ni thin films. This finding\nhas motivated extensive research worldwide. All-optical helicity-dependent spin\nswitching (AOS) represents a new frontier in femtomagnetism, where a single\nultrafast laser pulse can permanently switch spin without any assistance from a\nmagnetic field. This review summarizes some of the crucial aspects of this new\ndiscipline: key experimental findings, leading mechanisms, controversial\nissues, and possible future directions. The emphasis is on our latest\ninvestigation. We first develop the all-optical spin switching rule that\ndetermines how the switchability depends on the light helicity. This rule\nallows one to understand microscopically how the spin is reversed and why the\ncircularly polarized light appears more powerful than the linearly polarized\nlight.

The first boundary Harnack principle\ndeals with a $C^{1,1}$ domain $D$ and non-negative functions which are harmonic\nnear the boundary of $D$, while the second one is for a more general domain $D$\nand non-negative functions which are harmonic near the boundary of an interior\nopen subset of $D$.

The zoom simulations confirm that\nstalled haloes do not grow in mass while accreting haloes show a net inflow.\nThe reason is that accreting haloes are located at the nodes of a network of\nthin filaments which feed them. Conversely, each stalled halo lies within a\nprominent filament that is thicker than the halo size. Infalling material from\nthe surroundings becomes part of the filament while matter within it recedes\nfrom the halo. We conclude that assembly bias originates from quenching halo\ngrowth due to tidal forces following the formation of non-linear structures in\nthe cosmic web. Also the internal dynamics of the haloes change: the velocity\nanisotropy profile is biased towards radial (tangential) orbits in accreting\n(stalled) haloes.

The latter, the coherent single\nelectrons source, aims at emitting (injecting) a single electron whose\nwave-function is well defined and controlled to realize further single electron\ncoherent manipulation via quantum gates. The gates are provided by electronic\nbeam-splitters made with Quantum Point Contacts or provided by electronic\nMach-Zehnder and Fabry-Prot interferometers. Here it is important that the\ninjected single electron is the only excitation created in the conductor. The\nfrequency f of injection is not chosen to have a large current, as current\naccuracy is not the goal, but only to get sufficient statistics on the electron\ntransfer events to extract physical information. 1.1 single charge sources for\ncurrent standards The first manipulation of single charges trace back to the\nearly 90's where physicists took advantage of charge quan-tization of a\nsubmicronic metallic island nearly isolated from leads by tunnel barriers.

AGB can be mapped\nusing synthetic aperture radar data (SAR) or passive optical data. However,\nthese data are insensitive to high AGB levels (\\textgreater{}150 Mg/ha, and\n\\textgreater{}300 Mg/ha for P-band), which are commonly found in tropical\nforests. Studies have mapped the rough variations in AGB by combining optical\nand environmental data at regional and global scales. Nevertheless, these maps\ncannot represent local variations in AGB in tropical forests. In this paper, we\nhypothesize that the problem of misrepresenting local variations in AGB and AGB\nestimation with good precision occurs because of both methodological limits\n(signal saturation or dilution bias) and a lack of adequate calibration data in\nthis range of AGB values. We test this hypothesis by developing a calibrated\nregression model to predict variations in high AGB values (mean\n\\textgreater{}300 Mg/ha) in French Guiana by a methodological approach for\nspatial extrapolation with data from the optical geoscience laser altimeter\nsystem (GLAS), forest inventories, radar, optics, and environmental variables\nfor spatial inter-and extrapolation. Given their higher point count, GLAS data\nallow a wider coverage of AGB values. We find that the metrics from GLAS\nfootprints are correlated with field AGB estimations (R 2 =0.54, RMSE=48.3\nMg/ha) with no bias for high values. First, predictive models, including\nremote-sensing, environmental variables and spatial correlation functions,\nallow us to obtain \"wall-to-wall\" AGB maps over French Guiana with an RMSE for\nthe in situ AGB estimates of ~51 Mg/ha and R${}^2$=0.48 at a 1-km grid size. We\nconclude that a calibrated regression model based on GLAS with dependent\nenvironmental data can produce good AGB predictions even for high AGB values if\nthe calibration data fit the AGB range. We also demonstrate that small temporal\nand spatial mismatches between field data and GLAS footprints are not a problem\nfor regional and global calibrated regression models because field data aim to\npredict large and deep tendencies in AGB variations from environmental\ngradients and do not aim to represent high but stochastic and temporally\nlimited variations from forest dynamics. Thus, we advocate including a greater\nvariety of data, even if less precise and shifted, to better represent high AGB\nvalues in global models and to improve the fitting of these models for high\nvalues.\n"]}]

Recordings from small invertebrates like C. elegans are especially\nchallenging because they undergo very large brain motion and deformation during\nanimal movement. Here we present an automated computer vision pipeline to\nreliably track populations of neurons with single neuron resolution in the\nbrain of a freely moving C. elegans undergoing large motion and deformation. 3D\nvolumetric fluorescent images of the animal's brain are straightened, aligned\nand registered, and the locations of neurons in the images are found via\nsegmentation. Each neuron is then assigned an identity using a new\ntime-independent machine-learning approach we call Neuron Registration Vector\nEncoding. In this approach, non-rigid point-set registration is used to match\neach segmented neuron in each volume with a set of reference volumes taken from\nthroughout the recording. The way each neuron matches with the references\ndefines a feature vector which is clustered to assign an identity to each\nneuron in each volume. Finally, thin-plate spline interpolation is used to\ncorrect errors in segmentation and check consistency of assigned identities.\nThe Neuron Registration Vector Encoding approach proposed here is uniquely well\nsuited for tracking neurons in brains undergoing large deformations.
