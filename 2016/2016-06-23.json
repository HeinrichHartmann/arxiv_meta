The flow is driven by osmotic pressure, generated by differences in\nsugar concentration between distal parts of the plant. The phloem is an\nintricate distribution system, and many questions about its regulation and\nstructural diversity remain unanswered. Here, we investigate the phloem\nstructure in the simplest possible geometry: a linear leaf, found, for example,\nin the needles of conifer trees. We measure the phloem structure in four tree\nspecies representing a diverse set of habitats and needle sizes, from 1 cm\n(\\textit{Picea omorika}) to 35 cm (\\textit{Pinus palustris}). We show that the\nphloem shares common traits across these four species and find that the size of\nits conductive elements obeys a power law. We present a minimal model that\naccounts for these common traits and takes into account the transport strategy\nand natural constraints. This minimal model predicts a power law phloem\ndistribution consistent with transport energy minimization, suggesting that\nenergetics are more important than translocation speed at the leaf level.\n","Comment: 4 figures, supplemental information"]}]

Our algorithm\nlearns an arbitrary $(n, k)$-PMD within variation distance $\\epsilon$ using a\nnear-optimal sample size of $\\widetilde{O}_k(1/\\epsilon^2),$ and runs in time\n$\\widetilde{O}_k(1/\\epsilon^2) \\cdot \\log n.$ Previously, no algorithm with a\n$\\mathrm{poly}(1/\\epsilon)$ runtime was known, even for $k=3.$\n  {\\bf Game Theory.} We give the first efficient polynomial-time approximation\nscheme (EPTAS) for computing Nash equilibria in anonymous games. For normalized\nanonymous games with $n$ players and $k$ strategies, our algorithm computes a\nwell-supported $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium in time $n^{O(k^3)} \\cdot\n(k/\\epsilon)^{O(k^3\\log(k/\\epsilon)/\\log\\log(k/\\epsilon))^{k-1}}.$ The best\nprevious algorithm for this problem had running time $n^{(f(k)/\\epsilon)^k},$\nwhere $f(k) = \\Omega(k^{k^2})$, for any $k>2.$\n  {\\bf Statistics.} We prove a multivariate central limit theorem (CLT) that\nrelates an arbitrary PMD to a discretized multivariate Gaussian with the same\nmean and covariance, in total variation distance. Our new CLT strengthens the\nCLT of Valiant and Valiant by completely removing the dependence on $n$ in the\nerror bound.\n","Comment: 68 pages, full version of STOC 2016 paper"]}]

Recent studies show that using image\nfeatures generated by pooling convolutional layer feature maps (CFMs) of a\npretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) leads to promising performance\nfor this task. However, due to the global pooling strategy adopted in those\nworks, the generated image feature is less robust to image clutter and tends to\nbe contaminated by the irrelevant image patterns. In this article, we alleviate\nthis drawback by proposing a novel reranking algorithm using CFMs to refine the\nretrieval result obtained by existing methods. Our key idea, called query\nadaptive matching (QAM), is to first represent the CFMs of each image by a set\nof base regions which can be freely combined into larger regions-of-interest.\nThen the similarity between the query and a candidate image is measured by the\nbest similarity score that can be attained by comparing the query feature and\nthe feature pooled from a combined region. We show that the above procedure can\nbe cast as an optimization problem and it can be solved efficiently with an\noff-the-shelf solver. Besides this general framework, we also propose two\npractical ways to create the base regions. One is based on the property of the\nCFM and the other one is based on a multi-scale spatial pyramid scheme.

We compute the scalar products of separate states, a class of\nstates which notably contains all the eigenstates of the model. As usual for\nmodels solved by SoV, these scalar products can be expressed as some\ndeterminants with a non-trivial dependance in terms of the inhomogeneity\nparameters that have to be introduced for the method to be applicable. We show\nthat these determinants can be transformed into alternative ones in which the\nhomogeneous limit can easily be taken. These new representations can be\nconsidered as generalizations of the well-known determinant representation for\nthe scalar products of the Bethe states of the periodic chain. In the\nparticular case where a constraint is applied on the boundary parameters, such\nthat the transfer matrix spectrum and eigenstates can be characterized in terms\nof polynomial solutions of a usual T-Q equation, the scalar product that we\ncompute here corresponds to the scalar product between two off-shell Bethe-type\nstates. If in addition one of the states is an eigenstate, the determinant\nrepresentation can be simplified, hence leading in this boundary case to direct\nanalogues of algebraic Bethe ansatz determinant representations of the scalar\nproducts for the periodic chain.\n","Comment: 39 pages"]}]

Native defects are responsible in many cases, but extrinsic\ndopants may also act as their own compensation when occupying an alternate\nlattice site. Suppressing the concentrations of compensating defects during\nprocessing close to thermal equilibrium is difficult because formation\nenthalpies are lowered as the Fermi level moves towards the majority band edge.\nExcess carriers, introduced for example by photogeneration, modify the\nformation enthalpy of semiconductor defects and thus can be harnessed during\ncrystal growth or annealing to suppress such defect populations.

Considering the quasi-Fermi levels as\nchemical potentials, we demonstrate that increasing the minority carrier\nconcentration increases the formation enthalpy for typical compensating\ncenters, thus suppressing their formation. This effect is illustrated for the\nspecific example of native GaSb antisite acceptors in nominally un-doped and\nextrinsically n-type doped GaSb.

We demonstrate here, for the first time, that the\nintroduction of a cutoff in the fermion phase-space distribution, necessary to\naccount for the finite Galaxy size, defines a new solution with a compact\nquantum core which represents an alternative to the central black hole (BH)\nscenario for SgrA*.

Some examples are categorizing online content and\nevaluating student assignments via peer grading. For this data science problem,\none challenge is to motivate participants to conduct such evaluations carefully\nand to report them honestly, particularly when doing so is costly. Existing\napproaches, notably peer-prediction mechanisms, can incentivize truth telling\nin equilibrium. However, they also give rise to equilibria in which agents do\nnot pay the costs required to evaluate accurately, and hence fail to elicit\nuseful information. We show that this problem is unavoidable whenever agents\nare able to coordinate using low-cost signals about the items being evaluated\n(e.g., text labels or pictures). We then consider ways of circumventing this\nproblem by comparing agents' reports to ground truth, which is available in\npractice when there exist trusted evaluators---such as teaching assistants in\nthe peer grading scenario---who can perform a limited number of unbiased (but\nnoisy) evaluations. Of course, when such ground truth is available, a simpler\napproach is also possible: rewarding each agent based on agreement with ground\ntruth with some probability, and unconditionally rewarding the agent otherwise.\nSurprisingly, we show that the simpler mechanism achieves stronger incentive\nguarantees given less access to ground truth than a large set of\npeer-prediction mechanisms.\n"]}]
